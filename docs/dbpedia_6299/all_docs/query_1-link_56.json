To get started:\n\nPlug in the microUSB power to the RetroTINK-5X\n\nPlug the RetroTINK-5X to your HDTV\n\nPlug in your video cable between your console and the RetroTINK 5X, select the correct input source using the remote.\n\nAt this point, you'll see sharp 1080p upscaled video output. If you're happy with the image quality, nothing else is needed - enjoy the game! If you want to explore the advanced features, check out the manual below.\n\nHelp\n\nDownload the user manual for the original firmware here.\n\nThe RetroTINK-5X community wiki with all of the latest updates.\n\nJoin the RetroTINK discord server for help.\n\nFirmware Update\n\nAll units ship from the factory with the version 1.24 firmware, which is certified for production QA and anti-piracy protection. You can find the latest firmware here:\n\nOfficial updates can be found on the Firmware Repository or Wiki.\n\nPackage Contents\n\nRetroTINK-5X\n\nIR Remote Control (2 AAA batteries not included)\n\nmicroUSB Cord\n\nQuick-start Card\n\nSticker\n\n(Optional, $5) – SCART to composite adapter to convert the SCART port into a second composite input.\n\nAdvisory Notices\n\nKnown Issues that are Under Investigation\n\nSega Master System may have sync problems.\n\nNEOGEO AES systems may have sync problems, although the latest firmware has improved this in many some cases, especially when paired with the HD Retrovision cables. For dedicated NEOGEO use, we still recommend a MVS-1C based setup as those have no problems.\n\nImage Quality\n\nThe RetroTINK-5X Pro is a high-resolution video digitizer. It will reveal any flaws in your signal chain such as, but not limited to, poor quality video cables, poor quality power supplies or consoles that are inherently noisy to begin with.\n\nVirtually any and all noise issues have nothing to do with the RetroTINK-5X Pro itself.\n\nFor the best image quality, you will need high quality video cables, such as the HD Retrovision component cables, or fully shielded/coaxial SCART RGB cables. We cannot provide support for the use of sub-par cables (such as those found on Alibaba).\n\nCompatibility\n\nWe cannot provide support or guarantee compatibility for modded consoles, including arcade conversions and superguns. Your reputable modder should be able to advise or contact us for advice to ensure proper operation.\n\nRGB SCART cables preferably use 75 ohm sync-on-luma or sync on composite. CSYNC directly from a console with the appropriate attenuation will generally work. Do not use TTL CSYNC or anything with a sync stripper in it.\n\nNot all TVs will be compatible with all modes, particularly 1440p.\n\n$325.00Price\n\nComposite to SCART Adapter\n\nI have read and agree to the advisory notices"
