        "text": "Personally, I don't think this trade-off is worth it for most users*.\n\nYesterday, I did a write up of several things that affect the way the Wii's picture looks. It includes a section on the viWidth, which is the main thing being discussed in that video.\n\nSummarizing, the Wii's picture is often stretched from its native internal resolution for good reasons: accounting for the pixel aspect ratio and filling up the screen better. This particular scale is done with 8Ã— super-sampling. If I was a diving judge I'd give it a 9.5/10, it's a nice quality scale that has very little negative impact on the final picture, but a substantial positive one.\n\nUltimately, there's far more substantive things you can do to improve the Wii's image quality (switching to 4:3 and disabling the \"deflicker\" filter are the two main ones) rather than removing this step, which looks the nicest out of everything that happens to the Wii image and provides obvious benefits.\n\nI'll also note that this video is a bit confused about aspect ratios, saying Resident Evil 4 isn't really widescreen and renders in 4:3. This is literally just how widescreen works on the Wii, like ... all the time. All widescreen games do that. The System Menu does that. It's called anamorphic widescreen and it's completely normal. It's why 4:3 looks a little bit sharper than widescreen: because it is (link to the same document as before).\n\nI said \"most users\", the exceptions would be if you're performing video capture or using an external upscaler device with your Wii, like an OSSC. In pure picture quality terms, you're probably better off getting the pixels as \"raw\" as you can and correcting the aspect ratio later, but there is a convenience cost there.\n\nThere's some Wii deflicker filter removal buzz going around various forums again right now and I came across this and wanted to ask- is the Gamecube's horizontal rescaling a much lower quality than the Wii's? Swiss has an option to disable horizontal scaling and it seems to greatly clean up the picture just in my brief testing. It certainly doesn't seem like some 8x supersampled rescale (which sounds impossible for the Wii to do too but maybe I'm misunderstanding).\n\nMy input chain is Carby HDMI -> Portta HDMI to component converter -> OSSC -> line2x to 960p -> Datapath Vision DVI capture card. Here's WarioWorld:\n\nStock output\n\nSwiss force 480p (no difference for WarioWorld) + 1:1 horizontal scaling + image editor AR adjustment to roughly equivalent\n\nZoom-in (stock left, Swiss right)\n\nMaybe the Wii scaling wouldn't hold up to this much scrutiny either but I see noticeably less ringing on the forced 1:1 scaling picture. LG OLED's all-direction zoom or a Retrotink5x can both adjust the aspect ratio at a high quality.\n\nAt the end of the day you mention convenience and that's the biggest takeaway for me. I want to put my game in my Gamecube or Wii, and start it up, but it really doesn't seem like I can do that if I want to get the best picture quality possible.\n\nSwiss can be autobooted with newer Gamecube mods (PicoBoot and Kunai), but once you're in I'd love to see an option to autoboot straight into a disc game with default settings overrides (force 480p to ensure the deflicker is off, 1:1 setting to remove horizontal scaling) instead of having to select things in multiple menus. Any advice on cutting down steps in Swiss would be appreciated since I think I can streamline it at least a bit.\n\nFor Wii it seems like you either boot up USBLoaderGX, or suffer. Maybe there's a way to set up USBLoaderGX to just autoboot what's in the disc drive too? Anything to automate these settings would be great, but it doesn't seem like we're there yet.\n\nBasically what CheatFreak47 said.\n\nHowever, for anybody who does go with using USB Loader GX to match the video width to the framebuffer, you might also want to set the viewport width to 640 in evWii. The former will make the image display too slim and the latter will make it display too wide, so they sort of cancel each other out. Unless you have an external upscaler with the ability to account for the squish from changing the video width, you may as well do that step on the Wii U via evWii. But again, I think it's more advisable to just stick with viewport 704 and letting games set their own video width unless you know for a fact they're doing it wrong, because a one-size-fits-all solution isn't really possible. Every game is different (and uses different video widths), so forcing them all to use the same one will have mixed results.\n\nAs an example of a game doing it wrong, The Simpsons: Hit and Run for GameCube uses a video width of 640 (equivalent to the Framebuffer setting in USB Loader GX) but is rendered with the assumption of square pixels (equivalent to setting video width to 704). You can tell because everything in the game looks squishy: circles look like eggs, etc. In this case, it makes sense to either adjust the width in Nintendont or set evWii to viewport width 640, either of which will stretch the game out to the originally intended aspect ratio.\n\nJust want to clarify what the consensus is for Wii & GameCube games on the Wii U. For picture quality closest to what the GameCube and Wii output, it's best to set the system to 480p, 4:3 or 16:9 depending on the game, evwii setting the viewport to 704, and deflicker to off extended. Will this fix all the issues people have with the Wii U video output except for the slight green shift? I'll skip Boot2Wii because it doesn't affect picture quality from what I understand but rather just gets to the channels faster.\n\nIt seems framebuffer is doing something the wii didn't technically intend for even if it makes certain games look better so I am not interested in that.\n\n704 is the correct viewport because the Wii never output any video beyond that?\n\nAnd from what I read on earlier threads, in order for vWii to output to correct colors it should be set to 480p in the Wii U system settings.\n\nJust want to clarify what the consensus is for Wii & GameCube games on the Wii U.

But a lot of people (myself included) generally prefer how games look without the deflicker filter, whether that's on original GC/Wii or the Wii U.\n\nFor resolution, It's kind of difficult to say what's closest to the Wii/GameCube because the analog-to-digital conversion can be destructive when running at 4:3 and 480p. In that case, we have to sacrifice something to deal with the Wii and GC's 10:11 pixels. The digital output from the Wii U has perfect 1:1 square pixels, so there will be a conversion from 10:11 to square at some point. It's kind of hard to demonstrate this with images because the phone/computer/whatever you're reading this thread on also uses square pixels, but let's go for it anyway.\n\nBelow is a raw framebuffer capture of Rush the Rock, from the GameCube game, Midway Arcade Treasures 3, running on a real Wii. It is displayed here with square pixels, not accurate 10:11 GameCube pixels, so it looks wider here than it would in real life.\n\nThe above framebuffer dump is 640*448, which is the full internal resolution of Rush the Rock. If I (a person) or the Wii U (a video game console) want to display this picture but simulate the Wii/GC pixel shape without changing the resolution, we would have to do something like this, editing the image to squish it inward:\n\nThis second shot is simulating what 10:11 pixels would look like, by squishing the image down to just 582*448, with black bars on the side to fill up the rest of the 640 pixels. You might not immediately notice with the naked eye, but some detail has been lost because we were constrained in what we could do: we're displaying the same picture using less pixels. If it helps anybody to visualize it, Wii pixels are skinnier, so it can fit more of them horizontally into an image compared to the Wii U when running at the same vertical resolution (e.g. 480p).\n\nIf you're running the Wii U at 480p, you're essentially doing what that edited image above does, using ~582 square pixels to display what was once the 640 pixels that went into the analog signal of the original consoles. In short, the input resolution is higher than the output resolution. For people familiar with Dolphin, their solution is to display at the native horizontal resolution and increase the vertical resolution to simulate Wii pixels, but we can't just \"increase the resolution of 480p\" in real life.\n\nThe obvious solution on Wii U, then, is to use a higher output resolution, i.e. run the Wii U at 720p or 1080p. At 720p, those 640 input pixels are being scaled across ~873 output pixels. At 1080p, they're being scaled across ~1309 output pixels. In either case that's more than the input, meaning you're not outright losing any of the picture like you are when outputting 480p. However, you now have to contend with the Wii U's upscaling, which you might find unappealing if you have a TV or external upscaler that does it better. It's a tradeoff, honestly I can't really recommend a specific output resolution, it will depend on your hardware setup and your personal preferences.\n\nTo say the Wii U will never display more than 704 pixels is slightly misleading because the hardware is capable of it and a handful of homebrews allow this (off the top of my head, I'm pretty sure Eke-Eke's Genesis Plus GX and Extrems's Not64 both support this), but commercial software never does, and the Wii was not designed with the expectation that people would ever see more than 704 pixels horizontally. 704 completely filled all correctly-tuned analog televisions of the era.\n\nMy understanding of the \"color is wrong at HD resolutions\" issue is that it's more of a possibility than a certainty. The Wii U outputs limited range RGB. All televisions will assume a standard-def signal is limited range, but some televisions may assume an HD signal is full range RGB. If your TV has that issue, displaying at 720p/1080p will result in washed out colors, although if it helps, that's the TV's fault rather than the Wii U's. If your TV has support for full range RGB, it probably also has an option somewhere in the picture settings to use limited range RGB for specific inputs, so the issue should be fixable by just setting your TV up correctly."
