        "text": "I think this is an interesting area, so let's have another thread for it to avoid derailing tryingtimes'\n\nNick, I'm really unsure what point you was making there.\n\nIf you have a source of PAL 576/50, it will convert that into 576/25, especially on a LCD/DLP as interlasing really does'nt make any sense, on a CRT things are different.\n\nPAL is actually a lot simpler than our USA friends who have to worry about the 3:2 pulldown etc, so PAL is not like NTSC. But even then a it's not a total loss.\n\nHave a look here->\n\nhttp://www.hometheaterhifi.com/forum/showthread.php?t=3851\n\neg. SKY uses 1080i/50, now SKY do a lot of sports programmes, if 1080i/50 was causing interlasing artifacts they would be a lot of unhappy subscribers out there. A 1080i/50 will look just as clean and smooth as a 1080p/25.\n\nI'm going to ignore the distinction between 576i and 1080i and instead talk about handling of 50Hz signals as I understand it.\n\nSo the source for UK TV broadcasts is either film (25p once sped up) or video (50Hz interlaced) - the latter might be captured at 50p but it never reaches us like that and therefore my guess is that in the broadcast chain they might choose to save the bandwidth & use 50i all the way along. Maybe. It's irrelevant anyway. What we get is effectively from a 50i video source.\n\nNow the actual signal delivered is 50i of course, irrespective of what the source was.\n\nA film should be converted back to a full progressive frame at 25fps, but almost certainly the signal carried to the screen (or processed inside the TV) will be at 50Hz, just with 2:2 repeat where each of the 25 frames has been blended together from consecutive odd & even fields.\n\nSport at 25fps would be horrible. Movies limit the speed of pans to avoid to large a jump between frames because of the relatively low framerate. You can't do that with sport, it has to follow the speed of the action, so in that case what you want and get is 50 progressive frames per second where the deinterlacing has filled in the blank lines in the field using whatever algorithm it has available.\n\nSo there's a big difference between 1080i/50 and 1080p/25 and each has their place. Of course, if you could have sport at 1080p/50 or 1080p/60... then I think it's fair to say that would be a good deal preferable but it's not an option yet.\n\nOk, I see why this thread was started.\n\nIt's the long standing posters gang up on the newbie thread..\n\nHeh, I've no problems with that. I can banter until the cows come home.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not sure if this is a wind up yet, because both your post counts appear high, so one would assume you understand where I'm coming from.\n\nNo it isn't, for the reasons I stated above. I'm getting 1080p/50*... with half of each frame generated mathematically.\n\nYes, & why would'nt a half frame be calculated on 1080i/50 again?.\n\nAnd do you have a source to back up why the human eye can only see 18 frames a second?\n\nWell it was one of the reasons the pre-sound format was 18 fps. In the old days they required the least number of fps to save on reals & reals of tape. 18fps was decided to be least number of FPS to convey fluid motion. You can give yourself a very simple example of how slow your eyes do actually perceive motion, get your hand and shake it as fast as you can in front of your eyes. Do you see blurs?, yes of course and this is how the brain interpretes this fast motion, another example put a fast moving movie on, now pause it, can you see how it looks blured?, this is deliberate so that it can duplicate what your eyes perceive. Now seen as motion pictures implement this motion blur into movies, I'm not actually sure what extra information you could get from interpolating the frames.\n\nWhy can I clearly see the difference between a game running at 30fps and 60fps for example? I know that motion blur as captured by film cameras helps to improve the impression of smooth transition from one frame to the next, and that doesn't apply with games (usually) but why as low as 18?\n\nI'm actually a gamer too, PC gaming is a bit different to motion pictures. For a start games don't implement motion blur, unless its for special effects. Eg. in car games an often technique to make you look like your going faster, is to add a little motion blur. So if you run at 60 instead of 30, 60 will look more fluid because your brain is now giving you real motion blur.\n\nHere is a link that explains it better->\n\nhttp://blogs.msdn.com/shawnhar/archive/2007/08/21/motion-blur.aspx\n\n*Actually I'm personally getting 768p/50 on my screen but that's beside the point.\n\nGood for you, but not really sure what your gaining if your just watching movies.\n\nOne final note:\n\nIf you really beleive 50 FPS would make films and the like look better, I would suggest you contact the Film industry and tell them they have made a terrible mistake using 24 FPS.\n\nOk, I see why this thread was started.\n\nIt's the long standing posters gang up on the newbie thread..\n\nHeh, I've no problems with that. I can banter until the cows come home.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not sure if this is a wind up yet, because both your post counts appear high, so one would assume you understand where I'm coming from.\n\nNot at all. Just that this is not a simple area so getting all the facts out on the table helps to establish a good, shared understanding. I wouldn't waste my own time on a ganging up thread.\n\nYes, & why would'nt a half frame be calculated on 1080i/50 again?.\n\nSorry, I don't understand that question. Could you elaborate?\n\nWell it was one of the reasons the pre-sound format was 18 fps.

Now seen as motion pictures implement this motion blur into movies, I'm not actually sure what extra information you could get from interpolating the frames.\n\nInteresting, didn't know they used to use 18. I did mention the blurring on film exposure too. But with sport capped on a digital camera, you're not going to get the benefit of that (and actually the blurring would be quite undesirable, no?)\n\nI'm actually a gamer too, PC gaming is a bit different to motion pictures. For a start games don't implement motion blur, unless its for special effects. Eg. in car games an often technique to make you look like your going faster, is to add a little motion blur.

With still images, frame rate needs to be higher to compensate. But this clearly shows the human eye can detect more than 18fps.\n\nGood for you, but not really sure what your gaining if your just watching movies.\n\n?? I was just pointing out I was ultimately getting a lower res than 1080p because I don't have a FullHD panel but it's not relevant to the discussion.\n\nOne final note:\n\nIf you really beleive 50 FPS would make films and the like look better, I would suggest you contact the Film industry and tell them they have made a terrible mistake using 24 FPS.\n\nI didn't say films would look better. There's a certain art to the movie framerate that I wouldn't ever want to see changed. Actually the only reason it's 24 is because of the kind of technical & financial limitations you mentioned yourself. If they could have done 50fps in 1920, I bet they would have. I said video (esp sport) is 50Hz interlaced (in Europe) and that once you deinterlace it... it's still 50p. Just that half the lines in each frame were not recorded or transmitted and have been \"guessed\".\n\nSo my one question to you is, ignoring all the complexity of the movie discussion, games, human eye etc; do you believe that a TV takes a 50i video-sourced (not film) input and changes it to 25p?\n\nOk, I see why this thread was started.\n\nIt's the long standing posters gang up on the newbie thread..\n\nNot at all, I think everyone is being quite patient and benevolent. You can learn a lot in these forums, (I certainly have) but only by being open-minded. You quote a HomeTheaterHiFi thread, but it's the technical articles that have the real authority. Here is the classic article:\n\nhttp://www.hometheaterhifi.com/volume_7_4/dvd-benchmark-part-5-progressive-10-2000.html\n\nAnd this 10-piece article by the architect of HQV is another great reference:\n\nhttp://www.hqv.com/technology/index1/video_processor.cfm?CFID=&CFTOKEN=44030951\n\nOne final note:\n\nIf you really beleive 50 FPS would make films and the like look better, I would suggest you contact the Film industry and tell them they have made a terrible mistake using 24 FPS.\n\n[ON SOAPBOX] Now I absolutely agree with you there! I don't think 24 fps is enough; I'm not sure that 50 or 60fps are enough, but we can make do with that. I would really love to see film shot on high resolution 50 or 60 fps video cameras, but I dopn't think we'll see that for a very long time. There is a great tradition of using actual film for movies, and producers and punters seem to expect to see poor blacks, motion blur, grain, limited dynamic range and gamut. Through conditioning, they expect that to be the real thing, while video can provide a more immediate and convincing suspension of disbelief. [/OFF SOAPBOX]\n\nBut enough of that, have you noticed that the more recent blu-ray players are actually able to output 24 fps video for films that are recored on disc. It's better that way, because it's at the right frame rate, there's no telecine process or judder, it's how it's mastered on the disc, and it's just plain the right way to do it. The latest and greatest HD displays accept this and display it appropriately. Sometimes they say they frame rate convert to 48, 72 or 96fps, but that is only repeating the existing frames, and it's not really relevant to think in those terms with digital displays, where there is no CRT-style scanning used any more.\n\nVideo from TV sources, where the original capture was done on an interlaced scanning camera (typical for TV) is quite unlike film, and always has a different scene in each field. In this case, PAL most certainly does not become 576p/25 after de-interlacing. Ever. There are always 50 uniques captures in time, and the refresh rate is always 50fps.\n\nBR, Nick\n\nNot at all. Just that this is not a simple area so getting all the facts out on the table helps to establish a good, shared understanding. I wouldn't waste my own time on a ganging up thread.\n\nOk, not a problem!! Debate is good and that's what makes forums interesting.\n\nSorry, I don't understand that question. Could you elaborate?\n\nWell, when a footy match etc are recorded at source in the UK we use 25 fps, Movies as you know are shot at 24 fps. So to get back at this 25 fps we could use PAL 576/25p or PAL 576/50i, at the end of the day they both are only going to give you the original 25 fps, IOW: try to think of 25p & 50i as just a protocol, they both give the same image at the same fps, its just how that imformation is transmitted. Now in both case you could convert this same raw 25 fps in 576/50p, and if you wanted you could interpolate the images to give you extra frames in-between it did'nt really matter if that source came from 576/25p or 576/50i. As I pointed out in another thread interlasing really only applys to CRT, so in modern day LCD etc it not really relevent. I assume the reason why 1080i/50 even came out was to make it easer to convert into 576i/50 as a lot people then were still using CRT.\n\nSo my one question to you is, ignoring all the complexity of the movie discussion, games, human eye etc; do you believe that a TV takes a 50i video-sourced (not film) input and changes it to 25p?\n\nYes,.. Unless as I pointed out above your pumping this into a CRT, and then the interlasing actually has advantages in avoiding flicker.\n\nIndeed you often see what's called \"combing\" artefacts when a TV mistakenly treats a 50i source as film and tries to combine two fields into a single frame.\n\nWhen it IS correctly identified as interlaced video, you're right, there is the issue that you don't know what was in the gaps so algorithms of various effectiveness, speed and cost (mentioned by tryingtimes above) are used to make a best guess.\n\nAnd deliberately setting a video processor to film mode on a video source confirms how truly nasty the results are. In fact, the mere existence of a minimum of \"Film\" and \"Video\" modes on video processors is because of this difference in how they're recorded.\n\nIt's referred to on page 1 here\n\nhttp://www.bbctraining.com/pdfs/articleHighDefinition.pdf\n\n\"temporal offset of 1/50th of a second\" and refers to interlacing artefacts on horizontal objects on page 2\n\nThis talks about 50i as the standard PAL/SECAM format\n\nhttp://www.hdtv.biz/hdtv_information.shtml\n\nThis page talks about it ... clumsily\n\nhttp://www.burnyourbonus.info/hdtv-faq/faq2.html\n\n\"When you watch a film on TV, each frame is scanned into a pair of interlaced frames which are shown successively. TV cameras capture the half frames at staggered intervals\"\n\nwikipedia has it too of course\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video\n\n\"For example, PAL video format is often specified as 576i50, where 576 indicates the vertical line resolution, i indicates interlacing, and 50 indicates 50 fields (half-frames) per second.\"\n\nI am kind of conscious that none of these are exactly \"official\" so if I find something better, I'll add it.\n\nCertainly all the football on SkyHD is still 50i/Video mode as are most of the live recordings shown on BBC HD (e.g. Joules Holland etc), anyone with an external video processor can confirm this.\n\nI can also say that when we're developing new deinterlacers we still have to worry about video mode, in fact its the biggest thing we have to worry about as film mode is relatively easy to deal with. We wouldn't be doing this if it didn't repreasent a significant proportion of broadcast and pre-recorded material still.\n\nWith respect to frame rate the key issue is that when capturing film/video material you're actually descretely sampling something that naturally has a continuous function this leads aliasing that is perceived in the form of jerkynes. Film compensates for his by caturing the image continuously over time so introducing moting blur. However digital display devices re-introduce motion artifacts due to the way the image is presented to the eye (CRT's don't suffer from this problem), this is typically seen as double images along the edges of moving objects. To get around this manufacturers are now starting to introduce frame rate conversion that interpolates between frames (not just duplication). This is actally a non trivial problem to solve but the new Sony's (Motion Flow) seem to be about the best at this at the moment, it not perfect but it defenitley reduces motion related artifacts when its working.\n\nJohn."
