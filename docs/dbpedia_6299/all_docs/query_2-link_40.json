        "text": "Hi - I am having a similar issue regarding UI scaling. I am playing in 2K resolution and the ui size is too small for me. I tried your suggested solution of changing the preferences.prop file - but I cannot seem to find it on my system.\n\nI have the game installed through EA Desktop - maybe that's the problem? Althought I also tried uninstalling it and reinstalling through Origin and still could not find that file. Any idea where it might be located instead?\n\nHi @Vovie000 - The file is located in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Origin Games\\SimCity\\SimCityUserData\\Preferences\n\nMake sure you're in Program Files (x86), not the Documents folder\n\nIf you're not finding it, you might have to enable \"View Hidden Files & Folders\" in File Explorer: View tab > Options > Change folder and search options;\n\nOn the View tab > check the box that says \"Show Hidden files, folders and drives\"\n\nYou'll want to open the preferences.prop file with a text editor (like Notepad). You can copy the file first, just to be cautious. Then choose \"Save\" when you're done editing. Double-check to be sure it didn't add the *.txt extension to the end. (if it does add the extension, just rename the file back to preferences.prop)\n\nSetting the OptionUIZoomLevel to 2 will double the UI size, if that's not enough you can try setting it to 3 to triple it.\n\nHappy building!\n\nHi @BlackjackWidow, thanks for the response.\n\nI already had hidden files enabled, but I turned it off and did what you suggested just to make sure.\n\nAdditionally, my games are installed on a separate hard drive from my C drive. I still do not see the preferences file.\n\nI also looked in the C drive for the SimcityUserData folder, but no dice there either.\n\nAttached are screenshots of both locations.\n\nG: Drive\n\nC: Drive\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n@Vovie000 - Thanks for the screenshots, always helpful to see what's going on. Maybe the folder is only created once you play or save a city. Have you run the tutorial yet?\n\nHere's what I would suggest - let's put some command line switches in to force a lower resolution for now. Then you should be able to flip through the tutorial and hopefully the SimCityUserData folder will be created so you can change the UI scale.\n\nIn Origin, right-click the SimCity icon & choose Game Properties. Click on the tab Advanced Launch Options & in the Command Line Arguments type:\n\n\"-w â€“r:1024x768\"\n\nwithout the quotation marks. This will run the game in windowed mode (-w) at 1024x768 resolution. If you've already run the tutorial, then I would suggest starting a region / city in this mode. You don't have to do much in this resolution, just enough to create a save. Then save and exit the game & check for the preferences folder again. Once you configure the UI scale, then remove the command line arguments from Origin.\n\nFYI - you can use -f for full screen instead of -w for windowed, or force a different resolution using the format \"-r:HHHHxRRRR\" For instance, -r:2560x1440 -r:1920x1080 -r:1600x900\n\nThe UHD resolution (2560x1440) will have the tiny UI scale until you change it in the preferences.prop file, but 1080p (1920x1080) works pretty well at default. That's the resolution I use."
