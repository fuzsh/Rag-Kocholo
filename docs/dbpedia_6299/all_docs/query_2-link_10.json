        "text": "People complain about the black bars and Sky/Fox would rather cater to the \"uninformed\" than leave it be.\n\nIt also means that it's not quite so obvious that they're showing a 20+ year old episode, for the umpteenth time*.\n\nAlso from memory it's the same rights holder that utterly screwed the pooch with various botched and half hearted 16:9 conversions, Fox did them for the Simpsons and the famously bad Buffy widescreen transfer amongst others.\n\nAt least with Buffy they did try to go back to the source materials, even if it meant they got camera equipment in the shots, used the wrong takes, and forgot to apply the colour filters - from what I've heard there is barely a scene without a major issue, including zooming in to get a full width picture, even if it meant losing the heads of people who were talking.\n\n*I used to enjoy the Simpsons on Sky, right up until I could never work out looking at the listings if it was going to be a new episode, or the same one they'd shown a dozen times in 2-3 months.\n\n4\n\nIf you upscale unless you have widescreen versions of the footage you still either have bars, upscaling and cropping, or upscaling and distorting the aspect ratio, and the original ratio with bars is the only to do it right.\n\nThere is no way to get a full 16:9 picture from a 4:3 format source without doing one of the above (think of how you fit your digital photos onto the print size/ratio you select).\n\nMost TV/Film was shot using cameras/lenses/film that was correct for the aspect ratio they intended it to be shown in, or in some cases films are shot with the aspect ratio for the Cinema, but with most of the primary action contained within the \"TV ratio\" area so you could crop the image for home viewing and still have it ok.\n\nSome shows were filmed with things like widescreen or HD in mind before the formats became common (but when it was out/coming soon and the production could afford it and planned ahead*), hence why some things that were originally broadcast in 4:3 could be shown in widescreen later on without black bars or cropping the height and zooming in (they effectively showed a cropped version originally).\n\nIIRC in the case of Buffy it was a little unusual in that a lot of it was filmed using widescreen equipment, but only framed for 4:3 with no intention of a lot of it being shown in widescreen, hence things like cameras, edges of sets. and crew in some of the \"remastered\" widescreen shots as it was cropped to remove them in the original 4:3 edit.\n\nIn the case of the Simpsons everything would have been animated either on cels or computer to the specified TV ratio and resolution, no chance of getting a true widescreen picture out of episodes that were drawn for 4:3.\n\nAlthough like anything shot on film there was the potential to get a true HD transfer in the original ratio for anything done on paper/cells (anything done on computer would only ever be an upscale), but given the budgets and the detail levels there isn't much point in a HD transfer of many weekly cartoons except to give it a clearer picture or to do away with standards conversions (you're unlikely to gain any real detail, unlike an animation done for cinema which is usually much higher detail, or anything live action**).\n\nIn short, black/white/blank bars are the only way to show the correct aspect ratio for a programme on a display that is of a different aspect ratio, anything else is going to require losing some of the original picture.\n\n*Which is why the BBC often seems to film things ready for the new formats even if they are unable to use them for broadcast initially (things like the nature documentaries which were filmed in HD/UHD before the broadcast standards were fully laid out, so they had the raw footage ready).\n\n**One of the fun things about the Star Trek TNG HD remasters is trying to spot and read the comments on the screens, apparently the effects people who made the screens and did the text liked a bit of fun referencing TV, film, books and making jokes about the script, and I believe there is a website that lists them.\n\n3"
