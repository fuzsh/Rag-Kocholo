At least when Seinfeld was shot originally, much of the image beyond the initial televised safe area wasn't used, which made it much easier to compose for widescreen when remastering it for HD.\n\ntbh all of your examples except that last one lose absolutely nothing of value. Even the framing works fine. That last image is pretty shitty since a joke is cut off. Its worth it to not have black bars though. I never minded horizontal bars, but vertical ones trigger me way more than missing a joke here or there.\n\nIt is altering a work of art from its original version. It should never be butchered like that, even if the framing works well, because that is not the framing they originally intended for it to have.\n\ntbh all of your examples except that last one lose absolutely nothing of value.

I never minded horizontal bars, but vertical ones trigger me way more than missing a joke here or there.\n\nNo way, they all have strange framing in the cropped versions, especially the first one. Nobody would ever frame an establishing shot like that. It's not just a bad thing to do to the show, they did it badly most of the time.\n\nI refuse to watch any episode that's presented like this.

Which is probably never gonna happen. :/ I don't think anyone actually does that. Apparently The Wire and X-Files completely blew up the picture with cropping. With The Wire, it ruined a lot of shots - with X-Files, it lost a lot of the eeriness but that's just more due to the fact that you can now see all the shitty CGI thank to the res. bump lol\n\nAnyway, for now, I'll make do with the 16:9 1080p rips (originally from Amazon, I believe but I just torrent that because it can't be found anywhere else) and my original 4:3 Fridge boxset on my desk lol\n\nIsn't there an option/flag on Simpsons World that allows you to watch non-HD seasons in their 4:3 resolution by choice?\n\nI know FXX won't screen them that way but I thought there were enough complaints for the online streaming service that they made those available.\n\nNo, the \"HD\" version (badly upscaled using SD broadcast tapes) is only available in cropped 16:9.\n\nApparently The Wire and X-Files completely blew up the picture with cropping.

Once again, to bring up Dragon Ball, Funimation tried to do a Blu-Ray release of DBZ that was a proper 4:3 1080p remaster (from their own aged late-generation copies instead of Toei's masters, but still...), but people apparently flipped their shit because it \"wasn't HD,\" leading them to kill these releases only 2 sets in and instead do another cropped widescreen release.\n\nTrue.\n\nI still want the 1080p or 4k master in 4:3 personally.

I remember David Simon, the creator of The Wire, spoke about this too when the series was going to be released in HD and widescreen too.\n\nhttps://www.indiewire.com/2014/12/d...escreen-conversion-of-the-wire-for-hd-269568/\n\nIsn't there an option/flag on Simpsons World that allows you to watch non-HD seasons in their 4:3 resolution by choice?\n\nI know FXX won't screen them that way but I thought there were enough complaints for the online streaming service that they made those available.\n\nYes, this is true. Depending on platform the option may be buried in an \"Extras\" menu for the episode, but it's there. It's the best way to watch the early seasons as intended without the original DVD sets\n\nThey are the worst, and the smeary pq is worse than the crop\n\nBuffy is the same\n\nNo, there is a proper HD version of Buffy now without digital noise removal that was scanned from the original film material.\n\nHowever, it is missing tons of post production effects, color correction, filters, occasionally filming equipment etc. is visible on the sides and sometimes the framing is bad, because they cheaped out and didn't properly remaster it. But unlike Simpsons, at least it's real HD.\n\nThere is a Facebook (sorry) page showing the problems: https://m.facebook.com/notes/buffy-...fys-hd-september-2015-update/590282824407343/\n\nIsn't there an option/flag on Simpsons World that allows you to watch non-HD seasons in their 4:3 resolution by choice?\n\nI know FXX won't screen them that way but I thought there were enough complaints for the online streaming service that they made those available.\n\nThere is, but they're reduced to 480p.\n\nIronically, the cropped versions are the actual HD film prints (sans any shots with credits). They look extremely good in HD, but it would be fantastic if FOX released a golden era set in full 1080p uncropped.\n\nIt's actually kind of funny, but human POV is actually closer to a huge gumdrop shape than a ninja mask stripe like widescreen. Therefore gigantic 4:3 would be better to have than 16:9/etc for immersion. I say this despite owning a 3440x1440 lol. (Content reasons).\n\nIt would be cool if '4k' was actually ~4000x3000 instead of ~4000x2160.\n\nIirc isn't this the IMAX approach?\n\nIt's actually kind of funny, but human POV is actually closer to a huge gumdrop shape than a ninja mask stripe like widescreen.
