        "text": "576i - Interlaced scanning (Interlace - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)\n\n576p - Progressive scanning (Progressive scan - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)\n\nThese are different method how picture is drawn/displayed on our TV screen. Most TV's support only Interlaced scanning. But LCD/Plasma screens support both.\n\nProgressive gives better picture quality\n\nHello SVK, thanks for that information.\n\nBut I also faced differences in the usage.\n\nFor e.g., I have have a favorite with UTV and NDTV.\n\nIn 576i -> I chose UTV thro' favorites. After 5 min, I press the down button, I get NDTV ( within the favorites )\n\nIn 576p -> I chose UTV tho' favorites. After info menu disappears, I press the down button. I get some other channel as the mode is already switched from \"favorite\" to \"TV\"\n\nI tested this several times with same results. Did anybody else experience such differences???\n\nHello SVK, thanks for that information.\n\nBut I also faced differences in the usage.\n\nFor e.g., I have have a favorite with UTV and NDTV.\n\nIn 576i -> I chose UTV thro' favorites.
