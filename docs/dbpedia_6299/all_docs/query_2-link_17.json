Instead of using an entire episode, I found a segment of the first Halloween special that works well and is only seven or eights minutes long. I pull this out when I want to do a quick review or have fifteen to twenty minutes I need to fill. No need to wait for Halloween. Students enjoy this more-funny-than-spooky story any time of the year.\n\nThis post may contain affiliate links and I may earn a small commission when you click on the links at no additional cost to you.

You can show the episode, The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror Season 1 Episode 1, via Disney Plus or you can get it on Amazon Prime.\n\nHere are my worksheets to go with it üôÇ\n\nExposition\n\nThe segment opens with the Simpson family having a family bbq. There is just enough dialogue and action for students to glean a bit of background information and make inferences about the setting.\n\nConflict\n\nIn what is hopefully an obvious example of conflict, a spaceship appears over the yard and quickly beams up the entire family.\n\nRising Action\n\nEven though this will all happen with a minute or two, there are various incidents of rising action or increasing tension happening in this section. Most of the rising action is in relation to how the aliens appear to be fattening up the humans to eat them.\n\nClimax\n\nLisa and the rest of her family confront the aliens about their nefarious intentions to eat them.\n\nFalling Action\n\nJust as quickly as the climax arrives, it fizzles out. The aliens explain away everything the Simpson family (mostly Lisa) thought was evidence of the alien‚Äôs wicked intentions.\n\nResolution\n\nThe Simpsons are returned home and given a lecture about their behavior."
