        "text": "For a small webinar studio a company bought the new Sony HXR-NX100 (pal). It looks like a good camera for the money but the hdmi output is limited as I can see to 1080p/576. Unfortunately with the capture card the only setting that is working is the 1080i/576i export from the camera. I’m more than familiar with 1080, 720p or 576, but never worked with this strange resolutions. What is the exact output? Do I miss something?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\niMac Retina 5K, 27 inch, late 2014, 4 GHz Intel Core i7, 24 GB 1600 MHz DDR3, AMD Radeon R9 M295X 4096 MB, 500gb flash\n\nCC 2014/Avid MC 8.3/Davinci 11 lite\n\nIf you are referring to “1080i/576i” this simply means it can output HD or SD. In the US it would be called 1080i/480i”.\n\nI can’t speak for PAL cameras, but in the US, they mostly output 1080i even if camera is set to record 1080p. The output is 1080i because that is compatible with all displays while 1080p is not always supported.\n\nThanks\n\nJeff Pulera\n\nSafe Harbor Computers"
