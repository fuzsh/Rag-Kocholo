(Not counting the trickery Factor 5 does where they render one frame in two passes to get MSAA.) When you're playing in 16:9, the game isn't rendering with a width of 1024, it's rendering at something like 640 (sometimes slightly less) and then getting stretched.\n\n(05-25-2021, 10:54 AM)kevincrans Wrote: Luckily pal also supports 50hz, so if Dolphin adds that down to the 640x480 resolution, it can skip drawing 1 out of 6 frames to improve performance.\n\nThis is already how it works.\n\n(05-25-2021, 05:27 PM)JosJuice Wrote: The GameCube and Wii are incapable of rendering at a resolution higher than 640x528.

Found ntsc wouldn't be a full number and thought 50hz required 20% faster performance.\n\nCan't Dolphin hack 384x576i->768X576p then (and stretch it to 1024 pixels)?\n\nThe Wii virtual console supports 288p and gamecube supports 240p and 360p, so Dolphin should add those resolutions.\n\nGamecube also supports even lower framerates like 25hz and 30hz (right?) and interlacing, so supporting/forcing those would be cool as well to enhance performace.\n\n(05-27-2021, 06:19 PM)kevincrans Wrote: Can't Dolphin hack 384x576i->768X576p then (and stretch it to 1024 pixels)?\n\nI'm not entirely sure what you mean here. Dolphin renders at the resolution the original console renders at (assuming the internal resolution is set to Native), and then stretches the output to get the correct aspect ratio.\n\n(05-27-2021, 06:19 PM)kevincrans Wrote: The Wii virtual console supports 288p and gamecube supports 240p and 360p, so Dolphin should add those resolutions.\n\nGamecube also supports even lower framerates like 25hz and 30hz (right?) and interlacing, so supporting/forcing those would be cool as well to enhance performace.\n\nDolphin already renders at the resolution and framerate used on the original console. (Interlacing isn't supported by Dolphin, but that wouldn't gain you any performance.) Trying to apply lower resolutions and framerates than a game used on the original console is generally not possible without lots of stuff breaking, so Dolphin does not support that.\n\n(05-27-2021, 06:50 PM)JosJuice Wrote: I'm not entirely sure what you mean here.

Trying to apply lower resolutions and framerates than a game used on the original console is generally not possible without lots of stuff breaking, so Dolphin does not support that.\n\nThe Gamecube native resolutions are 576i, 240p, 360p (Gameboy player) and 480p (I think no GC game makes use of 288p, which is the native resolution of wii Virtual Console).\n\nI don't know if 25hz and 30hz are gamecube native or downscaled refreshrates.\n\nSo there is nothing unnative about Pal 576i and the others, unless you are going to force it and render the lines between the interlacing."
