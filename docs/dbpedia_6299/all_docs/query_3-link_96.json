        "text": "The \"peak\" of The Simpsons, the Golden Era, whatever various places on the internet calls it, seems to range from anything from S2-11 to S4-9 to anything in between, depending on how discerning the person talking about it is. I don't think it's possible to define this by something as broad as purely the series numbers, and to do that is unfair on various factors surrounding either end of whatever numbers you choose, be it stuff from the early days or stuff from the time where it became irredeemably terrible. So, I'll attempt to justify various things in it and hope it makes sense.\n\nThe widely held view, or at least the most common one, has the peak beginning mostly at S4, some at S3, very few including either S1 or S2. I should add I'm not basing this on anything scientific, rather just what I've 'seen' in being online a lot and enjoying re-living The Simpsons as part of that jolly adventure. Now, S1 has many faults. The voices, the designs, the animations, even the characters, are embryonic. This does not make them bad. To expect a TV show to have appeared in the beginning of the 90s that was S4 of The Simpsons, well, it would be impossible. There had to be a period of exploration, of trying to get things right, to get to the standard they would eventually reach. While there is nothing especially stand-out of S1 this does not lessen it or make it bad, and ultimately when viewing the show as a whole S1 becomes important purely to see the advancement and development of the show as a whole. In several S1 episodes, we see key show tropes and staples set up that are revisited later:\n\n- Episode one, Santa's Little Helper joins the family. Is introduced with Homer's line \"He's useless! He's pathetic! He's.... a Simpson.\" The episode as a whole also encourages the strong family tie that old people of the time seemed to miss, assuming it was a show for delinquents featuring delinquents. Their Christmas was ruined because they had no money, but they had a family, and everyone was happy.\n\n- Episode two, Bart cheats on a test and is thought a \"genius,\" before he eventually comes clean. For as much as Bart's \"bad boy\" image is played on in various ways throughout the show and its merchandising, the best Bart episodes always feature his humility, his empathy and his humanity. This episode does it.\n\n- Episode three, Homer gets his job as safety inspector. This episode features the father in a typical nuclear family construct losing his job, writing a suicide note for his family to find in the morning and then going out to jump off a bridge. Could you imagine any other variety of sitcom doing this? The relative obscurity of a weird animated show is what allows them to do this in 1990, and from this point in the episode it helps flesh out Homer as something beyond simply the butt of jokes about being dumb and fat. he embarks on his titular Odyssey to improve the safety of his family and the people of Springfield, much like Bart in the episode previous he shows his capacity for empathy in doing so. It also explores how Homer is simply a working man, working hard to provide for his family.\n\n- Episode four sees the disastrous company picnic where Homer is embarrassed by his family for a number of reasons (and Mr. Burns is unaware who the person he appointed safety inspector the episode previously is), forcing them to go to therapy. The therapy fails because of how apparently dysfunctional they are, but herein lies the joy of the family that is the Simpsons - their dysfunctionality is what keeps them together. For the amount of noise Marge and Homer make about fixing the family while they're all shocking each other, they return home, they sit down in front of the TV, and they're happy. They're a family that understand each other and works, which is what allows the show as a whole to work. For all of the things that the Simpsons can do together or to each other, the solace is that they all have each other to fall back on, in a scenario which works.\n\n- Episode five is the one where Bart unites the entire city's population of children to throw water balloons at Nelson. I always felt this one worked (and had some notable moments including great animation as Bart imagines being beaten up by Nelson, Grampa and Herman declaring terms of war, Grampa writing his angry letter to some television person, then Bart talking about the glorification of war at the end of the episode) because it showed that while Bart is still the bad boy, causes untold horror to his parents and his teachers, he still has a buly. He still goes through what so many kids go through, and he is able to overcome it with the help of his peers.\n\n- Episode six, the first appearance of Bleeding Gums Murphy, the first instance of Lisa being miserable, well, you all know how much \"Lisa is unhappy\" is a recurring theme. This episode introduces Lisa well, for all of the times Lisa is misunderstood by her family here she finds her place in the world, and most importantly has the support of Marge in doing so. Marge initially tries to have Lisa keep her head down and pretend everything is fine (a recurring theme of Marge, see her going to Rancho Relaxo, her nervous ramblings when she's in therapy, her drinking when she moves to... the place where Hank Scorpio works), only to then realise this can't work. Her daughter needs her more than this, and she recognises this and supports her in being her.\n\n- Episode seven, the Simpsons go camping. There's two main relationships in this, Homer and Bart then Marge and Lisa, and the various differences in this. There's also Maggie proving she's a supergenius by getting a bunch of bears to do her bidding, but that's not as important. Here the Simpsons are withdrawn from their typical surroundings and the surroundings of the typical families they mirror in the real world, and are forced to survive both the world and each other. The basic relationships in this one play a bit of a backseat to some of the jokes, most of the humour in the episode being in the difference between how the two women work and survive just fine, while the \"experienced woodsman\" Homer and Bart lose their clothes and go hungry in the first night.\n\n- Episode eight, the one where Bart cuts the head of Jebediah Springfield, it's sort of a combination of Bart the Genius and Bart the General, as he does something to impress the actual bullies, then realises it's wrong, and reverses it. It has all the good stuff the other two episodes do.\n\n- Episode nine focuses on the strength of the head of the family, Homer and Marge, as Marge gets taken in by a sleazy Frenchman who shows her actual attention and affection only to eschew this and return to her family. Seeing Homer's dejection and desolation as he realises he's losing his wife but doesn't realise how or why, it's deep. That his own shortsightedness and selfishness caused it when he bought her a bowling ball for her birthday makes the redemption of the family all the sweeter.\n\n- Episode ten, Homer gets his picture taken with an exotic dancer. Marge finds out and throws him out. Homer rectifies it by giving a speech to a packed club there to watch exotic dancers about how great women are, how they're not objects. He does it to enforce the point to his son about how women should be seen and treated, meaning that the overall message is one again about strengthening the family on a basis of strong moral values.\n\n- Episode eleven, Bart goes to France. Bart singlehandedly brings down an abusive hierarchy through his pluckiness. Do you see a pattern? Elsewhere, the absence of Bart in Springfield reinforces how important he is to the other family members, and as much as Homer at times seems to prefer having Adil as a son, the reconciliation of the family at the end of the episode, fuelled by Bart's return, is genuine.\n\n- Episode twelve, the first Sideshow Bob episode (and the first Kent Brockman episode, according to Wikipedia), Bart takes on and defeats a corrupt criminal. With the help of Lisa. Aside from the obvious recurring Sideshow Bob trope and the various things that happen in his episodes, something Matt Groening mentions in the DVD commentaries of episodes a few times is how the design of Krusty is based on Homer - he essentially is Homer except a different colour, and with hair. The point of this, of Krusty being Bart's hero, is to emulate Homer, and the effort Bart puts into saving Krusty, the father substitute, is heartening. All in the family, again.\n\n- Episode thirteen and Bart and Lisa (and Maggie) combine to take down a criminal okay we know where this is going.\n\nNow, I could go through and do this for every episode, but I'd be here a while. The basic point of all of this is that S1, for its faults and its general shunning by people, is important in establishing the series and its key themes which makes its omission unfair in my eyes. It doesn't look the same, it doesn't sound the same, it isn't as funny, and really, it isn't good, but this last point is more a testament to the episodes that would come later rather than any mark against S1 specifically.\n\nS2 carries on and there is a marked improvement and development in everything. Looks, sound, comedy, feels, everything. If you look through the list of S2 episodes, you couldn't find any ones you could say you don't like. Go on. Try it if you don't believe me. In those there are various things that happen, several of which can all be brought back to some of the key themes of the series. Specifically the strength of the family overall as well as all the individual relationships, down to the individuals themselves. I think S2 overall holds up a lot better than people might assume, the episodes themselves are all good, some definitely are great. I think overall the main difference between S1 and S2 is the confidence that the writers had in the sort of topics they could cover and just the things they could make episodes about, which can see them cover everything from political campaigns to Lisa's Subsitute to artistic expression and decency to three ten year olds fighting over a comic book. It still doesn't look like what we know The Simpsons to look as, but the difference between S1 and S2 visually is vast, and really, I don't think the difference visually between the start and when it became really 'Simpsons' is all that important, honestly. The show is still there, and the show still works, so it's still good for me. Again, the overall development of the first series before the widely accepted 'peak' is too important to the series as a whole to be disregarded.\n\nS3 is when the show starts to come into its own from a comedic point of view, and importantly, it keeps the strong emotional and moral ties as a base. I also think that largely by this point the look and sound and feel of the show is 'right,' so all I can do at this point is repeat that the development of the show as a whole through S1/2/3 is important enough for it to remain part of what can truly be defined as \"Good Simpsons.\"\n\nNow that the beginning of the series is justified, we go on to the rest. Indeed, the point of the thread, the title of the thread. I know answers to the title will vary wildly, will range S5-S13, will be vastly different specifically as well, but, my view of when The Simpsons went bad is slightly skewed. Prior to getting the full S1-S11 on DVD I had several tapes of Simpsons episodes based around various themes, and they ranged from S2 to I think S11. Part of this is the reason I love Bart's Friend Falls in Love so much, it was the only episode of S3 I had never seen before, and the opening Indiana Jones parody was too good to not love. Any way, the tapes I mentioned mean that some episodes that are flat out bad were to me, fine. They were \"part\" of The Simpsons. Ones that spring to mind that I mean, the one where Homer becomes a food critic, the one with Mel Gibson, the one with Homer and Ned's Vegas wives, to me, now, they're all bad. Previously though, I wasn't able to fully appreciate and acknowledge the actual series timeline and know when it turned. I was also of less discriminating taste, you could argue, I suppose.\n\nAnyway, I believe that the beginning of the downfall of The Simpsons came in S7, began to taper down during S9 and was officially irredeemable beyond that. The S7 point is based around three specific episodes. The episodes in themselves are good, the other episodes of S7 are good, but there are elements of these which typify why The Simpsons became bad television. Happily, the episodes all come one after the other (Halloween episode aside), as it to truly ram home how poor they are.\n\nLisa the Vegetarian. In what came to define \"Lisa episode\" as a borderline slur, Lisa picks up a liberal cause, decides to dedicate herself to it and shows absolutely no consideration for anyone else in her family in the process. It's then capped off with a celebrity cameo that serves no purpose other than \"hello, I am *this person* and I do *this thing* and this makes me good.\"\n\nKing-Size Homer. In the DVD commentaries, one of the things the writers mentioned about Homer and his intelligence was that they never wanted to make him too stupid to sign his own name. Now, I think this point actually happens at some point later, but in this episode, we see an idiotic scheme. We see Homer's laziness conspiring to make him ruin his life in an out of proportion fashion, despite the concerns of his family. The episode then ends with an insane, improbably set-piece, before everything is made alright in the closing line.\n\nMother Simpson. For a show that was so good at emotional depth to go with various zany methods of commentary, Mother Simpson is, to me, in a word, insincere. It's false. It's tacky. It's overdone. There's about one mention of Homer's mother overall prior to this, then all of a sudden she shows up, spends ten minutes making everyone love her, then disappears. I don't believe this episode. It doesn't sit right with me. The emotional manipulation calls on no previous relationship that's been established in the show which I think is what makes it so hard for me to swallow.\n\nNow, how many of those episodes have there been since this that can follow \"Lisa is annoying\" / \"Homer is annoyingly/dangerously dumb\" / \"sudden emotional manipulation that goes as quickly as it comes\" ? For me, these three episodes sum up everything about what The Simpsons became that is so bad. They are so directly contradictory to what made The Simpsons great and so eerily predictive of what would come to define it beyond this point that I can see no other point. As I say, they're not bad themselves, there's many good episodes beyond that, but there's just something about them that makes me unable to accept them for anything beyond what triggered the downfall of something that was once so good.\n\nBeyond this, it varies. S8 is almost completely good (The Simpsons Spin-Off showcase is dreadful, and a few episodes are shaky), S9 is when notably bas episodes creep in. Specifically in S9 I'd split it up as:\n\nGood: The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson (one removed from my consciousness largely but a solid enough episode), The Principal and the Pauper (I know, I know, but it never struck me as offensively bad as some episodes), The Cartridge Family (Homer is dumb, but it's funny and a good ending), Bart Star (Homer is dumb, but it's funny), Lisa the Skeptic (maybe because I side with Lisa in her Lisa-ness), Bart Carny (classic), The Joy of Sect (classic), Das Bus (classic), Lisa the Simpson (it's a bit dumb, but it's nice), Girly Edition (it seems a bit vacant again, but it's funny).\n\nBad: Lisa's Sax (over-emotional), Apu gets married (it's over-focusing on a secondary character, it's stupid, it's funny, but it sets up them having eight kids later), Realty Bites (introduces Gil, seems... vacant), Miracle on Evergreen Terrace (did the Bart ruins Christmas but comes round thing better before), All Singing All Dancing (uhhh), The Last Temptation of Krust (meh), Dumbbell Indemnity (any attempt to give Moe a girlfriend is bad), This Little Wiggy (nobody likes Ralph as a focus), Simpson Tide (stupid homer, stupider ending), The Trouble with Trillions (stupid), Trash of the Titans (one of those ones on tape that I thought was okay, but is stupid and bad), King of the Hill (you already did Homer going up a mountain, and did it better), Lost Our Lisa (yes, Homer doesn't get Lisa and then does, yawn), Natural Born Kissers (dumb, unfunny, has Gil).\n\nSo, I think I've covered everything I want to cover. I've set out my points and if anyone actually wants to read all of this, I'm sure some points will be picked apart. I should add that that beyond S9 the show became irretrievably horrific and worthless that there's nothing else to really discuss on my part, but I've got my stuff across. The first two series are important, that S7 triumvirate was the beginning of the end, and S9 was definitively when the downfall was irreversible."
