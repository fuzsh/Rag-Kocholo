        "text": "The following is a list of Nintendo GameCube games that natively support progressive scan (480p), PAL60, and widescreen (16:9) display modes. The GameCube's 480p signal, which is the highest quality video it can provide, is only natively supported by certain NTSC region games and can only be utilized if specific hardware is provided. For PAL region games, the default video output is normally 576i (50Hz) while some games provide an option to use PAL60 (480i/60Hz). Widescreen mode is not supported often across the GameCube's library, but can be used on any hardware setup regardless of region.\n\nTo get a 480p signal from a GameCube console, it is first necessary to use a DOL-001 model system, as these are equipped with a digital A/V port. This port was removed with the DOL-101 revision of the GameCube hardware in May 2004 because Nintendo found that less than one percent of players were using the port.[1] Furthermore, a component (YPbPr) video cable, or modern alternative such as a Carby or EON GCHD product, and supporting television are required.[2] Since the cables only carry a video signal, standard A/V cables are still necessary for audio. First generation Wii systems (RVL-001) are also capable of outputting 480p video for compatible GameCube games if component cables are used and the system is set to 480p mode.\n\nIn order to enable progressive scan mode, or the B button must be held down as a compatible game boots. This will display a prompt giving the player the option to turn progressive scan on or off. The next time a progressive scan compatible game is played, it is not necessary to hold down the B button as the system remembers this setting and will automatically display the prompt. Selecting \"no\" at this prompt will turn the setting off at the system level, and it will need to be enabled again. This procedure is identical to enabling PAL60 for those games which support it. Games that do not have progressive scan support will not display the prompt, but can still be played with component cables, although in 480i. Progressive scan compatible games played on a Wii console set to 480p mode with component cables will always automatically display the prompt.\n\nDespite all DOL-001 GameCube and RVL-001 Wii systems supporting progressive scan regardless of their region, only around 200 NTSC games will natively support the display mode. All games in PAL regions were intentionally programmed with the mode disabled; however, a select few can output 480p by forcing an NTSC signal with either a modchip, boot disk, or the homebrew application Swiss. These methods can also be used to bypass regional lockout, allowing NTSC games that support progressive scan to be played on PAL systems. Although it is possible to force 480p or widescreen on any game, compatibility is not guaranteed, with many games having visual issues, only partially working or crashing completely. See the Swiss Forced Progressive Compatibility List for more information.\n\nThis page was deleted from Wikipedia on October 31st, 2018.\n\nHeader Description NTSC 480p NTSC region releases.

However, there are two games for the Gamecube which instead run by default at the equivalent 240p, the progressive scan version of the 15khz 480i signal. Both of these are compilation discs of classic games running at their original resolutions, as 240p was the resolution used by most game consoles in the 80s/90s.\n\nThis is important to know because not all modern displays actually support 240p, even those which do support the interlaced 480i form. Many modern flatscreens will either be completely unable to display a 240p image or will incorrectly apply deinterlacing to it, causing graphical glitches and reduced picture quality. A helpful list of the 240p-over-component compatibility of newer TV models, and a guide to testing the 240p compatibility of your own TV, can be found here.\n\nThe two Gamecube titles which use a 240p resolution are the entirety of the Mega Man X Collection, and the two original NES Zelda games on The Legend of Zelda Collector's Edition disc. The Mega Man X Collection runs only at 240p and cannot be played at any other resolution unless using a mod like Swiss to force alternate display modes, which may or may not cause gameplay issues. The Zelda Collector's Edition however does support a 480p display mode, so if using component cables it is possible to play the two NES titles on the disc at 480p instead. Note that the PAL versions of these games also run in true 240p, not the 50hz equivalent 288p or 576i, which may cause further incompatibility issues with PAL TVs."
