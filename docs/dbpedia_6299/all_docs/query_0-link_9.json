        "text": "Mine doesn't.\n\nIf you feed the 'original' resolution from the Humax into my plasma via HDMI there is no option anywhere in the TV's settings that i can change or upscale the resolution. It tells me on screen that it is still 576i (or 1080i if i was watching BBCHD). The same with my AV amp. Both units are new. But i do have options to upscale to various resolutions if i used a component input (RGB). Whether there is a difference of options in resolution settings in HD LCD TVs and Plasmas, i don't know as this is my first HD TV. But definitely cannot upscale via HDMI.\n\nPanasonic TH-42PZ81B\n\nYamaha RX-V1900\n\nHumax Foxsat HDR\n\n0\n\nOk. So how do i know what resolution it has upscaled the picture to? And why do i not get a choice of resolution, i.e 576p, 720p, 1080i, 1080p like i do with Component?\n\nIf your TV has 1080 lines then it scales to 1080p. If it has 768 lines then it scales to 768p. It's not like a CRT TV, the pixel count is fixed so it has to scale if the input is not in the TV's native resolution.\n\nInputs can be 576i, 720i, 720p, 1080i, 1080p etc depending on what you set the external box to.\n\nBroadcast resolutions are fixed at 576i for SD and 1080i for HD. Ideally, the input resolution should match the TV's native resolution, however the input resolution can vary whereas the TV resolution is fixed, so some scaling must be done somewhere.\n\nIf you set the external box to 576i then it will transfer SD broadcasts untouched but scale HD broadcasts down. In either case the TV will then upscale the incoming 576i to 1080. This would only be sensible if you've not got HD and the TV has a better scaler than the external box, but you might as well use Original - see below.\n\nIf you set the external box to 1080i then it will transfer HD broadcasts untouched but the box will scale SD broadcasts from 576i to 1080i. This is the best option if the external box has a better scaler than the TV.\n\nIf you set the external box to original, it will transfer all broadcasts untouched. The TV will then upscale 576i to 1080 but will not need to do anything for HD. This is the best option if the TV has a better scaler than the external box.\n\n0\n\nAm i missing something here?!!\n\nIf the TV upscales the picture from 576i to 1080i, why isn't the text and graphics (from the Menu, Guide, information, List, etc) getting upscaled too?\n\nIf your LCD PC monitor has a native resolution of 1280x1024 and you've got your graphics card set at that resolution, try changing your graphics card to 800x600 instead and see if the text looks as sharp. The same thing is happening to the actual broadcast picture - anything that's scaled will suffer.\n\nIf you are watching an SD broadcast at 576i and you set the box to Original, the box will output at 576i and generate its menus at 576i, and the TV will be scaling both the picture and the menus to 1080 and both will suffer.\n\nIf you set the box to 1080i, the box is scaling an SD picture to 1080i (and leaving HD alone) and generating its menus at 1080. The TV won't have to do anything (except de-interlace). However, the SD picture suffers cos the box is upscaling it, but the menus are as sharp as they can be because the box is generating them at 1080 in the first place, not 576 and then upscaling.\n\n0\n\nWhen the humax is setup the resolution is set and original is not an option.\n\nWhen you can scroll through the v settings (on the remote)from what I have read in these posts am I right to assume:\n\n1 that original is not the setting you put in during the initial installation?\n\n2 It is generally the best to leave as the default?\n\nThanks\n\n0\n\nWhen the humax is setup the resolution is set and original is not an option.\n\nWhen you can scroll through the v settings (on the remote)from what I have read in these posts am I right to assume:\n\n1 that original is not the setting you put in during the initial installation?\n\n2 It is generally the best to leave as the default?\n\nThanks\n\nOriginal is the resolution that the programme was broadcast at - 576i for SD, 1080i for HD.\n\nWhatever looks best to you is best. Picture quality is subjective and results with different settings vary with different TVs. If you can't see enough difference to bother you, or if you can't make up your mind which you prefer, 1080i is arguably better. It gives smoother transitions when switching between SD and HD channels, and will display the HDR's graphics and inset pictures when using the red button at a higher resolution.\n\n0"
