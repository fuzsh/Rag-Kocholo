Amiberry has been designed to have compatibility with the 'Retroplay' WHDLoad packs. For more information on WHDLoad packages, see here.\n\nAccepted File Extensions: .lha\n\nPlace your WHDLoad packages in\n\nMore information on adding game data can be found here.\n\nBIOS\n\nFull documentation on the Kickstart ROMs required by Amiberry can be found here. Place the Kickstart ROMs in\n\nControls\n\nAmiberry makes use the RetroArch configs created during Controller Configuration. Consequently, Hotkey+X will bring up the UI and Hotkey+Start can be used to exit Amiberry. For full documentation, please refer here.\n\nDefault controller choice can be edited in /opt/retropie/configs/amiga/amiberry/whdboot/hostprefs.conf. It is also possible to set the default controller choice as well as other Amiberry settings for individual games.

For full documentation, please refer here.\n\nEmulator: lr-puae/lr-puae2021\n\nThe lr-puae is libretro Amiga core based on WinUAE. There are 2 versions available:\n\nlr-puae2021 (version 2.6.1) is recommended for low-power devices (Raspberry PI or other ARM based systems).\n\nlr-puae (version 4.5.0) is a more accurate and performance demanding version, recommended for x86/PC systems.\n\nBoth versions can be installed from the optional section of the RetroPie-Setup Script.\n\nBIOS\n\nPlace your desired Kickstart ROMs in:\n\nTo use disk and WHDLoad games with this core you'll need the following Kickstart ROMs. Rename them to the given name and copy the file in the BIOS folder.\n\nIt is critical to use Kickstarts with the right MD5, otherwise the core might not start.\n\nFilename Description Amiga Forever name System MD5 checksum kick33180.A500 Kickstart v1.2 rev 33.180 (!) amiga-os-120.rom Amiga 500 85ad74194e87c08904327de1a9443b7a kick34005.A500 Kickstart v1.3 rev 34.005 amiga-os-130.rom Amiga 500 82a21c1890cae844b3df741f2762d48d kick37175.A500 Kickstart v2.04 rev 37.175 amiga-os-204.rom Amiga 500+ dc10d7bdd1b6f450773dfb558477c230 kick40063.A600 Kickstart v3.1 rev 40.063 amiga-os-310-a600.rom Amiga 600 e40a5dfb3d017ba8779faba30cbd1c8e kick40068.A1200 Kickstart v3.1 rev 40.068 amiga-os-310-a1200.rom Amiga 1200 646773759326fbac3b2311fd8c8793ee kick40068.A4000 Kickstart v3.1 rev 40.068 amiga-os-310-a4000.rom Amiga 4000 9bdedde6a4f33555b4a270c8ca53297d kick34005.CDTV CDTV extended ROM v1.00 amiga-os-130-cdtv-ext.rom Amiga CDTV 89da1838a24460e4b93f4f0c5d92d48d kick40060.CD32 CD32 Kickstart v3.1 rev 40.060 N/A Amiga CD32 5f8924d013dd57a89cf349f4cdedc6b1 kick40060.CD32.ext CD32 extended ROM rev 40.060 amiga-os-310-cd32.rom Amiga CD32 bb72565701b1b6faece07d68ea5da639 kick40060.CD32 CD32 KS + extended v3.1 rev 40.060 amiga-os-310-cd32.rom Amiga CD32 f2f241bf094168cfb9e7805dc2856433\n\nNote: - The core has a built-in AROS fallback Kickstart, which is used when the real Kickstart is not found. It can be compatible enough for some A500 games. - Kickstart v1.2 (1) is only needed for WHDLoad Arcadia games - For CD32 emulation, either kick40060.CD32(CD32 KS + extended v3.1 rev 40.060) or both kick40060.CD32(CD32 Kickstart v3.1 rev 40.060) and kick40060.CD32.ext(CD32 extended ROM rev 40.060)\n\nControls\n\nPUAE uses Retroarch input configurations.\n\nAdd custom RetroArch controls to the retroarch.cfg file in\n\nFor more information on custom RetroArch controls see: RetroArch Configuration.\n\nDefault Controls\n\nRetroPad button Action D-Pad Move B Keypress A Toggle transparency Y Toggle CapsLock Y (Long) Quick map button Y (Very long) Quick clear button X Press Space Start Press Return\n\nKeyboard key.

Stickying the third key will replace the second.\n\nJoyport control\n\nSome games use mouse instead of joystick. D-Pad can be switched between joystick and mouse control in several ways:\n\nUse the core option: Quick Menu -> Options -> RetroPad Joystick/Mouse\n\nBring up the virtual keyboard with Select button, then press the key labeled J/M\n\nPress the default keyboard shortcut - Right Control\n\nAssign Switch Joystick/Mouse to any RetroPad button under Quick Menu -> Options\n\nCore configuration\n\nThe PUAE core has a comprehesive set of configuration options which control the emulation experience. A comprehensive list can be found here.\n\nModel selection\n\nYou can force a specific model if a game needs one (AGA games for instance) either by the \"Model\" core option or by file path tags.\n\nThe \"Model\" core option at \"Automatic\" will default to A500 when booting floppy disks, A600 when booting hard drives, and CD32 when booting CD images.\n\nThe whole path (filename and directory) will be searched for the following tags if the model is \"Automatic\":\n\nFloppy HD/LHA CD String/Tag Result x x (A500OG), (512K) Amiga 500 (0.5MB Chip RAM) x x (A500), OCS Amiga 500 (0.5MB Chip RAM + 0.5MB Slow RAM) x x (A500+), (A500PLUS) Amiga 500+ (1MB Chip RAM) x x (A600), ECS Amiga 600 (2MB Chip RAM + 8MB Fast RAM) x x (A1200OG), (A1200NF) Amiga 1200 (2MB Chip RAM) x x (A1200), AGA, CD32, AmigaCD Amiga 1200 (2MB Chip RAM + 8MB Fast RAM) x x (A4030), (030) Amiga 4000/030 (2MB Chip RAM + 8MB Fast RAM) x x (A4040), (040) Amiga 4000/040 (2MB Chip RAM + 8MB Fast RAM) x CDTV Amiga CDTV (1MB Chip RAM) x (CD32), (CD32NF) Amiga CD32 (2MB Chip RAM) x (CD32FR), FastRAM Amiga CD32 (2MB Chip RAM + 8MB Fast RAM) x x x NTSC, (USA) NTSC 60Hz x x x PAL, (Europe) (!)

Maximum 4 disks\n\nExample: When launching \"Alien Breed 2 AGA.hdf\" or \"AGA/Alien Breed 2.hdf\" the model will be Amiga 1200.\n\nROMS\n\nPlace your Amiga ROMs and configuration files in\n\nContent that can be loaded by lr-puae has the following file extensions:\n\nFloppy images\n\n.adf\n\n.adz\n\n.dms\n\n.fdi\n\n.ipf\n\nHard drives\n\n.hdf\n\n.hdz\n\ndirectory\n\nWHDLoad\n\n.lha\n\n.slave\n\n.info\n\nCompact discs\n\n.cue\n\n.ccd\n\n.nrg\n\n.mds\n\n.iso\n\nOther\n\n.uae\n\n.m3u\n\n.zip\n\nOne thing that Amiga enthusiasts seem to point out repeatedly is that although you may be able to expand an .lha file on Windows, you often shouldn't; the Amiga operating system and Windows don't always agree on paths and special characters, with the result that you can corrupt the file when unzipping it.\n\nDisk images\n\nYou can pass a disk or hdd image (WHDLoad) as a rom.\n\nSupported formats are :\n\n.adf, .adz, .dms, .fdi, .ipf for disk images.\n\n.hdf, .hdz, .lha for hdd images.\n\n.cue, .iso, .ccd, .nrg, .mds for compact disc images\n\nWhen passing a disk image, a hdd image or a M3U file as parameter, the core will generate a temporary puae_libretro.uae configuration file in RetroArch saves directory (the amiga rom folder) and use it to automatically launch the game.\n\nM3U Support\n\nWhen you have a multi disk game, you can use an .m3u file to specify each disk of the game and change them from the RetroArch Disc Control interface.\n\nAn M3U file is a simple text file with one disk per line (see Wiki).\n\nAn example M3U file:\n\nSimpsons, The - Bart vs. The Space Mutants.m3u\n\ncontaining\n\nPath in the M3U file can be absolute or relative to the location of the M3U file.\n\nWhen a game asks for it, you can change the current disk in the RetroArch Disc Control menu:\n\nEject the current disk with Eject Disc\n\nSelect the right disk index with Current Disc Index\n\nInsert the new disk with Insert Disc\n\nFor games that support multiple disk drives, append \"(MD)\" (as in \"MultiDrive\") to the M3U filename to insert each disk in different drives, up to a maximum of 4 disks.\n\nFor games that require a dedicated save disk, one may be generated automatically by entering the following line in an M3U file: #SAVEDISK:VolumeName. VolumeName is optional and may be omitted. For example, this will create a blank, unlabelled disk image at disk index 5:\n\nSecret of Monkey Island.m3u\n\nBy default, RetroArch will display the filename (without extension) of each M3U entry when selecting a disk via the Current Disc Index drop-down menu. Custom display labels may be set for each disk using the following syntax in the .m3u playlist file: DISK_FILE|DISK_LABEL.\n\nFor example:\n\nM3U Playlist Retroarch Disc control drop-down Valhalla & the Fortress of Eve_Disk1.adf|Game Disk 1: Game Disk Valhalla & the Fortress of Eve_Disk2.adf|Data Disk 2: Data Disk Valhalla & the Fortress of Eve_Disk3.adf|Level 1 Disk 3:Level 1 Disk Valhalla & the Fortress of Eve_Disk4.adf|Level 2 Disk 4:Level 2 Diskisk Valhalla & the Fortress of Eve_Disk5.adf|Level 3 Disk 5:Level 3 Diskisk Valhalla & the Fortress of Eve_Disk6.adf|Level 4 Disk 6:Level 4 Diskisk\n\nWHDLoad Disc Images\n\nPre-installed WHDLoad LHA archives can be launched directly, there is no need for any kind of manual preparing and downloading.\n\nWHDLoad helper files (Directory or HDF) will be generated to the save folder (ROM folder), WHDLoad.prefs will be generated to the BIOS folder.\n\nWHDLoad.prefs & WHDLoad.key will be copied from the BIOS (system) folder to the helper image\n\nKickstarts will be copied automatically to the helper image\n\nTo update WHDLoad: simply delete the directory or the HDF file\n\nZip Archives Support\n\nZIP archives will be extracted to a temporary directory in saves, bypassing the default frontend extraction.The temporary directory will be removed on exit.\n\nThis allows:\n\nAutomatic M3U playlist generation of all floppy disks\n\nThe use of zipped images in M3Us\n\nHard drive and CD images will be treated one by one and only the first file found is selected for launch\n\nIf no disk/drive images are found, the ZIP will be treated as a directory\n\nIPF Support\n\nIPF support is done through the CAPSIMG library. To enable it, you have to put the dynamic library called capsimg.so (Linux) in RetroArch system directory (/home/pi/RetroPie/BIOS).\n\nCompatible CAPSIMG libraries for Windows, macOS and Linux can be found at http://www.softpres.org/download and https://fs-uae.net/download#plugins.\n\nIf you cannot find CAPSIMG library for your CPU architecture, you can always build capsimg.so from the source which is available at https://github.com/FrodeSolheim/capsimg.\n\nFloppy drive sounds\n\nThe core has embedded internal floppy drive samples. External sound samples have to be copied from https://github.com/libretro/libretro-uae/tree/master/sources/uae_data into a directory named uae_data or uae in RetroArch system directory (/home/pi/RetroPie/BIOS).\n\nResolution and rendering\n\nThe following core options control the output resolution of the core (defaults are bolded):\n\nName Values Video Standard PAL 50Hz, NTSC 60Hz Video Resolution Automatic, Low, High, Super-High Video Line Mode Automatic, Single Line, Double Line Aspect Ratio Automatic, PAL, NTSC\n\nWith these settings all the standard resolutions are available:\n\nPAL 50Hz Resolution Description 360x288 Lores 720x288 Hires Single Line 720x576 Hires Double Line 1440x288 SuperHires Single Line 1440x576 SuperHires Double Line\n\nNTSC 60Hz Resolution Description 360x240 Lores 720x240 Hires Single Line 720x480 Hires Double Line 1440x240 SuperHires Single Line 1440x480 SuperHires Double Line\n\nWhen using low resolution mode, rendering will be halved horizontally and forced into \"Single Line\" mode. Scaling shaders looks great, but high resolution games and Workbench are badly rendered.\n\nWhen using high resolution \"Double Line\" mode, rendering will be doubled vertically. It is compatible with high resolution games and Workbench, but scaling shaders will look ugly. \"Double Line\" shows interlaced fields separately (weave) and is suited for de-interlacing shaders.\n\nWhen using high resolution \"Single Line\" mode, rendering is presented as is. It delivers the best of both worlds, and looks great with high resolution games, Workbench and shaders. \"Single Line\" combines interlaced fields into one field (bob), which will make high resolution images blocky and jittery.\n\nAutomatic \"Resolution\" defaults to \"Hires\" and selects \"SuperHires\" when needed (practically only in Workbench and Super Skidmarks)\n\nAutomatic \"Line Mode\" defaults to \"Single Line\" and selects \"Double Line\" on interlaced screens\n\nEmulators: UAE4ALL2, UAE4ARM\n\nUAE4ALL2 is no longer developed and we recommend using UAE4ARM on the Raspberry Pi.\n\nROMS\n\nAccepted File Extensions: .adf\n\nUAE4Arm also supports: .dms .exe .rp9 and compressed formats .zip .adz\n\nPlace your Amiga disks images in\n\nBIOS\n\nThe emulator comes with a free AROS rom that will work for running many games and demos.\n\nIf you want to use a kickstart 1.3, 2.0, 3.1 rom place your kick13.rom, kick20.rom, kick31.rom files in\n\nName Description md5 CRC32 Comment kick13.rom KS ROM v1.3 (A500,A1000,A2000) rev 34.5 (256k) 82a21c1890cae844b3df741f2762d48d c4f0f55f kick20.rom KS ROM v2.04 (A500+) rev 37.175 (512k) dc10d7bdd1b6f450773dfb558477c230 c3bdb240 kick31.rom KS ROM v1.3 (A1200) rev 40.68 (512k) 646773759326fbac3b2311fd8c8793ee 1483a091\n\nControls\n\nThese are hardcoded currently. This initial mapping was chosen as it's somewhat similar to MAME, and should mostly work on any controllers that use that input mapping (such as the picade). Joypad/Joystick is currently untested.\n\nin game:\n\nLaunch it from Emulation Station, and you get the GUI where you can configure disks/roms/memory and insert adf images into the virtual floppy disk drives.\n\nVideo Tutorial\n\nLaunching games directly from EmulationStation\n\nScript for creating configuration files\n\nHere you will find a script, and the necessary configuration files according to different version of UAE4arm, for creating game configuration file:\n\nhttp://www.retropie-italia.it/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=16\n\nOn EmulationStation, AMIGA, open \"+Start UAE4Arm\" and save a profile with random name then open the file and check the number in the parameter \"config_version\". Download the correct configuration file from previous link then rename it in \"config.uae\" and copy it, together with \"AGCC.sh\" (also download this from previous link), on Raspberry Pi. AGCC.sh uses the \"config.uae\" file in order to create games configuration and (if you want) you can edit it. For default behavior emulator is searching for kickstart 2.04 in\n\n/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/amiga/\n\nrenamed in \"kick20.rom\", so you have to rename your kickstart or edit \"config.uae\".\n\nAlso follow these steps:\n\nsudo nano /etc/emulationstation/es_systems.cfg\n\nand edit the tag for \"amiga\" emulator in this way:\n\n<extension>.sh .uae .SH .UAE</extension>\n\nThen sudo nano /opt/retropie/configs/amiga/emulators.cfg\n\nand edit the line in this way:\n\nuae4arm = \"pushd /opt/retropie/emulators/uae4arm/; ./uae4arm -f %ROM%\"\n\nPoint attention to the floppy image extension (case-insensitive): .adf, .adz, .dms, .ipf, .zip\n\nFor game with multiple disks rename them in this way:\n\nGame bla bla bla (Disk 1 of N).adf\n\nGame bla bla bla (Disk 2 of N).adf\n\n...\n\nGame bla bla bla (Disk N of N).adf\n\nin other words change ONLY the floppy identifier.\n\nNote: The old script from Mark Dunning has a problem with games with more than 9 floppies (creates others wrong config files) and creates a config file with name like \"Game bla bla bla (Disk 1 of N).uae\". This new app create only 1 file for a multiple disk game with the exact name of the game, \"Game bla bla bla.uae\"\n\nOther solution\n\nAlternatively, a native BASH script to perform the same steps directly on the RetroPie machine can be found here: https://github.com/Douggernaut/RetroPieAssistant/tree/master/Amiga\n\nTips and troubleshooting\n\nStuttering? Amiga systems/games are PAL (50Hz), but modern TVs typically default to a 60Hz mode when connected to a Raspberry Pi. Enter the RunCommand menu for your Amiga emulator, and select a valid mode that uses a 50Hz refresh rate in order to match the original PAL rate, and thus, eliminate stuttering.\n\nSome games work better with the '512Kb Chip' + '512Kb Slow' memory configuration rather than the default A500 '1MB Chip'. If your game crashes or fails to load, change the memory settings in the 'CPU RAM' tab of the UAE4ALL2 GUI.\n\nSome games do not work properly if more than one floppy drive is in use. If your game crashes or fails to load try to use just DF0 (change disc image during game if required) and not use DF1, DF2 and DF3."
