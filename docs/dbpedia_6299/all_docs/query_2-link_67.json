        "text": "Overview\n\nThis repository contains U.S. topographic data gathered by many groups using a variety of lidar sensors. Using the custom download for up to 1.5 billion points, users may search and select output by year, area, data provider, elevation product, projection, datum, and format. Output types include point clouds, digital elevation models, and contours. Requests are submitted to an automated system for custom processing, and a URL link is emailed to the user upon completion. For larger requests, such as full counties, the point cloud is available in LAZ format and geographic coordinates via a bulk download link. Data sets with “DEM” in the name will have a bulk download link to the data in their original projection and tiling.\n\nFeatured Resources\n\nLAStools — A collection of free lidar processing tools.\n\nGeoZone Blog — Blog posts about elevation data.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nLimitations and Notes\n\nLidar data arrive in various forms, which are standardized for storage purposes by format, datum, and projection. Some data are further processed to generate bare-earth products. Errors are removed when possible. Coverage varies from location to location—some areas have multiple years while others have none. Users should not use the data for critical applications without a full awareness of their limitations. NOAA reviews these data but does not guarantee reported vertical or horizontal accuracies. Survey reports are linked in the metadata where they exist."
