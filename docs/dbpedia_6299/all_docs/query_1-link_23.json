I meant the publishers didn't care. They knew a PAL version was needed right from the start, it's not like they HAD to just make an NTSC version and convert it. But it was the cheaper faster route and resulted in some shockingly poor versions of great games.\n\npinbi7\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nApr 4, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n625\n\nTrophies\n\n2\n\nXP\n\n2,228\n\nCountry\n\nJun 30, 2022\n\n#13\n\nIs there even a way to output 576p?\n\nVideo formatDisplay aspect ratio (DAR)Resolution576i4:3704 × 576 (horizontal blanking cropped)720 × 576 (full frame)576i16:9704 × 576 (horizontal blanking cropped)720 × 576 (full frame)\n\nMarc_LFD\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nNov 3, 2021\n\nMessages\n\n6,126\n\nTrophies\n\n1\n\nAge\n\n34\n\nXP\n\n9,916\n\nCountry\n\nJun 30, 2022\n\n#14\n\nVideo formatDisplay aspect ratio (DAR)Resolution576i4:3704 × 576 (horizontal blanking cropped)720 × 576 (full frame)576i16:9704 × 576 (horizontal blanking cropped)720 × 576 (full frame)\n\nI know it's 4:3, but if people look at it, it doesn't actually look 4:3.

It's why games often filled the space with black bars instead.\n\nReactions: Marc_LFD\n\npinbi7\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nApr 4, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n625\n\nTrophies\n\n2\n\nXP\n\n2,228\n\nCountry\n\nJun 30, 2022\n\n#16\n\nI know it's 4:3, but if people look at it, it doesn't actually look 4:3. It seems to be thinner and taller than 4:3.\n\nPixel aspect ratio​\n\nThe table below summarizes pixel aspect ratios for the scaling of various kinds of SDTV video lines.\n\nVideo formatDisplay aspect ratio (DAR)ResolutionPixel aspect ratio (PAR)After horizontal scaling480i4:3704 × 480 (horizontal blanking cropped)10:11640 × 480720 × 480 (full frame)655 × 480480i16:9704 × 480 (horizontal blanking cropped)40:33854 × 480720 × 480 (full frame)873 × 480576i4:3704 × 576 (horizontal blanking cropped)12:11768 × 576720 × 576 (full frame)788 × 576576i16:9704 × 576 (horizontal blanking cropped)16:111024 × 576720 × 576 (full frame)1050 × 576\n\nit's because they might share the DAR but the PAR is way off\n\nReactions: Marc_LFD\n\nN7Kopper\n\nLest we forget... what Nazi stood for.\n\nJoined\n\nAug 24, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n1,034\n\nTrophies\n\n0\n\nAge\n\n31\n\nXP\n\n1,369\n\nCountry\n\nJun 30, 2022\n\n#17\n\nIt's a complex topic to break down technically, so I'll keep it simple, stupid.\n\n60hz is better for games developed with 60hz in mind. (This is most of them, but there are standout exceptions - Sonic 3D Blast for example has a bad reputation for being too fast, but it's actually a bad 60hz conversion to blame.)\n\n50hz is better for games developed with 50hz in mind, TV and films. (3:2 pulldown is, to be completely blunt, AIDS.)\n\nAs a side note, I think it's kinda cute when I play 24hz Blu-Rays on my Xbox One, and the menu has to run at 24 FPS rather than 60.\n\nReactions: Tarmfot\n\nflo\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nNov 2, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n319\n\nTrophies\n\n1\n\nWebsite\n\nVisit site\n\nXP\n\n708\n\nCountry\n\nJun 30, 2022\n\n#18\n\nOn a CRT you couldn't notice much difference between PAL and NTSC resolution but on modern displays PAL looks slightly better, even with black borders. Also, the refresh rate is not so relevant anymore on LCDs. Regarding the speed, some games seem too fast for me and it's almost a \" hack \" to use the PAL version to slow it down a bit .\n\nMarc_LFD\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nNov 3, 2021\n\nMessages\n\n6,126\n\nTrophies\n\n1\n\nAge\n\n34\n\nXP\n\n9,916\n\nCountry\n\nJun 30, 2022\n\n#19\n\nOn a CRT you couldn't notice much difference between PAL and NTSC resolution but on modern displays PAL looks slightly better, even with black borders.
