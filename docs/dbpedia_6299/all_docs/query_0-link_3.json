        "text": "On my LG HD digital set top box there is a button that changes between 1080, 720, 570p and 576i.\n\nMy tv is a nec LCD HD tv that when I rang them am told has a native resolution of 1366x768.\n\nNow I understand TV stations broadcast different formats of HD material (im in Sydney, Australia) so am I meant to physically change the set top box each time I change channel to match what the station is broadcasting to pass the correct signal to the tv?? If so how the heck am I meant to know what signal is coming in?\n\nIf not what is the switch for? And why would they make a TV that has a native resolution (i am told they look best with a signal that matches the native resolution) that is neither 1080, 720 or 576??? What format is going to output 1366x768? I am a novice but it seems odd to me not to make the display fit the used resolutions.\n\nI ask all this because I have not seen 1 iota of difference on any program ever between HD and SD broadcasts. They look 100% identical (this also happens on 2 different tvs at my inlaws (LG plasma and samsung LCD), cannot see any difference.\n\nSo either I dont have these things set up correctly, the tv stations are not actually using HD or there is not really a difference between HD and SD to the average Joe.\n\n*edit: I hook up my HD set top box to my TV via DVI cable and the antenna signal comes via standard coax to the HD STB.\n\nIf 576p it won't make much difference. It will have a faster frame rate 50Hz vs. 25Hz.\n\nNormal 576i/25 would need deinterlacing to 576p/50 in the tuner box. If the channel broadcasts 576p/50 directly, the quality will be better but not HDTV. We call 480p/59.94 \"EDTV\" here.\n\nLook for 720p or 1080i broadcasts if you want to see HDTV.\n\nHere Lost is broadcast 720p, CSI 1080i.\n\nThe antenna will only affect reception or no reception.\n\nPS: 576p/50 and 720p/50 have a great advantage for live sports but for film source like Lost or CSI, there is little improvement."
