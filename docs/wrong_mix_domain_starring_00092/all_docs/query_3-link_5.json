In a statement posted in X - formerly known as Twitter - he explained: \"As most have come to know, I am a pretty quiet and private person. However, this past year has been an exceptionally challenging time for my family, and I have decided to share what's been going on.\n\n\"Last December, my wife, Bridgette, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Since then, she has had major surgery, pushed through chemotherapy and continues with targeted maintenance therapy.\"\n\nHe added: \"It is hard to watch someone you love go through a challenge like this. However, seeing our boys step up and be such strong supporters of Bridgette, myself and each other has been amazing,\" he said, referring to sons Christian, 20, and Ryan, 18. Watching Bridgette continue to be an incredible mom and wife through it all has been inspiring.\"\n\nPete concluded by sharing: \"I have also learned that it is very hard to reach for support when something is simply too hard to talk about. With that said, I am humbling asking for good thoughts and prayers for our family as Bridgette continues to thrive on her healing journey.\"\n\nThe sportsman has been flooded with well wishes from fans and famous friends including fellow tennis player tennis player Andy Murray, who commented: \"All the best to your wife and your family, Pete.\"\n\nThe couple married in 2000 and welcomed their sons in 2002 and 2005."
