        "text": "Former tennis star Pete Sampras revealed his wife, actress Bridgette Wilson-Sampras, has ovarian cancer.\n\nIn a statement posted on the ATP Tour’s official social media account, Sampras shared a lengthy statement explaining that though he is typically a quiet and private person, he wanted to share the news of his wife’s cancer diagnosis.\n\n“This past year has been an exceptionally challenging time for my family,” the statement read. “Last December, my wife, Bridgette, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Since then, she has had major surgery, pushed through chemotherapy and continues with targeted maintenance therapy.”\n\nHe continued, “It is hard to watch someone you love go through a challenge like this. However, seeing our boys step up and be such strong supports of Bridgette, myself and each other has been amazing. Watching Bridgette continue to be an incredible mom and wife through it all has been inspiring.”\n\nSampras concluded his statement by admitting that it has been hard to reach out for support because their experience over the last year has been too hard to talk about. He asked for thoughts and prayers for their family, as Wilson-Sampras continues along her healing journey.\n\nThe couple has been married since 2000 after dating for nine months. They have two sons, Christian, who was born in 2002, and Ryan, born in 2005.\n\nWilson-Sampras had her first feature lead role in Billy Madison, in which she plays Veronica Vaughn, the love interest of Adam Sandler’s Billy. Before that, she portrayed Ginger in four episodes of Saved by the Bell, followed by a recurring role in Santa Barbara. Her other credits include the film The Wedding Planner."
