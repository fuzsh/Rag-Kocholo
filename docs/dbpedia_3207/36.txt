Windows Fax and Scan (Fax viewing)

Windows Picture and Fax Viewer is the default image viewer included with Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. It replaced the Imaging application, which was first introduced in Windows 95.

It supports images in BMP, JPEG, PNG, ICO, GIF and TIFF file formats. It can show individual pictures, display all pictures in a folder as a slide show, and reorient them in 90Â° increments. Annotation tools are also available when viewing faxes.

The program would be replaced by Windows Photo Gallery in Windows Vista. The fax viewing functionality was also replaced by Windows Fax and Scan in the aforementioned OS.
