This is expected to grow to 35-40 TB in the next one year.\n\nAt present, we have a single Netbackup Appliance acting as a media server and the dedupe pool is around 75% utilized.\n\nMy question is what is the normal dedupe ratio for images? Will it be required to go for additional storage/media server before onboarding this server?\n\nThanks"
