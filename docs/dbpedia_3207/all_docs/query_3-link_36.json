Just follow this short howto to enable auditing on the file(s) in question and evaluate the security logs.\n\nIf you haven't activated the logging yet but need the information for past changes, you might be lucky to find it in the NTFS journal. The journal would rotate every now and then (depending on the amount of change operations on your disk and the configured journal size), if the change has already been overwritten, then there is no way to get to it anymore."
