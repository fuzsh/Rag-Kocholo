However, CheckMK agent reports this issue constantly:\n\n\"[agent] Communication failed: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer**CRIT** , Got no information from host, execution time 0.1 sec\"\n\nFrom the doc, it seems CheckMK 2.0 does not support Windows Server 2003 and there is one suggestion is to use old version of CheckMK agent 1.2.8. I tried with this agent version and it works for few days and then, it backs to the same issue.\n\nCould you please give me some advices how I could tackle with this issue? Thank you so much!\n\nRegards,\n\nViet\n\nHello Viet,\n\nWell, you shouldn’t have to go back to the 1.2.8 version of the agent. I believe the 1.6 versions will work as well (and at least they’re still in support).\n\nWhen you get the error message, can you verify that the Check MK Service is running? Even if so you may want to give it a restart and see if that fixes your issue.\n\nAlso, if possible upgrade to a more recent version of Windows, as running Win 2003 is a security risk.\n\nRegards,\n\nLouis\n\nHi,\n\nthank you so much for your reply!\n\nI tried with 1.6 but i faced this issue. I tried to get 32bit version but the issue is the same. Can you please give me a hint?\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nViet\n\nThank you so much! I really appreciate it.\n\nI managed to install version 1.5 agent and it worked an hour after that. However, it then died\n\n“[agent] Communication failed: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peerCRIT , Got no information from host, execution time 0.1 sec”\n\nThen, after i restarted the service, it works nicely until now (more than 1 day already).\n\nMay i know what do you think about this? Would it be the issue with CheckMK agent itself or connectivity?\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nViet"
