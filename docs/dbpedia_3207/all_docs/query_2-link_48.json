        "text": "You may be having trouble installing the .NET Framework. This document describes a set of steps you can take that may help you get it installed or help you undertstand why it isn't working.\n\nValidate your Windows version\n\nNot all .NET Framework versions are supported on all Windows versions. .NET Framework 4.8 is the latest version of the .NET Framework. We recommend you install it if you can. The following list describes which .NET Framework versions are supported on various Windows versions.\n\n.NET Framework 4.8 is supported on Windows 7 and later, and Windows Server 2008 R2 and later\n\n.NET Framework 4.8 is not supported on Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 8.0, or Windows Server 2003.\n\n.NET Framework 4.6 is the latest version supported on Windows 8.0, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.\n\n.NET Framework 4.0.3 is the latest version supported on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.\n\nIf you need to use a .NET Framework version that is not supported by your Windows version, you will need to upgrade your Windows version Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 or purchase a new computer.\n\nThe .NET Framework installer will sometimes be blocked because there are other applications or components in the process of installation. It is sometimes the case that there is a \"pending reboot\" that needs to be resolved before other components, like the .NET Framework, can be installed.\n\nBefore doing anything else, we recommend that you reboot your computer and try to install the .NET Framework again. If that works, you do not need to read the remainder of this document.\n\nIt is possible that your .NET Framework installation is corrupted and this is preventing new versions from being installed. You can run the .NET Framework Repair tool to potentially resolve the situation.\n\nThe .NET Framework Repair Tool is displayed in the following image.\n\nYou need to click \"Next\" through the wizard to complete the process.\n\nAfter completing the repair tool process, reboot your computer again, and try to install the .NET Framework. If that works, you do not need to read the remainder of this document.\n\nThe last option is to collect .NET Framework installer logs and send them to Microsoft. This is a semi-manual process, but can be completed quickly using the following steps."
