And this is why...\n\nI'm using a \"pro\" fax software that uses 3rd party applications as hosts to render the specific \"documents\" to the fax/printer driver.\n\nSo for instance docx will launch Word, pdf will launch Foxit Reader and so on. It works by somehow launching the programs and clicking through the dialog boxes. It's basically right clicking the file and then hitting print and then checking Windows events for the Print dialog. The caveat to this is that any extra dialog boxes that may appear such as a help wizard or update manager will block the process. All fax software vendors recommend to go through the programs and disable any special dialog boxes that may appear. So far it works for Word and Foxit. It can work for images too but have to find the proper print program.\n\nAll this to say is that by default in Windows Picture Fax Viewer opens a Print Wizard dialog. I would like to change the Print association to Paint for most/all images.\n\nYou mention making the default Print program as Paint. Entering the print dialog supplied by Paint means associating those file types you want with Paint.\n\nA simple way, right click on the type of file you want to associate with Paint\n\nThen select Open With and a list of installed programs will display. Select what you want and make sure to check the \"Always use the selected program to open this file type\"\n\nOR right click the an example file of that type and select Properties, Press the change button and you will get to the same dialog where you can select the default program.\n\nanswered Jul 11, 2012 at 16:34\n\ndatatoodatatoo\n\n3,4802222 silver badges3131 bronze badges"
