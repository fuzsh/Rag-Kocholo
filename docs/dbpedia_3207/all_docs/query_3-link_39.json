        "text": "Police officers today across New York write tickets and accident reports on a computer in the patrol car, print copies for the involved citizens, and electronically transmit the data to the courts, and involved state agencies. Officers can also complete a magnitude of law enforcement forms in the vehicle and import case data directly into their records management system.\n\nThe New York State Police has taken the lead in the TraCS program and currently, there are over 500 agencies using TraCS and transmitting data electronically. Each year, TraCS transmits over 2,000,000 traffic citations and 300,000 crash reports. Electronic transmissions of tickets and crash reports continue to grow, breaking all previous records.\n\nThe TraCS team continues to add forms and functionality to TraCS. This program has been successful due to the continual efforts and coordination of New York State Police, Governors Traffic Safety Committee, Department of Motor Vehicles, Office of Court Administration, Department of Transportation and several other governmental agencies. The implementation of new forms and the distribution of new technology have not only increased productivity and enforcement but have also made our roadways safer for all those that live and travel throughout New York State.\n\nTraffic and Criminal Software (TraCS) is application software that, combined with laptop computers, one or more PCs in a central office, and data communications, provides officers with all of the functionality needed to record and retrieve incident information wherever and whenever an incident occurs.\n\nOfficers respond to many incidents every day and each incident requires paperwork and other administrative duties that take away from valuable patrol time. The TraCS software was developed in response to the need for a well-designed information management tool for field officers that would simplify the data collection process and ease the administrative burden on officers.\n\nIn a paper form environment, officers are often required to copy the same information, such as names, addresses, and vehicle information, to multiple paper forms. TraCS eliminates this repetition through the use of Common Information, which allows the user to enter certain types of data once and use it many times. TraCS can organize Common Information into customizable categories including:\n\nIndividuals (e.g., name, address, phone number)\n\nVehicles (e.g., make, model, license plate number)\n\nCommercial Carriers (e.g., carrier name, carrier address, DOT number)\n\nLocation (e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates, location description)\n\nTraCS uses the latest mobile computing technologies to facilitate data collection where incidents occur. Officers have access to many tools to aid them in reporting events, including Officer Notes, customized data entry fields, robust diagramming tools, and interfaces to a wide array of software and hardware input sources. All of these tools are available wherever and whenever they are needed.\n\nSignatures may be captured on a TraCS form by writing on the screen when using a tablet PC, by capturing it using a barcode imager, or by using a signature tablet connected to the computer. In addition, the officer may choose to store his/her signature in the application for the duration of their shift or permanently so that he/she doesn't have to sign every form every time.\n\nTraCS forms are status driven. Certain actions can be performed on a form based on its status. For example, when a Crash form is first started, its status starts at 'Open'. When the information on the form is successfully validated and it has no errors, the status of the form is set to 'Validated'. Only 'Validated' forms can be reviewed by a supervisor and 'Accepted' or 'Rejected' and only forms with a status of 'Accepted' can be transmitted to the central state crash report repository. The Rules Builder SDK tool allows the statuses for a TraCS form to be defined as well as the actions that can be performed on a form that has a particular status. This customizable process flow functionality provides flexibility to the agency to design and implement a process flow based on the way the agency does business.\n\nThe Software Development Kit enhances the functionality of TraCS by enabling users to design, build, implement and modify Forms, Reports, Data Validation Rules, Process Flow Rules, and Auto populate Rules to be used within the TraCS framework. The Software Development Kit gives you full control over the forms and reports that are used within TraCS.\n\nThe SDK consists of three major tools â€“ the Forms Builder, the Rules Builder, and the Database Builder. These tools enable a user to completely design and build custom forms and reports and fully integrate them into TraCS. Each of these tools is defined below.\n\nForms Builder - Used to create forms and reports;\n\nRules Builder - Used to create Validation, Process Flow, and Auto populate rules that determine how the user interacts with forms and reports;\n\nDatabase Builder - Used to build underlying database tables for form data storage.\n\nIn addition to the three SDK Tools, there are numerous other customizable elements of the TraCS application that can be tailored to meet a particular agency's needs including:\n\nSplash Screen and Technical Support;\n\nOnline Help (CHM or HTML);\n\nThe Violation Search Engine;\n\nDriver Exchange;\n\nExternal Search Functionality;\n\nEvent Logging.\n\nThe TraCS solution provides the foundation from which an agency can build a data collection tool based upon their unique needs and requirements. TraCS does not restrict the agency by conforming to a pre-packaged software application or communications method. TraCS users have received national awards and media recognition for their rapid and successful deployment of incident reporting based on this reusable toolkit."
