        "text": "Bringing Your Own Image\n\nA critical part of any lift-and-shift cloud migration project is the migration of on-premises virtual machines (VMs) to the cloud. You can import your on-premises virtualized root volumes to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) using the custom image import feature, and then create compute instances using those images.\n\nYou can import Windows and Linux-based custom images and use them to create VMs on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Bringing your own image to a bare metal instance is not supported.\n\nFor instructions describing how to import your own image:\n\nImporting Custom Windows Images\n\nImporting Custom Linux Images\n\nLimitations and Considerations\n\nBe aware of the following information:\n\nLicensing requirements: You must comply with all licensing requirements when you upload and start instances based on OS images that you supply.\n\nThe maximum image size is 400 GB.\n\nService limits and compartment quotas apply to custom images. For more information, see Service Limits. You can request a service limit increase.\n\nLaunch Modes\n\nYou can launch imported Linux VMs in either paravirtualized mode or emulated mode. On AMD and Arm-based shapes, Oracle Linux Cloud Developer images, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux images, imported images are supported in paravirtualized mode only.\n\nWindows imported images are supported in paravirtualized mode only.\n\nParavirtualized mode offers better performance than emulated mode. We recommend that you use paravirtualized mode if your OS supports it. Linux-based operating systems running the kernel version 3.4 or later support paravirtualized drivers. You can verify your system's kernel version using the uname command.\n\nTo verify the kernel version using the uname command\n\nRun the following command:\n\nuname -a\n\nThe output should look similar to this sample:\n\nLinux ip_bash 4.14.35-1818.2.1.el7uek.x86_64 #2 SMP Mon Aug 27 21:16:31 PDT 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nThe kernel version is the number at the first part of output string. In the sample output shown previously, the version is 4.14.35.\n\nIf your image supports paravirtualized drivers, you can convert your existing emulated mode instances into paravirtualized instances. After you complete the conversion, instances created from the image are launched in paravirtualized mode.\n\nTo convert emulated mode instances into paravirtualized instances\n\nCreate a custom image of your instance.\n\nEdit the image capabilities for the custom image to use the following settings:\n\nFor Firmware and Preferred firmware, select BIOS.\n\nFor the following fields, select Paravirtualized.\n\nLaunch mode\n\nPreferred launch mode\n\nNIC attachment type\n\nPreferred network attachment type\n\nBoot volume type\n\nPreferred boot volume type\n\nLocal data volume\n\nPreferred local data volume type\n\nRemote data volume\n\nPreferred remote data volume type\n\nWindows Images\n\nThese Windows versions support custom image import:\n\nWindows Server 2012 Standard, Datacenter\n\nWindows Server 2012 R2 Standard, Datacenter\n\nWindows Server 2016 Standard, Datacenter\n\nWindows Server 2019 Standard, Datacenter\n\nWindows Server 2022 Standard, Datacenter\n\nFor steps to import a Windows image, see Importing Custom Windows Images.\n\nBring your own license (BYOL) for Windows Server is not permitted when launching a VM instance on a shared host. For more information about BYOL and the licensing requirements for Windows images, see Licensing Options for Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Licensing on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\n\nLinux Images\n\nThe Linux and UNIX-like operating systems in the following table support custom image import.\n\nSupport details:\n\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure has tested the operating systems listed in the following table and supports customers in ensuring that instances launched from these images and built according to the guidelines in this topic are accessible using SSH.\n\nFor any OS version other than those covered by an official support service from Oracle (for example, Oracle Linux with Premier Support), Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides commercially reasonable support limited to getting an instance launched and accessible through SSH.\n\nSupport from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure in creating an instance from a custom OS does not ensure that the operating system vendor also supports the instance. Customers running Oracle Linux on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure automatically have access to Oracle Linux Premier Support.\n\nLinux or UNIX-like Operating System Supported Versions CentOS 6.9, 7, Stream 8 or later Debian 5.0.10, 6.0, 7, 8 or later Flatcar Container Linux 2345.3.0 or later FreeBSD 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 or later openSUSE Leap 15.1 Oracle Linux 5.11, 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, 9.x RHEL\n\nSupport from Red Hat and OCI through the Red Hat Certified Cloud and Service Provider (CCSP) program: for versions and shapes, see Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\n\nLimited support from OCI: 4.5, 5.5, 5.6, 5.9, 5.11, 6.5, 6.9, 7 or later\n\nSUSE 11, 12.1, 12.2 or later Ubuntu 12.04, 13.04 or later\n\nCertain versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) images are supported through the Red Hat Certified Cloud and Service Provider (CCSP) program. For requirements and steps to create an instance using a supported RHEL image, see Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Images.\n\nYou might also have success importing other distributions of Linux.\n\nFor steps to import a Linux-based image, see Importing Custom Linux Images.\n\nBringing Your Own Hypervisor Guest OS\n\nYou can bring your own hypervisor guest OS using Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) or Hyper-V.\n\nNote\n\nBring your own hypervisor deployment of ESXi on bare metal compute instances is not supported. ESXi is supported only by provisioning an Oracle Cloud VMware Solution software-defined data center (SDDC). See VMware Solution for more information.\n\nBringing Your Own KVM\n\nYou can bring your own operating system images or older operating systems, such as Ubuntu 6.x, RHEL 3.x, and CentOS 5.4, using KVM on bare metal instances.\n\nTo bring your own KVM, first create a bare metal instance using the KVMÂ image from Marketplace. Then, copy your on-premises guest OS to KVMÂ on the bare metal instance. For more information, see Oracle Linux KVM.\n\nBringing Your Own Hyper-V\n\nYou can bring your own operating system images or older operating system, such as Windows Server 2016 using Hyper-V on bare metal instances.\n\nTo bring your own Hyper-V, first create a bare metal instance using the Windows Server Datacenter platform image. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will issue a license for Windows Server when the instance is launched. Then, copy your on-premises guest OS to Hyper-V on the bare metal instance. No additional license is required because Windows Server Datacenter includes unlimited virtual machines.\n\nBe aware of the following considerations:\n\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure will issue a license when you launch an instance using a custom image. If you want to bring your own license (BYOL) for Windows Server, you must activate Windows Server with your own license. For steps, see Activating Licenses on a Dedicated Host.\n\nImporting your own ISOÂ image is not supported.\n\nFor a list of supported Hyper-V guests, see the following resources:\n\nSupported Windows guest operating systems for Hyper-V on Windows Server\n\nSupported Linux and FreeBSD virtual machines for Hyper-V on Windows"
