But after an hour or so I checked it and it was complete at 42%, and I thought lets eat lunch and give it some more time. When I got back it was still stuck at 42%. I rebooted and took the same procedure - and it stalled at 42 again.\n\nThe I tried to get old-school and do it manually, reboot and in with the W2K3 CD and I hit F6 to install 3rd party drivers and it asked for the drivers and then it said it could not locate a floppy disk driver, which I ofcourse did not install or order to the server! What is this, it’s now 2006, and I am trying to install Windows Server 2003 R2 and it still asks me to use a floppy disk!!! You can’t use a USB memory or a CD or anyting else but a floppy disk!\n\nAfter an hour or so searching the internet and running around my colleagues trying to find a floppy disk with an USB interface (which should work according to Microsoft Support) IÂ was back to square one. In a desperate mood I tried the Server Assistand CD again and it still got stuck at 42% even after waiting for a few hours. A side note here is that when it was stuck the mouse worked but the CD-tray could not be ejected.\n\nWhen I was so close to give up and throw the server out of the window, I downloaded an old version of the Server Assistand software and tried it! Tadaaa - an hour later I was up and running!\n\nYou learn stuff every day and this time I learned that floppy disks is still a vital part of a modern operating system. Let’s see how it is in Longhorn Server and does anybody know how it is in Windows Vista?"
