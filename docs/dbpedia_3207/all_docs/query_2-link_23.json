        "text": "Photo Station (5.0) is an online photo album used to organize photos and videos on the NAS and to share them with friends and family across the Internet. With Photo Station, users can drag & drop photos into virtual albums, sparing them from having to tediously move/copy files around and helping to save storage space as they only need one copy of their photos on the NAS when they create albums with special themes. Smart albums can also be used to automatically collect content that matches search criteria and helps users to neatly manage their photos.\n\nThis chapter covers the following topics:\n\nStarting Photo Station\n\nDepending on your NAS model, Photo Station may be enabled by default and can be launched from the Desktop or the Main Menu. If not, install and enable it in the App Center (for QTS 4.1 or later versions only) and follow these steps:\n\nThe Photo Station supports the following file formats:\n\nFamiliarizing yourself with Photo Station\n\nIn Photo Station, there are two modes that you can use: Gallery mode and Manage mode. Gallery mode is designed for a greater viewing experience, while Manage mode is provided for easier photo and video management.\n\nGallery Mode\n\nMenu Bar\n\nManage Mode\n\nMenu Bar\n\nLeft Panel\n\nUsing Photo Station\n\nCreating and managing albums\n\nThere are two ways to create an album:\n\nTo manage albums, right click on an album and choose to download, remove, rename, share, stream, play as a slideshow, open, or configure its settings.\n\nCreating and managing smart albums\n\nSimilar to an album, there are three ways to create smart albums:\n\nTo manage smart albums, right click on an album under \"Smart Album\" in the left panel and choose to download, remove, rename, share, stream, play as a slideshow, open, or configure its settings.\n\nSharing photos, videos, albums, or smart albums\n\nYou can share photos, videos, albums, or smart albums with your friends via email, social networks, or sharing links using Sharing Cart or configure sharing settings when you create an album or smart album.\n\nSharing Cart\n\nSharing Cart allows you to conveniently collect photos and videos stored in different albums or folders before sharing them. After you collect items using Sharing Cart, choose one of these methods to share them:\n\nNote: To share files/folders using your own email account, please first set your email account in QTS Desktop > \"Options\" > \"E-mail Account\".\n\nNote that for album or smart album, all the photos/videos within that album will be loaded to Sharing Cart, while for a photo or video, only that item is loaded.\n\nFor sharing with your friends on Facebook, you can bind your Facebook account with Photo Station. After the account is successfully bound, your Facebook friends can log into Photo Station (http://NAS_Name or IP/photo/) with their account to browse photos from shared albums.\n\nConfiguring sharing settings\n\nAs you create an album, you can choose to share it with other NAS users (choose whether all NAS users can edit the album, or only the album creator/administrator can edit the album) or the public (show this album on the QTS login page - please note that this option is only available for administrators) or not to share at all (leave both options unchecked), and set the valid period on the album creation page.\n\nChecking sharing history\n\nTo check the sharing history, click \"Shared Center\" on the left panel in Manage mode. You can review the details of a record or re-share the shared items.\n\nPhoto and Video Operations\n\nAfter right clicking on a photo or video in Manage mode, a menu will show up, and users can choose to perform a desired action from the list.\n\nFinding your photos and videos quickly\n\nYou can rate or classify photos/videos to quickly locate them. To do so, right click on a photo or video and then tag, rate or color label them. To batch mark or classify multiple photos or videos, first click the \"Multi-select\" button on the main menu (or hold the Ctrl key), select your desired photos or videos and right click the photos or videos to perform desired actions. After photos or videos are tagged, rated, or color labeled, they can be searched by their rating, color label or tag in the search bar.\n\nViewing photos and videos\n\nIn Gallery mode, double click on a photo or video or click the \"Display\" button in the thumbnail display style to launch the Media Viewer for viewing operations.\n\nPlaying photos and videos as slideshow\n\nA slideshow is a collection of photos that are played in a sequential fashion at an interval in full screen mode for your photo enjoyment. To play photos or video images as slideshow, click the \"Slideshow\" button in Gallery mode to switch the viewing mode.\n\nUse the buttons on the menu bar for slideshow or album operations.\n\nGeotagging photos and photo map\n\nTo geotag a photo, right click on a photo and select \"Set Coordinates\" to set its coordinates (you can either type the coordinates or the location in the search box in the \"View Map\" dialog window.) Click \"Save\" after you finish the setting. To view photos on a map, click on the photos > \"Information\", and then click the red pin next to \"Coordinates\". This feature is only available for photos with GPS coordinates. For photos with no GPS coordinates, please follow the above steps to set their GPS coordinates.\n\nAdding face tags to photos\n\nTo view photos with face tags, switch to Manage mode and click \"Faces\" on the left panel.\n\nBrowsing PDF files\n\nYou can also browse PDF files as photos using Photo Station. To use this feature, right click on a PDF file to create a new album. After clicking on that album, you will see all the pages of the PDF file displayed as individual photos.\n\nMedia Library and Privacy Settings\n\nPhoto and video files in Photo Station are listed and displayed according to shared folder privileges and media folders settings in the Media Library. For shared folder privileges, only users with an appropriate permission to a shared folder can view its contents in the Photo Station. For example, if a user does not have read/write, or read-only permissions to a certain shared folder, that user cannot see the photos and videos in the shared folder.\n\nPhotos and videos stored in the shared folders are only visible after they are detected and scanned by the Media Library. To set the Media Library to scan for photos and videos manually or by schedule go to \"Control Panel\" > \"Multimedia Management\" > \"Media Library\". For more details on media folder settings, please refer to the chapter on Multimedia Management.\n\nÂ© 2017 QNAP Systems, Inc."
