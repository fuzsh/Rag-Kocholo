This means that any R2 server you deploy needs to have SP2 installed afterwards, which is time consuming and also pretty boring.\n\nThe good news is you can slipstream SP2 into your R2 media just as easily as with previous versions of Windows Server. Both the Disc 1 and Disc 2 media need to be slipstreamed or you will run into errors if you try to add the R2 components onto the server.\n\nSimply copy your R2 Disc 1 and Disc 2 media to your hard drive, download the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 Download, and run the slipstream commands."
