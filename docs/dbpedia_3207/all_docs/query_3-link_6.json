        "text": "Windows Photo Gallery (formerly known as Windows Live Photo Gallery) is an image organizer, photo editor and photo sharing program. It is a part of Microsoft's Windows Essentials software suite.\n\nHistory[]\n\nWindows Photo Gallery debuted in Windows Vista. It was the default program set for viewing images, replacing the simpler Windows Picture and Fax Viewer from past versions.\n\nIn Windows 7, Windows Photo Gallery was no longer included. Instead, it was made part of the downloadable Windows Live Essentials suite, and was renamed to Windows Live Photo Gallery.\n\nWindows Live Photo Gallery was updated in 2009 along with the rest of the suite, and again in 2011. The final version, Windows Essentials 2012, removed the \"Live\" branding, and the name of Windows Live Photo Gallery was shortened to Photo Gallery.\n\nMicrosoft announced that the product would no longer be supported or be available for download after January 10, 2017. Image organizing and editing functionality from Photo Gallery was incorporated into Microsoft Photos."
