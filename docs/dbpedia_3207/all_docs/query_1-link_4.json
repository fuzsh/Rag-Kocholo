It replaced the Imaging application, which was first introduced in Windows 95.\n\nIt supports images in BMP, JPEG, PNG, ICO, GIF and TIFF file formats. It can show individual pictures, display all pictures in a folder as a slide show, and reorient them in 90Â° increments. Annotation tools are also available when viewing faxes.\n\nThe program would be replaced by Windows Photo Gallery in Windows Vista. The fax viewing functionality was also replaced by Windows Fax and Scan in the aforementioned OS.\n\nGallery[edit | edit source]"
