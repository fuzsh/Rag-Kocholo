Additionally, many compliance requirements include being on a currently supported operating system.\n\nYou can leverage the flexibility and reliability of the AWS cloud by migrating your applications to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances running a newer version of Microsoft Windows Server (2008, 2008 R2, 2012 and 2012 R2). Preconfigured Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) with different combinations of Windows and SQL Server are available. Amazon EC2 running Windows Server enables you to run any compatible solution on our cost-effective, high-performance, reliable cloud computing platform. Please see the FAQ for more details about Windows Server 2003.\n\nIf you are considering moving your infrastructure to the cloud, Cloud Estimator can help you measure your existing workloads, project the optimal cloud capacity to support performance goals and estimate your total cost of ownership. Cloud Estimater can also support your migration process by providing you the right settings for your new environment.\n\n» Cloudamize in AWS Marketplace\n\n» Cloudamize in APN Directory\n\nLive Migrations of Windows 2003 servers to AWS, using continuous replication of your entire Windows 2003 server workloads. With near zero downtime and no data loss, CloudEndure will get your server migration started in five minutes with no reboot required. You will be able to continue using your servers and applications as-is on AWS, without any application configuration, OS conversion or other manual intervention requirements.\n\n» CloudEndure in AWS Marketplace\n\n» CloudEndure in APN Directory"
