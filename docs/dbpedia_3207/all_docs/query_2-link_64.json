RAS service is configured with static IP pool on the same subnet of internal network (10.10.0.x). The problem is when a client connect to server, client can connect to server(10.10.0.10), but cannot connect to another host locate in internal network (10.10.0.11) even cannot ping to 10.10.0.50. RAS configured with IP routing enabled, client connect with options: Use default gateway on remote network. I'm messed up and can not figure out what wrong. Please help me T_T.\n\nTIA, giobuon"
