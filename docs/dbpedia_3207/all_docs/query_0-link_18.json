        "text": "Hi everyone. As you may know, lots of people aren’t interested much of compilation & further development of Windows XP/Server 2003 source code. By referring to guides from 2020/21, I succeed of compilation. Also I will share a simple guide of how to do that (based on https://rentry.co/build-win2k3). Here’s a screenshot to prove that it’s a real compiled build.\n\nInstructions\n\nCreate and install Windows 10’s latest version virtual machine, with minimum 120GB disk space and 4GB memory and processor cores\n\nAllocate D:\\ disk drive for entire source code (min. 60GB)\n\nChange CD-ROM drive to G:\\ (for getting missing files if neccesary)\n\nDisable User Account Control - needs for avoid screens of confirmation\n\nDownload source code from link below\n\nImportant! Disable Real-Time Protection from Windows Security\n\nExtract source code to D:\\srv03rtm\n\nUncheck read-only from srv03rtm folder\n\nIf your host is Windows 10 1809 and later, install driver.pfx from “tools” folder for Local Machine & Current User, else if your host is up to Windows Vista delete driver.pfx, and rename driver_3des.pfx to that.\n\nRun Command Prompt as Administrator, and switch to D:\\srv03rtm.\n\nIf you’re on x64 host, run tools\\razzle64 free offline, else: tools\\razzle free offline\n\nRun tools\\prebuild for prepare to building\n\nType build /cZP -M 4 (-M 4 for using all 4 cores of processor)\n\nExtract missing binaries to D:\\binaries.x86fre\n\nType on CMD tools\\postbuild -full\n\nThen, write tools\\oscdimg pro|per|srv for generating ISO file for XP Professional/Home Edition/Server 2003 Standard Edition\n\nSerial key located at srv03rtm\\base\\ntsetup\\pidgen\\pidgen\\spidgen.cpp, and it’s HB9CF-JTKJF-722HV-VPBRF-9VKVM\n\nMissing instructions I will write here. You can use guide at top as quick reference to get all missing things. Link to missing binaries of source I will upload later.\n\nDownload Links\n\nSource code: srv03rtm.7z - Google Drive\n\nMissing files: misbin.7z - Google Drive\n\nConnect\n\nDiscord - OpenXP\n\nis this the files of the leak or on a fixed up version of the leak done in 2021\n\nedit: there’s a readme file claiming this is prepatched 10a. good.\n\nI’m 4 months trying to make a build and I can’t do it at all… I’m using Windows XP Pro x86 sp3, I get about 8 errors in a build, and I don’t even know how many in the postbuild… I already I’m discouraged\n\nI used every rentry co guide but it didn’t work\n\nnothing need to change. I regenerated certificates in November, 2022. they will be valid for additional 100 years thankfully to guide Win2K3 test certificates utility.\n\nand use minimum Windows 10 1809 (2018 year release), because started from 1809 exists support for newer encryptions of certificates. I recommend you use latest Windows 10 x64 release.\n\nthe slightly different certificates might be why setup ends up failing on some build setups. regenerating them to be more accurate to the original ones fixed my setup problem and also let me fully build srv03rtm on windows 7 (which builds it faster due to less background tasks using the hard drive)\n\nmaybe, but I don’t know how to generate them for older Windows versions. it seems in some parts needs to turn on -legacy switch for OpenSSL. anyways, in source code exists additional instruction of generation (D:\\srv03rtm\\tools\\openssl.txt). maybe that will help. otherwise, you can use Rentry.co guide for Linux only"
