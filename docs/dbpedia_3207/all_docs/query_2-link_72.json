        "text": "Hi there,\n\nI have recently been having a lots of issues with Windows 10 and 11’s included adware, spyware, sponsorware, malware and general undesired operations.\n\nLast month, I upgraded one of my clients IT infrastructure and they instructed me to take away their old stuff for recycling. This included a couple of beefy Japanese best brand servers (Fujitsu) which I have wiped and installed Windows Server 2022 Standard.\n\nInitially I wanted to just experiment and use them as learning tools… then it hit me like a slippery fish… Why don’t I just use Windows Server as my main workstation OS???\n\nThere is only 1 malware application (MS Edge), ZERO bloatware (start menu is completey empty, no XBOX nonsense, no children’s games, no Tick Tock or Instant Gram) and it’s performing only desired operations!\n\nCompared to windows 10 this is absolutely fantastic! It’s so much faster and snappier and incredibly robust.\n\nSo let this be a thread for real pro’s who use Windows Server as their Main OS.\n\nWindows 10/11 adware lovers pls stay away.\n\nMy only question is there anything I need to be aware of running Windows Server as a home desktop/workstation OS?\n\nSo far it’s running absolutely great and I’m thinking of using it on my main PC Ryzen 5, 64GB ram.\n\nAre you looking to get another thread locked?\n\nWhile I note you want a discussion - you handle it very badly, you attract people who are going to moan based on your abusive-humour in how you define Edge - the virus/malware and instant gran or whatever other non-comical names you use.\n\nBoth Windows server and desktop OSes are based on the same underlying core, and have been since the NT/2000 days, prior to that the code was different, but today it’s the same core code.\n\nWe get it, you dislike Microsoft products, so why do you use them. You can use any Linux desktop OS you like or macOS and still manage Windows (using RDP, WAC, PowerShell or Server manager).\n\nI don’t want to get a thread locked haha, I want to hear from people who use Windows Server as their Desktop OS at home.\n\nI’m sorry my dislike of instant gram and tick tock is offensive to you.\n\nAt the end of the day I can dislike what I wish. You need to learn to not take it personally that I don’t like some applications.\n\nAlso I don’t dislike microsoft products, I dislike adware, spyware and undesired operations. This is evidenced by the fact that I love Windows Server. I have loved windows since Windows 95. I have loved windows far longer than I’ve not loved it. But why the need to be a windows fanboy a prerequisite to discuss Windows Server for home use, who are you and why are you taking things so personally?\n\nYou accuse me of being “Abusive-humour” Abusive to whom? A software application cannot be “abused” by negative adjectives. A software application has no feelings. You are taking this WAY to personally, you need to take a break buddy.\n\nIf you don’t have anything to add on the topic of using Windows Server as a Desktop OS, then why post at all?\n\nI state that I am very much enjoying using Windows Server 2022 and your advice to a person who is enjoying Windows Server 2022 is “get mac or linux”??? What kind of logic is that? No, I will not use Mac or Linux because I am fine with Windows Server at the moment. (Btw I have three linux boxes at home, I need Windows for running windows native applications - cant believe I had to explain this)\n\nAlso what’s funny is you say “We get it,”… “We”?? You don’t speak for the whole forum buddy. “We” haha, who do you think you are, you seem to think you have some sort of gang behind you. That’s no excuse for trying to bully me.\n\nI’m not “badmouthing” anything. I am simply stating that I don’t like the bloatware that’s in Windows 10, as some background for the thread.\n\nPeople may be wondering my rationale for wanting to use Windows Server at home. I am simply explaining my rationale for using Windows Server when I say I don’t like the bloat that’s in Windows 10.\n\nIt’s all right, people can badmouth anything they like. Except certain protected characteristics like racisim or sexism. Software is NOT a protected characteristic for badmouthing. I love Russian open source software developers, If someone wants to badmouth open source software, they can do it to their heart’s content, but they shouldn’t badmouth Russians.\n\nBut yet again you go off-topic. I am not asking how to de-bloat windows 10. I am asking for people who use Server OS at home… If you have no experience using Windows Server in a domestic setting, then please go away and stop trolling my thread.\n\nGiven I do a lot of small business support I run into a lot of weird things, duct tape, etc. I use what works; windows, linux, what the hell ever runs the app the best. I’ve put many a Linux zealot in their place, but not exactly thrilled at the direction MS is going. Adults run applications, not operating systems.\n\nWhile the underlying code between Windows Server and desktops is pretty much the same, I’ve not encountered the same in terms of front end performance. Given I support a lot of RDS servers I often have to run apps native on Windows servers and desktops side by side. In virtually all instances I find Win10 / 11 is more responsive than Servers…but it varies according to the app.\n\nAll the gripes the OP listed can be mitigated with a bit of registry or power shell kung-fu. Turn off the news feeds and other irritating MS bolt ons and Win10/11 are pretty speedy. Likely with scheduler tuning Windows Server could be made to run like Win10 / 11, but not sure why anybody would do this. Server 2019 is one of the most polished, reliable and flexible OS’s I’ve ever worked with. Why mess with it.\n\nIf anything I find the opposite - Win10 makes an especially capable utility server. Its only the update nags that bug me if it’s not in AD.\n\nServer 2000 was incredibly powerful as a desktop OS. You could shoehorn most of XP’s features onto it, and it was far more responsive and stable. This however was in the days when MS still couldn’t make up their mind about the structure of workstations, servers and consumer desktops. Since Server 2003 I’ve not found any performance advantage to running a server as a desktop and found them not as responsive for foreground apps as desktops - minus some manual bloat disabling,\n\nWell, the first reason not to run Windows server as a desktop OS is simply cost. Windows Server is licensed by core, with a 16 core minimum. This means the OS for your system through a legitimate retailer would start at about $800.\n\nWindows Server has been used in RDS environments for years, and has a lot of advantages. But I have literally never heard of any IT Pro using as your desktop OS. I for one would not. Vanilla Windows 10 /11 if you are paying for OEM or volume licensing needs no “decrapifying”. You would be better to pay for an OEM Windows 10 license. Not Windows Server. But thats my opinion.\n\nI am shocked at that price! The list price from my supplier is £20.99 for the base 16 core Server 2022 license - and this is a MS certified partner. And I can get 20% off as I’m a customer of 5+ years. And I can get a further discount of around 20% as I usually buy things in bulk…\n\nSo about £13.50 is the what I’d expect to pay for a legitimate Server 2022 license from an MS certified distributor.\n\n$800 is insane! Is that USA specific pricing? I have heard stories about how in USA, items which are worth $10 are sold for $100+. I didn’t think it was that bad.\n\nI have many spare licenses for Windows 10 & 11. I have no need to buy more.\n\nYou mentioned “Vanilla Windows 10/11… needs no decrapifying” man I wish I were you! Here is a list of things which are “crap” to me personally:\n\n3D Viewer\n\nAlarms & Clock\n\nCalendar\n\nCamera\n\nCortana\n\nFeedback Hub\n\nGet Help\n\nMail\n\nMaps\n\nMicrosoft Edge\n\nMicrosoft Solitaire Collection\n\nMicrosoft Store\n\nOffice\n\nOneDrive\n\nOneNote\n\nPaint3d\n\nPeople\n\nPhotos\n\nSnip & Sketch\n\nSticky Notes\n\nTips\n\nWeather\n\nXbox\n\nYour Phone\n\nCandy Crush Soda Saga\n\nNetflix\n\nMovies & TV\n\nGroove Music\n\nVoice Recorder\n\nSpotify\n\nGame Bar\n\nSkype\n\nTick Tock\n\nInstantgram\n\nFacbok messnger\n\nI guarantee that price is for a 2-core pack, and you would need 8 of those. And that price sounds very suspect to me. Even M$ site is 100x that. Your pricing estimate definitely needs to be checked out.\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/d/windows-server-2022-standard-cal/dg7gmgf0d6m5\n\nYou will also need a CAL for any user or device logging into or using the server or its features in any way.\n\nAnd what is with the sarcasm? I would prefer if you were more polite, as I am just trying to help out.\n\nSorry, i am going to have to see a link for that, because I have been buying WS licensing through what you are calling “third party distributors” (we normally refer to them as Value Added Resellers / VARs) for 15 years. In that time I have probably ordered from 5 different VARs, which will vary a few percent between them.\n\nBut not by 95%.\n\nWhat is the name of your reseller? Do you have a link?\n\nAnd you need to ask yourself a common-sense question: how could M$ hope to make a dollar in the business world if they sell their business product for $30? Which is 1/3 of the cost of their consumer product?\n\nYour caveat emptor bells should be going off at that price."
