        "text": "After Windows finishes installing, you will be prompted to insert Disk 2. Disk 2 contains all of the R2 content.\n\n© CNET Networks - Submitted by Brien Posey\n\nWhen the second CD finishes installing, you will see this message.\n\nThe first release of Windows Server 2003 displayed the Manage Your Server dialog box after Windows finished installing. R2 provides you with the Windows Server Post-Setup Security Updates screen first.\n\nR2 is designed to block all inbound packets until you click the Finish button shown in Image 3.\n\nThe new Print Management Console allows administrators to more easily monitor network printers and take action if necessary.\n\nThe DFS Replication Engine has been completely rewritten. The new multi master replication engine supports multiple replication topologies. If a WAN link fails, data can be stored at a hub server and forwarded when the link becomes available again.\n\nThe DFS management interface has also been redesigned to make managing DFS namespaces less confusing.\n\nADAM allows you to create a separate Active Directory partition for each application so that the application’s data is isolated from other Active Directory partitions.\n\nActive Directory Federated Trusts makes identity federation possible. This means that a user’s Active Directory identity can be securely shared over a federated trust.\n\nThe Server for NIS portion of the Microsoft Identity Management for UNIX console allows a domain controller to act as a master NIS (UNIX Network Information Server) for one or more NIS domains.\n\nThe Password Synchronization portion of the Microsoft Identity Management for UNIX console allows passwords to be synchronized between Windows and UNIX environments. If a user changes their Windows password, the user’s UNIX password is changed as well, and visa versa.\n\nThe Subsystem for UNIX Based Applications (SUA) allows you to compile and run UNIX applications on a Windows Server 2003 R2 server.\n\nFile screening allows you to prevent users from saving certain types of files in various directories. For example, you could block executable files, audio files, etc.\n\nR2 adds reporting capabilities to the file system. You can search for duplicate files, frequently accessed files, large files, etc.\n\nAlthough technically not included with R2 (at least not with my copy anyway), Virtual Server is worth paying attention to. Microsoft has licensed R2 to run up to four virtual servers per physical server at no additional cost!"
