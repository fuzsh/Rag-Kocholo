Why are we still talking about MPC more than 40 years later? Well, it turns out MPC is based on some extremely complex math, which is like nectar to anyone in the field of cryptography. And, over the past decade, MPC has come to be exhumed from the archives and harnessed as one of the most powerful tools available for the protection of sensitive data. Here, in a discussion with Nigel Smart, Joshua W. Baron, Sanjay Saravanan, Jordan Brandt, and Atefeh Mashatan, we explore some of the implications of these advances.\n\nACM Queue’s \"Research for Practice\" serves up expert-curated guides to the best of computing research, and relates these breakthroughs to the challenges that software engineers face every day. In this installment, \"Automatically Testing Database Systems,\" Manuel Rigger (Assistant Professor in the School of Computing at the National University of Singapore) presents three papers. The first focuses on the problem of automatically synthesizing sophisticated test oracles that check whether the outputs of a database history are correct. The second co-designs input generation and test oracle in order to focus strictly on bugs in concurrency control. The last covers a diverse input space of SQL dialects while relying on the \"built-in\" test oracle of system crashes.\n\nACM is excited to announce a new enhancement of to the widely used ACM email forwarding service.
