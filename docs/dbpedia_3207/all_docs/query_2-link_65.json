        "text": "A reader emailed me to ask how they can go about upgrading their current environment without breaking Exchange.\n\nThey are currently running Exchange Server 2000 with Windows Server 2000 domain controllers, and wish to transition to Exchange Server 2007 and Windows Server 2008 domain controllers.\n\nAlthough you can transition from Exchange 2000 to 2007 the problem in this case is the move from Windows Server 2000 to Windows Server 2008. Exchange 2000 will not work with Windows Server 2008 domain controllers, and Exchange 2007 will not work with Windows Server 2000 domain controllers.\n\nFrom Microsoft:\n\nExchange 2000 Server Service Pack 3 and all previous versions of Microsoft Exchange are not for use with Windows Server 2008 directory servers. The following restrictions apply with respect to Exchange 2000 Server Service Pack 3:\n\nExchange 2000 Server Service Pack 3 can exist in an Active Directory forest that contains Windows Server 2008 directory servers, but Windows Server 2008 directory servers should not be installed in Active Directory Sites that contain Exchange 2000 Server.\n\nIf Windows Server 2008 directory servers must be deployed Active Directory Sites that contain Exchange 2000 Server you must first hard-code directory service access (DSAccess) on the Exchange 2000 Server servers in the site to point to directory servers running Windows Server 2003 or Windows 2000 Server.\n\nIn other words, at some point the reader will need to install a Windows Server 2003 domain controller to make the whole transition possible.\n\nMy recommendation is to use these general steps:"
