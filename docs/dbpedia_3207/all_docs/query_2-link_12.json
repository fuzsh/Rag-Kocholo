        "text": "Which prevents the use of the USB Ports for Data Storage Devices.\n\nThere was a Featured Article written here recently by Sonja about using GP’s to disable the USB Ports in 2003 and on the connected computers. Granted this applied to the more convention networks where they had Computers as workstations and not Thin Clients but the over all thing is the same it’s just that the available USB Ports have to be recognised as Usable by the Server which is what the OS is effectively running on when Thin Clients are involved as they are just an extension of the Servers Hardware.\n\nIf you haven’t deliberately used some GP to disable USB Ports that are not being used by Keyboards you may have to use a GP to enable them on the Thin Clients that you want this option on.\n\nSorry but I haven’t worked with Dumb Terminals since the main frame days and that was quite some time ago and there where no USB Ports way back then. But I had one government office in the Rural area that was constantly falling over and that was because they had a Data input operator who could type faster than the system could handle the input and cause it to crash. So whenever she wanted a break she would crash the System and then walk away for about 30 minutes and do as she liked and leave the local Techs to fix up the mess. Of course when I was brought in to find the problem she never did anything so I was being driven nuts by a system that was working perfectly when I was there but falling over several times a day when the IT Section of the Government was administering it.\n\nIn the end I eventually caught her out but it wasn’t easy.\n\nCol"
