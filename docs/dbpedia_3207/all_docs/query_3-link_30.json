It is important that all users who run version cpg1.5.46 or older update to this latest version as soon as possible.\n\n[more]\n\nHTML5 multi-file upload plugin\n\n+ 18 February 2013\n\nWith many thanks to our community user ron4mac, the creator of this plugin, we present a great new HTML5 uploader. With drag and drop facility and concurrent uploads this is a superb addition to Coppermine 1.5.x Currently it supports most modern browsers with the exception being IE versions 9 and older but if you have IE10, Firefox, Safari, Chrome or one of many others this is a superb way to upload all your files.\n\n[more]\n\nSupport for 1.4.x to cease soon\n\n+ 6 September 2010\n\nAfter many moons of faithfull service the time has to come when we wave goodbye to Coppermine 1.4.x. With the new all singing 1.5.x line we feel we have the best, fully featured and secure package we can have. With a small support team we can only realistically spend time on supporting the latest version. As such we have decided to give you all plenty of notice that we will lay the 1.4.x line to rest.\n\n[more]\n\ncpg1.4.27 Security release - upgrade mandatory!\n\n+ 25 May 2010\n\nThe Coppermine development team is releasing a security update for Coppermine in order to counter a recently discovered vulnerability. It is important that all users who run version cpg1.4.26 or older update to this latest version as soon as possible.\n\n[more]"
