Gave him all\n\nmy .dmp files, and it turns out my problem is one MS knows about and\n\nare preparing a hotfix for. They sent me the hotfix and I also made\n\nthe registry change outlined in the KB article below. This KB isn't\n\nup yet last I checked:\n\nKB948289\n\nSYMPTOMS\n\nYou may receive a Stop error message that resembles the following on a\n\nWindows Server 2003-based computer:\n\nSTOP: 0x00000019 ( parameter1 , parameter2 , parameter3 , parameter4 )\n\nNotes\n\n•\n\nThe parameters in this Stop error message vary, depending on the\n\nconfiguration of the computer and on the type of the issue.\n\n•\n\nNot all \"0x00000019\" Stop errors are caused by this problem.\n\nCAUSE\n\nThis problem occurs because the pool memory is unexpectedly corrupted.\n\nThis problem occurs when the NTFS file system creates a name in the\n\n8.3 name format for a file that has a long file name.\n\nWORKAROUND\n\nTo work around this problem, disable 8.3 name creation. To do this,\n\nuse one of the following methods.\n\nMethod 1\n\n1.\n\nRun the following command at a command prompt:\n\nfsutil behavior set disable8dot3 1\n\n2.\n\nRestart the computer.\n\nMethod 2\n\nImportant This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you\n\nhow to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if\n\nyou modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you\n\nfollow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the\n\nregistry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a\n\nproblem occurs.
