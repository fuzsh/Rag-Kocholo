        "text": "I compiled a list of the default Windows XP desktop background wallpapers. XP was everywhere when I was getting my start on the web. Windows XP & its lovable desktop backgrounds helped shape the designer I am today, much the way the house in which I grew up shaped my personality.\n\nQuick note: if you’re looking for more stuff like this, please check out my company’s website: Mxt Media & Central MA SEO. Thanks!\n\n[blog_stripe]\n\n1. Ascent\n\nI don’t know what mountain this is, though it’s probably a famous one. The photography is nice & the scale of the moon is impressive, but I just don’t love this one.\n\nAs a background image, the photo is effective. It has muted colors & low-contrast and viewing desktop icons atop this image is perfectly easy.\n\n[/blog_stripe]\n\n2. Autumn\n\nI love this photo. I grew up in New England, so scenes like this always make me smile. This view might as well have been down the road from my parents’ house.\n\nAs a desktop background, however, this image is a pain. The color contrast is so high that desktop icons are lost easily. The image’s saving grace is the dark tree trunk at left which housed most people’s left-side-oriented icons.\n\n[blog_stripe]\n\n3. Azul\n\nThis is a very happy photo. I can’t help but visualize myself swimming in the perfect blue water (do islands like that really exist?)\n\nAs a wallpaper, this image does fairly well. The all-blue scenery makes for a mostly-consistent work area where icons & windows appear well.\n\n[/blog_stripe]\n\n4. Bliss\n\nThis scene might be the most iconic of all XP wallpapers. If memory serves, this image was the default wallpaper. And it’s aptly named; “bliss” sounds just about right. (However, have you ever seen a sky that blue? Easy on the retouching, Redmond).\n\nI’m probably biased, but I think this might be the perfect desktop background. It has enough color & contrast to be beautiful, but enough consistency to make browsing a pleasure.\n\n[blog_stripe]\n\n5. Crystal\n\nThis wallpaper must have been the activated background on every high school & college PC lab machine I ever saw. And I like it.\n\nAs a desktop, it’s perfect. Shades of blue that stay out of your way but don’t bore you.\n\n[/blog_stripe]\n\n6. Follow\n\nEnter: college freshman girls. I think every single girl in my dorm had this as their background. But isn’t that the same small fish, pasted in 6 times?\n\nIt’s a good wallpaper. Mostly-blue backgrounds are becoming a theme. But its splashes of orange are a little much contrast for me.\n\n[blog_stripe]\n\n7. Friend\n\nMy wife loves this one. And who could blame her? An adorable dog & rustic scene, shot in pantone. It’s a winning combination.\n\nAs a desktop background, it’s perfect. It has color, but still a black & white feel, making the colored icons a perfect contrast.\n\n[/blog_stripe]\n\n8. Home\n\nBoring. Blah. That’s all I have to say. I hate this one.\n\n[blog_stripe]\n\n9. Moon flower\n\nAnyone who could keep this as their desktop wallpaper for more than a few minutes is blind or crazy. It almost hurts to look at.\n\nWere it not for the overpowering color & contrast in the whole image, this background would be ok. But it’s just too much.\n\n[/blog_stripe]\n\n10. Peace\n\nThis is the best wallpaper Windows has ever had. It’s simple, elegant, and classic. I have always found this image very inspiring. I even tweeted about it back in 2011 (around the time I wrote this article).\n\nYou can’t mess with perfection. All the detail of this image is away from the left-side icon stack that most users had. It’s perfectly quiet & beautiful.\n\n[blog_stripe]\n\n11. Power\n\nOuch. Please keep scrolling.\n\n[/blog_stripe]\n\n12. Purple flower\n\nI don’t remember seeing this one, but there it was in my old XP machine’s display preferences. I guess it’s ok. No major complaints from me.\n\n[blog_stripe]\n\n13. Radiance\n\nI like this one too. I don’t think I ever used it as my background, but it’s a nice photo. I’m a fan of darker desktops, so this one is right up my alley.\n\nLike Autumn above, this one places its dark shadow strip strategically in the left-side icon stack area. The light moon areas a bit high-contrast, but overall this one works for me.\n\n[/blog_stripe]\n\n14. Red moon desert\n\nI can’t help but see this wallpaper as an opposite to Bliss. The red tint of the sand is a bit much for me, but it’s a really nice photo.\n\nI’m sensing a theme of keeping the images’ left sides darker, to provide better contrast for icons. This one does a decent job at that.\n\n[blog_stripe]\n\n15. Ripples\n\nSee: Crystal.\n\n[/blog_stripe]\n\n16. Stonehenge\n\nI find Stonehenge fascinating, so I’ve always loved this photo (did you know there are other henges?). It’s a good compliment to Bliss, though the colors aren’t quite as happy.\n\nLike Bliss, this wallpaper has great color & contrast. A very good desktop background.\n\n[blog_stripe]\n\n17. Tulips\n\nAnother college freshman girl favorite. If Follow didn’t win the battle for the pink & green dorm rooms, Tulips usually did. But I must admit, it’s a beautiful photo.\n\nThis wallpaper is tough, though. It has too many colors in the main icon stack area for me. I’d prefer if the last tulip or two were removed.\n\n[/blog_stripe]\n\n18. Vortec space\n\nThis one feels like a throwback to Windows 95/98’s shooting star screensaver. I can’t help but look into its center.\n\nOther than the obviously distracting center, this wallpaper holds up well. It has good color & contrast and a dark left-side icon stack area.\n\n[blog_stripe]\n\n19. Wind\n\nMicrosoft seems to love hills. This photo is a little boring, but it’s pretty.\n\nThis desktop works well too. The left-side icon stack is almost all orange/tan. Great color & contrast where it counts.\n\n[/blog_stripe]\n\n20. Windows XP\n\nNo one used this background except boring IT departments. I’m convinced of it.\n\n[blog_stripe]\n\nDid I miss any? What are your favorites?\n\nDo you agree that Peace is the greatest desktop background Windows has ever had? Or are you more of an Autumn/Follow/Tulips kind of person?\n\n[/blog_stripe]"
