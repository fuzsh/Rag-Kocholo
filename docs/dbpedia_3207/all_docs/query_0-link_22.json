        "text": "After I reboot my server, everything is fine for about 3 days. After 3 days\n\nit starts logging:\n\nEvent Type: Error\n\nEvent Source: Userenv\n\nEvent Category: None\n\nEvent ID: 1053\n\nDate: 11/11/2007\n\nTime: 4:48:28 PM\n\nUser: NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\n\nComputer: <server name>\n\nDescription:\n\nWindows cannot determine the user or computer name. (Not enough storage is\n\navailable to complete this operation. ). Group Policy processing aborted.\n\nwhen that starts, I can't RDP into the server and if I try I get a pop-up\n\nmessage stating \"The system can not log you on due to the following error:\n\nThe RPC server is not avaiable.\" which causes the following event to be\n\nlogged in the System log:\n\nEvent Type: Error\n\nEvent Source: NETLOGON\n\nEvent Category: None\n\nEvent ID: 5719\n\nDate: 11/12/2007\n\nTime: 1:51:17 PM\n\nUser: N/A\n\nComputer: <server name>\n\nDescription:\n\nThis computer was not able to set up a secure session with a domain\n\ncontroller in domain ACADEMIC due to the following:\n\nNot enough storage is available to process this command.\n\nThis may lead to authentication problems. Make sure that this computer is\n\nconnected to the network. If the problem persists, please contact your domain\n\nadministrator.\n\nADDITIONAL INFO\n\nIf this computer is a domain controller for the specified domain, it sets up\n\nthe secure session to the primary domain controller emulator in the specified\n\ndomain. Otherwise, this computer sets up the secure session to any domain\n\ncontroller in the specified domain.\n\nSteps I've already taken to eliminate the problem:\n\nUpdated NIC drivers.\n\nDeleted current DNS records and created new ones.\n\nHard set NIC speed to 100MB Full Duplex.\n\nTurned of TOE on the NIC.\n\nChanged out motherboard thinking it was a NIC hardware issue after Dell\n\nsupport tried helping me.\n\nThe server is a Windows Server 2003 SP2 machine, firewall is turned off, no\n\nspecial software loaded other than a language teaching software. The server\n\nwas running fine when we first put it into to production about 2 years ago\n\nand then about a year later it start generating these errors."
