Windows Server 2003 build 3676 is a build of Windows Server 2003. The Enterprise Server SKU was uploaded on 12 June 2022, although the available ISO image is corrupted and has all of its file offsets misaligned (from I386\ADMINPK.CH_ onwards) along with additional RAR headers scattered throughout the file, with the only recoverable file being I386\DRIVER.CAB.

The build was originally scene leaked by warez group WiNBETA on 8 September 2002, followed by several websites hosting screenshots of the build itself; these images are currently lost and were not archived.[1] A few screenshots are currently available on BetaArchive.[2]
