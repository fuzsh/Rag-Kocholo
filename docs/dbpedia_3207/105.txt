Windows Server 2003 build 3615 is a build of Windows Server 2003, which is available in the Enterprise Server, Standard Server and Web Server SKUs. The full ISO image of the Enterprise SKU was shared on the Internet Archive on 11 June 2022,[1] although the Standard and Web SKUs are only available as largely corrupt disc dumps.

Prior to the full build's upload, an image of this build's Enterprise SKU was shared by BetaArchive user KenOath.

Changes

The copyright date of winver.exe has been updated from 2001 to 2002. This persists up to Windows Server 2003 build 3689.

This build replaces Windows Welcome Music with "No Hay Problema", which would become Windows Server 2003's unused OOBE music.

Bugs and quirks

Attempting to open the Windows Explorer interface will result in the user being asked to set Internet Explorer as their default browser.

System Properties and winver oddly identify themselves as having Service Pack 1 installed. This can be fixed by navigating to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlCurrentSet\Control\Windows and setting the CSDVersion key to 0 in Registry Editor.
