Microsoft Windows Photo Viewer

Software Overview

Windows Photo Viewer is an image viewing program bundled with Windows 7 and later. It replaces Windows Picture and Fax Viewer, which was included with Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

Photo Viewer provides an easy method of quickly viewing image files. If it is the default program for opening image files, all you need to do is double click the file you wish to view. It allows you to rotate images in 90 degree increments and automatically saves the changes.

If you are working on a Windows computer and need to view an image file, Windows Photo Viewer is a quick and easy option. If you need advanced image editing capabilities, there are other free tools that may better suit your needs.
