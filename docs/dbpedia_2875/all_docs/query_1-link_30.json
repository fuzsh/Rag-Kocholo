        "text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nFor other meanings of the word, see Manila (disambiguation). For the greater metropolitan area, see Metro Manila.\n\nThe City of Manila (Filipino: Lungsod ng Maynila), or simply Manila, is the capital of the Philippines and one of the municipalities that comprise Metro Manila. The city is located on the eastern shore of Manila Bay on Luzon, the country's largest island.\n\nManila is the hub of a thriving metropolitan area home to over 10 million people. The Metro Manila area also known as the National Capital Region (NCR), of which the City of Manila is a part, is a much bigger metropolis consisting of 17 cities and municipalities. This article discusses the city itself; see Metro Manila for the article on the metropolis.\n\nManila is the second most populous city proper in the Philippines, with more than 1.5 million inhabitants. Only nearby Quezon City, the country's former capital, is more populous. Manila is currently included in the roster of global cities of the world.\n\nManila got its name from may nilad, Tagalog for \"there is nilad,\" in reference to the flowering mangrove plant that grew on the marshy shores of the bay. In the 16th century, Manila (then Maynilad) grew from an Arab settlement on the banks of the Pasig River into the seat of the colonial government of Spain when it controlled the Philippine Islands for over three centuries from 1565 to 1898. Beginning in 1898, the United States occupied and controlled the city and the Philippine archipelago until 1946. During World War II, much of the city was destroyed. The Metropolitan Manila region was enacted as an independent entity in 1975. Today, the city and the metropolis thrive as an important cultural and economic center. However, overpopulation, traffic congestion, pollution, and crime challenge the city.\n\nManila has been classified as a \"Gamma\" global city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network.

It lies about 950 kilometers southeast of Hong Kong and 2,400 kilometers northeast of Singapore. The river bisects the city in the middle. Almost all of the city sits on top of centuries of prehistoric alluvial deposits built by the waters of the Pasig River and on some land reclaimed from Manila Bay. The layout of the city was haphazardly planned during Spanish Era as a set of communities surrounding the original Spanish Era walled city of Manila, called Intramuros. Intramuros is one of the oldest walled cities in the far east. During the American Period, some semblance of city planning using the architectural designs by Daniel Burnham, was done on the portions of the city south of the Pasig River.\n\nCity planning projects did not stop at Chicago though; Burnham helped shape cities such as Cleveland (the Group Plan), San Francisco, Washington, DC (the McMillan Plan), and Manila and Baguio in the Philippines, details of which appear in The Chicago Plan publication of 1909.**\n\nManila is bordered by several municipalities and cities in Metro Manila: Navotas and Caloocan City to the north, Quezon City to the northeast, San Juan and Mandaluyong City to the east, Makati City to the southeast, and Pasay City to the south.\n\n[edit] City seal\n\nThe Seal of Maynila depicts the words Lungsod ng Maynila and Pilipinas, Filipino for City of Manila and Philippines, in a circle around a shield. The circle also contains six yellow stars representing the city's six congressional districts. The shield, in the shape of pre-colonial people's shield, depicts the city's nickname Pearl of the Orient on top; a sea lion in the middle, in reference to the city's Spanish influences; and the waves of the Pasig River and Manila Bay in the bottom portion. The colors of the seal mirror that of the Flag of the Philippines.\n\n[edit] Districts\n\nThe city is divided into sixteen (16) districts. Only one district was not an original town - Port Area. Eight (8) districts are located north of the Pasig River and eight (8) are in the south. San Andres Bukid was previously part of Santa Ana, while Santa Mesa was once a part of Sampaloc.\n\nNorth of Pasig River\n\nBinondo\n\nQuiapo\n\nSampaloc\n\nSan Miguel\n\nSan Nicolas\n\nSanta Cruz\n\nSanta Mesa\n\nTondo\n\nSouth of Pasig River\n\nErmita\n\nIntramuros\n\nMalate\n\nPaco\n\nPandacan\n\nPort Area\n\nSan Andres Bukid\n\nSta. Ana\n\nAll of these districts, with the exception of Port Area, have their own churches, and several of these districts have achieved recognition in their own right. Intramuros being the old and original enclave of Manila is a historical site. The district of Binondo is the city's Chinatown. Tondo is the densest in terms of population, the largest in land area and also with the highest poverty level. The districts of Ermita and Malate are well-known and popular with tourists, having many bars, restaurants, five-star hotels, and shopping malls while the districts of San Miguel and Pandacan hosts the official residence of the President of the country, MalacaÃ±ang Palace.\n\n[edit] National Government Offices\n\nThe City of Manila is the capital of the Philippines and is also the seat of political power in the country. During the early years of the American colonial government, they envisioned a well designed city outside the walls of Intramuros. In nearby \"Bagumbayan\" or what is now Rizal Park, was chosen to become the center of government and a design commission was given to Daniel Burnham to create a master plan for the city patterned after Washington D.C.\n\nEventually, under the Commonwealth Government of Manuel L. Quezon, a new government center was to be built on the hills northeast of Manila, or what is now Quezon City. Several government agencies have set-up base in Quezon City but several key government offices are in Manila such as, the Office of the Philippine President, the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the Departments of Budget, Finance, Health, Justice, Labor & Employment, and Tourism.\n\n[edit] Parks and open areas\n\nDirectly south of Intramuros lies Rizal Park, the country's most significant park. Also known as Luneta (Spanish term for \"crescent-shaped\") and previously as Bagumbayan, the 60 hectare Rizal Park sits on the site where JosÃ© Rizal, the country's national hero, was executed by the Spaniards on charges of subversion. A monument stands in his honor where Rizal's remains were buried. The big flagpole west of the Rizal Monument is the Kilometer Zero for road distances on the island of Luzon and the rest of the country.\n\nOther attractions in Rizal Park include the Chinese and Japanese Gardens, the Department of Tourism building, the National Museum of the Philippines, The National Library of the Philippines, the Planetarium, the Orchidarium and Butterfly Pavilion, an open-air auditorium for cultural performances, a relief map of the Philippines, a fountain area, a children's lagoon, a chess plaza, a light and sound presentation, and the Quirino Grandstand.\n\nAnother famous open space in Manila is the Baywalk. This promenade lies in front of the Manila Bay where one can experience one of the most breathtaking sunsets of the world. Coconut trees, giant kaleidoscopic lamp posts, al fresco cafÃ¨s and restaurants, and live acoustic bands dot this two-kilometer stretch of ample space beside Roxas Boulevard.\n\nAside from Rizal Park, Manila has very few other open public spaces. Rajah Sulayman Park, Manila Boardwalk, Liwasang Bonifacio, Plaza Miranda, Paco Park, Remedios Circle, Manila Zoological and Botanical Garden, Plaza Balagtas and the MalacaÃ±ang Garden are some of the other parks in the city. In 2005, Mayor Lito Atienza opened the Pandacan Linear Park, a strip of land that served as a buffer zone between the oil depot and the residential-commercial properties in Pandacan and could be found along the banks of the Pasig River. In the northern most part of the city lies the three cemeteries of Loyola, Chinese, and Manila North Green Park, the largest public cemetery in Metropolitan Manila.\n\n[edit] People\n\n[edit] Demographics\n\n[edit] Ethnic groups\n\nThe original settlers of Manila were the Tagalogs. Throughout the centuries, there has been a constant migration of Visayans, Bicolanos, Ilocanos, Maranaos, Pampangans, Chinese, Japanese, and Spaniards. There are also Americans, Arabs, Indonesians, Indians, and Koreans in Manila. Intermarriage between ethnic groups is not uncommon in the Philippines.\n\nThere are 3 distinct local ethnic groups in Manila. The natives, the Chinese, and the Spanish. The Chinese and Spanish groups, companies and families control most political and financial institutions.\n\n[edit] Population density\n\nWith a population of 1,581,082 and a land area of 38.55 kmÂ², it has the highest population density of any major city in the world with 41,014 people/kmÂ² (with district 6 being the most dense with 68,266, followed by the first two districts (Tondo) with 64,936 and 64,710, respectively, and district 5 being the least dense with 19,235). A million more transients are added during daytime as students and workers come to the city.\n\nManila's population density dwarfs that of Paris (20,164 inhabitants per kmÂ²), Shanghai (16,364 people/kmÂ², with its most dense district of Nanshi's 56,785 density), Buenos Aires (2,179 people/kmÂ², with its most dense inner suburb Lanus' 10,444 density), Tokyo (10,087 people/kmÂ²), Mexico City (11,700 people/kmÂ²), and Istanbul (1,878 people/kmÂ², with its most dense district Fatih's 48,173 density).\n\n[edit] Languages\n\nThe vernacular language is Tagalog, while Filipino and English are the languages used in education and business throughout the Metro Manila region.\n\n[edit] Religion\n\n[edit] Roman Catholicism\n\nManila is the seat of the Archdiocese of Manila and the Primate of the Philippines. Being the seat of the Spanish colonial government in past centuries, it has been used as the base of numerous Roman Catholic missions to the Philippines. Among the religious orders that have gone to the Philippines include the Dominicans, the Jesuits, the Franciscans, and the Augustinians (which includes the Augustinian Recollects).\n\nIntramuros is currently the seat of the Archdiocese of Manila, the oldest archdiocese in the country. The archdiocese's offices is located in the Manila Cathedral (Basilica Minore de la Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la Immaculada Concepcion) in Intramuros.\n\nOther notable churches and cathedrals in the city include San Agustin Church in Intramuros, a UN World Heritage Site is a favorite wedding place of notable people and one of two fully air-conditioned churches in the city; Quiapo Church, also known as the Basilica Minore del Nazareno Negro, site of the annual January Black Nazarene procession; Binondo Church, also known as Basilica Minore de St. Lorenzo Ruiz; Malate Church (Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Remedios); and San Sebastian Church or the Basilica Minore de San Sebastian, the only all-steel church in Gothic style in Asia. Many of the other districts of Manila have their own notable churches.\n\n[edit] Other faiths\n\nThere are many Buddhist and Taoist temples built by the Chinese community in Manila. The Quiapo district is home to a sizable Muslim population in Manila, and The Golden Mosque is located there. In Ermita is a large Hindu temple for the Indian population, while on U.N. Avenue, there is a Sikh Temple. There is also an LDS temple. In Malate, along Quirino Avenue, there once was a synagogue for the small Jewish community in the Philippines. (See Jews in the Philippines.)\n\n[edit] Education and culture\n\nMain articles: Education in the Philippines and List of colleges and universities in the Philippines\n\nManila is home to the majority of the colleges and universities in Metro Manila. The University Belt or U-Belt, informally located in the districts of Malate, Ermita, Intramuros, San Miquel, Quiapo, and Sampaloc is the colloquial term for the high concentration of institutions of higher education that are located in these districts. Among them are private school De La Salle University-Manila in Malate, the private schools Far Eastern University and University of Santo Tomas in Sampaloc, and the city-owned Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila at Intramuros\n\nThe city also plays host to the Manila Science High School, the forerunner of the country's science high schools, the National Museum of the Philippines, where the Spoliarium of Juan Luna is housed, the Metropolitan Museum, the Museong Pambata (Children's Museum), as well as the National Library, located within Rizal Park.\n\n[edit] Economy\n\n[edit] Commerce\n\nEvery district in the city with the exception of Port Area has its own public market, locally called the pamilihang bayan or Palengke. Public markets are often divided into two, the dry goods section and the wet goods section. Commerce in these public markets is lively, especially in the early morning. Under the urban renewal program of the incumbent administration, some of the public markets had been refurbished and given a fresher look, like the Sta. Ana public market. It is one of the more advanced markets in the city featuring a modern 2-story building with an escalator.\n\nThe tropical climate in Manila plus the facilities of its world-class malls continue to attract Filipinos to the shopping malls. Modern shopping malls dot the city especially in the areas of Malate and Ermita. SM City Manila, part of the country's largest chain of malls, stands behind the Manila City Hall, while the original SM Department store still operates in Carriedo in Sta. Cruz while another called SM Centrepoint is located north east of the city in Sta. Mesa close to the Quezon City-San Juan boundary. One of the popular malls that lies at the heart of Manila is Robinson's Place Ermita. In the southern part of the city in Malate district is Harrison Plaza, one of the city's oldest shopping malls.\n\nFor the adventurous shoppers, you may venture beyond the hotel/shopping complex package and combine other interesting destinations for cheap buys such as in Divisoria and Quiapo districts. Bargaining is the major part of your shopping experience when you pass by on these areas, as it sells goods at rock-bottom prices. In Divisoria, there is already a shopping mall that caters to the adventurous shoppers. Tutuban Center in Divisoria gives a little comfort to the shoppers as it offers air-conditioned mall, but the price of the goods here is still very similar to the goods bought outside. In Quiapo, one unique spot is the marketplace under the bridge. It sells indigenous Filipino crafts and delicacies. Raon Center is famous for its cheap electronic products. Though through the changing times, department stores began sprouting the Quiapo area, but still the flea market of Quiapo is still vibrant and very much popular among the average Filipinos. Photo and video enthusiasts looking for cheap equipment can proceed to R. Hidalgo street in the Quiapo district.\n\n[edit] Manufacturing\n\n[edit] Historical Perspective\n\nThe establishment of the country's manufacturing base centered around the not so distant districts of Manila during the Spanish colonial times. During the arrival of the Americans by the turn of the 20th century, Manila's manufacturing base expanded and diversified into different areas and interests.\n\nThe district of Tondo due to its proximity to the Manila North and South Harbor became a center for several manufacturing facilities and the district of Pandacan and portions of Paco nearest to the banks of the Pasig River served as centers for manufacturing in the city.\n\nManila during the Spanish period was well-known for its quality tobacco production by the Manila Tabacalera Company which had its manufacturing and production base along Tayuman street in Tondo. Philippine food and beverage giant San Miguel Corporation first started its beer brewing production along San Miguel district. The old brewing building for San Miguel is now within the high security enclave of MalacaÃ±an Palace grounds. Nearby the old San Miguel brewery was the Manila Ice Plant and portions of its old building now houses the Department of Budget and Management. Tanduay Distilleries, a manufacturer of rhum still operates its facilities in the San Miguel district while its rival La TondeÃ±a which had its production facilities in nearby Quiapo district has scaled down its operations.\n\nTondo was base for food manufacturing by the 1920s and several American companies established plants in the area. The Philippine Manufacturing Company or PMC established production of various products derived from coconut oil ranging from cooling oil to soaps and toiletries. The Philippine Manufacturing Company would later become Procter and Gamble Philippines and in the late 1980s, production from within the crowded Tondo area was gradually phased down and moved to areas outside of Metro Manila.\n\nPMC's rival company, the Philippine Refining Company or PRC established its based of operations five kilometers upstream of the Pasig River in Paco district, along the United Nations Avenue, near Isla de Provisor. PRC was also engaged in the manufacture of product derivatives from coconut oil. In the 1990s, Philippine Refining Company changed its corporate name as part of the global strategy of company brand recognition and is now called Unilever Philippines.\n\nThe United Nation's Avenue near the corner of Romualdez street used to be the mini Detroit in the 1930s when the Ford Motor Company established its first assembly plant in the area. The plant facility remains standing and it houses the government office issuing the seaman's passbook.\n\nAmerican owned oil companies in the 1930s like Esso, Mobil Oil and Filipino Oil or FilOil established their oil distribution and lube facilities along the banks of the Pasig River in Pandacan district, at a time when the area was largely a farm village. after almost a century of operations, the fuel distribution and manufacturing facilities are gradually being removed due to its potential security and safety risk to the highly dense population in the area.\n\nCoca Cola still operates its bottling plant in Pandacan but its plant operations is more focused on product distribution into the Metro Manila franchise area.\n\nSeveral key and notable manufacturing facilities in the City of Manila closed down through the years especially after 1980s. The country's then largest copra milling company at the boundary of Paco and Pandacan district closed down and its plant site is now a middle class town house facility. The depot of the Philippines only gas company with pipelines servicing every home, the Manila Gas Company ceased operations in the 1980s after a protracted legal battle on ownership issue and its facilities were torn down as the 5.5 hectare Manila Gas property is now being converted into a mixed condominium and commercial tower.\n\n[edit] Transportation\n\n[edit] Air\n\nNinoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), outside the city proper, serves Manila and the metro area. Over 40 airlines provide daily service to over 26 cities and 19 countries worldwide. Approximately 17 million travellers use NAIA a year, straining what was originally a domestic airport built in the 1930s. A second terminal, Terminal 2 (or the Centennial Terminal) opened in October 1999. The International flag-carrier Philippine Airlines now uses this terminal exclusively for both its domestic and international service while all other international flights use the original NAIA terminal. Air Philippines is in the transition to the newer Terminal 2 alongside PAL. A third terminal was nearly completed until a controversy was discovered by the current Arroyo administration that prompted a series of investigations and international court battle with the builders and the Philippine government.\n\nThe main carrier serving NAIA is Philippine Airlines, which has the most extensive network in the Philippines. Newly repackaged Cebu Pacific Air, which uses all A320 aircraft and promotes online booking, positions itself as the first true discount airline in the country. Air Philippines, a subsidiary of Philippine Airlines, competes with Cebu Pacific in the budget market and the inter-provinces routes. Asian Spirit and South East Asian Airlines, which use smaller 48-seat planes, are some of the smaller airlines serving the city of Manila.\n\nAnother alternative point of embarkation and disembarkation is Diosdado Macapagal International Airport in the Clark Special Economic Zone. As of October 2006, scheduled flights from Singapore, Hong Kong, Macau, Seoul, Kota Kinabalu, and Kuala Lumpur, and chartered flights from Shanghai and Taipei use this small airport because of its cheaper landing and parking fees. A mediocre shuttle system serves Clark and Manila. Travellers depart from this airport will have to pay 500 peso departure tax from end of 2006.\n\n[edit] Roads\n\nMain article: Major roads in Metro Manila\n\nThe main roads of Metro Manila are organized around a set of radial and circumferential roads that radiate and circle in and around Manila proper. Roxas Boulevard, easily the most well-known of Manila's streets, line the southern shores of Manila with Manila Bay. The boulevard is part of the Radial Road 1 that leads south to the province of Cavite. Another well-known radial road is EspaÃ±a Boulevard (part of Radial Road 7) that starts in Quiapo and ends at the Welcome Rotunda along the border with Quezon City. Pres. Sergio OsmeÃ±a Sr. Highway, part of the South Luzon Expressway or Radial Road 3 is the most important highway linking Manila with the provinces of southern Luzon.\n\nThe most common types of public transportation are buses and the jeepney. Tricycles are used for short distances. Pedicabs are bicycles attached with sidecars, where the drivers uses foot pedals to propel the vehicle.\n\nClaro M. Recto Avenue (San Nicolas to Quiapo)\n\nEscolta (Paco)\n\nEspaÃ±a Boulevard (Sampaloc to Quezon City)\n\nMendiola Street\n\nRizal Avenue (Quiapo to Caloocan City)\n\nRoxas Boulevard (San Nicolas to Talisay, Batangas)\n\nTaft Avenue (Ermita to Paranaque City)\n\nQuezon Boulevard (Ermita to Sampaloc)\n\nUnited Nation's Avenue (Paco to Ermita)\n\n[edit] Bridges\n\nThere are eight (8) major bridge spans in Manila, more than half of the number of bridges that connects the north and south banks of the Pasig River in Metro Manila. There are two (2) rail bridges that crosses the river, the Light Rail Transit 1 and the Philippine National Railways track. The bridges listed below are in a west to east order, with the first bridge Del Pan, nearest to the mouth of the Pasig River into Manila Bay.\n\nRoxas bridge - formerly called Del Pan (San Nicolas to Port Area)\n\nJones bridge (Binondo to Ermita)\n\nMcArthur bridge (Santa Cruz to Ermita)\n\nLRT 1 (Carriedo station to Central station)\n\nQuezon bridge (Quiapo to Ermita)\n\nAyala bridge (San Miguel to Ermita)\n\nMabini bridge - formerly called Nagtahan bridge (Santa Mesa to Pandacan)\n\nPhilippine National Railways (Santa Mesa station to Pandacan station)\n\nPadre Zamora bridge (Santa Mesa to Pandacan)\n\nLambingan bridge (Sta. Ana)\n\n[edit] Rail transport\n\nManila is the hub of a railway system on Luzon. The main terminal of the Philippine National Railways is in the Tondo district. Railways extend from this terminal north to the city of San Fernando in Pampanga and south to Legazpi City in Albay, though only the southern railway is currently in operation.\n\nManila is also serviced by the Manila Light Rail Transit System (separate from Manila Metro Rail Transit System), a national priority project designed to address the overwhelming traffic that congests the national capital. Development of the system began with its inception in the 1970s under the Marcos administration, making it the first light rail transport in Southeast Asia. Recently, the system saw a massive multi-billion dollar expansion in correlation with the rising population of the city; its purpose: to create an alternative form of transportation to solve the demand of an increasingly mobile workforce. After three decades in service, the project has enjoyed an insurmountable success, with favorable opinions from commuters, mainly because of its extremely low fares that is subsidized by the national government. Two lines service the city dwellers and they run along the length of Taft Avenue (R-2) and Rizal Avenue (R-9). A second line runs along Ramon Magsaysay Blvd (R-6) from Santa Cruz, through Quezon City, up to Santolan in Pasig City.\n\nThese are the major rail systems, with their station within Manila:\n\nLRT 1: R. Papa, J. Abad Santos, Blumentritt, Tayuman, Bambang, D. Jose, Carriedo, Central Station, UN Ave., P. Gil, Quirino Ave, and Vito Cruz\n\nLRT 2: C.M. Recto, Legarda, Pureza, and V. Mapa\n\nPNR: Vito Cruz, Herran, Pandacan, Sta. Mesa, EspaÃ±a, Laong Laan, Blumentritt and Tutuban.\n\n[edit] Seaports and piers\n\nThe City of Manila is the chief seaport of the Philippines. North Harbor and South Harbor experience busy periods during long holidays such as Holy Week, All Saints Day and the Christmas holidays. The Port of Manila serves the city's commercial needs, it also one of South East Asia's more major ports.\n\n[edit] Communication\n\n[edit] Postal service\n\nThe Philippines central office for its postal service now called Philippine Postal Corporation and it is located at the foot of the Jones Bridge. The main office is housed in a huge art deco style building designed with huge columns at front, built during the American colonial period. The building houses the Philippine Postal Bank and the main mail sorting-distribution operations of the country.\n\n[edit] Print and publication\n\nManila is home to major Philippine newspaper publishers with a number of offices and printing presses located at the Port Area. The news industry is one of the legacies of the American colonization of the Philippines, as they paved the way for the freedom of the press. Some of the major publications based in Manila include the country's oldest newspapers, the Manila Times, the Manila Bulletin, the Philippine Star, the Manila Standard Today, The Daily Tribune and others.\n\n[edit] News agencies\n\nThe city serves as host to a number of news and information offices, agencies or services that includes the Office of the Press Secretary and Radio-TV MalacaÃ±ang or RTVM (the close-in news team of Philippine Presidents) located at the MalacaÃ±ang Palace grounds.\n\nThe National Press Club's building office is located at the foot of the Jones bridge across the Post Office building and it houses the International Press Center or IPC, a government agency tasked to accredit and grant working permits for visiting foreign agencies.\n\nManila is also home to the prestigious and exclusive organization of journalists called, \"Samahang Plaridel,\" whose members include some of the prominent publishers, editors, reporters of the country.\n\nThe Associated Press, Japan's NHK and Fuji TV, and London-based Global Radio News, Ltd. made Manila as its base of newsgathering operations in the Philippines.\n\n[edit] Utilities\n\n[edit] Electricity and water\n\nManila's source of electricity is part of the central franchise service area of the Manila Electric Company or Meralco. Water supply for the city is supplied by the Maynilad Water Services, except for portions of the district of Sta. Ana which is serviced by the Manila Water.\n\n[edit] Mobile phone, telephone & cable television\n\nThe city's telecommunications infrastructure (landlines) are provided by PLDT, Eastern Telecoms, Bayantel and cellular service providers Smart Communications, Globe Telecom and Sun Cellular cover the city. Cable television access is provided by SkyCABLE and Global Destiny Cable.\n\n[edit] Internet service providers\n\nInternet Digital Subscriber Line or DSL coverage is provided by PLDT, and Eastern Telecoms, cable internet is serviced by Sky Cable's ZPDee brand and by Global Destiny. Wireless broadband is provided by Smart Communications. Availability of services from among the listed providers vary in the various districts of Manila, except in Malate and Ermita where all providers are available. Wi-Fi is also offered in some gas stations and cafÃ©s.\n\n[edit] Government\n\nLike all cities of the Philippines, Manila is governed by a mayor who heads the executive department of the city. The current mayor for the 2007-2010 term is Alfredo Lim, who is making a comeback to the city hall following a 3-year stint as a Senator. The city mayor is restricted for three consecutive terms (nine years), although he can be elected again after an interruption of one term.\n\nIsko Moreno, the city's incumbent vice-mayor heads the legislative arm which is composed of the elected city councilors, six from each of the city's six congressional districts.\n\nThe city is divided into 897 barangays, which are the smallest unit of local government in the Philippines. Each barangay has its own chairperson and councilors. For administrative convenience, all the barangays in Manila are grouped into 100 zones and which are further grouped into 16 administrative districts. These zones and districts have no form of local government.\n\nThe city further has six representatives popularly elected to the House of Representatives, the lower legislative branch of the Philippines.

The name came from the term maynilad, literally \"where there is nilad.\" Nilad is a white-flowered mangrove plant that grew in abundance in the area.\n\nIn the mid-16th century, the area of present-day Manila was governed by three rajahs, or Muslim community leaders. They were Rajah Sulayman and Rajah Matanda who ruled the communities south of the Pasig, and Rajah Lakandula who ruled the community north of the river. Manila was then the northernmost Muslim sultanate in the islands. It held ties with the sultanates of Brunei, Sulu, and Ternate in Cavite.\n\n[edit] Spanish rule\n\nIn 1570, a Spanish expedition ordered by the conquistador Miguel LÃ³pez de Legazpi demanded the conquest of Manila. His second in command, MartÃ­n de Goiti departed from Cebu and arrived in Manila. The Muslim Tagalogs welcomed the foreigners, but Goiti had other plans. The Spanish force of 300 soldiers marched through Manila and a battle was fought with the heavily armed Spaniards quickly defeating the native settlements. Legazpi and his men followed the next year and made a peace pact with the three rajahs and organized a city council consisting of two mayors, 12 councilors, and a secretary. A walled city known as Intramuros, at the southern banks of Pasig River was built to protect the Spanish colonizers. On June 10, 1574, King Philip II of Spain gave Manila the title of Insigne y Siempre Leal Ciudad (\"Distinguished and Ever Loyal City\").\n\nIn 1595, Manila was proclaimed as the capital of the Philippine Islands and became a center of trans-Pacific trade for more than three centuries. For example, the famous Manila galleons sailed between Manila and the port of Acapulco in today's Mexico. These Manila galleons carried silver and other precious metals from the New World to Manila to purchase goods and raw materials from throughout Asia â for example, spices transhipped from the Spice Islands to the south, and porcelain, ivory, lacquerware and processed silk cloth from China and Southeast Asia. Some of these Asian goods were used in Mexico, however, most of the cargo was transhipped across Mexico for delivery to Spain, to be sold in European markets.\n\n[edit] British occupation\n\nThere was a brief British occupation of Manila from 1762-1764 as a result of the Seven Years' War, which was fought between France and England. Spain became a British enemy when it sided with France due to ties between their royal families. The British Occupation was confined to Manila and Cavite while SimÃ³n de Anda y Salazar, acting as a de facto Spanish governor general, kept the countryside for Spain with the help of Filipino soldiers. The Indian soldiers known as Sepoys, who came with the British, deserted in droves and settled in Cainta, Rizal, and explains the uniquely Indian features of generations of Cainta residents. French mercenaries who came with the British also settled in various locations around Manila.[2]\n\n[edit] United States rule\n\nThis article or section may contain original research or unverifiable claims.\n\nPlease help Wikipedia by adding references. See the talk page for details.\n\nU.S. Troops invaded Manila in 1898 and waged war with the Spaniards and Filipinos in the Spanish-American War and the Philippine-American War. Following the defeat of Spain, U.S. forces took control of the city and the islands in one of the most brutal and forgotten chapters of Philippine American history. The Filipinos, having just won their independence from Spain, were fiercely opposed to once again being occupied. They had established the Republic of the Philippines under Aguinaldo in Malolos and had begun to build the foundations for an independent nation. The Americans, who had promised Aguinaldo their support and help in 1898 had struck a deal with the Spanish, in which they would stage a mock battle for the islands in Manila which would establish the Americans as the \"legitimate\" rulers.\n\nAmerican high command was then under the incompetent and unimaginative General Otis. He invaded and immediately routed the Filipino troops who had taken classic defensive positions around Manila to keep them out. These poorly armed, ill-trained soldiers could not compete with the superior firepower of the Americans: they lost and were so severely beaten that the Filipino dead were used as breastworks.\n\nAguinaldo immediately ordered the Filipinos to start fighting a guerilla campaign. They did this with unmitigated success, as they had the support of the peasantry and knew the terrain and language better that the Americans. The Americans became uneasily aware that they were fighting not just one \"tribe\" as they had originally thought, but the entire country, and that their original belief in easy victory was not to be.\n\nOtis was becoming an embarrassment to the McKinley administration as his continual pronouncements of victory were never followed up with success. He was replaced with MacArthur, who with his officials, embarked on a long and bloody campaign. MacArthur once confidentially declared that to subdue the islands would take at least ten years. Officially, it ended after three years, unofficially he was proven right.\n\nOne incident in particular stands out. Howling Jake was one of the American commanders in charge of the pacification of Samar. His words to his troops were infamous, \"Kill and burn, kill and burn. The more you kill and the more you burn, the more you please me.\" When asked who would be spared, he replied, \"Everyone under ten.\"\n\nVillages were burned. People were raped and killed. Filipinos were rounded up and placed in concentration camps where disease and hunger took their toll. They had to sleep standing up in the rain, and those who misbehaved were subjected to water torture. Everyone not in the camp was an enemy and killed. Estimates for the war dead go from 100,000 to a million or more.[3]\n\nIn the Treaty of Paris in 1898, Spain handed over the Philippines to the United States of America for US$ 20,000,000 and ending 333 years of Spanish rule in the islands. [1] [2] [3]\n\nThe headquarters for USAFFE were located here as were the U.S. 31st Infantry Regiment and the U.S. 808th Military Police Company. The headquarters and bulk of the Philippine Division was located just to the south, at Fort William McKinley. The headquarters for the Far East Air Force was on the outskirts of town, at Nielson Field. Nearby, at Nichols Field was the U.S. 20th Air Base Group. A battalion of the U.S. 12th Quartermaster Regiment was located in the port area and training was conducted there for quartermasters of the Philippine Army.\n\nThere were 6 airfields, for the Far East Air Force, within 130 km of Manila, notably Clark, Nichols, and Nielson fields. After Philippine independence, only Clark Field, later Clark Air Base, and a training facility, Camp O'Donnell, remained. All U.S. military and airforce bases were closed down in 1991.\n\n[edit] World War II\n\nAmerican combat units were ordered to withdraw from the city and all military installations removed on December 30, 1941. Manila was declared an open city by President Manuel L. Quezon, to spare the city from death and destruction. Quezon issued a decree enlarging the safe zone to include outlying areas of Manila as safe zones, establishing the new administrative jurisdiction called Greater Manila.\n\nThe post of mayor of Greater Manila was given to Quezon's former Executive Secretary, Jorge B. Vargas. On the evening of New Year's Day of 1942, a Japanese courier delivered notice to Vargas that Japanese forces already bivouacked at ParaÃ±aque would enter Greater Manila the following day. From 9 am to 10 am of January 2, Japanese imperial forces marched into the City of Manila.\n\nVargas was tasked to hand over to the new authorities Greater Manila and present the remaining Filipino leaders to Japanese authorities. Vargas and the Filipino leaders present were asked to choose three options; (1) a purely Japanese military administration, (2) a dictatorial government run by a Filipino under General Artemio Ricarte who went on self-exile to Japan after the Filipino-American war, or (3) a government by commission selected by Filipinos. Vargas and the local leaders chose the third option and established the Philippine Executive Commission to manage initially Greater Manila, and was later expanded to cover the whole of the Philippines.\n\nVargas assumed the chairmanship of the Philippine Executive Commission and appointed to the post of Mayor of Greater Manila in 1942, Leon G. Guinto Sr., a Secretary of Labor under the Philippine Commonwealth administration of President Manuel L. Quezon. Guinto held the position of Mayor of Greater Manila until the liberation of the city.\n\nUnder Guinto's war-time administration, the City of Manila that was expanded to Greater Manila included districts such as; \"Bagumbayan\" means New Town (South of Manila), \"Bagumpanahon\" means New Era (Sampaloc, Quiapo, San Miguel and Santa Cruz), \"Bagumbuhay\" means New Life (Tondo), \"Bagong Diwa\" means New Order (Binondo & San Nicholas), the then newly established Quezon City was collapsed and divided into two districts, while the municipalities of Caloocan, Las PiÃ±as, Malabon, Makati, Mandaluyong, Navotas, ParaÃ±aque, Pasay, and San Juan became districts of Manila.\n\nOn October 20, 1944 American General Douglas MacArthur fulfilled a promise to return to the Philippines (see Battle of Leyte). From February 3 to March 3, 1945, after the climactic battle at Intramuros ended, the thoroughly devastated city of Manila was officially liberated. Allied troops did not reach the city in time to prevent the Manila Massacre though.\n\n[edit] Manila and security\n\nManila has been subject to militant attacks. The metropolis have been targeted twice by groups Moro Islamic Liberation Front and Abu Sayyaf. In addition, Al-Qaida cells have been discovered in the metropolis.\n\nProject Bojinka, which was a large-scale attack being planned in late 1994 and early 1995, was being planned in Manila. The project was abandoned after the night of January 6, 1995 and the morning of January 7, when an apartment fire led investigators to a laptop computer containing the plans.\n\n[edit] Sister cities\n\nManila has five sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International, Inc. (SCI):\n\nSacramento, California, United States\n\nSan Francisco, California, United States\n\nMaui County, Hawaii, United States\n\nHonolulu City and County, Hawaii, United States\n\nLos Angeles, California, United States\n\nOther sister cities include:\n\nSanta Barbara, California, USA [4]\n\nWinnipeg, Manitoba, Canada[5]\n\nTaipei, Republic of China [6]\n\nBangkok, Thailand\n\nBeijing, China\n\nShanghai, China\n\nCartagena, Colombia\n\nHaifa, Israel"
