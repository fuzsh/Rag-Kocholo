        "text": "Getting around the National Capital Region (NCR) or Metro Manila is undeniably stressful. There's no getting used to the feeling of sitting too long in a jeepney trapped in a sea of vehicles, uncomfortably taking in the heat and the smoke. If you'd prefer to suffer the hellish traffic in the comforts of a taxi or Grab car, you'll need to pay extra bucks.\n\nIn the midst of it all is a small reprieve that is the LRT-1. Serving around 275,000 passengers daily,[1] itâ€™s undoubtedly one of the most reliable public transportation systems in the metro. Sure, the trains get heavily packed, but theyâ€™ll get you where you need to go.\n\nWhether youâ€™re an expat new to the Philippines or a Filipino navigating Manila for the first time, here's the LRT-1 stations list in order.\n\nWhat is LRT-1 and Where is It Located?\n\nLRT-1 or Light Rail Transit Line 1 is a light rapid transit system in Metro Manila. Currently operated by the Light Rail Manila Corporation (LRMC), this train system is also known as the Green Line. Itâ€™s one of the few existing train systems in the metro, the other being the Light Rail Transit Line 2 (LRT-2), the Metro Rail Transit (MRT Line 3), and the Philippine National Railways Metro Commuter Line.\n\nWith the inauguration of its first segment in 1984, LRT-1 is considered the first LRT system in Southeast Asia.[2] It traverses four cities in Metro Manila, namely Pasay, Manila, Caloocan, and Quezon City.\n\nAbove: The LRT-1 and LRT-2 route map. Photo: Jerome Sandilanico (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nLRT-1 Stations List in Order: Guide to the Stations of LRT Line 1\n\nCurrently, 20 LRT-1 stations are serving the key areas of the four cities mentioned above. Each station is close to important establishments, tourist attractions, and points of interest.\n\nBefore you hop aboard the train, familiarize yourself with the stations. That way, youâ€™ll get to your destination faster. From south to north, the LRT-1 stations listed in order from Baclaran to Fernando Poe Jr. is as follows:\n\nðŸš‰ Baclaran Station\n\nBaclaran is presently the southernmost station of LRT-1. As such, it accommodates thousands of passengers heading to various places in the north. Because it sits at the center of shops and flea markets, itâ€™s easily one of the busiest LRT-1 stations.\n\nIf youâ€™re traveling south of Luzon, a 15-minute ride can take you to the ParaÃ±aque Integrated Terminal Exchange (PITX), which is a hub for public vehicles going to Cavite, Batangas, and Bicol Region.\n\nNearby landmarks:\n\nAyala Malls Manila Bay\n\nBaclaran Flea Market\n\nBaclaran Redemptorist Church\n\nBaclaran Shopping Center\n\nBlue Bay Walk\n\nCity of Dreams\n\nCoastal Mall\n\nNinoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA)\n\nSM Mall of Asia\n\nSolaire Resort and Casino\n\nRead more: From Commute to Private Car: How to Go to NAIA Terminals\n\nðŸš‰ EDSA Station\n\nNamed after one of the busiest thoroughfares in the metro, EDSA Station sits perpendicular to the MRT, making it a transfer hub for commuters going north. Head down the station and youâ€™ll find a barrage of jeepneys and taxis plying EDSA and Taft Avenue. These can take you to different points in Metro Manila, such as Makati, Taguig, ParaÃ±aque, and Muntinlupa.\n\nSeveral bus stations are situated close to the station. These include Victory Liner and Philtranco. Itâ€™s also the LRT station that gives you direct access to SM Mall of Asia, which is just one jeepney ride away.\n\nNearby landmarks:\n\nHeritage Hotel\n\nManila Tytana College\n\nMetropoint Mall\n\nPhilippine Senate\n\nSan Juan de Dios Hospital\n\nSaverâ€™s Square\n\nSM Mall of Asia\n\nThe Dessert Museum\n\nðŸš‰ Libertad Station\n\nAlso known as Arnaiz Station, Libertad is one of the LRT-1 stations found in Pasay City.

Thatâ€™s because the station is close to De La Salle University (DLSU), De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde (DLS-CSB), and Saint Scholasticaâ€™s College.\n\nYou can also reach the CCP complex and the PICC via this station. In case youâ€™re catching a sports event at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex, remember to alight here, since the said venue is just right behind DLSU.\n\nWondering how to go to Malate, Manila via the LRT?

The station sits at the intersection of Quirino Avenue, Taft Avenue, and San Andres Street, making it a busy area. This is an advantage since it wonâ€™t be hard to hail a taxi, a jeep, or a bus going to various points around and outside Malate.\n\nIf your family is out for the day and wants to go sightseeing at Manila Zoo, alight at this station and ride a taxi bound for Roxas Boulevard.

Located at the corner of Taft Avenue and Pedro Gil Street, the station lies close to many universities and colleges, so youâ€™ll definitely find many students around.\n\nBecause itâ€™s within Ermita, one of Manilaâ€™s key commercial districts, expect that youâ€™ll bump into a lot of employees. The area is also teeming with hotels, restaurants, and shops catering to both local and foreign tourists.\n\nNearby landmarks:\n\nHyatt Hotel and Casino Manila\n\nPaco Park\n\nPhilippine Christian University\n\nPhilippine General Hospital\n\nPhilippine Womenâ€™s University\n\nRobinsons Place Manila\n\nSaint Paul University â€“ Manila\n\nUniversity of the Philippines Manila\n\nðŸš‰ UN Avenue Station\n\nNot too far from Pedro Gil Station is the United Nations or UN Avenue Station. This is one of the most strategically located LRT-1 stations because itâ€™s close to various government offices, tourist attractions, and universities.\n\nPerhaps the most recognizable attraction is Rizal Park, which is just a stoneâ€™s throw away from the station. About a 12-minute walk due west via UN Avenue can take you to the US Embassy along Roxas Boulevard.\n\nNearby landmarks:\n\nAdamson University\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\nDepartment of Tourism\n\nEmilio Aguinaldo College\n\nLuneta Park\n\nMalacaÃ±ang Park\n\nManila Ocean Park\n\nNational Bureau of Investigation\n\nNational Library\n\nNational Museum Complex\n\nNational Planetarium\n\nPhilippine Normal University\n\nRizal Park and Monument\n\nSupreme Court of the Philippines\n\nTechnological University of the Philippines\n\nUS Embassy\n\nðŸš‰ Central Terminal Station\n\nThis is the perfect LRT-1 station if youâ€™re planning a walking tour around Old Manila.

Read through this section, and you may find the answers youâ€™re looking for.\n\n1. What is the difference between LRT and MRT?\n\nWhile LRT-1 and MRT (also known as the Yellow Line) are both mass transportation systems within the NCR, they have a few key differences. First is the companies that operate them.\n\nLRT-1 is currently being run by the Light Rail Manila Corporation (LRMC), which is a joint venture of Metro Pacific Investments Corporationâ€™s Metro Pacific Light Rail Corporation (MPLRC), Sumitomo Corporation, Ayala Corporationâ€™s AC Infrastructure Holdings Corporation (AC Infra), and the Philippine Investment Alliance for Infrastructureâ€™s Macquarie Investments Holdings PTE Ltd. (MIPHL). It has a multi-billion peso agreement with the Department of Transportation and the Light Rail Transit Authority (LRTA).\n\nOn the other hand, MRT is owned by the Metro Rail Transit Corporation (MRTC). The said consortium is composed of different companies, such as Ayala Corporationâ€™s Astoria Investment, National Bookstore Groupâ€™s Anglo Philippine Holdings Corporation, RAMCAR Groupâ€™s Railco Investments, UNILAB Groupâ€™s Sheridan LRT Holdings, and Metro Global Holdings Corporation, among others.\n\nAnother difference between LRT-1 and MRT is the route that they take. LRT-1 runs through the major thoroughfares on the east side of Metro Manila, which include Taft Avenue and Rizal Avenue. Note, though, that Balintawak and FPJ stations run through EDSA.\n\nMRT, on the other hand, just runs through EDSA. Both ends of the MRT are connected to LRT 1. So, if you look at the map, youâ€™ll see that LRT-1 and MRT form a loop.\n\nSee also: 8 Ways to Survive the MRT\n\n2. What is the difference between LRT-1 and LRT-2?\n\nBoth LRT-1 and LRT-2 (also known as the Purple Line) are mass transportation systems under the LRTA of the Department of Transportation (DOT). However, they follow different routes.\n\nWhile LRT-1 follows a north-south route, LRT-2 travels from east to west and vice versa. With that set-up, LRT-2 connects Recto in Manila to Antipolo, Rizal. If you look at the map, youâ€™ll see that LRT-2 intersects with MRT in EDSA and ends at its station in Recto, which is connected to LRT-1â€™s Doroteo Jose Station.\n\nCompared to LRT-1, LRT-2 is less busy, giving you a more pleasant ride.\n\n3. How much is the fare for LRT-1?\n\nIt will depend on your destination. Fares for single journeys cost from â‚±15 to â‚±35. But if youâ€™re using a stored value card, youâ€™ll pay less, starting at â‚±14.[6]\n\n4. What are the operating hours of LRT-1?\n\nTake note that LRT-1 doesn't operate 24/7. Though it runs daily, you must take note of the following schedules:\n\nFirst Train\n\nFrom Baclaran â€“ 4:30 a.m. (weekdays, weekends, and holidays)\n\nFrom FPJ â€“ 4:30 a.m. (weekdays, weekends, and holidays)\n\nLast Train\n\nFrom Baclaran â€“ 10:00 p.m. (weekdays) / 9:30 p.m. (weekends and holidays)\n\nFrom FPJ â€“ 10:15 p.m. (weekdays) / 9:45 p.m. (weekends and holidays)\n\n5. Any tips for newbies on how to ride the LRT?\n\nIf itâ€™s your first time riding a LRT-1 train, these handy tips may make your trip more comfortable.\n\nIf you think youâ€™ll be using the train regularly, get yourself a stored value card called the beep card. As long as your card is loaded, you can skip the line at the ticketing booth and go straight to the platform. Your fare will also be discounted.\n\nUnless youâ€™re going to work or a client presentation, wear something comfortable. Trains can get packed too quickly, and saturated crowds can affect the trainâ€™s air conditioning.\n\nAvoid rush hours at LRT-1 stations. Plan your trip around times when the crowd at the station isnâ€™t too big.\n\nPut your bag in your front whether youâ€™re in line or inside the train. That way, you can easily keep an eye on your belongings.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nCommuting in the Metro?
