        "text": "The Early Years\n\nThe Philippine National Bank was established as a government-owned banking institution on July 22, 1916 with headquarters in the old Masonic Temple along Escolta, Manila. Its primary mandate was to provide financial services to Philippine industry and agriculture and support the government’s economic development effort. World War I, then raging in Europe, generated huge demand for the country’s major exports namely: sugar, copra, coconut oil, Manila hemp and tobacco. However, not much was being done to develop the industries that produced these sought-after crops since access to credit facilities was limited then. To solve this problem, Henderson Martin, Vice Governor of the Philippines, together with Mr. Miguel Cuaderno (who later became Central Bank governor) drafted the charter for a national bank.\n\nIn February 4, 1916, Public Act 2612 was passed by the Philippine legislature providing for the establishment of the PNB to replace the small P1 million government-owned Agricultural Bank. PNB’s first head office was the Masonic Temple along Escolta, the then “Wall Street of the Philippines” in the bustling district of Sta. Cruz in Manila. An American, H. Parker Willis, was its first president.\n\n“The First Universal Bank in the country”\n\nWith PNB’s establishment, Filipinos found a bank of their own. PNB was authorized to grant short and long-term loans to agriculture and industry. The Filipino farmers then could avail of loans with interest between 8% to 10% per annum. PNB was also authorized to receive deposits, open foreign credits and rediscount bills. It was also given the special power to issue circulating notes. As such, PNB functioned as the de facto Central Bank of the country until 1949.\n\nOn July 24, 1916, PNB established its first branch in Iloilo.\n\nIn 1917, PNB marked its entry in the field of international banking when it opened its New York Branch. The following year, it established five more domestic branches and another overseas branch in Shanghai, China.\n\nPNB briefly ceased operations in January 1942 but reopened the next month under the supervision of Japanese authorities. After the Second World War, PNB reopened immediately and acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities of the banking division of the National Treasury.\n\nWith the establishment of the Central Bank in 1949, PNB’s role as issuer of currency notes, custodianship of bank reserves, sole depository of government funds and clearing house of the banking system ceased.\n\n“PNB launched the first on-line Electronic\n\nData Processing System in the entire Far East”\n\nIn 1955, it was authorized to operate as an investment bank with powers to own shares and to issue debentures.\n\nIn 1963, it established the National Investment and Development Corporation to engage primarily in long-term and equity financing of business ventures.\n\nPNB transferred to its new Head Office along Escolta in 1966 and launched the first on-line Electronic Data Processing System in the entire Far East.\n\nBetween 1967 and 1979, PNB continued to expand its operations by opening offices in London, Singapore, Djakarta, Honolulu and Amsterdam. In the domestic field, it opened 14 provincial branches. It was also during this period that the Bank started the Dollar Remittance Program.\n\nIn 1980, PNB became the first universal bank in the country. However, it encountered operational difficulties in the mid-80s as a result of the economic downturn triggered by the assassination of Senator Benigno S. Aquino, Jr and had to be assisted by the government in 1986.\n\nPrivatization of PNB\n\nThe privatization of the Bank started when 30 per cent of its outstanding stocks was offered to the public and its stocks were listed in the stock exchange in 1989.\n\nIn 1992, PNB became the first Philippine bank to reach the P100 billion mark in assets.\n\nAlso in 1992, a second public offering of its shares was issued to continue its privatization.\n\nIn 1995, the Bank moved to its new headquarters at the PNB Financial Center in Roxas Boulevard, Pasay City.\n\nIn 1996, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the Bank’s new Articles of Incorporation and by-laws and the change in the status of PNB from a government-based to a private corporation with the control of the government reduced to 46 per cent. At the turnover rites on July 23, 1996, President Fidel V. Ramos declared:\n\nPNB is the bank for the Filipino wherever he or she may be– in the country’s centers of commerce and industry, in the far reaches of the countryside, and even in\n\nmany places across the globe.”\n\nA New Beginning"
