        "text": "Alphabetical List of Guerrilla Units and Their File Codes in the Guerrilla Unit Recognition Files\n\nF-O\n\nBecause of the complexity and number of the names of guerrilla units, this list has been alphabetized as if the numbers of numbered units were spelled out and as if abbreviations were spelled out. Thus, “14th Inf. Rgt.” precedes “4st Inf. Rgt.” as “fourteenth” precedes “fourth;” and “HQ” [headquarters] precedes “Heroes.” Moreover, the unit names are taken from labels in the records and thus vary in style. For example, the researcher looking for “Company A” should check this list under both that label and “A Company” or “A Co.”\n\nFor definitions of abbreviations, refer to the Philippine Archives Collection: Glossary of Initialisms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms. To learn more about the collection, visit The Journey of the Philippine Archives Collection pages.\n\nFor more information about the records, see the full catalog description of the series\n\nGuerrilla Unit Recognition Files, 1941 - 1948 (National Archives Identifier 1257644).\n\nGo to P-Z\n\nSource Note: This list originally appeared as Appendix C in the National Archives Special List 61, The Philippine Archives Collection: A Special List of Documents in Record Group 407, Records of the Adjutant General's Office, 1917–, Concerning U. S. Army and Guerilla Units in the Philippines during World War II, compiled by Jo Ann Williamson and Frank H. Serene (2003)."
