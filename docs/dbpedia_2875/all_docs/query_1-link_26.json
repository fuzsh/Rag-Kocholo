Accessed 18 February 2010.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH\n\nWilliam Porter Moffet, also known as Colonel Moffet, was on September 21, 1866, in DeKalb County, Illinois. At an early age, he became interested in the newspaper business; this interest brought him to North Dakota in 1885 at the age of 19. Moffet worked for the Dakota Settler in Steele (ND) as a printer-employee. In 1887, the Settler was moved to Bismarck; it became a weekly paper and one of the earliest papers published in Bismarck. Moffet, along with a partner, was owner, publisher, and editor of the Bismarck Settler. The endeavor was a success and the paper was published until 1901. Because of his growing military career, Moffet was often away; during his absence his wife Lulah was in charge of the business.\n\nDuring a visit to Bismarck in 1951 Moffet described the newspaper business as “rugged.” He stated, “an editor who displeased someone is apt to get beaten over the head with a pistol or shot to death.” That is what happened to Moffet as the result of an article he published, entitled “The Catechism,” which implied that some people took advantage of the military “boys” by taking their money. In 1888 he was assaulted because of that article and received serious injuries. The guilty person was taken to court in 1890 in a well publicized trial, “Moffet v. Griffin.” Beyond the assault, Moffet’s newspaper also experienced vandalism. At one time his presses were wrecked and thrown into the Missouri River. In spite of this setback, he published the paper on time using an old hand press.\n\nLetters in this collection (MSS 10169) indicate that Moffet was instrumental in the establishment of Fort Abraham Lincoln in Bismarck. He promoted the construction of the fort through articles in his newspaper and was in contact with the military personnel in charge of the project. William P. Moffet was a plucky editor who was not afraid to print his opinions and determined to get the news to the people.\n\nMoffet’s military career began August 19, 1887, when he joined Company A, 1st Infantry, of the North Dakota National Guard; his military career would span over forty years. Moffet advanced in military rank quickly. In l898 he was Captain of Company A when they were called to duty and served in the Spanish American war and subsequent Philippine Insurrection. The North Dakota unit saw considerable military action, but there were many times when they became restless because there was a lull. Moffet’s men were under the command of Brigadier General Arthur MacArthur who detailed Captain Moffet to take charge of the prisons and prisoners in Manila. He held this position for seven months. Details of Moffet time in the Philippines are contained in this manuscript collection.\n\nIn August 1899 Moffet returned to civilian life and continued publishing the paper for a short time. At the time, he was also serving with the North Dakota National Guard in Bismarck. In 1901 Moffet was called from civilian life, given the temporary rank of 1st Lieutenant, and became a career military officer. It was at this time that he ended his newspaper business. He became a part of the Cavalry of the United States Army and was assigned to Camp Sheridan, a training camp in his home state of Illinois. During his military career Moffet was stationed at several different camps, was in many divisions, and held various positions.\n\nOne of Colonel Moffet’s military campaigns of note occurred in 1916 during the Mexican Border dispute. He led a charge over difficult terrain into the town of Tomochie which was occupied by the Villistas. In spite of being under heavy fire and outnumbered he was successful in dislodging the Villistas. He was described as calm and cool when handling his troops. Colonel Moffet received the Silver Star for Gallantry in Action while serving with General Pershing. Colonel Moffet retired in 1930 having attained the rank of full colonel. After his retirement, he became a resident of St Paul, MN and taught Military Science at Cretia High School in St. Paul, MN.\n\nColonel Moffet died November 18, l954, at age 88. His wife Lulah died February 2, l948. They are both buried in Fort Snelling Cemetery in St. Paul. The Moffets had five children: Ernest of St. Paul; William T. of Rochester, MN; Mrs. Ann Jarvis, New York; Mrs. Helen Ruling (address unknown); and Lulah, who lived with her parents in St. Paul. At the time of Colonel Moffet’s death, the Moffets had six grandchildren and five great grandchildren. While living in Bismarck, the Moffets were members of the First Presbyterian Church where Colonel Moffet was an elder. He also served as Sunday School Superintendent. Throughout his later years, Colonel Moffet visited Bismarck and North Dakota occasionally. He attended reunions of Company A, 1st Infantry, National Guard at Bismarck.\n\nSources:\n\nBismarck Tribune, Bismarck, ND, May 27-June 1, 1890, 1931, February 1948, November 20, 1954.\n\nCampaigning in the Philippines, Karl Irving Faust.
