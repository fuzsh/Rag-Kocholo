LOS ANGELES, Jan. 5 -- Jumpstart your New Year's resolution and live happily ever after with the Lifetime Original Movie Lying to be Perfect, starring Poppy Montgomery (Without a Trace) and Adam Kaufman (Melrose Place). Adapted from Sarah Strohmeyer's novel, The Cinderella Pact, the dramedy tells the story of Nola Devlin (Montgomery) and her two best friends who, in a last ditch effort to lose weight, band together to follow the advice of their "fairy godmother" and end up changing their lives forever. Lying to be Perfect premieres on Saturday, January 30, 2010, at 9 PM ET/PT on Lifetime Television.

ABOUT LYING TO BE PERFECT

Nola Devlin (Montgomery) is an unassuming, frumpy editor who is mistreated and disregarded by her boss at Shine! Magazine. When the sun sets, though, she lives behind the glow and anonymity of her computer screen and becomes Belinda Apple, the magazine's famous and "reclusive" star advice columnist. One day, tired of being overworked and overweight, Nola and her two best friends Deb (Audrey Wasilewski, Mad Men) and Nancy (Chelah Horsdal, The L Word) follow the advice of their "fairy godmother," Belinda Apple, and band together to lose weight once and for all. At the same time, Nola's secret identity is threatened, and she must keep everything in her life straight, including the arrival of her own potential Prince Charming (Kaufman). As the group of friends drops dress sizes, their real issues are exposed, and better-than-expected life changes begin to blossom.
