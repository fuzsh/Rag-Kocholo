A lease or management contract, including any renewals that are solely at the option of the lessee, must be for a term substantially less than the useful life of the property, but may allow renewal beyond that term upon a determination by the lessor that the use continues to carry out the governmental program.

If any state bonds issued to purchase or better the state bond financed property that is sold remain outstanding on the date of sale, the net proceeds of sale must be applied as follows: (1) if the state bond financed property was acquired and bettered solely with state bond proceeds, the net proceeds of sale must be paid to the commissioner, deposited in the state bond fund, and used to pay or redeem or defease the outstanding bonds in accordance with the commissioner's order authorizing their issuance, and the proceeds are appropriated for this purpose; or (2) if the state bond financed property was acquired or bettered partly with state bond proceeds and partly with other money, the net proceeds of sale must first be used to pay or redeem or defease the state bonds as provided in clause (1), and any excess over the amount needed for that purpose must be divided in proportion to the shares contributed to its acquisition or betterment and paid to the interested public and private entities, and the proceeds are appropriated for this purpose.
