The board has the imprint \"1933, Chas B. Darrow\" in the Jail corner, and the Parker Brothers signature in the Go corner. Many of the graphics are the same, though the icon for Community Chest had not been designed. The Income Tax space is also Pay 10% or $300, instead of the later Pay 10% or $200. Property values are omitted from the board (they were not printed on the original) – a Banker's Rate Card is included with those values, as well as Mortgage values, and the required interest and repayment rates if a property is mortgaged. The property, Chance and Community Chest cards are all reprints from the 1935 edition, and the latter two types feature artwork that was replaced after the development of the more familiar Uncle Pennybags/Mr. Monopoly figure, and had not been seen since 1935. Some boards came with two packs of currency, instead of the usual one. The dice are a standard black pips on white dice, and the houses and hotels are both wooden.\n\nTokens: A lantern, an iron, a thimble, a rocking horse, a purse, a battleship, a cannon, a tophat, a shoe and a car.\n\nOther features: Some of the cards feature instructions that were changed after 1935, such as \"A collection has been taken up and everyone must donate 10% of his holdings to you (cash)\", and \"We're off the Gold Standard, collect $50.\"\n\nCopyright date: 2006 Released by: Winning Moves Games Issued through: Initially, Game Specialty Stores and Winning Moves' own website; later, Toys \"R\" Us stores\n\nFree Parking Kentucky Avenue\n\n$220ChanceIndiana Avenue\n\n$220Illinois Avenue\n\n$240Michigan Avenue\n\n$240Bus TicketB&O Railroad\n\n$200Atlantic Avenue\n\n$260Ventnor Avenue\n\n$260Water Works\n\n$150Marvin Gardens\n\n$280California Avenue\n\n$280Go To Jail New York Avenue\n\n$200The Mega EditionPacific Avenue\n\n$300New Jersey Avenue\n\n$200South Carolina Avenue\n\n$300Tennessee Avenue\n\n$180North Carolina Avenue\n\n$300Community ChestCommunity ChestSt. James Place\n\n$180Pennsylvania Avenue\n\n$320Pennsylvania Railroad\n\n$200Short Line\n\n$200Virginia Avenue\n\n$160ChanceStates Avenue\n\n$140Birthday Gift\n\ntake $100 or a Bus TicketElectric Company\n\n$150Florida Avenue\n\n$350St. Charles Place\n\n$140Park Place\n\n$350Maryland Avenue\n\n$140Luxury Tax\n\n(pay $75)Auction any unowned propertyBoardwalk\n\n$400 In Jail/Just VisitingConnecticut Avenue\n\n$120Vermont Avenue\n\n$100Gas Company\n\n$150ChanceOriental Avenue\n\n$100Massachusetts Avenue\n\n$100Reading Railroad\n\n$200Income Tax\n\n(pay 10% or $200)Arctic Avenue\n\n$80Baltic Avenue\n\n$60Community ChestMediterranean Avenue\n\n$60Go\n\ncollect $200 salary as you pass\n\nGame description: This is an expanded edition of the classic game. The larger board encompasses 9 new properties (one for each Color Group and one new Utility) and three new spaces (AUCTION, BUS TICKET and BIRTHDAY GIFT). The gameplay is expedited by inclusion of a third Speed Die (which adds to or affects movement, or awards bonuses) and by an additional deck of 16 Bus Ticket cards (which allow forward movement to any space on the side currently occupied by a player's token; 3 of the cards also negate Tickets held by players by having them expire). It is also enhanced by the inclusion of 8 Skyscrapers (which can be built on full monopolies after Hotels are erected) and 4 Train Depots (which double the rent values of the Railroad spaces).\n\nSee also: Monopoly: The Mega Edition\n\nTokens: The current group of eleven standard tokens are included (cannon, boot, thimble, wheelbarrow, car, horse and rider, dog, hat, battleship, iron and money bag).\n\nOther features: Because of the additional properties, the gameboard is approx. 50% bigger, and the set includes grey-colored $1000 bills. Players start the game with $2500 (adding a $1000 bill to the standard $1500 distribution in the regular game). In addition, gameplay allows players to build Houses and Hotels on a Color Group if they have a Majority Ownership (own all but one of the properties in the Group), but Skyscrapers can only be built on a full Monopoly (owning all the properties in the given Group).\n\nCopyright date: 2001 Released by: Parker Brothers/Hasbro Issued through: Target stores until 2005, general release (except Target stores) as of 2005.\n\nFree Parking Kentucky Avenue\n\n$220ChanceIndiana Avenue\n\n$220Illinois Avenue\n\n$240B&O Railroad\n\n$200Atlantic Avenue\n\n$260Ventnor Avenue\n\n$260Water Works\n\n$150Marvin Gardens\n\n$280Go To Jail New York Avenue\n\n$200Parker Brothers Nostalgia Games Series EditionPacific Avenue\n\n$300Tennessee Avenue\n\n$180North Carolina Avenue\n\n$300Community ChestCommunity ChestSt. James Place\n\n$180Pennsylvania Avenue\n\n$320Pennsylvania Railroad\n\n$200Short Line\n\n$200Virginia Avenue\n\n$160ChanceStates Avenue\n\n$140Park Place\n\n$350Electric Company\n\n$150Luxury Tax\n\n(pay $100)St. Charles Place\n\n$140Boardwalk\n\n$400 In Jail/Just VisitingConnecticut Avenue\n\n$120Vermont Avenue\n\n$100ChanceOriental Avenue\n\n$100Reading Railroad\n\n$200Income Tax\n\n(pay $200)Baltic Avenue\n\n$60Community ChestMediter-ranean Avenue\n\n$60Go\n\nGame description: This is a reproduction of a 1957 board and Monopoly set. It uses the standard U.S. Atlantic City properties. The set comes in a wooden case, with a lid that slides off, and holds the board, with compartments for the cards, tokens and paper money. A brief history of the game is reprinted inside the lid. The houses and hotels are similarly made of wood, and come in the original green for houses and red for hotels.\n\nTokens: Racecar, dog, top hat, thimble, locomotive and shoe.\n\nOther features: Slats cut in the box's wooden compartment dividers allow for storage of money by denomination during game play. This game was released as part of a series of Parker Brothers Nostalgia Games, and was exclusive to Target until the line was discontinued in 2005. Other retailers (such as Barnes and Noble Booksellers) bought up the remaining stock for sale. Target replaced the product line with the Hasbro Library series.\n\nCopyright date: 2000 Released by: American Express Mutual Fund Co. (AXP Funds), a subsidiary at the time of American Express, Inc., under license from USAopoly Issued through: Not sold to the public. This was a limited release used by the company as a promotional prize to its financial advisors.\n\nGame description: Only 2000 games were ever produced, the minimum run allowed at the time by USAopoly. The game was distributed in the year 2000 by the American Express Funds Company to its captive network of financial advisors. The intent was to reward advisors who sold a high volume of American Express Funds and to encourage other advisors to increase their sales of AXP funds. The game was designed so that the advisors could also give the game to their clients or use it as a sales tool to introduce AXP funds. The board was populated by various AXP Mutual Funds, with the places of Boardwalk and Park Place taken by AXP New Dimensions and AXP Growth, two of the company's best performing funds at the time. Because securities are a regulated industry, the game had to meet NASD legal requirements, which required careful wording of everything to avoid misleading investors. In 2005, American Express Financial Advisors was spun off from its parent company, American Express, Inc. It is now Ameriprise Financial, Inc. and the AXP Funds Company is now RiverSource Funds.\n\nTokens: To reduce costs, the traditional pewter tokens were used.\n\nOther features: Chance and Community Chest cards were replaced due to legal concerns to Service and Planning Cards. A package of 32 Asset Allocations 12 Comprehensive Plans were also included.\n\nReleased by: Apple Studios Issued through: General Release\n\nGame description: The Beatles Collector's Edition replaces all normal properties with Beatles albums and other points of interest, and includes every single known album ever produced by The Beatles, listed in chronological order from their release dates. It also includes special Fabs versions of the pewter tokens. Many other aspects of the game are changed. For example, the railroads are concert tickets, chance and community chest are The Fab Four and Beatlemania, the houses (white) and hotels (black) are listening parties and concerts, and money is called love, a reference to All You Need Is Love.\n\nTokens: An octopus (Octopus's Garden), a walrus (I Am The Walrus), a strawberry (Strawberry Fields Forever), a raccoon (Rocky Raccoon), the sun (Here Comes The Sun), and a hammer (Maxwell's Silver Hammer)\n\nCopyright date: 2000 Released by: Parker Brothers/Hasbro Issued through: General release\n\nFree Parking weather.comE-mail Just in!About.comCnet.comSprintEtrademonster.comSun MicrosystemsCBS MarketWatchGo To Jail EBayThe .com Edition (2000)AskJeevesExpedia.comAltaVistaDownloadDownloadPriceline.comLycosMCI WorldComLycosEonlineAT&TGames.comExcite@HomeLinuxISP Feeshockwave.comYahoo!

The properties feature the logos of many Internet companies, including Yahoo!, E*TRADE, eBay and Priceline.com. Currency was changed so that it was denominated in millions of dollars; the dark purple properties sold at $60 million each, and the dark blue properties sold at $350 million and $400 million. Community Chest became Download and Chance became E-mail Just In! Houses and hotels were changed from their familiar green and red colors to blue and red, and were renamed Households and Offices. The Income Tax space remained fairly similar (10% or $200 million), but the Luxury Tax space became ISP Fee: Pay $75 million. The four railroad spaces became four companies involved in telecommunications: Nokia, MCI Worldcom, Sprint and AT&T. The two utilities became Linux and Sun Microsystems. Trademark disclaimers were made for all participating companies in fine print on the game board itself.\n\nTokens: Eight pewter tokens were available, plus a special Mr. Monopoly at his computer token that could be used as a game piece, or for a special rule variant. The other eight tokens are: a computer desktop (tower, monitor and keyboard), a pointing hand (such as the icon that appears in many web browsers when the mouse pointer hovers over a hyperlink), a surfboard, a flat panel monitor, a mouse (made to look like a real mouse, instead of a computer mouse), another hand holding an envelope (supposedly representing e-mail), a pixelated arrow cursor and a microchip made to look like a bug.\n\nOther features: This edition introduced an offline rule, for optional use with the Mr. Monopoly at his computer token. This token is moved onto any space that has a Title Deed card whenever any player moves doubles. That space is considered offline, and no rent can be collected for it unless someone rolls doubles again and moves the token, or someone lands on the space and moves the token (bringing the site back online, thus rent can be charged for it again the next time someone lands on the space, provided the special token was not returned there in the meantime).\n\nCopyright date: 2002 Issued through: Available only in Disney theme parks.\n\nFree Parking Hollywood Tower HotelWishing WellKilimanjaro SafarisSpaceship EarthWalt Disney World Resort BusBuzz Lightyear's Space Ranger SpinSplash MountainDisney MagicThe Haunted MansionGo To Jail Journey to the Center of the EarthDisney Theme Park EditionMr. Toad's World RideBig Thunder Mountain RailroadMad Tea PartyMagic LampMagic LampJungle CruiseCalifornia Screamin'Tokyo Disneyland BoatDisneyland Resort MonorailDumbo The Flying ElephantWishing WellPeter Pan's Flight\"It's a Small World\"Disney WonderVillain's TaxCastle CarouselMatterhorn In Jail/Just VisitingPirates of the CaribbeanSpace MountainWishing WellOrbitronDisneyland Paris TrainVillain's TaxStar ToursMagic LampIndiana Jones And The Temple Of PerilGo\n\nGame description: This is a special edition sold only in Disney theme parks. The game comes in a tin with a quarter-fold board. Properties have been replaced by various attraction in Disney theme parks around the world. The railroads are replaced with a form of transportation used in each of four Disney parks: The Disneyland Monorail, the Disneyland Paris Train, the Tokyo Disneyland Boat (which is actually used in Tokyo DisneySea), and the Walt Disney World Bus. Chance and Community Chest have become Wishing Well and Magic Lamp, respectively. Houses became Main Street Buildings, and hotels became Castles (which came in two designs, one modeled after Sleeping Beauty Castle and the other after Cinderella Castle). The money is slightly smaller than the original and are referred to as wishes instead of dollars; however, they are included in the same denominations and colors as the original game. The game also includes a black plastic tray with slots which can be used to hold the banker's wishes in a vertical position.\n\nTokens: Tokens are pewter and include a Splash Mountain log, a monorail cab, a Mr. Toad's Wild Ride car, an Astro Orbiter rocket, a ship from Tokyo DisneySea, a train locomotive, a Mad Tea Party teacup, and a Haunted Mansion Doom Buggy. In the newest edition there are different tokens than in the first edition. Also they added Expedition Everest as the best property. In this newer, still special edition, there are \"Sorcerer's hat\" and \"Magic Mirror\" instead of Wishing Well and Magic Lamp.\n\nCopyright date: 2010 Released by: Parker Brothers Issued through: Available only in Disney theme parks.\n\nFree Parking Grizzly River RunHappily ever after...California Screamin'Toy Story ManiaDisney BusTest TrackMission SPACEWalt Disney World City HallSoarin'Go To Jail Kilimanjaro SafariDisney Theme Park III EditionKing Arthur CarrouselDinosaurDumbo the Flying ElephantOnce upon a time...Once upon a time...Expedition Everest\"it's a small world\"Disney BoatDisney TrainHollywood Tower HotelHappy ever after...The Great Movie RideSpace MountainDisneyland Fire Dept\"I'm surrounded by Idiots\" TaxMuppet Vision 3DMatterhorn Bobsleds In Jail/Just VisitingJungle CruiseEnchanted Tiki RoomHappily ever after...Pirates of the CaribbeanDisney MonorailMaleficent's Evil Spell Tax20,000 Leagues Under the SeaOnce upon a time...SkywayGo\n\nGame description: Monopoly® Disney Theme Park Edition III Game lets you relive the excitement of all your favorite attractions at Disney Theme Parks -- from The Haunted Mansion® attraction to the Disney Monorail -- with this very special edition of the classic Monopoly® board game.

The game board has been changed to reflect departments within Dominick's supermarkets, with properties such as Grocery Department, Frozen Department, Dairy Department, Health & Beauty Department and Bakery Department. The four railroads became the Commissary, Donna's Distribution, Distribution Center and CPS Warehouse. Community Chest and Chance became Plastic and Paper (bags), respectively, with themes such as \"Store Manager caught standing on a milk crate! Pay each player $50 for setting a bad example.\" The Electric Company and Water Works became Ludwig Dairy and Rancher's Reserve Ranch respectively. Income Tax and Luxury Tax kept their usual amounts, but became Repair Fee and Charitable Donation respectively.\n\nTokens: Tokens are pewter and include: a shopping cart, an apple, a pizza, a cash register, a gallon of milk and a truck bearing the Dominick's logo.\n\nOther features: Properties, houses, hotels and currency retained their usual colors, based on the US Standard Edition. Houses and Hotels also retain the same shape, but are known as New Products and Merchandise Displays respectively. The currency features the Monopoly logo in a banner scroll at the top of every bill, and each uses the Chicago skyline as a full backdrop. The varying denominations each have a different Dominick's corporate logo from the company's history, with the exception of the 20, which uses the logo for the now defunct Omni Superstore, a former Dominick's division.\n\nCopyright date: 2006 & 2015 Released by: Parker Brothers/Hasbro Issued through: General U.S. release\n\nGame description: In April 2006, Hasbro launched a promotion through their monopoly.com website to select properties for a US version of the Here and Now Edition. The first Here and Now Edition of Monopoly had launched successfully in the UK in 2005. Like the UK edition, the US version has been updated for the twenty-first century, with higher property values and updated scenarios on the Chance cards and Community Chest cards. But unlike the UK edition, properties that appear on the US version were selected by visitors to monopoly.com, choosing one of three landmarks for each of twenty-two US cities. The voting lasted for three weeks. The landmark with the highest vote total per city is displayed on the final board, and the cities that received the most total votes have the highest property values, while those with the lowest total votes received the lowest property values. Thus New York City and Boston, Massachusetts have the dark blue properties, and Cleveland, Ohio and Dallas, Texas have the dark purple properties. The railroads became the four busiest airports in the US: Chicago's O'Hare International, Los Angeles International, New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport, and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. The Income Tax space remained the same, though it becomes 10% or $2,000,000, but the Luxury Tax space changed to Interest on Credit Card Debt: Pay $750,000. The Electric Company became Cell Phone Service and the Water Works became Internet Service.\n\nTokens: There are eight pewter tokens: a laptop, a labradoodle, a jet plane, a Motorola RAZR phone, a New Balance running shoe, a Toyota Prius, a cup of Starbucks coffee and a container of McDonald's french fries.\n\nOther features: A two-page document about the voting process and protests by cities which were not included as candidates for the final board is included with the game, particularly that by Atlantic City, New Jersey, which remains the setting of the US Standard Edition and the Mega Edition. Houses and hotels retained their familiar shapes, but became blue and silver plastic, respectively. Similarly, the tops of the Community Chest and Chance cards are no longer yellow and orange, but became blue and silver, respectively.\n\nCopyright date: 2014 Released by: USAopoly under license from Hasbro\n\nThe Legend of Zelda elements licensed from Nintendo.

The board features images of characters, items and locations from nearly all the Zelda video games. All of the paper currency has been renamed after the Zelda video games' currency Rupees. Properties are locations from the Zelda video games. Water Works is replaced by the Potion Shop and the Electric Company is now a Bomb Shop. The train stations have been changed to Link's methods of transport throughout the various games – Epona, the King of the Red Lions, Link's Loftwing and the Spirit Train. Community Chest have become Treasure Chest while Empty Bottle now represent Chance. The Income Tax is now a Door Fee and the Luxury Tax is now represented by the Mask Merchant. The plastic houses and hotels retained their usual shapes, but became \"Deku Sprouts\" and \"Deku Trees\" respectively.\n\nTokens: Five golden collector's tokens are included in all editions of the game: the Bow, the Hookshot, the Boomerang, the Triforce, and Hylian Shield. A sixth, exclusive golden token was included only in GameStop editions of the game: the Ocarina of Time.\n\nOther features: Two editions of this game were released, a GameStop exclusive edition and a standard edition (available everywhere else). Besides having one exclusive token (already listed above) the GameStop edition also included some other exclusive items: an 11\"x17\" Hyrule Map Lithograph in Treasure Chest Holder and six Item Power Cards for added game play (Goddess Harp, Wind Waker, Minish Cap, Spirit Flute, Phantom Hourglass and Ocarina of Time).\n\nCopyright date: 2002, 2008, and 2010 Released by: USAopoly under license from Hasbro. Peanuts design licensed from United Feature Syndicate, Inc.\n\nGame description: This was a board released in 2002 to honor the comic strip Peanuts. The board features artwork by Charles M. Schulz; virtually all of the printed text on the box, the game board, the title deed, Chance and Community Chest cards, as well as the currency, is done in a style similar to the style Schulz used in writing out text in word balloons and thought balloons for his characters (this includes the four corner spaces, which rarely change for any licensed Monopoly game set). All of the currency features Snoopy: First Beagle on the Moon for the $1, as a frustrated writer in front of his typewriter for the $5, a golfer for the $10, a Beagle Scout for the $20, dressed in his Attorney outfit for the $50, the World War I flying ace on the $100 and Joe Cool on the $500. Properties are characters and situations from the strip's 50 year history: Peppermint Patty and Marcie are one of the dark purple properties, Schroeder is a light purple property, Suppertime! is a green property, and Flying Ace is one of the dark blue properties. Community Chest was changed to Pitcher's Mound and Chance became Psychiatric Booth, and the texts on their respective cards also reflect the theme. Houses were recolored brown, and have become nests. The Hotels stayed red, but have been renamed Dog Houses (as Snoopy's own dog house was shown to be red). The utilities became Bus Stop and French Café (instead of Electric Company and Water Works) and the tax spaces became No Valentine and Kite-Eating Tree (instead of Luxury Tax and Income Tax, though the spaces retained the usual rates). Railroads are replaced by holidays: Valentine's Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas and Halloween.\n\nTokens: Six pewter collector's tokens are included: Snoopy sleeping on top of his dog house, Snoopy's supper dish, Woodstock, a football on a kicking tee, Schroeder's piano, and Lucy's psychiatric booth.\n\nCopyright date: 2006 Released by: USAopoly under license from Parker Brothers/Hasbro\n\nPirates of the Caribbean elements licensed from Disney. Issued through: General release\n\nGame description: This edition of Monopoly was issued to coincide with the release of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. It features special pewter tokens, money, and deed cards to items featured in the film and its predecessor, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The Community Chest and Chance cards were replaced with Aztec Gold and Compass cards. Docks and Harbors were used in place of houses and hotels. Cursed Loot replaces the Income Tax space, various ships including the Interceptor, the Black Pearl, and the Flying Dutchman replace the railroads, and Davy Jones' chest and key replace the utilities. The printed money continues the movies' theme, printed to look like old cash certificates, but maintaining the usual colors for U.S. edition Monopoly money.\n\nTokens: Six pewter tokens which include the dog with the keys to the jail cell, Jack Sparrow's Compass, a pirate skull, Jack the Monkey, Davy Jones' Chest, and a cannon from the Black Pearl.\n\nCopyright date: 1999 Released by: Parker Brothers Issued through: General release\n\nGame description: The Pokémon edition is based on the Pokémon Red and Blue video games, with minor influences from the Pokémon anime. Each color group represents the eight Pokémon Gyms of the Kanto region, and each property represents a particular Pokémon used at the Gym. A player is said to have won the corresponding Gym Badge if they have all of the Pokémon in the gym. Poké Balls are used for the four railroads, while Articuno and Zapdos represents Water Works and the Electric Company, respectively. Gary Oak and Team Rocket represent Income Tax and Luxury Tax, respectively. Players earn Pokédollars (the currency of the games), which feature Ash Ketchum and Pikachu on each denomination. Houses are represented by Pokémon Centers, while Poké Marts take the place of hotels. Professor Oak takes the place of Chance cards, while Trainer Battles (represented by Ash Ketchum and Pikachu) take the place of Community Chest cards.\n\nTokens: The standard edition comes with six pewter tokens, representing Charmander, Meowth, Pikachu, Poliwhirl, Psyduck, and Snorlax. The collector's edition comes with six colored plastic tokens, representing Blastoise, Bulbasaur, Charmander, Clefairy, Mewtwo, and Pikachu.\n\nOther features: An optional set of rules is featured that allow players to take special actions (Pokémon Powers) whenever doubles are rolled in lieu of taking an extra turn. They are as follows: moving to any space on the board (akin to Mewtwo's Teleport), collect an extra 200 Pokédollars (akin to Clefairy's Rest), collecting 50 Pokédollars from every player (akin to Bulbasaur's Leech Seed), drawing a Professor Oak card, drawing a Trainer Battle card, and attacking another Pokémon. When choosing to attack another Pokémon, the player names any Pokémon held by an opponent that is not part of a completed color group (except for Articuno and Zapdos). The player and the property's owner both roll the dice, with the player rolling the higher number keeping control of the Pokémon (any ties result in a re-roll).\n\nCopyright date: 2001 Released by: Parker Brothers Issued through: General release\n\nGame description: The Pokémon edition is based on the Pokémon Gold and Silver video games, with minor influences from the Pokémon anime. Like the previous edition, players earn Pokédollars, which feature Ash Ketchum and Pikachu on each denomination. Houses and hotels, as before, are represented by Pokémon Centers and Poké Marts. As before, each color group represent the eight Pokémon Gyms and each property represent the particular Pokémon used at the Gym, but are of the Johto region in this game (similarly, Professor Elm and not Professor Oak represents the Chance cards, while Ash Ketchum and Pikachu continue to represent the Community Chest cards, which are simply termed Ash cards in this game). Unlike the previous edition, the Zephyr and Hive Badges, the first two obtained in the video games, take the place of the utilities, while Chikorita, Cyndaquil, Totodile, and Heracross represent the four railroads. Gary Oak and Team Rocket represent Income Tax and Luxury Tax, respectively.\n\nTokens: The collector's edition comes with six colored plastic tokens, representing Bellossom, Chikorita, Cyndaquil, Marill, Pikachu, and Totodile.\n\nOther features: The same optional rules from the 1999 edition are also featured in this edition. The Pokémon representing some of these powers have changed to reflect the second generation of Pokémon games (Hoppip instead of Mewtwo, Bellossom using Absorb instead of Clefairy using Rest, and Skiploom instead of Bulbasaur). The four Pokémon representing the railroads may not be named in an attack.\n\nCopyright date: 2013 Released by: USAopoly under license from Hasbro\n\nPower Ranger elements licensed from Saban Brands.

The board features photo images of characters, Zords, vehicles, weapons and locations from nearly every season of the show up to its 20th Anniversary. All of the paper currency features the iconic lightning bolt used in nearly every Power Rangers logo. Properties are Zords, vehicles and locations from the franchise's 20 year history. Water Works is replaced by the Eternal Falls of Aquitar and the Electric Company is now a metaphorical representation of the \"Morphin Grid\" that powers the Rangers' costumes and abilities. Villains from the show represent the Community Chest while Allies from the show represent Chance. The Income Tax is now a power boost and the Luxury Tax is now represented by a weapons upgrade. The plastic houses and hotels retained their usual shapes, but became red \"Zords\" and white \"Megazords\" respectively. The board also includes two traditional white Monopoly dice with black dots.\n\nTokens: Six zinc collector's tokens are included: Alpha 5, a Power Morpher, the White Ranger Helmet, a Lightning Bolt, the Megazord, and Goldar. Goldar was the winning candidate from a fan voting contest that was conducted on the official Power Rangers Facebook page. The two losing candidates for becoming a token were a pair of Ranger Boots and a Juice Cup.\n\nOther features: A limited edition Power Rangers themed Monopoly dice was also created for use in conjunction with this board, but was offered separately. The dice is black and features both the show logo's iconic yellow lightning bolt and yellow dots as the dice's dots. This dice was given away at San Diego Comic Con 2013 and could also be won in a giveaway contest (along with other Power Rangers themed items) that was conducted on the official Power Rangers Facebook page. Later the dice, while previously advertised as being created for Monopoly during its giveaway offerings, would eventually see a retail release with a completely different board game. The dice was included with the game Trivial Pursuit – Power Rangers 20th Anniversary Edition.\n\nCopyright date: 2001 Released by: Parker Brothers/Hasbro Issued through: General release\n\nGame description: This edition of Monopoly was based on the Cartoon Network series of the same name. The box lid is made of a special reflective foil paper. The game board features locations from the series' fictional setting of The City of Townsville, illustrated with representative artwork. Community Chest and Chance are renamed into Forces of Evil and Hotline, respectively. The four railroads also become City of Townsville locations: Townsville Bank, Pokey Oaks School, The Mayor's Office and The Museum. The utilities are the Power Plant and the Water Tower. All of the currency features the face of The Mayor. This edition also features purple, stackable buildings in place of houses, and pink skyscrapers in place of hotels.\n\nTokens: Six full color plastic tokens were included: Blossom, Bubbles, Buttercup, The Mayor, Ms. Keane and Professor Utonium. In addition three cardboard punchout tokens are available, which can be used as regular playing tokens, or for a special rule variation. The three tokens represent Mojo Jojo, Fuzzy Lumpkins and Sedusa.\n\nOther features: A special, optional set of rules was included for the three villain tokens. When using these rules, the three villains begin the game in Jail. Any of the three villain tokens can be moved from jail onto any property space (owned or unowned). If a villain token is moved onto an unowned property space, players who have enough money for the space can fight for it through rolls of the dice – the player with the highest dice roll wins the right to buy the property at its full printed value. If the villain was moved from jail to an owned property, the villain can prevent the owner from collecting rent. When another player (not the owner) lands on the occupied space, they must roll the dice. If a seven or higher is rolled, the villain is defeated and returned to jail, and no rent is owed. If a six or lower is rolled, the villain continues his/her/its occupation and rent is owed. If the owner lands on an occupied space, they too must roll – seven or higher returns the villain to jail, six or lower lets the villain token stay on that property. No penalty (or forced dice roll) is made if a villain token is moved onto a space already occupied by a player token.\n\nCopyright date: 2021 Released by: USAopoly under license from Hasbro Issued through: Pixel Empire\n\nFree Parking Midnight Launch Event\n\n$220The Topic Wheel\"The Yearies\" Studio\n\n$220The Lesler Pumpkin Orchard\n\n$240The Sewers\n\n$200The Think Barrel\n\n$260Homecoming Dance\n\n$260Water Productions\n\n$150Stale Pretzels\n\n$280Go To Jail Say That Answer!

Houses and Hotels have been renamed \"Shelves\" and \"Desks.\" Custom-themed money is included, renamed as \"V-Cards.\" Community Chest and Chance Cards have been renamed \"Kay Swiss' Bank Cards\" and \"The Topic Wheel Cards,\" respectively. Text and images have been changed to reflect the theme. There is a slight error on the money. The character Wendy's Employee was intended to be renamed to \"The Employee\" to avoid copyright. However, the $50 note, which features the character, is misspelled as \"The Empolyee.\"[10]\n\nTokens: Six unique tokens are included: \"The Internet and You\" VHS Tape, '08 Stack, Old Phone, Nostalgia Goggles, Party Hat, and Tambourine.\n\nCopyright date: 2005 Released by: Parker Brothers/Hasbro Issued through: General release\n\nGame description: This anniversary edition came in a silver colored collector's tin with an outer plastic cover. Some copies came with a card, imprinted with a code, which could be used for a special anniversary contest: the chance to win US $15,140, which is the total amount of money included in every U.S. Monopoly game. The board is foil-wrapped, and the center artwork is done in a 1930s-art deco style, as are the playing tokens, houses and hotels. The currency and cards are also imprinted with a special art deco/70th anniversary motif.\n\nTokens: These are chrome-plated art-deco renderings of standard tokens: A dog, a speedboat, a locomotive, a ladies' high-heeled shoe, a wheelbarrow, an iron, a tophat, a thimble, a sportscar, a sack of money, a cannon and a horse with rider.\n\nOther features: Each of the twelve hotels has a unique design, and the thirty-two houses come in four distinct styles.\n\nCopyright date: 1998 Released by: USAopoly/Hasbro Issued through: General release\n\nFree Parking Kentucky Avenue\n\n$220ChanceIndiana Avenue\n\n$220Illinois Avenue\n\n$240B&O Railroad\n\n$200Atlantic Avenue\n\n$260Ventnor Avenue\n\n$260Water Works\n\n$150Marvin Gardens\n\n$280Go To Jail New York Avenue\n\n$200Star Trek Limited EditionPacific Avenue\n\n$300Tennessee Avenue\n\n$180North Carolina Avenue\n\n$300Community ChestCommunity ChestSt. James Place\n\n$180Pennsylvania Avenue\n\n$320Pennsylvania Railroad\n\n$200Short Line\n\n$200Virginia Avenue\n\n$160ChanceStates Avenue\n\n$140Park Place\n\n$350Electric Company\n\n$150Luxury Tax\n\n(pay $100)St. Charles Place\n\n$140Boardwalk\n\n$400 In Jail/Just VisitingConnecticut Avenue\n\n$120Vermont Avenue\n\n$100ChanceOriental Avenue\n\n$100Reading Railroad\n\n$200Income Tax\n\n(pay $200)Baltic Avenue\n\n$60Community ChestMediterranean Avenue\n\n$60Go\n\nGame description: Second in a proposed series of four Star Trek Monopoly editions (see entry on TNG edition above), the game's elements drew heavily from the Original Series' three-season run (but not the Animated Series). The paper currency was made to be different values of Federation Credits, houses became Constitution-class Starships, hotels became Starbases, Community Chest and Chance became Starfleet Orders and Captain's Log, respectively, and the cards were changed to be scenarios from different episodes, complete with the respective episode's Stardate. The Electric Company became Engineering, and the Water Works became Replicator. The four railroads became other Constitution-class Starships: The Constellation, the Intrepid, the Potemkin and the Defiant. The property spaces became aliens or specific adversaries, such as the Gorn, Kor, Nomad, tribbles or the Keeper.\n\nTokens: Eight included tokens represented the characters of James T. Kirk, Spock, Leonard McCoy, Montgomery Scott, Hikaru Sulu, Nyota Uhura, Pavel Chekov and Christine Chapel. An included certificate allowed game owners to mail or fax USAopoly for two additional tokens, representing characters from the original Star Trek pilot The Cage: Christopher Pike and Number One.\n\nOther features: A numbered Certificate of Authenticity was included, with two signatures. One was from Mr. Monopoly (the renamed Rich Uncle Pennybags), the fictional spokes-character of Monopoly, and the other was from William Shatner. The instructions booklet was titled Prime Directive, and it indicated that this edition was to be the second of four Star Trek themed games intended for release (though only one other, based on The Next Generation, was produced). If all four had been produced, they were intended to be linked in order to form a larger square board. (The instructions still give directions for playing with the boards from the two produced games.) Also included was an additional booklet, the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701 Ship's Manifest/Alien Species Identification Guide. The booklet could be flipped so that one side or the other could be read.\n\nCopyright date: 1998 Released by: USAopoly/Hasbro Issued through: General release\n\nFree Parking LoreChanceThe TravelerArdraShuttlecraft FeynmanTamarianCrystalline EntityReplicatorJ'NaiGo To Jail GomtuuStar Trek: The Next Generation Collectors' EditionHumanAcamarianCardassianCommunity ChestCommunity ChestMintakanTakaranShuttlecraft MagellanShuttlecraft JustmanAntedianChancePakledBorgWarp CoreLuxury TaxAllasomorphsQ In Jail/Just VisitingArmusBynarsChanceFanged HumanoidShuttlecraft HawkingIncome TaxFerengiCommunity ChestFarpoint StationGo\n\nGame description: First in a proposed series of four Star Trek Monopoly editions (only two were made; this and the Original Series edition listed below), the game's elements drew heavily from the series' seven-season run.

If all four had been produced, they were intended to be linked in order to form a larger square board. Also included was an additional booklet, the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D Ship's Manifest/Alien Species Identification Guide. The booklet could be flipped so that one side or the other could be read.\n\nCopyright date: 1996 Released by: Parker Brothers/Hasbro Issued through: General release\n\nFree Parking Landing PlatformImperial CardsCarbon Freezing ChamberReactor Control RoomX-Wing FighterThrone RoomCentral CoreMoisture FarmLanding BayGo To Jail Massassi TempleStar Wars Original Trilogy Edition (1996)Ewok VillageWar RoomForestRebel CardsRebel CardsTemple Throne RoomShield GeneratorMillennium FalconStar DestroyerLars HomesteadImperial CardsSpaceportMonument SquareReactor CoreBountyMos EisleyImperial Palace In Jail/Just VisitingFrozen PlainsEcho BaseImperial CardsNorth RidgeTie FighterDocking TaxSwampRebel CardsYoda's HutGo\n\nGame description: To mark the 20th anniversary of the release of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, two versions of Monopoly were released. One was a numbered, limited edition, which came with special Imperial Credit coins. The other (photographed here), was a general release. Paper currency in both editions are also printed as Imperial Credits – Coruscant, but use Aurebesh on the paper (as well as Arabic numerals – a translation guide to Aurebesh is printed on the back of the rules booklet). The game board features artwork and locations from Episodes IV-VI (the Classic Trilogy). Community Chest becomes Rebel Cards and Chance becomes Imperial Cards. The two tax spaces become Docking Tax (10% or 200 credits) and Bounty (75 credits). Some of the artwork (such as the photo stills used for the Tatooine spaces) comes from the 1997 Special Edition releases of the Classic Trilogy, whereas the illustration for the Imperial Palace comes from original concept artwork.\n\nOther features: Houses and hotels are replaced by X-Wing fighters and Corellian freighters (if the player is using a token of one of the rebels) or by TIE fighters and Star Destroyers (if the player is using the token of one of the Imperials, which includes Boba Fett). However, by standard Monopoly rules, only thirty-two maximum X-Wings/TIE Fighters are allowed to be in use (in place of houses), as well as a maximum of twelve Corellian freighters/Star Destroyers (in place of hotels).\n\nCopyright date: 1998 Released by: USAopoly under license from Hasbro, Wizard of Oz film elements licensed from Turner Entertainment Company Issued through: Originally exclusive to the Warner Brothers Studio Stores, copies also became available through USAopoly's website and other retailers.\n\nFree Parking Wicked Witch CornerGood Witch CardsHaunted ForrestMonkey MountainCourageWitch's CastleGuard's QuartersWater WorksGlenda GardensGo To Jail Poppy FieldThe Wizard of Oz Collector's Edition (1998)Emerald CityLand Of OzThe Wizard's HallBad Witch CardsBad Witch CardsApple OrchardBalloon CentralA HeartA Way HomeCowardly Lion's LairGood Witch CardsTin Man's Wood HillRuby Slippers WayElectric CompanyLuxury TaxScarecrow's CornfieldHome Sweet Home In Jail/Just VisitingGlenda's BubbleMunchkinlandGood Witch CardsThe RainbowA BrainTornado InsuranceKansasBad Witch CardsAuntie Em's FarmGo\n\nGame description: This was one of USAopoly's first boards that mixed a popular film license with their license to produce themed Monopoly boards. For The Wizard of Oz, properties are placed around the board in a sequence roughly paralleling the plot of the movie. Thus the brown spaces feature stills from the sepia-toned sequences of Kansas, the light blue spaces are from Munchkinland, and the green spaces are from the Emerald City. The Utilities remained the same, but the Electric Company is represented by a photo of the jolt that the Wicked Witch of the West received when trying to remove the Ruby Slippers, and the Water Works is represented by a photo of the sequence from the Wicked Witch melting (the space is also subtitled \"I'm Melting!!!\"). The Community Chest and Chance cards retained those names, but the spaces on the board are represented by the Wicked Witch's hat and Glinda's crown, respectively (and card texts were changed to match the theme). Houses and Hotels were recolored grey and green, and were renamed Farmhouses and Palaces. The dice are described as being ruby red. Currency features photographs of characters from the movie (from Toto on the $1 to Dorothy on the $500). While the dollar sign $ is used, the denominations are said to be in bricks (instead of dollars), issued by the Bank of Emerald City.\n\nTokens: Eight pewter tokens were included: Heads of Dorothy/Toto, the Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion, the Tin Man, a Tornado (with a house inside it), the Wicked Witch's hat, Glinda's crown and the pair of ruby slippers.\n\nCopyright date: 1985 Released by: Parker Brothers/Kenner Parker Toys Issued through: General release\n\nGame description: This is a Spanish translation of a U.S. Standard Edition Monopoly set. All placenames are literal translation of the original Atlantic City, New Jersey locations. Even the infamous misspelling of Marven Gardens is carried over, as Jardines Marvin on this board. All four railroads have the same names, the Electric Company and Water Works are also both kept. Under the space for Go, the Spanish word ¡Adelante! is written. The currency has the same colors and design as a standard U.S. set, with the legend \"Copyright 1935 by Parker Brothers Inc.\" Similarly, the Community Chest (Arca Communal) and Chance (Casualidad) cards feature the Uncle Pennybags/Mr. Monopoly character that was introduced in 1936. Houses are the standard green plastic, and hotels are the standard red plastic.\n\nTokens: These are also based on the standard U.S. Edition game set, as of 1985 they were: a cannon, a battleship, a dog, a horse and rider, a shoe, a tophat, a wheelbarrow, a thimble, an iron and a car.\n\nOther features: This 1985 edition was released by Parker Brothers as a division of the then Kenner Parker Toys, which was later bought out by Hasbro."
