A Fritzsche Brothers, Inc. Production. Photographed and Edited by Ernest Guenther, Ph, D, Narrated by Robert Hite. It doesn't list who's doing the music, but I really think it's interesting. https://www.discogs.com/Unknown-Artist-Essential-Oils-Of-The-Mediterranean/release/3334968\n\n— —\n\nAmanda H., 07/22/2020. Mr. Ernest Guenther was my great great uncle. I have always been fascinated by his travels around the world. One of my most prized possessions are his binoculars which went on his travels with him. I am trying to learn more about him and would love to hear from anyone if they have any photos or videos from his safaris.\n\n— —\n\nRoland Abate, 06/18/2019.
