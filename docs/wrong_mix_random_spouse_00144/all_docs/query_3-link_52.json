        "text": "Ric Bryant joined Janney in 2002 as a Senior Vice President after serving as a director with Alex, Brown and Sons. For the past 30 years, Ric has been helping individuals, families, and non-profit organizations achieve their financial objectives. His investment advice has been effective because it is based on a solid understanding of his clients’ goals, his personal commitment to the relationship as well as his experience in a wide variety of market environments.\n\nAn alumnus of Washington College, Ric also is a graduate of the Securities Industry Association’s program at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He is active in his community and has served as a board member for The Presbyterian Home of Maryland and Loch Raven Skeet and Trap. Ric is past vice chair of Maryland Special Olympics, former past President of the Pro Sports Chapter of Ducks Unlimited and former President of The Baltimore County Land Trust Alliance.

Zeller joined Janney in 2015 as a First Vice President. For over 35 years, Fred has been providing his clients with investment counsel and tailored financial solutions for their personal and/or business needs and goals. His dedication to combining a long-term investment approach with tax-advantaged strategies, has created a true family of clients—many of his relationships span three generations.\n\nDuring a long tenure at Legg Mason, Fred was selected to collaborate with the firm’s compliance department in creating a company-wide policy on mutual fund purchasing. Before that he served as a Financial Advisor Technology Coordinator; in that capacity, Fred assisted advisor colleagues with technology initiatives and best practices. Additionally, for many years, Fred taught adult education classes for Baltimore County Community College and Baltimore County Schools introducing the mechanics and basic investment strategies.\n\nFred supports and participates in many of Janney’s charitable endeavors. He enjoys spending time with his siblings and many nieces and nephews. He enjoys playing golf, is an avid music fan and driving enthusiast.\n\nCarrie Jarmer joined Janney 2004. She began her financial career working with three financial advisors as a Registered Private Client Assistant. Later, she started a dual role and became the Operations Manager for the Towson Branch, working directly with the Branch Manager, the Financial Advisors as well as the Corporate office, overseeing the compliance, support staff and office related matters. Career progression led to Carrie becoming a Supervisor of Managers, responsible for overseeing the Firm’s Producing Branch Managers in the Northern and Florida Regions. Carrie joined RCR Wealth Advisors in 2016 as a Financial Advisor working with Ric Bryant, helping individuals and families toward achieving their financial goals through financial and retirement planning.\n\nCarrie holds Series 7, 66, 9, 10 and 31 securities licenses as well as Maryland Life & Health licenses. She attained the Accredited Wealth Management AdvisorSM (AWMA®), Retirement Income Certified Professional (RICP®), Chartered Retirement Planning Counselor (CRPC®), and Certified in Long Term Care (CLTC®) designation. The AWMA certification is the culmination of intense coursework and exams on how to better serve clients at any stage in their life. Courses focus on: asset management, investment strategy, estate planning, taxes, and more. The RICP and CRPC program focuses on the unique strategies to plan for retirement income. Topics covered include understanding the retirement income planning landscape and psychology of retirees, building asset allocations and advanced estate planning techniques that may help to reduce risk and mitigate taxation issues. The CLTC designation is primarily focused on the tools of providing care over a prolonged period of time. A professional with a CLTC designation has acquired the critical tools necessary to discuss the subject of longevity and its acute consequences on a client’s family – financially, physically and emotionally – years down the road. The best way to protect families from the potential devastation of long-term care is not to sell a product, but rather, offer advice that leads to a plan to mitigate those consequences.\n\nCarrie is a mother of two daughters, one who has “left the nest” and one in high school. She is a member of The Women’s Club of Roland Park, on the Board and Chair of their Finance Committee as well as a former member of First Financial Credit Union Supervisory Committee.

He also holds FINRA Series 7, 66, and Maryland Life & Health licenses, and received a B.A. in Communications Studies from the University of Maryland, College Park.\n\nRustin is a board member for My Neighbors Foundation, a non-profit with a mission to give Hereford Zone students the chance to participate equally in their community, and an active member of the Baltimore Estate Planning Council.
