This plan focuses on the Park’s purposes, its significant attributes, its mission in relation to the overall mission of the agency, what activities are appropriate within these constraints, and resource protection strategies. It provides guidelines for visitor use and development of facilities for visitor enjoyment and administration of the Park. It serves as the overall umbrella guidance under which more detailed activity or implementation plans are prepared.\n\nThe previous General Management Plan was approved for the Death Valley National Monument lands in 1989. The establishment of wilderness and addition of over a million acres of new lands by the California Desert Protection Act in 1994 requires the development of a new general management plan.\n\nThis General Management Plan seeks to extend the existing management strategies that are in place for the previous Death Valley National Monument, and the National Park Service mission and policies, to the management of the resources within the new lands added to the unit in 1994 by the California Desert Protection Act. It also strives to incorporate the designation of 95% of the Park as wilderness into the management approach. This plan addresses the removal of feral burros and horses from the Park in order to achieve the National Park Service mission of managing the unit for native desert species. It also recognizes the need to work cooperatively with the Bureau of Land Management on adjacent land, where their mandate from Congress is to maintain viable herds of wild horses and burros. The plan addresses the establishment of a permanent Homeland for the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe.\n\nThis plan attempts to balance the preservation of resources mission with specific mandates from Congress at no more than the level occurring in 1994. In Death Valley, the California Desert Protection Act provides for the continuation of grazing on the new lands. This plan addresses grazing as a component of the management. This plan identifies a number of activity level plans needed to address site specific issues, such as the Saline Valley Warm Springs management and a wilderness/backcountry management plan. This plan seeks funding for acquisition of private property from willing sellers, and/or mineral interests where proposed uses conflict with the primary mission of preserving resources and providing for visitor enjoyment.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK\n\nDeath Valley National Monument was established by presidential proclamation under the Antiquities Act of 1906, on February 11, 1933. The original monument contained approximately 1,601,800 acres. Supplementary proclamations in March 1937 and January 1952 increased the monument ’s acreage to 2,067,793 acres. The monument was subsequently enlarged and changed to Death Valley National Park by Congressional action on October 31, 1994, with the passage of the California Desert Protection Act. Approximately 1.3 million acres of new lands were added, bringing the total acreage of the new Park to about 3,396,192 acres. Nearly 95% of the Park was designated as wilderness by that same act. Death Valley National Park is the largest national park unit in the conterminous 48 states. The vast majority of its lands are located in the California counties of Inyo and San Bernardino, but a small portion of the Park is located in the Nevada counties of Nye and Esmeralda. California State Highway 190 crosses the Park east to west, and Highway 95 parallels the Park north to south on the Park’s eastern boundary.\n\nDeath Valley National Park is the lowest point in the Western Hemisphere and one of the hottest places in the world. It is also a vast geological museum, containing examples of most of the earth’s geologic eras. Here, plant and animal species, some of which occur nowhere else in the world, have adapted to the harsh desert environment. Humans have adjusted to these severe conditions, as evidenced by extensive archeological sites; historical sites related to successive waves of prospectors; miners, and homesteaders; present-day residences of Native Americans; and the current resort developments and active mines.\n\nPerhaps the Park’s greatest assets today are the clear air, vast open spaces that stretch toward distant horizons, and the overwhelming silence. Approximately 1.2 million people a year (1999 numbers) come to Death Valley to experience the stark and lonely vastness of the valley; the panorama of rugged canyons and mountains; the pleasures of the dry, moderate winter climate; the challenge of the hot, arid summer; the relief of the cooler mountains; and the reminders of frontier and Native American ways of life.\n\nDeath Valley National Park includes all of Death Valley, a 156-mile-long north/south-trending trough that formed between two major block-faulted mountain ranges: the Amargosa Range on the east and the Panamint Range on the west. Telescope Peak, the highest peak in the Park and in the Panamint Mountains, rises 11,049 feet above sea level and lies only 15 miles from the lowest point in the United States in the Badwater Basin salt pan, 282 feet below sea level. The California Desert Protection Act added most of the Saline, Eureka, northern Panamint, and Greenwater valleys to the Park.\n\nThe diversity of Death Valley’s plant communities result partly from the region’s location in the Mojave Desert, a zone of tension and overlap between the Great Basin Desert to the north and the Sonoran Desert to the south (Kearney and Peebles 1960). This location, combined with the great relief found within the Park, from 282 feet below sea level to 11,049 feet above sea level, supports vegetation typical of three biotic life zones: the lower Sonoran, the Canadian, and the Arctic/Alpine in portions of the Panamint Range (Jepson 1923; Storer and Usinger 1968). Based on Munz and Keck (1968) classifications, seven plant communities can be categorized within these life zones, each characterized by dominant vegetation and representative of three vegetation types: scrub, desert woodland, and coniferous forest. Microhabitats further subdivide some communities into zones, especially on the valley floor.\n\nDeath Valley National Park and the adjacent desert support a variety of wildlife species, including 51 species of native mammals, 307 species of birds, 36 species of reptiles, three species of amphibians, and five species and one subspecies of native fishes (Hansen 1972 and 1973; Landye 1973). Small mammals are more numerous than large mammals, such as desert bighorn, coyote, bobcat, mountain lion, and mule deer. Mule deer are present in the pinyon/ juniper associations of the Grapevine, Cottonwood, and Panamint mountains.\n\nMany historic properties exist within the Park. Most of those meeting the national register criteria for significance and integrity have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Most of the sites contain structures or other tangible remains of the activities that took place there. Death Valley National Park is unique because it displays a continuum of mining activities from at least the 1860s to the present day. Many historic mining resources are of particular significance either because similar resources are not found elsewhere within the national park system or because they are in a better state of preservation than examples found elsewhere.\n\nPURPOSE AND MANAGEMENT\n\nAn essential part of the planning process is understanding the purpose and significance of the land for which the plan is being prepared. In the case of federal lands, Congress provides the purpose(s) of the unit and the mission of the agency charged with managing the area. Significance is usually determined by familiarity with the natural and cultural resources of the region, although some significant elements are often recognized in the enabling legislation.\n\nMISSION\n\nDeath Valley National Park Mission: Death Valley National Park dedicates itself to protecting significant desert features that provide world class scenic, scientific, and educational opportunities for visitors and academics to explore and study.\n\nNPS Mission: The National Park Service mission was clearly stated in its 1916 Organic Act:\n\n“…the fundamental purpose of the said parks, monuments, and reservations, which purpose is to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.”\n\nPURPOSE\n\nPreserve the unrivaled scenic, geologic, and natural resources of these unique natural landscapes, while perpetuating significant and diverse ecosystems of the California desert in their natural state. Ensure the maximum protection of wilderness values provided by law.\n\nPreserve the cultural resources of the California desert associated with prehistoric, historic and contemporary Native American culture, patterns of western exploration, settlement and mining endeavors.\n\nProvide opportunities for compatible public outdoor recreation and promote the public’s understanding and appreciation of the California desert by interpreting the natural and cultural resources.\n\nRetain and enhance opportunities for scientific research in undisturbed ecosystems.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE\n\nDeath Valley National Park contains the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below sea level. The valley floor receives the least precipitation in the United States (average 1.84 inches per year) and is the site of the nation’s highest and the world’s second highest recorded temperature (134 degrees Fahrenheit or 57 degrees Celsius).\n\nDeath Valley National Park is world renowned for its exposed, complex and diverse geology and tectonics, and for its unusual geologic features, providing a natural geologic museum that represents a substantial portion of the earth’s history.\n\nDeath Valley has been the continuous home of Native Americans, from prehistoric cultures to the present day Timbisha Shoshone Tribe.\n\nThe extremely colorful, complex, and highly visible geology and steep, rugged mountains and canyons provide some of the most dramatic visual landscapes in the United States.\n\nDeath Valley National Park contains one of the nation’s most diverse and significant fossil records and most continuous volcanic histories.\n\nDeath Valley National Park contains five major sand dune systems representing all types of dune structures, making it one of the only places on earth where this variety of dune types occurs in such close proximity. It also contains the highest dunes in California — Eureka Sand Dunes.\n\nDeath Valley National Park is one of the largest expanses of protected warm desert in the world. Ninety-five percent of the Park is designated wilderness, providing unique opportunities for quiet, solitude, and primitive adventure in an extreme desert ecosystem.\n\nContrary to many visitors’ first impression, Death Valley National Park’s natural resources are extremely diverse, containing a large variety of plant species and community types. The area preserves large expanses of creosote bush valleys and other vegetation typical of the Mojave Desert. Extreme conditions and isolation provide habitat for an unusually high number of plant and animal species that are highly adapted to these conditions.\n\nDeath Valley National Park has an extensive and well-preserved mining history representing over 100 years of mining technology.\n\nDeath Valley National Park contains an unusually high number of well-preserved archeological sites, including rock art and alignments.\n\nScotty’s Castle, with its architectural style, quality, and priceless collection of antiques and art objects, built in a remote, isolated desert location in the early 1900s, is an icon that has immense public appeal.\n\nPRIMARY INTERPRETIVE THEMES\n\nThe primary Park stories or interpretive themes are overview statements that provide the basis for communicating the purpose and significance of the Park and provide the elements that the Park believes each visitor should develop an understanding of during their visit. Interpretation is a process of education designed to stimulate curiosity and convey messages to the visiting public. These themes will be developed during the preparation of a comprehensive interpretive plan for the Park and will guide the development of interpretive materials (signs, brochures, walks, talks, etc.).\n\nMANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES\n\nNATURAL AND CULTURAL RESOURCES\n\nMaintain, preserve, interpret, and perpetuate the aesthetic setting, and the natural and cultural resources, of Death Valley National Park in such as manner as to:\n\nProtect the significant natural and cultural resources and values of the Park, including geologic features, and to foster an improved understanding of natural processes through monitoring efforts and scientific research.\n\nPerpetuate native plants and animal life for their essential roles in the natural ecosystem.\n\nStrive to reduce or eliminate alien species to ensure long-term survival of the native ecosystem.\n\nEnsure the perpetuation of rare and endangered plants and animals and those species endemic (specific) to Death Valley National Park.\n\nPerpetuate and increase water resource science and conservation.\n\nPerpetuate the Devils Hole pupfish in the detached Devils Hole section of the Park.\n\nEliminate existing and prohibit new occurrences of all activities inconsistent with the protection of the natural ecosystem, except in the Park’s developed areas, as noted in the Park’s management plans.\n\nRestore to natural appearance, inasmuch as feasible, the land surfaces disturbed by man, recognizing that significant cultural values must be preserved.\n\nProhibit or minimize the adverse effects of mining and mineral development that conflict with resource preservation and public appreciation of natural and cultural values.\n\nProvide for the reclamation of mining areas and the eventual completion or phaseout of mining.\n\nMaintain air quality monitoring to facilitate implementation of means to prevent deterioration of air quality and visibility.\n\nContinue to pursue redesignation of Death Valley National Park from a class II floor area to a class I air quality area.\n\nPrevent, eliminate, or reduce artificial lighting and noise in order to preserve the opportunity for visitors to experience the night sky and stillness of the desert.\n\nPerpetuate unimpaired the Park’s cultural and archeological resources, protecting them from vandalism, unauthorized excavation, collection, or appropriation.\n\nProtect the Park’s collections of natural and cultural objects from deterioration, natural disaster, misuse, and loss.\n\nOperate and manage Scotty’s Castle, its grounds, and environs to recreate the atmosphere of the period of its construction and occupation by Walter Scott and Mr. and Mrs. Albert Johnson.\n\nSupport research programs pertaining to natural and cultural resources and to social sciences, consistent with the Park’s resource protection and visitor services mission.\n\nWILDERNESS VALUES\n\nManage and protect wilderness values and resources so as to ensure public understanding and appreciation of the vast wilderness assets of the Park.\n\nStrive to restore disturbed areas in wilderness.\n\nVISITOR USE\n\nProvide the visitor to Death Valley National Park with the opportunity to discover, explore, and understand the natural and cultural resources of the Park.\n\nINTERPRETIVE SERVICES\n\nOffer a variety of quality informational services that differ in format, media, and intensity of presentation, and that are sensitive to the special needs, interests, and cultural backgrounds of a diverse mix of visitors.\n\nOffer visitors an understanding of Park values and resources, and include as an integral part of interpretive materials major Park management and resource protection challenges.\n\nEnhance the visitor understanding of Native American cultures.\n\nMaximize opportunities for visitor enjoyment and appreciation of interpretive services, facilities, and resources, consistent with other Park management objectives.\n\nProvide information on the surrounding area, including appropriate safety awareness for visitor use of rugged, isolated Death Valley and its environs.\n\nMaintain a library and a study collection operation that is up-to-date and reflects current preservation policies.\n\nMaximize services (talks, facilities) for educational and other groups that enrich the Park’s database and enhance their understanding and appreciation of Death Valley.\n\nRECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES\n\nPermit access to all areas of the Park, consistent with resource protection objectives and within optimum carrying capacities/use limits.\n\nOffer a variety of recreational opportunities that are sensitive to the range of visitor interests, physical capabilities, and time and financial limitations.\n\nProvide an opportunity for exploring the backcountry, experiencing the wildness of the high Panamint, Grapevine, Cottonwood, and Funeral ranges, as well as camping and sight-seeing in a setting of climatic relief from the valley floor;

Additional planning efforts that may be undertaken over the next ten years include the following:\n\ncomprehensive interpretive plan\n\nwilderness/backcountry management plan\n\nfire management plan\n\nroad management plan\n\ngrazing management plan\n\nsite management plan for Saline Valley*\n\ndevelopment concept plan for Furnace Creek/Cow Creek*\n\ndevelopment concept plan for Grapevine\n\nupdated development concept plan for Stovepipe Wells\n\ncommercial services plan\n\nhistoric resources study/development concept plan for Scotty’s Castle\n\nsign plan\n\nwayside exhibit plan\n\nsite management plan for Eureka Dunes\n\nminerals management plan\n\ninventorying and monitoring plan*\n\nnatural and cultural resource management plan updates*\n\n(This plan will cover the entire Park, rather than just the newly acquired areas).\n\ncooperative program plans with Timbisha Shoshone Tribe*\n\nWildrose site plan\n\nannual strategic plan\n\nPlans in bold text are either currently being prepared or already exist as of September 2001. Those with asterisks are considered the highest priority plans to initiate next.\n\nThe Plan\n\nOverview\n\nThe plan seeks to extend the existing Park management strategies and the NPS mission and policies to the management of the resources within the new lands added to the Park in 1994. It also strives to incorporate the designation of 95% of the Park as wilderness into the management approach. The Park will seek to protect resources commensurate with the visitor use mandate as the highest priority, with no derogation of Park values.\n\nThe plan addresses the removal of feral burros and horses from the Park in order to achieve the NPS mission of managing the unit for native desert species. It also recognizes the need to work cooperatively with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) on adjacent land where that agency’s mandate from Congress is to manage wild horses and burros so as to”achieve and maintain a thriving natural ecological balance on public lands”where Herd Management Areas were established in 1971 and are in existence today. Eliminating some or all burros from an area to achieve a”thriving natural ecological balance”is a BLM option.\n\nThe plan strives to balance the preservation of resources mission with specific mandates from Congress, while not allowing derogation of Park values. For example, grazing would continue at no more than current levels on the new lands, as per the California Desert Protection Act. Grazing is treated as a component of management. Of four total allotments, two allotments are eliminated and one is retired, leaving one allotment remaining within the Park.\n\nThe plan identifies a number of other activity level plans needed to address site specific issues, such as the Saline Valley Warm Springs management and a wilderness/ backcountry management plan.\n\nThe plan adopts a land acquisition strategy that seeks funding to allow acquisition of most private land from willing sellers based on priorities identified in the”Land Protection Plan.”\n\nSummary of Plan Actions\n\nNATURAL RESOURCES\n\nAir quality:\n\nSeek class I designation.\n\nContinue air monitoring program, participate national air quality network, and monitor ozone and particulate matter.\n\nViewsheds:\n\nPrepare guidelines for developed areas to create harmony between the built environment and the natural environment.\n\nImplement objectives for communications equipment proposals.\n\nNight Sky:\n\nCooperate with neighbors and local government agencies to minimize artificial light intrusion.\n\nUse artificial outdoor lighting limited to basic safety requirements and shielded to keep light on the intended subject and out of the night sky.\n\nEstablish baseline light measurements for night use for monitoring changes over time.\n\nNoise and Overflights:\n\nStrive to preserve the natural quiet and sounds associated with the physical and biological resources.\n\nCollaborate with the Department of Defense to minimize impacts on visitors and resources from military overflights.\n\nWater Resources:\n\nAssertively compile water related baseline data.\n\nSeek to protect, perpetuate, and possibly restore surface water and groundwater as integral components of Park aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.\n\nSurface water and groundwater withdrawn for the Park’s use will be the amount necessary to achieve Park purposes.\n\nStrive to maintain the water levels at Devils Hole.\n\nMonitor wells and springs including Darwin Falls and in at least nine water delivery systems.\n\nAvoid occupancy and modification of floodplain and wetland areas.\n\nDefend federally reserved water rights through the state of California and Nevada administrative processes and, if necessary, seek judicial remedy in the appropriate courts.\n\nIdentify as a federally reserved water right all unappropriated water from any water source identified on federal lands within the boundaries of designated wilderness and/or park areas in the California desert.\n\nExamine the use of and need for all guzzlers, livestock tanks, and troughs. Eliminate unneeded and/or unused facilities.\n\nRetain water developments for native plants and wildlife that are needed to mitigate for local water losses due to previous human activities.\n\nRestore natural water sources to be self-sustaining.\n\nPaleontological Resources:\n\nProtect and preserve paleontological resources for public enjoyment, interpretation, and scientific research in accordance with Park management objectives and approved resource management plans.\n\nSeek to develop collaborative partnerships with government agencies, academic institutions, and public and private organizations with paleontological resource management or research capabilities/expertise.\n\nGeological Resources:\n\nProtect geological features through random patrols of the backcountry as well as limited public closures to protect sensitive sites.\n\nUSGS will map the park’s exposed geology.\n\nCave Resources:\n\nAvoid development of caves and to perpetuate natural conditions, while seeking to protect the resource.\n\nSpecies and Habitats of Special Consideration:\n\nIdentify and promote the conservation of all federally listed or proposed threatened or endangered species and their critical habitats within Park boundaries in ways that were consistent with the purposes of the Endangered Species Act.\n\nIdentify and map distribution of plant and animal species considered rare or unique to the Park.\n\nContinue to manage and protect the 40-acre area known as Devils Hole, its endangered pupfish and other sensitive aquatic and terrestrial plants and animals.\n\nThe FWS prepared a biological opinion for the Devils Hole pupfish on August 14, 2001.\n\nConduct Devils Hole pupfish counts on a biannual basis.\n\nA site management plan for the Eureka Dunes area addresses protection of sensitive species.\n\nIntroduced Species:\n\nNonnative plants and animals will not be introduced except under the most unusual circumstances.\n\nBurros:\n\nAdopt “no burro or wild horse” strategy that exists for the former monument lands and apply it to newly added Park lands.\n\nRemoval of horses and burros from Park lands will be completed through a three phase removal program. Phase one consists of a Park-wide live capture program that will be in effect for a maximum of five years. Phase two consists of soliciting interested animal protection groups to begin removing the remaining few animals. An agreement will be signed with the group(s) to provide up to 2 years to remove the remaining burros and wild horses from the Park at their expense. In phase three, NPS staff will eliminate the remaining few animals in the most cost-effective and humane manner to achieve a zero population. Removal efforts could involve a variety of techniques including, but not limited to shooting, wrangler/helicopter roundups, and netting removal with helicopters. Phase three will continue for an indefinite time.\n\nDevelop a cooperative agreement that assures that the BLM will take steps to control herds adjacent to the Park and will remove trespass burros and wild horses.\n\nOther Nonnative Species:\n\nEradicate exotic species to the extent feasible.\n\nControl aquatic species, such as mosquito fish, goldfish, crayfish, and bullfrogs, to a level eliminating their adverse impacts, or extirpate altogether from Park habitats.\n\nActively pursue removal of nonnative tamarisk.\n\nContinue limited programs to control Russian thistle and hornwort.\n\nDisturbed Land Restoration:\n\nSeek to perpetuate native plant life as part of natural ecosystems.\n\nIn natural areas landscape conditions caused by natural phenomena such as landslides, earthquakes, floods, and natural fires will not be modified unless required for public safety, protection of NPS facilities, or necessary reconstruction of dispersed-use facilities, such as trails.\n\nRehabilitate abandoned mine sites.\n\nCultural zones will be managed as historic landscapes.\n\nFire Management:\n\nAssess and document the state of existing fire effects research in desert ecosystems and formulate a desert fire management strategy.\n\nSuppression of wildfires, and implementation of all fire management actions using methods, equipment and tactics which cause the least impact to natural and cultural resources.\n\nDevelop fire management strategies based on the best available science, field observations of fire effects and post-burn monitoring of selected sites.\n\nPeriodically update the Park “Fire Management Plan.”\n\nResearch:\n\nProcure the best science to meet resource protection and management requirements.\n\nIssue research permits or scientific

Monitoring:\n\nDevelop and implement a systematic, integrated program to identify, inventory, and monitor the Park’s natural resources.\n\nUpdate Natural and Cultural Resources Management Plan to reflect the changes that are proposed in this General Management Plan.\n\nCULTURAL RESOURCES\n\nDevelop and implement a systematic, integrated program to identify, inventory, monitor, evaluate, and nominate archeological sites, historic properties, cultural landscapes, and ethnographic resources to the national register, and manage, protect, and preserve such listed properties in a way that will preserve their documented archeological, architectural, ethnographic, historic, or research values.\n\nDevelop and implement a systematic applied cultural resource research program.\n\nResource Management Plan will address the requirements, projects, and funding to implement the cultural resource program.\n\nNATIVE AMERICAN INTERESTS\n\n314 acres at Furnace Creek in Death Valley National Park encompassing the present Timbisha Village Site have been transferred to the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe.\n\nOther arrangements authorizing tribal access to and traditional uses of, certain designated areas which will remain in public ownership have been recommended.\n\nDevelopment and resource use activities will be subject to NEPA and public review.\n\nVISITOR USE, SERVICES, AND

This will include, but will not be limited to, visitor facilities in Beatty, Baker, and Lone Pine, as well as possibly other communities. It also includes the potential establishment of a satellite office in or around areas east of the Park to provide office space for some employees, storage and possibly curation.\n\nEmployee Housing:\n\nA development concept plan underway for the Grapevine area will recommend providing housing and replacing the existing trailers for the northern district of the Park. Ongoing trailer replacement with permanent houses will continue until completed.\n\nPrior to constructing additional housing for employees, evaluate the location of the housing and make a determination about whether private housing elsewhere within a one hour drive could serve the same need, and whether the total housing units are the minimum necessary to meet the mission of the Park.\n\nSolid Waste Disposal:\n\nHaul solid waste disposal to approved landfills outside the Park.\n\nExpand recycling program.\n\nLANDOWNERSHIP AND USE\n\nPark Boundary and Authorized Acreage:\n\nNo boundary changes proposed. Clerical or drafting corrections may be made to the maps and legal descriptions.\n\nWilderness:\n\nManage wilderness areas for the use and enjoyment of the American people in a way that would leave them unimpaired for future use and enjoyment as wilderness.\n\nMotorized access through wilderness to maintain grazing developments could be considered under section 708 of the CDPA.\n\nUse minimum tool determination prior to granting approval for motorized/mechanical equipment use within wilderness.\n\nThe California Desert Protection Act modifies some provisions of the Wilderness Act.\n\nContinue process of determining and mapping wilderness boundaries.\n\nLand Acquisition:\n\nA Land Protection Plan has been prepared.\n\nSeek funds to acquire private lands and interests in the Park based on priorities presented in the Land Protection Plan.\n\nDonations and exchanges of real property from willing sellers will be a priority, and third party acquisitions from willing sellers will be encouraged.\n\nExchange of state school sections in the new lands will continue to be actively exchanged pursuant to the California Desert Protection Act direction.\n\nMineral Development Activities:\n\nAdminister mineral development activities under existing laws and regulations applicable to such activities.\n\nProposed mining operations must file a plan of operations and must meet the approval standards provided in the regulations and post a performance bond equivalent to the cost of reclamation before an operation will proceed.\n\nSection 305 of the California Desert Protection Act withdrew the Park from all forms of entry, appropriation or disposal under the public land laws; from location, entry and patent under the United States mining laws; and from disposition under all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal leasing and the sale of mineral materials.\n\nSeek funding to initiate acquisition of mineral rights whenever a proposed mineral development fails to meet the regulatory approval standards and no alternative development scenario is feasible.\n\nUndertake a sensitive resource analysis based on an objective analysis of physical, biological, cultural and visitor use values relative to projected mining impacts.\n\nAbandoned Mines:\n\nConduct a comprehensive inventory of all Abandoned Mineral Lands (AML) sites to serve as the basis for future planning and reclamation program implementation.\n\nSand and Gravel for Road Maintenance:\n\nEvaluate use of borrow sources for road maintenance during the preparation of the road management plan.\n\nGrazing:\n\nNo grazing is permitted on the former monument lands.\n\nAs authorized by the California Desert Protection Act of 1994, the privilege of cattle grazing within the Park shall continue at no more than the October 31, 1994 level and is subject to applicable NPS regulations, policies, and Park management direction.\n\nNo grazing will be permitted on the NPS portions of the Eureka Valley or Lacey-CactusMcCloud BLM allotments. No permit has been issued on the Last Chance allotment since 1996 due to the lack of forage. The NPSconsiders this area of the Park to be permanently retired from grazing. Work with the permittee on the Hunter Mountain allotment to develop grazing practices and levels, not to exceed 1,105 AUMs through development of a grazing management plan.\n\nWork to acquire base property from willing ranchers.\n\nA grazing management plan will include how many cattle and the time and place where these cattle will be allowed to graze, seasonal restrictions, the placement/movement of mineral blocks and water facilities as a tool to alter cattle use patterns, pasture rotation, etc.\n\nFees will be based on BLM schedules and NPS Special Use Permit costs. Grazing fees will be used for Park resource management and restoration projects.\n\nRequire permittee to access wilderness on foot or horseback, similar to other users.\n\nUse a minimum tool determination prior to granting approval for motorized/mechanical equipment use within wilderness.\n\nIf livestock use including water use degrades wilderness values, the number of livestock will be reduced to appropriate levels.\n\nNatural Resources\n\nPHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT\n\nAir Quality\n\nBackground\n\nThe management and enforcement of the Clean Air Act’s air quality standards in the Death Valley National Park area is conducted by two entities, the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District and the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District. The Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District includes the desert portion of San Bernardino County (within the South East Desert Air Basin) and the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District includes Inyo and Mono Counties (within the Great Basin Valley Air Basin).\n\nCongress established the Prevention of Significant Deterioration program as part of the Clean Air Act. To facilitate the implementation of this program, an area classification scheme was established. This classification scheme has class I receiving the highest degree of protection with only small amounts of certain kinds of additional air pollution (sulfur dioxide and particulate matter) allowed. The other two areas are class II, which allows moderate increases in certain air pollutants; and class III, which allows a large amount of new air pollution (Congress has yet to designate any class III areas). There are no class I areas in the California Mojave Desert. Death Valley National Park is a class II”floor”area, meaning that it may never be redesignated to class III.\n\nThe Clean Air Act developed national ambient air quality standards for a finite number of criteria pollutants. The criteria pollutants are: sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, total suspended particulates, nitrogen oxides, lead, ozone, and particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10).\n\nNonattainment areas are areas that are not in compliance with the national ambient air quality standards, and therefore must reduce pollution to reach compliance. The San Bernardino County portion of Death Valley National Park is in nonattainment for California’s state ozone standards.\n\nFederal PM10 nonattainment areas include the San Bernardino County desert area, Owens Valley, Mammoth Lakes, Mono Basin, and the Searles Valley planning area. Mono and the eastern portion of Inyo counties have not recorded PM10 emissions in excess of the national standards.\n\nOne nearby source of pollution is the Searles Valley (Trona) complex that produces soda ash, borax,\n\nNaval Air Weapons Station, Briggs Mine, and Panamint Valley Limestone Quarry. Air quality monitoring activities occur at Death Valley National Park and at the Briggs Mine. The Briggs Mine has two real time PM10 monitors that collect data continuously. This data is reported to the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District on a quarterly basis. This system is set up to allow the district to access the real time data via a modem.\n\nExposed lakebeds and farmlands lie in the Owens Valley and Mono Basin between mountain ranges. Wind-carried dust from these exposed lands in the valley adversely affect air quality over the area (U.S. Forest Service, 1988). Visibility has been affected to the extent that Department of Defense test flights over the Owens Valley are hampered or shut down 6 to 12 times each year (U.S. Forest Service, 1988). The county, the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District, the city of Los Angeles, the Department of Defense, and the Inyo National Forest are making coordinated efforts to resolve this concern.\n\nLocal pollution sources in the desert consist primarily of particulate matter from offroad vehicles, windblown soil, mining operations, livestock grazing, and agricultural activities. These sources have left certain areas denuded or sparsely vegetated, allowing wind erosion to occur and air quality to suffer, occasionally causing particulate standards violations at some locations.\n\nDeath Valley National Park currently has an air quality monitoring program which monitors ozone (including meteorology) and particulates. Both are managed under the NPS national program contracts. The Park will soon be adding wet and dry acid deposition monitoring. All air quality monitoring occurs at a monitoring station at Cow Creek, 5 miles north of Furnace Creek.\n\nThe National Park Service is responsible for protecting air quality under both the 1916 Organic Act and the Clean Air Act. Although the Clean Air Act gives the highest level of air quality protection to class I areas, it provides many opportunities for the National Park Service to participate in the development of pollution control programs to preserve, protect, and enhance the air quality of all units of the national park system, including class II areas. The National Park Service will seek class I designation for the Park.\n\nSections 118 and 176 of the Clean Air Act require federal agencies/facilities to meet all federal, state, and local air pollution control laws and regulations. In the case of units/facilities located in areas not meeting federal or state air pollution control standards (nonattainment areas), the units/facilities must conform to requirements established to attain and maintain those standards. The requirements could include provisions to reduce emissions from existing facilities and limit emissions from proposed facilities on a greater than 1:1 basis.\n\nA more efficient and comprehensive approach for reducing regional haze that veils scenic vistas in parks was announced in April 1999 in a final rule. This rule builds upon existing air pollution control programs which are designed primarily to protect public health, and the first plans are due at the same time states submit plans for meeting new health-based air quality standards adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency (2005–2008). But, the rule requires steady and continuing emission reductions even after health goals are met and sets a target date of 2064 for achieving”natural”visibility conditions in national parks and wilderness areas. States will be required to submit 10-year plans, with measures needed to stay on track toward that target (at least a 10% improvement in visibility each decade). Irrespective of what other measures states may choose to adopt, the rule requires that the “best available retrofit technology”(BART) be installed at hundreds of power plants and industrial facilities that were built without pollution controls and have otherwise avoided installing modern technology. States will have the option of achieving BART-or-better emission reductions through economic incentives or market-based programs.\n\nPlan Actions\n\nThe National Park Service will seek to perpetuate the best possible air quality in the Park because of its critical importance to visitor enjoyment, human health, scenic vistas, and the preservation of natural systems and cultural resources. The National Park Service will work to promote and pursue measures to safeguard these values from the adverse impacts from air pollution. The National Park Service will strive to set the best example for others to follow in their development and management activities. When the impacts of existing or potential air pollution on Park resources are unclear, the National Park Service will err on the side of protecting air quality and related values for future generations. The Park’s air monitoring program will continue. Death Valley National Park has a National Oceanographic & Atmospheric Administration weather station at Furnace Creek and will continue to be a participating member of a national air quality network and will monitor ozone and particulate matter.\n\nSince the Park is located in a nonattainment area for one or more air pollutants, no actions taken will lead to violations of federal or state air pollution control laws or regulations nor will they increase emissions that will violate the state conformity requirements. Park staff will work with air pollution control officials to ensure compliance with those requirements.\n\nViewsheds\n\nBackground\n\nVisibility is probably the most important air quality resource in the desert region, and it is the most easily affected by activities that generate dust (especially fine particulates) and sulfur dioxide. Visibility impacts occur from long-range transport of pollutants from as far away as the San Joaquin Valley and the Los Angeles basin (RESOLVE study 1988, cited in BLM 1995).\n\nLocal pollution sources in the desert consist primarily of particulate matter from off-road vehicles, windblown soil, mining operations, livestock grazing, and agricultural activities. These sources have left certain areas denuded or sparsely vegetated, allowing wind erosion to occur and air quality to suffer and occasionally causing violations of particulate standards at many locations.\n\nPlan Actions\n\nThe Park will prepare guidelines for the developed areas. These guidelines will be prepared to establish visual consistency and themes in facility development. Guidelines will also be created for reaching visual compatibility with surrounding landscapes, significant architectural features, and site details. The primary objective of guidelines will be to create harmony between the built environment and the natural environment.\n\nWith the increasing use of cellular communication equipment, more antennas and relay equipment are being installed throughout the country. The overall management goal of each NPS unit will be to protect and maintain the visual quality of the landscape and the built environment. The Park will implement the following objectives for communications equipment proposals:\n\nAll above-ground communication equipment should not significantly distract from the visual quality of the scenery.\n\nEach new proposal for radio or cellular antennas or towers must demonstrate that the equipment will provide a critical service for visitors and NPS staff and is not duplicative.\n\nThe installation of new equipment outside the Park or on existing communication towers or at defined sites should be considered before the construction of new sites in Park is considered.\n\nNew locations will be reviewed through the environmental assessment process, which must consider impacts on the visual quality of the scenery.\n\nThe National Park Service will work with neighboring landowners on topics of mutual interest being sensitive to the influences and effects that Park management might have on adjacent landowners. The National Park Service will seek to enhance beneficial effects and to mitigate adverse effects in ways consistent with its policies and management objectives. The agency will encourage compatible adjacent land uses and seek to mitigate potential adverse effects on Park values by actively participating in planning and regulatory processes of neighboring jurisdictions, other federal, state, and local agencies, and Native Americans.\n\nNight Sky\n\nBackground\n\nWithin Death Valley National Park, the night sky toward the southeast is noticeably impacted by lights from Las Vegas, perhaps with some Pahrump, Nevada influence. This is especially apparent while heading south from Grapevine and Stovepipe toward Cow Creek and Furnace Creek. Other light sources are essentially limited to the Furnace Creek and Stovepipe Wells areas of Death Valley National Park, residential lighting from small communities such as Shoshone and Death Valley Junction, vehicles, and minor stationary lighting. Nighttime activities at Briggs Mine and Panamint Valley limestone quarry may be observed from Panamint Valley and portions of Death Valley National Park overlooking Panamint Valley. The Bureau of Land Management has required an approved lighting plan that seeks to minimize night sky pollution from the mine.\n\nPlan Actions\n\nThe National Park Service will cooperate with neighbors and local government agencies to seek to minimize artificial light intrusion, recognizing that darkness and the night sky are part of the overall visitor experience. The National Park Service will strive to set the best example in all developments that involve the use of artificial outdoor lighting, ensuring that it is limited to basic safety requirements and is shielded to the maximum extent possible, to keep light on the intended subject and out of the night sky. Baseline light measurements will be established for night use for monitoring changes over time.\n\nNoise and Overflights\n\nBackground\n\nA high level of traffic is observed along State Highway 127 between Baker, California and Death Valley Junction (Caltrans 1996). Vehicle noise is generally not an issue in the Park in spite of the many and heavily used roads including State Highways 127, 190, and 178, and NPS major paved roads. Because of the Park’s size, most areas are well away from traffic and its noise.\n\nOther areas where localized noise occurs are at the BLM-managed Dumont Dunes off-highway vehicle open area and at mining operations. Less localized is noise from military overflights. Frequent low-level military overflights are often seen in the Panamint and Saline Valleys. If the National Training Center’s (Fort Irwin) expansion is approved, sporadic and significant localized noise would be generated in the southern boundary of Death Valley National Park (BLM 1996).\n\nThe Park is in the vicinity of several U.S. Department of Defense facilities: Fort Irwin Military Reservation, China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station, Edwards Air Force Base, and Nellis Air Force Base. Military aircraft from these facilities often use airspace in the Park. Although aircraft noise does not appear to affect wildlife, visitors to the area often react adversely to jet noise and sonic booms. In addition, some booms have caused damage to natural and cultural resources (NPS 1988).\n\nMilitary overflights constitute the primary source of high-level noise incidents in the Park. Parts of the Park are within a joint service R-2508 special use airspace complex designated as a military operations area (MOA) (Saline, Panamint, and Shoshone MOAs) that permits aircraft to fly at speeds exceeding 250 knots and at altitudes 200 feet above ground level or higher (DOD 1995). The military operations area is used on a daily basis by Navy and Air Force aircraft. Low-level overflights of various military aircraft are common in the vicinity of the Park.\n\nIn 1976, the Joint Policy and Planning Board Commanders (NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake, Edwards Air Force Base, Fort Irwin, and George Air Force Base) agreed to restrict overflights above the existing national monument boundaries to 3,000 feet above ground level within the R-2508 Complex. The successive creation of the Complex Memorandums of Agreement in 1977 excluded this airspace; however, the exclusion was not extended to the expanded areas under the designated areas below the 3,000-foot restriction. A process is in place for all complaints and reports of overflight restriction violations, forwarded by the National Park Service or the public, to be investigated and handled by the Complex management.\n\nTitle VIII of the California Desert Protection Act, 1994, provides that:\n\nNothing in this Act, the Wilderness Act, or other land management laws generally applicable to the new units of the National Park or Wilderness Preservation Systems (or any additions to existing units) designated by this Act, shall restrict or preclude low-level overflights of military aircraft over such units, including military overflights that can be seen or heard within such units.\n\nPlan Actions\n\nThe National Park Service will strive to preserve the natural quiet and sounds associated with the physical and biological resources of the Park. Activities causing excessive or unnecessary sounds in or adjacent to the Park, including low-level aircraft overflights, will be monitored, and action will be taken to prevent or minimize unnatural sounds adversely affecting Park resources and values or visitor enjoyment. The National Park Service will collaborate with the Department of Defense to minimize impacts on visitors and resources from military overflights, as authorized by sec. 802 of the California Desert Protection Act.\n\nWater Resources\n\nBackground\n\nGroundwater. Groundwater is found throughout the Park and varies greatly in depth and quality. The Park’s groundwater basins are recharged from surface and subsurface infiltration. Depletion of groundwater basins and a diminishing of water quality are some of the concerns that were expressed at public meetings. Groundwater is the Park’s principal source for desert springs, seeps, and streams. The maintenance of groundwater quality and quantity is critical to the survival of desert surface waters and their associated plant and animal life.\n\nThe major concern is that Park water and water-related resources will be affected by up-gradient withdrawals and contamination. Death Valley National Park receives much of its water from the lower portion of the Death Valley groundwater flow system’s flow from Nevada (Pal 1995). The Death Valley groundwater flow system is defined in general terms as the area where groundwater flow is toward Death Valley. Some groundwater inflow also occurs from areas in California that are adjacent to the Park. The Death Valley groundwater flow system is believed, by the National Park Service, to be fully, if not over, appropriated. Existing and future appropriations of limited water resources from the flow system may result in impacts to Park water resources. Additionally, potentially contaminated groundwater plumes from the Nevada Test Site or from cyanide runoff from the large mining operation near Bullfrog could contaminate the regional aquifer that drains into the Park (NPS 1988). The Bullfrog Mine is and will continue to conduct groundwater testing until 2005. That company reported that no ground water contamination has been detected (Barrick/Bullfrog Mine, January 14, 1999 letter to NPS regarding the DEIS).\n\nWater Use. Another site where extensive groundwater is being used at rates that exceed normal groundwater recharge is the Briggs Mine adjacent to the Park. The Briggs Mine has an approved mining plan that calls for the groundwater withdrawal of about 640 acre-feet per year (BLM, 1995a). This increase in groundwater withdrawal is in addition to the existing groundwater withdrawal of 750 acre-feet per year from the Panamint Valley (BLM 1995a).\n\nSurface Water. Known surface water sources in the Death Valley region include seeps, wells, springs, and ponds. The small springs and seeps in the Park offer isolated and limited water for plants, wildlife, domestic, or commercial purposes. Some springs produce potable water, but overall, water quality is poor because of high dissolved mineral concentrations (BLM 1996).\n\nIn 1972, some 330 water sources of varying dependability and quality were recorded within the monument’s boundaries (FWS 1972). The majority of these water sources were found in the Cottonwood, Panamint, and Grapevine mountains. Discharges from these sources range from a minimal seep to rates exceeding 200 gallons per minute. Death Valley’s enlargement to a National Park in 1994 added an additional 1.3 million acres. These new lands include additional water sources such as Darwin Creek, Saline Warm Spring, and many springs in the Nelson Range and Whippoorwill Flat areas of the Inyo Mountains.\n\nDeath Valley’s perennial streams include Salt Creek, Furnace Creek, Cottonwood Creek, and Darwin Creek. The Amargosa River is also perennial, but only for short stretches, with its length varying seasonally. Other streams flow seasonally from springs in some of the larger canyons on the west side of Death Valley, such as in Hanaupah and Johnson canyons (NPS 1988).\n\nPerennial ponds are rare within the Park, and they fluctuate in size with the season. The largest ones (more than 6 acres) are immediately north of Saratoga Springs. Several artificial ponds and ditches supplied by the Travertine Springs are maintained by AMFAC, Inc., on its Furnace Creek properties (NPS 1988).\n\nCattle ranching, mining, and resort development in the desert required changes in the natural water flow, quality, and supply. Flows from springs and seeps were diverted or dammed, water was piped miles away from the source, wells were drilled, stock tanks were excavated, and other developments were needed such as wind mills and troughs. These changes brought with them changes to the natural environment. When the flows from the springs and seeps were diverted, the remaining aquatic/riparian flora and fauna were greatly reduced or eliminated. The water piped from the springs and seeps or taken from wells and piped to tanks and troughs is used by cattle, burros, and wildlife.\n\nWater Rights. Initial research on outstanding water rights in the Park at the State Water Resources Control Board in Sacramento revealed that there are approximately 45 appropriated water rights claims on 41 water sources (springs, seeps, streams, wells) in the Park.\n\nThe California Desert Protection Act of 1994 in section 706(a), with respect to each wilderness area, reserves a quantity of water sufficient to fulfill the purposes of the act. Section 706(b) mandates that the Secretary of the Interior and all other officers of the United States take “all steps necessary to protect the rights reserved by this section.” Federal reserved rights generally arise from the purposes for the reservation of land by the federal government. When the government reserves land for a particular purpose, it also reserves, explicitly or by implication, enough unappropriated water at the time of the reservation as is necessary to accomplish the purposes for which Congress or the President authorized the land to be reserved, without regard to the limitations of state law. The vested rights are valid as of the date of the reservation, whether or not the water is actually put to use, and are superior to the rights of those who commence the use of water after the reservation date. General adjudications are the means by which the federal government claims its reserved water rights. The McCarran Amendment (66 Stat. 560, 43 U.S.C. 666, June 10, 1952) provides the mechanism by which the United States, when properly joined, consents to be a defendant in a suit to adjudicate water rights. The precise nature and extent of the National Park Service’s water rights probably will remain uncertain until the United States is joined in an adjudication, the Department of Justice files claims to water rights on behalf of the National Park Service, and the court decrees the United States. Hence, it is the responsibility of both the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management to protect the reserved water rights established under the California Desert Protection Act and other applicable federal authorities.\n\nDeath Valley National Park was involved in a historic water rights decision, when the U. S. Supreme Court in 1976 determined that the NPS had a reserved water right to a certain level of groundwater at Devils Hole. This Supreme Court action is frequently referred to as Cappaert v. United States. The purpose of the reserved water right is to maintain the water level in Devils Hole to assure the survival of the Devils Hole pupfish, an endangered species.\n\nWater Developments. A guzzler is a permanent self-filling water catchment. Most are similar to a cistern and are simple, low-maintenance devices that are essentially tanks filled by rain-collecting aprons (Giles 1971). Guzzlers are installed and used to provide water for hunted species in arid areas. Nongame species such as reptiles, songbirds, and insects also use these manufactured devices. Birds enter the covered tank through an opening and walk down a ramp to the water. For bighorn sheep, piping extends from the storage tank to a drinking trough, which has a float valve to regulate the flow.\n\nDeath Valley National Park has five big game and two game bird (gallinaceous) guzzlers. The guzzlers were developed by the California Department of Fish and Game, the Bureau of Land Management, and volunteers prior to the Park’s expansion in 1994. A review of guzzler use by Park staff concluded that two of the big game guzzlers received little or no use.\n\nPlan Actions\n\nWater Use. Water will be used efficiently and frugally in the Park. The National Park Service will seek to protect, perpetuate, and possibly restore surface water and groundwater as integral components of Park aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Surface water and groundwater withdrawn for the Park’s use will be the amount necessary to achieve Park purposes. All water withdrawn from the Park for domestic use will be returned to the Park watershed system once it has been treated to ensure that there will be no impairment of Park resources. Interbasin transfers would be avoided. If adverse effects were found, the National Park Service will take all legal and appropriate steps necessary to protect natural resources from the effects attributed to such activities. The ongoing water-monitoring program will continue. Death Valley National Park will seek to restore, maintain, or enhance the quality of all surface and ground waters within the Park consistent with the Clean Water Act and other applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations.\n\nThe Park will continue to maintain the water levels at Devils Hole, the home of the endangered Devils Hole pupfish. The Park will continue to actively monitor the pool’s water elevation. The Park will continue to be involved in an interagency effort to monitor the water flow in the Death Valley Groundwater Flow System to help ensure that any major water extraction that might occur miles away from the Park do not adversely affect the Park’s resources. Monitoring other wells and springs within the Park including Darwin Falls and in at least nine water delivery systems will also continue.\n\nFloodplain and Wetland Areas. The occupancy and modification of floodplain and wetland areas will be avoided wherever possible. Where no practicable alternatives exist, mitigating measures will be implemented to minimize potential harm to life, property, and the natural floodplain and wetland values. Management of floodplain and wetland areas is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 11988,”Floodplain Management”, Executive Order 11990,”Protection of Wetlands,”and the Rivers and Harbors Act, and section 404 of the Clean Water Act.\n\nWater Rights. Since 1976 the NPS has been actively protecting the water right to the Devils Hole area. The NPS believes the continuation of this approach is vital to the long term viability and survival of the Devils Hole pupfish and other Park resources.\n\nThe NPS participates in California and Nevada administrative water rights proceedings to protect Federal reserved, riparian, and appropriative rights established for Death Valley National Park. The purpose of this participation is to protect Park water rights from injury by threats such as new appropriations for groundwater located upgradient of Park water sources.\n\nNPS Management Policies (2001) state:\n\nAll rights to the use of water diverted to or used on federal lands within the national park system by the United States or its concessioners, lessors, or permittees will be perfected in the name of the United States.\n\nThe National Park Service in its general planning process for each unit of the national park system and the Bureau of Land Management in its planning process for each wilderness area have jointly agreed to incorporate their respective policies, guidelines, and administrative procedures and apply the following principles to discharge their responsibilities under section 706 of the California Desert Protection Act to manage and protect federal reserved water rights (Desert Managers Group 1995):\n\ninventory all water sources within the boundaries of the wilderness area/park unit\n\nshare water source inventory data\n\njointly request from the California Division of Water Rights notification of any filing for appropriated water rights within or adjacent to the boundaries of BLM wilderness or units of the national park system\n\ndefend federally reserved water rights through the state of California administrative process and, if necessary, seek judicial remedy in the appropriate courts\n\nquantify the amount of water reserved to fulfill the purpose of the reservation as part of any adjudication in California in which the United States may be joined under the McCarran Amendment\n\nwhere necessary, pursue acquisition of any existing nonfederal appropriated water right within their respective jurisdictions\n\nidentify as a federally reserved water right all unappropriated water from any water source identified on federal lands within the boundaries of designated wilderness and/or park areas in the California desert\n\nbecause use of percolating groundwater does not require a permit from the state of California, participate in local government proceedings that authorize nonfederal parties to withdraw percolating groundwater where such withdrawals may impact water sources within their respective jurisdictions to which federally reserved water rights are attached\n\nparticipate in any proceedings pursuant to Nevada state water law that may authorize withdrawal of groundwater where such withdrawal may impact water sources within their jurisdictions to which federally reserved or appropriated water rights are attached\n\nvigorously defend water travelling to the Park in the Death Valley aquifer from Nevada\n\nwork with holders of water rights to restore modified water sources to natural conditions while still allowing for valid existing uses\n\nWater Developments. The National Park Service will examine the use of and need for all guzzlers, livestock tanks, and troughs (hereafter referred to as developed water sites). Water at developed water sites will be retained for native plants and wildlife if these facilities were needed to mitigate for local water losses due to previous human activities. Simultaneously, with the retention of these developed water sites, the National Park Service will actively begin to restore natural water sources to be self-sustaining. When a water source became selfsustaining, the artificial facility will be removed. Requests to use motorized access to guzzlers in wilderness areas (to maintain guzzlers or replenish water) will be reviewed individually. If livestock use, including water use, degrades wilderness values, the number of livestock would be reduced to the appropriate level.\n\nWater is necessary for livestock grazing on NPS lands. The amount of water that will be diverted or used for livestock will be maintained for the animals’ health. If and when animal unit months (AUMs) were reduced (no increase in AUMs is allowed under the California Desert Protection Act) a concurrent reduction in water for livestock purposes will be expected. The National Park Service will examine these developed water facilities and take action, where appropriate, to restore natural waters. If the National Park Service did not own the water rights, the agency will work with the owners to encourage them to consider the benefits of natural water restoration to restore modified water sources to natural conditions while still allowing for valid existing uses.\n\nPaleontological Resources\n\nBackground\n\nDeath Valley National Park contains a rich and diverse, but fragile and irreplaceable paleontological record. The fossil record in the Park area is nearly as extensive and complicated as the geological record. Much of the area’s geology is exceptionally well exposed. Soil development has been greatly retarded throughout much of the area, and the outstanding exposures of geological features support an equally notable exposure of fossil remains. These organisms have value as (1) stratigraphic indicators for correlation of deposits containing them and for determination of relative geologic age (2) records of past life forms showing the course of evolutionary trends of plants and animals and (3) evidence of changing paleoenvironments.\n\nA literature and records search was completed for the Death Valley National Park region by Earth Sciences curator, Robert E. Reynolds, at San Bernardino County Museum in Redlands. The records and literature search identified a number of potentially sensitive fossiliferous areas within the Park area. Significant paleontological resources and records relating to paleobiostratigraphic events that occur within the Park include:\n\nThe world’s oldest mitosing cells, 990 million years old, are preserved in silica in the Beck Spring Formation.\n\nSignificant Cambrian trilobite and invertebrate fossil localities that mark the boundary of the Paleozoic Era, 550 million years of age.\n\nSignificant occurrences of Paleozoic invertebrate fossils and the possibility of very old fossil fish in Death Valley National Park.\n\nPanamint Range localities that contain significant marine cephalopods and invertebrate fossils.\n\nThe early record of the Oligocene Tertiary Era from north of the Mojave Desert is found in the Grapevine Mountains in Death Valley National Park; important fossils include rodent, canid, horse, helaletid, brontothere, rhinoceros, oredont, and leptomerycids.\n\nExtremely important Late Miocene trackways, associated with important vertebrate fossils, occur in the Black Mountains in Death Valley National Park and in the Avawatz Mountains south of the Park; the Black Mountains area includes a wide range of camel, horse, gompothere, and aquatic bird trackways associated with a shallow freshwater lakeshore.\n\nPlan Actions\n\nSome paleontological research has been initiated or funded by the National Park Service. Most is accomplished by outside institutions that request and receive NPS research permits. The institutions, in exchange for the opportunity to study NPSresources, agree to provide information that the National Park Service can use to develop strategies for resource protection, management, and interpretation.\n\nPaleontological resources, including both organic and mineralized remains in body or trace form, will be protected and preserved for public enjoyment, interpretation, and scientific research in accordance with Park management objectives and approved resource management plans. Although paleontological research by the academic community will be encouraged and facilitated under research permits subject to NPS management criteria, the National Park Service will enhance its own knowledge of paleontological resources through comprehensive inventory and monitoring programs. To enhance the conservation and management of paleontological resources, the National Park Service will seek to develop collaborative partnerships with government agencies, academic institutions, and public and private organizations with paleontological resource management or research capabilities/expertise. Management actions will be taken to prevent illegal collecting. Actions also might be taken to prevent damage from natural processes such as erosion. Protection could include construction of shelters over specimens for interpretation in situ, stabilization in the field, or collecting, preparing, and placing of specimens in museum collections. The localities and geologic settings of specimens will be adequately documented when specimens were collected.\n\nGeological Resources\n\nBackground\n\nDeath Valley National Park is, geologically speaking, a part of the larger Basin and Range Province. The Park’s oldest rocks were formed about 1.8 billion years ago. The weathered sandstone and limestone rocks from the Funeral and Panamint Mountains are much younger, about 500 million years old, and indicate that this area was the site of a warm, shallow sea throughout most of the Paleozoic Era (570–250 million years ago).\n\nAbout 3 million years ago, the dynamics of crustal movement changed, and Death Valley proper began to form. At this time, compressional forces were replaced by extensional forces. This “pulling apart” of the earth’s crust allowed large blocks of land to slowly slide past one another along faults, forming alternating valleys and mountain ranges. Badwater Basin, the Death Valley salt pan, and the Panamint Mountain Range comprise one block that is rotating eastward as a structural unit. The valley floor has been steadily slipping downward, subsiding along the fault that lies at the base of the Black Mountains. Down-dropping continues today.\n\nConcurrent with the subsidence has been slow but continuous erosion. Water carries rocks, sand, and gravel down from surrounding hills and deposits the pieces on the valley floor. Beneath Badwater lies over 9,000 feet of accumulated sediments and salts.\n\nRecent signs of volcanic activity exist in the northern third of the Park at Ubehebe Crater. Caused by violent steam explosions, the craters formed several thousand years ago when molten material came in contact with groundwater.\n\nThere are five dune areas within the Park. They are located near Saratoga Springs, Stovepipe Wells, Panamint Springs, Saline Valley, and Eureka Valley.”[The Eureka Valley Dunes are] the highest dunes in the Basin and Range Province and possibly in the United States. When observed at sunset from the west, against the backdrop of the Last Chance Range, its nearly vertical west facing slopes resemble a marvelous parfait-like melange of pink, white and numerous other tones of earth colored rocks”(BLM 1982).\n\nPlan Actions\n\nPark geological features will be protected. Certain fragile geological features, such as sand dunes and salt flats will be monitored to determine if measures were needed to prevent or stop human-caused damage. Mapping by U.S. Geological Survey will be conducted to map Death Valley National Park’s renowned exposed geology. Resource protection will continue to consist of random patrols of the backcountry as well as limited public closures to protect sensitive sites.\n\nCave Resources\n\nBackground\n\nCaves, as defined by the Federal Cave Resources Protection Act, include any natural feature that a person can enter. They include talus caves, erosional caves, dissolution caves, lava tubes, and others. They do not include mine adits, shafts, or declines. Caves are not common in Death Valley. The most significant cave is Devils Hole.\n\nPlan Actions\n\nNPS Management Policies (2001) provide that caves be managed to perpetuate their atmospheric, geological, biological, ecological, and cultural resources in accordance with approved cave management plans. Natural drainage patterns, air flows, and plant and animal communities are to be protected. In general, the NPSmanagement direction is to avoid development of caves and to perpetuate natural conditions, while seeking to protect the resource. Devils Hole is closed to public use to protect the endangered pupfish.\n\nBIOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT\n\nBackground\n\nDeath Valley National Park and the adjacent desert support a variety of wildlife species. Within Death Valley and the surrounding desert there are 51 species of native mammals, two species of exotic mammals, over 346 species of birds, 36 species of reptiles, three species of amphibians, and six species of fishes (Hansen 1972 and 1973; Landye 1973). Small mammals are more numerous than large mammals, such as desert bighorn, bobcat, mountain lion and mule deer.\n\nThe Nelson bighorn (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) is the subspecies native to Death Valley. Bighorn occur in desert mountain ranges where the terrain includes rolling hills for feeding areas and nearby cliffs within steep canyons that can be used for escape. Their range does not correlate with any specific vegetative type. The present population is estimated to be between 500 and 1000 animals. Some researchers believe that the sheep population in the Park is declining in numbers. The cause of this possible decline has not been determined; however, several factors may be involved, including the introduction of diseases from livestock, poor range conditions, rapid increase in human activities (such as mining, road building, urbanization, and increased recreation), illegal hunting, and appropriation of water (Seymour 1972). Competition with other animals and drying of springs are additional factors resulting in loss of habitat. Alternatively, it may be possible that the Park herd is not declining, and the use of different census methods that have varying degrees of accuracy are responsible for”fluctuating”numbers of sheep. To reduce visitor impacts and prevent undue disturbance of wildlife, backcountry camping is not permitted within .25 mile of springs.\n\nThe diversity of Death Valley National Park’s plant communities result partly from the region’s location in the Mojave Desert, a zone of tension and overlap between the Great Basin Desert to the north and the Sonoran Desert to the south (Kearney and Peebles 1960). This location, combined with the great relief found within the Park — from 282 feet below sea level to 11,049 feet above sea level — supports vegetation typical of four biotic life zones: the lower Sonoran, the Canadian, and even the Arctic/Alpine in portions of the Panamint Range (Jepson 1923; Storer and Usinger 1968). Based on Munz and Keck (1968) classifications, seven plant communities can be categorized within these life zones, each characterized by dominant vegetation and representative of three vegetation types: scrub, desert woodland, and coniferous forest. Microhabitats further subdivide some communities into zones, especially on the valley floor.\n\nScrub or Desert. Scrub is the most extensive vegetation type in Death Valley. It dominates about three-fourths of the Park landscape and includes the alkali sink, creosote bush scrub, shadscale scrub, and sagebrush scrub communities. The alkali sink or salt flat community occurs in the lower elevations of the Park.\n\nDesert Woodland. Desert woodland is an open, well-spaced community ranging from elevations of about 7,000 feet up to about 9,500 feet. Much of the soil within this community is bare and surfaced with a hard, wind scoured layer similar to desert pavement. The community is dominated by singleleaf pinyon pine (Pinus monophylla) and scattered individuals of juniper (Juniperus osteosperma).\n\nConiferous Forest. Coniferous forest in Death Valley National Park includes subalpine forest and some bristlecone pine forests. Both communities occur in narrow belts at upper elevations. Dominants of subalpine forest, including limber pine (Pinus flexilis), occur in mosaic concentrations rather than uniformly throughout the area. The bristlecone pine forest community occurs chiefly above 10,000 feet in the Panamint Range, where spacing of individual bristlecones (Pinus aristata) and limber pine (Pinus flexilis) appear more as an open woodland rather than a forest.\n\nSPECIES AND HABITATS OF SPECIAL CONSIDERATION\n\nWithin Death Valley National Park there are confirmed populations or habitats for 21 state or federally recognized species of concern.\n\nFederally listed species in Death Valley include: desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), Devils Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis), southwestern willow flycatcher (Empidonax trailli extimus), least Bell’s vireo (Vireo bellii pusillus), Eureka Dunes evening primrose (Oenothera californica ssp. eurekensis), Eureka Valley dunegrass (Swallenia alexandrae), and spring-loving centaury (Centaurium namophilum).\n\nFederally listed species for which final recovery plans exist are desert tortoise, Devils Hole pupfish, Eureka Dunes evening primrose, and Eureka Valley dunegrass. A draft recovery plan is in development for the least Bell’s vireo.\n\nCalifornia listed species, other than those also federally listed or proposed, are California (or western) yellow billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus occidentalis), willow flycatcher (Empidonax trailli), Cottonball Marsh pupfish (Cyprinodon salinus milleri), and Mohave ground squirrel (Spermophilus mohavensis).\n\nCalifornia rare plant species, not otherwise federally listed or proposed, are July gold (Dedeckera eurekensis) and rock lady (Maurandya petrophila).\n\nDesert Tortoise\n\nThe range of the desert tortoise includes the Mojave and Sonoran deserts in southern California, Arizona, southern Nevada, the southwestern tip of Utah, and Sonora and northern Sinaloa, Mexico. The Mojave population of the desert tortoise (an administrative designation for animals living north and west of the Colorado River) is listed as a threatened species by the Federal government and the state of California. Critical habitat for this species was designated in 1994 (FWS 1994). There is no desert tortoise designated critical habitat within Death Valley National Park. The desert tortoise’s range within Death Valley National Park extends to its southern half. Within the Park the current populations (and for at least the last 60 years) are not believed to be very numerous.\n\nThe Mojave population of the desert tortoise occurs primarily in valleys and on bajadas characterized by scattered shrubs. The soils range from sand to sandy-gravel, though caliche soils, desert pavement, and rocky, boulder terrain are occasionally used. Desert tortoises spend a large portion of the year underground to avoid extreme temperatures and, for younger tortoises, to avoid a variety of predators, such as coyotes, foxes, raptors, and ravens (BLM 1996). Tortoises are active during the spring, early summer, and autumn when annual plants are most common and daily temperatures are tolerable. Additional activity occasionally occurs during warm weather in winter months and after summer rainstorms (BLM 1996).\n\nSpecies Addressed in the Ash Meadows Recovery Plan\n\nDevils Hole is a small tract of land administered by Death Valley National Park while part of a larger spring complex in Nevada called Ash Meadows. Devils Hole falls within the boundaries of Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge. A limestone cave at Devils Hole, bearing the same name, is the only natural habitat of the Devils Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis), listed as endangered by the federal government and state of Nevada. The underground aquifer determines the cave’s water level, which has no surface outlet. Historic and ongoing mining of groundwater in Ash Meadows has occasionally directly lowered the water level in Devils Hole, occasionally exposing a shallow limestone shelf on which the pupfish depend for food and spawning (Soltz and Naiman 1978; E.P. Pister, pers. comm., 1997).\n\nDecline of the Devils Hole pupfish drove litigation resulting in a U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding the maintenance of a minimum water level at the cave. From 1980 to at least 1990, the population status was upward but”persistently small and localized.”The species is considered not delistable; criteria for its protection are the maintenance of water levels and water chemistry. Other species of special consideration located at the limestone cave or at springs within the 40 acres are: Devils Hole warm springs riffle beetle, Amargosa tryonia snail (Tryonia variegata), (FWS 1990). Water levels are currently monitored by the National Park Service. The combined records from water level monitoring by the National Park Service and the U.S. Geological Survey dating from the 1960s demonstrated a maximum level of recovery in 1989; thereafter, a downward trend has persisted.\n\nThe 1990 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Recovery Plan for listed species of Ash Meadows embraced goals of the 1980 recovery plan for the Devils Hole pupfish and addressed the following federally listed species located at Ash Meadows, Nevada, and on National Park Service or BLM-managed areas within adjacent lands in California:\n\nspring-loving centaury (Centaurium namophilum namophilum) — FT, NVCE\n\nAsh Meadows sunray (Enceliopsis nudicaulis var.corrugata) — FT, NVCE\n\nAsh Meadows gumplant (Grindelia fraxino-pratensis) — FT, NV Watch List.\n\nAlso noted were Ash Meadows endemics.\n\nEssential habitat for the Devils Hole pupfish includes 21,760 acres encompassing the area where groundwater removal most influences the water level in Devils Hole.\n\nAmargosa pupfish and speckled dace, Amargosa niterwort, spring loving centaury, Ash Meadows sunray, Ash Meadows gumplant, alkali mariposa lily, Tecopa bird’s beak, and white bear poppy range into California at locations along the Amargosa drainage and at various sites supporting stream, spring, salt marsh, moist alkaline soil, calcareous, or riparian habitats.\n\nRiparian-Dependent Bird Species\n\nsouthwestern willow flycatcher (Empidonax trailli extimus) — FE, sp. level CAE\n\nleast Bell’s vireo (Vireo bellii pusillus) — FE\n\nCalifornia/western yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus occidentalis) — CAE\n\nSmall numbers of all three species have been confirmed along the Amargosa River and in Death Valley.\n\nFederal recovery planning is underway for both the vireo and flycatcher. There is no critical habitat located within Death Valley National Park for either subspecies.\n\nThe western yellow-billed cuckoo, state endangered since 1988, generally requires a broader stand of riparian growth than the vireo or flycatcher, although loss of riparian habitat is the major common factor influencing the decline of all.\n\nThe cuckoo does not appear to be affected by brood parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) which is a severe problem for the vireo and flycatcher. In this behavior, cowbirds introduce their offspring to the nest and care of a host bird species, competing directly with the success of the host’s young and sometimes eating or ejecting the host’s eggs. (Thelander 1994). If a cowbird problem is identified, Death Valley would work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to develop a solution to cowbird nest parasitism.\n\nSpecies Addressed in the Eureka Valley Dunes Recovery Plan\n\nEureka Valley evening primrose (Oenothera californica ssp. eurekensis) — FE\n\nEureka Valley dunegrass (Swallenia alexandrae) — FE\n\nShining milk-vetch (Astragalus lentiginosus var. micans) (note: has been removed from FPT list)\n\nSodaville milk-vetch (Astragalus lentiginosus sesquimetralis) — CAE, NVCE, (note: has been removed from FPT list)\n\nPrior to the administrative transfer to the National Park Service in 1994, the Bureau of Land Management established the Eureka Valley area of critical environmental concern and in 1982, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service adopted the Eureka Valley Dunes Recovery Plan. Stemming from these, by draft agreement, a voluntary joint conservation strategy is being developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Death Valley National Park to protect sites where there are two federally listed and two sensitive plants. The agreement targets actions over entire dune ecosystems to benefit these plants and other species of special consideration including endemic beetles. Two federally endangered species, Eureka Valley evening primrose (Oenothera californica ssp. eurekensis) and Eureka Valley dunegrass (Swallenia alexandrae), and a sensitive species, shining milk-vetch (Astragalus lentiginosus var. micans), are only found on dunes within Death Valley National Park. Additionally, the California population of another sensitive species, Sodaville milk-vetch (Astragalus lentiginosus sesquimetralis), is located at the Park (Diane Steeck, pers. comm., 1997).\n\nThe largest population of Eureka Valley dunegrass is found on high, unstable areas of Eureka Dunes, with remaining known stands located in smaller dunes on the west side of Eureka Valley. The major occurrence of Eureka Valley evening-primrose is at Eureka Dunes, but this species is also known from two smaller sites on the west side of Eureka Valley, growing on lower slopes and dune flats. Eureka Dunes and one site on the western Eureka Valley comprise the known range of shining milk-vetch, which grows on midand lower-dune slopes and some sandy flats. Sodaville milk-vetch has been found at Death Valley National Park and at two sites in Nevada; it relies on margins of alkaline wetlands, near cool springs (Diane Steeck, pers. comm., 1997).\n\nNotable recolonization of shining milk-vetch has occurred in areas where motorized vehicle use is no longer authorized, but concerns remain with occasional motorcycle and other vehicle trespass, vandalism to barriers and signs and other human uses, including sandboarding/skiing and horseback riding. Possible encroachment and competition with the midand lower-dune endemics by the nonnative Russian thistle (Salsola sp.) is another concern. It is believed that the most persistent threat to the Sodaville milkvetch population at Big Sand Spring has been habitat trampling and modification by burros and cattle (Diane Steeck, pers. comm., 1997). This area has been fenced by the Park to protect the plants.\n\nOther Death Valley National Park Rare Plants\n\nJuly gold "
