I'll share a bit of my experience here:\n\nI originally went to Club Champion because they have access to more exotic shaft options on hand, in particular for my driver. After doing my research, I narrowed down what I wanted to two different shafts. At my fitting, I was able to swing both of those, and they just weren't getting the results I wanted. Adam had me try a couple other options that I hadn't considered, and I was astounded by the results. Within 20 minutes, Adam had me dialed in to a new shaft that increased my ball speed, reduced spin, and increased the total distance of my driver by 23 yards. INCREDIBLE!\n\nAfter getting fit for the driver, we went through the rest of the bag; hybrid, irons, wedges, and putter. Adam had a no-pressure sales style, even at one time saying that I'd be a fool to replace the wedges I'm currently hitting, since the data showed he couldn't fit me into anything better. He didn't have any bias towards certain brands. He just wanted whatever works best for my swing. I appreciate that he's all about data and results, and not just trying to sell me as much as possible.\n\nFast forward to this summer: I've had by far the best season of golf of my life, mostly because of my increased accuracy and length off the tee with my new driver and hybrid. Par 5s have started to surrender eagles and birdies more frequently, and I have much shorter approaches coming into the greens than I ever have. I was already a golf junkie beforehand, but my enjoyment for the game has been elevated to a whole new level this year.\n\nIf you're serious about improving your game, don't spare the expense. There is so much more that goes into selecting a club than just picking a regular/stiff flex shaft. Unlike some of the other places you can go, these guys know what they're doing and are going to get you exactly what you need.\" — Jonny J. | Edina, MN\n\n\"Really pleased with my Club Champion fitting. Wasn't quite sure what to expect, my prior fittings (if you want to call it that) in a golf shop bay were based on a handful of demo clubs they had available to test. Stock items only, no selection or ability to try different shafts, etc.\n\nNow Club Champion is a whole different story. Racks and racks of shafts and clubheads...which actually was a bit daunting at first. Then met with Rich, a Master Fitter & Club Builder. He put me through the paces with my own clubs to establish a baseline and actually \"watch\" my swing. Then the tweaking began with different clubheads from different manufacturers and shaft combinations, with him picking up the nuances of my swing and finding the best combos. He could tell when I had a great shot as soon the ball left the clubhead, while we waited for the TrackMan to catch up and confirm just how great it was. I was impressed. I'm 69 years old, my mobility is not what it used to be, and I've been losing distance at a frustrating rate. BUT, I have to tell you after we were done, I was hitting the irons 20-30 yards further (with a slight draw, no less) than when I walked in the door. Amazing! Then on to the driver. We tried a few combos and came to the conclusion that I was hitting my existing driver pretty good as is. That in itself sold me on Rich as a club fitter and Club Champion as a company. Rich took the time, answered all my questions and had answers that I didn't even know the questions to ask. No pressure.\" — BG | Del Mar, CA"
