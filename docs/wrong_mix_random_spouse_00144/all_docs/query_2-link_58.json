        "text": "Are you a hustler or tend to like things handed to you? Do you have time to commit to building a business? Finally, are you open-minded enough to try new things and experiment?\n\nIf yes to all, join Tacklebox. You will learn how to build a business period. I’ve started businesses before, helped other startups get funding and grow, and ran product teams for many years for several companies and I still found ton of value with Tacklebox.\n\nTacklebox forces you to ask questions and consider some things up front that many founders naturally put off until late in their startup journey. Most people go too quickly from their idea toward trying to build the product related to their idea. Tacklebox ensures that you ask the right questions to make sure you are heading down the right path with regards to your idea, like:\n\n- Are you actually solving the problem you are trying to address?\n\n- Is it a problem that is inconvenient enough to need solving?\n\n- What does the day-to-day look like for your ideal customer and what role do you hope to play in their lives?\n\nMany people chase their ideas because they know that there is a gap in the market, but by avoiding some of these questions up front, a lot of people end up heading in the wrong direction.\n\nBrian understands how to distill big ideas into actionable products — he’s got a 6th sense for understanding what people want. Any early stage startup that works with him will be miles ahead of where they would be working on their idea alone. Every interaction (consultation?) I’ve had with Brian has left me with actionable insights that helped me take my product from the ideation stage to the market and acquiring users.\n\nBrian’s advice and guidance allowed me to bring my product to market while avoiding unforeseen obstacles and acquire users much faster than I could have done alone. Tacklebox saved me tons of time and tons of money. Probably thousands of dollars building a more refined prototype. I’m really grateful for how that turned out, and for the next idea I have a set path for how to going about building a product from prototype to finish…\n\nWow. That one word effectively summarizes our experience with Brian at Tacklebox.\n\nWe came into the program having just pivoted our business, feeling really hopeful but pretty overwhelmed about how to start validating this new direction. Brian was a tremendous help, and served as our guide throughout the entire journey.\n\nFrom the very first class, Brian had a very structured agenda and game plan - and he kept everybody accountable. The program is fast-paced, which means you learn a ton, and you do it in a community of awesome fellow entrepreneurs.\n\nWe can’t say enough good things about Brian. He is an incredible thought partner - always the first person we come to for advice - and we feel really lucky to have been part of the program. These were some of the achievements we accomplished during our time at Tacklebox:\n\n:\n\n1) Narrowing in on our ideal first customer, and building an initial target audience out of it; thanks to our extreme focus, we now knew the <20 companies we should be getting in touch with\n\n2) Clarifying our value proposition and really understanding what pain point we were solving, all through extensive user interviews\n\n3) Understanding our key assumptions, and how best we could validate them over time\n\n4) Successfully finding pilot partners to launch our product\n\nNow that the program is over, we look back at all we accomplished during that month and want to do it again. If Brian had a post-program available, you can bet that we would be signed up for it! If you want to gain focus in your startup, narrow in on your ideal customer, build a product that people really want, and make astounding progress, we highly recommend you apply for Tacklebox today.\n\nI know I am going to start my own business, I just truly wasn’t sure where/how to start. Lectures, articles, and advice, can only lead you so far. Additionally, between working full-time and getting my MBA at night, I felt that I didn’t have the time to do the legwork that would be necessary to start a business. Tacklebox provided a framework that offered inspiration, motivation, advice, roadmaps, milestones, process, and most importantly structure to walk me through the crucial steps of taking an idea in my mind to creating a MVP. I truly think that I have learned more in this three week span than I have in eight years of undergraduate and graduate schooling.\n\nTacklebox gave a real hands-on approach to starting a business that has given me invaluable insight and confidence to start my own business. The setup of the session led itself to an incredible classroom experience where everyone could collaborate together and feed off of each other’s ideas, inspiration, and excitement. Every session, we walked away with notes upon notes of tips and advice to further hone our idea.\n\nAnyone that is at the point of being ready to start a business owes it to themselves to go through Tacklebox Accelerator. Worst case you’ll walk away 10x smarter in the startup world and what it takes to start a business. Best case you have established not only an incredible roadmap, but also an amazing network to start your business. I’d highly recommend Tacklebox Accelerator. Brian’s experience as a founder, consultant, and VC provides unique perspective no matter the situation or discussion. Brian has a great deck lined up that is both refreshing and captivating. You won’t regret applying for Tacklebox Accelerator.\n\nThree months into building out our startup, day100, my partner and I had put together an MVP, had some interested pilot customers and were doing our best to get things moving. Our next step was to get some experienced advice and guidance on how we can move from pilot to paying customers to investors. We initially heard about Tacklebox from an accelerator newsletter called F6S and liked how it was focused on helping founders who were exactly at the stage we were at. At the same time, we didn’t know much about it or knew who the founder Brian Scordato was. Quite fortunately, we met Brian the very next week at an event where we were pitching our startup. Brian’s feedback was focused, critical and helped us understand immediately how we could better shape our pitch. We wanted more.\n\nOne month later, day100 is in a much better place with a narrowly defined target customer segment, a well-honed pitch, a vetted business plan and 6-month roadmap. We couldn’t have gotten here as fast and in such high quality without Brian and his awesome network of guest speakers. Every one of the sessions was incredibly valuable, from the group work, to the 1 on 1 sessions with Brian, to having the chance to pitch actual investors.\n\nOne of the best things about Tacklebox is that Brian understands that early stage startups live at a speed of their own - they don’t have time to go through a 3-month application process for a 6-month accelerator program just to get the kind of advice and guidance they need.\n\nWe highly recommend Tacklebox to those who are in the early stage of conceptualizing or building a startup - Brian knows how to get you best set up with the basics so that you can succeed.\n\nIn just 30 days of participating in Brian Scordato's Tacklebox Accelerator, I was able to take my app idea to full-scale MVP, while learning vital basics about targeting the ideal customer, evaluating competition, determining minimum features and more. Within one week, we launched splash pages, conducted in-depth market research, and delivered our first pitch. Throughout the class, we met with Brian one-on-one to hone our products, and worked closely with other members of the class to gain additional perspective. We pitched our products to several well-connected investors and influencers and received valuable feedback from some of the most important players in the startup movement.\n\nBrian's class was a delight; chock full of both humor and the most cutting-edge tools and techniques to design a successful product. The best part about the accelerator was benefiting from Brian's product intuition and industry knowledge. Brian was honest and realistic about success, and provided guidance based on my business goals, while pushing me to think bigger. Brian's personal business experience and formal B-school training helped guide me to the next phase, which includes a six-month implementation plan and professional pitch deck. If you have a promising idea for an app and need a modern and fast approach for taking it to the next level, I strongly recommend participating in the Tacklebox Accelerator.\n\nAfter graduating from the program, I confirmed for myself that one very specific - yet a huge problem - that remains unsolved today. The problem is the following: stakeholders and third-party constituencies do not care whether or not your startup will succeed. They do care only about ripping the benefits off from you if succeeding. In my point of view, this is the root cause of why so many startups fail nowadays.\n\nHowever, while being a part of the Tacklebox accelerator, I was finally proved wrong by Brian.\n\nI was proved that by having a really noble and respectful attitude towards a first-time entrepreneur is the fundamental of support! If every single \"mentor\" in every single startup accelerator had 1/10th of Brian's personal approach and dedication, I bet that way too many startups could have still existed.\n\nI would describe Tacklebox as trustworthy, credible, and personalized. I'd also recommend any friend with a business idea to apply Tacklebox!\n\nWhen I went into Tacklebox, I started with a series of grandiose yet vague and unvalidated ideas, all of which seemed almost impossible to achieve given that I was working on my project nights and weekends. I had too many things that I wanted to do, too many things I wanted to expand my project with.\n\nBrian and Tacklebox helped me distill all the swirling thoughts, concerns and concepts in my head into validated insights, and helped focus them into something that I could take action on immediately. The natural inclination when building a brand or a business is to think farther ahead - but I learned that this can actually be harmful without actual customer validation, and when your idea expands so much that it becomes a nebulous mass of decisions that you can't navigate.\n\nOn top of that, Tacklebox has been an amazing resource to not just develop the business, but also to actually feel like your business is something real. When you're a founder, and you're working alone (especially when it's not your main gig), it's difficult not to feel like this is only a \"side-hustle\" or a hobby. By joining Tacklebox, going through the workshops, and testing your ideas with rigor, research and a framework, practice-pitching to real investors, getting feedback, etc. the internal change that happens is that it makes you yourself take it more seriously.\n\nI came in with a \"project\" and I came out feeling more confident that I was building a business.\n\nTacklebox gave me a process for validating my idea further; it helped provide a framework and organization around a path of inquiry that allowed me to hone in on the weakest part of my concept and test how I would solve it. It also served as a crash course in outreach/messaging and helped me verify that my concept has the potential to have legs. I ultimately moved much faster because of Tacklebox and I learned a significant amount. With my move to Austin coming at the end of the summer, this was the perfect time to jump into the program.\n\nMy 2019 new years resolution was to pursue one of my ideas. I was introduced to the idea to startup podcast where I learned about Tacklebox, the startup accelerator for founders with full time jobs. It sounded like the perfect opportunity to validate my idea and determine whether or not to take the idea forward. It was a perfect fit for where I am in my life and career.\n\nTacklebox provided the tools and framework to validate my startup idea and determine whether it could become a viable business. Invaluable. I would considerate almost negligent to not run your business idea through the wringer of Tacklebox before considering launching a business.\n\nA great mentor and a terrific community. We went into TA feeling alone, isolated and a little uncertain with a new idea, and came out feeling emboldened, positive and excited to bring it to life. Each week we moved a little farther forward, and the combination of coursework, MIT prep, one-on-ones and external resources helped us get a sense of momentum.\n\nIf you have an idea you've been mulling, or a concept for a new project, and you want to get it out of your head and into the world, this is a great first step. You'll still have to do the work! But this will help you do the work in a structured way, so that each step moves you a little bit further forward. And it gives you the chance to take the steps in the company of someone who's taken them a few times before - So he can help warn you of some pitfalls, and explain some of the confusing new scenery along the way.\n\nIt really is just like it says on the box - Brian is a really nice guy, and this is a great way to move from idea to MVP without quitting your day job. If you have a new idea, and you want a bit more confirmation about it before you take the plunge and go to work on it full time, do a Tacklebox Accelerator. It is such a worthwhile investment. You will learn so much, your product will be better for it, and your future self will thank you.\n\nTacklebox helped me narrow my target market by helping me better define and validate customer segments. Tacklebox also helped me think through problems creatively and I really appreciate that as a solo founder -- I was getting lost in a rabbit hole starting this biz out of my apartment and finding it hard to see the full picture once I was all in.\n\nThere were a few factors in my decision to choose Tacklebox:\n\n1. Looking for a community of people also going through the process of starting a business that could relate to what I was going through - i.e. \"can I do this?\", \"i have no idea what's going on\", \"this is SO HARD\" \"family and friends are not the best support systems\", etc\n\n2. TB curriculum (for lack of better word) paired up nicely where I was with my biz - I was all in and needed to test what would resonate most with my customers and also start building a sales cycle. *side note here* I really felt that TB was one of the more effective course style programs I've participated in due to where I was with my business when starting Tacklebox -- which was at the point of no return.\n\nAbove all, Tacklebox was a forcing function to figure out our initial audience and direction to start. Tacklebox provided an entrepreneurship trial - just enough to get a sense of what the life of an entrepreneur is like to help make the decision to leap (or not).\n\nI went in with no expectations and was honestly blown away at how helpful it was. I never went to B school but I imagine that the foundational training I got in Tacklebox is similar to what I would get from B school classes.\n\nIt gave me refined focus. I was heading in to general of a direction and now I have a more refined product offering since I have a much stronger understanding of the customer segment I need to target.\n\nI speak about Tacklebox all the time. I specifically said that I am so glad that I was chosen and that I could actually participate. I explained that so many solo founders would benefit from such a program because it would help them avoid the mistakes and pitfalls so many newbies make.\n\nI loved Tacklebox because it gave us a boost in working on our venture, the content was great, the atmosphere and environment created in the sessions was great and positive - it was really nice to get feedback and have everyone thinking on each other’s problems. The feedback we got from Brian was always eye opening and on-point. We got exposure to high profiled people in the industry which is a network we would be able to utilize in the future. It gave us a push to do things we might otherwise would have put off.\n\nOne of the great things about tacklebox is it’s a bit more tangible. “I’m working on a concept with some friends” isn’t as strong as “I’m in a startup incubator” which makes me a little more open to talking about it but I also think it made everyone feel like it was much more real than before.\n\nAs a team, I think we were looking for guidance and validation. Personally, I was looking for help in getting the team more focused and picking up the pace. Tacklebox allowed us to focus in on the real issue we’re trying to solve and the important steps needed to get there\n\nMy expectations of Tacklebox prior to session was that we were going to be doing a lot of learning of core fundamentals of building a business and truly understanding our client segmentation piece.\n\nThe program blew them away. Not only did we learn, we applied these concepts into real life actionable items and tested each one of them. To say Tacklebox superseded my expectations is an understatement. From the initial process of just having like minded individuals in a room together, to actually providing really great value, teaching lessens, investor pitches and more truly was a remarkable experience. I also think a great point for me was that I thought Tacklebox would be 75-80% learning about ways to attack different markets and learn the tricks of building a business. I was wrong. It was about 10-15% learning & majority of applying these learning lessens to test actual results.\n\nWow. That one word effectively summarizes our experience with Brian at Tacklebox.\n\nWe came into the program having just pivoted our business, feeling really hopeful but pretty overwhelmed about how to start validating this new direction. Brian was a tremendous help, and served as our guide throughout the entire journey.\n\nFrom the very first class, Brian had a very structured agenda and game plan - and he kept everybody accountable. If you want to accomplish a lot in a few weeks, then trust us - you will. The program is fast-paced, which means you learn a ton, and you do it in a community of awesome fellow entrepreneurs.\n\nWe can’t say enough good things about Brian. He is an incredible thought partner - always the first person we come to for advice - and we feel really lucky to have been part of the program. These were some of the achievements we accomplished during our time at Tacklebox\n\n1) narrowing in on our ideal first customer, and building an initial target audience out of it; thanks to our extreme focus, we now knew the <20 companies we should be getting in touch with\n\n2) clarifying our value proposition and really understanding what pain point we were solving, all through extensive user interviews\n\n3) understanding our key assumptions, and how best we could validate them over time\n\n4) successfully finding pilot partners to launch our product\n\nNow that the program is over, we look back at all we accomplished during that month and want to do it again.\n\nIf Brian had a post-program available, you can bet that we would be signed up for it! If you want to gain focus in your startup, narrow in on your ideal customer, build a product that people really want, and make astounding progress over the span of four weeks, we highly recommend you apply for Tacklebox today.\n\nIn 6 weeks I was going to figure out if Habit House was an idea worth pursuing. If there was an opportunity here. The program 10000% exceeded expectations.\n\nBefore Tacklebox I had domain expertise in the health and wellness space, a vague idea for a digital media brand I thought should exist and 4 week habits module I wanted to tie into that. I had done some competitive research. I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to build, but knew people had a problem and were looking to solve it.\n\nAfter just six weeks I am SO close to making money and can actually see quitting my day job as something realistic. I have a base product and am piloting it with 10+ women. Most importantly, I have a clear idea how to test, evaluate, learn, and re-test so I quickly and cheaply iterate on works to build something truly valuable that customers want. I also know how to pitch it, and have a sense of the VC process.\n\nI also have clear frameworks for how to build a company should I want to apply it again.\n\nTacklebox provided a solution for structure, teaching us a system for consistent progress that we can utilize both now and as we grow. We had thought about a few other accelerators, but we were really too early for them. Tacklebox was perfect for where we were at. We felt like the value we were going to get was WELL worth the price, and we were right. It was a no-brainer.\n\nAnyone with a seed of an idea who wants to learn how to go about validating and growing that idea. I don't have any names in particular right now, but I'd strongly recommend Tacklebox to anyone I know who is in the process of standing an idea upright before they pursue it further.\n\nThe biggest benefit to Tacklebox is the flexibility and structure. I have a demanding job with lots of travel. Even though I couldn't make all of the session in person, I felt I had all of the tools to stay connected.\n\nThis program is perfect for the entrepreneur trying jugging a full time job while considering how and when to go all-in on their startup.\n\nWe were the first international co-founders (U.S. and China) to go through Tacklebox. The program was super flexible in adapting to multiple time zones and tech to make it work.\n\nPrior to Tacklebox, I had been running a moderately successful commercial film production company. I honestly wasn’t sure I needed a service like Tacklebox in order to get my idea off the ground. Tacklebox really methodically helped me refine the idea so it’ll have the best chance of success.\n\nTacklebox is like a mix of school, boot-camp, and business-self-help. Short term, it helped me carve out time to devote to my game/app idea. Long-term, I’m left with clear steps for how to follow through and see my idea come to life. It also teaches a tried-and-true method that can be used for any new business idea.\n\nI’d recommend the program to people who are ready to go from “I have an idea” to “I’d like to devote some time and energy into making this happen”.\n\nI had hoped for years for a program like Tacklebox and didn't think it existed - I'm not sure anything else does! It answered 2 questions I'd been asking myself for a long time - 1) do I really want to be an entrepreneur someday, and 2) are my ideas viable -- without forcing me to quit my job and put everything at risk. It also offered me an incredible amount of rich content, real tools and exercises that I could put into practice both against my ideas but even within my current career. There is a lot of substance behind this curriculum, not to mention talented, ambitious classmates from whom you can also learn a lot. I could see TA being a critical turning point in so many people's careers.\n\nI didn't know what to expect when our team signed up for Tacklebox. Having finished the program, our group has built a solid footing for the next steps to launch our product. Tacklebox provides a foolproof method for vetting any of your ideas and the groundwork to build your product. Brian and Tamara breakdown their method simply and give you a step by step approach which you can repeat again and again. They hold you accountable to the work throughout the program to ensure that you get the most out of the experience. They give you all the personal coaching and guidance you could ask for, and their suggestions and insights are always spot on. Don't even think about starting a startup without going through Tacklebox first."
