The speaker provides instructions for evacuating the building in the event of a fire. Staff should head to the main stairs when they hear the fire alarm and leave the building, unless it sounds at 11am on Tuesdays which is a test. Once outside, staff should look for fire marshals wearing orange jackets who will direct them to the designated waiting area. Each department has a fire safety officer responsible for checking that all staff have evacuated, and reporting any missing people to the fire safety manager. Staff are not to re-enter the building until the fire safety manager says it is safe.",
