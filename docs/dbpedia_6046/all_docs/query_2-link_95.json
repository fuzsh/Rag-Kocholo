There is a significant increase in antibody levels 0.5 months after the booster, resulting in a 13.2-fold increase in neutralization titer. Despite a decline, the antibody levels remained above the positive threshold for 2 months (Fig. 2). The study found no significant differences in immunological antibody levels based on gender or age. However, B cell expression levels showed a significant decrease 3 months after the booster (Fig. 3).\n\nConclusion: The study provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of the BBIBP vaccine in increasing protection against COVID-19 and maintaining humoral immunity for an extended period.\n\n![Figure][1]</img>\n\n\n\n![Figure][1]</img>\n\n\n\nFootnotes \n\nCite this article as: European Respiratory Journal 2023; 62: Suppl. 67, PA4385.\n\nThis abstract was presented at the 2023 ERS International Congress, in session “Inflammatory endotyping: the macrophage across disease areas”.\n\nThis is an ERS International Congress abstract.
