        "text": "What vaccines are accepted for ingestion in the NIR?\n\nA:\n\nVaccines on the WHO EUL are accepted. These are:\n\nManufacturer\n\nName of Vaccine\n\nPfizer/BioNTech\n\nBNT162b2/Comirnaty速\n\nModerna\n\nmRNA-1273/Spikevax\n\nNovavax\n\nNVX-CoV2373/NuvaxovidTM\n\nSinovac\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccine (Vero Cell), Inactivated/CoronavacTM\n\nSinopharm\n\nSARS-CoV-2 Vaccine (VeroCell), Inactivated (lnCoV)\n\nAstrazeneca\n\nVaxzeveria AB/AZD1222(ChAdOx1-S)\n\nBharat Biotech\n\nBBV152/SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Inactivated (Vero Cell)/Covaxin速\n\nCanSinoBIO\n\nAD5.CoV2 Convidecia\n\nJanssen\n\nAd26.COV2-S\n\nSerum Institute of India\n\nCovishieldTM (ChAdOx1_nCoV-19\n\nNVX-CoV2373/Covovax\n\nFor the purpose of ingesting the vaccination records into the NIR, all vaccination doses can be accepted, regardless of how long ago they were taken. Combinations of different WHO EUL vaccines can also be accepted.\n\nHow can I get my overseas vaccination records ingested?\n\nA:\n\nIf you have a vaccination document (may be in a hardcopy or digital format)\n\nYou may visit any of the following locations to have your records verified and ingested:\n\na) Any Joint Testing and Vaccination Centre (JTVC) on Mondays to Fridays from 9am to 6.30pm\n\nTo locate these JTVCs, please click here\n\nb) Any clinic that offers this as a service.\n\nA non-exhaustive list of such clinics can be found by using this link. Please call ahead to check if your preferred clinic offers this service and to book an appointment if needed. Please note that polyclinics do not provide this service.\n\nClinics will charge a fee for the time and manpower needed to provide this service and handle the ingestion of records.\n\nWhat should I bring to the clinic to ingest my overseas vaccination records?\n\nA: Please bring along your personal identification documents (e.g. NRIC, FIN or passport) and overseas vaccination certificates, which can be in original hard copy or a digital copy. The certificates should clearly list your personal identifiers (e.g. full name, date of birth, passport number) and details of the vaccine doses you have taken (e.g. type of vaccine, date received).\n\nWhere applicable, you can also bring along documentation of a past infection (e.g. PCR test result, professionally-administered ART result, serology test result, discharge memo). If you do not have such documentation, you may have to take an anti-N serology test to confirm your past infection if you have not received an inactivated virus vaccine (i.e. vaccines such as Sinovac, Sinopharm and Covaxin). An anti-N serology test would be unable to ascertain your past infection if you had received an inactivated virus vaccine.\n\nIf your documents are not in English, please have them translated by the embassy of the country that issued the document, a translation service provider, or a notary public. Please bring along both the original documents and the translated copies. How can I check my vaccination records?\n\nA: You can view or download your vaccination records by logging in to the HealthHub app using your Singpass account. If you are eligible for Singpass but do not have access yet, please apply for Singpass in order to access your vaccination records in the HealthHub app. All Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long Term Pass Holders aged 15 years and above are eligible for Singpass.\n\nIf you are not a Singpass user, you may refer to your physical vaccination card, which is given to all individuals vaccinated in Singapore. Are the vaccine doses I have received valid?\n\nA: Some examples of acceptable vaccinations with WHO EUL vaccines and minimum intervals between doses are as follows:\n\nManufacturer\n\nName of Vaccine\n\nDoses for Complete Primary Series\n\nRecommended Interval Between Doses*\n\nMinimum Acceptable Interval Between Doses\n\nPfizer/BioNTech\n\nBNT162b2/Comirnaty速\n\n2 doses\n\n8 weeks\n\n17 days\n\nModerna\n\nmRNA-1273/ Spikevax\n\n2 doses\n\n8 weeks\n\n24 days\n\nNovavax\n\nNVX-CoV2373/ NuvaxovidTM\n\n2 doses\n\n8 weeks\n\n17 days\n\nSinovac\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccine (Vero Cell), Inactivated/ CoronavacTM\n\n2 doses\n\n8 weeks\n\n13 days\n\nSinopharm\n\nSARS-CoV-2 Vaccine (VeroCell), Inactivated (lnCoV)\n\n2 doses\n\n8 weeks\n\n17 days\n\nAstraZeneca\n\nVaxzeveria/ AB/AZD1222(ChAdOx1-S )\n\n2 doses\n\nNA\n\n24 days\n\nSerum Institute of India\n\nCovishieldTM (ChAdOx1_nCov-19-S), NVX-CoV2373/Covovax)\n\n2 doses\n\nNA\n\n24 days\n\nJanssen\n\nAd26.COV2-S\n\n1 dose\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nBharat Biotech\n\nBBV152/ Covaxin速\n\n2 doses\n\nNA\n\n24 days\n\nCanSinoBIO\n\nConvidecia (AD5.CoV2-S)\n\n1 dose\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\n* Based on national recommendations by the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination\n\nDo I need to restart my vaccination if I am late for any of my vaccine doses? A: No, you do not need to restart your vaccination. You should receive the vaccine dose as soon as possible for optimal protection.\n\nHow can I receive more doses if I need to or wish to?"
