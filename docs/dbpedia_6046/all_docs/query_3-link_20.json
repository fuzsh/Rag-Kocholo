        "meta_description": "We believe that vaccination is just a way to eliminate or strongly stop the COVID-19. In this regard, there are several vaccines with different efficacy and side effects. It is urgently required to have some efficient vaccines for the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2. In this review, international databases were considered for searching relevant articles from 1 January 2020 to 1 May 2021. Keywords were COVID-19, novel coronavirus, 2019- nCoV, coronavirus disease 2019, vaccine, Sputnik V, Gamaleya, Gam-COVID-Vac, Sinopharm, BBIBP-CorV, AstraZeneca, Vaxzevria, Oxford, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and AZD1222. Three Sputnik V, Sinopharm and AstraZeneca vaccines are useful to gain herd immunity. Enough intervals (at least three weeks/21 days) must be considered for sufficient neutralizing antibody titers. What is important is that the vaccination should be accelerated with each of the aforementioned three vaccines to achieve herd immunity in a shorter period of time because all three vaccines provide 100% prevention of severe COVID-19.",
