No knowledge of French is required, but a basic knowledge may be useful in the daily life outside the Institute.\n\nAge: The PPU doctoral program does not have an age restriction, but most accepted candidates are 24-26 years old and start their Ph.D. within a year of finishing their M.S., a few within 3 years.\n\nExternal funding: Candidates with external funding are eligible to enter the PPU program if the funding constitutes employment or if the funds can be allocated to the Institut Pasteur to pay the candidate’s salary. Such candidates must go through the same application procedure and be selected by the committee.\n\nMobility: Students who have resided or carried out their main activity (work, studies, etc.) in France for more than 12 months in the 3 years immediately prior to the 1st day of recruitment by the PPU program (1st day of employment) are not eligible. Compulsory national service and/or short stays such as holidays are not taken into account. These rules are in compliance with the mobility rules of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions of the H2020 program.\n\nTHESIS ADVISOR ELIGIBILITY\n\nTo present a candidate to the PPU program, thesis advisors must hold an HDR (Habilitation à Diriger les Recherches) diploma.\n\nThe host laboratory must be located on the campus of the Institut Pasteur in Paris.\n\nThe research team must be affiliated with a doctoral school of Université Paris Cité, Sorbonne Université or Université Paris-Saclay, and the advisors must not exceed the number of students allowed by their doctoral school.\n\nIf there are multiple scientists holding an HDR in a host laboratory, each one can propose a project and submit an application with a prospective Ph.D. candidate. However, each advisor can only supervise one PPU student at a time.\n\nAPPLICATION PROCEDURE\n\nThere are 3 steps in the selection process\n\n1. Candidates choose and are chosen by a host laboratory.\n\nFrom mid-September, a list of host laboratories and the research projects they propose are posted on the application website after registration: https://ppu.pasteur.fr (the link is proposed also in the Current Call section of this web site).\n\nApplications must be sent through the same link: the candidates can select up to four projects they are interested in, and upload a detailed CV and a motivation letter in PDF format.\n\nAdvisors may request additional information from candidates including reference letters and may interview some candidates by visio-conference. Each advisor must eventually choose only one candidate for his/her project to present to the Admission Committee.\n\nCandidates may contact potential host laboratories for further information but application must be made through the application website (no email application). Since each advisor must choose only one candidate, candidates may apply to more than one laboratory (maximum four). Advisors are asked to notify candidates who will not be selected as soon as possible. A candidate cannot be selected for more than one project.\n\nThe candidate selected for a project will then complete the application on the same platform together with the host laboratory (joint application). Graduate Record Exam (GRE) scores are welcome but not required.\n\n2. Evaluation of joint applications by the Admission Committee.\n\nThe joint applications are evaluated in December on the basis of academic qualifications, previous research experience, scientific potential of the candidate and adequation of the candidate with the proposed project. In general, applicants are expected to be among the top of those qualified to enter a Ph.D. program in their home country.\n\nThe Admission Committee is composed of Institut Pasteur scientists, representatives of the Doctoral Schools (who verify that the applicant is eligible to register for a Ph.D. at a Parisian University) and members of the PPU Program Office (who are themselves also Institut Pasteur scientists). The Admissions Committee solicits written evaluations of the applications from international senior scientists who are familiar with the applicant’s national education systems. The most promising candidates are selected for an interview.\n\n3. Interview week.\n\nSelected candidates are invited for a four-day visit to the Institut Pasteur during February. Travel expenses (economy fare) and housing during the interview week are paid by the PPU program. During the visit, candidates:\n\nVisit the host laboratory and meet its members;\n\nVisit the Institut Pasteur (technical core facilities, museum, scientific library, …);\n\nMeet the Dean of the PPU program, the Director of Education of the Institut Pasteur, members of the PPU Program Office, current students and other scientists working at the Institut Pasteur;\n\nAre interviewed by Institut Pasteur scientists who are experts in the candidate’s past and/or future research projects and by a member of the Human Resources Department.\n\nPresent their Master’s degree research (results or in progress) and their Ph.D. project to the Admission Committee which then asks questions;\n\nMeet at luncheons and dinners with students and scientists.\n\nThe Admission Committee examines the general scientific knowledge, the past research accomplishments, the understanding of the proposed Ph.D. project, the motivation of the student, and considers the comments and advice of other interviewers. It then chooses the students to be offered final admission and those to be put on a waiting list. Around 12 openings are available each year. Candidates are informed of the decision shortly after the Interview week; successful candidates are generally given 10 days to notify the PPU of their acceptance. Admission is highly competitive; each year many more qualified candidates apply than can be accepted.\n\nCriteria used by the Admission Committee for the evaluation:\n\nPresentation: Logical and coherent presentation; appropriate information; clear oral presentation without “reading the slides”; good balance master/future phd projects.\n\nAddressing the questions: comprehension of the questions, focus on the requested details, scientific knowledge, technical knowledge, ability to think about an open question.\n\nGeneral attitude: positive attitude, self-confidence, attitude open to discussion.\n\nExact dates and deadlines for each step are clearly indicated in Current Call.\n\nEducational program\n\nThe PPU program prepares students for an exciting and competitive career in scientific research, through the development of a research project, participation to academic courses, and professional development trainings. The requested duration for a PhD in France is three years.\n\nThe PPU program has its primary foundations based on scientific research. Students benefit from the highest training in conducting state-of-the-art research by mentorship, active planning and execution, as well as discussion of results with their Ph.D advisors and other leading scientists. A very dense scheduling of lectures and seminars by world renowned scientists, together with congresses and workshops, are also part of the exposure to ideas and data that students will experience on campus.\n\nACADEMIC TRAINING\n\nStudents are responsible for attending a specified number of courses dedicated to fundamental biological concepts and public health. The course syllabus fulfils requirements set forth by the universities, usually equivalent to one to two weeks of courses per year. Multiple theoretical and practical courses are available at Institut Pasteur Education Center, in Parisian universities, and at the Institut Curie. Students have their choice of courses to take, based on their personal backgrounds, interests and topics of research, in accordance with their host laboratory.\n\nStudents will also benefit from technical training by members of core facilities. Furthermore, working at the Institut Pasteur provides students with the opportunity to attend some of the many cutting-edge scientific seminars and participate in on-site symposia. Students are also encouraged to apply to international workshops and conferences, for which the PPU program will offer monetary support.\n\nPROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TRAINING\n\nIn addition to hands-on laboratory training, the PPU program requires attendance to several professional development training courses to enhance the student skills and complement their academic training:\n\nOral presentation workshop: To teach how to communicate their results and ideas effectively (identifying the key message, planning and preparation, presentation design, confident delivery and stress management, giving/receiving feedback).\n\nDuring the II° year: four classes lasting 4 hours each.\n\nJournal Club: To enhance the educational experience of participants and the assimilation of scientific evidences (learning how to critically evaluate a study, reflecting upon results and draw conclusions, understanding peer review, identifying innovation and advancement, learning how to conceptualize follow-up. (Journal Club)\n\nDuring the I° year: 1 session per month.\n\nScientific Integrity and Ethics Training courses: To learn about and discuss various ethical aspects of being a scientist (learning ethical standards in research & science and the role of a scientist in today’s society, knowing the available resources at the Institut Pasteur in case problems arise).\n\nDuring the I° year: One half day on scientific integrity, one mini-workshop with three presentations (half day) + three group discussion sessions of one hour each.\n\nFrench language courses: 3 class levels (basic, intermediate and advanced).\n\nDuring the I° year: two-hour sessions per week, on campus.\n\nTo learn how to organize a symposium, students of the II° year are in charge of the organization of the annual retreat for all PPU students, under the guidance of the PPU Graduate Office members.\n\nInstitut Pasteur international network workshop: to be informed about the main missions of the Institut Pasteur and facilitate the creation of student personal network.\n\nDuring the III° year: half a day.\n\nVarious other training sessions are available at the Institut Pasteur, the Universities in Paris, and the Institut Curie.\n\nTHESIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE\n\nA thesis advisory committee (TAC) follows the student's research progress, offering guidance as needed in addition to that provided by the laboratory in which the student is working.\n\nLUNCHEONS\n\nThe PPU program staff is fully committed to building a strong network within each incoming class of students, and between all students in the program as a whole as well as with students and scientists of the campus. For that purpose, several informal meetings are organized to give the students a chance to discuss with the members of the PPU Program Committee and PPU office on individual questions and challenges or unforeseen difficulties encountered.\n\nANNUAL RETREAT\n\nThe students of the 2nd year are responsible for the organization of the PPU annual retreat, in collaboration with members of the graduate office. The retreat lasts three days and takes place at a rotating location outside of Paris (in very nice settings). The Ph.D. advisors and faculty members are invited and students are encouraged to invite a few scientists who are experts on the topic of the chosen theme of the year to present keynote lectures.\n\nOne presentation is dedicated to the scientist who gave his/her name to the 1st year class. In addition, all students are expected to present their projects and/or their results, making this retreat a truly interdisciplinary symposium. Furthermore, students discuss their research progress with scientists both from within and outside of the Institut Pasteur. The goal is also to reinforce the networking among students and with other scientists.\n\nCHARTER OF DOCTORAL TRAINING\n\nThe rights and responsibilities of students in the Pasteur-Paris University International Doctoral Program are described in the Charter of Doctoral Training, which all students, their advisors and the heads of their laboratories are required to sign before beginning the Ph.D. project. Download here.\n\nWELCOME DAY\n\nA Welcome Day is organized for the incoming Class on their first day on campus.

Several major science courses organized at the Institut Pasteur are integrated into the master degrees of several Parisian universities. For the PPU program, the Institut Pasteur has developed a special partnership with Université de Paris, Sorbonne Université, and Université Paris Saclay. This partnership means that students are employed by the Institut Pasteur and registered at a Parisian university. Students enrolled in the PPU program perform their research project on the campus of the Institut Pasteur. The universities will deliver the diploma, on which will be indicated the co-operative nature of this program through the title “Pasteur - Paris University International Doctoral Program.\n\nAt which Parisian university will I register?\n\nYour laboratory must be affiliated with a doctoral school of one of the three partner universities. You will be registered at the same doctoral school and university as your research team.\n\nWhat is a doctoral school?\n\nA doctoral school is an association of research teams preparing Ph.D. students to a career in research through an educational program for the research profession. Each French university has several doctoral schools which are specialized in specific scientific domains. To be enrolled in a Ph.D. program, the student registers at a doctoral school.\n\nWill the courses differ depending on my university affiliation?\n\nCompletion of a Ph.D. at a French university requires participation in several scientific courses and professional trainings. All students enrolled in the PPU program will participate in a similar number of courses and training hours, regardless of the university affiliation. To fulfill this requirement, students will be able to choose among a number of courses that are the most appropriate and interesting for their individual training, including the ones that are required by the doctoral school.\n\nWho will deliver the Ph.D. diploma?\n\nThe university will deliver the diploma, which will indicate the co-operative nature of this program through the title “Pasteur - Paris University International Doctoral Program”.\n\nPh.D. Program\n\nWhat will be the approximate starting date for each new academic year?\n\nThe program starts the first week of October. Arriving in Paris between September 15 and October 1 will help to familiarize yourself with the city, the housing and the university, as well as to prepare all the necessary paperwork. The exact arrival date may vary from student to student and will depend on the status of his/her visa application (if you are not from the European Community).\n\nWhat is the expected duration of the program, from beginning to the defense of the Ph.D.?\n\nStudents are expected to finish their Ph.D. in three years. Sometimes extensions may be granted when required and justified and are subject to approval from the doctoral school. Extensions will only be given by universities if external funding is available. The PPU program only provides funding for three years.\n\nCan you summarize the practical and academic offerings of this Ph.D. program?\n\nThe program aims to meet the highest standards for education and training of Ph.D. students in the world. While spending most of the time working in individual research projects in a laboratory at Institut Pasteur, students benefit from excellent scientific courses and professional development trainings. The students will also be able to attend exciting seminars and participate in interactive workshops, annual retreats and journal clubs. The students within this program will be well supported by the staff, acting as advocates for the students’ scientific education and to provide assistance in any practical matters. A thesis advisory committee (TAC) will follow the students’ research progress and will offer guidance as needed in addition to that provided by the laboratory in which the student is working. The program offers a salary covering living costs and including health insurance. The program also offers assistance in obtaining housing upon arrival in France. Financial support for attending international conferences or summer courses will also be provided.\n\nDoes the Ph.D. program also include a Master’s program?\n\nNo.\n\nWho do I contact if I have further questions?\n\nIf you have further questions, do not hesitate to contact phd@pasteur.fr\n\nLife in Paris\n\nIs housing provided?\n\nUpon your arrival in Paris, you will be able to stay in Institut Pasteur reserved housing at the Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris (CIUP) for 6 months (up to 12 months during the sanitary crisis). The rent is paid by the student. This is a beneficial time to look for housing. The real estate market is tight and students are encouraged to actively seek housing rental opportunities. They can apply independently to continue living at the Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris (CIUP) and to the international houses of their respective countries as well. (Housing)\n\nIs there additional financial support given for family and/or spouses?\n\nNo.\n\nWill I receive help with my Visa application and other paperwork?\n\nYes. The PPU, the Graduate as well as the Human Resources offices of the Institut Pasteur will provide assistance. A Hosting Agreement (\"Protocol d'accueil\") for visa application will be sent to students selected to enter the program from outside of the European Community. Precise instructions will be sent to all students accepted into the program about the paperwork that they need to complete and the steps they need to follow. The instructions must be followed carefully.\n\nDoes Institut Pasteur provide funds for travel and moving expenses when arriving in Paris?\n\nNo. However, a 4000€ one-time bonus is added to the first paycheck.\n\nIs healthcare included in the salary?\n\nYes, healthcare is included in the salary. The Institut Pasteur will help you to enroll in the French social security system, which includes healthcare. You will eventually (usually within 3 to 6 months) get a \"Carte Vitale\", which can be used at healthcare providers to facilitate refund on expenses. Prior to obtaining the \"Carte Vitale\" students can still go to doctors and other healthcare professionals, and request a signed healthcare form (\"Feuille de soin\") which later may be sent to the French healthcare office \"Assurance Maladie\" by mail for reimbusement. Please keep copies of all payments and \"feuilles de soins\". See the Assurance Maladie \"AMELI\" website (www.ameli.fr) for more information. The website is in French, but there is an English link from there.\n\nWhere can I find more info on healthcare?\n\nRegarding your social security insurance, benefits and healthcare rights in France, check the Assurance Maladie \"AMELI\" website (www.ameli.fr).\n\nThere is also a French Health Insurance Advice Line with English-speaking operators : 09 74 75 36 46 (from France), Monday to Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m."
