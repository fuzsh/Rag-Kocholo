        "text": "This tracker is no longer being updated. It followed the development of Covid vaccines from early 2020 through August 2022. More than 120 clinical trials were underway at that time.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention maintains a list of Covid vaccines that are authorized or approved in the United States.\n\nVaccines typically require years of research and testing before reaching the clinic, but in 2020, scientists embarked on a race to produce safe and effective coronavirus vaccines in record time.\n\nBelow is a list of all vaccines that have reached trials in humans. For an explanation of virus variants and mutations, see our Coronavirus Variant Tracker. For treatments for Covid-19, see our Coronavirus Drug and Treatment Tracker. For an explanation of leading vaccines, see How Nine Covid-19 Vaccines Work.\n\nThe Vaccine Testing Process\n\nThe development cycle of a vaccine, from lab to clinic.\n\nPreclinical Vaccines\n\nPhase 1 Vaccines\n\nPhase 2 Vaccines\n\nPhase 3 Vaccines\n\nAuthorized or Approved Vaccines\n\nAbandoned Vaccines\n\nGenetic Vaccines\n\nVaccines that deliver one or more of the coronavirus’s own genes into our cells to provoke an immune response.\n\nPHASE 3\n\nAPPROVED IN U.S., ELSEWHERE EMERGENCY USE IN MANY COUNTRIES\n\nVaccine name: Comirnaty (also known as tozinameran or BNT162b2)\n\nEfficacy: 91%\n\nDose: 2 doses, 3 weeks apart\n\nType: Muscle injection\n\nStorage: Freezer storage only at –13°F to 5°F (–25°C to –15°C)\n\nOn Nov. 9, 2020, New York-based Pfizer and the German company BioNTech made history by announcing that their coronavirus vaccine had an efficacy rate of over 90 percent, far surpassing expectations. It was the first time anyone had found such evidence. Just over a month later, on Dec. 11, the Food and Drug Administration granted the vaccine, known as Comirnaty, the first emergency use authorization ever given by the United States to a coronavirus vaccine. On Aug. 23, 2021, the F.D.A. granted full approval to Comirnaty for people 16 and older, and it now has an emergency authorization for children as young as six months. Comrinaty received full approval for adolescents 12 and older on July 8, 2022.\n\nAs of July 3, 2022, Pfizer had delivered more than 3.6 billion doses of Comirnaty to 180 countries and territories.\n\nVACCINE DEVELOPMENTThe work on Comirnaty began in January 2020, when BioNTech researchers started fashioning a genetic molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA). They created the genetic instructions for building a coronavirus protein, known as spike. When the mRNA enters cells, the vaccine causes them to make spike proteins, which then get released into the body and provoke a response from the immune system. In March 2020, BioNTech partnered with Pfizer to scale up the research, launching a clinical trial in May.\n\nTRIAL RESULTSThe Phase 1 trials showed that Comirnaty caused volunteers to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, as well as immune cells called T cells that respond to the virus. On July 27, the companies announced the launch of a Phase 2/3 trial with 30,000 volunteers. On Sept. 12, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that they would seek to expand the trial to 44,000 participants.\n\nThrough the summer and into the fall, the world closely followed the Pfizer-BioNTech trial. In September, Dr. Albert Bourla, the chief executive of Pfizer, said that as soon as October the Phase 3 trial would deliver enough results to show if the vaccine worked or not. President Trump touted their progress, hinting that a vaccine would be available before the election. But on Oct. 27, Dr. Bourla announced that the volunteers in the trial had yet to experience enough cases of Covid-19 to determine if the vaccines work. Finally, on Nov. 9, Pfizer and BioNTech released their preliminary analysis of the first 94 cases of Covid-19 in their volunteers.\n\nOver the next month, Pfizer and BioNTech released more data on more cases. On Dec. 8 the FDA released their independent analysis of the clinical trials. They determined that Comirnaty has an efficacy rate of 95 percent. While Comirnaty caused no serious side effects, it frequently caused short-lived fatigue, fever, and muscle aches.\n\nIn Israel, which took the lead in mass vaccination, researchers found that the vaccine was as effective in the real world as the trials had indicated. A study published by the Centers for Disease Control in March found that the vaccine is 91.3% effective after the second dose.\n\nSubsequent trials showed that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was safe and effective for children as young as five. But in children aged 2 to 5, the dosage did not produce high levels of antibodies, and so Pfizer announced on Dec. 17, 2021, that it would try again in a trial using three doses instead of two. In May 2022, Pfizer announced that the extra dose produced favorable responses.\n\nAUTHORIZATIONOn Dec. 2, 2020, the United Kingdom became the first country to give Comirnaty emergency authorization, followed by many more countries. On Dec. 31, the World Health Organization gave the vaccine an Emergency Use Listing, which sped up its authorization across the world. The F.D.A. expanded its authorization for adolescents 12 through 15 on Jan. 3, 2022. On Feb. 1, 2022, Pfizer began the process of applying for an expansion of its authorization for children younger than five, after the F.D.A. made the unusual step of requesting it. An advisory panel to the F.D.A. voted to recommend Comirnaty for that age group on June 15, and emergency authorization came two days later.\n\nDISTRIBUTIONAs their clinical trials progressed, Pfizer and BioNTech also scaled up factories to produce Comirnaty. To secure a supply in advance, the Trump administration awarded Pfizer and BioNTech a $1.9 billion contract in July 2020 for 100 million doses. By July 2021, the companies had reached agreements with the United States government for a total of a billion doses: half for domestic use and half for donations to other countries. In April 2021, the European Union negotiated an option to purchase 1.8 billion doses, which they exercised in December in response to the Omicron variant.\n\nIn June 2022, Pfizer reached an agreement with the United States for a new delivery of vaccines in preparation for an anticipated winter surge. The U.S. government agreed to pay $3.2 billion for 105 million doses.\n\nWhile Comirnaty has proven highly effective, it was initially a challenging vaccine to distribute because it had to be kept frozen at –94°F (–70°C). On Feb. 19, 2021, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that they could keep the vaccine stable at –25°C to –15°C (–13°F to 5°F).\n\nVARIANTSIn January 2021, scientists grew concerned about the emergence of fast-spreading variants that might be able to evade antibodies. A study published in May demonstrated that Comirnaty was somewhat less effective against some variants, but still provided strong protection. A British study showed that Comirnaty had an effectiveness of 88 percent against infection with Delta, the variant first identified in India. Its effectiveness against hospitalization from Delta was 96 percent.\n\nOn Dec. 8, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that the Omicron variant greatly reduced the ability of vaccine antibodies to neutralize the coronavirus. However, results from two lab studies, released on Jan. 24, 2022, suggested that three doses of the vaccine were able to generate antibodies against Omicron. And epidemiological studies show that three doses of Comirnaty are highly effective at preventing serious Covid from Omicron infections. Pfizer and BioNTech launched a trial of an Omicron-specific vaccine on Jan. 25, but delays have kept the companies from deploying the vaccine, they said on Feb. 16. Results from trials suggest that the vaccine is effective at protecting adults from Omicron, the companies said on June 25. They launched a Phase 2 trial of the Omicron-specific vaccine on July 27.\n\nOn June 15, the companies said that the European Medicines Agency had launched its review of a version of its vaccine adapted against variants. Pfizer and BioNTech applied to the F.D.A. for emergency use authorization of the vaccine on Aug. 22.\n\nBOOSTERSIn April 2021, Dr. Bourla, the chief executive, said people would “likely” need an additional shot of its vaccine within a year of receiving two doses. Over the summer, evidence began to emerge that Comirnaty’s effectiveness against infection was waning. Researchers in Israel, which got an early start on mass vaccination in January, observed that the vaccine was also becoming less effective in people over 65 at preventing hospitalization. A Phase 3 trial on 10,000 volunteers found that a Pfizer-BioNTech booster has an efficacy of 95.6 percent against disease, at a time when the Delta variant was dominant.\n\nAs the Delta variant fueled a new surge of cases in Israel, the country began providing a third dose of Comirnaty as a booster. Other countries followed suit. An Israeli study published on March 16, 2022, found that a fourth dose lifted antibody levels once again, but it may only offer marginal benefits for young adults compared to getting just three shots.\n\nThe F.D.A. expanded its emergency authorization to include a third dose of Comirnaty in certain immunocompromised adults on Aug. 13. In November 2021, the F.D.A. authorized the Comirnaty booster for all adults 18 and older. Health officials expanded that authorization to 16- and 17-year olds the following month, and then to children 12 and older in January 2022. In May it further expanded its booster authorization to children as young as five.\n\nOn March 29, the F.D.A. authorized a fourth dose of Comirnaty in those aged 50 and older and certain immunocompromised people to protect against emerging variants.\n\nResults from a trial in children aged 5 through 11, released on April 14, 2022, suggest that a third dose of the vaccine produced substantial antibodies against the Omicron variant. Pfizer has asked the F.D.A. to expand the emergency use authorization for boosters down to age 5. On Aug. 31, 2022, the F.D.A. authorized Pfizer’s latest booster, a combination of RNA for the original coronavirus and BA.5.\n\nFor more details, see How the Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine Works and How Pfizer Makes Its Covid-19 Vaccine.\n\nApproved for use in: Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, United States.\n\nEmergency use in: Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, Bhutan, Bolivia, Bonaire, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brunei, Cabo Verde, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Côte d’Ivoire, Curaçao, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, European Union, Faroe Islands, French Polynesia, Gabon, Georgia, Ghana, Greenland, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Hong Kong, Iceland, Indonesia, Iraq, Israel, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kosovo, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Libya, Liechtenstein, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Martinique, Mexico, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Mongolia, Nepal, New Caledonia, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Niue, Norway, North Macedonia, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Serbia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, South Africa, South Korea, St. Maarten, Sudan, Taiwan, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tokelau, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Turks and Caicos, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Vatican, Vietnam, West Bank, Zambia. Emergency use validation from the World Health Organization. Recommended for emergency use by the Caribbean Regulatory System.\n\nPHASE 3\n\nAPPROVED IN U.S., ELSEWHERE EMERGENCY USE IN MANY COUNTRIES\n\nVaccine name: mRNA-1273 or Spikevax\n\nEfficacy: Preventing Covid-19 illness: 93.2%. Preventing severe disease: 98.2%.\n\nDose: 2 doses, 4 weeks apart\n\nType: Muscle injection\n\nStorage: 30 days with refrigeration, 6 months at –4°F (–20°C)\n\nOn Dec. 18, 2020, the F.D.A. gave emergency use authorization for a vaccine made by the Boston-based company Moderna. The Moderna vaccine, known as Spikevax or mRNA-1273, was the second to be authorized for adults 18 and older by the F.D.A., coming a week after Comirnaty, the vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech. In 2021, Moderna shipped over 800 million doses worldwide. The F.D.A. gave full approval to Spikevax on Jan. 31, 2022, and it is now authorized for children as young as six months.\n\nVACCINE DEVELOPMENTLike Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna makes its vaccine from mRNA. In recent years, the company had tested mRNA vaccines for a number of diseases, but they had yet to bring one to market. In January 2020, they began developing a vaccine for the coronavirus.\n\nThe United States government bankrolled Moderna’s efforts, providing nearly $1 billion in support. In partnership with the National Institutes of Health, they found that Spikevax protects monkeys from the coronavirus.\n\nTRIAL RESULTSIn March 2020, Moderna launched the first clinical trial of a Covid-19 vaccine. After those studies yielded promising results, Phase 3 testing on 30,000 volunteers began on July 27.\n\nOn Nov. 16, Moderna announced that the first preliminary data demonstrated that the vaccine provided strong protection against Covid-19. In a paper published in September 2021, researchers reported that the efficacy of the vaccine at preventing Covid-19 illness was 93.2 percent. The efficacy of the vaccine in preventing severe disease was 98.2 percent.\n\nOn May 25, 2021, Moderna announced that the vaccine safely provided strong protection to children as young as 12. On Sept. 22, an NYU study suggested that Pfizer and Moderna vaccine doses which were administered to pregnant women later brought about a high amount of antibodies in their newborns. And on Oct. 25, Moderna said that the vaccine produced a powerful immune response in children aged 6 through 11. Positive results pushed Moderna to announce that it would apply for emergency use authorization in children younger than six on March 23, 2022.\n\nAUTHORIZATIONThe United States currently authorizes the use of Spikevax for people six months and older. In June 2021, after the F.D.A. authorized the use of the vaccine in adults, Moderna applied to expand the authorization to children as young as 12. The Europe Medicines Agency authorized giving Spikevax to adolescents in July and expanded its authorization on March 3, 2022, to include children aged 6 to 11. On April 28, 2022, Moderna asked the F.D.A. to authorize its vaccine for children younger than 6. An advisory panel to the F.D.A. voted to recommend Spikevax for that age group on June 15, and emergency authorization came two days later.\n\nDISTRIBUTIONWhile Moderna’s clinical trials were still underway in the summer of 2020, the company entered deals with several countries to supply the vaccine pending its approval. On Aug. 11, the United States government awarded the company $1.5 billion in exchange for 100 million doses if the vaccine proves safe and effective. Additional negotiations have increased the agreement to 500 million doses. The European Commission secured 460 million doses. Moderna has made similar deals with other countries including Canada, Japan, Qatar and South Korea. The company has also pledged 650 million doses to COVAX, a global vaccine initiative, to supply vaccines to low-income countries. On April 29, Moderna announced they would produce 800 million to 1 billion doses in 2021, and planned to manufacture 3 billion doses in 2022.\n\nVARIANTSInitially, Moderna’s vaccine proved highly effective against variants such as Beta and Delta that emerged in 2021. The Omicron variant proved able to evade some of the immunity provided by the vaccine, making the vaccine less effective at protecting against infection. However, the vaccine remained effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization and death.\n\nBOOSTERSWhen variants emerged in early 2021, Moderna initially tested boosters tailored to their particular molecular structure. In March 2021, Moderna began a Phase 1 trial of a new mRNA vaccine made specifically for the Beta variant, which yielded positive results in humans and mice.\n\nHowever, the first Moderna boosters to go into use were simply a third dose of the original vaccine. Results from a trial of a third Moderna shot in adults who received an organ transplant suggested that the booster improved their immune response — a finding that led the F.D.A. to authorize the booster shot in that population. The company then ran a trial on healthy volunteers and found that a booster of the original strain raised their production of antibodies against all major variants.\n\nOn Oct. 20, the F.D.A. authorized Moderna boosters for people over the age of 65 and those with weakened immune systems or greater risk of infection due to their work. In November 2021, the F.D.A. authorized the Moderna booster for all adults 18 and older. Moderna asked the F.D.A. for authorization for a fourth dose in adults 18 and older in March 2022. On March 29, the F.D.A. authorized the fourth dose in those 50 and older and certain immunocompromised people.\n\nMeanwhile Moderna continued to experiment with variant-specific boosters. On June 8, 2022, they announced that an Omicron-specific booster produced a strong increase in antibodies against the variant. The company said on June 22 that the booster also works against newly evolved forms of the Omicron variant called BA.4 and BA.5. On July 29, Moderna announced a deal with the United States government to provide 66 million booster shots, containing RNA for the original spike protein, as well as one shared by BA.4 and BA.5.\n\nModerna’s Omicron booster won conditional approval from the United Kingdom on Aug. 15, 2022. The company said in an Aug. 23 statement that it had completed its application to the F.D.A. for approval. On Aug. 31, 2022, the F.D.A. authorized Moderna’s latest booster, a combination of RNA for the original coronavirus and BA.5.\n\nFor more details, see How Moderna’s Vaccine Works.\n\nApproved for use in: United States, Canada, Switzerland.\n\nEmergency use in: Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Botswana, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Curacao, Egypt, European Union, Faroe Islands, Fiji, Ghana, Greenland, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Libya, Liechtenstein, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Mexico, Micronesia, Moldova, Mongolia, Nepal, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Palestinian Authority, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Qatar, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Saba, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Martin, Saudi Arabia, Seychelles, Singapore, Sint Eustatius, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Vietnam, West Bank. Emergency use validation from the World Health Organization.\n\nPHASE 3 EMERGENCY USE IN INDIA\n\nVaccine name: ZyCoV-D\n\nEfficacy: 66.6%\n\nDose: 2 or 3 doses, 4 weeks apart\n\nType: Skin injection\n\nStorage: Stable at room temperature for three months\n\nIn July 2020, the Indian vaccine-maker Zydus Lifesciences (then known as Zydus Cadila) began testing a DNA-based vaccine delivered by a skin patch. After getting promising results in their Phase 1 trial, they launched a Phase 2 trial on ZyCoV-D on Aug. 6. On Jan. 3, 2021 the Indian government gave Zydus Lifesciences permission to advance to a Phase 3 trial with 30,000 volunteers.\n\nThe company announced on July 1 that the vaccine had an efficacy of 66.6% and that none of the vaccinated volunteers in the trial developed severe disease or died, making ZyCoV-D the first DNA-based vaccine shown to work against Covid-19. The results were published in April 2022.\n\nZydus Lifesciences received emergency authorization from the Indian government on Aug. 20, 2021. The authorization was later expanded to include adolescents 12 and older. On Feb. 3, 2022, Zydus Lifesciences announced it had delivered its first shipment of vaccines to the Indian government. Zydus Lifesciences received authorization from Indian health officials to administer ZyCoV-D in a two-dose regimen on April 27.\n\nBut in May 2022 the Hindu Business Line reported that there had been negligible demand for ZyCoV-D, with no commercial opportunity for the rest of the year.\n\nEmergency use in: India.\n\nPHASE 3 EMERGENCY USE IN INDIA\n\nOn June 28, 2022, India authorized GEMCOVAC-19, a Covid-19 vaccine that contains self-amplifying RNA. It became the third RNA-based vaccine to get the green light. And unlike RNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, which have to be frozen, GEMCOVAC-19 only needs to be refrigerated.\n\nSeattle-based HDT Bio developed the original technology behind GEMCOVAC-19. Their prototype vaccine, known as HGC019, safely provoked animals to make antibodies to the coronavirus. In July 2020, HDT Bio teamed up with Gennova Biopharmaceuticals to launch clinical trials in India. Phase 1/2 trials started in December 2020.\n\nIn March 2022, HDT Bio sued Gennova’s parent company, Emcore. In its court filing, HDT Bio accused the Indian company of stealing trade secrets for the vaccine and claiming it as their own. In May, Emcore sought to have the lawsuit dismissed. A decision was still pending as of June.\n\nGennova has yet to publish the results of its Phase 3 study. The company told the Indian Express that it had submitted data to the Indian government showing that GEMCOVAC’s immune response was as good or better than Covishield, the Indian version of the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nMeanwhile, HDT Bio has partnered with Quratis to launch a trial in South Korea, with SENAI CIMATEC in Brazil and with another company in China. HDT Bio is also reportedly creating a version of the RNA vaccine tailored for the Omicron variant.\n\nEmergency use in: India.\n\nPHASE 3\n\nIn the spring of 2022, the Omicron variant created a crippling surge of Covid cases in China. Calls came for China to switch from inactivated-virus vaccines to more effective ones made from mRNA. Rather than import these vaccines from Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech, the government reportedly chose to wait for the development of a Chinese mRNA vaccine, called AWcorna. But even though research on AWcorna began early in the pandemic, Phase 3 clinical trial results had yet to emerge as of June 2022.\n\nIn July 2020, Chinese researchers at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Suzhou Abogen Biosciences and Walvax Biotechnology published a paper describing how they created AWcorna (originally known as ARCoV). While authorized mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna encode the entire spike protein, AWcorna only encodes the tip of the protein, called the receptor binding domain.\n\nA Phase 1 trial carried out in the summer of 2020 demonstrated that the vaccine was safe and produced modest amounts of antibodies, as the researchers described in a paper they published in January 2022.\n\nThe Phase 2 trial of AWcorna commenced in January 2021, followed by a Phase 3 trial in July. In January 2022, Reuters reported that the trial had progressed in China, Indonesia, and Mexico. Reuters reported in February 2022 that Walvax had a capacity to make 400 million doses and planned to increase their production. But in April Bloomberg reported that disappointing preliminary results might delay the introduction of the vaccine in China till the end of 2022.\n\nOn Nov. 24, 2021, researchers also registered a separate Phase 3 trial to assess the vaccine as a booster. In a paper published in February 2022, researchers reported that a third dose of AWcorna was potent against Omicron in vaccinated mice. That study was followed by a clinical trial in which researchers compared AWcorna as a booster against the inactivated virus vaccines Sinopharm and Sinovac. Researchers found that AWcorna produced higher levels of antibodies that neutralize the coronavirus. But it is still not clear how AWcorna compares against other mRNA vaccines, either as a primary vaccination or a booster.\n\nIn December 2021, the U.S. government put the military academy on an export blacklist over concerns their research on biometrics and other technologists might become a threat to national security. It’s not clear how that move will affect the development of AWcorna.\n\nPHASE 3\n\nVaccine name: INO-4800\n\nEfficacy: Unknown\n\nDose: To be determined\n\nType: Skin injection\n\nStorage: Over a year at room temperature\n\nThe Pennsylvania-based company Inovio gained attention early in the pandemic. At a March 2020 White House meeting, Inovio’s chief executive, J. Joseph Kim, described the company as a leader in the race to make a Covid vaccine. But two years later, Inovio had yet to demonstrate that their vaccine is effective\n\nBefore the pandemic, the company developed DNA-based vaccines that are delivered into the skin with electric pulses from a hand-held device. At the start of the pandemic, Inovio created a DNA vaccine against the spike protein on the coronavirus. A Phase 1 trial, published in December 2020, did not uncover any serious adverse effects, and measured an immune response in all 38 volunteers.\n\nBut Inovio soon experienced a number of setbacks. The company became embroiled in several lawsuits with stockholders and a company partner. On Sept. 28, 2020, the F.D.A. put the vaccine on a partial hold due to questions about the delivery device. The pause was lifted in November.\n\nIn November 2020, Inovio started Phase 2 trials in the United States as well as in China and South Korea. But by the time Inovio began preparing for a Phase 3 trial of their vaccine, other vaccines had already been authorized and being deployed on a wide scale. As a result, the U.S. government decided in April 2021 to stop supporting Inovio’s trial.\n\nOn Aug. 26, 2021, Inovio announced that Brazilian regulators authorized their Phase 3 trial, and in September they announced that they had received approval for another Phase 3 trial in the Philippines and in Mexico. The F.D.A. authorized a Phase 3 trial in the U.S. on Nov. 9, 2021. However, these trials have yet to move forward.\n\nMore disappointment came in February 2022, when the company reported that the vaccine was proving less potent against the Omicron variant. As a result, Inovio paused the trial to change its design. They will be measuring the vaccine’s efficacy only against severe disease, rather than against any symptomatic cases of Covid.\n\nOn May 10, 2022, Inovio said that it would discontinue its Phase 3 trial and focus attention on testing the vaccine as a booster. Their booster trial is currently in Phase 2.\n\nThe World Health Organization selected Inovio’s vaccine as one its first candidates in the Solidarity Trial Vaccine study. In an August 2022 corporate presentation, Inovio said that this Phase 3 trial had begun.\n\nPHASE 2 PHASE 3 COMBINED PHASES\n\nVaccine name: ARCT-154\n\nEfficacy: 55% against infection, 95.3% against severe disease. (Trial conducted when Delta and Omicron were dominant.)\n\nThe California-based company Arcturus Therapeutics and Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore have developed a vaccine called ARCT-154 that delivers mRNA that can self-replicate inside cells. As a result, the vaccine requires a lower dose to produce the viral proteins required for an immune response. Tests on animals showed that it protected them against infection.\n\nStarting in August 2020, Arcturus launched a series of clinical trials on two different versions of the vaccine. Results from the trials suggest that both candidates stimulate the production of antibodies against several variants, including Omicron.\n\nOn April 20, 2022, Arcturus announced that ARCT-154 had an efficacy of 55 percent against infection, and 95.3 percent against severe disease, including death. While the efficacy of the vaccine was lower than mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, the company noted that its volunteers were exposed to the Delta and Omicron variants, instead of the original strain of the coronavirus. In May 2022, Arcturus reported that ARCT-154 performed well as a booster for people vaccinated with Comirnaty and later reported that it raised antibodies against the Omicron variant and its subvariants.\n\nOn February 28, 2022, Arcturus announced it had applied for emergency use authorization in Vietnam for ARCT-154. In an August 2022 company report, it said that a government reorganization delayed the vaccine’s review. Arcturus said it expected authorization in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nPHASE 2 PHASE 3 COMBINED PHASES\n\nJapan-based researchers at Daiichi Sankyo have developed an mRNA vaccine against the coronavirus in collaboration with the University of Tokyo. They launched a Phase 1/2 trial of the vaccine, named DS-5670, on March 22, 2021. In an Oct. 21 press release, Daiichi Sankyo said that the vaccine produced no relevant safety concerns in the trial. The company began Phase 2 trials on Nov. 17, and reported positive results in a May 26, 2022 press release.\n\nIn January 2022, the company started a Phase 2/3 trial of the vaccine as a booster. On May 26, 2022, Daiichi Sankyo announced that the level of antibodies produced by a DS-5670 booster were comparable or higher than authorized mRNA vaccines. The company said it was going to launch a trial on 4,500 volunteers to compare the performance of their booster to one that has already been approved. In June, Biospectrum reported that Daiichi Sankyo planned to commercialize the vaccine by the end of 2022.\n\nPHASE 2\n\nCanada’s Providence Therapeutics specializes in messenger RNA vaccines to treat cancer. In response to the pandemic, they developed an mRNA vaccine against the coronavirus. They launched a Phase 1 study of an RNA vaccine in late January 2021, and in May 2022 they published results of the trial, showing that the vaccine appeared safe and produced promising levels of antibodies. In August 2021, Providence Therapeutics launched a Phase 2 trial comparing the vaccine to Comirnaty.\n\nIn June 2021, the company reached an agreement with the Indian vaccine maker Biological E to carry out further trials in India. Biological E agreed to purchase up to 30 million doses and planned to scale their production of the vaccine to as many as a billion doses in 2022. In September, Providence also reached an agreement with Everest Medicines to produce and market the vaccine in China.\n\nIn December 2021, Providence Therapeutics announced that the World Health Organization had chosen its vaccine as one of the candidates it will test in its Solidarity Trial Vaccine study.\n\nIn an Aug. 24, 2022, update, Everest said that it and Providence expect to launch a Phase 3 trial for the booster vaccine this year. The two companies predict that its vaccine will be approved and marketed globally in 2023.\n\nPHASE 2\n\nResearchers at Thailand’s Chulalongkorn University developed several potential vaccines for the coronavirus. The furthest along is an mRNA-based vaccine known as ChulaCov19. In September 2020, the Chula Vaccine Research Center registered a Phase 1 trial to test it in humans. Delays in funding and manufacturing slowed the study’s launch until June 2021. In May 2022, Chula researchers issued a report showing that the Phase 1 volunteers produced higher antibodies than people who received Comirnaty.\n\nIn an interview with the Bangkok Post, the leader of the project said that up to 30 million doses might be produced for Thailand and six other Asian countries if the vaccine proved to be safe and effective. Citing positive preliminary results, the researchers said in August that the vaccine would soon advance to the next phase of clinical trials.\n\nAt a November 2021 conference at Chulalongkorn University, the scientists behind the vaccine said that Phase 2 trials were completed with satisfactory results, and that the Thai government had approved Phase 3 trials. But a Phase 3 trial is not yet registered.\n\nIn May 2022, the Bangkok Post reported that a factory in Thailand was beginning to produce the vaccine, and it could be authorized by the end of 2022.\n\nPHASE 2\n\nChinese researchers from AIM Vaccine and Liverna Therapeutics have developed an mRNA vaccine against the coronavirus. They registered a Phase 1 trial in China on July 31, 2021, and reported positive results in January 2022. On April 29, 2022, they registered a Phase 2 trial.\n\nPHASE 2\n\nCSPC Pharmaceutical Group is working on an mRNA vaccine against the coronavirus, called SYS6006. After promising results from preclinical studies, CSPC said on April 3, 2022, that it had received approval to begin clinical trials in China. The researchers moved to Phase 2 trials on June 30.\n\nPHASE 1 PHASE 2 COMBINED PHASES\n\nVaccine name: AG0302-COVID19\n\nEfficacy: Unknown\n\nDose: 2 doses, 2 weeks apart\n\nType: Skin injection\n\nStorage: Over a year at room temperature\n\nOn June 30, 2020, the Japanese biotechnology company AnGes launched a Phase 1 trial to test a DNA-based vaccine, developed in partnership with Osaka University and Takara Bio. The company moved on to a Phase 2/3 trial in December. Preliminary results suggested the dose was too low to produce a strong immune response, and so the researchers registered a new Phase 1/2 trial of the vaccine at a higher dose on Augs. 6, 2021. On Nov. 25, AnGes released a statement rebutting reports that it had abandoned progress on the vaccine. Even though the candidate’s ability to generate antibodies has been disappointing, it said, the trials would continue. AnGes said on Feb. 15, 2022, that the trial was experiencing delays and that the final results still need to be analyzed before moving to Phase 3 trials.\n\nPHASE 1 PHASE 2 COMBINED PHASES\n\nGeneOne Life Science, a South Korean biotech company, developed a DNA-based vaccine that encodes two proteins from the coronavirus. In December 2020, they launched a Phase 1/2 trial with 345 participants. After receiving positive interim results from the trial, GeneOne announced on July 8, 2021 that it would begin Phase 2.\n\nGeneOne is also experimenting with different vaccine delivery techniques. On Oct. 20, the company registered a Phase 1 trial to gauge how well their candidate works when injected into a patient’s arm and delivered as a nasal spray. In the study, the researchers will also see if a skin suction device will improve outcomes. In January 2022, GeneOne registered a new trial to test their vaccine as a booster. The trial began on May 23, 2022.\n\nPHASE 1 PHASE 2 COMBINED PHASES\n\nTakis Biotech and Rottapharm Biotech, two vaccine companies in Italy, developed a vaccine called COVID-eVax. A special device uses a tiny electric pulse to deliver DNA through the skin. The DNA enters cells, which use the genetic instructions to make spike protein fragments. In February 2021, Takis and Rottapharm launched a Phase 1/2 trial in Italy. COVID-eVax can remain stable at room temperature. In September, the companies issued a press release stating that the Phase 1 trial delivered promising results. But they were not yet able to proceed to a Phase 2 trial because the vaccination rate in Italy had climbed so high that recruiting volunteers would be difficult.\n\nIn November 2021, Takis and Rottapharm announced they had created an Omicron-specific version of COVID-eVax. But they acknowledged that they still lacked funding for additional clinical studies. By then, Italy’s vaccination rate had climbed so far that the companies said it would be difficult to recruit enough volunteers to move to the Phase 2 trial. They have not issued any further statements about the status of the vaccine.\n\nPHASE 1 PHASE 2 COMBINED PHASES\n\nResearchers at Baltimore-based Elixirgen Therapeutics have created an RNA vaccine, named EXG-5003, that targets a small part of the coronavirus spike protein. In May 2021 they launched a Phase 1/2 trial of the vaccine in Japan. On Oct. 8, Elixirgen announced that it has licensed its vaccine to an undisclosed company for worldwide marketing, excluding Japan.\n\nPHASE 1 PHASE 2 COMBINED PHASES\n\nResearchers at Korean biotechnology company Eyegene have developed an mRNA vaccine that uses a delivery system slightly different from other genetic vaccines. Instead of using a lipid nanoparticle, their vaccine uses liposomes — tiny fat bubbles — to bring the genetic material to the cell. Korean regulators approved a Phase 1/2 trial in August 2021 for the vaccine, called EG-COVID. Eyegene’s C.E.O., Wonil Yoo, told a Korean television station that the trial began in September. But in December, Eyegene said that it will receive help from the Korean government in recruiting patients for the trial, after experiencing difficulties finding enough eligible participants. In January 2022, Eyegene registered the trial in Australia. Eyegene received approval to conduct a Phase 1/2 booster trial of EG-COVID in Australia on Feb. 21, 2022.\n\nPHASE 1 PHASE 2 COMBINED PHASES\n\nChinese researchers at Stemirna Therapeutics have developed an mRNA vaccine in collaboration with Shanghai East Hospital. They registered a Phase 1 trial on May 1, 2021. The scientists registered another Phase 1/2 trial on Dec. 3 and an additional Phase 1 trial on May 12, 2022.\n\nPHASE 1 PHASE 2 COMBINED PHASES\n\nNorwegian biopharmaceutical company Nykode Therapeutics have developed two DNA vaccine candidates to protect against coronavirus variants. On Oct. 6, 2021, the researchers registered a Phase 1/2 trial. They will test the two vaccines head-to-head in the first part of the study and then select one for further trials. Formerly called Vaccibody, the company changed its name on Nov. 23. Nykode and needle-free injection technology company PharmaJet announced a new Phase 1/2 trial to address variants on Dec. 14.\n\nPHASE 1 PHASE 2 COMBINED PHASES\n\nIn addition to its adenovirus-based vaccine, ImmunityBio has developed two additional vaccines that use self-amplifying RNA to stimulate the body’s T cells. Researchers registered a Phase 1/2 trial to compare the two as boosters in May 2022.\n\nPHASE 1\n\nThe Canadian company Entos Pharmaceuticals has created a DNA vaccine for the coronavirus. Most other genetic vaccines carry the gene for the spike protein on the surface of the virus. Entos instead chose the gene for a protein called nucleocapsid that sits inside the virus’s membrane. The company is betting it can offer long-lasting immunity.\n\nIn October 2020, Entos launched a Phase 1 trial in Canada for their vaccine, called Covigenix VAX-001. They began dosing participants on April 15. Entos C.E.O. John Lewis told Canadian media on Aug. 4 that the vaccine produced a sufficient immune response without adverse reactions. Lewis later told the Owen Sound Sun Times in December 2021 that a Phase 2 trial would begin in South Africa in early 2022, but the company had not yet announced the trial as of August 2022. Entos is also one of four vaccine makers that received a portion of an $81.2 million commitment from the Alberta government to develop their candidates.\n\nPHASE 1\n\nOn Nov. 2, 2020, the Canadian company Symvivo announced they had administered a DNA vaccine to their first volunteer in a Phase 1 trial. The DNA is inserted into harmless bacteria, which volunteers swallow in a frozen liquid (the company is working on putting the bacteria into a pill). When the bacteria reach the intestines, the DNA slips into cells in the gut lining, which then make viral proteins. Symvivo announced on July 19, 2021 that it received nearly $5 million in funding from the National Research Council of Canada’s Industrial Research Assistance Program to continue developing its vaccine.\n\nIn its trial registry, Symvivo said that it expected results from the Phase 1 study in February 2022. The company has yet to release any data from the trial. And on May 3, Symvivo pushed the study completion date to September 2022 in the trial registry.\n\nPHASE 1\n\nUsing a delivery system from PharmaJet, researchers at BioNet-Asia and Australia-based Technovalia have developed a DNA vaccine called COVIGEN that can be pushed through the skin without a needle. Instead, the dose is loaded into a handheld device and shot directly into cell tissue through a jet spray of fluid. Vaccines for the flu already use the device, which PharmaJet says is a safer alternative to needle injections.\n\nThe University of Sydney registered a Phase 1 trial of COVIGEN in Australia on Feb. 8, 2021. In January 2022, Technovalia announced that an interim study found no safety issues with the vaccine. The company said that the trial would shift to testing COVIGEN as a booster on people who are already vaccinated.\n\nPHASE 1\n\nScancell, a British company that develops treatments for cancer, has created two DNA vaccine candidates against the coronavirus. Their first vaccine, called SCOV1, targets the original virus and its early variants. SCOV2 is intended to act as a booster shot. Scancell is using a needle-free injection technology made by Colorado-based PharmaJet to administer the vaccines into the skin through a concentrated jet of fluid. On Jan. 31, 2022, the company announced that it had dosed the first volunteer in its Phase 1 clinical trial in South Africa. Scancell broadened the trial to include individuals with prior infection or other vaccines in March. In May, Scancell pushed the study completion date to December 2022 in their trial registry.\n\nPHASE 1\n\nGritstone bio has developed experimental vaccines in recent years that teach the immune system to attack tumors. The company has created vaccines for Covid-19 based on RNA molecules that can make copies of themselves, increasing the production of viral proteins from each cell. While most RNA-based vaccines produce spike proteins, Gritstone bio includes RNA molecules to produce parts of other viral proteins. T cells can use those additional proteins to recognize infected cells and kill them. Experiments on monkeys, published in June 2022, showed that the vaccine produced high levels of antibodies and protected the animals from disease.\n\nOn Sept. 20, 2021, Gritstone dosed the first volunteer in a Phase 1 trial to gauge the effectiveness of the mRNA vaccine as a booster shot in older adults who have already received the Astrazeneca vaccine. In January 2022, the company announced promising initial results from the trial.\n\nIn a financial report in August 2022, Gritstone bio announced that three additional Phase 1 trials were underway, including volunteers with immune systems compromised by HIV and B cell deficiencies.\n\nPHASE 1\n\nResearchers at the University of Hong Kong developed a DNA vaccine against the coronavirus. In a Phase 1 trial, which was registered on Nov. 1, 2021, the researchers injected the vaccine into the muscles of volunteers, followed by electric shocks to induce cells into receiving the vaccine. They wrote in the trial record that this strategy could improve vaccine uptake.\n\nPHASE 1\n\nVLP Therapeutics Japan, a subsidiary of Maryland-based company VLP Therapeutics, won funding in August 2020 from the Japanese government to develop a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against the coronavirus. In October 2020, it announced a partnership with FUJIFILM to help manufacture their candidate, called VLPCOV-01. The researchers registered a Phase 1 clinical trial in Japan a year later. On Feb. 1, 2022, they launched a Phase 1 trial for the vaccine as a booster.\n\nPHASE 1\n\nResearchers at DIOSynVax, led by a professor at the University of Cambridge, have developed a genetic vaccine that targets specific parts of the coronavirus that they say are common across all known variants. They have partnered with PharmaJet to administer the vaccine, called DIOS-CoVax, through the skin without using needles. On Dec. 14, the BBC reported that a Phase 1 trial began in the United Kingdom to assess DIOS-CoVax’s effectiveness as a booster in participants who have already received two doses of another vaccine. On March 8, 2022, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations announced that it would give up to $42 million to DIOSynVax to develop a vaccine against a range of coronaviruses.\n\nPHASE 1\n\nVaccine name: CV2nCoV\n\nDose: 2 doses, 4 weeks apart\n\nType: Muscle injection\n\nStorage: Stable at least 3 months at 36–46°F (2–8°C)\n\nIn March 2022, the German company CureVac, in partnership with GSK, launched Phase 1 clinical trial for an mRNA vaccine called CV2nCoV. The vaccine is an improved version of CureVac’s initial Covid vaccine, CVnCoV, which delivered disappointing results in clinical trials in 2021 .\n\nAfter abandoning the CVnCoV trial, CureVac retooled the vaccine to create CV2nCoV. The new version triggers the production of more spike proteins in cells, leading to a stronger immune response. In November 2021, researchers at Harvard published a study in the journal Nature showing that monkeys given CV2CoV produced antibodies to the coronavirus at a level comparable to the Comirnaty vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech. In the Phase 1 clinical trial, researchers will evaluate CV2CoV as a booster shot. The researchers dosed the first participant on March 30, 2022. Preclinical studies suggest that the vaccine is effective against emerging variants, the companies said in April 2022.\n\nPHASE 1\n\nResearchers at the University of Melbourne are testing an mRNA vaccine in a Phase 1 trial. In the trial, which was registered on March 9, 2022, the researchers plan to measure antibody levels produced in volunteers who have already received two doses and a booster shot of widely used vaccines. The university is also testing a protein-based vaccine.\n\nPHASE 1\n\nChinese researchers at CanSino Biologics have also developed an mRNA vaccine against the coronavirus. Preclinical studies have shown that the vaccine stimulates antibody production against emerging variants. On April 4, 2022, CanSino announced that it had received approval from the Chinese government to begin clinical trials.\n\nPHASE 1\n\nJiangsu Rec-Biotechnology, a Chinese biotechnology company, registered a Phase 1 trial for an mRNA vaccine called RH109 on April 28, 2022. They will test the vaccine as a booster on 24 participants.\n\nPHASE 1\n\nShanghai RNACure Biopharma, a Chinese biotechnology company, registered a two-part Phase 1 clinical trial on May 31, 2022. The company has developed a number of mRNA molecules as potential vaccines for Covid. Some coax cells to make virus-like particles. Others only encode the spike protein on the surface of the coronavirus. For their clinical trials, RNACure is collaborating with Walvax to test a spike-producing vaccine called RQ3013. The spike protein produced by RQ3013 gives animals immunity to a range of variants. In the clinical trial, RNACure will test two doses of the vaccine on volunteers who have not been vaccinated before and will also give it to vaccinated volunteers as a booster. They will compare RQ3013 to the Comirnaty vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech.\n\nPHASE 1\n\nResearchers at the University of Adelaide are developing a DNA-based booster vaccine to fight against the Omicron variant. The creators say that using DNA allows them to quickly configure the vaccine for future variants. On Aug. 16, 2022, PharmaJet said that its needle-free delivery technology is being used in ongoing human trials for the Adelaide vaccine.\n\nPHASE 1\n\nVaccine name: CV0501\n\nAfter its initial vaccine failed in trials, CureVac and GSK started a new trial of a version they called CV2nCoV in early 2022. But the companies went on to make a second round of updates, producing a new vaccine called CV0501. On Aug. 18, 2022, they announced that they were launching a Phase 1 trial of CV0501 as a booster.\n\nABANDONED\n\nThe South Korean company Genexine started testing the safety of a DNA-based vaccine early in the pandemic, but a series of disappointments soon put them behind other developers. In December 2020, the Korea Biomedical Review reported that Genexine got disappointing results from their initial formulation and decided to restart their trials with a modified vaccine.\n\nOn Jan. 20, 2021, the company registered a Phase 1/2 trial, and in June they registered a Phase 1 trial specifically for elderly volunteers. The Indonesian pharmaceutical company Kalbe Farma pledged in April to buy 10 million doses of Genexine’s vaccine if it was proven to be safe and effective. In July, Indonesian regulators gave the green light for a late-stage clinical trial. Genexine registered a Phase 2/3 clinical trial in October to test their vaccine as a booster for other vaccines.\n\nBut their clinical trials proved disappointing once more. Results from the Phase 1/2 trial suggested that the vaccine, called GX-19N, would need improvement to be competitive with other vaccines. By March 2022, the company decided that it could not justify continuing its trials when authorized Covid vaccines were already so accessible in many countries. Genexine announced on March 11 that it was abandoning further development of GX-19N.\n\nABANDONED\n\nIn early 2020, Imperial College London researchers developed a “self-amplifying” RNA vaccine for Covid-19, which boosted production of a viral protein to stimulate the immune system. They began Phase 1/2 trials on June 15, partnering with Morningside Ventures to manufacture and distribute the vaccine through a new company called VacEquity Global Health. On Dec. 18, the researchers announced a collaboration with Enesi Pharma to formulate a solid version of the vaccine that can be implanted in the skin without a needle.\n\nOn Jan. 27, 2021, Robin Shattuck, the leader of the project, announced that “it is not the right time to start a new efficacy trial for a further vaccine in the U.K.” Instead of competing with authorized vaccines, they turned their efforts to making candidates that will work well against emerging variants of the coronavirus.\n\nA year later, the researchers published the final results from the trial. They found that the self-amplifying RNA platform was safe and promising, but the vaccine couldn’t generate a promising immune response.\n\nABANDONED\n\nThe French pharmaceutical company Sanofi collaborated with Massachusetts-based Translate Bio to develop an mRNA vaccine for Covid-19. In 2020, they reported that the vaccine, MRT5500, produced a strong antibody response in mice and monkeys, and protected hamsters against coronavirus infections. They followed up on that research with a Phase 1/2 trial in March 2021. Over the summer, Sanofi acquired Translate Bio for $3 billion. On Sept. 28, the company announced that the clinical trial had yielded encouraging early results. By then, however, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were widely available, and so Sanofi decided to pull the plug on its own mRNA Covid-19 vaccine program. Meanwhile, it continued a Phase 3 trial on a protein-based vaccine that may serve as a booster against Covid-19.\n\nABANDONED\n\nVaccine name: CVnCoV\n\nEfficacy: 48%\n\nDose: 2 doses, 4 weeks apart\n\nType: Muscle injection\n\nStorage: Stable at least 3 months at 36–46°F (2–8°C)\n\nThe German company CureVac generated a lot of hope for its mRNA vaccine for Covid-19 in 2020, only to see it deliver disappointing results in clinical trials the following year.\n\nThe company, founded in 2001, had years of experience developing experimental mRNA vaccines for a host of diseases. In early 2020, they began work on a Covid-19 vaccine, called CVnCoV. In March, the Trump administration unsuccessfully tried to entice CureVac to move its research on their mRNA vaccine from Germany to the United States.\n\nThe company plowed ahead with its work in Germany, seeing responses to the vaccine in mice and monkeys before launching clinical trials in July. CVnCoV showed promise in several respects: it could remain stable in a refrigerator rather than a freezer, and preliminary studies suggested it would work well at a low dose, reducing its cost.\n\nIn December, CureVac launched a Phase 3 trial, recruiting up to 36,500 volunteers in Germany. The European Union began a rolling review in February, intended to speed up approval if the Phase 3 trial delivers positive results.\n\nMeanwhile, CureVac prepared for mass production of the vaccine. The company negotiated a deal to provide the European Union with up to 400 million doses of their vaccine. They projected manufacturing up to 300 million doses in 2021 and up to a billion doses the following year. Starting in January 2021, CureVac forged a series of partnerships with pharmaceutical giants Bayer, Celonic, GSK, and Novartis, to support the production of their vaccine and develop new ones against coronavirus variants.\n\nIn June 2021, CureVac reported disappointing results from their Phase 3 trial. Overall, CVnCoV had an efficacy of just 48 percent against Covid-19. It proved somewhat better for younger volunteers: For those between the ages of 18 and 60, the efficacy rose to 53 percent. In that group, the researchers also found the vaccine provided 100 percent protection against hospitalization and death. Researchers later pointed to the vaccine dosage along with the rise of new variants as potential reasons for the low efficacy. On Sept. 14, CureVac announced that it had canceled its manufacturing deals with Celonic and German company Wacker, citing a decline in demand for CVnCoV.\n\nDespite the disappointing results, the company moved ahead with preparing an application to the European Union for emergency authorization for the use of the vaccine in people 60 and under. But European regulators gave no indication they would continue speeding along their review. As a result, on Oct. 12, CureVac announced that it would withdraw CVnCoV from the regulatory approval process. The company is now testing a new version of their vaccine, called CV2CoV.\n\nABANDONED\n\nNew Jersey-based OncoSec Immunotherapies has developed experimental cancer treatments that deliver genes into tumors. There, the injected genes produce a natural signaling molecule called IL-12, which attracts the attention of immune cells that attack the cancer. In the spring of 2020, OncoSec began adapting their technology to make a vaccine for the coronavirus. The vaccine, called CORVax12, consisted of a loop of DNA that encodes both the spike protein and IL-12. OncoSec researchers hoped that by causing the body to make extra IL-12, the vaccine would enhance the immune system’s ability to make antibodies to the spike protein. On Jan. 27, 2021, the company began dosing participants in its Phase 1 trial to test the safety of CORVax12. In November, a spokeswoman said that OncoSec was no longer investigating the vaccine.\n\nViral Vector Vaccines\n\nVaccines that contain viruses engineered to carry coronavirus genes. Some viral vector vaccines enter cells and cause them to make viral proteins. Other viral vectors slowly replicate, carrying coronavirus proteins on their surface.\n\nPHASE 3\n\nAPPROVED IN RUSSIA EMERGENCY USE IN MANY COUNTRIES\n\nVaccine name: Sputnik V (also known as Gam-Covid-Vac)\n\nEfficacy: 91.6% against Alpha Variant, 75% against Omicron.\n\nDose: 2 doses, 3 weeks apart\n\nType: Muscle injection\n\nStorage: Freezer storage. Developing an alternative formulation that can be refrigerated.\n\nThe Gamaleya Research Institute, part of Russia’s Ministry of Health, has created a vaccine with an efficacy rate of 91.6 percent. Russia began distributing the vaccine, known as Sputnik V, in fall 2020, and it is now widely used around the world. On Feb. 4, 2022, Sputnik V receivedfull approval from the Russian government. Tass reported in August 2022 that 400 million doses had been distributed to 71 countries.\n\nVACCINE DEVELOPMENTGamaleya produced the vaccine, initially called Gam-Covid-Vac, from a combination of two adenoviruses called Ad5 and Ad26. Both kinds have been tested as vaccines over a number of years. By combining them, the Russian researchers hoped to prevent the immune system from recognizing one of the adenoviruses from the first dose and destroy it in the second dose.\n\nTRIAL RESULTSThe researchers launched clinical trials in June 2020. Within a few months, the trial became bogged down in controversy. On Aug. 11, President Vladimir V. Putin announced that a Russian health care regulator had approved the vaccine, renamed Sputnik V, despite the fact that the Phase 3 trials had not even begun. Vaccine experts decried the move as risky, and Russia later walked back the announcement, saying that the approval was a “conditional registration certificate,” which would depend on positive results from Phase 3 trials.\n\nOn Nov. 11, 2020, the Russian Direct Investment Fund announced the first preliminary evidence from their Phase 3 trial indicating that the vaccine was effective. Based on 20 cases of Covid-19 among the trial participants, Russian scientists estimated that the vaccine demonstrated 92 percent efficacy.\n\nBy December, the trial had reached its final total of 78 cases. The creators of the vaccine published the results of their Phase 3 trial on Feb. 2, 2021 in the Lancet.\n\nWhen other countries began using Sputnik V, they ran studies of their own to measure the effectiveness of the vaccine. On Nov. 1, 2021, a team of researchers in Argentina published a paper showing that the vaccine reduces infection by 88.1 percent and Covid-19-related deaths by 98.3 percent in people over 60.\n\nIn January 2021, Gamaleya researchers started a trial in which they gave people only the first dose of Ad26 adenoviruses, the same adenovirus in Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose vaccine. They dubbed this one-dose version “Sputnik Light.” A Phase 1/2 trial showed that a single dose produced antibodies and was safe; the details were eventually published in the Lancet in Nov. 2021.\n\nRussia announced on May 6 that Sputnik Light provided an efficacy of 79.4 percent but did not publish the details of the study or say how long the efficacy would last. After the single-dose version of the vaccine was rolled out in Argentina, a study found that its effectiveness there was between 78.6 and 83.7 percent.\n\nPhase 2 human trials for an intranasal version of Sputnik V have begun, Tass reported on Feb. 15, 2022.\n\nRussian researchers are also working on modifying the vaccine for use in teenagers. Called “Sputnik M,” the candidate is a fractional dose of Sputnik V. They have recruited 3,000 adolescents for the ongoing clinical trials. On June 14, 2022, 14 children between 9 and 11 received one-tenth of an adult dose as part of a clinical trial.\n\nAUTHORIZATIONIn November 2020, the Russian government began offering Sputnik V within Russia in a mass vaccination campaign. But worry that the vaccine was rushed to approval led to widespread hesitancy. Sputnik Light received authorization for use in Russia on May 6, 2021.\n\nOn Dec. 22, 2020, Belarus became the first country outside of Russia to register Sputnik V, and since then a number of other countries have followed suit. But as of August 2022, neither the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization had yet to accept Russia’s application for an emergency authorization. In June 2022, Tass reported that Sputnik had not been produced for months.\n\nVARIANTSThe Gamaleya Institute announced on Oct. 13, 2021, that Sputnik Light demonstrated a 70 percent efficacy against the Delta variant. Tass reported on Jan. 18, 2022 that the Gamelaya Institute director said Sputnik V demonstrates around 75 percent efficacy against the Omicron variant, but the data supporting this conclusion have not yet been released. On July 26, Tass reported that the Gamelaya Institute director said Sputnik V can protect against B.A.2.75, though no data has been released yet, either. Tass said on Aug. 23 that researchers have made another version of Sputnik V to fight against the Delta and Omicron variants.\n\nFor more details, see How Gamaleya’s Vaccine Works.\n\nApproved for use in: Russia.\n\nEmergency use in: Albania, Algeria, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina (including Sputnik Light), Armenia (including Sputnik Light), Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus (including Sputnik Light), Benin (Sputnik Light), Bolivia, Bosnian Serb Republic, Brazil, Cambodia (including Sputnik Light), Cameroon, Chile, Congo Republic (including Sputnik Light), Djibouti, Ecuador, Egypt (including Sputnik Light), Honduras, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea, Guyana, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iran (including Sputnik Light), Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan (including Sputnik Light), Kenya, Kyrgyzstan (including Sputnik Light), Laos (including Sputnik Light), Lebanon, Libya, Maldives, Mali, Mauritius (including Sputnik Light), Mexico, Moldova, Mongolia (including Sputnik Light), Montenegro, Morocco, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua (including Sputnik Light), Nigeria, North Macedonia, Oman, Pakistan, Palestinian Authority (including Sputnik Light), Panama, Paraguay, Philippines (including Sputnik Light), Russia (including Sputnik Light and Sputnik M), Rwanda, San Marino (including Sputnik Light), Serbia, Seychelles, Slovakia, Sri Lanka, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Syria, Tunisia (including Sputnik Light), Turkey, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates (including Sputnik Light), Uzbekistan, Venezuela (including Sputnik Light), Vietnam, West Bank, Zimbabwe.\n\nPHASE 2 PHASE 3 COMBINED PHASES\n\nAPPROVED IN BRAZIL, INDIA EMERGENCY USE IN E.U., ELSEWHERE\n\nVaccine name: Vaxzevria (also known as AZD1222, or Covishield in India)\n\nEfficacy: 74% against symptomatic Covid19; 100% against severe or critical Covid-19.\n\nDose: 2 doses\n\nType: Muscle injection\n\nStorage: Stable in refrigerator for at least 6 months\n\nA vaccine designed by the University of Oxford and produced by the British-Swedish company AstraZeneca emerged as a key element in the effort to meet the global demand for Covid-19 vaccines. With an efficacy of 76 percent, the vaccine — now known as Vaxzevria —was produced in vast quantities at a low price. Because it only needs to be refrigerated rather than frozen, it can be used far more widely than mRNA vaccines. But Vaxzevria’s journey has been turbulent, jolted by confusing messages from AstraZeneca, high-profile worries about safety, and difficulties with manufacturing.\n\nOver the course of 2021, 2.5 billion doses of Vaxzevria were distributed worldwide. An independent study estimated that the vaccine saved six million lives through December 2021. But in 2022, as supplies of other vaccines grew, the demand for Vaxzevria fell, leading some manufacturers to halt production.\n\nVACCINE DEVELOPMENTVaxzevria was based on a vaccine platform that Oxford researchers had been developing for years for other diseases. They began with an adenovirus that normally infects chimpanzees and genetically engineered it to carry viral genes. In early 2020, the scientists developed Vaxzevria by endowing the adenovirus with the spike gene from the coronavirus. When they gave the vaccine to monkeys, they found that it protected the animals from the disease.\n\nTRIAL RESULTSThe United States supported the development of Vaxzevria in May 2020, with $1.2 billion provided as part of Operation Warp Speed. The money helped AstraZeneca and Oxford embark on large late-stage trials in the United States, United Kingdom, South Africa, and elsewhere. But the researchers ran the trials independently, making it difficult to combine their results into a single clear picture of how well the vaccine worked. Making matters murkier, they gave different amounts of the vaccine to different people and also waited anywhere from four to twelve weeks to deliver the second dose.\n\nOn Dec. 8, 2020, AstraZeneca and Oxford published the first scientific paper on a Phase 3 clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine. The trial demonstrated that the vaccine can protect people from Covid-19, but it left many questions unresolved about the results. Nevertheless, the vaccine’s low cost and ease of storage made it attractive to countries looking for a way out of the pandemic.\n\nOn Feb. 14, 2021, AstraZeneca announced they would start trials on children as young as six. Researchers at Oxford reported preliminary results suggesting that a combination of AstraZeneca’s vaccine followed by Comirnaty produces strong levels of antibodies. AstraZeneca also launched a similar trial with Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine. Results from that study suggest that the combination yielded at least a four-fold increase in antibodies in 85 percent of participants. In September 2021, Imperial College London launched a trial of an inhaled form of the vaccine. Brazilian researchers registered a Phase 2/3 trial on Sept. 28 to evaluate the effectiveness of a half dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine compared to the normal dosing scheme. A fourth dose of AstraZeneca is being tested in Israel to gauge its effectiveness against the Omicron variant.\n\nAUTHORIZATIONThe United Kingdom and Argentina were the first countries to give the vaccine emergency authorization, on Dec. 30, 2020. On Jan. 3, India issued an emergency authorization to a version called Covishield, made by the Serum Institute of India. It granted Covishield full approval just over a year later on Jan. 27, 2022 . On Feb. 16, 2021 the World Health Organization recommended Vaxzevria for emergency use in adults 18 or older. Brazil gave full approval to the vaccine on March 13, 2021.\n\nIn the summer of 2020, Astrazeneca promised it would distribute Vaxzevria in the United States as soon as that October. But a concern about the health of a volunteer in the U.S. clinical trial stalled the study for seven weeks. AstraZeneca did not deliver the results of the trial until March 2021 — only to be rebuked by its expert advisors for cherry-picking data. These speed bumps slowed the company down, while other vaccines were getting authorized and meeting the demand in the United States. By spring 2022, AstraZeneca had abandoned its plan to apply to the F.D.A.\n\nDISTRIBUTIONVaxzevria promised at first to be a cheap, robust vaccine that would go a long way to meeting the world’s need for protection from Covid-19. But it has suffered a number of setbacks.\n\nEven while it was running clinical trials in 2020, AstraZeneca reached agreements with a number of manufacturers in order to produce billions of doses of Vaxzevria. But in January 2021, it admitted that it would fall short of its promised delivery of vaccines to the European Union. Its shortfall grew only worse in March when India, facing an explosion of new cases, blocked export of the vaccine from its factories. On April 26, the European Commission filed a lawsuit against the company for breach of contract. The court ordered AstraZeneca on June 18 to deliver 50 million additional doses of Vaxzevria, substantially less than the 90 million the European Commission had demanded. AstraZeneca met the revised deadline on July 26. In September, AstraZeneca and the European Commission settled their dispute, with an agreement for the company to supply 200 million doses by March 2022.\n\nIn the spring of 2021, as other countries struggled with devastating new waves of Covid-19, the United States came under intense criticism for holding back raw materials India needed to make its own supply of Covishield. On April 25, the Biden administration announced it would partially lift its ban. Later, it promised to distribute AstraZeneca vaccines to other countries. But due to concerns about the facility where the vaccines were made in Baltimore, the vaccines were held back for nearly one year, until the F.D.A. said in February 2022 that it had cleared them for shipment.\n\nIn South Africa, a small trial failed to demonstrate that it protected people against the Beta variant, which had become predominant in the country. On Feb. 7, 2021, South Africa halted plans for a rollout of 1 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and switched to Johnson & Johnson.\n\nIn March 2021, Covax began delivering doses of the vaccine to low- and middle-income countries. But manufacturing bottlenecks have slowed the pipeline. Declining demand for the vaccine pushed the Serum Institute of India to halve its production of new Vaxzevria shots, Reuters reported on Dec. 8. The Serum Institute announced that it would halt production on April 22, 2022.\n\nOn April 11, 2022, Japan announced that it would not purchase 40 million of the 120 million doses it agreed to buy last year, citing lower demand.\n\nConcerns over Vaxzevria’s short shelf life have also pushed some countries to decline millions of doses of the vaccine.\n\nVARIANTSAs variants emerged in 2021, Vaxzevria proved more vulnerable than vaccines from Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech. A British study found that the AstraZeneca vaccine provided 67 percent effectiveness against infection with the Delta variant. A Canadian study found that it had an effectiveness of 87 percent against hospitalization and death from the variant. British researchers found that Vaxzevria offered less protection against Omicron. Vaxzevria was only 4o percent effective against infection within three months of vaccination, and its effectiveness disappeared completely after six months.\n\nAstraZeneca and Oxford created a version of the vaccine tailored to the Beta variant and launched a Phase 2/3 trial to test it. But on Feb. 10, 2022, AstraZeneca announced that the Beta vaccine provided no greater efficacy against the Omicron variant, leading them to abandon it.\n\nBOOSTERSIn June, Oxford researchers reported that a third booster of the AstraZeneca vaccine generated strong immune responses in volunteers. On Dec. 3, 2021, Bloomberg reported that AstraZeneca was scrapping its plans for a booster trial in the United States, and encouraged trial participants to seek a different vaccine for their third shot.\n\nSIDE EFFECTSIn March 2021, European medical regulators became concerned about a small number of cases of blood clots in younger people who received Vaxzevria. The European Medicines Agency concluded that the vaccine had a very rare side effect in which people suffered blood clots in large veins combined with low platelets. The regulators emphasized that the vaccine is effective and the benefits it provided outweighed the small risk of its side effects. In response some countries chose to minimize the risk by restricting the vaccine to older people. In May, Norway permanently removed Vaxzevria from their vaccination program. In August, a team of British researchers reported that the risk of blood clots is far higher from Covid-19 than from the Vaxzevria vaccine.\n\nFor more details, see How the Oxford-AstraZeneca Vaccine Works.\n\nApproved for use in: Brazil, India.\n\nStopped use in: Denmark, Norway.\n\nEmergency use in: Albania, Algeria, Angola, Anguilla, Antigua, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Barbuda, Belize, Bermuda, Bhutan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Comoros, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Estonia, Eswatini, Ethiopia, European Union, Fiji, Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Greenland, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kosovo, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Liechtenstein, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritius, Mexico, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Montserrat, Morocco, Myanmar, Namibia, Nauru, Nepal, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Palestinian Authority, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, San Martin, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Africa, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, South Sudan, Sudan, Suriname, Taiwan, Tajikistan, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Tuvalu, Uganda, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, Vietnam, Virgin Islands, Yemen, Zambia.

The one-shot vaccine, based on an adenovirus called Ad5, was approved in China in February 2021. The World Health Organization granted Convidecia emergency use listing in May 2022.\n\nCanSino researchers published promising results from a Phase 1 safety trial on Convidecia in May 2020, and in July they reported that their Phase 2 trials demonstrated the vaccine produced a strong immune response. In an unprecedented move, the Chinese military approved the vaccine on June 25 for a year as a “specially needed drug.” On Nov. 28, the Chief Executive of CanSino Biologics said in an interview that about 40,000 to 50,000 people had received Convidecia.\n\nStarting in August 2020, CanSino began running Phase 3 trials in a number of countries, including Pakistan, Russia, Mexico and Chile. On Feb. 25, 2021, China announced the approval of the CanSino vaccine for general use.\n\nResults from the Phase 3 trial, published in The Lancet in December 2021, showed that Convidecia had an efficacy against Covid-19 of 57.5 percent. Against severe disease, its efficacy was 91.7 percent.\n\nAs time passed, it became clear that Convidecia’s effectiveness was waning, and researchers began testing boosters. In January 2022, Chinese researchers reported that an inhaled booster of Convidecia was safe and produced very high levels of antibodies against the coronavirus when administered in individuals who originally received a different vaccine. In Argentina, researchers are evaluating how well Convidecia works as a booster in individuals who have received Sputnik V.\n\nApproved for use in: China.\n\nEmergency use in: Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Hungary, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Moldova, Pakistan, Paraguay. Emergency use validation from the World Health Organization.\n\nPHASE 3\n\nAPPROVED IN CANADA EMERGENCY USE IN U.S., OTHER COUNTRIES\n\nVaccine name: Ad26.COV2.S\n\nEfficacy: 72% in United States, 68% in Brazil and 64% in South Africa\n\nDose: 1 dose\n\nType: Muscle injection\n\nStorage: Up to two years frozen at –4° F (–20° C), and up to 6 months refrigerated at 36–46° F (2–8° C).\n\nOn Feb. 27, 2021, the F.D.A. issued an emergency use authorization for Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine, making it the third coronavirus vaccine available in the United States. It was also the first to be shown to be safe and effective with just one dose rather than two. But the vaccine has not lived up to its initial promise. The company was bedeviled by manufacturing problems, dashing hopes that it could be widely used in poor and lower-income countries, especially in Africa. And over time, rare blood clotting led the F.D.A. to restrict its use in the United States. On May 5, 2022, the agency announced that the vaccine would be limited to adults who cannot or refuse to get the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, citing safety concerns.\n\nVACCINE DEVELOPMENTThe work that led to the vaccine started a decade ago at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, where researchers developed a method for making vaccines out of a virus called Adenovirus 26, or Ad26 for short. Johnson & Johnson used Ad26 to develop vaccines for Ebola and other diseases with Ad26. In January 2020, the company and Beth Israel researchers collaborated on creating a coronavirus vaccine. In March they received $456 million from the United States government to support their move towards production. That spring, researchers found that the vaccine provided protection in experiments on monkeys.\n\nTRIAL RESULTSJohnson & Johnson began Phase 1/2 trials in July 2020. Based on promising results in these studies, Johnson & Johnson launched a Phase 3 trial in September using just one dose rather than two. Although Johnson & Johnson initially set out to recruit 60,000 volunteers, it capped the trial at 45,000 in December as cases rose.\n\nOn Jan. 29, 2021, Johnson & Johnson announced that the trial had proven that the vaccine was safe and effective, and the F.D.A. released a similar analysis on Feb. 24. Johnson & Johnson published a paper on the trial in the New England Journal of Medicine on April 21, 2021. With a single shot, the vaccine had an efficacy of 66 percent, although it varied from country to country, likely due to variants and other factors. Efficacy against severe disease was higher, at 76 percent.\n\nResults from a trial in which the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was given six months after a two-dose regimen of Comirnaty showed that the mix-and-match approach significantly boosted immune responses.\n\nIn a final analysis of the Phase 3 trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Feb. 9, 2022, the researchers determined that the vaccine was 56.3 percent effective against moderate to severe disease, and that the effectiveness dropped to 52.9 percent after four weeks.\n\nLater studies have also demonstrated that the vaccine’s effectiveness was waning. Results from a French trial among more than one million older adults, published on March 2, 2022, suggests that individuals who receive the Johnson & Johnson vaccine are five times more likely to be hospitalized from Covid-19 than those who receive Comirnaty.\n\nAUTHORIZATIONBahrain became the first country to authorize the vaccine for emergency use on Feb. 25. Two days later, the United States followed suit. South Africa dropped plans to use AstraZeneca’s vaccine for their health care workers after a small trial failed to show it was effective against the Beta variant that had grown dominant across the country. They began using Johnson & Johnson’s instead. On Oct. 15, an F.D.A. panel unanimously voted to recommend a second dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for all adults who received a first dose, and authorization came on Oct. 20. On Nov. 24, Canada became the first country to give full approval to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for adults.\n\nDISTRIBUTIONIn August 2020, the federal government agreed to pay Johnson & Johnson $1 billion for 100 million doses if the vaccine was authorized. Most of the U.S. supply was supposed to be made by Baltimore-based Emergent Solutions. But the company struggled to get the vaccine’s complex manufacturing up and running. In April 2021, the F.D.A. issued a scathing report about the company’s lax standards. At least 15 million doses of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine were contaminated at the factory. As a result, the company only delivered 4 million doses to the United States after authorization, shipping them from its factory in the Netherlands. On June 11, the New York Times reported that the F.D.A. told the company to throw out 60 million doses. The following month, Emergent announced that it would resume production of the vaccines from its Baltimore plant after it receives authorization from the F.D.A. On March 2, 2021, Merck announced it would assist Johnson & Johnson with manufacturing the vaccine, but it’s not clear how much that partnership helped in the production. By the time the F.D.A. limited the use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, only 16.9 million people in the United States had received it. Over ten times more people had received a vaccine from Pfizer or Moderna.\n\nThe European Union reached a deal on Oct. 8, 2020 for 200 million doses. But after concerns about rare blood clots emerged, reports surfaced that the E.U. might not renew its contract with the company.\n\nA coalition of African countries announced on March 29, 2021, that it had secured up to 400 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine through 2022. COVAX, an international collaboration to deliver the vaccine equitably across the world, announced a separate deal for 500 million doses. But manufacturing problems slowed these deliveries. By September, COVAX had lowered its 2021 forecast of Johnson & Johnson vaccines to only 180 million doses. On Nov. 30, South African company Aspen Pharmacare said that it was finalizing a deal with Johnson & Johnson to market and distribute the vaccine in Africa. In March 2022, the South African company Aspen Pharmacare announced that it had signed the agreement with Johnson & Johnson to distribute the vaccine, dubbed Aspenovax, throughout Africa. But the following month the company said it might have to shut down its Aspenovax factory because it had yet to receive any orders for Aspenovax from African nationals.\n\nVARIANTSJohnson & Johnson found that its vaccine only had an efficacy of 52 percent in South Africa, where the Beta variant was dominant during the trial. As the Delta variant emerged in the summer of 2021, Johnson & Johnson released results of experiments indicating that their vaccine provided durable protection against it. But another study from outside scientists suggested that the vaccine only weakly protects against Delta. Preliminary experiments found that Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine does not produce neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron variant.\n\nBOOSTERSOn Oct. 5, Johnson & Johnson applied for emergency authorization for a booster. Over the following few weeks, the F.D.A. reviewed the results of two studies that suggest a second dose of the vaccine might provide an effective boost to immunity.\n\nIn one study, the company gave 17 trial volunteers a booster shot six months after their initial vaccination. On Aug. 25, the company announced that the boosters lifted levels of antibodies against the coronavirus nine times higher than their initial peak. Later, those levels rose twelvefold.\n\nIn a second study, Johnson & Johnson ran a Phase 3 trial in which 32,000 volunteers received either a placebo or two doses of the vaccine, separated by eight weeks. On Sept. 21, the company reported that the pair of shots provided much higher efficacy than just one. In the United States, efficacy against mild to severe Covid-19 rose from 74 percent to 94 percent. Efficacy against severe disease worldwide rose to 100 percent. On Oct. 20, the F.D.A. authorized Johnson & Johnson boosters.\n\nSIDE EFFECTSOn April 13, 2021, the U.S. government recommended a pause in using the vaccine while it investigated reports of rare blood clots. Ten days later, C.D.C. researchers reported 15 cases of the unusual clots in nearly 8 million people who received the vaccine. The government decided to lift the pause and add a warning to the vaccine that younger women may run a slight risk of the severe side effect. But as cases continued to accrue, the C.D.C.’s advisory committee voted on Dec. 16., 2021, to recommend that other vaccines be preferred over Johnson & Johnson’s. In May 2022, the F.D.A. reported nine deaths due to blood clotting and limited the vaccine’s use.\n\nFor more details, see How the Johnson & Johnson Vaccine Works.\n\nApproved for use in: Canada.\n\nStopped use in: Denmark, Finland, Slovenia.\n\nEmergency use in: Andorra, Australia, Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, European Union, Ghana, Gabon, Greenland, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran, Jamaica, Kenya, Kuwait, Libya, Liechtenstein, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Mexico, Micronesia, Moldova, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Rwanda, South Africa, South Korea, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sudan, Switzerland, Syria, Tanzania, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States, Vietnam, Zambia, Zimbabwe.

Endorsed by the Africa Regulatory Taskforce.\n\nPHASE 3\n\nIn 2019, researchers at the University of Hong Kong and Xiamen University created a nasal-spray vaccine for the flu based on a genetically weakened form of the influenza virus. In early 2020, they engineered the vaccine to produce part of the coronavirus spike protein as well. On Sept. 9, they received approval to start clinical trials in partnership with Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy. They registered a Phase 1 trial on March 22, 2021. At a June 11 press conference, a researcher for the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said that this vaccine has completed Phase 2 trials. And on Sept. 22, the researchers registered a Phase 3 trial. In January 2022, the University of Hong Kong registered a new trial to test the vaccine as a booster. The researchers are receiving $5.4 million in support from CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.\n\nPHASE 3\n\nIn 2020, researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York developed a Covid-19 vaccine based on a virus called Newcastle Disease Virus, or NDV for short. NDV is a bird pathogen and does not cause symptoms in humans. The researchers engineered NDV to carry the gene for a modified version of the coronavirus spike protein called HexaPro, developed at the University of Texas. They then grew the modified virus in chicken eggs. The researchers inactivated the NDVs with chemicals and combined them with immune-boosting chemicals called adjuvants. The researchers found that the vaccine, called NDV-HXP-S, produced high levels of coronavirus antibodies in mice and hamsters. They published the results of their experiments in November.\n\nNDV-HXP-S could potentially help low- to middle-income countries secure their own supplies of Covid-19 vaccines. The Newcastle Disease Virus can be safely grown in large quantities in chicken eggs, the same way influenza vaccines have been produced since the 1950s. As a result, the vaccine could be very cheap to make. Those advantages attracted interest from four countries, all of which licensed the vaccine and launched trials. But as of August 2022, the trials had either been abandoned or had yet to deliver final results.\n\nIn Thailand, Mahidol University and the Government Pharmaceutical Organization, a state-run drug manufacturer licensed the vaccine and launched clinical trials in February 2021. The Phase 1 trial results showed that the vaccine showed an acceptable safety profile and produced promising levels of antibodies. A Phase 2 trial started in August.\n\nAvi-Mex in Mexico also licensed NDV-HXP-S under the name Patria, which the company delivers as a nasal spray, Preliminary results from the Phase 1 trial, released in February 2022, suggest that the vaccine is safe. The company registered a Phase 2 trial in January 2022, with a primary completion date of April 2022. As of August 2022, however, the company had not reported the results of the trial, nor had they registered a Phase 3 trial.\n\nIn June, Brazil’s Butantan Institute launched a Phase 1 trial of the vaccine, known there as Butanvac. On April 29, 2022, the institute registered a Phase 2/3 trial. But in July 2022, Globo reported that the trial had not yet been authorized to proceed.\n\nMeanwhile, the Institute of Vaccines and Medical Biologicals in Vietnam launched trials of its own, dubbing the vaccine Covivac. In August they advanced to Phase 2 trials. In January 2022, the institute announced that the vaccine was safe and produced better antibody levels than the AstraZeneca vaccine. Some of the results of the trial were published in June 2022. But the Institute has decided against advancing Covivac to Phase 3.\n\nIn March 2022, researchers at Mt. Sinai launched a Phase 1 trial to study NDV-HXP-S as a booster for people vaccinated with other vaccines.\n\nPHASE 2 PHASE 3 COMBINED PHASES\n\nThe Italian biotechnology company ReiThera has developed a Covid-19 vaccine, called GRAd-COV2, that is based on an adenovirus that infects gorillas. Working in collaboration with the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome, they found that it produced strong levels of antibodies in mice and monkeys. In July 2020, they launched a Phase 1 clinical trial. In November, they announced that the vaccine was well tolerated and produced antibodies, and released a report on the trial.\n\nIn March 2021, researchers launched a Phase 2 trial of the vaccine, which delivered encouraging results in July. But it remained unclear if ReiThera would be able to advance to a final Phase 3 trial.\n\nIn May, Reuters reported, a court in Italy struck down the government’s plan to fund the Phase 3 trial. The government later said it was ready to support the vaccine trial, but has yet to offer up the funds. In November 2021, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded ReiThera a grant of $1.4 million to continue to develop the vaccine.\n\nPHASE 2 PHASE 3 COMBINED PHASES\n\nResearchers at Washington University designed a nasal spray vaccine that can produce high levels of coronavirus antibodies in mice with just a single dose. It contains a chimpanzee adenovirus engineered to carry the spike protein gene. The Indian drug maker Bharat Biotech licensed the technology, and in February 2021 they won approval to launch a Phase 1 trial of a vaccine, which they named BBV154. The company started a Phase 2 trial in September 2021. On Jan. 28, 2022, it announced that it had received approval from India’s Drugs Controller General to conduct a Phase 3 trial for BBV154 as a booster; the trial began in March 2022. On Aug. 15, 2022, Bharat announced that it had completed the clinical development of BBV154 and had submitted its data to Indian regulators for authorization.\n\nPHASE 2\n\nResearchers at City of Hope, a California biomedical research institute, created a vaccine based on a weakened form of a virus called Modified Vaccinia Ankara, or MVA for short. They added two coronavirus genes to the MVA virus — one for the spike protein, and one for another protein called nucleocapsid. They are testing the vaccine, called COH04S1, specifically for people with immune systems impaired by cancer and other disorders. Many of them do not produce a strong immune response to authorized vaccines based on mRNA. The City of Hope researchers reasoned that COH04S1 might work better.\n\nCity of Hope launched a Phase 1 trial in November 2020, giving the vaccine to healthy volunteers. They found that COH04S1 was safe and produced a promising level of antibodies. The researchers moved on to a Phase 2 trial in September 2021, giving the vaccine to immunocompromised volunteers.\n\nOn Nov. 9, 2021, GeoVax announced that it has been granted exclusive rights to develop COH04S1, and market it worldwide. GeoVax dosed the first participant in a Phase 2 booster trial in December 2021.\n\nPHASE 2\n\nWhile many vaccines are given as injections, some vaccines can be taken as a pill. Oral vaccines have been approved for diseases including polio, cholera, and typhoid fever. The small San Francisco company Vaxart specializes in developing oral vaccines. They have created and tested pills for influenza and other diseases. Last spring Vaxart began work on an oral vaccine for Covid-19. It contains an adenovirus called Ad5 (the same viral vector in CanSinoBio’s vaccine and in Russia’s Sputnik V).\n\nWhen Vaxart gave the pill to mice, they produced antibodies against the coronavirus. Mice don’t suffer symptoms of Covid-19, however, so the researchers then switched to hamsters, which do. They found that the vaccine pill not only dramatically reduced the amount of coronavirus in sick hamsters, but also protected them from two important symptoms of the disease: weight loss and swollen lungs. More studies on monkeys released in February 2022 showed that the vaccine produced antibodies against a range of variants.\n\nThe company’s stock price increased 3,600 percent in the first half of 2020. In June, The New York Times reported, a hedge fund that partly controlled the company sold off most of its shares, netting over $200 million in profits. In the wake of that reporting, the Department of Justice began investigating the company, while a number of shareholder lawsuits were brought against Vaxart, its executives and its board.\n\nIn October 2020, the company began giving the pill to volunteers in a Phase 1 clinical trial. On Feb. 3, 2021, Vaxart announced that the trial revealed no serious safety concerns. While the pill produced a response from T cells, it didn’t produce encouraging neutralizing antibodies. Its stock price plunged 60 percent on the news.\n\nOn Feb. 25, 2021, the company announced it would advance to a Phase 2 trial in the second quarter of 2021, but manufacturing problems forced them to delay the launch.\n\nOn Oct. 5, Vaxart registered a Phase 2 trial. In the new study, the company is testing its pill as a primary vaccine on unvaccinated volunteers, and as a booster for people who have already received an authorized vaccine. The researchers dosed their first participant on Oct. 26. In May 2022, the company said they expected results in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nPHASE 2\n\nThe California-based company ImmunityBio created a vaccine using the Ad5 adenovirus, the same one used by CanSinoBio and the Gamaleya Institute in Russia. ImmunityBio engineered the Ad5 virus to carry genes for two genes from the coronavirus. In addition to the spike protein, it also carries the gene for a protein called nucleocapsid. The company hopes that this combination will provoke a strong immune response.\n\nThe company found that the vaccine protects monkeys from the coronavirus. ImmunityBio launched a Phase 1 trial of a Covid-19 vaccine in October 2020 in the United States and another in South Africa in January. In February 2021, the company registered a Phase 1 trial of an oral version of the vaccine.\n\nOn May 25, the company announced that it would study how well their candidate works as a booster shot for those who already received other vaccines. It said on Dec. 20 that Phase 2 trials of the booster are ongoing, and serious adverse effects have not been reported. Phase 3 trials could begin in early 2022. Researchers are also testing a nasal spray version.\n\nThe chairman, C.E.O. and Global Chief Scientific and Medical Officer of ImmunityBio is billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong, the owner of the Los Angeles Times.\n\nPHASE 1 PHASE 2 COMBINED PHASES\n\nIn April 2020, the South Korean biotech company Cellid began to develop a vaccine for Covid-19. The vaccine, called AdCLD-CoV19, was based on a combination of two strains of adenoviruses, called Ad5 and Ad35. After testing the vaccine on monkeys, Cellid entered into a partnership with the South Korean chemical manufacturer LG Chem to manufacture the vaccine.\n\nIn December 2020, Cellid registered a Phase 1 trial for AdCLD-CoV19, and a Phase 2 trial launched in June 2021. But the results were disappointing, leading the company to reformulate a new version of the vaccine, called AdCLD-CoV19-1.\n\nCellid finished administering the updated vaccine to Phase 1 volunteers in October 2021 and applied to run a Phase 2/3 trial the following month. At the time, a Cellid official told the Korean Biomedical Review that the company would compare the impacts of one and doses in the Phase 2 portion of the trial before moving to Phase 3. Cellid said on Aug. 8 that it decided to move the Phase 2 trial in Kenya and Tanzania after having difficulty finding eligible participants in Korea.\n\nPHASE 1 PHASE 2 COMBINED PHASES\n\nRussian biotechnology company BIOCAD has developed a vaccine that uses a type of virus known as an adenovirus-associated virus as a vector. The virus, called AAV-5, carries a gene encoding part of the spike protein from the coronavirus. They registered a Phase 1/2 trial for the vaccine, called BCD-250, on Sept. 8, 2021.\n\nPHASE 1\n\nThree decades ago, the German Center for Infection Research developed a smallpox vaccine from a harmless virus called Modified Vaccinia Ankara, or MVA for short. In recent years, they adapted it to create a vaccine for MERS, a disease caused by another coronavirus.\n\nIn the spring of 2020, they made an MVA-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that is causing the Covid-19 pandemic. It carries the gene for the spike protein, which is produced inside cells that it invades. On Sept. 29, 2020, the center and a consortium of German universities registered a Phase 1 trial. In January 2021, the center announced that their initial formulation provided disappointing results and had postponed the trial until they updated it. They said that they resumed the trial with an updated version of the vaccine on July 16, 2021, and completed the trial that August.\n\nThe researchers announced in November that they are evaluating an MVA-based vaccine in Phase 1 trials as a booster and in unvaccinated individuals. They registered the trial on Feb. 7, 2022.\n\nPHASE 1\n\nGritstone bio has developed experimental vaccines in recent years that teach the immune system to attack tumors. In 2020, they constructed a vaccine for Covid-19 that presents a number of targets in the coronavirus for the immune system to attack.\n\nThe researchers constructed a piece of DNA that encodes the entire spike protein of the coronavirus. In addition, it encodes instructions for building small pieces of other viral proteins called nucleocapsid and ORF3a. They then inserted this cassette into the genes of a chimpanzee adenovirus. The spike protein provokes the body to make antibodies, while the pieces of other proteins train the immune system to recognize infected cells and kill them.\n\nIn addition, the researchers created an RNA molecule with the same genetic instructions, which they put in a shell. Once the shell slips into a cell, the RNA molecule can make copies of itself, and the cell then makes proteins from those copies.\n\nIn a Phase 1 trial launched in March 2021, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is testing how well these two vaccines work together, with the chimpanzee adenovirus serving as the first dose and the self-amplifying mRNA as the second. The researchers hope that this combination will produce a better immune response than two doses of either vaccine. In a May 2022 company update, Gritstone bio said that its vaccine program was continuing.\n\nPHASE 1\n\nMeissa Vaccines has developed a vaccine that can be delivered as a spray or drops into the nose. To make the vaccine, researchers started off with another virus, called respiratory syncytial virus (RSV for short). The researchers introduced mutations into the RSV virus’s genes so that it replicated too slowly to cause disease. Then they added a gene for the coronavirus spike protein, so that the weakened RSV viruses could present it to the immune system. A study on monkeys released in July 2021 showed that the vaccine could produce antibodies in the noses of the animals and protect them from Covid-19. The initial data from a Phase 1 trial, announced Oct. 28, indicate that the vaccine can also produce high levels of antibodies against the coronavirus in people’s noses. The full results of the trial will be released in 2022. Meissa told Bloomberg News in April 2022 that it is testing the vaccine as a booster and plans to begin a trial in children. A representative from Meissa described the ongoing Phase 1 trial at a July 2022 White House vaccine summit.\n\nPHASE 1\n\nResearchers at Oklahoma-based Tetherex Pharmaceuticals have created a vaccine that uses genetically engineered viruses to develop immunity. They registered a Phase 1 trial in Australia on April 9, 2021. Mayo Clinic announced a deal to develop and market the vaccine technology worldwide on July 6. A spokesperson for Tetherex said on Jan. 18, 2022, that the trial remains ongoing. A change to the trial record from April"
