This is good for Thai industry,\" he said.\n\nThe government, which started mass vaccinations on Monday, aims to distribute 500,000 doses a day in order to achieve herd community.\n\nThe Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand (IEAT) is working with the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) to speed up the administration of Covid-19 jabs to workers in industrial estates.\n\nFTI vice-chairman Kriengkrai Thiennukul said earlier that the federation wanted a total of 1 million doses, however, it signed a memorandum of understanding with Chulabhorn Royal Academy to receive 300,000 doses.\n\nThe academy announced that it had procured Sinopharm as an alternative vaccine in addition to two main vaccines -- UK-developed AstraZeneca and China's Sinovac -- in the government's national vaccination scheme.\n\nEach Sinopharm dose is estimated to cost 1,000 baht with each employee requiring two doses.\n\nThe companies want to vaccinate their employees as a worker benefit, Mr Kriengkrai said.\n\nFTI is focusing on distributing Sinopharm vaccines following concerns about a vaccine shortage under the state vaccination scheme. The vaccines are expected to be imported into Thailand between June 15 and June 20.\n\n\"IEAT will use the first floor of its Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate office as a vaccination venue,\" said IEAT governor Veeris Ammarapala.\n\nThe office is a good location as it is near Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn Memorial Hospital.\n\nThe vaccinations will run from 8am to 6pm, said Mr Veeris.\n\nSo far 25,000 workers have registered to receive the vaccine through IEAT."
