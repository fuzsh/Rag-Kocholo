The ministry said the use of the vaccine is subject to the exclusion of certain persons during phase one of the vaccine campaign as provided in the manufacturer information package. The groups of people to be excluded during phase one of vaccination will include children or young people under the age of 18 years, pregnant or breastfeeding women or women planning a pregnancy within the next six weeks. A second dose will not be administered to anyone who is confirmed by a health professional to have experienced a mild or severe allergic reaction from the first dose of the vaccine. People with a history of any type of serious allergy (anaphylaxis) requiring emergency care, conditions that suppress the immune system (e.g HIV- AIDS on steroid medication or receiving chemotherapy), uncontrolled epilepsy or other neurologic conditions, uncontrolled chronic conditions like diabetes or hypertension, uncontrolled heart failure, late-stage kidney disease and those with uncontrolled asthma will also be excluded. The ministry emphasised that the exclusions listed are subject to change as more information comes to light. Namibia has been informed that the WHO is currently evaluating the dossier submitted by manufacturers of the Sinopharm vaccine and the results are expected soon."
