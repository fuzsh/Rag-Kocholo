        "text": "Port of Spain: 30th June, 2021\n\nTrinidad and Tobago received 5000 doses of WHO-approved Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccines from fellow CARICOM Member State Antigua and Barbuda on the evening of 30th June, 2021. The vaccines were shared by the Government of Antigua and Barbuda due to what that country forecast as its inability to utilise their stock of available vaccines at this time. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago extends its appreciation to the Government of Antigua and Barbuda for this donation, which will be used by the Ministry of Health in our vaccine rollout programme\n\nMinistry of Foreign and CARICOM Affairs"
