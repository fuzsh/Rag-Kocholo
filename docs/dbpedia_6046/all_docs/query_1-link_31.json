This study evaluated the side effects of Sinopharm and AstraZeneca vaccines in MS patients.\n\nMethods: In this cross-sectional study among MS patients in Kermanshah province, Iran, who received Sinopharm or AstraZeneca vaccine, sampling was performed through convenience sampling according to the nationwide MS registry of Iran (NMSRI). Demographic and clinical information of the participants and data on the side effects of vaccines were collected by telephone after the first dose. The data were analyzed in SPSS software.\n\nResults: 264 vaccinated MS patients (217 with Sinopharm and 47 with AstraZeneca) were studied. In the Sinopharm and AstraZeneca groups, respectively, 58.5% and 73.3% of patients had side effects that were not significantly different between the 2 groups (P = 0.064). In the AstraZeneca group, the severity of side effects and prevalence of taking painkillers were significantly higher (P < 0.050) and the interval between vaccination and side effects onset was significantly shorter (P = 0.013).\n\nThe most commonly experienced side effects in the Sinopharm group were fatigue (29.0%), myalgia (24.9%), fever (24.0%), and headache (21.7%), and in the AstraZeneca group were fever (59.6%), chills (51.1%), myalgia (40.4%), and fatigue (34.0%). Logistic regression by controlling for confounding variables showed that considering some factors as confounding factors did not show a significant difference between the 2 vaccines in the experience of side effects (P = 0.104).\n\nConclusion: The AstraZeneca vaccine caused more severe side effects in MS patients than the Sinopharm vaccine. Most of the side effects were moderate in severity and transient.\n\nKey Words: SARS-CoV-2, Multiple Sclerosis, Vaccination, COVID-19 Vaccines, AstraZeneca, Sinopharm\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe current coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic first emerged in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly around the world, causing millions of people to contract the disease and die. 1 As of May 1, 2021, there have been 152661445 cases of COVID-19 and 3202256 deaths due to COVID-19 in the world. 2 In addition to increasing immunity, vaccines can prevent serious diseases, and health crises. 3 With the announcement of the epidemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), worldwide efforts for the COVID-19 vaccine began. 4\n\nThe ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca-Oxford), which is one of the COVID-19 adenovirus carrier vaccines, was studied by researchers and the results showed that this vaccine has the desired safety profile, 3 and thus, on February 15, 2021, this vaccine was approved for emergency use. 5 As of May 16, 2021, the AstraZeneca vaccine has been approved by 101 countries and distributed in 139 countries. The effectiveness of the AstraZeneca vaccine is 70.4%. 2 The BBIBP-CorV vaccine (Sinopharm COVID-19) is a vaccine of inactivated COVID-19 virus that was in the third phase of testing in late December 2020. 6 Sinopharm claimed in December that its first vaccine was 79% effective in preventing the symptoms of COVID-19 based on transient phase III data. 7 Studies have shown that the efficacy of the Sinopharm vaccine is 50.4%. 8\n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease and a neurodegenerative disorder that causes significant disability in young and middle-aged people.9,10 MS patients are themselves at higher risk for COVID-19, and the use of disease modifying therapies (DMT) can increase this risk.11,12 While vaccination is recommended for people with MS, 13 there is uncertainty about how COVID-19 vaccines interact with MS and DMT treatments. 14 There is also the fact that MS patients are not included in clinical trials evaluating the safety of vaccines, 15 so it seems necessary to evaluate the effects of vaccination on MS patients.\n\nSeveral COVID-19 vaccines are currently available in various countries, including Iran. In Kermanshah (a western province of Iran), the injection of Sinopharm and AstraZeneca vaccines was conducted on MS patients as of May 2021. In this study, Sinopharm and AstraZeneca vaccines were compared in terms of their side effects in MS patients in Kermanshah.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nStudy design and research community: This original article was the result of a cross-sectional study performed between May and August 2021. Using convenience sampling method, the participants were selected from the MS registry system. 16 The study population included all MS patients in Kermanshah province who had received at least 1 dose of the Sinopharm or AstraZeneca vaccine. The inclusion criteria were a definitive diagnosis of MS, an age of higher than 18 years, and at least 1 injection of Sinopharm or AstraZeneca vaccine. The exclusion criteria included unwillingness to participation in the study and lack of response to phone calls.\n\nData collection tools and methods: The data collection tool was a researcher-made form designed to collect demographic and clinical information, and information on infection with COVID-19 before vaccination and vaccine side effects. The form consisted of 3 parts. The first part was related to patients' demographic and clinical information including gender, age, marital status, age at diagnosis, type of MS, and current MS medication. The second part included questions on COVID-19 infection before vaccination, and the MS medication they were taking at the time of infection. For the diagnosis of COVID-19, 3 conditions were considered: either the person himself tested positive, or he did not get tested, but the doctor told him it was COVID-19, or there was a family infection and at least one family member tested positive. The third part of the questionnaire included questions related to the side effects of dose-1 of the vaccines. Patients were contacted by telephone, and the necessary information was collected.\n\nEthical considerations: The present study was approved by the ethics committee of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences with the code IR.KUMS.MED.REC.1400.087. Patients’ consent for cooperation in the study was obtained after providing them with clear explanations on the preservation of their information, and assuring them that the data obtained would remain confidential and would be used for research purposes only. Each participant was assigned a code that was used in all forms.\n\nThe collected data was entered into SPSS software (version 25, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), and data analysis was performed according to the project objectives. Descriptive statistics such as mean, frequency, percentage, and graph were used. After checking the normality of the data using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the mean ranks of the abnormal variables, and chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used to examine the relationship between qualitative variables. In examining the experience of side effects, multiple logistic regression analysis was used to control potential confounding factors.\n\nResults\n\nIn total, 264 MS patients were evaluated after dose-1 of the COVID-19 vaccine, of which 217 (82.2%) and 47 (17.8%) received the Sinopharm and AstraZeneca vaccine, respectively.\n\nMoreover, 206 (78.0%) participants were women and 58 (22.0%) were men. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) of age and disease duration in the Sinopharm group were 41.89 ± 11.20 years (range: 21-79 years) and 9.37 ± 6.90 years (range: 0-36 years), respectively. These values were, respectively, 37.82 ± 9.40 years (range: 20-60 years) and 9.02 ± 4.60 years (range: 2-23 years) in the AstraZeneca group. In the Sinopharm and AstraZeneca group, 73.3% and 78.6% of MS patients had relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), respectively. Before vaccination, 58 patients (27.0%) in the Sinopharm group and 11 patients (24.4%) in the AstraZeneca group were infected with COVID-19 ( ).\n\nTable 1\n\nVariable Sinopharm AstraZeneca P Age [median (IQR)]4000 (15)3800 (12.5)0.043**Total21445Duration of disease [median (IQR)]800 (10)800 (7)0.583**Total21243Gender [n (%)]0.899* Female169 (77.9)37 (78.7) Male48 (22.1)10 (21.3) Total217 (100)47 (100)Marital status [n (%)]0.189* Single57 (26.5)15 (36.6) Married158 (73.5)26 (63.4) Total215 (100)41 (100)Education [n (%)]0.139* Primary or middle54 (25.0)5 (12.5) Diploma69 (32.2)18 (45.0) College level91 (42.6)17 (42.5) Total214 (100)40 (100)Type of MS [n (%)]0.509* RR157 (73.7)33 (78.6) PP22 (10.3)1 (2.4) SP25 (11.7)6 (14.3) RP9 (4.2)2 (4.8) Total213 (100)42 (100)Prior infection with COVID-19 [n (%)]0.726* Yes58 (27.0)11 (24.4) No157 (73.0)34 (75.6) Total215 (100)45 (100)MS medicine [n (%)]0.106* Oral therapy58 (28.3)9 (20.0) Fingolimod33 (16.1)6 (13.3) Triflunomide4 (2.0)0 (0) Dimethylfumarate21 (10.2)3 (6.7) Injectable therapy 67 (32.7)20 (44.1) Interferon beta-1a33 (16.1)11 (24.4) Interferon beta-1b25 (12.2)6 (13.3) Glatiramer acetate9 (4.4)3 (6.7) Infusion therapy44 (21.5)13 (28.9) Rituximab42 (20.5)12 (26.7) Ocrelizumab2 (1.0)1 (2.2) Other36 (17.6)3 (6.6)Total205 (100)45 (100)Vaccine217 (82.2)47 (17.8)\n\nFurthermore, 58.5% of the subjects in the Sinopharm group and 73.3% of patients in the AstraZeneca group had side effects that were not significant (P = 0.064).\n\nIn the Sinopharm group, more than 30% of people had low-severity side effects, but in the AstraZeneca group, only 8% of people had low-severity side effects, and 92% of people experienced moderate to severe side effects. The severity of the side effects was significantly higher in the AstraZeneca group compared to the Sinopharm group (P < 0.001).\n\nThe mean ± SD time of side effects initiation was 12.61 ± 20.90 hours after vaccination in the Sinopharm vaccine group and 11.88 ± 8.90 hours after vaccination in the AstraZeneca vaccine group. A significantly shorter interval between vaccination and onset of side effects was observed in the AstraZeneca group compared to the Sinopharm group (P = 0.013).\n\nAlthough the side effects in the AstraZeneca group (14.75 ± 13.00 hours) had an average shorter duration than the Sinopharm group (44.58 ± 78.00 hours), this difference was not significant (P = 0.826).\n\nIn AstraZeneca recipients, the prevalence of taking painkillers after vaccination was significantly higher than in Sinopharm recipients (P = 0.018). The most common side effects in the Sinopharm group were fatigue (29.0%), myalgia (24.9%), fever (24.0%), and headache (21.7%), and in the AstraZeneca group were fever (59.6%), chills (51.1%), myalgia (40.4%), and fatigue (34.0%).\n\nThe prevalence of myalgia, fever, and chills was significantly higher in the AstraZeneca group than in the Sinopharm group (P < 0.050), but hot flashes was observed only in the Sinopharm group in 7.8% of people which was significantly more than the AstraZeneca group (P = 0.049) ( and ).\n\nTable 2\n\nVariable Sinopharm (Dose-1) AstraZeneca (Dose-1) P Interval between injection and the onset\n\nof side effects (hours) [median (IQR)]550 (9.5)1200 (5.5)0.013*Duration of side effects (hours) [median (IQR)]16 (44.0)1475 (-)0.826*Existence of side effects [n (%)] Yes127 (58.5)33 (73.3)0.064** No90 (41.5)12 (26.7)The severity of side effects [n (%)] Mild107 (31.2)10 (8.0) Moderate212 (61.8)106 (84.8)< 0.001** Severe24 (7.0)9 (7.2)Taking painkillers after injection [n (%)] Yes78 (41.7)26 (61.9)0.018** No109 (58.3)16 (38.1)Side effects [n (%)] Fatigue63 (29.0)16 (34.0)0.496** Myalgia54 (24.9)19 (40.4)0.031** Fever52 (24.0)28 (59.6)< 0.001** Headache47 (21.7)10 (21.3)0.954** Restlessness27 (12.4)8 (17.0)0.401** Chills24 (11.1)24 (51.1)< 0.001** Anorexia20 (9.2)6 (12.8)0.427*** Loss of consciousness19 (8.8)2 (4.2)0.387*** Shortness of breath18 (8.2)5 (10.6)0.574*** Hot flashes17 (7.8)0 (0)0.049*** Cough9 (4.1)1 (2.1)1.000*** Vomit7 (3.2)3 (6.3)0.390*** Vertigo6 (2.8)3 (6.3)0.203*** Low blood pressure5 (2.3)2 (4.2)0.612*** Diarrhea5 (2.3)1 (2.1)1.000*** Joint pain4 (1.8)2 (4.2)0.290*** Wheezing2 (0.9)0 (0)1.000*** Shock2 (0.9)0 (0)1.000*** Skin urticaria1 (0.5)1 (2.1)0.325*** Exacerbation of MS symptoms0 (0)1 (2.1)0.178*** Heart beat0 (0)1 (2.1)0.178*** Feeling very thirsty0 (0)1 (2.1)0.178***\n\nTo control potential confounding factors, multiple logistic regression was used. The variables of gender, age, education, duration of disease, type of MS, prior infection with COVID-19, MS medicine, and type of vaccine were not considered as confounding variables in experiencing side effects after vaccination ( ).\n\nTable 3\n\nVariable B SE Wald df P Exp (B) Gender-0.0540.3210.02610.8720.948Age-0.0090.0150.35910.5490.991Education0.1130.1260.79410.3731.119Duration of disease00.0240.00110.9780.999Type of MS-0.0310.1720.03310.8560.969Prior infection with COVID-190.4440.3181.95010.1631.560MS medicine-0.0460.0302.35210.1250.955Type of vaccine0.6320.3892.63810.1041.882Constant-0.0450.9520.00210.9620.956\n\nAmong patients who were infected with COVID-19 before vaccination, 36 (62.1%) in the Sinopharm group and 10 (90.9%) in the AstraZeneca group experienced side effects. Sinopharm and AstraZeneca groups did not show any significant difference in side effects between those who had COVID-19 before vaccination and those who did not (P > 0.050).\n\nIn both Sinopharm and AstraZeneca groups, more than 85.0% of patients who had COVID-19 before vaccination experienced mild to moderate-severity side effects. There was no significant difference in the severity of side effects between those who experienced COVID-19 before dose-1 and those who did not in either group (P > 0.050) ( ).\n\nTable 4\n\nVariable Sinopharm (Dose-1) AstraZeneca (Dose-1) Infected Uninfected Infected Uninfected Existence of side effects Yes36 (62.1)90 (57.3)10 (90.9)23 (67.6) No22 (37.9)67 (42.7)1 (9.1)11 (32.4) P0.531*0.240*The severity of side effects Mild and moderate112 (94.9)207 (92.0)37 (88.1)79 (95.2) Severe6 (5.1)18 (8.0)5 (11.9)4 (4.8) P0.315*0.162**\n\nIn the AstraZeneca group, there were no major events after vaccination, but in the Sinopharm group, a 46-year-old man who had MS for 14 years developed severe symptoms of COVID-19 two days after the dose-1 vaccination. The COVID-19 test was positive for him. He was hospitalized for a week following the worsening of his symptoms and was then released. This person received dose-2 52 days after dose-1, and had no side effects after dose-2.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn the present study, we investigated the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines after dose-1 in MS patients. The results of our study showed that, in the Sinopharm group, 58.5% of patients experienced side effects including fatigue, myalgia, fever, headache, etc.\n\nIn the AstraZeneca group, 73.3% of side effects included fever, chills, myalgia, and fatigue, etc. Side effects were significantly more severe in the AstraZeneca group than in the Sinopharm group.\n\nA review article about the effects of 3 vaccines (Sinopharm, Sputnik V, and AstraZeneca) on the general population from January 1, 2020, to May 1, 2021, showed that all 3 vaccines created immunity to the disease and all 3 Vaccines were 100% effective in preventing severe COVID-19. 17 A study by Almufty et al. In Iraq, 18 which studied the side effects of Sinopharm, AstraZeneca-Oxford, and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines among the general public, found that 84.0% of the participants were symptomatic after vaccination. In the AstraZeneca group the most commonly experienced side effects included fever (68.4%), fatigue (64.9%), myalgia (54.2%), and injection site reaction (54.2%), and in the Sinopharm group, injection site reaction (54.5%), fatigue (40.9%), myalgia (36.3%), and headache (33.3%). In this study, the most commonly experienced side effects of Sinopharm and AstraZeneca were similar to that in our study. Moreover, the researchers of the mentioned study observed that the side effects had mild to moderate severity in 83.7% of individuals and the severity of the side effects was significantly higher in the AstraZeneca group. Similarly, our study showed that more than 90.0% of people had mild to moderate side effects, and the severity of the side effects was significantly higher in AstraZeneca group.\n\nMenni et al. evaluated the efficacy and safety of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines at 590,655 vaccine doses in the UK community.19 They found that systemic side effects occurred in 33.7% of individuals and local side effects were reported in 58.7% of individuals after dose-1 of AstraZeneca. 19 The most commonly experienced side effects in the AstraZeneca group were headache (22.8%), fatigue (21.1%), chills and shiver (14.7%), arthralgia (11.5%), and fever (8.2%). Furthermore, the prevalence of systemic side effects in people who had experienced COVID-19 before vaccination was 1.6 times higher than in those who had not. The results of the abovementioned studies are similar to the results of our study which showed that in patients with a history of COVID-19 in both groups, both the number and severity of side effects were higher, although this difference was not statistically significant in our study.\n\nJayadevan et al conducted an online survey among 5,396 people in India from January to February 2021. 20 Their findings showed that 65.9% of their participants reported to have experienced at least 1 post-vaccination side effect, and the most commonly experienced side effects included fatigue (45%), myalgia (44%), fever (34%), and headache (28%).\n\nIn a study by Riad et al. among health care workers in the Czech Republic who received COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer), the findings indicated that injection site pain (89.8%), fatigue (62.2%), headache (45.6%), muscle pain (37.1%), and chills (33.9%) were the most common side effects; in addition, the duration of side effects was mainly 1 day (45.1%) or 3 days (35.8%) after vaccination. 21\n\nSeveral studies have been performed on the side effects of COVID-19 vaccination in MS patients. In a study by Lotan et al. on 239 MS patients who received the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine, a total of 136 patients (56.9%) reported vaccine side effects. 15 The most common side effect was injection site pain, which was reported by 111 patients (46.4%); followed by fatigue (38.1%), muscle pain (36.8%), headache (36.8%), Chills (29.7%), fever (15.9%) and dizziness (12.6%).\n\nIn the study by Allen‎-Philbey et al., the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines in MS patients were evaluated, and 29 patients received the AstraZeneca and 4 patients received BioNTech/Pfizer. 22 All patients except 2 (94%) had symptoms including sore arm (70%), flu-like symptoms (64%), fever (21%), fatigue (27%), and headache (21%), fever/chills (12%), joint pain/muscle pain (9%), nausea (9%), and swelling at injection site (6%). In their study, as in our study, for most patients the symptoms lasted less than 48 hours.\n\nSahraian et al. examined the side effects of the Sinopharm vaccine in 583 MS patients and found that 350 (60%) of the patients reported at least 1 side effect. 23 No serious side effects were reported and the most commonly experienced side effects included malaise (25%), fatigue (25%), generalized body pain (18%), fever (17%), and headache (9%). In addition, the average duration of side effects was 2 days, which was similar to the findings of our study.\n\nThe abovementioned studies conducted on the general public suggest that the side effects in MS patients in our study are similar to those observed in the general population and MS patients in other studies. However, for more accurate conclusions, more studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up times are needed.\n\nOne of the limitations of the present study was that a complete list of MS patients who had received the vaccine in Kermanshah province was not available. Moreover, some patients did not answer the phone. These two reasons made it impossible for us to have a larger sample size.\n\nIt is recommended that vaccinations for MS patients be recorded at specialized centers for these patients so that a more complete list of patients can be accessed.\n\nAnother limitation of the present study was that in order to conduct a correct evaluation without bias and distortion of the side effects, a randomized clinical trial design should be used, so that people with similar clinical conditions are assigned to the study groups and the number of people in the groups is balanced. Nevertheless, it was not possible to conduct the study in this way, and thus, a cross-sectional study was performed. Gathering information by phone and not using clinical examination or observation, and the possibility that the researcher and the patient are not blind can create information bias. In this study, data collection was performed by phone and it was not possible to examine the patients.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the present study, we investigated the side effects of 2 vaccines after dose-1 in MS patients. The results of our study showed that 58.5% of people in the Sinopharm group and 73.3% of people in the AstraZeneca group experienced at least 1 side effect. The interval between vaccination and onset of side effects was significantly shorter in the AstraZeneca group. In the AstraZeneca group, the side effects were significantly more severe and the prevalence of taking painkillers after injection was significantly higher than that in the Sinopharm group. The most common side effects in the Sinopharm group were fatigue, myalgia, fever, and headache. In the AstraZeneca group, fever, chills, myalgia, and fatigue were the most common side effects. In the AstraZeneca group, the severity of side effects was significantly higher, the interval between vaccination and the onset of side effects was significantly shorter, and the prevalence of taking painkillers after vaccination was significantly higher than in the Sinopharm group. In both groups, the prevalence of side effects was higher in patients who had been infected with COVID-19 before vaccination, but this difference was not significant. In both groups, most of the side effects were mild and moderate in severity and were mostly transient. Chi-square test in univariate analysis showed that the type of vaccine has a significant effect on side effects, and some side effects occurred significantly more with AstraZeneca than Sinopharm, while the results of multiple logistic regression by controlling for confounding variables showed that the type of vaccine has no significant effect on side effects. This shows that considering some important clinical and demographic factors as confounding factors showed no significant differences between the side effects of the 2 vaccines.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe acknowledge the support of the Deputy for Research and Technology of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, and the Clinical Research Development Center of Imam Reza Hospital.\n\nNotes:\n\nHow to cite this article: Razazian N, Sahraian MA, Rezaei M, Eskandarieh S, Khamoushian K, Mousavi SE, et al.
