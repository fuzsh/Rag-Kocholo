        "text": "MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., April 6, 2022 – Honeywell today announced that Sinopharm Shanghai Biomedical Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of China National Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. (Sinopharm), has adopted Honeywell Solstice® N40 (R-448A) refrigerant. The energy efficient, low global-warming-potential (GWP) solution will be used for cold storage of Sinopharm vaccines used in Shanghai, including the company’s COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThis project marks the first time Solstice® N40 has been used for medical cold chain storage. Honeywell’s solution not only meets the temperature requirements of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius for the customer’s vaccine storage, but also reduces carbon emissions, helping China achieve its goals to be carbon neutral by 2060.\n\n\"The storage and distribution of vaccines is an important task. We choose to partner with Honeywell to adopt its proven Solstice N40 solution, ensuring the medicine is stored safely and properly,\" said Baohua Zhang, chairman of Shanghai Xiongzhi Refrigeration Engineering Co., Ltd., the general contractor of the vaccine cold storage project in Shanghai. \"As more Chinese refrigeration customers apply higher standards in terms of environmental protection and cost-effectiveness, we will continue cooperating with Sinopharm Shanghai Biomedical Co., Ltd. and other clients to fulfill social responsibility and achieve sustainable development.\"\n\nChina announced its acceptance of the Kigali Amendment in April 2021, and the requirements were effective in China on September 15, 2021. In order to meet the HFC phasedown regulations as required by Kigali and in response to China's goals of achieving carbon peak by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060, many Chinese cold storage operators are actively looking for alternative solutions that are reliable, practical and helpful to reduce carbon emission. Honeywell Solstice® N40 has been widely adopted by the cold storage industry worldwide since its release in 2015, making it an excellent alternative to R-404A/R-507A refrigerants, which have much higher global-warming potential (GWP).\n\n\"Solstice® N40 has become a reliable choice for the majority of refrigeration customers in the global industrial and commerical world, helping to save energy and reduce carbon emissions while meeting stringent regulatory requirements. We are proud to provide this technology to enable safe storage and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine in China, while supporting the global fight against the epidemic,\" said Tom Liu, vice president and general manager of Honeywell Advanced Materials, Asia Pacific.\n\nSolstice® N40 (R-448A) offers a GWP that is approximately 68 percent lower than legacy HFC refrigerants like R-404A. In addition, Solstice® N40 is a more energy-efficient refrigerant compared with R404A. Solstice® N40 has become the recognized R-404A alternative in the global supermarket industry, with more than 60,000 industrial and commercial refrigeration facilities installed worldwide.\n\nHoneywell develops, manufactures and supplies refrigerants sold worldwide under the Solstice® and Genetron® brands for a variety of applications including refrigeration, building and automotive air conditioning. Honeywell is a world leader in the development, manufacture and supply of refrigerants that are sold worldwide under the Solstice® and Genetron® brand names. They are used for a wide range of applications including refrigeration and air conditioning for buildings and automobiles, heating and cooling by heat pumps and chillers in heat networks, industry and buildings. Honeywell and its suppliers have completed a billion-dollar investment program in research, development, and new capacity for Honeywell’s hydrofluorolefin technology. Worldwide adoption of Solstice products has avoided the potential release of more than 260 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, equal to eliminating the potential emissions from more than 56 million cars for one year.\n\nHoneywell recently committed to achieve carbon neutrality in its operations and facilities by 2035. This commitment builds on the company’s track record of sharply reducing the greenhouse gas intensity of its operations and facilities as well as its decades-long history of innovation to help its customers meet their environmental and social goals. About half of Honeywell’s new product introduction research and development investment is directed toward products that improve environmental and social outcomes for customers."
