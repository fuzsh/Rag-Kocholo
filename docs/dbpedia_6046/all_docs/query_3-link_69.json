And while the protection offered by two doses wanes over time and offers little protection against infection with omicron, the mRNA vaccines appear to offer the best protection against an omicron infection when used as boosters.\n\n17 Feb, 2022, 10:07 AM IST\n\nUAE approves Sinopharm's protein-based vaccine\n\nThe vaccine will be produced and distributed by a joint venture between the UAE's Group 42 and China National Biotec Group (CNBG), a unit of China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm), the ministry said in a statement on state media on Monday.\n\n28 Dec, 2021, 12:21 PM IST\n\nChina's Sinovac COVID-19 booster weaker against Omicron: Hong Kong Study\n\nSinovac's CoronaVac and state-owned Sinopharm's BBIBP-CorV vaccine are the two most-used vaccines in China.\n\n23 Dec, 2021, 04:29 PM IST\n\nWHO approves Novavax as 10th authorised Covid jab\n\nIt is made from a more conventional technology than others already approved, which has led officials in Brussels to express hope that this will help persuade those hesitant about vaccination to come forward.\n\n21 Dec, 2021, 11:02 PM IST\n\nMost of the world’s vaccines likely will not prevent infection from Omicron\n\nPreliminary data from South Africa suggest that with omicron, there is a much higher chance of people who already had COVID getting reinfected than there was with the original virus and previous variants.\n\n21 Dec, 2021, 10:04 AM IST\n\nJ&J, Sinopharm, Sputnik V COVID-19 shots less effective against Omicron -study\n\nVaccines from Moderna, AstraZeneca, Pfizer and partner BioNTech retained activity against Omicron, but the antibody response was greatly reduced when compared with the original strain, the study found.\n\n18 Dec, 2021, 07:57 AM IST\n\nMixing and matching vaccines: What WHO says\n\n17 Dec, 2021, 06:19 PM IST\n\nSinopharm, J&J, Sputnik vaccines are weaker against Omicron in new study\n\nOnly three out of 13 people who has taken both doses of Sinopharm’s shot showed neutralizing antibodies against omicron.
