        "text": "On Wednesday, the health ministry of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) stated Sinopharm’s COVID-19 vaccine shows 86% efficiency rates against the coronavirus, as reported by Reuters.\n\nSinopharm is the name for the China National Pharmaceutical Group, and the analysis comes during its late stage trials of the vaccine in the UAE.\n\nHowever, no detailed data has yet been shared by either Sinopharm or the UAE.\n\nSEE ALSO: FDA SAID PFIZER/BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE HAS OFFICIALLY ‘MET SUCCESS CRITERIA’\n\nThe UAE stated that it’s registered Sinopharm’s vaccine, reported the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn September, the vaccine received emergency use approval for certain groups, the first time a vaccine from China received such international clearance. It’s one of the top three COVID-19 vaccines being developed in China at the moment, and so far around 1 million people in the country have been inoculated with it.\n\nSinopharm’s COVID-19 vaccine still falls short of other vaccines in terms of efficacy against the coronavirus. Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine claims 92% efficiency, Moderna’s shows 100% efficiency in certain groups, and Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine, which the U.K. was the first to claim widespread use, shows a 95% efficiency rate.\n\nThe recent analysis of Sinopharm’s vaccine demonstrated that 99% of participants developed antibodies against the virus. This vaccine is based on an inactivated virus.\n\nBloomberg is keeping a close eye on the world’s COVID-19 vaccines, take a look at how Sinopharm is comparing on its graphs."
