        "text": "As vaccine developers in Western countries prepare for the global distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines, Sinopharm said it has been testing the safety and efficacy of its two inactivated coronavirus vaccines. However, it has yet to release any public data regarding the vaccines' efficacy in their phase-three trials.\n\nThat has not stopped some people from seeking out the vaccine, which is meant for frontline workers.\n\nOne anonymous source told Bloomberg that he paid $91 for two doses of what he believed to be a Sinopharm vaccine.\n\n\"You just transfer him the money via Alipay, but he won't tell you the details because apparently it's black market,\" the source told Bloomberg, referring to the digital payments app run by Alibaba.\n\nRelated stories\n\nSinopharm's application to officially launch its vaccines came after Pfizer and Moderna's recent announcements that their vaccines were 95% and 94.5% effective, respectively.\n\nAstraZeneca and the University of Oxford had announced that their two-dose vaccine could be up to 90% effective, but an error in the trial has cast doubt on its efficacy rate. AstraZeneca's CEO Pascal Soriot on Thursday said the company will likely retest its COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe rush to secure Sinopharm vaccines in China sheds light on the potential challenges of ensuring equitable and transparent distribution of coronavirus vaccines across the globe.\n\nPeople who have successfully accessed the experimental Sinopharm vaccines in China are usually those who have privileged connections and want protection before traveling."
