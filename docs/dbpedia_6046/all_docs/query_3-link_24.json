        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1]. The virus has spread fast over the world, resulting various levels of illnesses. On March 11, 2020, was announced that SARS-CoV-2 is a worldwide pandemic that has lasted through this moment [2].\n\nEven though numerous therapeutic medications have been presented to resist COVID-19, they remain supportive and still require more randomized control studies to determine their efficacy and potency. [3, 4]. develop the vaccines is perhaps the best way to stopping this pandemic.\n\nVaccines are one of the best interventions developed for eradicating COVID-19, it saving millions lives annually, moreover, the best option remains an effective, safe vaccine, and without serious adverse reactions. The lack of effective and approved treatment of COVID-19 has triggered a vaccine development race, with 259 COVID-19 vaccine projects underway from November 11, 2020. The rapid creation of vaccinations was increased the risk of vaccine safety problems [5, 6].\n\nSeveral candidate COVID-19 vaccines were developed from diverse platforms, one of them BBIBP-CorV vaccine (also known as the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine) that was made by Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical business called Sinopharm in China that adopted by the UAE [7].\n\nSinopharm COVID-19 vaccine is an inactivated vaccine that introduces a dead copy of SARS-CoV-2 into the body by a two-dose schedule, with 14 or 21 days between the 2 doses. However, by inserting the vaccine dose intramuscularly, the dead antigens from the virus are employed to make antibodies that prepare the immune system for future attacks by the virus. [8].\n\nThe traditional inactivated whole-virus vaccines don’t lead to a clinical disease. In this technology the inactivated viruses maintain their ability to replicate in vivo with mild or no symptoms. [9]. Clinical trial 1 and 2 of Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine were done in China over 1 trial for each, with a total enrolment of 640 persons showed that the vaccine triggered a COVID-19 neutralizing antibody response with a low rate of adverse reactions. The most common side effects were fever and pain at the site of injection and fever, but were mild, self-limiting, and didn’t required treatment [10].\n\nPhase 3 was done over 4 trials in the following countries, the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Peru, and Argentina, with a total of 69,000 people enrolled. The UAE approved the vaccine developed by the Chinese state-owned Sinopharm on December 9, 2020, UAE announcements that the vaccine was 86% efficacious, according to interim results of its phase 3 trial [8].\n\nHad administered over 2 million doses of the vaccine as of mid-January, the UAE Ministry of Health also reported the vaccine to be 100% effective in the prevention of mild and severe COVID-19 cases [11, 12, 13, 14], Moreover, WHO Announced that the most side effects of Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine in three clinical trials on 16,671 participants aged 18–59 years were mild to moderate in addition, headaches, fatigue, and injection site reactions were the most common side effects of this vaccine. [15].\n\nPublished data to support adverse reaction of Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine are lacking, two studies only focus on Sinopharm COVID-19vaccine [16, 17], moreover, fear of the new vaccine is a driver of vaccine hesitancy.\n\nThe knowledge about what happens post vaccination in the actual world among the general population is still modest, Thus, by describing what to expect after 1st and 2nd dose of vaccination will help in lowering the apprehension about this type vaccines, increased the public confidence in the vaccines, safety, and accelerates the vaccination process against COVID-19. [16, 17]. The results of this study will be reassuring to those who are fearful of the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine. So, the goal of this study to provide evidence on Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine side effects after receiving 1st and 2nd dose of it, which is approved by UAE.\n\nResults\n\nDemographic characteristics\n\nTable 1. shows the demographic data of participants, 760 (70.4%) were females, 320 (29.6%) were males. the mean age of participants was 37.22±13.1 years old. Of the participants, 440 (40.7%) were single, 600 (55.6%) were married and 3.7% were divorced or widower. About 644 (59.7%) were holding a bachelor’s degree, 288 (21.1%) were holding a high school degree or below, and 180 (16.6%) were holding postgraduate degree. Around 508 (47.1%) were employed, 232 (21.5%) were unemployed and 304 (28.2%) were students. Most of participants, 856 (79.3%) were non-Emirati and 224 (20.7%) were Emirati. Many of the participants (52.9%) lived in Sharjah, 288(26.7%) lived in Dubai and the rest 220 (20.3%) lived in the other Emirates.\n\nChronic conditions among the participants\n\nOf 1080 participants, 780 (72.2%) were healthy, while 300 (27.8%) had chronic conditions. The most prevalent chronic conditions as shown in table 2 were diabetes 7.8% followed by hypertension 6.3%, while 3.7%, 3.7%, 3.3%,0.7%, 0.7%, 0.4%, 0.4%, 0.4%, 0.4% suffer of chronic respiratory diseases, heart diseases, obesity, acute cancer, severe anemia, autoimmune diseases, severe allergic, receiving immunotherapy, and liver diseases, respectively.\n\nRelation between the side effects of vaccination with the age (≤49 years old and >49 years old)\n\nTable 3 compares COVID-19-related anamnesis of vaccinated individuals who are below and above the age 49. Regarding whom is vaccinated, the study shows a significant difference between people who are ≤49 years old and >49 years old (p=0.000). Participants who are older than 49 years were more likely to be vaccinated (85%) compared to the ones below 49 years (75%). The results regarding number of doses were not significant (p=0.128). There was a significant difference in whether the participants got Covid-19 infection previously or not with a P value of 0.002. Those who are less or equal to 49 years were more likely to have a previous COVID-19 infection (16.6%).\n\nTable 4. presents the prevalence of general adverse reaction of 1st dose of Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine in participants (≤49 years old vs >49 years old). The table shows that the around 24.4% (26% vs 18.6%) didn’t get any side effects. The common side effects among both ages of participants were normal pain at the site of vaccination 42.2%, fatigue 12.2%, and headache 9.6%), the same table indicated that was a significant difference between both groups (≤49 years vs >49 years old) with the severe pain at the vaccination site (P= 0.023), nausea (P=0.010) and muscle pain (P=0.010). Moreover, almost 6.8% of participants >49 years reported sever pain at the vaccination site while, compared with 1.42% among ≤49 years old. More proportion of participants who are >49 years old reported nausea and muscle pain compared to patients ≤49 years, it was (0.5% vs 5%) and (4.3% vs 13.6%), respectively.\n\nThe tables shows that no significant between age of participant and another side effects such as normal pain at the vaccination site (P=0.999), tenderness (p=0.963), redness (p=0.452), induration and pruritus at the vaccination site (p=0.356), Fever (p=0.631), headache (p=0.178), fatigue (p=0.429), cough and allergy (p=0.631), Abdominal pain (p=0.324), abdominal pain (p=0.324), back pain (p=0.054), lethargy (p=0.631), and others symptoms (0.452).\n\nIn the 2nd dose of Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine (≤49 years vs >49 years old) there were more prevalence of side effects than the 1st dose (table 5). Among the (≤49 years vs >49 years old) participants, 14% (15% vs 10%) didn’t get any post-vaccination symptoms. Furthermore, pain 32.6%, at the vaccination site, fatigue16.3%, lethargy13.7%, headache10%, and tenderness 10% are the most prevalence side effects of the respondents in both groups. The same table shows there was a significant difference between both groups (≤49 years vs >49 years old) and the fatigue (P= 0.003), while no significant difference reported with other side effects.\n\nRelation between the side effects of vaccination with the gender (females and males)\n\nTable 6 shows the prevalence of side effects post 1st dose of Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccination among two groups (females vs males). Our study was included 760 females and 320 males. The female’s significance had more symptoms of 1st vaccination than males (17% of females didn’t have side effects vs 45% males didn’t have side effects), however, significant relation reported between the symptoms such as fatigue (P=0.006) and gender.\n\nThe results shows that no significant between the side effects of tenderness (P= 0.194), redness (p-value= 0.356), fever (P= 0.891) and headache (p-value= 0.434) with the gender.\n\nTable 7 presents the prevalence of side effects of 2nd dose of vaccination among females and males. The females had more side effect of 2nd vaccination dose than males (11.6% of females didn’t have side effects vs 20% males didn’t have side effects), Sever pain at the vaccination site (P=0.027) and fatigue (P = 0.011) symptoms were significantly higher in females than males (10.5% vs 2.5%), (20% vs 7.5%), respectively. In addition, the table shows no significant between the symptoms of normal pain at vaccination site (P=0.482), tenderness (P= 0.368), redness (P = 0.834) fever (P = 0.279), and lethargy (P =0.053) with the genders.\n\nReasons of participants due to don’t take COVID 19 vaccine\n\nThe most three common reasons reported by participants for not willing to take the vaccine were 6.3% not believing that the vaccine is effective, 5.2% pant wasn’t authorized to take the vaccine and, 4.4% of them belief that the vaccine have many side effects, Moreover, the participants reported that “not have enough time” 3.7%, unavailability of the vaccine 3%, “the vaccines is not approved by WHO” 1.5%, being afraid of needles 1.1% and the least common reason was “waiting for another vaccine” 0.4% (table 8).\n\nDiscussion\n\nin August 2020, Trial 1 and 2 of Sinopharm vaccine were completed and showed that the vaccine triggered a COVID-19 neutralizing antibody response with a low rate of adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions were pain at the site of injection and fever, but all these were mild and self-limiting, moreover, no treatment was required for any side effect [8]. UAE were among the first to conduct phase three clinical trials of the vaccine, they found that the vaccine to have an 86% efficacy rate according to interim results of its phase 3 trial [8].\n\nMost of studies have assessed mainly the post-vaccination adverse reactions of the Pfizer– BioNTech, Moderna, and Astrazeneca vaccines [21, 22, 23, 24, 25], while only two studies focus on Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine [16, 17], There are no published studies yet that have focused on Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine side effects in UAE.\n\nThe finding of our study shows that the side effects of this vaccines appear to be mild. Anecdotally, a quarter of participants reported they didn’t get did not get any symptom in post-first vaccination shot, while had mild symptoms following vaccination. Second dose the 14% didn’t report any symptoms, however, most of them had mild and predictable side effects. None of the side effects were of a serious nature or required hospitalization. Our results were in line of a study in India, as frequency of experiencing symptoms following each vaccine were 24.4% (Sinopharm). [16].\n\nIn first dose of vaccination the findings showed a statistically significant differences in the prevalence of severe pain at the vaccination site, nausea, and muscle pain, between the participants in both groups (≤49 vs >49). While in the 2nd dose showed a significant difference in the prevalence of Fatigue between two groups. Moreover, the more frequent side effect prevalence is normal Pain at the vaccination site (42.2%), fatigue (12.2%) headache (9.6%), lethargy (9.2%), and muscle pain (6.3%). The reported symptoms in our study were similar to symptoms that appear on participants in phase 1/2 trial of Sinopharm vaccine and reported by Sinopharm vaccine company, WHO, DOH and MOH in the UAE reported that the most adverse reactions were injection site reactions, headaches, fatigue, they indicated that the most common systematic adverse reaction was pain at the vaccination site fever, it was self-limited and recovered, none of the symptoms were of serious nature or requiring hospitalization. [8, 15, 19]\n\nInjection site pain symptom reported in several literatures on vaccines’ side effects [16 Jayadevan, 17, 24, 25], injection in a relaxed muscle leads to less pain compared to a tensed one; therefore, the researchers recommended to lower the patient’s arm that will be injected to reduce the pain. In addition, vaccines in in situ should be keep it in a low temperature, including Sinopharm vaccine that should store at normal refrigeration temperature, and if injected without optimal warming up, this may increase the probability of pain of the injection site symptom. [17, 24, 26].\n\nThere was a clear linear correlation between age and vaccination side effects, the younger adults (≤49) were more frequently affected than other groups (>49). Vaccine reactogenicity is known to correlate with transient elevation of inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that the vaccine reactogenicity declined with age. but it is not considered a reliable sign of a desirable immune response [27]. Similar to our results showed in various studies on COVID-19 vaccine side effects [16, 24, 28], Moreover, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), side effects tend to be more noticeable after the first dose [29].\n\nSimilar to findings of studies recently published [17, 25] We observed that the frequency of adverse effective in the second shot was slightly higher than to the first dose. Except some symptoms (1st vs 2nd), nausea (1.5% vs 1.1%), Allergy (1.1% vs 0), Cough (1.1% vs 0.7%), Abdominal Pain (1.85% vs 1.5%, Back pain (4.07% vs 3%), this finding could be interpreted on the basis response of the immune system’s. The immune system could produce cytokines that could have an inflammatory effect on the blood vessels, muscles, and other tissues. It may also produce flu-like symptoms that last for days after vaccination. [7].\n\nWomen generally were more likely to develop side effects of vaccination than males, as 83% of the females reported they had side effects compared to 55% reported by males’ participants post 1st dose of vaccination, while was (98.5% female vs, 80% males) for post 2nd dose of vaccination. Previous studies on COVID-19 vaccine have reported more side effect in females compared to males in both doses [16, 24, 25].\n\nAccording to our results the (1.1%) of participants has been Allergic symptoms post -1st vaccination, while no cases for allergy reported among them post -2nd dose vaccination.\n\nThis confirms that the participants with allergic reaction in this study did not receive the second dose of vaccination, there are no published data on the safety of the 2nd dose of covid vaccine after an allergic reaction to the first dose. one study indicated that anyone with immediate allergic reaction history of any severity to any component of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines or to polyethylene glycol or polysorbate should not be vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.[30].\n\nAllergic reactions to vaccines not attributed to the active vaccine itself, they might be caused by inactive ingredients, such as egg protein, gelatin, formaldehyde, thimerosal, or neomycin, that contribute to specific IgE-mediated immediate reactions. According to European Medicines Agency (EMA), Excipients, are constituents of a medicinal form apart from the active substance, it constitute inert substances that are added to vaccines to improve stability, increase solubility, improve absorption, influence palatability, or create a distinctive appearance. Excipients can cause various clinical allergic reactions ranging from skin disorders to life-threatening systemic reactions [31].\n\nIn our study, we noticed that the most prevalent chronic conditions among the UAE participants were diabetes 7.80%, and hypertension 6.30%, our results are consistent with the Dubai Statistical Center study that shows UAE nationals have a higher prevalence rate of diabetes and Hypertension diseases, furthermore, another study among patients with chronic disease in the UAE reported that 74.1% were Diabetics [32, 33].\n\nRecent studies have shown that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy level among residents varies from low to high, 29% of New York residents claiming they will refuse a vaccine, compared to 20% of Canadians residents, and 6% of among them in the United Kingdom. [34, 35].\n\nIn our study, a few percentages of the respondents reported that don’t want to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, the most reasons of indecision and rejection about COVID-19 were belief that the vaccine not effective, some of the participants were from the categories who are not authorized to take vaccine, while 4.4% were afraid of side effects of the vaccine. Several studies in the scientific literature reported the similar reasons, Thus, knowing what to expect post-vaccination from this study will help with public education, dispelling myths, and lowering the apprehension about Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nsimilar reasons reported in several studies, as the side effects of vaccine, don’t think the vaccine can be reliable as it will be a new vaccine, and COVID-19 infection is a biological weapon and the vaccine will serve those who produce this virus, were the most common reasons for rejection of vaccine [36]"
