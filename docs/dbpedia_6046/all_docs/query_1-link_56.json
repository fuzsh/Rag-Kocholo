        "text": "Abstract\n\nCOVID-19 is a contagious globally threatening infectious disease that accounted for an ongoing pandemic that manifested in multi-organs diseases and failures. Aims: The current study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the Pfizer and Sinopharm vaccines in relation to metabolomic alterations and their association with immune pathways. Main methods: The study employed a cross-sectional design and utilized an untargeted metabolomics-based approach. Plasma samples were collected from three groups: non-vaccinated, Sinopharm, and Pfizer vaccinated participants. Comparative metabolomic analysis was performed using TIMS-QTOF, and multiple t-tests with 5% FDR were conducted using MetaboAnalyst Software. Key findings: Out of the 105 detected metabolites, 72 showed statistically significant alterations (p < 0.05) among the different groups. Several metabolites, including neopterin, pyridoxal, and syringic acid, were highly altered in individuals vaccinated with Pfizer. On the other hand, sphinganine, neopterin, and sphingosine were impacted in Sinopharm vaccinated group. These metabolites could potentially serve as biomarkers for vaccine efficacy. Furthermore, both Pfizer and Sinopharm vaccinations were found to affect sphingolipid and histidine metabolisms when compared to the control group. The Sinopharm group exhibited altered lysine degradation compared to the control group. When comparing the enriched pathways of the Pfizer and Sinopharm groups, purine metabolism was affected. Additionally, perturbations in tryptophan and vitamin B6 metabolisms were observed when comparing the Pfizer group with both the control and Sinopharm groups. Significance: These findings highlight the importance of metabolomics in assessing vaccine effectiveness and identifying potential biomarkers for monitoring the efficacy of newly developed vaccines in a shorter timeframe."
