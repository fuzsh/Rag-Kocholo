        "text": "So, having 2 different types of viral vectors allows of immunizing people more strongly. Now, the world started working to see if one could combine the second dose of one brand with the first one of another brand but, in general, I am convinced that we should respect the creators.\n\nThe final phase of research and clinical trials showed that the Sputnik V vaccine’s effectiveness stands at 91.4%, while the vaccine prevents 100% of severe cases. From the first days of the pandemic, Russia and the UAE have emphasized the importance of joint efforts to prevent the coronavirus from spreading.\n\nThe results of all the tests will be announced. However, according to the data available today, the vaccination results (in case of some vaccines — in the amount of over half a million doses, and in case of others — in the amount of one million doses) show that the Sinopharm vaccine is better than Pfizer, but Sputnik is the best of all.\n\nWe are very excited about the possibility of producing Sputnik V in Argentina, a vaccine with which we are already protecting a large part of our population with excellent results. It will be a great opportunity to advance in the fight against the pandemic not only in Argentina, but also in Latin America.\n\nThe two studies by Logunov and colleagues have several strengths. First, adenoviruses are ubiquitous, so humans might not be immunologically naive. A second strength is the threshold for neutralisation used in the two studies. A third strength is that the vaccine, similar to other before it, induced broad immune responses. Although not specifically discussed, the results imply a T-helper1-cell-weighted response that might be important for vaccine safety, potentially reducing the risk of antibodydependent enhanced disease. A fourth strength was development of two vaccine formulations, frozen and lyophilised. A lyophilised formulation could mean stability within the existing global vaccine refrigerated cold chain that is needed to maintain vaccine efficacy from factory to recipient, a hurdle other vaccines are yet to address. Although more costly to produce at scale, product stability will maximise reach in remote terrain, a must if universal and equitable coverage is to be achieved.\n\nThe results of clinical trials of the Russian vaccine Sputnik V have demonstrated impressive results, which have now been recognized by the international medical community. The vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective with no serious side effects identified and uses a proven platform based on human adenoviral vectors, which is currently the safest mechanism for introducing the genetic code of the virus spike into the human body. This approach has been thoroughly studied not only in Russia but also internationally. Russia has a long and successful track record developing vaccines and remains a global leader in this field. We hope that the vaccine will soon become available across the world to help stop the devastating pandemic and enable people to return to normal life.\n\nThere are features that make Sputnik V a promising candidate. The idea of using two different adenoviruses as vector is superior over many vaccines in the frontline. Generally, the immune system perceive the vector proteins as antigen similar to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, so it elicit immune response against those proteins as well. If people are reimmunized (as second dose or repeated vaccine), the pre-existing immunity can compromise the efficacy of second vaccine dose. Using a vector of different nature, as is the in Sputnik V, will avoid this problem.\n\nFirst I should say to Russian scientists and Russian health professionals is ‘Bravo!’. This technology and scientific approach we perfectly understand and absolutely approve. You have made a real breakthrough in science and in medicine. We are really grateful that you have done a wonderful job. It is remarkable that stable humoral as well as cell-mediated immune response is generated. This is achieved through the use of two different vectors delivering the drug and, at the same time, solving the problem of a possible neutralizing effect on the second injection. The very high efficiency of two selected adenoviruses has been proven. Thus, the platform used by the Gamaleya Institute is the correct platform.\n\nThe work done inspires great respect, and the vaccine itself is worthy of study and use.\n\nThis is a valuable and effective vaccine that I personally look forward to. I am very interested in the work that Russian researchers have done. I realized that one of the most advanced methods was being used - the adenoviral vector method.\n\nThe Government of the State of Bahia, in Brazil, is very pleased with the agreement signed with the Sovereign Wealth Fund of the Russian Federation, which will guarantee access to the Sputnik V vaccine for the Brazilian people, as soon as it is approved by the Brazilian national regulatory authorities. As it is a vaccine built using human adenovirus, which is one of the safest and most effective vaccine development platforms in the world, we believe that the results of the ongoing phase 3 clinical trials will confirm the data observed in phases 1 and 2.\n\nWe are pleased to partner with RDIF to bring the vaccine to India. The Phase I and II results have shown promise, and we will be conducting Phase-III trials in India to meet the requirements of the Indian regulators. Sputnik V vaccine could provide a credible option in our fight against COVID 19 in India.\n\nKirill Dmitriev\n\nCEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund\n\n\"It's a Sputnik moment... Americans were surprised when they heard Sputnik's beeping. It's the same with this vaccine. Russia will have got there first,\" said Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, which is financing Russian vaccine production, referring to the successful 1957 launch of the world's first satellite by the Soviet Union.\n\nOur technology is patented, unique and with parameters which, I feel confident to claim, exceed the capabilities of analogous products being developed in the West <…> most probably, if there is any borrowing, it will be our immunization scheme to be borrowed, and we will be happy to share our hacks with the colleagues, should they need.\n\nAlexander Gintsburg\n\nDirector of the National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology\n\nSeveral vaccines will not overlap each other at all. According to general considerations, vaccinations should have a certain time gap; two-three weeks are quire sufficient,\" the expert said. \"Our immune system is very smart and this time will be enough for it to understand how to behave properly in respect of new antigens introduced as the vaccine.\n\nThe particles that we use for vaccination are made on the basis of the adenovirus. They are not live ones. The term ‘live’ applies to particles that can reproduce themselves. Those in question are unable to breed, so there should be no fear they might cause some harm to our body. There are no factors for this.\n\nI don’t conquer markets — I develop treatments. And I need my treatment to be good and effective. Who will move it and how is important, but it’s secondary. You can’t be a microbiologist or virologist right now and stay out of this.\n\nIt is time to stop the never-ending debates about the most effective means to combat the coronavirus. They are jeopardizing lives, as well as the world economy. Countries around the globe must jointly put in place best practice—including mandatory mask wearing, maintaining social distancing, and sharing readily available solutions—before it is too late.\n\nOur fund is cooperating with many nations in this field. We believe that only through a fully cooperative, global approach can this and future pandemics be successfully combated.\n\nIt would be wrong to say that we've managed to create a vaccine from scratch in a short time. Four decades have passed since adenoviral vector technology was introduced into practice. Over these four decades, a technological platform was created that has been tested on tens of thousands of people, both on the basis of the 5th and the 26th serotype vector. Since 2015, more than 3,000 people have been vaccinated with adenoviral vector-based vaccines developed at the Gamaleya Centre. Therefore, it was not a 5-month effort in any way, but work over several decades.\n\nThe creation of an effective coronavirus vaccine is a landmark event not only for Russian science and industry, but also for the entire world. The safety of the vaccine is guaranteed, since it employs a cold virus that is harmless to humans and does not contain the coronavirus itself, while only a part of its genetic code is present, thereby ruling out the possibility of infection. We have obtained an effective tool which is capable of winning the war against the pandemic!"
