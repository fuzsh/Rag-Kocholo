The parent company of Sinopharm Group was Sinopharm Industrial Investment, a 51–49 joint venture of state-owned enterprise China National Pharmaceutical Group and civilian-run enterprise Fosun Pharmaceutical.\n\nIts H shares were listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2009,[2] with its IPO price of HK$16 per share. Sinopharm Group's subsidiary Sinopharm CNMC and Sinopharm Accord served as the A share counterpart of the company. However, the A share of Sinopharm Group itself was unlisted.\n\nSinopharm Group was ranked 829th in 2016 Forbes Global 2000 list.[3]\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccine development\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Sinopharm BIBP COVID-19 vaccine\n\nThe Sinopharm BIBP COVID-19 vaccine, also known as BBIBP-CorV,[4] the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine,[5] or BIBP vaccine,[5][6][7] is one of two inactivated virus COVID-19 vaccines developed by Sinopharm. It completed Phase III trials in Argentina, Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco, Pakistan, Peru, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with over 60,000 participants.[8] The BIBP vaccine shares similar technology with CoronaVac and Covaxin, other inactivated virus vaccines for COVID-19.[9]\n\nPeer-reviewed results published in JAMA of Phase III trials in United Arab Emirates and Bahrain showed that the BIBP vaccine is 78.1% effective against symptomatic cases and 100% against severe cases (21 cases in vaccinated group vs. 95 cases in placebo group).[10] In December 2020, the UAE previously announced interim results showing 86% efficacy.[11] While mRNA vaccines showed higher efficacy of over 90%, those present distribution challenges for some nations as they require deep-freeze facilities and trucks. BIBP-CorV could be transported and stored at normal refrigerated temperatures.[12]\n\nThe BIBP vaccine is being used in vaccination campaigns by certain countries in Asia,[13][14][15] Africa,[16][17][18] South America,[19][20][21] and Europe.[22][23][24] Sinopharm was expected to produce one billion doses of the BIBP vaccine in 2021.[25] On 7 May 2021, the World Health Organization approved the vaccine for use in COVAX.[14][26]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nPharmaceutical industry in China\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
