        "text": "Whitman is a great self-promoter who refers to himself as the \"American Bard at Last.\"\n\nA bard is merely another way of saying someone is a great poet.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare is the Bard of English Literature.\n\nWalt Whitman feels as if he is just as great as Shakespeare, perhaps even greater.\n\nAlthough one of America's greatest self-promoters of that era, Walt Whitman was a conceited man. Whitman sees himself as the voice of America. He claims to be a common man who has the same feelings as all Americans. Whitman is the poet of everything American: the good, the bad, the ugly, the cultured east, wild west, south, and the Eskimo in the canoe.\n\nWhitman has a way of identifying with all Americans. Whitman sees himself in terms of others. He sees himself as a representative of America. He sees himself as universal.\n\nOne can become universal by writing about himself.\n\nWhen Walt Whitman sings the Song of Myself, he is singing the song of Americans.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson wrote a letter to Whitman in 1852. Emerson was embarrassed to find the letter he had written to Whitman in Whitmans book.\n\nWalt Whitman was much unlike the other authors and poets of this genre, especially Emily Dickinson.\n\nSelections From \"Song of Myself\"\n\nSelection #1\n\nNotice the first word, I, and the last word in selection #52, you. Here, Whitman reveals a relationship between himself and the readers.\n\nWhitman is celebrating America and her diversity. Diversity is something that causes a great deal of concern among people. The Puritans did not come to America in search of diversity because they were intolerant of anyone who was different. However, America became diverse in later years. There is regional diversity now. The South is diverse from state to state. Even north Louisiana and its people and cultures are much different from that of south Louisiana. Whitman celebrates the idea that we can have diversity in American and still remain our individual selves. Whitman is against conformity.\n\nThe grass is characteristic of a tall tree standing in a field. The tree is viewed in the way of a monarch. The ironic symbolism here is that the blades of grass are all equal in height, referring to Americans as being equal to one another.\n\nI celebrate myself, and sing myself,\n\nAnd what I assume you shall assume,\n\nFor every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.\n\nBy celebrating himself, Whitman is celebrating all of us. The atom is an element of someone else. When we breath atoms in which other people have exhaled.\n\nI loafe and invite my soul,\n\nI lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.\n\nContrary to the Puritan ethics, Whitman is going to loafe and be lazy. He is going to contemplate.\n\nMy tongue, every atom of my blood, formd from this soil, this air,\n\nBorn here of parents born here from parents the same, and their parents the same,\n\nWhitman is a middle-aged man before he begins to print his poetry. His motive for writing poetry will not be the schools of thought as the enlightenment would think. Instead, Whitman says \"I am writing what nature tells me to.\"\n\nWhitman's style of poetry was different from those before him. There is no rhyme or specific meters to his poem, it is dtrictly natural. Whitman writes with the American voice which he calls our barbaric yaw. That is the American style of speaking. He is similar to Twain in that he uses a wide range of lines, short and long.\n\nSelection #4\n\nIt is not really know as to what sexual preferences Walt Whitman endured. However, he was never married and he did live with his mother.\n\nThe real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love,\n\nThe sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or ill-doing or loss or lack of money, or depressions, or exaltations,\n\nBattles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful news, the fitful events;\n\nThese come to me days and nights and go from me again,\n\nBut they are not the Me myself.\n\nWhitman sounds much like Ralph Waldo Emerson here. We divide the universe between me and not me.\n\nWhitman is calls the civil war a \"fratricidal war\" because it was brother against brother. Fratricide is the killing of your own brother.\n\nApart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am,\n\nStands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary,\n\nLooks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest,\n\nLooking with side-surved head curious what will come next,\n\nBoth in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it.\n\nHere, Whitman states that he has tendencies to be in and out of the game. Whitman confesses there is always that part of him that is separate and distinct. He is not totally in the game; He is at the side observing.\n\nHe is not arguing what he believes or what others believe. Whitman is saying, \"This is my vision...can you see it? And if you can, come and join with me...\"\n\nSelection #5\n\nI believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you,\n\nAnd you must not be abased to the other.\n\nWhitman believes that there are two parts to the soul; one is the body, and the other is the soul. Abase means to humble yourself and bow down to others. He believes that the body should not bow down to the soul. Anne Bradstreet believed the soul to be supreme, which is very similar to the \"oversoul\" concept. Edward Taylor in \"Meditation #8\" says, \"Where the soul ws the bird and the body in the cage.\" Whitman did not possess this belief. He believes the self is in hemeostasis where the soul is equal to the body. Whitman applies the theory of democracy to the self. If the self is democracy, then everything within that democracy must be equal including the body and soul. \"Loafe with me on the grass my soul,\" is an apostrophe. Normally, one would think of an apostrope as punctuation mark. The punctuation mark shows that there is a missing letter. Here, Whitman is stating that someone of something is missing.\n\nOnly the lull I like, the hum of your vavled voice.\n\nI mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning,\n\nHow you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turnd over upon me,\n\nAnd parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, an plunged your tongue to my bare-striped heart,\n\nAnd reachd til you felt my beard, and reachd till you held my feet.\n\nWhitman is being intimate with his soul here.\n\nSwiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth,\n\nAnd I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,\n\nAnd I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,\n\nAnd that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women my sisters and lovers,\n\nAnd that a kelson of the creation is love,\n\nAnd limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,\n\nAnd brown ants in the little wells beneath them,\n\nAnd mossy scabs of the worm fence, heapd stones, elder, mullein and pokeweed.\n\nThis is Whitman's way of saying, \"We are all in this together, my soul and the universe.\"\n\nSelection # 6\n\nA child said What is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands;\n\nHow could I answer the child? I do not know it is any more than he.\n\nWhat is the grass? Well, I can't really answer that. So, whats this book all about? I can't answer that.\n\nI guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven.\n\nIt is my optimism.\n\nOr I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,\n\nA scented gift and remembrance designedly dropt,\n\nBearing the owners name somewhere in the corners, that we may see and remark, and say Whose?\n\nGod has dropped his hankie on the grass so that others will see that he has been there.\n\nGrowing among black folks as among white,\n\nKanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive them the same.\n\nWe are all equal. Here is the poetic form of the expression \"All men are created equal.\"\n\nAnd now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.\n\nThe smallest sprout show there is really no death,\n\nAnd if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to arrest it,\n\nAnd ceasd the moment life appeard.\n\nFor Whitman, death is part of the cycle of life. The sprout shows there really is no death; though we might die, life goes on. The grass is part of life enduring.\n\nSelection # 11\n\nTwenty-eight young men bathe by the shore,\n\nTwenty-eight young men and all so friendly;\n\nTwenty-eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome.\n\nWhitman is showing how voyeurism is popular. We are watching her watch them. This woman is a spinster who is over the hill, unmarried, and who has no children. She daydreams she is out there with them. The swimmers do not know she is out there because it is only in her mind.\n\nSelection # 12\n\nWhitman is watching the butcher and writing what he sees.\n\nWhitman is the poet of everything. Poets in the past wrote only about great and famous things. Whitman believes not only the butcher and the blacksmith are worthy enough to write about, but also, he beleives we all are worthy enough to write about. Since Whitman is the poet of America and democracy, he writes about us wherever we may be.\n\nSelection # 16\n\nI am of old and young, of the foolish as mush as the wise,\n\nRegardless of others, ever regardful of others,\n\nMaternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,\n\nStuffd with the stuff that is coarse and stuffd with the stuff that is fine,\n\nOne of the Nation of many nations, the smallest the same and the largest the same.\n\nWhitman shows here that he thinks about others but he is still separate because of his own diversity.\n\nI resist anything better than my own diversity,\n\nBreathe the air but leave plenty after me,\n\nAnd am not stuck up, and am in my place.\n\nHes not stuck up; an idiom that is pretty old.\n\nSelection # 20\n\nWhat is a man anyhow? what am I? what are you?\n\nWhitman is writing about himself; he is mystical and naked.\n\nWhy should I pray? why should I venerate and be ceremonious?\n\nWho would I pray to if I prayed? The universe is writing me a letter; and all I have to figure out is what it is saying.\n\nSelection # 22\n\nI am not the poet of goodness only, I do not decline to be the poet of wickedness also.\n\nWhat blurt is this about virtue and about vice?\n\nEvil propels me and reform of evil propels me, I stand indifferent,\n\nMy gait is no fault-finders or rejecters gait,\n\nI moisten the roots of all that has grown.\n\nWhitman writes about both the modern view of good and evil vs. the traditional view, which is to reject evil and cleave to good. He says its all part of life and that we should celebrate it.\n\nSelection # 24\n\nWhen the book Walt Whitman first came out, there was no name on the front cover. This selection was the only place in the book that it was mentioned.\n\nNo more modest than immodest.\n\nUnscrews the locks from the doors!\n\nUnscrews the doors themselves from their jambs!\n\nWhitman is saying that he does not need a door. You can watch him do whatever he pleases.\n\nI speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of democracy,\n\nBy God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms.\n\nThis is not a secret to society. Whitman is giving voice to democracy.\n\nVoices of cycles of preparation and accretion,\n\nAnd of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs and of the father-stuff,\n\nAnd of the rights of them the others are down upon,\n\nOf the deformd, trivial, flat, foolish, despised,\n\nFog in the air, beetles rolling in balls of dung.\n\nWhitman is thinking of other things that people do not usually think about. He says that he will take the indecent ideas that other people will not write about and make them decent with his own poetic ability.\n\nI keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart,\n\nCopulation is no more rank to me than death is.\n\nI believe in the flesh and the appetites,\n\nSeeing, hearing, felling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a miracle.\n\nIn Whitman's generation, people would talk about death but not sex. However, in our generation, we talk about sex and not death. Sex has become a taboo.\n\nOne can find divinity in himself through his own experiences, not in someone else's words, practices, or creeds.\n\nI dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious,\n\nEach moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy,\n\nI cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor the cause of the friendship I take again.\n\nWhitman dotes on himself, not on something else.\n\nSelection # 25\n\nWhitman is frustrated at his inability to express himself.\n\nSelection # 32\n\nWhitman is studying nature and finding what he wants to find there.\n\nThey do not sweat and whine about their condition,\n\nThey do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,\n\nThey do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,\n\nNot one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of owning things,\n\nNot one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago,\n\nNot one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.\n\nHere Whitman is saying that he wants to be like the animals who you never hear whine or groan. He does not want to bow and scrape to others or to be unhappy.\n\nSelection # 41\n\nWhitman gives a critique of all the old religions.\n\nMagnifying and applying come I,\n\nOutbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters,\n\nTaking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah,\n\nLithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson,\n\nBuying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha,\n\nIn my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf, the crucifix engraved,\n\nWith Odin and the hideous-faced Mexitli and every idol and image,\n\nTaking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more,\n\nAdmitting they were alive and did the work of their days,\n\n(They bore mites as for unfledgd birds who have now to rise and fly and sing for themselves.)\n\nWhitman is stating that all of these gods had their place in the past. He mixes Christianity in with all the religions.\n\nNot objecting to special revelations, considering a curl of smoke or a hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any revelation.\n\nA special revelation is a burning bush, whereas a general revelation is just simply a bush.\n\nWhitman belived that the hair on the back of his hand was just as special as the burning bush.\n\nSelection # 45\n\nMy lovers suffocate me,\n\nCrowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin,\n\nJostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to me at night,\n\nCrying by day Ahoy! from the rocks of the river, swinging and chirping over my head.\n\nWhitman is filled with much agony. Once again, he sees himself as one of everything.\n\nSelection # 48\n\nI have said that the soul is not more than the body,\n\nAnd I have said that the body is not more than the soul,\n\nAnd nothing, not God, is greater to one than ones self is,\n\nAnd whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own funeral drest in his shroud.\n\nHere, Whitman is stating that one's self is greater than anything. He reitterates the point that the soul and the body are equal.\n\nI hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the least,\n\nNor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself.\n\nWhitman is stating that he believes in pantheism, the idea that God is a part of everyone and everything.\n\nWhitman believes that you do not have to hold on to the revelation because the next step will bring a new revelation.\n\n\"Crossing Brooklyn Ferry\"\n\nHere Whitman is on a ferry writing to us a letter in the past.\n\nIn poetry, a sunset is incorporated as a strong symbol for death. He is returning home a hundred year journey, realizing that people will still enjoy the sunset and the tide.\n\nSelection # 2\n\nPeople are similar to Whitman in that we can indentify with everyone. It is hard for many to realize that previous generations were similar to us today.\n\nSelection # 5\n\nWhere do we get our identity? The Puritans believed that the real identity is in the soul; once we die, our identity, or soul, will return to heaven or somewhere else. Our identity will continue and not be limited to the body. Whitman believes that our identity comes from within. If you change the body, you change the identity. If you destroy the body, you destroy the soul.\n\nSelection # 6\n\nWhitman questions what he is doing in this selection.\n\nIt is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,\n\nThe dark threw its patches down upon me also,\n\nThe best I had done seemd to me blank and suspicious,\n\nMy great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in reality meagre?\n\nNor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil,\n\nI too knitted the old knot of contrariety,\n\nBlabbd, blushd resented, lied, stole, grudgd,\n\nWas wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant,\n\nThe wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me,\n\nThe chearing look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not wanting,\n\nRefusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these wanting,\n\nWas one with the rest, the days and haps of the rest,\n\nWas calld by my nighnest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me approaching or passing,\n\nFelt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as I sat,\n\nSaw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet never told them a word,\n\nLived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping,\n\nPlayd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress,\n\nThe same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like,\n\nOr as small as we like, or both great and small.\n\nWhitman beleives the ulitmate sin is not speaking to and not being with the ones you love. This is what he celebrates, and he says he fell short of it.\n\nSelection # 9\n\nYou necessary film, continue to envelop my soul,\n\nAbout my body for me, and your body for you, be hung our divinist aromas,\n\nThrive, cities--bring your freight, bring your show, ample and sufficient rivers,\n\nExpand, being than which none else is pehaps more spiritual,\n\nKeep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting.\n\nWhitman does not mind the odors which people carry due to a lack of bathing.\n\nWhitman also states that the cities are the most spiritual things of all.\n\nHe is arguing about the existance of God. Whitman believes God to be an unreal person which nothing greater can be imagined. Howver, Whitman believes himself to be greater because he is real.\n\n\"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\"\n\n\"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\" is a poem about Abraham Lincoln.\n\nLincolns name is not mentioned; there is only an image of Lincoln which revolves around the Trinity. We normally think of the Trinity as it is used in church. The Trinity refers to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, which is from the Eastern Orthodox Christian theology.\n\nAbraham Lincoln was shot in Ford's Theater on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, by John Willkes Booth. Lincoln died saving his people, as did Jesus. This is why many view Lincoln as a Christ-like figure.\n\nIn the poem, the Trinity is symbolized by are star, lilacs, and thrush, which replaces thought as the third symbol of the Trinity. The star represents Abraham Lincoln. The lilacs represent the continuation of life after death. The thrush represents Whitman and his poetic attempt at dealing with death.\n\nWhen lilacs last in the dooryard bloomd,\n\nAnd the great star early droopd in the western sky in the night,\n\nI mournd, and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring.\n\nEver-returning spring, trinity sure to me you bring,\n\nLilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west,\n\nAnd thought of him I love.\n\nWhitman states in his writing that he could never smell lilacs again without remembering Lincolns death.\n\nNeither Whitman nor his mother could eat due to sadness. This was also the feeling across the nation.Whitman believes that there are five stages of grief:\n\nGrief\n\nDenial\n\nBargaining\n\nDepression\n\nAcceptance.\n\nSelection # 3\n\nWhitman breaks of a sprig of the lilac. When Whitman refers to the star in the Trinity he is referring to Venus, the evening star. He is identifying Lincoln with the evening star which symbolizes death.\n\nElevating the dead to the level of divinity is called stellification. Deification or apothesis is the process of becoming a god.\n\nSolitary the thrush,\n\nThe hermit withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements,\n\nSings by himself a song.\n\nSong of the bleeding throat,\n\nDeaths outlet song of life, (for well dear brother I know,\n\nIf thou wast not granted to sing thou wouldst surely die.)\n\nWithout the ability to express grief, you will die. Grief is noted as a song which pains you to sing, one which if do not sing you will die. One's who express greif will get over it quicker than those who do not.\n\nStanza #5 is all one sentence. A coffin is the subject of this sentence and journeying is the verb.\n\nImagine seeing a movie. At the opening of the movie, what do you see? Where is the camera? Where is the camera when he starts this first line in this stanza? You are way up in the sky looking down, and slowly you are zooming in on something, the coffin.\n\nLincoln was carried across the country in a coffin. Cities along the funeral procession were draped in black.\n\nHere, coffin that slowly passes,\n\nI give you my sprig of lilac.\n\nWhitman broke off a sprig of lilac and put it on the coffin.\n\nAn affirmation of the continuation of life\n\nIn lines 119-125, Whitman begins talking about the knowledge of death.\n\nHe states that holding hands with death is a way of accepting it. At first you are sad and upset, but then you begin to understand.\n\nDeath is the always ready to receive us dark mother--always waiting to receive us, which will embrace us last.\n\nIn stanza #15, Whitman talks about the suffering in death, and how there are worse things than that. Whitman believes the dead do not suffer; only the living suffer.\n\nI cease from my song for thee,\n\nFrom my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee, O comrade lustrous with silver face in the night.\n\nOnce again, the star is in its rightful place, the sky. The star, Lincoln, is now looking down upon us.\n\nFor the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands--and this for his dear sake,\n\nLilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul,\n\nThere in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim.\n\nWhitman ends on a note which is one of acceptance. One can see the sorrow of this occurance unlike the other poems by Whitman where he dotes on himself.\n\n\"The Wound-Dresser\"\n\nChildren asks Whitman what he did in the war and he answers them by saying he was a medic. He watches over and soothes the dying. By recollecting upon this, he reexeperiences this traumatic event.\n\nIn stanza #2, Whitman is changing the dressing on the wounds, filling bucket after bucket\n\nI onward go, I stop,\n\nWith hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds,\n\nI am firm with each, the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable,\n\nOne turns to me his appealing eyes--poor boy! I never knew you,\n\nYet I think I could not refuse this moment to die for you, if that would save you.\n\nYou must be firm with these men to change their wounds or dressings; Hopefully, you can save their lives, and save them pain in the mean time.\n\nIn stanza #3, death is the only thing that will heal this poor man who has not been able to bring himself to look at the stump where his hand once was.\n\nWhitman feels a burning sensation inside, but outside, he must remain calm and comfort these people.\n\nThus in silence in dreams projections,\n\nReturning, resuming, I thread my way through the hospitals,\n\nThe hurt and wounded I pacify with soothing hand,\n\nI sit by the restless all the dark night, some are so young,\n\nSome suffer so much, I recall the experience sweet and sad,\n\n(Many a soldiers loving arms about this neck have crossd and rested,\n\nMany a soldiers kiss dwells on these bearded lips.)\n\nWhitman experiences flashbacks in the final stanza."
