        "text": "Abstract\n\nThree galley proof sheets of Walt Whitmans's prose piece \"Death of Abraham Lincoln\" with an Arlington Hotel envelope upon which William E. Barton has written a note about these sheets. The sheets do not include the complete piece. Whitman delivered the full lecture on Lincoln in 1879, 1880, and 1881, and it was later published in Whitman's prose collection, \"Specimen Days & Collect.\" The envelope contains the pin that Whitman used to pin the sheets together. It is unclear if the envelope belonged to Whitman or Barton."
