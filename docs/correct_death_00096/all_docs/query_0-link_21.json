        "text": "They ate cake, toured his former home and--of course--read poems to mark Walt Whitman’s 203rd birthday.\n\nThe celebration, held on Wednesday and hosted by the Walt Whitman Association, takes place annually at the famed poet’s Camden home, but during the pandemic was moved to Harleigh Cemetery, where Whitman is buried.\n\nIt was at his Camden home that Whitman produced some of his most notable works, including revisions to the collection “Leaves of Grass,” his most acclaimed writing. That collection inspired a letter from Ralph Waldo Emerson, who wrote, “I find it the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom America has yet contributed.”\n\nWhitman, who was born in Long Island and raised in Brooklyn, never planned on moving to New Jersey.\n\n“Camden was originally an accident,” he wrote, “but I shall never be sorry I was left over in Camden. It has brought me blessed returns.”\n\nThe celebration in Camden of his birthday, which is May 31, noted that Whitman was more than a poet.\n\nHe was a journalist, and after tending to his brother, who was wounded in the Civil War, Whitman decided to stay on for the duration of the war and volunteered as a nurse. At the time, there was no formal nursing profession. Whitman offered the soldiers emotional support, as well, and wrote letters on their behalf to their loved ones.\n\nKeynote speaker Maya Sorini, of Maywood, told the more than two dozen guests, “You can be like Walt Whitman. You can be a poet and.”\n\nSorini spoke from experience.\n\nAs a clinical researcher in trauma surgery research and, now, a first-year medical student at Hackensack Meridian Health, she has worked in hospitals with critically ill patients. Sorini, too, was deeply affected by the experience, as was Whitman, a writer who unflinchingly dealt with the darkest aspects of the human condition.\n\n“Like Whitman’s, my patients came in with gunshot wounds to the chest,” Sorini said. “Like Whitman, I stood as a sentinel as some of them died. [And as happened to] Whitman, the things I saw began to burrow inside of me.”\n\nSorini, who is also a poet and holds a master’s degree from Columbia University in Narrative Medicine, which teaches telling stories about health and wellness, sought to encourage high school students in attendance who were winners in the Walt Whitman Association’s 2022 Poetry Contest. The theme of this year’s contest was “Caring.”\n\nAcknowledging their own likely individual hardships--including living through the pandemic--Sorini told them, “Make the poems real... Whatever you do, keep writing.\n\n“Instead of becoming calloused in the face of great suffering, Whitman teaches us there is another way,” she said. “The way of the poet.”\n\nJenna Delmar, a senior at Kingsway Regional High School in Gloucester County, was awarded first place for her poem “Greenhouse,” a fitting title and theme for Walt Whitman, whose work “Song of Myself” celebrates nature and humanity’s place within it.\n\nDelmar said she was inspired by a little garden her parents have always maintained in their backyard. She would watch them work it year after year and would even pitch in herself at times.\n\n“It kind of made me think of how plants need nurturing,” she said “and how people need nurturing, too.”\n\nThe Walt Whitman House is located across from the Camden County Justice Complex at 330 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, which was known as Mickle St. during Whitman’s time there.\n\nThe modest wood-frame structure, built in 1848, was the only home Whitman ever owned. He lived there from 1884 to his death in 1892.\n\nThere remain four attached houses on the block, with a visitor’s center next door.\n\nA National Historic Landmark, the house and other buildings are owned and managed by the New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry.\n\nAn extensive renovation project underway for the block includes plans for an expanded visitor’s center, landscaping, handicapped accessibility, archiving space, and renovation of the house on the east end of the block, the Stephen Decauter Button House.\n\nButton was a well-known 19th-century area architect credited with the design of the recently restored Arch Street Presbyterian Church.\n\nHe also designed many of Cape May’s finest hotels and homes after the devastating fire of 1878.\n\n“For a city that has lost so much of its architecture, having the home of a notable architect restored so we can interpret the built environment of Camden will be very, very important,” said Leo Blake, curator of the Walt Whitman House.\n\n“We are really fortunate to have this little jewel here in Camden, that has managed to survive for many years, going all the way back to the early 1920s,” he added. “That’s when it was established as a memorial to Whitman.”\n\nWalt Whitman, who was born in Long Island, and raised in Brooklyn, hadn’t planned on moving to New Jersey. “Camden was originally an accident,” he wrote. \" but I shall never be sorry I was left over in Camden. It has brought me blessed returns.”\n\nScroll for more photos:\n\nPlease subscribe now and support the local journalism YOU rely on and trust."
