        "text": "Walt Whitman House\n\n328 Mickle Boulevard Camden, New Jersey\n\nFree Admission\n\nDonations welcome üôÇ\n\nA bridge has been named after him‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs written some famous pieces of work‚Ä¶ and he‚Äôs considered one of Camden‚Äôs most notable residents of all time‚Ä¶\n\nTo be honest, I never knew much about this man. I am not one or was into poetry, but I have heard about his great legacy and his life intrigued me.\n\nA lot of folks think Walt was born and raised in the Camden area. However, he wasn‚Äôt.\n\nWalt Whitman was born in Huntington, Long Island, in 1819, and attended public school there until he was thirteen. Whitman had no access to books until later in life.\n\nIn 1833, at 22 years of age, he entered his career in the printing business. In 1839, Walt started his own company called, ‚ÄúLong Islander.‚Äù\n\nHis duties for his own company were as follows; proprietor, editor, compositor, pressman and carrier, oh and he also delivered his paper by horseback. It was a small operation as one would say ahem‚Ä¶very small.\n\nIn 1855, his writings began to be noticed by the poetic and newspaper world. In 1861, he ran into Abraham Lincoln in New York and this encounter was a huge inspiration for him.\n\nIn 1865, Whitman wrote President Lincoln‚Äôs famous burial hymn and Oh! Captain, My Captain.\n\nThe poem goes as this‚Ä¶\n\nO Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,\n\nThe ship has weather‚Äôd every rack, the prize we sought is won,\n\nThe port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,\n\nWhile follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;\n\nBut O heart! heart! heart!\n\nO the bleeding drops of red,\n\nWhere on the deck my Captain lies,\n\nFallen cold and dead.\n\nO Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;\n\nRise up‚Äîfor you the flag is flung‚Äîfor you the bugle trills,\n\nFor you bouquets and ribbon‚Äôd wreaths‚Äîfor you the shores a-crowding,\n\nFor you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;\n\nHere Captain! dear father!\n\nThe arm beneath your head!\n\nIt is some dream that on the deck,\n\nYou‚Äôve fallen cold and dead.\n\nMy Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,\n\nMy father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,\n\nThe ship is anchor‚Äôd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,\n\nFrom fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;\n\nExult O shores, and ring O bells!\n\nBut I with mournful tread,\n\nWalk the deck my Captain lies,\n\nFallen cold and dead.\n\nHe ended is career in 1865 and wrote notable works as ‚ÄúDrum Taps‚Äù and ‚ÄúSequel to Drum Taps‚Äù. Walt became a nurse and attended to the many wounded soldiers. He also worked for the Government as a clerk.\n\nAfter the disabled Whitman suffered from a stroke, he credits the Stafford family with saving his life. He visited them at their New Jersey home at Timber Creek and it is where he found the natural beauty healing of his ailments.\n\nIn 1874, he moved to Camden, New Jersey. He pursued his poetic work and has become famous worldwide.\n\nWhitman was pretty much confined to his bedroom, but he continued to write and revise his work in his final years. People loved him. Walt was known for a marked trait and his personality was vibrant.\n\nHarry Stafford a short and skinny man of about eighteen years old was his caretaker and was known to carry Walt Whitman around on his back. There are reports of Whitman dining and entertaining guests with my secret lover‚Ä¶ Billy ‚Äúthe Duke‚Äù Thompson of Gloucester City fame. Whitman was often invited to Gloucester City for The Duke‚Äôs famous Shad dinners.\n\nAs quoted by Whitman, ‚ÄúCamden was originally an accident, but I shall never be sorry I was left over in Camden. It has brought me blessed returns.‚Äù\n\nHe died in Camden in 1892. He was placed in a beautiful tomb at Harleigh Cemetery.\n\nThe Whitman association is dedicated to preserving his legacy and it clearly shows.\n\nTouring the house on Mickle Street in these modern times, the past intertwines with the present. The house comes alive with the feeling of Walt Whitman all around you. His shoes and books still scattered throughout his bedroom, as if he merely just went for a walk for an hour or two and will be arriving back shortly. It‚Äôs a beautiful home dedicated to the life of an ingenious man. It should be on everyone‚Äôs South Jersey bucket list and am honored to have toured the home with the curator himself, Leo Blake.\n\nThis is a motto I have lived by for the last decade, however, I never knew it was Whitman who said it‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄúKeep your face always toward the sunshine ‚Äì and shadows will fall behind you.‚Äù\n\nUntil our Next Adventure, My Friends! -The Yummygal"
