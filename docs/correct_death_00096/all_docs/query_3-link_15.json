        "text": "CAMDEN — Camden, Walt Whitman said, brought him \"blessed returns.\"\n\nThe poet, writer and American icon, during his life and in the many years since his death, has returned those blessings.\n\nHis words are etched in the stone of Camden's City Hall, and his earthly remains are interred in its most famous cemetery. His likeness is all over Camden, from the \"City Invincible\" mural on the Admiral Wilson Boulevard to the bust in the lobby at City Hall. The only home he ever owned is carefully preserved, a downtown landmark that draws visitors to Camden from around the world.\n\nAnd his imprint, his influence and his legacy are still strong in the city where he spent most of his final two decades.\n\nThat legacy will be celebrated in Camden, Philadelphia and elsewhere with a series of events marking Whitman's 200th birthday.\n\nMore: Whitman@200: NJ, NY and PA pay tribute to Walt Whitman with hundreds of events\n\nMore: In his footsteps: Places to get closer to Walt Whitman\n\nMore: Walt Whitman: Gay icon, yes; 'Dracula's' muse, maybe\n\nCamden, by accident\n\n\"Camden was originally an accident,\" the poet wrote. \"But I shall never be sorry I was left over in Camden.\"\n\nThe \"accident\" was his mother's illness, and while Whitman may have come to Camden in 1873 not intending to stay, by the time his brother George left for Burlington years later, Whitman had made the city his home. He bought a modest Mickle Street house on March 26, 1884 for $1,750. He remained there until he died on March 26, 1892, at the age of 72.\n\nAlthough he was a renowned writer, journalist and poet by the time he arrived in in the city, it was a Camden neighbor, Horace Traubel, who is credited with preserving his legacy and championing his work after his death, explained Leo Blake, curator at the Walt Whitman House.\n\nTraubel befriended Whitman, and found their conversations so engrossing he began taking notes, Blake said. Those notes would evolve into \"Walt Whitman in Camden,'' a nine-volume biography of the poet and the seminal piece of Whitman scholarship. He would also assist Whitman as the poet continued to revise \"Leaves of Grass,'' and, Blake explained, become his de facto literary agent as the poet's health began to fail.\n\nWhitman's other friends in Camden rallied around him as well as age and illness took their toll. They threw a lavish birthday party each year after the poet's death — a tradition that continues to this day, including an art exhibition and reading on May 29 at Rutgers–Camden's Stedman Gallery in honor of his 200th birthday.\n\n\"In my opinion, if it weren't for Camden and his friends here, we wouldn't be celebrating Whitman,\" said Blake.\n\nWhitman was born on Long Island and lived and worked in New York as a journalist and writer. When his brother was wounded in the Civil War, he moved to Washington, D.C. to care for him and remained there for 11 years. He also worked briefly for a newspaper in New Orleans.\n\nBut he chose Camden to live out his final years.\n\n\"This was it ... He was ours,\" said Blake with a smile. Whitman's finished \"Leaves of Grass,'' the defining work of his life, in Camden, and not only chose to be buried in Harleigh Cemetery but had his parents disinterred and moved to his tomb here.\n\n\"He was looking to preserve his legacy in Camden,\" Blake said.\n\nWhitman then and Camden now\n\nAnd just what is that legacy, particularly in the city he ultimately called home?\n\nRocky Wilson, a poet, teacher and Walt Whitman impersonator who has lived in Camden since 1975, recalled lines from \"Song of Myself\":\n\nThe spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me — he complains of my gab and my loitering.\n\nI too am not a bit tamed — I too am untranslatable;\n\nI sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.\n\nHe sat on a rock near Whitman's grave, watching a hawk swoop over the cemetery, and asked, \"How does that happen, when Walt shows up, the hawk shows up? What is the connection between nature, the grass, the hawk, river? It's all one, isn't it?\n\n\"Whitman tried to show us that.\"\n\nWhitman, Blake said, was a working-class writer, albeit one with many famous friends. Still, he spent a lot of his time interacting with Camden's ordinary people, talking to workers on the waterfront, conversing with travelers who stopped in the city on their way to Philadelphia, New York or Atlantic City.\n\n\"Whitman was so diverse in his outlook,\" Blake said. \"He was concerned about his work reaching the common, working people. The story of Camden doesn't fall out of place with who Whitman was.\n\n\"He saw when he was here much of what an American city would have been at that time: the industrialization that was here was just exploding, yet the people ... He lived on a little side street and he loved the people who lived in the neighborhood, he loved going to the waterfront and talking to the ferryhands and the riverboat captains. That was who he was.\"\n\nWhitman celebrated ordinary people in his poetry, something that was rare for its time: He wrote about prostitutes and poor people, the enslaved and the oppressed, said Wilson, though Whitman's views of slavery and African Americans were inconsistent and still a subject of debate today.\n\n\"He celebrated everybody, not just the hottie-totties, not just the beautiful people,\" he said. \"He celebrated everyone, and that's what Camden is about.\"\n\nCamden was a city on the rise in Whitman's time.\n\nIt has seen long periods of decline and fall, and now is showing signs of rising again.\n\n\"The change that's happening here, that's something Whitman would have been right in the middle of,\" Blake said. \"He would have been writing about it.\"\n\nWhitman's outlook on life, and on American ideals, would likely have framed his view of Camden today, Blake believes.\n\n\"A sense of optimism is something that's key to his work, that no matter how bad it could get — and in some periods it really did — his story was really to survive here in Camden.\"\n\nThe house's own survival in a city that has seen riot, ruin and decay is symbolic of the poet who survived strokes but bounced back more than once, Blake said.\n\n\"This house still survived because people here thought it was important enough to save. And now, we're part of this, what's happening here in Camden,\" with plans for further restoration of other houses next door and bringing greater awareness to the Walt Whitman House itself.\n\n\"Whitman's foresight and vision spoke to us as a future audience and our potential value and goodness based on just being human,\" said Eric Powell, a Camden native, entrepreneur and engineer. \"Through his work, he always infused a sense of hope.\"\n\nWhitman was \"an icon who believed in the City of Camden,\" said Juan R. Rodriguez, a minister and Camden resident. \"He believed that the city was full of inspiration and possibility, just like many of its residents today.\"\n\nInspiring art\n\nWalt Whitman, said Blake, was many things: a journalist who never stopped thinking of himself as one, who brought a reporter's eye for detail into his poetry and prose; a sage and to some even a prophet whose work seemed to predict the upheaval of the early 20th century; a naturalist who reminded a rapidly industrializing nation what it meant to smell lilacs and sit in \"a field where the unmow’d grass grows.\"\n\nHe was also \"a great bridge between history and the arts,\" a poet who documented in exquisite detail a changing, surging nation, said Blake.\n\n\"He's documenting everything, and that makes his work a window into the past. He was the poet, the champion, of American democracy.\"\n\nHis influence extends beyond the literary realm: Whitman's work is infused with beauty, humanity and nature, all the things that make great art.\n\n\"Many creative people in Camden have been inspired by Whitman,\" said William Butler, an artist and Iowa native who came to Camden with his family eight years ago.\n\nMore: Poem in Your Pocket Day: 'Song of Myself' (Verse 52) by Walt Whitman\n\nButler, co-chair of Camden's Arts, Culture and Heritage Commission, used Whitman's \"Leaves of Grass'' as his guide when he helped create the City Invincible mural, giant letters spelling out the poet's famous phrase that is now on the side of a warehouse on the Admiral Wilson Boulevard on the way into Camden.\n\n\"We moved here eight years ago, and of course you hear about these legendary writers and artists, photographers and historical figures,\" said Butler. \"When you're not from the land they walked on, it's a distant association. It's like thinking about the Bible without visiting the Holy Land or the Greeks without seeing the Parthenon. How do you get your mind around Van Gogh without being where he's been?\"\n\nBeing in Camden, and experiencing the Walt Whitman House, can bring a greater understanding of the man and his work, and also help unleash creative inspiration, Butler believes.\n\n\"When you have a personal experience with something, whether it's a song you hear or an article you read or a story or a painting you see, there's something transcendent in the creative aspect of that work. And being where Whitman went before, some of that transcendence leaches into the creative aspects of all our work.\"\n\nWhitman was more than a distant figure, Butler believes, and more than the stoic, bearded bust that often represents him today.\n\n\"I have a sense there was a funny way about him that you don't see, but he had such a love of people and nature,\" Butler said. \"There's a twinkle in his eye in photographs that says, I'm about about tell a really funny joke, and you can be in on it.' \"\n\nThe poet brought that \"creative cheekiness\" into his work, and it's something that can still inspire creative people today, Butler believes.\n\nCyril Reade, an associate professor of fine arts at Rutgers–Camden, curated the works that will be on display at the Stedman Gallery next month.\n\nHe said Tyler Hoffman, a Rutgers–Camden professor who wrote American Poetry in Performance: From Walt Whitman to Hip Hop, collected works inspired by the poet.\n\n\"I was surprised at the artwork he found,\" said Reade, noting that Hoffman is an English professor. \"There are so many artists working in different media who still find Whitman very inspiring. There must be something magical that stems from his poetry, something that still speaks to people today.\"\n\nHe used a metaphor for Whitman's creative legacy in Camden that might make the poet proud: \"It's like when you're standing near a flowering tree: Its scent comes to you; it's invisible but you're aware of it nonetheless.\"\n\nWhitman continues to resonate today because, Reade believes, \"he's an American poet and he uses metaphors Americans can understand.\"\n\nA city invincible\n\nWhitman made Camden his home in large part because of the relationships he forged here, and the people he came to love: the housekeeper who became his caretaker, the friend who became his biographer and champion for his work after he died, the ferrymen and families he met as he moved about the city.\n\n\"To walk into that house, and know what a great thinker, poet and writer he was ... to see his chair and think about the condition and culture of the city at the time, to learn about his great love for mankind, and his sense of brotherly love that was just that,\" said Butler.\n\n\"You understand that the 'city invincible' is not about guns and armies. It's a place where people love each other and take care of each other. It's a place where love is real.\"\n\nPhaedra Trethan: @CP_Phaedra; 856-486-2417; ptrethan@gannettnj.com\n\nMORE INFORMATION:\n\nFor a list of events celebrating Walt Whitman's 200th birthday, visit\n\nhttp://waltwhitmaninitiative.org/event/walt-whitman-association-200th-birthday-celebration/, www.whitmanat200.org/events-by-month and http://thewaltwhitmanassociation.org/events/\n\nFor more information about the Walt Whitman House in Camden, visit\n\nhttp://thewaltwhitmanassociation.org/#\n\nAlso in South Jersey:"
