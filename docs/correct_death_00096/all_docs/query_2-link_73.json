        "text": "UNIONVILLE, MONTANA – Walter Leon Whitman Sr. died in his home on Sunday, April 24.\n\nBorn March 7,1943 in West Brookfield, Massachusetts, to Charles L. and Isabel E. Whitman, he lived and worked in the Brookfields and Warren (having served in the U.S. Army from 1964 – 1966) until moving to his Rocky Mountain home in 1978. There he worked for the City of Helena until retirement in 2006.\n\nIn his spare time, he joined with his sons in hunting, fishing and the restoration of antique and classic automobiles, along with enjoying the lifestyle of the cowboys he’d admired since early childhood. In those adventures involving horses and cattle drives he was most joyful when accompanied by his grandson, Dustin.\n\nHe leaves Walt Jr and his wife, Carri, and granddaughters Danielle and Devynn Whitman of Rockford, Washington; son Adam Whitman of Salmon, Idaho; and grandson Dustin Whitman, who lived and grew from his grandfather’s knowledge while lovingly assisting him throughout his final illness.\n\nBesides his children and grandchildren, he leaves brother Charles L. Whitman Jr. and sister Ruth M. Lyon of West Brookfield, and sisters Shirley A. Wilk, Thorndike, MA and Claudia L. Kenady of Orange, CA. He was predeceased by brothers Elwin H, Eltheron L, John T, and Claude E. Whitman, and sister Barbara M. Groves, Blue Anchor, New Jersey.\n\nHe was well known for his knowledge of automobiles and firearms and enduring interest in Western lore and history; all of which he would enthusiastically share with others.\n\nAdditionally, he developed a notable skill as a maker of custom spurs which he would give to his favorite friends.\n\nHe was a devoted friend, brother, father and uncle, and a man of wit and wisdom.\n\nCelebration of life will be held at the Baptist Church hall on the corner of Green Meadow and Sierra Road Saturday April 30 from noon to 3pm. In lieu of flowers, please donate to hospice."
