        "text": "Walt Whitman Timeline\n\nHow It All Went Down\n\nMay 31, 1819\n\nWalt Whitman Born\n\nWalter Whitman Jr. is born in West Hills, New York. He is the second of eight surviving children born to Walter Whitman Sr. and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.\n\nMay 27, 1823\n\nMoves to Brooklyn\n\nThe Whitman family moves to Brooklyn, beginning Walt's love affair with New York City. They move frequently around the borough, and Walt Whitman attends public schools.\n\n1830\n\nLeaves School\n\nEleven-year-old Walt Whitman drops out of school in order to work and earn money for his family. He works as an assistant in the offices of a doctor and a lawyer.\n\n1831\n\nLearns Printing Trade\n\nWhitman gets a job as an apprentice for the Long Island Patriot newspaper. He immediately takes to the profession, and is soon freelancing on his own as a printer and typesetter for local publications.\n\n1833\n\nOn His Own\n\nThe Whitman family leaves Brooklyn and moves back to Long Island, leaving fourteen-year-old Walt to fend for himself in the city.\n\nAug 12, 1836\n\nFire!\n\nWhitman's newspaper trade comes to a halt after a fire destroys the printing district in New York. He rejoins his parents and siblings in Long Island and gets a job as a schoolteacher.\n\n1838\n\nNewspaper Editor\n\nWhitman temporarily leaves teaching to take over the editorship of The Long Islander newspaper. He sells the paper after ten months and returns to teaching.\n\n1841\n\nReturns to the Big Apple\n\nWhitman moves back to New York City. He works in newspapers as both a typesetter and as a freelance writer, contributing fiction pieces and newspaper articles.\n\n1842\n\nFirst Novel Published\n\nWhitman publishes his first novel, Franklin Evans; or The Inebriate. The pro-temperance novel is commercially popular, even though Whitman himself later comes to describe it as \"rot.\"\n\nMar 1846\n\nBrooklyn Daily Eagle\n\nWhitman starts a job as the editor of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle newspaper. His articles there include reviews of early novels by a young writer named Herman Melville and the poems of Ralph Waldo Emerson.\n\nJan 1848\n\nLeaves Eagle\n\nWhitman is forced out of his job at the Brooklyn Daily Eagle after a political dispute with his boss over Whitman's opposition to slavery. He and his brother travel to New Orleans for a few months to work at The Crescent newspaper.\n\nSep 1848\n\nReturn to New York\n\nBack in New York, Whitman founds an antislavery newspaper called the Weekly Freeman. The paper's offices are burned after the first issue is published. For the next six years, he works as a freelance journalist, while honing his poetic style.\n\nMay 12, 1855\n\nLeaves of Grass\n\nWhitman publishes the first edition of Leaves of Grass, a collection of twelve poems written in a bold new style. Readers are shocked and awed by the poems' raw subject material and striking style. Ralph Waldo Emerson sends Whitman a letter praising the book and congratulating him on \"the beginning of a great career.\" 39\n\nJul 11, 1855\n\nFather Dies\n\nWhitman's father Walt Whitman Sr. dies.\n\nSep 1856\n\nSecond Edition\n\nThe second edition of Leaves of Grass is published, now with 32 poems. He also reprints Emerson's congratulatory letter without permission, angering the elder poet. Whitman makes a career out of revising and updating the book, with more than half a dozen editions in his lifetime.\n\nNov 1856\n\nTranscendentalists Visit\n\nWriter Henry David Thoreau and educator Bronson Alcott travel from Concord, Massachusetts to visit Whitman.\n\n1857\n\nNewspaper Editor\n\nWhitman spends two years as the editor for the Brooklyn Daily Times.\n\nApr 12, 1861\n\nCivil War\n\nThe Civil War breaks out. Whitman moves to Washington D.C. and works as a nurse in the military hospitals.\n\nApr 14, 1865\n\nLincoln Assassinated\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln is assassinated at Ford's Theater less than a week after the Confederate surrender. Whitman, now a clerk at the U.S. Department of the Interior, composes the poems \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\" and \"O Captain! My Captain!\" in honor of the fallen president.\n\nJun 30, 1865\n\nFired\n\nWhitman's boss at the Department of the Interior fires him because of the supposedly obscene content of Leaves of Grass, which Whitman works on during his downtime at the office. He immediately gets another job at the U.S. Attorney General's Office.\n\n1866\n\nThe Good Gray Poet\n\nWhitman and his friend William D. O'Connor publish The Good Gray Poet, a defense of Whitman in the wake of his firing from the Interior.\n\n1870\n\nNew Edition\n\nWhitman publishes the fifth edition of Leaves of Grass.\n\nJan 23, 1873\n\nSuffers Stroke\n\nWhitman suffers his first stroke, which leaves him partially paralyzed. It is the first of several serious health problems that Whitman endures in the last twenty years of his life.\n\nMay 23, 1873\n\nMother Dies\n\nFour months after his stroke, Whitman's mother Louisa dies. Walt moves in with his brother George in Camden, New Jersey.\n\nMar 1884\n\nBuys Home\n\nThanks to his earnings from Leaves of Grass, Whitman buys a house on Camden's Mickle Street.\n\nJun 1888\n\nSecond Stroke\n\nWhitman suffers another stroke that causes paralysis. His health is in severe decline, and he redrafts his will."
