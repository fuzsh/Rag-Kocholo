        "text": "Running with Beth‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Walt‚Äù post, I wanted to share a few photos of his grave. As we read, Walt did have a life in Camden, Jersey. I spent a weekend in and near Camden and visited the ‚Äúlarge mausoleum built in Camden‚Äôs Harleigh Cemetery, on a plot given to him in 1885, shortly after the cemetery was opened.‚Äù It is a very holy place, I think. With a little chair inside, it felt alive more alive than not‚Äîprobably exactly the way Walt wanted it.\n\nI felt very lucky to be there with the bright sky and changing leaves. <3 <3 <3 <3\n\nThe Folsom and Price article mentions that others were buried with him: ‚Äú(Eventually, several family members‚ÄìHannah, George, Louisa, Edward, and his parents‚Äîwere reinterred in the same tomb, on which the inscription reads simply ‚ÄúWalt Whitman.‚Äù) You can see portions of the other names in the tomb. Also. The flowers?! The note?! The beautiful picture on the ground with His Kind Eyes?! It reminds me of our discussion about the universality of Walt; he is here, here in our backyards, here under our bootsoles. üòÄ\n\nWeepy :‚Äô)\n\nAlso! Walt woods in Laurel Springs (close to Camden). Apparently he worked on ‚ÄúLeaves of Grass‚Äù here and swam in the creek. The wooden path is engraved with various Walt quotes.\n\nAnyways, if you‚Äôre looking for a literary road trip once the world is Okay, Camden is a must <3."
