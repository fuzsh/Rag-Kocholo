        "text": "Walt Whitman did not see death as an ending, but rather as the beginning of something new. In Song of Myself, he refuses to anticipate death as something negative. Instead he equated it with nature, writing that “the smallest sprout shows there is really no death” (Whitman 126). Whitman did not treat death as a personified object or a metaphor as many authors often do; he wrote of it almost like a process, a continuation. He believed that death was not an end, but rather part of an infinite cycle of life.\n\nThe ease and affinity with which he writes about death are most likely because it was a common familiarity in his own life. During the Civil War, Whitman dedicated himself to volunteering in hospitals to care for wounded soldiers. The courage …show more content…\n\nNo one form of life is better or more valuable than any other, but that all life is “infinite and omnigenous” (698) or belonging to every form of life. His use of imagery painted pictures that blended the three together. One image was that of grass as “the beautiful uncut hair of graves” (110). He also often placed himself among these images, equating his own life with that of nature’s. The first is of his interaction with a stallion of which he wrote that “[the horse’s] nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him” (705). Of his own death, he wrote “I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,/If you want me again look for me under your boot soles” (1338-1339). Whitman is completely at peace with nature and death so much so that he does “not talk of the beginning or the end” (39). Instead, by comparing death and nature, he is talking about everything in between. In Song of Myself, he often makes long lists of scenic moments as if to appreciate the never ending cycle of life and death within human …show more content…\n\nHis belief that death only brings more life are prominent Indian-born religions like Hinduism and Buddhism. Of reincarnation he writes: “and as to Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths,/(No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before)” (1297-1298). While his ideas seem to be seeded in Eastern thought, he was still a writer in America during the transcendentalist period and this is where his ideas of death and nature become blended. In his poem, “When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom’d”, he shares his fascination and wonder at plants that die in the fall and come back in the spring. This very much mirrors his idea of human reincarnation. By picturing death as a flower or tree that wilts only to blossom again, Whitman creates a very peaceful depiction of life and dying. He believes that “to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier” (130) because death is only an opportunity at more"
