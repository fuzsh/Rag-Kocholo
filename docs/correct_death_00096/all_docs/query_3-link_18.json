A public viewing of his body was held at his Camden home; more than one thousand people visited in three hours and Whitman’s oak coffin was barely visible because of all the flowers and wreaths left for him. Four days after his death, he was buried in his tomb at Harleigh Cemetery in Camden.\n\n_______________\n\nWALT WHITMAN IS DEAD\n\nWhere are you now?\n\nUncle?\n\nPoet?\n\nWalt?\n\nOld man, child of the Long Island\n\nFree verse son of America,\n\nTeacher & government work-man?\n\n“Human – Being”\n\nCitizen\n\nMan… Mind of the spirit\n\nSpirit, in the flesh\n\nWhere have you gone?\n\nDisappeared\n\nNow a ghost\n\nAmong the leaves,\n\nThe rest.\n\nUncle,\n\nI see your name written in\n\nSchool books and upon the wind\n\nAnd within the rain,\n\nAnd I still hear your songs fill the air\n\nIn the forests & the city streets\n\nBody … Electric.\n\nBut father?\n\nUncle?\n\nWhere are you now?\n\nWhere have you been?\n\nGone, gone away from\n\nWhat you loved most, the land\n\nYet buried beneath the green\n\nGreen meadows, valleys & time\n\nOf ages.\n\nMeditating within the oldest of trees\n\nSilent thru out new ages.\n\nFor a book is merely paper\n\nBut a voice must ask or say\n\nInvoke yea and awaken others from\n\nThe vast darkness & the gray\n\nFor uncle, poetic father,\n\nYour America has sadly changed.\n\nNo longer the free land\n\nOf promise, no longer do we\n\nDream like you once dreamt\n\nWe still fight wars and without hope\n\nFalter & lose ourselves,\n\nSouls within the damned dark & dense.\n\nSo uncle, father.\n\nReturn and sit here for a while\n\nAnd bring some comfort the dying of poets, poetry &\n\nThe young boys, and now women…soldiers,\n\nDecimated in faraway lands\n\nYou never mentioned in your poems\n\nOr ever heard of.\n\nFor it rumored\n\nThat you are dead.\n\nAnd yet?\n\nThe 21st century & centuries to come\n\nMay yet remember thee still,\n\nAnd write your verse upon some wall in yet\n\nAnother revolution coming.\n\nFor it is the same world that\n\nFaces us today Walt Whitman,\n\nOne of a new slavery & lack of, death of spirit\n\nThat you would not begin to comprehend\n\nWhere the poor are now\n\nThe slaves of corporation & debt\n\nAnd prejudice\n\nStill runs rampant…yet hidden\n\nBehind best intentions.\n\nSo would you,\n\nFather, Uncle Walt\n\nStill stand insolent? Defiant?\n\nWould you, Walt Whitman\n\nStill stand up & among the\n\nWorking class?\n\nBut alas,\n\nIt is no longer your time here\n\nBut your heart & soul remain,\n\nFor we, the poets who still struggle\n\nMust create our own new voices & names,\n\nSpeak, of what is now & not of the past\n\nTo audiences not of one land, but many.\n\nSo, Uncle? I owe you an apology.\n\nFor you, Walt Whitman are dead.\n\nA timeless friend\n\nAnd a memory\n\nThat we must let rest\n\nTo create a new vision.\n\nThat one day brings your spirit,\n\nYour uncorrupted vision\n\n“Back”\n\nFor if we miss you in one place?\n\nWe shall search for you\n\nIn another.\n\n__________________"
