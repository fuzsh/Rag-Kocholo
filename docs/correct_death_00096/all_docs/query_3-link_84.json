        "text": "I n 1865, Walt Whitman was in the prime of his life. At 45, the great American poet was already an accomplished literary figure, having published several editions of Leaves of Grass, as well as other works. But even still, 1865 would prove transformative for Whitman: at some point early in the year, he was introduced to Peter Doyle, his longtime friend, lover, and \"Calamus\" muse.\n\nDoyle was just 21 years old when he met Whitman in Washington D.C. – but age wasn't the only dissimilarity in the relationship. While Whitman was a masterful writer and ardent Unionist, Doyle was virtually illiterate, a Confederate veteran and worked as a streetcar conductor. But despite the odds against them, they pair became great companions, a relationship that would last until Whitman's death in 1892.\n\nSotheby's BENT. sale offers an intimate glimpse into Whitman and Doyle's relationship: a presentation copy of Leaves of Grass, inscribed by the poet to his companion on the front flyleaf: \"Peter G. Doyle, from Walt Whitman, Washington, April 29, 1868.\"\n\nThis is the scarce first issue of the fourth edition, including sheets from the first editions of Drum-Taps, Sequel to Drum-Taps, and \"Songs Before Parting,\" all with separate title-pages and pagination. An astonishing association copy, this property is a vital relic of the greatest love of Whitman's life.\n\nDr. R. M. Bucke, one of Whitman's early adherents, edited and published Whitman and Doyle's letters in 1897 as Calamus: A Series of Letters Written During the Years 1868–1880 by Walt Whitman to a Young Friend (Peter Doyle). In an interview with Bucke published in Calamus, Doyle fondly recalled his first meeting with the poet:\n\nWhitman and Doyle were near-constant companions for seven years. Martin Murray has written that the \"effects of [Whitman's] friendship with Doyle may also be seen in the 1867 edition of Whitman's Leaves of Grass\"—that is, the edition from which the present presentation copy derives:\n\nBENT. also includes a fine copy of the first edition of Leaves of Grass from 1855. Of the 795 copies comprising the first edition and printed on the small handpress of the Romes in Brooklyn, only 337 were bound in this, the most ornate of the original cloth bindings.\n\nAlthough Doyle and Whitman were in touch until the latter's death in 1892, they saw less of each other after 1873 when Whitman suffered both the death of his mother and a debilitating stroke, events that led him from Washington back to New York and, eventually, to Camden, New Jersey. That same year, Whitman drew up a will in which he left to Doyle his silver pocket watch; a revised will of 1888 maintained that bequest, but in Whitman's final will, 1892, Doyle was left nothing. He retained all of Walt's letters and postcards, of course, and seems to have received various mementos of Whitman from other of the poet's disciples, Bucke, Horace Traubel, and John Burroughs, who made sure that Doyle was admitted to Whitman's funeral."
