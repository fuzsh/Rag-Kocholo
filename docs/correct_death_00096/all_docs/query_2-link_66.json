When he learned that his brother had been injured at the battle of Fredericksburg in 1862, he traveled to Virginia to care for him. His journey exposed him to the battlefield and its dead and wounded. He decided to move to Washington, D. C. to volunteer as a dresser of wounds and to spend time with soldiers during their convalescence in hospital wards throughout the city. Although he was a sympathizer of the Union cause and wrote several patriotic poems in its favor, his experience with the random carnage of the war tempered his views.

Osler's professional life took him to Philadelphia in 1884 (as Chair of Clinical Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania), Baltimore in 1889 (Physician in Chief at the Johns Hopkins Hospital) and Oxford, England, in 1905 (Regius Chair of Medicine).
