        "text": "Pay a visit to Laurel Springs, in southern Camden County and you can dip your toes in a natural spring and wander near Timber Creek, where Walt Whitman, always happiest among the butterflies and fields of laurel, bathed in his altogether.\n\nYou probably don't want to try skinny dipping now, as there are houses well within sight, but Historic Crystal Springs, with its babbling rivulets, wildflowers and old growth trees, is a beautiful escape from the everyday, especially in spring — and especially if you love poetry.\n\nPreserved with the help of Green Acres funds by Camden County and the borough, the site attracts bird watchers, hikers, families and especially lovers of the written word. Wander among ferns and moss-covered logs, and follow Whitman's Walk — a simple wooden boardwalk periodically etched with the poet's own verse — and lose yourself in nature as Whitman so loved to do.\n\nThe poet loved this place, a balance to his home in the industrial port City of Camden, and it greatly influenced his late work.\n\nMore: Whitman@200: NJ, NY and PA pay tribute to Walt Whitman with hundreds of events\n\nMore: Whitman@200: What does Walt mean to Camden?\n\nMore: Walt Whitman: Gay icon, yes; 'Dracula's' muse, maybe\n\n\"Walt hit it off with a family here and had an open invitation ... He visited, sometimes for long periods,'' says local historian Rich Zimmermann, who was instrumental in preserving and renovating the home. \"He would roll in the laurel and swim and climb in the trees and eat good quality food, and he maintains Mrs. Stafford was responsible for his recovery from a stroke, because of the food the exercise and the family.\n\n\"He did a revision of 'Leaves of Grass' related to hearing Crystal Springs, and he worked some on 'Specimen Days,' one of the early environmental texts ... there is definitely stuff in both that we can identify from this area.''\n\nLaurel Springs had a special place in Whitman's heart but it is just one place you can go to commune with this poet of the people:\n\nWalt Whitman House: The only home he ever owned, this dwelling is where Walt Whitman lived in the latter part of his life, in Camden.

Go: Harleigh Cemetery. 1640 Haddon Ave., Camden. https://www.facebook.com/harleighcemetery/\n\nLaurel Springs: Walk in the footsteps of Whitman while reading his poetry, to the backdrop of the natural spring he found helpful in his recovery and to serve as his muse as he wrote. Whitman was close friends with Montgomery and Hannah Stafford, farmers whose son worked in a print shop in Camden. Whitman stayed often with the Staffords in their farmhouse from 1876 to 1881. While the interior of the house is furnished with donated antiques of that period, you can walk on the same stairs Whitman used to climb and gaze out onto the same laurel and lilacs he loved so well.\n\nThe Whitman Stafford House will host WaltFEST 2019 on June 1 at 3 p.m., sponsored by Laurel Springs Green & Whitman Stafford Committee.\n\nGo: Whitman Walk, Historic Crystal Spring, Laurel Springs Borough Park, 613 Lakeview Ave., Laurel Springs. southjerseytrails.org/2017/09/23/whitmans-walk\n\nGo: Whitman-Stafford House, 315 Maple Ave., Laurel Springs. facebook.com/WhitmanFarmhouseLaurelSprings\n\nWalt Whitman’s Birthplace — What better place to learn about Walt Whitman than the place where it all began?

The poet never crossed it, of course, but the busy bridge is also a symbol of how connected Whitman felt to Philadelphia while he lived in New Jersey, often crossing over to attend opera and other events. There is a movement in Philadelphia to have the bridge painted in rainbow colors to symbolize Whitman's status as a gay icon. A statue of the poet by artist Jo Davidson stands at the intersection of Broad Street and Packer Avenue, Fairmount area of Philadelphia, near the approach to the Walt Whitman Bridge.

The photograph inspired Gionnatti's statue. Of the sea, Whitman wrote: The first and last confession of the globe/ Outsurging, muttering from thy soul's abysms/ The tale of cosmic elemental passion/Thou tellest to a kindred soul in \"With Husky-Haughty Lips, O Sea!.'\n\nGo: https://www.oceangrovenj.com\n\nNew Jersey Hall of Fame - Walt Whitman was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2009.
