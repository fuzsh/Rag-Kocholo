        "text": "1. Walt Whitman Instructor: Bibi Halima Bibi.Halima@uow.edu.pk “Be curious, not judgmental”\n\n2. Biography • Born at West Hill, New York • Second of eight children • Started working in newspaper offices at the age of 11 • Wrote his first article at the age of 12 • Also worked as journalist and newspaper editor • Read important writers of his day i.e., Emerson, Hawthorne and Bryant • Published his first novel, Franklin Evans, in 1842 (1819-92)\n\n3. • Emerson wrote an essay entitled, The Poet in which he called for poetry that represents America, its people, ideas, customs, good, bad, and evils. He clearly stated that, America and Americans are in dire need of a poet who could write for them • The essay acted as catalyst for Whitman; he started writing and said, ‘I was simmering, simmering, simmering; Emerson brought me to the boil” Influence\n\n4. • He travelled to New Orleans in 1848; witnessed the horrors of slavery; started anti-slavery campaigns and wrote political speeches • On his return from New Orleans, he published the first edition of Leaves of Grass. It was unique in both its style and themes • He saw himself as, America’s National Bard (poet)” and worked hard to promoted himself and his poetry Civil War and Whitman\n\n5. Young Whitman dreamt of becoming famous poet finally conquered his dreams when heavenly death whispered in his ears. • He wrote 280 poems including:  For you, O Democracy!  I Hear America Singing!  Native Moments  Spontaneous Me  One Hour of Madness and Joy  A Woman Wait for Me  All is Truth  After the Supper and Talk  Ah Poverties, Wincing, and Sulky Retreats  Ages and Ages Returning at Intervals Whitman’s Poetry\n\n6. Whitman’s Resting Place Died: March 26, 1892 Camden, New Jersey Whatever satisfies the soul is truth.\n\n7. O Captain! My Captain!Walt Whitman (1819-1892) O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done, The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won, The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting, While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring; But O heart! heart! heart! O the bleeding drops of red, Where on the deck my Captain lies, Fallen cold and dead. O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells; Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills, For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding, For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning; Here Captain! dear father! This arm beneath your head! It is some dream that on the deck, You’ve fallen cold and dead. My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still, My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will, The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done, From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won; Exult O shores, and ring O bells! But I with mournful tread, Walk the deck my Captain lies, Fallen cold and dead.\n\n8. O Me! O Life! Walt Whitman (1819-1892) Oh me! Oh life! of the questions of these recurring, Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill’d with the foolish, Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?) Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew’d, Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me, Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined, The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these, O me, O life? Answer. That you are here—that life exists and identity, That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse\n\n9. Themes in His Poetry Controlling Ideas (The way he thinks) Metaphorical Ideas (Things he write about)\n\n10. Controlling Ideas Unity: For Whitman, “All things are one, all is a procession, the universe is a procession, with measure and beautiful motion, each has his or her place in the procession”. He draws the focus to a commonality that he claims is shared by all of human-kind by forcing readers to see the Larger picture of universe that supersedes physical distinctions. He insists his reader to create One out of many / Unity-within- diversity. Do you not see that these (bodies) are exactly the same to all, in all nations and times, all over The earth? If anything is sacred, the human body is sacred The man’s body is scared, the woman’s body is sacred No matter who it is, it is sacred\n\n11. Controlling Ideas Existence: His poetry is packed with questions of self-identity. He insists his readers to take the uphill journey to explore the purpose of his existence. He keeps asking his readers the questions: Who am I? Who are we? What is this world? What do you matter to this world? What do I mean?\n\n12. Controlling Ideas Connection/contact: Whitman tries to convince his readers that the best way to understand someone or something is to touch it or connect with it. The human contact/connection is the secret of unity in universe. Man is given five senses to understand the world and the sense of touch is the most important one. Use it!\n\n13. Controlling Ideas The “I”, “Me”, “My”: Whitman’s poetry is over brimmed with the character “I” but it is not only poet himself. It is you, it is me, it is the we, it is the nation, it is the world, it is the universe, and it is the everything.\n\n14. Metaphorical Ideas The Human Body: It provides the sense of unity; it is the biggest question; it is the only way to understand the world. The Nature: The natural world The Nation: United States of America and its people Democracy: We are all important and equal, rich and poor, black and white, men and women. He was the first democratic poet of America. Humanism: His poetry lies between Transcendentalism and realism.\n\n15. Style Free Verse: His poetry does not contain any specific meter or rhyme. His experiment with poetic expression display his sense of freedom and energy with life. He is also known as Father of free verse poetry. Yet his poetry is complex and it makes use of a lot of poetic devices. Language: He creates new words, uses words in new ways, and play with sentence structure to create powerful meaning. His usage of language is sometimes shocking for readers for it can make them uncomfortable. Catalogue: He writes the long lists of things and ideas, attempting to capture everything he can think of on a given topic.\n\n16. Quiz • Does the poem O Me! O Life question one’s existence? Explain in what ways it discusses man’s existence. • Recall the poem O Captain! My Captain and identify where in poem poet convince readers that the best way to understand someone or something is to touch it or connect with it. • Relate the concept of Unity-within-diversity with poems read in the class. • What is Whitman’s idea of Humanism?"
