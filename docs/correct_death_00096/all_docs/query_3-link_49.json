        "text": "The papers of poet Walt Whitman (1819-1892) in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection consist of approximately 28,000 items spanning from 1763 to 1985. The bulk of the items date from the 1840s through Whitman's death in 1892, and into the twentieth century. The collection of correspondence, literary manuscripts, books, proofs, and associated items represent periods of Whitman's life from his early time living in New York, middle-age in Washington, D.C., and the last phase of his life in Camden, New Jersey. The papers include primary documentation of Whitman's friends and family; his experience as a civil servant and hospital volunteer in Washington, D.C., during the American Civil War; his contributions as a lecturer and social commentator; and his decades-long career as a journalist, prose writer, literary and arts critic, and poet.\n\nThe items were assembled by collector and businessperson Charles E. Feinberg (1899-1988), resident of Detroit, Michigan, and Florida, over a period of six decades. The Feinberg-Whitman materials were acquired by the Library of Congress by gift, deposit, transfer, purchase and deposit converted to gift and purchase, from Charles E. Feinberg and others, between 1952 and 2011.\n\nThe Feinberg-Whitman collection contains letters, notes, postcards, telegrams, poems, articles, essays, and memoranda written by Whitman; letters written to him by friends and admirers; memorabilia and printed materials; and a variety of draft manuscripts and proofs, many of them annotated and revised by Whitman, demonstrating his creative process and the development of ideas in his prose and poetry. Whitman's private concerns and interests, some of which would later be voiced in his writings, are revealed in diaries, notes, commonplace books, and notebooks.\n\nOf special note is a surviving page from the original manuscript of the first edition of Leaves of Grass (1855), as well as various trial lines, draft fragments, and printed versions of Whitman poems. Memorabilia includes a walking stick given to Whitman by his friend, the naturalist John Burroughs, as well as a haversack used by Whitman during the American Civil War, a plaster bust of Whitman by Sidney H. Morse, and various personal items, including eyeglasses, a pocket watch, and pen. Included in the collection are proofs and manuscripts by others.\n\nAmong the correspondents represented are Richard Maurice Bucke; John Burroughs; Edward Carpenter; Francis Pharcellus Church; William Conant Church; Moncure Daniel Conway; Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe; Thomas Donaldson; Edward Dowden; Peter Doyle; Charles W. Eldridge; Ralph Waldo Emerson; Fanny Fern; Hamlin Garland; Anne Burrows Gilchrist; Joseph Benson Gilder; Richard Watson Gilder; Ulysses S. Grant; Bret Harte; Robert Green Ingersoll; John Johnston; William Sloane Kennedy; Sidney H. Morse; Ellen M. O'Connor; William Douglas O'Connor; T.W. Rolleston; William Michael Rossetti; Bethuel Smith; Logan Pearsall Smith; Robert Pearsall Smith; J.M. Stoddart; Bram Stoker; John Addington Symonds; Alfred Tennyson, Baron Tennyson; Horace Traubel; J.W. Wallace; George Whitman; Louisa Whitman; Oscar Wilde; Talcott Williams; and members of the Stafford family, as well as letters to soldiers for whom Whitman provided care as a hospital volunteer in the American Civil War, or their family members.\n\nBooks from the Feinberg-Whitman collection are housed separately from the manuscript materials in the Library of Congress Rare Book and Special Collections Division. Photographs and visual images from the collection, most of which have been digitized and are available online through the Library's online catalog or the Prints and Photographs Online Catalog, are housed in the Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division.\n\nTwo other collections of Whitman materials in the Library of Congress Manuscript Division are the small Walt Whitman Papers Miscellaneous Manuscript Collection and the Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman Papers, both also available online.\n\nDescription of Series\n\nThis collection is arranged in ten series noted below.
