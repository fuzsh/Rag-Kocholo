        "text": "To anyone dying, thither I speed and twist the knob of the door,\n\nTurn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed,\n\nI seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will.\n\nO despairer, here is my neck, hang your whole weight upon me,\n\nI have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself,\n\nLet the physician and the priest go home,\n\nI dilate you with tremendous breath, I buoy you up,\n\nEvery room of the house do I fill with an arm’d force,\n\nLovers of me, bafflers of graves.\n\nSleep—I and they keep guard all night,\n\nBy God, you shall not go down!\n\nAnd when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is so.\n\nI sing of life, yet mind me well of death.\n\nAfter the rest has been comprehended and said, even the grandest, and the pervading fact of visible existence is rounded and apparently completed, it still remains to be really completed by suffusing through the whole that other pervading invisible fact. I am not sure but the last enclosing sublimation of human race or poem is what it thinks of death.\n\nBut I do not understand the least reality of life—I should like to know, what is life?—\n\nHow then can I understand the realities of death?\n\nO mystery of death, I pant for the time when I shall solve you!\n\nI do not understand the realities of death, but I know they are great,\n\nThe grappled mystery of all earth’s ages old or new,\n\nElusive, present, baffled, by each successive age insoluble, pass’d on,\n\nTo ours today, and we pass on the same.\n\nTo think the thought of death merged in the thought of materials,\n\nLife and death, the two old, simple problems ever intertwined,\n\nLife’s ever-modern rapids soon, soon to blend with the old streams of death.\n\nLife is the whole law and incessant effort of the visible universe,\n\nAnd death only the other or invisible side of the same—\n\nUnfulfilled aspirations, ideal dreams, the mysteries and failures and broken hopes of life,\n\nAnd then death the common fate of all, and the impenetrable uncertainty of the afterwards.\n\nThe all-engrossing thought and fact of death is admitted not for itself so much as a powerful factor in the adjustments of life,\n\nAnd portals: what are those of life but for death?\n\nLives and works, what are they all at last, except the roads to faith and death?\n\nSlow-moving and black lines creep over the whole earth—they never cease—they are the burial lines,\n\nSooner or later inevitably wending to the exit door—vanishing to sight and ear—and never materializing on this earth’s stage again!\n\nYea, death, we bow our faces, veil our eyes to thee,\n\nWe mourn the young untimely drawn to thee,\n\nThe fair, the strong, the good, the capable.\n\nWe mourn the old—\n\nThe blank in life and heart left by the death of my mother will never to me be filled,\n\nIt is the great cloud to temper the rest of my life.\n\nMother, buried and gone, yet buried not, gone not from me,\n\nI see again the calm benignant face, fresh and beautiful still,\n\nI sit by the form in the coffin,\n\nI kiss and kiss convulsively again the sweet old lips, the cheeks, the closed eyes in the coffin.\n\nThe death of Mrs. Gilchrist is indeed a gloomy fact,\n\nSeems to me mortality never enclosed a more beautiful spirit,\n\nNothing now remains but a sweet and rich memory.\n\nWhile I sat in the day and look’d forth,\n\nThe infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with its meals and minutia of daily usages,\n\nAnd the streets how their throbbings throbb’d, and the voices of children and women,\n\nAnd the cities pent—lo, then and there,\n\nFalling upon them all and among them all, enveloping me with the rest,\n\nAppear’d the cloud, appear’d the long black trail.\n\nI wander’d searching among burial-places,\n\nAnd I found that every place was a burial-place—\n\nThousands gather’d to their funeral mounds, and thousands never found or gather’d.\n\nThe houses full of life were equally full of death, (this house is now,)\n\nThe streets, the shipping, the places of amusement, were fuller, O vastly fuller of the dead than of the living.\n\nNow I am willing to disregard burial-places and dispense with them,\n\nAnd if the memorials of the dead were put up indifferently everywhere, even in the room where I eat or sleep, I should be satisfied.\n\nWith the knowledge of death as walking one side of me,\n\nAnd the thought of death close-walking the other side of me,\n\nAnd I in the middle as with companions, and as holding the hands of companions,\n\nI knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death.\n\nGreat is death,\n\nGive me your tone therefore, O death, that I may accord with it,\n\nGive me yourself, for I see that you belong to me now above all,\n\nFor now it is convey’d to me that you are the purports essential,\n\nThat behind the mask of materials you patiently wait, no matter how long,\n\nThat you hide in these shifting forms of life, for reasons, and that they are mainly for you,\n\nThat you will perhaps dissipate this entire show of appearance,\n\nThat maybe you are what it is all for, but it does not last so very long,\n\nBut you will last very long."
