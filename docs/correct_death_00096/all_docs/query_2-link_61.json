        "text": "Walt Whitman spent half his life writing and revising “Leaves of Grass,” his epic poem of a young man’s journey of self-discovery in a young country, America as it grows into a democracy.\n\nWhitman was 35 years old when he self-published the first edition of “Leaves of Grass” in 1855, and he was still adding to it when he died in Camden, New Jersey on March 26, 1892, at the age of 72.\n\nAs poetry, “Leaves of Grass” was Whitman’s declaration of independence, a break from the confines of meter and rhyme into the self-styled rhythm of free verse. As politics, the poem was Whitman’s celebration of personal freedom, equality, and sexuality, which made him a hero to many but so offended the Puritans in Boston that they sought to have the book banned.\n\n“Leaves of Grass” survived the attacks of the censors and made Whitman famous, but not rich. And although the shining ideals expressed in the poem seem more rooted in Philadelphia, it was across the Delaware River, in Camden, where Whitman lived and worked out his ideas in the final 19 years of his life.\n\nSo it’s Camden, and not Philadelphia, where Whitman chose to be buried. And though Whitman remains very much alive in the American imagination 131 years after his death, his tomb at Harleigh Cemetery must go largely unnoticed by the thousands of commuters who drive by each day.\n\n“I think there’s a fair number of people who know of Walt Whitman because they hear on the radio that traffic is backed up on the Walt Whitman Bridge,” said Matthew L. Ifill, a historian who works at the Whitman house, a national landmark, in downtown Camden. “That’s the main road that people from Philadelphia take on their way to the Jersey Shore.”\n\nStop at the red light in front of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital on Haddon Avenue and look through the fence and down the hill. That’s where you’ll find Whitman’s tomb, carved out of a hillside and in between two trees, a pile of dead leaves at the entrance.\n\nWhitman came to Camden from Washington, D.C. in 1873 to be with his ailing mother, who died later that year. He, too, was in failing health and had suffered a stroke.\n\nHe first lived with his brother, then bought the two-story wood frame house at 328 Mickle Street (since renamed Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard). In those days, Camden was a bustling shipbuilding center and railroad hub, energy that Whitman drew on his poetry celebrating the common man – “democracy with a small ‘d’,’ some might call it.\n\n“Camden was a thriving city during that time,” said Leo Blake, the curator at the Walt Whitman house. “The country was coming into its own as an industrial powerhouse.”\n\nA newspaper editor in his hometown of Brooklyn before turning to poetry, Whitman brought his keen eye for detail to Camden. “One of the things that is interesting in reading Whitman’s poetry is his sense of journalism,” Blake said. “He is the consummate observer. He would take a trip on the ferry [to Philadelphia] and he would write about the people he saw along the way.”\n\nWhitman paid as much attention to the details of his own death. He believed in immortality, and as the end drew near, he set about making his final statement. Although he had an offer to be buried in Philadelphia’s Laurel Hill Cemetery, Whitman chose a plot at Harleigh and went to work designing his own tomb.\n\n“I selected a beautiful lot – to me the most beautiful in the place,” Whitman told his close friend and biographer, Horace Traubel, in a letter on Christmas Day, 1889. That same day, Whitman wrote to another friend, Richard Maurice Bucke, about “my burial plot – a little way back, wooded on a side hill” and his hopes for “a plain massive stone temple.”\n\nBut Ifill writes that the “plain stone temple” that Whitman envisioned turned into a complicated financial mess. The historian, who has written several articles about the tomb for the newsletter of the Walt Whitman Association, said the poet was enraptured by the tomb project, but wasn’t prepared for the sticker shock when the contractor handed him the bill.\n\nOr, as Ifill speculates, the transcendentalist poet may have been brought down to earth the victim of plain, old contract fraud.\n\n“It’s very strange how it all played out,” Ifill said. “Walt was gung ho about the idea and he was telling his friends all about it. Then all of a sudden, a light switch seemed to go off in his head, like, wow, this a lot of money.”\n\nWhitman’s desire was for a tomb large enough for him, his mother, father, brother, and siblings. And in a letter to a friend, Whitman toyed with the idea of laying his two illegitimate children, a boy and a girl, who had predeceased him, in the tomb. Whitman never married, and some sexually-charged passages in “Leaves of Grass” have led many historians to conclude he was gay, but the poet’s personal correspondence suggests otherwise.\n\n“Whitman was very hard to pin down on some things, and this was one of those things. We just don’t know. We know a lot about him in terms of what he writes, but he’s very cagey about his personal life.”\n\nHe wrote to a friend that he’d gotten the burial plot for free, after promising the Harleigh cemetery superintendent he would write a poem. There’s no evidence that he ever followed through, Ifill writes.\n\nHe modeled the tomb after an engraving done by the poet William Blake, “Death’s Door.” The granite had to be shipped from Massachusetts, with some of the stones weighing over 6 tons.\n\nWhitman was excited, and during construction would take friends on carriage rides to the cemetery. But it wasn’t until the tomb was finished in October 1891 that he got the bill: a contract for $4,678, nearly three times what Whitman paid for his house on Mickle Street.\n\nIn letters to friends, Whitman claimed he’d never signed a contract with an amount on it. He suggested that the amount had been added after he signed it, and his friends in Camden – chiefly, his biographer, Horace Traubel, and a lawyer, Thomas B. Harned, rushed to help him.\n\nThe dispute with the contractor, J.E. Rheinhalter, never made it to court, but it wasn’t settled until just weeks before the poet’s death. In the end, Harned managed to save the estate about $1,400, according to Ifill’s research.\n\nThe Whitman house has the original contract. Ifill said it is impossible to say for sure whether Whitman was the victim of fraud, but the last sentence of the contract, which contains the cost, does appear to have been typed separately from the rest.\n\nThe dispute resolved, Whitman died at his Camden home on March 26, 1892. At the funeral four days later, a crowd estimated at 4,000 people gathered at the tomb in Harleigh Cemetery for a eulogy that drew from scriptures found not only in the Christian canon, but Buddhism and Islam.\n\n“How fitting it is at this supreme moment to proclaim his magnificent courage. Every moment of his life tallied with the teachings of his books,” Harned told the crowd according to an account in a local newspaper. “He never bent the knee to wealth and power. His love of humanity is so broad that to him the ragged urchin is as dear as the learned scholar. He had a mission for mankind, and what he had to say he said with fearlessness and without apology.”\n\nBut to those who visit the tomb, the last words belong to Whitman. A marker in front of his tomb contains some of the final lines from “Leaves of Grass”:\n\nI depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,\n\nI effuse my flesh in eddies and drift it in lacy jags.\n\nI bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,\n\nIf you want me again look for me under your boot soles\n\nThis article is part of “Unknown New Jersey,” an ongoing series that highlights interesting and little-known stories about our past, present, and future — all the unusual things that make our great state what it is.
