        "text": "About Walt Whitman House:\n\nThe Walt Whitman House is a historic building in Camden, New Jersey, known as the last residence of American poet Walt Whitman in his declining years before his death. The house is located at 330 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, known as Mickle St. during Whitman’s time there. While living in the home, Whitman completed several poems, many focused on public events. One was a sonnet published in the February 22, 1885, issue of the Philadelphia Press called “Ah, Not This Granite Dead and Cold” which commemorated the completion of the Washington Monument. He also prepared an anthology of essays and articles called November Boughs. After Whitman’s death, the majority of the home’s contents remained at the house. His heirs sold it to the city of Camden in 1921 and it was opened to the public five years later. In 1947, ownership was passed to the state of New Jersey. The home was listed in the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection’s Historic Preservation Office in 1971 and the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1966. The surrounding area was designated in 1970 as the Walt Whitman Neighborhood within the state, and the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.The six-room Walt Whitman House is now open to the public, operating as a museum by the New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry with help from the Walt Whitman Association.\n\nContact Information:"
