        "text": "May 31, 1819\n\nWalt Whitman is born to Louisa and Walter Whitman in Huntington Township on Long Island, New York. He is the second of eight surviving children. His father will struggle to support the family as a farmer, a carpenter, and an unsuccessful real estate speculator.\n\nMay 27, 1823\n\nWhitman's family moves to Brooklyn, across the East River from New York City.\n\n1831-1836\n\nWhitman's father takes young Walt out of school at age 11 to help support the family; he has attained more formal schooling than either of his parents. He finds work as an office boy, and then apprentices as a printer for a local newspaper. In 1833, his family moves back to Long Island. Whitman works at several newspapers in Brooklyn, Long Island and New York City.\n\n1836-1841\n\nWhitman teaches school on Long Island. He stops teaching from 1838-39 to publish a weekly newspaper, the Long Islander.\n\n1841-1845\n\nWhitman moves back to New York City to work as a printer. He also begins publishing fiction and poetry, as well as journalistic pieces, in newspapers and journals. In 1842 his didactic temperance novel, Franklin Evans, or the Inebriate, appears in print. He stakes out radical positions on labor issues, women's property rights, capital punishment and immigration — putting him in near constant opposition to society's prevailing sentiments. In just four years in Manhattan, Whitman works briefly at the Tattler, the Daily Plebeian, the Statesman, the Mirror, the Democrat, the Sun and the Star.\n\n1845-1848\n\nWhitman moves back to Brooklyn and writes for newspapers there.\n\nFebruary\n\nWhitman and his brother Jeff travel to New Orleans. Whitman has been offered a job at the New Orleans Crescent. His stay will be brief; by May he will resign and return to Brooklyn.\n\n1848-1849\n\nWhitman founds and edits the Brooklyn Weekly Freeman, which advocates the \"free soil\" position that new states entering the Union should declare slavery illegal.\n\n1850-1854\n\nWhitman runs a printing office and stationery store, and also does freelance writing and house building.\n\n1855\n\nEngraving of Walt Whitman, frontispiece to Leaves of Grass, 1855. Library of Congress\n\nMay 15\n\nBrooklyn printer Andrew Rome prints the first edition of Leaves of Grass. (There is no credited author, although Whitman is named in a poem and is credited on the copyright page.) Whitman himself helps set some of the type.\n\nJuly 11\n\nWhitman's father dies.\n\n1856\n\nWhitman writes for Life Illustrated, and publishes a second edition of Leaves of Grass.\n\n1857-1859\n\nWhitman edits the Brooklyn Times. Much of his spare time in this period is spent at Pfaff's, a restaurant in lower Manhattan favored by bohemian artists and writers.\n\n1860\n\nThe third edition of Leaves of Grass is published in Boston. In Massachusetts to see his new publisher, Whitman also visits with his literary hero, Ralph Waldo Emerson.\n\n1861\n\nThe Civil War begins. Whitman's younger brother George joins the Union Army.\n\n1862\n\nGeorge Whitman, in his Union army uniform, c1862. Rare Book, Manuscript, Special Collections Library, Duke University\n\nDecember\n\nWhitman travels to Fredericksburg, Virginia, after George Whitman appears on a list of wounded soldiers in the newspaper. George's injury is minor and he will continue to serve in the Army.\n\n1863-1864\n\nFinding he has a talent and desire to give comfort to wounded soldiers, Whitman relocates to Washington, D.C. and makes the rounds of the local military hospitals. He gets a part time job at the Army Paymaster's Office to pay for his modest rented room.\n\nJanuary 24, 1865\n\nWhitman takes a job at the Department of the Interior.\n\nMarch 4\n\n\"With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds. ... \" Whitman watches President Abraham Lincoln give his second inaugural address.\n\nApril 14\n\nDuring the performance of a comedic play at Ford's Theatre, John Wilkes Booth assassinates President Lincoln.\n\nJune 30\n\nAfter his supervisor reads Leaves of Grass, Whitman is fired from his job at Interior. He finds a new job at the attorney general's office.\n\nOctober\n\nWhitman publishes Drum-Taps, a book of poems on the subject of the Civil War and Sequel, containing a new poem inspired by Lincoln, \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd.\"\n\nAutumn\n\nWhitman meets and begins a relationship with a trolley conductor named Peter Doyle. Doyle was in the audience at Ford's Theatre on the night of Lincoln's assassination and gives Whitman a first-hand account.\n\n1867\n\nWhitman publishes his fourth edition of Leaves of Grass.\n\n1870\n\nAfter a move back to Brooklyn, Whitman publishes the fifth edition of Leaves of Grass, Democratic Vistas, and Passage to India; all are dated 1871.\n\nJanuary 23, 1873\n\nWhitman suffers a stroke, debilitating his left arm and leg. He intends to stay temporarily with his brother George in Camden, New Jersey; he occupies the rooms of his mother, who has recently died.\n\n1875\n\nA second stroke affects the right side of Whitman's body.\n\n1876\n\nOn the American Centennial, a special commemorative edition of Leaves of Grass is published, as well as the collection Two Rivulets.\n\n1881\n\nYet another edition of Leaves of Grass is published, this time in Boston.\n\n1882\n\nThe district attorney in Boston threatens to prosecute Whitman's Boston publisher unless certain \"obscene\" sections of Leaves of Grass are edited out. Whitman finds a publisher in Philadelphia who is willing to publish and distribute the unexpurgated book.\n\nApril 14, 1887\n\nWhitman appears on stage in New York to give a lecture on President Lincoln. Among the celebrities in attendance are writer Mark Twain, author and future secretary of state John Hay, U.S. Army commander William Tecumseh Sherman and sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens.\n\n1888\n\nNovember Boughs is published. The poems in this collection will later be appended to printings of Leaves of Grass.\n\n1889\n\nWhitman's friends and disciples organize a seventieth-birthday dinner celebration for the poet, featuring mailed-in greetings from literary notables including Mark Twain, William Dean Howells, John Greenleaf Whittier, and Hamlin Garland.\n\n1891-1892\n\nRealizing he has just a little more time to consolidate his legacy, Whitman revises his signature work one last time by adding some \"annexes\" to his 1881 edition. The final version of Leaves of Grass is also known as the \"death-bed edition.\""
