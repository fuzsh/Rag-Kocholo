        "text": "The 95-page first edition of Leaves of Grass was announced for sale in Brooklyn and New York, printed by Rome Brothers in Brooklyn and distributed by Fowler & Wells (Lorenzo and Orson S. Fowler and Samuel R. Wells). Though no author was listed on the title page, the book was copyrighted by Walter Whitman and featured Whitman’s “carpenter” portrait as a frontispiece. The preface declared America itself to be the greatest poem.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson wrote a famous letter to Whitman praising Leaves of Grass as a breakthrough work in American literature. The letter was later published in the New York Daily Tribune (in October), and used for promotional purposes by Whitman in the second edition in 1856.\n\nLeaves of Grass received several reviews in the periodical press, including ones written anonymously by Whitman, as well by Edward Everett Hall in the North American Review and Fanny Fern in the New York Ledger.\n\nWorked for the Brooklyn Daily Times. Sought to obtain plates for Leaves of Grass from Fowler & Wells, with the hope of converting his book of poetry to a larger edition with a new publisher. Experienced a period of great poetic creativity, writing nearly seventy new poems.\n\nFrequented Pfaff’s tavern, a Manhattan gathering spot popular with bohemian actors, editors, musicians, and writers, located in a cellar on lower Broadway near Bleeker Street. Befriended Pffaf’s regular Henry Clapp, editor of the Saturday Press. Experienced a difficult period of unemployment.\n\n“A Child’s Reminiscence” (later retitled “Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking”) published on the front page of the holiday issue of Clapp’s Saturday Press.\n\nArrived in Boston to oversee production of an expanded edition of Leaves of Grass to be published and distributed by Thayer and Eldridge.\n\nResisted Emerson’s suggestion that the new Enfans d’Adam cluster of poems, celebrating love between women and men, should be edited out of the new edition due to erotic content. Attended Boston-based lectures, services, and meetings, including sessions held by anti-slavery advocates. Befriended by editor, writer, and abolitionist William Douglas O’Connor (1832-1889), who later became a close friend and champion of Whitman in Washington, D.C.\n\nThird edition of Leaves of Grass is electrotyped to high aesthetic standard and published. The new, expanded and carefully designed, 1860 version of the book was clothbound (in a variety of colors--green, brown, orange) and 456 pages. It featured a frontispiece engraving by Stephen Alonzo Schoff from a portrait by Charles Hine, depicting Whitman as a genteel romantic. It contained 146 new poems and no preface. Previously published poems were revised and titled, and poems overall were presented in thematic groupings or clusters.\n\nRepublican Party candidate Abraham Lincoln elected president of the United States to the consternation of Democrats and pro-slavery advocates who viewed the selection as a prelude to disunion.\n\nThayer and Eldridge declared bankruptcy and lost property control over Whitman’s carefully prepared plates for the 1860 edition of Leaves of Grass. Whitman’s royalties for the edition came to an end.\n\nSaw president-elect Abraham Lincoln for the first time in person, as Lincoln passed through New York on the way to his March inauguration in Washington, D.C. Though initially skeptical of Lincoln, Whitman would in the following years grow to admire him and his presidency greatly."
