        "text": "[http://noreligiousislands.wordpress.com/tag/walt-whitman/]\n\nThe picture posted above is a typical picture Walt Whitman would put on the author’s page in his book. It is very unlike the formal pictures other authors would provide.\n\n“To die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.”\n\nAfter being introduced to Walt Whitman, I became consumed with reading various quotes from his works. Walt Whitman was an author who wrote what he felt no matter how much controversy it caused. He incorporated talk about equality, politics, sexuality, and death into his writing. He took writing about such topics to a level that other authors of the time would not have dared to reach. The quote provided above caught my attention. Walt Whitman seemed as if he had a very good outlook on death and what would take place afterward. This made me question why was he so accepting of death?\n\nWalt Whitman’s “Song of Myself” shows that he is fearless when it comes to the idea of death. One reason Walt Whitman was very accepting of death may be because he did not believe that is was the end. “And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths, (No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before).” Through Walt Whitman’s poetry an apparent theme of afterlife, most notably the idea of being born again, or reincarnation surfaces. He questioned what happened to those who perished. He cherished his own spirituality instead of a set religion and acknowledged an afterlife. This ideology means that after a person dies they will simply be born again. If one was to be re-born each time after death there would not be a need to fear death.\n\nhttp://blogs.cofc.edu/whitman/2010/09/01/afterlife-and-rebirth-in-song-of-myself/\n\nAbove is a picture that represents a quote by Whitman stating that death is a beautiful thing.\n\n[http://www.lushquotes.com/death/11/]\n\nAlso, Walt Whitman’s acceptance of death can be linked to the time period in which he lived. He lived in the era of “bright romantics.” He and many others during his time decided to romanticized various events in life. Death was a common event to romanticized. Whitman wrote several poems with death as the main focus. He chose to view it in the perspective of a phoenix. A phoenix simply does not dwell on the ending of one life but celebrates the beginning of a new one. He only approached the mechanics of death so he could easily separate physical aspects from emotional ones. In Whitman’s poem “Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking” he recognized that death creates emotions and desires the fuel a poet. By viewing beautiful things coming out of corruption made it easier for him to accept and welcome death.\n\nhttp://anthologyoi.com/poetry/walt-whitman-and-death\n\nBelow is a video that combines Whitman’s poetry with a song about how life is a continuous cycle.\n\nIn conclusion, I feel that Walt Whitman was so accepting of death because he does not believe in death. He acknowledges that it does take place but as a temporary thing. It was temporary and beautiful to him because it is the process of getting rid of corruption and making things new again. Although I do not agree with reincarnation, I do feel like he has a good attitude towards death. I agree with his accepting death as something that should not be feared."
