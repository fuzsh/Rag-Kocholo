Soon after his birth, the family moved to Brooklyn, where his father worked as a carpenter. His childhood was not an ideal one as his parents moved from one place to another to make both ends meet. Unfortunately, his father died on June 11, 1855, and his mother met her end on May 23, 1873.\n\nEducation\n\nSince his family moved to Brooklyn soon after his birth, where he attended public schools for a few years.
