        "text": "Often referred to as the \"poet of democracy,\" Walt Whitman (1819-1892) is one of America's most distinguished writers. Whitman purchased this modest Camden home in 1884 and resided there until his death in 1892. While in Camden, Whitman revised his renowned \"Leaves of Grass\" and continued to work on an assortment of manuscripts. The six-room house is a National Historic Landmark.\n\nThe Trust grant funded the restoration of Whitman's house, a project that involved shoring the foundation, replacing wood beams decimated by termites, repairing all wood and plaster, replacing historic lights and plumbing fixtures, repainting the interior and exterior to historic colors, and wallpapering with papers specially printed to duplicate the wallpapers as recorded in historic photographs. The House is open to the public and attracts regional, national and international visitors."
