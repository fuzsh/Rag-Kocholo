American Tourist: New Jersey’s Walt Whitman historical sites

What is it: The Walt Whitman House and the Walt Whitman Tomb

About Whitman: Born on Long Island, Walt Whitman (May 31, 1819 – March 26, 1892) worked as a journalist, a teacher, a government clerk, and a volunteer nurse during the Civil War, in addition to publishing his poetry. Whitman's major work, “Leaves of Grass,” was published in 1855 with his own money. The work was an attempt at reaching out to the common person with an American epic. He continued expanding and revising it until his death in 1892. After a stroke towards the end of his life, he moved to Camden, N.J., where his health further declined. He died at age 72 and his funeral became a public spectacle. A public viewing of his body was held at his Camden home; more than 1,000 people visited in three hours, and Whitman's coffin was barely visible because of all the flowers and wreaths left for him. He was buried in his tomb at Harleigh Cemetery in Camden four days after his death, and another public ceremony was held at the cemetery.

Literary critic Harold Bloom wrote, "If you are American, then Walt Whitman is your imaginative father and mother, even if, like myself, you have never composed a line of verse. You can nominate a fair number of literary works as candidates for the secular Scripture of the United States. They might include Melville's ‘Moby-Dick,’ Twain's ‘Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,’ and Emerson's two series of ‘Essays’ and ‘The Conduct of Life.’ None of those, not even Emerson's, are as central as the first edition of ‘Leaves of Grass.’"

Travel Tales

A stubborn airline passenger made life difficult for himself by refusing to turn off his cell phone during a flight. The Texas man repeatedly rebuffed the Southwest Airlines crew’s attempts to get him to turn it off, and when the plane landed, he was arrested by police. Airlines can be fined $25,000 for allowing passengers to use cell phones when they’re not supposed to, and passengers also can be fined. Hope that call was really important. …

Travel Tip: Dress the Part

As a tourist, dress codes are easy to overlook, and it could result in an unwelcome situations occurring. The dress code is different from culture to culture and from country to country. This means that it is a good idea to talk to the natives or people who have visited the area. Some general dress-code advice:

- Use common sense. Look at the locals and what they do and wear, but remember that they may have their reasons to do things in a certain way that do not work for a traveler.

- As a tourist, you are (whether you want it or not) regarded as an unofficial representative of your country. It is not nice if your country and/or your nationality gets a bad reputation abroad just because you do not know how to behave.

- Even if other tourists do not observe the dress code, there is no reason for you not to do it.

- Do not wear sunglasses or dark glasses indoors. If your vision is impaired, or if you are blind and as a consequence wear dark glasses, it is of course a different case. In that situation, other signs usually indicates this, such as a guide or a white stick.

- Many times, an establishment will use the term "dress code." This is somewhat vague, but generally, it signified that you should wear clean and not-worn-out clothes in not-too-bright colors. Sandals or trainers are usually not welcome, so stick to discreet and clean shoes. Some establishments won't even let you close if you show up in jeans, while other places think that clean and whole jeans are perfectly OK. Shorts are not recognized as proper clothing.

- Baseball caps are not to be worn indoors, nor are other kinds of headgear. Ladies wearing designer hats is a different matter, but then the circumstances are usually different. (Wikitravel.org)
