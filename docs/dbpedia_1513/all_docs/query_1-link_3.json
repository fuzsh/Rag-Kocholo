As Secretary of State, Jefferson called for the first official census, and ratified the results of only a handful, this being one of them, signed boldly ”Th: Jefferson” on page 56. Published in Philadelphia: Childs and Swaine, 1791. Full title reads, ”Return of the Whole Number of Persons Within the Several Districts of the United States, According to ‘An Act Providing for the Enumeration of the Inhabitants of the Unites States’. Printed in a small number for distribution by Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State, and from his direct descendant, Thomas Jefferson Coolidge Jr., with Mr. Coolidge’s crested label to front pastedown. Bound in 19th century half-morocco and marbled boards, book measures 5” x 7.25”. This copy appears to be one of the very first printings of the first edition, as it lacks the tipped-in late-returning results from South Carolina often found on page 54. The lower margins of pages 34, 42 and 43 have been shaved by binder, otherwise copy is near fine with a touch of toning and foxing. Volume also includes a press copy of an autograph letter signed by Jefferson, affixed to rear endpaper, dated 8 October 1797, measuring 6.5” x 7.75”. Letter concerns a quarterly dividend of ”a few dollars over 300”, payable to Col. James Monroe. A rare opportunity for the very first census of the United States, signed by its 3rd President, with other such copies selling for approx. $100,000. Sold for $66,435.\n\nJohn Adams Reflects Upon the Real Causes of the American Revolution — “…what would be the consequences of an attempt on the part of Great Britain, to carry into…Authority over Us…War and Carnage, and devastation I saw – or thought I saw must be the consequence – and I fully believed that all the horrours of such a Contest would never wholly subdue the old non-conformist Spirit…” — Extraordinary and Moving Letter on the Indefatigable Spirit of the American Colonists\n\nExceptionally stirring and important letter signed by John Adams almost 50 years after the American Revolution, after which enough time had passed that Adams felt compelled to correct the record about the true causes of the American Revolution. Addressed to Jonathan Mason of Boston, letter is dated 31 August 1820 from “Montezillo”, Adams’ playful comparison to Jefferson’s larger estate at Monticello. In this letter, Adams posits that the fear and hatred of heirarchy, especially in matters of religion by The Church of England, were the wellspring of revolution, rather than simple economic or social issues. In part, “…The real principles, Motives, and feelings which gave rise to the Revolution have been very superficially and imperfectly investigated. For one example among many, The dread of the Hierarchy; and of the high principles in Religion and government; which then prevailed in the Church of England and which were more openly and dogmatically professed and asserted in America than in England itself – Are not sufficiently known, and have not been sufficiently considered. – Indeed it is almost impossible to convince at this day, any young Man; or even any middle aged Man of the extravagance to which those high doctrines were carried before the Revolution…And of the Authority of the Church in matters of Religion – yet these Doctrines, I heard asserted almost every day – The idea that such a Church, and such doctrines and such Hierarchy where [sic] to be established by Act of Parliament appeared to me worse than Death – As I know this to be the feeling and Principle of all the Dissenters in America – I did not believe they would submit to it…I therefore believe as early as I can remember, that this Country would never submit to the Unlimited Authority of Parliament – And this opinion forced me to consider what would be the consequences of an attempt on the part of Great Britain, to carry into execution a Soverign Legislative Authority over Us. – War and Carnage, and devastation I saw – or thought I saw must be the consequence – and I fully believed that all the horrours of such a Contest would never wholly subdue the old non-conformist Spirit…” Signed boldly and clearly “John Adams”. Two page letter with integral franked address leaf measures 8″ x 10″. Minor loss from seal tear on address leaf, else near fine. Housed in a light blue cloth folding case, with the blue morocco spine lettered gilt. Sold for $45,000.\n\nGeorge Washington Autograph Document Signed — Washington Itemizes a 1774 Invoice for His Former Aide-de-Camp in Securing Bounty Land Under the 1754 Proclamation — With University Archives COA\n\nExceptional autograph document signed by George Washington from 1774 regarding bounty land promised to Virginia veterans of the French & Indian War, per the Proclamation of 1754. When distribution of the land stalled after the war, Washington famously took it upon himself to lobby on behalf of the veterans, even hiring a surveyor to divvy up the 20,000 acres himself. He was criticized, however, for reportedly setting aside the best land for himself and his friends, with this invoice revealing his efforts on behalf of his former aide-de-camp, George Mercer, and Mercer’s brother.\n\nDated 25 January 1774, Washington handwrites at top, ”Col. George Mercer on acct. of the Land under the Proclamation of 1754…” He details meetings beginning in 1770 in Fredericksburg, when Washington was appointed agent for securing the land, writing ”voted at Fredericksburg at this meeting, it being for your own & Brother’s shares…” Washington again writes about advocating for Mercer and his brother at a meeting in March 1771 in Winchester, and then bills for ”Surveying 13532 acres Patented in y’r own name” in November 1772. He also charges for ”y’r prop’n of the cost of Surveying a tract of 6788 ac’s – in w’ch you hold 2816 ac’s.”\n\nAdditional charges are listed, along with credits, for a total charge of over 40 pounds. Boldly signed ”Go: Washington” at conclusion. Interestingly, it’s unlikely that Washington ever collected on the bill, as Mercer, a strong loyalist, moved to England before the Revolutionary War. Document is in extraordinarily well-preserved condition, with bold handwriting throughout. Measures 7.625” x 7”. Mounting remnants to verso, otherwise near fine condition. With University Archives COA. Sold for $37,500.\n\nIncredible Secretary of State James Madison Autograph on a July 1803 Letter Regarding the April 1803 Offer from France for the Louisiana Purchase\n\nJames Madison autograph on a letter, as Secretary of State, dated 18 July 1803 and directed to Rhode Island Senator Christopher Ellery, requesting his presence at a special session of Congress to vote on the Louisiana Purchase. Exceptional letter reads in full, “(Circular.) Department of State, Washington, July 18, 1803. / Sir, The Proclamation by the President, of which a copy is inclosed, will inform you, that in pursuance of his authority to convene Congress on extraordinary occasions, he has appointed Monday the 17th day of October next for the meeting of the Senators and Representatives of the United States. This anticipation of the commencement of the ensuing session is rendered necessary by conventions with the French Republic, involving a cession of Louisiana to the United States; which may require the presence of both Houses, and of which conventions the ratifications are to be exchanged within six months computed from the 30th of April last. The shortness of the period therefore, to which the necessary proceedings will be limited, with the very great importance of the subject to the interest of the United States, claim from every member the most punctual attendance; and I am charged by the President to urge these considerations on your patriotism, and your sense of duty. Assurance myself that they will have all the effect which he justly expects from them. I remain, Sir, With the highest respect, Your most obedient Servant,” signed “James Madison”. In April 1803, James Madison received the unexpected offer from France to purchase the vast swath of territory from New Orleans to Minnesota and westward to part of present day Idaho. Working under a deadline from France of ratifying the purchase by October 30, Madison quickly agreed to purchase terms with France, forwarded the document to President Thomas Jefferson in late July, and then summoned Congress to a special session. Ellery and his fellow Senators voted on 20 October, just ten days before France’s deadline, and ratified the Louisiana Purchase Treaty by a vote of 24-7 (the controversial purchase was opposed by some as unconstitutional). Upon its completion, Napoleon Bonaparte remarked, “This accession of territory affirms forever the power of the United States, and I have given England a maritime rival who sooner or later will humble her pride.” Letter measures approximately 9.5″ x 12″. Single page with integral address panel is additionally free-franked signed by Madison. Seal hole and small chip at center fold, else near fine. While this letter theoretically exists for the approximate 200 U.S. Senators, Representatives and Governors in 1803, this is only the third such letter or occurrence of this letter to come to auction, making it exceptionally scarce. A significant document from the largest and most important territorial acquisition of the United States in her history. Dark James Madison autograph. Sold for $37,000.\n\nJohn Adams ALS as President, Who Didn’t Have a Full-Time Military! — “…an Army and Navy Establishment is essential to the present & future Interests & Greatness of the United States…”\n\nHistorically important John Adams autograph letter signed dated 19 July 1799, during his term as the second American President. Adams writes from Quincy, Massachusetts to Secretary of War James McHenry regarding the need for a standing army and navy, warning of embarrassment should the department heads be surprised. After the end of the American Revolution, the U.S., distrustful of standing militaries, sold off the last ship in its Continental navy and disbanded its army. A small navy was reinstated to protect American commerce with the onset of war in Europe in 1793. The U.S. negotiated a treaty with Britain but negotiations with France broke down during the XYZ affair. France, an ally to the American colonies during the American Revolution, now saw the U.S. as a British ally during their own war with England, and began seizing American merchant ships. In 1798, Congress established a Department of the Navy and empowered the merchant marine to defend American ships. A provisional army was also authorized. Peace negotiations with France began in January 1799, while Adams continued to build up the American military, as reflected in this letter. It reads in part, “…I agree with you…that both an Army and Navy Establishment is essential to the present and future Interests & Greatness of the United States and that We must run the Risks which other Nations have run. It appeared to me that Offices were created and Salaries made necessary in the Plan for Supplying the Army, which would require the Interposition of Congress, But if the Powers already given to Administration are Sufficient I am Satisfied…J. Adams”. This letter appears in “The Works of John Adams,” volume 8, 1856. Minor foxing and dampstaining along left edge of single page letter, measuring 8″ x 9.75″. Separation to folds; overall very good. Sold for $27,000.\n\nGeorge Washington & Thomas Jefferson Large 1793 Document Signed by Washington as President and Jefferson as Secretary of State\n\nScarce single-page document dated 8 October 1793 signed by President George Washington, “Go: Washington” and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson “Th: Jefferson” printed in three columns in French, English and Dutch. Issued to “Gabriel Haven, master and commander of the Brigantine called The Betsey of New York lying at present in the port of New York bound for the West Indies and laden with Onions and Flour.” The middle panel contains Washington and Jefferson’s signatures in ink along with New York Mayor Richard Varick and of John Lamb, Collector of Customs for the Port of New York. The United States of America and Mayoralty of New York paper seals are intact on the document, which measures 12.5″ x 16″ and is displayed in a 15.5″ x 21.5″ frame. Slight toning, folds and some chipping; overall very good. Sold for $26,502.\n\nPresident George Washington Autograph Letter Signed 1790\n\nHandsome George Washington autograph letter signed as President. Single page, folio, dated 20 February 1790, to Thomas Mifflin, signer of the Constitution and Governor of Pennsylvania. In full: “Sir, / I have the honor to transmit to your Excellency an Act passed in the second Session of the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States – entitled ‘an Act for giving effect to the several Acts therein mentioned, in respect to the State of North Carolina, and other purposes’. I have the honor to be, / With due consideration / Your Excellency’s / Most Obedient Servt. / G. Washington.” On 21 November 1789, North Carolina became the twelfth state to ratify the Constitution. When Congress assembled at its second session in January, 1790, President Washington called attention in his message to the favorable nature of public affairs and the rising respectability of the United States as a nation. Proof was afforded by the accession of North Carolina to the Union, leaving only Rhode Island yet to ratify the Constitution. The two states plight outside the Union had become so desperate that Congress at its first session consented to relieve the ships of those states for a limited period from the burden of a foreign tonnage duty which amounted to 50 cents per ton for foreign vessels, while domestic vessels paid six cents per ton. This letter discusses the first act passed by the second session of the First Congress in January, 1790, which specified the laying of duties on goods and merchandise imported into the state of North Carolina from any foreign port or place and upon the tonnage of all ships and vessels. The act further created five districts and four official ports of entry for collection of duties. An important early Federalist document. Washington’s signature is dark and prominent. In fine condition. Sold for $25,337.\n\nJohn Adams Twice-Signed Check — Slabbed by PSA/DNA\n\nJohn Adams twice-signed check, signed ”John Adams” at lower right and also ”John Adams Welsh” to his namesake, the son of his close friends Thomas and Abigail Welsh. Partially printed check is drawn from the ”Massachusetts Bank” in 1815 for $100, filled out in Adams’ hand, and unusual in that most payments of the time were entirely handwritten, in the form of a promissory note, and not a bank-issued document such as this. Check measures 4.75” x 2”, irregularly trimmed along edges. Two file holes, not affecting signatures; overall in very good plus condition. Slabbed by PSA/DNA. A rare check signed by the second President. Sold for $24,361.\n\nBenjamin Franklin Letter Signed to Scotsman Lord Kames, Mentioning His Book on Successful Living, “…you will not doubt my being serious in the Intention of finishing my Art of Virtue…”\n\nVery long and beautifully penned letter signed by Benjamin Franklin, written to Henry Home, Lord Kames, one of the principal figures of the Scottish Enlightenment, and mentor to both David Hume and Adam Smith. The American scientist and founding father writes to Kames from London on 21 October 1761 on a variety of topics, including effusive praise of Kames’ book, “Introduction to the Art of Thinking” and anticipation of Kames’ next book, “Elements of Criticism”. Franklin also mentions his own book “Art of Virtue”, which he never finished but seems inspired to complete after reading Kames’ work. Letter reads in part,\n\n“My dear Lord, It is long since I have afforded myself the Pleasure of writing to you. As I grow in Years I find I grow more indolent, and more apt to procrastinate. I am indeed a bad Correspondent; but what avails Confession without Amendment!” Sold for $21,000.\n\nGeorge Washington Autograph Document Signed as President, Also Signed by Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State\n\nGeorge Washington and Thomas Jefferson document signed as President and Secretary of State. Datelined Philadelphia on 8 March 1792, document appoints “Zachariah Rhodes of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations…Inspector of the Revenue for the Port of Patuxet”.

Jefferson” are large and remain strong. Sold for $20,406.\n\nExceptional George Washington Autograph Document Signed as President\n\nPartly printed document signed by President George Washington authorizing a parcel of land be given to James Pendleton for his military service, dated 18 August 1796. Document reads in part, “…in consideration of Military Service, performed by James Pendleton (A Captain for seven years) to the United States…and in pursuance of an Act of the Congress of the United States, passed on the 10th day of August, in the year 1790, entituled [sic] ‘An Act to enable the Officers and Soldiers of the Virginia Line on Continental Establishment, to obtain Titles to certain Lands lying north west of the river Ohio, between the Little Miami and Sciota;’…There is granted, by the said United States, unto Robert Pollard, assignee of the said James Pendleton a certain Tract of Land containing one thousand acres…” Countersigned by James McHenry, Secretary of War on the verso, which is also docketed with notations on the recording of the deed. Land bounties such as the one offered here were issued to reward military service in past wars and encourage enlistment in pending wars. Virginia gave more generous bounties than any other colony or state and a special Virginia Military District was reserved north of the Ohio to fulfill these grants. Signed boldly at conclusion “G.Washington”. Single-page vellum document measures 12.5″ x 14.5″. In very good plus condition with a fine embossed seal and a fine, dark signature.
