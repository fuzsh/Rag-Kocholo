The President is the de facto highest administrative position in the Government of the United States. The President heads the Cabinet and is responsible for organizing and administering the American civil bureaucracy. For example, he is tasked with planning and implementing national economic and social development and as well as helping draft the federal budget. The President directs the executive branch of the federal government on behalf of the Monarch and in some regards acts as the Monarch's Chief Spokesman. The President advises the Monarch on the exercise of their royal prerogative, heads and chairs the Cabinet and selects its ministers. The President is the most powerful appointed/elected position in the United States, second only to the monarch in authority and responsibility. The President is the monarch's closest advisor and the only royal minister authorized to make decisions in their own name. The President is the highest-ranking member of the Cabinet, and leads meetings of the council in proxy of the Monarch when they are absent. As per the Constitution, the Monarch and President both share the title and authority of Chief Executive within the Executive Branch as joint heads of the Executive Branch. However, the Monarch cannot enact their prerogatives for the execution of their policies unless their edicts or decrees are countersigned by a Minister of theirs who then takes on the political responsibility for enacting, implementing, and enforcing the decree. By Convention the President is almost always the one who either countersigns or denies countersignature to the Monarch and their decrees.\n\nThe President is the second-highest ranking person in the American political system, second only to the Monarch, and holds the highest rank in the United States Civil Service. The President of the United States Government is responsible to both houses of Her Majesty's Congress as well as the Sovereign herself. The President serves for a four-year term that is renewable once. The President presides over the plenary and executive meetings of the Cabinet, and is assisted by the Vice President in their work. In the American political system, the President has generally been thought to be the one responsible for managing the nation's economy. The presidency as per the law is officially regarded as an institution of the state rather than an administrative post. Under the current constitution, the President serves at the pleasure of the Her Majesty's Congress, the legislature, and the Monarch. This gives the Congress the power to impeach the President and the Monarch the power to dismiss him.\n\nHistory & Development[]\n\nSince the creation of the Presidency, there has been a division of responsibilities between the Sovereign and the President wherein the President is responsible for the economy and the technical details of implementing government policy while the Monarch gathers the political support necessary for government policy. In July 1776, during the American Revolutionary War, the Thirteen Colonies, acting jointly through the Second Continental Congress, declared themselves to be 13 independent sovereign states, no longer under British rule. Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the British, the Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the states together. There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government. Congress finished work on the Articles of Confederation to establish a perpetual union between the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for ratification.\n\nUnder the Articles, which took effect on March 1, 1781, the Congress of the Confederation was a central political authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens. This institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of Crown and Parliament ought to have functioned with respect to the royal dominion: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire. The states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly royal prerogatives (e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a president of the United States in Congress Assembled to preside over its deliberation as a neutral discussion moderator. Unrelated to and quite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position without much influence.\n\nIn 1783, the Treaty of Paris secured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs. By 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their hard currency pouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their Mediterranean commerce preyed upon by North African pirates, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest. Civil and political unrest loomed. Events such as the Newburgh Conspiracy and Shays' Rebellion demonstrated that the Articles of Confederation were not working.\n\nFollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between Virginia and Maryland at the Mount Vernon Conference in 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in Annapolis, Maryland, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the convention failed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states, Alexander Hamilton led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in Philadelphia. Prospects for the next convention appeared bleak until James Madison and Edmund Randolph succeeded in securing George Washington's attendance to Philadelphia as a delegate for Virginia. After the failures of the Confederation- Nathaniel Gorham, Alexander Hamilton, and others including General Lewis Nicola and others spearheaded a Monarchist Campaign throughout the United States with Hamilton using his Federalist Papers to advocate for the founding of an Elective Monarchy. Many in the Federalist party began to support the idea between the Annapolis Convention and the Constitutional Convention. The Federalists managed to secure the attendance of George Washington and Hamilton and Gorham oversaw much of the Constitutional drafting process. After an extended period of correspondence, Prince Henry of Prussia, having been lead to believe he would be some sort of Life Long Governor or Lordly Parliamentary Figure decides to attend the Constitutional Convention himself. On August 29th, 1787, Henry arrives at the Constitutional Convention. There he impressed the Monarchist Faction of the Federalists and repulses several of the republican Delegates. It was his wife who ultimately won the affection of the Convention because she incredibly impressed the wives of the Delegates, including Martha Washington who urged her husband to support Prince Henry and his wife. On September, 29th 1787, the Monarchist Constitution is produced. The Constitution does not name who the King is or should be but George Washington in his last act as Chair and Presiding Officer of the Convention appoints Prince Henry of Prussia to the position of King. George Washington did not agree with the motion to appoint Henry to be King but the Federalists (who were the Majority at the Convention) wanted it and thus he relented.\n\n1790-1797[]\n\nIn 1790, George Washington is named President by King Henry I Hohenzollern. Washington is credited for the funding of small rebellions in Acadia and for keeping the spirit of revolution alive, even after a series of failed uprisings. His successful merger of minor revolutionary groups to a single larger group provided a better base for all those who shared the same ideals. Widely respected, he became the United States first President, but quickly grew disillusioned with Henry I's lack of respect for the rule of law. His Presidency was successful and he is remembered for his stable Administration and his devotion to the American People. His Presidency was intended to be longer but he petitioned the King to call for an election in early in 1792 to which the King agreed. Alexander Hamilton and John Adams used their Political Clout to throw his weight behind Nathaniel Gorham who won the Presidential Election in January of 1792 and he was sworn in on 20 January 1792. However, Washington did not immediately leave office nor did he resign. Due to an informal agreement with the King and Congress, Washington would \"train\" Gorham and serve as his equal as \"deputies to one another\". George Washington are the only two American Presidents to serve alongside one another and it is the only instance where there has been two presidents at once. After George Washington resigned on 30 December 1792, the Congress passed a law stating that there can only be one President at once. Gorham and Washington shared a single Vice President who was John Adams. John Adams remained Nathaniel Gorham's Vice President once Washington resigned. Nathaniel Gorham's administration was characterized by increased unity and the normalization of relations with Spain, the Netherlands, The First Republic of France, the Holy See, and the Imperial Court of the Holy Roman Empire. Gorham's astute, cautious, and pragmatic foreign policies allowed the United States to peacefully retain the powerful position into which he had brought it, while maintaining amiable diplomacy with almost all some European Nations. When Gorham died in June of 1796, John Adams succeeded his as President of the United States while simultaneously running against Thomas Jefferson. John Adams won the Presidential Election and remained President. It was through these three men that stability was established and the long term survival of the Presidency and Monarchy were ensured.\n\nAuthority and Constraints[]\n\nThe President is the head of the government, as such modern Presidents lead the Cabinet and thus the whole Executive. In addition, the President leads the major political party that occupies the most seats in both houses of HM Congress Combined. The incumbent wields significant executive power. In an executive capacity, the President nominates all other Cabinet members for the Monarch to approve and the Senate to Confirm. The President may by virtue of his office dismiss any Cabinet Member, however, the Monarch can also dismiss any Cabinet member and may by virtue of their title and stature deny the President's dismissal of a cabinet minister. The President co-ordinates the policies and activities of all government departments, and the staff of the Civil Service (the State Bureaucracy). The President also acts as the public \"face\" and \"voice\" of Her Majesty's Government, both at home and abroad. Solely upon the advice of the President, the sovereign exercises many statutory and prerogative powers, including high judicial, political, and the conferral of some decorations and other important honors.\n\nPowers[]\n\nThe President as de facto sole chief executive is responsible for acting in the Monarch's Name and directing the Cabinet to formulate and execute the Federal budget, administering defense enterprises as the Commissary-in-Chief, implementing foreign policy, crime fighting, and working to develop financial and credit policy, and developing welfare and social programs. Despite exercising most of the Monarch's prerogatives, through the Monarch's prerogative of delegation, no President has tried to usurp the Monarch or abolish the Monarchy, instead, some such as Franklin Delano Roosevelt, have tried to keep the Monarch under control and away from politics. The Vice President despite being deputy to the President is chosen and appointed by him, legally has no power or authority and is a largely ceremonial role that is only needed if the President dies or vacates office prematurely. The Chairman of the Political Party with the most combined seats in the House of Representatives and Senate becomes President for a term of 4 years. Once the President-Designate is determined the Monarch formally appoints them on the 10th of November of the Presidential Election year, immediately ending the previous President's term.\n\nThe role of the President is described as combining the functions and responsibilities of an advocate, diplomat, civil servant, and chief executive officer. The US Constitution designates the President as the \"chief executive officer\". The President shares the office of Chief Executive with the Monarch of the United States. The US allows him to perform \"such other functions as are entrusted\" by other United States organs of Government. The Constitution also empowers the President of the Government of United States to inform the National Security Council of \"any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of internal/national peace and security\". These provisions have been interpreted as providing broad leeway for officeholders to serve a variety of roles as suited to their preferences, skill set, or circumstances. The President's routine duties include overseeing the activities and duties of the secretariat; attending sessions with United Nations bodies; consulting with world leaders, government officials, and other stakeholders; and travelling the world to engage with foreign ambassadors and bring attention to certain international issues. The President publishes an annual report on the work of the United States, which includes an assessment of its activities and an outline of future priorities. Most of the President's powers are informal and left open to individual interpretation; some appointees have opted for more activist roles, while others have been more technocratic or administrative.\n\nThe President' Powers specifically listed in the Constitution are as follows:\n\nThe President formally Presides over the Senate without being a Member of Congress as such he may observe debates and decide points of order.\n\nThe President is responsible for organizing and administering the American civil bureaucracy. For example, the President is tasked with planning and implementing national economic planning and the state budget through his role being at the apex of the Bureaucracy.\n\nThe Power of Presidential Vetting. The President may vet bills while they are being discussed or debated in either house of Congress and he may ask the various Committees to which the bill is assigned to reconsider or amend the bill before it is passed. Each Congressman and Congressional Committee asked has the right to deny reconsideration.\n\nThe President may issue Executive Orders, which have the Force of Law yet are not Law.\n\nTo be the Monarch's Chief Adviser\n\nTo attest and affix the seal of the Congress to all writs, warrants, and subpoenas and formal documents issued jointly by both houses of Congress.\n\nTo Nominate potential Cabinet Ministers for the Monarch to Appoint and the Senate to Approve.\n\nTo Chair the Cabinet and perform any duties the Monarch reasonably places on him as such.\n\nTo exercise any and all of the Monarch's Prerogatives when charged to do so by the Monarch, excluding the Prerogatives of Assent and Veto.\n\nAlmsburg Powers[]\n\nAfter a series of multiple minor disputes between King William I and his Presidents over Royal Prerogative and the nature of the Executive, Congress passed the \"Almsburg Amendment\" or the 11th Amendment. All of the President's Almsburg Powers are subject to the oversight of the Monarch and are subject to the Monarch's final approval. The Office of the President of the United States Government is often colloquially called the \"Little Lord\" with reference to their wide ranging executive powers and responsibilities. All of the President's \"Almsburg Powers\" are derived from his power to exercise the Monarch's Royal Prerogatives when charged to do by the Monarch. It should be noted that all of the President's Almsburg powers simultaneously belong to the Monarch, however, they have been used exclusively by the Presidents of the United States Government to \"enable the efficient functioning of the Federal Executive\".\n\nThe Following are the President's \"Almsburg Powers\":\n\nDirectly assist the Monarch in the management of the affairs pertaining to the Executive Branch of the United States Federal Government.\n\nTo when Presidential Countersignature is provided to Royal Decrees, implement presidential directives, orders and decisions originating from the decree.\n\nDecide, for and in behalf of the Monarch, matters not requiring the Monarch's personal attention.\n\nExercise supervision and control over the various units within the Royal Household including their internal administrative requirements, this requires frequent communication with the Crown Council.\n\nExercise supervision, on behalf of the Monarch, over the various agencies of the executive and accordingly regularly submits to the Monarch proposals on the structure and functions of the central institutions of the executive branch.\n\nAppoint officials and employees of the Executive and Royal Household whose appointments are not directly vested in the Monarch by the Constitution and to nominate secretaries, other federal ministers and other officers and to present them to the Monarch.\n\nProvide overall coordination in the operation of the Executive Branch\n\nDetermine and assign matters to the appropriate units within both the Executive and the Royal Household\n\nTo have administrative responsibility for matters delegated from the Monarch coming to the various departments and agencies of the government.\n\nExercise primary authority to sign various reports or papers \"On and By the authority of Their Majesty the King/Queen\", attest to the executive directives of the Cabinet's Ministers and various Royal issuances unless attestation is specifically delegated to other officials by him or the Monarch, this does not include Royal Assent and Veto which are solely vested in the Monarch.\n\nTo determine, with the Monarch's approval, the appropriate assignment of offices and agencies not placed by law under any specific executive department.\n\nTo provide consultative, research, fact-finding and advisory service to the Monarch\n\nTo assist the Monarch in the performance of functions pertaining to the Armed Forces as the second highest ranking National Security Officer through their positions as \"Commissary-in-Chief\" and \"Paymaster of Her Majesty's Forces\". The Monarch retains the title of \"Supreme Commander-in-Chief\".\n\nTo appoint a Vice President, who will serve as his Deputy, Assistant, and Spokesman. The Vice President is to assist the President in the execution of the functions of government and may be assigned any government portfolio by Presidential proclamation. The Vice President performs the duties of the President when the president is outside the country's borders, unable to fulfill the duties of the office, and is to assume the Presidency of the Government when the Office of the President is left vacant.\n\nTo take charge of matters pertaining to protocol in State and ceremonial functions on behalf of the Monarch.\n\nTo when commissioned by the Monarch preside over and speak at domestic and international conferences; regularly re-organize and restructure the regular functioning of the executive according to the needs of the times; tour Embassies and Consulates; and assist in the direction of worldwide diplomatic and humanitarian work on behalf of the Government.\n\nTo promulgate such rules and regulations necessary to carry out the objectives, policies and functions of the Office of the President so long as they do not interfere with nor impede the work of the Monarch or the Monarch's Prerogatives even if they are contrary to the wishes of the Monarch.\n\nThe President is tasked with ensuring public safety and regularly informing the Monarch of his actions on that front. In the 21st Century this power has grown to encompass informing the Monarch and other policymakers about the military intentions and capabilities of foreign governments through the strategic collection of data for foreign and domestic intelligence and counterintelligence purposes.\n\nThe President of the United States Government can, on the advice of the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, conduct international negotiations as well as interpret, and terminate treaties relating to foreign policy.\n\nTo perform all such other functions as the Monarch may direct.\n\nEx Officio Memberships of the President:\n\nThe Cabinet (Chairman);\n\nThe Crown Council (Rapporteur);\n\nThe National Security Council (Chairman);\n\nCentral Military Command Commission (Co-Chairman alongside the Monarch);\n\nNational Committee of their Political Party (Chairman)\n\nSelection process[]\n\nQualifications[]\n\nAccording to the Constitution of the United States, the president must be an American Citizen with full electoral rights who has reached the age of 35. The President must as per the Constitution be \"able to command the confidence majority of Seats in the Congress\". The Election yielded a Congress that was nearly evenly split between the Federalists and the Democrats and as a result the Supreme Court issued the \"Ewing v. United States\" ruling which essentially reaffirmed the Monarch's power to appoint the President and historically the President's Power solely derived from this appointment. Monarchs of the United States have almost always appointed the Chairman/Leader of the Political Party with the Majority of Seats in both Houses of Congress, creating a longstanding legal convention that that is who the Presidency defaults to. Ever since, the election has been dependent on the Political Parties. The Chairman of the Political Party with the most seats in both houses combined is appointed by the Monarch to the position of President of the United States Government. The President of the United States Government must be an American Citizen from birth. The Constitution also states that the presidency is incompatible with any other office; therefore, the president-elect must resign any other position before being sworn in and as a result the National Committees of both the Conservative and Democratic Parties have banned their Chairmen from being Elected or Bureaucratic Officials at the time of assuming their party's chairmanship. Presidents of the United States must have lived in the United States for at least twenty years prior to election. Each President is entitled to run for two consecutive Presidencies or terms in office.\n\nPresidential Primary & Election[]\n\nIn 1968, tensions began to rise over actions taken by Venezuelan Communists in South America rather unpopularly. In 1972, each State-level Party Convention named pro-war Candidates as the Party Nominees for their State when the war was highly contested, even in those five states that had Presidential Primaries- their State-level Party Conventions in both Political Parties named pro-war candidates as their nominees instead of those chosen by the people. This resulted in massive public uproar, leading to the 1972 Capitol Riots. The following year the National Committees for both major Political Parties introduced the \"Blanket Primary System\" by joint agreement. The system announced a new system to allow American Voters in the Next Presidential election to assemble across the country (including in the Territories) to hold Elections among their Political Parties. Essentially, this new system allowed the American people to elect the next Chairman of their Political Party who would by default become their Party's Presidential Nominee. The leaders of both Major Political Parties are voted for by ballot by all registered party members. The winner is the candidate with the simple majority of votes cast. Once the Primaries have been held in all 60 states by August, the Party Candidate who received in the Simple Majority of all their Party Membership's Votes in all 60 States and all Territories is made the Chairman of their Political Party. Once the Party with the Combined Majority of Both Houses of Congress is determined in Late October to Early November, then the Chairman of that party (regardless of how its members caucus) is invited to form a Government in the Monarch's name.\n\nCampaign[]\n\nThe modern presidential campaign begins before the primary elections, which the two major political parties use to clear the field of candidates before their national nominating conventions, where the most successful candidate is made the party's presidential nominee. Typically, the party's presidential candidate chooses a vice presidential running mate, and this choice is rubber-stamped by the convention. The day the President is appointed, he nominates his Vice President to the Monarch who then immediately orally appoints them Vice President. The most common previous profession of presidents is lawyer.\n\nNominees participate in nationally televised debates, and while the debates are usually restricted to the Democratic and Conservative nominees, third party candidates may be invited but have not been since the 1920 election. Nominees campaign across the country to explain their views, convince voters and solicit contributions. Much of the modern electoral process is concerned with mass media advertising drives and frequent tours of the country.\n\nAppointment[]\n\nOnce the Combined Majority of both Houses of the Incoming Congress is determined in October, the Lord High Chairman approaches the Chairman of the Political Party with the Most Seats in both Congressional Houses combined. The Monarch then summons them to the Occidental Palace to hold their first meeting in the State Drawing Room of High Vigilance. The Monarch then in a typically televised ceremony asks the Presidential Candidate that won \"Mr. (First and Last Name) do you accept your election as my President?\" and if the answer is yes (as it always has been) then the Monarch instructs the President to form a Cabinet in their name, The President is appointed by the monarch, through the exercise of the royal prerogative. In the past, the monarch has used personal choice to dismiss or appoint a prime minister (the last time being in 1800), but it is now the convention that the monarch should not be drawn into party politics.\n\nInauguration[]\n\nThe term of every President begins at noon on 10 November of every Presidential Election year, immediately ending their predecessor's time in office. Although the President's appointment is dependent the Majority Party in both incoming houses, the President assumes the presidency shortly prior to the swearing in of the incoming Congress. Before executing the powers of the office, a president is required to recite the presidential Oath of Office, found in Article III, Section 2, Clause 28 of the Constitution. This is the only component in the inauguration ceremony mandated by the Constitution:\n\nI do hereby solemnly swear and affirm that I [name] will faithfully execute all such roles and responsibilities of the Presidency of the United States Government incumbent upon me, and that I will do all to the best of my ability to serve and protect the United States and administer the laws thereof.\n\nPresidents have traditionally placed one hand upon a Bible while taking the oath, and have added \"So help me God\" to the end of the oath. Although the oath may be administered by any person authorized by law to administer oaths, presidents are traditionally sworn in by the Monarch.\n\nDismissal[]\n\nThe President may be dismissed by the Monarch at any time at the Monarch's discretion. The President may also tender his resignation to the president on his own initiative. The Monarch may reject such resignation and oblige him to continue his work. The President and the whole Cabinet are constitutionally obligated to resign on the day of the inauguration of a newly elected President. At the same time, the Monarch has the right to dismiss both the entire Cabinet together with the President or the Monarch may only dismiss the President, retaining the Cabinet. Under certain circumstances, the Monarch may also theoretically be forced to dismiss the President under the pressure of the Congress, given a successful presidential impeachment.\n\nModern Presidency[]\n\nPresident's Office[]\n\nThe President's Office helps the President to 'establish and deliver the President's overall strategy and policy priorities, and to communicate these executive policies to Congress, the public and international audiences'. The President's Office is formally part of the Cabinet Office, but the boundary between its work and that of the wider Cabinet Office can be unclear; the wider Cabinet Office might carry out very similar work with little to no distinction.\n\nPresident's Questions[]\n\nIn 1915, King Edwin I announced that in light of the recent war that it was his intention to have his President Charles Custis regularly report to the Congress. The idea was popular and shortly thereafter a law was introduced into congress mandating that \"For the time being, as the Congress sees fit, the President must meet with the House of Representatives assembled to answer those questions as the general membership of the House sees fit.\". It is clear that Edwin I and the legislators who introduced the law had been inspired by the British Prime Minister's Questions. Question time is currently held every Wednesday at noon when the House of Representatives is sitting in session, in which the President answers questions from Representatives. The congressional leader of the Minority Party/Caucus usually asks the President ten questions, and the Senate President pro tempore (who by convention is the only Senator allowed to attend Question time, let alone speak in it) asks two. Question time typically lasts for 45 minutes but is always scheduled to last for 75. It is an occasion when the President appears regularly on live television and radio.\n\nSecurity[]\n\nThe personal protection of the President and former Presidents is the responsibility of Protection Command within the District of Colombia Police Service as well as a special group of highly trained former special ops agents from within the Queen's Elite 32 Battalions known as \"Her Majesty's Ceremonial Guard\". The Ceremonial Guard is responsible for the protection of the Royal Family and all sitting and former Presidents. A fleet of specially crafted Presidential Cars provides the President with a number of security features as well as transport. The vehicles are driven by specially designated officers from the Ceremonial Guard. The President and their immediate Family are always surrounded and protected by the Ceremonial Guard at all times.\n\nResidence[]\n\nThe White House in Washington, D.C. is the official residence of the president. The site was selected by George Washington, and the cornerstone was laid in 1792. Every president since John Adams has lived there. At various times in U.S. history, it has been known as the \"President's Palace\", the \"President's House\", and the \"Executive Mansion\" before it popularly began to be called the \"White House\" after presidential hopeful Theodore Roosevelt popularized the name in 1900. The federal government pays for state dinners and other official functions, but the president pays for personal, family, and guest dry cleaning and food. The White House contains approximately 100 rooms. A private residence for the President to occupy and there is a kitchen in the basement. The other floors contain offices and conference, reception, sitting and dining rooms where the president works, and where government ministers, national leaders and foreign dignitaries are met and hosted.\n\nLeadership roles[]\n\nHead of Government[]\n\nThe President has responsibility for representing the Cabinet in the United States and beyond. For example, they are a member of the National Security Council and helping to determine public and international security protocols. The President has some responsibilities to the Senate and is regularly questioned by the House of Representatives as such is regularly in contact with the Congress. Outside the United States they attend the meetings of various International Councils and Committees to represent the US. However, in foreign affairs, the President does have to compete with those with foreign affairs related portfolios: the Monarch and the Secretary of Foreign Affairs. The President has significant lawmaking powers, exercised either by proposing draft laws to the Royal Congress, Executive Orders (instruments with the force of Law) or by using Provisional Orders, another type of instrument with the force of law that the president can enact in cases of urgency and necessity except to make changes to some areas of law (Provisional Orders cannot be used to change criminal law or electoral law). A provisional measure comes into effect immediately, before Congress votes on it, and remains in force for up to 60 days unless Congress votes to rescind it. The 60-day period can be extended once, up to 120 days. If Congress, on the other hand, votes to approve the provisional measure, it becomes an actual law, with changes decided by the legislative branch. The provisional measure expires at the end of the 60-day period (or the 120-day, in the case of extension), or sooner, if rejected by one of the Houses of Congress. In recent times Presidents have moved to using Executive Orders more frequently, only using Provisional Orders in cases of emergency. Both Executive Orders and Provisional Orders must receive the Countersignature of the Monarch, which the monarch never refuses by Convention. As a result of their far reaching powers, some political commentators have opined that American voters have unrealistic expectations of American Presidents.\n\nHead of Party[]\n\nThe President is the Chairman of their political party and oversees the day-to-day operations of their political party. The President is responsible for articulating and promoting their party's platform and coordinating its organizational activity. The President's main functions as Chairman of their Party are to assist their Party and promoting their party's political platform and the \"party brand\" or image they have crafted. The President also helps coordinate their party's fundraising and election strategy. Since the entire House of Representatives and a portion of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the President, candidates from a political party inevitably have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate. The coattail effect, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.\n\nGlobal Leader[]\n\nOne of the roles of the President is to represent the US at home and abroad, for example at the annual United Nations Executive Committee Summit. The President makes many international trips. With the rise of the United States as a superpower in the 20th century, and the United States having the world's largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world's most powerful political figure. The position of the United States as the leading member of NATO, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the European Union, have led to the moniker that the president is the \"leader of the free world.\" The President represents the country in various delegations, high level meetings and international organizations that require the attendance of the highest government office, and also addresses to the nation on various issues of national or international importance.\n\nOrder of Succession[]\n\nShould the President become mentally or physically unable to hold office through mental illness, injury, or death, the Vice President becomes president upon the removal from office, death, or resignation of the president. Deaths have occurred a four of times, while resignation and removal from office have never occurred. The following is the Presidential line of succession which includes all Cabinet ministers not including the Lord Speaker of the House:\n\nVice President\n\nLord Speaker of the House\n\nSecretary-Director of the National Intelligence Service\n\nSecretary of National Security\n\nSecretary of Foreign Affairs\n\nSecretary of Defense\n\nAttorney General\n\nSecretary of Finance\n\nSecretary of Education\n\nSecretary of Transit\n\nSecretary of Health & Sanitation\n\nSecretary of Worker's Rights\n\nSecretary of Housing\n\nPostmaster-General\n\nSecretary of Food & Agriculture\n\nSecretary of Trade & Commerce\n\nLord High Chairman\n\nSecretary of the Welfare Oversight Commission\n\nSecretary of Energy\n\nLord President of the Department of the Royal Bank and Treasury\n\nPresidential Sash[]\n\nThe United States Presidential sash is red, cream/off-white, and dark teal with three bands of equal width, with red on top, cream in the center, and teal on the bottom, worn from right shoulder to left waist; it also includes the Imperial Seal, in gold thread, to be worn chest-high. Sitting presidents may also add medals and honorary military decorations, some even add small pins with their political party's logo. During the presidential inauguration ceremony the out-going President ceremoniously hands the sash over to the Monarch who after swearing in the new President present it to them new one as an honor. The sash is the symbol of the Executive Federal Power, and may only be worn by the current President."
