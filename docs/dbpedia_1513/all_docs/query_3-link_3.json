Gorham was apprenticed to a merchant at the age of 15, and he found some success in the field before getting involved in politics. Gorham was elected to serve on the Massachusetts Provincial Congress starting in 1774. In 1778, Gorham was named to the Board of War, a precursor to the Department of Defense. In 1782, Gorham was elected to the Continental Congress (Congress of the Confederation) and during his time in Congress, Gorham was named President of the Congress of the Confederation from 1786 to 1787.\n\nGorham was later also named as a member of the Constitutional Convention which met in Philadelphia in the Summer of 1787. At the Constitutional Convention, Gorham played a number of key roles since he sat on the Committee of the Whole which debated the Virginia Plan proposed by James Madison and the Committee of Detail which drafted the Constitution for final discussions. Gorham was the one who proposed that Senators have staggered terms and that the President would appoint judges to be confirmed by the Senate. On September 17th, 1787, Gorham signed the United States Constitution.\n\nAfter the Constitutional Convention Gorham invested in an enormous tract of land in western New York state, but the investment was a disaster. Gorham ended up broke and died a few years later in 1796 at the age of 58.\n\nNathaniel Gorham in Philadelphia"
