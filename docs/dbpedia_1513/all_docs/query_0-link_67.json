        "text": "Table of Contents\n\nMy Sources:\n\nWhat was the Constitutional Convention?\n\nWhy Did Rhode Island (RI) Not send delegates to the convention?\n\nWho went to the Convention and who were they?\n\nWho were some of the important delegates at the Constitutional Convention?\n\nWhat important decisions did the Framers make?\n\nFun Facts!\n\nThis or That?!!\n\nLoading...\n\nWhat was the Constitutional Convention?\n\nLoading...\n\nNow you may have heard about the Constitutional Convention. Have you ever wondered what happened at the convention or who the framers were? Well today I am here to tell you all about the convention and the Framers so sit back relax and grab a bucket of popcorn, And let's go back about 250 years ago!\n\nThe convention was held from May 25th to September 17, 1787 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. At that time the country was under the Articles of Confederation. However, the Articles of Confederation were too weak and the new country had many problems that had to be solved.\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nEach state acted like its own country, there was no court system and there wasn’t a common currency.The articles only had a legislative branch not a executive branch or judicial branch. They needed a strong government, I agree. Things were going south very quickly in Massachusetts. There was a revolution from the farmers, led by a farmer named Daniel Shay in 1786 because they were taking their land and property since the farmers did not have money to pay.\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nThe country was in debt and the government did not have any money to pay the farmers who were soldiers in the American Revolution. The Framers realized that if they didn’t change the Articles, protests would spread across the brand new country.\n\nThe delegates met the following year in Philadelphia so it was a good idea to get rid of the articles of confederation…. SHHHHHHH Don't tell anyone!!!\n\nWe cant, we do not have money to give to you :(\n\nSpeech Bubble\n\nI need my money back!!!\n\nSpeech Bubble\n\nWhy Did Rhode Island (RI) Not send delegates to the convention?\n\nDid you know that not all states sent delegates to the Convention? Rhode Island was so opposed to changing the Articles of Confederation, they refused to send a delegate. RI supported the Articles of Confederation.\n\nThat's right!! I'm not sending ANY of my delegates to the convention HUMPH!!\n\nSpeech Bubble\n\nThey were afraid of losing their power if the government was too strong because Rhode Island is such a small state with a small population. The delegates in RI did not like a strong central government. Quote from Rhode island “My name would be ROGUE Island”\n\nNo strong central government for us!!!!\n\nSpeech Bubble\n\nWho went to the convention and who were they?\n\n55 delegates attended the convention from 12 of the 13 states, but only 39 of them signed the Constitution. From New Hampshire was Nicholas Gilman who was 32 at the time. He was a lawyer of the National Congress for 2 terms. John Langdon, 46, was a merchant that was EXTREMELY wealthy!\n\nDELEGATES\n\nNew Hampshire"
