        "text": "ArtI.S6.C2.1 Overview of Federal Office Prohibition\n\nArticle 1, Section 6, Clause 2\n\nNo Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been encreased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.\n\nThe second clause of Article I, Section 6 contains two provisions disqualifying Members of Congress from holding other federal offices, such as those in the Executive or Judicial Branches of government. The first provision is generally known as the Ineligibility Clause, and precludes Members from being appointed to federal civil offices that were created (or had their compensation increased) during their congressional term for the length of their elected term. The second provision, often called the Incompatibility Clause, forbids a Member from simultaneously holding “any Office under the United States.”\n\nThe essential distinction between the Ineligibility and Incompatibility Clauses is one of timing. The Incompatibility Clause forbids only concurrent officeholding, so incompatibility violations can generally be prevented by resigning either the other federal office or one’s seat in Congress. In contrast, the Ineligibility Clause forbids appointment to a federal office that was created or had its compensation increased during a Member’s elected term for the length of that term; it thus may apply even if the Member is willing to resign his or her seat in Congress to take the other office.\n\nBoth Clauses seek to prevent corruption and ensure the separation of powers between the federal executive and Legislative Branches of government. As Justice Antonin Scalia explained:\n\nEdmond Randolph introduced what became the Ineligibility and Incompatibility Clauses at the Constitutional Convention as part of the resolutions of the Virginia Plan. The original proposed language would have prohibited Members of Congress from holding any state or federal office during their elected term and for a period of time thereafter, later set at one year. The scope of Members’ eligibility for other offices was debated during the Convention. Some delegates favored stricter ineligibility rules to prevent corruption, while others wished to limit the provision to forbid only concurrent officeholding (i.e., incompatibility) so as not to render worthy Members ineligible for Executive office.\n\nEarly in the Convention, Nathaniel Gorham moved to strike the Ineligibility Clause, which—after a debate that revealed the Framers’ divergent views on this issue—failed by an equally divided vote. James Madison then proposed a “middle ground” provision, which would limit ineligibility of Members only to federal offices that were created, or had their emoluments increased, during the Members’ term. Madison’s compromise failed to be approved by the Convention when first proposed. Charles Pinckney, who had earlier successfully moved to limit the Ineligibility and Incompatibility Clauses to only federal (and not state) offices, moved to limit the provision to forbid only concurrent officeholding, but failed in that effort.\n\nLate in the Convention, after another failed motion by Pinckney to remove the ineligibility provision, the substance of Madison’s compromise was re-introduced and was narrowly passed by the Convention. With some stylistic changes, the Ineligibility and Incompatibility Clauses were incorporated into the Constitution."
