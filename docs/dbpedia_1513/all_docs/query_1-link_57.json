        "text": "Victor’s Connection to Renowned Rochester Architects\n\nBy Babette Huber, Town and Village Historian\n\nThree architects who were renowned in the Rochester area and designed three of Victor’s homes, the proposed Sunday School building at the First Methodist Church and a sign for Valentown Hall are Jay Fay, Otis Walter Dryer and his son, Harwood Brownell Dryer. The Dryers were relatives of the Victor Dryer family after which Dryer Road is named.\n\nJay Fay was born in St. Catherine, Ontario, Canada in 1856. His family moved to Rochester when he was four years old. Starting at a young age, he apprenticed in the office of architect, John R. Thomas, as a draughtsman, and eventually opened his own office in Rochester in 1883.\n\nJay Fay Otis Walter Dryer\n\nIn March of 1884 he hired Otis Walter Dryer as a draughtsman. Seven months later, in October of the same year, the firm of Jay Fay & O.W. Dryer was formed and would last until 1912. Dryer was guaranteed at least $600 annually - about $22,000 in today’s dollars and Dryer was 26 years old.\n\nIn 1903 the firm designed the C. L. Simonds residence at 26 Maple Avenue - now the Jarmusz-Cotton Funeral Home and Cremation Services of Rochester. The design is shown in Folder #62 - “Residence for C. L. Simmons (1903), Fay and Dryer, architects (the client name should be listed as Simonds) - as part of the Dryer Architectural Collection, 1886-1989 housed at the Rochester Public Library. This house was designed for the family whose cobblestone general store was located at the corner of Maple Avenue and Main Street. Several changes have been done to 26 Maple Avenue - removal of the front porch and enclosure of the front entrance.\n\nThen in 1907 they designed the Charles Green residence at 1640 Victor-Holcomb Road (Route 444): the large yellow house at “The Apple Farm”- this is the SECOND design shown in Folder #37 - “Residence for Charles Green (1907), Fay & Dryer, architects.” This large, prominent, and very distinctive Colonial Revival house looks to retain all of its original exterior design. The only change between the drawings and the actual house design is regarding the columns on the front porch. The architectural drawings show angled (battered) columns – while the actual columns on the front porch are round/fluted columns with straight (not battered) shafts.\n\n26 Maple Avenue 1640 Victor-Holcomb Road 1669 Victor-Holcomb Road\n\nThe third home that Fay and Dryer designed in Victor was at 1667 Victor-Holcomb Road - right across the street and south of the Charles Green residence. It was a design shown in Folder #628 - for George Ketchum and without a date. It is a large Colonial Revival style house.\n\nOtis Walter Dryer was born in Rush, NY in 1858 - grandson of Samuel Dryer II and Mary Bahanan of Dryer Road in Victor; son of Orrin Dryer and Adeline Sophronia Stull. He was educated at the village school and Genesee Wesleyan Seminary in Lima, NY. In 1882, he studied architecture under Stuttgardt University architect Eugene C.F. Ernst. In 1883, Dryer began working for Buffalo architect, M.E. Beebe, who designed many court houses and public buildings. During this early period, he worked for a short time in the offices of Warner and Brockett--A.J. Warner and his nephew, Frederick, designed many of Rochester’s most prominent public buildings, including St. Bernard’s Seminary and the Powers Building. Dryer also worked for the architectural firm, Otis and Crandall. While there, Dryer entered his sketches in a competition to design the First Methodist Episcopal Church of Leroy. He won the competition, but because of his lack of experience in handling such a large job, he turned his commission over to Otis and Crandall who carried out Dryer’s design.\n\nAnd because his brother, George Herbert Dryer was a Methodist minister and District Superintendent of the Methodist Church during this time, Otis had access to information about where church construction was being considered. This gave the firm a distinct advantage in winning church design commissions. Between 1883 and 1976, more than 75 churches throughout the Genesee region were designed by Fay & Dryer and Dryer. (Otis and Harwood were members of Asbury M. E. Church--now Asbury First United Methodist Church). Perhaps that’s why they were one of the architectural firms asked to design the Sunday School building at the First Methodist Church in Victor which was completed in 1926. Interestingly enough, the current building DOES NOT match the drawings shown in folder #238. The design in the folder shows a longer wing with different windows on the front at detailing. In fact, Dryer and Dryer were NOT selected as the architects of this building - the contract was with the architect, Charles E. Lathrop of Rochester.\n\nCurrent First Methodist Church Sunday School wing\n\nIn 1910, O. W. Dryer opened a firm under his own name and his son--Harwood Brownell Dryer - (1895-1992) began to study architecture in 1914 at Cornell University's College of Architecture and worked as a draughtsman in his father's firm during the summers, until he graduated in 1918. He was a draughtsman for a short time in 1919 for the firm of Gordon and Kaelber before returning to his father's firm as an architect.\n\nHarwood Brownell Dryer\n\nIn 1923 his father took him into partnership under the name of O.W. Dryer and H.B. Dryer. The firm’s name was later changed to Dryer and Dryer. They specialized in school and church design.\n\nAnother interesting design in folder #1166 in 1940 was a request by Sheldon Fisher for a sign for the Valentown Hall. Check out the Valentown Hall site to see if it was actually made!\n\nIn 1951, O. W. Dryer retired. H. B. Dryer kept the firm name of Dryer and Dryer until his father died in 1957.\n\nThe firm of H. B. Dryer continued to be fully active until Harwood Dryer retired in 1976.\n\nInformation and photos for this article are from:\n\nThe Rochester Public Library, River Campus has the Dryer Architectural Collection, 186-1989.\n\n“The Dryer Collection: Jay Fay-Otis W. Dryer-Harwood Dryer” by Arlene Wright Vanderlinde\n\nWilma Townsend, Assistant to the Victor Historian\n\nBARNS of VICTOR\n\nBy Wilma Townsend, Town Historian’s Office\n\nBenson Farm 461 Benson Road\n\nAfter returning from the California gold rush in 1856, Ichabod Benson bought this property from the Parks family. It has remained in the Benson family since then.\n\nThe red gambrel roof barn has a ramp to the center bay. Small sheds were added as needed. Note the 20th century silo that is no longer in use. The long gray barn in the foreground was built later in the 20th century.\n\nHawkins Farm 945 Victor-Egypt Road\n\nThis farm was first owned by William Hawkins, farmer and carpenter who built the nearby Italianate brick residence in 1865. The property has remained in the Hawkins family for five generations.\n\nThe Gothic Revival carriage barn with the center front gable has doors opening to wagon and carriage storage, and horse stalls. The left end of this barn has a small extension for a hay track to carry hay into the mow for the animals.\n\nThe barn to the left may have been for other agricultural activities such as preparing products for market and for storage. A substantial gambrel roof barn once stood across the road from the house and the smaller barns.\n\nLoveland-McMahon Farm 1124 McMahon Road\n\nAsel Loveland came to Western New York from Massachusetts in 1831 and settled his family on this farm in about 1840. After his death in 1899, the property was sold to the McMahon family.\n\nThis English barn with its cobblestone foundation probably was built in the 1840s. Gothic Revival elements such as the center front gable and the windows probably were added later in the 1860s. A shed extends along the back of the barn for animals and storage.\n\nWilcox Farm 1338 Strong Road\n\nBorn in East Bloomfield, Hiram Wilcox was working this farm by about 1850. Upon his death in 1891 the farm passed to his son Charles E. Wilcox.\n\nThe two attached gambrel roof barns that are built into the side of the hill have lower levels for livestock and other activities such as dairy. A gambrel roof gives 50% more storage for hay over gable-end English barns. Two former silos can be seen behind the smaller barn.\n\nKetchum Farm 1702 Murray Road\n\nBorn in Victor to one of the founding families of Victor, Albert Ketchum began farming here in about 1830. In 1866, he sold the farm to Graham Parmele. The Parmele family owned the property into the 20th century.\n\nThe gable-roofed English barn in the back may be original to the farm. The large gambrel roof barn with a silo peeking behind it and the smaller Dutch gambrel roof barn date to the early 20th century.\n\nLauder Farm 6381 Gillis Road\n\nComing from New Jersey, Samuel Snedecker began this farm in 1832. In 1855, John Lauder bought the farm and it has remained in the family since then.\n\nThe two English barns attached to each other may be the oldest in this barn complex. The smaller barn to the left has a cobblestone lower level with areas for livestock. The larger barn to the right was used for threshing and hay storage, with livestock underneath. The barn to the far left may have been used for various agricultural activities and storage. The barn to the far right is the newest to the complex.\n\nHunt Farm 7782 Dryer Road\n\nOriginally from Beverly, MA, Elston Hunt and his family were living in Victor by 1810. In 1820, he bought 81 acres for $325 and began his farm. His son Jared R. Hunt took over the farm upon his father’s death in 1841. The farm remained in the family into the 20th century. Jared’s daughter Lucie Hunt, married Frank D. Spring who continued running the farm.\n\nThe three bay English bank barn has a ramp (on the other side of the barn) to the main floor and a raised basement for livestock. The barn probably dates to the early to mid-19 century.\n\nLawrence-O’Neill Farm 7793 Boughton Hill Road\n\nLorenzo Lawrence came to Victor from Stockbridge, MA in about 1824 where he worked for others, rented a farm to save money and then bought this farm. After his death in 1894, the farm was sold to M. C. O’Neill.\n\nThe barn complex includes two gambrel roof barns from the late 19th century for hay and equipment storage with animal stables underneath. The 20th century Dutch gambrel roof barn to the right is made of concrete block and is attached to the smaller gambrel roof barn.\n\nBAGEL is Not a Food! It’s a Yearbook?\n\nBy Babette Huber, Town and Village of Victor Historian\n\nThe first yearbook for Victor Central School was produced in 1948. It was aptly named the BAGEL, Blue And Gold Ever Lasting - hence the BAGEL. It was first year teacher, Eleanor Mertz’s (later to become Eleanor Barry) role to advise a group of high school students as they put together this yearbook.\n\nIt had been eight years since VCS had centralized and left the Main and School Streets building and moved to the new 175-acre campus on High Street with a brand new building that used to be the Ladd Farm.\n\nWith a senior class of 42 students, Supervising Principal, Alton Corbit, felt it was time to produce a yearbook. Also, the year before, the editor of the student newspaper, HILLTOPICS, Mary Hawkins (Phillips) and her staff had made a prototype.\n\nThe BAGEL’s cover was created by junior, Ruth Aldridge (Harter) while the author of the BAGEL name was the inspiration of June Kesel (Harris).\n\nIncluded in the yearbook was the Alma Mater, which was written by Estella Guinan, class of 1917, music by Lafayette Clapp, Principal, 1916-20 and the harmonization was by E. R. Mann, c. 1918.\n\nThe first BAGEL was dedicated to Miss King--the senior class advisor, homeroom teacher, English teacher-- and “much more than an advisor and teacher-you were a friend.”\n\nEditors of this edition were: Editor in Chief - Theresa Porta (Sportelli), Literary Editor - Mary Hawkins (Phillips), Typing Editor - Marion Barry, (Skip Zumbo), Photography Editor - Daniel Gosnell, Advertising Co-editors - Gordon Fritz and Robert Guinan, Business Manager - Lloyd Bowerman, Sports Editor - Walton Brady and Art Editor - Bette Goodberlet. A special note - all the artwork was individually done by students. The total staff of the BAGEL was 30 students - quite a lot considering that the high school consisted of approximately 185 students.\n\nSenior class officers were Gordon Fritz, President, Charleen Nicholson (Fike), Vice President, June Beard (Bowerman), Secretary and Theresa Porta (Sportelli), Treasurer.\n\nClubs at the Senior High were few and meant to serve all unique interests at the time - Student Council, National Honor Society, Future Farmers of America, Future Homemakers of America, band, orchestra (both directed by Mr. Shufelt) chorus - which was in its first year as a co-ed chorus (directed by Miss Norton) and most important to the teachers - Projection Club.\n\nSports teams were for boys only - basketball, baseball and football - all coached by Mr. Spinner. The cheerleading squads, however, were co-ed.\n\nThe title of the senior play was “Take Your Medicine” - a hospital farce that Miss King directed. The leads were Lloyd Bowerman, Gordon Fritz and Mary Hawkins (Phillips).\n\nNeeding a revenue source to print the yearbook, the Advertising Editors, Gordon Fritz and Robert Guinan, sold advertising space at the back of the yearbook. After 74 years since the publication of this first yearbook the only local businesses that have survived to 2022 are Victor Insulators and Cotton Funeral Home (now Jarmusz-Cotton).\n\nMuch has changed over the years with the BAGEL - now it is hardcover, in color and has seen a vast increase in the numbers of clubs and sports (both boys AND girls).\n\nThe Town of Victor Archives has many of the BAGELs, but we are still missing the following years: 1974-76, 1984, 2006 and 2010 to present. If you are interested in donating any to the Town Archives, please contact Babette Huber at Bmhuber@town-victor-ny.us or call 585-742-5065..\n\nVictor News, 1922\n\nBy Babette Huber, Town and Village of Victor Historian\n\nThe Victor Herald was Victor’s local newspaper from 1881-1991. One hundred years ago, the Victor Herald, in 1922, shares an historical journey of how different our lives are now. Along with national, state, and local news, two favorite columns were: “Around the Town” and “People You Know.”\n\n1922 was in the decade of the “Roaring Twenties” -- a decade of economic growth and widespread prosperity, driven by recovery from wartime devastation and deferred spending, a boom in construction, and the rapid growth of consumer goods such as automobiles and electricity. It was marked by a general feeling of novelty and a break with tradition and through modern technology such as moving pictures and radio. Jazz-Age flappers flouted Prohibition laws and the Harlem Renaissance (an intellectual and cultural revival of African American music, dance, art, fashion, literature, theater, politics, and scholarship centered in Harlem, Manhattan, New York City) took flight.\n\nSome national events which happened during 1922 were:\n\nChristian K. Nelson patented the Eskimo Pie ice cream bar\n\nPresident of the United States Warren G. Harding introduced the first radio in the White House.\n\nIn the Bronx, construction began on Yankee Stadium.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., the Lincoln Memorial was dedicated.\n\nRebecca Latimer Felton of Georgia became the first female United States Senator\n\nThe Molly Pitcher Club was formed as a women's organization to promote the repeal of Prohibition\n\nStatewide in 1922 showed that:\n\nDuring the winter of 1921-1922, New York State was visited over a very wide area by so-called infectious or epidemic jaundice;\n\nAl Smith was elected governor;\n\nNew York City requires by law that all “pool” rooms must change their name to “billiards” rooms.\n\nIn Victor, 1922, things were more subdued and conservative. For example, Victor initiated a new speed ordinance on Main Street - 15 miles per hour. On the first day, Officers Farrell and Waldorf, had caught eight speeders and Judge Ewer, after finding them guilty, collected $80 in fines.\n\nThe Sale Garage (now where Pontillo’s is) had a 1922 Ford Sedan with an electric starting and lighting system on sale for $645. Sale’s advertisement boasted the greatest motor car value ever produced - an enclosed car of comfort, convenience and beauty.\n\nLocal trips were written with great detail! Mr. and Mrs . Henry Wielt, of Victor, went to Phoenix, Arizona in 19 days - traveling 2,916 miles, used 125 gallons of gasoline costing $33.79 (total!) and about 25 quarts of oil, costing $7.00. Other specifics included where they stopped, who they visited, what sight-seeing they did and what kinds of roads they encountered.\n\nUnder the weekly “People You Know” column in the Victor Herald, one would read, for example:\n\nThe Misses Evelyn Tay, Mildred Lauder, Dorothy Gillis and Mary Gillis are spending a week at the Sale cottage on Canandaigua Lake;\n\nMr. and Mrs. Ira A. Corey will have as their guests, Saturday, the ladies of the White Cap Club, formerly of Ionia;\n\nMr. and Mrs. Harry Tourje of Syracuse arrived, Saturday evening, for ten days’ visit with Mrs. Tourje’s sister, Mrs. Guils Wilbur and family;\n\nW. C. Green and family spent Sunday afternoon at Letchworth;\n\nReverend and Mrs. Lorren Stiles of Holly visited Mrs. A. G. Aldridge and family and other Victor friends from Wednesday until Friday.\n\nIt was important, at the time, apparently, to let people in the Town and Village know exactly what was happening in your household.\n\n“Around the Town” was more of an announcement column in the Victor Herald. For example:\n\nSchool opens Tuesday, September 5th;\n\nSylvester McCarthy has purchased a Maxwell touring car;\n\nA son was born to Mr. and Mrs. Albert Pezzimenti of Victor at Memorial Hospital in Canandaigua on August 18th;\n\nThe Young People’s Society of the Evangelical Lutheran church will hold a sausage roast at the home of H. Czadzeck on School Street, this Friday evening;\n\nThe residence of Mr. and Mrs. George W. Boughton on Maple Avenue is being improved by a fresh coat of paint;\n\nThe 16th annual reunion of the Benson family was held Wednesday at the home of Alonzo L. Benson. Fifty-one members were present.\n\nAs you read about the happenings nationally, in the state and in the town and village of Victor in 1922, one hundred years has certainly changed our lives. It certainly was a simpler time. What would the Victor Herald say about its citizens in 2022?\n\nIs There History in the Glacial Features of Victor?\n\nBy Babette Huber, Town of Victor Historian\n\n“Ice was a mile deep over the future Town of Victor as the last glacier ground its way from Canada a few hundred thousand years ago. Its weight lowered the land by several hundred feet. Its progress scooped away old features and created new ones, which soon, in geological time, were themselves changed.”\n\n“Waters pouring from the retreating ice sheet carried large volumes of sand and gravel debris…” These small hills formed were called kames and in Victor they cluster in the southwestern part of the Town. “They became known as the Hopper Hills, either because they reminded early settlers of food hoppers or because of the sizeable crops of hops once grown in the area.”\n\n“As sub-glacial debris clustered around the onetime obstructions, the layers of debris formed drumlins - elongated oval hills, with convex sides steeper at the end from which the glacier was coming. Victor’s are in a wide belt of drumlins considered to form the world’s finest display.” These asymmetrical hills are usually 1/4-1/2 miles long and 50-200 feet high.\n\n“It was not until the glacial lakes were gone that blocks of ice trapped at the bottom of the lakes began to melt, no longer insulated by water above and finally exposed to air and rain. In their place the massive ice chunks left another familiar feature, the round deep depression of soil which surrounded the ice. Known as kettles or kettleholes, those in Victor include depressions that are dry and those that contain small lakes.” Kettle lakes, kettle holes filled with water, are usually not more than a mile in diameter and 30 feet deep.\n\nAs land began to be settled in Victor, many of the glacial features were changed. On Gillis Road is an extraordinary example of a drumlin on the Lauder Farm. A glacial kettlehole, Crossman’s Pond, is at the intersection of Benson Road and Fisher Road. Kames in the southwest quadrant of the Town are numerous but subject to development. One wonders what will become of our glacial history in years to come. Should they be preserved?\n\nInformation gathered from:\n\n\"Victor: The History of a Town by Lewis Fisher\"\n\nTown of Victor Archives\n\nFisher Family Cemetery\n\nOf those still buried here in the Fisher cemetery, the one born the earliest would probably be John Fisher, a mariner who was born in Boston about 1740. He witnessed the trial of the British soldiers involved in the Boston Massacre, participated in the Boston Tea Party, and was a veteran of the American Revolution.\n\nIn 1790 John and his wife, Bethiah, moved to western Massachusetts with their son Robert and his wife, Lucinda, who was the daughter of a Scottish immigrant. They were joined there by Lucinda’s sister Hannah and Hannah’s husband, David Barrett, and all moved west to a farm south of Cazenovia. In 1810 the two families moved further west to what became Fishers. The Barretts stayed but Robert and Lucinda Fisher went on to Henrietta, where Robert died in 1814. Lucinda was a widow in her 30s with eight children. She moved her family back to Fishers to be near her sister. Her brother-in-law David Barrett and her eldest son, Charles Fisher, then 18, built a log cabin that evolved into the Fisher Homestead.\n\nThe aging John Fisher and his wife, Bethiah, made the journey west with their children and grandchildren. They lived a short distance west down what is now Main Street. When they died they were buried across from the homestead in what was becoming the family cemetery, at the corner of what became named School Street and then Wangum Road near the Barretts’ cabin. Roads were rutted and often barely passable in those times, so it was easier for families to not travel to a large but distant cemetery and instead to bury their loved ones close to home. There is already a marker at another such cemetery, the Parks family cemetery up Main Street across Route 96.\n\nAs with many small family cemeteries, no written records were kept, so we cannot say for certain who is buried here. But it is safe to say that early graves include John and Bethiah Fisher, their daughter-in-law Lucinda Fisher, and several Fisher siblings, in-laws, children, and cousins.\n\nCharles Fisher’s youngest son, William, inherited the Fisher Homestead. His next youngest, Henry, inherited this land across the street, which Charles Fisher had acquired when the Barretts moved west to Ohio. Henry Fisher married Lucy Bushman, daughter of a well-to-do farmer in Mendon named Abner Bushman and his wife Phebe. In 1885 the Bushmans wanted to build them a fine home on the property, but Phebe Bushman did not want her daughter living next to a cemetery. If they were to build the house, the cemetery had to go.\n\nSo brothers William and Henry Fisher moved eight of the most recent graves by wagon to the cemetery on Boughton Hill. These graves included their father, Charles Fisher, who had died in 1872, and his first wife, Rebeckah, who died in 1849. Other graves moved were that of their grandfather, Henry Pardee, elected as a Whig to four terms in the state assembly and who retired from Victor to Fishers, where he died at the Homestead in 1862.\n\nWhether Henry Fisher’s mother-in-law ever figured out that there were still some graves left here we don’t know. But the gravestones were gone and the Bushmans built the house. Some of us remember Henry and Lucy Bushman Fisher’s daughter Clara Fisher living here when we were children. Clara’s second cousin Sheldon Fisher preserved the memory of the cemetery, which became Clara’s garden. Sheldon remembered flowers like heliotrope that were often planted in early cemeteries still growing here when he was young.\n\nBy Lewis Fisher, July 2021\n\nBe a witness to history!

Catalog House\n\nBy Babette Huber, Town and Village of Victor Historian\n\nSears started selling mail-order houses from their specialty catalog—the Book of Modern Homes and Building Plans--in 1908. It is reported that over 100,000 houses were sold between 1908 and 1939. Why was it so popular? You had a choice, over the years, of over 400 different styles; you could save money by building it yourself; they were made of quality building materials and Sears offered liberal loan policies. A family could have a custom home at a certain price for a certain size—the family made the choice and built it themselves.\n\nThe custom made Sears Modern Home was advertised that, for a precut house with fitted pieces, it would take only 352 carpenter hours to assemble as opposed to 583 hours for a conventional house. Sears sold complete houses including the plans and instructions. By 1911, the catalog would include illustrations of the interior of the house and provided homeowners with blueprints for the ability to furnish the home with Sears appliances and fixtures. Owners could also modify the plan, for example, by using brick instead of wood siding or reversing floor plans.\n\nIn 1908 only one model—number 125—was sold for $945. After that, the models had names like Adeline, Maplewood, Magnolia and the one built in Victor—the Crafton at 6427 Route 96 in East Victor.\n\nThe “kits” were about 25 tons and shipped by railroad—30,000 pre-cut parts, plumbing, electrical fixtures and as much as 750 pounds of nails. Building the house was done step by step using a 75 page instruction book and blueprints. Sears, in time, offered three built qualities—Honor Bilt, Standard Bilt and Simplex Sectional. Many of the low end models were smaller, simpler and didn’t include a bathroom. (The company did sell outhouses separately).\n\nThe framing system, called “Balloon style” framing didn’t require you to be a skilled carpenter—they were built faster and usually only needed one person. This type of framing used precut timber in standard sizes. Another easier homebuilding material to use was drywall—it was easy to use and cheaper than the plaster and lathe that was used by skilled carpenters. Another material that had just been invented was the asphalt shingle which took the place of tin or wood roofing materials.\n\nThese homes are known for their sturdiness, variety and the latest technology available to modern homebuyers in the early part of the 20th century. Central heating, plumbing and electricity were all new developments and Americans wanted these conveniences. When the kit house business ended, Sears lost most of its records. Many people didn’t document their home as being a Sears catalog house. The blog Kit House Hunters has found over 10,000 Sears houses still preserved. The Northeast and Midwest have the most because they sold best in those regions.\n\nVictor’s one documented Sears catalog house was built in East Victor by Ermil Peglow in 1931. It was the best plan offered by the Crafton model—Plan 3318D. This house plan had the most square footage—988—with six rooms and a bath. It was a bungalow with cedar shingles and a large porch with a baluster railing. Mr. Peglow kept all of the documentation for h is home—the lists of inside and outside doors, windows, sashes, door trim and jambs, pipes, linoleum, lumber, nails, sheet plaster, septic tank, furnace—even down to the clothes rods and lamp bulbs! This was the complete house—all one needed to do is to assemble it! Instructions on how to build the house were given in the form of blueprints. A separate sheet explained how to lay linoleum and Floor-or-leum and a booklet explained instructions for installing modern plumbing systems. Although Mr. Peglow kept all of his documentation, none of it included the final price he paid for his home. It is safe to say, though, that it was about $1400 EXCLUDING plumbing, heating, wiring, electric fixtures and shades and appliances.\n\nSears discontinued its Modern Homes catalog after 1940. Sales through local sales offices continued into 1942. I wonder why—was it because of World War II? Years later, the sales records related to home sales were destroyed during a corporate house cleaning. Only a small percentage of these homes were documented when built and Mr. Ermil Peglow probably didn’t know at the time that keeping his documentation was very important to Victor’s knowledge of his special house!\n\nInformation and photos courtesy of:\n\nPaul Prietz\n\nTown of Victor Archives\n\nFishers, New York - Seed Potato Capital of the World\n\nIn the little hamlet of Fishers, New York, now part of the Town of Victor, potatoes were king! From the Civil War to well after World War I every available space was planted with potatoes. The sandy loam soil was the perfect earth in which to grow seed potatoes.\n\nThe boom all started in 1877 when the Valentown Grange sent Charles W. Ford to the Farmers Alliance convention in Morristown, NJ. The New Jersey growers were complaining about the difficulty that they were having keeping potato seed between seasons. Ford explained that the tubers grown in his area—that is, Fishers, NY, were very hardy and offered to send potato seed to anyone who wanted it. From then on and for at least 50 more years Ford sent seed potatoes to New Jersey.\n\nArthur G. Aldridge of Fishers had a warehouse with 50,000 bushels of seed potatoes and his catalogs went around the world. For years he had a photo of “the world’s largest potato”—a spud grown on his farm on Valentown Road the size of a pumpkin.\n\nAfter the death of her husband, Sarah Connelly carried on the family business under the name of SJ Connelly because it was unusual for a woman to run a business at that time. She named one potato after her sister—the Maggie Murphy.\n\nAmbrose T. Lane, another potato magnate exhibited 50 potato varieties at the Chicago World’s Fair in 1893.\n\nThe Victor Rose, Victor White and Brownell’s Best were some of G. B. Pickering’s seed potatoes that, as his catalog boasts, “ The potatoes we offer were grown in the vicinity of Fishers, Ontario Co., N.Y. … No other section produces more healthy or more vigorous seed potatoes.”\n\nNoah Baker grew 10,000 bushels of potatoes a year on Baker Hill and was rated the single largest grower of seed potatoes in the United States.\n\nAnd did you know that the land that Eastview Mall is built on used to be a huge potato farm?\n\nProduce dealers, like Leslie Loomis in Victor, shipped, at its peak, 500 train car loads of potatoes a year. Big warehouses and freight houses stretched out along the Lehigh Valley and the New York Central’s Auburn Railroad tracks. Railroad Mills, Fisherville and Valentown also became shipping points.\n\nWith Fishers the potato capital of the world, it became one of the earliest areas to make use of the newly invented telephone. The Fishers telephone exchange was started in 1887 with eight outside lines.\n\nPotatoes were so commonly grown that it was thought that the boom would go on forever. But today the sleepy hamlet of Fishers no longer grows seed potatoes—the Aldridge Warehouse was remodeled into offices for Lifetime Stainless Steel, but now the building is used by the Fishers Fire Department. Other storehouses, railroad stations and warehouses are gone.\n\nThe demise of the seed potato industry was the demand for lower quality seed potatoes grown elsewhere (more potatoes could be grown per acre with the lower quality) and the trucker who would buy right off the field, eliminating the middle man in Fishers who would act as the buyer. In 1950, with the last of the Aldridge family passing away in 1950, the glory of the seed potato industry in Fishers was gone. Today the rolling countryside around the Ontario-Monroe county border is home to Eastview Mall, other commercial endeavors, light industrial development, housing developments and the Thruway. Valentown Museum, as the original Victor/Fishers Grange, awaits the visitor to see the way things were in the heyday of the seed potato industry in Fishers.\n\nBabette Huber, Victor Town Historian, 2013\n\nGypsum Mills at Victor\n\nBy Babette Huber, Victor Town Historian\n\nWho would have ever thought that at one time Victor, New York, had the first and only shaft gypsum mine in the United States? It was located at the site of Gypsum Mills Estates on Plastermill Road.\n\nGypsum? Plastermill? Gypsum is a naturally occurring mineral found in large deposits near, or with, large salt deposits. It remained in our area after the evaporation of a very salty lake covered a 200 mile long east-west belt. (As a side note—this lake also produced the salt deposits of New York State). Gypsum was first discovered in New York State in 1792 and used as a fertilizer in the eighteenth century.\n\nVictor began its surface gypsum mining from a quarry at the Old Conover Plaster Mill on Plastermill Road. The gypsum was used as a fertilizer to neutralize alkaline soils and provide sulphur. In the late 1800s gypsum was also quarried from the Goose Egg, an oval hill about 1 ¼ miles north of the Conover farm. By this time a commercial method of retarding the setting of gypsum plaster was developed and it revolutionized the plaster industry. Plaster began to be used then in the construction industry.\n\nThe Conover Plaster Mill was soon leased by a cement company. A building was erected at the mill site to accommodate a furnace which would take out lime from the gypsum and use the lime with cement to form concrete. After shallow test drilling found a low quality of gypsum left on the site of the old Conover mill, the lease was abandoned.\n\nAbout 1907, Charles Tuttle of Rochester, revived drilling about ¼ mile from the old Plaster Mill. Gypsum was traditionally surface mined. Tuttle had the foresight to drill in several areas down 110 feet below the ground on a 375 acre site (Clara Conover, Eliza Conover and Mr. C. L. Gourley farms). He eventually found high grade gypsum. Unfortunately he had to wait twenty years before he got financial backing to build a shaft and mine the gypsum. In 1927 the shaft was finished. The floor area of the mine covered 11 to 12 acres. Three tunnels were approximately six feet high and fourteen feet wide with a ceiling of limestone. About 400 tons of gypsum was removed daily by Victor Plaster, Inc. Victor, New York, had made its mark on the gypsum mining industry—it had the first and only shaft gypsum mine in the United States.\n\nA rail spur from the main line of the Lehigh Valley Railroad was used to transport the crushed minerals over the United States to companies t use to make plaster of Paris, wall plasters, fertilizer and as a retainer in cement.\n\nIn 1942, Victor Plaster, Inc. sold its property to Rochester Gypsum. Victor Plaster had doubled its initial gypsum production by 1936, but the mine was closed in 1940. In 1948 the Federal Gypsum Company acquired a lease on the property and prepared to resume operations. A newspaper article states that the gypsum deposits in Victor are the richest in the state.\n\nThe underground rail system was taken out and the mine shaft was filled with water. The silo stack from the original Conover Plaster Mill still partially stands.\n\nBabette Huber, Victor Town Historian, 2013\n\nVictor - A Reflection on its Early History\n\nBy Babette Huber, Victor Town and Village Historian\n\nVictor—Webster’s dictionary defines “victor” as a conqueror, a winner in a battle. As the history of Victor evolved, the name will attest to its appropriateness. On July 13, 1687, a French army of some 1,500 men marched into the Victor valley under the leadership of Marquis Denonville, governor of New France (now Canada).\n\nAlong with French regulars were Canadian militia and Indian allies who were to attack and crush the Seneca Indians at Ganondagan. Clad only in his underwear and jack boots (because of the heat of July), Denonville and his army destroyed “the keepers of the Western Door.” Before the French could have the glory of destroying Ganondagan, the Senecas themselves set fire to the village. The invaders finished the destruction by demolishing the corn storehouses and the palisade. Without a home any longer, the Senecas moved to join their confederacy neighbors and relatives, the Cayugas, and the attack only intensified their hatred of the French. Why did the Senecas have such a hatred of the French? The French, who are the “victors,” gain control of the rich fur trade routes that the Senecas have had for hundreds of years and that now the French and English are trying to control.\n\nThe Senecas house Ganondagan (Boughton Hill site) as the spot for their capital in the 17th century. It had a commanding view of the surrounding terrain, and one half mile to the west, was the site of Fort Hill and the granary. The village itself was believed to have been inhabited by up to 3,000 Senecas, 100-150 longhouses and surrounded by palisades twelve feet high. A spring was located to the west from which basswood pipes were used by the Senecas to carry water to the village.\n\nOver one hundred years after Denonville’s destruction of Ganondagan, the area once again began to inhabit settlers. This time, however, they were settlers from Massachusetts. Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham made an agreement to buy 2,600,000 acres of land that is now known as the Phelps-Gorham Purchase. (Its boundaries were Lake Ontario as the northern boundary, Pennsylvania as the southern boundary, west to the Genesee River and east to the Pre-Emption Line). The purchasers agreed to pay the Indians $5,000 cash and an annuity of $500 forever. The land was then divided into townships about six miles square. In 1789, William Walker, an agent for Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham, began, for the first time, to sell land directly to the settlers. Walker’s secretary was Enos Boughton of Stockbridge, Massachusetts.\n\nEnos and his brother Jared visited the area where Ganondagan is today as representatives of their father, Hezekiah. Enos Boughton then bought Township 11, Range #4 (a six mile square piece of land) of the Phelps-Gorham Purchase at 20 cents an acre. The crossroads became known as Boughtontown as settlers from the Boughton family of Stockbridge, Massachusetts began arriving. Enos and Jared Boughton built a log cabin in the area in 1789. The intended community on Boughton Hill was in the form of a square, with a school, a cemetery and the first tavern (the Wilmarth Inn). The tavern’s construction started in 1808 and opened on Christmas Day, 1813. It was a common stop for travelers and stagecoaches. Within eight years, however, the stagecoach route was changed and no longer ran in front of the tavern. Today the Wilmarth Inn is a private residence.\n\nThe schoolhouse was used by the children of the Boughton Hill area until 1941. In 1941, the Victor Central School’s first building (now the Victor Early Childhood School) was completed and opened to all children in the newly consolidated and centralized school district. In 1945, the schoolhouse was sold to the Boughton Hill Cemetery Association for one hundred dollars. It has since been dismantled.\n\nSoon the crossroads of Boughton Hill began to lose its importance to the valley where a more prosperous village began to grow. The settlement grew in the valley because it was located on Merchants Road, the trade road east and south to Canandaigua, the capital of the “frontier,” and the road west and north to the falls of the Genesee (Rochester).\n\nIn 1812, the Town of Victor was officially established by the State Legislature, and set apart from Bloomfield (which was composed of Mendon, Victor, East Bloomfield and West Bloomfield). In October of that year, a meeting was called to name the town. It was unanimously agreed that the name would be VICTOR after Colonel Claudius VICTOR Boughton who distinguished himself in the War of 1812. On April 6, 1813, the town was formally organized and the first town meeting held with Jacob Lobdell voted to be the first Supervisor and Eleazor Boughton as the first Town Clerk.\n\nInformation from this article was taken from—\n\nArticles in The Victor Herald\n\nThe Boughton Hill Site as a National Landmark, Charles F. Hayes III, 1965\n\nThe History of Victor, New York, 1776-1976, Fagan, Guiffre, Snyder\n\nHistory of Ontario County, New York, 1876\n\nVarious clippings on the history of Victor, NY from the Town of Victor Archives\n\nBabette Huber, Victor Town Historian, 2015\n\nVictor: Early Settlement to 1812\n\nBy Babette Huber, Victor Town and Village Historian\n\nVictor, originally Township 11, Range #4, of the Phelps-Gorham Purchase, was bought by Jared Boughton of Stockbridge, Massachusetts (for his father Hezekiah Boughton) for 20 cents an acre, in 1788. The earliest settlers were members of the Boughton family and came west from Massachusetts. Other settlers from New England followed and agriculture became the town’s most important industry.\n\nIn the spring of 1789, Jared Boughton and his brother Enos came to what is now Victor, stopping along the way in Canandaigua, to buy tools and food. They built a cabin fifteen feet square on Boughton Hill—it was of poplar poles and stood near a small brook. In June of that year, Jacob Lobdell and Hezekiah Boughton Jr. came with the cattle. Two yoke of oxen prepared the fields for potatoes, buckwheat and wheat. All returned to Massachusetts except for Jacob Lobdell (18 years old) who remained with the dozen or more head of cattle. Boarding with Elijah Rose of Bloomfield (3 miles distant) he was able to look after the cattle during the mild winter. Once he was pursued by wolves and another time by a party of Indians. Lobdell eventually bought 100 acres of land from Hezekiah and Seymour Boughton. For the $200 he needed for the land, Lobdell traded his time in labor. He then married a daughter of Levi Boughton and had 13 children. He be came Victor’s first supervisor.\n\nJared Boughton returned the following year, 1790, with his wife Olive and two children—a son Selleck (2) and a daughter Melania (an infant). They moved into the previously built log cabin on Boughton Hill. The potatoes planted the previous summer hadn’t produced a harvest, but with the provisions they brought and the buckwheat crop, the family was able to survive. Indians often came with berries and in moccasined feet, they would move noiselessly and were in the cabin before their presence was observed! Jared built another cabin in 1791 near the property today of the Harris-Osborne Home on Maple Avenue. That same year, Frederick, son of Jared and Olive Boughton, was the first white child born in the Town of Victor.\n\nIn 1793, the Boughtons built a saw mill on a small stream in “Hog Hollow,” which acquired its name from the large number of hogs that grew fat there eating the refuse from a distillery once in operation there. Rufus Dryer and N.O. Dickenson built a grist mill here in c..1810 and furnished bacon and flour during the War of 1812. “Hog Hollow” is south of Victor on the southeast corner of Dryer and School Roads.\n\nSettlement began to grow in the valley and not on Boughton Hill. Merchants Road, the trade road east and south to Canandaigua (the capital of the “frontier” and the road west and north to the fall of the Genesee (Rochester), became more important than the crossroads on top of Boughton Hill where the Seneca capital, Ganondagan had once been.\n\nWith the growing population, the settlement began getting more businesses. In 1798, the center or village contained two log houses owned by Captain A. Hawley Sr. and his son James. The captain kept a tavern in his cabin (the first in the village) and as the settlement grew so did the taverns. A tannery and shoe factory was built in 1810 by Enos, Samuel and James L. Gillis. The first permanent merchant was William Bushnell (after whom Bushnell’s Basin is named).\n\nApplejack Mill was located in Hog Hollow (on the corner of School Street and Dryer Road\n\nDr. Joel Brace is believed to have been the first doctor in Victor. Dr. Thomas Beach came in 1808—a story about him is that sick people followed him from house to house begging for assistance and the only way he could get rest was by halting in the woods, tying his horse, using his saddle as a pillow and placing his alarm watch on his head so he could be awakened at a particular time. Religion was also important to the early settlers. The first church, the Proprietor’s Church, was built in 1805-06. It was located on Webster Heights (behind the Gallup Building) and used by every denomination. The Presbyterian Church is the oldest Christian church in Victor—formally organized as a Congregational Church in 1796.\n\nA one room schoolhouse was built near the Wilmarth Tavern and adjacent to the Boughton Hill Cemetery in 1802. It was torn down when Victor centralized its schools in 1941.\n\nThe hamlet of Fishers, once known as Fishers Mills, was first settled by Charles Fisher in 1811. He ran a grain and saw mill factory.\n\nEast Victor, formerly known as Scudderville, became a hub of mill because of its location on Fish Creek. Thomas Hawley erected a saw mill on Fish Creek before 1800. Elijah Griswold started a card mill in 1806. Ezekish Scudder, for whom “Scudderville” or East Victor is named, erected the first permanent mill at the site of the present “Phoenix Mills” in 1791.\n\nThe settlers needs were quite simple. “They lived in their time and they passed on a heritage of courage, endurance, loyalty and faith that has played no little part in the development of this nation.” (Taken from an article in The Victor Herald, June 4, 1953) Nor has this heritage played any small part in the development of Victor.\n\nInformation for this article was taken from:\n\nArticles in The Victor Herald\n\nVictor: The History of a Town, Fisher, 1996\n\nThe History of Victor, New York, 1776-1976, Fagan, Guiffre and Snyder\n\nHistory of Ontario County, New York, 1876\n\nVarious clippings on the history of Victor, New York\n\nBabette Huber, Victor Town Historian, 2015\n\nFor more information about this article contact: Babette Huber, bmhuber@town-victor-ny.us or 742-5065.\n\nLooking at Victor's Past\n\nCivil War Heroes\n\nBy Babette Huber, Town and Village of Victor Historian\n\nAs Victor’s Bicentennial has drawn to a close, the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the Civil War is still being celebrated. The Civil War started on April 12, 1861 and ended on April 9, 1865. Victor had many men involved in the war—even two brothers—Alexander and Edward McCrahon who fought on opposite sides of the war. This column would like to highlight some of those men from Victor who fought for a united America. The first in the series is James Hard.\n\nJames A. Hard was born at Victor, New York on July 15, 1841. He was the son of Alanson Pratt and Martha Frost Hard. He was the third of 13 children and survived the entire family.\n\nIn 1949, at the Grand Army of the Republic's final National Encampment, James Albert Hard was the last living veteran of the Civil war in the State of New York. At 109 1/2 years of age he was both the oldest living Union veteran and the oldest member of the Grand Army of the Republic. Although blind, he served as both the New York Department Commander and the Jr. Vice Commander-in-Chief of the G.A.R.\n\nIn 1868 James A. Hard married his first wife who died in 1880. They had one daughter who died in 1948 at the age of 75. In 1884 he married his second wife who died in 1929.\n\nJames Albert Hard, while still alive, had 3 grandchildren, 8 great-grandchildren and 7 great-great grandchildren.\n\nMr. Hard began as a government railroad worker. Thereafter, he engaged in carpenter work for a time. Finally he became a notary and had a flourishing pension business continuing in the same office for 38 years. As a young man he worked on farms. He had very little schooling.\n\nHe settled in Rochester in 1882 which has remained his permanent home. While very young he moved from his birthplace at Victor, NY to Broome County, Windsor, NY.\n\nAt President Lincoln's first call for volunteers he enlisted at Dryden, NY on April 18, 1861. He served in the regular Army for 2 years and thereafter engaged in government railroad work until the close of the War. James A. Hard served in Co. E, 32nd NY Volunteers.\n\nHe met President Lincoln twice. Their first meeting was at a White House reception at the outbreak of the war just after his enlistment - before he had been issued a uniform. As he approached Lincoln the President shook his and said, \"Well, son, you look like you would make a good soldier, why don't you join up?\" His second meeting with Lincoln was at Bailey's Cross Roads when Lincoln was inspecting troops, at which time he again shook hands with the President. He also once shook hands with General Grant.\n\nDuring the Battle of While House Landing, on the York River, his Commanding Officer, Capt. LC Grown was killed besides him. He took part in the battle of Fairfax Court House, Blackburn's Ford, Bull Run, Munson's Hill, Bailey's Cross Roads, 2nd Munson's Hill, and Annandale - all in Virginia in 1861. In 1862 he fought in the battles of West Point, The Seven Day's battle of Virginia, Gaines Mill, Garnet's and Goldings Farm, Glendale, Malvern Hill, Crampton's Pass - again, all in Virginia, as well as Antietam, Maryland. In 1863 he took part in the battles of Fredericksburg, Franklin's Crossing, Mary's Heights and Salem Church -once again, all in Virginia. Hard served through the war as a Private.\n\nOne of Mr. Hard's maternal uncles served in the Revolutionary War. In WWII he had a Grandson, Earl H. Osborn, stationed at Aberdeen, Md., a Great-Grandson, James P. Eksten, with a medical detachment of the 133rd Inf. in Africa and Italy, and another a Great-Grandson, Donald R. Nelan, with the Air Corps over Germany.\n\nJames A. Hard attended the last encampment of the NY Department, GAR, in 1948 and of the national organization in 1949. He was the only veteran at the State Encampment and only 1 of 6 at the last National.\n\nHe was Commander-in-Chief of either the Union Veterans Union or Union Veterans Legion.\n\nWhen he died on March 12, 1953 he was given the City of Rochester's version of a State funeral. Thousands lined the streets of Rochester to say good-bye. The City Hall bell tolled 13 times. It was the first time since V-J Day that the bell had sounded. He was laid to rest in Mt. Hope Cemetery next to his second wife, Anna, who died in 1929.\n\nSource:\n\nLast Civil War Veteran in Each State, 1951 by C. Stewart Peterson, Baltimore, MD.\n\nVictor in the War of 1812\n\nBy Babette Huber, Town and Village of Victor Historian\n\nThe War of 1812 was instrumental in Victor’s formation. The Town of Victor was incorporated as its own town by an act of the State Legislature of New York on May 26, 1812. It was named after Claudius Victor Boughton, a member of the founding family and a hero of the War of 1812.\n\nThe War of 1812, declared on June 18, 1812, has often been called the Revolutionary War Part II. And in many ways, it was just that-It was a war between America and Great Britain. The Americans declared war in 1812 for several reasons--trade restrictions due to Britain's ongoing war with France, the impressments of American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy, British support of Indian tribes against American expansion and possible American desire to annex Canada. It involved fighting in America and Canada.\n\nAs more settlers began arriving in Victor, it became mandatory for every able-bodied male, ages 18-45, to serve in the militia. Victor was on the frontier, being only 25 miles from Lake Ontario which was controlled by the British Navy. The drill grounds were on the village green, which was then at the top of Boughton Hill in front of the Wilmarth Tavern (now a private residence). The privates supplied their own arms and the officers their uniforms and arms.\n\nA new unit, added on May 23, 1812—just before Victor became an official town—the 12th Regiment of Cavalry commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Seymour Boughton. Boughton was killed and scalped by Indians as he fled the burning of Buffalo. Henry Pardee, a 15 year old drummer boy, who trained on Boughton Hill, joined his company in an attack on Canada and was wounded and captured at Lundy’s Lane, Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. When he was released he walked home through burned out Buffalo carrying a heavy cannon ball. Mr. Pardee later served as a Victor Town Supervisor and for 20 years as a member of the New York State Assembly. Claudius Victor Boughton, nephew of Seymour, also served in this regiment. During the summer of 1812 he risked his life to carry dispatches through enemy lines from the Niagara frontier to Albany—the state militia headquarters.\n\nOther soldiers who fought in the War of 1812 were: James Gillis who was captured and taken to Quebec, Dr. Thomas Beach, serving as a surgeon, with Ebenezer Bement, a Victor blacksmith as his assistant, Captain Jirah Rowley who was captured by the British at Black Rock during the burning of Buffalo, Vine W. Hickok, was killed during the battle of Queenston Heights, Jacob Lobdell (Victor’s first Supervisor), Asahel Boughton, Deforest Boughton, Jared Boughton (first pioneer in Victor), George H. Boughton, Silas Boughton, Stephen H. Boughton, William Brace, John Collins, Samuel Gillis, John Grinnell, Jeremiah Hawkins, Robert Jackson, Thomas Lynch, Amos Mallison, Paul S. Richardson, Marvin Scudder and John Stockwell.\n\nVictor residents watched as guns from the U.S. arsenal near Canandaigua went through Victor and Fishers to reach Charlotte on Lake Ontario. The artillery helped deter a British land force and in 1814 assisted in deterring a British fleet from shelling the shore. Rufus Dryer and N. O. Dickinson carted flour to the American army in Buffalo from their mill in Hog Hollow (corner of School Road and Dryer Road).\n\nDuring the war, Boughton Hill families of soldiers away gathered at night for safety at the Thomas Beach home. Horses were kept saddled, ready for a quick escape if needed.\n\nThe War ended in 1814 with an American victory and the Battle of Baltimore in 1814 inspired the lyrics of the United States national anthem, “The Star-Spangled Banner.”\n\nVictor: The History of a Town, Fisher, 1996\n\nThe History of Victor, New York, 1776-1976, Fagan, Guiffre, Snyder\n\nHistory of Victor, O’Keefe, 1976\n\n“1815 on the Front Lines” by Bob Kelly\n\nVarious clippings on the history of Victor, NY from the Town of Victor Archives\n\nBabette Huber, Victor Town Historian, 2015\n\nLooking at Victor's Past\n\nBy Babette Huber, Town and Village of Victor Historian\n\nVictor's Civil War Heroes, Part 2\n\nThe celebration of the 150th anniversary of the Civil War is being celebrated. The Civil War started on April 12, 1861 and ended on April 9, 1865. This column would like to highlight some of those men from Victor who fought for a united America. The second in the series are James Moore and Frank D. Spring.\n\nJames Moore was among the first men in Victor to enlist. In May 1861, at age 24, he enlisted in the 29th New York Infantry for two years. He fought at Antietam and Chancellorsville, was taken captive and held in the infamous Libby Prison for eight days until he was exchanged for a rebel prisoner. Near the end of the war in September, 1864, he reenlisted in the 1st Cavalry for one year; he was present for Lee’s surrender at Appomattox.\n\nAfter the war, Moore resumed his occupation as carpenter and builder. He was married to Irene Nelson and they lived on Church Street.\n\nFrank D. Spring enlisted in 1861 as a musician in the 126th New York Infantry. Regimental bands were important to boosting the fighting spirit and morale of the troops. In 1863 he became sick and was admitted to Jarvis Hospital in Baltimore. After recovering, he was placed on duty at the hospital until the end of the war.\n\nAfter the war, Spring moved from Bloomfield to Victor, where he married Lucy Ann Hunt. He was an active member of the community and in the early 1890s was elected street commissioner for the village of Victor. Spring was honored as Grand Marshall of the parade that celebrated, in July, 1889, the dual centennial of Washington’s inauguration and the settlement of the town of Victor which occurred in 1789.\n\nInformation for this article was taken from:\n\nVictor: The History of a Town, Fisher, 1996\n\nTown of Victor Archives\n\nWilma Townsend, Curator, OCHS\n\nBabette Huber, Victor Town Historian, 2013\n\nGoldfarb's Cobblestone General Store\n\nOriginally called The Felt Cobblestone Store, this building was built in 1836 and then sold in 1841 to Samuel Rawson to settle debts, upon the death of Charles S. Felt. The settlement mentions “the cobblestone store, the two old stores occupied as dwelling houses, a tailor shop and ashery and the dwelling house occupied by Jabez Felt.” The cobblestone general store was an integral part of the hamlet of East Victor.\n\nIn 1905 Barney Goldfarb purchased the cobblestone store at the corner of Route 96 and McMahon Road. The general store sold everything—sugar, milk, eggs, Jello, tires—all in the same room. As was common at the time, the Goldfarbs began using a grocery cart drawn by two horses and driven by David Goldfarb in 1912, to do a weekly tour of the town, with a specific day for each area of the town. Mrs. Goldfarb would be up at 4:00 am to pack the cart. Groceries and household items would be bartered for such items as eggs and butter. Soon, however, as automobiles gave famers easy access to village stores, the grocery cart became a thing of the past. Supporting progress, the Goldfarbs began to sell Esso gasoline in front of the store.\n\nBy 1916, the Goldfarb children were encouraged by their parents to set up a hot dog stand to sell hot dogs, soft drinks, fudge and pies from Memorial Day to Labor Day.\n\nThen in 1923 the Goldfarbs started a cider mill using 10,000 to 25,000 gallon vats made by the Wilcox Johnson Company (forerunner of Victor Coal and Lumber) to hold their cider. The cider mill was called the Checkerboard Cider Mill. Also made in the plant were dill pickles, sauerkraut, mustard and relishes. Sibley’s Department stores carried the Checkerboard label of products. Many of the cucumbers for the dill pickles were grown on the land that is Eastview Mall today.\n\nMr. Goldfarb operated his store until his death in 1941. Son, Louie, and daughter, Lena Braiman continued until 1965. Then Lena Braiman ran the store until she sold it in 1973 to Irene Sharron. At that time it was remodeled and carried toys, gifts and antiques. In 1992 the cobblestone was put on the National and State Registers of Historic Places.\n\nThe cobblestone building still retains its integrity with the front façade featuring a finely crafted cut limestone storefront with wide piers resting on a watertable and supporting a wide entablature complete with storefront windows. The site is a private residence today and the only cobblestone in East Victor.\n\nBabette Huber, Victor Town Historian, 2013\n\nVillage Street Names Reflect Victor Personages\n\nBy Babette Huber, Victor Town Historian\n\nEllis? Walling? Ketchum? Woodworth? Webster? Andrews? Moore? Coville? Adams? How did these street names come to be?\n\nOne of the earliest streets to be named was Andrews Street—actually it was first recorded as Rowley Lane. That is because Dr. Andrew Rowley owned all of the land from East Main Street north to the end of Rowley Lane/Andrews Street. Dr. Rowley was said to have been very successful, especially in the diseases of women and children, of which he made a specialty, and in surgery. He began his practice in Victor in 1888.\n\nCoville Street is another early street in the village—note that the family that this street is named after is spelled differently. It was named after the Covill family—a prosperous farming family who owned much of the land on the east side of Maple Avenue. On July 4, 1865, less than three months after the Civil War ended, hundreds of people from all around Victor congregated in the village and marched in procession to the Covill grove. There they celebrated the return of peace with Lafayette Seavey reading the Declaration of Independence.\n\nMoore Avenue, which crosses East Main Street at Maple Avenue was named after John Moore. He built the three story brick building on the corner in 1872. It was to house his brother William’s bank. Moore’s bank failed in 1883, but was replaced by another private bank—Parmele, Hamlin and Company Bank which eventually became the Canandaigua National Bank.\n\nWebster Heights, a short street north of Moore Avenue was named after the Webster family.In the early 1900s, Milo F. Webster bought one of the two homes on “the heights” which had been built on the original lot of the Proprietor’s Church—the first meetinghouse in Victor used for all of Victor’s denominations.\n\nStreet names in the relatively new subdivision of Jacob’s Landing off East Street reveal historic personages important to the Village’s history. Walling Street is named about the first President (now called Mayor) of the Village of Victor—James Walling. He built the first mini-mall on East Main Street the Village in 1874 and called it the Walling Block. It burned in 1981 and is now Victor Village Place.\n\nWoodworth Street is named after W. C. Woodworth, whose firm Loomis and Woodworth was among the largest wholesale produce concerns of Western New York. Their place of business was located near the New York Central tracks.\n\nKetchum Street—Jared Ketchum was one of the early settlers who, along with the Boughton family left Stockbridge, Massachusetts and settled in Victor. Mr. Ketchum’s son, Joshua, married Sally Boughton (daughter of Hezekiah Boughton, purchaser of Township #11, Range 4 for 20 cents an acre—now the Town of Victor). He served in the Revolutionary War as a matross (an apprentice gunner).\n\nEllis Street is named after Boliver Ellis. Mr. Ellis was a surveyor and conveyancer, Justice of the Peace, Town Board Member for 24 years, Town Supervisor for 3 years, Ontario County Clerk and a prominent member of the Universalist Church.\n\nAs you walk and drive around the village other street names may intrigue you—Maple Avenue, School Street (where’s the school?), Church Street, High Street… If you would like to see if your street has a history to its name, call me at 742-5065 or Email Babette Huber\n\nc. 2007\n\nInformation for this article was gathered from The Town of Victor Archives."
