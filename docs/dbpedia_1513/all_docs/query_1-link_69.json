        "text": "By Jason Maddux, PennLive deputy opinion editor\n\nCelebrating Constitution Day\n\nToday is Constitution Day. On Sept. 17, 1787, delegates to the Constitutional Convention signed it in Philadelphia. Let's take a look at some interesting facts about the governing document of the United States. We're rolling in the Bill of Rights, too, even though it wasn't approved until 1791 and has its own day (Dec. 15).\n\n1. Only four were famous\n\nThere were 39 signers of the U.S. Constitution plus the convention’s secretary. There are four signers who are no doubt famous: George Washington, James Madison, Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Hamilton. But the dropoff is quick. Did you know Richard Dobbs Spaight of North Carolina, Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer of Maryland, John Langdon of New Hampshire, Nicholas Gilman of New Hampshire and Nathaniel Gorham of Massachusetts were signers? Few people outside their descendants probably do.\n\n2. Pennsylvania is spelled incorrectly ... sort of\n\nOn the part of the Constitution where the signers affixed their names, Pennsylvania is spelled \"Pensylvania,\" with only one \"n.\" It's not really an error, however. It was commonly spelled that way. In fact, it's spelled that way on the Liberty Bell. It is spelled correctly in other instances in the document, however.\n\nRobert Morris\n\n3. He signed the Big Three\n\nOnly two people signed the Declaration of Independence, Articles of Confederation and the U.S. Constitution. One was from Pennsylvania … but it wasn’t Benjamin Franklin. Robert Morris is known to Pennsylvanians because of the university named after him, near Pittsburgh. The “Financier of the Revolution\" lent his house to Presidents George Washington and John Adams when Philadelphia was capital from 1790 to 1800. The outline of that house can be seen near the entrance of Liberty Bell Center. Bonus: Roger Sherman of Connecticut is the other signer of all three.\n\n4. You've never heard of the man who wrote \"We the People\"\n\nGouverneur Morris was one of the youngest delegates, and he was originally from the Bronx, although he later moved to Philadelphia and represented Pennsylvania at the convention. He spoke 173 times at the convention, more than any other delegate. No less than James Madison called him the \"penman of the Constitution.\" In 1780, he lost his leg in a carriage accident and had a wooden replacement. He also was apparently quite the ladies' man.\n\n5. If you have Pennsylvania's Bill of RIghts, please return it\n\nNo one is absolutely certain what happened to Pennsylvania’s original version of the Bill of Rights. After the Bill of Rights was approved, each state received a copy, meaning 14 existed. According to the National Archive, eight states still have their copies — Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. Pennsylvania’s copy was likely stolen in the late 19th century.\n\nA copy of the Bill of Rights given as a gift to the New York Public Library in 1896, however, is believed to be Pennsylvania's missing copy. The states agreed to share custody of the document, and it is on public display at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. New York also doesn't have its original version.\n\nJoseph Torsella, President of the National Constitution Center, speaks at a news conference, while standing next to an original copy of the Bill of Rights, at the FBI office in Philadelphia Wednesday, March 19, 2003. The document, one of 14 original copies of the Bill of Rights that were owned by the 13 original colonies and the federal government, was stolen from the North Carolina statehouse by a Union soldier during the Civil War, and recently recovered by federal investigators. (AP Photo/Jacqueline Larma)\n\nOne more fun fact about missing Bills of Rights: North Carolina's was missing after being stolen by Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's troops during the Civil War. It was recovered during an FBI sting ... that was executed in Philadelphia. A collector tried to sell it to the National Constitution Center.\n\nTahera Hasan, left, and Molly Yun, both with the City Tavern restaurant, accompanied by Bill Robling portraying Ben Franklin, stand at the entrance of Franklin Court and the Independence National Historical Park's (INHP) new Benjamin Franklin Museum, Tuesday, Aug. 20, 2013, in Philadelphia. The new museum in Franklin Court, a site where Franklin actually lived, is a re-imagining of the Underground Museum, opened in 1976 as part of the Bicentennial celebration. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\n6. They partied\n\nThe City Tavern was a common gathering spot. On Sept. 14, 1787, two days before the signing of the Constitution, delegates entertained George Washington there with a farewell dinner. The original bill remains and includes \"To 55 Gentlemans Dinners & Fruit\" and \"54 Bottles of Madera, 60 of Claret ditto, 8 ditto of Old Stock, 22 Bottles of Porter ditto, 8 of Cyder ditto, 12 ditto Beer, (and) 7 Large Bowels of Punch.\" After the signing of the 17th, they also gathered there, but that bill apparently does not exist.\n\n7. We're really not a democracy\n\nThe Constitution does not lay out a democracy, at least in the purest sense of the word. The word is never used in the document. It lays out a republic, where citizens elect others to represent them. A pure democracy would mean citizens would gather and vote on each topic at hand. The term representative democracy has been coined to describe the United States, but a representative democracy sure sounds like a republic.\n\n8. The original proposed 2nd Amendment is now the 27th\n\nThere were 12 amendments initially offered, but the first two didn't pass the states. The original 2nd Amendment s now the 27th Amendment: Congress can't give itself a raise. It can only give future Congresses a raise. A college student in 1982 realized that although it was rejected, there was no time frame put on how long states had to approve it. He started a successful push for it to become an amendment almost 200 years later. The original proposed 1st Amendment had to do with apportionment of the House of Representatives.\n\n9. This was all done in secret\n\nThe Constitution was discussed in secret. Reporters and other visitors could not attend sessions. (There were 10 newspapers in Philadelphia at the time). Fortunately, James Madison kept detailed notes.\n\n10. Pennsylvania had the most signers\n\nEight of the signers were from Pennsylvania, the most of any state: Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Mifflin, Robert Morris , George Clymer, Thomas FitzSimons, Jared Ingersoll, James Wilson (who lived in Carlisle) and Gouverneur Morris.\n\n11. One state didn't send any delegates and didn't sign it"
