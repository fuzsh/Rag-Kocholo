        "text": "What would America be like today without the Constitution? Bryce Sherwood, a young senatorial aide whose star is rising, is a key player in an attempt to pass an amendment that would eliminate the checks and balances built into the Constitution. When Nathaniel Gorham, one of the original Founding Fathers, appears to him, he is transported into a world where the Constitution was never ratified. In this strange world of oppression and fear, Bryce begins to learn the true value of the Constitution and the price of freedom. But will he be able to pay that price? Or will it cost him the love of Leslie Adams and her politically powerful family? Fans of Gerald Lund everywhere will enjoy The Freedom Factor, a gripping novel of courage and love that goes to the heart of the political strategem and maneuvers of present-day Washington, D.C."
