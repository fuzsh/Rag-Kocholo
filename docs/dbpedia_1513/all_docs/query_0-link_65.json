        "text": "Hopewell, Seneca, Gorham\n\nFor pure rural Americana visit the largely agricultural communities of Hopewell, Seneca, and Gorham for level farmscapes and gentle rolling hills where you may count more cows than people and weekend church suppers are the best place to dine. It is not uncommon to come upon a Mennonite family travelling by horse and buggy to church, school, or market.\n\nAlthough similar in many ways, each town has its own unique flavor. To read about Seneca, click here. To read about Gorham, click here. To read about Hopewell, continue on.\n\nTown of Hopewell\n\nAt first glance, the Town of Hopewell seems like a sleepy little place, particularly the northern section. There are certainly more farms than shopping plazas, and because many residents who live there have a Canandaigua mailing address, people sometimes refer to Hopewell as Canandaigua.\n\nJump To:\n\nFast Facts\n\nIndustry\n\nEducation\n\nLandmarks and Attractions\n\nEvents\n\nCommunity Resources\n\nIn the southern part of Hopewell there are larger pockets of population that are bustling with activities surrounding education, the arts and shopping.

In autumn, there is apple picking, a corn maze, a pumpkin patch, and hay rides to enjoy and celebrate the agricultural bounty of Seneca.\n\nFlint Creek runs through Seneca, and you can hike, bike, cross-country ski, or snowshoe along Ontario Pathways, a 23-mile V-shaped rail trail that has a trailhead in Stanley, another town of Seneca hamlet.\n\nTown of Seneca Fast Facts\n\nHistory\n\nThe town of Seneca was settled in 1790, shortly after the land was purchased from the Seneca through the Phelps & Gorham Purchase.

What draws many to this peaceful and scenic community is its picturesque farmscapes, treasured lakefront (there are nearly 7 miles of Canandaigua Lake shoreline), quaint lakeside cottages and homes, and a reverence for historic preservation.\n\nJump to:\n\nFast Facts\n\nIndustry\n\nEducation\n\nLandmarks and Attractions\n\nCommunity Resources\n\nFarming has always been the backbone of the economy, with many local farm families stretching back generations. Decades ago, the town was home to canning and pickling factories that processed the vegetables and fruits grown nearby, but as that industry faded, dairy farming began to take root and new businesses have taken up residence in some of these old factories.\n\nIn recent years, many horse-and-buggy Mennonite families have settled in the area from Pennsylvania and other parts of the Finger Lakes. These families have not only embraced farming and added diversity in crop production, but some have also started other related farm businesses such as welding shops and building contractors.\n\nBecause of the beautiful views throughout Gorham, outdoor recreation is a popular activity with many road biking options along the wide rural roads that receive little traffic. Gorham is also a great town for a Sunday drive, where you can enjoy a Mennonite schoolhouse, a glittering lake dotted with sailboats and a panoramic view of rolling hills and old barns all within a few miles.\n\nHalf of the village of Rushville is in Gorham, with the remainder in the Yates County town of Potter. The historic Crystal Beach and Cottage City neighborhoods along Canandaigua Lake were first developed in the late 1800s as summer cottages for Rochester residents.\n\nTown of Gorham Fast Facts\n\nHistory\n\nThe town of Gorham was originally established in 1796 as East Town. The name was later changed to Easton, then Lincoln, and finally Gorham in 1807, after Nathaniel Gorham. Gorham was one of the two land prospectors who made the Phelps & Gorham Purchase of 1788.\n\nPopulation\n\n4,274 (2010 Census)\n\nSize\n\n53.2 square miles (including 4.3 square miles of water)\n\nLocation\n\nThe town of Gorham is southeast of Canandaigua. Canandaigua Lake creates its western border, the town of Seneca is to the east, Yates County is to the south and Hopewell is to the north. Major roadways include Route 245, Route 247 and Route 364.\n\nTerrain\n\nGorham is mostly farmland with scenic rolling hills that get steeper as you head west toward Canandaigua Lake.\n\nKey Industries\n\nAgriculture: Farming, in particular, dairy farming, is the foundation of the town's economy, though in recent years many farms have diversified to include vegetables and other crops. There are also several supporting agriculture-related businesses.\n\nLight manufacturing and construction: Flint Creek Resources, Inc. recycles glass polishing compounds for secondary use.
