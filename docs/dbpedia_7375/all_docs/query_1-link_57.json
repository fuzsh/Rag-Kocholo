But aside from that life-changing perk, they receive other rewards such as world ranking points and a whole lot of cash. Here's a breakdown of their winnings:\n\nPrize money: It varies from year to year depending on the total purse. In 2023, Brooks Koepka won the most money of any PGA Championship in the past at a cool $3.1 million.\n\nTrophy: Generally speaking, every golfer loves to hoist a shiny trophy up for photos at the end of the championship. The winner of the PGA Championship is awarded the iconic Wanamaker trophy, named after businessman and golfer, Rodman Wanamaker. The winner gets to keep the trophy for a year but must return it at the following year's championship. They then receive a 90% sized replica trophy to keep permanently.\n\nTour exemptions: A huge benefit of winning this championship are the exemptions that the winner receives toward future events. They're guaranteed an invitation to play in all future PGA Championships for the rest of their career. This means they don't have to worry about qualifying for the event through world rankings.\n\nTour memberships: The winner receives a five-year PGA Tour card as well as a seven-year DP World Tour card. Players who have not won a Major must earn a tour card by winning tournaments throughout the season.\n\nWorld ranking points: The PGA Championship winner receives 100 World Golf Ranking points, and this can be very meaningful.\n\nWho has won the PGA Championship the most?\n\nTwo golfers in history are tied for the most wins at the PGA Championship – each with 5 wins. From the match play era, Walter Hagen originally set the record winning in 1921, 1924, 1925, 1926 and 1927. In the more recent stroke play era, Jack Nicklaus tied it up with wins in 1963, 1971, 1973, 1975 and 1980.\n\nIn summary\n\nIn professional golf, winning the PGA Championship means you've probably cemented your career in an extremely competitive sport. Though most golfers will tell you that winning one championship only makes you hungrier for more. The winnings, while grand, can be no match for an almost insatiable desire to be known as a legend.\n\nTraveling to this year's PGA Championship?
