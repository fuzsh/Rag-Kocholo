        "text": "Fresh off a successful summer on the world stage, Inverness Club has been tapped by the U.S. Golf Association as the site of the 2029 U.S. Amateur.\n\nThe news caps a successful run for the recently restored Donald Ross classic. The course in Toledo, Ohio, was the site of this year's Solheim Cup, and hosted the LPGA Drive On Championship and in 2020 and the 2019 U.S. Junior Amateur.\n\nWhen the Junior Amateur returns to northwestern Ohio on Aug. 13-19, 2029, it will be the second time Inverness has hosted the event and the club's ninth USGA event overall. Craig Stadler beat David Strawn 6-and-5 in 1973 in the only other U.S. Amateur at Inverness.\n\nOther USGA events at Inverness include the 1920 U.S. Open won by Ted Ray, 1931 (Billy Burke) and 1957 (Dick Mayer) and 1979 (Hale Irwin).\n\nThe announcement is a fitting continuation of success for the club where the USGA Green Section was founded in advance of the 1920 U.S. Open.\n\nThe influence of the Green Section is evident still today at Inverness, where John Zimmers is superintendent and where architect Andrew Green completed a restoration in 2017 that brought back many of Ross's design elements that had been lost through the years.\n\nThe club, where Byron Nelson was the pro from 1940-44, already was entrenched in men's championship golf. Inverness was the site of two PGA Championships (1986, '93), two U.S. Senior Open Championships (2003, '11)."
