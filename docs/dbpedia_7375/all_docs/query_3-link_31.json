Winner of both the Masters and PGA Championship in 1956, this son of a golf professional has enjoyed a remarkable lifetime through the game, with the Texan playing and twice captaining in the Ryder Cup.\n\nBurke has remained active courtesy of his ownership of the Champions Golf Club in Houston, which hosted the US Women's Open in 2020. More recently, the venue was sold to his son, but the joint-founder has remained chairman, a position he will hold for the remainder of his life.\n\nThe longevity of this World Golf of Fame member got us thinking about the oldest professional major champions alive today, with 24 men and women who etched their name in history currently in their 80s and 90s.\n\n(87-Year-Old Gary Player - Image Credit: Kevin Diss Photography)\n\nJack Burke Jr\n\nDate of Birth: 29/01/1923\n\nNationality: United States\n\nMajor Championships Won: 1956 Masters Tournament, 1956 PGA Championship\n\nBetsy Rawls\n\nDate of Birth: 04/05/1928\n\nNationality: United States\n\nMajor Championships Won: Western Open (1952, 1959), Women's PGA Championship (1959, 1969), US Women's Open (1951, 1953, 1957, 1960)\n\nDon January\n\nDate of Birth: 20/11/1929\n\nNationality: United States\n\nMajor Championships Won: 1967 PGA Championship\n\nKathy Cornelius\n\nDate of Birth: 27/10/1932\n\nNationality: United States\n\nMajor Championships Won: 1956 US Women's Open\n\nJoyce Ziske\n\nDate of Birth: 1934\n\nNationality: United States\n\nMajor Championships Won: 1960 Western Open\n\nMarlene Hagge\n\nDate of Birth: 16/02/1934\n\nNationality: United States\n\nMajor Championships Won: 1956 Women's PGA Championship\n\nGary Player\n\nDate of Birth: 01/11/1935\n\nNationality: South Africa\n\nMajor Championships Won: Masters Tournament (1961, 1974, 1978), PGA Championship (1962, 1972), 1965 US Open, The Open Championship (1959, 1968, 1974)\n\nSir Bob Charles\n\nDate of Birth: 14/03/1936\n\nNationality: New Zealand\n\nMajor Championships Won: 1963 Open Championship\n\nBobby Nichols\n\nDate of Birth: 14/04/1936\n\nNationality: United States\n\nMajor Championships Won: 1964 PGA Championship\n\nTommy Aaron\n\nDate of Birth: 22/03/1937\n\nNationality: United States\n\nMajor Championships Won: 1973 Masters Tournament\n\nCharles Coody\n\nDate of Birth: 13/07/1937\n\nNationality: United States\n\nMajor Championships Won: 1971 Masters Tournament\n\nAl Geiberger\n\nDate of Birth: 01/09/1937\n\nNationality: United States\n\nMajor Championships Won: 1966 PGA Championship\n\nLou Graham\n\nDate of Birth: 07/01/1938\n\nNationality: United States\n\nMajor Championships Won: 1975 US Open\n\nJudy Kimball\n\nDate of Birth: 17/06/1938\n\nNationality: United States\n\nMajor Championships Won: 1962 Women's PGA Championship\n\nMurle Breer\n\nDate of Birth: 20/01/1939\n\nNationality: United States\n\nMajor Championships Won: 1962 US Women's Open\n\nJoAnne Carner\n\nDate of Birth: 04/04/1939\n\nNationality: United States\n\nMajor Championships Won: US Women's Open (1971, 1976)\n\nLee Trevino\n\nDate of Birth: 01/12/1939\n\nNationality: United States\n\nMajor Championships Won: PGA Championship (1974, 1984), US Open (1968, 1971), The Open Championship (1971, 1972)\n\nMary Mills\n\nDate of Birth: 19/01/1940\n\nNationality: United States\n\nMajor Championships Won: Women's PGA Championship (1964, 1973), 1963 US Women's Open\n\nJack Nicklaus\n\nDate of Birth: 21/01/1940\n\nNationality: United States\n\nMajor Championships Won: Masters Tournament (1963, 1965, 1966, 1972, 1975, 1986), PGA Championship (1963, 1971, 1973, 1975, 1980), US Open (1962, 1967, 1972, 1980), The Open Championship (1966, 1970, 1978)\n\nSusie Berning\n\nDate of Birth: 22/07/1941\n\nNationality: United States\n\nMajor Championships Won: 1965 Western Open, US Women's Open (1968, 1972, 1973)\n\nGloria Ehret\n\nDate of Birth: 23/08/1941\n\nNationality: United States\n\nMajor Championships Won: 1966 Women's PGA Championship\n\nDave Stockton\n\nDate of Birth: 02/11/1941\n\nNationality: United States\n\nMajor Championships Won: PGA Championship (1970, 1976)\n\nRaymond Floyd\n\nDate of Birth: 04/09/1942\n\nNationality: United States\n\nMajor Championships Won: 1976 Masters Tournament, PGA Championship (1969, 1982), 1986 US Open\n\nJerilyn Britz\n\nDate of Birth: 01/01/1943\n\nNationality: United States\n\nMajor Championships Won: 1979 US Women's Open\n\nRelated Content\n\nThe 10 Most Influential Golfers of All Time\n\nThe Greatest Masters Tournaments in History\n\nThe Greatest Open Championships in History\n\nThe Greatest PGA Champions in History"
