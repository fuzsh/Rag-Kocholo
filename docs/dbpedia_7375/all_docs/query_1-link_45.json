        "text": "155 of the top women's golfers in the world will descend on Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa, Okla., from August 5 to August 11.\n\nLast year\n\nAuburn University standout Megan Schofill, 22, of Monticello, Fla., defeated SEC conference rival Latanna Stone of LSU 4 and 3, in the 36-hole final at Bel-Air Country Club in Los Angeles, Calif. She became the first Floridian to hoist the Robert Cox Trophy since Morgan Pressel in 2005.\n\n“It's definitely a dream come true,” Schofill told the USGA after the win. “I’m definitely still in shock. I can't put it into words the emotions I'm feeling. It's just such an honor to be able to say I won here this year.”\n\nPast events held at Southern Hills\n\n1946 U.S. Women's Amateur (Babe Didrikson Zaharias)\n\n1953 U.S. Junior Amateur (Rex Baxter Jr.)\n\n1958 U.S. Open (Tommy Bolt)\n\n1961 U.S. Senior Amateur (Dexter Daniels)\n\n1965 U.S. Amateur (Bob Murphy)\n\n1970 PGA Championship (Dave Stockton)\n\n1977 U.S. Open (Hubert Green)\n\n1982 PGA Championship (Raymond Floyd)\n\n1987 U.S. Women's Mid-Amateur (Cindy Scholefield-McConnell)\n\n1994 PGA Championship (Nick Price)\n\n1995 Tour Championship (Billy Mayfair)\n\n1996 Tour Championship (Tom Lehman)\n\n2001 U.S. Open (Retief Goosen)\n\n2007 PGA Championship (Tiger Woods)\n\n2009 U.S. Amateur (Byeong-Hun An)\n\n2021 Senior PGA Championship (Alex Cejka)\n\n2022 PGA Championship (Justin Thomas)\n\nHistory of the championship\n\nThe U.S. Women’s Amateur Championship is one of the United States Golf Association’s original three championships. It was first conducted in 1895, shortly after the inaugural U.S. Amateur and U.S. Open. The Women’s Amateur has been conducted every year since, except 1917-18, when it was suspended due to World War I, and 1942-45, when it was suspended due to World War II.\n\nThe most decorated champion is Glenna Collett Vare, a lifelong amateur who won the Cox Trophy a record six times. Second to Vare is JoAnne Gunderson Carner, who won five U.S. Women’s Amateur Championships. Combined with her two wins in the U.S. Women’s Open and one victory in the U.S. Girls’ Junior, Carner’s eight USGA titles are tied with Jack Nicklaus and eclipsed only by Bob Jones and Tiger Woods, who have each won nine.\n\nU.S. Women’s Amateur champions seem to possess a remarkable facility to repeat. Beatrix Hoyt, Alexa Stirling, Vare, Virginia Van Wie and Juli Inkster have all won the U.S. Women’s Amateur three consecutive times. Another seven champions – Genevieve Hecker, Dorothy Campbell, Margaret Curtis, Betty Jameson, Kay Cockerill, Kelli Kuehne and Danielle Kang – have won two in a row.\n\nThe U.S. Women’s Amateur has long identified some of golf’s greatest female players, many of whom have gone on to successful professional careers. Along with the champions listed above, Patty Berg, Babe Didrikson Zaharias, Louise Suggs, Marlene Stewart Streit, Anne Quast Sander, Barbara McIntire, Catherine Lacoste, Carol Semple Thompson, Beth Daniel, Morgan Pressel and Lydia Ko have secured a place in golf history.\n\nNotable U.S. Women’s Amateur champions"
