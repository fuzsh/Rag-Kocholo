        "text": "The 1957 U.S. Open was the 57th time the tournament was played, and it required an 18-hole playoff to settle the winner. This is also the U.S. Open in which Jack Nicklaus made his tournament debut.\n\nWinner: Dick Mayer, 282\n\nWhere it was played: Inverness Club in Toledo, Ohio\n\nTournament dates: June 13-16, 1957\n\nLeader after first round: Jimmy Demaret and Chick Harbert, 68\n\nLeader after second round: Billy Joe Patton, 138\n\nLeader after third round: Jimmy Demaret, 211\n\nWhat Happened at the 1957 U.S. Open\n\nDick Mayer defeated defending champion Cary Middlecoff in an 18-hole playoff to win the 1957 U.S. Open, a playoff that is perhaps best remembered for a ... stool. Middlecoff was a painfully slow player, possibly the slowest great player in golf history. Mayer knew he'd spend a lot of time in the playoff waiting. So he came prepared: He brought a fold-out camping stool with him, and whenever Middlecoff made him wait too long, Mayer simply took a seat.\n\nIt worked (or something did, anyway): Mayer easily won the playoff, beating Middlecoff 72 to 79. Middlecoff was a 3-time major winner already, nearing the end of his career. He won only three more times (for 39 career PGA Tour victories) after this.\n\nMayer had seven career wins and this was his only major, but 1957 was a great year for him. He made the Ryder Cup team, led the tour in money and was named Player of the Year.\n\nJimmy Demaret, 47 years old, led Mayer by a stroke at the start of the final round, but Demaret started badly and wound up a stroke out of the playoff. Middlecoff started the final round three behind leader Demaret and two behind Mayer, then shot 68 — including birdies on two of the last three holes — to Mayer's 70 (Demaret carded a 72), forcing the playoff.\n\nIn the playoff, Mayer went two ahead with a birdie on the sixth hole, then Middlecoff bogeyed the seventh and eighth holes. Mayer led by three shots at the turn. It was essentially over when Middlecoff made double-bogey on the 10th, and he later added a quadruple-bogey on the 15th.\n\nMayer was using unusual golf shafts: They were steel wrapped in fiberglass. The golf media of the time called these \"glass-shafted clubs\" or \"glass shafts,\" and the players referred to them as \"glassies.\"\n\nA 17-year-old amateur named Jack Nicklaus made his U.S. Open debut this year, shooting consecutive 80s and missing the cut. Amateur Billy Joe Patton was tied for the lead after 36 holes, but finished with back-to-back 76s. He still earned low amateur honors. Three-time major winner Denny Shute played in the U.S. Open for the final time this year, missing the cut.\n\n1957 U.S. Open Final Scores\n\nDick Mayer 70-68-74-70—282 Cary Middlecoff 71-75-68-68—282 Jimmy Demaret 68-73-70-72—283 Julius Boros 69-75-70-70—284 Walter Burkemo 74-73-72-65—284 Fred Hawkins 72-72-71-71—286 Ken Venturi 69-71-75-71—286 Roberto De Vicenzo 72-70-72-76—290 Chick Harbert 68-79-71-72—290 Billy Maxwell 70-76-72-72—290 a-Billy Joe Patton 70-68-76-76—290 Sam Snead 74-74-69-73—290 Mike Fetchick 74-71-71-75—291 Dow Finsterwald 74-72-72-73—291 a-William Hyndman 77-73-72-69—291 Frank Stanahan 72-76-69-74—291 Don Fairfield 78-72-73-69—292 Jim Ferree 74-74-73-71—292 Doug Ford 69-71-80-72—292 Bud Ward 70-74-70-78—292 Bo Wininger 70-71-76-76—293 George Bayer 73-77-69-75—294 a-Joe Campbell 74-72-73-75—294 Ed \"Porky\" Oliver 74-73-73-74—294 Peter Thomson 71-72-74-77—294 Jack Fleck 72-76-73-74—295 Gerald Kesselring 74-71-75-75—295 Sam Penecale 71-73-73-78—295 a-Harvie Ward 72-75-74-74—295 Leo Biagetti 73-75-72-76—296 Johnny Revolta 76-74-74-72—296 a-Charles Kocsis 76-74-74-73—297 Stan Leonard 71-76-73-77—297 Gene Littler 73-76-73-75—297 Jerry Barber 75-73-73-77—298 Otto Greiner 76-74-75-73—298 Fred Haas 72-73-77-76—298 Furman Hayes 74-75-70-80—299 Babe Lichardus 72-76-74-77—299 Lew Worsham 78-72-76-73—299 Johnny Pott 74-75-74-77—300 Donald Whitt 71-77-78-75—301 Al Brosch 72-76-72-82—302 Clarence Doser 72-78-76-76—302 Bob Gadja 75-75-78-75—303 Howie Johnson 72-77-77-77—303 Al Mengert 77-73-71-82—303 Leland Gibson 75-75-76-78—304 Stan Mosel 74-75-77-78—304 a-E.
