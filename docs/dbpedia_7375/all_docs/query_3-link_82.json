        "text": "The month of June brings the third men’s professional major tournament of the year in the U.S. Open.\n\nSince 1895, the United States Open has been home to some of golf’s brightest moments in the history of the sport from Tiger Woods lapping the field in 2000 for the largest margin of victory at a major championship at Pebble Beach or his injury-riddled come-from-behind victory at Torrey Pines in 2008.\n\nSome other great moments include Brooks Koepka becoming the first back-to-back U.S. Open winner in 30 years in 2018-19 since Curtis Strange as well as Payne Stewart’s victory in 1999, just four months before his eventual passing in a plane crash for his second U.S. Open title and his third major victory.\n\nWho won the U.S. Open 2024\n\nIn 2024, Bryson DeChambeau made par on the 72nd hole to defeat Rory McIlroy by one stroke to earn his second U.S. Open title. DeChambeau did his best to limit his mistakes, with one bogey over his final five holes, compared to McIlroy having three bogeys over his final five holes, including two missed par putts from inside five feet.\n\nDeChambeau became the fourth player to win a U.S. Amateur and multiple U.S. Open Championships, joining the list that includes Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus and Bobby Jones.\n\nWho won the U.S. Open 2023\n\nIn 2023, Wyndham Clark won his first major championship at 10-under par to defeat a surging Rory McIlroy by one stroke at the Los Angeles Country Club.\n\nRelated: Top Takeaways from Wyndham Clark’s U.S. Open victory\n\nThe history behind the U.S. Open trophy\n\nThe U.S. Open championship trophy is one of the oldest trophies in all of sports, dating back to its inception tournament in 1895 at Newport Golf Club in Rhode Island. The sterling silver trophy is 18 inches tall and made by the Gorham Company.\n\nLike the Claret Jug for the winner of the Open Championship, the winner of the U.S. Open receives the trophy in a ceremony after the conclusion of the tournament and keeps it until the next tournament.\n\nWhat does the winner receive?\n\nThis is what the U.S. Open champions receives after grinding through at least 72 holes and four rounds of golf.\n\nThe Jack Nicklaus Medal\n\nCustody of the U.S. Open Trophy for one year and a replica trophy\n\nExemptions into the next 10 U.S. Open Championships\n\nInvitations to the next 5 Masters Tournaments\n\nExemptions into the next 5 PGA Championships\n\nExemptions into the next 5 Open Championships conducted by The R&A\n\nExemptions into the next five Players Championships\n\nExempt status on the PGA Tour for the next five years\n\nName engraved on the plaque for the USGA championship season in USGA Museum’s Hall of Champions\n\nRelated: 10 best Open Championship performances of all-time\n\nWhat was the best score to win the U.S. Open?\n\nThe lowest 72-hole score to win the U.S. Open was by Rory McIlroy in 2011. On the Blue Course at Congressional in Bethesda, Md., McIlroy shot a 268, highlighted by an opening round 6-under 65.\n\nMcIlroy holds the record by three strokes to Martin Kaymer’s 271 in 2014 at Pinehurst Resort and Country Club, the same site for the 2024 U.S. Open.\n\nU.S. Open Winners\n\nHere’s a look at all of the past U.S. Open champions.\n\nWho has won the most U.S. Opens?\n\nWillie Anderson was the first player in U.S. Open history to win four times, which came in a five-year span. Anderson is also the only player in history to win the U.S. Open three consecutive times/\n\nAs the decades passed, Bobby Jones, as an amateur, joined Anderson with four U.S. Open titles, followed by Ben Hogan, and Jack Nicklaus.\n\nHere is the list of the winners of the U.S. Open who have hoisted the trophy multiple times."
