        "text": "The eldest son of Texas trailblazing club pro Jack Burke, Sr., Jackie Burke, Jr. was born in Fort Worth on January 29, 1923, and started playing golf at the age of seven. The younger Burke graduated from St. Thomas High School in Houston in 1940. While still an amateur he qualified for the 1941 U.S. Open, the first to be played in Texas, He turned professional later in 1941. From 1942 to 1946 he served in the Marine Corps and was stationed at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar where he taught combat skills to Marines headed overseas for World War II.\n\nAfter the war, Burke resumed his golf career after first considering work in the oil fields of Texas. His first job was as a teaching pro at Hollywood Golf Club in Deal, New Jersey, which was followed by a position as an assistant at Winged Foot Golf Club, where he was mentored by Claude Harmon. From early 1948 he was the club professional at Metropolis Country Club in White Plains, New York.\n\nHe will always be remembered for his string of four consecutive victories (Texas Open, Houston Open, Baton Rouge Open, and St. Petersburg Open) in 1952. Burke’s earnings for his four wins only amounted to $8,000. At the end of the season, he had pocketed $21,000 and was third on the money list. But his best years were yet to come.\n\nIn 1952, he won both the Vardon Trophy with a stroke average of 70.54 and was named Player of the Year. During his playing career, Burke won 17 PGA Tour titles, most notably the 1956 Masters and 1956 PGA Championship, and was named PGA Player of the Year that year.\n\nBurke was on five successive U.S. Ryder Cup teams from 1951 to 1959. He was the playing captain in 1957 and the non-playing captain in 1973. He was inducted into the PGA Hall of Fame in 1976, the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 1978 and the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nThe late Jimmy Demaret was Burke’s life-long friend, confidant and business partner. In 1957, they built the famed Champions Golf Club in Houston, site of the 1967 Ryder Cup matches and the 1969 U.S. Open. When Demaret died in 1983, Burke became the sole owner.\n\nIn 2004, Jackie Burke Jr. was awarded the Bob Jones Award for the recognition of distinguished sportsmanship in golf.\n\nJackie passed away on January 19, 2024, just a few days before his 101st birthday."
