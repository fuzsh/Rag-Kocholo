Here's a course that has hosted four U.S. Opens and two\n\nPGA Championships among other major events. Not to mention that Byron Nelson\n\nwas the club professional from 1940-45. The USGA has made six stops to\n\nInverness Club, including the 1920 U.S. Open won by Edward Ray, which was the\n\nfirst Open for Bobby Jones and Gene Sarazen. During that Open, the\n\nprofessionals competing in the event were allowed access into the clubhouse\n\nfor the first time in golf history. Remembering that gesture, players of the\n\n1931 U.S. Open took up a collection and presented the Club with a huge\n\ncathedral chime clock on the final day of the event. The clock is still part\n\nof the Inverness history. The 1957 championship, captured by Dick Mayer in a\n\nplayoff, was where Jack Nicklaus made his debut. The 79th U.S. Open was dubbed\n\n\"The Best Open Ever\" by the USGA, as Hale Irwin hung on despite bogeys on the\n\nfinal two holes for his second of three U.S. Open titles. Talk about a\n\ndramatic finish, how about the 1986 PGA Championship that saw Bob Tway holing\n\nout from the front bunker on the final hole to defeat Greg Norman or the 1993\n\nPGA where Paul Azinger defeated Norman on the second playoff hole after the\n\n\"Shark\" lipped out for birdie on the first extra hole. The Club was originally\n\nfounded in 1903 with nine holes designed by Bernard Nichols on 78 acres of\n\nland purchased for $12,000. The site was selected due to its rich, sandy soil,\n\nwell-drained by a brook (Inverness Byrne) and its perfect location along a\n\nstreetcar line. Sixteen years later, famed architect Donald Ross was brought\n\nin to transform the nine-hole layout into 18 championship-quality holes. Over\n\nthe years, some of the finest architect's have come in to tweak and lengthen\n\nthe course, such as A.W. Tillinghast, Tom Fazio and club member, Arthur Hills.\n\nThe course has been lengthened from 6,229 yards in 1930 to its present yardage\n\nof 7,255. The clubhouse was twice destroyed by fire in 1911 and in 1918 and\n\nhas since received extensive renovations, including a major overhaul in 1999.\n\nREVIEW: The course opens with a relatively simple par-four of just 395 yards,\n\nwith a series of bunkers guarding the entire left side of the landing area. A\n\nthree-metal is all that is needed off the tee, as the fairway runs out to only\n\n285 yards. A severe, steep downslope, covered by rough awaits the big hitter\n\nwho tries to chew off too much. The green, just 21 yards in depth is framed by\n\na pair of bunkers and is well sloped. Another short par-four stands ahead, as\n\nthe second hole, 10 yards shorter than the first, is straightaway with three\n\nbunkers guarding the landing area 277 yards out. The green is just five yards\n\nlarger than number one, but it is very undulating with sand left and right.\n\nDon't be disappointed with back-to-back pars, that's a good score. The par-\n\nthree third presents many challenges for the player, since the putting surface\n\nfeatures three distinct levels, which allow for many hole positions. By the\n\nway, a pond guards the entire right side while a bunker awaits on the bail out\n\nside. After three somewhat easy holes, the Inverness Byrne makes its way to\n\nyou by way of the fourth hole. A classic four-par, this 466-yarder bends\n\nslightly to the left and possesses three bunkers along the right side of the\n\nfairway and trees left. A ball landing in the rough will have a tough time\n\nreaching this elevated green and will flirt with the brook trying to find a\n\nlayup area. Only one bunker is needed to guard the green, as the surface is\n\nvery slick. The Byrne winds its way to the fifth hole, as it cuts across the\n\nfront of the tee and runs all along the right side of the fairway to the green\n\nof this demanding dogleg left. Accuracy is needed off the tee, as the fairway\n\nnarrows at the landing area. Missing left is no bargain, as trees will block\n\nour attempt to reach the green. At 29 yards, the fifth green is one of the\n\nlargest on the course, but don't be deceived, as the surface features a\n\nhogback which slopes towards the water. Just when you thought you could take a\n\nbreak, the longest par-three on the course awaits at number six. The green is\n\nslightly elevated and is protected right by a pair of bunkers with one left of\n\nthe 26-yard deep surface. Take bogey (par if your lucky) and move on. There is\n\nno question that the seventh is the \"signature hole\" at Inverness. This hole\n\nfeatures beauty and brawn, as the player admires from the elevated tee box.\n\nOnce again the creek crosses where the fairway begins and then winds its way\n\nalong the right side of the fairway. From the tips, a 240-yard blast is\n\nrequired just to carry the creek on the right side, as the fairway bends to\n\nthe right. A series of 20 or so mounds protect the left side, as players who\n\nmiss the fairway will have to negotiate to layup. A long iron or fairway metal\n\nwill be needed just to reach the elevated surface, which slopes from back to\n\nfront. This hole is a perfect example that sand is not needed all the time, as\n\nno bunkers adorn the hole. One of the most famous holes in golf, the par-five\n\neighth is next and not because of its beauty or length. During the 1979 U.S.\n\nOpen, Lon Hinkle took a shortcut from the tee, as he played down the adjacent\n\n17th fairway in an attempt to reach the green in two. When Hinkle arrived the\n\nfollowing day, he found that the USGA had planted trees to the left of the tee\n\nbox, thus forcing the players to place their tee shots towards the correct\n\nfairway. The dogleg left is the longest on the course and requires pinpoint\n\naccuracy, as bunkers guard the corner off the tee with the creek crossing 185\n\nyards from the green. The putting surface is elevated and protected nicely by\n\nthree difficult bunkers, as this two-tiered green is no pushover for birdie.\n\nThe ninth hole returns to the clubhouse, but provides no rest for the weary at\n\n468 yards from the championship box. This hole was originally built as a par-\n\nfive, but has been transformed into a rugged two-shotter with a devilishly\n\nsmall (24-yards) green with three large guarding bunkers.\n\nThe 10th hole shares the same bunker complex off the tee as the first, with no\n\nless than eight traps protecting the right side of the fairway. The two holes\n\nare similar, however the 10th green sits down at the bottom of the hill with\n\nthe front of the green protected by the Inverness Byrne. Another tiny green of\n\njust 24 yards is guarded by three bunkers, including a little pot bunker on\n\nthe left. Similar to the second, the 11th is a straightaway par four just 378\n\nyards in length with a very deep green. All that is needed is a three-metal\n\nfrom the tee and a short iron to this narrow, but long surface. One of the\n\neasiest greens, a birdie should be the order of the day. The shortest one-\n\nshotter on the course, the 12th is classic Donald Ross, featuring four bunkers\n\nshaped in a horseshoe around the green. The depth of the surface is 27 yards,\n\nbut has a myriad of humps and bumps, making putting a difficult chore. It\n\nalways seems that the 13th hole on most courses features a risk-reward type of\n\nplay. This par-five can be reached in two by the long hitter, however don't\n\nstray because trouble lurks close by. The player must negotiate a narrow\n\nlanding area 250 yards out, that slopes to the right towards a pair of\n\nbunkers. The second shot then must be placed over the creek, either to a\n\nlanding area just 100 yards out or towards the green and carrying to a second\n\nplateau, elevated and just 65 yards away. The surface is miniscule at 23 yards\n\nwith a large sand bunker left, as the green slopes from back to front. Birdies\n\nshould come in bunches. The course closes with five straight par-fours, all in\n\nvarying length beginning with the monster, 480-yard 14th. The hole bends\n\nslightly to the right with a large landing area, however don't be deceived as\n\ntrees guard the right side and a huge U-shaped bunker, some 50 yards in length\n\nflanks the left. Another small green awaits a long iron, which many consider\n\nto be the toughest at Inverness. Another tester, the 15th shares that same\n\nbunker along its left side with trees and sand on the right. Missing the\n\nfairway will require an excellent layup, as once again the brook of Inverness\n\nawaits, just 100 yards from the green. The second smallest putting surface\n\nfeatures five bunkers surrounding the undulating green, which rarely allows\n\nfor a birdie. Another straight-forward hole, the 16th features an S-shaped\n\nfairway as it winds to the green. Trees and sand flank both sides of the\n\nfairway and after a successful tee shot, a medium to short iron is left. Don't\n\nbe deceived by the bunker short right of the green, take an extra club as the\n\nhole is visually deceptive. The 17th requires length and more length. At 470\n\nyards and doglegging to the left, a bomb down the left side cutting the corner\n\nwill be needed to have any chance of reaching the green. As usual, sand\n\nprotects the inside and the outside of the dogleg. The green complex provides\n\na natural gallery seating, as the surface sits down in a bowl, protected by\n\nsand left and trees right and back. The green slopes drastically to the front\n\nand if your not careful, your first putt just might slide off the surface. One\n\nof the shorter finishing holes in championship play, the 18th is just 354\n\nyards, but is one of the finest closers in golf. The hole requires accuracy,\n\nan iron off the tee, to a fairly wide landing area. This will leave the player\n\nwith a short wedge to an elevated and sloping green. With the clubhouse\n\noverlooking, the putting surface is diabolical with many slopes that fall away\n\nto the right and back. Miss right and your in \"Death Valley\" and bail left and\n\nyour gobbled up by deep bunkers which sit well below the green."
