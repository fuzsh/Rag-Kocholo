        "text": "We Invite You to Explore Our Storied History\n\nWinged Foot Golf Club is a private club with two 18-hole golf courses located in Mamaroneck, New York. The Club was founded in 1921, by a consortium consisting mainly of members of The New York Athletic Club. The Club opened in June 1923. The Founders had such a remarkable vision for the Club is still admired around the world as one of the world's greatest Golf Clubs.\n\nWe have hosted six U.S. Opens, the 1940 U.S. Amateur, the 1949 Walker Cup, and a PGA Championship on our West Course. Our East Course has been the site of two U.S. Women's Opens and the inaugural U.S. Senior Open. The 2004 U.S. Amateur was played over both courses.\n\nThe Club was incorporated in 1921 and the first round of golf was played in 1923.\n\nThe Club's initial charter members came from the New York Athletic Club. Celebrity memberships followed. John Anderson, who had finished second twice in the U.S. Amateur, joined in 1924, shortly after the course was completed. Jess Sweetser, 1922 U.S. Amateur champion and runner-up in 1923, also joined in 1924. Other top golfers in the area migrated from their clubs and sought membership at the Club. The club became recognized nationally when the USGA awarded the 1929 U.S. Open to Winged Foot West. It took only six years for Winged Foot to be selected by the USGA to hold an Open. To this day, Winged Foot West is \"the youngest\" course in history to be so honored.\n\nWinged Foot's Centennial\n\n2023 marked the 100th year since the founding of Winged Foot Golf Club. The Centennial year was marked by numerous commemorative social events, tournaments, special guests and celebrations. A time capsule, originally placed by the founding members in the cornerstone of the Clubhouse, was opened revealing memorabilia from Winged Footâ€™s earliest days. A newly constructed Winged Foot Statue, commemorating 100 years of championship golf and camaraderie was installed in a garden behind the Clubhouse and contains a new time capsule to be opened 100 years hence."
