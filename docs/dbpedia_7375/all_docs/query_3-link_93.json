Based in Oakville, ON, and bearing an honours degree in political science from McMaster University, Ted is a nine-time Golf Journalists Association of Canada award winner, including a 2019 win for his most recent entry, a profile of Corey Conners.\n\nTed’s love of golf journalism began in the mid-1980s as sports editor of the local Glen Abbey community newspaper. After a year of Canadian Open coverage with the town paper, The Oakville Beaver, Ted was hired as ScoreGolf’s Senior Editor. In that role, he helped reshape the ranking mechanism of Score’s Top 100 golf courses, before moving on to edit Ontario Golf magazine, where he fashioned the country’s most transparent course ranking.\n\nAs the first editor of the reinvented Ontario Golf, his cover profiles included some of Canada’s most noted personalities, from Kurt Browning, Peter Mansbridge, astronaut Chris Hadfield and the late actor/singer Michael Burgess to Donovan Bailey, Tom Cochrane and The Tragically Hip, and from Red Green and poker legend Daniel Negreanu to billionaire Robert Herjavek.

She was the 1998 Ontario Women’s Match Play Champion, the 2009 Women’s Four Ball Champion (with Susan Wickware), the Ontario Senior Women’s Champion for 2016, 2017 and 2018, and the Ontario Ladies Mid-Amateur Champion for 2017.\n\nHer skill and determination continued through to Canadian events to include national titles, winning the 2016 Canadian Women’s Senior Championship and the 2016 Canadian Women’s Mid-Am Championship.\n\nOn the international stage, Kyrinis has elevated her game yet again showing true grit to capture some prestigious titles.

He continued to progress with his first Ontario Amateur crown in 1990, and earned a second provincial victory in 1992.\n\nWeir, The Canadian Tour Rookie of the Year (1993), went on to win the BC Tel Pacific Open and the Canadian Masters (1997) as well as the 1998 PGA Tour Q-School.
