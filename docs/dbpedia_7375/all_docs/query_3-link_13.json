        "text": "The 124th U.S. Open Championship takes place this week, and all eyes are focused on Pinehurst Resort.\n\nWith the exception of two world wars, the U.S. Open has been played every year since 1895 and some of the biggest names in the sport have held the sterling silver trophy.\n\nThere are quite a few things to watch for in the 2024 tournament, including Phil Mickelson’s attempt to get over the hump and complete his career grand slam. Defending champion Wyndham Clark would be the first repeat winner since Brooks Koepka in 2018 and Tiger Woods could enter more rarified air with his fourth victory.\n\nAs things heat up this week, let’s take a look at the history of the major. Who has the most all-time wins? How many times has Pinehurst hosted the tournament? We’ll attempt to answer those questions and more below.\n\nGRAYSON MURRAY: How the USGA is paying tribute to Grayson Murray at US Open in Pinehurst\n\nEAT UP: Meet the longtime NC-based concession stands at the 2024 US Open at Pinehurst No. 2\n\nHow many U.S. Opens has Pinehurst hosted?\n\nThis will be the fourth U.S. Open played at Pinehurst No. 2.

He knocked out Rocco Mediate in a playoff to secure his 14th career major. He also won in 2002 (Bethpage Black) and 2000 (Pebble Beach).\n\nWho has the most all-time U.S. Open victories?\n\nSix players have won the U.S. Open at least three times in their careers. With a win at Pinehurst this week, Brooks Koepka would join that list.\n\nHere are the players with the most all-time wins in the U.S. Open.\n\nJack Nicklaus 4 (1962, 1967, 1972, 1980)\n\nBen Hogan 4 (1948, 1950, 1951, 1953)\n\nBobby Jones 4 (1923, 1926, 1929, 1930)\n\nWillie Anderson 4 (1901, 1903-05)\n\nTiger Woods 3 (2000, 2002, 2008)\n\nHale Irwin 3 (1974, 1979, 1990)\n\nPast U.S. Open champions\n\nHere’s a list of the winners of the previous 123 U.S. Open Championships.\n\n1895: Horace Rawlins\n\n1896: James Foulis\n\n1897: Joe Lloyd\n\n1898: Fred Herd\n\n1899: Willie Smith\n\n1900: Harry Vardon\n\n1901: Willie Anderson\n\n1902: Laurence Auchterlonie\n\n1903: Willie Anderson\n\n1904: Willie Anderson\n\n1905: Willie Anderson\n\n1906: Alex Smith\n\n1907: Alex Ross\n\n1908: Fred McLeod\n\n1909: George Sargent\n\n1910: Alex Smith\n\n1911: John J.
