        "text": "Field of 264 will compete in the prestigious tournament; all ten provinces represented and one territory; Inter-Provincial Team Championship to be contested over first 36 holes\n\nSaskatoon, Sask. – The 119th playing of the Canadian Men’s Amateur Championship, presented by BDO is set to be contested August 5-8 with a field of 264 amateur golfers competing over four rounds at both the Riverside Country Club and Saskatoon Golf and Country Club in Saskatoon, Sask.\n\nThis year’s field features a number of top amateur golfers from around the world including, Max Kennedy of Dublin, Ireland, currently ranked no. 28 on the World Amateur Golf Ranking (WAGR). Joining Kennedy are Wang Ngai Shen of Hong Kong, China (no. 155 WAGR), Mateo Fuenmayor of Colombia (no. 264 WAGR) as well as defending champion, Ashton McCulloch of Kingston, Ont. McCulloch (no. 135 WAGR) has enjoyed a successful season at Michigan State and competed at the 2024 RBC Canadian Open and qualified for the 2024 U.S. Open.\n\nThe following 2024 Provincial Men’s Amateur Champions will also be competing in the field: Brett Jones (Alberta), Team Canada NextGen member Cooper Humphreys (British Columbia), Braxton Kuntz (Manitoba), Team Canada NextGen member Matthew Javier (Ontario), Ryan Lamswood (Newfoundland and Labrador), Alexander Mercier (Quebec) and from the host province, Kye Fisher (Saskatchewan).\n\nAlong with Humphreys, Javier and McCulloch there will be an additional nine Team Canada members competing in Saskatoon including, Laurent Desmarchais (Bromont, Que.), Isaiah Ibit (Orleans, Ont.), Alex Long (Toronto, Ont.), Ben MacLean (Niagara Falls, Ont.), Jean-Philippe Parr (St-Célestin, Que.), Luke Smith (Toronto, Ont.), Hunter Thomson (Calgary, Alta.), Ethan Wilson (St. Albert, Alta.) and Eric Zhao (North York, Ont.).\n\n“We are excited to get the 119th playing of the Canadian Men’s Amateur Championship underway next week at two beautiful golf courses here in Saskatoon,” said Golf Canada Tournament Director Adam Cinel. “The staff and volunteers at both Riverside Country Club and Saskatoon Golf and Country Club been working tirelessly to ensure those competing will enjoy the test both courses present. We look forward to hosting a full field of 264 players as they compete for our prestigious national championship.”\n\nGolfers from all 10 provinces and one territory are represented in the field along with 11 additional countries: Australia, Chinese Taipei, Colombia, England, France, Hong Kong, China, Mexico, Ireland, South Africa, United States and Wales.\n\nThe first two rounds of this year’s tournament will be contested on both courses with the field playing each course once. Following the opening 36-holes of the championship, the field will be reduced to the top 70 players plus ties. Wednesday and Thursday’s rounds will both played at Riverside Country Club with an awards ceremony following Thursday’s final round.\n\n“We are thrilled and honoured to co-host this prestigious national golf championship along with Riverside Country Club. It has been a great partnership as we work together with Golf Canada to make this a memorable experience for the players, spectators and volunteers,” said Warren Proctor, Host Club Committee Chair, Saskatoon Golf and Country Club. “We have had an unbelievable positive response from our membership in support of hosting this championship. I must also recognize our Club management, including course superintendent Terry McNeilly who, along with his staff have been working tirelessly to get our golf course in wonderful condition to be challenging and a fair test for the players.”\n\nPrior to the start of the tournament, there will be a final qualifier on Friday at Riverside Country Club where a field of 46 players will be competing for the final nine spots in the tournament.\n\n“Riverside Country Club has a long history of hosting prestigious golf events, and we look forward to welcoming some of the top tier national and international players for the 119th Canadian Men’s Amateur Championship,” said Robert Klombies, Executive Director, Riverside Country Club. “It is heartening to see the level of excitement and engagement that our members and golf community exhibit to ensure players enjoy an incredible experience both at Riverside and within the City of Saskatoon.”\n\nEstablished in 1895, the Canadian Men’s Amateur Championship is the third oldest amateur championship in the world. The tournament was first contested as one of the newly formed Royal Canadian Golf Association’s (RCGA), now known as Golf Canada, first orders of business in 1895 at the Ottawa Golf Club.\n\nThe national championship originally began as a match play competition but changed to stroke play for the 1969 championship. It remained that way through 1994 when it reverted to match play in honour of the RCGA’s and the championship’s centennial in 1995. The championship once again reverted to stroke play in 2008 and in 2010, the tournament changed to a double field format for the first time ever.\n\nCanadian Golf Hall of Famer George S. Lyon won the Amateur eight times between 1898 and 1914 and was runner-up two more times. Fellow Canadian Golf Hall of Famer Sandy Somerville made it to the match play final ten times between 1924 and 1938, capturing six championships. Other past champions include Canadian Golf Hall of Famers and four-time winners, Nick Weslock (1957, 1963, 1964, 1966) and Doug Roxburgh (1972, 1974, 1982, 1988). Most recently, two-time PGA TOUR winner and two-time Canadian Men’s Amateur Champion, Mackenzie Hughes (2011, 2012) and 2023 RBC Canadian Open and four-time PGA TOUR winner Nick Taylor (2007). The last time the Canadian Men’s Amateur was held in the city of Saskatoon was in 2007 at Riverside Country Club, when Taylor won.\n\nNick Taylor is the only Canadian male golfer to have won the Canadian Junior Boys (2006), Canadian Men’s Amateur (2007) and RBC Canadian Open (2023) titles. Brooke Henderson is the only Canadian female golfer to win the national championship trifecta, having won the Canadian Junior Girls (2012), Canadian Women’s Amateur (2013) and the CPKC Women’s Open (2018).\n\nThe national championship will also feature an Inter-Provincial Team Championship that will take place over the first 36-holes of the tournament. Team Ontario will be defending their title as 10 provinces and one territory will be vying to etch their names into the Willingdon Cup.\n\nThe 2024 Canadian Men’s Amateur Champion receives an exemption into the 2025 RBC Canadian Open at TPC Toronto at Osprey Valley (North Course) in Caledon, Ont. and the 2024 U.S. Amateur Championship taking place at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minn. from August 12-18. The winner will also receive an exemption from local qualifying for the 2025 U.S. Open and U.S. Amateur Championship. In addition, the winner will receive $1,200 CAD."
