        "text": "Ken Venturi, who won the 1964 United States Open while nearing collapse from heat exhaustion and who was later the longtime chief golf analyst for CBS Sports, died on Friday in Rancho Mirage, Calif. He was 82.\n\nVenturi’s son, Matt, told The Associated Press that his father had been hospitalized the last two months for a spinal infection, pneumonia and an intestinal infection. Venturi had a five-way heart bypass surgery and valve repair in December 2006.\n\nVenturi, who had recently been elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame, won 14 tournaments between 1957 and 1966 in a career cut short by circulatory problems in his hands.\n\nHe first gained notice in 1956 as an amateur when he led the Masters by four shots entering the final round, only to shoot an 80, losing to Jack Burke Jr. by a stroke. He was the runner-up at the Masters again in 1960, a shot behind Arnold Palmer, who birdied the final two holes.\n\nBut Venturi’s signature moment came at the Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Md., on a Saturday in June 1964. Temperatures were approaching 100 degrees, and the humidity seemed unconquerable as the players struggled to play 36 holes, the last time the Open staged its final two rounds on a single day.\n\nVenturi had not won since the 1960 Milwaukee Open, had considering quitting and had been required to participate in two qualifying events before being allowed into the Open. He almost collapsed from the heat on the 17th green of his morning round but carded a remarkable 66.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
