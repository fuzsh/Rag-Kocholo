        "text": "Since the inception of the US Open, golf’s second oldest Major tournament, there have been 53 holes-in-one. Let’s take a look at each of the aces.\n\nThe US Open has been played 124 times between the inaugural tournament at Newport Golf Club in 1895, and the most recent championship at Pinehurst in 2024. You might think, ‘But there’s 129 years between those dates, and the US Open is an annual event?’. The tournament was cancelled in 1917 and 1918 due to World War I, and again in 1942, 1943, 1944 and 1945 due to World War II.\n\nMore than 53 golf courses have hosted the US Open over the years, with each course providing a stage for plenty of memorable golf moments, along with an impressive catalog of holes-in-one.\n\nEvery hole-in-one at the US Open golf tournament\n\n1907 – Jack Hobens, 10th hole, Philadelphia Cricket Club (St. Martin’s Course), Pennsylvania\n\nThe first hole-in-one in US Open history came from Jack Hobens, a Scottish-American professional golfer. The ace came in his second round, and he went on to lead the field after round three, but finished with a 12-over-par 85 on the final day.\n\n1922 – Eddie Towns, 10th hole, Skokie Country Club., Glencoe, Illinois\n\nTowns was a familiar face in the US Open up until 1924, with his ace coming in the 1922 tournament. He went on to finish second in the Maryland Open in 1927 behind Fred McLeod, and regularly played tournament golf in the USA.\n\n1931 – Leo Diegel, 146-yard 13th hole, Inverness Club, Toledo, Ohio\n\nDiegel’s ace at the 13th during the second round was the first in nine years. He went on to miss a play-off by two shots on the final day, and finished in third place, taking home just $650, a far cry from the record-breaking purses of 2024.\n\n1936 – Zell Eaton, Baltusrol Golf Club, Springfield, New Jersey\n\nEaton was a country club assistant before he turned professional in 1934. He had one career victory at the 1957 Utah open, and his only career hole-in-one came just two years later at Baltusrol in 1936.\n\n1954 – Dick Chapman, Baltusrol Golf Club, Springfield, New Jersey\n\nChapman was the US amateur champion in 1940, and the British amateur champion in 1950. He came 11th at the 1954 Masters tournament, and placed T21 in the US Open that year, where he carded an ace at the New Jersey course.\n\n1954 – Johnny Weitzel, Baltusrol Golf Club, Springfield, New Jersey\n\nIn 1954, Weitzel finished third in both the Phoenix Open and the Mexican Open, and played in the 1955 Masters tournament.\n\n1956 – Billy Kuntz, 142-yard 11th hole, Oak Hill Country Club, Rochester, New York\n\nKuntz was an amateur when he recorded his hole-in-one at Oak Hill in 1956.

After his ace on the second hole on Course Three at Medinah, he ended the tournament tied for ninth place at six-over-par.\n\n1978 – Bobby Wadkins, 208-yard 15th hole, Cherry Hills, Englewood, Colorado\n\nThe most significant hazard on this hole is the water feature that runs in front and to the left of the green, demanding accuracy and distance control.\n\n1978 – Tom Weiskopf, Cherry Hills Country Club, Englewood, Colorado\n\nThis was Weiskopf’s first of two aces in the US Open, with the second following in 1982.\n\n1979 – Gary Player, 185-yard 3rd hole, Inverness Club, Toledo, Ohio\n\nWidely considered to be one of the greatest golfers of all time, Gary Player aced the 3rd hole at Inverness Club in the 1979 US Open. The hole is renowned for its challenging layout, featuring a slightly elevated tee, and a green that’s well-protected by bunkers, making accurate tee shots crucial.\n\n1980 – Tom Watson, 194-yard 4th hole, Baltusrol Golf Club, Springfield, New Jersey\n\nWatson’s first hole-in-one in a Major came at the US Open in 1980, his second and final ace was at The 34th Open Championship at Royal St. George’s.\n\n1982 – Johnny Miller, 205-yard 12th hole, Pebble Beach, California\n\nMiller has a few records to his name, including being the first golfer to shoot 63 in a major championship, which saw him lift the US Open trophy in 1973.\n\n1982 – Bill Brodell, 180-yard 5th hole, Pebble Beach, California\n\nBrodell always said that his ace at Pebble Beach, the second of three from the 1982 Championship, was his biggest achievement as a player.. “It was a big thrill,” he the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2010.\n\n1982 – Tom Weiskopf, 120-yard 7th hole, Pebble Beach, California\n\nThis was Weiskopf’s second hole in one in a US Open, his first was at Cherry Hills in 1978.\n\n1983 – Scott Simpson, 228-yard 16th hole, Oakmont, Pennsylvania\n\nSimpson later went on to win the 1987 US Open at The Olympic Club in San Fransisco.\n\n1984 – Mark McCumber, 190-yard 10th hole, Winged Foot Golf Club, New York\n\nThe only ace of this 1984 tournament came halfway through the first round for McCumber, when he hit a 5-iron into the 10th hole and walked off having chopped two shots off his score.\n\n1985 – Ben Crenshaw, 217-yard, 9th hole, Oakland Hills Country Club, Birmingham, Michigan\n\nCrenshaw went on to lose to Tze-Chung Chen in a play-off for the US Open title this year.\n\n1989 – Doug Weaver, Mark Wiebe, Jerry Pate, Nick Price, 167-yard 6th hole, Oak Hill Country Club, Rochester, New York\n\nAn incredible four aces (no, not the LIV Golf team) were recorded at the sixth hole in 1989, all within two hours of each other. Not only were they all on the same day, the same club was used on all four shots, a 7-iron. Weaver was out in the first group that morning, his shot securing the first hole-in-one of the day. A few groups later, Wiebe hits his tee shot to eight feet and it finishes at the bottom of the cup. Pate takes to the tee shortly after, sending his ball over the pin and letting it spin back into the hole. Price, who was in the group directly behind Pate, also cards an ace to make history at Oak Hill.\n\n1990 – Jay Don Blake, 190-yard 8th hole, Medinah, Illinois\n\nBlake had just one win on the PGA Tour, the Charles Schwab Cup in 2011.\n\n1991 – John Inman, 194-yard 4th hole, Hazeltine National, Chaska, Minnesota\n\nInman has had two stints on the professional golf circuit in his lifetime.

He took a thirteen year break to return to the University of North Carolina, where he went to college, to oversee the men’s golf program.\n\n1991 – Fuzzy Zoeller, 194-yard 4th hole, Hazeltine National, Chaska, Minnesota\n\nFuzzy’s hole-in-one came during the second round at Hazeltine, on the same hole that Inman carded his ace. The 4th green is surrounded by bunkers, and can. betricky to hold due to the shelf towards the back that slopes severely to the front.\n\n1993 – Mike Hulbert, 198-yard 12th hole, Baltusrol Golf Club, Springfield, New Jersey\n\nHulbert’s ace on the 12th hole was one of eight eagles in the first round in 1993’s US Open Championship.\n\n1993 – Sandy Lyle, 206-yard 12th hole, Baltusrol Golf Club, Springfield, New Jersey\n\nThe 12th hole welcomed a second hole-in-one in 1993, when Scot Sandy Lyle carded an ace during the final round of the Championship.\n\n1995 – Gary Hallberg, 182-yard 7th hole, Shinnecock Hills, Southampton, New York\n\nHallberg’s ace came at the 7th hole at Shinnecock Hills, whic is playing host to the US Open in 2026.\n\n1998 – Chris Perry, 196-yard 13th hole, The Olympic Club, San Francisco, California\n\nPerry’s ace came in the third round of the 1998 Championship, and he ended the weekend in 25th position.\n\n2000 – Todd Fischer, 108-yard 7th hole, Pebble Beach, California\n\nTo date, Fischer’s ace is the shortest in US Open history. That doesn’t make it any less impressive.\n\n2001 – Phil Mickelson, 174-yard 6th hole, Southern Hills, Tulsa, Oklahoma\n\nMickelson’s sole US Open ace was back in 2001 at Southern Hills.

He was right.”\n\n2004 – Spencer Levin, 179-yard 17th hole, Shinnecock Hills, Southampton, New York\n\nLevin’s hole-in-one was an anomaly, that’s for sure. A spot of bad weather had forced the players back to the clubhouse, allowing the amateur golfer to take a break from the run of bogey’s he had been having. His ace came on the 17th hole, his first hole back after the weather delay, and he moved into the top 15 on the leaderboard.\n\n2005 – Peter Jacobsen, 175-yard 9th hole, Pinehurst Resort (No. 2), Pinehurst, North Carolina\n\nIn the third round of the US Open, Jacobsen took a 7-iron off the 9th tee and ended up carding the only ace of the championship.

The reigning champion achieved his first professional hole-in-one on the 115-yard par-3 15th at Los Angeles Country Club. The view of the green is obscured from the tee box here, and it’s difficult for spectators to get close to the green, which lead to a delayed reaction from Matt.\n\n2024 – Sepp Straka, 9th hole, Pinehurst Resort (No. 2), Pinehurst, North Carolina\n\nStraka was the first player to achieve a hole in one at the 2024 tournament, carding his ace on the 9th hole of the second round.
