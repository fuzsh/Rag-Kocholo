        "text": "Looking back at Azalea Open champions, Arnold Palmer obviously tops the list.\n\nJust having Palmer in the field, at any point in his career, boosted a tournament’s credibility. Seeing his name on the trophy there, forever, is a special reminder of what the King meant to us all and always will. Surely, someone here in town has a memory or two of Palmer’s days walking the fairways at Cape Fear Country Club in the '50s and '60s.\n\nI’d love to hear it.\n\nBack in the spring we solicited Azalea Open stories, photos, memorabilia or even the slightest recollection. I communicated with a handful of readers. Trust me, I will be in touch again soon.\n\nWith the Wells Fargo Championship at Eagle Point Golf Club now six months away, the StarNews’ coverage is accelerating, and a significant portion of that coverage involves magnifying the PGA Tour’s rich history in Wilmington.\n\nAs a refresher, the Azalea Open was held 24 times at Cape Fear Country Club, in the heart of town off Oleander Drive.\n\nBesides Mr. Palmer (1957), other notable champions included Lloyd Mangrum (1951), Bob Toski (1954), Mike Souchak (1956), Art Wall Jr. (1959) and Jerry Barber (1961, '63).\n\nMangrum won 36 PGA Tour events, including the 1946 U.S. Open, and played on four Ryder Cup teams.\n\nWall Jr. graduated from Duke, won the Masters and made 45 aces. That will do.\n\nGary Player, Billy Casper and Gene Littler competed in the Azalea Open -- just in 1957.\n\nPalmer almost defended his title, but Howie Johnson nipped him in a playoff.\n\nTom Watson came early in his career in the Azalea’s final days. Jack Nicklaus came and left before he started. He regretted it later.\n\nHometown product R.C. Powell (Raleigh) shot 219 for the first three rounds in 1957, which put him in the sixth-to-last group on Sunday. Wrote a pretty good golf column, too.\n\nAnother local Wilmington amateur, Bobby Harrell, made the cut that year. He played with a Greensboro amateur named Bill Harvey on Sunday. Harvey’s son, Scott, is about to clinch his sixth consecutive Carolinas Amateur of the Year award and will likely compete in the Carolinas Amateur at Cape Fear CC next July. If so, he’ll be a favorite.\n\nGolf comes full circle that way.\n\nThe year Toski won the Azalea, it was one of four victories. He also won the money list. Just 135 pounds, he was one of the longest drivers on Tour.\n\nI had the pleasure to play with Toski in South Florida in the late 1990s, when he was in his 70s. The other two golfers were card-carrying Tour members: Mark Brooks, fresh off a PGA Championship, and Larry Rinker, who made more than 250 cuts on the PGA Tour.\n\nToski outdrove us all, consistently, cackling as he watched his tee shots soar.\n\nToski quit the Tour at age 30 and became one of the game’s best instructors. He helped Rinker and Mike Sposa and dozens of others. Ken Duke has earned more than $10 million in a late-blossoming Tour career, and he’d be the first to tell you it would be a heckuva lot less if he hadn’t hooked up with Toski, who turned 90 last month.\n\nBut I’m just skimming the surface.\n\nThere’s plenty more to tell, I’m certain. Stories from the caddie yard or front row. Some hand-me-downs that are worth re-visiting. The Tour was a more intimate experience in those days. The purse for the ‘57 Azalea was $12,500. Total.\n\nWilmington was much smaller. The golf community was close-knit.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you.\n\nCorrespondent Brian Mull can be reached at bgmull@gmail.com."
