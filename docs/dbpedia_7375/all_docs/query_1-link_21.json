        "text": "Grand Blanc, MI\n\nWarwick Hills Golf & Country Club was established in 1957 and completely rebuilt by renowned architect Joe Lee in 1968. Warwick Hills has enjoyed a strong history of hosting professional golf since its inception. The Club hosted Michigan’s only PGA TOUR Event, the Buick Open, from 1958 to 1969 and again from 1977 to 2009. The greens at Warwick Hills were consistently ranked among the best on the PGA TOUR by the players. Hole #17, the signature Par 3, also ranked among the rowdiest holes on the TOUR schedule year after year. The list of tournament winners for the Buick Open includes: Tiger Woods, Jim Furyk, Ben Crenshaw, Fred Couples, Vijay Singh and Billy Casper.\n\nIn 2018, professional golf returned to Warwick Hills with the inaugural playing of The Ally Challenge presented by McLaren, an official PGA TOUR Champions event. Paul Broadhurst emerged from one of the best fields of the year to capture the tournament’s first trophy. The Ally Challenge presented by McLaren was a tremendous success by all accounts, including its impact on the community, raising more than $801,000 for charitable organizations in southeastern Michigan\n\nCourse Information"
