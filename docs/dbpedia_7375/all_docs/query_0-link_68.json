        "text": "TOLEDO — The United States Golf Association (USGA) announced Thursday that Inverness Club will host the 129th U.S. Amateur Championship, scheduled for Aug. 13-19, 2029.\n\nInverness Club will be hosting its ninth USGA championship and second U.S. Amateur. Eventual major champion Craig Stadler won the 1973 U.S. Amateur at Inverness.\n\nThe club has also hosted four U.S. Opens. Ted Ray won the 1920 Open by one stroke over four players, including Harry Vardon. It was four-time champion Bob Jones’ first U.S. Open, and he finished in a tie for eighth place. Billy Burke (1931) and Dick Mayer (1957) won U.S. Opens at Inverness in playoffs, with Burke prevailing over George Von Elm in 72 playoff holes, the most in U.S. Open and major championship history. Hale Irwin earned the second of his three U.S. Open victories at Inverness in 1979, prevailing by two strokes over past champions Gary Player and Jerry Pate.\n\nThe Toledo facility opened in 1903 and Donald Ross was hired in 1916 to design an 18-hole layout of outstanding championship caliber. The course went through several modifications over its history, with the most recent being Andrew Green’s acclaimed efforts to restore the layout to its early 20th century feel. The par-71 course can play at more than 7,700 yards, with 90 bunkers and small, undulating bentgrass green"
