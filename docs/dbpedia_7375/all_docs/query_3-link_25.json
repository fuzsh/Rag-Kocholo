        "text": "Cynthia the Sea Lion\n\nThe logo for The Hay was inspired by the story of Peter Hay serving as Chief Marshal for Bobby Jones during the 1929 U.S. Amateur at Pebble Beach, the first national golf championship contested west of the Mississippi River.\n\nDuring the opening round, the crowd following Jones began running between shots to catch a glimpse of the superstar. Hay restored order to the gallery with his unmistakable presence and assertive commands that were said to have “shaken the sea lions.” His efforts were appreciated by Jones, who later referred to Hay as the world’s greatest golf marshal."
