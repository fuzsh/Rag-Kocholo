        "text": "NOTE: You can read this article below or listen to it at this link:\n\nLISTEN to the article HERE\n\nTUCSON, AZ - February 2, 1952\n\nThe Sports Time Traveler™ has gone back in time exactly 72 years, to watch the 72 holes at the 1952 Tucson Open, a PGA event here at the El Rio Golf & Country Club.\n\nThe purse is $10,000 with $2,000 going to the winner. That’s the standard money for PGA events here in 1952.\n\nAll the greatest players on tour are here with the exception of two - Sam Snead and Ben Hogan.\n\nBen Hogan of course is chronically limited in his ability to play due to the near fatal auto accident he sustained in 1949. Hogan only competes in about 6 tournaments a year now. See my article about Hogan from last summer:\n\nBen Hogan Battles the British and His Own Body at the British Open.\n\nSam Snead is not here this week because of a commitment in Florida. Snead is headlining the Great Miami Sports and Vacation Show alongside baseball legend Bob Feller.\n\nDespite missing two of the premier players in golf, attendance at the Tucson Open is on pace to break the all-time record for the event.\n\nJoe Louis is in the Tournament\n\nThe large galleries in Tucson this week are mostly due to an unexpected entrant - former world heavyweight boxing champion, Joe Louis.\n\nLouis was the champion of the world from 1937 to 1949. He successfully defended his title a record 25 times. In 2024, that remains the record for all weight classes.\n\nAnd for those of you in 2024 who don’t know too much about Joe Louis, note that ESPN ranked Joe Louis as the #11 greatest athlete of the entire 20th century.\n\nESPN's Greatest Athletes of the 20th Century\n\nLouis is playing here in Tucson as an amateur on a sponsor’s exemption.\n\nIt’s his 2nd PGA tournament.\n\nThe 1st one was monumental.\n\nBut this one has turned out to be even bigger to this sports fan.\n\nBACKGROUND and BREAKING THE COLOR BARRIER\n\n2 weeks ago, on January 17th at the San Diego Open, Joe Louis became the first African-American player in history to play in a PGA event.\n\nBut it didn’t happen without significant controversy.\n\nLouis, an outstanding golfer, had been invited to play, on a sponsors exemption, in the San Diego Open as an amateur. In addition, 2 African-American professional players had also received sponsor exemptions.\n\nAn AP article that appeared in the Los Angeles Mirror that week noted that “Louis’ followers hailed his entry as ‘the first step’ in a long fight by Negroes to compete in PGA tournaments. They likened it to the case of Jackie Robinson as the first Negro to crash into organized baseball.”\n\nBut a few days before the tournament the PGA informed the operators of the San Diego Open that PGA rules forbid non-white players.\n\nAn article in the January 13th Los Angeles Times had a headline, “Joe Louis Will Fight PGA Tournament Ban.”\n\nLouis was livid at the ruling and declared it, “the first time he had personally encountered racial discrimination.”\n\nA public brouhaha ensued with PGA President Horton Smith (who was the winner of the very first Masters in 1934) ruling that Louis may play as an amateur, but the African-American professionals could not, as the non-white player rule applied to professionals.\n\nThe decision was explained in a January 16, 1952 article in The Los Angeles Times.\n\nLouis was upset with the ruling but vowed to play and continue to fight racial prejudice in golf.\n\nA day later, Joe Louis, playing as an amateur, became the first African-American player in a PGA tournament at 9:27am when his group went off for the first round of the San Diego Open.\n\nHe was paired with PGA President Horton Smith!\n\nLouis played admirably shooting a 76, the same score as 1952 PGA championship winner Jim Turnesa, and better than many PGA professionals including Jerry Barber (who later won the 1961 PGA Championship).\n\nOnly one shot ahead of Louis was the legendary Billy Casper.\n\nHorton Smith shot a 73.\n\nAccording to the January 18th Los Angeles Times, Smith told Louis, “You hit like a pro, Joe,” when he watched Louis hit a 250 yard drive on the opening tee shot.\n\nLater when Louis hooked his tee shot into the left rough on the 3rd hole, Smith said to him, “The only place a left hook is good is in the ring.”\n\nLouis didn’t fare as well the next day and shot 82 to miss the cut.\n\nBut Louis was successful in his efforts to challenge the PGA color barrier.\n\nOn January 19, 1952, Horton Smith announced the PGA would lift its ban on African-American professional players in cases where they are invited to play by the host organization. This was reported in the January 20, 1952 Los Angeles Times.\n\nNOTE from The Sports Time Traveler™\n\nI’m cutting in from 2024 with an insight.\n\nThe lifting of the PGA ban on non-white professionals leads me to believe that the Joe Louis – Horton Smith match in the first round of the 1952 San Diego Open was the most important match of Joe Louis’ sports career.\n\nLouis apparently was able to deliver the knockout blow to the color barrier via his conversation with PGA President, Horton Smith, during that historic round of golf at the San Diego Open on January 17, 1952.\n\nNow back to 1952.\n\nThe Phoenix Open\n\nThe next week at the Phoenix Open, Louis told a UPI reporter his feelings about the new PGA rule. He said that he was, “well satisfied, however, I would like to have one change in the rules, the one that requires Negroes be specially invited before they can compete in qualifying rounds.”\n\nLouis did not play in the Phoenix Open, but he was there to see his friend Ted Rhodes become one of two professional African-American golfers to play in a PGA event for the first time. The other was Bill Spiller.\n\nOnly Rhodes made the cut at the Phoenix Open, thus becoming the first African-American player to ever make a cut in a PGA event.\n\nRhodes finished 28 shots behind the winner, Lloyd Mangrum, but he made it into the top 60, earning an automatic qualifying spot in the Tucson Open for which he had an invitation to play.\n\nJoe Louis also had an invitation to play in Tucson, and as an amateur invitee, Louis also did not have to play in the qualifying rounds.\n\nThe Tucson Open - ROUND 1\n\n2 days ago, on the first day of the tournament, Louis teed off at 9:05am.\n\nOn the opening 9 holes he shot a 1 over par 36.\n\nBut on the back 9 he fired a 2 under par 33 to finish the day with a 1 under par 69.\n\nOnly 5 of the 150 golfers in the field shot better on the back 9 than Joe Louis.\n\n4 of them were just 1 shot better than Louis with 32s. While Dr. Cary Middlecoff had the best back 9 of the day with a 30.\n\nThe 69 put Louis in 17th place in the field of 150.\n\nThe Arizona Daily Star reported that Louis was, “tickled to death” with his round of 69.\n\nLouis was only 4 shots off the lead held by Dr. Cary Middlecoff and Jimmy Clark at 65.\n\nHe was also 1 shot ahead of Ted Rhodes.\n\nAnd Louis had the best score of the day among the amateurs in the field which included Frank Stranahan, perhaps the best amateur player in the world. Stranahan had posted a 71.\n\nJoe Louis poses at the 1952 Tucson Open Pro-Am on January 30th:\n\nThe biggest shocker of round 1 came from one of the biggest names in the field, Jimmy Demerat.\n\nThe 2-time winner of this tournament came to the dog leg par 5 18th hole 1 under par on his opening round.\n\nDemaret, as he always does at the El Rio course, tried to cut the corner of the dog leg on his drive.\n\nBut his drive went out of bounds.\n\nThen in an unimaginable sequence he proceeded to hit 4 more drives out of bounds.\n\nJimmy Demaret finished the 18th hole with a 14! That gave him a score of 78, leaving him virtually certain to miss the cut.\n\nDemaret took it very well and was laughing when told a reporter from the Arizona Daily Star, “That’s the highest score I’ve taken on one hole in my life.”\n\nNOTE: I found it interesting that a 2021 Golf Week article on the highest scores ever on a single hole in a PGA sanctioned event, failed to include Demaret’s 14. Demaret’s score would have ranked as tied for the 7th worst score on a single hole. You can view that article here: Highest Single Hole Scores in a PGA Event\n\nROUND 2\n\nFrank Stranahan demonstrated why he might be the best amateur in the world, and one of the best golfers anywhere, in yesterday’s 2nd round.\n\nStranahan stood over a 20 foot putt on the 18th hole.\n\nUp to that moment he had taken only 58 shots.\n\nMake the putt and Stranahan would become the first player ever to break 60 in a PGA event.\n\nIn this morning’s Arizona Daily Star, sports editor, Abe Chanin, described the action as Stranahan stroked the putt for history, “Instead of playing it safely with an approach putt, Stranahan went for the cup and the record. The ball rolled past the hole, a few inches off line.”\n\nStranahan had barely missed the 59.\n\nNOTE FROM 2024:\n\nIt will be another 25 years until Al Geiberger becomes the first player in a PGA event to shoot a 59 in 1977.\n\nNow back to 1952.\n\nAnd then Stranahan missed the 3 footer coming back.\n\nDespite three-putting the final hole, Frank Stranahan had himself a 9 under par 61.\n\nThat was good enough to wrest the amateur lead from Joe Louis, and also to move into a tie for 1st place in the Tucson Open at the halfway mark.\n\nStranahan and Skee Riegel both stood at 8 under par 132.\n\nIf Stranahan had broken the 60 barrier, few fans would have seen it. That’s because the largest crowd of the day was following the former boxing champ, Joe Louis.\n\nJoe Louis played well again in the 2nd round. He came to the 18th hole poised to remain under par for 36 holes. But he required 2 shots get out of the sand trap on the 18th and finished the day with a 2 over par 72.\n\nJoe Louis’ 36 hole score was a 1 over par 141, tied for 39th.\n\nAnd that was good enough to make the cut which was at 144.\n\nAn All-Time Great Athletic Achievement\n\nI’m interrupting this article to come back to the present and ponder the magnitude of what Joe Louis did 72 years ago yesterday.\n\nThe fans who followed Joe Louis that day saw something unprecedented, something astonishing.\n\nOn February 1, 1952, Joe Louis became the only champion athlete from another sport to make the cut in a PGA event.\n\nThink about that.\n\nJoe Louis made the cut at the Tucson Open!\n\nHow great an accomplishment was this?\n\nConsider the company Joe Louis was in by making the cut at 141:\n\nHe was tied with multiple major champions Jack Burke, Jr. and Lawson Little.\n\nHe was one stroke AHEAD of PGA greats Tommy Bolt, winner of the 1958 US Open and Vic Ghezzi, winner of the 1941 PGA Championship.\n\nHe was two strokes AHEAD of Dick Mayer, winner of the 1957 US Open.\n\nHe was three shots AHEAD of Bob Toski, the leading money winner in 1954 (NOTE FROM 2024: Bob Toski might be the only person that played in the 1952 Tucson Open that is still alive at age 97).\n\nHe was only 2 shots off from Julius Boros who won the U.S. Open the next year on his way to 3 majors and 18 PGA wins.\n\nHe was only 3 shots back of Lloyd Mangrum, the leading money winner on the PGA circuit from the prior year.\n\nI’m just totally blown away by this.\n\nAs far as I can tell there is no parallel with any other great athlete of Joe Louis’s stature.\n\nFor example, former Cowboys QB Tony Romo has played in 4 PGA TOUR events and never made the cut.\n\nAnd even if he had made a cut, Romo has not even been to a Super Bowl (except as an announcer).\n\nAnd Romo did not make the list of top 100 football players of all-time as ranked by the NFL Network.\n\nFormer NFL QB, John Brodie, won a Senior PGA TOUR event, but never played on the PGA TOUR. And Brodie also never went to the Super Bowl. And also did not make the list of top 100 football players of all-time as ranked by the NFL Network.\n\nIn comparison, Joe Louis was ranked #1 in his sport for 12 consecutive years.\n\nAnd Louis was ranked as the #11 greatest athlete of the 20th century, across all sports, by ESPN.\n\nJoe Louis made the cut in a PGA event.\n\nIt’s mind boggling.\n\nThere seems to be no other champion athlete ever to do what Joe Louis did in a PGA event.\n\nYet almost no newspapers at the time made note of the fact that Joe Louis had made the cut.\n\nBesides the local Tucson papers, the New York Times simply mentioned, “Louis qualified for tomorrow’s play.”\n\nAnd nothing was ever mentioned again about it.\n\nThe achievement seems to have been lost in history.\n\nI was so excited when I uncovered this as I read the newspaper archives.\n\nAnd now back to 1952.\n\nROUND 3\n\nToday is round 3.\n\nJoe Louis has a packed day.\n\nHe had previously committed to making a community appearance at 8:30am this morning.\n\nPerhaps he simply didn’t fathom he would make the cut and be busy elswhere on this day.\n\nThe Tucson Daily Citizen reported yesterday, “Louis will appear on the stage of the Fox-Tucson theater during the safe-teen club program… during his appearance Louis will present an award to the city’s Junior Citizen of the Week.”\n\nI wondered if Louis was going to make good on the appearance since he had an 11:42am tee time in the 3rd round of the tournament.\n\nIt turns out he did make it to the theater 3 hours prior to his tee time as can be seen in this photo that appeared in the Arizona Daily Star.\n\nOn the golf course, Louis again had the largest gallery of the day.\n\nBut things did not start out so well for Louis in the 3rd round.\n\nThe winds were gusty and on the 1st hole the former boxing champ’s tee shot, “went high and the wind carried it out of bounds,” according to the report from Ray McNally in the afternoon edition of today’s Tucson Citizen.\n\nAt the time of this writing, Louis has finished the front 9 in 39. His playing partner, Jack Burke Jr. was only 1 shot better at 38.\n\nThe Sports Time Traveler™ will continue following the 1952 Tucson Open over the next day and a half and will report to you if there is any more news that is so exciting I just have to share it with you.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nADDENDUM\n\nA reader, Pete Trenham, who is a PGA professional and golf historian, contacted me after I initially posted this article to point out that the first professional golfer to play in a PGA event was actually Robert “Pat” Ball at the 1934 St. Paul Open on July 13, 1934. Ball did not make the cut in that event. And shortly after his appearance, in November, 1934, the PGA established their “white only” rule for PGA events.\n\nLeave a comment"
