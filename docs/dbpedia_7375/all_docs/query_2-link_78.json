        "text": "In golf, it's all about winning majors, and we have seen some prolific champions over the years.\n\nSome players will go through their careers and win one or two majors if they are lucky but these legends of the game turned the biggest tournaments into their bread and butter.\n\nTop ten golf majors winners\n\n10. Tom Watson - Eight Majors\n\nMasters: 1977, 1981, US Open: 1982, The Open: 1975, 1977, 1980, 1982, 1983\n\nDuring the 1970s and 80s, Watson was one of the leading golfers in the world.\n\nThe American was born in Kansas City but The Open proved to be his favoured tournament.\n\nHe is the joint-second most successful player at that particular event, winning it five times and was appreciated for his longevity.\n\nIn 2009, he nearly won The Open again but lost in a four-hole play-off to Stewart Cink.\n\n9. Ben Hogan - Nine Majors\n\nMasters: 1951, 1953, PGA Championship: 1946, 1948, US Open: 1948, 1950, 1951, 1953, The Open: 1953\n\nHogan is among the few players to complete the Career Grand Slam, winning each major at least once.\n\nBut what makes that achievement even better is that he only competed in The Open once.\n\n'The Hawk' was a fearsome competitor born in Texas who served in the US military and suffered a near-fatal car accident, but none of that stopped him.\n\nHis peak moment came in 1953 when he claimed the Triple Crown for winning the US Open, Open and Masters all in 12 months.\n\n7= Babe Zaharias - Ten Majors\n\nWestern Open: 1940, 1944, 1945, 1950, Titleholders Championship: 1947, 1950, 1952, US Women's Open: 1948, 1950, 1954)\n\nZaharias is unique to anyone else on this list because she wasn't just excellent at golf but also at athletics.\n\nThe American initially pursued a career in track and field, leading her to compete in the 1932 Olympics.\n\nShe set four world records and claimed two gold medals and one silver in the 80-metre hurdles, the javelin and the high jump.\n\nThen, incredibly, eight years later, she won the first of ten majors.\n\n7= Annika Sorenstam - Ten Majors\n\nChervon Championship: 2001, 2002, 2005, Women's PGA Championship: 2003, 2004, 2005, US Women's Open: 1995, 1996, 2006, British Women's Open: 2003\n\nUnlike the other players on this list, Sorenstam isn't American but was born in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nHowever, she did move to the USA to study and now lives in Florida, and while she was a player, she was almost unbeatable.\n\nSorenstam is among the few players to hold the Career Grand Slam, winning each of the four active majors at least once.\n\nPlus, she was at the top of her game for some time, winning all her majors within 11 years.\n\n5= Louise Suggs - 11 Majors\n\nWestern Open: 1946, 1947, 1949, 1953, Titleholders Championship: 1946, 1954, 1956, 1959, Women's PGA Championship: 1957, US Women's Open: 1949, 1952\n\nSuggs is another American female star and one of the founding members of the LPGA (Ladies Professional Golf Association).\n\nShe was born in Atlanta, Georgia and dominated at amateur level before turning professional.\n\nSuggs was one of the greatest players of her generation, and once she retired, she was handed loads of awards.\n\nHer majors record is excellent, and she deservedly has a place inside the top ten.\n\n5= Walter Hagen - 11 Majors\n\nPGA Championship: 1921, 1924, 1925, 1926, 1927, US Open: 1914, 1919, The Open: 1922, 1924, 1928, 1929\n\nHagen is considered the 'father of professional golf' and is regarded as one of the best golfers ever.\n\nBorn in New York to a family of German descent, he went on to be a Ryder Cup captain six times.\n\nPlus, unlike some of the others on this list, his 11 majors came across 15 years, showing he remained at the top of his game for a very long time.\n\nHagen also helped spread golf around the world by taking part in exhibition tours to bring the game to people across the globe.\n\n4. Mickey Wright - 13 Majors\n\nWestern Open: 1962, 1963, 1966, Titleholders Championship: 1961, 1962, Women's PGA Championship: 1958, 1960, 1961, 1963, US Women's Open: 1958, 1959, 1961, 1964\n\nWright was born in San Diego and dominated her sport in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nShe is now a member of the Hall of Fame and claimed a Triple Crown in 1961.\n\nHer achievements are even more remarkable because she had to retire at just 34 due to problems with her feet.\n\nSo, who knows just how many majors she could have won if she was playing in the modern age with better physiotherapy and health care.\n\n2= Tiger Woods - 15 Majors\n\nMasters: 1997, 2001, 2002, 2005, 2019, PGA Championship: 1999, 2000, 2006, 2007, US Open: 2000, 2002, 2008, The Open: 2000, 2005, 2006\n\nDespite coming towards the end of his career, Woods is still the biggest name in modern-day golf because of his incredible achievements.\n\nHe has won each major at least three times, including The Masters on five occasions.\n\nThe American is still playing the odd tournament these days, but he dominated golf during the 2000s.\n\nAnd then, after dealing with plenty of stuff away from the course, he defied all the odds to win at Augusta one more time in 2019, 22 years after his first victory there.\n\nWoods is undoubtedly one of America's greatest sportspeople, never mind golf players.\n\n2= Patty Berg - 15 Majors\n\nWestern Open: 1941, 1943, 1948, 1951, 1955, 1957, 1958, Titleholders Championship: 1937, 1938, 1939, 1948, 1953, 1955, 1957, US Women's Open: 1946\n\nBerg is the all-time leading female player in terms of majors, and her success spanned 20 years.\n\nThe American was born in Florida and became the first president of the LPGA.\n\nShe was a trailblazer in the women's game and is one of the most successful people ever to play the sport.\n\nBerg particularly enjoyed the Western Open, winning it seven times.\n\n1. Jack Nicklaus - 18 Majors\n\nMasters: 1963, 1965, 1966, 1972, 1975, 1986, PGA Championship: 1963, 1971, 1973, 1975, 1980, US Open: 1962, 1967, 1972, 1980, The Open: 1966, 1970, 1978\n\nNicklaus, or 'The Golden Bear', is the most successful golfer in history, and it's hard to see how his achievements will ever be matched.\n\nWhat makes him stand out compared to many others is his longevity, as he won majors in the 1960s, 70s and 80s.\n\nHe has won the most Masters and is a Career Grand Slam member.\n\nThe American is still going strong and now spends his time designing other golf courses through his company, Nicklaus Design.\n\nIt's hard to imagine we will ever see a player who can be at the peak of his powers for 30 years ever again."
