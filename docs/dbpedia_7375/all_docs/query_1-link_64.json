        "text": "Paul Harney (July 11, 1929 – August 24, 2011) was an American professional golfer and golf course owner who spent part of his career as a full-time PGA Tour player, but mostly was a club professional, part-time Tour player, and owner-operator of his own course.Harney was born and raised in Worcester, Massachusetts. He attended the College of the Holy Cross, which is located in his hometown; and was captain of the golf team. Harney played full-time on the PGA Tour from 1955 to 1962; and part-time from 1963 to 1973. During that time, he won six PGA Tour events. His first win came at the 1957 Carling Open; he won his second PGA Tour event just two weeks later at the Labatt Open. In 1963 at the prime of his career, he fulfilled a promise made to his wife, and love of his life, Patricia, that when their oldest child started school, he would only play the tour on a part-time basis. He took his first club pro job at Sunset Oaks in northern California, where he stayed a couple years. He then moved his family across the country to Sutton, Massachusetts, where he took the club pro's job at Pleasant Valley Country Club. Harney had a great deal of success in major championships, placing in the top-10 six times. His best finish in a major was 4th at the 1963 U.S. Open; however, he also finished in the top-8 four times at The Masters in the 1960s.Harney has received many honors and awards. In 1957, he received Golf Digest's Most Improved Golfer award. He was inducted into the Holy Cross Varsity Club Hall of Fame in June 1963. In 1974, he earned \"PGA Golf Professional of the Year\" honors. In 1995, he became the first inductee into the New England Golf Hall of Fame. On September 8, 2005, Harney was enshrined into the PGA Golf Professional Hall of Fame. As his competitive playing days were winding down, Harney used his prize money to open his own course in East Falmouth, Massachusetts, which he owned until his death. His daughter Erin Harney Abbott is carrying on the legacy of Paul Harney Golf Course. Harney had six children with his wife Patricia.\n\nPGA TOUR VICTORIES\n\nJun 23, 1957 Carling Open Invitational−9 (70-69-68-68=275)\n\nJul 7, 1957 Labatt Open−10 (69-69-70-70=278)\n\nMar 15, 1959 Pensacola Open−19 (69-65-65-70=269)\n\nJan 6, 1964 Los Angeles Open−4 (71-72-66-71=280)\n\nJan 11, 1965Los Angeles Open−8 (68-71-68-69=276)\n\nJan 30, 1972 Andy Williams-San Diego Open Invitational−13 (68-71-66-70=275)\n\nMASSACHUSETT OPEN CHAMPION (5)\n\n1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1977\n\nRESULTS IN MAJOR CHAMPIONSHIPS\n\nMasters Tournament 4 top 10 finishes\n\nUS Open competed 13 times finish 4th in 1963\n\nPGA Championship competed 9 times finished T-7 in 1962\n\nNever competed in the British Open\n\nPlayed in 34 Major Championships making the cut 31 times\n\nCHAMPIONS TOUR"
