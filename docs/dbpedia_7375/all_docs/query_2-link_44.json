        "text": "Jimmy Demaret is inducted into the Texas Golf\n\nHall of Fame.\n\nFlashy dressing Jimmy Demaret played in 13 events in 1940 and won six of them, including his first of three Masters titles. But his banner year was 1947 when he was both the Vardon trophy winner (69.90) and leading money winner ($27,936). He was named to four Ryder Cup teams, including the 1941 team that did not compete against the British because of the war. Jimmy was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1983. He is generally acknowledged as the Father of the Senior Tour and he and Fred Raphael conceived Legends of Golf in 1978 at Onion Creek a course designed and co-owned by Demaret himself.\n\nDemaret, a companion of movie stars, royalty, heads of state and astronauts, was a pioneer in\n\nTV golf and co-hosted, with Gene Sarazen, the Shell’s Wonderful World of Golf series. He co-founded the world-famous Champions Golf Club with life-long friend Jack Burke and lured the U.S. Open there in 1969.\n\nA product of the Hermann Park caddie pen, Demaret played only in one tournament as an amateur, that being a match for Northside High School. He received pay for his services as an assistant pro at the early age of 14 and would go on to hold several club jobs before concentration on the life of a touring pro.\n\nBurke is inducted into the Texas Golf Hall of Fame.\n\nJackie Burke will always be remembered for his string of four consecutive victories ( Texas Open, Houston Open, Baton Rouge Open, and St. Petersburg Open) in 1952. In PGA Tour annals, this feat is second only to Byron Nelson’s 11-victory streak in 1945. In 1952 he won the Vardon Trophy with a stroke average of 70.54. Burke’s earnings for his four wins only amounted to $8,000. At the end of the season he had pocketed $21,000 and was third on the money list. But his best year was yet to come. In 1956, he won both the Masters and the PGA Championship and was named Player of the Year.\n\nThe eldest son of Texas trailblazing club pro Jack Burke, Sr. played on five Ryder Cup teams and was twice a captain, non-playing captain in 1973. He was inducted into the PGA Hall of Fame in 1976, the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 1978 and the Texas Golf Hall of Fame in 1979.\n\nBurke was a judo instructor in the Marines in WWII. The late Jimmy Demaret was Burke’s life-long friend, confidant and business partner. In 1957, they built the famed Champions Golf Club, site of the 1967 Ryder Cup matches and the 1969 U.S. Open. When Demaret died in 1983, Burke became the sole owner. He turned professional before his 20th birthday and headed the operation at Galveston Country Club.\n\nJackie Burke received the Bob Jones Award.\n\nThis award is the highest honor given by the USGA in recognition of sportsmanship in golf, in honor of Bobby Jones.\n\nJackie Burke is presented the PGA Distinguished Service Award. Started in 1988, the PGA Distinguished Service Award honors outstanding individuals who dis play leadership and humanitarian qualities including integrity, sportsmanship and a passion for the game of golf. By their endeavors, they have given back to others and helped grow the game of a lifetime.\n\nJackie Burke Inductee for the Houston Sports Hall of Fame. To see a short article please click here."
