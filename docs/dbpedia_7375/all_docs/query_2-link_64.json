The 79th U.S. Women’s Open was staged at Lancaster Country Club, a 1919 William Flynn design and eight past champions were in the field.\n\nThe winner, Yuka Saso, received the Mickey Wright medal, custody of the Harton S. Semple Trophy for one year, an exemption into the next 10 U.S. Women’s Opens as well as exemptions into the next five playings of the other four majors.\n\nAnd, of course, a mighty big check. Saso received a $2.4 million first-place prize, the second-largest check in women’s golf. The 2024 CME Group Tour Championship winner will receive $4 million.\n\nMickey Wright and Betsy Rawls have the most U.S. Women’s Open titles with four. Four players have won the championship three times: Babe Didrikson Zaharias, Susie Maxwell Berning, Hollis Stacy and Annika Sorenstam.\n\nHere’s the compete list of the U.S. Women’s Open champions:"
