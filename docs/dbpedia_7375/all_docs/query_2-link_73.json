        "text": "1938 PGA Championship at Shawnee CC\n\nThe golfer on the left, who is also on the program cover, is Jimmy Thomson, the playing professional at Shawnee CC in 1938. Thomson was runner-up in two major championships, the 1935 US Open and the 1936 PGA Championship. Before 1938 Shawnee hosted 20 Shawnee Opens which were won by the biggest names in golf. The Shawnee golf course was the first design of A.W. Tillinghast. Paul Runyon won the 1938 PGA Championship, defeating Sam Snead in the 36-hole final 8&7.\n\nTo view the tournament program book click here.\n\n1939 US Open at Philadelphia CC\n\nThe 1939 US Open hosted by the Philadelphia Country Club, will always be remembered as the one where Sam Snead made an eight on the par five 72nd hole, when a par would have given him the title. The host professional, Ed Dudley, who had been paired with Byron Nelson for the first two rounds, was paired with Snead. As Dudley and Snead were walking to the next tee, Dudley said he told Snead that he needed a par to win. Snead later said that he though he needed a birdie. Nelson won the tournament in a playoff that took two 18-hole rounds to determine the winner.\n\nTo view the tournament program book click here.\n\n1940 PGA Championship at Hershey CC\n\nThe 1940 PGA Championship was hosted by the Hershey Country Club and its professional Henry Picard who was the defending champion. Due to rain one more day was needed, so the tournament ended on Labor Day. In the finals Byron Nelson finished birdie-birdie-par, to defeat Sam Snead, who was now the Shawnee Inn’s playing professional, one-down. Nelson might have birdied the last hole, but he only needed two putts from ten feet to win. The total purse came to $11,050. The posting of the program book is through the courtesy of the Hershey Community Archives, Hershey, PA.\n\nTo view the tournament program book click here.\n\n1942 PGA Championship at Seaview CC\n\nIn May 1942, Sam Snead, playing out of the Shawnee Country Club, defeated Corporal Jim Turnesa 2&1 in the final of the PGA Championship at Seaview Country Club at Absecon, New Jersey. Turnesa was stationed at Ft. Dix, New Jersey and two days later Snead was in the United States Navy.\n\nTo view the tournament program book click here.\n\n1944 Philadelphia Inquirer Invitation at Torresdale-Frankford CC\n\nThe 1944 Philadelphia Inquirer Invitation Golf Tournament was held at the Torresdale-Frankford Country Club. World War II was on and rationing of gasoline had brought the PGA Tour to a halt with only four tournaments in 1943. With that, PGA President Ed Dudley went to Washington DC and met with the chairman of the War Manpower Commission, who gave his approval for the golf professionals to purchase gasoline for travel to golf tournaments. In 1944 the PGA Tour returned with a schedule of 23 tournaments. One was the Inquirer Invitation, which put up $17,500 in United States War Bonds, the second largest purse on the PGA Tour that year. Sam Byrd who had worked as an assistant to Dudley at the Philadelphia Country Club won by seven strokes.\n\nTo view the tournament program book click here.\n\n1945 Philadelphia Inquirer Invitation at Llanerch CC\n\nThe second annual Philadelphia Inquirer Invitation Golf Tournament was held at the Llanerch Country Club in June 1945. This was the year of Byron Nelson’s eleven straight victories on the PGA Tour. He arrived in Philadelphia with six straight wins. That week the Nelsons were staying with Jug McSpaden and his family. With 18 holes to play McSpaden was leading Nelson by one stroke. Two time PGA champion Leo Diegel, who was now the professional at Philmont Country Club, showed up on the 13th tee. He asked Nelson how he was doing. Nelson said he was doing alright at two under par. Diegel told him that McSpaden had just posted a 66, so he had better get going. Nelson then birdied five of the last six holes for a 63 to win by two strokes. On the eve of the tournament first prize had been reduced from $5,325 to $3.333.33 in War Bonds and the number of prize winners increased from 21 to 25. This was to comply with PGA Tour guidelines.\n\nTo view the tournament program book click here.\n\n1946 Philadelphia Inquirer Invitation at Llanerch CC\n\nLlanerch CC hosted the 3rd annual Philadelphia Inquirer Invitation in June 1946. Byron Nelson was the defending champion, but he was retired from tournament golf and home on his ranch in Texas. At the first Inquirer Invitation in 1944 first prize had been 38% of the purse. The night before the 1945 tournament, PGA president and former Philadelphia Section president Ed Dudley had sold the Inquirer committee on reducing the first prize to 30%, in order to pay more places. Now the first prize of $2,500 was 16% of the purse, rounded up. In later years the PGA settled in on 18% for first prize. The tournament ended in a tie between Herman Barron and Lew Worsham. The next day Barron won the 18-hole playoff and each player received 25% of the admissions with 1,500 in attendance.\n\nTo view the tournament program book click here.\n\n1947 Reading Open at Berkshire CC\n\nThe first of five Reading Opens was played at the Berkshire Country Club in October 1947. There were 176 entries of which 149 were professionals. The field was cut to the low 100 after the first round and the low 60 after the second round. Ernest Joe “E.J.” “Dutch” Harrison, the professional at the Country Club of York, was the winner. A last round 68 gave him a seven under par 277, which was three strokes better that South Africa’s Bobby Locke. First prize from the $10,000 purse was $2,000. Harrison won two more times on the PGA Tour that year.\n\nTo view the tournament program book click here.\n\n1948 Reading Open at Berkshire CC\n\nThis was the first of two PGA Tour tournaments sponsored by the Daily News newspaper at Cobbs Creek Golf Course. The course, owned by the city of Philadelphia, was an unusual layout for the PGA Tour, with a par of 68. The course, which had been altered some by the installation of a military site for World War II, measured 6,243 yards. George Fazio made some changes to the course for the tournament. There was only one par five and it measured 630 yards. Ted Kroll, a former assistant at Philmont Country Club, and Doug Ford tied for first at one over par 273. Kroll picked up the $4,000 first prize with a birdie three on the first hole of a sudden death playoff. The golf course is now being renovated to bring it back to its former glory.\n\nTo view the tournament program book click here.\n\n1958 PGA Championship at Llanerch CC\n\nLlanerch Country Club and its professional Marty Lyons hosted the PGA Championship in July 1958. It was the first PGA Championship contested at stroke play. It was only through the effort and influence of Lyons, who had been a PGA officer, that the tournament was at Llanerch. First he had to sell Llanerch on hosting the tournament, then he had to sell the PGA on Llanerch. After that he sold the PGA on changing the format to stroke play.\n\nTo view the tournament program book click here.\n\n1980 Atlantic City Senior Open at Atlantic City CC\n\nThe 1980 Atlantic City Senior Championship, the inaugural tournament in the first year of the Senior PGA Tour, was held at Leo Fraser’s Atlantic City Country Club. Leo Fraser as president of the PGA of America in 1968 had formed a peaceful resolution between the PGA and the touring professionals, who were in the process of forming an independent players association. Now, by holding a senior tournament for professionals over 50, he was helping some of those same players get their new tour under way. Due to Fraser’s granddaughter being afflicted with diabetes, the proceeds from this program book were dedicated to the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation.\n\nTo view the tournament program book click here.\n\n1981 US Open at Merion GC\n\nIn 1981 the US Open was hosted by Merion GC for a fourth time. Merchandising at major golf tournaments had become an opportunity for the host professional to realize some income during a week or more, without golf lessons or member play. Merion professional, Bill Kittleman, who studied architecture at Yale had created a new logo. The logo for the US Open, 1981 US Open Merion, was embroidered on shirts along with anything else that could be sold. With his golf shop dedicated to the rules officials, Kittleman set up tents for merchandising at several locations on the golf course. Some of his fellow PGA professionals and their families assisted with the merchandising that week. Many golfers say that Kittleman’s Merion logo is the best logo in golf.\n\nTo view the tournament program book click here."
