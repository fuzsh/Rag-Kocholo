1957 US Open at Inverness Club Program - Dick Mayer Winner

Presented here is a program for the 1957 US Open at Inverness Club. This program is in very good condition, especially for a white cover, with slight wear to cover and separation in the upper left from the spine. Dick Mayer defeated defending champion Cary Middlecoff in an 18-hole playoff to claim his only major at the 1957 US Open. While he would miss the cut after shooting consecutive rounds of 80, the 1957 Open was the debut of amateur Jack Nicklaus. Nicklaus went on to win a record-tying four US Open tournaments.
