Alvin Richard “Dick” Mayer was a golfer in the PGA tour. Mayer’s career year was 1957, when he finished the regulation 72 holes of the U.S. Open at Inverness Club tied with defending champion Cary Middlecoff. He won the eighteen hole playoff 72 to 79 and his prize was $7,200. He later won $50,000 at the World Championship of Golf, topped the PGA Tour money list with winnings of $65,835 and won the PGA Player of the Year.

Dick also played on the 1957 Ryder Cup team. Mayer almost won the 1954 U.S. Open, but a triple-bogey on the final hole left him tied for third, two shots back.
