Mysteries of Lisbon (Mistérios de Lisboa)

Raúl Ruiz, Portugal

To Die Like a Man (Mourir como un homem)

João Pedro Rodrigues, Portugal/France

Highlights:

Film critics are constantly humbled by how much they haven’t seen, even in the oeuvre of a favourite performer. While researching a piece on Catherine Deneuve – an actress about whom I thought I knew everything – I watched My Favourite Season (1993) for the first time. In the third of six films she’s made thus far with André Téchiné, her most frequent collaborator, Deneuve plays Emilie, a woman growing estranged from her husband and her two late-adolescent children including real-life daughter Chiara Mastroianni in her screen debut). Emilie’s distance is understandable: her mother is growing frailer and she and her younger, erratic brother Daniel Auteuil) share the guilt of failing to care for her adequately. It’s one of Deneuve’s best, most undersung performances, a perfect distillation of a woman torn between the desire to relinquish all family obligations and the desperate need to hold her kin close – a template of sorts for the indomitable matriarch she plays in Arnaud Desplechin’s A Christmas Tale (2008).

Geoff Andrew

Head of film programme, BFI Southbank, UK

What a strange year! So many fine films and so many of them frustratingly, even fatally flawed. Of course, there’s no such thing as perfection but even so a large number of enormously impressive films this year fell foul, at some point or another, of overkill, cliché or some other niggling shortcoming. (I’m thinking of the dinosaur’s discovery of mercy in The Tree of Life, for example, or Michael Fassbender’s final, pathetic-fallacy collapse in Shame.) If this makes me sound ludicrously pernickety, remember that I’m not saying I didn’t find much to enjoy and admire in these and other works; merely that 2011, for me, provided fewer fully satisfying films than usual. That said, the following (in alphabetical order) certainly did the trick:

Footnote (Hearat Shulayim)

Joseph Cedar, Israel

Literary cinema in the best sense (with form echoing content); ethically astute and complex, refreshingly different.

The Kid with a Bike (Le Gamin au vélo)

Jean-Pierre Dardenne, Luc Dardenne, Belgium/France/Italy

Seemingly effortless filmmaking but note how the extraordinary energy accompanies subtle psychological nuance.

Once Upon a Time in Anatolia (Bir Zamanlar Anadolu’da)

Nuri Bilge Ceylan, Turkey/Bosnia-Herzegovina

Miniaturist and monumental, leisurely and lithe: entire lives encapsulated in one long night’s journey undertaken by a country doctor.

This Is Not a Film (In Film Nist)

Jafar Panahi, Mojtaba Mirtahmasb, Iran

Panahi invites us into the actual and imaginative realm of his apartment, where he’s conﬁned by the sentencing of the Iranian authorities. A man who clearly lives and breathes ﬁlm, he uses the camera – trained on himself more or less throughout the movie – as a means of liberation, sending his thoughts, experiences and feelings into the wider world. At once utterly specific in its focus and wholly universal in its relevance, it’s perhaps the bravest and most important home movie ever made.

True Grit

Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, USA

Genre cinema at its best: adult, unshowy and evocative of a vanished world both credibly familiar and utterly strange.

Highlights:

Best screening: the Sunday morning Cannes press show of The Artist(Michel Hazanavicius, France) – fun at last!

Best scene: the final (Guerín-directed) shot in Correspondence: Jonas Mekas – JL Guerín (José Luis Guerín, Jonas Mekas, Spain/USA) – Ozu, Kiarostami and other masters paid subtle, touching tribute.

Best film by a newcomer: Darwin (Nick Brandestini, Switzerland/USA) – documentary at its most compassionately, curiously humane.

Best revivals: La Peau douce (François Truffaut, 1964, France/Portugal) and La Piscine (Jacques Deray, 1967, France) – two very different but likewise piercing studies of desire turned sour, each deserving of far greater renown.

Melancholia

Le quattro volte (The Four Times)

Michelangelo Frammartino, Italy/Germany/Switzerland

Poetry (Shi)

Lee Chang-dong, S Korea/France

13 Assassins (Jûsan-nin no shikaku)

Takashi Miike, Japan/UK

Rango

Gore Verbinski, USA

The first four voted themselves in on a first viewing – movies that surprise, disorient, tease, shock, provoke, excite, everything great cinema should do. Rango took a second viewing to reveal all its delights: a Hollywod digimation comedy spectacularly fearless in its surrealism, with the year’s best voice-acting from Johnny Depp as the titular lizard lost in the far west.

Highlights:

Most memorable happening at a festival: the Lars von Trier rumpus at Cannes, which sorted the censoriously self-righteous from those who think artists should have the freedom to make fools of themselves, provided they keep making good films.

Most memorable cinema visit: seeing Paranormal Activity 3 in an American cinema, with a late-night Saturday audience volubly and near-deafeningly freaked out as the fright moments accumulated.

Sergio Angelini

Critic, UK

Portents for the next generation of TV releases on home video have been somewhat mixed over the last twelve months. In the US, cult genre shows like The Man from Atlantis and The Girl from UNCLE have been made available solely as burned on-demand releases on inferior DVD-R discs, while even high visibility titles like The West Wing have been announced on HD for download only, potentially bypassing physical media altogether. On the other hand, on this side of the pond several long-desired archive releases – such as the complete A Very Peculiar Practiceby Andrew Davies and the first series of Trevor Eve’s ‘private ear’ dramaShoestring – have finally made their appearance in tip-top shape after years of delay, albeit only in Standard Def.

Civilisation and Space 1999 made the transition to HD, however, with often remarkable results, while Tales Out of School, despite some technical infelicities, finally returned Made in Britain to the other parts of David Leland’s quartet of plays to which it rightfully belongs. The undoubted highlight of this year, though, has been the release on Blu-ray of the entire five-season run of Rod Serling’s seminal Twilight Zone anthology. Delivered in sturdy yet surprisingly compact amaray cases that, TARDIS-like, seem much bigger on the inside, the episodes themselves are beautifully rendered in HD from 35mm originals, offering image and sound quality of such richness and clarity as to be often utterly breathtaking. Even the weakest of entries from the later seasons offer not only the best possible presentation imaginable but also a huge array of supplementary materials. Classic TV, in every sense.

Tomas Alfredson, UK/France/Germany

Weekend

Andrew Haigh, UK

Highlights:

The transformation of Georges Méliès’ Trip to the Moon (Le Voyage dans la lune, 1902) through the reintroduction of his hand-painted colours.

After the British successes at Venice and Toronto, remembering that is was a vintage year for TV drama, too, with Appropriate Adult (Julian Jarrold), The Promise (Peter Kosminsky) and The Shadow Line (Hugo Blick).

The collective gasp of horror and delight) from the audience at the premiere of the BFI’s restoration of The First Born (UK, 1928) as Miles Mander meets his nemesis in the form of a paternoster lift.

Clear proof that the British documentary lives and thrives on the big screen: Senna (Asif Kapadia, USA/UK/France), Waste Land (Lucy Walker, João Jardim, UK/Brazil, 2009), Project Nim (James Marsh, UK).

Ken Loach’s generous decision to donate his papers to the BFI National Archive.

The indefinable brilliance of a widescreen Ann-Margret singing the title and closing tracks in Sony-Colombia’s Eastmancolor restoration of Bye Bye Birdie (George Sidney, USA, 1963).

Favourite movie scene of the year? A toss up between the dog/truck/Roman centurion shot in Le quattro volte and Charlotte Gainsbourg and Kirtsen Dunst facing the apocalypse in a hut of twigs inMelancholia. Both overwhelming in their very different ways.

Favourite TV drama scene of the year? Without doubt, Matthew’s Lazarus-like return to health in Downton Abbey.

Essential Killing

Jerzy Skolimowski, Poland/Norway/Ireland/Hungary

Snowtown

Damsels in Distress

Whit Stillman, USA

Highlights

Finally delving into Mikio Naruse’s films while writing an obituary of the great Japanese actress Takamine Hideko, and finding them to be everything their champions claim them to be and more. Why are they still so poorly represented on DVD? Won’t somebody please release Yearning, Older Brother, Younger Sister, Mother…?

Staying up ’til dawn watching Christian Marclay’s The Clock at the Hayward Gallery in March.

Seeing the restored print of Barbera Loden’s searing Wanda at the LFF.

Talking to one of the great British singers, Shirley Collins, about her memories of the Padstow May Day celebrations for the release of the BFI’s Here’s a Health to the Barley Mow DVD set.

The BFI’s Edward Yang retrospective, and in particular Taipei Story.

Seeing William Klein’s fantastic, revealing, hysterically funny The Little Richard Story at the ICA – one of the greatest music documentaries I’ve ever seen.

Anton Bitel

Academic and critic, UK

Kill List

Ben Wheatley, UK/Sweden/Australia

Bringing the traditions of Hammer up to the post-9/11 present, and utterly disorienting in its merging of kitchen-sink realism with unnerving surrealism, this takes British horror somewhere as uneasy in its familiarity as in its novelty.

Poetry (Shi)

Lee Chang-dong, S Korea/France

As a grandmother with Alzheimers attempts to compose her first poem, Lee Chang-dong’s quiet reverie lets viewers read between the lines of age, memory, regret and guilt.

Detention

Joseph Kahn, USA

While Joseph Kahn’s feature debut Torque was high-octane nonsense, his follow-up, though every bit as fast and furiously paced, is also razor smart, an echoing assembly hall of postmodern wit and manic pastiche. Not just a contender for best cross-genre teen movie but an impossibly seamless amalgam of most of its rivals.

Footnote (Hearat Shulayim)

Joseph Cedar, Israel

A tragicomedy of Oedipal conflict and textual criticism set in the small but surprisingly resonant world of Talmudic scholarship.

Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy

Tomas Alfredson, UK/France/Germany

Alfredson paints Le Carré’s novel four shades of brown, yielding a very adult thriller, shot and performed with elegant cool.

Highlights:

Second Sight’s DVD release of Joel Anderson’s reflexive faux-documentary chiller Lake Mungo (which would be my film of the year, were it not from 2008); Park Circus’s re-release of Ivan Passer’s wonderfully ambivalent slacker noir Cutter’s Way (a 70s film from the early 80s, as passed over and out of time as its characters); and the classification debate over Tom Six’s The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence), in which, over the course of just four months, the BBFC shifted from a categorical and category-denying) no to a compromising yes.

Bombay Beach

Alma Har’el, USA

Position Among the Stars (Stand van de Sterren)

Leonard Retel Helmrich, Netherlands/Indonesia

Snowtown

Justin Kurzel, Australia

+ Take Shelter (tie)

Jeff Nichols, USA

Highlights:

The vibrancy – not to mention urgency – of independent feature documentaries seemed to me the big story of the year. Leonard Retel Helmrich’s IDFA winner Position Among the Stars and Alma Har’el’s Tribeca winner Bombay Beach both extended the language of immersive verité-style documentary (the latter into the dance film) while taking impressions of modernity and its misfits in globalising Jakarta and back-sea California, respectively.

Steve James’s Doc/Fest winner The Interrupters and Carol Morley’sDreams of a Life each etched worrying, indelible fables of death and the city (gang war-ridden Chicago; atomised London), mixing compelling interview testimonies with verité footage in the former case and eerie reenactments in the latter. And these were just the tips of an iceberg of great work (Give Up Tomorrow, At Night I Fly, Shut Up Little Man! An Audio Misadventure, The British Guide to Showing Off…).

An honourable mention for Hiromasa Yonebayashi’s Borrowers adaptationArrietty (Kari-gurashi no Arietti), offering hope that Studio Ghibli might outlast its founding geniuses Miyazaki Hayao and Takahata Isao.

‘Live’ highlights: an afternoon of Christian Marclay’s The Clock at the Hayward gallery; James Benning’s introductions of (a lot of) ‘New Work’ at the Vienna Film Museum (and an interview for a forthcoming edition ofS&S); and Tate Modern film curator Stuart Comer’s introduction of a superb double-bill of documentaries about Los Angeles’ signage and street art, Thom Andersen’s 2010 Get Out of the Car and Agnès Varda’s 1981 Mur Murs.

Peter Bradshaw

Guardian, UK

The Artist

Michel Hazanavicius, France

A glorious film for which I am temporarily suspending my rule never to use the word ‘perfect’.

The Tree of Life

Terrence Malick, USA

Malick’s massive, and massively strange, Christian-humanist meditation on death and rebirth.

Arrugas (Wrinkles)

Ignacio Ferreras

This Spanish animation premiered at San Sebastian this year: based on a graphic novel, it is about a care centre for people with Alzheimer’s – funny and heartbreaking.

Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy

Tomas Alfredson, UK/France/Germany

A superbly achieved version of the Le Carré classic.

Dreams of a Life

Carol Morley, UK

Chilling, gripping psycho-archaeological documentary about London loneliness: the case of Joyce Vincent, the young woman who lay dead, undiscovered, in her North London flat for three years.

Nicole Brenez

Critic, France

Abel Ferrara in Lucca

Gérard Courant, France/Italy

A simple, modest and faithful record of some moments at the Lucca Film Festival in October 2010, with songs and speeches by Abel Ferrara: trace of the co-presence of two of the greatest contemporary filmmakers, dissident and true sons of Cesare Zavattini’s revolutionary spirit.

The Autobiography of Nicolae Ceaucescu (Autobiografia lui Nicolae Ceausescu)

Andrei Ujica, Romania

How propaganda reverses itself into a devastating critique of any political power.

Far from Afghanistan

John Gianvito, Jon Jost, Minda Martin, Travis Wilkerson, Soon-mi Yoo, Rob Todd, Pacho Velez, USA, in progress

To commemorate the tenth year of the invasion in Afghanistan, a collaborative work analysing the logics and consequences of American imperialism.

Impressions

Jacques Perconte, France

Digital fresco about Normandy landscapes that renews the forms of editing.

Video Letter

Masao Adachi, Japan

Adachi, still a political prisoner in Japan in the sense that he can not travel abroad, sends a video-letter to his audience to explain his ideals, fights and questions.

Highlights:

Book: Radical Light: Alternative Film & Video in the San Francisco Bay Aera, 1945-2000 (Steve Anker, Kathy Geritz, Steve Seid, eds), a scientifically and visually magnificent survey.

Film/Exhibition: ‘Correspondence(s)/The Completed Letters’, curated by Jordi Ballo for the CCCB (Barcelona, Spain): five video-letters exchanges between filmmakers from different parts of the world, including José Luis Guerín and Jonas Mekas, Albert Serra and Lisandro Alonso, Isaki Lacuesta and Noami Kawase, Jaime Rosales and Wang Bing, Fernando Eimbcke and So Yong Kim.

Retrospective: ‘Minding the Gap: The Films of Dick Fontaine’, curated by Michael Chaiken at the Anthology Film Archives, New York. A great British stylist and fighter with a knack for working exactly where the wind of history begins to blow.

Screening: On September 28th, the quality of the screening of John Gianvito’s My Heart Swims in Blood through Vimeo, during the World Cinema Now! Conference in Melbourne, was so excellent we could count the feathers on the Hegelian owl.

Michael Brooke

Critic, UK

For various domestic reasons, I skipped most of the festival circuit and saw fewer new releases than at any other point in my adult life. But, in reverse alphabetical order (since The Turin Horse was the clear winner):

The Turin Horse (A Torinói ló)

Béla Tarr, Hungary/France/Germany/Switzerland/US

If this really is Tarr’s last film, it’s one hell of a swansong: an end-of-civilisation parable set in a world that makes Lear’s heath seem like sun-kissed moss.

The Tree of Life

Terrence Malick, USA

Time will judge the lasting worth of Malick’s typically elliptical study of a 1950s childhood but as a visual and aural intoxicant it had no equals.

The Interrupters

Steve James, USA/UK/Canada/Norway/Sweden/Denmark

This portrait of volunteers tackling Chicago street violence stood out both for seriousness of purpose and the spellbindingly charismatic Ameena Matthews, gangland princess turned social crusader.

Essential Killing

Jerzy Skolimowski, Poland/Norway/Ireland/Hungary

With barely a meaningful word of dialogue, this existential parable about survival in a wholly unfamiliar environment was a spare, haunting little masterpiece.

Attack the Block

Joe Cornish, UK/France

This riotously entertaining South London-set aliens-meets-hoodies romp is the kind of unpretentious genre entertainment on which a viable national film industry should thrive.

Highlights:

The single most pleasurable cinematic experience I had this year was trawling through Second Sight’s DVD of The Colour of Pomegranates. After US, Japanese, French and Russian efforts, it was the fifth attempt at giving Sergei Paradjanov’s masterpiece a decent digital showcase and it finally did it justice, with an excellent transfer of the Soviet cut (rights issues precluded the inclusion of both versions and this is visually the best available) and a wealth of fascinating extras that shed valuable light on the history and content of this endlessly baffling and beautiful film. In particular, Daniel Bird’s wide-ranging documentary ‘The World is a Window’ made most other extras look anaemic.

Edward Buscombe

Critic, UK

This year I was once again on the jury for the Satyajit Ray Award, given to the best first feature shown at the London Film Festival. There were 40 films in contention, which made for a punishing if rewarding schedule; it’s a privilege to be allowed a snapshot of what’s new in world cinema, even if not every film is a masterpiece.

This year the standard was high, and we would have been happy to give to award to any of four or five films. Two stood out. One was Las acacias, an Argentine film directed by Pablo Giorgelli, with a deceptively simple, even banal plot in which a middle-aged and rather grumpy lorry-driver is obliged to give a lift to a young woman and her baby. In the course of the long drive, gradually these two people get to know and even like each other. Properly speaking, one should say three people because the baby certainly has a personality of its own.

Eventually, after much discussion, the award went to Li and the Poet, directed by the Italian Andrea Segre, about the relationship between a Chinese immigrant woman and an elderly fisherman, an unlikely story handled with delicacy and aplomb, and set in a wintry Venice, though not in those parts the tourists normally see.

Not a first but a second feature, Joanna Hogg’s Archipelago is that rare thing these days, a British film of restraint and precision, minutely detailing the kind of suppressed hysteria that seems so peculiarly typical of our upper-middle class.

I could not say that I enjoyed As If I Am Not There, a Macedonian film by the Irish director Juanita Wilson about the horrors of rape in the Bosnian conflict. It’s a harrowing film and a brave one, exploring emotions one wishes people didn’t have, not all of them belonging to the perpetrators.

Finally, a word for True Grit, not the very best of the Coens but a wonderful performance by the sainted Jeff Bridges.

Highlights:

Just getting to Fespaco (the biannual festival of African film) in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, in the same week in February that events took a distinct turn for the worse in Libya – when my original flight was via Tripoli – felt like a feat. But, 12 days later, seeing the festival’s big award-winners carrying their trophies through a sweaty, packed, post-midnight Ouagadougou airport (translation: building site), with everyone clapping, just hours after the closing ceremony in the city’s stadium was a real thrill that made the gap between filmmakers and audiences feel pleasingly small. I also bumped into the filmmaker-critic Mark Cousins in Ouagadougou, camera in hand, and he deserves a name-check for his masterly TV series, The Story of Film An Odyssey.

Dylan Cave

Curator, BFI, UK

Attack the Block

Joe Cornish, UK/France

Cornish’s debut took Edgar Wright’s sense of fun with British genre-blending and, in doing so, pushed the British urban cycle out of its po-faced rut.

Lin

Piers Thompson, UK

A BAFTA-nominated short about a middle-aged woman travelling across Europe in search of a building glimpsed in a vision, ‘Lin’ emerged at the start of the year. The film’s images – especially the barren futuristic architecture – have stayed with me ever since.

Senna

Asif Kapadia, USA/UK/France

I loved Kapadia’s populist tribute to the Brazilian sporting hero, partly because it celebrates the glories of archive footage as well as the drama of motor racing.

The Tree of Life

Terrence Malick, USA

The whispered dialogue and ponderous questions may have felt like Malick clichés but the film’s audacity, scale of ambition and faith in audiences impressed.

We Need to Talk About Kevin

Lynne Ramsay, UK/USA

Ramsay’s muted horror movie was provocative, divisive, beautiful and torrid – a welcome ‘return’ to filmmaking.

Highlights:

An unexpected thrill was seeing 94-year-old Bermudian actor Earl Cameron – a veteran of British social problem films from the 1950s and 1960s – delivering Othello’s final soliloquy to a mesmerised audience during an onstage Q&A. Elsewhere, the French premiere of Sue Bourne’s documentary Jig ended with two of the performers from the film suddenly appearing onstage and treating an already jubilant audience to their world-champion Irish dancing. Also, the rare British noir Corridor of Mirrors (Terence Young, UK, 1948) screened to a keen audience with an additional screening of a previously unearthed test reel of the film’s faded star, Edana Romney. Her onscreen pitch to get the film made was a fine reminder that the film business has always been one of perennial hard work, grit and prodigious good luck.

This Is Not a Film (In Film Nist)

Source Code

Duncan Jones, USA/France

Highlights:

I confess I often feel out of step with the multiplex audience but when you’re rolling in the aisles with them, as I was watching Bridesmaids(Paul Feig, USA/Japan), it’s a great feeling and a reminder of why people still go to the cinema.

The use of CGI in Take Shelter (Jeff Nichols, USA) and Black Swan(Darren Aronofsky, USA), as an expression of characters’ psychological tumult, seems to me worth infinitely more than the thousand ships and armies of digital cannon-fodder we’re supposed to wonder at in ersatz epics like Immortals and The Three Musketeers.

Footnote (Hearat Shulayim, Joseph Cedar, Israel) and the art of the hanging ending – a trope that seemed much in evidence this year but was rarely carried off with such satisfying élan.

The paper lanterns that float off the screen in the love scene in Tangled(Nathan Greno, Byron Howard, USA) – a rare instance of 3D beauty. See also the blizzard of cocaine in A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas (Todd Strauss-Shulson, USA).

Lowlight: the dismaying disappearance of video (DVD/Blu-ray) rental stores, whether of the independent or mainstream variety. I enjoyed having DVDs on my shelves, and found browsing rental stores a rewarding experience. That era seems to be over, or almost over, and here in Canada the catalogues of Netflix and other online distributors are sadly deficient.

The Tree of Life

Terrence Malick, USA

Deep, rich, deft in its camerawork and editing and sometimes dotty, this was undoubtedly the cinema event of the year, reaching all the way from Cannes into local multiplexes. Part of the joy of Malick’s grandiose exploration of childhood – both his hero’s and the earth’s – was seeing how it surprised and disconcerted audiences, often the same ones.

Faust

Aleksandr Sokurov, Russia

The conclusion of Sokurov’s extended meditation on the private lives of men associated with great evil (Hitler, Lenin and Hirohito) took us back to the roots of o’erweening ambition, with a dense, provocative reading of the Faust legend set in a magically morphed world that’s part Enlightenment science and part epic empyrean as imagined by Goethe. Awe-inspiring.

The Kid with a Bike (Le Gamin au vélo)

Jean-Pierre Dardenne, Luc Dardenne, Belgium/France/Italy

It’s too easy to take the Dardennes for granted, since their films remain resolutely focused on the interaction of marginal yet ‘normal’ characters and especially on the frayed bonds of child-parent relations. But between a desperate young runaway, his feckless father and Cecile de France’s would-be adoptive mother, there is a tension and truth that cuts through ‘broken society’ twaddle.

Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy

Tomas Alfredson, UK/France/Germany

An elegant, gripping entertainment that’s a model of concise adaptation and a fine piece of time-travel back into the mindset and the look of Cold War Britain. Like earlier visiting directors casting a fresh eye on cherished British genres, Alfredson has shown the locals how to do it.

The Soldier’s Courtship

Robert Paul, 1896, UK

Unbelievably, the very first fiction film ever shot in Britain, long believed lost, has turned up in the Rome Cineteca Nazionale and received its restoration premiere at the Pordenone Giornate del Cinema Muto. The result is unexpectedly well staged and acted, with two dancers from the Alhambra music hall, on whose roof it was shot, throwing themselves into an uninhibited display of affection that certainly beats Edison’s coy Rice-Irwin Kiss of three months later.

Highlights:

A superb French restoration of Méliès’s popular Trip to the Moon (1902), based on a coloured print from Barcelona, kicked off Cannes and showed at other festivals, reminding audiences of how impoverished our normal experience of silents has been. Mark Cousins’ wonderfully engaged Story of Film pilgrimage also appeared at various festivals before starting its run on More4. Another highlight was discovering the Chinese independent Xu Tong’s cycle of gutsy documentaries about colourful lives lived on the margins of China’s tumultuous recent history, when the latest, Shattered, showed at the CinDi Festival in Seoul.

Highlights

At the 2011 Cannes film festival, most of the films were screened in digital. We have to admit we enter a new area. We’ll miss the grain of 35mm and nothing will be better than the first print of a film coming out of the lab and being shown in the grand auditorium Lumière but the movie goers will certainly have a better average experience when looking at an old or new film in their neighbourhood theatre.

I was also struck by the high quality of a handful of British films, Shame,Wuthering Heights, The Deep Blue Sea and We Need to Talk About Kevin. And I don’t make this statement because I’m writing in Sight & Sound!

My third lasting impression was discussing with Jeff Nichols, the best independent American filmmaker to have appeared in years with two great films: Shotgun Stories and Take Shelter. I would like also to recommend L’exercice de l’état which seems to have been overlooked by the foreign press in Cannes. Pierre Schöller has made one the great french political films I have seen for a long time. Finally, Alain Bonfand’s book Le cinéma d’Akira Kurosawa seems to me one of the most stimulating studies I have read on a film director.

Roger Clarke

Critic, UK

Melancholia

Lars von Trier, Denmark/Sweden/France/Germany/Italy

I have never been an admirer of Trier but this seemed to me one of the most remarkable and passionate examinations of clinical depression ever made, taking the bold decision to depict it lyrically rather than with the usual bleached-out realism. It held me for every second of the screen-time.

Le quattro volte (The Four Times)

Michelangelo Frammartino, Italy/Germany/Switzerland

This mix of rural realism and a kind of mystical appreciation of landscape seemed at times more like French than Italian filmmaking, yet I think of Pasolini and realise that mysticism has been too long absent from Italian Cinema. I loved it.

Kill List

Ben Wheatley, UK/Sweden/Australia

Wheatley’s debut feature Down Terrace was criminally overlooked but this genre mash-up colliding gangster flicks with The Wicker Man was something else – entirely fresh and a million miles away from two decades of light British comedies that are, thank God, at last beginning to fade.

Elena

Andrei Zvyagintsev, Russia

This won the Special Jury Prize in Cannes for Zvyagintsev. The story of a nurse married to a wealthy former patient, it’s a tender tale of a reluctant murder and a miscreant son. I still think about it. That doesn’t happen with many films

Last Winter (L’hiver dernier)

John Shank, Belgium/France

American Shank made this French-language film set in the Massif Central in France. As I get older, I realise I have two favourite kinds of film: films that resemble dreams and films that describe a landscape. This has a fine central performance and thrilling cinematography. I do hope it gets distribution in the UK.

Highlights:

Wonderful to see a fully and meticulously restored A Trip to the Moon by Georges Méliès – the one with the moon with a face, one of the most iconic images in cinema still reused in pop culture from The Mighty Boosh to adverts for herbal sleeping pills. Air did the soundtrack – it works.

Other highlights include Park Chan-wook’s short film Nightfishing, a spooky little number beautifully executed and filmed on an iPhone 4 with the best use of a traditional Korean hat in a musical number since ‘Karma Chameleon’. I’m looking forward to his English language debut with Nicole Kidman.

I didn’t manage to make Miranda July’s Screentalk at the London Film Festival but I have promised my partner to mention it here, since he loves The Future (Miranda July, USA/Germany) beyond all reason, and since mentioning the film will raise an amused eyebrow from the editor ofSight & Sound.

Oranges and Sunshine (Jim Loach, UK/Australia) with Emily Watson hit me in the solar plexus since I was given up for adoption at the same time these crimes against adopted children were committed by Barnados and the like, and I glimpsed another alternate life, quite a horrible one, in the dust of Australia.

On DVD, another vintage year for Second Run with releases of Our Beloved Month of August, Red Psalm, and Szindbad the highlights – as ever, magnificent transfers and packages.

There were two stand-out moments of the year.

The conversation between screenwriter Paul Mayersberg and director ofThe Portuguese Nun Eugène Green at the ICA was erudite, in-depth, completely transfixing.

And Stuart Comer’s programming at the Starr Auditorium in Tate Modern is always stimulating and imaginative but screening Handsworth Songs a matter of days after the summer riots was inspired. The discussion afterwards, chaired brilliantly by Kodwo Eshun with four members of the Black Audio Film Collective present, was electrifying. I wish it could have gone on all night. “One of the masterpieces of 20th century cinema” is how Eshun described the film; but it’s still not on DVD.

Best discoveries – all down at the stalwart BFI Southbank – were Pastoral Hide and Seek, Arrebato (Rapture) and Cría Cuervos.

The Tree of Life

Terrence Malick, USA

I was in an edit suite all year but popped out to catch this, the greatest grief movie I have ever seen. It’s cut so fast that everything in it except the prehistoric scenes) is half glimpsed, as if sadness is something you see out of the corner of your eye.

Faust

Aleksandr Sokurov, Russia

Was this photographed by Julia Margaret Cameron? No film this year knew more about the wonders of cinematography.

I Wish (Kiseki)

Hirokazu Kore-eda, Japan

How does Hirokazu Kore-eda make his films with children so fresh? I Wish, in which kids trek to see bullet trains, was the funniest thing I saw on screen this year.

Bridesmaids

Paul Feig, USA/Japan

I Wish reminded me, strangely, of Bridesmaids, written by and starring Kristen Wiig. I saw it on a 10-hour flight. Few films can be great on those small screens but its vitality and spikiness made it so.

All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace

Adam Curtis, UK

This was so intense that watching it was like going into the den of a lion.

Highlights:

I started the year in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, where the central square in the city was closed so that filmmakers could hold hands and walk in a vast circle to remember the dead movie-makers of the previous year. So moving, and not something that would happen in the UK!

At the Telluride film festival I saw Lynne Ramsay’s We Need to Talk about Kevin and Steve McQueen’s Shame on the same day, back to back, and felt like I’d been carpet-bombed by brilliant Brits.

The revelation of the year for me was the Argentinian film Aniceto, by Leonardo Favio, shown in Telluride by legendary Brazilian musician Caetano Veloso. It was like a Rudolph Valentino movie, and as great as Vincente Minnelli’s musicals.

But my most memorable moment was in Moscow, in the apartment of Eisenstein’s wife Pera Atasheva. He didn’t always treat her well but there’s a note from him calling her his “soldadero”, the name for the women in the Mexican Revolution who travelled with the men. If his life was a war, she fought beside him. I raise a glass to her.

This Is Not a Film (In Film Nist)

Jafar Panahi, Mojtaba Mirtahmasb, Iran

A Kafkaesque comedy of anxiety and a tale of empty spaces gradually filled, this micro-scaled masterpiece spoke most deeply about the relationship between the artist and the camera lens.

The Deep Blue Sea

Terence Davies, UK

“Beware of passion.” The moving camera as emotion, music.

The Turin Horse (A Torinói ló)

Béla Tarr, Hungary/France/Germany/Switzerland/US

The most dolorously elemental film since Sjöström’s The Wind, the pulverizing bolero to Sátántangó’s tango.

Take Shelter

Jeff Nichols, USA

In a year rich with indelible cinematic nightmares (Kill List, Martha Marcy May Marlene), this haunted me the most.

The Tree of Life

Terrence Malick, USA

The end of summer, the Fall of Man.

Highlights:

Seeing Certified Copy three more times. Soaking in Kino-Eye goodness at Berkeley’s Pacific Film Archives’ Dziga Vertov retrospective. Savoring a triple-bill of mammoth masterworks (Aurora, Mysteries of Lisbon, World on a Wire) at the San Francisco Film Festival. Interviewing Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne for their marvellous The Kid with a Bike. Continuing to discover obscure gems (Ford’s The Rising of the Moon, Cukor’s Girls About Town, La Cava’s Private Worlds). Laughing from beginning to end with Horrible Bosses.

Kelly Reichardt, USA

Le quattro volte (The Four Times)

Michelangelo Frammartino, Italy/Germany/Switzerland

I mention Arrietty in particular not necessarily because it was my favourite film of the year, but because it stood out so starkly against the dominant post-Pixar paradigm of family feature animation, one ruled by 3D digital modelling and crammed with wisecracks.

Other highlights were the meticulously tracked emotional fall-outs of A Separation’s narrative, the thrilling wordlessness of Le quattro volte, the disarmingly low-key Weekend and in Meek’s Cut-off, the proof there is still life in this strange genre, the post-western western.

Kelly Reichardt’s use of 4:3 chimed with a concerted effort to reduce a personal To Watch list to a manageable size, to which end I saw many hours of the format this year. The highlights (whether because they fully lived up to, or completely exceeded, expectation or critical reputation) included Bergman’s Life of the Marionettes and The Virgin Spring, Ozu’sGood Morning, Isao Takahata’s Pom Poko, Nicholas Ray’s In a Lonely Place, Powell and Pressburger’s I Know Where I’m Going, John M Stahl’sLeave Her to Heaven, Preminger’s Anatomy of a Murder, Lumet’s The Pawnbroker, Jacques Tourneur’s Build My Gallows High, Carol Reed’sKipps and the remarkable, pellucid UCLA restoration of Kent MacKenzie’sThe Exiles.

Highlights:

In the year of the BFI’s comprehensive retrospective of Ken Loach’s near-50-year career in film and television, I jumped at the chance to visit the set of his new film, The Angels Share, shot in Scotland during the summer. I was there to write a set report for a glossy film magazine but over breakfast with the crew Loach suggested I double up as a extra in a press-conference scene being shot at a Highlands whisky distillery. It proved a perfect vantage point to observe the 75-year-old at work. There was no hiding behind video monitors or shouting through megaphones: through multiple takes, Loach unobtrusively made polite, practical suggestions and offered gentle words of encouragement to the youthful cast, whilst we non-professional extras were encouraged to add our own lines to the scene’s dialogue. Even if my contribution ends up on the cutting-room floor, I’ll have had the privilege of being directed by one of the UK’s finest filmmakers.

There were a number of superb cinematic reissues this year, includingThe Last Picture Show, Cria Cuervos, Cutter’s Way and Les Enfants du Paradis. The outstanding directorial season for me was BFI Southbank’s two-month Truffaut programme – a chance to appreciate on the big screen the conflict between what Robert Ingram has called “the absolute and the provisional” in the likes of La Peau Douce, L’Enfant Sauvage,L’Histoire d’Adèle H., La Chambre Verte and La Nuit Américaine. Let cinema reign indeed!

Las acacias

Pablo Giorgelli, Argentina/Spain

A Peruvian single mother, a cute baby and the taciturn loner driving them the 1,500km from Asunción to Buenos Aires. Giorgelli’s delicate and beautifully performed road movie is a lesson in stolen glances, silence and understatement.

Medianeras

Gustavo Taretto, Argentina/Germany/Spain

Both a study of Buenos Aires’s eclectic architecture and the isolating effects of life in a frantic metropolis, Taretto’s quirky take on the romcom is witty, stylish and deliciously idiosyncratic.

Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy

Tomas Alfredson, UK/France/Germany

Dark, menacing, and impeccably creepy. Alfredson creates a rundown cold war 1970s that echoes our own warped times.

The Skin I Live In (La piel que habito)

Pedro Almodóvar, Spain/USA

Almodóvar’s entertaining, exquisite and audacious fusion of melodrama, noir, horror, and sci-fi offers some telling comments both on his own filmmaking and on the value of the arts in compromised times.

The Waves (Las Olas)

Alberto Morais, Spain

Morais’s debut feature delivers the best film about the scars of the Spanish Civil War since Loach’s Land and Freedom.

Highlights:

In no particular order…

What does it mean to ‘write’ in moving images to a peer? The filmed letters between six pairs of filmmakers at Barcelona’s CCCB (Centre for Contemporary Culture) move between the visual poetry of Víctor Erice and Abbas Kiarastami, the revisiting of past works in the exchanges between Albert Serra and Lisandro Alonso, and the contrast between Jonas Mekas’ daily activities and the ghosts encountered by José Luis Guerin in his delicate black and white ruminations on film, memory and landscape. Magical.

Watching Javier Rebollo editing his new black comedy, El muerto y ser feliz, in Madrid.

Discussing Raise Ravens with Saura on a warm Saturday in June and The Skin I Live In with Almodóvar less than 48 hours later and mapping with each the landscape of filmmaking in Spain between 1959 and 2011.

A discovery from the past: Pastoral Hide & Seek (Den’en Ni Shisu) by Terayama Shuji. Plus two DVDs: Aita (Father) by José María de Orbe and Szindbád by Zoltán Huszárik. Equally inspiring, all these films, in their very different, idiosyncratic ways, push at the boundaries of cinema to transcend reality.

There were also two key rediscoveries this year, both part of the BFI Southbank season of post-Franco Spanish cinema: Carlos Saura’s Cría Cuervos and Iván Zulueta’s Arrebato; the latter haunted me even more than it did the first time I watched it. It’s still one of the most arresting, accurate depictions of addiction – to drugs but mainly to film.

Finally, David Lynch’s one-minute film ‘The 3 Rs’, made as the trailer for this year’s Viennale. Genius. Available on YouTube.

When I was explaining to a friend that I was choosing my top new silent films for 2011, he laughed and said, “But surely there aren’t any!” True, new-ness isn’t something you generally associate with silent film but my five favourites of 2011 all shared something novel or surprising to me.

Oblomok Imperii (Fragments of an Empire)

Fridrikh Ermler, USSR,1928

Top of my list was this complete revelation, seen in October at the Pordenone Silent Film festival. As the lights dimmed, I shifted uncomfortably in my seat wondering why I had never heard of it if it was in a programme called ‘The Canon Revisited’. Nor was I the only one transfixed by the ambition of Ermler’s filmmaking in his incredibly perceptive account of the returning memory of a shell-shocked soldier lost in time after the trauma of war and his anguished response to the transformed world he finds himself in. “Where is Petersburg?” he cries, faced with a monumental constructivist pile where his slum tenement once stood.

Highlights:

My best silent movie moment was a spontaneous gasp from the audience in the LFF gala screening of the newly restored The First Born (Miles Mander, UK, 1928) and my best new silent film discovery a fragment of the 1902 Coronation Fireworks bursting onto the screen at the Bologna Film festival in glorious colour. And this is novel: at the Cannes Film Festival, bastion of art house exclusivity, two runaway silent successes. A Trip to the Moon (Le Voyage dans la lune, Georges Méliès, France, 1902), over 100 years old, was painstakingly restored with its original jewel-like colours and, joy of joys, a brand new silent film, of sorts: Michel Hazanavicius’s The Artist which, despite its oh-so-clever tricks with the form, says something profound about the art of silent filmmaking. So there’s a good model for filmmakers in 2012: go a little bit cleverer and a lot more joyful.

Nostalgia for the Light (Nostalgie de la Luz)

Patricio Guzmán, France/USA/Chile

Two Years at Sea

Ben Rivers, UK

These most profound films of the year share a searching metaphysical enquiry, a tactile beauty, strikingly associative narrative forms and a committed sense of our relationships to place. They all seek to express the importance of non-material means of possession and communion, and new patterns of arrangement in the common realm, in the tension between local being and global sensibilities, and in the constant negotiations around emotional, intellectual, social, political, ecological and financial priorities.

Their attention to time, history and memory is equally welcome. But these works move beyond a linear perception of chronology towards a sense of the simultaneity of timeframes (a shift mirrored in the emergent radical understanding of the material universe within theoretical physics). In this multifarious awareness of the priorities of existence, they are extremely timely documents, whose importance as way-markers towards a richer, more balanced and just form of civil organisation will only grow. It’s a privilege to be living as such films are being made.

Dragon Coconut and the Monster Rabbit

Indigo Luksch

Finally, my favourite children’s film of the year is this five-minute epic by a very young filmmaker whose visual enthusiasm underlines how important imaginative flights remain, especially in such challenging times.

Highlights:

On a personal level, I have been proud to serve as co-producer of Grant Gee’s new essay film Patience (After Sebald), featured in Sight & SoundApril 2011. It’s gratifying that this has secured US and UK distribution, the latter with Soda Pictures, opening in January 2012.

Similarly, involvement with Studio 75’s remarkable ‘Flat Screens’ operation in Haggerston, London, has been a moving and energising one. This council flat screening initiative (www.studio75.org.uk) by artist Andrea Luka Zimmermann and her colleagues, on an estate due to be demolished next year, vividly displays the centrality cinema can have to discussions on how to live and resist.

Yes! That one!” Who knows if they’re the best or not, but they’re the ones I remember most fondly. Honourable mention should go to Nicolas Winding Refn’s Drive, not only for being ace, but also for providing the most memorable viewing experience of the year when I saw it at the press screening at Cannes. It was near the end of the festival and everyone was exhausted, enervated and overstuffed with heavy, deep movies. Drive was like mainlining pure cinematic crystal meth, a most welcome pick-me-up.

The Ferroni Brigade

aka Christoph Huber & Olaf Möller

Critics, Austria / Germany

Glorious and manifold were the splendours we saw all through 2011 and yet it took us once again little more than a minute to decide on the films we’d feature here. Mind, it’s not only about the works themselves but also about the way they relate to each other.

A Series of Ferronian Thoughts

Thank You, Heinz Emigholz

We begin with an austere, constantly surprising, immensely entertaining essay on language, simultaneous translation, the pitfalls of communication (Die Falten des Königs, Matthias van Baaren); continue with a direct cinema comedy of errors showing German and Austrian leaders of politics, arts and philosophy trying to talk deep (Führung, René Frölke); peak with a screwball tragedy featuring Charlie Chaplin, Bobby Watson, Louis de Funès, Alec Guiness, Romuald Karmakar and 60 more more or less notables all doing Der Führer – call it: Everybody’s Hitler ‘Notes on Film 05 Conference’, Norbert Pfaffenbichler); relax with this wickedly bizarre meditation on life under Berlusconi and his politics of fun macht frei (Joule 3D, David Zamagni & Nadia Ranocchi); and end with a state funeral of a most particular kind (Zamach, Yael Bartana).

A Dangerous Method

David Cronenberg, France/Ireland/UK/Germany/Canada

+ Alps (Alpis)

Yorgos Lanthimos, Greece

Modernism, its brackets: from the first attempts at healing through talking to a perversion of group therapy; from a way to finally find oneself to a maze in which one can avoid facing one’s self forever; from cure to sickness; from a generously enlightening clarity of direction to its eerily glacial other.

Target (Mishen)

Alexander Zeldovich, Russia

Anna Karenina done as a politically über-charged SF-allegory about contemporary Russia’s oligarch-class, its aspirations and pretensions – we might just as well say: the future of Europe. Aesthetically stunning, intellectually stimulating entertainment in the grand style. Maybe the sole truly perfect piece of cinema (in contrast to filmmaking) 2011 had on offer.

Schakale und Araber

Jean-Marie Straub, Switzerland

+ Empusa

Paul Naschy, Spain

AV-arte piss povera: from a Paris living-room to some anonymous stretch of beach in Spain; from the stranger niches of universe Kafka to the farther shores of planet Naschy; from wide-eyed recitation to its histrionic stepbrother; from rage as a life force to fantasy as a way of bidding life farewell.

Evolution (Megaplex)

Marco Brambilla

The Tree of Life in three minutes flat, minus Heidegger. Thinking man’sThe Clock. Quite possibly also the Faust II Sokurov never saw coming.

Highlights:

The thing that meant most to the Ferroni Brigade in 2011 was the Viennale’s tribute to Soi Cheang (Zeng6 Bou2 Seoi6) – finally someone did it.

William Fowler

Curator, BFI National Archive, UK

Melancholia

Lars von Trier, Denmark/Sweden/France/Germany/Italy

With the exception perhaps of Terrence Malick, Lars von Trier is the only director I can think of who gets to make highly idiosyncratic auteurist movies with A-list stars and sizeable budgets. I always catch his movies for this reason and I liked Melancholia. The beginning was wonderful and the dark confrontational humour was as brilliant and perverse as ever.

The Houseless Shadow

William Raban, UK

William Raban has been making films for over forty years and this, his latest, is an unusually intimate and uncanny affair. Reading Charles Dickens ‘Nightwalks’ over contemporary HD images of London at night, it’s both mystical and political – a rare combination – and really quite haunting.

The Pips

Emily Wardill, UK

A beguiling and curiously understated film. An Olympic gymnast completely intrigues and absorbs our attention but then the inexplicable happens and the film’s reality is playfully torn apart.

A Separation (Jodaeiye Nader az Simin)

Asghar Farhadi, Iran

I’m not sure if I’d revisit this Iranian film about a trial separation but I did very much like the way that it created considerable drama out a complex situation where no characters could confidently claim to be in the right.

The Empty Plan

Anja Kirschner, David Panos, UK

Artists Kirchner and Panos won the Jarman Award this year and rightly so. This Brechtian drama about Brecht in Hollywood is an incredibly ambitious production and, although currently on tour with British Art Show, deserves a wider audience still.

Highlights:

Presenting the BFI folk DVD Here’s a Health to the Barley Mow at the Cornish Film Festival and meeting Patrick and Jamie, the Cornishmen who lead the Mayday Obby Oss dance in Padstow.

Attack the Block

Joe Cornish, UK/France

There was no shortage of dread and uncertainty around this year but there were also plenty of very good British films. (I was also tempted to sneak in Self Made and The Arbor, both viewed in late 2010.) Most compelling home-viewing experience was the online stream for Sikh community TV station Sangat TV, whose kamikaze reportage of the looting in Birmingham this summer was punctuated with adverts for ghee and home furnishings.

Out and about, I saw a brilliant potted history of 3D cinema at Hamburg Short Film Festival, sat under a dual carriageway singing along to The Wizard of Oz at Assemble’s ingenious Folly for a Flyover, and got swamped by the BBC Symphony Orchestra performing Neil Brand’s new score to Anthony Asquith’s Underground (1928).

Memorable film-showing experiences included a post-apocalyptic outdoor screening of neglected end-of-the-world thriller Miracle Mile, complete with burning oil drums and foraged food; watching the gleaming white behemoth of the Vintage Mobile Cinema greeted with awe around the West Midlands; and playing old rave videos to late-night revellers in the Lost Picture Show tent at Shambala.

On the shorts front, the Swedes are still hard to beat (including Ruben Ostlund, Niki Lindroth von Bahr and Johannes Nyholm), while Canada has turned out a string of shallow, derivative and marvellous promos for the likes of Battles and Oh Land. Most rewatched YouTube clip was probably an astonishing bit of Indian breakdancing and my favourite DVD was the FilmoTeca de Catalunya’s compilation of 31 shorts by trick filmmaker Segundo de Chomon.

Bridesmaids

Paul Feig, USA/Japan

The Kid with a Bike (Le Gamin au vélo)

Jean-Pierre Dardenne, Luc Dardenne, Belgium/France/Italy

Filmmaking at its most flawless – an emotional, transcendental story of surrogate parenting that rewards repeat viewings.

Las acacias

Pablo Giorgelli, Argentina/Spain

Corpo Celeste

Alice Rohrwacher, Italy/Switzerland/France

A debut that shows how the coming-of-age drama needs to speak to the age. Here a story of a young Calabrian girl going through the rituals of catechism provides an astute reflection on contemporary Italy from the church to the state.

Jeff, Who Lives at Home

Jay Duplass, Mark Duplass, USA

Directed by the Duplass brothers, who have made their mark with intimate comedies from the microbudgeted Puffy Chair to the studio-funded Cyrus, this is a joyful play on character and coincidence as it follows a weird and wonderful day in the life of the eponymous Jeff, a thirtysomething homebody with a desperate desire to bring some meaning to his tracksuit-wearing existence. Ultimately a meaningful and modern take on family, the film’s warm humour and note perfect performances make it a model of economical (in every way) filmmaking that deserves to have big reach.

Highlights:

Meeting the Dardenne brothers at the London Film Festival provided me with my greatest highlight this year. In discussion with them about what they took from their background as documentarians to their fictional work, they commented that in both mediums they regard themselves as never being in control, that what they observe takes over. It might seem an odd comment – directing would seem to be all about control – but it’s the fact that they let the situations they create take on a dynamism of their own that gives their filmmaking such resonance.

A Dangerous Method

David Cronenberg, France/Ireland/UK/Germany/Canada

Notwithstanding the thrashings Jung doles out to his mistress and former analysand) Sabina Spielrein, Cronenberg’s account of the rift between the psychiatrist and his mentor, Sigmund Freud, is his most cerebral drama yet. Christopher Hampton’s script may be wry – pompous Freud is constantly miffed by Jung’s wealth – but the film offers a chilling subtextual analysis of Oedipal anguish.

The Descendants

Alexander Payne, USA

Payne continues his meditation on middle-aged male befuddlement with George Clooney excellent as a Hawaiian lawyer negotiating the past infidelity of his comatose wife while learning to forge proper relationships with his daughters and to value his ancestral legacy.

The Kid with a Bike (Le Gamin au vélo)

Jean-Pierre Dardenne, Luc Dardenne, Belgium/France/Italy

The devastating scenes in which 11-year-old Cyril is told by his father that he doesn’t want to see him again and later appears to die are achieved with minimal fuss. The Dardennes’ tale of abandonment is as spare and uncompromising as their others – we can forgive them the gestures of hope.

Melancholia

Lars von Trier, Denmark/Sweden/France/Germany/Italy

Von Trier’s faux pas may have cost him the Palme d’Or but no backlash could diminish the power of his most swooningly beautiful film, which contains trace elements of Caspar David Friedrich, Last Year at Marienbadand Tarkovsky. Psychologically, it all makes sense – you can see exactly what it was like for these sisters to grow up with a rancorous, depressive mother and a fool of a father, and why one, relieved of social burdens, grows serene as the rogue planet approaches.

Tyrannosaur

Paddy Considine, UK

Amid a cluster of challenging British films, Considine’s directorial debut struck me as the best because of its unflinching look at how guilt corrodes, how hate can fill the space vacated by love in a marriage and how violent rage seeks victims.

Highlights:

DVDs: Szindbád, ‘Ken Loach at the BBC’.

Charles Gant

Heat, UK

The Kid with a Bike (Le Gamin au vélo)

Jean-Pierre Dardenne, Luc Dardenne, Belgium/France/Italy

This is the film that moved me most all year, and uplifted me the most. It could easily be the most commercial and accessible film ever made by the Dardenne brothers but the challenge for its distributor is to communicate its life-affirming nature without spoiling the film’s significant moments of jeopardy for the audience.

A Separation (Jodaeiye Nader az Simin)

Asghar Farhadi, Iran

I shamefully missed all the press screenings for A Separation and then sat with astonishment as a paying punter. It’s a fully formed, perfectly executed film that keeps on surprising. It will doubtless feature in the Foreign Language ghetto of various awards schemes but, really, was there a film this year so well written, acted or directed? It deserves to be recognised in major categories.

The Artist

Michel Hazanavicius, France

The Tree of Life

Terrence Malick, USA

Senna

Asif Kapadia, USA/UK/France

Telling its story exclusively through archive footage, this is another picture that’s been delivered at the top end of achievement. It’s also hugely satisfying, and deserved all its commercial success, and more.

Highlights:

Seeing Charlie Kaufman’s lecture/performance/out-of-body experience as part of the annual spotlight on screenwriters presented by BAFTA and the BFI. If there could ever be a Sex Pistols at the 100 Club of filmmaker lectures, this was surely it.

A Separation (Jodaeiye Nader az Simin)

Asghar Farhadi, Iran

The year’s most explosive action movie and its most suspenseful thriller; remarkable too for its inexhaustible Renoir-esque compassion.

Le quattro volte (The Four Times)

Michelangelo Frammartino, Italy/Germany/Switzerland

A true one-off. The director is a man of highfalutin ideas which don’t stop him from acting the giddy goat. One set-piece in particular would have Tati squealing in delight.

Meek’s Cutoff

Kelly Reichardt, USA

A fat-free western dense in mystery and meaning. Bravo for the use of the 4:3 aspect ratio to enclose brutally a yawning landscape (see also Andrea Arnold’s Wuthering Heights).

The Portuguese Nun (Religiosa Portuguesa)

Eugène Green, Portugal/France

Green’s formally radical love story fizzes with playfulness: explaining that her latest film is unconventional, an actress receives the knowing response: “Boring, you mean?” It’s driven by its own seductive fairy-tale rhythm (in common with Julia Leigh’s Sleeping Beauty, another picture I admired greatly this year).

Lawrence of Belgravia

Paul Kelly, UK

Unsung pop genius Lawrence (Felt, Denim, Go-Kart Mozart) is the subject of this fond, oddly moving documentary. He’s penniless, craves fame, thinks the internet is rubbish and can’t spell ‘vagina’. The film builds a convincing case for him as one of British pop culture’s last uncompromising heroes.

In alphabetical order, here are my top five favourite new films that were released in UK cinemas during 2011. I’ve chosen films that made me want to punch the air and tell everyone I know to go see them.

Black Swan

Darren Aronofsky, USA

This delirious, genre-defying blend of psychological horror and melodrama is very feminine, a perfect follow-up to The Wrestler.

Dreams of a Life

Carol Morley, UK/Ireland

The Thin Blue Line meets Catfish in one of those intimate but universal films that challenges the way we feel about society.

Drive

Nicolas Winding Refn, USA

Great soundtrack, great jacket. As Refn said in an onstage introduction to the film “Wiolence + sexy romance + colour = cinema!”

Melancholia

Lars von Trier, Denmark/Sweden/France/Germany/Italy

I’d double-billed this with The Tree of Life, an incredible vision of domesticity crumbling into the end of the world.

We Need to Talk About Kevin

Lynne Ramsay, UK/USA

This adaptation of Lionel Shriver’s fetishised novel really works and stands alone in its own right by visually realising the compulsive horror of the mother/child relationship.

Highlights:

The Scala Forever season that played from August until October was a real triumph, incorporating old favourites such as Thundercrack!, Russ Meyer, John Waters, Jack Smith, Arnie and Dario Argento to celebrate the spirit of repertory cinema-going in a wide range of venues. No mere exercise in nostalgia, the season proved that a certain kind of programming unites and inspires audiences, whether in the backroom of a boozy bar, the Horse Hospital or the hallowed hall of NFT1.

Hors Satan

Bruno Dumont, France

Dumont aims for transcendental cinema and when he pulls it off, images and their power ricochet around my brain for days, weeks, years. This is Dumont sculpting Nolde landscapes, mainlining pure cinema.

Aman

Ali Jaberansari, UK

A perfect short film Iranian style, cool, calm and crafted with a little bite to end. A LFS graduate to track.

Morgen

Marian Crisan, Romania

This first feature by a young Romanian director deftly and humorously tackles migration.

La BM du Seigneur (The Lord’s Ride)

Jean-Charles Hue, France

This provocative and playful mix of doc and drama is set amongst Hue’s cousins on a French site somewhat like Dale Farm. It takes us into the heart of the caravans.

Highlights:

Some rediscoveries. Watching The Oak (1992) by Lucian Pintilie, the doyen of Romanian cinema, at the Cluj festival was a transformative experience and tracking down the rest of his oeuvre a very satisfying expedition. One film that blew me away this year was the experimentalAl-Yazerli by Qays al-Zubaidi (Iraq/Syria, 1972), screened at Tate Modern in March, which found an echo on the warm winds of the past for ongoing struggles. The box set of David Perlov’s Diary, covering 1973 to 1983 (ReVoir), takes you into another way of filming and observing life. What a genius.

The Turin Horse (A Torinói ló)

Béla Tarr, Hungary/France/Germany/Switzerland/US

This radically pared-down exercise in apocalyptic entropy is a masterpiece all the more soul-wrenchingly desolate for being Tarr’s last film. The soundtrack alone is beyond words.

Shame

Steve McQueen, UK

An aesthetically stunning, original and psychologically astute portrait of addiction and the terror of intimacy.

The Tree of Life

Terrence Malick, USA

This gloriously sublime and sincere, spiritual yet deeply flawed film was fascinating for the debates it provoked alone. It was like nothing anyone had ever seen.

Michael

Markus Schleinzer, Austria

An expertly controlled and complex study of the banal workings of power from Austrian director Markus Schleinzer.

Wuthering Heights

Andrea Arnold, UK

Arnold’s startling sensory assault stripped back artifice to recover the book’s essence, denying viewers easy sentiment in place of deeper emotional response.

Highlights:

A new Second Run DVD is always a reason to get excited, and this year’s release of Hungarian director Zoltán Huszárik’s surrealist Szindbád (1971) was a treat of strange, visceral elegance.

Catching Crispin Glover present his Big Slide Show at the New Horizons Film Festival in Wroclaw, Poland, was another highlight. This included a rare screening of his 2007 It Is Fine! Everything is Fine, a genuinely mindbending and fantastical yet profoundly humanising challenge to cultural taboo written by and starring cerebral-palsy sufferer Steven C. Stewart, in which he explicitly enacts his sexual fantasies playing a serial killer.

The Turin Horse (A Torinói ló)

Béla Tarr, Hungary/France/Germany/Switzerland/US

Reportedly his last film, Tarr’s vision is unlike that of any other contemporary filmmaker. Given that the Hungarian film industry’s new supremo – Andy Vajna (of Rambo fame) – has declared war on ‘unwatchable’ art movies, it may mark the end of a remarkable tradition – but I suspect not.

A Bitter Taste of Freedom

Marina Goldovskaya, Sweden/USA

Goldovskaya’s compelling documentary about the murdered Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya was shot ‘direct cinema’ style before her death in 2006. Apart from its testament, it also reveals the continuing power of the format and complements earlier works such as Solovki Power (the first documentary about the gulags) and The Shattered Mirror.

Twilight Portrait

Angelina Nikonova, Russia

Strikingly shot on a minuscule budget using a mainly non-professional cast, this examines the developing relationship between a young woman and the policeman who may have raped her. Echoes of Loznitsa’s My Joy, but the film also draws a compelling portrait of the separate worlds of professional life and a developing underclass.

The Princess of Montpensier

Bertrand Tavernier, France/Germany

Tavernier’s adaptation of Madame de la Fayette’s novel about 16th century politics and passion proves that old fashioned storytelling has plenty of potential if, as here, it is employed with thought and precision.

Alois Nebel

Tomáš Luňák, Czech Republic/Slovakia/Germany

Based on a cult graphic novel, Luňák’s film uses rotoscope to produce stunning black and white images. Strongly atmospheric, its tale of a middle aged railway worker and his memories of the past is also a reflection on the realities of Central European history.

Highlights:

Most interesting restorations: Jerzy Kawalerowicz’s Pharaoh (Poland, 1966), an unusual widescreen epic set in a mythical ancient Egypt that is also a muscular account of political intrigue, and Faithless Marijka(Czechoslovakia, 1934), a feature by the leading avant-garde novelist, Vladislav Vančura, about life and work in sub-Carpathian Ruthenia between the wars. Most interesting event: Jan Švankmajer’s discussion of his work with a capacity audience during the Barbican’s Watch it Move animation season.

+ Shame

Steven McQueen, UK

Sorry to do this troublesome shared place but I find it impossible to split these two; very different in many ways but each to be celebrated for originality and singularity of vision. How pleased I am that these two directors are making films and finding audiences.

Highlights:

Jonas Mekas’s Sleepless Nights Stories in Berlin (and then in London); Christian Marclay’s The Clock at London’s Southbank Centre in the spring; Terence Davies’s return to feature filmmaking; the excited anticipation, already, of David Cronenberg’s Cosmopolis; Woody Harrelson’s very funny LFF career interview; in fact, on a highly personal note for me, a wealth of warm, generous and hugely talented LFF film maker guests, as well as appreciative and engaged audiences, making my last LFF as director a 16-day highlight.

A Separation (Jodaeiye Nader az Simin)

Asghar Farhadi, Iran

This Iranian moral drama is both elegant in its structure and restraint and compassionate in its approach. But what really struck me is the universality of the story – world cinema that emphasises the common ground rather than cultural differences is always refreshing.

Martha Marcy May Marlene

Sean Durkin, USA

A confident and clear-eyed debut from Durkin, this was the year’s most effective psychological horror film. An arresting performance from Elizabeth Olsen was almost overshadowed by a chilling turn from John Hawkes.

The Artist

Michel Hazanavicius, France

Bliss. Anyone who loves silent cinema, or indeed any cinema at all, will be hard-pressed to film a more eloquent articulation of celluloid passion.

Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy

Tomas Alfredson, UK/France/Germany

A near-perfect adaptation of a cold war classic, this gets pretty much everything right, from the airless paranoia to the soul-crushing colour palette of the 1970s. Plus, the most stylish cinematography of the year.

The Yellow Sea

Na Hong-jin, South Korea

As brutal and urgent a slice of mayhem as I have seen all year. Not for anyone who is squeamish about axe-based cranial trauma – no guns here, the killing is at close quarters and the camera gets right in there with the blood and shattered bones.

Highlights:

A Brighter Summer Day (1991), screening as part of the Edward Yang season at BFI Southbank. This film had eluded me for several years and for various reasons, until it became something of a Holy Grail movie for me. Fortunately, it was worth the wait.

Highlights:

The Birds Eye View Film Festival has long been a highlight of the UK festival calendar but the 2011 edition has proved to be a bittersweet one with recent news that the full festival will not being going ahead in 2012, due to a 90 per cent slash in its public funding following the transferral of funds from the UKFC to the BFI (which currently has no provision for funding a festival of this kind). That the festival exists at all – acting, as it does, as a focal point for discussion of the importance of a balanced and diverse vision behind the films that reach our screens – is reason enough to cheer for it. In all honesty, though, what I’ll really miss come next March is a guaranteed week of top-notch cinema programming, events and one-off cross-arts performances, whose outstanding shared attribute is not the gender of those who created them but their quality.

The BFI’s restoration of Herbert Ponting’s The Great White Silencewas outstanding in every aspect, from Simon Fisher Turner’s new score (which features archival recordings including an original sample of the ship’s bell and ambient recording taken inside Scott’s tent) to Ponting’s charming intertitles to the simply breathtaking fact that such an intimate document of this Antarctic expedition exists at all. Watching it feels like stepping into a cinematic time capsule.

The Turin Horse (A Torinói ló)

Béla Tarr, Hungary/France/Germany/Switzerland/US

This was the year when the m word – masterpiece – lurked about the scene, an overused term I don’t like to see much in Sight & Sound. But let’s just say that for me The Turin Horse and Once Upon a Time in Anatolia are total works that it will hard for their makers to surpass. Of course, Béla Tarr has said he’ll never make another film. I expect Nuri Bilge Ceylan to make many more but I am still in awe of his new film’s achievement. The Kid with a Bike is another impeccably wrought moral drama of social observation from the Dardennes brothers; A Separationshows Asghar Farhadi to be a much greater talent than About Ellysuggested, a major new voice in world cinema. Le Havre was my great joy of the year, Kaurismäki at his very best, a film I’m sad to see so poorly represented in these commentaries, although I’m aware that its absence from the LFF must have hurt its chances. Perhaps it’ll sweep the board when it’s released next year.

For me, though the world economy has teetered on the brink throughout, 2011 was a red letter year in every way. The BFI absorbed the rump of the UKFC to become the main body for film in the UK. I served on festival juries in San Francisco and the Cannes Critics’ Week, and explored the vivid splendours and intense pleasures of two great long-weekend festivals, Finland’s Midnight Sun and Colorado’s Telluride. At the latterSight & Sound was awarded the Telluride Special Medallion, given to “a hero of cinema that preserves honors and presents great movies”. I was thrilled too to be part of the film that brought Terence Davies back to fiction filmmaking, The Deep Blue Sea (see our December 2011 issue), which closed the London Film Festival so memorably. And it has been great to have Saturday nights on TV given over to Mark Cousins’s splendid The Story of Film.

The Turin Horse (A Torinói ló)

Béla Tarr, Hungary/France/Germany/Switzerland/US

People have said this is about death but I think it could also be about Tarr’s own strained efforts to remain uncorrupted and autonomous as an artist. His masterpiece?

Photographic Memory

Ross McElwee, USA/France

The continuing adventures of South Carolina’s hypersensitive poet-philosopher and hardline auto-archivist, and the big news is he’s reluctantly switched from analogue to digital film stock. Black-and-white photographs from his student days spur him to seek out an old flame in Northern France, which also gives him time to reflect on his relationship with his ne’er-do-well son. As usual with McElwee, the film is rambling and intimate, the revelations are universal and heartbreaking.

Damsels in Distress

Whit Stillman, USA

Stillman locates the meaning of life in hotel soap. A perfect comedy.

Nana

Valérie Massadian, France

I adored Bertrand Bonello’s House of Tolerance and Julia Loktev’s The Loneliest Planet, but Nana is all the more impressive for being a debut. The performance by four-year-old Kelyna Lecomte tells the story of a marital breakdown through gestures alone. It’ll be a surprise if Massadian doesn’t go on to great things.

Highlights:

BFI Southbank’s retrospective of Edward Yang, a director I’ve known and loved for over a decade on the back of a single film. It was thrilling to discover the work of Portuguese husband-and-wife filmmakers Antonio Reis and Margarida Cordeiro at the Jeonju International Film Festival in South Korea, specifically their astonishing 1984 film Ana. Also catching the newly restored print of Barbara Loden’s Wanda (1970) at the London Film Festival made me wonder why it isn’t an established American classic.

Midnight in Paris

Woody Allen, Spain/USA

Woody Allen’s movie – his biggest hit ever, it seems – is simplicity itself. Eloquent, moving, hilarious, exhilarating: a tonic experience. The Dardennes film is one of their very best, and the balance between precision and a documentarian’s respect for ongoing life is fairly wondrous.

Words of Mercury is a new 25-minute film by the great San Francisco filmmaker Jerry Hiler, shot on reversal stock, developed and projected fresh from the camera at the New York Film Festival’s Views from the Avant-Garde. It’s the most gloriously sustained stretch of colour and motion I’ve seen since the silent section of Hou’s Three Times.

Speaking of Hou… In 1998, I watched Flowers of Shanghai with a friend who turned to me when the lights came up and said: “That’s something new in cinema.” I felt exactly the same about the Malick, a fearsome and awe-inspiring experience which, unlike past Malick films, is built on memory (in the matter of character). A lot of rhetoric has been tossed around about this movie, some of it ecstatic to the point of delirium, some of it hostile, resentful, and, it would seem, embarrassed. All of it seems to have been swallowed up along the way by the film itself and its immense point of view.

Highlights:

Film Forum’s Essential Pre-Code series was New York’s event of the year in revivals. And the loving restoration of Nick Ray’s We Can’t Go Home Again was another highlight – a living emanation from another universe.

A fiercely intelligent, emotionally and morally complex movie that never condescends to its audience. One of the best films to come out of Iran.

Meek’s Cutoff

Kelly Reichardt, USA

With its mythic, near-dreamlike atmosphere, this feminist Western nods to the classics of the genre while coolly overturning all their assumptions.

A Screaming Man (Un homme qui crie)

Mahamat-Saleh Haroun, France/Chad/Belgium/Cameroon/Burkina Faso/Netherlands

A moving, compassionate film, set in Haroun’s war-torn native country of Chad and shot with Ozu-like restraint.

Gonçalo Tocha, Portugal

Highlights:

I’d add to the above list the entirety of Ken Jacobs’ 2011 output, which includes the masterful ‘Seeking the Monkey King’ and a freshly made film set against the Occupy Wall St movements.

Best film of 2011 that isn’t a film (pragmatically, not politically, speaking): the second season of the TV program Louie. Louis C.K., better known internationally as the “Everything’s amazing and nobody’s happy” guy (four million YouTube hits and counting), hit his long-gestating stride with what is perhaps the best and most relevant American televised series since The Wire.

Biggest Enemy of the Cinema, 2011: DCP. Nearly all the film festivals I attended this year experienced everything from minor mishaps (where did the subtitles go?) to total meltdowns (the whole computer system just crashed!) related to the Digital Cinema Package file system. The good news is that 119-year-old 35mm film continues to be a durable and relatively problem-free format.

(Real) Biggest Enemy of the Cinema, 2011: the Iranian and Chinese governments. Festivals shut down, films censored, and people in the film community incarcerated cast long and dark shadows over the cinematic year.

Worst Film Event, 2011 (or ever): Cannes. At the world premiere of This Is Not a Film, Thierry Frémaux congratulated himself and his organisation for their valiant efforts in bringing to the festival a work made by someone who has been banned from making films in his home country. A few days later, the festival effectively banned another filmmaker.

Mark Le Fanu

Academic and critic, UK

Cinema continues to be healthy, in my opinion, with more films released than anyone could possibly contrive to see. So you have to make a choice: mainstream, art-house, documentary, classics, American series, animation – there is so much going on. My focus, like that of most contributors to this poll, is on art-house. Should that, or should it not, include wonderfully entertaining movies such as True Grit and La Princesse de Montpensier? Anyway, here are my five.

Faust

Aleksandr Sokurov, Russia

In a year of extraordinary formal inventiveness with ambitious films issuing from directors as different as Béla Tarr, Terrence Malick, Lars von Trier, Jean-Luc Godard and Pedro Almodóvar, this is the avant-garde work that most got under my skin. Completely original and captivating.

A Separation (Jodaeiye Nader az Simin)

Asghar Farhadi, Iran

The richness of Iranian cinema continues to amaze. What I and I suppose many other people) liked about the film was the sheer visceral suspense it manages to generate, combined with the humanity and wisdom of its take on life.

Elena

Andrei Zvyagintsev, Russia

Zvyagintsev’s third feature shows him completely back on form after the mild disappointment of Banishment. A number of films have come out this year about ‘the condition of Russia’. In my opinion this is the best.

Loverboy

Catalin Mitulescu, Romania

The scenarist of last year’s If I Want to Whistle, I Whistle proves to be as good a director as he is a writer. Set in the margins of Romanian society, his new film manages to avoid miserabilism at every level. The sun shines while terrible things happen: it is all believable, and heart-breaking.

Le quattro volte (The Four Times)

Michelangelo Frammartino, Italy/Germany/Switzerland

Let three adjectives sum up this film’s achievement: beautiful, simple, masterly!

Highlights:

We are all festival-goers, I suppose. Besides the chance such events provide to see a wide cross-section of contemporary film production, their worth seems to me to reside in the way that they bring the filmmaker into the presence of the public, either in the shape of a formal interview or else a spontaneous Q&A session. Among several such encounters this year I recall the pleasure of listening to Bernardo Bertolucci and Aleksandr Sokurov at BFI Southbank, and Andrei Konchalovsky (so eloquent and engaging) at Pushkin House. At the London Film Festival, Frederick Wiseman and Michael Glawogger defended their respective documentaries (Crazy Horse and Whores’ Glory) with humour and elegance; while it was more than enlightening to hear the modest yet passionate thoughts of two first-time women directors, Dictynna Hood (Wreckers) and Alice Rohrwacher (Corpo Celeste).

Freelance critic, UK

Alps (Alpis)

Yorgos Lanthimos, Greece

“You are not ready for pop,” a character says at the outset of this dazzlingly dislocated meditation on repossessed identity. Neither is Lanthimos: his worthy follow-up to Dogtooth is subtly spidery in structure before escalating to a full formalist freakout.

Drive

Nicolas Winding Refn, USA

The best film in competition at Cannes this year was the most unlikely: Refn’s hot, clipped, nasty fast-car thriller spliced the best of vintage Walter Hill with his own Eurotrash leanings and finally made a movie star of the deservingly ubiquitous Ryan Gosling.

Martha Marcy May Marlene

Sean Durkin, USA

All driftwood tones and permeable chronology, Durkin’s impressively nippy debut is the kind of horror film that settles upon its audience like a slow strangle. Thistly newcomer Elizabeth Olsen deftly keeps the film’s brittle boundaries of reality and paranoia in motion.

Tomboy

Céline Sciamma, France

Ostensibly smaller than Sciamma’s debut Water Lilies, her latest continues to explore the games children play with gender and sexuality but with even richer humanism and more fragile ambiguities: 13-year-old Zoé Héran is an unprecocious marvel in the lead.

Weekend

Andrew Haigh, UK

British arthouse cinema has been in rude health this year but while many of the big names delivered, Haigh’s shimmery boy-meets-boy romance felt most like a humble landmark: sexy, articulate and finally heart-crushing in its delineation of everyday homosexuality.

Highlight:

Within a week of each other, two music-in-film events at London’s Queen Elizabeth Hall made my year as early as April. Adrian Utley and Will Gregory’s rattling rescoring of The Passion of Joan of Arc was excitingly unfazed by the untouchable, while a film-accompanied Tindersticks recital of their collected collaborations with Claire Denis (marking the year’s most welcome, and belated, soundtrack release) was both a bloody good show and a spine-tingling testament to a living master.

Colin MacCabe

Academic and critic, UK

My filmgoing was heavily concentrated in Cannes this year, where Drive,The Tree of Life, Le Havre, The Kid with a Bike and The Skin I Live In all impressed. Why people liked the wooden and pretentious Melancholiaremained the mystery of the year. Since July, I have been teaching in Hyderabad and this has involved the discovery of Telegu cinema, perhaps the case study where economics, politics and aesthetics interweave. A must-see film is Stalin: Man for the Society, directed by A.R. Murugudoss (India, 2006). Starring Chiranjeevi (the most unlikely superstar in the history of film) as the eponymous hero, this is a socialist unrealist film in which Stalin institutes communism by getting everybody who has ever been helped in their life to promise to help three other people. I’m not going to try and summarise the narrative (the romantic sub-plot which seemed to involve his niece was particularly baffling) but for energy, drive and long-live-communism, we haven’t seen anything like this since Eisenstein.

Derek Malcolm

Evening Standard, UK

By the end of the year, I will have seen over 500 films as a newspaper reviewer, a great many of them so awful that you couldn’t possibly recommend anyone to buy tickets. Every week now 10 to 12 films have to be written about somehow. Around 50 of them, often from festivals like Berlin, Cannes and Venice, are worth it. This year many of them have been documentaries, from complete unknowns to virtuosos like Fred Wiseman and Errol Morris.

The fiction has been less impressive. Absolutely no masterpieces, and that includes Terrence Malick’s Cannes winner, which seemed to me to be a brilliant little film about family relationships encased in otiose pretension. If asked what was the best film of the year I would unhesitatingly plump for the Iranian A Separation, one of the very few films in Berlin worth remembering and a superbly fashioned family saga that holds you like a vice throughout.

The UK did quite as well as any other European nation this year even though I have more doubts about Tinker Tailor, Shame and Kevin, all good films, than some. What really pleased was the emergence of such tiny budgeted British films like Sound It Out, about the last vinyl record shop in the North-East, and Black Pond, in which Chris Langham emerged again after his troubles and was marvellous as the paterfamilias of a eccentric family who bury both their dog and a dinner guest in the garden “out of respect”, thereby getting into trouble with the police. This wasn’t even accorded a press show, by the way. So my five memorable films are (in no particular order):

At certain prearranged times during this year’s Rotterdam film festival, a large foyer was illuminated by something that started so modestly as to be hardly noticeable: YouTube clips of hands picking out the main riff of Europe’s 1980s hit ‘The Final Countdown’. But then the thing started to grow, unstoppably, deliriously: multiple screens, multiple versions (from bagpipe to techno), multiple settings (home, school, concert) and the weirdest possible assortment of all-too-real people doing all-too-real things. This was Koen They’s stunning collage The Final Countdown(2010) and the severe mental pain it administers via thousands of repetitions of a single riff is more than offset by its wit, ingenuity and window-on-the-world testimony.

Demetrios Matheou

Critic, UK

The Artist

Michel Hazanavicius, France

No film this year better expressed the pure pleasure in and of cinema. I imagine Hazanavicius’s tale of a silent movie star undone by the transition to sound elicits the same sort of surprise and exhilaration that early cinema itself must have done and in our knowing, multimedia age, that’s so refreshing. Romantic, comic, wondrously inventive – who needsSingin’ in the Rain?

Shame

Steve McQueen, UK

McQueen’s rigorous and riveting second film is much more than an account of a sex addict; it’s a shot across the bows for anyone feeling alienated in modern society. If they keep this up, McQueen and Michael Fassbender could become the new Scorsese and De Niro.

The Guard

John Michael McDonagh, Ireland/UK/USA/Germany

You’ve gotta laugh, especially when the world is crumbling around you, but I didn’t think I could laugh as much as I did in John Michael McDonagh’s crime comedy. This was smart, deliciously scripted and constantly surprising, with Brendan Gleeson’s bravura performance – unhindered by vanity or political correctness –
