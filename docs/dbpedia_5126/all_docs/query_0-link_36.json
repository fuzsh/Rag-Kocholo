        "text": "Toyota Parts and Accessories Warranty Information\n\nWhat is Covered\n\nToyota* warrants that it will either provide a replacement part or repair any Toyota part or accessory that is defective in material or workmanship. This warranty applies to new or remanufactured parts which are Toyota Genuine Parts. Toyota Genuine Parts are defined as all Toyota parts and accessories that are either manufactured or specifically approved by Toyota Motor Corporation and sold by TMS or its authorized Private Distributors to authorized Dealers.\n\nParts Purchases - With the exception of 12V batteries, Toyota Genuine Parts purchased over-the-counter or online from an authorized Toyota Dealer, but installed by a third party on the applicable Toyota or Lexus model vehicle, carry a 12-month parts only warranty from the date of purchase.\n\nService Part Warranty - The warranty for Toyota Genuine Parts purchased and installed by an authorized Dealer on the applicable Toyota or Lexus model vehicle, is 12 months, regardless of mileage, from the install date or the remainder of any applicable New Vehicle Limited Warranty, whichever provides greater coverage.\n\n12 Volt Battery Limited Warranty\n\nTrueStart batteries are warranted as free exchange from the date of purchase for 24 months, regardless of mileage, or the remainder of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty, whichever provides greater coverage, and on a prorated basis thereafter for up to 84 months. Proration is for the battery only (based on MSRP) and excludes applicable taxes, labor for installation and towing.\n\nTrue-2 batteries are warranted as free exchange from the date of purchase for 18 months, regardless of mileage, and on a prorated basis thereafter for up to 60 months. Free exchange excludes labor for installation and towing. Proration is for the battery only (based on MSRP) and excludes applicable taxes, labor for installation and towing.\n\nHybrid System High Voltage Battery Limited Warranty\n\nHybrid system high-voltage (HV) batteries installed by an authorized Toyota Dealer (excluding commercial, fleet or livery vehicles) are warranted for 36 months, regardless of mileage, from the date the part(s) was installed on the vehicle or the remainder of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty, whichever provides greater coverage.\n\nHV batteries not installed by an authorized Toyota Dealer, and/or installed on commercial, fleet or livery vehicles, will be covered under the 12-month Toyota Service Parts Limited Warranty.\n\nTires Limited Warranty\n\nTires are warranted independently by the tire manufacturer. See manufacturer’s statement for details.\n\nWhat is Not Covered\n\nThis Limited Warranty does not apply where the vehicle mileage cannot be determined or has been altered.\n\nDamage to a Toyota part or accessory caused by a non- genuine or unauthorized part or component is not covered.\n\nLabor for removal from vehicle and reinstallation of a part or accessory sold “over-the-counter” is not covered.\n\nLabor, parts, and other costs (such as all lubricants) connected with recommended maintenance service are not covered.\n\nService adjustments, such as calibration or alignments are not covered.\n\nFailures or damages resulting from improper installation, removal, repair, misuse, negligence, accidents, or modification of the part or the accessory are not covered.\n\nIncidental or consequential damages resulting from breach of this written warranty or any implied warranty (such as telephone calls, loss of time, lost opportunities, inconvenience, or commercial loss) are not covered.\n\nAny implied warranties, including those of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, are limited to the applicable duration of this written warranty.\n\nSome states do not allow limitation on how long an implied warranty lasts, or the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.\n\nThis is the only warranty authorized by Toyota. The performance of repairs or the replacement of the part are the exclusive remedies under this warranty or any implied warranty. Toyota does not authorize any person to create for it any other obligation or liability in connection with Toyota Parts or Accessories. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state.\n\nOwner's Responsibilities\n\nTo obtain this warranty coverage, return the part or accessory, or vehicle to which it is attached, to any authorized Toyota or Lexus Dealer (depending on the type of part and vehicle at issue). Proof of original purchase is required to qualify for this warranty.\n\nFor More Information regarding this limited warranty, please contact your dealership or call Toyota toll-free at (800) 331-4331// Lexus toll-free (800) 255-3987.\n\nRequests in writing should be sent to:\n\nBrand Engagement Center\n\nP.O. Box 259001, Plano, TX 75025-9001"
