        "text": "In the annals of literary revenge, critics come in for as much bludgeoning as you might assume, and, somehow, still less than we might deserve. John Updike, notably, had his fictional alter ego, the writer Henry Bech, bring all his imagination to bear as he serially dispatched his harshest critics (“satanic legions deserving only annihilation”). In a blunter mode, the romance novelist Jilly Cooper once named an incontinent goat for a reviewer who had savaged her work.\n\nBut, to see the job done properly, call in a critic. In the novel “Max Jamison” (1970), which was lauded in its time and is now cruelly out of print, the critic Wilfrid Sheed paints a merciless picture of his profession. Max, a film and theatre reviewer, tramps up and down Broadway excreting opinion, as contractually obliged, and hating himself for it. He is honorable, in his way. He refuses to pander, to flatter the powerful, to build a brand. He chokes on his own stock phrases. He cannot stop reviewing himself or his surroundings. His wife begs him not to grade their lovemaking. No inventive punishments prove necessary for Max—not when he is condemned to cart around his own curdled consciousness day after day. His punishment is being Max Jamison; his punishment is life itself.\n\n“Life Itself” is the title of the 2011 memoir by an actual film critic, Roger Ebert, and though it’s a supernaturally sunny account of the gig, Ebert allows that there is something “unnatural” about spending his days the way he does. “Man has rehearsed for hundreds of thousands of years to learn a certain sense of time,” he writes. “He gets up in the morning and the hours wheel in their ancient order across the sky until it grows dark again and he goes to sleep. A movie critic gets up in the morning and in two hours it is dark again, and the passage of time is fractured by editing and dissolves and flashbacks and jump cuts. ‘Get a life,’ they say.”\n\nWhat We’re Reading\n\nDiscover notable new fiction and nonfiction.\n\nBut what is that life in the dark? Out of what soil spring these beings who absorb art and photosynthesize it into pronouncements, or, worse, into principles. (Max Jamison: “Upholding standards like a minor customs official, while genius slips quietly by. Vulgar, sleazy old genius, that knows no standards.”) “Ruderal,” from the Latin for “rubble,” is what botanists call the plants that crop up in disturbed areas, in-between places, cracks and fissures. A genre builds; we can trace the life cycles of these in-between organisms. There are recent memoirs by the critics Margo Jefferson, Darryl Pinckney, and Janet Malcolm, along with accounts by the wives and children of critics, biographies of Elizabeth Hardwick, Gene Siskel, and Roger Ebert, remembrances of George Steiner. A cottage industry of books collates the lives, loves, and slights of Susan Sontag.\n\nSuch stories are spun out of deskbound lives, lives spent immured in one’s mind, one’s room. The critic vanishes into a book, and then steals furtive glances out the window, testing one reality against another. From my own window, I can see the ginkgo trees crisping, going gold. Winter is coming for criticism, too, we’re regularly told, with warnings about its eclipse trailed by hectoring about the role of the critic (by the critic), about the need for her wisdom and authority. The warnings aren’t new. Here’s Mary McCarthy, commissioned by The Nation to take on the critical establishment in “Our Critics, Right or Wrong,” a 1935 series. Here’s Elizabeth Hardwick’s 1959 essay for Harper’s on the decline of book reviewing. There have been others; there will be more.\n\nLet’s sidestep such impulses as we do the noisome ginkgo berries that litter the sidewalks. Let’s poke around in these ruderal lives. What primes someone for this work? What comes of being in such close contact with one’s own consciousness—one’s own taste, limitations, deprivations? Not just a life of the mind but a life in the mind, perpetually observing one’s own responses. Margo Jefferson, in her memoir “Constructing a Nervous System,” calls this observing self Monster, and makes it a character. Monster mocks, Monster annotates, Monster will not be appeased.\n\nIn this particular mind, my mind, there’s the furry feeling of encroaching fever. I haul off to bed, taking with me eighty-three books. All the lives of critics I can ransack from my shelves—memoirs, manifestos, letters, biographies—and whatever new volumes I’ve cadged from publishers. I take with me food critics, theatre critics, candid widows, disabused daughters, and the masthead of Partisan Review. I take the baby, also feverish, who naps, cheek squashed upon a fat and splendid collection of Kenneth Tynan’s theatre reviews, 1951-59. A colleague, a film reviewer, learns that I mean to write about the lives of critics, and e-mails: “It will be good to find out about critics who have lives.”\n\nWho was the real Max Jamison? Speculation abounded. Was it Pauline Kael? Was it Richard Gilman—who is the subject of a recent account, “The Critic’s Daughter,” by his eldest child, the writer Priscilla Gilman? Was it Anatole Broyard, a longtime Times book reviewer, a friend of Gilman’s, and himself the subject of a book by his daughter Bliss, “One Drop”? No, Sheed insisted, it wasn’t even himself. Max was meant to be the very essence of a critic.\n\nMy bedroom window overlooks the neighbor’s garden and, across it, a stretch of row houses. Now, in the early evening, lights flick on in various rooms, and I imagine them inhabited by the writers whose books lie scattered on my bed. V. S. Pritchett, in the aerie, is writing on a plank of wood on his lap. Sontag, one floor below, is flying on Dexedrine; her son is—as she once described—lighting and feeding her cigarette after cigarette so she never needs to lift her hands from the typewriter. In another frenzy, in another study, Pauline Kael is filling up her legal pads, wearing a rubber thimble, as she did, on the tip of her thumb. Lucy Sante and Darryl Pinckney, in the living room, riffle through vinyl records; Edmund Wilson and Mary McCarthy sit down for tea, his spiked with gin. Vivian Gornick laces up her walking shoes. Randall Jarrell calls to his wife—in a detail from Mary von Schrader Jarrell’s memoir of their marriage—that he needs her now, he has something she simply must see. “You’ll be glad you came,” he promises. It is a lettuce leaf, no bigger than a canary feather. “I knew you’d want to see it.” He pops it into his mouth: “It was much too good for this world.” It’s a febrile, sentimental fantasy, this house of critics—interrupted mercifully by the critics themselves, rapping at the glass.\n\nThey want out. The books weighing down my bedspread attest that a fair number of these writers would be dismayed to find themselves identified, in any meaningful way, as critics. Few chose the profession; it was as if a sinkhole opened up along their paths to somewhere more interesting and illustrious. Pauline Kael wanted to be a playwright. Margo Jefferson wanted to be a night-club pianist. Writers often turned to criticism to support themselves (those were the days!), because it was the only form of writing they could reliably complete. A startling number wished to be better known for work in other genres. Susan Sontag and Lionel Trilling bemoaned the fact that they weren’t recognized for their novels. “I defeated myself long ago when I rejected the way of chutzpah and mishegoss in favor of reason and diffidence,” Trilling wrote in his journal. Criticism is not a respectable job for “a thinking adult,” according to Renata Adler.\n\nIt’s a pity that so many showed the same signs of the unfortunate orientation at a young age. In fact, a Max Jamison composite comes together rather neatly. Here’s roughly what we’re dealing with: A family that’s marginalized in some way. A child, inculcated early in holding herself apart, perhaps nurturing some deeply held feelings of difference, even freakishness, develops a taste for blissful alienation, confirmed by engulfment in art. (Food critics attest to precocious appetite in a more literal fashion. Raymond Sokolov, in the memoir “Steal the Menu,” reports that, as an infant, he drank three bottles at every feeding.) Education is likely to be spotty and marked by cheerful hostility to received opinion. Elizabeth Hardwick sat incredulous at exam time, watching her classmates diligently scribbling—she was supposed to tell the professors what she knew they already knew?\n\nFor the work itself, there’s a carnal receptivity. (See the titles of Pauline Kael’s collected reviews: “I Lost It at the Movies,” “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.” Or Anatole Broyard’s “Aroused by Books.”) There is a creeping worry about ennui. The best critics maintain sensitivity, avoiding calluses, like a safecracker sanding down his fingertips. (Sontag: “I must begin to risk my sanity, to re-open my nerves.”) Notes from the home front reveal a different story. The superpower of the professional noticer may be a preternatural ability to ignore decisive realities in their own lives: facts, families.\n\nIn “One Drop,” Bliss Broyard examines the consequences of her father’s decision to pass as white. In “Also a Poet,” Ada Calhoun writes about her father, the late Peter Schjeldahl, this magazine’s longtime art critic, “The main difference is that I’ve been fascinated by him, and he’s often seemed to forget I was there.” Accounts of friendship, like the new book “Maestros & Monsters,” by Robert Boyers, the editor of Salmagundi, about his long association with Susan Sontag and George Steiner, sometimes devolve into ledgers of humiliations. But perhaps the greatest tribute to the uses and abuses of critical myopia comes from Gina James, Pauline Kael’s daughter (and assistant, driver, typist). At her mother’s memorial, in 2001, James said, “A lack of introspection, self-awareness, restraint or hesitation gave Pauline a supreme freedom to speak up, to speak her mind, to find her honest voice. She turned her lack of self-awareness into a triumph.”\n\nA fork in the path—where is the critic’s real life found, anyway? In the voice of the reviews: plump and plush, swollen with certainties? Or in the bonier voice of the journals and the diaries, the 3 A.M. voice, full of need, doubt, and self-recrimination, that asks what it has been for, all this work, all these fine distinctions? What fuels that shame-filled secret voice—of self to self, the ceaseless internal chastisements of Max Jamison? What has happened when a life lived for sentences comes to feel like a life sentence?\n\nI look up from my book, a little word-drunk, a little vaporous. The room is suddenly very dark. How much time has passed? The baby is speaking—when did that happen? She has one word and wields it majestically, pointing, in alarm and amazement: This, this. Someone has swept the sidewalk of the ginkgo berries. I have been reading Elizabeth Hardwick’s 1981 story “Back Issues,” in which a woman thumbs through old periodicals at the New York Public Library, admiring and pained—all those reviews, all those forgotten monuments to thought. “More hours of these lives were spent on book reviews than on lovemaking or even on making a living,” she reflects. Hardwick spent a lifetime doing the same—mucking about in other people’s sentences, other people’s minds, squandering herself, she sometimes thought, to parse other people’s desires. I can hear my children’s voices in the next room. The real mark of the life of a critic might be how much of it she is willing to give away.\n\nThe critic’s life “is heroic,” Henry James wrote, “for it is immensely vicarious.” V. S. Pritchett preferred the model of “unselfing”—the ability to channel someone else, the quality he most admired in novelists. The word is associated with the novelist and philosopher Iris Murdoch, who encountered this notion in the work of Simone Weil. For Murdoch, unselfing arose from “a just and loving gaze directed upon an individual reality”:\n\nI am looking out of my window in an anxious and resentful state of mind, oblivious of my surroundings, brooding perhaps on some damage done to my prestige. Then suddenly I observe a hovering kestrel. In a moment everything is altered. The brooding self with its hurt vanity has disappeared. There is nothing now but kestrel.\n\nMurdoch holds unselfing to be an antidote for all that narrows us—for solipsism, for tribalism. Art as well as nature enables it: the books heaped on my bed convey something of that desire for self-transcendence, self-forgetfulness. Randall Jarrell writes, in this spirit, of William Carlos Williams, “When you have read ‘Paterson,’ you know for the rest of your life what it is like to be a waterfall.” The forms of Marianne Moore, he saw, “have the lacy, mathematical extravagance of snowflakes, seem as arbitrary as the prohibitions in fairy tales; but they work as those work—disregard them and everything goes to pieces.”\n\nWhat becomes of our man Max? He trades reviewing for academia and then makes a hasty return; the air feels sluggish anywhere else. When we leave him, he is convinced that he hasn’t written a worthy piece in years, although he has learned that if you hang around for long enough you will be referred to as “our leading drama critic.” But, sometimes, taking his son to a movie, he feels it again—a “wild, dirty joy” he remembers from his own youth. It’s an echo of the initial receptivity that condemned him to this strange life spent beckoning, making that appeal to behold, to take in.\n\nLike my younger daughter, the critic says, with alarm and amazement, This, this. The injunction comes fringed with futility, and pain—how could it not? We strive to escape the self only to be returned to it. The way that our best critics float into the text, reporting from within vast spaces, can be born only from concentrated, claustrophobic thinking and stillness. These irreconcilabilities become the form. To extend the life of a work—a novel, a poem, a play—we feed it our own. ♦"
