        "text": "Looking at U.S.-produced films and documentaries since the turn of the mil-lennium, one notices a rapidly growing number of productions that diverge from official US politics or „mainstream‟ attitudes yet seem to be in tune with the views of statistically significant sections and/or ethnicities of the US population. The spectrum is remarkably broad, from Michael Moore‟s polemical „mockumentaries‟ to Clint Eastwood‟s, George Clooney‟s, or Gus Van Sant‟s critical „American‟ movies, to the films by and about ethnic „minorities‟ like Mexican Americans, African Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, Asian Indian Americans, et cetera. Also, most recently, films and documen-taries about the serious problems of U.S. veterans of the latest wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have begun to make an appearance in mainstream media. Altogether, over the last 15 years, movies and documentaries have increasingly put their fingers on critical social and political issues; ethnic minorities and women in particular have become much more visible and, most importantly, they now have their own filmmakers and scriptwriters rather than leaving the „power of discourse‟ to the old masters. This is partly thanks to new generations of ethnic and/or female American filmmakers, but partly also because of new digital technologies that have become available in recent years and now make the production of films as well as their distribution on DVD and via internet easier and considerably less expensive. With the creation of special audiences and virtual communities via YouTube and social networks like Facebook, Twitter, etc., the development of a growing number of “interpretative communities” that began in the 1970s has accelerated and reached a new global level.\n\nThis paper discusses how, in the first decade of the 21st century, documentary film rose to unprecedented significance in American media, succeeding not only in establishing a commercially viable niche in the filmic landscape but also having discernable impacts on public opinion, public actions and even public policy.This decade was one of unprecedented burgeoning of documentary production and consumption that entailed a great increase in output and some qualitative advances. While televisual documentary came to be associated with certain factory values that reflected the TV industry’s vast need for programming, theatrical documentary came in this period to be seen as a much more individually crafted, courageous, human-scale response against social injustice and the abuse of power. Hence, the era also raised questions about the social role of documentary, including the responsibility of filmmakers to serve the public's informational needs and to honor traditional journalistic goals, such as accuracy.\n\nThis book present some of my most important articles on documentary film and television between 1994-2020. During this period I developed a theory of documentary genres inspired by cognitive theory, a theory that put the basic narrative, emotional, and cognitive dimensions of media production and media use in focus. However, even though a basic, theoretical dimension runs through all the articles defining the main genres of documentary and the way audiences relate to and interact with this, they also try to illustrate how documentary genres interact with history, society and culture, and how they speak to and influence our individual mind and the collective public debate. Documentary is a very central genre in our highly mediated and global world: the stories they tell, can potentially create mediated cultural encounters between people belonging to different societies and culture. The case studies presented deal with our historical past and heritage, with the global climate change and with war and social crisis."
