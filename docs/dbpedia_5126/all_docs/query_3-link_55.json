Box 19547, Oley, PA 19547.\n\n\"The Boyhood of John Muir\" is a dramatic and compelling look at the early life of America's first great spokesman for wilderness.\n\nThe film is divided into three parts. In the first part, the dramatic battle lines are drawn: the free-spirited boy John Muir is pitted against his well-intentioned but unforgiving father, and the joy of nature is John's escape from the pious solemnity of their rugged life on a Wisconsin farm in the 1850s. In the second part, John gets help in his struggle from both his mother and from an older neighbor called the Yankee -- help that helps him live with his father and learn the beautiful and just laws of the natural world. In the third part, John begins to make inventions, a skill that carries him away from the backbreaking labor of the farm; but a trick of fate shows him what he really cares about. At last he abandons mechanical science to pursue his overwhelming love of nature and God's creatures.\n\n\"California Dreams: Yosemite National Park, Wilderness Man\" VIDEOCASSETTE.

Narrator: Carol McVeigh.\n\nPresented in two parts; Part One is a video excursion of all 212 miles of the John Muir Trail from Yosemite Valley to the top of Mt. Whitney. Not a slick commercial film, the video gives one the experience of hikers who really know and love the Trail, sharing their intimate experiences and the beautiful scenery. Part Two traces the length of the trail on topographic maps; a bit hard to read in a video format even on a fairly large screen. The video concludes with information on trail heads, permits, re-supply points, guidebooks, side-trips, and addresses.\n\n\"The John Muir Trail\"\n\n(Earth Images; Filmed, edited, and written by Lee Turkelson.

Produced by Lee Terkelsen, Earth Images Video Productions, Visalia, California, 2010\n\nThe spirit and voice of John Muir is alive due to the artistry of actor Lee Stetson who has been portraying the famous naturalist in Yosemite and throughout the U.S. since 1983. This documentary not only covers Stetson's remarkable career, but shows how Muir's eloquent words, written a century ago, continue to inspire and influence our attitudes to nature today. In this film, you will be inspired by excerpts from Stetson's five stage plays, journey with Stetson as he traces Muir's roots in Scotland and Wisconsin farm fields, and be captivated by the majesty of Yosemite, seen through the spirit of John Muir. Join Stetson as he performs stage plays based on Muir each spring and summer season in the Yosemite Theater and frequently guides visitors on saunters throughout the Yosemite Valley. Stetson has also performed as Muir in countless other venues around the world. A noted actor and historian, Stetson was the voice of John Muir in The National Parks: America's Best Idea,the acclaimed PBS documentary series by Ken Burns. Says Ken Burns about Lee Stetson, \"Our good fortune in this project was meeting Lee Stetson, who knows more about John Muir than anyone else on earth. Hal Holbrook has been able to bring Mark Twain alive for us and does so magnificently. Lee Stetson does the same thing for John Muir. \"As we got to know him... he [John Muir] ascended to the pantheon of the highest individuals in our country; I'm talking about the level of Abraham Lincoln, and Martin Luther King, and Thomas Jefferson, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Jackie Robinson -- people who have had a transformational effect on who we are.\" \" The video includes a half-hour bonus feature of Stetson performing Muir's most famous story: Stickeen. Join Stetson portraying John Muir in the Yosemite Theater as he recounts the famous adventure Muir had with a tiny toy dog in a fierce storm on an Alaskan glacier.

Presented by England's Channel Four. Shown on PBS, June, 1996.\n\nThe LA Times calls this a \"Misguided Travelogue\" - and they're right! The film maker here passed up an excellent opportunity to explore what Muir's 1,000 Mile Walk to the Gulf may look like today, but instead provides little more than scenes of driving a sidecar motorcycle down truck-infested highways; visiting motels and hotels; and finding almost nothing of Muir left in the South. Because Perkins travels with a dog, he cannot even visit the one place Muir visited which is now a National Park - Mammoth Caves National Park. The only bright spot in this dismal documentary is the visit to Bonaventure Cemetery, which appears to be as beautiful today as when Muir slept there in October of1867. This film is not usable for educational purposes due to its mostly irrelevant focus.\n\n\"The Mountains Call My Name\" VIDEOCASSETTE. American Folklore Theatre, October 2, 1989.

This version describes the show as follows: \"Join the Blue Canvas Orchestra for their musical portrayal of John Muir, founder of the national park system and the Sierra Club. Mount Ashwabay and the towering pines around the tent prove an ideal setting for the stories of Muir, a Scottish-born Wisconsin resident for much of his early life. Written by American Folklore Theatre co-founder Frederick \"Doc\" Heide, the show has been adapted by our own Tom Mitchell who plays Muir, and our Musical Director Ed Willett who leads the BCO in a moving selection of songs that celebrate the glorious natural wonders Muir encountered and wrote about in his travels. That glory is illuminated on the big screen with photography and film curated by our Visuals Director Betty Ferris. This show will be a feast for all of your senses and promises to become a new favorite Big Top Chautauqua show.\" The song The Mountains Call my Name is available on YouTube, performed by Steve Koehler and Jimmy Kaplan in 2013 in the Fishstock Music Series, at Camp David's concert barn in Fish Creek, Wisconsin.\n\n\"The Most Important Camping Trip in U.S. History\" - movie trailer.

The production company indicated that the movie \"MUIR\" would bevfilmed during late winter and spring/summer of 2011. Scenes would be filmed in Yosemite, San Francisco and Mt.

This newly illustrated anniversary edition is a major landmark in John Muir's continuing inspiration to our modern world.\n\nThe book details Muir's first extended trip to the Sierra Nevada in what is now Yosemite National Park, a landscape that entranced him immediately and had a profound effect on his life. The towering waterfalls, natural rock formations, and abundant plant and animal life helped Muir develop his views of the natural world, views that would eventually lead him to push for the creation of the national parks. The brand-new photographs from Scot Miller are a fitting contribution from the photographer who previously brought Henry David Thoreau's \"Walden\" and \"Cape Cod\" to life.\n\nThis book is being published in collaboration with Yosemite Conservancy and, for each copy sold, Scot Miller is making a donation to Yosemite Conservancy.\n\nNational Park Expansion and Almond Ranch Dedication - by John Muir Land Trust (YouTube) (1 hr. & 7 min.)

John Muir is played by Ben Goger. Available in VHS or DVD from Yosemite Conservancy, 23 minutes; (2001).\n\nThis state of the art orientation film for Yosemite interweaves the beauty of Yosemite with the historical influences that helped to create it. The film includes stunning vistas of Yosemite Valley, the giant sequoias, Tuolumne Meadows, and the High Sierra, often notable for amazing time-lapse photography. Historical vignettes include depictions of Galen Clark's discovery of the Mariposa Grove, and John Muir exploring Yosemite and drawing a map to show the boundaries of his proposed Yosemite National Park.\n\nThe Special Edition DVD version includes over 30 minutes of additional material in the form of 3 new short films highlighting the beauty of Yosemite Valley, the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees, and Tuolumne Meadows and the High Sierra.

(2000) Produced and Directed by Steve Parry, released by SunWest Media Group, Inc.\n\nThis video contains three chapters: \"The Poet and the Rough Rider,\" \"John Muir's Yosemite,\" and \"Falling Waters,\" all of which share much of the same film footage of Yosemite, shown in various seasons. The first Chapter includes narration of the meeting of President Theodore Roosevelt and John Muir, with dramatic sequences performed by Joe Early and Roosevelt and Lee Stetson as Muir. Unfortunately, this feature leaves out much of the dramatic re-enactment performed as a two-man play by Early and Stetson, and also fails to give any real details about their camping trip together. In an effort to enhance the drama, the producers misrepresent and exaggerate the differences between Roosevelt and Muir.\n\nThe second chapter, \"John Muir's Yosemite,\" features film footage accompanied by quotes and paraphrases from Muir's writings, with Rick Cimino as the voice of John Muir. The first section includes some of is more philosophical writings, while later sections feature his descriptions of waterfalls, forests, and other Yosemite features. A DVD feature includes a text John Muir profile. Unfortunately, the DVD menu for this section includes a photo of someone other than John Muir, whose only resemblance is the beard.\n\nThe third chapter, \"Falling Waters,\" features much of the same film footage, along with some additional footage, accompanied by piano music.\n\n\"Sweet and Easy\" by Kathy Muir - a music video of the song is on YouTube which includes images of John Muir in Yosemite, along with scenes of the Pacific Northwest depicted by Elizabeth Colborne's 1920's color woodcuts, and photographs (1924-1929) from the Seattle Camera Club, all \"artists from a bygone era whose work continues to inspire and is included for the first time ever in a music video.\"\n\n\"The Unruly Mystic: John Muir\" (2018 original; updated in 2021, with a new cut of the film known as The Scotland Cut, exclusively available on Vimeo.com) - Documentary. 1 hour 10 minutes. This film focuses on the uniquely spiritual or mystical insights to be gained from of the remarkable life and writings of John Muir. John Muir was among the first to teach us that the gift of wild nature has unparalleled value for its spiritual nourishment, yet his message continues to be a primary inspiration today. Outstanding video photography of \"nature's temples\" are intertwined with perceptive interviews from people who are inspired by nature's beauty, and who were often inspired to encounter that beauty by John Muir. The filmmaker combines his own special sense of connectedness with nature - - something that goes beyond mere \"outdoor recreation\" -- with insights about Muir and the sacredness of nature from psychologists, authors, park rangers, and practitioners from varied spiritual traditions, as well as from everyday people. The film engagingly goes beyond just quoting Muir in the soundtrack (by a narrator with a Scottish accent), but provides the written words on screen to help the reader fully engage with Muir's message. As followers of Muir attest, today we recognize the necessity of not just passively enjoying nature, but for actively working to protect nature's treasures in order for everyone to experience them.\n\nThis movie was created by filmmaker Michael M. Conti, Crazy Wisdom Films. The Asheville, North Carolina Premiere as held April 29, 2018 & May 24, 2018.

Not everyone realizes that John Muir was a great mystic who experienced union with the Divine through contact with the great wild areas of the West. In fact, his preservation efforts were motivated by a realization that - because all creatures are rooted in a personal Divine Presence whose love permeates all things equally â€“ they too are sentient. For Muir, this sentience imbued even mountains, rocks, glaciers, rivers and 'spirit skies.' In this Powerpoint presentation, Stephen Hatch examines the various elements of Muir's spirituality of Nature and of the people who influenced him, including Emerson and Thoreau. Hatch's own stunning landscape photographs illustrate many of the major points.\n\nYosemite Through John Muir's Drawings by Mike Wurtz (August 6, 2020) (YouTube) - Watch the recorded video of this LIVE Zoom presentation on August 6, 2020.
