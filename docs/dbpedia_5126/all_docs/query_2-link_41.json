        "text": "Stars reflect the overall quality of reviews and our own independent assessment (5 stars=don’t miss; 1 star=don’t bother).\n\nSign up to The Week's Arts & Life newsletter for reviews and recommendations.\n\nGodzilla Minus One\n\nAction/Thriller ****\n\n\"There are bazillions of Godzilla films out there,\" but this latest addition to the pile, directed by the respected Japanese filmmaker Takashi Yamazaki, \"is one of the very best\", said Leslie Felperin in The Guardian. The action takes place in a postwar Japan still recovering from the atom bomb attacks. During the War, Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) had humiliated himself by abandoning a kamikaze mission; now, he returns to Tokyo to find his parents dead, and his home city \"smashed to smithereens\" by Allied firebombing. He forms a \"makeshift family of sorts\" with a young woman who has adopted an orphaned baby; but their fragile life together is imperilled when a giant reptile pitches up and starts stomping through the ruined city. Godzilla, it transpires, had long been lurking in the Pacific Rim, but has been mutated and enlarged by American nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll. Yamazaki \"masterfully tightens and loosens the emotional screws throughout\" as he crafts a powerful story about ordinary people pulling together to \"defeat an inexplicable force of destruction\".\n\nMade for just £12m – peanuts for a blockbuster demanding \"this level of CGI\" – \"Godzilla Minus One\" is \"the kind of smart, emotional crowd-pleaser that Hollywood stopped being good at some time ago\", said Christina Newland in The i Paper. It's \"flat-out thrilling\", and provides \"one of the most fun experiences I've had at the cinema this year\". Clever and highly \"entertaining\", the film has a \"wonderfully realised period setting\", and \"characters you can root for\", said Nick Clark in the Evening Standard. It's \"explosive, heart-pumping stuff\", steeped in \"Godzilla\" film \"lore\"; and despite its small budget, it does ample justice \"to one of movie history's most iconic monsters\".\n\nThe Three Musketeers: Milady\n\nAdventure/Action ****\n\n\"There was much to admire\" in the \"rollicking\" first half of Martin Bourboulon's two-part adaptation of Alexandre Dumas's classic novel, said Wendy Ide in The Observer, including \"the swaggering fight choreography, the ostentatious insults parried along with the swordplay\", and above all, Eva Green's performance as the \"mercurial and merciless\" Milady, \"a spy and general agent of mischief in the French court\". If anything, this second part, which sees Milady \"slinking\" onto centre stage, is \"even more enjoyable\". It picks up where the first film left off, with Louis XIII's court a hotbed of \"treasonous plotting\" following a foiled attempt on the life of the king (Louis Garrel). War is brewing in La Rochelle; and D'Artagnan (François Civil) is scouring the land for his vanished lover. The film \"gallops through big chunks of plot\", and at the end, it hints that there might be more instalments to come. Given this triumph, I can only say: \"here's hoping\".\n\nThe first \"Musketeers\" film was \"unfairly overlooked\" by British audiences back in April; this sequel \"is a good excuse to either catch up or just dive in blind\", said Robbie Collin in The Daily Telegraph. Even if Green's Milady doesn't \"clinch it\" for you, there's \"plein-air swordplay\" to enjoy, plus \"zippy repartee\" and a plot \"that lunges from one quivery double-cross to the next\". It is, in sum, \"winter comfort viewing that treats its audience as gallantly as its heroes treat their mission, while taking itself just seriously enough\". The plot does get a bit tangled, and some liberties are taken that \"don't altogether work\", said Matthew Bond in The Mail on Sunday. But \"it remains one of the great joys of the year, especially for anyone who is fond of top-class swashbuckling\".\n\nWhat Happens Later\n\nRomcom **\n\n\"Meg Ryan is back, in a romcom!\" said Kevin Maher in The Times. Yes, the star who \"redefined the modern genre\" with hits such as \"You've Got Mail\" and, of course, \"When Harry Met Sally\"… \"is back. In a romcom.\" That fact, alas, is the best thing about \"What Happens Later\", in which Ryan, \"triple-jobbing as actor, director and co-writer\", plays a New Age healer who runs into an old flame (David Duchovny) at an airport. She is \"adorably kooky\" – we know this because she \"carries a hippy rain stick and struggles to use electrical sockets\" – while he is a \"no-nonsense business guy\". As their flights get progressively more delayed, they seize the opportunity to \"rake over the tedious coals of their failed relationship, moan about ageing and, in a scene too traumatising to fully relate, gyrate cringingly around an empty terminal building for the entirety of \"Pure\" by the Lightning Seeds\". Duchovny and Ryan's are \"the only two speaking parts\" in the film, which eventually leads to questions such as: \"Where have the jokes gone?\" and \"Is this hell, because it's starting to feel like it?\"\n\nI was surprised by how much I enjoyed \"What Happens Later\", said Kyle Smith in The Wall Street Journal. Yes, there are some \"too-cute moments\", and the film is really just one long conversation between two exes – but that conversation is \"by turns witty, wistful and revealing\", as are the performances. To me, their supposedly \"humorous banter\" felt almost \"precision tooled\", said Brian Viner in the Daily Mail. The film has all the \"effervescent charm of a Boeing cargo freighter\", and scenes so saccharine I had to reach \"for the sick bag\". I'm afraid it's more \"vomcom than romcom\"\n\nWonka\n\nFantasy/Musical ***\n\n\"On paper, it is the worst possible idea\", said Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian: a \"musical-prequel origin myth\" for Willy Wonka, the sinister \"top-hatted chocolatier\" from Roald Dahl's \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\". But thanks largely to the genius of writer Simon Farnaby and writer-director Paul King – the duo behind the smash hit \"Paddington\" films – this pre-Wonka is an absolute Christmas treat: \"spectacular, imaginative, sweet-natured and funny\". Timothée Chalamet is \"charm itself\" as the \"puckish\" young Willy, who sails to an unidentified European city to make his fortune using the chocolate recipes created by his late mother (Sally Hawkins). There, however, he falls into the clutches of a grotesque couple (Olivia Colman and Tom Davis), who force him to work in a laundrette, and when he tries to sell his magical sweets, he comes up against a trio of \"creepy chocolate overlords\".\n\nThe film isn't very Dahl-ish, said Robbie Collin in The Daily Telegraph. There are nods to the 1971 film: Chalamet throws in some Gene Wilder-ish line readings; and there is the odd tinkle of \"Pure Imagination\" in the score. But there is none of Dahl's sadism – and the film is all the better for it. \"Wonka\" is a \"self-contained caper\" of \"irresistible velvety sweetness\", and it offers \"one of the best times you'll have in the cinema this year\". It won't be everyone's cup of cocoa, said Kevin Maher in The Times. Hugh Grant, shrunk by CGI and wearing orange face paint, makes for \"a delightfully silly Oompa-Loompa\", but the film has a number of major flaws: one is Chalamet's singing voice, which is too \"thin and reedy\" to enliven the \"anodyne\" songs. Yet more problematic is the fact that there is no real plot. Willy \"wants to open a shop. They want to stop him opening a shop. He wants to open it. They want to stop it. He sings about the chocolates in his pock-olates. The end.\" There are one or two stabs at subplot, \"but scrape away the candycoated layer\", and the film \"is as hollow as an Easter egg\".\n\n\"Wonka\" is \"straining every sinew\" to be a beloved Christmas film, said Nicholas Barber on BBC Culture, but it doesn't quite pull it off. Borrowing bits and bobs from \"Mary Poppins\", \"Sweeney Todd\", \"Oliver Twist\" and more, it feels less like a single delicious confection than one of those selection boxes full of different brand-name chocolates in garish wrapping. There's no moment that makes you gasp with surprise or amusement; it's tooth-rottingly saccharine; Chalamet comes across mainly as a \"gurning goofball\". And though Grant is great fun, he is not on screen for long: you'll have seen most of his scenes in the trailer.\n\nChicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget\n\nAnimation ****\n\n\"Every so often a film comes along that makes you smile even before you've seen it, purely on account of the title,\" said Brian Viner in the Daily Mail. One such is Aardman Animations' long-awaited sequel to their 2000 hit \"Chicken Run\", which is \"exquisitely\" subtitled \"Dawn of the Nugget\". We rejoin the two main chickens, Ginger (now voiced by Thandiwe Newton) and Rocky (Zachary Levi), on an island paradise, where they and their fowl friends are living safe from predatory humans. But then their daughter Molly (Bella Ramsey) runs away and falls into the clutches of the evil Mrs Tweedy (Miranda Richardson), who is now running a poultry processing factory. Funny, \"deliciously imaginative and magnificently animated\", the film is a treat.\n\n\"Chicken Run\" has become rightly regarded as a classic family film – unbeatable in its \"distinctive aesthetic\" and gloriously \"absurd humour\", said Wendy Ide in The Observer. For me, alas, this sequel failed to match the original \"on any level\". It's not bad, exactly, it's just that there are \"no new jokes or fresh ideas\"; and there is a \"synthetic look to the colour palette that feels very try-hard and gaudy next to the lovely, atmospheric earth tones of the first film\". \"Dawn of the Nugget\" does \"feel generic\" at times, agreed John Nugent in Empire. But it is also a \"gorgeously realised\" fable \"about growing up, learning how to be parents and the dangers of the outside world\". Silly, amusing and distinctively British, it's a family film made with real \"craft and care\".\n\nEarth Mama\n\nDrama ****\n\n\"Now and then, it's good to be reminded that social realism doesn't have to be a drab meat-and-potatoes affair,\" said Jonathan Romney in the FT. \"Earth Mama\", the \"surprisingly poetic\" debut feature of the London-born writer-director Savanah Leaf, is about a single mother in California's Bay Area who is struggling to regain custody of her two children. We watch Gia (Tia Nomore) having tetchy meetings with her caseworker and sitting in group workshops in which she refuses to open up; but the film isn't some \"hard-tack docudrama\". Its mood is \"dreamlike\" and \"swimmy\", and Nomore gives \"a captivating performance of delicate but resilient introversion\".\n\n\"Demonstrating an extraordinary lightness of touch\", Leaf nudges the story from a \"social-issue drama into a compassionate character study\", said Kate Stables in Sight and Sound. \"The film swerves the traditional broke-single-mother tropes\", and instead shows Gia trying to retain control of her life, in spite of \"a system that persists in treating her not as a person, but as a problem to be solved\". Intimate and modestly scaled, \"Earth Mama\" is often \"so outwardly unassuming that you might not at first notice its artistry\", said Manohla Dargis in The New York Times. But there are moments when its \"quiet intensity seems to settle in your chest, as if a heavy stone had been placed over your heart\".\n\nFallen Leaves\n\nDrama ****\n\n\"Aki Kaurismäki has won every award going\" and is \"treated like a god\" in his native Finland. Though not that well known here, said Deborah Ross in The Spectator, he really is \"the business\". He specialises in \"understated dramas about deadpan losers\"; and his latest, \"Fallen Leaves\", is excellent. It follows two characters: Ansa (Alma Pöysti), a supermarket worker who loses her job when she's caught with an expired sandwich in her handbag, and Holappa (Jussi Vatanen), a metal-worker who is fired from a construction site owing to an accident unfairly blamed on his drinking. The pair meet at a bar, then fall into a romance of sorts, in which they run into one another, connect in some way, then drift apart again. The script is probably just a couple of pages long, but like an Edward Hopper painting, \"every moment is imbued with meaning\" and loneliness; and Kaurismäki treats his characters with such affection that you feel, by the end, \"you've known them for all your life\".\n\n\"Themes in this tragicomic romance include chronic alcoholism, job loss, isolation and despair,\" said Wendy Ide in The Observer. But what's remarkable about the film is that, \"dour though it is\", it is really quite \"uplifting\". It is shot through with a \"droll, deadpan humour\", and its central story of two lonely souls connecting is virtually \"feelgood\". The idea of watching a romance unfold between two \"rather sad\" middle-aged people who are down on their luck might not send you \"scooting to the cinema\", said Brian Viner in the Daily Mail – but \"believe me\", this \"quiet, sweet, witty, moving\" drama is a \"charmer\". Best of all, Kaurismäki believes that \"very few films should last longer than 90 minutes\", so it runs to just 81 minutes. \"More power to his elbow.\"\n\nEileen\n\nThriller ***\n\n\"Based on Ottessa Moshfegh's Booker-nominated novel of the same name\", and co-written by Moshfegh and her husband Luke Goebel, \"Eileen\" is an \"entertainingly grubby\" psychological thriller with clear nods to Alfred Hitchcock, said Alistair Harkness in The Scotsman. Rising star Thomasin McKenzie plays Eileen, a shy young woman who works as a secretary at a juvenile detention centre in 1960s Massachusetts, and whose life is turned upside down by the arrival of a new prison psychiatrist, \"the Harvard-educated, exotically glamorous blonde\" Rebecca (Anne Hathaway). There is a \"sexual undercurrent\" to their friendship from the off, but it's not balanced: Eileen is immediately infatuated with this \"assured, sensuous older woman\", while Rebecca develops an interest in one of the inmates – homicidal teenager Lee (Sam Nivola). \"Audacious and bold\", \"Eileen\" is the \"perfect feel-bad movie for the festive season\", and Hathaway is \"terrific\" in it.\n\nI'm afraid I found it pretty dire, said Kevin Maher in The Times. Its director, William Oldroyd, made his debut with 2016's \"Lady Macbeth\", which was brilliant. This, by contrast, is a \"deranged mish-mash\" in which Hathaway is stuck playing a \"kitschy homage\" to Cate Blanchett in \"Carol\". Her Rebecca is so heavily coded \"as 'sophisticated', or 'SOPHISTICATED!'\" that she smokes cigarettes with her gloves on, elongates her vowels and announces grandly to Eileen at one point: \"You remind me of a girl in a Dutch painting.\" \"Eileen\" is a \"stylish\" film, which is at its best when its two leads are on screen together, said Matthew Bond in The Mail on Sunday. But it \"takes a strange turn late on\" that left me both unsatisfied and feeling that much of its early promise \"had been wasted\".\n\nFemme\n\nThriller ****\n\n\"Neo-noir meets erotic thriller meets queer revenge tale\" in \"Femme\", the feature debut of writer-directors Sam H. Freeman and Ng Choon Ping, said Sophie Butcher in Empire. The film stars Nathan Stewart-Jarrett as Jules, a drag artist with the stage name Aphrodite who is subjected to a brutal homophobic attack by a group of men in a cornershop in London. Left with a scar on his forehead, and even deeper psychological wounds, Jules stops performing. Then, months after the attack, he runs into the thug who led it – George MacKay's Preston – at a gay sauna, and plots to teach him a lesson by sleeping with him, filming it and then sharing it online. \"This sets up a tense, exhilarating, often-uncomfortable exploration of sexual manipulation and shifting senses of masculinity – a pulse-pounding thriller delivered through a fascinating dual character study.\"\n\nThe premise of \"Femme\" is rather familiar, said Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian: nothing is more \"tired\" in films than \"someone going undercover\" in order to take someone down only to find that they start to develop feelings of friendship or respect for their intended target. But here, the storytelling is \"complex\" and \"tightly constructed\" enough for the film to escape cliché. In all, it's a \"great feature debut\" that keeps you on the edge of your seat. There is some \"wild, wayward plotting\" in the film, which builds somewhat clunkily to a \"grand reveal\", said Guy Lodge in Variety. Still, it's kept \"steady and emotionally credible\" by MacKay and Stewart-Jarrett's performances, which are \"sensational\".\n\nMaestro\n\nBiopic ***\n\nWhen \"Maestro\" was shown at the Venice Film Festival, its director and star Bradley Cooper was accused of performing in \"Jewface\", said Kevin Maher in The Sunday Times. He'd adopted a prosthetic nose to play the composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein, who was Jewish; Cooper is not. Cooper was also accused of \"gayface\", as Bernstein was gay and he is not; and presumably of \"not-an-actual-conductor-or-composer-face\", too. \"Cooper's answer to all this? He delivers an astonishingly beautiful film, by turns heartbreaking, tragic and tender\", constructed around two \"career-high performances\". The first is his own (it's a \"barnstormer\"); the second is from Carey Mulligan, who is superb as Bernstein's long-suffering wife. Their relationship is \"exquisitely handled\", as is Bernstein's evolution from the showman who wrote \"West Side Story\" to something \"more profound\". In sum: this is a film of \"dauntless ambition\" and \"sweet, overwhelming love\".\n\nFor me, Cooper's \"latex conk\" proved a minor problem – relative, at least, to his performance, which was so vain \"it almost had me running for the exit\", said Matthew Bond in The Mail on Sunday. I loathe \"big acting\", and that is what Cooper delivers here: he even lowers his natural voice \"to mimic Bernstein's bass nasal tones\". As for the way the film shifts between black-and-white and colour, depending on the era, that struck me as unnecessary and annoying. I didn't find it big acting; it seemed to me good acting, said Brian Viner in the Daily Mail. Not long before Bernstein's death, I saw him conduct. As both star and director, Cooper conveys \"the thumping charisma that made everyone in Bernstein's orbit dance to his tune\", in a sensitive and \"searingly intelligent\" film.\n\nLeave the World Behind\n\nThriller ****\n\nAdapted from the 2020 bestseller by Rumaan Alam, \"Leave the World Behind\" is an \"apocalyptic psychological thriller\" that is \"sharp-witted\", bleak and \"immensely enjoyable\", said Wendy Ide in The Observer. It stars Julia Roberts and Ethan Hawke as an affluent couple from Brooklyn, who take their two teenage kids to a luxurious rental in the Hamptons for an impromptu holiday, only for things to soon go awry. A cargo ship crashes onto the local beach, the phone signal cuts out, and in the dead of night, a father and daughter (Mahershala Ali and Myha'la Herrold) turn up at the house, claiming to be its owners – and asking to be let in. A \"disaster movie that builds in increments\", the film was executive produced by Barack and Michelle Obama, and it's a cracker: \"a provocative, superbly acted action drama that combines big-hitting ambition and spectacle with just enough humour to temper the whole end-of-civilisation meltdown scenario\".\n\nA \"home-invasion thriller\", this film \"operates like one of M. Night Shyamalan's better all-bets-are-off puzzlers\", in which a string of unnerving events \"slowly fuse into a coherent crisis\", said Robbie Collin in The Daily Telegraph. Part of the fun is watching these strange occurrences unfold, but there's also pleasure to be had in watching the dynamic between the film's four leads, which plays on \"broader American social tensions\" around race, wealth and sex. And it's a treat to see Roberts sink her teeth into the best role she's had in years. There are some good performances, said Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian, but the film is \"baggy\" and too long. And though its \"mood music of imminent horror\" gradually escalates, it never quite reaches \"a climax of fear – or meaning\".\n\nThe Eternal Daughter\n\nHorror ***\n\n\"If you're looking for a straightforward ghost story, 'The Eternal Daughter' isn't for you,\" said Christina Newland in The i Paper. \"But if you have the patience to stick with the strange and spooky rhythms of Joanna Hogg's semi-gothic tale, you'll be well-rewarded.\" A sequel of sorts to Hogg's two \"Souvenir\" films (2019 and 2021) made during lockdown, it stars Tilda Swinton as Julie, a filmmaker who takes her elderly mother Rosalind (also played by Swinton) to rural Wales to celebrate Rosalind's birthday. They stay at an old hotel that, it soon emerges, is probably haunted: there are \"mysterious knocks in the night\", and at one point a \"spectral face\" suddenly appears. Hogg's talent \"lies less in her plotting\" than in the \"suggestive power of her images\"; and the cumulative effect is a \"creeping, uncanny\" horror film \"without the horror\", a study of a mother-daughter relationship \"where the line between intimacy and discomfort is always on a knife's edge\".\n\nThis film \"exudes the ominous melancholy of an M.R. James short story\", said Jonathan Romney in the Financial Times, but it is \"also a brittle comedy of English manners, with Julie forever politely writhing in her own net of solicitude and apologies\". An \"elusive miniature\", it provides not scares but \"psychological frissons in the most delicate minor key\". Hogg \"has a knack for conjuring impactful scenes out of nothing\", said Tara Brady in The Irish Times: when Rosalind's dog Louis goes missing for instance, it feels \"genuinely apocalyptic\". But the tale is really quite \"slight\"; the film's \"big reveal is signposted early\", and the \"spectral goings-on can feel insubstantial\".\n\nNapoleon\n\nBiopic/Action ****\n\n\"If, at 85, Ridley Scott has reached the final season of his filmmaking career, 'Napoleon' is the ideal work of wintry grandeur to mark it,\" said Robbie Collin in The Daily Telegraph. His biopic of the French emperor is a \"magnificently hewn slab of dad cinema with a chill wind whistling over its battlefields\", and a palette so cold, \"even the red in the tricolore is often the shade of dried blood\". Spanning 32 years, from the start of the Revolution in 1789 to Napoleon's lonely death in 1821, the film casts Boney's \"rise, reign and downfall as both a prickly psychodrama and a sweeping military epic, in which the intimate lives of its central players and the fate of France itself\" are \"instantly and anxiously entwined\". It's not exactly a funny film, and at moments it does feel a little staid. \"But only a true master general could corral a piece of cinema this rolling and rich.\"\n\n\"Pedants, beware,\" said Kevin Maher in The Times: this \"eye-gouging spectacular\" is not an \"accurate history lesson\" (among other things, Scott imagines Napoleon witnessing Marie Antoinette's execution, and ordering his forces to fire at the pyramids). But the emperor is powerfully portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, in a performance that \"hovers\" in a \"twitchy\" shifting \"grey zone\" between imperious anger, \"wounded vulnerability and puckish charm\". Sometimes he combines all three, as when he throws a tantrum at the perceived superiority of his British foes. \"They think they're so great!\" he seethes, \"because they've got boats!\"\n\nI'm afraid I wasn't sold, said Johnny Oleksinski in the New York Post. It seemed to me that Phoenix (who uses his normal American accent) is just repeating his \"creepy, whack-job performance\" from \"Joker\", only this time in a pointy hat. It's also problematic that the film depicts one of history's great leaders as \"a total moron\": you'd never know that this was the \"guy who commissioned the Napoleonic Code\". And though his tempestuous relationship with Joséphine (Vanessa Kirby) gets \"ample airtime\", it's weirdly handled. \"On one of the couple's first dates, she spreads her legs 'Basic Instinct'-style and says, 'If you look down, you'll see a surprise. And once you've seen it, you'll always want it.'\" Sorry, but \"Eww\". This biopic doesn't explain why Napoleon is \"so deeply in love with Joséphine, or whether she is in love with him at all\", said Nicholas Barber on BBC Culture – a \"vagueness\" that is true of other relationships in the film, too. But \"scene by scene\", Scott's \"proper, old-fashioned historical epic is terrific fun\", even if it lacks insights into \"who Napoleon is or what he wants, where he comes from or why he is such a success\".\n\nSaltburn\n\nThriller ***\n\nAn \"exuberant satire on class and privilege\", \"Saltburn\" is made by Emerald Fennell, who won wide acclaim for her 2020 debut \"Promising Young Woman\", said Brian Viner in the Daily Mail. Set in 2006, this \"flawed, but at times wildly enjoyable\" film follows Oliver (Barry Keoghan), a working-class teenager from Merseyside who feels \"like a fish out of water\" when he arrives at Oxford University. Soon, however, he has \"burrowed his way into the affections\" of dishy, wealthy Felix (Jacob Elordi); and is invited to spend the summer at Felix's country pile. The film starts as a kind of \"Brideshead\" with \"gags\", but in the second half turns into a \"dark psychosexual thriller\" – at which point, alas, it goes rather downhill. Still, \"at its funniest\", the film is a \"proper hoot\".\n\nThere are some \"perverse pleasures\" to be enjoyed here, said Wendy Ide in The Observer – Rosamund Pike is \"gloriously rude\", for instance, as Felix's mother Elspeth, and has some good lines. (\"I was a lesbian for a while,\" she drawls, \"but it was all a bit too wet for me in the end.\") But the film has \"no sense of build-up and payoff\", and Keoghan, who is \"way too old for the role\", is badly miscast. Fennell wants us \"to be glued to our seats by this Bruegelian frieze of lust and avariciousness\", said Tom Shone in The Sunday Times; \"but mostly what we are is bored\". There is lots of \"spit and semen and blood\", but no depth, \"no character who isn't bent to the task of provocation, and nowhere for the story to go except a murderous spiral of jaw-dropping ludicrousness\".\n\nMay December\n\nDrama ***\n\nIn 1995, director Todd Haynes and actress Julianne Moore made their \"dual breakthrough\" with \"Safe\", a portrait of a housewife \"made ill by contemporary life\", said Danny Leigh in the Financial Times. Now, almost 30 years on, they have reunited for \"May December\", \"an expertly arch comic drama with Moore again undone in suburbia\". Here, her character is Gracie, who more than two decades ago had a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old boy. \"Scandal and prison followed, before a slow return to obscurity.\" But now, there is talk about her case being made into a film, with Gracie played by a movie star (Natalie Portman). \"Watching Portman watch Moore, and Moore watch her back, is fascinating\", and Haynes leads us through the \"hall of mirrors\" with \"scampish intelligence\".\n\nA \"closely focused character study\", \"May December\" is galvanised by these \"tremendous\" central performances, said Geoffrey Macnab in The Independent. There are points when it comes across as \"trashy and voyeuristic\", but it goes to places that \"more conventional dramas wouldn't dare go near\". I found it mainly \"creepy\" and depressing, said Michael O'Sullivan in The Washington Post. The more we get to know Gracie, the clearer it becomes that her actions have left \"a trail littered with broken people\". In the end, the whole thing \"just feels really, really sad\".\n\nDream Scenario\n\nComedy/Action ****\n\nIn \"the right mood and in the right film\", Nicolas Cage can be brilliant, said Matthew Bond in The Mail on Sunday. And he's \"on absolutely top form\" in \"Dream Scenario\", in which he appears (almost unrecognisably) as Paul, \"an ageing professor of evolutionary biology\" whose students are bored by him and whose teenage daughters are embarrassed by him. Balding, bearded and dressed in \"ill-fitting dad gear\", Paul couldn't be \"less prepossessing\" – until, that is, \"people start dreaming about him\". First it's one of his daughters, then an ex-girlfriend, then nearly everyone on the planet. He doesn't do much in their dreams – he might be raking leaves, or just hanging around in the background – but his ubiquity grants him celebrity; and soon, people around Paul (and Paul himself) are rushing to cash in. This is a \"high concept comedy in the tradition\" of \"Groundhog Day\" and \"The Truman Show\"; and though it \"struggles to sustain the joke\" for 100 minutes, Cage is superb, and nicely supported by a cast that includes Julianne Nicholson and Michael Cera.\n\nCage \"has never turned in a boring performance\", and he is \"grippingly not-boring playing this boring man\", to whom he gives \"vulnerability and soul\", said Deborah Ross in The Spectator. The rest of the film is not as good as its star, and it rather unravels in the last third; but it's mostly entertaining, and it made me laugh. \"Silly, strange and very funny\", \"Dream Scenario\" is a \"psychocomic drama with a peak Cage Renaissance performance powering it\", said John Nugent in Empire. As the dreams people are having about Paul morph into nightmares, the film also turns into \"a lightly existential look at paranoia and fear, and how that is wrapped up in our uncontrolled subconscious\".\n\nAnatomy of a Fall\n\nDrama *****\n\nIn this \"sinuous\" French drama, the \"phenomenal\" Sandra Hüller plays an author accused of murdering her husband, said Wendy Ide in The Observer. Aspiring writer Samuel (Samuel Theis) has fallen, jumped or been shoved out of a third-floor window at his and Sandra's chalet in the Alps. When an inquest fails to rule out the possibility of foul play, Sandra finds herself on trial for murder, and in court the \"flaws and faultlines\" in her relationship with Samuel are teased out. \"Perhaps more than most genres, the courtroom drama succeeds or fails on the strength of its screenplay.\" And the \"layered and rewardingly intricate script\" co-written by director Justine Triet and her husband Arthur Harari ensures that \"this solid, unshowy film\" keeps you guessing to the end. It's a \"restlessly dynamic and compulsively watchable\" film that rarely loosens its \"throttling\" grip.\n\n\"Anatomy of a Fall\" won the Palme d'Or at Cannes this year, and though \"industry prizes aren't always much guide\", the bauble was well deserved in this case, said Danny Leigh in the Financial Times. With clear nods to Alfred Hitchcock, Triet has crafted a \"top-drawer thriller\" whose ambiguity \"makes us doubt the clean lines of other crime dramas\". A word of warning, however: with its dissection of \"the raw, sad details of married life\", the film could prove an uncomfortable choice for couples on \"date night\". It's an \"intellectual thriller of rare calibre\", and assembled \"so precisely\" that it \"takes your breath away\", said Tim Robey in The Daily Telegraph. Hüller proves Triet's \"perfect accomplice\", and Milo Machado Graner, who plays Sandra's blind 11-year-old son, also turns in a remarkable performance. You'll be thinking about this \"enthralling\" film \"for days\".\n\nThe Marvels\n\nSuperhero **\n\nWhen I told a friend I was off to see \"The Marvels\", \"she thought I meant a Motown girl group on a reunion tour\", said Brian Viner in the Daily Mail. \"If only.\" What I was actually seeing was the \"33rd salvo from the Marvel Cinematic Universe\", a notional sequel to 2019's \"Captain Marvel\", with \"girl power\" the central theme. Iman Vellani plays Kamala Khan, a schoolgirl from New Jersey \"who happens to have superpowers, much to the amazement of her parents\". They are even more startled when Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) and her protégée Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) pitch up at the family home, and whisk Kamala off to engage in a space battle with an evil alien played (\"rather politely\") by Zawe Ashton. The \"decidedly perfunctory plot\" is driven by urgent cries such as: \"It seems the surge has had some residual effect on the jump point!\" – lines that left me \"floundering\", but seemed to make perfect sense to the audience at Cineworld in Leicester Square.\n\nThis is the shortest MCU film so far, yet somehow it is also \"the most interminable\", said Robbie Collin in The Daily Telegraph. Only those who know their Marvel lore back to front will be able to make sense of the plot, which ties five Marvel sub-franchises into the sort of knot you might find on the string of a kite that has just been retrieved from the attic. \"'Higher, further, faster' ran the original Captain Marvel's rousing tagline. 'Have we reached the bottom yet?' would be an apt one for this.\" Well, I found the film pacy and fun, said Helen O'Hara in Empire. No, it doesn't have \"the overwhelming impact\" of, say, \"Guardians 3\", \"but this is the MCU back on fast, funny form\".\n\nHow To Have Sex\n\nDrama ****\n\n\"The six years or so since the #MeToo movement began in earnest\" have seen quite a number of films about \"predatory men and vulnerable women\", said Brian Viner in the Daily Mail. But most of them have avoided the \"tangled complexities\" of real relationships, as if for fear that any nuance might undermine their message. \"How To Have Sex\" \"doesn't fall into that trap\", to the \"great credit\" of first-time writer-director Molly Manning Walker. Her film follows three 16-year-old girls who head off to a resort in Crete to celebrate the end of their GCSEs. There's lots of drinking and vomiting in toilets, but our focus is on Tara (Mia McKenna-Bruce), the least worldly of the three. Her friends urge her to lose her virginity, and when she is chatted up by a Yorkshire lad who is staying in her hotel, she doesn't say \"No\" to sex; but she certainly doesn't encourage it, let alone initiate it. This is a \"powerful\" film about teenage behaviour, all the more so because \"it doesn't preach, it just tells\".\n\n\"Be warned,\" said Tom Shone in The Sunday Times: \"the first 40 minutes of this film are a rhino charge of hormonal hysteria that will have most parents of teenagers running to lock themselves in the nearest wardrobe.\" But for all its \"shrieking dialogue and pounding sound\", it turns out to be a \"superb\" and \"amazingly subtle\" film. The story at the heart of this \"gut-punch debut\" may be ordinary, said Clarisse Loughrey in The Independent, but \"Walker and her talented young cast know exactly how to tell it, down to each micro-expression\". The starkest moment of all comes when Tara walks back to her hotel \"after a very bad night\". The streets are silent and dirty; her cheeks are red and puffy. \"And yet, even with no one around, she still won't fully allow herself to cry.\"\n\nFingernails\n\nDrama ***\n\n\"A tender love story is placed atop a contrived and quirkified sci-fi premise\" in \"Fingernails\", said Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian. Directed by Christos Nikou, the film is set in a future world – or alternative present or \"even an alternative recent past, judging from the roll-film cameras and landline phone use\" – in which couples can take a test at the \"Love Institute\" to find out whether or not they are fully compatible. Among those to have taken the test is Hannah (Jessie Buckley), a teacher who is in a \"committed if unexciting relationship\" with Ryan (The Bear's Jeremy Allen White). When Hannah gets a job at the institute, however, she finds herself falling for scientist Amir (Riz Ahmed), a \"sensitive\" new recruit who is brimming with \"novel ideas\" about love. The sci-fi set-up is rather wobbly, but \"the intelligence and delicacy of the acting\" keeps the film \"steady\".\n\nBuckley turns in a \"terrific\" performance, as always, said Wendy Ide in The Observer; but perhaps she gives the film \"more emotional potency\" than it warrants. And though it is \"drolly amusing up to a point\", it leaves unanswered the \"key question\" as to why couples submit to having this bizarre test in the first place. It's true that there is a \"carefully scaffolded weirdness\" at the heart of this film, said Robbie Collin in The Daily Telegraph; but the romance that unfolds between Hannah and Amir \"feels entirely real and recognisable\", thanks to the actors' \"adorable and gorgeously interwound performances\". (The way Hannah looks at Amir while he dances to Frankie Valli at an office party is \"worth watching the film for alone\".) \"Fingernails\" is also \"wonderfully astute\" on the unruliness of love: \"it wants you to both delight in and despair of it, and have fun doing both\".\n\nNyad\n\nBiopic ***\n\nDiana Nyad is barely known in this country, but in America she's famous as the long-distance swimmer who retired, became a writer and journalist, \"then went back to marathon swimming at the age of 60\", said Matthew Bond in The Mail on Sunday. This biopic charts her 2013 attempt to swim the \"110 shark- and jellyfish-infested miles from Cuba to Florida\" – a feat she'd failed to achieve 30 years earlier. Annette Bening is \"sensationally good\" as the \"intense and often downright unlikeable\" swimmer, and Jodie Foster is \"every bit her match\" as Nyad's best friend, former girlfriend and coach. The film does go on for rather too long, but it's a \"great story\".\n\nDirected by Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi (the duo behind \"Free Solo\"), the biopic \"chronicles the intensive training, failures, internal struggles and breathtaking physical setbacks\" that Nyad came up against in the 2010s, said Ann Hornaday in The Washington Post. The directors do a \"magnificent job\" of plunging us into Nyad's world, \"where wind, water, weather and sea creatures take on urgently outsize stakes\". And even if you know how it will end, the film is surprisingly suspenseful. Thanks in large part to Foster's \"loose, likeable\" performance, Nyad's theme of \"women pulling together\" just about lands, said Tim Robey in The Daily Telegraph. But I found Bening too one-note: she has none of the \"irony or empathetic twinkle\" that she has when she's on peak form, and exudes instead \"Force-10 frosty disdain\". It's also the case that the film's message, \"You're never too old!\", is \"awfully trite\".\n\nThe Killer\n\nThriller/Crime ***\n\nAdapted from a French graphic novel, David Fincher's \"The Killer\" is \"a hitman revenge thriller pared down to its steeliest essentials\", said Robbie Collin in The Daily Telegraph. Michael Fassbender is the blankly malevolent killer, a man with multiple aliases who takes pride in accounting \"for every possible twist and turn in his work\". But then he messes up a job in Paris – \"the wrong blood sprays the walls, the wrong body drops to the floor\". All hell breaks loose, and a \"globe-trotting revenge spree\" is set in motion. \"Much of the pleasure of the film is in procedure: watching someone work diligently and knowledgeably towards a goal that just happens to be murder.\" But a \"darkly fun tension emerges\" too, between its antihero's principles (\"Anticipate, don't improvise\" is one of his mantras) and his behaviour when he is under pressure.\n\nThis is a \"slick and entertaining\" film, filled with \"killing, fighting and torturing\" plus the odd joke, said Michael O'Sullivan in The Washington Post. It is also \"eminently watchable\", especially when Tilda Swinton pops up (\"all too briefly\") to play a rival assassin. Still, you do wonder what the point of it is. The film cleaves closely to a familiar genre: it's less a \"diamond than a piece of good-looking but cheap quartz\", all \"sparkling surface and not much value\". It's true: this \"hard, nasty\" film \"isn't about very much except the pantherish glide of its images, the thrill of staying ahead of the game and – perhaps above all – the multiple uses for a nail gun\", said Tom Shone in The Sunday Times. But it has \"irresistible force\": this is a \"bullet-fast piece of filmmaking\" that \"hijacks your nervous system for two hours before releasing you, pleasantly exhausted, into the cool night air\".\n\nCat Person\n\nDrama/Thriller ***\n\nIn 2017, a short story called \"Cat Person\" by the then little-known writer Kristen Roupenian was published in The New Yorker and went viral, said Laura Venning in Empire. \"Short fiction doesn't tend to be trendy, but this story, about a college student's brief, unsettling relationship with an older man\", struck a chord with young women who were looking at their sexual experiences anew in the light of the \"headline-dominating #MeToo movement\". Now, \"perhaps inevitably\", we have \"Cat Person\" the film, and it's just not very good. Emilia Jones plays Margot, a 20-year-old student who meets Robert (Nicholas Braun in \"Succession\"), a 33-year-old movie buff, at the cinema where she works. He charms her by text, but when they go on a date, he proves \"uncommunicative, stiff and embarrassingly obsessed with Harrison Ford\". Adapting the 7,000-word story, which is light on plot, \"was always going to be tricky\"; and though the film contains some \"wry observations\", director Susanna Fogel leans too heavily into the horror of the tale, making it something of a melodrama.\n\nThe first 40 minutes of this \"botched adaptation\" are pretty good, said Kevin Maher in The Times. Then, with the source story juiced of its content, the film \"shifts from the realm of \"Promising Young Woman\" and \"I May Destroy You\" into actual bloody, tacky, killer-thriller territory\". At this point, it feels as if the film has creatively thrown in the towel, and it \"bombs\". Some viewers may find the change of mood too abrupt, said Matthew Bond in The Mail on Sunday, but what unfolds towards the end seemed \"all too plausible\" to me. And thanks to \"fine performances from Jones and Braun\", as well as some \"well-judged pacing from Fogel\", the film is \"powerfully watchable\".\n\nDoctor Jekyll\n\nHorror/Drama **\n\n\"Of all the screen adaptations of Robert Louis Stevenson's famous 1886 novella, 'Doctor Jekyll' is one of the stranger ones,\" said Brian Viner in the Daily Mail. Eddie Izzard stars as \"a scarlet-lipsticked billionaire recluse\" called Dr Nina Jekyll, who lives in a vast, isolated mansion and has a \"psychotic alter ego: Rachel Hyde\". Nina needs a carer, so she hires Robert (Scott Chambers), a young guy fresh out of prison, to make sure she takes the drugs she needs to survive. Chambers turns in a good and believable performance, but the same cannot be said, alas, of Izzard, who \"works hard enough but always seems to be play-acting\". Even \"the fine actress Lindsay Duncan\", who appears as \"the Mrs Danvers-style estate manager\", is \"more than a little hammy\". Still, that hamminess is not entirely out of place, as this film, directed by Joe Stephenson, \"marks the rebirth\" of the venerable Hammer production company, following a major investment by the \"aptly named\" tycoon John Gore.\n\n\"The potential for something ripe, OTT and amusingly derelict, in true Hammer tradition, was right here,\" said Tim Robey in The Daily Telegraph. But the script of this \"low-budget Britflick\" idles when it ought to build, \"then hurriedly cashes in its chips at the end\". It is also irritatingly hard to tell Jekyll and Hyde apart, \"beyond the fact that one chain-smokes and darts devilish glances a little more intently than the other\". I am afraid I found the film truly \"lamentable\", said Wendy Ide in The Observer. Izzard \"gurns and preens\" throughout, and the whole thing comes across as \"unforgivably lazy\", a film \"that feels as though it was written in crayon and edited with an axe\".\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nCrime/Drama ****\n\nAt the age of 80, Martin Scorsese has produced one of his most significant films to date, said Matthew Bond in The Mail on Sunday, and it is an extraordinary achievement, featuring \"compelling performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, with the lesser-known Lily Gladstone quietly proving every bit their equal\". There is a \"modest downside\" for UK audiences, which is that it's about a relatively small chapter in early 20th century US history that will be unfamiliar to most viewers here; and the film is \"three-and-a-half buttock-numbing hours long\". But don't let that put you off: this is a \"spectacular-looking picture\" about the \"depths that human nature can descend to when vast wealth beckons\".\n\nAdapted from David Grann's bestselling book, the film is about the murders of members of the Native American Osage tribe who, by the 1920s, had become the richest people in the world, owing to the discovery of oil under their reservation, said Deborah Ross in The Spectator. De Niro plays a sinister rancher who has befriended the Osage, and poses as their benefactor, while secretly plotting to kill them and steal their wealth. As part of this plan, he persuades his \"dumb schmuck\" nephew (DiCaprio) to woo an Osage tribeswoman (Gladstone) who has rights to the oil revenue. Although troubled by the way her people are dying of mysterious illnesses, she marries him; but eventually, news of the mounting body count reaches Washington, which sends an officer to the area (Jesse Plemons) from its newly created Bureau of Investigation (later the FBI). The film drags a bit in the middle, but \"the performances are gripping\", and the cinematography is \"lush\". It also builds a world so engrossing that when I came out of the cinema, \"it was weird to see a Superdrug and Costa Coffee rather than dusty tracks and horses and vast landscapes beset by oil derricks\".\n\nI love Scorsese, and \"most of his movies\", said Kevin Maher in The Times: but this film \"does not, to say the least, always work\". The last hour is \"an absolute dirge\", and the characters are locked \"in a death spiral of repetition, where they meet, state their aims, re-meet, re-state and re-meet again, several times... until the closing credits roll\". \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" is \"not a whodunnit, still less a why-do-it\", said Brian Viner in the Daily Mail. Nor is it really a thriller. What it is, is a \"masterly\" (but admittedly long) example of storytelling by one of cinema's greatest directors, with \"an unexpectedly cheeky conclusion\" that will send you away \"with a smile\".\n\nThe Pigeon Tunnel\n\nDocumentary ****\n\nErrol Morris's documentaries \"have got to the heart of figures ranging from Stephen Hawking to Donald Rumsfeld, but in John le Carré he has found a subject as unknowable as he is eloquent\", said Jake Kerridge in The Daily Telegraph. The spy novelist, who died in 2020, explains that he cannot help the people who \"want to unmask me\", because to do that, \"I [would] need to know what is behind the mask\".\n\nThe film intersperses interviews with le Carré (real name David Cornwell) with archival material, clips from screen adaptations of his work, and dramatised scenes from his life, said Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian. And though Morris's interview technique is \"deferential and unthreatening\", he shows that \"the simple spectacle of clever people talking on camera\" can be as gripping \"as any thriller\". One does wish that Morris had pushed le Carré a bit harder to talk about certain subjects (the snobbery he faced within the literary establishment, for instance). But even if the result is not very revelatory, it is \"a very civilised experience\".\n\nA \"cautious, playful portrait of an expert manipulator\", \"The Pigeon Tunnel\" is worth seeing whether or not you have read any of le Carré's books, said Jeannette Catsoulis in The New York Times. And though its subject is \"disappointingly\" reluctant to discuss his colourful sex life, he seems more than willing to bare psychological wounds. \"Of particular poignancy is his fear that human beings have no centre, that what he calls our 'inmost room' is empty, and the things we seek mere chimeras.\"\n\nFoe\n\nSci-fi **\n\nThis \"solemn\" sci-fi film imagines the year 2065 on an Earth devastated by climate change, said Robbie Collin in The Daily Telegraph. Hen (Saoirse Ronan) and her husband Junior (Paul Mescal) are scraping by on a farm in America, when Hen is told that Junior has been selected to be sent to a space station that will house humans once this planet has become uninhabitable. Hen, meanwhile, will be given an AI-powered clone of her husband to keep her company. The film spins a \"convincing\" dystopia, but you do long \"for a bit of incident to liven things up\". It doesn't help that Hen and Junior have one of those marriages that \"don't exist outside of films like this one, where conversation is only ever crisp and intense, and typically conducted with a faraway look on a peeling veranda\", while the wind plays with both parties' fringes.\n\n\"Foe\" is essentially \"three people sitting in a small, nondescript house, talking and asking questions\", said Hamish MacBain in the Evening Standard. And though it does have a twist, it's not a very good one. \"I'm not an especially intelligent man, and even I saw it coming about 40 minutes in.\" The film is \"too reliant on mood over ideas – a parched sand-and-dust colour palette; lots of despairing, sweat-glistening sex scenes\" – to add much to the already long list of films about the \"human/robot intersection\", said Wendy Ide in The Observer. Still, the two leads \"are captivating\".\n\nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\n\nConcert/Musical ****\n\nThe last time we saw Taylor Swift on the big screen, she was being \"unceremoniously pushed under a moving vehicle\" in Amsterdam, said Ian Freer in Empire. \"The time before that was the actual car crash that is 'Cats'.\" Now, the singer is back on screen, but this time on \"home turf\" – in \"an extravagant big-ass concert flick spanning her entire career\". In Swift's words, her (ongoing) Eras tour distils \"17 years of music, one era at a time\". The film, by director Sam Wrench, was shot over three nights at a stadium in LA, and it captures the tour's impressive stagecraft \"slickly, if impersonally\"; there are also \"endless cutaways to fans mouthing lyrics\". But really, \"the best reason to see 'The Eras Tour' is to marvel at Swift\" herself. This film is both a \"showcase and celebration\" of her \"smart songwriting\", her \"boundless creativity\" and her willingness to go \"the extra mile\" for her audience. Best of all, \"you don't have to wait hours to get out of the car park\" afterwards.\n\nTo get the most out of this film, said Ann Hornaday in The Washington Post, \"it's best simply to surrender to the whole thing\": the sparkly cowboy hats, the friendship bracelets, \"the screaming\". True, Swift's dance moves are limited mostly to posing, strutting and pointing, and after nearly three hours, the uninitiated \"might be struck by the repetitiveness of her music\" – but the cumulative effect is \"nothing short of astonishing\". I took my 13-year-old daughter along, having failed to get her tickets to Swift's tour, said Serena Davies in The Daily Telegraph. In the end, it was me, not her, who cried in my cinema seat, overwhelmed by the spectacle. Yet as I put her to bed, I asked if the film had been as good as she'd hoped. \"'Oh even better,' came the breathless reply into her pillow.\"\n\nThe Miracle Club\n\nComedy/drama **\n\n\"Set in an impoverished Dublin suburb in 1967, where the men are either dolts or drunks or both\", and only the women get things done, \"The Miracle Club\" seems to be trying to be \"The Sort of Film they Just Don't Make Any More\", said Matthew Bond in The Mail on Sunday. Sadly, somewhere along its \"cliché-strewn way\", this comedy-drama becomes \"the sort of film they really shouldn't make any more\". Laura Linney plays a woman returning to Ireland for her mother's funeral, having emigrated to America 40 years earlier under unexplained circumstances. Her arrival ruffles the feathers of her mother's old friends (Maggie Smith and Kathy Bates); but each has problems, and soon they've all piled into a charabanc for a trip to Lourdes in search of miracles. \"Secrets eventually tumble out\", and they're \"pretty much exactly what you expect them to be\", in a film that is underwritten and irritatingly full of lingering shots of characters \"staring wistfully into the middle distance\".\n\n\"We've had blackface, Jewface and gayface controversies\", said Kevin Maher in The Times; now it seems reasonable to accuse some of this \"painfully hackneyed\" film's stars – Smith and Bates in particular – of \"indulging in Paddyface\". The \"cringeworthy caricatures\" they serve up are not helped by a screenplay that feels as if it has been \"spewed out by a malfunctioning AI\" programmed with the terms \"Oireland\", \"unwanted pregnancy\", \"church\" and \"the craic\". The film is, admittedly, \"predictable\" and \"sentimental\", and the accents do \"veer back and forth across both the Atlantic and the Irish Sea\", said Brian Viner in the Daily Mail. But it's a \"gentle enough\" ride, and \"we should all enjoy the great Dame Maggie while we can\".\n\nDalíland\n\nBiopic/Drama ***\n\n“How do you create a revealing and intimate portrait of someone who is forever playing a self-created role?” That is the problem that writer-director Mary Harron wrestles with, not entirely successfully, in this film about Salvador Dalí, said Wendy Ide in The Observer. It argues that the surrealist’s persona was “as much an artistic creation as any of his paintings”, which is all very well, but it doesn’t give Ben Kingsley, in the central role, “much to get his teeth into”. Our guide in the film is a fictional gallery assistant, James (Christopher Briney), who “experiences” Dalí “as one might a piece of interactive theatre”; and who is told about him by members of his inner circle. But Harron wrongly assumes James is an interesting character in his own right, and spends too much time on him. The film has some merits: Barbara Sukowa is “excellent” as Dalí’s “berating, goading” wife Gala, and the cinematography is undoubtedly handsome, but overall, it feels like a “missed opportunity”.\n\nThe film doesn’t contain any of Dalí’s work (presumably for copyright reasons), but it “paints an evocative portrait of the cult of celebrity”, and benefits from some good soundtrack choices, said Terry Staunton in Radio Times. The film's portrait of the circus that surrounded the artist in the 1970s is a bit “predictable”, said Manohla Dargis in The New York Times: there are ostrich boas, “writhing bodies” and “a great deal of tawdry art-world shenanigans”. But it is interesting on the subject of Dalí’s marriage to the domineering, money-grubbing Gala. Their relationship mystified people at the time, and here, their scenes together are both entertaining and rather fascinating.\n\nThe Great Escaper\n\nDrama ****\n\n\"I had been quietly dreading seeing how the real-life story of D-Day veteran Bernard Jordan, who 'ran away' from his retirement home in Hove to join the ceremonies marking the 70th anniversary of the Allied landings in 2014\", had been dramatised, said Matthew Bond in The Mail on Sunday. Given the title, it seemed destined for \"the full comic-caper treatment\". But I needn't have worried. Yes, \"The Great Escaper\" has \"moments of gentle comedy, but for the most part it is serious, touching\" and really quite moving. Michael Caine plays Jordan, the 89-year-old who embarks on his pilgrimage to Normandy, leaving his wife of 70 years, Irene (the late Glenda Jackson, in her final role) at home. \"With Caine getting better and better as the film goes on\", what ensues is \"a quiet reflection on both the glories of war and the waste\".\n\nCaine manages to be simultaneously droll and lugubrious, as he shuffles \"up and down the seafront, grumpily denouncing the trendy cyclists almost running him over on the pavement as 'tossers' and letting the air out of their tyres\", said Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian. But he is \"arguably upstaged by Jackson\", who is \"sarky and sardonic to everyone\" in her vicinity, including her carer (the \"excellent\" Danielle Vitalis). The film \"never lurches into clunky sentimentality, and whenever it looks as if it might, Caine and Jackson pull it back\", said Brian Viner in the Daily Mail. And though I have some quibbles about the plot – an encounter between Bernie and a more recent veteran, who lost a leg in Afghanistan, doesn't really convince, for instance – it's a \"joy\" to find these fine actors showing that you can be \"as old as the hills yet still at the top of your game\".\n\nBlackBerry\n\nDrama ****\n\n\"This darkly funny drama about the rise and collapse of the BlackBerry smartphone\" is focused on a handful of eccentric engineers in Ontario \"who were ill-equipped to deal with a multibillion-dollar communications boom\", said Kevin Maher in The Times. Written and directed by Matt Johnson (who also stars as the company's dishevelled co-founder Douglas Fregin), the film is a \"decade-spanning dash\" that begins in 1996 with BlackBerry starting up, and finishes with the company being comprehensively outsmarted by Steve Jobs and his iPhone. Johnson \"is ruthless in his depiction of the business reality behind the glossy surface waffle of the tech dream\", showing that from its inception, \"the smartphone revolution was only ever about one thing – monetising minutes\".\n\n\"By any standard, the BlackBerry story is a wild ride,\" said Wendy Ide in The Observer. The phone began as a prototype \"cobbled together from bits of a pocket calculator\", became a product \"so addictive that it was nicknamed the CrackBerry\" – and was then so roundly outshone, it sank into \"virtual oblivion\". Johnson tells this \"boom-and-bust, crash-and-burn\" narrative with \"dry humour and nervy energy\", and skilfully mines the comic potential of the collision of personalities at the company. In a year crowded with \"product biopics\", such as the Nike film \"Air\", \"BlackBerry\" offers something rather different: \"tragedy\", said Johnny Oleksinski in the New York Post. Like Romeo and Juliet, the BlackBerry is fated to die from the very beginning. \"The road to ruin, though, is a geeky good time – a 'Revenge of the Nerds' without college sex jokes, but with billions of dollars at stake and a groundbreaking invention that still affects much of the planet every day.\"\n\nGolda\n\nBiopic **\n\n\"Caked beneath layers of prosthetics and shrouded in cigarette smoke\", Helen Mirren is \"unrecognisable\" in \"Golda\", a narrow-focus biopic of Golda Meir, the prime minister of Israel from 1969 to 1974, said Alistair Harkness in The Scotsman. The film is set against the backdrop of the Yom Kippur War of 1973, \"in which Israel suffered huge casualties after Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack on the Jewish holy day\". The 19-day war itself \"plays out mostly in audio montages of the ongoing carnage and in close-up reaction shots of Mirren's eyes\", as Meir strategises with her generals, strong-arms Henry Kissinger (Liev Schreiber) and witnesses her staff processing the loss of their sons in the fighting. Unfortunately, the film \"struggles to bring the complexities\" of this tumultuous period to life, and feels rather \"stultifying\".\n\n\"An inspired phrase-maker, a phenomenal organiser, a patriotic socialist who, as Labour minister, had practically created Israel's welfare state, Meir makes an inviting subject for a biopic,\" said Dan Hitchens in The Spectator. So it's a shame to find the real Golda's waspishness replaced in this film \"by a gloom so all-enveloping, she makes Gordon Brown look like Harry Hill\". Nor does anyone else, alas, inject much-needed \"dynamism\". It takes a while to get used to Mirren's \"lumpy facial prosthetics\", said Tim Robey in The Daily Telegraph, but she gives a \"focused and impassioned\" performance, and although the film has some of the \"stodginess\" of a made-for-TV movie (it looks drab and the staging is uneven), \"it has a business-like running time\", which it does not waste.\n\nThe Creator\n\nSci-fi thriller ****\n\n\"From Tom Cruise's enemy in Mission: Impossible 7 to the recent actors' and writers' strikes, there's one baddie dominating Hollywood right now and that's artificial intelligence,\" said Larushka Ivan-Zadeh in the Daily Mail. The latest film to tackle the subject is \"The Creator\", \"a smart and truly spectacular-looking sci-fi action thriller\" set in the year 2070, where the bright future that AI promised has resulted in humanity's near extinction. When a nuclear bomb flattens Los Angeles, \"the West\", led by the United States, vows to eradicate AI. The East, however, refuses to follow suit, so America begins a war – not against \"New Asia\" itself, but the AI it harbours. Caught up in all this is Joshua (John David Washington), an American soldier whose wife (Gemma Chan) is the daughter of an AI mastermind. Plot-wise, the film follows a familiar pattern, but the \"AI world\" it conjures is \"vividly plausible\" and \"often breathtaking\". This is one to \"catch in the cinema if you can\".\n\n\"'The Creator' belongs to an endangered species, in that it's a Hollywood science-fiction epic that isn't based on a video game, a comic or a film you've seen already,\" said Nicholas Barber on BBC Culture. And though it does bring to mind other films (\"Blade Runner\", \"Star Wars\"), it has its own \"sombre mood\" and \"grimy look\". It strikes a smart balance, too, between \"escapist blockbuster fun and downbeat war-is-hell naturalism\". I wasn't convinced by Washington's \"shouty\" performance, or by a plot that requires highly trained soldiers to do stupid things, said Matthew Bond in The Mail on Sunday. But this is \"a well-paced and entertaining watch and does at least have the courage to ask one big, if unfashionable question\": in the battle between humans and AI, who are the \"good guys\"?\n\nThe Old Oak\n\nDrama ***\n\nKen Loach's latest film – which he says will be his last – is a \"sunny romcom set in Paris in the spring\", said Deborah Ross in The Spectator. Only joking: it's a story about Syrian refugees arriving in a former mining village in the Northeast of England, \"where the skies are permanently grim\". Their reception is hostile, but local pub landlord T.J. Ballantyne (Dave Turner) strikes up a friendship with Yara (Ebla Mari), a young photographer whose prized camera has been smashed by racist thugs. The plot revolves around the Old Oak's unused back room. T.J. won't loan it to his regulars because they want to hold anti-immigration meetings there. Instead he turns it into a community dining room. As you'd expect, this is \"a compassionate film that is respectful all round\", but it's also \"heavy-handed, soapy and sentimental\", with a redemptive ending that is as \"simplistic as it is soppy\".\n\n\"The Old Oak\" completes a trilogy Loach has made in the Northeast, and is sadly \"the weakest of the three\" – not for what it has to say but for \"the way it goes about saying it\", said Tim Robey in The Daily Telegraph. The film often seems to be merely \"running down a checklist of problems besetting working-class northerners, and not so much dramatising these as asking its locally sourced cast to recite them as a litany\". The script is a \"freight train chugging through with its issues\", burdening Yara with scant personality and getting Turner to exclaim \"Bastards!\" so often \"it borders on parody\". Shot in a \"simple daylit fashion\", \"The Old Oak\" is mercifully free of the \"cynical twang\" that is currently de rigueur, said Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian. If it really proves to be Loach's last film, he has \"concluded with a ringing statement of faith in compassion for the oppressed\".\n\nFair Play\n\nErotic thriller ***\n\n\"There's something bracingly modern yet deliberately old-fashioned\" about this Netflix thriller set in the world of Manhattan high finance, said Kevin Maher in The Times. Phoebe Dynevor plays Emily, an analyst at a hedge fund whose secret romance with her colleague Luke (Alden Ehrenreich) is destabilised when she is promoted to a job that had been earmarked for him. With his alpha-male status under pressure, Luke loses interest in sex and starts following an online \"manosphere\" guru who preaches the importance of \"reclaiming your narrative\". Casting Ehrenreich, who's come to be seen as the \"beta Harrison Ford\" thanks to his turn in \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\", was ingenious, as he retains \"some of that entitled Han Solo swagger even as his character falls badly and brilliantly to pieces\"; but Dynevor, too, \"takes her character to extraordinary places\".\n\n\"Fair Play\" offers \"a smart modern update to those wince-inducing erotic office thrillers from the 1990s starring Demi Moore, Michael Douglas and a floppy disc\", said Tom Shone in The Sunday Times. But though there is \"immense fun\" to be had in watching Emily and Luke's affair turn sour, the \"flame-throwing psychodrama of the final act\" is less entertaining. The director, Chloe Domont, \"sets up a chess match, then overturns the board\". The film \"makes a plausible sell of hedge fund life\", said Danny Leigh in the FT, and Domont nails \"the markers of status across all workplaces: the money, yes, but also that certain glow that comes with being inside the meeting room that matters\". The lesson here is plain: \"a power couple is only ever as strong as its weakest member\".\n\nThe Lesson\n\nThriller ***\n\n\"No one is quite what they seem\" in this \"winking literary mystery\", said Jeannette Catsoulis in The New York Times. Richard E. Grant plays J.M. Sinclair, a fêted but fading British author who lives with his inscrutable French art-curator wife (Julie Delpy) on a \"swanky\" country estate. The couple are harbouring \"coldly destructive secrets\" – but it is the \"seemingly innocent arrival\" of Liam (Daryl McCormack), a young tutor hired to coach the couple's teenage son through the Oxford entrance exam, which really \"causes ripples in the family's strained dynamic\". Grant is \"magnificent\" as the \"cruel, past-his-prime genius\"; and Delpy is \"so coolly, seductively enigmatic that at least one of Liam's assignments is immediately predictable\". Yet it is McCormack (\"Good Luck to You\", \"Leo Grande\") who most \"intrigues\", gaining a trust he doesn't deserve, and spying on the family's most intimate moments while concealing his own \"obsession\" with Sinclair. With an atmosphere \"as chilly as the lake\" in the grounds, the film unfolds with a \"slow accretion of menace\".\n\nIn debut director Alice Troughton's \"study of discomfort\", conversations \"stutter awkwardly\", and \"passive aggression\" seeps into everything, said Dan Jolin in Time Out. Unfortunately, this overload of unease makes it hard to warm to the film, classy as it is. \"The Lesson\" is made with \"good taste in both actors and influences\", said Ellen E. Jones in the Evening Standard: you'll spot \"some Hitchcock here, some Patricia Highsmith there\". But its \"pastiche of a rarefied, literary world\" never convinces, while Grant is largely reduced to \"hackneyed pseudo-wit\". In the end, \"like many an Oxford undergrad\", this psychological thriller isn't quite \"as enchantingly clever as it thinks it is\".\n\nFlora and Son\n\nMusical/Drama ***\n\nThe Irish writer-director John Carney was behind the musical smashes \"Sing Street\" and \"Once\", said Kevin Maher in The Times. Now he's back in Dublin's \"hard-knock inner city\" with \"yet another movie about singing your way out of heartache, poverty and prejudice\". Eve Hewson (Bono's daughter, in her first major film lead) is \"furiously charismatic\" as Flora, a spiky single mother struggling with her rebellious teenage son (newcomer Orén Kinlan). When she finds a guitar in a skip, she tries to persuade him to take an interest; he refuses lessons, however, so she takes them up herself, and forms an \"unlikely bond over FaceTime\" with her online tutor, a \"smooth-talking Los Angeleno\" (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). They embark on a long-distance flirtation, and play and sing songs (co-written by Carney) that are \"quietly moving for the promise of hope and release they offer\".\n\nI was \"mostly charmed\" by \"Flora and Son\", said Benjamin Lee in The Guardian. Carney remains an \"unashamedly earnest sentimentalist\", but even the \"hardest of viewers\" will be won over by Hewson's \"star-cementing performance\", and by this story about a woman who finds not only love through music, but also a \"renewed sense of self\" and a way to \"reconnect\" with her son. Alas, for me it didn't stack up, said Nicholas Barber on The Wrap. The \"sentimental romance with an American dreamboat\" sits uneasily with the \"sharp-tongued urban grittiness\" elsewhere in the film. But the real problem is that there is just too much going on: with so many \"underused characters\" and \"unfinished storylines\", it feels as though Carney was trying to squeeze \"two or three films into one\". The upshot is a musical drama that seems more \"scrappy demo tape\" than \"polished album\".\n\nDumb Money\n\nDrama/Comedy ***\n\n\"Dumb Money\" is a \"lively\" retelling of the GameStop stock craze, when a \"motley collection of small-time investors\" delivered an \"emphatic poke in the eye to the Wall Street elite\", said Wendy Ide in The Observer. Paul Dano plays Keith Gill, the \"nerdy\" YouTuber who put it about that GameStop, a struggling chain of US video-game stores, was undervalued. Money poured in, massively inflating the stock's value with \"brutal consequences\" for the billion-dollar hedge funds who'd bet against it. In the hands of director Craig Gillespie (\"I, Tonya\"), the story becomes a \"ripped-from-the-headlines docufiction\", which \"corrals\" a host of characters and plotlines into a \"triumph-of-the-underdog narrative\"– while ignoring the fact that it resulted in \"little in the way of real and lasting change\".\n\n\"Dumb Money\" shows \"what happens when the little guys have had enough\", said Tom Shone in The Sunday Times. Based on Ben Mezrich's book \"The Antisocial Network\", it presents the \"manchild\" Gill as an \"unlikely Robin Hood figure\" to his online followers. And there's \"no doubting\" that the villains are the fat cats. \"Dumb Money\" is indebted to earlier corporate dramas \"The Social Network\" (2010) and \"The Big Short\" (2015), but unlike them it ends up \"satirically toothless\" because it is \"peddling a phoney idea\", said Tim Robey in The Daily Telegraph. We're meant to see this as an example of individual strivers joining together and \"sticking it to the man\"; but what happened was closer to a \"dog-eat-dog scenario\", and many of the little people were among the losers. As a result, the film ends up feeling \"distinctly strained, and more depressing than it quite knows\".\n\nA Haunting in Venice\n\nMystery/Crime **\n\n\"Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot is back,\" said Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian, for Kenneth Branagh's third attempt (after \"Murder on the Orient Express\" and \"Death on the Nile\") to coax a \"gold-effect egg from that plump goose which is the Agatha Christie estate\". This time, the detective is in \"genial retirement\" in postwar Venice, where a bestselling mystery author (Tina Fey) persuades him to attend a Halloween séance conducted by a famous psychic (Michelle Yeoh). The inevitable \"horrible events ensue\", and as the body count rises, a host of \"biggish-to-big names\" (including Jamie Dornan and Camille Cottin) fall under suspicion. Branagh has shaken things up a bit, by giving this film a \"tougher, nastier, horror-ish feel\". But as with the first two in the series, a sense of \"trudging inertia\" soon sets in; and while Branagh himself brings a \"level of sprightly energy\" to proceedings, other cast members seem to be \"phoning it in\" for the pay cheque.\n\nThe real mystery, said Deborah Ross in The Spectator, is why an actor-director as acclaimed as Branagh keeps churning out these films, when each one is \"worse than the last\". In this case, his first mistake was to set the film in Venice – all rain and carnival masks – although \"Hallowe'en Party\", the novel on which it is based, takes place in an English village. In the book, \"blackmail, infidelity and murder\" erupt in a specifically English, humdrum world, said Kevin Maher in The Times, \"furnishing Christie with a biting commentary on repressed social norms\". By shifting the location, screenwriter Michael Green can offer \"nothing but clichés and derivative horror movie tropes\" as the story plods dutifully towards Poirot's usual, but this time \"strangely perfunctory\", concluding monologue.\n\nBrother\n\nDrama ***\n\nThis \"broodingly touching\" drama from Canadian writer-director Clement Virgo reminded me of the 2017 Oscar-winner \"Moonlight\", said Mark Kermode in The Observer. Like that film, Brother (adapted from the novel by David Chariandy) is a gritty \"coming-of-age tale\" featuring \"dreamy, meditative visuals\" and built around \"disparate timeframes and temporal lapses\". The story focuses on two siblings, Michael and Francis, \"brilliantly played\" by Lamar Johnson and Aaron Pierre. We first meet them as teenagers in their hometown of Scarborough, Ontario, then dip in and out of their troubled lives as they endure \"police brutality, gang violence and financial peril\". The brothers inhabit a hard world, but Virgo (who directed episodes of \"The Wire\") does a fine job in \"confounding our expectations of macho masculinity\", and delving beneath the characters' \"street-tough exterior\". Indeed, it is the \"more intimate elements\" that drive the drama; and the boys' Jamaican-Canadian mother (Marsha Stephanie Blake) features in some of the \"most powerfully affecting moments\".\n\n\"Brother\" is \"stunningly shot\", said Kevin Maher in The Times, and contains some \"fine performances\". But its \"plethora of structural devices\" can't overcome an \"inherent dramatic flimsiness\". One problem is that the ending is revealed in the first act, which undercuts the tension and makes the film drag, as it \"treads narrative water, via flashbacks, cross-cuts\" and \"side stories\". It might also benefit from \"fewer plaintive cellos\", said Ryan Gilbey in The Guardian, and \"more sparing use of atmospheric slow-motion\". But in its textured portrait of black masculinity, Brother is an example of \"strengths outnumbering flaws\".\n\nCassandro\n\nBiopic ***\n\nIn the macho world of Mexican wrestling, exóticos are male fighters who compete in drag, said Cath Clarke in The Guardian. Most are straight – but this \"heartfelt\" drama is based on the real-life story of Saúl Armendáriz, better known as Cassandro, an openly gay exótico who shot to fame in the 1990s. The film gives \"Gael García Bernal his best role in years\". As Saúl, Bernal is \"funny, infectiously upbeat, sometimes vulnerable\", and radiates the \"magnetism that made him a world cinema It-boy in the '00s\". Some of the homophobia Saúl endures is just \"grim\", and you do wonder if the speed with which he conquers crowds is quite plausible, but by focusing on Saúl's passion for his sport, his determination to be himself, and the unconditional love he gets from his mother (Perla de la Rosa), director Roger Ross Williams has produced a film that is \"undeniably heart-warming\".\n\n\"This is not your typical triumphant sports movie,\" said Helen O'Hara in Empire. Yes, Cassandro wins over the crowds, but he can't solve all the problems he and his mother face. The prospect of \"rejection and even violence\" continues to haunt them, and the film makes it clear that there's still \"enormous hostility\" in Mexico towards this gay icon. Even so, Cassandro is \"a determinedly by-the-book biopic\", said Tom Shone in The Sunday Times, complete with the predictable \"oh no, he's blowing it\" segment and inevitable \"comeback finale. Yawn.\" But, ultimately, it doesn't matter, because the world of lucha libre wrestling \"is so perfectly balanced between the macho and the camp\", and because Bernal's performance is such a treat.\n\nPast Lives\n\nRomance/Drama *****\n\n\"Sometimes in cinema, a director emerges with a first film and just, well, nails it,\" said Kevin Maher in The Times. Often they will be people who have honed their skills in the theatre: think Sam Mendes (\"American Beauty\") and Orson Welles (\"Citizen Kane\"). \"To that list we now must add Celine Song,\" a Korean-born, New York-based playwright who has delivered \"one of the finest films of the year so far\". \"Past Lives\" is a \"Brief Encounter\"-style \"heartbreaker\" about an \"inevitable and yet impossible love\". Greta Lee plays Nora, a Seoul-born playwright who is living in New York with her husband (John Magaro) when her childhood friend, Hae Sung (Teo Yoo), \"comes crashing adorably yet painfully back into her world\". The film then jumps back in time to when Nora and Hae Sung are 12-year-olds in Korea, and vow to marry one day – but are separated when Nora emigrates with her parents to Canada. \"Stylistically flawless\", the film is about \"accepting loss and pain, and realising, in the words of Thomas Wolfe, that you can't go home again. It's a film, in short, about putting away childish things\", which is why, perhaps, \"it has the saddest ending of any film\" since \"Toy Story 3\".\n\n\"Past Lives\" is an \"immigrant story, with Nora bisected between two cultures\", said Larushka Ivan-Zadeh in the Daily Mail. Yet its themes – destiny and \"the pull of a past self\" – are universal; and above all, it is a romance \"so aching it left me with a painful lump in my throat\". There isn't much to the film, \"plot-wise\", said Deborah Ross in The Spectator. But it is \"exquisitely affecting\", and \"made with great precision and care\". As for the performances, they are \"delicate and gorgeous\". In sum: \"there is nothing that shouts in 'Past Lives', but there is certainly plenty to shout about\".\n\nA Life on the Farm\n\nDocumentary ***\n\nThis \"charming\" documentary exhumes the \"extraordinary home movies\" made by the late Charles Carson, a farmer who lived in the \"fabulously named\" parish of Huish Champflower in Somerset, said Ed Potton in The Times. \"An English eccentric of exceptional vintage\", Carson – who filmed himself as well as life on his farm – \"is relentlessly upbeat\", whether delivering a calf or presenting its \"pulsating afterbirth to the camera\". Things do get quite dark: at one point, he transports his dead mother around his fields in a wheelchair, so that the cows can pay their final respects. But the film is not only made up of this footage. Director Oscar Harding also explores how Carson became a \"cult hero\" within a subculture of Americans who enjoy strange video content, after his films ended up online. It is, in the end, quite \"touching\" to see their appreciation \"for a man who channelled his grief and loneliness into nuggets of homespun surreality\".\n\n\"Too much is made\" of the story of how Carson's tapes came to light, said Ellen E. Jones in The Observer, \"but the footage itself is delightful, ranging from 'Countryfile' banalities to macabre surrealism\". Oh look, you think: \"a cute kitty curled up by the fireside! Oh no, wait... is it mummified?\" It's a pity that \"English reserve\" seems to have prevented Harding from truly plumbing Carson's depths; but whoever he was, \"he certainly was a talented outsider artist, one whose work fully justifies the attention this film bestows\". The film is an \"odd mix\", said Donald Clarke in The Irish Times: \"larkish segments\" sit awkwardly with sober contributions from talking heads, for instance. But for the most part, this is a \"warm-hearted celebration of an oddity for the ages\".\n\nEl Conde\n\nHorror/Satire ***\n\n\"Pablo Larraín is fast becoming cinema's foremost purveyor of cockeyed biopics,\" said Raphael Abraham in the Financial Times. Joining \"Neruda\", \"Jackie\" and \"Spencer\", there now comes \"El Conde\" (The Count), a \"pitch-black (and white) portrait of Augusto Pinochet that imagines the Chilean dictator as a 250-year-old bloodsucker\". Jaime Vadell plays the \"aged capitán-general\", whom we first meet \"occupying a ramshackle building in barren surroundings that suggest moral ruin and abandonment\". A flashback to Louis XVI's Paris reveals his origins, the screen erupting in violence as he takes a sledgehammer to a sex worker's face, then licks Marie Antoinette's blood off a guillotine. Later, he settles in South America, marrying Lucía Hiriart (Gloria Münchmeyer), a woman \"even more perverse and unscrupulous\" than he is. The film's \"irony-dripping narration\" is provided by Pinochet's \"bosom buddy\" Margaret Thatcher (Stella Gonet). The film is full of \"striking\" images, but as a skewering of a monstrous figure, \"it's not quite a stake through the heart\".\n\nThis \"boisterously macabre\" and deeply violent horror-satire is \"entertaining in a 'Spitting Image' way\", and is powerful both at the beginning and at the end, said Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian. But it is weighed down by a \"clotted central section\", and feels a bit \"one-note\". \"For such a dark tale, it's played curiously lightly, the tone leaning towards quirk as much as anything,\" said John Nugent in Empire. Still, as \"an old-fashioned horror in an arthouse cape\" it works perfectly well, and it's \"funnier and more entertaining than might be expected\".\n\nPassages\n\nDrama ****\n\n“Full of explicit sex and raw emotions”, “Passages” finds the American director Ira Sachs “back on form” after his disappointing drama “Frankie”, said Alistair Harkness in The Scotsman. Set in Paris, the film stars the sensational Franz Rogowski as Tomas, “a bad-boy German filmmaker” whose determination to control his personal life “with the same dictatorial authority he displays on set” is challenged when he embarks on a “lusty” affair with a teacher named Agathe (Adèle Exarchopoulos). Tomas is in a “somewhat open” same-sex marriage with mild-mannered designer Martin (Ben Whishaw), but this latest infidelity leads Martin to break up with him, sending Tomas into a tailspin. Part of what’s great about Sachs’s films is that “he never judges his characters”: Tomas, for instance, is toxic but also funny and childlike; you leave suspecting that his “biggest victim is himself”. “Passages” is “great like that”: “awkward and truthful and alive to the chaos of real life”.\n\nThis sometimes graphic depiction of a ménage à trois is not for “shrinking violets”, said the Daily Mail. What Sachs has produced is “an intimate, effortlessly well-acted adult drama that prickles with sexual chemistry, even if the story doesn’t amount to much more than ‘beware le narcissist’”. “As a portrait of artistic monstrosity”, it would “make a great double bill with Tár,” said Danny Leigh in the FT. It confers “the uncomfortable feeling of being drawn into the orbit of the beast”, owing to the “glinting magnetism” that Rogowski bestows on his character. But Sachs wisely doesn’t allow Rogowski to dominate: Whishaw is also given the space to excel “as the deceptively steely Martin”, and Exarchopoulos “is brilliant as the not quite wary-enough Agathe”.\n\nMaigret\n\nCrime/Mystery ***\n\n“Georges Simenon’s lugubrious detective Maigret has appeared in umpteen screen adaptations” and been played by dozens of actors, said Deborah Ross in The Spectator. “Now, it’s Gérard Depardieu’s turn”, and though he isn’t “quite how I imagined Maigret” – he moves “more cumbersomely, like a sad circus bear” – he might “be the best so far”. Based on the 1954 novel “Maigret and the Dead Girl”, the film begins, inevitably, with a body: that of a young woman who has been stabbed and left on the street, with no hint as to her identity other than “the label in her evening dress”. It falls to Maigret to unravel the mystery. “Minimal and melancholic”, the film is shrouded in literal gloom – “I don’t think any lightbulb runs to more than five watts” – and Maigret seems suitably depleted (and mercifully free of the PTSD, flashbacks and nagging wives that dog modern fictional detectives).\n\n“At 74, Depardieu is surely a couple of decades older than the usual Maigret,” said Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian. “He is also a rather stately and well-nourished figure – when his doctor asks him if he feels tired in the medical check-up scene at the beginning of this film, Maigret actually answers: ‘Sometimes … when running for a bus.’ Running for a bus? Any film that actually had a scene of Depardieu running for a bus would deserve every special effects award going.” Still, he brings his trademark “watchful presence” to the film, which has the feel of a “feature-length Sunday-night TV drama”, and is enjoyable enough. I’m afraid I found the adaptation very disappointing, said Kevin Maher in The Times. The murder case is totally lacking in twists and turns; Depardieu, now so “controversial offscreen, remains charismatic on it”, but not “charismatic enough” to save this film.\n\nThe Equalizer 3\n\nAction/Thriller ***\n\nIn 2014, “The Equalizer” introduced to us “the world’s most dangerous guy: a trained killer who’s convinced he’d also make a great life coach”, said Clarisse Loughrey in The Independent. Former intelligence officer Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) “can both politely coerce you into swapping fast food for salads and butcher the Russian mobsters on your back”. Now, McCall (first played in a TV series by Edward Woodward in the 1980s) is back in a film that is “about as good” as the first one, and much better than the second. The plot follows McCall as he rocks up to an Italian town, which turns out to be crawling with “Mafia types” who are plotting to drive the locals out of their homes so that they can turn the area into a tourist resort. McCall, of course, “can’t abide nice people being bothered”, so he starts breaking a few arms and skulls (“Eat. Pray. Murder”). Director Antoine Fuqua makes the most of his “Roman Catholic fever-dream rendering of Italy”, and Washington, in “full movie star mode”, shows he can command attention even when sitting “perfectly still”.\n\n“For those who can tolerate – or better yet, relish – extreme violence, ‘The Equalizer 3’ is diverting enough,” said Kyle Smith in The Wall Street Journal. Though the script is “so-so”, the score, beautiful Italian locations and Washington’s “still-world-class charm” lift it “(slightly) above average for the action-thriller genre”. At heart, this is “an old-fashioned western, where the good guy rides into town to protect the citizens”, said Matthew Bond in The Mail on Sunday. “It does all get a bit formulaic on the last lap, but if this is the end of the franchise”, as it’s billed, it’s going out on a good note.\n\nScrapper\n\nDrama/Comedy ****\n\nThere’s a “tender sweetness” to British filmmaker Charlotte Regan’s debut feature, about “a fragile father-daughter relationship”, said Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian. Newcomer Lola Campbell plays Georgie, a 12-year-old who is living by herself in a council house in east London following the death of her single mum. She pays the bills by nicking bikes with her friend Ali (Alin Uzun), and tells the social services, whenever they remember to check in on her, that she’s being looked after by an uncle called “Winston Churchill”. This precarious existence is upended, however, by the arrival of Jason (Harris Dickinson), who announces that he is her father – and who makes it clear that he wants to be a part of her life. The film isn’t “quite as humanly complex as it might have been”: the educational and welfare authorities are “cartoonishly callous and gullible”, for instance. “But the gentleness of the connection” between Jason and Georgie gives it real warmth.\n\nFor a film about a working-class kid who has to fend for herself, “Scrapper” is – remarkably – neither “an earnestly grim wrist-slitter” nor “an indictment of modern Britain with no shred of hope”, said Deborah Ross in The Spectator. “It’s not even desaturated and grimy.” “Scrapper” is colourful, tender, gloriously short (at 84 minutes), and contains some “magical” performances. Dickinson “exudes a dozy vulnerability” as Jason, while Campbell and Uzun are terrific: “fresh, naturalistic, winning”. I also “fell in love” with this “spunky British indie”, said Larushka Ivan-Zadeh in the Daily Mail. Without ever teetering into twee, it proves that “a grief story set on an east London council estate” needn’t be “grey and miserabilist”. You may cry, but “you will laugh harder”.\n\nTheater Camp\n\nComedy ****\n\n“Part laugh-out-loud satire, part life-affirming love letter to amateur dramatics”, Molly Gordon and Nick Lieberman’s “brilliant” mockumentary depicts life in a children’s theatre camp in upstate New York, said Ed Potton in The Times. The punningly named “AdirondACTS” is the kind of place where the kids are “explosively overexcited, the teachers say things like, ‘We know how to turn cardboard into gold’, and the cars have bumper stickers reading, ‘Mom... Dad... I’m a thespian’.” When the camp’s founder Joan (Amy Sedaris) goes into a coma after a strobe-induced seizure, her clueless son Troy (Jimmy Tatro) takes over, to the consternation of Joan’s “stalwart staff”. But the show goes on as the camp leaders – an “impeccably observed collection of oddballs and frustrated performers” – throw themselves into writing and producing the annual end-of-camp musical. “There are moments of fabulous inappropriateness”, but the filmmakers clearly “have huge affection for this world”. Having laughed throughout, “you’ll leave the cinema feeling moved, too”.\n\n“Theater Camp” is “a kind of film we haven’t seen much of recently: a very, very funny one”, said Robbie Collin in The Daily Telegraph. It isn’t “an action comedy, or horror comedy, or superhero film with jokes” – just “a comedy comedy”, and it made me laugh so much “I slid out of my seat”. I’m not sure the mockumentary framing does the film any favours, said Donald Clarke in The Irish Times – “there are too many cameras” and close-ups, and no one acknowledges the presence of a crew. But this is a mere “quibble”. This is a “rollicking, endlessly good-natured” film, packed with jokes and buoyed by the cast’s “chutzpah”.\n\nThe Blackening\n\nHorror/Comedy ***\n\n“The Blackening” is “a horror spoof that comments ironically on chillers” such as “The Cabin in the Woods” and the “Scream” series, which were themselves “self-reflexive genre commentaries”. What makes Tim Story’s film different, said Jonathan Romney in the FT, “is that it’s about blackness – specifically, about the status of black characters in American horror, and the fact that, in slasher pics, they are so often the first to get slashed”. The story follows seven college friends who are taking part in a reunion in a secluded cabin in a wood, where they come upon a sinister board game called The Blackening. In it, a grinning, talking head challenges them to play – “which involves answering quiz questions on black American history, culture and pop trivia” – or die. In order to survive, the friends end up having to decide who in the room is “the blackest”. The comedy is raucous, pithy and “liberally spiked with one-liners”, even if, “as an extended joke about the predictability of the genre”, “The Blackening” “can’t help being predictable” itself.\n\nSome of the pop culture references “might go over the average viewer’s head”, said Dulcie Pearce in The Sun, but there are more than enough jokes and hijinks to make up for it. The characters are all “highly aware of what not to do in horror movies”, which makes for a rich source of “laugh-out-loud moments”. Horror purists might find this film rather short on “genuine scares”, said Wendy Ide in The Observer. “But go into it expecting a hang-out comedy with a few jumps rather than a horror movie with a few jokes, and it’s unlikely to disappoint.”\n\nStrays\n\nComedy ***\n\n“At its best, this crude comedy does for dog movies what ‘Bad Santa’ did for Christmas films” – it drags them through the gutter and rolls them in filth, “sometimes literally”, said Ed Potton in The Times. “Strays” is “unlike anything else in cinemas at the moment”. It’s “a live-action film featuring real but CGI-embellished dogs, in which Will Ferrell voices our hero”, a naive border terrier called Reggie who adores his owner Doug (Will Forte). Doug, sadly, is an “abusive, bong-smoking, masturbating slob, whose preferred names for Reggie are Shitbag and F**knugget”. When Reggie presents Doug’s girlfriend with a pair of knickers that belong to another woman, Doug abandons him in an inner-city neighbourhood, where he falls in with a bunch of other strays, and has his “doggy eyes opened, big time”. The film “demands a high tolerance for swearing, knob gags and bodily fluids”, and at its worst, it’s “lamely unfunny”. Even so, the moments of hilarity “outnumber the rubbish ones”, and Reggie’s eventual revenge against Doug makes for a “finale for the ages”.\n\n“The makers of ‘Strays’ seem to have set out to make the filthiest, raunchiest talking-animal movie in Hollywood history, and it would be difficult to argue that they failed,” said Kyle Smith in The Wall Street Journal. Yet though it is “wildly inappropriate”, it’s also miles funnier “than almost everything I’ve seen from the Hollywood comedy establishment lately”. Based on the poster showing two cute dogs, I’d assumed ‘Strays’ was a tame “kiddie film”, said Deborah Ross in The Spectator. But within minutes I was thinking: “Christ on a bike, what the hell is this?” Be in no doubt: this is a “rude, offensive and disgusting” movie. But it’s also great fun – and even, in the end, “rather touching”.\n\nLie with Me\n\nDrama ***\n\nThis “tasteful” French drama is based on a bestselling autobiographical novel by Philippe Besson that has been dubbed the “French Brokeback Mountain”, said Cath Clarke in The Guardian. The story follows novelist Stéphane (Guillaume de Tonquédec) as he returns to his home town for the first time in 35 years. Growing up gay in provincial France, Stéphane couldn’t wait to escape. Now he’s back, being paid by a cognac brand to speak at an event. In the audience is the company’s marketing executive, Lucas (Victor Belmondo), who turns out to be the son of Stéphane’s long-lost first love. In flashback sequences set decades before, we see how that love unfolded, between gawky young Stéphane and “babe-magnet” Thomas (Julien De Saint Jean), who makes Stéphane promise to keep their relationship a secret. There is “a sensual feel” to the film’s depiction of young love, even if the themes of “shame and internalised homophobia” are familiar.\n\n“The striking widescreen cinematography gives an impression of generous scope and openness,” said Wendy Ide in The Observer. “But in fact, like Stéphane himself, the storytelling is oddly insular and fussy. The highlight here is a supporting character: the long-suffering event organiser Gaëlle, played by Guilaine Londez with a huge, over-stretched smile and the kind of clenched-jawed positivity that seems to teeter on the brink of psychosis.” “Lie With Me” is, in essence, “quite a conventional, small-scale French movie”, said David Sexton in The New Statesman. But it’s “wildly romantic”, and director Olivier Peyon has neatly compressed the original book’s “complex narrative”\n\nBlue Beetle\n\nSuperhero **\n\n“Blue Beetle” is “a likeable, if predictable” superhero film “that at no point invokes time travel, the multiverse or a ginormous portal in the sky”, said Clarisse Loughrey in The Independent. “And thank god for that.” Directed by the Puerto Rican filmmaker Ángel Manuel Soto, it stars Xolo Maridueña as Jaime, a young Latino graduate who returns from college to discover “that his relatives have been shielding their bright, promising spark from a few dispiriting truths”. His father, for one thing, has had a heart attack and lost his shop; for another, the family home is about to be repossessed by a corporation run by Susan Sarandon’s evil industrialist. Soon, however, Jaime gets his hands on her secret weapon: an intergalactic scarab beetle that burrows into his body and lends him “bug-like armour”, as well as assorted superpowers. The film isn’t, in truth, “all that remarkable”, but there is “something pleasantly nostalgic about its straightforwardness”, a throwback to the earlier days of the genre, when characters and emotions “had room to breathe”.\n\nSeeing Jaime and his family switch unthinkingly between English and Spanish shouldn’t be “one of the most startling things that’s ever happened in a superhero movie” – but it is, said Peter Hoskins in the Daily Mail. It’s just a shame that the family scenes cede to humdrum superhero-movie fare: so we have the insipid love interest, the baddie with a plan, and the “big CGI scrap” at the end. I found the film “powerfully boring”, said Tim Robey in The Daily Telegraph. It’s hard to chalk it up as a win for Latino representation when Jaime’s family “are cut from the Disney-ish cloth” of the clans from “Coco” and “Encanto”; and the middle drags. If you’ve “an ounce” of superhero fatigue, steer clear.\n\nL'immensità\n\nDrama ****\n\n“Tolstoy famously wrote that while all happy families are alike, each unhappy one is so in its own particular way,” said Robbie Collin in The Daily Telegraph. “This ravishing, velvety melodrama from Italy’s Emanuele Crialese serves as a living illustration of the point.” Set in 1970s Rome, it stars first-time actress Luana Giuliani as an otherworldly teenager, Adriana, who wishes to be acknowledged by the world as a boy named Andrea. Adriana/Andrea’s beautiful Spanish mother Clara is played by Penélope Cruz, “in a thrillingly old-fashioned performance of Sophia Loren-like vivacity”. They live in a “luxuriously appointed modernist apartment”, but Clara’s husband (a “deeply plausible” Vincenzo Amato) “brims with a quiet, nonspecific distaste for his wife and children” that can erupt into violence. Crialese explores the teenager’s shifting identity with “complexity, nuance and psychological honesty”, and though some “magic-realist interludes” are a little “heavy footed”, this is “a sophisticated, searching work”.\n\nInspired by Crialese’s own experience, “L’immensità” is both a “coming-of-age and a coming-of-gender story”, said Jonathan Romney in the Financial Times. It’s anchored by Giuliani’s superb performance: her Adriana/Andrea is a perfect mix of “vulnerability and bolshie sullenness”. As for Cruz, she exudes “radiance” and “magnificence” – even if you do sometimes wish that the film would let her “be less magnificent” and more human. I found that the story failed to “accumulate power” as it went on, said Edward Porter in The Sunday Times. Still, it has lots of “endearing” moments, including a few fantasy sequences set to “blazing Italian pop songs from the period”.\n\nHeart of Stone\n\nMystery ***\n\n“Who watches the watchers?” Who offers covert support to the secret services when they themselves get into scrapes? According to Tom Harper’s “uneven but enjoyable hi-tech espionage action romp”, the answer is “the Charter”, said Wendy Ide in The Observer. This is a shadowy organisation made up of former agents who swoop in to “tidy up” whenever governments and security agencies make “a bit of a mess of things”. A key member of this group is Gal Gadot’s Rachel Stone, who begins the story secretly embedded in a group of British spies (including Jamie Dornan and “Motherland”’s Paul Ready) who are carrying out a mission. Soon enough, however, the Charter itself comes under threat, and Stone must break cover, then zip to various “stunning locations around the world” to save it. “There’s very little that’s original in this Bond-alike adventure”, and the screenplay is mere “scaffolding to support the set pieces”; but “the action is terrific”, with a “screaming, tyre-shredding” car chase around Lisbon a particularly “exhilarating” highlight.\n\n“Heart of Stone” plays “a simple, sturdy game” and plays it well, said Benjamin Lee in The Guardian. Sure, this is “disposable” stuff, and the plot is “total nonsense that barely warrants a first think, let alone a second”. Yet it’s “surprisingly propulsive nonsense, packaged with a studio slickness” one wouldn’t expect from Netflix, whose films so often have a murky, slightly smoky look. The dialogue can be a tad mechanical, said Kevin Maher in The Times: we need a moratorium on protagonists saying, “You got this!” and “I got this!”. But the film builds to a terrific twist, and its action sequences are smartly orchestrated. “If this is the first instalment, count me in for the second.”\n\nRed, White & Royal Blue\n\nRomcom **\n\n“Like a corgi backflipping over a bathtub of champagne, ‘Red, White & Royal Blue’ starts with a giddy premise and has the derring-do to succeed,” said Amy Nicholson in The New York Times. “The setup is thus: Alex (Taylor Zakhar Perez), the wild child of the White House, is tasked with clearing up an international PR disaster by befriending Prince Henry (Nicholas Galitzine), the cloistered British spare.” In the film’s first half, the pair fall in love; in the second, they fret that going public might cause “another global kerfuffle” just as Alex’s mother (Um"
