        "text": "The desire to reexamine traumatic collective memories and histories through personal histories and images of everyday life has motivated some of the most poignant uses of found footage in postwar cinema. The critic J. Hoberman noted this in 1982 when, writing about Bódy’s Private History, he juxtaposed it with other examples drawn from “an international avant-garde,” including “the work of Bruce Conner [and] even more specifically, Ken Jacobs’s 1975 Urban Peasants (an assemblage made from the home-movies of Brooklyn’s Jewish petite bourgeoisie).” Hoberman also suggested that Bódy’s film is a “historical reconstruction . . . anticipating Edgardo Cozarinsky’s evocation of occupied Paris, One Man’s War (1982).\"[4] Another parallel is Stuart Cooper’s Overlord (1975), which combines documentary footage with a fictional narrative to create “both a document of World War II and a dreamlike meditation on human smallness in a large, incomprehensible machine.”"
