[ Whooshing ] >> All three engines up and burning.\n\nTwo, one.\n\nI live in a little camping trailer now.\n\nUsed to have a beautiful house on the river on the St. Johns River.\n\nGorgeous place, beautiful wife.\n\nLost it all.\n\nGot three acres, though.\n\nIt's kind of nice to be out in the middle of nowhere.\n\nFlorida.\n\nThat part I like.\n\nI hear the train at night.\n\nI go outside and watch the rocket launches.\n\n[ Laughs ] Yeah.\n\nLittle different from when I grew up.\n\nWe used to climb a big pine tree to watch the Apollo launches, so...\n\nBut, yeah, I'm in the woods.\n\nIt's where I want to be.\n\nI like it.\n\nIt's what I'm left with.\n\n[ Laughs ] >> Dear God, we thank you for this opportunity again, for this beautiful day to be with you.\n\nDirect our thoughts, direct our steps and direct our words.\n\nWe pray for unity, we pray for peace, and we pray for your love.\n\nIn your name, we ask it.\n\nAmen.\n\n>> Amen.\n\nOkay, good.\n\nThat's good.\n\nThat's good.\n\n>> Oh, another monumental day.\n\n>> All right.\n\n>> It's exciting.\n\nYou want a coffee to go?\n\nIn your little to-go cup?\n\n>> No, I don't think so.\n\nBy the time I get there, I'll be fully awake.\n\n>> Okay.\n\n>> Okay.\n\nI'll just get up to go.\n\nWhen I look back on my life, I think I've had a good life.\n\nAnd the shuttle program was a very exciting part of my overall career.\n\nIt played a crucial role in where I am today.\n\nI'm always optimistic that the future is going to be better than the past.\n\nWelcome to the Harry T. & Harriette V. Moore Memorial Park and Museum.\n\nWe're so very happy to have you here this morning.\n\nMy name is William Gary and I serve as president of the Harry T. & Harriette V. Moore Cultural Complex.\n\nHow many of you all want to be teachers?\n\nHarry and Harriette Moore were teachers.\n\nHarry was concerned about certain inequalities that he saw... >> As we all know, there's always a leader for the time.\n\nAnd you two ended up being the leader for the time.\n\n>> Oh, Bill.\n\n>> Yeah.\n\nWell, you guys did.\n\nAnd these points don't mean anything to me now.\n\n>> I know.\n\nYou get nothing.\n\n>> I'm retired.\n\n>> You get nothing.\n\n>> Ten years ago, that might have been a call and she'd say, \"Let's promote him.\"\n\n>> You know, there's a couple things that I think about when being at the pad.\n\nWhen I was involved, I was the pad leader for Pad B here.\n\nI'd do a final walk-down early in the morning and it felt like the vehicle was alive.\n\nThe xenon lights are shining up, so even when you look out, the lights are shining.\n\nBut just how careful you had to be and how intimidating it was.\n\nAnd the way the vehicle would talk to you.\n\nI mean, just the creaking and high hissing.\n\nAnd standing there and looking up and recognizing what you were a part of -- just that this thing's going to take seven people off the planet.\n\nNot everybody gets to do that.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ >> The most historic step in the history of the space program, in that it gives man, for the first time, the capability of routinely and at a moment's notice, when necessary, of getting to and from space.\n\n♪♪ The space shuttle is important and is the right step in the manned spaceflight and the U.S. space program.\n\n♪♪ First, the shuttle is the only meaningful new space -- manned space program which can be accomplished on a modest budget.\n\nSecond, the space shuttle is needed to make space operations less complex and less costly.\n\n♪♪ Third, the space shuttle is needed to do many useful things.\n\n♪♪ And fourth, the shuttle will encourage greater international cooperation in spaceflight.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ >> You know, a lot of people can't say they did what they loved, and I did.\n\nI never wanted to fly.\n\nDidn't want to be that guy.\n\nI wanted to be the worker, you know?\n\nThat's what my dad was, my mom.\n\nThat's what I wanted to be.\n\n♪♪ >> Growing up around here, it was space.\n\nIt was just neat to ride your bicycle down along the river where everybody was parked for the Apollo launches.\n\nMy mother went to work for McDonnell Douglas.\n\nShe worked her way up to be in charge of human resources.\n\nAnd at the end of the Apollo program, my dad got laid off, and my mother signed his layoff papers.\n\nSo it's in my blood.\n\n[ Laughs ] I went to Brevard Community College, and I took blueprint and machine shop.\n\nWhen I heard they were hiring at the Cape in 1979, I hired in with 352 people.\n\nTwo of us went to spacecraft.\n\nAnd the only reason I got to go is 'cause I had blueprint reading and I was good with my hands.\n\nI did a lot of this and a little bit of this.\n\nYou know?\n\nI listened to the old Apollo guys, followed them around.\n\nI got their coffee, I paid attention, and my boss, within two weeks, he said, \"In five years, you're going to be sitting here running this.\"\n\nAnd he was right.\n\n♪♪ >> I grew up in Philadelphia, Mississippi.\n\nTypical poor Black family.\n\nSegregated, of course.\n\nMy mother, she could read and write.\n\nShe loved to read.\n\nWhen I was four, five years old, she was teaching my cousin, who was a few years older than I, and I would always stand behind and watch her.\n\nSo I learned to read before I ever went to school.\n\nI'd always been fascinated with the stars and constellations in space.\n\nMy school, Tennessee State, had a cooperative education agreement.\n\nThe guy who was the coordinator, he would come around to the engineering classes in particular and try to recruit students to sign up for co-op.\n\nI finally told him, \"If I can work at a space center, I will join the co-op program.\"\n\nSo he said, \"Well, you know, we have an agreement with Kennedy.\n\nWe have an agreement with Huntsville.\"\n\nAnd I didn't want to go to Alabama because in my mind it was worse than Mississippi.\n\n>> Segregation forever.\n\n[ Crowd whooping and cheering ] >> But Florida appealed to me even as a younger person.\n\nMy friends and I, we had often talking about going and jumping on the train and riding all the way to Florida and pick oranges and make some money -- which, you know, it was a dumb idea, but at that time, that seemed like a great adventure there.\n\nThey had a co-op coordinator there at Kennedy who matched us up with other students who had a car so we could get back and forth to the space center after work.\n\n>> You know, I see people that say, you know, early on they saw, you know, the moon landing and, \"I knew that's what I wanted to do.\"\n\nNo, I wasn't sure where I was headed, to be honest with you.\n\n♪♪ My uncle was an electrical engineer for Chrysler, so he started sending pictures home.\n\nHe got the first seven astronauts' autographs, sent them, you know, to little Billy.\n\nHe brought us down.\n\nWe got to see the crawler when it was first manufactured.\n\nIt started to make me realize that this is just incredibly interesting, and it was cutting-edge.\n\nYou know, just like in my generation, my dad's listening to Glenn Miller and Frank Sinatra, and the next thing you know, you got a Led Zeppelin album on, and your dad's like, \"What the hell is that you're listening to?\"\n\nI went to technical school in Pennsylvania, worked for the U.S. Department of Energy on a coal gasification plant that turned coal to natural gas.\n\nAnd that was during the big gas shortage.\n\nPrices were going crazy, lines to get your car filled up.\n\nAnd then Mom's flying to L.A. She meets a guy that works at the Astronaut Office.\n\nNext thing you know, he said, \"We're looking to hire people into the space program.\n\nSo if your son has a technical background, get me his résumé.\"\n\nI'm 22 years old, I come down, I'm sitting in his house, all glass on the water.\n\nHe's got his boat lifted out back.\n\nAnd I'm seeing these fish jump out of the water.\n\n[ Laughs ] I said, \"What are those?\"\n\nHe said, \"Those are dolphins.\"\n\nSo I went from bundled up and, you know, hands freezing, to sunshine, sunglasses, watching girls playing tennis on the tennis court.\n\nI thought, you know, \"I could live here.\"\n\nIt was less money than I was making in Pennsylvania.\n\nBut you could see that the steel mills in Pittsburgh -- my dad saw where it was coming to a stall.\n\nHe said, \"Take the less money.\n\nGo into a program that's starting out like that and look at the opportunities to grow and finish your education.\"\n\n♪♪ >> I first heard about the shuttle through the news, you know, just being here local.\n\nIt was a big deal because the Apollo program had ended.\n\nSo you just knew it was going to be big.\n\n>> My first impression when I saw the configuration of the shuttle is, \"Will this really fly?\"\n\nWas this really going to work?\n\n>> It was hard to get my mind around.\n\nThey had artists' renditions.\n\nIt was explained to me as an airplane the size of a 727.\n\nIt would be strapped to a large fuel tank with two solid rocket motors, which are basically rockets themselves.\n\nIt's going to lift off, as a \"space truck\" perform work in low-Earth orbit.\n\nAnd then it would land like an airplane.\n\nAnd I thought it sounds exciting, but it also sounded far-fetched.\n\n♪♪ >> Late '77, thereabouts, we started going out to Palmdale, where the vehicle was being put together.\n\nWhen I first saw the cockpit, I was totally surprised at how small it was.\n\nIt's about the size of a DC-9.\n\nNot a lot of stand-up room in there.\n\n>> You don't really have a concept of what it looks like until you get right up to it.\n\nBut the first time I saw Columbia was in Palmdale, California.\n\nI was loaned out there to learn the system and to work on it.\n\nIt was way behind schedule, and that's why NASA opted to get it from California and get it down here.\n\nAnd that way we could continue to finish building the orbiter and start testing the systems.\n\n>> All us young people didn't really know what we were signed up for or what this real work environment was going to look like.\n\nSo they kept delaying the delivery out of Palmdale.\n\nThen finally it was close to Easter Sunday, the vehicle was coming.\n\nSo they told all of us to go out to the shuttle landing facility to watch the orbiter come in.\n\nWe looked up.\n\nI mean, your jaw dropped.\n\n747 was the largest commercial aircraft of its time.\n\nAnd then it's got this 100 ton, you know, vehicle mounted on it.\n\nIt wasn't a lot of words, just looking up, trying to gather what we were seeing.\n\nAnd then Deke Slayton, one of the original seven, flew his T-38, and he corkscrewed it down the runway, hit the afterburners and went straight up.\n\nThe 747 lands.\n\nDeke Slayton comes in in front of it with the canopy open, and he's going like that to the crowd.\n\nWe just looked at each other and thought, \"Oh, my God.\"\n\nI think the magnitude of what we were going to be a part of just hit us.\n\nIt was like, \"This is incredible.\"\n\n♪♪ >> When I first saw Columbia, I was an awe.\n\nYou're looking at a spaceship.\n\nAnd then, like that, it's time to go to work.\n\nI was a vehicle test mechanic.\n\nThe first two years, we did a lot.\n\nSeven days a week, 12-hour days.\n\nDidn't know what a weekend was.\n\nI remember one time I had to write what we called an AVO -- Avoid Verbal Orders -- just to take a Saturday off so that me and my buddy could go fishing.\n\nI don't even think we threw the rod in the water.\n\nWe just wanted to go on a boat and be away from work.\n\n♪♪ >> There were a lot of delays, which kind of helped me a little bit because I hadn't gotten out of the service yet.\n\nThe biggest one I remember was the tiles, of course.\n\n♪♪ >> The orbiter sees up to 3,000 degrees on reentry.\n\nDown on the underside and all the areas you see in black are made up of high-temperature, reusable surface insulation -- what everybody commonly refers to as the tile.\n\nThe tile vary in thickness.\n\nIt is extremely fragile, more fragile than an eggshell.\n\nThere are certain places on the underside of the vehicle you could lose one tile and have a catastrophic failure.\n\n>> I think the company that built the shuttle itself, Rockwell, overestimated the simplicity of attaching those tiles and making them work.\n\nThe shuttle was actually shipped here to Kennedy before two tiles were complete on it.\n\nRockwell transferred a bunch of people from California to work on the tiles, and the idea was we're going to be working 24/7, seven days a week, pretty much.\n\nWell, the big joke was, when they discovered Disney was about an hour and a half away, that went out the window.\n\n[ Laughs ] >> We had like 700 tile technicians on first shift.\n\nEverywhere there was an open space on that vehicle, you had a group of tile people.\n\nYou had people in the back shop making tile.\n\nYou had people logging, cataloging.\n\n>> And this was a bunch of people who the year before had been in high school or college, and they didn't know anything about composites and bonding procedures.\n\nAnd we had to teach them what they needed to know because it was not something that you could go outside and learn anywhere.\n\nThere wasn't a school in the country that was teaching these.\n\n>> The tile was made out of silica.\n\nSo the bottom of that tile was sand.\n\nSo as you brushed the room-temperature vulcanizer -- it was a glue -- on, you actually deformed the tile.\n\nAnd when you bonded the tile to the vehicle, you could actually just pull the tile off.\n\nDidn't know that to start with.\n\n>> The design engineers came up with a fix, but the fix required us to remove the tile off of the ship, harden the back of the tile, and reinstall the tile on the ship.\n\nWell, Columbia had almost 32,000 tile.\n\n>> This is a little humorous.\n\nIn the logistics, they all told us we're going to roll out in June.\n\nThey had a calendar and it said, \"January, February, March, April, May, June, June, June, June.\"\n\nYou know, the anticipation was just -- Good Lord, you know, come on.\n\n>> We worked two-and-a-half years on an orbiter that was supposed to be processed through a much shorter period of time.\n\nBut I remember when Columbia rolled out of the OPF, I mean, just my sheer feeling of pride, you know, my part, my small part in processing that vehicle and getting it ready to go, the VAB to be stacked with the tank and the boosters.\n\n♪♪ And then going out finally to the launch pad.\n\n>> All of our manned vehicles before Shuttle, we flew the rockets unmanned several times to make sure they were safe.\n\nWhen we flew the very first space shuttle, Columbia, it had two astronauts in it.\n\nJohn Young and Bob Crippen.\n\n♪♪ >> John Young was legendary.\n\nBob Crippen, I mean, he looked like a movie star.\n\nTheir energy and them coming out and interfacing a little bit with the workforce, providing a little bit of reality to the importance of what we did and how we prepared that spacecraft for them.\n\nThey stayed connected enough with the workforce to make us recognize the importance of what we were about to do and how to do it right.\n\n>> One of my techs come down and he says, \"The strangest thing just happened.\"\n\nHe said, \"Some guy came up there.\n\nHe asked me to explain what I was doing.\n\nHe sat there and talked for over 30 minutes.\"\n\nHe said, \"He looked down at me before he walked away and he said, \"You're building this ship.\n\nWould you fly in it?\"\n\nAnd he said, \"I had to think for a minute.\"\n\nHe said, \"I looked at him and told him, 'Yes, sir, I'd fly in it.'\"\n\nAnd he said, \"Good, 'cause I am,\" and walked off.\n\nAnd that's when he came down to me and he says, \"Who was that?\"\n\nI said, \"That was John Young.\n\nHe's the commander of this first flight.\"\n\nHe was like that.\n\nHe was a very knowledgeable man and he wanted to talk to anybody who would talk to him and answer his questions.\n\n>> You do put yourself in their place.\n\nYeah, they're test pilots.\n\nThey're probably cool as cucumbers.\n\nAnd we were, in the firing room, the ones that are a nervous wreck, just because it was such a complicated machine.\n\nWhen you're in that crew module and you're looking at the thousands of switches, And then you go walking along the vehicle and you're looking at the wiring, miles and miles of wiring -- all this has got to come together.\n\n>> I thought we had done everything we could do to make the vehicle as safe as possible, but it was an untried vehicle.\n\n>> We set a schedule for launch and we kept slipping it out month after month after month after month.\n\nAnd at one point it was almost like, \"Are we ever going to get launched?\"\n\nAnd that was kind of in the midst of the Iranian crisis.\n\nI don't know if you remember that or not.\n\nBut this country at that point probably, some would say, didn't have a lot of positive things to be upbeat about.\n\nSpace shuttle was something that the whole country could get behind and could feel good about as a country.\n\n>> This is shuttle launch control at T-minus two hours, five minutes and holding.\n\nThe astronauts are in the process of putting on their boots, which they will wear during the flight.\n\nThey already have put on their pressure suits.\n\nAstronaut John Young is having his boots adjusted at the present time.\n\nHelping makes sure... >> Dead silence.\n\nDead-quiet environment.\n\nTo be at the C12 DPS console, We had all kinds of software displays that we were monitoring all the equipment on board.\n\nYou make sure they're within their limits.\n\nWhite knuckles.\n\nCounting down.\n\nTen, nine... \"Oh, my gosh, this is gonna happen.\n\nThis is gonna happen.\"\n\nAnd it was such a letdown when the very first day it didn't happen because we had a software issue.\n\nThe primary and the backup software weren't in synch.\n\n>> That was part of my system.\n\nWe reached a point in the count where the computers failed to synch.\n\nIt was like, \"Oh, my God.\n\nWe've never seen this before.\"\n\nWe were already kind of emotional and stomach in knots and that kind of thing.\n\nBut IBM did get it figured out.\n\nAnd on the second attempt, we successfully launched.\n\n>> T-minus ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four.\n\nWe've gone for main engine start.\n\nWe have main engine start.\n\n♪♪ [ Engine roaring ] And we have liftoff for America's first space shuttle.\n\n♪♪ And the shuttle has cleared the tower.\n\n♪♪ >> The moment that it launched, and you're standing wherever you're standing, watching it and you realize, \"I helped do that\"... [ Chuckles ] I can't -- I can't describe that.\n\n>> Seeing it take off, and the roar of the engines and stuff, it -- it's, um...\n\nIt makes you proud.\n\n>> We were jumping up and down, and everybody high-fived back then.\n\nWe were all high-fiving each other and hugging and just -- just total elation.\n\nthat that's the product that we've been working on for two-and-a-half years, and it just cleared the tower.\n\n>> I was a launch team member in the prime firing room, Firing Room 1.\n\nIf you ever see pictures of the post launch, there's me in a white jacket waving an American flag, I mean, just going crazy.\n\nIt was a special time.\n\n>> Of course, we were glued to the monitors, we're watching the monitors, watching everything.\n\nIt's like, \"Okay, there go the solid rocket boosters.\n\nGood, good.\n\nEverything's working.\n\nThere goes the tank.\n\nYes, yes!\n\nOh, my gosh.\"\n\nIt was the coolest experience, but it was very tenseful.\n\nIt was like, \"Oh, my gosh, please, everything work.\"\n\n>> And then you could see that same excitement then when STS-1 landed.\n\nJohn Young came down the stair trot, and he was running around the orbiter like a little kid, pumping his hands up.\n\nI think it took me longer as time went on to recognize the bold courage that those two guys had on a completely new system like that.\n\nBut I was hooked.\n\nI mean, I was absolutely hooked.\n\n♪♪ >> When I started coming down here as a co-op student, they had a co-op coordinator there at Kennedy who helped us find an apartment.\n\nHe had a list of apartments that we could rent at.\n\nEven though this was '68, '69, they were all segregated.\n\nA few years later, I met a young lady.\n\nWe got married, and then one of the things that we wanted to do is buy a house.\n\n>> ♪ You can't stop me now ♪ >> It was on North Carpenter Road, which didn't have any other African-American families out there at that time.\n\nWe didn't give a lot of thought to it because there hadn't been any incidents that I could remember.\n\nHowever, we endured quite a bit of harassment there.\n\n♪♪ After we'd been there a couple of months, people would come by and throw fruit on our roof and against the house.\n\nThey would drive through the yard and mess up our grass and knock over our little decorative figures.\n\nAt that time I was traveling some as part of my job.\n\nMy wife called.\n\nShe was crying and upset because people had been throwing apples and oranges.\n\nShe didn't know, I don't believe, at the time, because it was at night, that they had spray-painted the N-word on the sides of the house.\n\nSo I called the newspaper, and they took pictures of the words and they wrote a big article which appeared in the Sunday paper there on the front page.\n\nAnd that kind of led me into some other city civic activities there, being involved with some advisory boards, getting involved with campaign for mayor.\n\n♪♪ >> When I see all the \"stop hate,\" the focus that we, you know, have a dislike for each other, sometimes I don't understand that because I know most of the folks that I know and people in my family, we don't have that.\n\nI didn't see it.\n\nYou know, it's a team out there.\n\nWorked hand in hand with many African-Americans that are my friends today because they were solid people doing a great job.\n\nThey were competent and -- I didn't see much focus, even at that time, on making any of those determinations that we were different.\n\n>> I had a good relationship.\n\nCharlie Bolden, our first African-American NASA administrator.\n\nWe started together.\n\nHe just grew up to be the boss.\n\n[ Laughs ] But, yeah, he'd knock you out on the way to hug me right now.\n\nSo, you know, we're good friends.\n\nIt might've went on, but I didn't notice it, and I damn sure wasn't a part of it.\n\n♪♪ >> If you think the natural order of things is that you are always at the top, you are the leader, then, yeah, you won't see anything.\n\nWhen I was appointed the facility manager of the operation, the checkout building, people would stick their head in the door.\n\nI would be sitting behind a desk and they would ask, \"Where's the facility manager?\"\n\nThey totally -- it didn't occur to them that you might be that person.\n\n♪♪ >> A lot of the employees, myself included, had a lot of issues with promotion potential, work assignments, receiving awards.\n\nWe had agreed as a group that we were going to file a lawsuit.\n\nBut when it got down to time to file a lawsuit, a lot of them backed out.\n\nSo it was just four of us that volunteered to go through with the lawsuit.\n\nSome people weren't happy about it.\n\nEven though it wasn't against them, you know?\n\nThey just didn't like the idea that they had to testify.\n\nI managed to work through it.\n\nI continued to do my job and didn't let it get me down.\n\nI think the fact that we spoke out and made the agency aware of the fact that we were aware that there was a problem meant a lot.\n\nSome people that I work with, especially some of the ones that came in after me and knew what I had to go through, told me that they were proud and happy that somebody stood up.\n\n>> It took a while for opportunities to come.\n\nIt took a long while.\n\nDo I think the playing field leveled off and things were kumbaya?\n\nNo, I don't.\n\nDo I think that there were instances where people were precluded because they were African-American?\n\nYes, I do.\n\nBut I don't think that it was a harsh, overt effort.\n\nCould more have been done?\n\nYes.\n\nBut there was a lot that was done.\n\n♪♪ >> Bob Crippen, who I consider the best center director I ever worked for, was a person that was totally committed to diversity.\n\nWe went and visited the Black colleges with an engineering degrees.\n\nMet with the engineering people, and we were able to hire quite a few people during that period.\n\nI remember one situation that we was in.\n\nThe EEO office had gotten a lot of applications from Southern University, of engineers to come on co-op.\n\nAt the end of the day, none of the people was hired.\n\nSo Crippen said, \"Why did none of these people get hired?\"\n\nAnd the head of personnel would say, \"Well, the directors and the program managers didn't pick them.\"\n\nAnd Crippen said, \"Well, I think I can hire them.\"\n\nSo it's just commitment and leadership from the top to make it happen.\n\nFortunately, I was in a position to bring on a lot of people, and we did.\n\nWe brought on a lot of women, a lot of minorities.\n\nAnd fortunately, a lot of those folks are at the top of the organization down at Kennedy now.\n\n♪♪ >> I became a safety specialist through a specialty training for entry professionals.\n\nAnd I came into NASA as a clerk typist and just worked myself, you know, right up through the ranks by going to college in the evenings.\n\n>> I have a degree in mathematics and physics from the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, Philippines.\n\nWhen I first started, I think the opportunities for women were not as well publicized then.\n\n>> Any special problems?\n\nI think the answer is yes, I mean, if you're going to be honest.\n\nThere are just not that many women in the professional or scientific field.\n\nSo you find yourself being a minority.\n\n>> Women kind of had to -- we had to work a little harder.\n\nThe management would ask the males first.\n\nAnd it's like, you know, \"Excuse me.\n\nI know that answer too.\"\n\nBut we'd go to a meeting and explain the problem, and, \"Well, all right.\n\nWell, come back with some more information.\"\n\nIt's like, \"Ugh.\"\n\n>> I think it depended on the man and the woman.\n\nI myself am an A-type personality.\n\nSo when somebody threw something sexist at me, they got something back.\n\n[ Laughs ] There were times when I would change a job function, and I did feel like, as a woman, that, \"Okay, when I got to prove myself again that, you know, I have a brain and I know what I'm doing.\"\n\n>> You know, we never got promoted as quick as our counterparts, although we gave 200% and then some.\n\nYou didn't have a lot of female directors.\n\nJoAnn Morgan worked in the launch room.\n\nShe had her challenges, and she was white.\n\nCan you imagine for us that was behind her?\n\n>> JoAnn Morgan's a great mentor.\n\nHer thing was, always rise above it.\n\nEspecially when you're female and a lot of tough challenges are thrown your way, she wouldn't let you come in and kind of cry on her shoulder.\n\n>> When you're a little girl and you want to be an astronaut when you grow up, it's like wanting to be a doctor when you grow up.\n\nYou're told that's not an appropriate goal.\n\nIf I could give any advice to anybody -- and I hate people who give advice -- it would be not to let people tell you what you can't be.\n\nYou have to decide for yourself what it is that you want.\n\nAnd if you want it, really want it badly enough, then you have to make it happen for yourself.\n\n>> Dr. Sullivan leaves us to go to NASA, be one of the first women to enter the training course as an astronaut.\n\nAnd we wish you good success.\n\n[ Applause ] >> In my view, the space program's moving from really a test-flight stage to stage that will involve really all of mankind.\n\nAnd I think it's just a natural expansion to include other segments of the population.\n\n>> I certainly feel that women are here to stay as part of the space program.\n\nYou know, this time all the women selected were selected as mission specialists.\n\nI certainly feel that in future selections with women training as pilots, that there will be women selected as pilots.\n\nI think we're here to stay.\n\n♪♪ >> Here you see Mae Jemison.\n\nMae Jemison will be making her first trip in space today.\n\nJemison is a medical doctor from Chicago.\n\n>> When Mae became an astronaut, I felt like she was very willing to meet people and talk to people.\n\nShe even met my daughters, and they were very excited because it was somebody that looked like them.\n\n♪♪ >> When we finally did get a person of color chosen as one of the astronauts, you begin to think that, you know, we're on the right road here, you know, this is finally beginning to reflect the population of the country and the people of the country.\n\n>> Just to see Black person getting on that shuttle and flying, it kind of inspired me that, you know, I could do anything I wanted to do.\n\nI remember the first astronauts that was Fred Gregory and Guy Bluford.\n\nI remember Fred coming here to Huntsville for one of our outreach days when they would go around and talk to the different schools about being an astronaut.\n\nThat's when I really got to know Fred and, you know, fortunately, Fred and I are frat brothers too, so the Omegas kind of was flying in space, you know?\n\n[ Laughs ] >> I was one of the first Blacks in integrated schools in Washington, D.C., in 1955.\n\nI thought that if I really wanted to do it and I worked hard to do it and prepared myself, that if there were a barrier, it would have to be a big one to stop me.\n\n[ Laughs ] >> When the shuttle made it possible for scientists to be a part of the program as astronauts, then that was my break.\n\nI was interested in just about every subject that came along, but science was the one that gave -- and mathematics were the most challenging, gave me the most difficulty.\n\nAnd I had to work a little harder to sort of understand and master the techniques.\n\nIdentify what you want to do and go straight forward and sort of be willing to sacrifice and ignore these forces that try to limit you and divert your efforts.\n\n>> McNair.\n\nHe was a good friend of mine.\n\nYou think that people that's brilliant, PhDs, would be nerds, but these guys was really outgoing, everyday people, you know?\n\nYou just hate to lose people like that, you know, because they have so much to offer.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ >> You know, I think when you look at the shuttle, it is an amazing, complex piece of equipment.\n\nWhen NASA was selling this to Congress, I realized that they had to have, you know, some vision of its usage, its cost, and so on and so forth.\n\nBut there was no way to really know until they got it into the environment and actually started doing flights.\n\n♪♪ >> The space shuttle program was sold to President Nixon, the Congress, and the American people back then as our routine access to low-Earth orbit.\n\nEconomical, safe.\n\nWe were gonna fly every two weeks.\n\nAnd everything America was going to launch was going to fly on the shuttle.\n\nAnd so there was almost a feeling of the shuttle has to succeed because this is the way the country is headed.\n\n>> There were a lot of things that, in the early days, that went wrong.\n\nA lot of equipment that didn't quite work the way you expected it to.\n\nIt reached the point to where most of us in the space program recognized that that quick turnaround, it just wasn't going to happen because it was such a complex vehicle.\n\n♪♪ >> The shuttle required too much work on the ground before its next mission, which was not truly anticipated when it was designed.\n\nThe feeling when it was designed was that we wouldn't need to to test every system every time and inspect every tile.\n\nWell, we ended up doing that because it was the right thing to do, and that just slowed everything down.\n\nAnd so the promise made of every two weeks just was never going to be.\n\n♪♪ >> I think the best year we had, we had nine flights in a year.\n\nAnd I can't overemphasize the amount of work and the daunting task it takes to get an orbiter ready to go fly, from all the systems that have to be, you know, tested and checked out.\n\nIt got real.\n\nThis schedules got tighter.\n\nThe manifests grew.\n\nThose launch dates are very critical.\n\nYou might have a special short window to be able to get that mission up into space.\n\nIt's not, hey, you almost made it or you got close enough.\n\nI mean, you have a specific launch time frame.\n\n♪♪ >> We were working some pretty long hours because there were some rules that have been put into place, like maximum work time.\n\nI can remember working double shifts.\n\nI can remember testing the vehicle on one shift and testing my software on the next shift.\n\n>> I remember one time there was a special bond job.\n\nI was there 22 hours on double time.\n\nThat's like a whole paycheck in one day.\n\nYou know?\n\nThat was satisfying, but I busted my tail.\n\nAnd people all around were doing that.\n\nIt wasn't just me.\n\nI don't want it to sound like that.\n\nEverybody around was doing that.\n\n>> The need to meet a schedule was true.\n\nI mean, we had different commitments to customers on board the shuttle.\n\nThere was pressure from certain elements within the shuttle program to launch that vehicle.\n\nAnd people that had a say-so didn't want to be the one to scrub a launch.\n\n>> My boss was an astronaut.\n\nHe talked about, as he went through Top Gun school that there's a certain level -- he drew a line -- where you can go, you know, just over the line where performance can be just awesome.\n\nAnd then there's a further point where it could become detrimental.\n\n>> I was never directed and I never directed anybody to do anything that was overly risky.\n\nThat did not happen with me.\n\nAnd I certainly didn't do that with my people.\n\nBut I set a high expectation.\n\n\"Get it done.\"\n\n>> I think our safety was compromised several times, and it was being pushed by the schedule.\n\nAnd corners were cut.\n\nWe lost two guys in the aft section, two workers.\n\nIt was the dress rehearsal day for the astronauts.\n\nThe aft section of the vehicle, where the engines are, was purged was gaseous nitrogen.\n\nYou cannot breathe.\n\nThey were waiting on pad safety to come up and do a O2 check to make sure that it was okay to enter the aft.\n\nManagement kept calling from the telephone in the shop telling them, \"Get your butts in there.\n\nLet's go, let's go.\"\n\nSo they broke the barrier and crawled in, and two breaths, fell over.\n\n♪♪ >> I mean, safety was always built into our culture.\n\nEverybody made sure that we knew the importance of what we did and the impact if we didn't do it right.\n\n>> We practiced worst-case scenario, seven people incapacitated.\n\nSo we could clear the pad in three-and-a-half minutes if we had to.\n\nThat's a lot of responsibility.\n\nYou got people's lives in your hands.\n\nThat's something that you need to take a deep breath and think about, you know?\n\n>> I always thought at the processing level that we were delivering the best vehicle.\n\nAnd we treated the crew like, would you put your mother on there?\n\nWould you fly your sister?\n\nYou know, would you put your wife on there?\n\nYou think about people boarding that -- seven people and getting ready to leave the planet -- and you believe that you didn't do the best you could, or that we did it okay and we hope everything works out -- That was never the case.\n\n>> Good afternoon.\n\nI'd like to introduce to you the commander of STS-51-L, Commander Dick Scobee.\n\n>> As usual, it's a real pleasure to be at the Cape to come down here and participate in something that the Cape does better than anybody in the world, and that's launching space vehicles.\n\n>> I am hoping that the -- the affliction that Steve Hawley had from the 41-day mission, mission specialist, of the delays hasn't rubbed off on me.\n\nAnd I think the guys behind me are hoping that it hasn't also.\n\nOtherwise they might throw me off the flight.\n\n>> The mission is a great mission.\n\nWe're looking forward to it.\n\nAnd I think we're ready to go fly.\n\n>> It's good to be down here and to be flying a vehicle that we know a lot of folks down here have worked very hard on.\n\n>> A great pleasure finally to get this far.\n\nI'm very proud to be part of the program and NASA.\n\n>> We look forward to returning -- launching from the Cape, first of all, and returning here a few days later.\n\n>> I don't think any teacher has ever been more ready to have two lessons in my life.\n\nI've been preparing these since September, and I just hope everybody tunes in on day four now to watch the teacher teaching from space.\n\n♪♪ >> You know, this may sound shallow, but when I look at astronauts, I think they understand the inherent risk in manned spaceflight.\n\nAnd I think they and their families sign up for that risk.\n\n>> This is a risky business.\n\nAnd while the accolades and benefits are great, the way it was configured, there was just no easy, simple way to escape from it.\n\n>> Columbia was designed with an escape system for the two astronauts, just the commander and the pilot.\n\nThe first four missions had escape capability.\n\nThen it was declared operational.\n\nThe escape capability was removed from Columbia because it weighed a lot.\n\nAll the other shuttles that were in design and build at the time weren't even built with that system.\n\nSo it was predetermined that it was going to turn operational very quickly.\n\nWell, \"operational\" is a funny word.\n\nOperational can mean something to you, can mean something different to me.\n\nI will tell you that the shuttle system never turned operational like a Boeing 737 is operational.\n\n>> You always keep in the back of your mind that, yeah, there's no parachutes, there's no ejection system.\n\nWe got to do our job, and we got to do it right.\n\nWe got to make sure every component is working, working well, to launch and land safely.\n\n>> Probably the downside of it is there was so many successful launches there.\n\nIt can be easy to be lulled into, \"This is routine.\"\n\nAnd there's nothing routine about it, really.\n\n>> It was always an experimental vehicle.\n\nIt was always living on the edge of failure every time we launched.\n\n[ Cheers and applause ] >> Unfortunately, I had a real front-row seat to Challenger.\n\nAs you would have it, we scrubbed the day before because we couldn't get the piece of GSE off of the hatch.\n\nThen they recycled to a launch day where the weather was just incredibly bad.\n\nI came in at 3:00 in the morning.\n\nI was supposed to do the final walk-down.\n\nAs I start walking down the pad, I'm freezing.\n\nI mean, I grew up in Pennsylvania.\n\nI've never seen a day like that in Florida.\n\nThe handrails were all covered in ice.\n\nThe serrated gradient that the crew would walk up to the orbiter access arm was all iced over.\n\nSo I did what I thought was right.\n\nI went over to a point-to-point phone on the 195-foot level, and I picked up -- and that rings directly into the control room -- and described what I was seeing.\n\nHe said, \"Okay, let me make a note of that and I'll make sure that the crew gets briefed that they need to be extra careful.\"\n\nI said, \"That wasn't the desired result.\n\nI mean, are we really going to launch?\"\n\nI had a schedule with me.\n\nWe always carried schedules with us, rolled up in our back pocket.\n\nHe said, \"We'll get to this point in the count, and we'll probably recycle.\"\n\n>> At T-minus 7 minutes and 40 seconds.\n\n>> It was a very, very smooth countdown, if you will.\n\n>> T-minus 15 seconds.\n\n>> At that time, I was the supervisor of the DPS system, the onboard computers.\n\nManagement sat in Firing Room 2.\n\nThe launch team sat in Firing Room 1.\n\n>> Sonny Carter was an ASP, that's an astronaut support person.\n\nHe strapped everyone in, and we went back to the launch danger area.\n\nSonny stood next to me, and we watched it lift off.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ >> It was just quiet.\n\nIt was just quiet.\n\nAnd the engineering director said, \"Did anybody see anything?\"\n\nWhat does your data look like?\n\nAnd there was no data.\n\nAnd he said, \"Well, don't move anything.\n\nYou know, leave everything intact.\n\nLeave everything right where it is.\"\n\nAnd, you know, they they let us go home after a bit.\n\nAnd I remember going home and... turned all the lights out.\n\nI had a VCR.\n\nAnd I put an extended tape in the VCR machine and started recording.\n\nI haven't looked at that recording.\n\nThat was a bad day.\n\nThat was a very bad day.\n\n>> Major funding for \"When We Were Shuttle\" is provided by Howmet Aerospace Foundation, investing in STEM education in communities where Howmet operates.\n\nAdditional funding is provided by the Jo Asmundsson Production Fund.\n\nAnd viewers like you.\n\nThank you.\n\n>> I just never worked on anything that had caused such destruction and killed people.\n\nAnd I never thought in my wildest dreams that I'd be part of something that that could happen.\n\nYou know, maybe I wish I'd have been more profound, done something different.\n\nBut I played a role, and it was a very difficult time.\n\n>> One of the hardest things was knowing... knowing the people.\n\nI was friends with Ellison Onizuka.\n\nYou know, I spent a lot of time with him.\n\nI guess I can say we drank beer together.\n\nSo, you know, these are real people, and you get to know them and they're your friends.\n\nThey end up trusting you.\n\nAnd you have to earn that and you have to live up to it and you have to live with that.\n\n>> I remember I took a couple of days off.\n\nI couldn't go back to work right away.\n\nWe'd just sit out on the back porch and think, \"All right, this is what I want to do?\n\nIs this what I want to continue to do?\n\nAre we even going to have a job?\"\n\nWe didn't know if there was going to be a future or not.\n\n>> There was talk at that time that that might be the end of the shuttle program.\n\nThis is not safe.\n\nYou can't make it safe.\n\nIt was that kind of talk coming from some politicians, some media.\n\nMorale was at a low point then.\n\n>> I knew several people that just did not want to continue in that business.\n\nThey thought it was too risky.\n\nThey didn't want to take the chance of it happening again.\n\nThey just did not want to be put in that pressure situation again where they had to launch people in this machine.\n\n>> Ladies and gentlemen, I now would like to call this first meeting of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger accident to order.\n\nThe commission shall investigate the accident to the Space Shuttle Challenger, which occurred on January 28, 1986.\n\nThe commission shall, one, review the circumstances surrounding the accident to establish the probable cause or causes of the accident.\n\nAnd, two, to develop recommendations for corrective or other action based upon the commission's findings and determinations.\n\n>> There was a top-to-bottom review of every system related to the shuttle.\n\n>> All the debris that they collected, they put in a hangar and they tried to kind of piece it together like a puzzle.\n\nEach of the separate departments had to identify that.\n\nIf they found an engine, the guys in the engine department would say, \"Yep, that's the left engine.\"\n\nTile.\n\nThat was a biggie too.\n\nAll the tile.\n\nYou know, the tile folks got to identify where that tile came from and...\n\nIt really was hard.\n\nYou know, before, it was like, \"Yeah, I'm going to work!\n\nI'm working on the shuttle!\n\nThis is so cool.\"\n\nBut that wasn't the attitude after that accident.\n\nIt's like, \"Oh, my gosh, we got to figure out what happened, make sure this never happens again.\"\n\nBecause it was going be a long time before Congress was going to let us fly.\n\n>> This morning, we will start the meeting with officials from NASA, particularly dealing with the matter of seals on the booster rockets.\n\n>> We're particularly concerned for pitting where the O-ring, which are these two black 0.280-diameter devices you see in these grooves here, because a pit, obviously, can provide a path for hot gas to get by the O-ring.\n\n>> When we went through the monthly briefings over at the Office of Space Flight, every month the O-ring problem or O-ring charring problem was on that list.\n\n>> If this material weren't resilient for, say, a second or two, that would be enough to just be a very dangerous situation?\n\n>> Yes, sir.\n\n>> Thank you.\n\n>> The accident had just happened an hour before.\n\nAnd I remember one of my friends in my group said, \"Those damn O-rings.\"\n\nI didn't know what an O-ring was.\n\nI said, \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nHe said, \"Well, we've had problems with these O-rings, and now it finally got us.\"\n\nAnd I thought that was very strange.\n\nAnd now, looking back on that, it just jives so clearly with the failings at the management level.\n\nWe knew that there were problems with the O-rings inside the solid rocket booster.\n\nAbout half of the missions prior to Challenger had a little bit of scorching on the O-ring from the combustion inside.\n\nShould have zero.\n\nThere was a meeting the night before at the engineering level that said, \"We should not launch tomorrow.\"\n\nThe fact that the meeting even had occurred never made it to the launch director, certainly not the results of it.\n\n>> People didn't listen.\n\nAnd we've seen some of that, where people will speak up and because of schedules cost, management says, \"Oh, it'll be all right.\n\nIt's never happened before.\n\nIt'll be all right.\"\n\n>> I think a lot of that got documented in the Rodgers report.\n\nI think they did a really good job of bringing some of the program management aspects to bear.\n\nAnd out of that, a lot of very good changes came.\n\nThere's a big shift in culture.\n\n>> They definitely instilled in us to speak up and not hesitate.\n\nNothing will happen to us.\n\n\"You will not be criticized if you speak up.\n\nYou will not lose your job if you speak up.\n\nIf you think something's not right, if you think there's a problem, if you think we're moving too fast, speak up.\"\n\n>> If that engineer wasn't comfortable with the decision that was made, then they had an appeal route that was put in to the program, an official appeal route to voice their opinion outside of their direct management chain of command.\n\nMight not be acted on the way that engineer wants, but at least it would be heard.\n\nAnd that's something we carried on throughout the remainder of the program.\n\n>> Sometimes what worries me is that, as time goes on, the younger workforce, they haven't experienced this, and the people that learned from those mistakes are no longer with us.\n\nSo my biggest concern is how that stays current in current programs, that people understand the sheer devastation of when you don't get it right.\n\n>> The way it was handled, too, you know, they buried everything

the wing is reinforced carbon/carbon.\n\nThe experts said you can't damage carbon/carbon.\n\nAnd it was easy to believe because there was some times we'd actually hit it with mallets and had not damaged them then.\n\nWe found out after the incident that the reinforced carbon/carbon was getting weaker and weaker the more we flew it.\n\nWe just didn't totally understand it.\n\nWhen the rest of

could make it safer and fly it again.\n\nI was a proponent of reducing the flight rate.\n\nThe concept was keep two shuttles, fly each one only once a year.\n\nBecause, remember, we had astronauts on board the Space Station.\n\nWe had to get crews back and forth and supplies back and forth.\n\nIf we were to shut down the shuttle program, we'd be relying on the Russians, which is what happened.\n\nAnother part of the reason I thought we should fly the shuttle, not just the technical side, was the workforce here.\n\n>> The board has been extremely forthcoming all the way through the

drive the bad cultural traits out of the organization, and it's something they're going to have to buy into personally.\n\nThey're going to have to accept it in their gut, and then, their daily

going to have to drive it out.\n\nIt is not simple.\n\nIt'll take a long time.\n\n♪♪ >> Well, it's not for me to agree or disagree at the level I was at.\n\nI think, in the CAIB report, it found failure in some of the ways that we were doing business.\n\nIt showed that we were able to kind of slip from the Challenger accident back into maybe some less than stellar behavior or decision making that made the program much riskier.\n\n>> The independent investigation board that studied us declared it inherently unsafe.\n\nAnd that was it.\n\n♪♪ >> I understand that, hey, it's a risk.\n\nYou've got an orbiter sitting next to a bomb, basically.\n\nSo, hey, maybe that's not the best design.\n\nMaybe you should have the crew module on top of the rocket so it's safer for the astronauts.\n\n>> Disagreed with it because we knew, since day one, that it was an extremely fragile vehicle.\n\nYou can't beat on it.\n\nIt was never designed to be impacted.\n\nIf that's the way they felt, we never should have flown the first flight because you can't guarantee nothing is going to hit it.\n\n>> The independent board came out with three major recommendations.\n\nOne was to finish the International Space Station.\n\nAll the components were built to fly on the shuttle only.\n\nCouldn't fly on any other machine.\n\nWhen you're done doing that, retire the shuttle because it's inherently unsafe.\n\nWhile you're doing those two, you design and build America's next launch system, and we were in the process of doing that.\n\nIt was called the Constellation program.\n\nWe had a test launch off, everything was going fine.\n\nIn comes a new presidential administration and cancels that program.\n\nThat set us back.\n\nTechnically, schedule-wise, and emotionally, too.\n\nIt was like a punch in the gut.\n\n>> The saddest part out of all of it -- again, this is strictly my opinion -- you paid the Russians the same amount as what it cost us to process orders.\n\nThat'll never sit well with me.\n\nI loved the shuttle program.\n\nThe idea that it costs the same money, and you're handing it to a different country?\n\nI have serious problems with that.\n\n♪♪ >> Those particular

The end of the program was a challenge for Mark Nappi, Patty Stratton, who was his deputy, and then myself.\n\nWe were kind of the leadership team that had to get us to the end.\n\nPatty and I, we got together and we said, \"What are the things you can do when you're closing down a program to be successful at it?\"\n\nSo we started brainstorming.\n\nWe're all about the people.\n\nShe was kind of similar to me in terms of her management goals that she strived for.\n\nAnd I said, \"Well, to me, you know, people need to be treated with respect.\"\n\nAnd we never let 'em walk out the door without shaking their hand and thanking them for everything that they did for the program.\n\nYeah.\n\nJust talk about the day and the symbolism of it and how you feel about it.\n\n>> It's okay!\n\n♪♪ >> I'd like to say that there's always the right leader for the right time.\n\nAnd I credit Patty Stratton and Rita Willcoxon.\n\nThey got the people.\n\nThey got the emotional side of what people were going through and how hard it might be to recognize that this is the end.\n\n>> Patty and I always emphasized that they made history.\n\nAnd that nobody can take that away.\n\nThe program may be ending.\n\nNot your fault.\n\nThe textbooks that your grandchildren are reading about will talk about Shuttle.\n\nAnd you were a part of that.\n\nLet's start -- Let's sing the song.\n\nCome on, say a little part for me.\n\nWait a minute, I got to have Endeavor in the background.\n\n>> \"God Bless America\"?\n\n>> ♪ We all do what we can do ♪ ♪ To make this bird fly on wings ♪ ♪ And spirits soar ♪ ♪ Yes, they soar ♪ ♪ When three main engines sing ♪ ♪ And I see you ♪ ♪ Yes, I see ♪ ♪ You feel the same ♪ >> The voice is dead.\n\n>> Beautiful.\n\n'Cause that's -- >> Oh, God, I don't know that one.\n\n♪♪ >> Could the layoffs have been handled better?\n\nI don't think so.\n\nWe learned a lot from the layoffs at the end of the Apollo program.\n\nYou know, it's a government program.\n\nGovernment programs hire contractors to do the work for the government.\n\nAnd without a contract, those people go away.\n\nThat's just a fact of American life.\n\nAnd Shuttle, we knew it was coming.\n\nThe recommendation came out in 2004.\n\nShuttle ended up being retired in 2011.\n\nAnd, so, the workforce had time to prepare knowing they would probably get laid off.\n\nBut nevertheless, on those days, when you get your pink slip, it doesn't matter that you had 11 years to prepare for it.\n\nYou are not going to come to work the next day.\n\nYou don't have that paycheck.\n\nIt was very difficult to see my friends get laid off.\n\n>> As far as I'm concerned, the American public could not be prouder of that shuttle team.\n\nKnowing that they were going to lose their jobs, it was still focus 110%.\n\nThey were pure professionals up until the very bitter end.\n\nIt was incredible to see.\n\n>> It was sad.\n\nI've seen people with technical degrees, engineering degrees sitting in front of my desk with tears in their eyes.\n\nSome folks went off and bought large trucks, became truckers, and worked at big box stores.\n\n>> There was moments of frustration, anger, uncertainty.\n\nNot so much that you lost the job, but you lost part of yourself.\n\n>> People lost their homes left and right.\n\nThey couldn't find another job or they had to walk away because during all those layoffs was also 2009, which, you know, the economy tanked, and being the end of the shuttle program didn't help matters.\n\nNobody blinked an eye and were selfish.\n\nWe all did what we had to do.\n\nEverybody should be really proud of what we accomplished.\n\n>> All three engines up and burning.\n\nTwo, one, zero, and liftoff.\n\nThe final liftoff of Atlantis.\n\nOn the shoulders of the space shuttle, America will continue the dream.\n\n>> Houston now controlling.\n\nthe flight of Atlantis.\n\nSpace shuttle spreads its wings one final time for the start of a sentimental journey into history.\n\n♪♪ >> You know, the day the last shuttle launched, when it cleared the stack, I knew my life as I knew it was over.\n\nHonestly, I felt like my family walked out on me a little bit.\n\nI lost everything, I trusted people I shouldn't have trusted.\n\nI got to find something now to make ends meet.\n\nThat's all.\n\nThat's just life.\n\n[ Bell chimes ] Honey, I'm home.\n\nGood morning.\n\n>> Morning, Travis.\n\nWelcome.\n\n>> How we doing today?\n\n>> We're doing good.\n\nHow about you?\n\n>> I'm ready to go to work.\n\n>> I hear you.\n\n>> I think that's just way cool.\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> And he was here today.\n\nThey'd sewed the blankets by hand -- I'll show you one.\n\nI volunteer at the museum.\n\nI don't get anything out of it.\n\nIt costs me money I don't have just to drive there.\n\nBut I do it because I found out that there's people that are interested in what we did.\n\nFor a long time, I didn't even tell people what I did 'cause I didn't want people to think I was bragging.\n\nBut, damn, what a cool job.\n\nWe were not special.\n\nThere was thousands of people that did thousands of things.\n\nYou had people's lives in your hands.\n\nYou had this vehicle that was just awesome.\n\n[ Chuckles ] We put our hearts and souls into it, you know?\n\n>> I was always involved in other things outside of work.\n\nSo, once I left work, I put on a completely different kind of hat.\n\nI do think NASA put forth an effort to provide access to equality in terms of employment to African-Americans.\n\nMany of the school children kind of grew up with the shuttle program and being able to see Black astronauts.\n\nIt broadened their horizon into what's possible.\n\nWe have a myriad of issues that need addressing today.\n\nBut I think national programs can help unite us as a nation and as a people.\n\n>> When I think of the space shuttle, the technical accomplishments, bar none.\n\nBut there's a humanistic side to the shuttle program.\n\nIt didn't really hit me until I turned my badge in.\n\nI had had unrestricted access to Kennedy Space Center from April 1967 until July 2011.\n\nThat was hard.\n\nThat was very difficult.\n\n>> I was very, very lucky to work on a new program from start to finish.\n\nJob security, raising a family in that environment, be a part of all its highs and Lows, unfortunately.\n\nIt's cool that they have a time capsule over there in the visitor center.\n\nWhen they sealed that thing up, they had people write down their kids' names.\n\nAnd they're going to notify them when they open it.\n\nSo I'm hoping my daughter will get to go there.\n\nI think it'll bring back a lot of memories for her.\n\nAnd maybe for her kids, my granddaughters, they'll say, \"You know what?\n\nI want to do that, too.\n\nI want to be like Grandma did and do that, too.\"\n\n>> It's highly emotional.\n\nYou know, we'd fuss at each other, have arguments, sometimes raise our voices.\n\nBut when you'd see that vehicle roll out, if you'd just look over and make eye contact with people, you'd see tears in people's eyes.\n\nWe did this.\n\nI get emotional even thinking about it.\n\nBut great people, great team.\n\nYou know, my memories are...
