If it weren't for the discussion of Frida Kahlo, the tale might have stopped there, in particular a play titled \"Winter as Frida Kahlo\" that Bramwell Noah had written a few years prior.\n\nIn this performance, a single actress played the roles of both sisters in a stunning lead role. The play had become an immediate hit. It had even traveled as a component of a worldwide display featuring Frida Kahlo's never-before-seen collection of artwork.\n\nIt had been a truly theatrical experience, the stage play. Bramwell Noah set out to radically rethink the fantasia approach of his original work for the entirely new cinematic interpretation. The journey would now be enhanced by a plethora of new characters and the paintings themselves. Naturally, though, Frida Kahlo would still be at the center of it all.\n\nOn the day of Frida's funeral, the narrative opens with her sister Cristina and her twice-married ex-husband, Diego Kahlo. Diego is thinking a lot about getting older. However, Cristina has rediscovered something else because of the day's emotions. She's been haunted by her past guilt over her affair with Diego. The grief takes us back to the day it began.\n\nThe past and present of two sisters and an unfaithful husband are suddenly in the same place at the same time.\n\nCheyenne Rae Hernandez, Simon Palomares, and Daniel Schepisi deliver unforgettable performances in the movie.\n\nInfo about the Production, Cast, Designers and a Stills Gallery in the movie website at this link.\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nFrida (2024)\n\nDirected by Carla Gutiérrez\n\nProduced By\n\nKatia Maguire, Sara Bernstein, Justin Wilkes, Loren Hammonds, Alexandra Johnes\n\nAn intimately raw and magical journey through the life, mind, and heart of iconic artist Frida Kahlo, FRIDA is told through her own words for the very first time, drawn from her famed illustrated diary, revealing letters, essays, and candid print interviews — and brought vividly to life by lyrical animation inspired by her unforgettable artwork. The feature film directorial debut of acclaimed editor Carla Gutiérrez (RBG, La Corona), FRIDA posits a striking context as to why the artist – and her art -- remains as powerful as ever.\n\nCovering more than 40 years of her life, the filmmakers received unrestricted access to research materials, much never shown to the general public before. What is extraordinary about Kahlo's life and art is how her images would galvanize multiple generations of admirers worldwide, doing more than solidifying her status as a modern artist of timeless import.\n\nAn intensive journey spanning two years, Gutiérrez and her formidable team of artisans, most of whom are women and proudly Latine, gathered together to craft a singular cinematic experience that could be no ordinary art history lesson. A living portrait emboldened by the magical realism befitting Kahlo's remarkable life emerges. Yet, her voice ultimately stands supreme, a complex and powerful sound of a multitude of Fridas: fearless, seductive, defiant, vulnerable, raucous, and wonderfully alive.\n\nPresented at the Sundance Film Festival 2024\n\nInteresting reviews:\n\nNew Frida Kahlo Documentary at Sundance Doesn’t Even Scratch the Surface of a Complex Artist (ARTnews)\n\nWhy Director Carla Gutierrez Wanted Frida Kahlo to Tell Her Own Story in the Sundance Doc ‘Frida (Variety)\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nExhibition On Screen - Frida Kahlo (2020)\n\nDirected by Ali Ray\n\nWriters: Phil Grabsky and Ali Ray\n\nExhibition on Screen™ is the originator and pioneer of bringing exhibition-based art films to the cinema. The documentary dedicated to Frida Kahlo was in cinemas starting from 20 October 2020 and will be shown at the Sedona International Film Festival on October 27, 2020.\n\nUsing letters Kahlo wrote to guide us, this definitive film reveals her deepest emotions and unlocks the secrets and symbolism contained within her art. Exhibition on Screen’s trademark combination of interviews, commentary and a detailed exploration of her art delivers a treasure trove of color and a feast of vibrancy.\n\nFilmed extensively at The Blue House in Mexico City, this personal and intimate film offers privileged access to her works, and highlights the source of her feverish creativity, her resilience, and her unmatched lust for life, politics, men and women.\n\n“Directing this film has totally changed my view on Frida Kahlo as an artist,” said director Ali Ray. “Now, having studied her works closely and understanding their context of time and place, I am utterly gripped. Having access to her personal letters was a key part of making the film, and in my own understanding of her work. It enabled me to see how the fragility and insecurities revealed in her letters were processed through the act of painting. Her meticulously painted canvases were how she interpreted the world, her politics, passions and emotions, transforming them into images of strength, defiance and understanding.”\n\n(taken from VerdeNews.com)\n\nFrom an interesting review by The Reviews Hub:\n\nExhibition On Screen fulfils its brief in giving not just an overview of Frida Kahlo, but offering fresh artistic insight. Highlighting Kahlo’s technical and conceptual prowess, Exhibition On Screen ensures that we are left in no doubt of Frida’s place in art history. Kahlo not only makes herself artist and muse, her visual vocabulary – pain, suffering and love – goes to the heart of the human condition. We are shown Kahlo in her truest form and her own image: emotionally complex and fiercely radical.\n\nAt this link an interview with Ali Ray in italian.\n\nGo to the Exhibition on Screen website to buy this film (download/stream/dvd).\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nVisit the website dedicated to this TV documentary\n\nyoutube link to full documentary\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n\"Frida\" (2002)\n\n\"Frida\", directed by Julie Taymor, stars Salma Hayek (Frida), Alfred Molina (Diego Rivera), Antonio Banderas (David Alfaro Siqueiros), Ashley Judd (Tina Modotti) and many others.\n\nInternet Movie Database\n\narticol from El Andar tells us the story of the \"Hollywood's long, slow race to make the definitive Frida Kahlo film\"\n\n______________________________________________\n\nGreat Women Artists: Frida Kahlo (2001)\n\nThis documentary is part of a series that profiles outstanding women artists. This volume focuses on the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. As a young girl, Kahlo suffered terrible injuries in a traffic accident. Her lifelong struggle with pain shaped and informed her art. Her bold style and emotionally charged works capture the passion she displayed in all aspects of her life. Married to the muralist Diego Rivera, she was great friends with Leon Trotsky, whose philosophy she embraced. This documentary presents some of Kahlo's best-known paintings.\n\n______________________________________________\n\n\"Frida Kahlo's Corset\" (2000)\n\nFrida Kahlo's Corset is a short experimental drama that follows a journey of transformation by Frida who wore\n\na series of orthopaedic corsets because of impairment. The film draws on Kahlo's own words and characteristically bold painting style. It refutes the picture of Kahlo's life as one of tragedy and suffering. As Liz Crow said in an interesting interview \"She struggled, true, but as an absolute survivor, not a victim. So in the film the corset is both literal and symbolic.\n\nIt's literally an assault on her sense of her self, but the corset and the way it's applied are also symbols of colonisation - one of the major themes of her work - in this case the medical colonisation of the body. The film shows a journey of transformation as she establishes a new sense of self.\"\n\n(UK/Sp 2000) 16mm: 10 min. Director: Liz Crow, Production Company: Infinite Blue Productions Picture This Moving Image, Production Design: Melanie Leeson, editor: Andy Moss, music/composer: Caravanserai, Hetty Hope, writer: Liz Crow, Ralph Hoyte, Cast: Isolte Avila, Laura Jerram, Carmen Brauning.\n\nRead here the complete interview with Liz Crow\n\n_____________________________________________\n\n\"A Ribbon Around a Bomb\" (1992)\n\nIt is hardly enough time to do justice to the passionate life and art of Frida Kahlo, the Mexican painter who seems about to jump off the canvases of her vibrant, fantastic self-portraits. Even more than her accessible art, Kahlo's explosive existence has made her something of a pop icon in recent years.\n\nThat well-documented life is the subject of \"Frida Kahlo: A Ribbon Around a Bomb,\" a part-documentary, part-performance film published on 1992.\n\nThe director Ken Mandel takes a scattershot approach to this material. He weaves together interviews with people who knew Kahlo, several photographs and films of her, and many shots of her most familiar paintings. Most successfully, he includes excerpts of a theater piece by Abraham Oceransky called \"The Diary of Frida Kahlo,\" presented by Teatro Dallas.\n\nThe documentary sections are extremely weak, because Kahlo's associates are not sufficiently identified, their often spurious opinions not put in any context. Surely the bloodiness of Kahlo's paintings cannot be traced simply to her one-time ambition to study medicine, as an interview subject claims. But the dramatized episodes, based on Kahlo's diaries, are surprisingly effective.\n\nMost of this theater piece is a monologue performed by Cora Cardona, sometimes joined by Quigley Provost as a younger Kahlo. Ms. Cardona does not imitate Kahlo so much as bring the depths of that volcanic, tortured personality to life. Depicting Kahlo's reaction to her accident, she wraps a large chain around her leg and reveals both pain and astonishing strength as she says: \"I am not dead. I am not sick. I am only broken.\"\n\nStill, the film, whose subtitle comes from Andre Breton's description of Kahlo's art, is likely to be too shallow for anyone who knows her story and too sketchy for anyone unfamiliar with it. Ms. Cardona's trenchant performance hints at how illuminating this film might have been.\n\nDirected and edited by Ken Mandel; based on the play by Abraham Oceransky; director of photography, Jeff Hurst; music by John Bryant and Frank Hames; produced by Mr. Hurst, Mr. Mandel and Cora Cardona; a Roxie release. Performed by: Cora Cardona, Quigley Provost and Costa Caglage.\n\ntaken from The New York Times\n\nyoutube video\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n\"Diego Rivera: I paint what I see\" (1989)\n\nThe first biographical film on the famed Mexican artist, \"DIEGO RIVERA: I PAINT WHAT I SEE\", directed by Mary Lance, traces his life from childhood through his Cubist period, his leading role in the Mexican mural renaissance, his fame as a muralist in the USA, and his later years.\n\nThe film explores Rivera's life and work, including his stormy relationship with Frida Kahlo and the destruction of his famous mural at Rockefeller Center.\n\nShot on location in Mexico and the United States, the film includes a remarkable collection of archival film and photographs, much of which has not been seen before. The text is drawn from the writings of Rivera and Kahlo and from other historical texts. Using Rivera's own words, this richly detailed film brings to life the difficulty he faced in his transition from studio artist to public and political artist, and the conflicts that arose from that point onward.\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n\"Frida, Naturaleza Viva\" (1983)\n\ndirected by Paul Leduc, starring Ofelia Medina as Frida Kahlo\n\nclick here to see the complete movie in YouTube\n\nReview by Jayne Margetts\n\n\"For director Paul Leduc it would have been a difficult task to try to capture facets of Frida's vivid and flamboyant personality and life in any feature-length format, let alone recreating some of the defining moments that shaped the artist she was. But with his grainy and abstract, re-enacted documentary Frida, Naturaleza Viva he has done Kahlo proud in not succumbing to heavy analysis. Rather, he chooses to piece together snapshots of her life with the grace of humility of directing a rustic opera performed to a minimal backdrop.\n\nReview by Jonathan Rosenbaum\n\nThrough his eyes we experience Kahlo's stormy relationship with muralist Diego Rivera, her comradeship and sentimentality with the exiled Leon Trotsky, her struggle for acceptance as an artist, her patriotism and love for Mexico her affairs with David Squiros and the horrors of her miscarriage and the amputation of her leg....\n\nActress Ofelia Medina who portrays Kahlo bears not only an uncanny resemblance, but shares her mannerisms, her dignity and her feverish passion, while Luduc's camera roves silently across the parchment of her sacred paintings capturing the ambience and atmosphere of those troubled and turbulent times in which she lived.\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nPortrait of an Artist: Frida Kahlo (1983)\n\nFRIDA KAHLO (Art Documentary) (2007)\n\nA film by EILA HERSHON and ROBERTO GUERRA\n\nCommentary by Hayden Herrera\n\nNarrated by Sada Thompson\n\nEdited by Caroline Emmonds\n\nDirected by Eila Hershon, Roberto Guerra and Wibke von Bonin\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nFrida Kahlo & Tina Modotti (1982)\n\nLaura Mulvey & Peter Wollen, 30 mins Colour 16 mm film.\n\nA documentary about the lives and work of painter Frida Kahlo and photographer Tina Modotti, divided into sections: History; Popular Life and Culture; Roots and Movements; Biography; Inward/Outward; The Body; Injury/Beauty. Also included is a home movie of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera at their 'Blue House' in Coyoacan, and Tina Modotti in the 1919 Hollywood film,The Tigers Coat.\n\nBoth Frida Kahlo and Tina Modotti were artists working in Mexico in the aftermath of the Revolution, during a period of general cultural awakening and social change. Frida was married to Diego Rivera and was born, worked and died in the same 'blue house' in Coyoacan, while Tina Modotti emigrated to California with her family from Udine, Italy, and travelled to Mexico with Edward Weston, where she then stayed to become a photographer in her own right. The broad similarities between their lives bind the film as a whole, reflecting on the representation of women, women's art and feminist aesthetics; while the differences between them make up the content.\n\nMore info at the Luxonline website\n\nyoutube video\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n\"The Life and Death of Frida Kahlo as Told to Karen and David Crommie\" (1966)\n\nIn 1965 Karen and David Crommie made this film featuring interviews with many people who knew and worked with Frida and are no longer with us. Frida was quite unknown when the film debuted in 1966 at the San Francisco International Film Festival and when Hayden Herrera saw it at a screening in New York later that year she was motivated to write her Frida's biography.\n\nThe first ever Frida documentary. And the rest is history.\n\nExhibition On Screen - Frida Kahlo (2020)\n\nDirected by Ali Ray\n\nWriters: Phil Grabsky and Ali Ray\n\nExhibition on Screen™ is the originator and pioneer of bringing exhibition-based art films to the cinema.
