        "text": "A Queens art teacher by day, Robert Martens also manages the YouTube channel Grandpaâs Picture Party, posting video transfers of home movies and films shot by his late grandfather Gus, who had been an avid member of the Amateur Cinema League. I first met Robert in 2011 at New York Cityâs Home Movie Day, where he screened some footage that Gus shot at the 1939 Worldâs Fair. We got to talking and our conversation quickly turned to one of the most bizarre items on the Grandpaâs Picture Party channel: a three-minute sound film of shifting colored patterns. The work was an uncanny and perplexing thing, akin to Brakhage-on-Valium, and it inspired the same kind of prolonged fixation as crackling campfire or one of those enchanting moving waterfall pictures. Robert had never been able to determine exactly what it was, and in 2007 he posted the movie under the title Psychedelic Bing Crosby Video hoping someone could shed light on it. As he told it, user comments for the first couple of years were amusing (i.e. âWhat was Bing smoking?!â) but far from helpful. Many questioned the movieâs authenticity. Finally, he received a very brief comment from username âbunnyhatterâ suggesting that it was an âAuroratone.â\n\nAuroratone was the result of mechanical attempts by British-born Cecil Stokes to render music into projected colored images. The key idea here â mimicking synaesthesia with the help of machinery â dates at least as far back as French Jesuit Louis-Bertrand Castelâs 18th century âocular harpsichord,â which correlated colors of the visible spectrum with notes of the musical scale. [1] In 1940, after some six years of research and development, Stokes applied for a patent called, âProcess and Apparatus for Producing Musical Rhythm in Colorâ: [2]\n\nBy August 1942, when Stokes finally received patent #2,292,172, he had already debuted his projection machine at an American Legion post in Long Beach, California. [4] A rare laypersonâs explanation, by the light artist John Sonderegger, elucidates how Stokes used sound waves from audio loops to create the colored slides of crystalline patterns:\n\nYet unclear, was what became of Stokesâ and his projection contraption. Aside from the patent, references to Stokesâ origins and biography were scant, and Auroratone proved remarkably absent from scholarship on experimental film, expanded cinema, and film history in general. (Even the connection between bunnyhatterâs suggestion and Stokesâ mechanistic invention seemed tenuous, as the term âAuroratoneâ fails to appear in the text of Stokesâ patent.) Why did Bing Crosbyâs voice accompany images that in some other era â say, the 1960s â might screen to a bunch of drugged-out dancing hippies at Bill Grahamâs Fillmore Auditorium? How exactly did images generated by Stokesâ elaborate light machine end up on 16mm Kodachrome film stock? And, why did Gus Martens, a Queens soda pop distributor, possess the only-known Auroratone print? This exhibition history attempts some answers.\n\n* * * * *\n\nDuring the 2012 Orphan Film Symposium, the Museum of the Moving Image hosted a public screening of Martensâ unexplained Auroratone artifact. Martens was on-hand to introduce a new 16mm preservation print of the film, and he described his own first encounter with the film:\n\nArchery Antics is nearly as mysterious as the Auroratone itself. Yet, Robertâs mention of the two filmsâ provenance connection revealed a common thread between the Auroratone and âpsychodramaticâ films shown to psychiatric patients during World War II. Made by the sponsored film producer Don Robert Catlin, the nine-minute Archery Antics opens with (as the narration describes) âa shady lagoon, a swing, a beautiful girl, and a roving archer,â played by the world-famous archer Ande Vail. After Vail bullseyes a red balloon attached to the buxom femaleâs toe, the couple engages in a host of exhilarating acts: target practice, match-lighting, and feasting on an elaborate spread of picnic food. âIâll bet they donât feed you this good in the army,â the narrator speculates. The film ends â insanely â with an alarming periscopic close-up of a toy battleship floating in a nearby pond, emblazoned with the Japanese flag and the name âHirohito.â In a drawn-out tension-filled finale, Vail shoots an arrow sinking the boat in a fiery flurry, while Rossiniâs thundering âWilliam Tell Overtureâ climaxes on the soundtrack.\n\nDuring World War II, Army psychologists began experimenting with the use of specialized movies in wartime hospitals as therapy for âcombat fatigueâ â what we acknowledge today as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Films could cathartically trigger traumatic memories during therapy sessions and, according to Lieutenant Commander Howard P. Rome (one of the most prolific published scientists on the subject), such screenings were first prompted by the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery in 1943. [6] Categorized as either âtherapeuticâ or âpsychodramatic,â these films were carefully scripted by psychologists to portray tailored, âscenes of action, role developments, climaxes, and anti-climaxes. [7]\n\nArchery Anticsâ production era and its gargantuan degree of non-sequitur pathos makes it a likely candidate as one such psychodrama. When I suggested this to Robert, he amazingly recalled:\n\nIndeed, medical literature reveals that Stokesâ Auroratone technology figured notably in psychiatric healing, largely through the work of the army psychologists Dr. Herbert E. Rubin, Captain, M.C. and Dr. Elias Katz, 2nd Lt. MAC. Results of their testing, first published in 1946, detailed Auroratoneâs ability to stimulate intense relaxation, weeping, and emotional catharses in patients that enabled them to speak freely with psychiatrists immediately after screenings â conceivably, the kind of visual soothing required by patients witnessing Vailâs tense âdefeatâ of the Japanese navy. [8] So effective were Auroratoneâs patterns of light and music, that Katz and Rubin posited that sensitivity to aesthetics was an instinctual vestige that could transcend psychoses.\n\nKatz and Rubinâs research was preceded by several other cursory Auroratone experiments. Reports in 1944, from the Seattle nurse Marjorie Umbenhour, R.N., tell of screenings in the locked wards of military hospitals that resulted in one-third of patients falling asleep. [9] âWhy donât they give us more stuff like that?â one vet asked. âAfter seeing these movies,â another said, âIâll never doubt God again.â [10] Subsequent testing in 1951 by two Michigan doctors from the Lapeer State Home and Training School reported that Auroratone only further agitated a clinical group of âfemale psychotics;â had no therapeutic effects on âlow-grade male patients of disturbed character;â but, did produce a âreverie-like hypnagogic stateâ in certain members of a third clinical group of âmoron grade-school children.â [11] Initially prescribed for the mentally afflicted, post-war Auroratone treatments were soon adapted for social miscreants as well. At a Los Angeles home for troubled youth, one juvenile delinquent responded to a screening: âI think God must have painted those pictures. â[12]\n\nAuroratone prints found their way into these experimental testing milieus thanks to the establishment of the Auroratone Foundation of America (AFA) in March of 1944. [13] A California state non-profit, the AFAâs stated mission was to discover, ânew and improved methods of lessening mental and physical tensions in the shortest possible time, and in natural ways,â and benevolently distributed its services free of charge. [14] At its founding, Cecil Stokes was appointed AFA chairman, Bing Crosby became Director of Music Research Experiments, and Mary Pickford was cited amongst its original board members. [15] Crosbyâs affiliation with Stokes provided soundtracks with which to generate Auroratoneâs crystal patterns, and his fiduciary liens enabled the initial creation of film print versions of Stokesâ projected patterns, for wider dissemination.\n\nWhile the partnership may seem initially outrageous, Crosbyâs colossal wealth as Americaâs preeminent entertainment personality would deeply impact the development of experimental media, even subsequent to his involvement with Stokesâ Auroratone. Bing Crosby Enterprises (BCE), headed by Crosbyâs brother, Larry, saw major shareholding investment of Crosbyâs cash in a strange array of banal business collaborations, including: special window-sash holders, automatic coffee dispensers, Minute Maid frozen orange juice, and the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball club. [16] But, Crosby also supported funding of the U.S. Army Signal Corpsman Jack Mullinâs experimental research with magnetic audiotape plundered from the Nazis â technology which enabled Crosby to pre-record, overdub, and easily edit his radio show. This latter investment would forever transform the industry of recorded sound and, in 1956, resulted in the first commercial release of videotape â at the time, perhaps, an equally far-fetched parallel effort at technologically converting sound into moving images.\n\nIn June 1944, Crosby made Auroratone recordings of âGoing My Way,â âHome on the Range,â and âAve Mariaâ with organist Eddie Dunstedter. [17] (Lt. Col. Dunstedter, AAF, who later appeared on AFA letterhead as âDirector, Musical Arrangements and Recording,â was active in Hollywood film scoring circles and as an occasional accompanist for Crosby.) Stokes would later tell a Sandusky newspaper that âBing Crosby recorded the first songs for us, free,â adding, âand paid everything we needed to send them overseas. They tell me they were shown every place â from battle lines to death beds.â [18] Reports suggest that Bing Crosby went so far as to learn âChinese lingoâ to record an Auroratone of Chinaâs national anthem, at the request of Generalissimo Chiang Kai Shek. [19]\n\nNo hard evidence exists to explain Stokesâ initial encounter with Crosby, but the âWomenâs Pageâ of the Lubbock Morning Avalanche cites a Crosby-influenced Genesis story for Auroratone. Stokes was recuperating on a friendâs yacht, from ulcers developed as an advertising executive, when:\n\n* * * * *\n\nThroughout the 1940s, womenâs groups like the Bakersfield Soroptimist Club and Womanâs Club of Hollywood sponsored fundraising efforts to finance the production of Auroratone film prints meant to treat returning war veterans. [21] In an attempt to convey Auroratoneâs immense powers, a 1945 Long Beach Press-Telegram article included a first-person testimonial from a B-29 bombardier:\n\nCecil Stokes was often a guest at these fundraising exhibition-galas, speaking alongside army nurses and society members. After one such screening, Mrs. Laura James DeWitt documented her Auroratone experience in Rosicrucian Digest, poetically echoing other first-person testimonials of the era: \"Can this be the doorstep into another world â a world of inspiration and knowledge of why things are as they are?\" [23]\n\nThe network of Auroratone exhibition throughout the 1940s spanned the continent outside hospital and philanthropic venues as well, with frequent public screenings in department stores: at L.A.âs Broadway in 1943 (promising the âscientific sensation of the dayâ [24]); at Philadelphiaâs Snellenburgâs in 1945 [25]; in the tenth-floor auditorium of L.A.âs Bullockâs in 1947 [26]; and at Winnipegâs The Bay auditorium, where the event was heralded as âthe nearest thing to the Aurora Borealis ever shown.â [27] For screenings at Chicagoâs The Fair in 1945, newspapers promoted the screenings with the tagline: âyouâll probably feel sleepy yourself.â [28]\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis research is dedicated to Kathleen Maguire, who first introduced me to Auroratone.
