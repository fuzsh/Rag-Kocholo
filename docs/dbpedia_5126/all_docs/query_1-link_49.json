        "text": "Lights, Camera, VFX\n\nUnlocking the Secrets\n\nof Special Effects\n\nSpecial effects are fundamental to the film industry, bringing our favorite storylines, fantasy worlds, and characters to life through exciting visual mediums. Over the past hundred years, special effects have drastically evolved, seeing physical effects elevated with digital techniques that go hand in hand with technological advancements.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll explore the impact of special effects in media, delving into the effect these types of visuals have on society and the evolution of entertainment.\n\nHistory of Special Effects and Its Impact on Media\n\nSpecial effects have come a long way, with their impact on media continuing to grow in significance. When high-quality special effects are used, you can invoke specific emotions in your audience or even make them feel as though they are in the movie due to how realistic the results can be.\n\n1857: First motion print\n\nwith special effects.\n\nOf course, this advanced level of technology hasn’t always been the case, with 1857 being the first time special effects were used for Oscar Rejlander’s motion montage print. 1895 is regarded as the year of the first motion picture’s special effect, with Alfred Clark using stop motion to reenact the beheading of Mary, Queen of Scots.\n\n1895: Alfred Clark reenacts Mary, Queen of Scots’ beheading.\n\nAs this sounds, this technique brought an incredible impact on motion picture and has been adopted by multiple filmmakers ever since. When filmmakers realized the way special effects can make audiences feel and how they can elevate their visions, media was changed forever.\n\nHow Special Effects Have Impacted Movies\n\nSpecial effects have a longstanding history in the film industry, with filmmakers experimenting with techniques to create specific visual effects from the beginning of the screenplay industry. As entertainment was once solely made for live performance, special effects in these art forms transcended to the screen, with silent films being some of the first notable efforts.\n\nRegarding silent films, everything about this category relied on strong visual representation as there was no sound.\n\nStop motion was a widespread technique in this period, in which objects and characters were moved one frame at a time between shots to create the effect of movement.\n\nTechniques have come a long way since the silent films of the 1920s, allowing filmmakers to unleash all of their dream results.\n\nThe most pivotal advancements have mainly occurred in the last fifty years, with CGI becoming popular in the 1980s, leading to some of the most iconic creations, such as Star Wars.\n\nStar Wars was released in 1977 and featured special effects ahead of their time and inspired a new, innovative approach to sci-fi creations and other genres. Practical effects such as miniatures and paintings joined forces with motion control cameras, establishing a new era for visual effects.\n\nOf course, CGI has continued to develop since the 90s, with a vast host of creatures, from goblins to dragons to three-headed dogs in Harry Potter. Motion caption technology is a popular method for many modern creations, with Avatar using the technique to create otherworldly creatures.\n\nAvatar used three camera types to create incredible results when shooting the film; CGI performance capture, live action, and hybrid shooting.\n\nMotion capture uses a virtual system in which actors wear suits covered in markers that reflect infrared light to cameras, enabling animators to create characters with the data points provided, with real-life movement making these characters more lifelike than ever before.\n\nDirector James Cameron elevated the motion capture technique by equipping actors with headset cameras that captured facial expressions, again giving the avatars realistic expressions that defied CGI as we knew it. This added another layer to emotional performances, with actors able to seamlessly transfer their moving performances to the world of CGI.\n\nCameron used a virtual action camera to shoot scenes to see how performances were translating in the virtual realm he created, with the ability to shoot scenes from any angle with immediately rendered results. This innovative approach enabled Cameron to direct computer-generated scenes as the actors performed in real time, adjusting the swing camera to capture the best shots.\n\nIn addition to actors being involved in motion capture, physical objects such as miniature jets were also covered in markers to transform them into CGI. Again, this provided another level of creative freedom instead of generating the images from CGI alone.\n\nAvatar was released in 2009, and these incredible techniques have stood the test of time, inspiring creations of the last decade to continue experimenting with VFX and pushing the boundaries.\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe is an example of VFX continuing to develop, with entire fight scenes integrated with CGI, blending astronomy, humans, aliens, and much more seamlessly for an unforgettable viewing experience.\n\nInfluential VFX Artists\n\nThe likes of Avatar wouldn’t be possible without many influential VFX artists paving the way for special effects. Let’s take a look at some of those names:\n\n1933\n\nWillis O'Brien\n\n‘King Kong’ brought fame to O’Brien, pioneering film.\n\n1933\n\nMost known for the 1933 horror ‘King Kong’ O’Brien was a pioneering force in the film industry.\n\nStop-motion animation was one of the first visual effect techniques invented before animatronics and computer-generated animations became more popularized. O’Brien brought the stop-motion technique into the mainstream, using clay creatures and puppets to deliver cinematic masterpieces. By the time O’Brien worked on King Kong, he had impressed many important film producers with his craftsmanship, leading him to be employed as the special effects supervisor for King Kong.\n\nKong was an 18-inch puppet designed from fur, metal, and rubber, and each movement was shot one frame at a time.\n\nBy no surprise, this was a pretty lengthy process, taking over a year to complete. O’Brien blended multiple filming techniques to deliver iconic results, from animations to matte painting, miniatures, and rear projection.\n\nAs Kong uses real-life actors, two processes blend the live-action footage with the stop-motion footage. The rear projection would project live-action footage onto a screen built into a mini set, projecting frames to match the animated sequences. The other process was called the dunning process, which combined two pieces of film simultaneously to create a more seamless combination of reality and fantasy.\n\nDespite King Kong now being 90 years old, it’s still renowned as a work of art and a classic horror film, with O’Brien’s dedicated VFX work going down in history.\n\n1992\n\nRay Harryhausen\n\nIn 1992, his work recognized globally, as he received an Academy Award\n\n1992\n\nHarryhausen was one of O’Brien’s proteges, taken under his wing at a young age to work on various projects. In his career, Ray worked on multiple iconic films, with some of his notable sequences being the likes of the skeletons fighting during “Jason and the Argonauts” and captivating creatures such as the Kraken and Medusa in “Clash of the Titans.”\n\nAlthough Harryhausen used many of O’Brien’s innovative techniques when crafting visuals, he went on to create new strategies and expand upon the work of his predecessor. His innovation was named ‘Dynamation,’ seeing stop-motion filming of miniatures on a minimal painted set, a glass pan with blacked-out portions, and a screen projection to create the special effects. Reexposing the final footage would include live-action footage for the best result.\n\nIn 1992, Harryhausen’s contributions to the art of visual effects were recognized globally, as he received an Academy Award for technical achievement.\n\n1999\n\nJohn Gaeta\n\nGaeta’s Matrix work stands among decades of acclaim.\n\n1999\n\nWe can’t jump to more recent VFX creations without speaking about John Gaeta, the talent behind The Matrix’s extraordinary visuals. One of his most iconic effects was ‘bullet time,’ which saw Keanu Reeves dodge hundreds of bullets in slow motion, keeping viewers on the edges of their seats.\n\nAlthough his work on The Matrix is one of his most notable visual results, Gaeta has decades of highly-acclaimed work under his belt. His first big gig was on Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, which led him to join forces with pioneering visual effects artist Douglas Turnbull, working on various techniques which helped him flourish on future projects like Speed Racer and The Matrix.\n\nGatea continues to push the boundaries of special effects, working on exciting projects such as the virtual reality Star Wars.\n\n2015\n\nPaul J. Franklin\n\nFranklin bonded with Nolan, won 2 Oscars, making him successful visual effects artists..\n\n2015\n\nAnother visual effects artist responsible for some more recent contributions to the world of VFX is Paul J. Franklin, with notable blockbusters such as Captain America: Civil War, Venom, The DaVinci Code, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.\n\nFranklin was in charge of visual effects artists who worked on remarkable blockbusters like…\n\nHis journey into visual effects started when Franklin became a videotape editor, leading to a passion for animation and computer graphics. Initially, he worked as a computer artist specializing in video games, going on to found Double Negative in 1998. The company has significantly succeeded, working on Dune, Dunkirk, and Inception.\n\nThrough working on specific films, Franklin struck a bond with filmmaker Christopher Nolan, in which the pair have collaborated on several films. This work led Franklin to win two Oscars for Interstellar and Inception, making him one of modern film’s most successful visual effects artists.\n\nWhat are\n\nSpecial Effects?\n\nWhile we all have a vague understanding of special effects, there’s a high chance you associate VFX with the incredible visual effects you see in your favorite films, from Lord of The Rings to Avatar, offering some of the most mind-blowing sights. But how are special effects defined?\n\nSpecial effects are visual elements in media created by technologies and specific techniques. There are various types of special effects, which are categorized as practical or digital.\n\nPractical\n\nSpecial Effects\n\nWith practical special effects, physical objects such as animatronics, makeup, prosthetics, and pyrotechnics are used to create visual illusions. Practical techniques have been used since the beginning of entertainment, with filmmakers experimenting with makeup and prosthetics to portray emotions.\n\nanimatronics, makeup, prosthetics, and pyrotechnics are used to create visual illusions.\n\nanimatronics\n\nmakeup\n\nprosthetics\n\npyrotechnics\n\nOn the other hand, physical objects have been made to disappear and explode with pyrotechnics since the start of theater. While digital special effects are more commonly used in film, there is no denying that practical special effects are essential in live performance and can help bring movies to life.\n\nWhile the advancements in digital VFX can come across as more realistic than certain types of practical special effects, there’s a level of realism that practical effects can bring to a scene, especially with explosions, vehicles, and creatures. From an actor’s perspective, having the physical, tangible object on set can make getting into character much more straightforward than working with green screens.\n\nChristopher Nolan is a huge advocate for using practical effects, with Inception and Dunkirk providing excellent examples of moving sets, stunts, and miniature models being some of modern cinema’s best practical special effects. With directing giants such as Nolan using practical effects, the film industry is provided with valuable insight into how there is still a place for practical effects in cinema and how impactful they can be.\n\nThe main downside to practical effects is how time-consuming they can be to create, with prosthetics taking hours to produce. Additionally, less control and flexibility are provided with practical effects, meaning there’s more pressure to get things right the first time.\n\nHowever, as practical effects provide such unique aesthetics and add realism, they are still popular.\n\nDigital\n\nSpecial Effects\n\nDigital special effects,\n\nalso known as VFX\n\nDigital special effects, also known as VFX, are created with computer-generated imagery, green screens, digital compositing, and motion caption technology. Modern filmmaking uses VFX as it is the most technologically advanced medium for creating a visual impact in live-action footage in a way that can’t be achieved with practical effects.\n\nVisual effects truly know no bounds, allowing filmmakers to enhance imagery and create incredible simulations that blow viewers away. From nature to physics to otherworldly creatures, visual effects can produce enchanting results that make unique storytelling possible.\n\nnature\n\nvisual effects\n\nMost popular films in the last few decades use VFX to intrigue viewers and shock critics. Memorable mentions regarding VFX go to Avatar, Harry Potter, Dune and the Marvel franchise, with visual effects that transport you to another universe.\n\nThe main issue with VFX is that it can be costly, making it challenging for upcoming filmmakers to stand a chance against Hollywood giants that have the necessary technology on hand. When VFX is poorly executed, it can detract from excellent script writing, so filmmakers must take time to deliver high-quality effects that do their writing and cast justice.\n\nNotable VFX\n\nExamples\n\nWith thousands of movies and TV shows released yearly and VFX constantly evolving, many special effect contributions showcase current and past techniques in all of their glory. Global revenue for the special effects industry continues to grow annually, with an estimated 9884.95 million USD generated in 2022.\n\n9884.95 million USD\n\ngenerated in 2022.\n\nLet’s look at some notable VFX examples from the past century, noting how special effects have evolved and impacted the cinematic experience.\n\nJurassic Park\n\nThe 1993 classic blew minds with its innovative approach to CGI, exploring techniques in a realistic way that brought ancient creatures to life like never seen before. Jurassic Park’s CGI is one of the reasons the film has remained iconic and proved to filmmakers and directors worldwide that CGI could invoke feelings of fear in the audience, even if the creatures are extinct!\n\nDennis Muren\n\nDennis Muren was one of the masterminds behind the CG animals, going on to win an Oscar for his incredible work on the film. To produce such impactful results, Muren had two systems: CG and stop motion. The systems worked seamlessly to create natural results, pushing boundaries as working on real animals was a new step for animators.\n\nClose-ups were usually of puppets made by Stan Winston, with CG used for full-length shots and far-away sequences. However, as filming progressed, Muren got closer shots, with his confidence growing due to the rotunda sequence.\n\nTerminator 2: Judgement Day\n\nAnother creation courtesy of Dennis Muren is Terminator 2: Judgement Day, released two years before Jurassic Park. One of this film’s most significant CG elements was the T-1000, the liquid metal cyborg. To create such an impactful effect, Murren used reflection maps to anchor the frame, which came with multiple difficulties. Speaking on the process, Murin said:\n\n“We had background plates, and that environment needed to reflect in the character. The distortions had to remain consistent without creating big tears in the maps.”\n\nTerminator 2 was ahead of its time in many ways, using an effects process that was entirely digital, consisting of digital recording, digital manipulation, and digital results. To produce this result, Muren used scanners, film recorders, and Photoshop to paint frames and render forms, such as Robert Patrick’s animated liquid form.\n\nThe innovative process set the tone for the rest of the 90s, making way for creations such as Jurassic Park.\n\nDawn of the\n\nPlanet of the Apes\n\nProjecting us into the 2010s was Weta Digital’s CG work, bringing to life the story of a battle of survival for evolved apes. The 2011 creation saw CG creatures take center stage, with human actors seamlessly interacting with the computer-generated characters for a beautifully blended, realistic result.\n\nSimilarly to Avatar, merging real-life actors with CG enables special effects to strike a more emotional impact, giving CG characters a more believable depth.\n\nThis technique ensures CG has a more significant role in future creations, helping directors to convey complex emotions through inventive characters.\n\nMotion capture was used for the real-life footage portrayed by the cast, with actors such as Andy Serkis delivering striking performances. The motion capture footage was primarily shot on location, with technology taken up mountains despite adverse weather conditions. Although this presented a struggle at times, it resulted in authentic performances and footage.\n\nAnother struggle on set was that actors needed to actively consider how evolved apes would fight, which meant director Matt Reeves had to adapt to the actors’ workflow and film them in a virtual space. After the footage was taken, camera angles and beats were determined using virtual cameras.\n\nInterstellar\n\nThis creation by Christopher Nolan and Double Negative is one of the most mind-bending VFX results, inviting audiences to enjoy sights of accurate black holes, alien worlds, and a four-dimensional space with time as a physical dimension, also known as the Tesseract. Even the sound of these settings sounds complicated, and producing such innovative results requires patience and knowledge.\n\nThis VFX effort needed to be mathematically driven, so the project enlisted the help of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne to ensure the space-like creations, such as the black holes, were as realistic as possible with accurate dimensions.\n\nKip Thorne\n\nThe Gargantua black hole is one of the film’s most iconic moments, with its realistic depiction featuring accurate lighting backed by math and science. Kip Thorne handled the equations, whereas Double Negative’s Oliver James used his knowledge obtained from being a chief scientist to produce a new renderer based on physics called Double Negative General Relativity.\n\nThe renderer ensured artists could produce accurate images of the hole and its gravitational lens by setting three key parameters: mass, rate of spin, and diameter. This scientific approach was an artistic revelation but has gone on to be well-regarded for its contribution to science, with schools showing the film in lessons as a learning resource for general relativity.\n\nSpeaking to BBC News, Christopher Nolan shared his feelings on how the film has been received since its release:\n\n“We hoped that by dramatizing science and making it… entertaining for kids, we might inspire some of the astronauts of tomorrow.”\n\nCareers in VFX\n\nA career in VFX is a dream for many, and with media constantly evolving with more advanced special effects techniques, many job opportunities can be pursued in this field.
