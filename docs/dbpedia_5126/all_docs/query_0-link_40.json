        "text": "Every midnight in August 2021, a clowder of glowing felines took over Times Square. Artist Jennifer West’s Painted Cat Hacker Film transforms the “low art” of cat videos into a mesmerizing and monumental public artwork for the big screens.\n\nTo create the spectral and lo-fi effects in Painted Cat Hacker Film, West first compiled 16mm clips of cats against a green screen. Manipulating the celluloid in her signature style, West applied brightly colored dye to the filmstrip before transferring it to high-definition video. The resulting piece is a multi-channel work of handmade digitized GIFs that pay homage to the feline’s role across many moving image genres — from the viral video, to experimental film, and the screens of Times Square themselves.\n\nPainted Cat Hacker Film is also a playful nod to the ongoing phenomenon of the public’s fascination with cats on the Internet. The subject of both serious writing and light-hearted inquiry, research has suggested that viewing online cat media is linked to positive emotions, and that it may even work as a form of digital therapy or stress relief. As filmmaker Werner Herzog has said, “When you are really down, you better switch on your laptop or smartphone and watch 60 seconds of crazy cat videos. It just lifts your spirits. Nothing wrong about it.”\n\nCats on Video, Cats on Film\n\nAugust 1–31, 2021 | Online\n\nSelected by Jennifer West\n\nIn August of 2021, in conjunction with her Midnight Moment exhibition, West presented a curated selection of artists’ videos and experimental films featuring cats. Although the exhibition has ended, you can see a list of the selected pieces below.\n\nSays West: \"In this program I pay homage to the rich history of the feline as muse in experimental and avant-garde film, video art, and their recent explosion on the Internet in funny cat videos, memes, and gifs.\"\n\nPeter Fischli and David Weiss, Maya Deren and Alexander Hammid, Carolee Schneemann, Joyce Wieland, Chris Marker, Mark Leckey, Cory Arcangel, Sarah Zucker, Francios Vogel, Casey Kauffmann\n\nPeter Fischli and David Weiss\n\nBüsi (Kitty), 2001\n\nVideo, color, silent, 6 minutes 30 seconds\n\nCourtesy of the artist\n\nMaya Deren and Alexander Hammid\n\nThe Private Life of a Cat, 1944\n\nDigital video (transferred from 16mm black and white film) silent, 22 minutes\n\nPrivate Life of a Cat, © Tavia Ito, courtesy of Re:Voir\n\nJoyce Wieland\n\nCatfood, 1968\n\n16mm, color, sound, 13 minutes\n\nCourtesy the New American Cinema Group\n\nChris Marker\n\nChat écoutant la musique (Cat Listening to Music) , 1990\n\nColor video, sound, 2 min 54 seconds\n\nCourtesy Electronic Arts Intermix (EAI), New York\n\nCarolee Schneemann\n\nInfinity Kisses - the Movie, 2008\n\nHD video, sound, 9 minutes, 8 seconds\n\nCourtesy the Schneemann Foundation and Electronic Arts Intermix (EAI), New York\n\nMark Leckey\n\nFelix Tail\n\nDigital video\n\nCourtesy of the artist\n\nCory Arcangel\n\nDrei Klavierstücke op. 11, 2009\n\nYoutube video with sound, 4 minutes 20 seconds\n\nCourtesy of the artist\n\nSarah Zucker\n\nSpace Loaf, 2018\n\nLooping .mp4\n\nCourtesy of the artist\n\nFrançois Vogel\n\nChat sur fond vert, 2020\n\nDigital video, 25 seconds\n\nCourtesy of the artist\n\nCasey Kauffmann\n\n#sometimesirun#sometimesihide, 2021\n\nDigital collage GIF, 1152 x 648 pixels\n\nCourtesy of the artist\n\nPainted Cat Hacker Film Credits\n\nCat played by Munchkin\n\n16mm cinematography by Peter West\n\nShot on Arriflex 16X/B 16mm camera on Kodak 7207 film\n\n16mm film processed by FotoKem Motion Picture Lab, Burbank, CA\n\nFrame by frame painting and dying by JWest\n\n16mm negative transferred to 2K by Dino Everett\n\nBackground keying by Kelsey Boncato\n\nEdited by JWest\n\nJennifer West (b.1966, Topanga, CA) is a Los Angeles-based artist who has explored materialism in film for over ten years.
