        "text": "Hey Pam,\n\nIt’s great to hear your reactions to the movie. For me, though, honestly, I was a little disappointed. Perhaps this is because I have been reading such rave reviews on stuttering forums and on stutterers’ facebook messages for weeks now that I expected more.\n\nI do have to allow for 2 things that made my viewing experience less than pleasant–when Colin Firth blocks on “I never carry money”, an older gentleman next to me audibly finished “carry money” for him. The anger I felt (and still feel at this) must be quite irrational, but I honestly felt like backhanding him across the face at the time. It didn’t ruin the experience for me, of course, but it was rather jarring, and happened relatively early in the movie. The other thing that happened was there was this woman in the row in front of me, to the right, who kept opening her smart phone and texting people, emitting a distracting glow every 15 minutes. The people immediately around her didn’t do anything, and if I had been in a calmer mood, I would have definitely tapped her on the shoulder, but for some reason, I didn’t feel like making a scene–I was already in a precarious emotional state that day, worsened by the old man, and I felt like if the woman reacted negatively to me, I might have snapped.\n\nThe other thing that sort of rubbed me the wrong way during the past couple of weeks was people all but ignoring the existence of Rocket Science or even speaking disparagingly of it, always in comparison to The King’s Speech. I personally really enjoyed Rocket Science and bawled at the end of it. It was really emotional for me, probably because it was the first movie I saw that portrayed stuttering (I did watch A Fish Called Wanda later, which was definitely not kind toward stutterers).\n\nNow on to The King’s Speech… I did well up at the opening scene, especially when they panned to the disappointed and confused faces in the audience–for me, that always made me feel worse about myself than my actual stuttering behavior.\n\nAfter that, I was really looking forward to see stuttering portrayed in its full “glory”, I suppose, and I felt that did not happen. There were no facial contortions, and the blocks always happened for about the same length of time, and were quite a lot shorter than a lot of the blocks that real stutterers experience. I have read a few news articles and listened to a few interviews from the director and producer(s) who said that they had to really balance the amount of “dead air” in the movie with keeping the plot and dialogue moving, so they could not drag the blocks out too long, but maybe one or two long blocks in the movie would have been okay and really give the audience a taste of how uncomfortable it could actually get.\n\nBeyond that, I did indeed like the relationship between the therapist and the king–it made me feel a little uncomfortable sometimes how the therapist infantilized him a little, but that might have been necessary, in the Freudian sense they were clearly trying to evoke, to bring him back to that state of childhood and re-immerse himself in those traumatic experiences and try to view himself and feel differently about himself in the present.\n\nOverall, I do think it’s a great movie to raise awareness, but at the theater I went to, it was overwhelmingly elderly people who were probably more interested in the historical aspect of it than the stuttering aspect. There was at least one person (mentioned above) who was bored enough to be texting nearly the entire time, and I did feel the pace was quite slow at times–if I was a fluent person who had absolutely no connection to stuttering, I’m not sure if I would have wanted to sit through it, unfortunately.\n\nI feel Rocket Science was different in the way that it had a coming-of-age story that I could relate to as well as the stuttering story, and it was the self-acceptance at the end that I really was drawn to. In The King’s Speech, success is definitely defined by having minimal stuttering, and having to use a lot of tips and tricks to achieve that success.\n\nPerhaps this just tells me that for movies that potentially mean a lot to me, I should wait for it to come out on DVD and then watch it by myself.\n\nI agree with every word that you say, and let me tell you, that in more ways than one, we think alike in this matter – so you can read my thoughts and get answers to your questions simply by asking yourself and the same will me my answers too\n\nI can simply use a technical term to suffice and to summarize, by saying- ‘Destigmatization of Psychiatric and Psychological issues/illnesses has long been felt as the need of the hour’\n\nOr I can share my thoughts more openly –\n\nI believe ‘Expert syndrome’ is the most common illness that infects ‘experts’ but harms ‘patients’\n\n‘Something should be endured and not be overcome’ is some doctors code for saying – we dont know much about this, and we dont know what to tell you, but we’re the experts, so if we’re not doing something, we suggest you too should do nothing\n\nMore examples can be found in medicine and Psychiatry and in every specialty, including yours\n\nAnd maybe its good? Or it could be Bad?\n\nIts what WE do with this that makes it good or bad\n\nBad because when all doors close on the outside, then a person may lose hope or may die banging his head to these closed doors\n\nGood because when all doors close on the outside, only then does the door on the Inside open, and then what happens is what you have experienced\n\nI agree that society is oblivious and insensitive and that includes us- I think its because we know we all have our weaknesses. People have laughed at our weaknesses, so in turn we come back with Vengeance when we can label someone ‘lesser’ than us and we try our best to ridicule or laugh\n\nIts like ragging\n\nSolution?\n\n1. Awareness – like this movie or ‘Taare Zameen Par’ spread\n\nIn my personal and professional capacity I keep working on this\n\n2. To be sensitive towards all, so they may learn to respond with sensitivity and sensibility\n\n3. To realize that ultimately we’re human and we will be imperfect , and we can choose to accept imperfection in others\n\n4. To inculcate ‘human’ values so we may behave more ‘humane’\n\nMaybe more? – U suggest\n\nI keep working on all these 4 points every moment – and i manage to inculcate this into most of my patients and students\n\nI havent undertaken any formal/public Activity of this nature – shall do so in time – and the time seems to have come\n\nShall see this movie and Prescribe it to many"
