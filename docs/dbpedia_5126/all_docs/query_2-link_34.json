        "text": "“The Florida Project” (2017)\n\nRobert Daniels (@812filmreviews) 812filmreviews, Mediaversity, Freelance\n\nIn the shadows of Disney World, in the grassy dilapidated remnants of the financial crisis, around a ramshackle purple motel named the Magic Castle exist Halley (Bria Vinaite) and Moonee (Brooklynn Prince): the mother-daughter duo at the center of Sean Baker’s thoughtful portrait of the ills of capitalism—”The Florida Project.”\n\nWhile intimately following his troubled protagonists, Baker discovers effective ground by not telling just another didactic tale of financial malfeasance. Instead, hanging on the periphery of Moonee and Halley’s ever-shrinking stability are the fallout signs of capitalism. The mother-daughter duo, along with the other residents who dot these motels, are some of the poorest of the have-nots. Though not legally defined as homeless, they are homeless. Restricted to moving in-and-out of rooms because of hotel managers like Bobby (Willem Dafoe, who gives an incredible performance) who don’t allow them to establish residency. Therefore, they’re unafforded all the securities of a renter.\n\nThe Abandons, a row of loudly painted half-constructed homes that Moonee and her friends frequent, also provide a garish adornment to a Floridian landscape still affected by the housing bubble. These ditched houses—a cruel irony to the homeless living in the nearby motels—lay in the shadows of Disney World. Sometimes the two universes intersect: the have and the have-nots—like the helicopter that routinely flies through the area. Where its destination is, is unimaginable to us. Other instances, include a newlywed couple who mistake the Magic Castle for the Magic Kingdom or when the prostituting Halley steals magic bands from a john. Moreover, while the haves own more capital than the have-nots, they’re also chasing a dream made of confectionery-colored castles—pining to leave their doldrums behind. It’s why they visit the Magic Kingdom. Each economic rung runs on their respective wheel, each scampering to the last bar that seems unattainable, yet ever so close. And that’s how capitalism would like you to find it: near, yet too damn far.\n\n“The Good Girls” (2018)\n\nOralia Torres (@oraleia), Cinescopia, Malvestida\n\nThe first movie that came to mind was Alejandra Marquez Abella’s “Las Niñas Bien” (“The Good Girls”). It might not take a dig at capitalism by itself, but it does explore the social dynamics that are a result of being in such system. Its carefully constructed story, loosely based on Guadalupe Loaeza’s satirical book of the same name, echoes and reflects back our present fears and desires regarding social mobility and identity, intertwined to social and economical class.\n\nThe movie presents Sofia (a brilliant Ilse Salas), a Mexican socialite whose identity is built around being a rich wife. This image and sense of self that starts to shatter once she’s affected by the economic crisis produced by president José López Portillo’s economic plans. Although the movie is sympathetic to her plight and presents all the limitations of her golden cage, the script doesn’t absolve her of her faults; her relationship with newcomer Ana Paula (Paulina Gaitán) carefully presents the class anxiety that still breathes today and how each character adapts to survive, both financial ruin and social status. The feminine perspective adds another layer of analysis that is often ignored in other movies that deal with these themes, and if that’s not an enough sell for you, consider the beautiful recreation of life in Mexico City during the 80s, without an inch of nostalgia.\n\n“Pain and Gain” (2013)\n\nClint Worthington (@clintworthing), Consequence of Sound, The Spool\n\n2013 was the Year of Greed in the world of cinema: “Spring Breakers,” “The Wolf of Wall Street,” “The Bling Ring,” and others worked to crystallize our post-recession disdain for the trappings and sociopathy of wealth and opulence. But mark my words, none of those films that year hold a candle to — wait for it — Michael Bay’s “Pain & Gain.”\n\nA nasty, garish, mean-spirited dark comedy based on the true story of the Sun Gym Gang, a group of bodybuilders who went on an extortion and murder spree, is somehow the best Michael Bay movie to date and the perfect mirror to American capitalism’s worst impulses. Bay’s long been derided as a ‘dumb’ filmmaker, but “Pain & Gain” proved that his crassness is the product of design rather than ignorance. Made for a modest (for Bay) $35 million, “Pain & Gain” filters the saturated, noisy aesthetic of Bay through the skewed perspectives of its leads, a trio of toxically-masculine gym rats (Mark Wahlberg, Dwayne Johnson, Anthony Mackie) who recognize that the only way you can achieve social mobility in this day and age is to become a criminal.\n\nMany critics lambasted it at the time for being, as Mark Kermode put it, “every bit as pumped up and steroidal as the appalling characters it is attempting to portray.” But that’s the point; Bay is so refreshingly committed to the bit, never risking a single wink save for one uproarious moment where he stops the film to remind you “THIS IS STILL A TRUE STORY,” that you’re fully immersed in the grotesque end result of capitalism’s pull to acquire at any cost. Michael Bay’s films take on a new dimension when you realize he hates his audience, and never is that clearer than in the full-fingered implication of the audience at the end: these silly characters you’ve been laughing at are real, and so were their victims. Yes it’s absurd, but so’s capitalism.\n\n“The Pursuit of Happyness” (2006)\n\nDon Shanahan (@casablancadon), Every Movie Has a Lesson, 25YL, and Medium.com\n\nAs soon as this survey question used the word “powerful,” my answer became clear from the field of potential choices: Gabriele Muccino’s “The Pursuit of Happyness” from 2006 soars above all others for me. Its slice of the American Dream pits fledgling entrepreneurship versus corportate success with family solidarity caught in the middle. Bolstered by the Oscar-nominated best performance of Will Smith’s career (he just had to be robbed by Forrest Whitaker) beside his own son Jaden, the tale of Chris Gardner was perfectly compelling for portraying its time period and showing who our own recent generations carry the same stuggles. As melodramatic as that may be, the movie’s tightrope act of risks between white collar dreams and homeless realities are conveyed solidly with compassion and conviction. Those are two traits that many arenas of capitalism could use. The uplift it generates is more than earned and more than welcome.\n\n“Sorry to Bother You” (2018)\n\nRoxana Hadadi (@roxana_hadadi), Pajiba, Chesapeake Family magazine, The A.V. Club\n\nEven before that twist, Boots Riley’s “Sorry to Bother You” is an incisive portrait of the hopelessness and helplessness of being working-class in America. Every penny spent is a consideration, a realization that the money going out of your wallet doesn’t equal the money coming in. Bosses can’t be trusted — for all their preaching about workers being family, they’re also willing to cut out anyone who won’t stay in line. The lure of selling out your own principles and those of your friends for just a little bit more in each paycheck is undeniably high. And even if you reject the daily grind of an office job, a career in the arts, one in which you have to leverage and sell elements of yourself to secure authenticity, can be just as soul-sapping.\n\nRiley’s “Sorry to Bother You” captures all the ways late-stage capitalism infects all of us, whatever way you choose to live, and its depiction of class struggle starts out modest — just one group of coworkers going on strike to secure better pay — before spiraling into something more ambitious about our bodies and the labor they provide. Few films have delivered rallying cries this clear to viewers: That if you don’t stand up for each other, no one will.\n\n“Support the Girls” (2018)\n\nSarah Welch-Larson (@dodgyboffin), Bright Wall/Dark Room, Think Christian\n\nFor my money, “Support the Girls” (2018) is one of the best stories about the pressures of late capitalism in recent memory. Regina Hall, Shayna McHale, and Haley Lu Richardson deliver excellent performances in this slice of life comedy (!) about a single day spent working in a Hooters knockoff restaurant, dealing with a racist and sexist boss and customers. The business ostensibly provides them with money, but will only give them the bare minimum needed to survive. This film recognizes that money troubles are only one part of living in a capitalist society: gender, race, class, access to childcare, and family situations all play a part in a capitalist landscape, one that is set up to benefit those who already have money and resources available to them, while leaving everyone else behind. Somehow “Support the Girls” manages to capture the pressures and anxiety of being a woman (especially a woman of color) working in a field that is notorious for underpaying and burning out its workforce, and it manages to do so without demeaning or dehumanizing any of its characters, all with a genuinely funny, touching tone.\n\n“Us” (2019)\n\nEthan Warren (@EthanRAWarren), Bright Wall/Dark Room\n\nGiven how quickly the world changes these days, and how those shifts influence the social conditions tackled by capitalist commentary, it’s easy for anything more than a few years old to feel quaint. So I’m tempted to pick the intensely of-the-moment “Parasite,” which does feel like a uniquely acidic response to what Jia Tolentino hauntingly refers to in “Trick Mirror” as the modern “dead-end sense of [one’s] own ethical brokenness.”\n\nBut to skirt recency bias just a bit, I’ll look to the movie that I (and probably many others) couldn’t help thinking of during Bong’s masterpiece: Jordan Peele’s “Us.” The movie has been criticized for fuzzy allegory and inexplicable twists, but I consider that dream logic a virtue—Peele spins a vision hazy enough to nag the viewer all the way home, and loose enough to let that viewer “solve” it on their own terms, and likely not enjoy whatever they may realize in the process.\n\nIf it feels like “Us” has fallen off the cultural radar since the spring, I’d imagine that comes down to its refusal to allow any viewer (at least one comfortable enough to buy a movie ticket) the relief of feeling absolved of complicity. Peele’s villainous force is a faceless conspiracy the average American can hardly comprehend, let alone combat, and if the movie serves as a reminder that we’re all tethered to that system, it also rubs our noses in all the comfortable ways we sublimate that awareness. The movie is a giddy joy, but no popcorn entertainment in recent memory has been so outright damning of, well, us (at least a lot of us), and if that means it goes down smooth before causing immediate indigestion, then that strikes me as the mark of an excellent, and important, work of art.\n\n“The Wolf of Wall Street” (2013)\n\nJoanna Langfield (@JoannaLangfield), The Movie Minute\n\nWhile Adam McKay’s “The Big Short” seems like an obvious answer, I’d like to register an also-ran for Scorsese’s “Wolf of Wall Street”. While McKay inserted those handy explanation asides, giving those of us non-investment bankers a shot at understanding the language of just what the hell happened when the economy hit the fan, Scorsese focused more on the lives of the self-appointed superheroes who got us into the mess to begin with.\n\nHyped up and full throttle, the wolves were driven, almost blinded by the\n\n“greed is good” approach to life. We, too, enjoy their success, the parties, boats, and glamour. Of course, it all goes wrong and we watch as our high fliers crash along with the rest of the economy. Would their fall have been as humbling had they not been so desperately hungry for the possibilities a Capitalist society dangles before our eyes? Watching it all, who wouldn’t feel a bit humbled themselves, owning up to our own initial temptations as well as understanding their ramifications.\n\n“The World of Tomorrow” (2015)\n\nLuke Hicks (@lou_kicks), Film School Rejects, The Playlist, Polygon\n\nDon Hertzfeldt’s “World of Tomorrow” is only 17 minutes long, but it packs more anti-capitalist punch per minute than any film in recent memory while weaving in philosophical affirmation as to why life is worth living (without sugarcoating the reality of the existential hole that ebbs and flows perpetually in our chests). Experimental, stream-of-consciousness thought bursts from its wildly original dystopian vision, which is intricately constructed from nuanced social, mental, political, and economic critiques of capitalism and the cold, class-based cruelty that can stem from it. Ruminations on time, memory, and humanity undergird the sharp commentary, implanting an ontological hope in the soul of those that heed its central wisdom: “Do not lose time on daily trivialities. Do not dwell on petty detail. For all of these things melt away and drift apart within the obscure traffic of time. Live well and live broadly. You are alive and living now. Now is the envy of all of the dead.”\n\nQuestion: What is the best movie currently playing in theaterss?\n\nAnswer: “Parasite”"
