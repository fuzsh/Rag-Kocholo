        "text": "In the 1970s, the Blaxploitation Era gave American independent cinema a generation of Black films and filmmakers larger and more influential than had ever been seen before. Over 200 Blaxploitation films were made in under a decade, and though it was a short-lived period, it had a profound influence on American and global culture. The Blaxploitation movies were a lightning rod for a new generation of Black filmmakers who took the aesthetic and philosophical foundations of the movement and built upon it to tell the stories of their own generation. Their films reached new audiences, told bold new stories, and reshaped the look of American movies forever. This was the Black New Wave.\n\nThe Black New Wave is an informal name given to the generation of films made by Black filmmakers through the late 1980s and 1990s. Many consider the 1986 film SHE’S GOTTA HAVE IT, written, produced, edited and directed by Spike Lee, as the kicking off point for this period. The film premiered in the Director’s Fortnight section of the Cannes Film Festival, and grossed over $7 million from its $175,000 budget. Added to the US National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 2019, the film showed Black romance and sexuality in a light not seen before, and catalyzed Brooklyn’s Fort Greene neighborhood as a vibrant, cosmopolitan community for Black Americans. By the time Lee followed up with 1988’s SCHOOL DAZE and his 1989 masterpiece DO THE RIGHT THING, the Black New Wave was well and truly underway. And with the 1991 release of BOYZ N THE HOOD, written and directed by John Singleton, the movement had spread across America. Boyz n the Hood was the first debut feature for a Black filmmaker backed by a major studio (Columbia Pictures), and had its premiere in the Un Certain Regard section of the Cannes Film Festival, before grossing over $57.5 million from its $6.5 million budget and earning Academy Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Director (Singleton was both the youngest person and the first Black person nominated for the award).\n\nThe explosion of Black filmmakers making movies that grabbed the attention of audiences across America and the world sparked excitement for audiences, filmmakers and studios alike. The same year as Boyz n the Hood was released, NEW JACK CITY, directed by Mario Van Peebles (son of Melvin, whose directorial effort SWEET SWEETBACK’S BAADASSSSS SONG sparked the Blaxploitation movement), grossed over $47 million from its $8 million budget, and over 19 films directed by Black filmmakers were theatrically released in America (almost as many as in the previous decade). Inevitably, people began to speculate whether the Black New Wave would accomplish what the Blaxploitation movement was not able to – could it lead to sustained opportunities for Black filmmakers?\n\nIn July 1991, New York Times Magazine published an article titled They’ve Gotta Have Us, speculating on whether Hollywood would learn how to market and promote films by Black filmmakers, and whether these filmmakers would be allowed to become a part of Hollywood’s power structure. In it, Spike Lee commented that this period was “a critical time for Black cinema, which, really, is in its infancy. This opportunity brings with it a special responsibility… if one Black filmmaker messes up, the rest of us will be made to feel it.” Despite his warning, Hollywood was confident. Critic Roger Ebert wrote in his essay It’s High Tide for Black New Wave that the Black New Wave had separated itself from Blaxploitation films by considering the Black experience in its own complex terms, without relying on sex and violence as its currency. Charles Lane, director of films such as SIDEWALK STORIES and TRUE IDENTITY, claimed that the industry had turned a corner in race relations, saying that “the Berlin Wall, having been pulled down, will not be re-erected.” What optimists about the Black New Wave failed to include in their analysis of the era was the depth of the embedded racism in the structures of the film business. Lack of financiers and decision makers who were Black cost Black filmmakers when interest in their films started to wane, the same way it happened in the 70s. Black filmmakers had trouble escaping the perception from executives and studios that the success of their work was a fad, rather than a reflection of the underserved tastes of the American and global filmgoing audiences. 18 years after that article, The New York Times interviewed Julie Dash, Matty Rich, Darnell Martin, Ernest Dickerson, Leslie Harris and Theodore Witcher. The filmmakers spoke of broken studio promises, executives who feared filmmakers with outspoken political beliefs, and an industry that decided to reconstitute itself around white directors and white casts by the late 1990s.\n\nWhat has not faded, however, is the impact and legacy of these filmmakers, both in front of and behind the camera. The Black New Wave has made a lasting impression on American cinema, both in terms of the artists whose work has continued to embed itself in our culture, as well as the aesthetic choices that have changed how movies looked ever since. Beyond the subjects, storytelling and figures at the heart of the movement, the Black New Wave had a profound influence on the aesthetics of cinema. The movement spanned all genres from drama to comedy, action to hard-boiled thriller, romance and horror. And within it all, Black New Wave filmmakers brought bold visual choices to their work, and gave audiences and filmmakers around the world a new vision of what a movie could look like.\n\nHere are some of the ways that the Black New Wave changed how movies look."
