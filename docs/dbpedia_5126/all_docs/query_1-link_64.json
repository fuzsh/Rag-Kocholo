        "text": "Introduction\n\nThis report examines the ways in which Beijing’s censors have affected and influenced Hollywood and the global filmmaking industry. Stories shape the way people think, and the stories told by Hollywood reach billions. As an anti-censorship organization dedicated to the celebration of open cultural and artistic expression, PEN America has sought to understand how one of the world’s most censorious regimes is extending its influence over the global locus for filmmaking here in the United States, shaping what is perhaps the world’s most influential artistic and cultural medium.\n\nPEN America defends and celebrates freedom of expression in the United States and globally. Our work has included a decades-long advocacy engagement on China, where dozens of members of our sister PEN organization—the Independent Chinese PEN Center—have been imprisoned or persecuted by Beijing. The most influential of those colleagues was Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo, who was serving an 11-year prison sentence for his writings when he died of liver cancer. Our work has involved advocacy campaigns, detailed research reports, literary exchanges, and other efforts aimed at pushing back against Beijing’s censorship policies and its criminalization of dissent.\n\nOver the last decade or more, as Beijing has expanded its global role as a world power, leading trade partner, sovereign investor, and cultural influence, these domestic patterns of censorship and control have extended beyond China’s borders. Beijing’s rising global influence has meant that the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) approach to censorship is making itself felt by publishers, authors, scholars, writers, journalists, and others who address topics of interest to China, regardless of their citizenship or where they are based. In 2015, PEN America documented Chinese publishers’ censorship of Chinese-language translations of foreign authors in our report Censorship and Conscience: Foreign Authors and the Challenge of Chinese Censorship. In 2016, we analyzed the CCP’s efforts to affect foreign media’s coverage of the country in Darkened Screen: Constraints on Foreign Journalists in China, and its enforced disappearance of five publishers (including two with foreign citizenship) connected to a Hong Kong bookstore in Writing on the Wall: Disappeared Booksellers and Free Expression in Hong Kong. In 2018, our research on social media censorship in China for Forbidden Feeds: Government Controls on Social Media in China included an analysis of how Beijing’s digital censorship affected users of Chinese digital platforms even when they were outside the country.\n\nWe have seen this exportation of censorious pressure elsewhere, so much so that there is a long—and growing longer—list of examples from the last few years alone: the major academic publisher Cambridge University Press attempting to pull titles from access by Chinese audience due to fear of CCP retaliation; the consistent degradation of press freedoms and civil liberties in Hong Kong; New Zealand publishers finding their books censored by Chinese printers; academics and students across the globe facing intimidation when they speak out on issues the CCP considers sensitive; and global brands forced to apologize simply for printing the words “Taiwan” or “the Dalai Lama.”\n\nIncreasingly, Beijing’s economic clout has allowed it to insist that others comply with its censorship strictures—or has led others to voluntarily internalize these strictures, even without being asked—as a prerequisite to doing business with or in the country. While individual compromises may seem minor or worthwhile in exchange for the opportunity to engage with China’s population, the collective global implications of playing by Beijing’s rules need to be recognized and understood before acquiescence to Chinese censorship becomes a new normal in countries that have prided themselves for their staunch free speech protections.\n\nHollywood is an important bellwether. The Chinese government, under Xi Jinping especially, has heavily emphasized its desire to ensure that Hollywood filmmakers—to use their preferred phrase—“tell China’s story well.” Within the pages of this report, we detail how Hollywood decision-makers and other filmmaking professionals are increasingly making decisions about their films—the content, casting, plot, dialogue, and settings—based on an effort to avoid antagonizing Chinese officials who control whether their films gain access to the booming Chinese market.\n\nAs U.S. film studios compete for the opportunity to access Chinese audiences, many are making difficult and troubling compromises on free expression: changing the content of films intended for international—including American—audiences; engaging in self-censorship; agreeing to provide a censored version of a movie for screening in China; and in some instances directly inviting Chinese government censors onto their film sets to advise them on how to avoid tripping the censors’ wires. These concessions to the power of the Chinese market have happened mostly quietly, with little attention and, often, little debate. Steadily, a new set of mores has taken hold in Hollywood, one in which appeasing Chinese government investors and gatekeepers has simply become a way of doing business.\n\nThe Stakes for the Film Industry and for Artistic Expression in Filmmaking\n\nFilmmaking is a business. While storytelling, creativity, artistry, and self-expression are essential to entertainment, studios exist to sell films and make a profit. But in so doing, Hollywood exercises outsized influence over global society and culture through the power of its creations. Stories shape the way people think, and the stories told by Hollywood reach billions. If the hand of a foreign government is dictating the parameters of what can be told or shown, and if filmmakers are incorporating a made-in-Beijing set of prerequisites as they conceive and produce films, at the very least these dictates should be understood and debated, so that the commercial, artistic, and expressive trade-offs are understood.\n\nIt is worth acknowledging that the United States government has benefitted from, encouraged, and at times even directed Hollywood filmmaking as an exercise in soft power, including through the promotion of films that offer a “patriotic” message specifically to Americans. The Hollywood-Pentagon relationship, especially—on view in such blockbusters as Contact (South Side Amusement Company, 1997) and Hulk (Universal Pictures, 2003)—continues today, with the U.S. Department of Defense offering conditional access to military facilities and experts to Hollywood films that it believes will reflect well on the country’s armed forces. But this governmental influence does not bring to bear a heavy-handed system of institutionalized censorship, as Beijing’s does.\n\nAt least more recently, in fact, Hollywood movies have not hesitated to criticize America’s political leaders, to the point where some Americans have argued that filmmakers and film stars are unpatriotic. Major studio movies like Vice (Gary Sanchez Productions, Plan B Entertainment, & Annapurna Pictures, 2018), The Hurt Locker (Voltage Pictures et al., 2008), and The Report (VICE Studios et al., 2019) send up the political powers that be at the highest echelons of American government. Today, Hollywood enjoys a reputation as a place uncowed by Washington, and one that is often gleefully willing to speak truth to American political power. This reputation contrasts strangely but silently with Hollywood’s increasing acceptance of the need to conform to Beijing’s film dictates.\n\nAdditionally, if Hollywood—the center of global filmmaking—is unwilling to stand up to the censorship demands of a foreign government, there is little chance that filmmakers elsewhere will take such risks. In effect, Hollywood’s approach to acceding to Chinese dictates is setting a standard for the rest of the world.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, we have developed this report on Beijing’s influence over Hollywood because we believe this influence cannot be ethically decoupled from the Chinese government’s practices of suppressing freedom of expression at home. Beijing enforces one of the world’s most restrictive censorship systems, in which films and other creative endeavors are subject to a strict process of pre-publication review by the State. China’s media is similarly under state control, with little-to-no space for editorial independence. Vast categories of protected expression are criminalized, with peaceful dissidents serving years-long jail terms for their critical speech.\n\nIndependent civil society does not exist within mainland China, and the country’s Great Firewall represents the world’s most advanced and expansive system of digital censorship. In the areas of Tibet and Xinjiang, the repression of civil rights is breathtakingly severe; in Xinjiang especially, it is no exaggeration to say that millions of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities are in detention camps or jail because the government has essentially criminalized their cultural and religious expression in the region. Yet, China’s own government-controlled domestic press either refuses to cover this systemic violation of human rights, or instead propagandistically and falsely reframes it as an exercise in “vocational education.” Beijing’s imposition of near-total barriers to access for Western reporters in those regions, meanwhile, helps ensure that this narrative is unchallenged.\n\nIn short, the Chinese government works tirelessly to ensure that the only stories told within China are ones that it specifically approves. Beijing’s influence over Hollywood is part of this work, creating a climate of self-censorship that renders filmmakers unwilling or unable to criticize the decisions of a government that regulates the lives of over 1.4 billion people and that increasingly dominates the global conversation. There are stories about China that deserve to be told, but the space to tell such stories is rapidly diminishing in Hollywood. The implications of such self-censorship are tremendous.\n\nToday, Chinese censors are playing a role in determining the content or message of movies that are released worldwide: this represents the risk that only movies that please one of the world’s most censorious regimes find their way to movie screens across the globe.\n\nChina’s Film Censorship System\n\nChina’s ruling Chinese Communist Party has long imposed a censorship system over all forms of media and entertainment, including books, television, film, radio, news media, and social media. Beijing operates the world’s largest, most comprehensive, and most sophisticated system of state censorship. It does so with an avowedly political intent. Many of the regulations were developed under the justification of promoting the national interest: to support “social stability,” for example, or to stop the spread of “malicious rumors.” However, these restrictions often explicitly protect and benefit the interests of the Party and the country’s political leadership.\n\nAs part of this systematic censorship, the Chinese government imposes a strict pre-publication review system for all films, and retains the right to ban any film that does not comply from being shown in theaters—or even from streaming online—within the country. This institutionalized system of censorship applies both to domestic and foreign films.\n\nIn 2016, China’s National People’s Congress passed the Film Industry Promotion Law, the first national law on film in China. The Law formalized many of the government’s long-standing regulatory policies, including many of their policies around censorship. Article 16 of the law—which came into effect in March 2017—sets out a fairly comprehensive list of the content that Beijing bans from its film screens.\n\n(1) violations of the basic principles of the Constitution, incitement of resistance to or undermining of implementation of the Constitution, laws, or administrative regulations;\n\n(2) endangerment of the national unity, sovereignty or territorial integrity; leaking state secrets; endangering national security; harming national dignity, honor or interests; advocating terrorism or extremism;\n\n(3) belittling exceptional ethnic cultural traditions, incitement of ethnic hatred or ethnic discrimination, violations of ethnic customs, distortion of ethnic history or ethnic historical figures, injuring ethnic sentiments or undermining ethnic unity;\n\n(4) inciting the undermining of national religious policy, advocating cults or superstitions;\n\n(5) endangerment of social morality, disturbing social order, undermining social stability; promoting pornography, gambling, drug use, violence, or terror; instigation of crimes or imparting criminal methods;\n\n(6) violations of the lawful rights and interests of minors or harming the physical and psychological health of minors;\n\n(7) insults of defamation of others, or spreading others’ private information and infringement of others’ lawful rights and interests;\n\n(8) other content prohibited by laws or administrative regulations.\n\nMany of these prohibited categories, such as “harming national interests,” “endangering national security,” and “disturbing social order” are terms employed by Chinese authorities as political weapons against critics, dissidents, and others who are perceived to threaten the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s political goals. These terms have their analogs in the nation’s criminal codes, which are used to punish speech and other acts of peaceful advocacy.\n\nFor example, the rhetoric of “endangering national unity” is commonly employed against ethnic minorities who dare to advocate for their people’s collective rights. Examples include Inner Mongolian historian Lhamjab Borjigin, under house arrest for “sabotaging national unity” for compiling the oral histories of Inner Mongolian people’s experiences under the Cultural Revolution; Tibetan language-rights advocate Tashi Wangchuk, serving a five-year sentence for “inciting separatism” after participating in a New York Times article about his peaceful advocacy; and Uyghur academic Ilham Tohti, serving life imprisonment for “separatism” after dedicating his career to peacefully promoting Uyghur rights. These are only a few examples of such cases.\n\nSimilarly, allegations of disrupting the public order or subverting state power have been levied as criminal charges against some of China’s most prominent human rights defenders, from human rights lawyer Xu Zhiyong to Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo. These criminal charges commonly result in years-long imprisonment terms. Meanwhile, in the name of such terms as “social morality,” Beijing has implemented a wide-ranging ban on LGBTQ+ portrayals.\n\nIn all, these vague and overbroad prohibitions are inherently threatening to international guarantees of freedom of expression, and thus incompatible with Beijing’s obligations under international law. Furthermore, Beijing’s usage of these broad categories as weapons against its critics reveal how it has weaponized these vague and innocuous sounding terms, and how these categories of banned content connect directly to the government’s criminalization of dissent.\n\nRegulators will episodically publish updated guidelines that further codify—and often expand—the list of prohibited subjects or themes. But commentators commonly note that no published list covers all of the “no-go” areas for the CCP, that the rules constantly shift, and that no filmmaker can ever entirely be certain what is prohibited and what is allowed. The strategic ambiguity leads to constant speculation as to why any specific film is accepted or rejected.\n\nThe overarching goal of this censorship is to prevent stories or messages that the censors deem a threat to the supremacy of the CCP and to Beijing’s sovereignty and sense of nationalism. But Beijing’s censorship has an affirmative as well as a negative dimension. In addition to knowing what redlines cannot be crossed, filmmakers are encouraged and rewarded for promoting storylines that reinforce preferred government narratives. Censors push filmmakers to assume an actively propagandistic role on behalf of the Party, a tactic which censors euphemistically refer to as “telling China’s story well.”\n\nThe 2016 Film Industry Promotion Law makes this propagandistic element of Beijing’s approach to film explicit, albeit couched in the type of bureaucratic jargon that the CCP euphemistically employs. Article 36 of the Law declares that among the types of films the Chinese state supports are “major films that transmit the glorious Chinese culture or promote core socialist values.” Again, this Law merely represents a legislative formulation of what was already CCP policy.\n\nBeijing’s film censorship is dynamic: the rules can shift in response to the government’s priorities of the day, and censorship can worsen or lighten up depending on a multitude of factors. Sam Voutas, an Australian actor and filmmaker who has made several films in China, described film censorship to PEN America as a “pendulum,” elaborating that “historically speaking, there’s a tightening, followed by a loosening, followed by another tightening.” This dynamism means that Chinese leaders are easily able to lift its restrictions—if and when they want to.\n\nBlacklisting and Fear of Retaliation\n\nHollywood’s largest companies are multinational corporations. Most are subsidiaries of sprawling conglomerates whose business interests span the globe, and who stand to lose billions if the Chinese government—the gatekeeper to the world’s most populous nation and its second-largest economy—chooses to punish them.\n\nStudio parent companies have a slate of Chinese business interests. Disney, for example, has a 47 percent stake in the Shanghai Disneyland Park, which opened in 2016 and which cost over $5.5 billion to build. Universal Studios, meanwhile, is planning to open the Universal Beijing Resort next year—complete with two theme parks, six hotels, a waterpark, and an entertainment complex—with construction reportedly continuing even during the coronavirus pandemic. The price tag for the resort complex is $6.5 billion, and will be co-owned by Universal and Beijing Shouhuan Cultural Tourism Investment, a coalition of Chinese state-owned companies.\n\nAll of these business pressures combine so that, in the words of University of California Los Angeles Professor Michael Berry, Hollywood studios “would be silly not to address the censors. The Hollywood companies are increasingly savvy and increasingly paranoid. Instituting self-censorship is the way to go, especially as the big mainstream blockbusters need China . . . Hollywood has internalized these self-censorship mechanisms.” Berry, speaking to PEN America, elaborated that “lots of these broadcast and media companies have their hands in many different pies, so why jeopardize big business ventures for 90 seconds” of content that could just as easily be cut?” This attitude is particularly the case for the major studios, Berry added, who “know the rules and are already playing by them.”\n\nThese business interests, along with the incentives for studios to play nice with Chinese regulators, may help explain why some studios even self-censor movies that are unlikely to ever make it into Chinese theaters—movies like Red Dawn (Contrafilm, 2012) or Top Gun: Maverick (Skydance Media et al., 2020), vehicles for a distinctly American nationalist vision.\n\nThe fear that angering China on one project can hurt business interests elsewhere is not limited to studios; it is shared by producers, writers, and other Hollywood professionals. And this anxiety over possible punishment is the handmaiden of self-censorship. “If you come up with a project that is actively critical” of China, one Hollywood producer who has worked with larger studios said to PEN America, the fear is that “you or your company will actively be blacklisted, and they will interfere with your current or future project. So not only will you bear the brunt [of your decision], but also your company, and future companies that you work for. And that’s absolutely in the back of our minds.”\n\nYet another producer, who has worked on several projects with Chinese backing, put it more succinctly: “Most people do not burn China, because there’s an expectation of ‘I’ll never work again.’”\n\nOne specific thread of this concern is the fear that Beijing could retaliate against specific people by blacklisting them, refusing them future entry into China, and/or declaring them persona non grata for Chinese production partners or CPD censors evaluating movies in which they appear so that they become radioactive to any studio. There is no public record of a formal blacklist, but CPP institutions occasionally reference its existence as a formal document, and it is widely believed to exist.\n\nHigh-profile examples of presumed-blacklisted members of the film world include actress Sharon Stone, actress/singer Selena Gomez, actor Harrison Ford, and Richard Gere. In these cases, the blacklist has been avowedly political, reportedly occurring after the actors participated in films critical of China or simply in events that the CCP frowned upon, such as a photo opportunity with the exiled Dalai Lama.\n\nMost publicly, Richard Gere has alleged that he has since paid a significant professional price for his long-standing activism on Tibet, saying in one 2017 interview that “There are definitely movies that I can’t be in because the Chinese will say, ‘Not with him’. . . . I recently had an episode where someone said they could not finance a film with me because it would upset the Chinese.”\n\nAnd while each of these actors has sufficient fame and fortune to weather the blacklist to varying extents, that is not the case for all working Hollywood professionals, with some concluding that being blacklisted would represent a professional death knell.\n\nThis blacklisting varies greatly in severity and length—sometimes its decades, but more often it’s a visa denial or a stern verbal warning to a producer or executive, for example, not to work with a certain actor or screenwriter because he or she is “not friendly” to China. And it’s not static. Brad Pitt, widely believed to have been blacklisted for starring in Seven Years in Tibet (Mandalay Entertainment, 1997), joined his then-wife Angelina Jolie on a promotional tour in China for Disney’s Maleficent (Walt Disney Pictures & Roth Films, 2014) in 2014, and in 2016 visited to promote his movie Allied (Huahua Media, GK Films, & ImageMovers, 2016) which was released there.\n\nEven so, Beijing seems to encourage the perception that it engages in routine blacklisting and punishment of film professionals who contravene the Party’s will. To entrench this fear among filmmakers, they will encourage “offenders” to admit their “mistakes” as a cautionary tale to others, in keeping with a long-standing axiom of Chinese governance, “Leniency for those who confess, severity for those who resist.”\n\nAs an example, the director of Seven Years in Tibet, Jean Jacques Annaud, was believed to be blacklisted for his involvement in the project. Over a decade later, in 2009, Annaud was tapped to direct the French-Chinese joint production Wolf Totem (China Film Co. et al., 2015). In a Sina Weibo (China’s largest blogging platform) publicity page that Annaud apparently set up to chronicle his work on the movie, he released a letter essentially apologizing for his participation in Seven Years in Tibet. In his letter, Annaud “solemnly declared” that he “never participated in any Tibet-related organization or association . . . never supported Tibetan independence, and never had any private contact with the Dalai Lama, and moreover, becoming friends with him is out of the question.” This apology letter is now inaccessible to the public, having subsequently been placed under restricted viewing by someone with access to Annaud’s Weibo account, but PEN America has reproduced an archived copy of the letter along with our English translation below.\n\n阿诺：西藏是中国领土的一部分\n\n(2009-12-28 16:48:38)\n\n转载▼\n\n阿诺最新博文：有关《西藏七年》和《狼图腾》\n\n十五年前，美国哥伦比亚电影制片公司决定投资将德国作家Heinrich Harrer的一本畅销自传体小说《西藏七年》拍成电影搬上银幕。我在该电影项目中担任导演。故事讲述的是一名德国登山运动员与一位孩子（现在的达赖喇嘛）的相遇，相识。没有想到的是这部电影播映后使我的中国朋友受到了某种民族情感上的伤害。这一直都是令我很痛心的事情。\n\n在那个双方缺乏交流沟通的时期，由于缺乏对中国历史和文化的透彻了解，我无法预想到这部影片播映后在中国产生的不良影响，对此我深表歉意。其实，在这部影片中我最终的本意是想传达“和平”的意愿，但事与愿违，对此我深感遗憾。\n\n还有一些误解我想在此澄清。我是一个文化活动的热衷者，经常被邀请参加犹太文化，伊斯兰教文化和基督教文化的纪念活动等。去年我还参加了在法国中部举行的佛教文化开幕式。我每次被邀都很荣兴，但这并不代表我信仰他们的宗教和文化。我是个无神论者，我自己一直坚定的信仰是：平等，独立和自由（这也许与我现实中的一些“中庸”举动相反）。\n\n在此我必须郑重声明：我从来没有想过要加入任何宗教，并且我从来没有参加过任何跟西藏有关的组织和协会。事实上，我一直尊重国际公约的规定，承认西藏是属于中国领土的一部分。我从来没有支持过西藏独立，也没有与达赖喇嘛有过私人的交往，更加谈不上是他的朋友。我希望得到大家的理解和对事实的尊重，因为我希望成为你们真正的朋友，可以放心敞开彼此心扉的朋友，因为我想人类的每一颗心灵都是惧怕孤独的。\n\n我现在正在积极的筹备，准备把姜戎先生的《狼图腾》搬上银幕。我希望通过这个“人与自然”的美丽故事，传递一种人世间以及宇宙间万物生灵间相互的理解和尊重。向全世界的观众展现一幅有关现代中国的巨型和谐画面，用美丽的自然风光和丰富的物种情感，使更多的人更加热爱中国，更加热爱中国人民精神的博大精深。\n\n真诚的：让－雅克－阿诺\n\nCensorship and Self-Censorship for Movies\n\nIt is no secret that international films, when screened before Chinese audiences, are often missing content—that certain scenes, lines of dialogue, or shots will have been removed at the censors’ behest. This is the most obvious way that China’s censors exercise their power: providing an ultimatum to studios that certain content must be cut or edited from the master version of the film in order to be allowed at all before Chinese theatergoers.\n\nAs a result, some of Hollywood’s most famous movies exist in an altered, censored China-release version. Mission: Impossible III (Cruise/Wagner Productions, 2006), for example, was released in China with several small scenes excised, such as a scene where protagonist Ethan Hunt kills a Chinese henchman as well as a visual where the viewer can see a clothesline hanging from a Shanghai apartment airing tattered underwear. For James Bond’s Skyfall (Sony Pictures, 2012), censors demanded a scene be cut where a Chinese security guard is killed, as well as references to sex work and police torture. In a previous James Bond movie, Casino Royale (Eon Productions et al., 2006), actress Judi Dench revealed that she had to re-dub one of her lines for the movie’s Chinese release, changing “Christ, I miss the Cold War” to “God, I miss the old times.”\n\nBeijing’s censors commonly demand that kisses between same-sex characters disappear, in movies like Cloud Atlas (Warner Brothers Pictures, 2013), Star Trek Beyond (Paramount Pictures, 2016), and Alien: Covenant (Twentieth Century Fox, 2017); they also demanded the removal of several scenes about the sexuality of Queen lead singer Freddie Mercury from the biopic Bohemian Rhapsody (Twentieth Century Fox, 2018).\n\nThese examples are illustrative of a widespread pattern, whereby the censors insist on changes, and studios—as well as directors, actors, and others needed to implement the changes—accede.\n\nThis posture of cooperation with Beijing-requested cuts is now so unremarkable, that it makes the news when a member of the Hollywood elite publicly refuses to participate. This is what happened with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (Columbia Pictures et al., 2019). The movie, directed by Quentin Tarantino, was pulled from China’s movie release schedule only a week before the film was slated to be released within the country, reportedly in response to the movie’s insufficiently heroic depiction of Bruce Lee. Tarantino, who reserved the right in his contract to approve the final cut of the movie, refused to recut the film to appease China’s National Film Administration, nixing the movie’s chances of a China release. The news made entertainment headlines. “When the story of a director refusing to participate is newsworthy, you know that this is a pervasive phenomenon,” concluded screenwriter Howard Rodman, speaking to PEN America.\n\nAs Tarantino’s refusal demonstrates, directors, producers, and studios all have leverage to refuse to allow their films to be distributed in censored form. But, as public reporting indicates and as Hollywood insiders PEN America spoke with affirmed, studios often put considerations of market access and revenue ahead of the defense of creative freedom.\n\nAnd of course, as an industry leader, Tarantino is an outlier in his ability both to insist on final approval rights and to resist studio pressure to conform. Many other directors—especially new or emerging directors—may feel they lack leverage when faced with an ultimatum from studio executives demanding a censored China cut for their film.\n\nChina is far from the only country to censor foreign films—other prominent offenders include Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and Turkey. In fact, both democracies and dictatorships, liberal and illiberal governments have film censorship. But, because of the size of its market, China is the only country that can effectively wield its economic clout in order to compel substantial cooperation from Hollywood studios. In place of amateur cuts done after the fact by bureaucrats, often without the consent or even knowledge of the movie’s directors and producers, the Chinese government can insist that Hollywood studios do their dirty work for them, producing edits and alterations that more effectively hide the fact that the movie had been censored.\n\nStudios Engage in Informal Dialogue with Censors\n\nThe censor’s review process introduces substantial uncertainty for Hollywood studios, who can sometimes be left waiting on tenterhooks to find out if their film will be permitted to be screened and promoted, whether it will receive a coveted quota spot, and when they can release the film within China. This uncertainty and financial risk, Hollywood insiders made clear to PEN America, is anathema to Hollywood studios, incentivizing them to take steps to ensure upfront that content does not set off Beijing’s tripwires.\n\nTiming is another factor that can spur Hollywood studios to preemptively avoid content that may veer toward Beijing’s redlines. Regulators can take their time reviewing films, which results in a significant gap between a film’s international release and the Chinese release. That mismatch in timing cuts into studios’ profits, as buzz for the film wanes and studios have to revise and shift expensive marketing plans, sometimes at the last minute. Finally, Beijing’s film board can insist on re-shoots to scenes as a prerequisite to the movie’s approval—at significant financial cost to the studio. As one Hollywood producer and screenwriter, David Franzoni, put it in a 2013 interview, “they have a lot of power so you want to try to be sure you have it all down the first time.”\n\nThe result, writes Associate Professor Aynne Kokas of the Department of Media Studies at University of Virginia, in her 2017 book Hollywood: Made in China, is that films that present iffy material to Beijing’s censors may find themselves paying the “financial penalty” for “airing China’s dirty laundry—both literally and figuratively on-screen.”\n\nTo avoid this “penalty,” Hollywood studios engage in a series of informal negotiations, conversations, and discussions designed to ensure they stay within the lines of content that Beijing will find acceptable. Firstly, they lean on American and Chinese consultants, fixers, and their own people on the ground for expert advice as to what content will make the cut and what will not. Secondly, they establish informal feedback channels with Chinese officials and executives from a range of both state agencies and government-connected companies, parsing their advice to determine which content may need to go and what type of content may need to be added or emphasized. Finally, there are opportunities for studios to appeal and negotiate on behalf of their films; opportunities that provide studios an opportunity to push back against censorship, but which also normalize the give-and-take between Hollywood studios and Beijing regulators seeking to advance their censorious and political agenda.\n\nConversations about Beijing’s censorship appear to be so mainstreamed into the studio process, that they are evaluated as a matter of standard practice when studios are evaluating their China-distribution business strategy for a film. “Large studio films are big-budget productions,” said one producer who has worked with big studios. “There are consultants who listen to story pitches, early screenings . . . processes to raise any possible red flags.” For films where China may play a role, “you consult with Chinese experts and media consultants, you think about whether something is going to be perceived as criticism, you worry about inadvertently crossing some line.”\n\nFilm consultants based in China are a vital link in the communication chain between Hollywood and Beijing. Consultants often handle much of the actual communications with regulators, and report back to their Hollywood clients in conversations in which censorship is just one of the subjects of conversation. PEN America spoke with film consultants who stressed that their conversations with film studios mainly deal with the cultural and professional differences between Beijing and Hollywood, of which institutionalized censorship is only one part. But it is nonetheless a crucial part.\n\nStudios may have Chinese partners—such as marketing firms or distributors—that can similarly serve as cultural intermediaries between Hollywood and the censors. As this report notes elsewhere, Chinese financiers may play a mediating role between the Hollywood studio and Beijing. But they are not the only ones who can play this role. For example, Chinese marketing firms, Hollywood executives noted to PEN America, are an indispensable partner for studios launching their film within China.\n\nThis web of business connections fits well within the Chinese business culture of “guanxi” (personal connections) and with a system of censorship that often enforces itself through unwritten “understandings” rather than formal rules. But it leaves the average moviegoer—in Nebraska as well as Nanjing—in the dark as to what content may have been cut or altered as part of an informal deal between the Hollywood studio and the Beijing censor, as well as to how these dynamics impact larger decisions about which stories get told and which do not.\n\nEven with these feedback loops, however, studios can still be caught flat-footed, with censors changing their minds or raising new concerns at the 11th hour. Given the massive benefits of “having it all down the first time,” it is no surprise that studios have begun more actively self-censoring, identifying and removing or rewriting content that could be flagged by Chinese censors even before they submit their films for review.\n\nRewriting Global Films for a Chinese Audience\n\nThe 2014 hack of Sony executives’ emails, believed by many to be an act of retaliation for Sony’s producing Seth Rogen’s send-up of North Korea in The Interview (Columbia Pictures et al., 2014), offered a rare glimpse of how normal it had become for studio executives to debate what film content should be shed in order to win access to the Chinese market. The emails revealed that Sony executives had cut or trimmed several scenes—including a shot of aliens bringing down the Great Wall—from its 2015 movie Pixels (Columbia Pictures et al., 2015) after determining the shots weren’t worth the risk that it could hurt their chances for a Chinese release.\n\nThe offending scenes from Pixels were removed from the worldwide release of the movie, not simply for any China-specific version. In fact, in one leaked email, one Sony executive made it clear that it was better for them to alter the master version of the film in order to better hide the extent of their self-censorship, writing, “if we only change the China version, we set ourselves up for the press to call us out for this when bloggers invariably compare the versions and realize we changed the China setting just to pacify that market.”\n\nThe leaked emails also showed how executives also openly fretted that the 2013 film Captain Phillips (Columbia Pictures et al.), starring Tom Hanks as a ship captain captured by Somali pirates, was unlikely to be approved by China’s censors: the U.S. military going to such heroic lengths to rescue a single person, Sony’s president of worldwide distribution theorized, might clash with Beijing’s rhetoric on the importance of the collective over any single individual.\n\nAnd during the production of RoboCop (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures et al., 2014), one Sony executive who had seen a cut of the film proposed that the studio minimize the relationship in the film between the American corporation Omnicorp and the Chinese government. Sony made the changes. During their conversations, Sony executives discussed the issue of censorship matter-of-factly, with one writing, “Censorship really hassling us on ‘Robocop.’”\n\nSony was also involved in one of the decade’s best-known examples of a studio changing content to avoid antagonizing Beijing: Red Dawn (Contrafilm), a movie issued by the studio in 2012. The film, a remake of a Cold War movie about a Soviet invasion of America, told a fictional story about a group of American fighters resisting China’s occupation of the United States. After filming had been completed, the moviemakers transformed the antagonists into North Korean soldiers, including by digitally altering the Chinese flags and insignias into North Korean ones.\n\nRed Dawn was originally produced by MGM Studios, but the studio went bankrupt in 2010, and Sony Pictures took over distribution of the film. The media outlet Vulture reports that Sony’s prioritization of the “Chinese relationship” triggered the changes, quoting MGM insiders saying that while MGM “could do what [it] liked,” Sony—as a multinational company—could not “afford to piss off the Chinese.”\n\nAccording to Vulture, one of the MGM insiders recalled hearing that the Chinese-antagonist version of the film would have problems in China “through these pseudo-government Chinese intermediaries and organizations.” The Los Angeles Times reported that Chinese diplomats arranged to raise the issue with makers of Red Dawn by using a film production company with offices in the United States and China as a go-between and mediator.\n\nTo many public commentators, and for several of the Hollywood professionals that PEN America spoke to, Red Dawn is an example of a China-driven change that should not ring alarm bells. For action films like Red Dawn, one Hollywood producer told PEN America, “There’s a sense in which these aren’t great works of art, where changing who the bad guy is would change the story’s meaning.” But it’s not so simple. The original cut for Red Dawn reportedly offered a backstory for why China had invaded the United States: a narrative about how China was in effect repossessing the country after the United States failed to pay off its national debt. That story was jettisoned for fear of angering Beijing.\n\nBut Sony is not the only studio that has been caught making changes to its film in order to better appeal to Chinese officials or to increase the chances of succeeding in China.\n\nOther examples include Marvel Studios’ Dr. Strange (2016), which whitewashed a major Tibetan character for fear of jeopardizing the film’s chances in China. The writer of the blockbuster Marvel film, C. Robert Cargill, in a media appearance, cited Chinese censorship when defending the controversial decision to transform the protagonist’s mentor from a Tibetan character—from the fictional Himalayan city of Kamar-Taj—to a Celtic one. He said, “If you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that [the character is] Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people who think that that’s bullshit and risk the Chinese government going, ‘Hey, you know one of the biggest film-watching countries in the world? We’re not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.’”\n\nA few days after this statement, Cargill took conspicuous pains to state that this statement was “MY JUSTIFICATION, not Marvel’s,” and that he was “not part of any casting discussions or decisions.” Marvel itself was silent on the controversy. But even if one accepts Cargill’s subsequent “MY JUSTIFICATION” statement at face value, his answer reflects that of a screenwriter taking the Chinese government’s attitude toward Tibet into account when determining how his story should be told. In fact, the sentiment within Cargill’s answer is almost irrational in its deference to Beijing, questioning whether Tibet even exists as a specific place.\n\nSome commentators and advocates have alleged that Swinton’s casting is better understood through the lens of Hollywood whitewashing than through Beijing censorship. Here, however, it seems that the two issues intersect—that by citing the regulatory risk from Beijing censors, Hollywood decision-makers can justify the avoidance of portrayals of Asian characters whose Asian identity would require thoughtful and nuanced treatment.\n\nCargill’s reference to the risks of getting “political” is also notable. Is it more political to hew to a story as written with a Tibetan character, or to write that element out of existence? Both are political acts, yet in Cargill’s mind Beijing’s taboos evidently rule the day. And while it seems possible that the Old One could have been not from Tibet but from a neighboring area like Nepal or Bhutan, there’s no public indication that such a move was ever considered—implying the possibility that Hollywood decision-makers see any portrayal of Himalayan characters as potentially politically sensitive.\n\nAnother prominent—and recent—example of such censorship-driven content decisions is the mysterious disappearance of the Taiwanese flag in the 2019 trailer for the much-anticipated Top Gun sequel (Skydance Media et al., 2020). When the trailer for the movie was released, eagle-eyed viewers noted that Tom Cruise’s leather bomber jacket—iconically adorned with Navy Tour patches—had changed since its appearance in the original 1986 film. In place of the Japanese flag was simply a red triangle against a white background, and in place of the Taiwanese flag Cruise’s jacket now sports a random patch that looks similar to the flag at first glance. Depictions of the Taiwanese flag are a prime target for censorship in China. Yet, given that the movie was at that point over a year from being released, it seems that Paramount Studios did not wait for censors to view the final product before deciding that it would be better to convert the Taiwanese flag into a meaningless symbol.\n\nWhen the Maverick trailer was released, viewers familiar with the original film and with the historical significance of the patches were quick to call Paramount out on the change to Cruise’s wardrobe. Paramount—which had worked with Chinese media titan TenCent on the marketing and distribution for the film—made no comment.\n\nHollywood is not the only film industry that has felt—and at times acceded—to Beijing’s pressure. Last year, producers of the German anthology film Berlin, I Love You (Rheingold Films and Walk on Water Films, 2019) removed a section of the film directed by Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei from the final cut. Two of the film’s producers publicly confirmed that the segment was removed due to concerns over the artist’s status as persona non grata in China. In other words, this Beijing-imposed self-censorship in film is not unique to the United States.\n\nDespite the documented and widely suspected examples of studios’ active cooperation with censors, ultimately, Hollywood’s self-censorship is impossible to observe or document, because it involves movies that never had the chance to get off the ground in the first place for fear that the film would never enter the Chinese market. Or as Michael Berry, director of the Center for Chinese Studies at UCLA, described it to PEN America: “The big story is not what’s getting changed, but what is not ever even getting greenlit.”\n\nBesides cutting or changing content, studios have infrequently gone further, adding scenes to the movie only for Chinese audiences. Iron Man III (Marvel Studios, 2013) is the best-known example: Marvel Studios added scenes to the Chinese-version release, in which Chinese doctors frantically worked to save Iron Man’s life. The additions were so jarring, so different from the rest of the film, that many Chinese commentators dismissed them as graceless pandering.\n\nThe creators of Iron Man III bent over backwards to maximize its chances of approval in China. Producers of the film, which received a substantial financial investment from Beijing-based film producer DMG and which was partially filmed in Beijing, also allowed Chinese regulators to visit the set and to “advise” on creative decisions, according to people who were briefed on the production and who spoke anonymously to the New York Times. Amazingly, the Times depicted this level of cooperation—which would have been unimaginable only two decades ago—as a “middle of the road” approach that “appear[ed] intended to limit Chinese meddling.”\n\nIn return for this level of cooperation, the studio received some significant perks. Chinese film analyst Robert Cain concluded that “by working closely with the Chinese government,” the studios had secured themselves a range of benefits, including an optimal release date, a much more permissive government attitude toward their film advertisements, and a “high degree of media access in China.” That last benefit included a promotional segment for the film on CCTV’s annual Chinese New Year Gala, a highly visible placement that would not have been possible without the Party’s active acquiescence.\n\nProhibitions Against Specific Movie Ideas\n\nWithin Beijing’s censorship system, there are several topics that are commonly understood to be untouchable: the contested territories of Tibet, Taiwan, Xinjiang, and the South China Sea; the spiritual practice of Falun Gong; top Chinese leaders; the democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989 or in Hong Kong in 2019; and anything that casts doubt on the CCP’s right to rule China. This does not mean that movies about these subjects don’t exist. Instead, it means that filmmakers attempting to make such movies will need to have much closer “collaboration” with government censors than would otherwise be the case, so that the finished film will portray the CCP in a positive light. When it comes to such “sensitive” subjects, then, filmmakers are offered a stark choice: make a film that actively flatters the Party, or don’t make the film at all.\n\nBut censors do not confine their gaze to these obvious areas. Instead, regulators may occasionally declare that entire genres, tropes, or categories of movie content are out of bounds. Such prohibitions are not always enforced; instead, the censor can waive these rules if they determine that the movie’s overall message serves Beijing’s interests, or sometimes even if the economic benefits of approving a movie override the probation.\n\nMany of these CCP’s prohibitions against specific movie content will appear to be arbitrary or even incomprehensible to Hollywood insiders, who may not know or appreciate the fact that many of these prohibitions appear to have a specific social or political rationale that is often deeply tied to CCP’s propagandistic efforts.\n\nFor example, time-travel stories have been known as a “no-go” in film for years. In 2011, the SARFT published a “guidance” document declaring that movie producers had been “treating serious history in a frivolous way,” a declaration that put filmmakers on notice that film censors would be imposing a ban on depictions of time travel. The guidance document offered little visibility on why the CCP felt so uncomfortable with time travel. One Hollywood producer PEN America spoke with hypothesized that Party officials were wary of the implication that China’s own political history could be changed in such a fictional universe.\n\nAnother long-standing prohibition applies to ghost stories, with Chinese censors acting to block such movies from reaching Chinese screens. In 2008, Beijing’s State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television promulgated content restriction guidelines for movies depicting “terror, ghosts, and the supernatural.” The SAPPRFT doubled down on these restrictions in 2015 by extending them to television shows. It is these regulations that reportedly torpedoed the 2016 Ghostbusters (Columbia Pictures et al.) remake from being shown in China, and the 2006 Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest (Walt Disney Pictures & Jerry Bruckheimer Films) before that. Although the Central Propaganda Department now handles film censorship, these restrictions are widely understood to stand.\n\nThis fact appeared to be fairly well-known by Hollywood professionals with whom PEN America spoke. “In Hollywood, you could not make the Demi Moore film Ghost anymore,” said one Hollywood writer, in reference to the fact that the movie presumably would run face-first into these restrictions in China. “That movie cannot get made.”\n\nWhile the most common explanation for the prohibition is a presumed hostility from CCP officials toward “superstition,” others have argued that the true rationale is political, given the historical usage in Chinese literature and folk tales of “evil ghosts” as a metaphor for corrupt officials. “Banning ghost stories sounds almost absurd and laughable to the West,” explains artist Aowen Jin in a 2015 article on the subject, “and yet it carries the deep-rooted, historical fear that the government feels about its own people.” The political elements of this prohibition, of course, are often invisible to Hollywood executives evaluating whether or not to greenlight a ghost movie and weighing how Beijing’s rules would affect such a movie’s financial returns.\n\nYet, this rule can also be waived if the censors decide that a ghost movie suits them. One example is the Harry Potter series, the cinematic behemoth that utilizes both ghosts and the supernatural; censors simply could not ignore the Chinese public’s interest in the global phenomenon. Another good example is that of Coco (Walt Disney Pictures & Pixar Animation Studios), Pixar’s 2017 Day of the Dead–themed ghost story. Commentators noted that the story seemed unlikely to receive a coveted quota spot, given that the story’s theme centered on ghosts and the supernatural. Yet, the film did earn a quota slot and went on to gross approximately $170 million in China—a greater sum than the studio’s last 12 movies that showed in China combined.\n\nCoco’s approval kicked off a round of speculation as to the basis for waiving the usual ban on ghost stories, with the common wisdom being that the movie’s focus on familial obligations outweighed its supernatural elements in the minds of Chinese regulators. “Just as Mexico has its Day of the Dead (Día de los Muertos), China has its Tomb-Sweeping Day, a holiday for revering one’s ancestors,” noted Forbes’ Rob Cain.\n\nStill, this balancing act means that Hollywood writers and other decision-makers may find themselves trying to counterbalance or soften the edges of supernatural stories in order to appease Chinese censors. “There are work-arounds,” noted one Hollywood producer to PEN America. “For example, you can make a ghost movie, if you make it clear at the end of the movie that it was just a dream.”\n\nBeijing’s willingness to ban entire tropes of fiction—ghost stories, time-travel stories—demonstrates the breadth of its film censorship, even if Beijing is inconsistent in its implementation of these bans in practice. It is not enough for filmmakers to avoid certain messages or plot points that may reflect poorly on Beijing; they also have to take into account what genres of storytelling the CCP is less likely to approve. And as Hollywood decision-makers internalize this censorship, it has a result on what stories they tell—and, correspondingly, what stories the world’s theater-going audiences view.\n\nBeijing’s Influence Over Chinese Portrayals\n\nPerhaps one of the most-discussed aspects of Hollywood’s new relationship with Beijing is that which Hollywood insiders commonly describe as “pandering”—deliberately orienting specific scenes, characters, sets, or themes in order to better appeal to Beijing. For example, one of the most visible ways that Hollywood studios have aimed to better appeal to the Chinese box office has been by ensuring that many of their flagship franchises—from the Fast and the Furious to the Marvel extended universe—have at least one Chinese character, scene, or subplot.\n\nIn some ways, Hollywood’s effort to tell more international stories and include more Chinese actors and content represents a step forward, rather than a step back. When viewed through the prism of Hollywood’s history of portraying Asians and Asian-Americans through derogatory stereotypes—from decades of “yellow-face” portrayals to the whitewashing of Asian characters in more recent studio movies like Avatar: The Last Airbender (Nickelodeon Movies et al., 2010) and Ghost in the Shell (DreamWorks Pictures et al., 2017) —a move toward more accurate and substantive three-dimensional depictions of Asian characters as well as more diverse storytelling that genuinely appeals to Asian audiences is welcome and overdue. This is especially the case during a time of rising sinophobia in the United States amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and the President’s explicit sinophobic language around the virus.\n\nOf course, it does not hurt that such appeals to Chinese theatergoers make substantial financial sense. “Having a subplot with a Chinese character, which also allows for the opportunity to expand that subplot in the version of the story told in China, is great for studios from a financial perspective,” screenwriter Howard Rodman noted. “So how much of the decision to cast Chinese actors in supporting roles is about being less colorblind, and how much is more calculated and opportunistic?” The answer, most certainly, is both/and.\n\nBut the propagandistic intentions of Beijing make the calculus for Hollywood filmmakers even more complicated. After all, Chinese audiences are not the ones deciding whether or not a certain Hollywood movie even makes it into theaters. It is the Chinese government that holds that power. Hollywood studios, then, have not one but three motivations for such pandering: telling more authentically international stories, appealing to Chinese audiences, and staying on the good side of the Chinese government.\n\nIn many cases—and certainly for any outsider looking in—it becomes almost impossible to tease out these motivations. And when these motivations are opaque, it becomes very easy for a Hollywood filmmaker to make content decisions that appeal to Beijing, but justify these decisions by saying to others, and perhaps even to themselves, that they were motivated by the desire to appeal to everyday Chinese theatergoers.\n\nAs noted in examples throughout this report, Hollywood studios have shifted set locations to China, added China-specific references to scripts, and gone out of their way to portray China as a “good actor” in films. Some have gone so far as to add positive portrayals of Chinese officialdom, often acting in the role of a savior of humanity. In just three of many examples, the films 2012, Columbia Pictures’ 2009 disaster film by Roland Emmerich, the 2013 Warner Brothers’ film Gravity, by director Alfonso Cuarón, and Arrival, the 2016 alien invasion film from Paramount, all predicate their happy endings on Chinese forces coming to the rescue. Further, it is now commonly accepted that there will be no Chinese villains in any Hollywood film in the years to come since China’s box office is too important.\n\nSome of this pandering is so obvious that it is in fact poorly received by Chinese audiences. Chinese commenters, for example, have not been shy in derisively employing the term “hua ping,” or “flower vase,” to criticize Chinese actors cast in insignificant roles, a reflection of Hollywood’s presumptive desire to take shortcuts on its way to Chinese box office success.\n\nOne example of such a “hua ping” is the role of Chinese actress Zhang Jingchu in 2015’s Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation (Skydance Productions et al.), a movie that received financial backing from the state-owned China Movie Channel as well as the Chinese conglomerate Alibaba. Zhang’s place in the movie was promoted as “major” and a “leading role” in the press prior to the movie’s release. Audiences were surprised, then, to find that in the movie, Zhang received less than 40 seconds of screen time.\n\nIn another example, Chinese social media posters commented with frustration at the 2017 action film Kong: Skull Island (Legendary Pictures & Tencent Pictures), which prominently featured Chinese actress Jing Tian in its Chinese marketing but which relegated Jing’s character to a minor role in the final cut. On the Chinese film review site Douban, one commentator complained that Jing looked like “a casual tourist” compared to the Western actors also playing scientists, while another wrote “when I saw Jing Tian, I felt very embarrassed as a Chinese person.”\n\nOf course, as with public response to any movie, the sentiment was far from universal. One netizen commented on the movie, “Finally Jing Tian saves the world, long live China.”\n\nAs an organization pledged to celebrating and promoting a diversity of literary and artistic voices, PEN America believes strongly that cultural sensitivities are something to take seriously, that diverse stories need to be told, and that people of all nations deserve to see themselves in the media they consume. Yet, China—like anywhere else in the world—is a place where people hold a multitude of opinions. The CCP has a well-documented history of insisting that “the people” are offended whenever the international community questions the Party’s priorities. But the “Chinese people” are not monolithic, and government pronouncements should not be mistaken for a reliable proxy for public attitudes.\n\nSeveral of the Hollywood insiders we spoke to emphasized their belief that Hollywood is improving in its ability to tell stories that genuinely appeal to Chinese audiences, rather than merely inserting a Chinese character or subplot. But as Hollywood ramps up its efforts to center Asian characters in their storytelling, Beijing may become more aggressive in their efforts to impose their political preferences on a movie’s narrative. Take, for example, Beijing’s willingness to pounce on the political debate raised in connection with Disney’s Mulan.\n\nMulan (Walt Disney Pictures et al., 2020), starring Chinese-American actress Crystal Liu, set to be released in August 2020 in the United States, is the much anticipated live-action English language remake of the 1998 animated feature about a Chinese woman who disguises herself as a man to fight off invaders. In August 2019, after principal filming on the movie had already been completed, Liu posted in support of Hong Kong police’s crackdown on prodemocracy protesters. It was an action that led to movie boycott calls in Hong Kong but which many mainland Chinese applauded.\n\nBeijing was quick to use the controversy as an opportunity to transform Mulan into a loyalty litmus test, with a government-backed social media campaign against the Hong Kong protests, under the hashtag #SupportMulan. The #SupportMulan campaign swept both Chinese and Western social media channels. One reporter, Variety’s Rebecca Davis, noted that a “typical example” of the campaign was a social media post that appended “#SupportMulan” to an image comparing Hong Kong demonstrators to ISIS.\n\nMany of the social media channels pushing the #SupportMulan hashtag, in fact, ended up getting shut down by Twitter and Facebook after being identified as “coordinated misinformation” regarding the protests. Twitter, explaining its decision to shut down more than 200,000 accounts from China, put out a statement elaborating that the accounts were “deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in Hong Kong, including undermining the legitimacy and political positions of the protest movement,” further concluding that the campaign represented a “coordinated state-backed” misinformation effort.\n\nMeanwhile, Disney was conspicuously silent during the entire controversy, speaking neither on behalf of Liu’s right to speak her mind nor in outrage on how their movie had been co-opted for a specific political agenda that denigrated peaceful protest. Disney’s lack of engagement presumably made sense from a business perspective, allowing them to refrain from alienating one or more potential audiences for the movie. Even so, the studio’s public silence—in connection to a movie that centers around one woman’s courage to fly in the face of a restrictive society, no less—further enabled Beijing to utilize the studio’s movie as a tool of antidemocratic propaganda without pushback.\n\nThe #SupportMulan government-backed “movement” goes to show that even if Hollywood studios aim to make their movies as inoffensive as possible—with the definition of “inoffensive” being highly responsive to what Beijing declares as offensive—the CCP is more than willing to impose a political agenda on these films, leveraging even unanticipated controversies as opportunities to pursue their creative propaganda while pulling studios along for the ride. As Hollywood filmmakers strive to tell more thoughtful three-dimensional stories involving Chinese characters, the risk of such political interference only rises.\n\nThe Quota\n\nBeijing’s powerful tools for censoring Hollywood films include not only its ability to decide which content is permissible for Chinese audiences, and which actors or writers are persona non grata in China, but also its ability to determine which foreign films receive the best profit-sharing deals. The quota system—the ability of Chinese regulators to decide which films receive one of the coveted 34 spots for foreign films imported under the U.S.-China film agreement of 2012—plays a key role in cementing Beijing’s ability to influence Hollywood films.\n\nMajor Hollywood studios only submit five or six of their dozens of annual releases for consideration in China, based on a very careful calculus. The submitted films are normally blockbusters with massive film and marketing budgets, movies in which the studio has sunk a major amount of financing and for which it expects the greatest returns. (Film quality tends to be of lesser significance: between 1994 and 2020, for example, only nine Best Picture Oscar winners screened within China). As such, Beijing’s ability to grant or deny a quota spot to these films can have tangible effects on a studio’s financial returns for the year.\n\n“It’s not the content-based censorship that is the issue,” one Hollywood writer opined to PEN America. “It is the limit on American films released in China. That is the real censorship that is going on. That is the real limit on expression, right now.”\n\n“The leverage that China has is that it offers only a limited number of slots for foreign movies,” affirmed a Hollywood producer. “Studios want to get those slots.”\n\nA major Chinese tool to shape Hollywood’s film content is, thus, hidden in plain sight—immediately obvious to any studio, but largely unknown to the movie-going public in the United States. And everything else, most importantly the exact reasons why any specific film is rejected or accepted, is opaque, contributing to a climate of uncertainty and self-censorship. As one Hollywood producer put it: “Getting into the quota, you don’t have a lot of control over that process. But you can cut out anything that would jeopardize your chances of being on the list.”\n\nThere is a clear loser under the quota system: films that are produced and distributed independently or by small studios. The “Big Six” Hollywood studios—Walt Disney, Paramount, Sony, Fox, Universal, and Warner Brothers—have easily boxed out smaller competitors for coveted space, to the point where these studios have almost exclusive dominance over the quota list. And since March 2019, when Disney bought out competing studio Fox, that list of major studios dominating the quota offerings has shrunk to the “Big Five.”\n\nThere are several economic and legal reasons for this. Large studios make the large blockbusters that audiences are more likely to want to see in theaters, meaning that the regulators—whose role as censor can conflict with their role as economic promoter—are more predisposed to greenlight them. Additionally, the U.S.-China Film Agreement of 2012 specified that 14 of the 34 films must be able to be shown in special formats, such as 3D or IMAX format. Big studios, not independent filmmakers or smaller studios, are best-placed to produce such specialized formats for their films.\n\nMoreover, big studio executives often have key ties to Washington that they can leverage to influence U.S.-China negotiations that relate to the film world, as evidenced by the fact that the Motion Picture Association of America, the trade group that is seen as most closely connected to the top studios, has been so instrumental in shaping both the 2012 film agreement and a subsequent 2015 addendum to the agreement.\n\nRegardless of the rationale, this advantage to the larger studios helps solidify their worldwide market dominance. “Fewer films benefit certain people, and we are dealing with a censorship system that benefits the big studios,” one Hollywood writer put it to PEN America. As long as these restrictions grant an advantage to larger studios over smaller American or international competitors, industry pressure on American policymakers to push their Chinese counterparts for changes will presumably be half-hearted.\n\nThe recent bureaucratic shift to the Central Propaganda Department may further weigh this issue toward the side of big studios, especially those that embed proactive compliance with censorship early into the filmmaking process, explains USC’s Stanley Rosen: “Anybody making a small to medium budget film will have a difficult time getting into China [currently] . . . because Chinese distributors are reluctant to purchase small and medium budget films at film markets or film festivals since they have no way of knowing whether theaters will be willing or even allowed to show them. No one [in China] wants to risk displeasing the Communist Party, so why show American films during a trade war? The films that are most likely to be shown will primarily be blockbusters that go through and clear the formal censorship process right at the beginning, or American films where there has been significant Chinese investment, so you know whether they’re going to be shown or not shown. But with these small budget films, you don’t know [if they will be approved] until you actually buy the film, so why take the chance?”\n\nJoint Productions\n\nAvoiding the quota and the flat-fee model altogether, Hollywood studios have increasingly been taking advantage of another way to enter the Chinese market: joint productions. Joint productions are one-film partnerships between Chinese and foreign producers, formally recognized—and regulated—by the Chinese government.\n\nJoint productions, since they do not count as foreign films, come with a variety of benefits: not only are they exempt from quota limits, but producers make up to 43 percent of the profits from ticket sales (as opposed to only 25 percent of the profit from foreign films). Additionally, joint productions are exempted from the “black-out” periods when no foreign films can be shown, a practice that the government uses to promote the country’s domestic film industry.\n\nJoint productions are not a novel practice. But as the Chinese theatergoing market has grown to its current juggernaut state, this form of cooperative filmmaking has taken off as a viable option for Hollywood studios in the past several years and has provided a vehicle for major Hollywood movies that have seen significant financial success.\n\nBut while PEN America applauds international collaboration between filmmakers, joint productions—as Beijing has deliberately arranged it—formalize a Hollywood studio’s acquiescence to censorship for the duration of the project, conceding even more ground to Chinese censors.\n\nJoint Productions and the Institutional Censorship Process\n\nJoint productions must be approved through a regulatory process managed by the China Film Co-Production Corporation (CFCC), a division of the state-run China Film Group Corporation. The CFCC lays out many requirements that both the Chinese and the foreign producer must adhere to in order to obtain coveted joint production status.\n\nMost of these requirements seem straightforward. For example, the CFCC requires that at least one-third of the financial investment for jointly produced movies comes from Chinese partners, that at least one scene is shot in China, and that at least one-third of the actors cast are Chinese.\n\nWhile these requirements may seem like typical protectionist measures, they must be evaluated against the context of the CCP’s control over so many elements of China’s filmmaking industry. Chinese filmmaking companies are virtually always state-owned or state-backed, such that the Party has a significant role in determining which Chinese actors get work and which do not. Similarly, by overseeing which scenes are shot in China and where, Chinese bureaucrats can influence the movie’s setting and push filmmakers to depict a sanitized image of China.\n\nOther requirements more explicitly enshrine Beijing’s censorship as a prerequisite for any joint production. For example, many of the necessary regulatory requirements for a joint production are formalized in the Provisions on the Administration of Sino-Foreign Cooperative Production of Films, a set of regulations promulgated by SARFT in 2004. The Provisions put co-producers on notice that compliance with censorship strictures is a prerequisite for the film.\n\nArticle 6(a) of the Provisions obliges joint productions into “compliance with the Constitution, laws, regulations, and other relevant provisions of China,” a reference that incorporates the rules enshrining Beijing’s state censorship system. Article 6(a) also obliges co-producers to, among other things, have “respect for the customs, religions, beliefs and habits of the ethnic groups of China,” “contribut[e] to the brilliant traditional culture of the Chinese people,” and “make contributions to . . . the social stability of China.” All of these values seem beneficial in a vacuum, but censorious officials can interpret these vague provisions in troubling ways.\n\nThe reference to China’s social stability, in particular, takes on weighty undertones in that the same value is often used as a justification to silence dissidents or implement intrusive surveillance regimes. Social stability has become a catch-all rationale for repressive Beijing policies, such as the CCP’s justification for its systemic human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.\n\nArticle 16 of the Provisions mandates that “jointly produced films may only be distributed and screened publicly inside or outside China after they have passed examination” by the government. SARFT approval is required before filming begins, and again after the film is complete. And in public documents posted on its website, the SARFT is upfront in explaining that government regulators have the right to “conduct preliminary review of the screenplay and completed film.” These powers have now been delegated to the Central Propaganda Department.\n\nThis tight oversight means that, as one producer who often works with China put it: “You can’t promise to shoot a movie about a housewife with her family and then secretly shoot a movie about Tibetan monks setting themselves on fire.” And such regulations offer censors a remarkable level of oversight. For example, the 2016 movie Kung Fu Panda III, a joint production between China Film Group, DreamWorks Animation, and Oriental DreamWorks, had government censors “drop in to monitor the movie” on the set of Dreamwork Animation’s Chinese campus while it was being produced.\n\nUltimately, this editorial interference from Beijing casts a negative pall over Hollywood studios’ ability to tell truly compelling stories through joint productions. Michael Berry, director of the Center for Chinese Studies at UCLA, analogized to PEN America that studios’ efforts to balance the desires of both the censors and the international movie-going public during a joint production is like “inviting friends over for dinner, but one is a vegetarian, the other doesn’t eat spicy food, one doesn’t eat fish . . . you end up getting a bland meal.”\n\nFinally, while there is technically nothing stopping the producers from offering a different version of a co-produced film to non-Chinese audiences, as the New York Times summarizes, there is an “unofficial expectation that the government’s approved version of the film will be seen both in China and elsewhere.”\n\nHow Beijing Uses Joint Productions to Advance Their Political Message\n\nThe exhortation that joint productions should uplift the “traditional culture of the Chinese people” has become the basis for a de facto requirement that co-produced films advance particular political messages. Beijing’s ability to influence and control the narratives and messages of such joint productions can be readily observed, as the following examples help demonstrate.\n\nReleased in 2014, Paramount’s Transformers: Age of Extinction (Hasbro and Di Bonaventura Pictures) began as a joint production with Beijing’s state-owned China Movie Channel as well as the privately owned Chinese company Jiaflix Enterprises, which bills itself as “the Netflix of China” and was founded by a group of Chinese and American businessmen. Paramount would later exit out of the joint production model, but only after a sizable portion of the film had been completed, and while retaining substantial investment in the film from its Chinese partners.\n\nObservers noted that the film, which takes place both in the United States and Hong Kong, paints American officials in unflattering tones while playing up the selflessness of Chinese characters, particularly in their willingness to defend Hong Kong from alien threat (this film was released the same year as the massive Hong Kong “Umbrella Movement” protests calling for greater democratic freedoms).\n\nOne reviewer concluded that the movie was “a splendidly patriotic film, if you happen to be Chinese.” Another analyst noted that with the presence of so much of “China’s government propaganda catering to SARFT” the movie was “literally asking to be greenlit.” The movie, notably, made significant profit in the United States, but even more in China—to the tune of more than $300 million.\n\nIn one interview coinciding with the premiere of the movie, the cofounder of Jiaflix, Marc Ganis, explained his corporation’s own relationship with Beijing, saying “Our partner is the government. It doesn’t hurt, in China, when your partner is the government . . . It’s not so much that you break down the wall [of regulation], it’s that you work cooperatively with the government. And you find ways to make things work so that you can do business properly, and also do it in a way that the Chinese government wants it to be done.”\n\nLooper (Endgame Entertainment et al., 2012), was a movie that seemed unlikely to ever be screened in China: The movie, which depicts Bruce Willis as a time-traveling assassin battling his former self, clearly ran afoul of a long-standing prohibition from Beijing against time-travel movies. The movie also seemed to have no connection to China, with the plot’s events being split between Kansas and Paris.\n\nYet when the Beijing-based media agency DMG Entertainment bought into the movie, reportedly financing 40 percent of the movie’s $60 million budget and enabling the studios to qualify the movie as a joint production, they insisted that the film be changed to move Willis’s character from Paris to Shanghai. Moreover, the film added the Chinese actress Xu Qing as Willis’ wife.\n\nIn fact, the Western release is shorter than the Chinese one, with several Shanghai-located scenes shortened or removed. An anonymous source to the Los Angeles Times, who was reportedly involved in the movie’s production, explained that the China-only footage had been removed from the Western cut after audiences complained it slowed down the pacing of the movie, but that “the Chinese didn’t care about pacing, and they wanted the [China-set] scenes in.” But in every version, the movie isn’t subtle about the shift to Shanghai: at one point, one of the main characters advises the protagonist, “I’m from the future. You should go to China.”\n\nThe movie, after being rewritten to include this “China is the future” messaging, not only was approved as a co-production, but received a coveted holiday release date. Dan Mintz, CEO of DMG Entertainment, gave an interview that reflected on why the changes would make the movie more likely to pass the censors despite the time-travel plot: “It’s talking about China in the future, and there’s never been a film that’s done that. Even China has never made one.” While there are other films depicting China in the future, the comment evinces Mintz’s awareness that the film’s portrayal of a globally prominent Shanghai would be well received by the CCP. (The interviewer went on to note that Mintz was “a bit evasive” when pressed to discuss the “awkward geopolitical implications” of these futuristic predictions).\n\nThe Meg (Gravity Pictures et al., 2018) was a U.S.-China joint production, produced by a set of smaller U.S. and Chinese studios and distributed jointly by Warner Bros. and China Media Capital’s Gravity Pictures. The movie—featuring Hollywood actor Jason Statham alongside Chinese A-lister Li Bingbing—squares off humans against a prehistoric megalodon shark. A major commercial success, The Meg made more money in China than it did in the United States. Though The Meg is loosely based on the 1997 novel Meg: A Novel of Deep Terror, by writer Steve Alten, the events of the book are set off the coast of Hawaii, while the movie takes place off the coast of China, and the confrontation between man and beast occurs along the coast of the country’s beachfront Sanya city. Similarly, the book’s Japanese scientists Masao and Terry Tanaka—both major characters—morph into the movie’s Chinese scientists Minway and Suyin Zhang.\n\nThe casting and location aren’t the only aspects of The Meg that appear to have been influenced by the movie’s Chinese backers. The Meg was so favorable in its treatment of China that Chinese netizens even joked that the shark antagonist was “pro-China,” with one Chinese reviewer noting that the Western characters appeared to die more gruesome deaths than the Chinese ones. The writer concluded that “Like all films with Chinese participation, The Meg is afraid to discredit the mysterious Eastern power . . . This megalodon, which eats only foreigners and leaves a beach-full of Chinese people unscathed, is so thoughtful!”\n\nPotentially due to its joint production status, The Meg was originally slated to be released in China during the Chinese New Year period in February, a highly coveted release period when theater-going audiences tend to flock to the theaters given the holiday. This date was, however, later pushed back, something that did not stop the film from being a major success in the Chinese box office.\n\nAbominable (DreamWorks Animation and Pearl Studio, 2019), a film about a young Chinese girl traveling with a yeti from Shanghai to the Himalayas, was a joint production between China’s Pearl Studio and DreamWorks Animation. Eagle-eyed viewers were quick to note a scene in which the movie appeared to endorse Beijing’s territorial claims to the South China Sea, showing the main characters traversing a long distance by moving through a map that contained the “nine-dash line,” Beijing’s claimed border that is sharply disputed by several of its regional neighbors. In 2016, Beijing’s claim to the disputed border was in fact litigated and rejected by an international arbitration tribunal under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, but in this case movie magic prevailed over international law.\n\nDreamWorks’s use of the “nine-dash line” was in fact so controversial that China’s neighbors vocally objected. Malaysia’s government in fact demanded that the studio omit the scene from the version of the movie it would make available to Malaysian audiences. DreamWorks refused, leading to the movie being banned there. DreamWorks’ refusal represents an uncomfortable example of a major Hollywood studio refusing censorship from one government, for the purpose of better adhering to the propagandistic expectations of another government—in essence, prioritizing the wishes of one country’s censors over another’s.\n\nNone of this is to say that joint productions cannot create films of artistic merit. “There are organic stories that can be told with joint productions, productions that truly tell a great story,” as one Hollywood executive told PEN America. Nor is it to say that the decision to set a movie in China or to cast Chinese characters is itself somehow illegitimate. Especially at a time when tensions are spiking between the United States and China, joint productions offer the opportunity for Chinese and Hollywood filmmakers to collaborate on projects that cross national and cultural boundaries.\n\nBut from a free expression–focused perspective, it cannot be dismissed that joint productions formally extend to the Chinese government the ability to deeply shape these films’ messages, as well as to exercise effective veto power over the movie’s content. The Chinese government is essentially offered a co-producer’s chair of their own, to not only advance a specific political agenda through film but to shape the film’s narrative to better mirror CCP propaganda. Such powers are anathema to the ideals of creative freedom and truthful storytelling.\n\nThis drumroll of deals between Hollywood studios and Chinese investors has continued even though Chinese investment began to slow in the latter half of the decade, in part due to a regulatory crackdown from Beijing on major Chinese investments in “risky” foreign ventures, as well as tensions arising from the U.S.-China trade war. Today, amidst the coronavirus pandemic such investment has dropped precipitously, amidst a sector-wide entertainment slowdown.\n\nEven so, today’s ranks of investors in Hollywood movies include a massive slate of Chinese investors, both private and state-owned: Tencent Pictures, Huayi Brothers Media Company, Perfect World Pictures, Chinese Media Capital, Fosun International/Studio 8, Beijing Polybona Film Distribution Company, Gravity Pictures, Shanghai RuYi Entertainment, Alibaba Pictures, and others.\n\nIn some ways, this represents a simple business shift. Yet, these enterprises are controlled by China’s business or political elite, many of whom are prominent members of the ruling Chinese Communist Party or who have their own close connections to these leaders. Even if they are not formally state controlled, these enterprises depend upon good relations with the government, which has made public its expectation that entertainment media should serve the political interests of the Party.\n\nIn all, investors have strong incentives to make sure that their Hollywood partners and the Central Propaganda Department see eye-to-eye. These investors and business partners play a mediating role between the Hollywood studio and the Chinese government, encouraging Beijing officials to grant their movies perks such as favorable release dates, while also relaying Beijing’s propagandistic requirements to their Hollywood counterparts. This mediating role is hardly ever documented, but widely assumed, operating in plain sight but behind closed doors.\n\nTake, for example, the 2019 war film Midway (Summit Entertainment et al., 2019). Midway, a movie primarily produced and distributed by Lionsgate Studios but which received $80 million in funding from the Chinese conglomerate Bona Film Group, deals with the World War II battle between American and Japanese forces. While the film’s depiction centers around a militarily victorious America—during the height of the U.S.-China trade war—the movie also plays up China’s role in World War II and criticizes China’s longtime rival Japan for its wartime atrocities. As Hong Kong film critic Clarence Tsui noted, the movie’s Chinese financial backing “certainly helps” explain why Chinese censors were so willing to permit an American war film to reach the country’s big screens. Meanwhile, China Daily, the Chinese Communist Party’s English-language paper, concluded that Bona’s financial investment “brought China a bigger presence in Midway,” through scenes that featured Chinese locals protecting American pilots.\n\nThe mediating role of the Chinese funder may sometimes ease the way for Hollywood films to pass through the censorship process with a lighter touch. For example, the 2015 film The Revenant (Regency Enterprises et al.), which showed in China under a flat-fee arrangement, was partially funded by the Chinese company Guangdong Alpha Animation and Culture. The film’s Chinese backing may have played a role in the fact that just 30 seconds of the film were supposedly cut from the Chinese release, with one journalist noting that the “connection certainly wouldn’t have hurt the film’s ability to pass unscathed” through the censorship process.\n\nBut their financial stake also enables Chinese partners to act as proxies for Beijing’s interests, pushing for changes even absent formal instruction from their CCP colleagues. “No one sends someone over [to the studio] and says, ‘this is the censor.’ That conversation would not go over well,” recounts one Hollywood producer. “But a financier may express concern that [certain content] could damage the movie’s release date and say, ‘it might harm our chances at that.’”\n\nSeveral Hollywood insiders noted to PEN America that they face various pressures influencing the final content of their movies, of which those levied by Chinese censors are just one. “It’s hard to distinguish [censorship] with what happens all the time in studio politics, such as something that a specific studio president is concerned about and pressures someone to change,” one Hollywood producer summed it up to PEN America.\n\nYet to dismiss these pressures as yet another example of “studio politics” is to forget the fact that Chinese partners operate under a system of centralized state control. They have their own relationships with Beijing to manage, and their success is entwined with their ability to please their counterparts in the Central Propaganda Department and other regulatory or political institutions. This is studio politics beholden to a specific, censorious, agenda—one that threatens to further normalize state-sponsored censorship as simply “part of the process.” It is also noteworthy that these connections are often invisible to the average non-Chinese moviegoer—certainly to the average American viewer.\n\nChina is not the only country where financing from corporations connected to the government should raise alarm bells for freedom of expression. In 2018, for example, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman actively pursued investment opportunities in Hollywood, promising billions of dollars of investment, though many of those plans fell through after the world learned of the brutal murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Like China, Saudi Arabia engages in systemic film censorship, and has its own political interests that it maps onto its cultural offerings. Even so, no other foreign partner is as well-placed to push for movie changes as these Chinese firms, because no other nation’s box office is as critical to Hollywood’s success as China’s.\n\nYet the fact that China is not alone in exercising this influence underscores, rather than undermines, the need for Hollywood players to honestly identify and examine the power that their financial backers have over their film’s content. As one Hollywood producer lamented to PEN America, “We can always talk about censorship and morality. But if there wasn’t a business to support it, we wouldn’t be talking about these things. We’re quick to point fingers. But American capitalism initiated the whole thing!”\n\nHolding Hollywood to a Unified Standard on Free Expression\n\nAs an industry, Hollywood has been vocal on the need to safeguard their creative expression—at least in an American context. The Motion Picture Association (MPA, previously known by the longer acronym of MPAA), Hollywood’s key trade group, represents the Big Five studios (Disney, Warner Bros., Universal, Columbia, and Paramount) alongside its most recent member, Netflix. The MPA is the body that rates films (such as “G”, “PG,” and “PG-13”) to guide theaters and viewers on the appropriate audience age for viewing a film. The MPA also plays a major role in lobbying the U.S. government on laws and regulations related to film. The MPA’s leadership commonly consists of former government or elected officials—such as previous MPA CEO, Senator Chris Dodd; or current MPA CEO, former U.S. diplomat Charles Rivkin.\n\nThe MPA has a long history of intervening in judicial cases and legislative developments that threaten to diminish filmmaker’s free speech within the United States. For example, the MPA was deeply involved in the Supreme Court case Superior Films v. The Ohio Department of Education, a 1954 case on film censorship. The MPA, in an amicus briefing to the court, argued that the actions of the Ohio Governmental Film Office, which had imposed a strict prescreening film review process on studios, was “repugnant to the First Amendment.” The case helped cement the right of filmmakers across the country to utilize their free artistic expression.\n\nThe organization’s promotion of these freedoms within the United States continues today. For example, the MPA has publicly supported the passage of anti-SLAPP laws, a legal shield against bad-faith libel suits. In 2016, then-MPA head Chris Dodd explained in an op-ed that the group’s backing of these laws was grounded in its commitment to free expression:\n\n“The First Amendment right to free speech undergirds all other rights, and here at the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), we value and protect this freedom because it’s at the heart of everything we do. We take pride in our role protecting the rights of filmmakers to tell their stories—and for audiences to hear and see them.”\n\nIn contemporaneous remarks, given while accepting an award from Georgia’s First Amendment Foundation, Dodd elaborated that:\n\n“When I assumed the role of CEO of the Motion Picture Association, I was able to continue my passion for advocating First Amendment Rights—the right of creators to tell stories without fear of retribution— the right to be heard. Being an advocate of the First Amendment in the audiovisual world does not mean you agree with what you are hearing or support what you are seeing. What it does mean is that you are willing to fight for the right of those voices to be heard and seen. And powerful stories need to be shared. Our best films and television shows often say what urgently needs to be said—even if what they have to say offends. As an art form, the movies—as well as top quality TV programs—have the power to change people’s minds—and even people’s lives.\n\n. . .\n\nWhether it’s confronting tyrants abroad, speaking truth to power at home, or pushing the limits—and buttons—of our society’s tolerance and cultural understanding, motion pictures and television often dare to say the unspeakable. Which is why, since our founding in 1922, the MPAA has fought for the First Amendment rights of not only our moviemakers—and our moviegoers—but the audiences, as well.”\n\nThese are powerful words in defense of free expression. They are especially powerful, however, when contrasted with the MPA’s words on Chinese governmental censorship. In a 2013 statement, for example, the MPA declared that while it supported the “maximum creative rights for artists,” the “adjustment of some of our films for different world markets is a commercial reality, and we recognize China’s right to determine what content enters their country.” Such a statement seems to green-light collaboration with Chinese censorship, and in comparison to the MPA’s forceful defense of free speech within the United States, this circumscribed defense of artists’ creative rights is striking.\n\nTo date, the MPA has not released any public guidance on how studios can or should push back against censorship by the Chinese government. The Association’s approach seems to prioritize market realities over an effort to defend the free expression of Hollywood’s storytellers and the audiences they serve, an unsurprising but uninspiring effort.\n\nUltimately, the MPA and other key Hollywood players should make the same commitment to resisting censorship from governments around the world as they historically have to resisting censorship from our own.\n\nPEN America recognizes that the calculus facing profit-making global filmmakers and studios differs from that confronting individual book authors. Moreover, the business relationships, investment ties, and ownership structures that have solidified Chinese influence in Hollywood dictate that many filmmakers come to this issue with a set of vested interests in place. As this report takes pains to explain, Beijing has structured its censorship model on forcing Hollywood studios to cooperate with its strictures, dangling the carrot of major box office returns alongside the stick of regulatory punishment for noncooperation. While there is space for studios to negotiate with Beijing regulators, such space is circumscribed.\n\nAnd yet there is still room for Hollywood to adopt some principled strategies and practices to govern their interactions with the Chinese government.\n\nFirstly, Hollywood decision-makers must develop a set of practices on how to respond to governmental requests to modify and censor content—practices that affirm and protect artistic freedom to the fullest possible extent. Secondly, Hollywood as a community must develop broader practices to counteract the more generalized and less explicit pressures that censorious governments can bring to bear, the types of pressures that encourage self-censorship and that shrink the space for honest and fearless storytelling.\n\nBoth sets of practices must revolve around transparency, more open and honest communication, and a clear-eyed acknowledgment of the nature of the problem.\n\nTo encourage Hollywood to develop these strategies, PEN America recommends the following steps:\n\n1. Responding to overt and anticipated requests and demands for censorship by Beijing or its proxies\n\nHollywood studios must, foremost, stand firm that the censored, Chinese-version of the film not become the default version of the film offered to global audiences. Filmmakers cannot reduce their work to the lowest common denominator of only content that is deemed acceptable by one of the world’s most censorious regimes. Thus, PEN America recommends that all Hollywood studios pledge that, if they comply with anticipated or actual censorship from Beijing, either in response to a direct request from regulators or in an anticipatory effort to self-censor, that they do so only for the version of the film made available within mainland China, not for the film’s global release.\n\nWe appreciate that, by doing so, Hollywood studios will make their compliance with Chinese censorship even more visible, as viewers will be able to compare the Chinese release with the worldwide release and spot the differences. But the secret that Hollywood has been censoring itself to please Beijing is already out. If filmmakers are unwilling to resist one government’s de facto censorship power over a film’s worldwide release, then Hollywood will truly be abandoning its chance to draw a line in the sand in defense of freedom of expression, and against permitting the Chinese government to wield its censorship over audiences the world over.\n\nSecondly, and relatedly, we believe that there is still room for Hollywood filmmakers to demonstrate their commitment to freedom of expression by openly and transparently acknowledging when, and how, a film’s content has been changed in response to a censor’s request.\n\nThe issue of Chinese governmental influence in Hollywood will remain under-examined and under-discussed as long as Hollywood decision-makers continue to discuss it only behind closed doors. Yet, while this outcome may sound ideal to some Hollywood executives, practices in other industries demonstrate the value of transparency both as a good in and of itself and as a means of heading off bad press. Accordingly, PEN America recommends that Hollywood studios commit to publicly sharing information on all censorship requests received by government regulators for their films. Such information would go a long way toward making visible this semi-visible phenomenon, illuminating the contours of Beijing’s censorship and giving film professionals and laypeople alike a better understanding of where the redlines truly lie—thus reducing the uncertainty that enables self-censorship.\n\nAgain, we are aware that Hollywood studios may hesitate to disclose the pressures they come under. If a substantial enough group of studios jointly committed to such transparency, however, it could greatly mitigate this concern. Most obviously, if all members of the Big Five jointly committed to such a disclosure program, it would immediately set the standard for Hollywood at large; furthermore, it would prevent Beijing from playing studios against one another by making an example of the first studio to take such a step.\n\nSuch a disclosure could take the form of an annual report—similar, in some ways, to the disclosures that technology platforms make in regards to government take-down requests and their responses. Additionally or conversely, it could come in the form of disclosures in the credits of movies themselves, similar to the “no animals were harmed” end credits disclosure that has demonstrated Hollywood’s commitment against animal cruelty for the majority of films that involve animal actors.\n\nWere Hollywood studios willing to make such a unified public commitment, it would be a powerful demonstration that Hollywood executives are interested in addressing the problem of government censorship in a thoughtful and conscientious way . . . rather than simply hoping the problem remains invisible to the average global moviegoer.\n\nStudios may also be inspired to act (again, not unlike tech companies) in order to preempt government-mandated disclosures. Earlier this year, Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wisconsin) proposed a template for potential federal legislation on the issue, mooting the idea that the U.S. government should require Hollywood studios to disclose whether a film had been altered “to fit the demands of the Chinese Communist Party.”\n\nSuch a disclosure would only reveal one aspect of Beijing’s censorship, since it would presumably not apply to acts of anticipatory self-censorship from Hollywood studios, who consult with experts and advisors in order to make content decisions even before Beijing’s censors officially com"
