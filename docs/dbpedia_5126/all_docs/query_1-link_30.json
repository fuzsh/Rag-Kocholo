        "text": "WINNER:\n\nGIRLS WILL BE GIRLS\n\nDirected by Shuchi Talati\n\nIndia/France/USA/Norway, 2024\n\nA unanimous choice, we appreciate many aspects of this touching and subtle film. The film begins in a familiar manner, presenting the story of a young girl’s coming-of-age, but it quickly subverts expectations and unravels traditional modes of telling such a story. The film’s compelling narrative shows a young girl who simultaneously learns and unlearns the rules that govern gender and sexuality, as she explores her own desires and learns to respect and appreciate the desires of others. Most notably, the film represents a complex and nuanced mother-daughter relationship. Rather than shy away from the frustration and competition that many cultures often encourage in female relationships, Girls Will Be Girls uses these well-worn tropes to upend their dominance, and instead, presents a relationship between women that comes from a place of care, support, and mutual respect. We can’t wait to see what the filmmakers do next!\n\nSpecial Jury Award:\n\nFOREMOST BY NIGHT\n\n(Sobre todo de noche)\n\nDirected by Víctor Iriarte\n\nSpain/Portugal/France, 2023\n\nWe enjoy this film’s distinctive form and content. Beginning with a hand tracing an uneven line on a map, the film continues this meandering trajectory both in its technical and narrative styles. We appreciate the filmmakers’ gusto most of all; the film takes risks, challenges cinematic conventions, and blends archival footage and narrative filmmaking to tell an important story of the politics surrounding adoption in Spain. We look forward to seeing future films by this emerging filmmaker.\n\nWINNER:\n\nSUGARCANE\n\nDirected by Julian Brave NoiseCat & Emily Kassie\n\nCanada/USA, 2024\n\nIn Sugarcane, Julian Brave NoiseCat and Emily Kassie unearth a shameful, heartbreaking story of injustice and genocide with raw emotion and intimate access, bringing us in lockstep with their courageous subjects whose pain we feel as they learn their devastating truth. The storytelling is beautiful, complex and gripping – a skillful blend of personal essay and investigative journalism that speaks to a uniquely collaborative filmmaking.\n\nSpecial Jury Award for Innovation:\n\nSWAMP DOGG GET HIS POOL PAINTED\n\nDirected by Isaac Gale & Ryan Olson\n\nUSA, 2024\n\nSwamp Dogg Gets His Pool Painted is an utterly fresh take on the music biopic, restoring a forgotten music legend to his rightful stature via an original, funny, wildly creative approach. A delightful and authentic journey into what it truly means to live an artist’s life through one of the more memorable characters – and pools – of our time.\n\nSpecial Jury Award for Directing:\n\nPORCELAIN WAR\n\nDirected by Brendan Bellomo & Slava Leontyev\n\nUkraine/USA/Australia, 2024\n\nPorcelain War is a remarkable film that, with a magical touch, manages to find beauty and humanity on the front lines of war via inspiring, gifted artists who have the highest stakes in defending their country. The filmmaking is remarkably inventive in its mix of self-shot, professional, and exquisitely animated footage that embeds a fragile beauty in the brutal reality of war. All set to an unforgettable score worthy of our brave and creative cast.\n\nWINNER:\n\nTENNIS, ORANGES\n\nDirected by Sean Pecknold\n\nUSA, 2024\n\nWe thought this film had the sense of dream-like surprise and magic that animation at its best is capable of. The story is told compellingly through both traditional film staging and graphic design thinking in a manner that transforms the mundane reality of the characters."
