Other than a few surprise appearances, this will be the first time Keenan has toured with the band since 2006. This will also be the first time the “Deliverance” lineup of the group has played together since 2001.\n\nCheck out tour rehearsal video footage:\n\nCorrosion of Conformity prepares for a European tour in March 2015. Pepper Keenan, Mike Dean, Reed Mullin, Woody Weatherman\n\nvideo by randy ada\n\nCOC recently emerged from hibernation as a trio and released 2012’s eponymous album and 2014’s “IX” to wide acclaim, but many have been eagerly awaiting the return of Pepper Keenan.\n\nThe band were originally an influential hardcore punk/heavy metal crossover act before reaching critical success with a new lineup on 1991’s “Blind” album. That trajectory continued with wider appeal as Keenan took over as primary vocalist on “Deliverance” (1994) and “Wiseblood” (1996).\n\nThese two recordings in particular fused the raw energy of the previous albums with some great strides forward in classic rock inspired songwriting and more spacious production and execution, which were often copied but rarely equalled.\n\nThis juggernaut gained mass and momentum with relentless touring alongside Metallica, Clutch, Eyehategod and many more.\n\nEventually following “In the Arms of God”, 2005, Keenan focused all energy on his hometown band Down.\n\nUntil now, that is.\n\nRecent internet chatter on the subject of a reunion turns out be true.\n\nAsked about future plans, bassist Mike Dean said, “This is all about going out and celebrating some of the classic material, and at the same time it’s about tuning up the chemistry and the energy to possibly create a new album or two with this lineup.”\n\nMARCH 2015\n\nSATURDAY 7 MANCHESTER ACADEMY 2\n\nSUNDAY 8 GLASGOW GARAGE\n\nMONDAY 9 NOTTINGHAM RESCUE ROOMS\n\nWEDNESDAY 11 BRISTOL BIERKELLER\n\nTHURSDAY 12 COLCHESTER ARTS CENTRE\n\nFRIDAY 13 LONDON ELECTRIC BALLROOM"
