        "text": "Behold! Our definitive, objective, indisputable list of the single best heavy metal band from every U.S. state, complete with a song from each artist.\n\nThis took hundreds of hours to put together and caused so many arguments that there's still tension in the air across K! Towers (some people really love Skeletonwitch).\n\nSo without further ado, let's jump in to the most extensive deep dive into America's metal scene that you'll read today.\n\nSince 2009, the co-ed duo known as Wolvserpent has honed a mix of doom, drone, black metal, and classical minimalism that sounds more like a Norwegian forest than Boise, Idaho. Their thoughtful, spiritual, and terrifyingly haunting music is to be enjoyed in a quiet, dark room – but not for too long, if one values one’s sanity.\n\nRequired Listening: Perigea Antahkarana (2013)\n\nThough perhaps better known in Europe than in the U.S., this influential Indianapolis-based outfit was crucial to the doom metal genre as a whole for the better part of 15 years. A must-listen for any riff-hungry stoner who thinks Black Sabbath makes for easy listening.\n\nRequired Listening: Conquerer (2008)\n\nWith no shortage of swamplands, it makes sense that New Orleans’ greatest metal band sounds just like the bayou. Eyehategod are as sludgy as they come, with plenty of mid-to-slow-tempo tunes ideal for dazed nodding.\n\nRequired Listening: Take As Needed For Pain (1993)\n\nThe term “metalcore” gets bandied about in describing all types of hybrid acts these days – but as one of the first metallic hardcore bands to emerge in the United States, Converge can be credited not only with inventing the genre, but continually elevating it. Today, they are still as relevant as ever, having released one of the greatest albums of 2017, The Dusk In Us.\n\nRequired Listening: Jane Doe (2001)\n\nEasily the most underground band on this list, Octagon is largely the work of Thomas Mortigan, a black metal musician based in Natchez, Mississippi. Mortigan has released a handful of works in the last 15+ years, but they’re nearly impossible to find. Case in point: only 100 copies of his last album, Sigils Of Ram – which features vocals from former Gorgoroth singer, Pest – were printed… on cassette.\n\nRequired Listening: Death Fetish (2007)\n\nOften overshadowed by New York, New Jersey is perhaps the most underrated breeding ground for rock and metal in the U.S. Just ask Overkill, NJ’s O.G.s (often referred to as 'the Motörhead of thrash metal'), who – with 19 albums over the course of 40 years – though legends within the scene, should be far better known than they are.\n\nRequired Listening: The Years Of Decay (1989)\n\nIn their younger years, Forté played so fast that some of their recordings sounded as if they were sped up after the fact. The speed metal band still play with vigour today, but their live show schedule has slowed to a crawl since their last album was released in 2012.\n\nRequired Listening: Stranger Than Fiction (1992)\n\nIt just makes sense that Red Fang hail from Oregon. They look and sound like four dudes who got lost in the woods for a dozen years, living off of nothing but hand-strangled coyotes and kegs of beer. In short, they make stoner metal for drinking.\n\nRequired Listening: Murder The Mountains (2011)\n\nCelebrating 20 years since their (proper) debut this year, Lamb Of God will undoubtedly live on as one of the dozen or so greatest American heavy metal bands of the 21st century. Whether or not you approve of the groovy style, there are few groups as powerful as they are precise.\n\nRequired Listening: Ashes Of The Wake (2004)\n\nThankfully no longer just “Kurt Cobain’s favorite band,” the Melvins finally get the respect they deserve for weirdo career that has spanned almost 40 years. Crucial to the growth of both grunge and sludge metal throughout the ‘90s, King Buzzo and co. are still somehow as bizarre and noisy today as ever before.\n\nRequired Listening: Houdini (1993)\n\nSome would argue that Zao is more of a club than a band, given that over 20 musicians have joined its ranks over the past decades, and no founding members remain. Regardless, the band has helped elevate metalcore with intelligent song structure and thoughtful lyrics, paving the way for a new generation of genre blurring today.\n\nRequired Listening: Where Blood And Fire Bring Rest (1998)\n\nAdmittedly, some members of Misery Signals hail from Edmonton, Canada – but given that it’s a mere 24 hour drive away from the rest of the band’s hometown of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, we’ll overlook that. The band is still an essential metalcore outfit, characterised by its contrasting mix of uncompromisingly brutal vocals, soaring melodies, and unpredictable rhythms.\n\nRequired Listening: Controller (2008)\n\nEasily the most reclusive band of any on this list (just like its home state of Wyoming), Ea has never revealed the identities of its members. Listening to the band’s mysterious funeral doom metal is what it feels like to die and not know if you’re ascending to Heaven or descending to Hell.\n\nRequired Listening: Ea Taesse (2006)"
