I was very lucky and it pushed me to be far better than I would have been otherwise.\n\nThe really good skaters were also wicked humble. It made skating very approachable and when you skate with guys like Jason Jesse, or Matt Hensley, or even Cab (he skated my brothers half pipe at the house when I was 8, I skated with him in high school), you can't help but get better just by proximity.\n\nMy daughter liked to longboard, but Bman was all bike.

Hosoi Hammerhead, April '88. I think maybe my second or third deck ever? Thunder trucks. Lots of paint pens and stickers. Really into Anthrax and Minor Threat at the time, among other shit. Note the sweet Pushead sticker and aforementioned \"favorite Thrasher Skate Rock\" sticker under the front wheels.\n\nBonus: also pictured is my first guitar, some sort of shitty Les Paul shaped thing. Still have it, though I think it's at my Ma's house. It's appropriately now covered in skate stickers and paint pen.\n\nWho the fuck is Steve Claar? This was probably '89-ish. I only vaguely remember this board. I remember putting white trucks on it... I think. Chances are it was a clearance deck or really cheap, I didn't have a lot of money back then. I remember also having a blank for a while as well, and maybe hating it because it was painted (not stained) and it didn't board slide all that well?\n\nThe only action pic I found, and it's not even of me I don't think. I'm pretty sure this is my younger brother, looks like an Alva deck and I think I remember him having that color of CTAS. Unsure if the street ramp was up in Michigan at my cousin's place, or if this was at our friend Chad who lived in our neighborhood.\n\nIn '88 I wasn't quite 15 in February, I recall the local \"skate\" shop (Roots, it was actually a camping/outdoor store that a few of us talked into carrying P&P stuff for us) did a whole thing where they sold tickets and we all took a charter bus to Dayton from my hometown in Indiana (about 2-1/2 hours) to see this contest.\n\nIf memory serves, I went to see all the big names of the time: Guerrero, Hosoi, Blender, Gonz, etc. I don't think Kele Rosecrans name was familiar to me at the time, but I remember coming away from that contest stoked on that dude's skating. For the life of me, I don't even remember why, just that he killed it. Can't really find much (anything) about him on the internets now, but I did find the video from this contest on YouTube so off I go down another rabbit hole...\n\nLast edited: Dec 10, 2020\n\njimmydean\n\nThe Official Meat of Ridemonkey\n\nSep 10, 2001\n\n42,251\n\n14,354\n\nPortland, OR\n\n#99\n\nMom tossed all my crap when they moved and I was at sea and couldn't go get it.\n\nI have zero pics.

I decided to take a drive around my 'hood today to see if there's anything interesting looking to skate close to my house. I didn't get out and take any pictures, but I found some neat stuff I think. Painted curbs, a really nice brick bank along a sidewalk that has a curb on top, some angled/ramped loading zones, a shin-high steel-edged loading dock, lots of 3 and 4 set stairs to play around on.\n\nI've also been looking around the social media sphere to see if I could find some not-so-secret spots around Denver to check out. In doing that, I found this video. The skating is pretty good, not like the crazy über pro stuff, but the thing I dug about the video is all the interesting spots they skated. Several things that weren't run-of-the-mill... the curved curb thing over dirt at ~10 minutes was a prime example.\n\nAnycrap... stoked for my board to show up and maybe have some dry weather to check it out.\n\nFull Trucker\n\nFrikkin newb!!!\n\nFeb 26, 2003\n\n10,881\n\n8,295\n\nExit, CO\n\n#106\n\nBoard arrived yesterday, disassembled save the grip tape.

Found out I bought the wrong size hardware to mount trucks with 1/8” risers... despite Doing My Own Research™ They were still a bit short. Quick trip to a local skate shop (in the mall WTF?) and I’m in business.\n\nView attachment 154190\n\nThere’s still quite a bit of snow outside, but I might be able to give’r a quick push around the parking lot across the street this afternoon. Just standing on it, the bushings feel WAY too soft/floppy for my 205# 48-year-old ass.

I was lucky to do front side rail slides. The grinds now are just insane.\n\nJust nutty.\n\nI was on a ride the other day when I pulled though a university area that looked a lot like that. There were some kids with boards hanging out, none of them skating. I though \"Maybe they are waiting for some nebulous authority figure to go away so they can grind.\" So I got a coffee and chilled in the shade and acted casual, just to see some skilz. Pretty soon they got up, I thought oh yeah, gonna see some some skin left on the pavement....and they walked away. Carrying their boards, smoking...none of them even skating a lick.\n\n#lame\n\njimmydean\n\nThe Official Meat of Ridemonkey\n\nSep 10, 2001\n\n42,251\n\n14,354\n\nPortland, OR\n\n#116\n\nThe kid across the street has a board and a scooter, but I think he is a freshman this year, so the scooter has been MIA. He isn't bad, but he has no heart. A friend of his dad's made him a steel rail and I built a little kicker out of scrap, but he's done shit with it.\n\nI've spent hours thinking of all the ways I could injure myself on both of those and he doesn't seem to care. I didn't skate because it was cool (it wasn't), I skated because I loved it. I spent countless hours in the alley learning wall rides. He hits the rail a few times, without committing, and stops. That's it. I don't get it.\n\n#117\n\nYours truly, circa 1993 ish while competing full time in the Columbia river rodeo circuit\n\n#118\n\nYours truly, current, still skating. Love them electric long boards\n\nLast edited: Mar 12, 2021"
