        "text": "Corrosion of Conformity (also known as C.O.C.) is an American heavy metal band from Raleigh, North Carolina formed in 1982.\n\nCorrosion of Conformity\n\n(also known as C.O.C.) is an\n\nAmerican heavy metal band from Raleigh, North Carolina formed in 1982.\n\nHistor\n\nEarly years\n\n(1982?1987)\n\nCorrosion of Conformity (C.O.C.) was formed in Raleigh, North Carolina\n\nby bassist and vocalist Mike Dean, guitarist Woody Weatherman and drummer Reed\n\nMullin in early 1980s. Their hardcore punk-oriented 20-track debut Eye for\n\nan Eye?the only album featuring the vocalist Eric Eycke?was released in\n\n1984 (later re-released by Caroline Records during 1990). Soon after, Eycke\n\nleft the band and C.O.C. continued as a three-piece with Dean and Mullin\n\nsharing the vocal duties on the 1985's follow-up Animosity. In 1987, COC\n\nrecruited Simon Bob Sinister away from their fellow Carolina band and Death\n\nRecords labelmates, Ugly Americans. The band's 1987 release, Technocracy\n\nfeatured the hectic thrash musicianship of COC with a cleaner vocal style than\n\nthey had in the past.\n\nDeparture of Mike\n\nDean, hiatus and Blind (1987-1992)\n\nMike Dean departed in 1987 and Simon Bob soon followed, leaving COC in a\n\nstate of flux for a couple of years. The remaining members re-tuned the line up\n\nand searched for a new vocalist, even posting a classified in Flipside Fanzine\n\nfor a singer similar in sound to \"James Hetfield or Ozzy Osbourne\" to\n\ngo with their new metal sound. Caroline Records released some old tracks with\n\nMike singing during this time with the aptly named Six Songs With Mike Singing\n\nEP.\n\nAfter much searching, Karl Agell was recruited on vocals, Phil Swisher\n\non bass and Pepper Keenan as a second guitarist. COC gravitated towards a more\n\nstraightforward heavy metal sound. By 1991's Blind they had become a\n\nheavy metal band. Blind was the first COC album to receive mainstream\n\nattention. The video for \"Vote With A Bullet\" received airplay on MTV\n\nand the album cracked the Billboard Heatseekers chart in early 1992. The album\n\nhas sold around 250,000 copies in the US to date.\n\nDeliverance\n\nand Wiseblood (1993-1998)\n\nIn 1993, Agell and Swisher left the band and formed the band Leadfoot,\n\nDean returned and Keenan took over lead vocals. The following year COC signed\n\nto Columbia Records, and the release of Deliverance saw the band move\n\ntoward Southern metal, a sound that they also carried onto the Wiseblood\n\nand America's Volume Dealer albums. In 1994, their song Big Problems was\n\nfeatured on the Clerks soundtrack. The song Clean My Wounds was also featured\n\nin the anime movie Tekken: The Motion Picture.\n\nDeliverance\n\nwas the band's biggest selling album. This was mainly due to the\n\nsingles \"Albatross\" and \"Clean My Wounds\" becoming Top 20\n\nhits on rock radio and the album managed to spend almost 4 months on the\n\nBillboard Top 200, peaking at No.155. On the Heatseekers chart, it peaked at\n\nNo.5 and lasted almost a year on that particular chart. US sales for the album\n\nwere just over 440,000 by the end of 2005 and this album should be eligible for\n\nGold status within the next few years.\n\nWiseblood\n\nwas released in October 1996. Despite producing a Top 30 radio hit with\n\n\"Drowning In A Daydream\" and a worldwide tour with Metallica, the\n\nalbum failed to match the sales set by the previous album. Total US sales to\n\ndate are just over 150,000. COC was nominated for a 1998 Grammy Award in the\n\n\"Best Metal Performance\" category for the song \"Drowning in a\n\nDaydream\".\n\nAmerica's Volume\n\nDealer\n\nand In the Arms\n\nof God (1999-2006)\n\nPepper Keenan live on stage\n\nSoon after the release of Wiseblood, Columbia dropped COC, who\n\nthen moved to Sanctuary Records. The band released its first album for its new\n\nlabel, America's Volume Dealer, in November 2000. The album was even\n\nmore of a commercial failure than Wiseblood not even managing to make the\n\nBillboard Top 200. However, the single, \"Congratulations Song\", did\n\ngive the band another Top 30 hit. No videos were made from the album. Mullin\n\nleft the band in 2001. Since then the band has worked with a series of\n\ndrummers: Jimmy Bower of Eyehategod, local Raleigh percussion professor Merritt\n\nPartridge, Stanton Moore of Galactic and Reed's former drum technician Jason\n\nPatterson, who previously played drums in the Raleigh-based rock band Cry of\n\nLove.\n\nIn April 2005, COC released In the Arms of God to much critical\n\nacclaim. The album performed much better than their previous effort, debuting\n\nat No.108 on the Billboard Top 200 and even topping the Heatseekers chart. This\n\nwas achieved without even one radio hit from the album. A video was made for\n\nthe song \"Stonebreaker\" which saw airplay on MTV2's recently revived Headbanger's\n\nBall. The band spent the rest of the year touring the US and Canada. They\n\nwere the opening acts for Mot?rhead and Disturbed and also went on headlining\n\ntours with Crowbar, Fu Manchu, Alabama Thunderpussy and Danko Jones all providing\n\nsupport. A European tour was scheduled for September/October 2005 but was later\n\ncancelled, after Hurricane Katrina ravaged Keenan's adopted hometown of New\n\nOrleans. A co-headlining UK tour with Clutch commenced in January 2006.\n\nRecent history (2007-present)\n\nThe band is currently on a hiatus while Pepper records and tours with\n\nDown. Starting in March, 2009 Karl Agell and Reed Mullin have started touring\n\nwith Jerry Barrett, Scott Little, and Jason Browning as \"COC-Blind\",\n\nperforming the Blind album. There are talks about COC-Blind creating original\n\nmaterial moving forward. Reed Mullin and Mike Dean along with Jason Browning\n\nare also touring in a new band called \"Righteous Fool.\"\n\nCollaborations/side\n\nprojects\n\nThey have also collaborated with a number of other artists: James\n\nHetfield of Metallica contributed vocals to the song \"Man or Ash\" on Wiseblood;\n\nWarren Haynes of the Allman Brothers' Band and Gov't Mule played slide guitar\n\non \"Stare Too Long\" on America's Volume Dealer; and Stanton\n\nMoore of Galactic played drums on In The Arms of God.\n\nMembers of COC have also participated in collaborations: Keenan plays\n\nguitar with the metal supergroup Down, and Dean contributed vocals to a track\n\ntitled \"Access Babylon\" on Dave Grohl's Probot project. Also Pepper\n\nis on Metallica's Garage Inc CD playing guitar and singing the second verse of\n\nthe Lynyrd Skynyrd song \"Tuesday's Gone\", he is also in the\n\ndocumentary \"Some Kind of Monster\" auditioning to be Metallica's\n\nreplacement for Jason Newsted.\n\nMembers\n\nLineups\n\n(1982)Benji Shelton ? vocalsWoody Weatherman ? guitarMike Dean ? bassReed Mullin - drums\n\n(1983-1984)Eric Eycke ? vocalsWoody Weatherman ? guitarMike Dean ? bass, vocalsReed Mullin ? drums\n\n(1984-1986)Woody Weatherman ? guitarMike Dean ? bass, vocalsReed Mullin ? drums\n\n(1986-1987)Simon Bob Sinister ? vocalsWoody Weatherman ? guitarMike Dean ? bass, vocalsReed Mullin ? drums\n\n(1987-1988)Simon Bob Sinister ? vocalsWoody Weatherman ? guitarReed Mullin ? drums\n\n(1988-1989)\n\n(C.O.C. on hiatus)\n\n(1989-1993)Karl Agell ? vocalsPepper Keenan ? guitar, vocalsWoody Weatherman ? guitarPhil Swisher ? bass, vocalsReed Mullin ? drums\n\n(1993-2001)Pepper Keenan ? guitar, vocalsWoody Weatherman ? guitarMike Dean ? bass, vocalsReed Mullin ? drums\n\n(2001-2002)Pepper Keenan ? guitar, vocalsWoody Weatherman ? guitarMike Dean ? bass, vocalsJimmy Bower ? drums\n\n(2002-2003)\n\n(C.O.C. on hiatus)\n\n(2003-2004)Pepper Keenan ? guitar, vocalsWoody Weatherman ? guitarMike Dean ? bass, vocals\n\n(2004-2005)Pepper Keenan ? guitar, vocalsWoody Weatherman ? guitarMike Dean ? bass, vocalsStanton Moore ? drums\n\n(2005-2007)Pepper Keenan ? guitar, vocalsWoody Weatherman ? guitarMike Dean ? bass, vocalsJason Patterson ? drums\n\n(2007-present)\n\n(C.O.C. on hiatus)Collaborators\n\nWarren Haynes ? slide guitar (\"Stare Too Long,\" America's Volume\n\nDealer)\n\nJames Hetfield ? vocals (\"Man or Ash,\" Wiseblood)\n\nRobert Stewart ? vocals (performed live, never recorded)\n\nJohn Custer ? producer of Blind, Deliverance, Wiseblood, Nativity In Black,\n\nAmerica's Volume Dealer and In The Arms Of God\n\n(C.O.C. on hiatus)\n\n(1989-1993)Karl Agell ? vocalsPepper Keenan ? guitar, vocalsWoody Weatherman ? guitarPhil Swisher ? bass, vocalsReed Mullin ? drums\n\n(1993-2001)Pepper Keenan ? guitar, vocalsWoody Weatherman ? guitarMike Dean ? bass, vocalsReed Mullin ? drums\n\n(2001-2002)Pepper Keenan ? guitar, vocalsWoody Weatherman ? guitarMike Dean ? bass, vocalsJimmy Bower ? drums\n\n(2002-2003)\n\n(C.O.C. on hiatus)\n\n(2003-2004)Pepper Keenan ? guitar, vocalsWoody Weatherman ? guitarMike Dean ? bass, vocals\n\n(2004-2005)Pepper Keenan ? guitar, vocalsWoody Weatherman ? guitarMike Dean ? bass, vocalsStanton Moore ? drums\n\n(2005-2007)Pepper Keenan ? guitar, vocalsWoody Weatherman ? guitarMike Dean ? bass, vocalsJason Patterson ? drums\n\n(2007-present)\n\n(C.O.C. on hiatus)Collaborators\n\nWarren Haynes ? slide guitar (\"Stare Too Long,\" America's Volume\n\nDealer)\n\nJames Hetfield ? vocals (\"Man or Ash,\" Wiseblood)\n\nRobert Stewart ? vocals (performed live, never recorded)\n\nJohn Custer ? producer of Blind, Deliverance, Wiseblood, Nativity In Black,\n\nAmerica's Volume Dealer and In The Arms Of God\n\n(C.O.C. on hiatus)\n\n(2003-2004)Pepper Keenan ? guitar, vocalsWoody Weatherman ? guitarMike Dean ? bass, vocals\n\n(2004-2005)Pepper Keenan ? guitar, vocalsWoody Weatherman ? guitarMike Dean ? bass, vocalsStanton Moore ? drums\n\n(2005-2007)Pepper Keenan ? guitar, vocalsWoody Weatherman ? guitarMike Dean ? bass, vocalsJason Patterson ? drums\n\n(2007-present)\n\n(C.O.C. on hiatus)Collaborators\n\nWarren Haynes ? slide guitar (\"Stare Too Long,\" America's Volume\n\nDealer)\n\nJames Hetfield ? vocals (\"Man or Ash,\" Wiseblood)\n\nRobert Stewart ? vocals (performed live, never recorded)\n\nJohn Custer ? producer of Blind, Deliverance, Wiseblood, Nativity In Black,\n\nAmerica's Volume Dealer and In The Arms Of God\n\n(C.O.C. on hiatus)\n\nCollaborators"
