        "text": "There’s a common misconception, as I’m sure we’re all aware of, that crazy record sales immediately means the music on offer is a timeless classic that everyone will love down the line. Then you remember that Crazy Town‘s The Gift of Game went platinum with more than 1.6 million copies sold.\n\nSo it’s no surprise that Corrosion of Conformity‘s legendary 1994 release Deliverance is only now reaching gold status with the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) after selling more than half a million copies. Again, this album came out 29 years ago.\n\nRemember, this album had clear bangers like “Clean My Wounds” and “Albatross” on its tracklist, both of which got decent airtime on the radio. Yes, back in the 90s that sort of thing mattered, kiddos. But that’s not all – killer tracks that didn’t get to reach the public but deserve recognition fill out the rest of the album. Songs like the incredibly heavy “Broken Man” and “Seven Days” are must-listens, while “My Grain” and “Senor Limpio” have the kind of undeniable grooves that define the band’s output with Pepper Keenan at the helm.\n\nThankfully, Corrosion of Conformity’s still kicking to this day. Their last album, 2018’s No Cross, No Crown, was a great studio effort that — once again — more people need to give a shot. “The Luddite” is a fucking banger.\n\nI guess basically this whole post was to urge every one of you to check Deliverance out. Almost three decades is a long ass time to finally reach gold status, but again — sales figures don’t necessarily equate to a killer record. Just ask Crazy Town."
