        "text": "German heavy rockers Plainride are set to support C.O.C. on the North Carolinian outfit’s upcoming run through UK and Europe. Situated around a stop at Desertfest London 2023, word of the tour comes about a month after Plainride issued their latest single, the particularly bluesy Clutch-style groover “Hello, Operator,” with Bob Vogston pulling double-duty as producer after joining the band as guitarist in 2019, following the release of what’s still Plainride‘s latest LP, 2018’s Life on Ares (review here), which came out on Ripple. “Hello, Operator” follows two other singles released over the course of 2021, and introduces bassist Dario Schattel to the fold alongside Vogston, guitarist/vocalist Max Rebel and drummer Florian Schlenker.\n\nWhether the band will tour as a trio or four-piece, I don’t know, but you can hear in “Hello, Operator” that they’ve got the sound down pat and are good to go. They’ve had a hand in organizing Ripplefest Cologne over the last however long, and while I see another date in the band’s hometown listed so that probably won’t happen, there’s a gap of four days between the Vienna and Brussels dates near the end of the run, so it wouldn’t be a surprise if either more shows got added or there’s some other trick up the tour’s sleeve.\n\nIn any case, the bottom line here is good for Plainride. They announced the tour thusly on social media:\n\nThe cat’s out the bag: We will be supporting none other than US Heavy Rock titans Corrosion Of Conformity on their upcoming European tour this May!\n\nAs longtime fans of classic COC bangers like Wiseblood and Deliverance (throwback to Max cranking his Boss Metal Zone up to eleven, trying to learn the iconic riff to Señor Limpio when he first picked up his dad’s old tele at the tender age of 17), we are more than honored to be riding alongside these legends for a solid 20 days of Rock ‘n’ Roll madness all over the continent (#129304#) A heartfelt thank you to Brenna from CRYSTAL SPIDERS and Mike Dean of COC for this mindblowing opportunity.\n\nTickets go live on Feb 1.\n\nSee y’all on the road!\n\n01.05.23 · IE · Dublin · Academy\n\n02.05.23 · UK · Glasgow · Garage\n\n03.05.23 · UK · Wolverhampton · KKs Steel Mill\n\n04.05.23 · UK · Cardiff · The Globe\n\n05.05.23 · UK · Manchester · Bread Shed\n\n06.05.23 · UK · London · Desertfest\n\n08.05.23 · DK · Copenhagen · Pumphuset\n\n10.05.23 · FR · Paris · Petit Bain\n\n11.05.23 · DE · Cologne · Luxor\n\n12.05.23 · NL · Eindhoven · Dynamo\n\n13.05.23 · DE · Aschaffenburg · ColosSaal\n\n15.05.23 · CH · Zurich · Dynamo\n\n16.05.23 · DE · Munich · Backstage\n\n17.05.23 · AT · Vienna · Szene\n\n21.05.23 · BE · Brussels · Botanique\n\nPlainride:\n\nMax Rebel – Vocals, Guitar\n\nDario Schattel – Bass\n\nFlorian Schlenker – Drums, Percussion\n\nBob Vogston – Guitar\n\nhttps://instagram.com/plainride\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/plainride\n\nopen.spotify.com/artist/2NDj8i2isAwlLIRGlNWsCh\n\nhttps://plainride.bandcamp.com/\n\nplainri.de\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/theripplemusic/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RippleMusic\n\nhttps://ripplemusic.bandcamp.com/\n\nhttp://www.ripple-music.com/\n\nPlainride, “Hello, Operator”\n\nHello, Operator by Plainride\n\nTags: Cologne, Germany, Plainride, Ripple Music"
