With their album SUFFRAGE, the band slams forth thirteen songs in twenty-three minutes in an acid bath of pure sonic fury.

If you dig it and would like to check out the rest of the record before it’s out, please let me know! Less Than Jake’s drummer Vinnie Fiorello has even reached out to the band personally to let them know how much he digs the album’s first single “Heavy Hitters“.\n\nArising in mid-2003, Abraskadabra’s new album Welcome delivers their own vision of the ska punk essence. Written as a whole band, they searched for a raw punchy sound while exploring the full capacity of melody. Instead of recording in a traditional studio environment, the seven-piece ensemble crammed themselves into an old house and captured everyone’s feelings and motivations in the moment.\n\nSince inception, the band has toured all around Brazil and the US, sharing the stage with legends like Bad Religion, Rise Against, Goldfinger, Less Than Jake, and many more. In 2014, the band’s cover of No Use For Name’s “Not Your Savior” was featured in the Fat Wreck Chords doc A Fat Wreck.\n\nLong Island’s indie emo rockers OSO OSO have just signed to Triple Crown Records!

A full list of dates can be found HERE.\n\nTwo weeks after their video premiere here on IDIOTEQ, Italian blackened chaotic crusst hardcore band STORM{O} have revealed the full stream of their new astounding record ‘Ere’.\n\nEre by STORM{O}\n\nMilwaukee based five-piece STONE is taking the hardcore scene by storm with their forthcoming, highly anticipated debut album ‘Inch of Joy‘ that’s scheduled for release on March 2nd, 2018 from Pure Noise Records.

Engineered and mixed by Derek Moree and mastered by Brad Boatright, ATHOTW’s debut is a clear, focused work of intensity that acts as the missing link between legends Godflesh and contemporaries, Youth Code. Today, CVLT Nation is pleased to premiere Rotting Forms in full. Set for a release on 1/26, Rotting Forms can be preordered from Glory Kid Ltd. / CVLT Nation\n\n’00s melodic post-hardcore rockers CHASING VICTORY have announced their first release in nearly 11 years, which is an EP titled, Friends Vol. 1.

There will be another single dropping next Thursday, Feb. 1.\n\nCHASING VICTORY originally formed in 2001, but wasn’t consistently active until 2003. A year later in 2004 they released their debut EP, A Not So Tragic Cover-Up on Mono Vs Stereo. They returned in 2005 with a more refined musical approach on their debut full-length album, I Call This Abandonment.

Listen below and contact the band via their Facebook page to book a show for this coming Summer.\n\nKharkiv is Ukraine and will always be! Fuck Russian predatory voracious imperial ambitions!\n\nЯ смогу by Zrada\n\nPolish groovy crossover hardcore act SOUL BLAST have issued the details of their new EP “The influence lab”, featuring 8 tracks that expand the expand the spectrum presented on their debut record “Juicy Groovy Cake”. The tropes of multi-style influences are self-consciously manipulated here, and the band has obviously surrounded themselves with quite uncommon vibrations. The mellower interludes bring even more interesting moments, allowing for SOUL BLAST to expand their powers with a style.\n\nLondon collage artist and DIY multi-style experimentalists ASHLEY REAKS has dropped a new surprise record called ‘The Earth Swan Sings Again’, an epic and emotional endeavour with a plethora of progresive, folk, and jazz, and avant-rock influences with some mysterious depths and a stunningly unique instrumental setting.\n\nThe Earth Swan Sings Again by Ashley Reaks\n\nSeattle crusty grind powerviolence pack ENDORPHINS LOST are streaming their side of their new explosive split with OSK. The ENDORPHINS LOST/OSK split will see release on February 1st through a coalition of underground labels, Rotten To The Core Records, Delusions Of Terror Records, Agromosh Records, You All Die Records, and New Age Pyrate Punks Records.\n\nENDORPHINS LOST released their debut LP, Choose Your Way, through Six Weeks Records in November 2016, unabashedly introducing the masses to their blistering style of metallic, grinding, crust/powerviolence.

The band refined their sound and recorded their strongest material to date, Limitless, at Eyeball Studios in Portugal. Limitless bridges the gap between the old and the new, merging the enduring influence of DMIZE, Outburst, Breakdown, Cro-Mags, and Bad Brains mixed with modern bands like Turnstile, Backtrack, Down to Nothing, and Terror.\n\nWilmington, Delaware’s straight edge metalcore / metallic hardcore pack VICIOUS EMBRACE are streaming their new killer EP called ‘Winter Demonstration’ on RAGE label. The trio of raging crossover tracks brings a solid dose of sonic assault, a familiar feel of older times, akin to releases from labels such as Carry The Weight or life.lair.regret.\n\n“Vicious Embrace” is a pure warm-up instrumental track, lingering in with gloomy tension, while also giving us a small taste for the hectic instrumentation to come. “Impure Harvest” has the band offering their full potential on display. The aggressive barking from the vocals is met with the contorting guitar work and churning drums. Together, the band emits this cold air, really driving home the emotion within their work. “Cease Life” takes a brief period to warm-up, all before unleashing this tension fueled shredding. Rather than go for straight forward speed, the material takes its time to trudge forward, dropping this dense emotional tone throughout their instrumentation. / MetalInjection\n\nWinter Demonstration by Vicious Embrace\n\nAT THE DRIVE-IN, one of the defining bands for the post-hardcore movement that would change alternative music in the 90s, is finally launching their new 3-song EP “Diamanté” on digital.

Watch below and catch the band on tour across Europe supporting DESPISED ICON this February.\n\nBelgian DIY label Black Basset Records has shared “I”, the newest repress and remaster record from instrumental funk experimentalists LA JUNGLE. When the mind bending instrumentalism gets this good, with a freestyle charm that belies LA JUNGLE’s smart arrangements, why bother adding vocals?\n\nI by LA JUNGLE\n\nCzech dirty raw, crusty d-beat hardcore punks KRÜGER are streaming a couple of new jams from their new record ‘OBLBNUTE MOZKY’, to be released on DIY Koło Records on April 4, 2018.drive\n\nKRÜGER – OBLBNUTE MOZKY LP by DIY 49 KRÜGER – OBLBNUTE MOZKY ( LP )\n\nCreator-Destructor Records is extremely excited to announce the late March release of Through All Unknown, the upcoming full-length from Bay Area-based REALMS OF VISION (members of SET YOUR GOALS and ANIMOSITY). REALMS OF VISION began in 2015 and has been establishing a name for themselves regionally with their special blend of slow destruction. Featuring Frank Costa (Animosity, Entheos) and Corey Largent on guitars and vocals, Mike Ambrose (Set Your Goals) on drums, and Brandon McCubbin on bass, the California hard-hitters are road-worn experts in their craft, and the nine tracks that comprise Through All Unknown reveal that resoundingly.\n\nUnrevenged EP by Realms Of Vision\n\nFrom the eerie opening of the intro, “Invoke,” straight into the absolutely decimating sludge/stoner riffage of “State Of Silence,” the listener can tell immediately that these musicians know what they’re doing on Through All Unknown. While combining down-tuned, expertly-written riffs and song-structures is the band’s specialty, the powerful vocals of Costa harken back to the best and darkest aspects of ’90s grunge, with a clean-singing approach that adds crucial memorable hooks to the band’s sound, while not detracting from the sheer heaviness in the slightest. Creating such a unique sound is no easy feat, but REALMS OF VISION has here succeeded in spades.\n\nTracks like “Deception Mask” and “Isolation’s Crown” reveal a combination of influences such as Alice in Chains, High On Fire, Type O’ Negative and Black Sabbath; an amalgamation of darkness, melody, and esoteric intensity, potently paired with the modern flare of Costa’s slam/death metal tendencies on guitar from his years in San Francisco’s furiously technical hometown heroes, Animosity.\n\nSabotage Records has launched a stream of the newest tape from SPRING, “a four piece from northern Germany who formed in 2015 and now are back with five more unpolished mid-tempo shots of pissed-off and dirty hardcore-punk from the basement, against perfection and trying to make punk “scheisse” again! Influenced by traditional US hardcore, some “Youth Attack” bands and who knows what else.”\n\nSPRING – II- TAPE by sabotagerecords\n\nLondon hardcore label Quality Control HQ is streaming the 2016 demo of RAPTURE, a killer youth crew punk band from Leeds!\n\nSome new faces turn out a stomper of a short sharp demo with Turning Point style vocals and the music of Floorpunch and Youth of Today.\n\nDemo '16 by Rapture\n\nWashington, DC-based GENOCIDE PACT shares the official video for “Pain Reprisal” which hails from their impending, new full-length Order Of Torment, due out this Friday via Relapse Records.\n\nOrder of Torment by Genocide Pact\n\nGENOCIDE PACT unleashes their raging sophomore full-length and Relapse debut, Order Of Torment. Recorded by Kevin Bernsten at Developing Nations in Baltimore (Full Of Hell, Code Orange, Magrudergrind), and featuring cover art from the legendary Joe Petagno (Motörhead, Pink Floyd, Autopsy, Marduk), Order Of Torment features eight tracks of pulverizing, relentless death metal that harkens to the greats while pushing the genre to chaotic new realms of possibility. With a thick, titanic crunch that focuses on crushing groove as much as skull-splitting intensity, GENOCIDE PACT is the death metal band to watch in 2018.\n\nOhio’s metalcore act THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA have premiered a new video for “Transit Blues,” the title track of the band’s latest album, released on October 7, 2016 through Rise Records.\n\nSwedish melodic death metal pioneers AT THE GATES have completed the recording process of their upcoming studio album with producer Russ Russell (Napalm Death, The Haunted, Dimmu Borgir, etc.) at Parlour Studios in the UK. ‘To Drink From The Night Itself’ will hit the streets oon May 18th, 2018 via Century Media Records.\n\nBrighton melodic pop punk rockers RIVER JUMPERS have shared a new single and video called ‘Thick Blood’.\n\nBrooklyn-based rockers RUSSIAN BATHS have dropped “Slenderman,” the first single off of their forthcoming debut EP, Penance, out 2/23 via Good Eye Records. The track premiered along with an interview on New Noise Magazine who said, “‘Slenderman’ arrests from the outset with menacing, booming drums as the jet-fuel soaked bassline meets crashing, incendiary guitars…It’s an exhilarating initial entry into the world of Penance.”\n\nIntertwining feedback and harmony with equal significance, Russian Baths paint in searing strokes finding beauty in towering, looming, incendiary noise-rock. Comprised of Luke Koz (guitar, vox), Jess Rees (guitar, keys, vox) and joined by Evan Gill Smith (bass) and Jeff Widner (drums), the band has been honing their craft and chemistry since initially storming listeners with their split single, “Ambulance / Ghost.”\n\nIncorporating dissonance into traditional song structures, Penance’s aesthetic recalls Big Black’s caustic fits, ’70s space rock, Chapel Hill’s noise pop, Big Muff driven grunge, and the angular arrangements of British post-punk. The breadth of Russian Bath’s scope in sound is marked by the distance and cohesion between singles in the furious, driving “Slenderman” and the elegant thunderstorm that is “Poolhouse.”\n\nEmotive alt rockers CADET CARTER are streaming a couple of new tracks from their debut self-titled record on Uncle-M label.\n\nCadet Carter by Cadet Carter\n\nWithin a mere few weeks since starting out in the early summer of 2017, the Munich-based four-piece have established themselves as a Punk Rock insiders’ tip, blending 90s College Rock, Punk and Emo to create their very own sound – with Germany’s leading newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung calling them a “fresh breeze of air for the genre”.Without a doubt, CADET CARTER live up to these expectations. Their version of punk-induced Indie Rock finds its place somewhere between the urgency of The Get Up Kids, Jimmy Eat World’s anthems and the lyrical candidness of Nada Surf. Still, CADET CARTER‘s sound can only be described as remarkably unique.\n\nTheir debut LP CADET CARTER is perfect the proof of this statement. The melody of Car Park Song is just as catchy as it is full of euphoria, and its lyrics speak to everyone will to change their own destiny, and start all over again.\n\nTokyo-based instrumental rock band OVUM have released a new album “In My Sanctuary”. The album features a string quartet and it lend eye-opening ferocity and intricacy to dramatic compositions woven by both the quartet and the band itself.\n\nIn My Sanctuary by OVUM\n\nIn March 2016, OVUM demonstrated this new “instrumental rock band” concept with the release of a 3-track EP, “Nostalgia,” that merged well-defined rhythms using twin pedal with metal-inspired guitar riffs.\n\nFour years on, the band returns with a full-length album, “In My Sanctuary,” and with it a solid, freshly acquired originality that can be described as “metal-oriented instrumental rock,” pushing to greater heights their newfound aggressiveness and the beautiful melodies that remain at their core. To further drive home this point, the album also features a string quartet, lending eye-opening ferocity and intricacy to dramatic compositions woven by both the quartet and OVUM themselves, as well as to the songwriting skills that first give their vision life.\n\n“In My Sanctuary” is OVUM’s career magnum opus, given flesh through the band’s renowned compositional skills and musical tenacity.\n\nFrank Turner has announced his seventh album, Be More Kind, t be released on May 4 via Xtra Mile Recordings/Polydor UK/Interscope. Check out the new single “1933,” below.\n\nYOU VANDAL! punk rockers have shared a new video for their song ‘Collapse’, coming from their latest album I Just Want to Go Back to Hell, available now through Jump Start Records.

The album was mastered by Mike Kalajian (Circa Survive, Prawn, Moving Mountains). A new song titled “Memory Trace” is debuting on Arctic Drones.\n\nLos Angeles-based progressive outfit NIGHT VERSES have dropped a surprise EP, Copper Wasp today! The three song teaser to their forthcoming full length is an introduction to the band moving forward as an instrumental trio. The EP, produced by Will Putney (Every Time I Die, Body Count, Knocked Loose, Amity Affliction) signals a dramatic change in direction and marks the start of their full US tour in support of INTERVALS.\n\nCopper Wasp by Night Verses\n\nAbout three years after the release of their ‘Debut EP’, French blackened-sludge/post-metal-hardcore five-piece SSANAHTES announced the official release of its debut and self-titled full-length album, coming out for CD & Digital formats on March through the Germany-based record label WOOAARGH (Ancst, Employed To Serve, Grim Van Dom…).\n\nS/T by Ssanahtes\n\nBirmingham old school hardcore punks BALANCE will release their demo on Demuns Run Amok Entertainment on February 23rd.\n\nThey are combining Hardcore with Grunge and Crossover elements in on punky 90es outfit. A must have for fans of bands like Turnstile.\n\nDemo ‘17 by Balance\n\nTHE SMASHING PUMPKINS are recording a reunion album with Rick Rubin! GO HERE for more details\n\nLos Angeles based indie punk rockers SPANISH LOVE SONGS have just announced their new album Schmaltz, set to be released on March 30th via A-F Records (US) and Uncle M Records (UK/Europe). The album follows their 2015 debut Sings The Blues, and their recently released EP Buffalo Buffalo, which includes two songs also featured on Schmaltz. That EP can be heard now via A-F Records.\n\nOn the new record, Spanish Love Songs’ songwriter Dylan Slocum delves into themes of guilt, depression, and stagnation while he tries to come to terms with his past mistakes and feeling like he hasn’t yet grown past them.\n\nBuffalo Buffalo by Spanish Love Songs\n\nWild punk rockers PEARS are set to embark on their first headlining tour of Australia this May. GO HERE to see the details.\n\nHuman Movement (Split w/ Direct Hit) by PEARS\n\nCvlt Nation is currently streaming “Prosector” from horror-obsessed, underground cult ILSA. The track comes by way of the band’s impending new full-length Corpse Fortress set for release this March via Relapse Records. Writes Cvlt Nation of the record overall, “The D.C. band’s fifth full length finds them continuing to hammer skulls in with the sheer density of their blown out brand of sludge. Dirty and squealing with feedback, something about their sound has always felt streetwise…”\n\nILSA weaves together tales of depravity and devil worship on their Relapse debut Corpse Fortress. Recorded by Kevin Bernsten (Full Of Hell, Code Orange, Magrudergrind, Integrity) in Baltimore, Maryland at Developing Nations, Corpse Fortress delivers nine tracks forged in filth with dense layers of emotionally draining sludge, murky, primordial doom, and feedback-laden, crusty death metal. Corpse Fortress is easily the rawest, most abhorrent, and nasty album in ILSA’s decade-long career and the perfect soundtrack for the initiated miscreants of this rapidly dying orb.\n\nBloom, the new mini-album from cinematic post-rock visionary LIGHTS & MOTION, has just received a short audio preview, and will be out everywhere on Deep Elm Records on 2 February 2018.\n\nComing out of hibernation with Bloom set on the promise of Spring, cinematic post-rock visionary LIGHTS & MOTION truly transcends emotion. Consistently beautiful, gut-wrenching and full of melancholic hopefulness, Christoffer Franzen’s unfailing creativity delivers yet again. He just gets it. “I feel really connected to the title track. I did something unusual for me in that I conceptualized a song before I had even written a note. I wanted to create a song that would sound like a flower in bloom, in that it is ever changing and evolving” says Franzen. Produced, recorded and mixed by Franzen at UpSweden Studio in Gothenburg. Mastered by Dave Cooley at Elysian Masters in Los Angeles (M83, Paramore, Serge Gainsbourg). Album artwork by Shane Labelle. Photography by Fredrik Sellergren. Absolutely stunning. (DER-580)\n\nBloom by Lights & Motion\n\nArtoffact Records presents the March 9th release of It Will Come to You, the debut full-length album by ACTORS. Stream new track “Slaves,” from It Will Come to You, here, and pre-order digital, vinyl, CD, below! From Vancouver, Canada, ACTORS electrify with a modern take on post-punk. On debut full-length It Will Come to You, anthemic songs evoke the urgency of early-’80s U2 (Boy, October, War) as well as the driving, synth-drenched scores that emanated from that era’s movie screens. As scene authority Post-Punk.com put it, the band conjures “cinematic new-wave… that belongs on a Michael Mann soundtrack.”\n\nFrontman Jason Corbett’s rich vocals command with all the passion of a young Bono and the coolness of Peter Murphy. Songs like “L’appel du Vide,” “Slaves,” “Face Meets Glass,” and “Bury Me” are bangers that glisten via Corbett’s production job: slamming beats propel warm layers of synth, guitar, and vocals. Corbett writes, produces, mixes, and masters all ACTORS music at his own Vancouver studio, Jacknife Sound.\n\nCorbett names David Bowie as a fundamental influence – Bowie’s sense of confidence and creativity are in full effect on It Will Come to You. But much more than a “retro” act, this is music that stands all on its own, full of life and unforgettable hooks. Perhaps best described as a “post-post-punk” band, ACTORS belongs in the discussion alongside bands of today like The Soft Moon and Cold Cave who are pushing music forward via a deep knowledge of the past.\n\nCorbett has also been quoted saying he was raised on the classic era of Roadrunner and Earache death metal – while these bands are nowhere to be found in ACTORS’ sound, the intensity and perfection displayed on It Will Come to You befits a former metalhead. Bassist Jahmeel Russell is an ex-member of metallic noise-rockers KEN mode and their predecessors in the Winnipeg scene, Kittens.\n\nIt Will Come To You by ACTORS\n\nMetallic-hardcore two-piece PROBLEM OF PAIN will release their new EP, I Will Always Want To Let Go, on February 9th via Blood & Ink Records. (Pre-orders are on sale now.) The lead single, “The Rust In My Veins,” is premiering now on Exclaim!.\n\nI Will Always Want to Let Go by Problem Of Pain\n\nUS crossover legends SUICIDAL TENDENCIES have premiered a new track called ‘Nothing To Lose’, coming from their new 10-track EP titled ‘Get Your Fight On!’, due out March 9th via Suicidal Records, The record will serve a proper teaser just a couple of months prior to the release of their new album ‘STill Cyco Punk After All These Years’ which will be released in July.\n\nSingapore’s groovy prog death metallers DANTE’S THEORY are celebrating their 10th anniversary with w new single called ‘Deconstruct’, to be released later in 2018.\n\nSan Diego, California-based thrash/crossover act PISSED REGARDLESS is preparing for the release of their Feed The Birds EP through Creator-Destructor Records in early February. The band and label have partnered with No Clean Singing for the premiere of the record’s “Trust No Pulse.”\n\nFeed the Birds by Pissed Regardless\n\nPISSED REGARDLESS is five-piece outfit built on pure angst and fury, unwavering in heart, and sharp in focus and performance. Following more than two years since their latest LP, Force Fed Gods, the band’s debut for Creator-Destructor Records comes in the form of the brutalizing 7″ EP titled Feed The Birds, their first new output since the revamping of their lineup. Capturing the live energy of band’s West Coast thrash metal fueled with volatile hardcore/crossover energy, Feed The Birds unloads five tracks in barely more than ten minutes. The album was recorded by Jeff Forrest at Double Time Studios in San Diego and completed with cover artwork by Richard Sampson.\n\nDreamy alt pop rockers PURE MIDS have released their debut record called ‘Optimistic-Ism’. The new musical project from song-writer/multi-instrumentalist William Gonzalez, proudcer/multi-instrumentalist Steven Martinez and THE AMBIENT LIGHT drummer Daniel Jurado, brings an adventurous, shoegazin’, neo-psychodelic set of mesmerizing jams that surprisingly create a time capsule and a box of fine surprises. Great listen.\n\nOptimistic-ism by Pure Mids\n\nNew York harsh experimenter GRIDFAILURE will release a new full-length titled Irritum in February, as the twisted project marks its two-year anniversary; the first of many new titles in its third year. The track “It Feeds On Negative Energy” is now streaming at Bandcamp.\n\nWhile contributions from a wide cast of talented collaborators are a major part of many GRIDFAILURE releases, others are executed solely by creator David Brenner, which is the case on Irritum. A savage dose of GRIDFAILURE’s effects-soaked powerdementia, Irritum attempts to manifest the dispirited tones and unwelcoming surroundings of the act’s debut, Ensuring The Bloodline Ends Here. The album swells with vicious enormity and unnerving creepout aura, Irritum’s scathing noise-driven dirges, maniac vocal wrath, and off-kilter rhythms culminate and deliver an inexorable sense of dread and paranoia with thirteen new tracks, totaling more than fifty minutes of lunatic rage. Irritum was performed, recorded, and produced by Brenner, utilizing an arsenal of instruments including guitars, bass, drums, keys, theremin, harmonica, and much more.\n\nIrritum by GRIDFAILURE\n\nToronto rock’n’roll punk rock spinsters THE KILLER WAILS have a new track “Shake It” and it can very well be the jam to shake the winter blues away. The track has the grime and guts of the Circle Jerks with the nerdy charm and wittiness from the Jello Biafra era of the Dead Kennedys .They played enough shows around Quebec and Ontario making them a household name while opening for bands like Cancer Bats,the Isotopes, The Murderburgers & The Dudes.\n\nShake It by The Killer Wails\n\nSentient Ruin label has shared the first new song from the debut demo tape by Minnesota-based primitive death metal aberration NOOSE ROT.\n\nNOOSE ROT hail from Minnesota and play just totally fucked and putrid death metal. The band came to be around a shared love of members of Gatecreeper, Skeletonwitch, and Wolvhammer for primitive and involved death metal in the vein of Autopsy, Pungent Stench, Coffins, Nihilist, Grave, and Repugnant – deciding to join forces to birth their own unholy death metal abomination that would worship at the altar of the Finnish and Swedish gods of ancestral death and decay.\n\nThe Creeping Unknown by Noose Rot\n\nGruesomely regressed and appallingly involved, In their wretched and bludgeoning debut EP NOOSE ROT spew forth a vomited cascade of complete aural filth that engulfs the listener in a blinding deluge of chainsawing guitars, steamrolling drums, and putridly tortured vocals. At its most delicate and refined The Creeping Unknown is nothing more than a coffin-born aural stampede of complete aural rot where caveman-death metal is taken to a sickening new extreme, conjuring similar diseased atmospheres as seen in bands like Cruciamentum, Vastum, Acephalix, Disma, and Grave Miasma.\n\nWILL HAVEN and FAKE FIGURES (members of ATREYU) will play a trio of California gigs in May.\n\nNew LONG NECK, Will This Do?, is out now via Tiny Engines. You can stream the well-thought alt rock indie masterpiece HERE or below.\n\nWill This Do? by Long Neck\n\nMAMMOTH GRINDER returns with Cosmic Crypt, an 11 track slab of primitive, punk-inflected death metal featuring members of Power Trip and Iron Reagan! Stream the full record below.\n\nMAMMOTH GRINDER return after five long years with their fourth full-length Cosmic Crypt, a non-stop, meteoric force of aggression and mayhem. Self-recorded by the band at Trax East in South River, NJ, mixed by Arthur Rizk (Power Trip, Sepultura, Inquisition) and mastered by Toxic Holocaust’s Joel Grind, Cosmic Crypt is an 11 track slab of primitive, punk-inflected death metal. Frontman Chris Ulsh (Power Trip, Impalers) recruited Mark Bronzino (Iron Reagan) and Ryan Parrish (Iron Reagan, ex-Darkest Hour) to take MAMMOTH GRINDER to new heights of misanthropic rage and blazing songcraft! Features stunning cover art from the legendary Joe Petagno (Motorhead, Autopsy, Angelcorpse, Pink Floyd).\n\nCosmic Crypt by Mammoth Grinder\n\nLegendary British post punk / rock band THE DAMNED have released a video for a new single, ‘Standing On The Edge Of Tomorrow’ taken from their first new album in a decade, Evil Spirits, scheduled for release on Search And Destroy / Spinefarm Records on April 13th.\n\nAmerican hit pop rocker ANDREW W.K. has released a new music video for his new jam “Ever Again”, cming from his new record You’re Not Alone, out March 2 via Sony.\n\nWales’ emotional hardcore upstarts, CASEY, have shared another powerful track and its accompanying video from their recently announced sophomore album, Where I Go When I Am Sleeping, due out March 16th via Rise Records (North America) and Hassle Records (UK, EU). “Phosphenes” highlights the growing sense of dynamics and melody on Where I Go When I Am Sleeping without ever sacrificing Casey’s raw energy. The track is also at the center of the album’s lyrical narrative, as vocalist Tom Weaver explores the fragility of existence through the lens of his own struggles with mental and physical health.\n\nCarpark Records is excited to share WENDYFIX‘s “Swinging Softly” video via Uproxx, who called the video, “an intimate glimpse into the college lives of the band members, Hyman in particular.” The album recently released two special new albums from label founder Todd Hyman’s early 90’s college bands, the aforementioned Wendyfix and Remy. Originally released on cassette and long since out of print, these gems of indie rock are newly remixed by Pat Jones (Toro Y Moi, Washed Out) and remastered by Joe Lambert from the original half-inch tape masters and are being digitally released for the first time on Todd Hyman’s Carpark Records.\n\nLong before Carpark had formed, Hyman was making music from his Chicago dorm room during the golden age of Chicago’s indie rock and punk scene. Yet on the geographical and formal edges of this cultural maelstrom was a group of young college students taking a different approach. Fusing together indie Anglophilia (New Order, Psychedelic Furs, Swervedriver) and the sensitive emo of loud/quiet acts like Slint and Bedhead, Wendyfix was a blacksheep in the Chicago indie music zeitgeist.\n\nFormed by a trio of college radio DJs from Northwestern University, the band played numerous house parties in Evanston and around Chicago before going on to play the usual haunts like the Lounge Ax, the Metro, and the brand new Empty Bottle. Things seemed to be on the up and up but then the band members, Todd Hyman, Jon Solomon (Comedy Minus One Records), Ted Pauly, and Brian McGrath graduated college and things fell apart. All that was left was two recording sessions at King Size Studios in Chicago, and two one-off recordings for compilations. A seven inch with two songs was released at the time, but until now most of the music has been unavailable.\n\nBoston atmospheric ambient rockers HEAVY SLEEPER have shared a new video for their single ‘Night Swim’.\n\n“’Empty Handed” starts things off with a chilling riff that is bound to send shivers down your spine as it leads you into the first lyric on the record; a drawn-out and haunting delivery of ‘Won’t you shed some light/on my darker side’ that kicks Alive and Well off in the right vein. ‘Night Swim’ starts off strong and ends the record in a like the dizzy final throws of a codeine trip; you’re left feeling spun and unsure of everything except the fact that you’re ready for round two of this ride” – substreammagazine.com\n\nAlive & Well by Heavy Sleeper\n\nTravis Barker’s annual tattoo convention and music festival Musink has revealed this year’s lineup, including BLINK-182, DESCENDENTS, THE ADOLESCENTS, STRUNG OUT, and more!

Take This To Heart Records had the pleasure of teaming up with Triple Crown records to release this. Catch McCafferty on tour this spring w/ Moose Blood and Lydia. GO HERE to see the dates.\n\nOhio’s McCafferty began as most good earworms should: melodies looped into and blended with pop-rock backbeats, a knack for urgent relatability, and a dedication to capturing a universal feeling. McCafferty edges on the quirky emo/rock of The Weakerthans or Rozwell Kid. We released their last album “Thanks. Sorry. Sure” on June 30th. Grab It\n\nAlso from Ohio, Heart Attack Man originally started as a solo recording project for singer/guitarist Eric Egan in 2013. Driven by an engrained appreciation for addictive melodies and hard hitting alternative rock, the project quickly evolved into a full band. Shortly after the EP Acid Rain was released the band hit the road playing throughout the US and Canada. Ready to record more the band headed to Philadelphia and began recording Ian Farmer from Modern Baseball at Headroom Studios. The result is band’s debut full length The Manson Family\n\nMidwestern melodic punk 4-piece TURNSPIT has signed with Dodgeball Records, which will release the band’s new LP ‘Desire Paths’ on February 16, 2018. The Chicago band has revealed cover art and track listing for the 12-track release, which was self-produced and engineered by Dan Tinkler, with assistance from Justin Yates, Chris DeQuick and Paddy McGuire. The album was recorded at Atlas Studios in Chicago, IL.\n\nSplit by Turnspit\n\nSymphonic blackened metallers DIMMU BORGIR have announced their new record Eonian, their first offering in 7 years, to be released on May 4th.\n\nChoosing Mental Illness As A Virtue, the raging new full-length from PHILIP H. ANSELMO & THE ILLEGALS, will descend upon the masses this Friday, January 26th. Revolver is offering up an advance taste of the record alongside a live video of “Finger Me.” Hear Choosing Mental Illness As A Virtue now courtesy of Revolver at THIS LOCATION.\n\nPHILIP H. ANSELMO hasn’t just paved his own path; he’s bulldozed it with his bare hands. His primal, powerful presence led Pantera to Grammy Award nominations, sales of twenty million albums worldwide, legions of diehard fans, and an indisputable heavy metal legacy. Simultaneously, Down carved out a distinct niche with a gold-selling debut and three more critically acclaimed releases. Superjoint made a triumphant return in 2016 and in the midst of everything, ANSELMO joined Scour alongside members of Pig Destroyer and Cattle Decapitation and teamed up with horror icon Bill Moseley for the Bill & Phil project. However, PHILIP H. ANSELMO & THE ILLEGALS speaks to a certain need for him.\n\nInstead of treading the same ground, ANSELMO and his bandmates in THE ILLEGALS, open up another doorway altogether with their 2018 sophomore release, Choosing Mental Illness As A Virtue. It’s extreme, abrasive, aggressive, and anthemic. In other words, it’s purely ANSELMO.\n\nDurham, NC pop punks THE SECOND AFTER have signed with Revival Recordings and are debuting a new music video for “Homewreck Sick” below. The song appears on the band’s upcoming label debut EP, “Treadmill at the Finish Line,” out April 6.\n\nThe release of THE LAST GANG’s debut FAT full-length, Keep them Counting, is all set for March 2nd!

Furthermore, “We Fight” is accompanied by the David Mack – Emmy nominated writer and artist behind Daredevil from Marvel Comics – directed official music video. Rolling Stone declared, “The powerful song explores the fighting spirit and strength found within a community,” with Consequence of Sound adding, “the motivational anthem encourages listeners to lift each other up in these trying times.” Get more details HERE.\n\nModern Thrash Metal trailblazers HAVOK continue to promote their much acclaimed latest album “Conformicide” and will make their return to European stages for a tour in April together with Darkest Hour, Cephalic Carnage and Harlott. Here is a list of all upcoming European dates.\n\nOhio melodic emo rockers ABSOLUTE HERO will release new single “Death of Innocence” digitally on February 9th.

The band create a somber, reflective atmosphere with their seamless shifts between ambient soundscapes and energetic emo tracks.\n\nA follow-up to their 2016 debut EP, With A Heavy Heart displays a natural progression and maturity. Old Notes explore their sonic boundaries and experiment with more subdued buildups to crashing climaxes, all the while evoking the same tension and release within the listener. The experiences and thoughts conjured throughout the record expose listeners to more pensive, darker perspectives, while taking them on the same journey of questioning and self-discovery. Much unlike their debut EP, Former Self, this new record tackles darker and heavier life struggles including suicide, loss, abusive relationships, and overall unease with life. “A vast divergence from the last record, With A Heavy Heart comes from a snapshot in time with no light at the end of the tunnel.” The lyrical myriad of emotion is reflected within the trancelike, incisive guitars and heavy-hitting percussions, as well as heartfelt clean vocals that often break into screams with palpable intensity. With the combination of highly evocative lyrics and heavy instrumentation, Old Notes have created a dynamic record that serves as the pinnacle of their talent, introspection, and exploration. Old Notes will release their sophomore album, With A Heavy Heart, through Old Press Records on Friday, February 16th, 2018."
