        "text": "Reviews\n\nCorrosion of Conformity Technocracy 12″\n\nCOC seems to be sidestepping the whole speedmetal/crossover scene with this new release. Their sound now takes influences from mid-period DISCHARGE and early BLACK SABBATH, but COC still has the two things most other punk/metal bands lack: originality and intelligence. Thumbs up.\n\nReviewer Walter Glaser\n\nLabel Combat Core / Death\n\nIssue MRR #49 • June 1987\n\nCorrosion of Conformity / N.O.T.A. split cassette\n\nThis sucks! Wait, are you kidding? This is a live recording of C.O.C.’s metallic madness and NOTA’s HC barrage, with good production and comes with lyrics. Fuckin’ righteous shit, dude.\n\nReviewer Walter Glaser\n\nLabel M.S.A.M.\n\nIssue MRR #48 • May 1987\n\nCorrosion of Conformity Animosity LP\n\nSmack! Wallop!…Rough punches of raw lightning-fast metallic energy as this new C.O.C. broadens their audience range. Now a three-piece with bassist Mike Dean coughing out the vocals, the excitement never stops while Woody grinds out the gritty chords and Reed pounding that skin-kit. Might seem a bit different, but no band keeps it abrasive like C.O.C.\n\nReviewer Pushead\n\nLabel Death / Enigma\n\nIssue MRR #27 • August 1985"
