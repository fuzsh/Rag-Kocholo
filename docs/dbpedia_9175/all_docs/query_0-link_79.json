        "text": "I don't know. I'm a big fan of Pepper and his work in Down and COC. He is one of my biggest influences. I just bought the In the Arms of God album and its awesome.\n\nI wish they would cover them more in magazines. You never hear anything about them.\n\nI never could figure it out. They are a fantastic band, and IMO don't have filler material. They just write damn good songs. I have loved all of their stuff, starting with Eye For An Eye. I still have all the older stuff on vinyl.\n\nEye for an Eye\n\nAnimosity\n\n6 songs with Mike singing (yes, that's the name of an EP)\n\nTechnocracy\n\nBlind\n\nIt's kind of odd, because they couldn't seem to settle on a singer, or a trademark sound, until Pepper came along. Vote with a bullet must have been a sore spot for Karl Agell. He sings on the entire Blind album, except for one song, and that's the one that gets all the attention. Then, he's gone, and I truly believe that Deliverance was the album where COC finally gelled. Mike Dean came back from his peace corps stuff, and Pepper became the full time singer. Pepper, Woody, Mike, and Reed is what COC is all about as far as I'm concerned. Wiseblood was even better. It's a {censored}ing killer CD. Maybe my tastes have changed over the years, because as much as I liked the old hardcore stuff, I really prefer their newer stuff. It's too bad Reed had back problems, and Stanton Moore stepped in on drums for In the Arms of God. Not that he's a bad drummer, but, Reed is better. On Live Volume, Jimmy Bower took over on drums, and either didn't have the time, or just didn't bother to learn the songs properly. It's still a fantastic live album, but not as good as if Reed was on drums.\n\nI'm really hoping that they have at least one more album in them. Hopefully with Reed back on drums too.\n\nI never could figure out why they aren't huge. Maybe they don't like being mass marketed. They are certainly better than anything else on the record store shelves these days. But then, I'm kinda biased, as they are my favourite band.\n\nDamn shame..I've been wondering why for years.. Bad timing ? Maybe Metallica overshadowed them like Megadeth, but worse? Metallica was headed Stoner in the early 90s..It was a strange time for harder bands in between the Grunge and the blossoming Nu Metal eras..It still ain't happening tho, so maybe blame the Label?. I mean there's gotta be enough people that like the Stoner Metal? But it don't get promoted, and it doesn't sell, so guess not?..It continues to stay on the edge of the underground. The average person has never even heard of these bands. . I like the newest album, but Wiseblood is probably my favorite... :lem:\n\nAmerica's Volume Dealer one of the greatest albums of all time. Great Southern groove stoner rock. Give this album a listen and you won't be sorry you did. This sludge is the bomb and if you dig Sabbath and Skynyrd here you go.... Pepper and crew are the real deal no BS poser crap here. They have some guitar teaching vids on youtube and they are funny as hell.\n\nPopularity or airplay really means nothing. These guys had their radio day with Deliverance which has great stuff. They sound just as good if not better than that now. They still tour and sell records and get mention in guitar ads and everything but lets be real they ain't pretty like Bon Jovi. Get my drift. Turn people on to these guys and just let em simmer... Peace"
