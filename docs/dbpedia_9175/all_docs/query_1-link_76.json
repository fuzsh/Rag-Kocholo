        "text": "It seems like only yesterday that Rock Titan Music Television had caught up with DragonForce at Chicago Open Air. At that point ‘Reaching Into Infinity’ had just come out. Marc Hudson hadn’t event done that many interviews regarding his 3rd album with the band yet. That said, if Hudson’s enthusiasm about the release of DragonForce’s 7th album is any indication, their next creation should be awesome. Just a little recap from our conversation:\n\nMarc Hudson: “I love the way it’s been written. I love the concept behind it. The production. All that stuff. I think it’s really cool. Playing the songs live is like the most fun ever. We do “The Edge of the World”, the longest song on there. Fans seem to be liking it. It’s a lot of fun.”\n\nDragonForce Marc Hudson Interview with Scotty J\n\nBased on the success of ‘Reaching Into Infinity‘, and Marc Hudson’s excitement about creating new music with the band, you know this 8th studio album will be something special! Not only that, but you’ll have the chance to see that material performed LIVE on the Megacruise. Next year may be the year that Rock Titan finally decides to spend some significant time on the high seas!\n\nMore from Metal Blade Records:\n\nOn October 13-18, 2019, DragonForce will join Megacruise, which departs from Los Angeles, CA and boasts a line-up of Megadeth, Anthrax, Testament, Corrosion of Conformity, Devildriver, Doro, Armored Saint, John 5, Metal Church, and many more artists!"
