        "text": "Corrosion of Conformity drummer Reed Mullin passed away at age 53 earlier this week. Tributes have been pouring in from all over the rock and metal world, now including Corrosion of Conformity themselves.\n\n“A badass drummer:\n\nReed could play all of the metal stuff, cymbal grabs, proto blast beats with only one bass pedal. He could cop one hundred different styles and reference them in his own way. Everything from Earl Hudson and Clive Burr to Neil Peart (RIP) to Mitch Mitchell and Bill Ward. From John Bonham to Phil Taylor and Nicko McBrain.\n\nAll the while he was creating his own thing, odd times and polyrhythms played nonchalantly, powerful, simple, deliberate sections, all of the possibilities were in fact possible but utilized thoughtfully, in the proper place, for the proper effect, as the song demanded. Musically speaking, what more could you ask for?”\n\nReed Mullin drummed for Corrosion of Conformity between 1982 and 2001. Mullin joined again in 2010 when the band got back together, and has been filled in for in recent years live by such legends as Jean-Paul Gaster (Clutch), Chris Adler (ex-Lamb of God), Eric Hernandez (Torche), and Mullin's own drum tech John Green.\n\nWe are still stunned by the news of Reed's passing and send our sincerest and continued condolences out to Reed's friends and family."
