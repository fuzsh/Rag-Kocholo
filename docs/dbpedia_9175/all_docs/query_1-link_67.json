I just hope they go on first so I can leave before CC comes on.\n\nthe front bottoms aren't breaking up damnit lol\n\nalso if they were it wouldn't be any of these listed bands that would open lol it is not them\n\nI came to post about this. Also doing the Newport Music Hall the day after, which is about 1,700 and then Express! Live Outdoors which is around 5K I think? Shows are 6/20, 21 and 22.\n\nI'm definitely gonna try to do Newport, if not Express Live will also be cool but I definitely want to go to one of them.\n\nI'm not a big enough fan to go to that Basement show haha Wouldn't feel right taking the tickets from someone else"
