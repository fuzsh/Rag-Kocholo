        "text": "Ghosts Of The Road is an intimate day-in-the-life-of portrait series, featuring some of today’s top rock and metal acts as they navigate a rigorous life on the road. Filmed entirely on one day during a band's tour, these episodes capture the everyday goings-on of a modern rock tour from arrival until the band hits the stage. This fly-on-the-wall perspective aims to offer more to the fans than the traditional mic-in-the-face interview.\n\nGhosts Of The Road presents a personal portrait of todays top acts as they work hard to bring the rock to the masses. New episodes every Thursday.\n\nEpisode 9: Corrosion Of Conformity\n\nCorrosion Of Conformity have reunited with vocalist/guitarist Pepper Keenan for a new studio album and their current European tour. Keenan played his first full show with the band since 2006 on March 7th at Manchester Academy 2 in Manchester, England. Fan-filmed video can be viewed below:\n\nThe setlist was as follows:\n\n\"These Shrouded Temples...\"\n\n\"Señor Limpio\"\n\n\"King Of The Rotten\"\n\n\"Heaven's Not Overflowing\"\n\n\"Long Whip/Big America\"\n\n\"Wiseblood\"\n\n\"Seven Days\"\n\n\"Paranoid Opioid\"\n\n\"13 Angels\"\n\n\"Albatross\"\n\n\"A National Acrobat\" (Black Sabbath)\n\n\"My Grain\"\n\n\"Stonebreaker\"\n\n\"Goodbye Windows\"\n\nEncore:\n\n\"Broken Man\"\n\n\"Vote With A Bullet\"\n\n\"Clean My Wounds\"\n\nClips from the band's pre-tour rehearsal ssessions can be seen below:\n\nThe tour is the first time Keenan has toured with the band since 2006. This will also be the first time the Deliverance lineup of the group has played together since 2001.\n\nC.O.C. recently emerged from hibernation as a trio and released 2012's eponymous album and 2014's IX to wide acclaim, but many have been eagerly awaiting the return of Pepper Keenan.\n\nThe band were originally an influential hardcore punk/heavy metal crossover act before reaching critical success with a new lineup on 1991's Blind album. That trajectory continued with wider appeal as Keenan took over as primary vocalist on Deliverance (1994) and Wiseblood (1996). These two recordings in particular fused the raw energy of the previous albums with some great strides forward in classic rock inspired songwriting and more spacious production and execution, which were often copied but rarely equalled.\n\nThis juggernaut gained mass and momentum with relentless touring alongside Metallica, Clutch, Eyehategod and many more. Eventually following In The Arms Of God, 2005, Keenan focused all energy on his hometown band, Down. Until now, that is.\n\nRecent internet chatter on the subject of a reunion turns out be true.\n\nAsked about future plans, bassist Mike Dean said, \"This is all about going out and celebrating some of the classic material, and at the same time it's about tuning up the chemistry and the energy to possibly create a new album or two with this lineup.\"\n\nGo to this location for the band's complete tour schedule."
