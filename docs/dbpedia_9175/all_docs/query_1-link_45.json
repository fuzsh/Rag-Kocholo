        "text": "Scion Audio/Visual, (a.k.a. Scion A/V),the in-house record label and lifestyle marketing division of the Scion marque produced by Toyota Motor Corporation for the North American market, will release \"Megalodon\", the new EP from Raleigh, North Carolina legends CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, on November 13. Entitled \"Megalodon\", the effort will feature \"five heavy tracks.\"\n\nA song from the EP entitled \"Priest Brains\" can be streamed below (courtesy of Metal Injection).\n\nIn a recent interview with Revolver magazine, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY guitarist Woody Weatherman stated about the band's forthcoming EP, \"It's totally done, mixed and mastered, and we just got finished with it this past week. And I think it's coming out in about three or four weeks. It's a pretty quick turnaround, which is unusual in this day and age, but they can do it, they can make it happen â€¦ We did that in our hometown of Raleigh, North Carolina, which is kind of nice, to be able to hang around in town and not have to go out somewhere, go to L.A. or New York. Sometimes it's nice to record at home. You get a little better vibe. Plus I got to use all of my own gear. So it was fun.\"\n\nThe \"Megalodon\" cover artwork can be seen below.\n\nCandlelight Records has just re-released CORROSION OF CONFORMITY's \"Eye For An Eye\". This special reissue has been remastered/packaged and includes the EP \"Six Songs With Mike Singing\". Both titles have been out of print for years. It follows the successful release of the band's self-titled album earlier this year. A deluxe digibook edition of the album, limited to 1000 for North America, is available at limited retailers and via Candlelight's official webstore. The digibook version includes extended liner notes and a rare pictorial gallery.\n\nOriginally released in 1984, \"Eye For An Eye\" featured the original lineup of Weatherman, bassist Mike Dean, drummer Reed Mullin and vocalist Eric Eycke. Reissued to incorporate the 1989 EP by Mike Dean (who left the band between 1987-1992),\"Eye For An Eye\" is raw in sound but focused on message. The years that followed would see the band rise to worldwide popularity with breakthrough and Billboard-charting releases \"Blind\" and \"Deliverance\"."
