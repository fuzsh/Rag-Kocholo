        "text": "CORROSION OF CONFORMITY will join Danzig on a short run of live dates next month. The week-long trek will commence off on September 7th in Hampton Beach, New Hampshire and includes stops in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Montclair, New Jersey; Huntington, New York; Lewiston, Kentucky; Cleveland, Ohio and Detroit, Michigan.\n\nAs a precursor to their run with Danzig, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY will play Psycho Las Vegas this weekend at the Hard Rock Hotel And Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada alongside the likes of Mastodon, Swans, The Murder City Devils, Cult Of Luna with Julie Christmas, and so many more. The following week the band will make their way to the Wolf Den at Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, Connecticut. See all confirmed dates below.\n\nCORROSION OF CONFORMITY:\n\n8/20/2017 Psycho Las Vegas @ Hard Rock Hotel And Casino – Las Vegas, NV [tickets]\n\n8/26/2017 Mohegan Sun Wolf Den – Uncasville, CT [tickets]\n\nw/ Danzig:\n\n9/07/2017 Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom – Hampton Beach, NH\n\n9/08/2017 Electric Factory – Philadelphia, PA\n\n9/09 /2017The Wellmont Theater – Montclair, NJ\n\n9/11/2017 The Paramount – Huntington, NY\n\n9/12/2017 Artpark Amphitheater – Lewiston, NY\n\n9/14/2017 Agora Theatre – Cleveland, OH\n\n9/15/2017 The Fillmore Detroit – Detroit, MI\n\nCORROSION OF CONFORMITY has been diligently working on their follow-up to 2014’s IX offering. Helmed by longtime producer John Custer, who’s recorded such prior COC classics as Deliverance, Wiseblood, America’s Volume Dealer, and In The Arms Of God, the record will mark the band’s studio reunion with vocalist/guitarist Pepper Keenan and their first full-length record together since 2005.\n\nCORROSION OF CONFORMITY emerged from hibernation as a trio and released 2012’s self-titled album and 2014’s IX to wide acclaim, but many fans have been eagerly and patiently awaiting the return of Pepper Keenan.\n\nThe band was originally an influential hardcore punk/heavy metal crossover act before reaching critical success with a then new lineup on 1991’s Blind album. That trajectory continued with wider appeal as Keenan took over as the group’s primary vocalist on Deliverance (1994) and Wiseblood (1996). These two recordings in particular fused the raw energy of their previous albums, with some great strides forward in classic rock inspired songwriting and more spacious production and execution. Since then the band has often been copied but rarely equaled. This juggernaut gained mass and momentum with relentless touring alongside such greats Metallica, Clutch, Eyehategod, and many more. Eventually, following the release of In the Arms Of God in 2005, Keenan decided to focus all his energy on his hometown band Down…until now.\n\nCORROSION OF CONFORMITY is:\n\nPepper Keenan – vocals, guitar\n\nWoodroe Weatherman – guitar\n\nMike Dean – bass, vocals\n\nReed Mullin – drums, vocals"
