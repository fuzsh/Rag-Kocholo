Watch the clip here: https://youtu.be/UqzRWMQJwfk The video, which is set in EARTHLESS‘ hometown of San Diego, as well as neighboring Oceanside, was directed by skateboard/visual artist BB Bastidas and features the famed SoCal skateboarder Taylor Smith, aka T-Spliff. \"Stoked to present to you the very first EARTHLESS video, directed by artist BB Bastidas,\" said drummer Mario Rubalcaba. \"We were stoked to work with BB on this as he knows our background as a band and our close roots with skateboarding. His art is amazing and he also has a keen natural eye for film. Having Taylor Smith, aka T-Spliff, in it just makes it even sweeter. He is somewhat of a mythical figure of a skater, an amazing talent but chooses to shred at his own discretion. Those who know, know. This was a blast to be a part of and we hope you enjoy this short high energy rocker that cruises around our hometown of San Diego and local club, The Casbah.\" »Black Heaven« is the band‘s first release to feature a majority of songs with vocals and is also the trio's first time working with producer Dave Catching (EAGLES OF DEATH METAL). Rubalcaba explains the impact the Joshua Tree studio had on the outfit‘s new music: “This album represents yet another branch on the ever growing and now adolescent EARTHLESS tree. I spent a good amount of time just gazing into the stars at night while we were out recording in the desert of Joshua Tree. I think this somehow lent itself into the title and feel of the album on some songs. This LP has a touch more of our classic rock roots showing, just stuff we grew up on and it‘s great to finally utilize Isaiah‘s lyrical talent and soulful voice. As cliché as it sounds - »Black Heaven« should be played LOUD!” The album is out today and also includes the tracks 'Gifted By The Wind' https://youtu.be/PAMCQt_2R1I and 'Black Heaven' https://youtu.be/0QvV3J5buvk Get the format of your choice via this link: http://nblast.de/EarthlessBlackHeaven"
