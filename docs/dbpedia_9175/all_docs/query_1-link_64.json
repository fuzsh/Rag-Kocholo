        "text": "Reed Mullin, drummer for Corrosion Of Conformity has died. He was 53 years old.\n\nHis bandmates confirmed his passing in a social media post late last night, UK Time, which said:\n\n“Reed, It’s with heavy hearts that we say goodbye to a friend, a brother and pioneer. Love and condolences to the family, friends and fans who will miss you and thanks for the music”\n\nThe Corrosion Of Conformity co-founder, alongside bassist Mike Dean and guitarist Woody Weatherman, missed a number of shows in the past four years due to various of health issues, including an alcohol-related seizure in June 2016.\n\nDean said last summer that Mullin needed “to take care of himself and get his shit together” before rejoining the band. “And if that happens, the door’s open for him. And if it doesn’t, well, that’s how it is. People need to wanna help themselves. You can’t just push them to get help — they’ve gotta wanna help themselves.”\n\nDean also said in a statement when Mullin suffered his alcohol-related seizure that the episode had been “preceded by prolonged, extreme and unhealthy levels of alcohol consumption, not taking care of himself and who knows what else.”\n\nDean revealed that the “tragic event” echoed “a nearly identical” incident in Pittsburgh a few years earlier, where “Reed had a seizure just before taking the stage when the three-piece version of the band were also opening for Clutch. Both instances were preceded by concerns about Reed’s well being and appearance. That incident resulted in five cancelled shows. So years of assurances go by and we come full circle back to the same avoidable tragedy.”\n\nMike went on to say that he and his bandmates would “not enable Reed to continue killing himself on our watch.”\n\nCorrosion Of Conformity’s latest album, 2018’s “No Cross No Crown”, marked the band’s first studio output with vocalist/guitarist Pepper Keenan in over a decade."
