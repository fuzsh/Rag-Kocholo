We take our time doing these things. The Covid thing put everything in a kibosh and we lost a lot of time and energy. The way COC does it, if it ain’t right it’s wrong. We put our energy into it and try to create something that is up to our standards and try to push things as hard as we can in our world.”\n\nRead more at Guitar World.\n\nCelebrating their 40th anniversary, Corrosion Of Conformity will embark on a US tour on November 10 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
