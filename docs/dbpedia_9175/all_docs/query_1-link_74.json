        "text": "News on Jamiroquai, GBV, Sammy Hagar, COC\n\nJay Kay, the lead singer of U.K. funk/rock outfit Jamiroquai, has been charged with common assault and criminal damage stemming from a fracas with a photographer in April, police said today (Oct. 4). Kay, 31, is due to appear Monday (Oct. 8) at Bow Street Magistrates Court in London. The incident occurred April 14 outside the Attica nightclub in London.\n\nJamiroquai’s latest album, “A Funk Odyssey,” is currently in the top-10 in seven European countries, while first single “Little L” is No. 2 on Billboard’s Hot Dance Music: Club Play chart.\n\nIndie rock ironman/Guided By Voices mastermind Robert Pollard will on Oct. 31 issue his fourth full-length release of the year. The Rockathon Records album “Ringworm Interiors” is credited to the Circus Devils, which comprises GBV bassist Tim Tobias, his multi-instrumentalist brother Todd, and Pollard on vocals.\n\nThe album, which joins Guided By Voices’ “Isolation Drills” (TVT), Airport 5’s “Tower in the Fountain of Sparks” (Rockathon), and the Soft Rock Renegades’ “Choreographed Man of War” (Rockathon) as the fourth Pollard-led release of 2001, features 28 tracks with titles such as “Devil Speak,” “Kingdom of Teeth,” “Lizard Foods,” and “Apparent the Red Angus.” The album clocks in at 45 minutes and can be ordered from Guided By Voices’ official Web site.\n\nIn other GBV news, Music Video Distributors is planning a Nov. 20 release for a Guided By Voices DVD titled “The Who Went Home and Cried.” The 60-minute disc features concert footage filmed at Los Angeles Whiskey A Go Go club as well as a band jam/practice session on Pollard’s back porch in his hometown of Dayton, Ohio.\n\n— Troy Carpenter, N.Y.\n\nDue to the damage caused to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, by Hurricane Juliette, Sammy Hagar has postponed his annual Cabo Wabo Mexican Meltdown birthday party and concert, originally scheduled for Oct. 12-13, until next spring. “The situation is tough down there,” Hagar said in a statement. “There are a lot of people affected, the ocean is full of refrigerators, mattresses, personal stuff; and there’s no water or electricity.”\n\nThe Meltdown event was due to be held at Hagar’s Cabo Wabo Cantina nightclub and feature performances by Nickelback, Godsmack, and Jerry Cantrell, along with Hagar and his band, the Waboritas. All have been invited to peform at the rescheduled event, a date for which will be announced soon.\n\nIn the meantime, Hagar says he’s planning to help residents recover from the storm by performing nightly at the club to raise money for relief efforts. “We’re going to play at the club each night, and take donations at the door,” he said, adding, “and then each day at noon we’ll bring in water and food on trucks and give it out to the local families.”\n\n— Barry A. Jeckell, N.Y.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nHard rock act Corrosion of Conformity will host a special screening of its new DVD release, “Live Volume,” Oct. 18 in its hometown of Raleigh, N.C., to benefit the Afghan Women’s Mission (AWM). “Live Volume: The Movie” will held at the city’s Rialto Theater (1620 Glenwood Ave.) beginning at 8 p.m. All box office and merchandise proceeds will benefit AWM, the charitable arm of the Pasadena, Calif.-based Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan.\n\n“On Sept. 11, Americans experienced unspeakable terror,” COC guitarist Pepper Keenan said in a statement. “But it’s come to my attention since then that the women of Afghanistan have been living under terror day in and day out, for years. Mothers are responsible for teaching children. If the mothers of Afghanistan aren’t allowed to learn themselves, how can they teach?”\n\nAdded bassist Mike Dean, “Due to the overwhelming response that the relief efforts have received since the attacks, there are some causes that have slipped off the public’s radar screen. This is an important one.”\n\nRecorded in April in Detroit, the “Live Volume” DVD is due out Tuesday (Oct. 9) via Sanctuary; an audio CD companion was released in August. The concert recording is the follow up to the veteran band’s first album for Sanctuary, “America’s Volume Dealer,” which peaked at No. 18 on Billboard’s Heatseekers chart a year ago.\n\n— Barry A.
