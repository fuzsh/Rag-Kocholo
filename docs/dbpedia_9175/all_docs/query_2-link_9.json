Following the reissue of their Enemy Of The Sun album - re-released alongside their Live At Roadburn 2007 album this past August - the band will re-unleash another one of their seminal, early releases... the almighty, incredibly freaky 1993 Souls At Zero LP, again through their own Neurot Recordings. The reissue will land sometime in the first quarter of 2011, with a final release date and more info to be announced shortly."
