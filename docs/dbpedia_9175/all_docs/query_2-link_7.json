        "text": "Whenever CORROSION OF CONFORMITY releases a new album, folks take notice. But their latest is a true event. It’s been a dozen years since CORROSION OF CONFORMITY recorded new material with vocalist/guitarist Pepper Keenan at the helm. In that time, there have been rumors, whispers, and outright allegations that the legendary Southern rock outfit would reunite to blow the doors off the whole damn scene again. In 2014, after nearly a straight decade traversing the globe as a guitarist with New Orleans supergroup DOWN, Keenan reconnected with the core CORROSION OF CONFORMITY trio of Woody Weatherman, Mike Dean, and Reed Mullin to hit the road hard. “Reed called me and mentioned maybe playing a couple shows,” Keenan recalls. “I said, ‘Let’s just go to Europe and see if it works.’ So we went to Europe and then ended up going back four times in one year… We toured for a year and then started tracking about ten or eleven months ago.”\n\nAnd now, the long wait is over. CORROSION OF CONFORMITY returns with “No Cross No Crown”, set to be released on January 12th via Nuclear Blast Entertainment! “No Cross No Crown” is an album that somehow sounds as though no time has passed between 2005’s “In The Arms Of God” and today. As well as launching pre-orders today, the band are also premiering the first track from the forthcoming release. Listen to ‘Cast The First Stone’, here:\n\nRecording in North Carolina with longtime producer John Custer, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY cut »No Cross No Crown« in about forty days over the course of a year. “We took our time and didn’t put any pressure on ourselves,” Keenan says. “I’d go up from New Orleans and we’d do four or five days at a time, just hacking away at it. It was fun because we did it like a demo, but in a studio. We were writing and putting it on tape at the same time. We took what parts we thought were great from the old days and weren’t scared to go backwards. It kinda wrote itself that way.”\n\nSome of these new jams sound like could’ve easily been on »Wiseblood« or »Deliverance«, two of CORROSION OF CONFORMITY‘s most revered records. On »No Cross No Crown«, beefy Southern stompers like ‘The Luddite,’ ‘Little Man,’ and ‘Forgive Me’ are interspersed with melancholy guitar interludes like ‘No Cross,’ ‘Matre’s Diem,’ and ‘Sacred Isolation’ – just like SABBATH used to do in the ’70s. “We started doing that on »Deliverance«,” Keenan points out. “My theory on that is that if you’re trying to make a record flow, you need to break it up a little. When you need a breather, write an interlude. I like writing those mellow pieces just to space things out and make the next thing come in heavier.”\n\nThe album’s iconic title comes from a recent tour stop in England. “We were playing this old church from like the 1500s that had been turned into a performing arts center,” Keenan recalls. “The dressing room had stained glass windows and one of them showed this poor fella being persecuted. Underneath it said, ‘No cross no crown.’ So I just took that idea. We’re not trying to be on a soapbox, but we used it as a catalyst to write songs around.”\n\nWhich is to say that »No Cross No Crown« has a lot less to do with politics or religion than its title implies. “I think everyone needs to get away from that mindset in general,” Keenan offers. “It just seems to be a mess out there nowadays. We need to get back to being humans and taking care of each other and simple things like that. For us, the terminology ‘No cross no crown’ is a theme. It’s mentioned in like three songs throughout the album. We just weaved it through as we went.”\n\n»No Cross No Crown« stands as irrefutable proof of CORROSION OF CONFORMITY‘s ability to overcome. “CORROSION OF CONFORMITY and the prior records I’ve done with them didn’t just go away,” Keenan observes. “It’s an honor to be back out there and have an opportunity to do it again in a real way and not some washed-up reunion thing. Even before we wrote the record, we were out there for a year seeing there was a demand for it and that there was a void that we could fill. That’s been CORROSION OF CONFORMITY’s deal from day one. We’re not chasing anybody around. We’re not gonna worry about what the new trends are. CORROSION OF CONFORMITY is CORROSION OF CONFORMITY.”\n\n»No Cross No Crown« will be released via Nuclear Blast Entertainment worldwide on January 12th, 2018 on CD, digital, and vinyl formats.

Custer has recorded such prior C.O.C. classics as “Deliverance”, “Wiseblood”, “America’s Volume Dealer” and “In The Arms Of God”. The as-of-yet-untitled-album will mark the band’s studio reunion with vocalist/guitarist Pepper Keenan and their first full-length record since 2005.\n\nSays Keenan about the new partnership:\n\n“To all the C.O.C. fans worldwide, Mike, Reed, Woody and I are proud to announce that we are starting our next sonic adventure with Nuclear Blast Entertainment! We are honored and psyched to be a part of the Blasted Family, both professionally and artistically. After all these years, it‘s truly inspiring to reawaken the chemistry that the four of us have. We are seriously fucking with our pants off now! We do not take this journey lightly and cannot wait to return to the studio to drop Ze’ Hammer! All of this would not be possible without the global support of all you free thinkers and beer drinkers. Much love and respect and look forward to to seeing you soon.ʺ\n\nPresident of Nuclear Blast Entertainment, Monte Conner adds:\n\n“I love all the incarnations of C.O.C. over the years but the Pepper-fronted version has always been the definitive line-up of the band for me. Ever since hearing Pepper take charge on 1991’s ‘Vote With A Bullet’ I was dying to hear him sing more with the band. This line-up’s 1994 debut Deliverance, with its signature tracks ‘Clean My Wounds” and ‘Albatross,’ was an instant classic and is still one of my all-time favorite albums.ʺ\n\nʺIt has been a long 10 years since their fourth album – the highly underrated »In The Arms Of God« – and as a fan, I am dying to hear what these guys come up with next. I know it will be a monster. The fact that it is coming out on Nuclear Blast is very fulfilling for me and many others on the Nuclear Blast team as we finally get to work with one of our favorite bands.ʺ\n\nA fall 2016 release is expected. In the meantime, catch CORROSION OF CONFORMITY on tour this fall on the following dates:\n\nC.O.C. emerged from hibernation as a trio and released 2012’s self-titled album and 2014’s IX to wide acclaim, but many hardcore fans have been eagerly and patiently awaiting the return of Pepper Keenan.\n\nThe band was originally an influential hardcore punk/heavy metal crossover act before reaching critical success with a then new lineup on 1991’s “Blind” album. That trajectory continued with wider appeal as Keenan took over as the group’s primary vocalist on “Deliverance” (1994) and “Wiseblood” (1996).\n\nThese two recordings in particular fused the raw energy of their previous albums, with some great strides forward in classic rock inspired songwriting and more spacious production and execution. Since then the band has often been copied but rarely equaled.\n\nThis juggernaut gained mass and momentum with relentless touring alongside such greats METALLICA, CLUTCH, EYEHATEGOD and many more.\n\nEventually, following the release of “In the Arms of God” in 2005, Keenan decided to focus all his energy on his hometown band DOWN… until now.\n\nGWAR has announced, via their Official Facebook Page, the “GWAR Eternal Tour 2014”:\n\nOderus is missing. Once the Scumdogs in GWAR finally notice this (it takes them a while to notice stuff) they will set off on a journey to find their departed brother using every resource available – including recruiting an ancient Scumdog warrior.\n\nGWAR will need the help from everyone, even the lowliest Bohab, as their enemies are plotting to take advantage of the hole in GWAR’s ranks.\n\nBalSac The Jaws of Death on The “GWAR Eternal Tour 2014” and what to expect:\n\n“Dark clouds of war and ill omen have gathered around GWAR. In our hour of greatest peril, Oderus has left us and our enemies stand poised, ready to strike while they sense weakness. But we shall no longer cower in our Antarctic stronghold, awaiting Destiny’s final blow. This Fall GWAR sets out on the most trying quest of our career. We shall scour our leader’s favorite stomping ground, North America, leaving no city unsearched, no venue unraised, and no sheep unmolested. GWAR will venture to the depths of Hell or to the very end of Time itself, and though I fear what we may encounter out there, I know that we can never return home until we have the answer we seek: ‘Where is Oderus Urungus?’”\n\nGWAR fans have been mourning the loss of Dave Brockie, GWAR’s founder and lead singer, since March. The “GWAR Eternal Tour 2014” gives them an opportunity to gather and share a bunch of feels as a community while experiencing the sickest band in this or any other world.\n\nJamison Land, Beefcake the Mighty’s personal slave and bass tech:\n\n“Dave was our friend and anchor for as far back as anyone can remember. He’s held us together, and sometimes he drove us apart. He is our brother and we love him. Unlike a lot of prominent musicians, he was friends with all of the fans. He made GWAR fans feel special on a personal level. The fans love Dave as much as we do and ‘The GWAR Eternal Tour 2014’ is our way of getting together and sharing that love.”\n\nThe first leg of the tour will include direct support from Decapitated; the second leg will have direct support from Corrosion of Conformity. American Sharks will open all shows. The tour kicks off October 15th in Norfolk, VA and runs through December 13th in Baltimore, MD. A complete list of dates can be found below.
