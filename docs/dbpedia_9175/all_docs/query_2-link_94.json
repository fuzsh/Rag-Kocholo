Active since 1989 with vocalist/guitarist Dave Wyndorf as the sole original member, Monster Magnet are best known for a dirge-like stoner rock sound inspired by Alice Cooper, The MC5, Hawkwind, Black Sabbath, Jack Kirby and Amon Duul II to name a few. The band gained mainstream attention and fame with their 1998 album Powertrip and the hit single \"Space Lord\" (Notably the first ever song aired on MTV's famous countdown program \"Total Request Live\"), also shifting the band's sound to something more resembling commercial rock with hints of space rock and psychedelic. The band also drew influence from comics, with one of their hits \"Negasonic Teenage Warhead\" leading to an X-Men character of the same name in 2001.\n\nMonster Magnet to date have ten studio albums along with a host of other releases. Wyndorf went through a series of different names in naming the group such as \"Dog of Mystery\", \"Airport 75\", \"Triple Bad Acid\", \"Love Monster\" and \"King Fuzz\" before finally settling on \"Monster Magnet\", taken from the name of a 1960s toy made by Wham-O, which Wyndorf liked when he was a child. To date the band has released ten studio albums amid a host of other releases and has toured all over the world with a wide range of musical acts.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly Years and Spine of God (1989 - 1992)[]\n\nThe years prior to the formation of Monster Magnet involved several New Jersey bands. Prior to forming Monster Magnet Dave Wyndorf and Phil Caivano had played in a military-themed punk rock/new wave band known as Shrapnel between 1978 and 1985. Tom Diello, Tim Cronin and John McBain all played in an art rock band known as Pinque Phloyd and later Dog of Mystery, whom Wyndorf would eventually join. Other side bands and \"supergroups\" would form with members of this New Jersey scene such as Triple Bad Acid (Cronin, McBain, Greg Chapman), Acid Reich (Cronin, McBain, Wyndorf, Shaun Kelly, Tim HellSausage), Chigger (Wyndorf, Cronin, McBain, Kleiman), Love Monster (Wyndorf solo), Happy Talk and Airport 75 (Wyndorf, Croni, McBain). However these members were most productive with Dog of Mystery, who performed at least twice a month in the New Jersey area. Many of these demos these bands would record would be released either via Cool Beans Tapes or Ugly American Tapes.[1][2]\n\nFollowing a performance opening for Jane's Addiction the band recorded demos of new songs. Initially credited to Dog of Mystery before the band changed their name to Monster Magnet with the founding lineup of Dave Wyndorf, John McBain and Tim Cronin. The band's first demo known as Forget About Life, I'm High On Dope in the Spring of 1989. Along with demos of TAB the band recorded a second demo known as We're Stoned, What Are You Going To Do About It? in October 1989.[3] Monster Magnet also performed live for the first time at The Brighton Bar in Long Branch, New Jersey on 11 October 1989.[4] Around 1990 the band would sign with German label Glitterhouse Records while also releasing two 7\" singles via other labels: Murder and Lizard Johnny. Recording in the Summer of 1990 the eponymous Monster Magnet would see release that November. Since the German crowd was fond of this band, Glitterhouse gave the band $3,000 to record their debut album. Prior to recording this debut the band would record an EP at Subterranean Studios with Stacey Phelon. The band would also record this album at the same studio. Between the recording of Tab and Spine of God Tim Cronin would leave the drum role and switch to lights and visuals. Jon Kleiman (Drums) and Joe Calandra (Bass) would join the band in 1991.\n\nSpine of God would see release on 6 December 1991. Though not a huge commercial success the album did make Spin's \"Top 10 Albums You Didn't Hear\" list of 1991.[5] Spine of God has since been regarded as a seminal album in the early stages of stoner rock and stoner metal. A month prior to Spine of God's release in Europe and two years after it's release in the States Tab would see release, an EP featuring a 32-minute title track and more of a raw psychedelic and acid rock sound. Spine of God saw release through Caroline in the United States on 28 February 1992 with Tab releasing in the States the next year. Monster Magnet would tour Europe that Spring, sharing the stage with the likes of Helmet, Prong and Sister Double Happiness. The band had performed both standard and all-instrumental sets through the tour. Finally the band would tour with Soundgarden and Swervedriver, culminating in two dates where Soundgarden joined the band for Tab. However John McBain had been frustrated with the band and music in general (Namely stemming from when Cronin departed) and quit the band following a show in Boston at the Avalon on 12 May 1992.[6][7] The band would find a new guitarist in Ed Mundell[8] and tour Europe through that August and September. Following the tour the band would sign with major label A&M Records on observation of the band's successful tours through the year.[9]\n\nA&M Part 1: Superjudge and Dopes (1993 - 1997)[]\n\nRecording in October 1992, Monster Magnet would make their major label debut with Superjudge, released on 6 April 1993.[10] Despite attaining positive critical reception at the time from the likes of Entertainment Weekly (B+)[11] and Riff Raff (B)[12] along with two promotional music videos the album was not a commercial success. Nonetheless Monster Magnet would tour heavily in support of Superjudge, beginning the year in North America supporting the likes of White Zombie and Danzig. This would follow with a tour of Europe beginning with a John Peel BBC Session,[13] touring from late April to June, including appearances at Dynamo Open Air, Berlin Rocks and Hamburg Rocks.[14] Two more lengthy tours of the United States would follow before the band would close out the year as part of the Superbang touring festival, performing with the likes of Type O Negative, La Costa Rosa, The Sisters of Mercy and The Ramones.[15]\n\nTaking time off from touring through 1994 Monster Magnet would begin work on a follow-up album. Notably an early version of the song \"Negasonic Teenage Warhead\" would appear in the 1994 comedy S.F.W..[16] Determined to make the next record everything Supejudge wasn't, Dave Wyndorf and Monster Magnet worked toward a more consistent, ethereal sound rather than the mid-range of the previous album.[17]\n\nDopes To Infinity would be released on 21 March 1995[18] to critical praise at the time, notably awarded an \"A-\" score by Entertainment Weekly that same month.[19] \"Dopes To Infinity charted fairly well despite only selling slightly better than Superjudge, peaking at #22 on the US Heatseekers,[20] #17 on the Swedish Albums Chart, #30 on the German Album Charts, #51 on the UK Album Charts and #77 on the Dutch Album Charts.[21] \"Negasonic Teenage Warhead\" peaked at 19 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks and 26 on the \"Modern Rock Tracks\", attaining regular airplay on MTV and later spawning an X-Men character of the same name in 2001.\n\nMonster Magnet would tour extensively in support of Dopes To Infinity, beginning the year in Europe and following with a Spring tour in North America alongside the likes of Fu Manchu and Corrosion of Conformity. The band would return to Europe in the fall to further support Dopes To Infinity alongside the likes of Sweet Water, Anthrax and Deftones. Finally in early 1996 Monster Magnet would embark on their first ever tour of Australia.[22] Monster Magnet would only perform sporadic shows throughout 1997 as work began on the next album.[23]\n\nA&M Part 2: Powertrip and God Says No (1998 - 2002)[]\n\nA&M would pressure Wyndorf to write another Monster Magnet record in 1997, leaving Wyndorf frustrated and opting to spend twenty-one days in Las Vegas, writing a song a day about the Las Vegas lifestyle and taking time to find a producer in Matt Hyde.[24][25] Phil Caivano, whom previously played with Wyndorf in Shrapnel, joined the band in 1998.\n\nPowertrip would see release on 16 June 1998 to critical acclaim and peaking at #1 on The Heatseekers.[26] The songs \"Powertrip\", \"Temple of Your Dreams\", and \"See You In Hell\" received airplay on rock radio stations and MTV along with the album charting at No. 97 on the Billboard 200. Most notably would be the hit single \"Space Lord\" peaking at #3 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks and becoming the first video to ever be aired on the popular MTV Program \"All Request Live\". \"Powertrip\" would be certified Gold by the RIAA on 25 January 1999.\n\nMonster Magnet would tour extensively throughout 1998 and 1999 in support of Powertrip, sharing the stage through 1998 with the likes of Megadeth, Sevendust, Rob Zombie, Fear Factory, Metallica, Van Halen and Aerosmith among others. The next year Monster Magnet would appear as one of the opening acts for the Beautiful Monsters Tour, co-headlined by Hole and Marilyn Manson.[27] Following the well-publicized falling out between the outspoken vocalists of both Hole and Marilyn Manson, Monster Magnet continued touring with Manson and opened the first three shows of his Rock is Dead Tour.[28] Monster Magnet would follow up with touring Europe with Metallica, North America with Iron Maiden and headlining shows in Japan and Australia.[29]\n\nMonster Magnet would take time off from touring to work up a follow-up to Powertrip, working again with producer Matt Hyde but this time recording in Vancouver through early 2000.[30] Monster Magnet's fifth studio album God Says No would be first released in Europe on 30 October 2000 but the album would be delayed in the states to avoid competing with major bands releasing albums around the same time.[31] The US edition would see release on 10 April 2001 and while it peaked at #153 on the Billboard 200 and had two songs charting on Mainstream Rock Tracks in \"Heads Explode\" and \"Melt\", ultimately it would not be as commercially successful as Powertrip.\n\nMonster Magnet would tour Europe in 2000 to support God Says No, followed by extensive touring through the United States and Canada in 2001, touring with the likes of Buckcherry and The Cult. Monster Magnet would tour North America again the next year in a tour titled We're Free.[32] Monster Magnet's music would also appear in several films over the years such as Boys (1996), Bride of Chucky (1998), Soldier (1998), Urban Legend (1998) The Matrix (1999), Beowulf (1999), The Crow: Salvation (2000), Heavy Metal 2000, Dracula 2000, The Girl Next Door (2004) and Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006) among others. Monster Magnet was also commissioned to write and perform a song called \"Live For The Moment\" for the World Wrestling Federation (Now known as World Wrestling Entertainment aka WWE.). This song would be the entrance theme for Matt Hardy from 2002 to 2010 and appear on the WWF Forceable Entry compilation.[33]\n\nSteamhammer: Monolithic Baby! and 4-Way Diablo (2003 - 2008)[]\n\nThrough early 2003 Monster Magnet would take time off as Wyndorf would compose music for the movie \"Torque\", produced by Ice Cube.[34] On 16 April 2003 it would be announced that bassist Joe Calandra and drummer Jon Kleiman were both fired from the band.[35] Monster Magnet would sign a recording deal in Europe with SPV/Steamhammer in May that year. Wyndorf would make the following statement about the label move:\n\n“ “Since the very beginning, Europe has been the spiritual home of Monster Magnet. We are very happy to be releasing our new material through Steamahmmer/SPV, as it is based in the heart of Europe. It gives us a chance to bring the rock to the European people who we've always, ALWAYS, considered to be some of the best audiences in the world.” ”\n\n— Dave Wyndorf, Official Statement via Blabbermouth [36]\n\nMonster Magnet would hire a new rhythm section that May, with Jim Baglino joining on bass and Michael Wildwood joining on drums. [37] Initial work on the band's sixth album began in August, initially working with Joe Barresi and going with the title Radiation Day,[38] with a string of festival appearances to bridge the gap between recording sessions.[39] The recording sessions would resume in September but with changes in producer and album title, now going with working with co-producer Scott Humphrey at The Chop Shop in Los Angeles.[40] Interscope (Formerly A&M Records) would also produce a two-disc Greatest Hits compilation on 15 September 2003. the sixth album would be completed by November 2003[41] through Michael Wildwood would leave the band after the recording sessions.[42] Monster Magnet would hire Bob Pantella (Raging Slab, A Thousand Knives of Fire) later that month and perform a \"surprise\" show at The Barfly in London on 5 December, serving as Pantella's debut with the band.[43] A follow-up show was booked for the Astoria Theatre two days later.\n\nMonolithic Baby! would see release on 16 February 2004[44] (and a US release date of 25 May 2004 via Sanctuary Records)[45][46] Music videos were produced for \"Unbroken (Hotel Baby)\", the Robert Calvert cover \"The Right Stuff\" and \"Monolithic\", the former the most added song on commercial radio the week of release.[47] Though not charting in the States, Monolithic Baby! charted well in Europe, notably peaking at #7 on the Sweden charts and #13 on the German charts[48] while attaining generally positive reception.\n\nIn support of Monolithic Baby!, Monster Magnet would tour Europe that Spring with Gluecifer and The Quill, along with a Summer tour that saw them appearing at Download Festival, Sweden Rock Festival, Wald Rock and a headlining appearance at Roadburn Festival.[49] Following recording for an appearance on Monster Garage[50] the band would do two tours of North America in support of Monolithic Baby!, the latter with H.I.M. and Melissa Auf Der Maur. Phil Caivano would leave the band on 19 March 2005.[51] Through 2005 the band would largely perform festivals in Europe while SPV and the band worked on re-issues of Spine of God and Tab (Both of which released in 2006.) along with a proposed live DVD and Wyndorf solo album, though the latter two would not come to fruition.[52] Work would begin on a seventh album that December with Matt Hyde.[53]\n\nA tour with Witchcraft was proposed for Europe in 2006, along with a warm-up show with Lunarmile (Which featured Toni Marie, daughter of Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi.).[54] However on 27 February 2006 Wyndorf would suffer a drug overdose and the tour would be canceled.[55] The band would halt production on the seventh album until Wyndorf had recovered, with work resuming circa April 2007.[56] In an interview with Classic Rock Magazine, Wyndorf would speak in detail about how he got hooked on sleeping pills, the overdose and subsequent recovery:\n\n“ ““I fell into a horrible habit of taking sleeping pills when we were out on the road. I swore it would never happen to me. I haven’t even gotten high for years. I’m not a party guy, I don’t drink, all I do is work. Work, and live my life. But I was touring so goddamn much, and going back and forth to different parts of the world, that I just went to my doctor and I was like, ‘I want something that’s gonna put me down like a wild animal’. I just couldn’t sleep. My voice would go out, and I’d feel tired. And I was just like, ‘I wanna fuckin’ sleep, man’.\n\nSo this doctor says, ‘Okay, welcome to the world of Benzodiazepines’,” he continues. “If they think you know what you’re doing, they will give you enough drugs to kill yourself. Guess what? I knew what I was doing. It was dangerous, but I knew I could handle it, and I did, for a good two years. But eventually they caught up with me. I just went from taking the medication as prescribed to taking it more and more. The next thing you know, I’m stuck. Stuck in this horrible situation. So instead of asking for help, I’m like, ‘No, I can do it myself, it’ll be cool’. But it’s not cool, it’s worse than fuckin’ heroin, this shit. It’s like taking half a bottle of Xanax every pill. It was horrible.\n\n[On his bandmates awareness of the situation]They didn’t even know, really, what was wrong,” he says. “They knew something was wrong, I mean, I lost a lot of weight and looked terrible, but I just tried to get off them again without telling anybody, and I just couldn’t. I mean, it’s just like the movies. I never had trouble kicking anything before, so we book a tour. I start taking the pills more and more. At this point I’m taking enough pills to tranquilise a goddamn volcano, but I’m only sleeping two hours, if that. So I took a bunch, went to sleep for a while, woke up a couple hours later not knowing what was going on except that I wanted more pills, and I took a whole bottle. Like, 100 pills. And then… well, I ended up in the hospital. That was the grand finale. It was really embarrassing. I think that was my biggest problem with it. It was like, you should have your shit more together than this, dude.\n\n[On recording 4-Way Diablo] I was really not into it when I first went back to the studio because I wasn’t happy with my songs, I wasn’t happy with my writing. But a lot of that came from the horrible depression that comes with the Benzo thing. To tell you the truth, the happiest I’ve been in a long time is when I started that record. It was like, ‘Oh yeah, this is what I do!’. I don’t tour, touring isn’t my whole life. I actually make music! So, it was a lot of fuckin’ fun.”\n\n”\n\n— Dave Wyndorf, Classic Rock Magazine via Louder Sound [57]\n\n4-Way Diablo would see release on 2 November 2007 in Germany (And later 5 November 2007 in Europe and 6 November 2007 in the United States) to mostly positive reception, while peaking at #51 on the Swedish charts and #81 on the German charts. Monster Magnet would tour Europe in the Summer of 2008 to support the album alongside a returning Phil Caivano, followed by a Fall European tour with Nebula.\n\nSigning to Napalm Records and Mastermind (2009 - 2012)[]\n\nMonster Magnet would continue with their touring through 2009, mainly through Europe that summer along with the band's first tour of Australia in a decade.[58] Lastly the band closed out 2009 touring the United Kingdom with Karma To Burn. On 24 November 2009 the band would sign with Napalm Records as work would begin on an eighth studio album[59] and a new website was launched.[60] Monster Magnet would tour Europe for two weeks as the band's eighth albm would be officially announced.[61] Monster Magnet would also launch an in-house label called Studio 13 to release short-run collectors vinyl such as Superjudge / She Digs That Hole (2010) and Dopes (2011).[62]\n\nMastermind saw release on 25 October 2010 to generally positive reviews. Notably it'd be the first time Monster Magnet would chart on the Billboard 200 since God Says No, peaking at #165 with 3000 copies sold in the first week. Mastermind also charted fairly well in other countries, namely Sweden (#34), Germany (#38) and Norway (#42).[63] However on 3 November 2010, a week after Mastermind's release, it had been revealed that Ed Mundell chose to leave the band after finishing the recording sessions and August tour, citing \"personal reasons\"[64] and a desire to explore new musical ventures. Mundell would re-locate to Los Angeles and form a new band in 9 Chambers, along with re-booting The Ultra Electric Mega Galactic.[65] Garrett Sweeny (Riotgod) would take over as the new lead guitarist as the band toured that November in support of the album.\n\n“ [On Mundell's departure] \"What can I say? [Ed] told me this two months ago and I gave him some time for him to perhaps reconsider but no go. It's a bummer, yeah but we've been through this kind of thing before. Make no mistake, MAgnet goes on. We start[ed] the 'Mastermind' tour [on Wednesday, November 3] in Cologne, Germany with Phil Caivano and Garrett Sweeny [Riotgod] handling dual guitar chores.\"\n\n[About guitarist Garrett Sweeny] He's a maniac! He learned a fuckload of MONSTER MAGNET songs in less than two months and is shredding the shit out of 'em! See for yourself.\"\n\n”\n\n— Dave Wyndorf, Official Statement via Blabbermouth [66]\n\nFurther touring in support of Mastermind would take place in Australia that March as part of the Soundwave Festival[67] followed by a tour of Europe that June and July which included appearances at Hellfest, Graspop Metal Meeting and Rockwave Festival among others. On 8 July 2011 the band would announce a tour that November where they would perform the entirety of \"Dopes To Infinity\".[68] The next year the band would follow with performing all of \"Spine of God\" on a tour of Europe with My Sleeping Karma as support, closing out the year with a string of hometown shows performing \"Spine of God\" for it's 20th anniversary.[69]\n\nLast Patrol and Mindfucker (2013 - 2020)[]\n\nWork would begin on the next Monster Magnet album in early 2013, recording at Phil Caivano's home studio \"Studio 13\" with vintage equipment as a return to the band's psychedelic roots. Dave Wyndorf would speak about the recording process for the band's ninth album:\n\n“ \"'Last Patrol' is a return to our roots in terms of vibe and recording style. It's full-on psychedelic space-rock with a '60s garage feel, recorded almost exclusively with vintage guitars, amps and effects in our hometown of Red Bank, New Jersey. The songs are a kind of space-noir, tales of cosmic revenge, peaking libidos, alienation and epic strangeness. It's a weird trip through the back alleys of a dark, retro-future, which not by coincidence very much resembles my own life. [laughs] The lyrics aren't fantasy really, rather a recounting of my musings on, observations of and general emotional reaction to my life and environment during a 1 week writing period in February of 2013. But I tend to use the vernacular and imagery of science fiction and surrealism to express myself and that's where these lyrics get trippy. There's also our cover version of Donovan's 'Three Kingfishers', which I thought fit the mood of the album.\n\n'Last Patrol' was produced by Phil Caivano and myself with an effort to bring a homegrown feel to the whole affair. We had been doing smaller projects out of Phil's Studio 13 recording space and I really felt comfortable there so it was the natural choice on where to record the next full-scale MONSTER MAGNET album. Phil and I grew up together and have a shared love of some very particular vintage music and styles. And everybody in the band played their asses off on this one.\"\n\n”\n\n— Dave Wyndorf, Official Statement via Blabbermouth [70]\n\nOn 29 July 2013 details on the band's ninth album would be announced[71] along with the band announcing that Chris Kosnik (The Atomic Bitchwax, Black Nasa, Godspeed) would join as the new bassist.[72] He would replace Jim Baglino who had left the band early in the year after a tenure with the band spanning over a decade. The band would follow with a special performance at Vintage Vinyl a day before the album's release[73] along with a live appearance on The Artie Lange Show.[74] Last Patrol would see release on 15 October 2013 to critical acclaim, peaking at #188 on the Billboard 200 along with charting in several other countries.[75] In support of Last Patrol, Monster Magnet would do a full tour of the United States for the first time in a decade, with Royal Thunder and Zodiac as support. The next year Monster Magnet would tour Europe and Australia performing the entirety of Last Patrol. One more summer tour of Europe would follow surrounding appearances at Sweden Rock Festival, Rock Hard Festival, Copenhell, Download Festival and Hellfest.[76]\n\nOn 14 November 2014 Monster Magnet would release Milking The Stars: A Re-Imagining of Last Patrol, a re-imagining of the 2013 album with new songs, live songs with Kosnik and an overall re-imagining in a \"weird 1960s vibe\" as described by the band.[77][78] The album was released on 14 November 2014 in continental Europe, 17 November 2014 in the UK, and 18 November 2014 in the US and Canada.[79] The band would tour Europe again in early 2015, followed by releasing another remix album in Cobras and Fire: The Mastermind Redux on 9 October 2015. Described by the band as a \"deranged fusion of garage-psych, fuzz punk and movie soundtrack music.\",[80] Cobras and Fire is almost entirely a re-recording of the 2010 album Mastermind. In 2016 Monster Magnet would tour Europe once again, this time doing a live show in celebration of the A&M Years of the band. By the end of 2016 Monster Magnet would begin recording their tenth album[81] with recording nearly finished by February 2017 and a tentative summer 2017 release.[82]\n\nTaking more of a garage rock approach and drawing from The Stooges, Grand Funk Railroad and The MC5,[83] Mindfucker would be released on 23 March 2018[84] and peak at #54 on the Billboard 200[85] along with hitting high marks on other charts (#9 on \"Independent Albums\"[86] and #11 on the \"Tastemakers Chart\"[87] among others.). The album attained critical acclaim from publications such as Blabbermouth,[88] Metalwani,[89] Cryptic Rock[90] and Echoes and Dust[91] among others.\n\nFollowing a string of shows surrounding an appearance at Decibel Metal and Beer Fest[92] Monster Magnet would tour Europe in support of Mindfucker, which would include headlining appearances at Kristonfest, DesertFest Berlin and Desertfest London, the latter would notably have Hawkwind as their direct support. The band would close out the year touring North America alongside Dark Sky Choir and Electric Citizen. The band would tour Europe the next Spring in further support of Mindfucker but be force to cancel a summer tour due to Dave Wyndorf having to undergo tonsil surgery.[93] The band would spend 2020 embarking on a tour in celebration of \"Powertrip\" through Europe[94] but would ultimately due to the CO-VID19 pandemic.[95]\n\nA Better Dystopia (2021 - Present)[]\n\nIn a 2020 interview Wyndorf would state that work had begun on an eleventh record, stating that \"It's a crisis time; the last thing I want to do is ask for money. I don't think fans owe me anything. I owe them something: a good record.\".[96] On 23 March 2021 it would be announced that an eleventh album would be finished and ready for release. A Better Dystopia, set to be released on 21 May 2021, would be a full covers album,[97] with Wyndorf speaking about it in the press blurb:\n\n“ \"We all agreed that we would be bored out of our minds within a month of lockdown. MONSTER MAGNET loves the road. It’s a lifestyle. So, I considered our options. Rather than panhandle on the internet, hawking masks and Zoom-rocking practice sessions for dollars, I suggested we record a “bunker record”. A total DIY affair (band only) recorded and mixed in Bob Pantella’s small but potent Freak Shop Studios/rehearsal space right here in New Jersey. But what to record?\n\nI didn’t feel much like writing, but working on anything was better than watching the news as hospitals filled up, people died, and American politics went bat-shit crazy. The world roared “Dystopia! Apocalypse! Revolution!”. I’d heard those words before, and they brought to mind my childhood in the late 60’s/early 70’s… and the music… and short playlist of songs (just one of many) that I’d been carrying around with me on my whatever device to listen to before shows. Of course, these tunes have also been in my head for more or less my whole life. These were not the popular hits of the time. This was like a playlist from the 4th dimension… strange bits of musical obscurity, mostly dredged up from that inglorious and freaky “twilight zone” time that preceded Arena Rock, Heavy Metal, Reggae and Disco. A no-man’s land of hard rock that still had remnants of psychedelia and garage punk but had abandoned any notion of “flower power” or frat house fun. And of course, they rocked. Yeah, these songs were it.\n\nThe great bands whose music we lovingly interpret here were (and some still are) on the fringe, underrated, and in our opinion, really, really cool. I think that’s reason enough for us to do this album. Furthermore, A Better Dystopia is a collection of songs that I think reflect (knowingly or unknowingly) a paranoid time in history, but also deflect that same paranoia by owning it, fully. And of course, it ROCKS.\"\n\n”\n\n— Dave Wyndorf, Official Statement via The Obelisk [98]\n\nSelected Discography[]\n\nStudio Albums[]\n\nSpine of God (1991, Glitterhouse / Caroline)\n\nSuperjudge (1993, A&M)\n\nDopes To Infinity (1995, A&M)\n\nPowertrip (1998, A&M)\n\nGod Says No (2001, A&M)\n\nMonolithic Baby!
