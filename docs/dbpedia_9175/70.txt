Corrosion of Conformity

(also known as C.O.C.) is an

American heavy metal band from Raleigh, North Carolina formed in 1982.

Histor

Early years

(1982?1987)

Corrosion of Conformity (C.O.C.) was formed in Raleigh, North Carolina

by bassist and vocalist Mike Dean, guitarist Woody Weatherman and drummer Reed

Mullin in early 1980s. Their hardcore punk-oriented 20-track debut Eye for

an Eye?the only album featuring the vocalist Eric Eycke?was released in

1984 (later re-released by Caroline Records during 1990). Soon after, Eycke

left the band and C.O.C. continued as a three-piece with Dean and Mullin

sharing the vocal duties on the 1985's follow-up Animosity. In 1987, COC

recruited Simon Bob Sinister away from their fellow Carolina band and Death

Records labelmates, Ugly Americans. The band's 1987 release, Technocracy

featured the hectic thrash musicianship of COC with a cleaner vocal style than

they had in the past.

Departure of Mike

Dean, hiatus and Blind (1987-1992)

Mike Dean departed in 1987 and Simon Bob soon followed, leaving COC in a

state of flux for a couple of years. The remaining members re-tuned the line up

and searched for a new vocalist, even posting a classified in Flipside Fanzine

for a singer similar in sound to "James Hetfield or Ozzy Osbourne" to

go with their new metal sound. Caroline Records released some old tracks with

Mike singing during this time with the aptly named Six Songs With Mike Singing

EP.

After much searching, Karl Agell was recruited on vocals, Phil Swisher

on bass and Pepper Keenan as a second guitarist. COC gravitated towards a more

straightforward heavy metal sound. By 1991's Blind they had become a

heavy metal band. Blind was the first COC album to receive mainstream

attention. The video for "Vote With A Bullet" received airplay on MTV

and the album cracked the Billboard Heatseekers chart in early 1992. The album

has sold around 250,000 copies in the US to date.

Deliverance

and Wiseblood (1993-1998)

In 1993, Agell and Swisher left the band and formed the band Leadfoot,

Dean returned and Keenan took over lead vocals. The following year COC signed

to Columbia Records, and the release of Deliverance saw the band move

toward Southern metal, a sound that they also carried onto the Wiseblood

and America's Volume Dealer albums. In 1994, their song Big Problems was

featured on the Clerks soundtrack. The song Clean My Wounds was also featured

in the anime movie Tekken: The Motion Picture.

Deliverance

was the band's biggest selling album. This was mainly due to the

singles "Albatross" and "Clean My Wounds" becoming Top 20

hits on rock radio and the album managed to spend almost 4 months on the

Billboard Top 200, peaking at No.155. On the Heatseekers chart, it peaked at

No.5 and lasted almost a year on that particular chart. US sales for the album

were just over 440,000 by the end of 2005 and this album should be eligible for

Gold status within the next few years.

Wiseblood

was released in October 1996. Despite producing a Top 30 radio hit with

"Drowning In A Daydream" and a worldwide tour with Metallica, the

album failed to match the sales set by the previous album. Total US sales to

date are just over 150,000. COC was nominated for a 1998 Grammy Award in the

"Best Metal Performance" category for the song "Drowning in a

Daydream".

America's Volume

Dealer

and In the Arms

of God (1999-2006)

Pepper Keenan live on stage

Soon after the release of Wiseblood, Columbia dropped COC, who

then moved to Sanctuary Records. The band released its first album for its new

label, America's Volume Dealer, in November 2000. The album was even

more of a commercial failure than Wiseblood not even managing to make the

Billboard Top 200. However, the single, "Congratulations Song", did

give the band another Top 30 hit. No videos were made from the album. Mullin

left the band in 2001. Since then the band has worked with a series of

drummers: Jimmy Bower of Eyehategod, local Raleigh percussion professor Merritt

Partridge, Stanton Moore of Galactic and Reed's former drum technician Jason

Patterson, who previously played drums in the Raleigh-based rock band Cry of

Love.

In April 2005, COC released In the Arms of God to much critical

acclaim. The album performed much better than their previous effort, debuting

at No.108 on the Billboard Top 200 and even topping the Heatseekers chart. This

was achieved without even one radio hit from the album. A video was made for

the song "Stonebreaker" which saw airplay on MTV2's recently revived Headbanger's

Ball. The band spent the rest of the year touring the US and Canada. They

were the opening acts for Mot?rhead and Disturbed and also went on headlining

tours with Crowbar, Fu Manchu, Alabama Thunderpussy and Danko Jones all providing

support. A European tour was scheduled for September/October 2005 but was later

cancelled, after Hurricane Katrina ravaged Keenan's adopted hometown of New

Orleans. A co-headlining UK tour with Clutch commenced in January 2006.

Recent history (2007-present)

The band is currently on a hiatus while Pepper records and tours with

Down. Starting in March, 2009 Karl Agell and Reed Mullin have started touring

with Jerry Barrett, Scott Little, and Jason Browning as "COC-Blind",

performing the Blind album. There are talks about COC-Blind creating original

material moving forward. Reed Mullin and Mike Dean along with Jason Browning

are also touring in a new band called "Righteous Fool."
