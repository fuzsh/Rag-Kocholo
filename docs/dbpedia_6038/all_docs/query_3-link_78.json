        "text": "Coming from the album \"Repulbic\" comes a fresh sound from New Order\" in the single \"Regret\", one of their greatest hits from the 1990's showcasing they could shift from their known 1980's style. This is more rock and less electronic and it works perfectly - though I'm a fan of their in all forms. Here, Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook, Gillian Gilbert and Stephen Morris have a pleasant time while in Italy, at times performing with their instruments, and other times just walking around from location to location. Quick shots, fast cuts that seem to present them in snapshots, there's also time to observe the rhythm of the Italian city - I think it's Rome but I might be wrong since there isn't much of the most famous locations or postcard places presented - we also observe the people, the movement from the crowd night and day.\n\nIt's not one of their greatest exercises in music video, if compared to their artistic visual excitment of \"True Faith\" or \"Blue Monday\", or even the classic static masterpiece \"The Perfect Kiss\" (My personal favorite), but it's manageable due to its excellent song. The few memorable shots here comes whenever the chorus appear where the camera moves along each member appear then cuts away to the next one, almost like floating around; or whenever some of them are lonely playing inside hotel rooms. It's quite alright. 8/10."
