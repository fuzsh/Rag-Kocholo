        "text": "I´m listening to OMD's Architecture and Morality as I type and I think it's a brilliant album. Despite being recorded with synths it doesn't feel cold at all and I love Andy's vocals. . I've heard the first 3 OMD albums and I think this is the best by far.\n\nI'm a New Order fan, and I've heard most of what they've recorded. Technique is my favourite album by them. I love the combination of the guitar and the synths.\n\nI need more music like this\n\nNew Order have been one of my favorites since I discovered them in 87. If you're looking for more of the synth type sound I'd suggest Pet Shop Boys, although some of their music can feel a tad cooler to me. Electronic, if you aren't aware of them, is a side project of Bernard Sumner, they have three albums, each a little different in character, their first self titled album being closer to the feel of New Order (followed by Raise The Pressure and Twisted Tenderness). Monaco was the side project of Peter Hook, and their two albums are well worth searching out (Music For Pleasure, then self titled album).\n\nThere's a band called The Mary Onettes that I found to be pretty similar in feeling to New Order, very 80's alternative sounding. Sample some tracks for their album Islands. You might like Sad Lovers And Giants, but they're a bit more guitar based.\n\nI've heard a bit of the Pet Shops Boys' music. I have 2 albums by them, PopArt & Introspective, and I've downloaded their first 2 albums. I've also Heard the last 2 on Spotify. I like the first 2 best. The latest 2 sound soulless/lifeless to me.\n\nAs for Electronic, the only álbum of theirs that I heard is the first one, but I heard a later single that I like very much: Forbbiden City. And I like Dissapointed as well.\n\nThe only song I've heard by Monaco is What Do You Want From Me. It's not bad, but it's not great either.\n\nI'll check out the other bands you mentioned. Thanks\n\nHi, the videos that you posted are blocked here where I live. Where esle can I watch them?\n\nI know those 2 bands by name, but I've never heard their music so far.\n\nAs for The Other Two, I only know their 2 hits, Tasty Fish & Selfish, and I like them, but never bothered in investigating any further. I haven't heard anything by Revenge yet.\n\nAn obvious suggestion would be Section 25's From the Hip.\n\nSection 25 - From The Hip\n\nA lot of people I know that like New Order really like the Pet Shop Boys' Behavior album. It's a bit different than New Order, but worth a shot. I personally love it:\n\nPet Shop Boys - Behaviour\n\nAlthough much more guitar driven than either OMD or NO, the first album by the Lucy Show would probably be of interest:\n\nThe Lucy Show - ...Undone\n\nFor a newer band, try Junior Boys' first one:\n\nJunior Boys - Last Exit\n\nA bit off topic from what we're talking about here but Reproduction and Travelogue are some of the best synth based albums of their time IMHO. They're totally different from what HL became later (watered down and commercial, original band members gone)."
