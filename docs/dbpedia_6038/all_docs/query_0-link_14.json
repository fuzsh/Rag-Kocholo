        "text": "Music genres can be very confusing. They are the weird words music journalists use to group artists into boxes. It’s almost impossible to make any kind of sense of this complicated web of genres that spans from Aboriginal Folk to Zouk and World Fusion to Doo Wop. Even though we have all these different specific terms, quite often it’s difficult to pin down what genre a single artist belongs to. Therefore, the usefulness of these tags can be questioned, but then again, it does give a sense of order into the chaotic world of music. It’s the amount of different, difficult to understand sub-genres that bugs me the most.\n\nI shall start with this one huge genre called New Wave and go on to its sub-genres, mainly because that’s one hell of a field for confusing, overlapping terms that I can’t use correctly (and I highly doubt many can). New Wave is a term that’s widely used for pretty much all the music that came straight after punk. Therefore it includes a huge variety of sub-genres. Post punk, however, is not considered as a sub-genre to New Wave. It happened at the same time, but it was more of a separate movement. Nevertheless, it’s occasionally quite difficult to distinguish between the two. What’s the difference between them then? New Wave is more poppy based on quite simple melodies, whereas post punk is more artistic and complicated. Think of Duran Duran versus The Cure, for example.\n\nThe term New Wave was heavily used in the beginning of the 80s when pretty much every band was considered to be part of the movement. The term is especially associated with those artists that use synthesizers. Interestingly enough, Allmusic.com states that New Wave died in 1984, when I’ve heard bands even today being described as New Wave. In all honesty, it’s probably quite difficult to put an end date to a certain genre. You could as well claim that punk died in the beginning of the 80s, but then you’d be ignoring the fact that there still is a strong punk underground scene going on even today.\n\nAnyways, as mentioned earlier on already, New Wave could be broken into many different sub-genres. Because it’s difficult to name purely just “New Wave” acts, here’s a list of the different genres and a band from each of them to give an idea of what this movement was all about:\n\nMod Revival // The Jam\n\nNew Romantic // Duran Duran\n\nPost Punk (though it’s not always considered as part of new wave, it’s still overlapping with it enough to be mentioned here) // The Cure\n\nSka Revival // Madness\n\nSophisti Pop // The Style Council\n\nSynth Pop // Depeche Mode\n\nDark Wave // Bauhaus\n\nThere were also small relating movements going on all over Europe:\n\nColdwave, a variant of post punk popular in the French speaking world influenced mainly by Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees (the term was actually used to describe these two bands as well)\n\nNeue Deutsche Welle, the German New Wave/Post Punk movement including for example Alphaville and Falco\n\n(Fun fact: for some reason Wikipedia names Suomirokki (Finnish rock) as somehow being related to New Wave as well, I’m guessing because of the band Dingo which was a lot like the Finnish version of Duran Duran. As a Finn I ought to mention that)\n\nMany of these genres overlap heavily – for example many of the synth pop bands belong to some other genre as well (Depeche Mode was first considered as part of the New Romantic movement, for example). Sometimes even punk bands were considered to be part of New Wave; quite often the Clash, for example, is named in connection to the term.\n\nOverall, New Wave is one big mess. The term is mostly used to describe pretty much any and all music that came out in the beginning of 80s ranging from the Jam to Pet Shop Boys and Wham! to the Clash. I shall look more into some of the different sub-genres later on, hopefully making a lot more sense about what this mess is all about."
