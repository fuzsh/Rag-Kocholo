        "text": "When ex-New Order and Joy Division bassist Peter Hook first began performing the music of his former bands in 2010, he was petrified. Especially in playing songs by Joy Division, whose music had been all but mothballed by the former members since their singer Ian Curtis died by suicide in 1980.\n\nHook had a lot to lose. First, he’d left New Order in acrimonious circumstances and his ex-bandmates were watching on closely with acidic displeasure and legal interest. Second, he was going to be singing these songs himself, a role he was none too comfortable with. And third, performing Joy Division music, one of the most beloved alternative bands of all time, carried pressures.\n\n“I was so pissed off that New Order had played so few songs out of our own amazing back catalogue,” recalls Hook, 66, on a Zoom call from his home in Alderley Edge, near Manchester. “But we’d never celebrated anything to do with Joy Division either, which was heartbreaking. I was so nervous stepping into Ian Curtis’ shoes – and they were very big shoes to fill – and people’s expectations were very, very daunting and frightening.”\n\nWhen Curtis died, the remaining Joy Division members – Hook, Bernard Sumner and Stephen Morris – formed New Order, also adding keyboardist Gillian Gilbert. New Order were one of the most innovative and successful synth-pop groups of the era, but they were personally dysfunctional and, after years of in-fighting and disharmony, Hook quit in 2007, believing that to be the end of the band.\n\nInstead, they recruited two additional members and resumed touring as New Order in 2011. Legal challenges ensued from both parties about royalties and the use of band assets, with a settlement finally reached in 2017. With years of ugliness between them, Hook doesn’t hold back in interviews.\n\nLoading\n\n“They certainly are not New Order – that’s for sure,” he says vehemently. “The way they took the name was, in my opinion, absolutely disgraceful, and I’m still fighting it now. If they’d shown respect in what they did, if they’d told me what they were doing instead of springing it on me, then maybe I wouldn’t be so bullish.\n\n“[It’s sad] to see us trash each other and the wonderful achievements we managed. Just like kids in the playground, someone needs to just bang our heads together, really!”\n\nIn 2010, Hook recruited members of his side-project band Monaco, as well as his bassist son, Jack, to form Peter Hook & The Light. He struck on the idea of presenting Joy Division’s albums in full sequential order, augmented with non-album singles such as Transmission, Atmosphere and, of course, Love Will Tear Us Apart.\n\nThey’ve also since added New Order songs and albums to their repertoire. Hook says that in 2023 they’ll play New Order’s 2001 album Get Ready, then jokes, with much relish, that he may even do 2015’s Complete Music – the album New Order recorded without him – “just to really f--- ’em up!”\n\nFor this Australian tour they’ll perform 1979’s Unknown Pleasures and 1980’s Closer, plus some New Order classics. Hook says singing the late Curtis’ lyrics and vocals has made him feel closer to his former bandmate and friend, who is often cast as a depressive, intensely serious character.\n\nLoading\n\n“It’s no surprise to me that 18-year-old kids come up to me and say, ‘Ian really spoke to me’, because Ian really spoke to me, too,” Hook says. “He was amazing and I love it. He was very serious about the group, his ambitions and our performances, but he was very funny in other ways.”\n\nIntriguingly, after the court battles, the rancour, the spite and having not spoken to each other in 11 years, Hook reveals New Order have requested a meeting with him before he flies to Australia. He clarifies they won’t be reforming … for now.\n\n“The other meetings we’ve had have not been very successful,” he says cautiously. “But you live in hope. Hopefully we show respect and we’re able to talk to each other and make a plan to go forward. But you never know what could happen after that. We’re all in danger of falling for our exes, aren’t we!”\n\nPeter Hook & The Light will play sold out performances at Croxton Bandroom on Thursday November 17 and The Forum on Friday November 18, and will perform at Enmore Theatre in Newtown on Saturday November 19.\n\nA cultural guide to going out and loving your city.
