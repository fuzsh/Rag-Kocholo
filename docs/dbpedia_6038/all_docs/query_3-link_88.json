        "text": "New Order’s Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert have announced a reissue of the debut album which they released as part of the side-project, The Other Two.\n\nREAD MORE: “It felt like we were changing the world”: inside New Order’s seminal ‘Power, Corruption & Lies’\n\nSharing details of the reissue today (April 11), The Other Two will be bringing back their breakthrough album ‘The Other Two & You’ for a new 2024 edition, featuring a host of new features.\n\nIt will be available on DSPs and CDs, as well as on a vinyl pressing. The latter marks the first time it will be available in that format in three decades. All new versions are set to arrive on May 31, and can be pre-ordered here.\n\n“Is it really 31 years since this was first released? It doesn’t seem that long ago, but that’s old age for you,” both Morris and Gilbert said of the reissue. “We’re both very excited that this album (our first attempt at the pop solo spin-off malarkey) is getting another outing. This time with added vinyl connoisseur appeal and remixed sleeve artwork.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group was first formed by the New Order band members in 1990, and they went on to record their first LP at Real World Studios that same year. It featured production by Stephen Hague, as well as contributions from A Certain Ratio’s Jez Kerr.\n\nIt was the lead single ‘Tasty Fish’ that became their first hit and was released to critical acclaim that year. The full album arrived in 1993 on London Records, following the closure of Factory Records. It started life as a collection of tracks while composing for the 90’s hit TV show ‘Making Out’ – the main theme of which was an adaptation of New Order’s track ‘Vanishing Point.’\n\nRecommended\n\nIn the new 2024 edition, the album contains a previously unreleased version of ‘Innocence’ from Love To Infinity on both CD and Vinyl. Check out the full tracklist below.\n\n‘The Other Two & You’ 2024 reissue tracklist is:\n\nCD format:\n\n‘Tasty Fish’\n\n‘The Greatest Thing’\n\n‘Selfish’\n\n‘Movin’ On’\n\n‘Ninth Configuration’\n\n‘Feel This Love’\n\n‘Spirit Level’\n\n‘Night Voice\n\n‘Innocence (Love To Infinity 7″ Remix)\n\n‘Loved It (The Other Track)\n\nVinyl format:\n\nSide One:\n\n‘Tasty Fish’\n\n‘The Greatest Thing’\n\n‘Selfish’\n\n‘Movin’ On’\n\n‘Ninth Configuration’\n\n‌\n\nSide Two:\n\n‘Feel This Love’\n\n‘Spirit Level’\n\n‘Night Voice’\n\n‘Innocence’ (Love To Infinity 7″ Remix)\n\n‘Loved It (The Other Track)’ *CD only originally\n\nIn other New Order news, at the start of the year the band released a new ‘Blue Monday’-themed t-shirt in support of mental health charity CALM for the second year running. The first collaboration took place in 2023, when the members and designer Peter Saville came together to mark the January date known as Blue Monday – the most depressing day of the year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast November, the band also announced a series of huge UK shows in Cardiff and Manchester, set to take place later this summer. Visit here for remaining tickets.\n\nEarlier last year, founding member Bernard Sumner also spoke to NME about his collaboration with Mella Dee ‘Riptide’, and what the future holds.\n\n“It was all about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and I was just seeing that all of the time,” he said, recalling the political inspiration for the lyrics. “I’d been in a vacuum so I wrote it about politics, really, and the war. I wanted to write it about something that meant a lot to me.”"
