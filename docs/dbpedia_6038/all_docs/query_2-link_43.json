        "text": "Last year, pop and rap star Post Malone made his first Country Airplay chart entry alongside the late Joe Diffie on a “duet” version of Diffie’s “Pickup Man,” (billed as Joe Diffie featuring Post Malone), which debuted at No. 54 shortly after he teamed with Morgan Wallen and HARDY to perform the song on the 2023 CMA Awards. Malone is featured on HARDY’s upcoming Hixtape Vol. 3: Difftape (out March 29), but in an interview backstage at the 2023 CMA Awards with Access Hollywood, Post Malone also teased his own country music project. Asked if he has a country album in the works, he said, “I think so…yes.”\n\nEven two years ago, Post Malone seemed to be signaling his love for country music, singing a cover of Brad Paisley’s “I’m Gonna Miss Her.” Meanwhile, photos of Posty in the studio and/or writing rooms with everyone from Brad Paisley to Luke Combs have popped up over the past several months. Meanwhile, Morgan Wallen previously told Billboard of a late-night studio session with Post Malone, “[He] likes to write really, really late at night — and I can’t do that three nights in a row. I can do that one night. I can start about 5 p.m., but starting at 10 p.m. — that’s rough.”\n\nThough there is no word on any official album, pop star Ed Sheeran has spent considerable time in Nashville over the years. During rehearsals for the 2023 Academy of Country Music Awards (where he ultimately performed a collaboration with Luke Combs on “Life Goes On”), Sheeran told Billboard he would “love to transition into country,” adding, “I love the culture of it, I just love the songwriting. It’s just like brilliant songs.”\n\nHe also noted that he has lived in Nashville for periods of time in 2013 and in 2018. He said of the city’s songwriters, “It’s like a community. There’s not really a place in Europe where you could point and say, ‘That’s the home of songwriting. It’s not just for country music. Nashville is just a hub of incredible songwriters, incredible performers. And I really felt inspired just being there being around everyone.”\n\nSpeaking of songwriting, Sheeran is a co-writer on Kenny Chesney’s 2019 single “Tip of My Tongue.” He is also a writer on the Faith Hill/Tim McGraw duet “The Rest of Our Life” and the Keith Urban song “Parallel Line.” Also in 2019, he released the song “Blow,” which he co-wrote and performed alongside Chris Stapleton and Bruno Mars.\n\nTowering above the recent slate of country-intended projects is the surprise release of two new country songs from Beyoncé.\n\nBeyoncé, owner of eight No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hits and the most Grammy wins of all time, shook up the music industry once again on Sunday night (Feb. 11) by using a Super Bowl commercial to announce the release of new music, and thus, entering her country era. Though we don’t know the full spectrum of sounds that could be included on the entire project, she did release two country-flavored new songs, the up-tempo romp “Texas Hold ‘Em” and more Americana-flavored ballad “16 Carriages.” The two new songs are part of her upcoming March 29 album Act II, which follows her dance music-inspired Renaissance and is part of a three-act project.\n\nOn streaming platforms, the new songs have topped Apple Music’s top country songs chart and “Texas Hold ‘Em” holds the top spot on Spotify’s country playlist.\n\nJust how fully country radio stations embrace the new music remains to be seen, although “Texas Hold ‘Em” has been serviced to country radio, officially impacting Feb. 20. Both of the new songs highlight Black roots musicians, with “Texas Hold ‘Em” featuring banjo from Rhiannon Giddens, while “16 Carriages” features pedal steel from Robert Randolph.\n\nThis isn’t Beyoncé’s first foray into country sounds, collaborations and more. At the 2007 American Music Awards, Sugarland (Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush) collaborated with Beyoncé on a performance of Bey’s “Irreplaceable,” which had spent 10 weeks atop the Hot 100. The Houston, Texas native has also performed at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo several times, both as a solo artist and part of Destiny’s Child.\n\nIn 2016, she performed at the Country Music Association Awards, performing her song “Daddy Lessons” alongside The Chicks—a performance that was met with considerable controversy at the time. Meanwhile, country music queen (and recent Super Bowl national anthem performer) Reba McEntire turned her version of Beyoncé’s “If I Was a Boy” into a country hit back in 2010.\n\nAt the 2024 Grammy Awards, Beyoncé further signaled her country intentions, showing up to the ceremony in a Western-themed attire, including a cowboy hat and bolo tie. But even as far back as her announcement of Renaissance, promotional photos showed Beyonce donning a cowboy hat and seated atop a glass horse, while back in 2021, Beyonce’s Ivy Park x Adidas collaboration released a “Rodeo Collection,” featuring pink cow prints and denim-athleisure pieces.\n\nOf the new crop of pop artists looking to cross into country, Beyonce is primed to once again make music history, as while several Black male artists such as Rucker, Charley Pride, Stoney Edwards, Blanco Brown and Jimmie Allen have earned country chart success, including No. 1 hits, over the decades, Black female artists largely haven’t reached the same chart heights.\n\nWhich isn’t to say Black female artists have been absent from the country landscape. The Pointer Sisters earned a top 40 Hot Country Songs hit (and won a best country vocal performance by a duo or group Grammy) with “Fairytale” in 1974, while Anita Pointer teamed with Earl Thomas Conley for the No. 2 country hit “Too Many Times” in 1986. Linda Martell reached No. 22 on the Hot Country Songs chart with “Color Him Father” in 1969 and in 1977, Ruby Falls earned a top 40 hit on the Hot Country Songs chart with “You’ve Got to Mend This Heartache.” Mickey Guyton’s 2015 song “Better Than You Left Me” reached No. 34 on the Country Airplay chart. Other Black female artists who have charted on the Hot Country Songs chart include Rissi Palmer and Dona Mason.\n\nIt is also notable that with “Texas Hold ‘Em” and “16 Carriages,” Beyonce joins several current Black female artists who have adeptly crafted their own unique, genre-melting blends of country, pop, R&B and more — including Yola, Tanner Adell, Reyna Roberts, Madeline Edwards, Tiera and mother-daughter duo O.N.E the Duo. With the consumption of “Texas Hold ‘Em” and “16 Carriages” already riding high on streaming services, it is likely–and recommended–that fans seeking sounds comparable to Beyonce’s current music seek out these artists to add to their personal music rotations."
