        "text": "Music purists will argue to the death that half - or most - of the bands I've included aren't truly part of the New Wave genre.\n\nThey are right, and I'm okay being completely wrong.\n\nYou might know prior to starting Spooky Little Halloween, I lived in the music world as a blogger. And here's the thing about music genres: they're a bunch of marketing crap.\n\nYes, it's convenient to group together like bands, slap a label on them and point to their music as defining a movement. But I also think a lot of genres and subgenres were once made up in the heads of rock critics who needed a clever way to describe the hot new band they were required to write about.\n\nSo when I say New Wave, it's more of a sound I'm after than genre accuracy.\n\nOkay, enough music snob chatter - let's listen to some spooky tunes.\n\nHalloween New Wave"
