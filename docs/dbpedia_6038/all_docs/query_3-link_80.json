        "text": "The definitive story of Joy Division told by the band's legendary bassist, PETER HOOK – now available in the U.S. for the first time\n\nUNKNOWN PLEASURES\n\nINSIDE JOY DIVISION\n\nBY PETER HOOK\n\nPublication Date: January 29, 2013\n\n“Required reading for anyone who ever felt moved by Joy Division’s cold, dark music.” – KIRKUS, in a starred review\n\n“Vivid, funny, and unexpectedly touching, Peter Hook’s memoir strips away the shroud of myth surrounding Joy Division to offer a refreshingly gritty perspective on the story of four ordinary young men who together made extraordinary music.” – Simon Reynolds, author of Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-84\n\nJoy Division changed the face of music. Godfathers of alternative rock, they reinvented music in the post-punk era, creating a unique new sound – dark, hypnotic, and intense – that would influence U2, Morrissey, R.E.M., Radiohead, and numerous others. Bono has said of them: “It would be harder to find a darker place in music than Joy Division. Their name, their lyrics, and their singer were as big a black cloud as you could find in the sky. And yet I sensed the pursuit of God, or light, or reason… A reason to be. With Joy Division, you felt from this singer beauty was truth and truth was beauty, and theirs was a search for both.”\n\nOn stage, lead singer Ian Curtis was a mesmerizing and enigmatic figure. Few realized, however, that he was secretly struggling. A recent diagnosis of epilepsy rendered him prone to fits, many exacerbated by light displays on stage during the band’s performances. Off the road, he struggled to provide for a new baby as his young marriage faltered. The lure of the road beckoned, and a burgeoning love affair grew. But it all proved too much to handle.\n\nThe story is now legendary: in 1980, on the heels of their groundbreaking debut, Unknown Pleasures, and on the eve of their first U.S. tour, Ian Curtis committed suicide. Yet in the mere three years they were together, Joy Division produced two landmark albums and a handful of singles—including the iconic anthem “Love Will Tear Us Apart”—that continue to have a powerful resonance.\n\nNow, for the first time, their story is told by one of their own. In UNKNOWN PLEASURES: Inside Joy Division (It Books | January 29, 2013 | Hardcover |$27.99 | also available from HarperCollins e-books) – originally published in the UK by Simon & Schuster UK on September 27, 2012 – founding member and bass player Peter Hook recounts how four young men from Manchester and Salford , with makeshift instruments and a broken-down van, rose from the punk scene to create haunting, atmospheric music that would define a generation.\n\nHook shares previously unseen photographs and paraphernalia, including two eight-page color photo inserts, and reflects, with eye-opening candor, on the suicide of Ian Curtis: often seen as the “intellectual one” by the public – Curtis was to Peter and the band just “one of the lads” who, like them, had tremendous fun being young and a musician. Hook shares his regret that Ian’s burdens only emerged when it was too late – and, when they did emerge, that Hook and the band carried on like it was business as usual.\n\nCovering the band's friendships and fall-outs; the evolution of their sound and image; their rehearsals and recording sessions; and the larger-than-life characters who formed a vital part of the Joy Division legend, including Factory Records founder Tony Wilson and producer Martin Hannett, Hook tells the exclusive story of the band in this unflinchingly honest memoir. He also reveals new insights, such as:\n\n· Why Hook hated the sound of Unknown Pleasures when he first heard it, and how all of the things he loves about the album today – the spacey, echoey ambient sound of it – were all the things he initially hated\n\n· Which portrayal of Ian on film Hook prefers and why\n\n· How Hook developed his three-fingered method of playing bass – from playing badly\n\n· How the punk scene is so different for bands today – and how, when Joy Division was getting started, there was no manual, no “how to” and that made it exciting – and why being on an indie label let them behave so badly during press interviews\n\n· Why their first record, put on by a DJ at a local club in Manchester literally cleared the dance floor\n\n· Why producer Martin Hannett tore apart Stephen Morris’s drum kit while recording Unknown Pleasures\n\n· Some of the legendary pranks the band pulled on the road – and the particularly epic prank involving maggots on the Buzzcocks tour\n\nWith a comprehensive timeline and insightful track-by-track breakdowns of the songs on their two sole albums – Unknown Pleasures and Closer, this is the book that Joy Division fans have awaited for decades.\n\nPeter Hook was born in 1956 in Salford, England. A founding member of Joy Division and New Order, he is an international DJ and tours Joy Division’s music with his new band, the Light. He lives in Cheshire.\n\nOnline: www.peterhook.co.uk\n\nAUTHOR TOUR EVENTS FOR UNKNOWN PLEASURES:\n\nMonday, Jan. 28 | Brooklyn, NY | 7:00 PM\n\nPowerhouse Arena | in conversation with Brandon Stosuy of Pitchfork\n\nTuesday, Jan. 29 | New York, NY | 7:00 PM\n\nStrand Bookstore | in conversation with Sasha Frere-Jones of the New Yorker\n\nThursday, Jan. 31 | San Francisco, CA | 7:00 PM\n\nJCC of San Francisco | in conversation with David Pescovitz of Boing Boing\n\nFriday, Feb. 1 | Los Angeles, CA | 7:30 PM\n\nSkylight Books\n\nSaturday, Feb. 2 | San Diego, CA | 4:00 PM\n\nM-Theory Records\n\nMonday, Feb. 4 | Cincinnati, OH | 7:00 PM\n\nJoseph-Beth Booksellers\n\nTuesday, Feb. 5 | Chicago, IL | 6:00 PM\n\nMuseum of Contemporary Art\n\nWednesday, Feb. 6 | Long Island, NY | 7:00 PM\n\nBook Revue\n\nThursday, Feb. 7| Boston, MA | 7:00\n\nBrookline Booksmith | in conversation with author/writer Scott Heim\n\nFriday, Feb. 8 | Boston, MA | 7:00\n\nPorter Square Books | in conversation with NPR music critic Tim Riley\n\nPRAISE FROM THE UK PUBLICATION OF UNKNOWN PLEASURES:\n\n“Hook has restored a flesh-and-blood rawness to what was becoming a standard tale. Few pop music books manage that.” —Andy Beckett, The Guardian\n\n“The most colorful and intimate account of Joy Division ever written . . . a marvelous raconteur[,] Hook evokes the spirit of the age with a bluff authenticity that no outsider could hope to emulate . . . explaining the creation of his band’s remarkable music with all the passion and insight it deserves.”\n\n—Keith Cameron, MOJO\n\n“A self-confessed “working-class yobbo,” Hook writes with real enthusiasm about the unlikely lads who ended up forming two of Britain’s most influential bands (Joy Division and, after the suicide of their lead singer Ian Curtis, New Order) . . . will keep you entertained for a very long time” —Rob Fitzpatrick, Sunday Times\n\nNEW ORDER TO RELEASE LONG AWAITED LOST SIRENS\n\nEight Track Mini-Album Featuring Previously Unheard Tracks Available For Digital Download On January 15 From Rhino\n\nNew Order are proud to announce the release of THE LOST SIRENS, an eight track mini album featuring a truly eclectic mix of electronica and guitars in the truly inimitable New Order style. The album was written, produced and recorded by Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook, Stephen Morris and Philip Cunningham and will be available for download at digital retail outlets on January 15.\n\n“Lost Sirens? Well, it’s not really lost,” explains drummer Stephen Morris. “I remember that Martin Hannett once had an idea of making a record and burying it in his garden, so that one day someone would dig it up, like a time capsule. We just stuck our record in a cupboard. And now we’ve got it out.When we did the first one (Waiting For The Sirens’ Call) we had 20 ideas for songs - we were going through a particularly prolific phase – but we couldn’t make a double concept album out of them all, so we thought we’d just do two instead. The intention was always to write four or five more songs and then put it out 18 months or so after the first one. When we unearthed it from the cupboard recently, with the intention of red-editing some of the songs, we all agreed they didn’t actually need it, and it should just be out there. So here it is.”\n\nTHE LOST SIRENS\n\n1. I’ll Stay with You\n\n2. Sugarcane\n\n3. Recoil\n\n4. Californian Grass\n\n5. Hellbent\n\n6. Shake It Up\n\n7. I’ve Got A Feeling\n\n8. I Told You So\n\nPeter Hook And The Light Debut New Order’s First Two Albums With Special London & Manchester Concerts January 2013\n\n“Movement (1981) / Power Corruption And Lies (1983)”\n\nThursday 17th January 2013 Friday 18th January 2013\n\nKoko, Camden, London Manchester Cathedral\n\nTickets : www.seetickets.com Tickets : www.alt-tickets.co.uk\n\nwww.ticketweb.co.uk 24 Hour Booking – 0845 413 4444\n\n24 Hour Booking – 0844 477 1000\n\nTickets For Both Concert On Sale 9am Tuesday 25th September 2012\n\nTickets £20 include charity donation to MIND & Forever Manchester\n\nPeter Hook And The Light are to debut their performances of the first two albums released by New Order, “Movement” (1981) and “Power Corruption And Lies” (1983) with two unique, inaugural London and Manchester concerts in January 2013, the first at the legendary Koko in London and the second a distinctive and special event, taking place at Manchester Cathedral\n\nAlongside the performances of the albums in full and in sequential order, which has become one of the hallmarks of The Light’s live performances to date, the band are also set to revisit the many classic singles of the 1981 to 1983 including “Ceremony”, “Everything’s Gone Green”, “Temptation” and “Blue Monday” which New Order generally refused to include on the albums, considering the LP’s should stand alone in comparison to the single releases.\n\nAs with the other albums across the Joy Division and New Order canon, both albums have stood the test of time with the period marking the emergence of the new band and their developing sound whilst also, most notably on “Movement” referring back to Joy Division musical template.\n\nThe last album from the band to be produced by Martin Hannett, “Movement’s reputation has grown stronger amongst fans and aficionados since its release, becoming more respected and revered, especially for its emotional and music links to Joy Division and its themes of a band finding its feet in the aftermath of tragedy, looking towards new experimentation and techniques.\n\nWith the band not having settled on a permanent lead singer by the time of the recording of Movement, Peter Hook took lead vocals on two of the albums tracks, opener “Dreams Never End” and “Doubts Even Here”, the former now widely admired with Hooky’s elegant bass line hinting at the direction in which the band were now heading. Insurgent and anthemic in equal parts, “Movement” as its title suggests shows a band embracing progress and a lighter touch and style on “Chosen Time” and “Senses”, a mood counterbalanced with the not unexpected emotion and soul searching on album centre-point “The Him”, “ICB” and “Truth”.\n\nIn comparison, “Power Corruption And Lies” shows the emergence of what is generally termed the trademark, archetypal New Order sound. More open and optimistic than the title might suggest, the Peter Saville designed album cover takes the National Gallery owned “A Basket Of Roses” by Henri Fantin Latour and makes the sleeve a piece of modern art which has been widely lauded since its release three decades ago.\n\nCritically “Power, Corruption And Lies” was also more enthusiastically received than its predecessor with superlative immediately forthcoming from the very best sections of the music press. Containing some of the fans persistent live favourites such as “Age Of Consent” and “Your Silent Face”, it was this album that cemented New Order’s reputation and showed a cohesiveness and new found confidence emanating from the band.\n\nOpening side A, “Age Of Consent” highlights the increasing influence of electronica on the band, its light and airy synths allies to a bassline performed with finesse. The low slung angular post punk funk of “Ultraviolence” and the first part of “586” could have made Joy Division’ second album “Closer” but as “586” closes the first side with a flourish of synthesisers and electro, the track in particular comes to define the changes in New Order’s style.\n\nSometimes compared to Kraftwerk’s “Trans Europe Express” on the flipside, the elegantly angelic “Your Silent Face” has been termed a sublime, techno tinged ballad and is still regarded as one of New Order’s finest ever tunes. The album also begins to show the influence of the then opened FAC 51 The Hacienda encroaching on the band’s craft and closes off with the jauntily, uplifting “Ecstacy” and the delicately wrought and soulful “Leave Me Alone”, Although later editions of the album have included mega hit “Blue Monday” and its instrumental counterpart “The Beach”, these were not included on the original release,\n\nSupport at both concerts comes from Manchester based Modern Blonde, comprising Adam and Tom Greenhalgh alongside Ben Silver. Over the past two years they have released 35 songs spread over two albums, available to download free from their Bandcamp page linked below. They have drawn comparisons to Kraftwerk, Ariel Pink, R Stevie Moore and Frank Zappa and are currently working on a third album as well as regularly performing live.\n\nAs with the previous debut album concerts by The Light, both gigs benefit two charities, Mind, the mental health charity and Forever Manchester, a local Manchester charity which supports numerous community based initiatives.\n\nPeter Hook And The Light’s “Closer” Tour Of United States &\n\nDebut “Unknown Pleasures” Canadian/Mexican Dates Sept / Oct 2011\n\nPeter Hook and The Light are set to return for a tour of the United States performing Joy Division’s seminal second album “Closer” for the first time in the county following their debut tour there last December. The tour will also see the band’s play Canada for the first time with appearances in Toronto and Montreal before making a three date debut tour of Mexico where they will perform “Unknown Pleasures” for the first time in either country.\n\nIn revisiting “Closer”, whose hauntingly austere atmosphere and emotive content is considered a “start to finish masterpiece”* (Pitchfork Media – see below), the tour will see The Light reproduce Joy Divison’s highly esteemed album for fans.\n\nThe Light are returning to some of the venues from last year’s December tour where they performed the debut album “Unknown Pleasures” to give fans the opportunity to see its follow up LP “Closer”, played by the band sequentially and in full. Both of the Martin Hannett produced albums are considered seminal and hugely admired classics of the genre and the influence of both LPs remains pervasive today, both for fans and for the many emerging bands who take on the template of Joy Division’s sound in the modern era.\n\nAs Martin Hannett’s incandescent production permeates the record alongside a band that had grown much in confidence since their debut, Closer also yielded many landmark Joy Division tracks including “Atrocity Exhibition, “Heart And Soul” and “Twenty Four Hours”.\n\nThe Light will also be performing “Unknown Pleasures” (“simply one of the best records ever made, and is still powerful enough to floor you 30 years on” NME) at the second LA date at El Rey Theatre and at the Denver date and also across all the Canadian and Mexican tour dates.\n\nAs Martin Hannett’s incandescent production permeates the record alongside a band that had grown much in confidence since their debut, Closer also yielded many landmark Joy Division tracks including “Atrocity Exhibition, “Heart And Soul” and “Twenty Four Hours”.\n\nThe Light have been consistently touring since the debut of their performance of Unknown Pleasures in May 2010 at The Factory in Manchester, with dates across the UK, Ireland, most European countries, an extensive tour of Australia and New Zealand last September and their debut US Tour in December 2010.

The effervescent and punky tune has been completed for the first time by Hooky And The Light for this release.\n\nThe Light’s guest vocalist Rowetta performs three of the classic Joy Division tracks which she has been singing live with the band over the past year, “Insight, “New Dawn Fades” and “Atmosphere”, delivering intensely passionate performances across all three tracks.\n\nVideos for “Pictures In My Mind” and “Atmosphere” have been shot and will be made available a week prior to the release on Monday 2nd May 2011.\n\nThe design for the EP is a stunning post apocalyptic Manchester streetscape by local Manc artist James Chadderton who works as a tutor in the city in 3D and Graphic design. Inspired by the nightmarish futuristic visions of movies like The Terminator, Dawn Of The Dead, and the BBC’s classic “Threads” series, many assume that James’s artwork depict post nuclear fallout but James prefers to characterise them as “human devoid wastelands where the buildings have been left to decay.\n\nPeter Hook And The Light were all heavily involved in the conception and design of the cover. According to James – “Hooky was great to work with during the design process. His band and he had a lot of ideas for the artwork and we worked together throughout the project.”\n\n“Initially it was going to be just an area of Manchester but Peter had idea to use the corner of Whitworth Street where the new Hacienda flats were built. It was always a shame that they replaced such an iconic building with something as sterile as flats but as a focal point it worked very well as its size dominates the area.\n\n“I was shocked and very honoured to be asked to do the cover. I've worked on a few bits and pieces for bands and games companies over the years but nothing quite as important as this. Since being asked by Hooky and The Light, I have been looking though the graphic work related to Joy Division which is incredible. It was intimidating to have to make something to live up to the quality of such iconic images that have gone before”\n\nJames Chadderton, Manchester, April 2011. For more details on James’ work check http://www.avonius.com/.\n\nPeter Hook said of the design – “After seeing the recent events in Japan with the earthquake, the picture sends a chill down my spine now when I see it. I was very impressed with James's work when I first came across it and I kept leaving messages for him as I wanted him to do the cover. I suggested Whitworth Street because it remains our spiritual home, and I must admit I thought that the new Hacienda building could do with some remodelling!\n\n· Peter Hook’s The Light to perform “Closer”, Joy Division’s second album and melancholic masterpiece live for the first time ever at The Factory in Manchester On Wednesday 18th May 2011.\n\n· Other UK dates with The Light performing “Unknown Pleasures” prior to The Factory gig are London Scala (Saturday 23rd April) and Liquid Edinburgh (Saturday 30th April).

The Peter Saville chosen cover of a Bernard Pierre Wolf, Appiani Tomb portrait has served to enhance its myth although Saville had never heard Closer when he chose the image prior to Ian’s passing.\n\nWith Martin Hannett’s incandescent production permeating the record allied with a band that had developed in stature and confidence since their debut “Unknown Pleasures”, the album came to yield many classic Joy Division tracks, “Atrocity Exhibition, “Heart And Soul”, and “Twenty Four Hours”.\n\nWith a much greater use of keyboards than its predecessor, Closer also contained many references to New Order’s future direction, which the Joy Division’s remaining band members were to move on with, almost immediately at the time of the release of “Closer”, studiously ignoring the album at the time.\n\n*On Closer – The Album” (Pitchfork Media)\n\n\"Closeris even more austere, more claustrophobic, more inventive, more beautiful, and more haunting than its predecessor. It's also Joy Division's start-to-finish masterpiece, a flawless encapsulation of everything the group sought to achieve\" 10 / 10.\n\nThe Light’s performance of “Closer” on the evening is also being recorded by Ronnie Lane’s mobile recording studio for a vinyl only release later in 2011.\n\nOn Mind & The Keith Bennett Appeals Involvement\n\nThe May 18th Closer gig continues the same charities involved in last year’s event, Mind and The Keith Bennett Appeal.\n\nOn Mind’s involvement, chief executive Paul Farmer commented\"I am delighted that Peter Hookhas decided toonce againsupport Mindfollowing thesuccess of lastyear's gig which helped fund our work to improve the lives of people with mental distress, and to combatthe stigma that still surrounds mental health problems. Our huge thanks goes to Peter and everyone else involved with the concert for their continued support.\"\n\nPeter Hook Press Quotes On Closer\n\nHooky on Closer’s release in July 1980....\n\n“Well I remember the recording very well I don’t remember the release at all. I think I disowned it in the shock of losing Ian. I just retreated from anything to do with Joy Division recording or otherwise, I didn’t celebrate it, I didn’t listen to it it, I didn’t read the reviews I didn’t have anything to with it, nothing at all.\n\nPeter Hook on revisiting Closer....\n\n“When I decided to do Unknown Pleasures, I knew that was a strong record. We all felt confident about the material, about ourselves, the way that you have to be in a group, full of self belief. Closer is a completely different thing - I’m actually approaching it with great interest because I know that by the time we got to “Closer”, the elephant in the room or rather the epilepsy in the room, was such a big part of everything Joy Division did. It was like a fifth member and living with it was very difficult and it coloured the atmosphere and the music of “Closer” a great deal.\n\n“Although we tried to make the best of the situation when recording Closer, it was really tempered by Ian’s illness. After living with the lyrics of Unknown Pleasures, analysing them and then singing them live, living them in much more in depth. I know that with Closer I am going to have to do the same, I will be trying to put Ian's feelings in, to believe in what I'm doing. I am wary to say the least, because of Ian’s state and frame of mind at the time. I’m really not looking forward to living with and analysing these lyrics.”\n\nPeter Hook on playing the albums live...\n\n“ I’m doing this because I have enjoyed playing Unknown Pleasures so much, after 30 years to get the music back is the best thing artistically that’s ever happened to me because as I said I turned my back on the music, we all did. Now I’ve had the opportunity to take it back some three decades later.\n\n“It’s taken me 30 years to come to terms with what happened. I don’t think we were wrong at all to do what we did.”\n\n“The responsibility is daunting but ultimately when I look at the people watching me play it. I have never felt once that anybody watching it didn’t want me to do it.”\n\nPeter Hook’s The Light\n\nPeter Hook’s The Light features Peter Hook on vocals and bass, Jack Bates on bass, Nat Wason on guitar, Andy Poole on keyboards and Paul Kehoe on drums. Rowetta performs as guest vocalist at selected gigs.\n\nHaving performed together at the opening night of The Factory in February 2010, in the past twelve months The Light have undertaken extensive tours of mainland Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and The United States, as well as numerous UK and international festival appearances.\n\nPeter Hook’s The Light Tour Dates To June 2011\n\nDates in Bold feature Rowetta as guest vocalist\n\nAll dates apart from May 18th at The Factory Manchester see The Light perform Unknown Pleasures\n\n09/03/11 La Carene, Brest, France\n\n10/03/11Le Trabendo, Paris, France\n\n11/03/11Big Band Cafe, Caen, France\n\n17/03/11Astro Hall, Tokyo Japan\n\n18/03/11Zepp, Tokyo, Japan\n\n19/03/11Creative Centre, Osaka, Japan\n\n25/03/11Helsinki, Finland\n\n27/03/11Oslo, Norway\n\n30/03/11 Rosso, Manchester (Nordoff Robins Charity Event)\n\n23/04/11Scala, London\n\n30/04/11Liquid, Edinburgh\n\n07/05/11 Festival Donorte, Pontevedra, Spain\n\n18/05/11The Factory, Manchester (Performing Closer)\n\n28/05/11Den Haag, Holland\n\n29/05/11Eindhoven, Holland\n\nFreebass\n\n“Two Worlds Collide – The Arthur Baker Remixes”\n\nVocals By The Charlatans’ Tim Burgess\n\nPiers Morgan Tonight – Arthur Baker Freebass Remix Chosen For CNN Trailer\n\nFormer Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan has long since left the print industry for a television career and his increasing profile, especially in the US with his role of judge on America’s Got Talent, has seen him land one of the most prestigious job in journalism as the replacement for America’s foremost interviewer Larry King as retires from his “Larry King Live” 9pm CNN show.\n\n“Piers Morgan Tonight” launches Monday 17th January in the Larry King slot and with the Piers the King-In-Waiting US chat, he is joined in the first show by the Queen of Stateside TV, Oprah Winfrey, who has recently launched her own TV channels, OWN (Oprah Winfrey Network)\n\nFreebass’ “You Don’t Know This About Me”, Arthur Baker remix has been chosen to soundtrack the advance thirty second television promo for this much anticipated launch, with the theme “You Don’t Know This About.... Piers”.\n\nTo watch the promo, http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/bestoftv/2010/12/29/piers.morgan.event.promo.cnn?iref=allsearch\n\nhttp://bitURL.net/azhv\n\nThe track was recorded in the early on Freebass sessions before the band found a lead singer and The Charlatan’s Tim Burgess wrote the vocal for his Mancunian rock star pals driving round the Hollywood Hills before it became the lead track on Freebass’ debut EP “Two Worlds Collide.\n\nThe EP which featured all three bassists who formed the band (Hooky, Mani, Rourkie) and guest vocalists, was released digitally on Hacienda Records in March 2010 and as a physical release by Hacienda Records / 24 Hour Service Station October 2010.\n\nOpening with a trademark Peter Hook bassline, “You Don’t Know This About Me” proves a melodic and dramatic, stylish turn with an ascendant Stateside feel that permeates the track, appropriately enough since Tim wrote and recorded the vocal from his home in LA. Arch guitars interplay surrounds Tim’s vocal which also underpins the rework by New Order production legend Arthur Baker which is the version employed in the advert, a subtle but hypnotic acid house reworking.\n\nTim remembers “Hooky gave me a couple of tracks to on and that was the one that came most naturally to me. I think it’s got more of a touch of Joy Division to it than New Order really and I started thinking about Iggy Pop and Ian Curtis. I honestly tried to think about what Hooky would like. I was pretty sure that Hooky loved being on the road so that’s where that section “I love the road” came from but then it all got a bit surreal.”\n\nTwo World Collide also feature contributions from reformed ex Oxford drug smuggling beatnik tunred international raconteur Howard Marks who turned in a once in a sterling vocal on “Dark Starr”, a darkly grungey piece of rock and roll mischief and brought Pete Wylie into the surreal on “The Milky Way Is Our Playgroud” a soaring, poetic, euphoric space rock track with a star-struck cerebral vocal from our Liverpool “The Story Of The Blues\" man.\n\nFreebass Online Links\n\nTo stream the Arthur Baker Mix of You Don’t Know This About Me at www.fac51thehacienda.com.\n\nhttp://www.fac51thehacienda.com/news/2011/01/piers-morgan-freebass/1718\n\nhttp://bitURL.net/azj6\n\nTo purchase or listen to The Arthur Baker remixes -\n\nHacienda Site –\n\nhttp://www.fac51thehacienda.com/product/music/audio/freebass-you-dont-know-about-me-remixes\n\nhttp://bitURL.net/azhv\n\nI Tunes - http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/you-dont-know-this-about-me/id383450580\n\nhttp://bitURL.net/azhw\n\n24 Hour Service Station – http://24hourservicestation.com/album/freebass/freebass_you_dont_know_this_about_me_the_arthur_baker_remixes\n\nhttp://bitURL.net/azhx\n\nTo listen to the original mix and other tracks on the Two Worlds Collide EP\n\nTwo Worlds Collide – I Tunes - 4 Track EP\n\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/two-worlds-collide/id376079488\n\nhttp://bitURL.net/azk9\n\nHacienda Site -http://www.fac51thehacienda.com/product/music/audio/freebass-two-worlds-collide\n\nhttp://bitURL.net/azma\n\nHacienda Individual Download - http://www.fac51thehacienda.com/product/music/audio/freebass-you-dont-know-about-me-0\n\nhttp://bitURL.net/azmb\n\nShadowplayers\n\nThe Rise and Fall of Factory Records\n\nJames Nice\n\nIntroduction by Jon Savage\n\n'Definitive and comprehensive, this is the actual story of Factory Records'\n\nPeter Saville\n\n'Such a rare thing – really interesting and immensely readable. I learnt a lot!'\n\nPeter Hook\n\n'This book is surely the definitive study of the chaotic, praxis-driven enterprise that was Factory Communications'\n\nStephen Morris\n\n‘Few people can rival his knowledge of the label’s history . . . James Nice is uniquely placed to write the definitive chronicle of Factory Records.’\n\nSimon Reynolds, author of\n\nRip It Up and Start Again\n\n·The first full account of Factory Records, the most radical and innovative label in British pop history.\n\n·Foreword by Jon Savage\n\nIn 1978, a ‘Factory for Sale’ sign gave Alan Erasmus and Tony Wilson a name for their fledgling Manchester club night. Though they couldn’t have known it at the time, this was the launch of one of the most significant musical and cultural legacies of the late twentieth century. The club’s electrifying live scene soon translated to vinyl, and Factory Records went on to become the most innovative and celebrated record label of the next thirty years.\n\nAlways breaking new musical ground, Factory introduced the listening public to bands such as Joy Division, whose Unknown Pleasures was the label’s first album release, New Order, Durutti Column and Happy Mondays. Propelled onwards by the inspirational cultural entrepreneur, Tony Wilson, Factory always sought new ways to energise the popular consciousness, such as the infamous Hacienda nightclub, which enjoyed a chequered 15-year history after opening in 1982. Factory’s reputation as a cultural hub was also bolstered by its fierce commitment to its own visual identity, achieved through the iconic sleeve designs and campaigning artwork of Peter Saville.\n\nHowever, the lofty reputation of Factory’s musical and artistic ventures were only sporadically converted into commercial success, and when London Records pulled out of a takeover bid in 1992 because of the absence of contracts, the fate of Factory Communications Ltd was sealed. But the label’s downfall has done nothing to quell interest in the Factory legend, as films such as 24-Hour Party People and Control attest. Yet despite this perennial interest, the definitive, authentic story of Factory Records has never been told – until now.\n\nShadowplayers is the most complete, authoritative and thoroughly researched account of how a group of provincial anarchists and entrepreneurs saw off bankers, journalists and gun-toting gangsters to create the most influential record label of modern times. Based on both archive and contemporary sources, the book tells the full story of Factory’s heroic struggles, its complex web of inventive, idiosyncratic and tragic personalities, and ultimately, the acclaimed and much-loved music it produced.\n\nJames Nice is an author, journalist and record-label owner. He once worked for Factory Benelux and now administers much of the former Factory catalogue.\n\nShadowplayers: The Rise and Fall of Factory Records by James Nice is published on June 10th 2010\n\nBernard Sumner Scraps Album With Stuart Price\n\nIt's been reported that Joy Division/New Order/Bad Lieutenant captain Bernard Sumner has a synth record in the works with British producer/songwriter Stuart Price. Unfortunately, as Sumner reveals to Spinner, that project has been scrapped.\n\n\"I believe you can do anything with enough enthusiasm,\" Sumner says. \"To make a good record, you have to put 100 percent in. And now, you have to make about 16 to 18 songs. In the old days, when I was in Joy Division or New Order, if you did that, it would be a double album.\"\n\nIt's not to say that Sumner and Price haven't worked together before -- the producer, who's worked with Madonna, Diddy and the Killers, also lent his skills on New Order's last effort, 2005's 'Waiting for the Sirens' Call' -- but it's looking like it would be too much work to get enough material out.\n\n\"To do that with Stuart, that would be impossible,\" Sumner says. \"I couldn't make two albums at one time. There's nothing in the pipeline at the moment.\"\n\nAs we've reported before, Sumner is focused on his current project, Bad Lieutenant. After some visa woes kept them from touring the US last fall, the band is in limbo again, as the volcanic ash that's wreaking havoc in the UK forced the cancellation of their flight to San Francisco.\n\nThey're scheduled for a four-date run in the US, starting tomorrow at the Regency Ballroom in the Bay Area before heading to Coachella this weekend. Here's hoping they can finally make it. If they do, what can fans expect? \"We play some New Order and some Joy Division,\" Sumner says. \"It's a bit of a career retrospective. It weaves together really well. We're a great band live. I'm back on the live tip.\"\n\nwww.spinner.ca\n\nFestival Hall dances to new beat\n\nA brave New Order in music is coming to Alderley Edge Festival Hall courtesy of band legend Bernard Sumner and a Hacienda DJ.\n\nAlderley Edge resident Bernard, former guitarist for post-punk Eighties bands Joy Division and New Order, is introducing Club Paradiso, a weekly funk, soul, jazz and R ‘n B night.\n\nClub Paradiso will hit Festival Hall on May 1, and with Hacienda DJ Hewan Clarke as resident DJ, will be a wholly different deal to the swing dances which used to take place there in the 1930s when it was the Regal Ballroom.\n\nThe events - aimed at a sophisticated, affluent crowd of 18 to 30s - is the joint brainchild of Bernard and Alan Wise, former promoter for New Order.\n\nAlan, who runs Wisemoves Concerts, says there will be live music at each event as well as DJs until 1am.\n\nHe said: \"This is a night for people from Wilmslow, Alderley Edge and Macclesfield - a sophisticated crowd. We really hope it takes off, it will be good to make use of this great venue.\"\n\nBernard’s wife Sarah Sumner, of Nether Alderley, will meet and greet people on the door.\n\nShe said: \"Bernard wanted to organise something in Alderley Edge. It’s going to be great, it’s time we had something like this here, somewhere to go after a meal or a drink in the bars. The crowd will be young but not too young and the DJ is great. Alan is a real character and knows all the right people, so it should be a good show. I’m looking forward to it.\"\n\nThis is good news for the village parish council, which took over the venue last year.\n\nManager Graham Farrand has been tasked with attracting visitors, and is pleased to report an income in the first year of £20,000.\n\nGraham, 63, from Poynton, said: \"It’s a lovely hall which should be used. I remember going there when I was 16 and it was the Ballroom and I’m glad to see dancing and live music return. It’s good for the income at the hall, we need to generate money so we can keep it open for community events.The Club Paradiso launch will take place on Saturday, May 1, from 7.30pm to 1am, featuring 80s top-ten soul band The Christians at 9pm, and run each Friday night after that. Tickets are £15 from 0161 832 1111 or at ticketline.co.uk.\n\nwww.wilmslowexpress.co.uk\n\nCEREMONY A New Order Tribute\n\nTwo Disc Deluxe Package Of New Order\n\nCovers Benefits Children's Charity\n\nIn Memory Of\n\nFactory Records Maestro Tony Wilson\n\n24 Hour Service Station is proud to announce the release of CEREMONY - A New Order Tribute.\n\nThis album is dedicated to Tony Wilson, founder of Factory Records, who died of cancer in 2007, and will be released on February 20th 2010 to celebrate what would have been his 60th Birthday.\n\nA portion of the proceeds from album sales will benefit the Salford Foundation Trust's Tony Wilson Awards , established in his memory.

I was born and bred in Salford and Manchester and I know what vital and life-saving work is done every day for cancer patients at The Christie.\n\n“I will be running for all cancer patients, especially my dear friends the late Tony Wilson and Dave Dee. I hope everyone signs up to run in support of The Christie, a world leading cancer centre right here in Manchester.\n\n“I had the time of my life when I ran last year. I thought I'd done everything, but the depth of love, hope and support shown on the day left me breathless. It was a great day for great people for a great cause, and very important to all of us.”\n\nSalford-born actress Rebecca who plays Jockey landlady Karen Maguire in Shameless, said; “After all the Christmas parties and New Year’s celebrations, taking part in this run for The Christie will be the perfect motivator to get back into fitness again! I’ve done a lot of work with The Christie and it is very close to my heart. I feel extremely passionate about supporting the charity in anyway I can.”\n\nOther celebrities who have also signed up to run for The Christie include Rebecca’s Shameless co-stars Ben Batt, from Wigan, and Ciaran Griffiths and Coronation Street’s Ryan Thomas who plays Jason Grimshaw and Katy Cavanagh, who plays Julie Carp.\n\nHead of sporting events at the Christie charity, Jenny Haskey, said; “Registration for the run is now open, but places do go quickly so do act now to avoid disappointment. Visit www.greatrun.org and we’d be delighted if you choose The Christie as your chosen charity. All the money raised will help cancer patients now and in the future.”\n\nThe Christie is currently building a new £17 million radiotherapy centre at Salford Royal, where cancer patients from Salford, Wigan and Bolton will be able to access first class radiotherapy treatments from Christie experts, but much closer to home. Building work has started and the centre will open in 2011.\n\nAs well as treating patients for the most common cancers like breast, bowel and lung, this special development will also be a national centre of excellence for treating brain conditions. It will be equipped to deliver stereotactic radiosurgery, a highly specialised neurosurgical technique for brain cancers – making it one of only a handful of such centres in the UK.

Club promoters The Warehouse Project recently put on events there but highlighted issues which Hook and his team have addressed.\n\n\"They had a lot of problems with the noise so we've been working quite hard with Ben Kelly to put right those problems,\" he said. \"It was on its own at one point and now it's surrounded by flats and a hotel.\n\n\"It's amazing how Manchester's changed over the years,\" he added.\n\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8456786.stm\n\nFormer Factory Records offices to reopen as a club\n\nThe former offices of legendary Manchester record label Factory Records are set to reopen as a club.\n\nCalled FAC251, the club will be located on Princess Street in the UK city. Its opening night is set to be February 5.\n\nNew Order's Peter Hook is behind the new venture, along with Factory designer Ben Kelly and speaker manufacturers Funktion One.\n\nAccording to Factorymanchester.com, FAC251 will host live bands and be predominantly an \"indie rock & roll club\".\n\nwww.nme.com\n\nRoyal Mail put New Order album cover on a stamp\n\nNew Order bassist Peter Hook says he is \"very happy\" that the artwork from the band's Power, Corruption & Lies album is being put on a stamp.\n\nThe cover joins Blur's Parklife and Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells as one of ten covers on a new set of stamps.\n\nThe artwork, which features a bunch of scattered roses, was created by designer Peter Saville.\n\nHe's one of two local artists featured, as Ray Lowry's cover for The Clash's London Calling is also included.\n\nPeter Hook told BBC Radio 4's Front Row that he was honoured by the accolade and didn't mind having the Queen's head on the cover of one of his albums at all.\n\n\"I suppose it's one of those funny things that when we were younger and we were punks, we would have fought against with all our might.\n\n\"But then as you get older and you realise the significance of something as important as a stamp, it's quite a humbling thing to be put in that category and I'm very happy about it.\"\n\n\"The thing that made me happiest is when the young lady at the Royal Mail was telling me that everything had to go before the Queen to be okayed.\n\n\"I thought that was the nearest I'll ever get to the Queen, so it was definitely a very humbling thing as a musician.\"\n\nThe special stamps celebrate the work of the album sleeve designer, rather than the music, and were chosen after the Royal Mail did extensive research into the UK's greatest album covers, trawling lists and polls and speaking to experts in both music and design.\n\nPeter Saville, who now works as Creative Director of the city of Manchester, says it is a long overdue honour and proof of how important the covers have been to popular culture.\n\n\"It's not before time, not for me personally, but for pop culture in general.\n\n\"The New Order one is from 27 years ago, Tubular Bells is definitely a few years prior to that, the David Bowie cover, Ziggy Stardust, was terribly important to me as a teenager\n\n\"We're covering 40 years or more of contemporary British culture, so it's quite fitting really.\"\n\n\"It's crucial to point out that in the 60s and 70s and into the 80s, the record cover was almost the sole medium of any kind of alternative visual culture for young people.\n\n\"There were not style magazines, there was not the Internet, there was not even MTV until the mid-80s.\n\n\"The record cover was the only place where you would experience any kind of visual culture that was different to the world that you were living in.\"\n\nPeter Hook agrees that the record cover in general has been very important, but admits that had he had his way, the New Order album would have looked very different.\n\n\"I hate to say that I found it much too subtle at the time.\n\n\"As a burgeoning young musician full of spite, I thought it was very subtle and if it had been left to me at the point that we did the sleeve, it would have been much less interesting.\"\n\nThe Power, Corruption & Lies stamp, along with the other nine album cover stamps, is available from Thursday 7 January.\n\nRoyalmail.com\n\nTHE OTHER TWO\n\nArtist: THE OTHER TWO\n\nTitle: “The Other Two & You”\n\nCat No: LTMCD 2551 (16 tracks)\n\nReleased: 25 January 2010\n\nBarcode: 502 4545 5788 29\n\nLTM presents an expanded CD edition of the debut album by The Other Two, the electronic pop duo comprising Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert of New Order.\n\nThe Other Two came into being in 1990, spurred by Morris and Gilbert’s work on television soundtracks, and a temporary lull in New Order activity in which Electronic and Revenge also released albums.
