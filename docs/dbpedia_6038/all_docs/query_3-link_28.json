Pop\n\nTypical Top 40 stuff you hear on the radio. Can also include 80's New Wave.\n\nExamples: Madonna, Britney Spears, Aqua, New Order, Tears For Fears, Duran Duran.\n\n2.) Hip-Hop\n\nAnything old school rap, modern rap, or even gangsta rap.\n\nExamples: LL Cool J, Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Eminem, Run DMC, The Sugarhill Gang.\n\n3.) Rock\n\nAll types of rock music including classical rock, modern rock, grunge, hard rock, alternative rock.\n\nDepending on how broad you want to make it, one can even include country western and bluegrass, since in a way, they are somewhat really soft rock.\n\nExamples: Van Halen, Bon Jovi, Poison, Seven Mary Three, Soundgarden, Nirvana, Alice in Chains, The Scorpions, Rush, Ben Folds Five,\n\n4.) R&B\n\nPretty standard typical Motown or soul music that isn't hip-hop or jazz.\n\nExamples: Barry White, Mary J. Blige, Alicia Keys, Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, R. Kelly\n\n5.) Jazz\n\nPretty much self-explanatory.\n\nExamples: Louis Armstrong, Cassandra Wilson, Robert Coltrane.\n\n6.) Latin\n\nAny Latin artists. Also includes salsa, cumbia, and ranchera music.\n\nExamples: Shakira, Alejandra Guzman, Julio Iglesias, Enrique Iglesias, Alicia Villareal.\n\n7.) Metal\n\nAny metal, including heavy metal, speed metal, death metal, thrash metal, etc.\n\nExamples: Metallica, Megadeth, Motorhead, Slayer, Iron Maiden, Pantera\n\n8.) Electronica\n\nAnything that is mostly DJ made on electronic equipment. Includes Techno, Trance, EuroDance, Goa.\n\nExamples: Astral Projection, Ministry of Sound, Moby. Also all those DJ continuous mix albums, like Armin Van Buuren's \"A State of Trance\" weekly series.\n\n9.) Classical\n\nAnything regarding the music of the classical composers.\n\nExamples: Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, Handel, Tchaikovsky, Chopin.\n\n10.) World\n\nRythmic beats of various non-American culture\n\nExamples: Brazilian Samba, African Tribal, Reggae, World Fusion, Turkish Dance.\n\n11.) Other\n\nAnything that can't be broadly applied to the above.\n\nExamples: New Age, Speech, Language Learning\n\nIf you could classify music into ten or fewer genres...\n\nReply #10 – 2009-08-13 01:56:16\n\nI would use 2. For popular I tend to think in terms of era's (eg 60's, 70's etc) more than genres.\n\n1. Popular\n\n2. Classical\n\nIf you could classify music into ten or fewer genres...\n\nReply #11 – 2009-09-19 06:26:03\n\nHmm,\n\nAcoustic\n\nElectronic\n\nMixture\n\nthat's 3, but now it's almost like we're not even talking about genres anymore.\n\nSignature\n\nIf you could classify music into ten or fewer genres...\n\nReply #12 – 2009-09-27 09:12:47\n\nIt really varies from person to person based on what they listen to. For example, I’d tag most of what pawelq listens to as “classical” and he might tag most of what I listen to as “pop”.\n\nIf you could classify music into ten or fewer genres...\n\nReply #13 – 2009-10-08 08:37:02\n\nTwo Genres:\n\n1. Commercial garbage\n\n2. The Real Stuff\n\nLOL\n\nOn a more serious note, here is my classification:\n\n1. Rock\n\n2. Hip-hop/Rap/Reggae\n\n3. Jazz\n\n4. Electro\n\n5. Ethnic\n\n6. Classical\n\nThis I think is the most general classification of music. Then, say we want to enter sub-genres, the list in never ending. Rock has Experiment, Hard Rock etc etc, Electronic has Fusion, down tempo etc etc.\n\nIf you could classify music into ten or fewer genres...\n\nReply #14 – 2009-10-08 11:52:01\n\nI am trying to classify all my music into quite broad genres. If you could only have ten or less categories for your music what would they be?\n\nFor what purpose? I split my catalogue into two -- classical music and the rest. The reason is not that Merzbow has more in common with Malmsteen than with Mahler, but that classical music is largely released on a \"by composer\" basis, and everything else in my collection largely by performer. (Adaptations: Tribute albums -- \"all these amateurs cover your favourite band in order to cash-in on their name\" -- are treated as if the original were the performer, though. Contemporary composers ... let's say I don't have much doubts on neither Ligeti nor Zappa.)\n\nAnd foobar2k admits multiple installs, each with its own library. If I had audio books, I would keep them in a third library.\n\nThen I also split the \"everything else\" catalogue into \"various artist\" and \"everything else\" in my directory structure, but not in my foobar music library.\n\nMusic playlists I use for testing lossless encoding (CDDA): https://hydrogenaud.io/index.php/topic,122960.0.html\n\nIf you could classify music into ten or fewer genres...\n\nReply #15 – 2009-10-08 22:44:52\n\nChange \"Electro\" for the full \"Electronic\", because \"electro\" isn't a genre; it's a buzzword. Add \"Metal\", because (heavy) metal isn't rock. Reggae isn't hip-hop at all.\n\nIf you could classify music into ten or fewer genres...\n\nReply #16 – 2009-10-15 02:45:16\n\nI use only 9 genres in my library. Although, there are many types of music I don't listen to so that doesn't cover everything.

So does Aphex Twin. So does Techno music. So does Disco music. So does DJ music.\n\nFo me, the \"modern classical\" composer Stockhausen also goes in here. So does Terry Riley. So does Brian Eno.\n\nI prefer to place the artists Alvin Lucier and John Cage in \"..\\Project\\Performance Art\\\" (see below).\n\nI define sub-classes for the Electro genre so that I can relate the artist to other genres and styles and music player library search purposes:\n\nFor example, for Stockhausen, the audio file <GENRE> TAG would look something like: Electro > Composed; Modern Composition; Modern Classical; Avant-Garde; Experimental\n\nJazz is what it is; a harmonic. melodic, rhythmic, skillful and improvisational tour-de-force by \"intelligent\" musicians\n\nPopular is any artist or group who has transcended their own musical and cultural boundaries to another level of consciousness.\n\nMany of the artists I place here are based on my own subjective opinions.\n\nI place The Beatles in here (and not in the Rock genre class).\n\nProject is a very broad 'umbrella' class which -for me- mops up many loose threads.\n\nI find it difficult to justify having a separate Genre class for many things such as Film Soundtracks, Game Music, Video Productions, Audiophile Samplers, etc.\n\nTherefore I place all these things into a parent class named \"Project\".\n\nand if we were to look inside my filesystem folder named \"..\\Project\\\", we would find these sub-folders:\n\n..\\Project\\Audiophile\\\n\n..\\Project\\Audio Tech\\\n\n..\\Project\\Computer Scene\\\n\n..\\Project\\Film\\\n\n..\\Project\\National Anthem\\\n\n..\\Project\\Nature Sound\\\n\n..\\Project\\Performance Art\\\n\n..\\Project\\Theatre\\\n\nRhythm is a class I could define exactly like the \"Jazz\" class (see above),\n\nexcept it has a looser reliance on the word \"intelligent\" and emphasizes concepts such as \"feel\" and \"groove\" and \"culture\".\n\nTypes of music I place here are \"Reggae\", \"Ska\", \"R&B\", \"Blues\", \"Soul\", \"Funk\", \"Rap\", etc\n\nRock is a class which does not really need to be defined.\n\nMusicians in this class like using electric and loud instruments like Bass, Guitars, Drums, Keyboards (and mixing desks).\n\nThe musicians in this class also like to conceptualize and create \"labels\" and \"images\" for themselves and their output.\n\nWorld is music and sounds which define a cultural identity on planet earth different to what I am usually exposed to.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThat's it for me; the world of audio is reduced to 8 (eight) genre classes, with hair-splitting differences being done in\n\nthe <GENRE> tag of the audio player. Thank God foobar2000 exists, with its ability to split TAG values +++++\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you could classify music into ten or fewer genres...\n\nReply #19 – 2012-07-17 23:41:47\n\nHmmm...\n\nExamine your lists - how would you classify \"Sumer is icumen in\"\n\n\"The water is wide\" (also known as \"There is a ship\" or \"Waly waly\" or \"Jamie Douglas\")\n\n\"Scarborough Fair\"/\"The Elfin Knight\"\n\n\"The times they are a-changin'\"\n\n\"Silent Night\"\n\n\"Happy birthday\"\n\n\"Three blind mice\"\n\n??\n\nCheers,\n\nAlan\n\nIf you could classify music into ten or fewer genres...\n\nReply #20 – 2012-07-18 00:42:40\n\nalanofoz, are you talking to me?\n\nIs your post meant to come across to other readers as sarcastic drivel, or are you trying to elaborate on something or other?\n\nIf this is sarcasm. . .why ?\n\nIf this is not sarcasm. . .then elaborate on your topic so people can get a proper handle on it.\n\nYou have listed 8 tracks and you think they are virtually impossible to classify; is that correct?\n\nInstead of just posing a tricky terse question to the readers, why don't you be the first person\n\nto attempt putting a \"genre\" label against each item in the list, and let's see if we agree.\n\nIf I was to attempt a serious answer at your Post #20. . .\n\nWhat exactly is \"Sumer is icumen in\" ?

Rather than to barge in with an unsolicited survey, alanofoz might instead have attempted to be more constructive by asking what you would do with songs of this broad class, which I would label ‘traditional’ or something similar. But, as it is, we have very little to work with.\n\nBack on topic, I suppose my ten genres would be something like this:\n\n• rock\n\n• soundtrack—possibly including (and, in that case, comprising mostly) games, although I might be tempted to reclaim one of the lower-priority slots with Game\n\n• electronic (not including games, e.g. Mega Drive)\n\n• classical\n\n• pop (with much deliberation over artists such as The Beatles, as derty2 already mentioned!)\n\n—and now five that wouldn’t get much use—\n\n• jazz\n\n• hip-hop (note: gangsta rap can take a running jump right off a cliff)\n\n• R&B (assuming this can refer to worthwhile stuff, rather than the truckloads of crap that fills the chart nowadays), possibly incorporating soul (is that permissible?)\n\n• folk, possibly incorporating country (if I ever had any of the latter!)\n\n• and finally, the magical solver-of-all-problems: other\n\nIf you could classify music into ten or fewer genres...\n\nReply #22 – 2012-07-20 00:26:54\n\nalanofoz, are you talking to me?\n\nNot to anyone in particular.\n\nIs your post meant to come across to other readers as sarcastic drivel, or are you trying to elaborate on something or other?\n\nIf this is sarcasm. . .why ?\n\nIf this is not sarcasm. . .then elaborate on your topic so people can get a proper handle on it.\n\nYou have listed 8 tracks and you think they are virtually impossible to classify; is that correct?\n\nInstead of just posing a tricky terse question to the readers, why don't you be the first person\n\nto attempt putting a \"genre\" label against each item in the list, and let's see if we agree.\n\nIf I was to attempt a serious answer at your Post #20. . .\n\nWhat exactly is \"Sumer is icumen in\" ?

Sorry it struck you that way.\n\nI'm merely trying to illustrate that there are songs that don't seem to fit easily into any category mentioned so far.\n\nSumer is icumen in is the oldest known song in the English language, you actually may find it rewarding to Google. Perhaps Mediaeval/Renaissance might be a category?? Or Traditional Folk Music. Both categories notable by their absence I think. (I included a couple of well-known examples of Trad Folk.)\n\nNot sure where to place Dylan.\n\nI included Silent Night because I didn't see Sacred Music or similar in any list. Or Christmas Carols?\n\nI also wondered whether Nursery Rhymes rates as a category, and I'm still not sure what to do with Happy Birthday.\n\nI was trying to be thought provoking in a light-hearted manner, not trying to provoke anything else.\n\nCheers,\n\nAlan\n\nIf you could classify music into ten or fewer genres...\n\nReply #23 – 2012-07-21 16:31:19\n\nI'm iterate when it comes to music history. Just a warning\n\nMy attempt:\n\n1) Classical\n\n2) Opera\n\n3) Acoustic Guitar (other instruments allowed, but main thrust)\n\n4) Jazz\n\n5) Rock\n\n6) Rap (probably should include most hip hop)\n\n7) Polka\n\nDrum\n\n9) Acoustic Piano\n\n10) Christian Gangsta Rap\n\nOK - I don't think 10 is really enough, and with a limited number, why did I waste one on Christian Gangsta Rap?
