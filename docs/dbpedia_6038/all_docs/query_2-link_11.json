        "text": "This is a genre that I was never really into much and never really explored much but these days I find myself a bit curious about it. I really enjoy certain albums by the Cars. I also like the Police and other bands from this era. I also had an album by Duran Duran and a Flock of seagulls but that's about it. However, a lot of it at the time seemed to be more poppy or dancey and not really my thing. So what I'm interested in is finding out about albums that are on a bit more of the rock side and less poppy(like those I mentioned). I also really liked Missing Persons for that reason but never owned anything by them. So I'm looking for some recommendations but they don't have to be super heavy just not poppy sounding like the Thompson Twins or something. Also, if there are any post 80's bands that are in this general style or influenced by them that are good you can mention them as well.\n\n\"New Wave\" was not really a genre. It was an umbrella differentiator for anything that wasn't mainstream arena rock.\n\nI have one album by Devo(Q: Are we not men)and two by Pere Ubu(the modern dance and terminal tower(a comp). However, I don't really consider Pere Ubu to be new wave(still good though). The Residents I have heard a lot about and am interested but from what I understand they are more experimental(which ok by me actually). Nonetheless which album do you recommend as a good one to start with by them?Wire I've heard about too.\n\nWell, they were part of a greater neo -rockabilly scene that was happening in Japan, the US and Europe. And since they were successful in the UK before the US, they were most definitely promoted as new wave in the US."
