He formed Freebass with fellow bassists Gary “Mani” Mounfield (the Stone Roses) and Andy Rourke (the Smiths), but they broke up before their 2010 debut album hit the shelves.\n\nThat’s when Hook formed yet another group, Peter Hook and the Light, with his son Jack. Hook’s goal? “I set out to do something — God willing, the grim reaper willing — and I will be fulfilling my dream of playing every song written and recorded by Joy Division and New Order,” he said during a recent phone interview from his home in Manchester.\n\nHook has since spent the decade on the road, playing two albums in full on each tour: Joy Division’s “Unknown Pleasure” and “Closer”; New Order’s “Movement” and “Power, Corruption and Lies”; and “Low-Life” and “Brotherhood.”\n\nIn 2016, Hook tackled “Substance,” the name of compilations from both Joy Division and New Order. The former collects the group’s singles and B-sides, while the latter includes extended remixes of New Order’s first seven years of singles. Released in 1987, New Order’s “Substance” remains the band’s best-selling album in the U.S. and served as an entry point to the group for a generation of fans.\n\nThe U.S. “Substance” tour, which hit Minneapolis’ First Avenue in October 2016, did so well that promoters asked for an encore. So before Hook debuts New Order’s “Technique” and “Republic” this fall in England, he’s back in the States with a return trip to First Avenue tonight.\n\nHere’s what else the 62-year-old had to share about his music, his career and his future.\n\nOn how he developed his distinctive style of playing:\n\n“What happened was, I started to play lead lines because my equipment was so poor. I couldn’t hear myself if I played low. Ian Curtis loved it, and it enabled Barney (singer/guitarist Bernard Sumner) to play lead the way he did.”\n\nOn the decision to perform his band’s albums in full:\n\n“It began with the 30th anniversary of Ian Curtis’ death. I wanted to celebrate him. I had no contact with Barney and (drummer Stephen Morris) at that point. We had finished on a particularly bad note. And then they went behind my back and everybody knows what happened with that regard. (New Order hired bassist Tom Chapman to replace Hook.)\n\n“We were not trying to pretend to be Joy Division. I wanted to find a way to celebrate Curtis without being a pale imitation. And when we played the albums, they sounded completely different live. We were much faster, much edgier.”\n\nOn whether he heard “Music Complete,” the 2015 album New Order recorded with Chapman:\n\n“Yeah, I did. Bernard is a particularly talented songwriter, but it sounded a bit more like his solo work rather than the magic of New Order.”\n\nOn what it’s like to hear Chapman playing his signature bass lines:\n\n“That geezer doesn’t play like me. I’ve listened to him, he doesn’t play my lines — successfully, I’d say. I’m glad that I get to play them correctly, just how I wrote them. (Chapman) doesn’t really bother me, but if I wasn’t performing with the Light, it would bother me a hell of a lot more. You can listen to us both and judge accordingly.”\n\nOn playing the “Substance” albums live:\n\n“There’s a huge contrast between the two, which is nice. The Joy Division one has much lesser-known tracks, but it goes down just as well if not better. New Order’s music is quite challenging and I don’t get the option to drop the difficult tracks. I have to play them all. But it’s very rewarding and I’m glad that we are so different than the current incarnation of my old group.”\n\nOn the possibility of new solo music:\n\n“As I get older, I do struggle with the whole concept of working for nothing. Pottsy (Monaco’s David Potts) and I have talked repeatedly about doing another Monaco record. I do feel guilty in that regard, I suppose. (New Order’s original record label boss) Tony Wilson always used to say your best single you’re ever going to write is your next one.”\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWhat: Peter Hook and the Light with DJ Jake Rudh\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. Monday\n\nWhere: First Avenue, 701 First Ave. N., Minneapolis\n\nTickets and info: $25; 612-332-1775 or first-avenue.com\n\nOriginally Published: May 5, 2018 at 4:41 p.m."
