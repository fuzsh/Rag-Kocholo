        "text": "Just got and listened to Seventeen Seconds. I probably liked it even more than Boys Don't Cry. Really fantastic album\n\nCrocodiles is such a good album. Hadn't heard any of Echo's albums other than Ocean Rain before this. Looking forward to Heaven up Here\n\nI checked out Murmur and thought it was impressive. I enjoyed it much more than Green which was the only previous REM record I had heard\n\nMy initial impression of Script of the Bridge was very positive. I feel like it may take a couple listens to fully appreciate the album though\n\nI wasn't the biggest fan of Siouxsie & the Banshees when I heard them a few months ago. I'll check out Juju when I get a chance\n\nI'm curious if you have a preference between Unknown Pleasure and Closer. They're both probably in my top 10 or so with Closer having the slight edge\n\n\"Murmur\" is my favorite album ever, with the darker \"Fables of the Reconstruction\" close behind.\n\nI've always preferred \"Closer\" to \"Unknown Pleasure\", although the gap has narrowed for me over the last couple years. Both are fantastic. If you haven't heard New Order's \"Movement\", you should check it out. It has a lot of the same feel to it as \"Unknown Pleasures\" and \"Closer\".\n\nA more recent band to check out is \"DIIV\". Their debut album \"Oshin\" is probably my favorite album of 2012. They certainly have a big Cure influence to them. I get sick of music really fast but this is one I never seem to get tired of.\n\nI feel like this forum needs a post punk discussion thread. I recently began getting into the genre (sparked by my interest in Talking Heads) and have found a vast amount of amazing music (Gang of Four, Joy Division, The Psychedelic Furs etc.) I'd be interested to hear from others about your favorite post punk/ new wave bands or albums. Post punk and new wave as genres are defined by their diversity so I don't want this thread to be too restrictive; If you have something that maybe wouldn't be strictly defined as post punk/ new wave but has some of those influences i'd love to hear about it.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with post punk and want to see (hear) what it's all about, a few albums I would strongly recommend are:\n\nUnknown Pleasures - Joy division\n\nEntertainment! - Gang of Four\n\nTalking Heads 77 - Talking Heads\n\nPink Flag - Wire\n\nMarquee Moon - Television\n\nReal Life - Magazine\n\nWaiting for a Miracle - Comsat Angels\n\nPsychedelic Furs - Psychedelic Furs\n\nTurn on the Bright Lights - Interpol\n\nHead over Heals - Cocteau Twins\n\nEach of these albums bring a something a little different to the table but all are great albums in my opinion.\n\nSo what are some of your favorites?\n\nLong time lurker on these forums, but after seeing this list I couldn't help but want to chime in. This is a great list of recommendations (particularly for the inclusion of Comsat Angels who are too often overlooked), and I have a few additional suggestions:\n\nJeopardy - The Sound (see in particular the track 'missiles')\n\nPlaying with a different sex - The Au Pairs (including the wonderful Bowie cover 'repetition')\n\nDeceit - This Heat\n\nLong time lurker on these forums, but after seeing this list I couldn't help but want to chime in.

Dark and eerie with such a simple, powerful chorus. Really makes you think.\n\nPlaying With a Different Sex: I actually have the remaster of this album but from just listening to the first song I could tell two things. 1 is that this was clearly going to be a very good album. 2 is that this album underwent significant compression during the remastering process. Checking on the dynamic range database ( http://dr.loudness-war.info ) confirmed my second point so I have since held off listening to that album, waiting to get a copy of the original CD instead. Unfortunately these are rare and expensive so I am currently just keeping my eye out for a copy at a decent price.\n\nThe same situation as above sort of played out for me with This Heat as well. The original CDs can be pretty pricey. I recently was able to get a copy of This Heat but I have not yet acquired Deceit. I have only listened through it once so far (I like to put a decent amount of space in between each listening of an album so that it stays fresh) but I know that it is a special album. When I put it on, I felt like Dorothy having been plucked out of my familiar world and being dropped into a completely new and foreign one where anything is possible. It almost seemed like This Heat had some special powers that allowed them to transcend the Laws of Music, as if the same laws of physics that applies to everybody else simply didn't exist for them. Obviously I'm being quite profuse with my praise and further listening may change my opinion somewhat but listening to that album was one of the greatest musical experiences of my life. Like being at the top of the mountain so to speak. Obviously music is a very personal and subjective experience so I wouldn't expect others to necessarily feel the same. What's crazy is that, from what I understand, most people prefer Deceit to This Heat. Hopefully I'll be able to get a copy sometime soonish (luckily I have plenty of great albums to keep me occupied until then)\n\nJeopardy is a very good album and Missiles is such an interesting song to me.

Personally, I was very musically immature the first time I listened to Deceit, so my initial response was \"What the hell is this?\".... as was my second, third, fourth, fifth, etc. response. After listening to it almost non-stop for a period of days it occurred to me that it was simply music that was so good it was beyond my comprehension. I was actually lucky enough to pick up the 'Out of Cold Storage' boxed set when it came out, which is a fairly definitive collection of their works. It looks like people are selling it on the Amazon Marketplace for as low as ~$70 - well worth it for 3 albums and an EP. I'm not exactly an audiophile (hence why I usually lurk) but it sure sounded better to me than what I'd been listening to before.\n\nAlso one thing I love about a lot of these post punk bands (in particular The Sound, Comsats, Joy Division) is how probing a lot of the music can be while actually coming from a very mundane place. For example, I really think quite a few of the more colorful songs from The Sound are really little more than Adrian Borland using music to describe his mental illness. Likewise, I'm fairly sure 'Interzone' by Joy Division is a fairly literal account of walking around Macclesfield."
