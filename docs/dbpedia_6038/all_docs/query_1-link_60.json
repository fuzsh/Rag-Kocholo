        "text": "Today we unveil the results of Round 5 of our Slicing Up Eyeballs readers’ poll series, a ranking of all 157 songs released by electronic-rock pioneers New Order, from their emergence in 1981 from the ashes of Joy Division up through the current post-Peter Hook era.\n\nA little refresher: We asked readers to vote for up to 25 of their favorite songs recorded by New Order, choosing from a ballot that listed 157 singles, album tracks, compilation cuts and cover songs. We didn’t include live versions or most remixes, though we did allow voting on songs that were essentially mixes but carried distinct titles (“The Beach” and “Kiss of Death,” for example).\n\nRELATED: Playlist of all 157 of New Order’s songs, ranked — minus 46 that aren’t on Spotify\n\nBased on a total of about 50,000 votes, the full results are presented below. As you can see, the No. 1 selection — fittingly, a composition that was both one of the last Joy Division songs and one of the first New Order tracks — topped the list by nearly 100 votes. Songs No. 2 and 3 were much closer together.\n\nPREVIOUS POLLS: Best of The Cure | Best of The Smiths | Best of R.E.M. | Best of Depeche Mode\n\nAs always, thank you all so much for participating.\n\nAnd now, the results:\n\nTHE ABSOLUTE BEST OF NEW ORDER: ALL 157 SONGS, RANKED\n\n1. “Ceremony”\n\nNon-album single (1981) | 1,946 votes\n\n2. “Bizarre Love Triangle”\n\nSingle;
