        "text": "New Wave Music\n\n80s New Wave Music was formed from the remnants of 70s punk rock. 80s New Wave took the aggressive nature of punk, added dance beats to give it a little disco feel, and then through in some keyboards to give it the distinctive 80s New Wave sound. The main years of 80s New Wave were 1980-1984. After 1984, Madonna, Michael, Prince, Bruce and others really took music away from New Wave and more towards a Pop Rock feel. Below we will look at some of the bands that brought 80s New Wave to the top of the charts in the early 80s.\n\n1980\n\nIn the US, 70s bands like Blondie, The Cars, Talking Heads, and Devo were some of the early pioneers of 80s New Wave Music. In the UK, Joy Division, Joe Jackson, The Police, and The Boomtown Rats were some early adopters of the New Wave sound. The album that really defined New Wave's signature synth based sound and brought the movement to the forefront had to be Gary Numan's The Pleasure Principle. And the signature song off that album was, of course, Cars. Other top 80s New Wave Songs from 1980 included:\n\nTurning Japanese - The Vapors\n\nWhip It - Devo\n\nDon't Stand So Close To Me - The Police\n\nLove Will Tear Us Apart - Joy Division\n\nEnola Gay - OMD\n\nCall Me - Blondie\n\n1981\n\nMTV's arrival in 1981 took 80s New Wave Music to new heights. MTV aggressively played 80s New Wave bands and their videos. New Wave was the primary genre played on MTV through the year 1984. The majority of the early New Wave bands played by MTV were from Great Britain. This caused journalists to label this period as the \"Second British Invasion\".\n\nTop 80s New Wave Songs From 1981 included:\n\nTainted Love - Softcell\n\nDon't You Want Me - Human League\n\nOnce In a Lifetime - Talking Heads\n\nGirls on Film - Duran Duran\n\nKids in America - Kim Wilde\n\nOur Lips Are Sealed - Go Go's"
