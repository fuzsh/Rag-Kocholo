        "text": "The 1970’s was a very fruitful time creatively for music in the mainstream and in the subcultures of the US and the UK bringing many genres to light after evolving from past founders of sounds. Ways of which sub genres are formed may vary from time, audience preferences or just the actions of few or many bands that end up changing the course of music. One of the most famous moments of subculture and in the music landscape in general was the punk scene in predominantly the UK during the mid 70’s with bands like The Sex Pistols, The Buzzcocks, The Clash becoming prominent pioneers of influences of the genre. The core Punk sound established in the 70’s is characterized with its harsh fast, unpolished tone of distorted guitars bass and crashing drums, also included is equally loud and combative vocals to match. One major highlight that characterizes pure ‘Punk’ from that era is the political and anarchistic themes in the vocal lyrics at the time which compliment the instrumental’s ‘unsubtlness’. As the movement was going strong it also continually bred new sub genres with slight characteristic changes like Hardcore Punk, Avant-Punk, Horror Punk,’Oi!’ and Skate Punk to name a few, but out of all the sub genres spawned Post Punk is arguably the most musically important to the alternative scene during the late 70’s and early 80’s which also saw the eventual creation and influence of New Wave, Sythpop and other such popular genres.\n\n“Punk’s simple stance of negation, of being against, briefly created unity. But as soon as the question shifted to “What are we actually for?” the movement disintegrated and dispersed. Each strand nurtured its own creation myth of what punk meant and pursed its own vision of the way forward…” -Simon Reynolds, Rip it Up and Start Again\n\nThis series of publications will highlight a hand full of some of my personal favorite albums in the highlighted genre, (in no particular order) primarily to underline the sound and history of the specific genre.\n\n1. Joy Division: Unknown Pleasures (1980)\n\nFirst album in the starter pack I must get out of the way is arguably the definitive post punk album in the entire movement, and It would be criminal not to include it. Inspired by the early mentioned founders of the Punk sound, Joy Division was formed in Slaford England, in 1976 by members Ian Curtis (Vocals), Bernard Sumner (Keyboard & Guitar, Peter Hook (Bass) and Stephen Morris (Drums). After a few EP’s and singles their debut album Unknown Pleasures was released in 1979, with moderate success after their single not featured in the album ‘Transmission’ was released beforehand. What set Unknown Pleasures apart from other punk albums is the conscious use of sonic space, production techniques, effects and qualities that other popular Punk bands at the time did not feel necessary to utilize. The sense of atmosphere the album brings is conveyed in such a unique way that it brings an extremely ‘melancholic’ feel to the featured tracks which really sets this particular sound apart from the rest of the more raw, ragged sounds of common punk titles. This use of extra creative liberties proved as a major inspiration point for other post punk albums at the time and in future and can even be seen in traces of modern alternative music created today with its major cult status.\n\n2. Public Image Ltd: Metal Box (1979)\n\nMetal Box by Public Image Ltd. (PiL) encapsulates the formula and attitudes that came with the Post Punk genre and is considered another definitive specimen of the movement. Pushed buy the move to more creative means of creating music than the ‘then stale’ style that was Punk, Sex Pistols then vocalist John Lydon, known commonly as ‘Johnny Rotten’ alongside Keith Levene (guitarist), Jah Wobble (Bass) and Jim Walker (Drums) formed PiL as an avant-garde esque project to contrast the sound of previous bands like the Sex Pistols. Following their debut album and with the creation of Metal Box, the Post-Punk defining characteristics were put to superb use in each of its 10 tracks. The sound of the album is extremely bass heavy with ear-warming tones being produced alongside stringy/metallic guitar picking and distortion in the mix. Rather than screaming about working class being hard done by, John Lydon instead goes for an hypnotising drone of cryptic lyrics providing Pil with its unique ‘Avant-Punk’ style found in the Post-Punk core feel of the genre also providing a source of inspiration for further influential albums from bands.\n\n3. Magazine: Real Life (1978)\n\nLike many bands who made the creative switch from Punk to Post-Punk, Howard Devoto from the popular Punk group The Buzzcocks formed the group Magazine alongside Barry Adamson (Bass), Bob Dickinson (Keyboard) and Martin Jackson (Drums) in 1977. The bid to make a less stereotypical Punk group to a more experimental sounding band was now becoming the new trend of previous Punk bands, signalling this was the release of their debut album Real Life which has blends of the common Punks characteristics but with some major twists. A more upbeat yet slightly melancholic tone with the prominent role of synthesisers in the tracks is what sets the feel aside from the sound of the Buzzcocks, with some similarities to the before mentioned band Public Image Ltd. During the mid to late 70’s synthesisers were making a impact on genre sounds as they were the cutting edge medium of experimentation in music, alongside the fact they were becoming more portable and commonly available to consumers rather than lugging around large, fragile modular synthesisers.\n\n4. Bauhaus: In The Flat Field (1980)\n\nThe important impact that Post-Punk had on the alternative scenes on music runs deep with the inclusion of such groups and their albums mentioned before and many more with contributing sounds. With enough influence in the creation of new sounds in groups, new genres and waves of subcultures are easily born. With Joy Divisions ‘abyssal dreariness’ taken to the extremes you eventually get a genre derivative known as Gothic-Rock which eventually became the foundation of other derivative genres in the future. Known by many as the pinnacle of pioneers/founders of the Gothic-Rock genre is Bauhaus with members Peter Murphy (Vocals), Daniel Ash (Guitar), Kevin Haskins (Drums) and David J (Bass) leading the charge into the depths of a new experimental sound. Heavily inspired by the darker aspects of Joy Divisions sound, especially Ian Curtis’ ‘impending’ vocal tonality, In The Flat Field which was developed in 1979 and released 1980 was a landmark record with its grim accent with such defining tracks as Dark Entries, A God in an Alcove and their most famous hit although not featured: Bela Lugosi’s Dead. Although this album is considered one of the first Gothic-Rock albums to hit the scene, it is still technically a Post-Punk record with its heavy inspiration from the transitions that came from Punk with some lasting impression heard amongst the tracks within the album.\n\n5. The Cure: Seventeen Seconds (1980)\n\nThe whole Post-Punk genre is seen to be a crossroads point of the music genres emerging in the late 70’s and throughout the 80’s in the alternative scene of music with many genres to emerge such as Gothic-Rock, New Wave, Art-Rock, and elements in Synthpop. The Cure with the frontman Robert Smith (Vocals, Guitar) is an example of a band with its inception belonging o the crossroads of change who’s albums throughout the 80’s shifting in tonal style with successful adaptation to new directions of sound. Following their debut album Three Imaginary Boys/Boys Don’t Cry, Seventeen Seconds followed after the wake of the Post-Punk phenomenon with the inclusion of darker more atmospheric compositions with the inclusion of effects on guitars, drums and the inclusion of synthesisers. What makes Seventeen Seconds an especially unique album is the multiple branches of genre influences which lets this record be perceived as an influence to New Wave, Post-Punk, Gothic-Rock and Art-Rock. As future The Cure Albums headed towards the Gothic-Rock genre, there was a another shift to a more pop focussed sound following their 1982 album Pornography and throughout the 80’s the sounds of the band were evolving further even sometimes going back to their roots and origin which I believe encapsulates the spirit of the Post-Punk creative process.\n\nResources Used:\n\nImage: Michael Zollner, Date Accessed: 10/6/2018\n\nSimon Reynolds, (2005) Rip it Up and Start Again, Faber and Faber, Date Accessed: 10/6/2018\n\nUnknown Pleasures, Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_Pleasures, Date Accessed: 10/6/2018\n\nSeventeen Seconds, Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_Seconds, Date Accessed: 13/6/2018\n\nMetal Box, Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Box, Date Accessed: 13/6/2018\n\nReal Life, Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Life_(Magazine_album), Date Accessed: 13/6/2018\n\nIn the Flat Field, Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Flat_Field, Date Accessed: 19/6/2018\n\nJoy Division.
