        "text": "Hello everyone, I have had this series of blogs in mind for quite some time. It came out earlier this afternoon that the 2020 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominees will be announced on Tuesday, October 15. Which is 6 days away. So, if I want to get going with this series of blogs I need to start right now!\n\nI am referring to this series as “The Future of the Rock Hall.” Each blog will cover a specific genre of artists and the path towards more representation of said genre that the Rock Hall should go down towards. I ultimately had 12 genres/categories in mind for this blog series, but due to the short deadline I have to get these out, I have stuck with 6 genres, which also happen to be among the most under-represented genres of the Hall and their biggest “areas of opportunity” for more inductions. Each genre/category represents 80’s and 90’s music, areas the Hall is shorter on inductions for as well as areas the Hall will need to and more than likely will be focusing heavier on in the future.\n\nEach entry will cover the next 15 years (2020-2034) and in most cases I am going to highlight 10 artists of a particular genre. Those 10 artists will be divided into two artists for the Hall to focus on over a 3-year period. Basically, I will list two artists for the Hall to focus on for 2020,21, and 22, then 2023,24, and 25, and so on with the series concluding in the year 2034. Hopefully in that 3-year period the two named artists will be inducted and then the Hall can move onto the next two. Each band/artist is listed in the order that I feel the Hall should prioritize for induction. So yes, the lists are 100% biased. This is basically the order that I would induct said artists for a genre. The idea here is to give the Hall a road-map for some of the most under-represented genres and how to best address them over the next 15 years. By the end, 10 artists from each genre will be inducted. Some of the later genres I will be adding more artists to, particularly genres with newly eligible acts that are “obvious immediate inductions.” I will explain those more when the time comes.\n\nWith the announcement that the Hall is announcing the nominees in 6 days, and beings these blogs will address artists the Hall should consider for the 2020 class, I obviously need to get these blogs posted as soon as possible. Needless to say, if I don’t get these blogs posted by Tuesday, well then, the whole exercise will be rather pointless. Luckily, I have everything written out already, so I just have to copy and paste and do some formatting. Thus, I am planning on posting a blog each day. I would also like to give a shout out and thank you to everyone on Twitter, Facebook, and the Future Rock Legends website that gave me feedback on the genres they wanted to see. I ultimately did not pick every genre people wanted covered, but I definitely have plans to do a “Part 2” in this series, though it likely won’t come until next year after the 2020 inductees are announced.\n\nHere is the planned schedule for the genres and their planned postings (obviously schedule is subject to change)….\n\nWednesday, October 9: 1980’s New Wave/Synth-Pop\n\nThursday, October 10: 1980’s Alternative Rock\n\nFriday October 11: Rap\n\nSaturday, October 12: 1990’s Mainstream Alternative Rock\n\nSunday, October 13: Electronic Music\n\nMonday, October 14: Female Pop/R&B Stars\n\nAgain there are more genres I have in mind namely: “Roots of Rock (late 40’s/early 50’s artists), First Decade of Rock N’ Roll (1954-1963), Classic Rock, Classic R&B/Funk, Punk Rock, Metal/Hard Rock, Singers & Songwriters, but I don’t have enough time to cover those beings the nominees will be announced next week. I would like to cover those genres in the future, again most likely after the 2020 inductees are announced. With that said, let’s get started!\n\nWe’re gonna begin our series by covering 1980’s New Wave/Synth-Pop. Many of these bands are considered alternative rock bands or part of the world of alternative music at least. However, to me they are two different styles of rock music that warrant their own blog entries and list of artists to consider. It’s hard for me to compare Depeche Mode and Eurythmics to Sonic Youth and Pixies for example. Thus, this category is going to focus more on groups of the synth-pop genres or more new-wave styled rather than basic alternative rock. How has new wave fared on the Rock Hall? For the late 70’s scene, pretty good. The Hall has inducted Talking Heads, Elvis Costello, the Police, Blondie, and the Cars to name a few. Once we get to the 80’s, however new wave has hit with a dud and like general 80’s alternative rock has not yet really been able to break through. There still appears to be a bias towards the more synth-heavy groups of new wave, whereas guitar-based new wave groups have had better luck. That still hasn’t stopped the Nominating Committee of the HOF from trying though, as they’ve nominated Depeche Mode, Devo, and Eurythmics (along with the Cars who needed 3 nominations to be inducted). So obviously, the Hall is aware that New Wave and synth-pop needs more representation. With the Cure’s induction this past year and the Cars’ induction the previous year, New Wave appears to be on the verge of breaking through, and thus the Hall should continue to focus heavily on the genre and its most important acts. So which new wave/synth-pop acts should be pushed by the Hall first? Glad you asked! Let’s find out. Here would be my preferred timeline and set of artists on how the Hall should best address new wave/synth-pop over the next 15 years.\n\n2020/21/22\n\nDepeche Mode:\n\nOutside of Kraftwerk (who will be brought up in the electronic category instead) is there a greater band of the synth-pop genre than Depeche Mode? While many could make arguments for others, I think it’s pretty much set in stone that Depeche Mode is the greatest synth-pop group of all-time. Thus, the Hall obviously has to start with Depeche Mode, right? Duh. Not only is Depeche Mode the greatest synth-pop group ever, they’re also the group with the best chances for being inducted. Depeche Mode has a cross-over appeal to artists of other genres and voters of different age groups that many other synth-pop groups simply do not have. Thus, in order to “break the ice” on the genre it makes sense for Depeche Mode to be pushed first. As they’re the most likely to break the door down for the other groups. The Hall must start with Depeche Mode first when trying to address the genre of new wave/synth-pop.\n\nDevo:\n\nDevo is one of two bands in this list/blog entry that actually got their start in the late 70’s new wave scene and thus serve as a peer of Blondie, Talking Heads, the Police, etc. rather than the more electronic-based 80’s groups. Even so, Devo was far more electronic based than all of the late 70’s new wave group combined, and thus no band was more important in bridging the worlds of rock music with electronic music. Their sound was tremendously groundbreaking and innovative and their influence on later alternative rock artists and even class-rock acts looking ahead to the future (Neil Young, David Bowie, etc) was quite profound. Outside of Depeche Mode, the Hall really can’t focus on 80’s new wave without getting Devo inducted first.\n\n2023/24/25\n\nNew Order:\n\nNew Order is quite possibly the greatest “dance-rock” group of the 1980’s and thus a massively influential and important band of 1980’s new wave. The group came to be out of the existence of Indie Rock pioneers Joy Division, whose lead singer, Ian Curtis committed suicide in 1980. Thus, the band Joy Division came to an end, and the surviving members formed New Order who at first shared a similar rock-based style of Joy Division, but quickly evolved to incorporate more electronic and disco-based music in their sound. In the process they crafted some of the most important songs in the history of dance music (“Blue Monday, “Bizarre Love Triangle,” “Confusion,” and “True Faith” to name a few) and became influential on post-disco dance music. I kind of consider Depeche Mode and New Order to be the “Beatles and Stones” 80’s synth-pop and dance music, with Depeche Mode being the darker and “synthy” sounding band, and New Order being more rock, and dance orientated. Either way both bands are essential 80’s bands for the HOF. And with Depeche Mode and Devo being inducted, New Order has to be next in line.\n\nEurythmics:\n\nThe duo of Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart brought R&B and soul music to the genre of electronic-based synth-pop and thus they quickly broke through to mainstream success and critical acclaim to a generation of music critics that still didn’t understand electronic music and its purpose. Eurythmics were a group that appealed to older rock and R&B fans but were also innovative and edgy and appealed to younger music fans that loved electronic and new wave music. Their 1983 single, “Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)” is quite possibly the greatest new wave/synth-pop song of all time, it’s magnum opus so to speak. The duo was the total package. Dave Stewart was an amazing songwriter and studio producer who crafted the music, while Annie Lennox provided the soulful vocals and the groundbreaking gender-breaking image that challenged the standards of female beauty. In the process, Annie became one of the most important feminist icons in the history of music. The group were visual innovators with their groundbreaking music videos as well as their playing with gender norms from a visual standpoint (Annie’s shaved orange hairdo and tuxedo attire) and were also groundbreaking sonically. Eurythmics are one of the great groups of the new wave era and their influence and impact is still being felt in popular music today.\n\n2026/27/28\n\nINXS:\n\nOf all the 80’s new wave bands, none were more rock-orientated than INXS. And yet the group certainly brought a new sound and style to rock music. Their incorporation of synthesizers, saxophones, and the Jim Morrison-like vocals of lead singer Michael Hutchence made for a truly unique but accessible sound which of course ensured they would become one of the most successful rock bands of the new wave era. Their 1987 album, Kick was a monster hit spawning tons of hit singles and becoming one of the defining albums of the new wave era. Even into the 1990’s, the group continued to put out some of their best work (“Not Enough Time” is a prime example) that didn’t get quite the mainstream attention it deserved. Michael Hutchence was probably the greatest frontman of the new wave era, and the band has proven to be one of the most important dance-rock bands in history. Their sound and footprints are all over the current dance-orientated indie rock scene. INXS is unquestionably a Hall of Fame level band.\n\nThe B-52’s:\n\nThe B-52’s are another band of the new wave era that truly had a unique sound and image that resonated with different generations of rock fans. The group’s overall sound was heavily inspired by 60’s genres like surf rock and girl groups, while also having the manic energy of punk rock, and the creativity of 70’s art rock. In the process, the group crafted some of the greatest new wave albums of all-time as well as one of the great pop albums of the late 80’s, Cosmic Thing which proved to be one of the most successful albums of any artist in the world of alternative music during the late 1980’s. The group also broke ground by being one of the first groups in popular music where the majority of members identified as being gay, and thus served as role models for gay music fans in an era that was still very homophobic. One of the B-52’s biggest fans was John Lennon, as he was a fan of their first album and in particular, the legendary single, “Rock Lobster.” The group’s work even inspired him to return to making music during the last year of his life. The B-52’s are definitely one of the best bands of the new wave era, and thus deserving of induction.\n\n2029/30/31\n\nDuran Duran:\n\nThe next group to represent new wave in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame should be none other than Duran Duran. Duran Duran grew out of the 70’s glam/art rock scene to become arguably the most popular new wave band of the 1980’s. Duran Duran exploded in popularity thanks to their innovative music videos, memorably catchy singles, and teen idol image. At first the group was dismissed by some critics and more edgier music fans due to their appeal to female music fans as well as young music fans, but the group was undoubtedly one of the most talented groups to emerge in the early 80’s new wave scene. Duran Duran were one of the biggest bands in the world throughout the early 80’s and they played a major part in making MTV a household brand, a part they don’t get near the credit for that they should. However, the group never rested on their laurels as they have continued to expand their sound and style, even enjoying another significant surge in popularity during the early 90’s, they heyday of grunge and gangster rap. The group is one of the key bands in the story of new wave and absolutely belongs in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Go Go’s:\n\nAfter Duran Duran, then we get to one of the most important all-female rock bands in history with the Go Go’s. The Go Go’s became the first all-female band to write and produce a No. 1 album on the Billboard charts and singles such as “We Got the Beat,” “Our Lips are Sealed,” and “Vacation” became defining songs of the new wave era. The group was a major pioneer for female rock musicians and would inspire generations of female musicians to follow. Their career as a band was much too short, however their lead vocalist, Belinda Carlisle would go onto have a majorly successful solo career in the late 80’s. Though the group’s run was short, their legacy is intact and like Duran Duran, they are also a major part of the story of new wave music.\n\n2032/33/34\n\nCyndi Lauper:\n\nCyndi Lauper was one of the biggest solo stars to emerge out of the early 80’s new wave scene. Her debut album, She’s So Unusual, shot her to superstardom, and the album produced iconic singles such as “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun,” “Time After Time,” and “She Bop.” At one-point Cyndi Lauper was so huge that many critics and fans pitted her against Madonna, with the question being who would emerge as the biggest new female pop star. Madonna ultimately won the battle, but Cyndi was an artist that was heralded as the “next big thing,” when she emerged in the 80’s. Cyndi represented a new kind of female star in the mainstream as she had wild looking hairstyles, heavy makeup, and her naturally high-pitched voice generated a unique persona that was unlike any female artist the mainstream had ever seen. Basically, she was the perfect representation of a female new wave artist. Daring, unique, uncompromising, and immensely talented. Like the Go Go’s, her career peak did not enjoy much longevity, but her peak set new standards for female artists to follow and further broke down the conventions of what a female artist in music was supposed to look and act like. Cyndi was a major pioneer whose music still holds up as among the best of the new wave era.\n\nThe Pet Shop Boys:\n\nMy final choice was a tough one to pick, but ultimately, I went with a group that had the most longevity of my final choices, that group being the Pet Shop Boys. The Pet Shop Boys emerged in the mid 80’s and would become the most commercially successful duo in the history of British music. Over their career the group had 42 Top 30 singles, 22 Top 10 singles, and 4 No. 1 singles in the UK. The group also enjoyed success in the US as well, as the group had 5 Top 10 hits on the Billboard charts throughout the mid-to-late 80’s. The group is also among the most successful in the history of the US Dance charts, as they’re currently ranked in fourth only behind Madonna, Janet Jackson, and Donna Summer. Basically, the group was a commercial juggernaut on the pop and dance charts, despite being somewhat underrated in name value and notoriety compared to other legendary new wave groups. The group is also associated with gay culture as Neil Tennant, one of the members of the duo is gay. The group is known as one of the few groups in popular music whose lyrics are “gender-neutral.” The Pet Shop Boys are one of the greatest groups in dance music who absolutely deserve a place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nTo review, here is the final breakdown of how the Hall of Fame should approach new wave/synth-pop music over the next 15 years….\n\n2020/21/22: Depeche Mode/Devo\n\n2023/24/25: New Order/Eurythmics\n\n2026/27/28: INXS/The B-52’s\n\n2029/30/31: Duran Duran/The Go Go’s\n\n2032/33/34: Cyndi Lauper/The Pet Shop Boys\n\nAnd lastly here is a list of other groups I considered, but ultimately didn’t make the final cut….\n\nCurrently Eligible Artists: Adam and the Ants, Culture Club, Gary Numan, Talk Talk, Tears for Fears, The Human League, The Psychedelic Furs\n\nThat will do it for this edition. I hope everyone enjoys the blog series as well as the blog entries to come. For those wondering why I didn’t consider “such and such” please stay tuned to the blog entry tomorrow as some acts thought of as “new wave” I put in the more general 80’s alternative rock category instead. Let me know your thoughts in the comments section."
