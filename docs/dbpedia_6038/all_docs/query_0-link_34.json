        "text": "New Wave City\n\nThe First & Foremost 80s Dance Party Presents...\n\n|“New Order/Joy Division Night”\n\nSaturday, July 15, 2023\n\n——\n\nJoy Division began in Salford in 1976 and are considered one of the pioneering groups of the post-punk movement. Drawing influences from Bowie, Kraftwerk, and Siouxsie and the Banshees, they \"became the first band in the post-punk movement by... emphasizing not anger and energy but mood and expression, pointing ahead to the rise of melancholy alternative music in the '80s.\" Joy Division in turn were a huge influence on The Cure and U2, plus countless bands thereafter.\n\nNew Order rose like a phoenix from the ashes of Joy Division, as Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook and Stephen Morris decided to carry on after the death by suicide of lead singer Ian Curtis. They were joined by Gillian Gilbert on keyboards and became one of the most acclaimed and influential bands of the 1980s.\n\nDance to New Order and Joy Division music and videos, along with the best of New Wave, with DJs Shindog & Low-Life\n\nWIN! Tickets to see Culture Club, Howard Jones, and Berlin live on August 20 at the Concord Pavilion!\n\nFront room: “New Wave B-Sides and Rarities”"
