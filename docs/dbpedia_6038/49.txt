New Order are a new wave / dance music group from Manchester, UK active since 1980. The group was formed from the line-up of Joy Division after their lead singer Ian Curtis committed suicide in May, 1980. The surviving members Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook and Stephen Morris were joined by Gillian Gilbert and issued their debut single Ceremony b/w In A Lonely Place on Factory records in March 1981. Following their debut album Movement, released in November 1981, and several experimental singles mixing new wave guitar and drums with electronic elements, the group eventually achieved mainstream success in March 1983 with their ground-breaking single Blue Monday, released on 12" vinyl format only.

New Order continued their success throughout the 1980s achieving global commercial success, even in the US, while remaining loyal to Factory records and the independent and experimental ethic. Following a no.1 single World in Motion recorded with the Italia 90 England football squad under the name of EnglandNewOrder, the group abandoned Factory, given the label's imminent collapse, and signed to London records. Only one new album, Republic, was released in the 1990s as band members continued to pursue side projects resulting in a practical split, although a reunion live performance at Reading Festival in 1998 meant that a reconciliation and a renewed energy were on the cards.

Two more new albums followed in 2001 and 2005 (the latter featuring new member Phil Cunningham who replaced Gilbert), although after a series of live dates in 2006 bassist Peter Hook effectively left the group which continued to exist despite not issuing any new material.

The group returned to the live scene in 2011 with new bassist Tom Chapman and with Gilbert re-joining the line-up. Music Complete, their first album without Peter Hook, was released in September 2015. Since then the group has continued to play live gigs and festivals worldwide.
