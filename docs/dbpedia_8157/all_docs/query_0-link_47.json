As an Amazon Associate I earn money from qualifying purchases.\n\nPublication Order of Gaius Valerius Verrens Books\n\nThe name Gaius Valerius Verrens refers to a series of historical novels written by Douglas Jackson.\n\n+The Story\n\nDouglas’ initial foray into historical fiction was a story about Emperor Claudius and the elephant he rode at Colchester. While that particular story elicited interest amongst historical enthusiasts, it didn’t hold nearly as much appeal for general readers.\n\nFortunately for Douglas Jackson, he changed tact soon after and launched into the Gaius Valerius Verrens series, a collection of novels set in First Century Rome.\n\nAnd as some people might have guessed from the title, this particular series details the life of one Gaius Valerius Verrens. Unlike so many of the most popular heroes of Roman historical fiction who are centurions, Gaius starts the story of his series as a Tribune.\n\nWhen Douglas Jackson first introduces Gaius to readers, he is just a young soldier doing his duty for the Empire. Though courageous and strong, Gaius’ father has deemed it necessary for him to return home to become a lawyer and, eventually, take his place in the halls of power as a senator. This is despite the fact that Gaius’ abilities are better suited in the field.\n\nHowever, things do not go according to Gaius’ father’s plan, and the young soldier is soon thrust into a conflict against the infamous Boudicca which ultimately transforms him into a famed hero.\n\nThe tale that follows after that is one of blood, glory, and tragedy. Once Gaius is thrust into the limelight, he is unable to return to the life of an unimportant soldier. Instead, Gaius is forced to witness and participate in the many victories and defeats of Rome.\n\nHe watches as Emperors rise and fall. He becomes the sword by which rebellions are quelled and wars are sparked. And in all this, Gaius changes, losing his worldly innocence, learning to understand politics, sharpening his wit and growing to become Rome’s greatest weapon.\n\nIt is worth noting that Gaius Valerius Verrens is a fictional creation, a character crafted from the mind of Douglas Jackson. Douglas uses Gaius as the eyes through which his readers interact with the first century Rome.\n\nBesides Gaius, though, every other story told in this series is historically accurate. Douglas doesn’t deviate from the flow of events as they happened in history. He simply endeavors to write historical figures as real characters, infusing them into historical events and structuring things in such a way that an entertaining tale emerges.\n\nDouglas’ goal isn’t to lecture his readers on Roman History, which is why the Gaius Valerius Verrens series is structured like any other story. However, in refusing to change the events of history portrayed in this series, Douglas is also making certain that his readers learn something about the Roman Era.\n\n+The Author\n\nDouglas Jackson is a Scottish author that was born in 1956 in Jedburgh. For the first few decades of his working life, Douglas was a journalist, and he was a pretty successful one, working at various local and national newspapers.\n\nDouglas always loved history. However, it wasn’t until a friend who was writing a book encouraged him to try his hand at producing a novel that he finally put that passion to good use.\n\nDouglas initially struggled with the idea of writing because he couldn’t think of any subject of note to write about. It wasn’t long before he realized that he would only enjoy the writing process if he chose to delve into something he loved.\n\nAnd anyone who knew Douglas understood that he loved history. Interestingly enough, Douglas’ first idea for a historical novel came to him while he was listening to Simon Schama’s History of Britain while driving.\n\nThere was mention of Emperor Claudius riding triumphantly on an Elephant, and that statement got Douglas thinking about the logistics of that scenario in Roman times.\n\nDouglas Jackson has since become renowned as an author of historical fiction, mentioned in the same vein as writers like Ben Kane.\n\n+Hero of Rome\n\nEmperor Nero’s decision to turn his attention away from Britain encourages rebellion. The Druids are starting to move, whispering in the ears of Britain’s tribe and calling for an uprising. And they don’t have to whisper too loud, either; not with the cruel hand with which Rome has been ruling.\n\nAs the Queen Boudicca prepares to lead an army of angry men against their masters, Gaius Valerius Verrens is all that stands against the horde. A Roman Tribune, Gaius stands ready to lead the Veteran legions at Colonia into the very jaws of death.\n\nThe first book in the Gaius Valerius Verrens series introduces the young Tribune to readers as he holds his ground at Colonia in the face of a wrathful queen. The book explores the standoff at Claudius’ temple.\n\nGaius stands out as a solid soldier, seemingly bred for the life of a legionnaire despite his father’s plans for a career in the Senate. Gaius is honest and honorable, and he never demands of his soldiers what he himself is unwilling to do.\n\n+Defender of Rome\n\nWith the Boudicca campaign over, Gaius Valerius Verrens is hailed as a hero. But the man that returns to Rome bears many physical and emotional scars. Life at home is no better. Not only is Rome descending into confusion but Gaius must deal with his father’s exile and his sister’s illness.\n\nMeanwhile, Nero has turned his paranoia towards the followers of Christus. The sect isn’t particularly convinced of Nero’s divinity and their actions, not mention the dark whisperings of ambitious voices, have led the Emperor to suspect their intentions.\n\nAnd the only person Nero can rely upon in this time of need is the hero of Rome. Gaius is tasked with finding the followers of Christus and rooting out their leader. Gaius cannot afford to fail, for it is more than his life that is hanging in the balance.\n\nThe second book in the Gaius Valerius Verrens series finds the Hero of Rome struggling with a new battle at home. This time, Gaius is inserted into Nero’s conflict with early Christianity.\n\nGaius is placed in a precarious situation when the man he needs to heal his sister turns out to be a Christian, a member of the very sect Gaius has been tasked with destroying."
