        "text": "Hero of Rome\n\nBy (author) Douglas Jackson\n\nThe first book in an action-packed and rigorously researched new Roman historical series by the acclaimed author of Caligula and Claudius The Roman grip on Britain is weakening. Emperor Nero has turned his face away from this far-flung outpost. The Druids are on the rise, spreading seeds of rebellion among the British tribes. Roman cruelty and exploitation has angered their British subjects. The warrior queen Boudicca will lead the tribes to war. Standing against the rising tide of Boudicca’s rebellion is Roman Tribune, Gaius Valerius Verrens, Commander of the veteran legions at Colonia. Valerius leads the veterans in a last stand against the unstoppable horde of Boudicca’s rebel army. Step by step, the bloodied survivors are forced back into the Temple of Claudius. It is here that Valerius wins lifelong fame and the accolade Hero of Rome. Douglas Jackson turned a lifelong fascination for Rome and the Romans into his first two novels, Caligula and Claudius. He was born in Jedburgh, in the Scottish Borders and now lives in Bridge of Allan. Hero of Rome is the first novel in a major new Roman historical action series.\n\nReviews of Hero of Rome\n\n\"If I were Conn Iggulden or Simon Scarrow, I'd be rather worried by the new Scottish kid on the block\" The Scotsman \"A master of his discipline rightly hailed as one of the best historical novelists writing today\" Daily Express \"A splendid piece of storytelling and a vivid recreation of a long-dead-world\" — Allan Massie"
