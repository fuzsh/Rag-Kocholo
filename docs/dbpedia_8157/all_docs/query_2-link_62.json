        "text": "Published by Canelo,\n\n7 March 2024.\n\nISBN: 978-1-80436748-3 (HB)\n\nThis novel is Part 1 of a Warsaw Quartet.\n\nThe story commences with the Nazis march into Warsaw in the Autumn of 1939. Jan Kalisz is an investigator who is drawn into the dangerous role of a double life. He is forced to work with the occupiers and at the same time he is gathering information for the fledgling Polish resistance.\n\nWhile brutalisation of the local population goes hand in hand with increasing difficulties for the Jewish population there is evidence of a psychopathic killer known as the Artist. When the niece of a Wehrmacht general is found murdered and mutilated Jan links the murder to other killings in the town but as these killings of young women are of less interest to the occupying force, he is bound by duty to explore the possibilities of a psychopathic killer.\n\nThe local population do not trust Jan who is posing as a Nazi collaborator and even his family are increasingly suspicious of his motives. The story involves both imagined characters and historical fact and a prominent well known Nazi doctor.\n\nThis is a chilling story clearly well researched in its depiction of Warsaw at the beginning of World War 2 and is not for the faint hearted! Can't wait for Part 2 of this extremely well written and believable detective series.\n\n------\n\nReviewer: Toni Russell\n\nDouglas Jackson is the author of seventeen historical novels and mystery thrillers published by Transworld/PRH, including the critically acclaimed nine-book Hero of Rome series. He was born in Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders and now lives in Stirling. Originally a journalist by profession he rose to become Assistant Editor of The Scotsman before leaving to be a full-time writer in 2009"
