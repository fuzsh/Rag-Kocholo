Most especially to the love of his life and steadfast advocate Ruth Barbour. Being a father to his three children, raised together with Brenda (nee Bissett) were his greatest pride. Jay (Kelsey) Jackson and their children, Kate and Scarlett, Jillian (Kevin) Ellison and their son Hugh, and Brooke (Kevin) Koskie and their children, Jackson, Elan and Eric, and his furry friends, Bart and Brodie were the light in his life.\n\nBorn in Souris to Ruth and Hugh Jackson, he spent his childhood alongside his siblings, Don and Lorraine and what would become lifelong friends from around the town. He attended and received his diploma in Agriculture from the University of Manitoba, but not before spending a year abroad in Australia. This was just the beginning of his love for travel which he did throughout much of the world. He jumped at every opportunity to travel, for the lessons and perspectives it provided, the friendships it created and to gain the tales that he was so gifted at sharing. He was genuinely curious about people and their lives, making new friendships as consistently as he maintained and cherished old ones.\n\nDoug's integrity spilt over into his career in the cattle business. Here too, he managed to make friends out of customers and ensure that serious business was never too serious for a practical joke. He started his cattle buying business together with his dad and brother. He built a successful business, Doug Jackson Livestock Co. and later Cattlex Ltd., eventually retiring, before starting his work alongside Ruth's Equine Veterinary practice and horse racing endeavours.\n\nHis keen love for history and archaeology was a constant throughout his life. Whether it be digging through the landfill for old bottles, salvaging steamer trunks, whittling wood into lamps and birdhouses, searching the riverbank for buffalo skulls, or tumbling agates, he used his creative talents to celebrate and put history and nature on beautiful display. He took solace in nature and its elements, drawn to the wind on a sail, the view on a drive, the rush of a river, and sunshine through the window with his nose in his book.\n\nThese past couple of years, as his illness progressed have been his greatest test and has been full of tribulations. He handled it all with bravery, grace and humility. Despite the angst, this time was also filled with love and reconnections. He was grateful to be surrounded by so much love.\n\nDoug was a private and unassuming man and in his own words \"didn't want a fuss\". You can pay tribute to him by taking the time you are given to live your best adventure. Think of him when you flip a burger, go for a boat ride, tell a story, play a practical joke on a loved one, or look out over a stretching Manitoba prairie or Ontario escarpment full of autumn leaves.\n\nWe are honouring his request for no formal funeral but please celebrate his life by celebrating yours. He will be laid to rest in Ontario in a private ceremony.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, and if you feel so compelled, you may honor Doug by contributing to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis research by making a donation to: St. Joseph’s Healthcare Foundation, https://research.stjoesca/firestone-institute/donations click “donations” Direct gift to Firestone Institute for Respiratory Health.\n\nPublish Date: Apr 15, 2023\n\nDOUGLAS ALLAN JACKSON\n\nJune 22, 1944 - April 7, 2023\n\nLoved and respected father, husband, son, brother, uncle, and friend, Douglas Allan Jackson died on Friday, April 7, 2023.\n\nIn his 78 years with us, Doug's loyalty, kindness, generosity, hunger for life's adventures and incredibly witty nature was evident to all who came in contact with him.
