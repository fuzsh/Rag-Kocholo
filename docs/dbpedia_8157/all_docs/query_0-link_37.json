What are a few more deaths amid scores of daily executions?\n\nFormer chief investigator Jan Kalisz lives a dangerous double life, forced to work with the occupiers as he gathers information for the fledgling Polish resistance. Even his family cannot be told his true allegiance.\n\nWhen the niece of a Wehrmacht general is found terribly mutilated, Jan links the murder to other killings that are of less interest to his new overlords. Soon, he finds himself on the trail of a psychopathic killer known as The Artist. But, shunned as a Nazi collaborator, can he solve the case before another innocent girl is taken?\n\nA chilling serial killer investigation, perfect for fans of Simon Scarrow's Blackout and the TV series Hannibal starring Mads Mikkelson.\n\nPraise for Blood Roses\n\nA compelling, evocative story of evil stalking amidst the chaos of war Giles Kristian, Sunday Times bestselling author of Where Blood Runs Cold\n\n'A dark, twisting thriller that powerfully recreates the brutal Nazi occupation of Warsaw and dramatises the desperate plight of those forced to collaborate while secretly working for the Resistance.
