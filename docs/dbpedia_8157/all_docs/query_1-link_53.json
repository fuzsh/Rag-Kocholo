John, known as “Papa”, was a loving grandfather to his four grandchildren, Alexandra (Michael) Sipkens, Jeremy Maczkowski, Gabriel Maczkowski and Julia Thorpe. John welcomed his first great-grandchild in 2023, Archer Michael Sipkens, and was looking forward to his second great-grandchild to be born in 2024. He enjoyed being a stepfather to Laura VanDinther and Mark VanDinther (Karen) and their children. John was the youngest of five siblings. John is survived by his siblings, Lois Reed of Texas, Bonnie (Alan) Christie of Toronto, Marlene Jackson of Sarnia, and Ron (Joan) Jackson of Sarnia. He was a blessed uncle, with many, many wonderful nieces, nephews, and great nieces and nephews. John was born and raised in Sarnia, Ontario.
