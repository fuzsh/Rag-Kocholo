        "text": "Charles Douglas Jackson, a guiding figure in Time, Inc., and confidant of former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, died of cancer Friday night in New York Hospital. His age was 62. “C. D.,” as Mr. Jackson was known, has been with the giant magazine enterprise for 33 years..But he so frequently took leaves of absence for military, diplomatic and political assignments that the staff formed the “Fun and Games Committee of the C. D. Jackson Hello & Goodbye Society” to arrange appropriate send‐offs and welcomes. It was he who suggested to General Eisenhower during the 1952 Presidential campaign that he announce his intention to go to Korea if elected. For the first two years of the Eisenhower Administration, he was a special White House assistant on the cold war.\n\nMr. Jackson was born here March 16, 1902. As a boy he accompanied his father, a marble and stone importer, on annual business trips to Europe. After elementary schooling in Switzerland, he attended the Hill. School in Pottstown, Pa. He graduated from Princeton in 1924.\n\nHe had planned to stay at Princeton as an instructor in French, but his father's death made it necessary for him to take over the family business. Like his father, he traveled extensively through Europe, purchasing marble and other building materials.\n\nThe Depression hit the business hard however and he sold it in 1931. In the fall of that year, Mr. Jackson called upon Henry R. Luce, editor in chief of Time, and persuaded him that he could be helpful despite his lack of a journalistic background.\n\n“I guess I psychologically warfared them into giving me a job,” Mr. Jackson recalled later.\n\nHis first title in the organization was assistant to the president.\n\nSix years later, when Life magazine was established, Mr. Jackson became its general manager. In 1940 he was made a vice president of Time, Inc., the parent organization. His work in this post was administrative, with the emphasis on trouble‐shooting and public relations.\n\nLate the same year, with war under way in Europe, Mr. Jackson took a year's leave of absence to organize and head the Council for Democrary, a group of about 100 persons set up to combat isolationist sentiment in this country.\n\nHe returned to the magazine, but left again in 1942 on a State Department mission to Turkey. At that time, Britain and the United States had an exclusive buying contract for Turkish chrome. It was to expire in 1943, but over‐busy Washington had neglected to press for renewal until late 1942.\n\nMr. Jackson arrived in Ankara to find that German agents had persuaded the Turks to turn the contract over to their country.\n\n“We didn’t break the German agreement,” Mr. Jackson said later, “but we bent it badly. First we sped up mining for the last months of our agreement. Then it was amazing how German ships and trains had trouble getting the stuff out. Pulleys broke and that sort of thing.”\n\nAgain Mr. Jackson returned to Time, and again he left, this time in the spring of 1943 to go to North Africa as deputy chief of the psychological warfare branch of Allied Air Force Headquarters there.\n\nIn January, 1944, he was hustled off to London to help organize the psychological warfare division of General Eisenhower's headquarters. His assignment there was to rouse the conquered peoples of Europe, by radio and leaflet, to active support for D‐Day. Toward the end of this campaign his organization was sending the French underground after specific targets, like bridges and railroad switches.\n\nAfter the war, Mr. Jackson was again welcomed by the “Hello & Goodbye Society,” this time as managing director of the newly established international editions of Time and Life.\n\nAt about this time, on a whirlwind trip to London, he was given a motor bike by a British manufacturer. The maiden spin, at Mr. Jackson's summer place in Lenox, Mass., was short. A skid on a gravel path put the bike in a ditch and‐Mr. Jackson among the peonies with a broken foot.\n\nLater, in search of less hazardous recreation, he took up flying and earned a private pilot's license.\n\nHe was next installed as publisher of Fortune, and held this job for nearly two years before his next leave of absence to set up Radio Free Europe.\n\nMr. Jackson resigned as publisher of Fortune but retained his vice presidency in the parent organization while serving President Eisenhower in 1953 and 1954 (after the White House assignment he served as a member of the United States delegation to the United Nations).\n\nEarly this year, shortly before he was named senior vice president of Time, Inc., Mr. Jackson helped organize the International Executive Service Corps, a private organization similar to the Peace Corps. He became board chairman.\n\nHe found time, too, to serve on the boards of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Free Europe Committee, the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, the Metropolitan Opera Association, Project HOPE, and the Carnegie Corporation of New York."
