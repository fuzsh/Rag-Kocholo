        "text": "DOUGLAS JACKSON chats to Paul Burke about his new historical crime thriller Blood Roses, wartime Warsaw, series fiction, Ancient Rome, Caligula & The Angel of Death - Josef Mengele.\n\nBLOOD ROSES As the Nazis roll into Warsaw, a serial killer is unleashed…\n\nSeptember 1939. A city ruled by fear. A population brutalised by restrictions and reprisals. Amid the devastation, another hunter begins to prowl. What are a few more deaths amid scores of daily executions?\n\nFormer chief investigator Jan Kalisz lives a dangerous double life, forced to work with the occupiers as he gathers information for the fledgling Polish resistance. Even his family cannot be told his true allegiance.\n\nWhen the niece of a Wehrmacht general is found terribly mutilated, Jan links the murder to other killings that are of less interest to his new overlords. Soon, he finds himself on the trail of a psychopathic killer known as The Artist. But, shunned as a Nazi collaborator, can he solve the case before another innocent girl is taken?\n\nDouglas Jackson is the author of seventeen historical novels and mystery thrillers published by Transworld/PRH, including the critically acclaimed nine-book Hero of Rome series. He was born in Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders and now lives in Stirling. Originally a journalist by profession he rose to become Assistant Editor of The Scotsman before leaving to be a full-time writer in 2009.\n\nRecommendations\n\nPaul Burke writes for Crime Time, Crime Fiction Lover and the European Literature Network. He is also a CWA Historical Dagger Judge 2023. His first book An Encyclopedia of Spy Fiction will be out in 2025.\n\nMusic courtesy of Guy Hale KILLING ME SOFTLY - MIKE ZITO featuring Kid Anderson.
