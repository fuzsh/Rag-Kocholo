        "text": "October 15, 2023\n\nThis eventful Roman historical novel is the 2nd volume of a series featuring the main protagonist, Marcus Flavius Victor.\n\nStorytelling is absolutely amazing, all characters, whether real historical or fictional, come superbly to life in this story about honour, betrayal, political intrigue, and of course life and death, while the treacherous atmosphere and tribulations within the Roman empire of Emperor Honorius are wonderfully pictured and described by the author.\n\nAt the beginning of the book you'll find two well-drawn maps, one of Marcus Flavius Victor's Journey towards Ravenna in AD406, and one of the famous Battle of Faesulae (Fiesole) AD406 between General Stilicho and the barbarian hordes lead by King Radagaisus, followed by a quote by Latinus Pacatus Drepanius made in AD389.\n\nWhile at the end of the book you'll notice an Historical Note, where the historical details concerning this period of history are meticulously documented, followed by a superb explained Glossary.\n\nThis book starts off in AD406, when Marcus Flavius Victor is betrayed and hunted by Constantinus in Britannia, and due to this action and the hunger to find his son, Brenus, he will take ship towards Saxonia accompanied by his sister, Valeria, and various followers from his time as Lord of the Wall.\n\nOnce Brenus is freed they will head from Saxonia in the North towards the South and the Roman Empire of the West lead by Emperor Honorius and his famous General Flavius Stilicho, and while doing so they will encounter quite some difficulties and skirmishes on their way, and when they reach the court of Emperor Honorius and his vengeful adviser Dulcitius, who's Marcus arch enemy number one and soon enough this Dulcitius will let his presence known, before Marcus is free to join General Stilicho in his struggle against the hordes of King of the Ostrogoths, Radagaisus, at the Battle of Faesulae in AD406, and that will end with a bloody and brutal outcome.\n\nWhat is to follow is a tremendous historical novel, with a lot of political intrigue and backstabbing at court and on the battlefield, accompanied with great depictions of small skirmishes and a great battle where honour and duplicity go hand in hand, and all these ingredients will make you wonder who really is/are the Barbarian(s) in this remarkable ruthless Roman story.\n\nHighly recommended, for this is a glorious addition to this fabulous series, and that's why I like to call this 2nd episode: \"A Brilliant Barbarian\"!\n\nJune 10, 2023\n\nFollow on to The Wall (that I would recommend reading first as it puts much into context).\n\nRoman cavalry commander Marcus Flavius Victor abandons his post in Britain and takes a small band of troops on a mission to rescue his son in Saxonia. His son is, indeed, rescued but their escape is cut off and Marcus finds himself in unfamiliar territory and with a son who seems to hate him. His only option might be to try and find his way to his old friend General Stilicho who is hundreds of miles away and it would be a dangerous journey. Stilicho is, meantime, trying to defend Italy against a vast invasion by Radagaisus, King of the Ostrogoths.\n\nMuch to enjoy in this. The era is interesting AD406, Roman power and traditions are diminishing, and the old religions are being replaced. “Barbarian” tribes sense a weakness in the Roman Empire under the feckless Emperor Honorius and the Roman Empire is on the back foot. I very much enjoyed this sense of a changing time and the reminder that most “Roman” troops were from conquered nations, with the conflict of Roman arrogance and disloyalty playing against brotherhood.\n\nMinor quibbles might be that his son stops hating him very quickly indeed and Marcus falling for a female slave felt a bit odd in the circumstances.\n\nThere is a lot in this, far more depth and sense of time than most “sword and sandals” adventures and delivered by a talented author who really does know his stuff."
