        "text": "Scottish novelist\n\nDouglas Jackson (born 1956) is a Scottish novelist. Jackson grew up in the town of Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders. A journalist on local and national newspapers for 36 years, Jackson left The Scotsman, where he was assistant editor, in 2009 to become a full-time writer.[1]\n\nWriting career\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of January 2015 Jackson has published twelve novels, eight under the name Douglas Jackson and four under the pen name James Douglas. Jackson's first novel was Caligula (2008), the story of a young slave and animal trainer, Rufus, who becomes keeper of the famously mad Emperor's elephant, Bersheba. Rufus and his friend, the famous gladiator, Cupido, struggle to stay alive in the complex web of plot and counter plot in Caligula's court on the Palatine Hill. This was followed in 2009 by Claudius, which continues Rufus's story as he accompanies another emperor on the invasion of Britain in 43 AD. In 2010, Hero of Rome, the first of a new series featuring the tribune Gaius Valerius Verrens, was published, followed on 18 August 2011, by Defender of Rome. The third, Avenger of Rome was published in 2012, followed by Sword of Rome (2013), Enemy of Rome (2014) and Scourge of Rome (2015). Jackson's first series, The Doomsday Testament (James Douglas), follows art recovery expert Jamie Saintclair as he tries to unravel the mystery behind his soldier grandfather's final mission of World War Two, a quest which brings him within a fingertip of the most famous painting still missing from the war, and a buried secret that could destroy the world or safeguard the future of mankind. Douglas Jackson's books are available as ebooks.\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nRufus\n\n[edit]\n\nCaligula (2008)[2]\n\nClaudius (2009)\n\nGaius Valerius Verrens\n\n[edit]\n\nHero of Rome (2010)\n\nDefender of Rome (2011)\n\nAvenger of Rome (2012)\n\nSword of Rome (2013)\n\nEnemy of Rome (2014)\n\nScourge of Rome (2015)\n\nSaviour of Rome (2016)\n\nGlory of Rome (2017)[3]\n\nHammer of Rome (2018)\n\nMarcus Flavius Victor\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Wall (2022)\n\nThe Barbarian (2023)\n\nGlen Savage mystery\n\n[edit]\n\nWar Games (2014)\n\nBrothers in Arms (2019)\n\nOther\n\n[edit]\n\nBlood Roses (2019)\n\nJamie Saintclaire (as James Douglas)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Doomsday Testament (2011)\n\nThe Isis Covenant (2012)\n\nThe Excalibur Codex (2013)\n\nThe Samurai Inheritance (2014)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
