        "text": "Douglas Jackson\n\nDouglas Jackson was born in Jedburgh. He left school at the age of 15 to train as a journalist, first working for local newspapers and later for the Daily Record. He is now assistant editor of The Scotsman. He wrote Caligula, his debut novel set in ancient Rome, while commuting between Edinburgh and his Bridge of Allan home. Originally called The Emperor’s Elephant, his novel was discovered on the writers’ website YouWriteOn.com and a bidding war landed him a six-figure, two book deal.\n\nJackson’s second novel, Claudius, was published in mid 2009, and in 2010 he began a new Roman trilogy Hero of Rome. Douglas also writes under the pen-name of James Douglas."
