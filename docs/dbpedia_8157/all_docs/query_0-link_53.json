There were Hislops there in 1590 and Murrays and Douglases in 1623. The lands were held by Lord Jedburgh in the early 17th century. Simon Elliot of Swinside owned the lands in 1678, when they were valued at £1675. The Hearth Tax records list 13 householders on the estate in 1694. Alexander Lindsay paid tax on 31 windows there in 1748, while William Elliot paid tax for 10 windows.\n\nThe farms there were run by Douglases in the mid-19th century (also written Swineside, Swinesyde, Swinsyde and Swynside; the origin is probably Old English swin set, meaning place where pigs are kept; the name may be first recorded as Swyneshede in 1345, then is Swynyshede in 1390 and Swyinsyde in about 1390).
