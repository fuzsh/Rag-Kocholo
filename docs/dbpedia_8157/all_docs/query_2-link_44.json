Ed Breitkreuzï¿½s desire to go to his eternal home became a reality on Friday, January 23, 2009 at 87 years of age. Ed was born on April 5, 1921 in Plugenau, Poland. He was the 6th of 7 children born to Frederich and Florentina (Ast) Breitkreuz. He helped on the family farm until he enrolled in the German Military Police Force at age 18. But because of World War II he was enlisted in the German Infantry. He served his country in the war for four years on the front line until he was captured. He spent four years in prison camp in Egypt, two of which were after the war ended. After he was released, he immigrated to Canada to join his family who had already come to Canada, settling in the Springside district. Ed met his wife Erma Huber from Chicago through a mutual friend and relative. They were married on January 6, 1951 in Chicago. They moved back to Springside where they started their first farm. Ed and Erma were blessed with three daughters. In 1983 they moved off the farm into Springside, but Ed continued to help at the farm well into retirement years. He enjoyed visiting with family and friends and the highlight of his week would be a get together with a neighbor or a friend to share stories -whether it was about farming, politics or a good old war story. He had a good sense of humor, and even in his later years as Alzheimerï¿½s stole his mind his sense of humor still remained. Ed accepted Christ in his youth and was baptized in 1950 in Canada. He served as a deacon, usher and trustee as well as sang in the choir during his many years as a member of the Springside Baptist Church. His grandchildren were especially important in his life. He enjoyed spending time with them and teaching them his hunting skills, how to operate farm machinery, and how to drive the truck on the roads (even if they were under age)! He also supported them in their school and sporting events. He always loved a good hockey game. Generosity was one of his gifts - you always wanted to go shopping with Opa, because you would get a treat. As a family, we were blessed for the life he shared with us. Ed will be dearly missed by all that were a part of his life. Ed was predeceased by his parents Frederich and Florentina Breitkreuz; brothers, Adolf and Erich (both in WW2) and Paul; sisters, Frieda and Hertha; infant son, Marvin and his loving wife, Erma in 2004.
