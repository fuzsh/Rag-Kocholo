Determined to keep up with his two older brothers Wilfred and Leonard, he too was baptized at the Mona Blvd Church of Christ in Watts Willowbrook, California.\n\nHarold was highly social and easily made friends wherever he went. With his playful spirit, he loved a good laugh and often played practical jokes on those he loved. His favorite hobby as a teenager was raising and training pigeons. He bred the most colorful and sought-after pigeons in the James A. Foshay Jr. High neighborhood in Los Angeles, California.\n\nAfter graduating from Crenshaw High School, Harold enlisted into the United States Army, in July 1981. He served there until 1984 and received an honorable discharge. While in the military, stationed in San Luis Obispo, he met the love of his life. Shortly thereafter, Harold and Julianne Jackson were joined in holy matrimony from 1990 to 2003.\n\nReturning to Southern California, Harold made his permanent home in his favorite city, Santa Monica. He enjoyed volunteer work with a local nonprofit, he kept up with sport stats, and was a huge fan of the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nHe leaves behind his mother and father; two brothers, two aunts, Johnnie Mae Delaine and Bettie Carson; nieces, nephews, and a host of cousins.\n\nVisitation will be on Wednesday, October 7, 2020 in Akes Family's \"Chapel Of the Chimes\" at 11:30 AM with Funeral service to follow at 12:30 PM.\n\nHarold will be laid to rest at Riverside National Cemetery with full Military Honors at 2:15 PM on Wednesday, October 2, 2020.\n\nArrangements Entrusted To The Care of Akes Family Funeral Home, 9695 Magnolia Avenue, Riverside, California 92503 ~ (951) 785-4071 ~ www.akesfamilyfuneralhome.com ~ FD1276 ~\n\n\"When Need Is There, We Are There...
