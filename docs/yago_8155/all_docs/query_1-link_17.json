        "text": "Chanteuse Sandy Lam Yik-lin (pictured below), 38, and songwriter Jonathan Lee Zhongchen, 45, have publicly admitted there is a problem with their marriage.\n\nRumours of a divorce began to spread in April but it wasn't until yesterday that both parties issued separate statements that their six-year marriage was now over.\n\nIn Lee's statement, he said that Lam was not a bad friend of his and quoted lines from the songs he wrote for his previous wife, Sun Hui Kay. 'Our love is a mistake, I wish, I had not made you suffer.'\n\nLam also quoted the lines of a song, by Roberta Flack:\n\n'Love is a rush of wild wind, a scent of a summer rose, a whistle blowing down a distant track, and when it goes, it goes.'\n\nIn order not to hurt their five-year-old daughter, they agreed not to publicly disclose the reason for the divorce.\n\nBut a friend of Lam's said Lee was 'chauvinistic and flirtatious' and there were rumours that Lam did not enjoy a quiet lifestyle."
