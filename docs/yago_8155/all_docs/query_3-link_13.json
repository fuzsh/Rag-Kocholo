        "text": "Sandy Lam Publicly Declares Love for Boyfriend Jun Kung\n\nSandy Lam (林憶蓮) bravely defended her relationship with drummer and music producer Jun Kung (恭碩良) via a Facebook message today, successfully dispelling break up rumors. The 47-year-old singer and 35-year-old Jun were rumored to be dating since 2011 and have been living together since.\n\nJun became Sandy’s official drummer and played at all of her recent performances. Their 12-year age gap has been the focus of tabloid gossips and many believed that the younger Jun is not ready to settle and leave his wild days behind.\n\nEarlier, reports surfaced claiming that Jun was caught flirting with female models while partying at night clubs, angering girlfriend Sandy. The reports further placed blame on Jun’s smoking and drinking habits, and alleged that Jun frequently complained about Sandy in front of his band mates, saying it is difficult to communicate with her.\n\nTo add fuel to the rumors, Jun was visibly absent at Sandy’s Shanghai concert last month. To clarify the situation and to prevent further slander, Sandy decided to go public with their relationship today and rallied fans to stop buying tabloid magazines. In English, Sandy wrote:\n\n“Dear friends and fans,\n\nI am, I have been and will continue to be in a most loving relationship with this beautiful person, his name is Jun Kung.\n\nPlease STOP buying into any of the garbage and malice written on these gossip magazines. There isn’t a single oz of truth in any of these reports!!!\n\nWe need to spread love and positive attitude towards life through music and our actions.\n\nI urge everyone of you to STOP BUYING AND READING ANY TABLOID MAGAZINES!!!\n\nOur society do not need any more negative pollution of our minds and spirit through such irresponsible reports and behavior of these paparazzi and tabloids magazine editors.\n\nWith blessings of love and peace, Sandy”\n\nReporters contacted Jun Kung for comments. Jun explained that he was unable to attend Sandy’s concert because he wanted to spend more time on his work and hoped to remain in Hong Kong to look after his music publishing and production company, MOFO Music. He shared that he will be working with several artists and producers this year, and is planning to collaborate with Sandy. To further emphasize his innocence, Jun added that he had also declined the opportunity to play drums on Eason Chan (陳奕迅)’s concert tour, and thanked everyone for their concerns.\n\nSource: Ming Pao\n\nThis article is written by Katrine for JayneStars.com."
