        "text": "Need a remedy to beat the sweltering heat outside this summer? Some finely crafted ice cream will provide some cold comfort.\n\nThese local artisan ice cream producers know how to hit the sweet spot every time. And here’s the good news: You don’t have to go far to get your desserts.\n\nMilk Lab\n\nBACKSTORY: Bin Chen and Sandy Lam met while attending North Carolina State University. Chen has a special interest in Thai-style rolled ice cream, while Lam appreciates Taiwanese boba tea (also known as bubble tea). The two joined forces and opened Milk Lab, a buzzworthy rolled ice cream and milk tea bar, in December 2017.\n\nSELECTIONS: Among the fanciful ice cream picks include Oreo-permeated Cookie Monster, Campfire Delight (graham crackers, chocolate syrup and toasted marshmallow) and Unicorn Poop, a caramel base with Fruity Pebbles cereal. Unlimited toppings means you can add Gummy Worms, mixed nuts, vanilla wafers, M&Ms, honey and more.\n\n“All the fruits we use are fresh, and we’re committed to using quality ingredients,” Bin said.\n\nDISTINCTIVENESS: Customers can watch as ice cream is made to order on a large, steel-plated machine that looks like an extremely cold pizza pan.\n\n“It’s essentially a powerful condenser that operates between minus 16 and minus 25 degrees Celsius,” said Bin.\n\nThe milk-based mixture is poured onto the flat surface and skillfully stirred as it freezes, eliminating large crystals of ice to create a creamy texture. Once frozen, the mixture is spread across the icy grill and pushed into rolls.\n\nMUST-TRY FLAVOR: Monkey Business, a superlative comingling of fresh banana and Nutella hazelnut spread.\n\n6418 Tryon Road\n\n(Wellington Park Shopping Center), Cary\n\n(984) 200-0016\n\nmilklabcafe.com\n\nAndia’s Homemade Ice Cream\n\nBACKSTORY: What began in 2014 as a catering/special-events enterprise called The Freezing Pointe has rebranded and added an accessible retail spot. Owners Andia and George Xouris earned a 2017 red ribbon from the National Ice Cream Retailers Association for their French vanilla and a Maggy Award for Best Small Business earlier this year.\n\nSELECTIONS: Andia’s serves 22 traditional and eclectic flavors, including a vegan ice cream and two sorbets. Choices like rose pistachio, dark chocolate raspberry and salted caramel keep things intriguing.\n\n“One of our most popular flavors is toffee caramel crunch with locally sourced Durham Toffee,” said Andia.\n\nConsider ordering an ice cream cookie sandwich, baklava sundae or a tempting sampler flight containing seven mini scoops of ice cream. Takeaway quarts are also available.\n\nDISTINCTIVENESS: Ice cream is made in small batches using premium, all-natural ingredients free of additives and hormones. What’s more, the shop’s staff is super-friendly. “We take time to sit with our guests and get to know them,” Andia said. “People either come here after having a bad day, and they leave with a smile, or they’ve had a great day and leave even happier.”\n\nMUST-TRY ITEM: The doughnut sundae is a glazed doughnut stuffed with any flavor ice cream and topped with caramel sauce, chocolate syrup and sprinkles. “We put the doughnut in a warmer that seals in the ice cream, making it gooey,” she explained.\n\n10120 Green Level Church Road, Suite 208\n\n(Cary Park Town Center), Cary\n\n(919) 822-1866\n\nandiasicecream.com\n\nFRESH. Local ice cream\n\nBACKSTORY: Brett Hillman opened the original FRESH. Local Ice Cream on Raleigh’s Glenwood Avenue in 2011. Six years later, son and daughter-in-law Jason and Casey Hillman followed the family tradition and opened the downtown Cary location.\n\n“I grew up in Cary, so it was a dream come true for us to open one here,” Jason said.\n\nSELECTIONS: Flavors range from Madagascar vanilla and butter pecan to strawberry cheesecake and Carolina Crunch, a salted-caramel base mixed with crushed Heath and Butterfinger candy bars. Four specialty flavors appear each month. There’s also a couple of non-dairy frozen desserts made with almond milk.\n\nFor special gatherings, consider the make-your-own-sundae bar delivered wherever you need it. A nifty cooler bag arrives with pre-made cups of ice cream accompanied with all the necessary toppings.\n\nDISTINCTIVENESS: Locally sourced ingredients are free of artificial hormones, antibiotics or pesticides. A large, open window at the front of the cozy storefront allows for a pleasant breeze.\n\n“We want to serve the best possible product while providing the highest-quality customer service,” Casey said.\n\nMUST-TRY FLAVOR: Midnight Brownie Crunch fashioned with Old-World chocolate, Oreo cookies and brownie pieces will elicit a nearly religious experience.\n\n138 East Chatham St., Cary\n\n(919) 234-1155\n\nfreshlocalicecream.com\n\nPints Ice Cream & Beer\n\nBACKSTORY: After losing his high-tech job and his father within a few months, Terrence Morrison decided to do something different with his life. His wife Robyn, a licensed real estate agent, joined him for an ambitious venture that melds ice cream and beer.\n\n“People can get just get ice cream if they want, or they can pair it with a beer like Guinness or a Mason Jar lager,” Terrence said.\n\nSELECTIONS: With a projected opening date of mid to late summer, get ready for inventive ice cream flavors such as brown-sugar vanilla, white-chocolate lavender, Irish coffee and Coconut Dreams. The shop will also sell waffle ice cream sandwiches, which involve hot, Belgian waffles filled with any flavor of ice cream your heart desires.\n\nDISTINCTIVENESS: Need we say more than boldly pairing ice cream and beer? How about the fact that the Morrisons grow their own herbs and source dairy products from Homeland Creamery in Julian, N.C.? The ice cream is scratch-made with passion and purpose.\n\nMUST-TRY FLAVOR: Extraordinary rosemary ice cream crowned with olive oil and sea salt.\n\n“It’s something you wouldn’t think would go well together, but it works,” Terrence said."
