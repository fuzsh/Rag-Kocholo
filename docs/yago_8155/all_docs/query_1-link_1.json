        "text": "Their marriage didn't work out but Jonathan Lee and Sandy Lam are still family.\n\nOn Wednesday (May 1), Sandy was spotted having dinner with her ex-husband in an upscale shopping mall in Taipei.\n\nTheir 21-year-old daughter Renee Lee was also present, as the trio had a meal together in an apparent early celebration of Mother's day.\n\nThe Hong Kong singer, 53, was casually dressed and was seen entering a Japanese restaurant with her assistant.\n\nThey were heard saying \"Reservation by Mr Lee, 6 pax,\" at the counter.\n\nThat \"Mr Lee\" turned out to be Sandy's former spouse, Taiwanese musician Jonathan Lee.\n\nTheir meal lasted for about two hours before the group parted ways.\n\nOn the meeting, Sandy's manager said, \"She values her privacy a lot. The company does not arrange her personal trips, and will not make any response.\"\n\nJonathan wrote several of Sandy's hit songs in the 1990s such as Bygone Love and It Doesn't Matter Who I Am. The pair then tied the knot in 1998 and had Renee in the same year.\n\nAnd even though the couple got a divorce in 2004, they've remained on friendly terms over the years.\n\nThey've also found their other halves -- Sandy is dating Hong Kong singer Jun Kung, 42, while Jonathon, 61, married a woman 27 years his junior in 2018.\n\nasiaone@mm2entertainment.com"
