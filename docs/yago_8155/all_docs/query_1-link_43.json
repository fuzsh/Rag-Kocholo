        "text": "Elder Daniel Luan\n\nSenior Pastor\n\nElder Daniel Luan is the Senior Pastor of Rutgers Community Christian Church. He was brought up in a Christian home and consecrated his life to the Lord at age 15. Early in his college years, however, his faith was severely challenged, yet by carefully studying Scripture he was convinced that the Gospels’ claim about Jesus is true. Later, he served as the president of the Christian Fellowship of National Taiwan University. While attending graduate school in Taipei, he was given opportunities to preach regularly in a local church. He later arrived in the US to pursue doctoral studies in Operations Research at Yale University and met his wife Yowmei there. They came to RCCC in 1981 and served at various ministries. Daniel was ordained as an elder in 1991. After working for Bell Labs and AT&T Labs for twenty-five years he took early retirement and served full-time in the church, appointed as Co-moderator in 2008. His ministry responsibility also involved leading the Caring and the Worship departments. During this period, he studied part-time at Westminster Theological Seminary, earning an MAR in 2014, and has since completed all course requirements toward a ThM in the Old Testament. In 2019, he answered the call to serve as Senior Pastor at RCCC.\n\nPastor Daniel and Yowmei have three children: Luke and daughter-in-law Shannon; Grace and son-in-law Mark with two granddaughters; and Gloria. He enjoys reading, travelling, classical music, and spending time with family.\n\nRev. James Hsiao\n\nPastor, English Ministry\n\nPastor James Hsiao is pastor of the English ministry. After completing his B.A. in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry at Rutgers University, he worked briefly in pharmaceuticals. James resumed studies at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary and completed an M.Div in 2008. While in seminary, he was a youth ministry intern at Chinese Bible Church of Greater Boston in Lexington, MA. He also practiced counseling at Beverly Hospital in Beverly, MA through the Association for Clinical Pastoral Education (ACPE). In 2006, James began serving as Assistant Director of University Ministries at Citylife Presbyterian Church in Boston, before transitioning to Pastoral Fellow in 2010. In the same year, he helped launch The Center for Gospel Culture as Media Director.\n\nIn 2011, James accepted the call from RCCC to come on staff to further the work of the gospel among youths and families. He has a passion to see the gospel of grace transform lives by reconciliation and renewal. He and his wife, Allison, have three children and occasionally have a dog. His favorite activities are woodworking, photography, reading and enjoying coffee.\n\nRev. Sandy M. Liu\n\nPastor, English and NextGen Ministries\n\nPastor Sandy is the newest pastor at RCCC, primarily leading the ministry to youth and families. Prior to coming to RCCC, Pastor Sandy led the youth ministry for 2 years at the Chinese Church of Philadelphia, PA, and then for 27 years at the Chinese Bible Church of Greater Boston, MA. She had the joy of pastoring multiple generations of youths and of mentoring many seminarian interns to serve in the Chinese church youth ministries and beyond. She was ordained at CBCGB in 1998. Since her retirement in late 2016, she has engaged in advancing global missions as the CBCGB Missions Chair and as the Vice Chair of the Executive Steering Team of Chinese Mission Convention (CMC 2019). She was trained at The Cooper Union – School of Architecture, Nyack College (B.S. in Christian Education), and Westminster Theological Seminary (M.A.R. in Theology).\n\nShe has been married for over 30 years to her husband Peirung. They have two grown sons, Ted and Spencer, whom she adores. She enjoys artistic pursuits and chillaxing with friends over delicious meals, great music and bold coffee.\n\nAndrew Yuen\n\nMinister\n\nAndrew is currently the English congregation’s intern minister. After growing up in RCCC since his youth, he attended and graduated from the University of Rochester in 2013 with degrees in Mathematics and Music. He then returned to NJ and worked as an actuary at Prudential. A few years later, he enrolled at Missio Seminary in Philadelphia where he finished an M.Div in 2021. Andrew currently works with collegians and young adults.\n\nHe and his wife, Samantha, are eager to serve the Lord and serve the RCCC community. He is excited to see God’s people love God more especially through areas like fellowship and discipleship. Some of Andrew’s interests include cars, steak, and bubble tea.\n\nGrace Lee\n\nIntern Minister\n\nGrace is currently a Youth intern minister. She grew up in RCCC as a youth, then completed her B.S in Electrical Engineering and M.S. in Bioelectronics at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. After graduating, she worked as a web developer while serving in the RCCC youth ministry. In 2023, she received her M.Div from Westminster Theological Seminary.\n\nGrace is delighted to serve God and His people at RCCC and loves spending time with the youth. She is excited to see how God raises up the next generations for His glory, especially in this current culture. She enjoys candy, games, and artsy things.\n\nJonathan Lo\n\nIntern Minister\n\nJonathan (Jon) Lo is an Intern Minister at Rutgers Community Christian Church in the English and Worship Ministries. After graduating from Rutgers University School of Nursing with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing, he worked as a home care nurse in the regions of western and northern New Jersey.\n\nIn 2019, Jonathan moved to Houston, Texas, to work as a full-time intern at New Heart Music Ministries. He then returned to New Jersey in 2020 to attend graduate school at Westminster Theological Seminary, graduating in 2023 with a Master of Arts in Religion.\n\nJonathan is grateful for the opportunity to grow as a minister of the gospel and develop his callings and giftings in the areas of worship, preaching, teaching, and caring. His hope for RCCC is that it would grow ever deeper in its love for God and for others and that in its love, service, and worship, the light of the Gospel and the beauty of Christ would be made known to all, in New Jersey and beyond."
