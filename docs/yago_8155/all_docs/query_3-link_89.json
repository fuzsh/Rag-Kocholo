        "text": "Â Â Â Â Hong Kong pop singer Sandy Lam will sing her greatest hits spanning her 30-year career.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Lam began her singing career in 1984 when she was signed to CBS/Sony Records. Since the 1980s, she also recorded with Warner Music, Rock Records, Virgin Records, Capitol Records, EMI Music and now Universal Music.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Lam started her singing career in Hong Kong in the mid-80s with a string of up-tempo Japanese style songs. She then issued some âCity-Rhythmâ R&B tracks. In 1991 she released the groundbreaking coming-of-age âWildflowerâ album to rave reviews, part of the âunpluggedâ craze in the Cantopop scene.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Lam gained popularity in Taiwan with her debut Mandarin release âHome Again Without Youâ in 1991. In 1995 she teamed up with Jonathan Lee, Taiwanese music producer, and released her fourth Mandarin album âLove, Sandyâ featuring a hit single âScars,â which became one of the all-time best-selling Chinese-language albums. Since then Lam has moved beyond the Hong Kong music scene and spent most of her time on the Chinese mainland and in Japan. Lam returned to the music scene with a hit single âAt Least I Still Have Youâ from her first album in 2000. In 2001 she released a Mandarin-language album entitled âTruly Sandy,â on which she co-wrote four songs.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Time: 7:30 p.m., Oct. 22\n\nÂ Â Â Â Tickets: 280-1,380 yuan\n\nÂ Â Â Â Venue: Gymnasium of Shenzhen Bay Sports Center, 3001 Binhai Boulevard, Nanshan District (åå±±åºæ»¨æµ·å¤§é3001å·æ·±å³æ¹¾ä½è²ä¸­å¿ä½è²é¦)\n\nÂ Â Â Â Metro: Line 2, Keyuan Station (ç§èç«), Exit A(SD News)"
