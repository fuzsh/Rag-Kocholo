        "text": "This article is about the Taiwanese musician. For other people with the same name, see Jonathan Lee.\n\nJonathan Lee Chung-shan (Chinese: 李宗盛; pinyin: Lǐ Zōngshèng; born 19 July 1958) is a Taiwanese musician and producer. He is regarded as one of the most influential and respected figures in the world of Mandopop music.\n\nLife and career\n\n[edit]\n\nLee started in the music industry in the 1970s, during Taiwan's popular \"campus folk song\" era. He was a member of the \"Wood Guitar\" band. In 1983, Lee made his debut as a music producer for the album Light Rain Just Comes in Time by Zheng Yi, which became an instant hit. The eponymous single \"Light Rain Just Comes in Time\" ranked No. 1 for 13 consecutive weeks on Taiwan's main music chart; the first single \"End\", a duet with Yvonne Jeng, written, composed and sung by Lee, also became a huge hit.\n\nIn 1984, Lee joined Rock Records, and has been credited with catapulting Rock Records into one of the foremost independent music labels in Asia. He helped pave the way for the golden era of Chinese pop music in the 1990s and 2000s, during which he wrote and produced many classic hits popular until today, setting impressive sales records, plus winning numerous accolades, such as Sarah Chen's \"Dream to Awakening\" (夢醒時分), Jackie Chan's \"The Sincere Hero\" (真心英雄), Wakin Chau's \"You Make Me Happy and Sad\" (讓我歡喜讓我憂), Jeff Chang's \"Love is Like Tidal Wave\" (愛如潮水), Sandy Lam's \"It Doesn't Matter Who I Am\" (不必在乎我是誰), Winnie Hsin's \"Understanding\" (領悟), Karen Mok's \"Overcast\" (陰天), and many more, which have all been hugely popular. As such, Lee has been hailed as the \"million-dollar\" producer, and deemed as the Godfather of Mandopop music, reaching and touching hundreds of millions of Chinese-speaking music fans around the world. He has been and remains one of the most successful and sought-after record producers in Chinese pop music scene. Given his iconic status in the Chinese music world, Lee's songs have influenced artists across Asia.[1]\n\nMore than music production, Lee has also been involved in movie theme songs and OST projects, and having collaborated with many famous directors, including Hou Hsiao-hsien, Sylvia Chang, Jackie Chan, Chen Kaige, plus others.\n\nIn 2002, he founded his own guitar brand \"Lee Guitars\", and has been personally involved in the design and production of hand-made guitars ever since.\n\nIn 2009, Lee formed \"Superband\" with three other popular artists from Rock Records: Wakin Chau, Luo Dayou and Chang Chen-yue.[2]\n\nLee also occasionally produces solo albums for himself and have recorded duets with many artists. His own songs \"Jonathan's Song\" in 2011 and \"Hills\" in 2013, both won \"Song of the Year\" and \"Best Lyricist\" awards at the 22nd and 25th Taiwan Golden Melody Awards respectively.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2015, Lee embarked on his Even If Youth Is Never Lasting world tour, which kicked off in Taiwan, then toured on to China, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, the U.S., and U.K., etc., covering dozens of cities around the world, including two consecutive performances at Lincoln Center in New York, a first for a Chinese-speaking musician. He also held a concert at the famed Royal Albert Hall in London, also a first for a musician from Taiwan.\n\nLee also served as Chief A&R Consultant for Sony Music in Greater China from 2013 to 2016. In addition, Lee was also a driving force in introducing the renowned Blue Note Jazz Club to Beijing, China. In September 2016, Lee was joined by famous American jazz pianist and composer Chick Corea, for the grand opening of Blue Note in Beijing. His hope is to introduce the great American jazz music and culture, plus the many great jazz musicians, to the Chinese-speaking world.\n\nIn September 2017, it was announced that the Tony-winning Signature Theatre in Arlington, Virginia, will help develop \"Road to Heaven: The Jonathan Lee Musical\", an original Chinese musical — in both Mandarin and English, based on music written by Lee. Adapted from the novel by Li Xiuwen, the original musical will feature music by Lee with English lyrics by Tony Award winner Richard Maltby Jr. (Ain't Misbehavin', Miss Saigon, Fosse) and a book by John Dempsey (The Pirate Queen, The Witches of Eastwick). The musical will then be translated back into Chinese for a world premiere in Shanghai in 2018. English-language productions are also planned for New York and other cities throughout the U.S. following the Chinese premiere.[3]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nKey productions\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Album Artist 1983 Light Rain Just Comes in Time 小雨來的正是時候 Zheng Yi 1984 Rock'n Roll Stage 搖滾舞台 Xue Yue 1985 Busy and Blind 忙與盲 Sylvia Chang 1986 New Love/Old Love 舊愛新歡 Michelle Pan 1987 Direction of the Heart 心的方向 Wakin Chau 1988 Heart of a Woman 女人心 Sarah Chen 1989 Talk to You, Listen to You 跟你說 聽你說 Sarah Chen 1991 The First Time 第一次 Jackie Chan 1993 Worrying 心事 Jeff Chang 1994 Understanding 領悟 Winnie Hsin 1995 Scar 傷痕 Sandy Lam 1999 Growing Up 一夜長大 Fish Leong 2000 Twelfth Floor 十二樓 Karen Mok 2001 Day Lilies 忘憂草 Wakin Chau 2002 Princess-D OST 想飛OST Various 2004 20/30/40 OST 女人二十三十四十OST Various 2009 North Bound (EP) 縱貫線北上列車EP Superband 2010 Go South (EP) 縱貫線南下列車EP Superband 2011 Pure 原色 Aska Yang 2014 What's Next 接下來是什麼 Ann Bai 2017 Still An Outlander 仍是異鄉人 Li Jianqing\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Album 1986 The Spirit of Life 生命中的精靈 1989 Works of Jonathan Lee 1984–1989 李宗盛作品集 1993 2 X Man Life / Jonathan Lee & Lowell Lo 李宗盛＆盧冠廷／我們就是這樣 1994 Reluctantly 李宗盛的音樂旅程-不捨\n\nFilm theme songs/score productions\n\n[edit]\n\n1983 Growing Up\n\n1983 The Boys from Fengkuei\n\n1984 Ah Fei\n\n1987 Eastern Condors\n\n1987 Listen to Me\n\n1991 Sisters of the World Unite – nominated for Hong Kong Film Awards \"Best Original Film Score”\n\n1992 Police Story 3: Super Cop\n\n1992 Three Summers\n\n1993 Farewell My Concubine\n\n1993 The East Is Red\n\n2014 Dream Flight\n\nTelevision theme songs productions\n\n[edit]\n\n1991 Farewell (TV drama) – theme song / TTV (Taiwan Television Enterprise)\n\n1991 Eternal Love Like Ocean (碧海情天) (TV drama) theme and ending credit songs – \"Ordinary Man\" (凡人歌) and \"Eternal Love Like Ocean\"/TTV\n\n1992 The Last Emperor (TV drama) theme song – \"Infatuation\"/TTV\n\n1993 Young Heroes (TV drama) theme song – \"Happy Like Gods\"/TTV\n\n1993 Happy Building (TV drama) theme and ending credit songs/CTS (Chinese Television System)\n\n1994 Chivalry Under the Blue Sky (TV drama) ending credit song/TTV\n\n1996 The New Longmen Roadhouse (TV drama) ending credit song/TTV\n\nSongs for advertisements/commercials\n\n[edit]\n\n1986 Little Cook Instant Noodles – Beef Flavor\n\n1987 Laurel Frozen Dumpling\n\n1989 Sprite and Coca-Cola\n\n1990 PECOS Soy Milk\n\n1991 FUJI COLOR Fuji Films\n\n1992 Yamaha Corporate Song\n\n1992 China Airlines\n\n1992 Paolyta-B (energy drink)\n\n1993 HeySong Sarsaparilla Drink\n\n1993 BMW\n\n1993 Maxwell House Coffee\n\n1999 Suntory Whisky\n\n2016 Apple China – Send you a Spring Festival Song\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\n1983 Growing Up 小畢的故事\n\n1983 The Boys from Fengkuei 風櫃來的人\n\n1984 Ah Fei 油麻菜籽\n\n1985 My Favorite Season 最想念的季節\n\n1986 The Lock of Hearts 心鎖\n\n1987 Listen to Me 我有話要說\n\n1988 Friendly Shock (Yaya) 天崩地裂\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\n1985 What/TTV\n\n1990 Sunday Fever – Apocalypse (variety show)/TTV\n\nConcerts\n\n[edit]\n\n2006–2009 Sense and Sensibility World Tour (11 Shows)\n\n2009–2010 Superband World Tour (58 Shows)\n\nRadio programs\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Talking Past Each Other\" – Host / Taiwan PBS (Police Broadcasting Service) – nominated for Taiwan's Golden Bell Awards for \"Popular Music Radio Program\" and \"Best Radio DJ”\n\n\"Appointment After Dusk\" – Host / PBS\n\n\"Musician\" – Host / i like radio (Broadcasting Corporation of China) – won Golden Bell Awards Best Radio DJ Award\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Award Category Nominated work Result 1991 3rd Golden Melody Awards Best Album Producer Marching Forward – Lin Chung Won 1997 Singapore Hit Awards Best Lyricist \"Infatuation\" Won Outstanding Musician of the Year Won 2001 12th Golden Melody Awards Best Album Producer Twelfth Floor – Karen Mok Won 2001 The Association of Music Workers in Taiwan Awards Ten Best Album of the Year Twelfth Floor – Karen Mok Won Ten Best Songs of the Year Won 2003 5th CCTV-MTV Music Awards (China) Special Outstanding Contribution in Music Award Won 2011 The Association of Music Workers in Taiwan Awards Ten Best Songs of the Year \"Jonathan's Song\" Won 2011 22nd Golden Melody Awards Best Lyricist \"Jonathan's Song\" Won Best Composer Won Song of the Year Won 2012 The Association of Music Workers in Taiwan Awards Ten Best Album of the Year Pure – Aska Yang Won Ten Best Songs of the Year Won 2014 The Association of Music Workers in Taiwan Awards Ten Best Songs of the Year \"Hills\" Won 2014 25th Golden Melody Awards Best Album Producer Hills Won Song of the Year Won 2018 29th Golden Melody Awards Best Lyricist \"Hometown\" (from Still An Outlander) Nominated Best Album Producer Still An Outlander Won\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
