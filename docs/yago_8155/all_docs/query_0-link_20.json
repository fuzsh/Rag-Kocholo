She was eliminated in the Blind Auditions.\n\nBackground[]\n\nSandy Lam is a Hong Kong singer. She began her career at the age of sixteen, getting a job as a D.J. for Commercial Radio Hong Kong. She began her singing career in 1984 when she was signed to CBS/Sony Records. Her first single was I Don't Know About Love. Sandy Lam has recorded not only with CBS Sony Records in the 1980s, but also with Warner Music, Rock Records (Taiwan's largest independent label), Virgin Records, Capitol Records, EMI Music, and now Universal Music.\n\nLam started her singing career in Hong Kong in the mid-80s with a string of up-tempo Japanese style songs. She then released several albums, including the critically acclaimed \"City Rhythm\" series, featuring R&B-style tracks. In 1991 she released the ground breaking coming-of-age \"Wildflower\" album to rave reviews, part of the \"unplugged\" craze in the Cantopop scene.\n\nLam gained popularity in Taiwan with her debut Mandarin release \"Home Again Without You\" (\"愛上一個不回家的人\") in 1991. In 1995 she teamed up with Jonathan Lee, Taiwanese music producer, and released her fourth Mandarin album Love, Sandy featuring the hit single \"Scars\" (\"傷痕\"), which became one of the all-time best selling Chinese language albums. Since then Lam has moved beyond the Hong Kong music scene and spent most of her time in Taiwan, China, and Japan. Her 2006 Mandarin language album Breathe Me was recorded in South Korea, Taiwan, mainland China and Hong Kong.\n\nLam returned to the music scene with a hit single \"At Least I Still Have You\" (\"至少還有你\") from her first album with Virgin in 2000. A Korean remake of the song, sung by Super Junior-M, a sub-group of the K-Pop band Super Junior, was released on their Me album titled Dangsinigie (당신이기에) in 2008. In December 2001 she released a Mandarin-language album entitled \"Truly Sandy\", on which she co-wrote four songs. In the same year, Lam appeared as cast member of an Andrew Lloyd Webber concert Masterpiece, which also featured West End and Broadway star Elaine Paige and China's all-time best-selling recording artist Kris Phillips. This concert was sold out with an audience of over 17,700 people.\n\nLam has won many awards during the course of her career, including Best Regional Performing Female Artist, Best Album, Best Female Vocalist, the Asia Pacific Most Outstanding Female Artist, and an honorary Music Award for her contributions to the music industry.\n\nLam won a total of four awards at the 24th Golden Melody Awards in 2013. These include \"Best Female Singer\" as well as \"Best Mandarin Album\", \"Best Album Producer\" & \"Best Musical Arranger\" for her album \"Gaia\".\n\nIn 2017 Lam won on Singer 2017, a Hunan Television contest.
