        "text": "Hailed as the godfather of Taiwanese Mandapop, multi-talented musician Jonathan Lee is making a comeback concert after a seven-year hiatus with his newest world tour “Since Youth is fleeting” this November 29th, at 8pm at the Putra Indoor Stadium, Bukit Jalil.\n\nAn influential figure in the Mandapop music industry, Lee launched his solo world tour with a sell-out show in Taipei Arena last September. He subsequently toured many major cities, filling out arenas with overwhelming response in Beijing, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Wuhan, Xiamen, Tianjin, Macau, Canada and Singapore. He becomes the first Taiwanese to play Dolby Theatre in Hollywood as well.\n\nNo flashy setup or pyrotechnic effect, but Lee is such good performer to take command of a stage. He tells funny stories, engages with audience while he decides which guitar to play on stage. He does not make the audience go wild or unbutton their shirts but his many mega hits and trademark speak-singing fashion easily ‘steals’ your hearts and souls away while it conjures memories and leave vibrations continue within for days.\n\nA well-respected singer, songwriter and music producer, Lee has produced countless classic hits and best-selling albums for various artistes. And Lee is set to serenade audience with many of his own songs as well as popular hits he wrote for others such as Jeff Chang’s I Really Love You, Winnie Hsin’s Realization, Emil Chau’s Let Me Be Happy, Let Me Be Sad, Sandy Lam’s No Need To Care Who I Am, Sylvia Chang’s Because Of Loneliness and Karen Mok’s 12th Floor.\n\nIn an intimate setting, Lee’s concert will be more like a sharing session, about music, personal stories, life experience, men and women. It is expected to be a great musical feast you shall not miss!\n\nLee also recently walked away with one of the biggest hauls from the Golden Melody Awards in Taiwan last month. His album and song Hills grabbed Best Song of the Year, Best Lyricist and Best Album Packaging.\n\nJointly organized by Star Planet, Live Nation and Melody FM, ticket sale for Jonathan Lee World Tour Live 2014 will commence on September 9th, from 11 am. 15% discount will be extended on the first 1000 tickets sold (applicable for all ticket types). Genting Rewards Members can use Reward Points to redeem tickets via designated ticket outlets. All Promotions subject to terms and conditions.\n\nTicketing Information:\n\nTicket Prices:\n\nRM 571.00, RM 441.00, RM 331.00, RM 251.00 & RM 151.00"
