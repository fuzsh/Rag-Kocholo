        "text": "Hong Kong songstress Sandy Lam (林憶蓮) and singer, Jun Kung (恭碩良) have called it quits after dating for 8 years. The news was confirmed by Sandy Lam’s manager, who says they had already broke up a year ago. They are reportedly still friends. Jun Kung, who is 11 years younger than Sandy Lam, often collaborated with Sandy Lam on music.\n\nSandy Lam has always been very private about her love life. She married renowned Taiwanese musician, Jonathan Lee (李宗盛) in 1998 and had a daughter together. The two divorced in 2004. She started dating Jun Kung in 2011. There were rumors Sandy Lam’s daughter was averse to Jun Kung at first, but their relationship improved when he taught her how to play drums and the guitar. Shortly afterwards, Jun Kung moved in with Sandy Lam and became her often used drummer for performances. At one point, there were even marriage rumors.\n\nShortly after the news went public, Sandy Lam and Jun Kung both confirmed their break up on social media with the same statement.\n\nCredit: Apple Daily HK"
