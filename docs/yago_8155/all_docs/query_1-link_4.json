        "text": "7 Feb â€“ Sandy Lam and Jun Kung have called it quits on their relationship after eight years together.\n\nAs reported on Mingpao, the singer recently released a statement on social media to confirm the breakup which read, \"Jun and I had 'consciously uncoupled' in January 2019. It was with hearts full of sorrow that we had decided to move on our own paths after 8 years of going through thick and thin together.\"\n\n\"This was a difficult decision but one we consciously made with deep love and care for each other,\" she added.\n\nAccording to Sandy's manager, the two parties are still friends despite the breakup and will continue their collaboration in the music industry.\n\nSandy and Jun started dating back in 2011. Prior to the drummer, the singer was married to Taiwanese musican Jonathan Lee, where they also have a daughter together."
