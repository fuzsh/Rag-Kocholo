        "text": "Sandy Lam is the diva in Chinese pop. While the artists in my previous blogs may not be well known outside Hong Kong, Sandy is very popular and much loved by millions of fans across China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Chinese diasporas around the world.\n\nSandy started her career in the mid 80s and released her debut album when she was 19. Initially she went with a Japanese-style cute girl image, but her immature voice did not attract many audiences. She quickly changed her style by the second album though, and her song 放縱 Intemperance was her first major hit, with the famous lyric line \"I'm empty, I'm lonely, I'm cold\" still well known today after 30+ years.\n\nShe switched to urban adult contemporary music genre and significantly improved her singing technique over the years. Cantopop in the 80s and early 90s was dominated by foreign song covers, and Sandy was no exception. Many of her Cantopop hits were covers of songs in English, such as:\n\nOriginalSandy's cover Take My Breath Away by Berlin激情 Passion Heartache by Pepsi & Shirlie灰色 Grey Love Is You by Santana早晨 Morning Are You Ready For Love? by Robbie Dupree滴汗 Sweat Don't Rush Me by Taylor Dayne講多錯多 Talk Too Much You Are My Man by Viktor Lazlo你是我的男人 You Are My Man The Lover In Me by Sheena Easton一分鐘都市・一分鐘戀愛 One Minute City, One Minute Love I Still Believe by Brenda K Starr依然 Still Something About You by Yoko Oginome你令我性感 You Make Me Sexy On The Strength by Flame (with Tony Terry)傾斜 Sliding Crazy 4 U by Sybil ft. Salt-N-Pepa瘋了 Crazy Promise Me by Beverley Craven沒有你 還是愛你 Without You, Still Love You\n\nBy 1990, Sandy became one of the most popular female singers in Hong Kong, winning the Gold award for female artist at the Ultimate Music Awards for three consecutive years. She then expanded her career to Taiwan and Japan and released Mandarin and Japanese albums. Her Mandopop songs were particularly popular, with many great hits such as 傷痕 Scar and 至少還有你 At Least I've Got You, and she sold millions of records. In 2017, her popularity reached another new height when she won the season 5 of Singer, a popular TV contest show in mainland China. She released Gaia in 2012 and 0 in 2018, the two exceptional albums earning her Best Female Singer twice at the prestigious Golden Melody Awards in Taiwan, the equivalent of the Grammys in Chinese pop music.\n\nIn this blog, I will pick few of my favourite songs by Sandy, including some obscure side tracks that may only be familiar to her die-hard fans.\n\nThere are many other songs from Sandy that I love so much, and here are just a selection from my long list (in chronological order):\n\n鷹與星 Eagle and Star - this 1987 song told a fairy tale story about a cursed couple where the girl was turned to an eagle during the day and the boy was turned into a star at night.\n\n下雨天 Rainy Day (duet with Blue Jeans) - a song from 1988 became more popular recently when it was covered by many other artists such as Faye Wong\n\n微雨撲巴黎 Drizzle in Paris - a romantic journey to the City of Love, from her City Rhythm Part 3 - Faces & Places album in 1990\n\n都市心 City Heart - from the same album above, a sentimental song about lives in modern cities\n\n讓我笑吧! Let Me Laugh! (Cantonese), Love And Life And You And Me (English), also 走在大街的女子 A Girl Walking Down the Street (A Cappella version) in Mandarin - a beautiful song in any language\n\n心野夜 Heart Wild Night - the most feminine and the sexiest funk song from Sandy\n\n哈囉寂寞 Hello Loneliness (Mandarin) and 哈囉感覺 Hello Feeling (Cantonese) - a jazz from her 1991 album Dreamt, Crazed, Tired, which is widely regarded as one of her best albums\n\n愛的世界 World of Love - from the 1992 Come Back to Love album, this soft easy-listening song was the total opposite to the other power ballads from Sandy, demonstrating her diversity in music\n\n芝加哥的故事 Chicago Story - this musical inspired song from 1994 told a tragic love story between a bartender and a bar singer\n\nEvery night I'm your woman, but life and death are your own matters.\n\nEvery night I'm your woman, and soulmate.\n\n誰像你好 Who's As Good As You - this song followed the above immediately in her Sandy '94 album, another sensual song with her signature \"dolphin pitch\" towards the end\n\n不還你 Won't Pay You Back - this energetic dance number was from her 2001 Sandy album\n\n十二小時不下雨 It Won't Rain For 12 Hours - a lovely song about travelling on a long haul flight above the cloud\n\nEncore - a disco beat specifically written for her 2002 concert (I attended this concert twice). It was one of the first songs written by Pong Nan. I started noticing him since then.\n\n日與夜 Day and Night (duet with Jacky Cheung) - the theme song of the radio drama of the same name in 2002, this was a rare collaboration between the Cantopop king and queen. Previously, Sandy stepped in at the last minute as the female protagonist in Jacky's musical Snow.Wolf.Lake, after the original cast quitting due to stress. Unfortunately, Sandy's performance at the musical was never recorded due to copyright issue.\n\nIncomplete - this was originally planned for the lyricist Richard Lam to write, but he passed away before he could complete it. Instead of appointing another lyricist, Sandy sang the song without words as a tribute to Richard, who was deemed irreplaceable.\n\n哭 Cry (Live 2007) - the original version from 1996, while it was not bad at all, was written by her ex-husband Jonathan Lee. He brought great success to Sandy in Taiwan, but was blamed by many fans (including myself) for changing Sandy's music genre from R&B to this Taiwanese-style love ballads catered for the karaoke. Therefore, it was a great surprise when the song was rearranged and transformed into this exquisite live version featuring the cello, pipa and erhu.\n\n也許 Perhaps (Mandarin) and 兩心花 Twin Flowers (Cantonese) - this was the theme song of the movie Hi, Fidelity directed by the lyricist Calvin Poon. Sandy sang the song with her signature soft voice. She was also the co-lyricist of the Mandarin version. It won the Best Original Song at the 31st Hong Kong Film Awards.\n\n柿子 Persimmon - a dramatic song about environmental destruction\n\nbreathe in... breathe out (English) and 一呼...一吸 (Mandarin) - the first and last song from her 2018 album 0, setting the theme for this award winning album\n\n纖維 Angels - a very touching song about life and death\n\nWhen talking about Sandy's music, I have to mention her 野花 Wildflower album. Released in late 1991, it was universally recognised as her best album ever and it represented the zenith of her musical achievement. The theme of the album was around the metaphor of Sandy being a wildflower, someone who did not grow up in the greenhouse, with no roots and could not easily settle down. When it was first released, it was considered an avant-garde and too much ahead of its time, and it did not sell well. The first single, 再生戀 Predestiny, combined traditional Chinese opera with R&B, and it was not widely accepted by the audiences back then. However, over the past three decades, Wildflower was highly acclaimed and often appeared in top 10 (if not top 1) list of the best Chinese pop albums of all time by many music critics. You can listen to the entire album here.\n\nIn addition, there are many covers, remakes and tributes by Sandy that I like a lot (beside those listed in the beginning of this blog).\n\nOriginalSandy's covercomments Open Your Mind by Eighth Wonder點唱機 JukeboxSandy's fans were pleasantly surprised when she featured this old and little known side track in her 2005 concert Make It Real by The Jets夜了...沒有藉口 It's So Late...There Is No ExcuseAnother classic 80s side track Love In A World Gone Mad by Agnetha Fältskog偷閒 Just Relax For A WhileA relaxing tune from her first of three urban themed City Rhythm albums Run For Cover by Basia逃離鋼筋森林 Escape From The CityA dance beat from her second City Rhythm album in 1989 Happy Ever After by Julia Fordham痴纏 Crazy LoveA touchy-feely song from Sandy and very different from Julia Fordham's original version And When She Danced by David Foster & Marilyn Martin此情只待成追憶 In Memory of Love (duet with Anthony Lun)A beautiful 80s love ballad with her long time collaborator Anthony Lun On My Way Home to You by Michael Franks再不在乎 Don't Care AnymoreThe final track in her third City Rhythm album in 1990, a much loved side track by her fans. She surprised everyone by opening her 2007 concert with this song. And So It Goes by Roberta Flack微涼 Slightly ChillyOne of the crowd favourites. Sandy quoted lyrics from this song when she had to do a press release on her divorce in 2004 薔薇之戀 Temptation of the Rose by Yin Fang Ling薔薇之戀 Temptation of the RoseA classical Mandarin song from the 60s. Sandy redid the song with a completely modern rendition of it. 夜來香 Moonflower by Yoshiko Yamaguchi夜來香 MoonflowerAnother famous song from the 40s by the renowned Chinese-Japanese singer during WW2. It has since been covered over a hundred times by various singers. In Sandy's version, a new verse was combined with the original chorus.I Need You Back by Dick Lee沒結果 No ResultA passionate power ballad from 1992 that showcased her musical talent and cemented her status as the Cantopop diva Baby It's You by The Shirelles由你開始 Start From YouSandy's version was in turn adopted from Cherrelle's 1991 remake of the song. It was a modern twist featuring the Chinese instrument pipa. 情人 Lover by Beyond情人 LoverAfter Wong Ka Kui, the lead singer of the band Beyond, died from a tragic stage accident in Japan in 1993, Sandy paid tribute and sang this song in tears. Bizarre Love Triangle by New Order一個人 SingleReleased in 2006, it was a tribute to the 80s disco classic 路過蜻蜓 Pass-by Dragonfly by Leslie Cheung路過蜻蜓 Pass-by DragonflyPart of the 2012 ReImagine project on the 9th anniversary of the death of Leslie Cheung, the Hong Kong superstar. The song earned her the Best Female Performer award at the Golden Sail Music Awards, as voted by music industry professionals in Hong Kong. Within You'll Remain by ChynaWithin You'll RemainA tribute to the first internationally recognised band from Hong Kong\n\nSorry this is a very long blog and mostly self-indulgent. But as you can see, I listen to Sandy pretty much all my life and she is my idol. I can keep writing about her music but have to stop somewhere.\n\nTo many non-Chinese, all these Cantonese covers of English songs may sound funny and weird. Bear in mind that this was the 80s and early 90s before the internet and music streaming, and access to foreign music was quite limited. For many locals, they would have never listened to the originals, hence these cover versions sounded perfectly normal. In fact, I only listened to few of the original version for the first time while researching for this blog. Covering foreign songs was a formula for quick turnaround and success in Cantopop in the 80s. The practice was only phased out in the 90s when the most popular radio station in Hong Kong stopped playing covered songs in order to promote and support local musicians."
