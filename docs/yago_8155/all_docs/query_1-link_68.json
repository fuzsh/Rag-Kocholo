This Homepage is extremely good. Classification of information is excellent. I've been Sandy's fans for nearly 10 years. To me, Sandy is so unique that none of the Hong Kong singer can imitate her character. Her voice, face are so unique. I know her new mandarin album will be released very soon (Around Feb 99). Though I read from newspaper that there won't be lots of promotion on this album, I do hope that all Sandy's fans and those who know what's music will buy this album to listen the excellent songs again. When I found this homepage, I'm so glad that there are still so many Sandy's fans distributing all over the world though she hasn't any new songs for nearly 2 years. Sandy, we always support you. Hope you enjoy your family life with your husband and daughter!\n\nKenneth Wong (kennethwong@eudoramail.com)\n\nHong Kong, USA - Friday, January 22, 1999 at 15:26:45 (PST)\n\nim Sandy's fan......

Then the most concern about Sandy is whether she will continue her pop-music career or not. And i think at this stage Sandy 's career is getting into another kind of level ,not just aim for the best seller of album, awards..... but the best quality of music production. i hope that she will produce different kinds of music at different languages: Canto, English, Mandarin, Japanese....... i personally hope Sandy will co-operate and work with different people(not just Jonathan, Dick Lee, Anthony and Clarence Hui). And this might push her career into another high climax. Sandy, u are yur fans' most favourite singer(not Anita Mui, not Sally Yeh, not Faye Wong, not Cass Pang and not Sammi Cheng).\n\nBill Hui (Wilson)\n\nSt Leonards(Sydney), NSW Australia - Monday, March 09, 1998 at 06:27:47 (PST)\n\nThe news is not very updated.\n\nRandy Tan (randy.tw@pacific.net.sg)\n\nsingapore, singapore - Thursday, February 19, 1998 at 11:19:33 (PST)\n\nThe news is not very updated.\n\nRandy Tan\n\nUSA - Thursday, February 19, 1998 at 11:18:34 (PST)\n\nNice site you've got going, really proferssional!!!!

I think all of you would agree that Sandy is the best artist inside our hearts. I have brought all her Cantonese Album starting from \"The CITY RHYTHEM\" and all the Mandarian and the 2 Japanese ones. Sandy, please know we would support you forever! Though we don't have much time to see you in Hong Kong, even in other places, we are always missing you. Everytime some artists said their idol is Sandy, I will be so happy as we know Sandy's hard work and talent is all ascertained. It was so good to see Sandy in the SnowWolfLake. Her performance was perfect and I think no one can do better than her. We all know it is nearly impossible to see Sandy to perform SWL again, but the episodes of her performance are always in our mind. Sandy, you are the best! Please hard for your career and we would always love you, we swear.\n\nJoseph Tsang (h9715875@hkusua.hku.hk)\n\nHong Kong, China - Friday, November 14, 1997 at 23:31:56 (PST)\n\nI am Sandy Lam fans over 12 years & I love her very much!I love her songs & her character.

B'cause she is different to the others, she has concepts and style on every albums she issued before, from the city project that brings HK the western styled music(Dance beat R&B), the whole lot remix(the first singer to have re-mix album), the wildflower image(first to bring in chinese instrumentsto popmusic), and to day, she uses the totally different image, not the city female but a female that uses love to sensationalise her fans(like the recent CD love sandy, feeling perfect, I swear and wonderful world). Though she has been catching up by many new singers like Faye Wong, Cass Pang, Sammi Cheng, Kelly .... But she doesn't like them b'cause Sandy loves music and almost works hard to prepare her concert and music. Like the 1996 concert, her performane was perfect and fantastic. Compare to Sammi Cheng, Sandy is much better off at voice and experience. I hope her fans will love her forever and support her at every sec.\n\nWilson Hui (z2208537@.student.unsw.edu.au)\n\nSydney, Australia - Saturday, October 04, 1997 at 08:41:48 (PDT)\n\nThat ladybird below recommended this webpage to me.
