        "text": "China Broadway Entertainment announces its latest original global musical: Road to Heaven: The Jonathan Lee Musical. Adapted from the novel by internationally acclaimed author Li Xiuwen, the original musical will feature music by one of China's most iconic singer-songwriters Jonathan Lee.\n\nChina Broadway Entertainment once again brings together China's leading talents with a creative team comprised of some of the best talent Broadway and London's West End have to offer. Road to Heaven: The Jonathan Lee Musical will feature English lyrics by Tony Award winner Richard Maltby, Jr., (Ain't MIsbehavin', Miss Saigon, Fosse), book by John Dempsey (The Pirate Queen, The Witches of Eastwick), and direction by Eric Schaeffer (Gigi, Follies, Million Dollar Quartet). Don Frantz (Disney's The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast) is executive producer.\n\nOn December 12, 2017, The Tony Award-winning Signature Theatre in Arlington, VA (Eric Schaeffer, Founder and Artistic Director) will host a developmental reading of Road to Heaven: The Jonathan Lee Musical. Producer Ivy Zhong has engaged the American creative team to adapt Lee's original lyrics and Xiuwen's story into English allowing them to shape the material into a cohesive musical during its development in Arlington. Subsequently, Road to Heaven: The Jonathan Lee Musical will be translated back into Chinese for the world premiere in Shanghai in 2018. English-language productions are planned for New York and other cities throughout the U.S. following the Chinese premiere.\n\nRoad to Heaven: The Jonathan Lee Musical is the story of a beautiful young woman and her young, but terminally ill lover. Driven by an endless well of passion, she works five jobs, breaks the law and risks her life in her efforts to keep the man she loves alive. The timeless love story by Li Xiuwen is married together with some of the greatest hits from the Jonathan Lee songbook. In a career spanning nearly four decades, Jonathan Lee is known throughout Greater China as \"the godfather of popular music,\" In addition to producing his own chart-topping solo albums, Lee has written and produced songs for China's greatest pop stars and received 25 of China's most prestigious music awards, including seven Golden Melody Awards (the Chinese equivalent of The Grammy Award).\n\nFounded by Ivy Zhong in 2014, China Broadway Entertainment (CBE) has become a driving force in creating a new kind of global musical. After Zhong's success as a producer of the Tony Award-winning An American in Paris, CBE has curated intriguing, international creative partnerships between leading theater-makers from Broadway, Off-Broadway, regional theatre, the West End and China's leading artists to create musicals for new audiences. Recent productions have included The Secret directed by Tony Award-winning director John Rando (Urinetown, On the Town, A Christmas Story The Musical), and Neverland helmed by acclaimed American director Randy Weiner (Sleep No More, The Donkey Show). Other notable Broadway talent that Zhong has engaged for recent CBE productions include, award-winning producer Anne Hamburger (Spring Awakening, Artistic Director of La Jolla Playhouse), celebrated playwright and novelist Marc Acito (Allegiance), Tony Award-winning scenic designers David Gallo (The Drowsy Chaperone) and Beowulf Boritt (Act Two), and Tony-nominated costume designer Jason C. Woolard (West Side Story). Road to Heaven: The Jonathan Lee Musical is expected to be China Broadway Entertainment's most ambitious production to date.\n\n\"I could not be more delighted that China Broadway approached me about utilizing my songbook in such a new and exciting project,\" says Jonathan Lee. \"This is a New Medium for me and my music. The idea that my music can reach a new, global audience through the theatre is absolutely thrilling. I cannot wait to see how this incredible creative team interprets my music on the stage.\"\n\n\"We are truly honored that the legendary Jonathan Lee has entrusted us with his songbook for this exciting original musical,\" says Ivy Zhong. \"Road to Heaven: The Jonathan Lee Musical marks the latest creative marriage of Eastern and Western talent to be fostered by China Broadway Entertainment. With this project, a team of theater artists representing the best of Broadway, London's West End and American regional theater interpret one of China's great contemporary love stories though the music of China's legendary pop icon.\"\n\n\"The sources and inspiration for this musical come from China. The interpretation and development come from America. The goal is to create a new kind of musical theater experience that will be entirely universal,\" says Eric Schaeffer. \"The 'Broadway Musical' may be as American as apple pie, but its popularity continues to grow with audiences around the world. With Road to Heaven, we aspire to create a new kind of global musical that reflects the international appeal of this theater form.\"\n\nABOUT THE ARTISTS:\n\nJONATHAN LEE (Music & Lyrics) In Greater China (mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore), Jonathan Lee is a music icon, a household name, and known as \"the godfather of popular music.\"Although this guitarist, singer-songwriter and music producer may not as well known in North America, it would be difficult to find a person in the Chinese-speaking world who hasn't heard of Jonathan Lee.
