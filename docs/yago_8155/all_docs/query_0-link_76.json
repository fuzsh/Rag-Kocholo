She began her singing career in 1984 when she was signed to CBS Sony. Her first single was \"I Don't Know What the Love Is\". Sandy Lam has had a varied career, recording not only with CBS Sony in the 1980s, but also with Warner Music, Rock Records (Taiwan's largest independent label), Virgin Records, and now Capitol Music.\n\nSandy Lam rose to fame in Hong Kong in the mid 80s with a string of up-tempo Japanese style songs. She then transformed herself into a serious, progressive artist with the cosmopolitan \"City-Rhythm\" R&B album series. In 1991 she released the ground breaking coming-of-age \"Wildflower\" album to rave reviews, and triggered an \"unplugged\" craze in the Cantopop scene. \"Wildflower\" is considered one of the foremost Cantopop classics.\n\nLam gained instant popularity in Taiwan with her debut Mandarin release \"愛上一個不回家的人\" (Home Again Without You) in 1991. In 1995, she teamed up with Jonathan Lee, known as Taiwan's music godfather, and released her 4th Mandarin album Love, Sandy featuring a hit single \"傷痕\" (Scars), which became one of the all time best selling Chinese language albums. Since then Sandy has gradually moved beyond the Hong Kong music scene and spent most of her time in Taiwan, China, and Japan exploring new opportunities. Her 2006 Mandarin language album \"Breathe Me\" was recorded in Korea, Taiwan, mainland China and Hong Kong.\n\nLam returned to the music scene with a hit single \"至少還有你\" (At Least I've Got You) from her first album with Virgin in 2000. It was on the KTV Music Chart for 8 months. In December 2001 she released a Mandarin-language album entitled \"Truly Sandy\", on which she co-wrote four songs. In the same year, Lam appeared as cast member of an Andrew Lloyd Webber concert \"Masterpiece\", which also featured West End and Broadway star Elaine Paige and China's all-time best-selling recording artist, American-Chinese Kris Phillips. This concert was sold out with an audience of over 17,700 people.\n\nLam has won many awards in the course of her career, including Best Regional Performing Female Artist, Best Album, Best Female Vocalist, the Asia Pacific Most Outstanding Female Artist, and an honorary Music Award for her contributions to the music industry.\n\nSandy is now working on her 14th Cantonese album which is expected to be released in 2008.\n\nPrivate Life\n\nLam married Taiwanese singer-songwriter and producer Jonathan Lee in 1998, but the pair divorced in 2004. Together, they have a daughter Li Xi Er (李喜兒), whom Sandy gave birth on May 17, 1998. The year after the divorce, she was in a relationship with Chan Fai Hung, an employee for Gold Label Records until July 2006, citing her demanding schedules after her triumphant return to the Hong Kong entertainment circle. After her break-up, she returned to single life.\n\nAlbums\n\n* \"S/L\" (本色) [http://www.sandyandme.com/truecolour/truecolour.htm] - Released 10 November 2005\n\n* \"Breathe Me\" (呼吸) [http://www.sandyandme.com/breatheme/breatheme.htm] - Released 26 August 2006\n\nExternal links"
