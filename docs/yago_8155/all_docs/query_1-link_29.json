        "text": "Lam Yik Lin (林憶蓮, 林忆莲), also known as Sandy Lam, is a renowed Cantopop and Mandopop singer and actress from Hong Kong who has a high career standing in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, China, and other Asian regions.\n\nProfile\n\nStage Name: Sandy Lam (サンディ・ラム)\n\nCantonese Name: Lam Yik Lin (林憶蓮, 林忆莲)\n\nMandarin Name: Lín Yìlián (same characters)\n\nBirthdate: April 26, 1966 (1966-04-26) (age 58)\n\nBirthplace: Hong Kong\n\nAncestry: Ningbo, Zhejiang\n\nLanguages: Cantonese, Mandarin, English\n\nInformation\n\nSandy Lam was born in Hong Kong on April 26, 1966. She began her entertainment career at age 16 as a DJ for Commercial Radio Hong Kong before signing on to CBS Sony Records to achieve a career as a singer. She released her first album Lam Yik Lin in 1985, which garnered mixed reviews for Sandy's image meant to replicate a Japanese pop idol. She later changed her approach in 1987 with the release of Yik Lin, which was certified double platinum for selling 100,000 copies, and she began to earn success from her new image with her wild, curly hair as her trademark.\n\nSandy joined Warner Music in 1988 and released her Doi Sik Juk Gok trilogy albums from 1988 to 1990. In December 1990, she made her successful debut in Taiwan by releasing her first Mandarin album, Ài Shàngyīgè Bù Huíjiā De Rén. The next year, she released her ground breaking coming-of-age Ye Fa album in Hong Kong to rave reviews.\n\nSandy debuted in Japan in 1993 with her single, \"Dakaratte\" and released her first Japanese album Simple in 1994, followed by Open Up in 1995. Also in 1995, she signed with Rock Records and teamed up with Taiwanese singer-songwriter/producer Jonathan Lee to release her 4th Mandarin album, Love, Sandy, which became one of the all time best-selling Chinese albums and made her popularity extend to other countries in Asia, including mainland China. In 2000, she switched to Virgin Records and released Lín Yìlián's. The single, \"Zhì Shǎo Hái Yǒu Nǐ\" became a huge hit and dominated the Chinese music scene for up to 8 months.\n\nIn December 2018, she announced her retirement from the entertainment industry following the release of her last studio album \"0\".\n\nSandy has won many awards in the course of her career, including Best Regional Performing Female Artist, Best Album, Best Female Vocalist, the Asia Pacific Most Outstanding Female Artist, and an honorary Music Award for her contributions to the music industry.\n\nSandy and Jonathan Lee married in 1998, and had their daughter, Li Xi Er, on May 17. However, the pair divorced in 2004. The year after the divorce, she was in a relationship with Chan Fai Hung, an employee of Gold Label Records until July 2006, citing her demanding schedules after her return to the Hong Kong entertainment circle. She has been in a relationship with drummer and singer Jung Kun, 12 years her junior, since 2011.\n\nCantonese Discography\n\nAlbums\n\n[1985.04.xx] Lam Yik Lin (林憶蓮)\n\n[1986.03.xx] Fong Jung (放縱; Indulgence)\n\n[1987.02.xx] Yik Lin (憶蓮)\n\n[1987.08.xx] Fooi Sik (灰色; Grey)\n\n[1988.06.xx] Ready\n\n[1988.12.xx] Doi Sik Juk Gok Part I City Rhythm (都市觸覺Part I City Rhythm; City Project)\n\n[1989.10.xx] Doi Sik Juk Gok Part II Fuir La Cité (都市觸覺Part II 逃離鋼筋森林 Fuir La Cité; City Project)\n\n[1990.08.xx] Doi Sik Juk Gok Part III Faces And Places (都市觸覺Part III Faces And Places; City Project)\n\n[1991.02.14] Mung Liu, Fung Liu, Guen Liu (夢了、瘋了、倦了; Dreaming, Going Crazy, Tired)\n\n[1991.12.xx] Ye Fa (野花; Wildflower)\n\n[1992.10.xx] Wooi Loi Oi Dik San Bin (回來愛的身邊; Come Back to Love)\n\n[1993.04.29] Bat Yue Jung San Hoi Chi (不如重新開始; Begin Again)\n\n[1994.06.xx] Sandy '94\n\n[1996.01.15] Gam Gok Yuen Mei (感覺完美; Feeling Perfect)\n\n[2005.11.10] Boon Sik (本色; S/L)\n\n[2016.05.16] Pui Jeuk Ngo Jau in search of lost time (陪著我走; \"Stay With Me\")\n\nMini-Albums & EPs\n\n[1986.xx.xx] Sam Sui Hong (心碎巷; Heartbreak Mix)\n\n[1989.04.xx] Doi Sik Juk Gok Part I City Rhythm Take Two (都市觸覺Part I City Rhythm Take Two; City Project)\n\n[1990.04.xx] Doi Sik Juk Gok Ji Tui Tong (都市觸覺之推搪; City Project Dynamic Reaction)\n\n[1990.12.xx] King Che Do Si Siu Siu Siu (傾斜都市燒燒燒; Dance Mega Mix)\n\n[1996.10.08] Love Returns\n\n[2002.06.18] Encore\n\nMandarin Discography\n\nAlbums\n\n[1990.12.27] Ài Shàngyīgè Bù Huíjiā De Rén (愛上一個不回家的人; Loving for the Wanderer)\n\n[1991.10.xx] Dūshì Xīn (都市心; City Heart)\n\n[1993.05.19] Bùbì Zàihū Wǒ Shì Shuí (不必在乎我是誰; It Doesn't Matter Who I Am)\n\n[1995.01.25] Love, Sandy\n\n[1996.07.19] Yè Tài Hēi (夜太黑; The Night is Too Dark)\n\n[1999.01.28] Kēngqiāng Méiguī (鏗鏘玫瑰; Steel Roses)\n\n[2000.01.18] Lín Yìlián's (林憶蓮's)\n\n[2000.12.05] 2001 Lián (2001蓮; 2001 Lotus)\n\n[2001.12.06] Yuánlái...Lín Yìlián (原來…林憶蓮; Truly...Sandy Lam)\n\n[2006.08.26] Hūxī (呼吸; Breathing)\n\n[2012.09.20] GAIA (蓋亞)\n\n[2018.12.21] 0\n\nSingles\n\n[2000.??.??] Zhì Shǎo Hái Yǒu Nǐ (至少還有你; At Least I Still Have You)\n\n[2000.??.??] better man\n\nJapanese Discography\n\nAlbums\n\n[1994.03.10] Simple\n\n[1995.03.03] Open Up\n\nSingles\n\n[1993.10.27] Dakaratte\n\n[1994.02.09] Doushiteyo\n\n[1995.02.22] Pieces Of Mind\n\nEnglish Discography\n\nAlbums\n\n[1996.02.14] I Swear (Ài Shì Wéi Yī) (愛是唯一; Love Only)\n\n[1997.01.31] Wonderful World Měimiào Shìjiè (美妙世界; Wonderful World)"
