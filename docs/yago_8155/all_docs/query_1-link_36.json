        "text": "Sandy Lam Yik-Lin was born on April 26, 1966. She started out as a part-time DJ at HK Commercial Radio in 1982, and after she finished her schooling she went to work for them fulltime. Her music career was launched when she signed with a record company in 1984. Lam was initially packaged as a Sweet Sixteen cutesy teen idol, but she later cultivated a more sophisticated and mature image with the help of producer (and eventual ex-boyfriend) Clarence Hui. She also worked hard on improving her vocals and began infusing diverse music elements like jazz and R&B into her songs. This style change was well received by both fans and music critics alike and Lam was elevated to Pop Queen status.\n\nSince theres apparently an unwritten rule in Hong Kong that everyone who is anyone has to appear in the movies, Lam fulfilled the minimum requirement for a pop diva almost entirely during the earlier stages of her career. Lam made her official acting debut in The Intellectual Trio (1985), though she had had a very small cameo in Merry Christmas (1984) prior to that. Her largest role to date was in Gift From Heaven (1989) in which she plays a white-collar worker who, along with her co-workers, happens upon a bag of money with dubious origins. Lam made her final movie appearance in Shanghai Shanghai (1990), thereafter putting 100% of her attention into musical pursuits."
