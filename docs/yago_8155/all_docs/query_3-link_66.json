On August 10th, she will hold a \"MMXIL\" concert at Wukesong Arena Beijing.\n\nBRIEF INTRODUCTION\n\nSandy Lam, whose ancestral hometown is Ningbo, was born in Hong Kong and began her career at the age of sixteen, getting a job as a D.J. for Commercial Radio Hong Kong. She began her singing career in 1984 when she was signed to CBS Sony. Her first single was I Don't Know About Love. Sandy Lam has recorded not only with CBS Sony in the 1980s, but also with Warner Music, Rock Records (Taiwan's largest independent label), Virgin Records, and now Capitol Music.\n\nSandy Lam started her singing career in Hong Kong in the mid 80s with a string of up-tempo Japanese style songs. She then issued some \"City-Rhythm\" R&B tracks. In 1991 she released the ground breaking coming-of-age \"Wildflower\" album to rave reviews, part of the \"unplugged\" craze in the Cantopop scene.\n\nLam gained popularity in Taiwan with her debut Mandarin release \"Home Again Without You\" in 1991. In 1995, she teamed up with Jonathan Lee, Taiwanese music producer, and released her 4th Mandarin album Love, Sandy featuring a hit single \"Scars\", which became one of the all time best selling Chinese language albums. Since then Sandy has moved beyond the Hong Kong music scene and spent most of her time in Taiwan, China, and Japan. Her 2006 Mandarin language album \"Breathe Me\" was recorded in Korea, Taiwan, mainland China and Hong Kong.\n\nLam returned to the music scene with a hit single \"At Least I Still Have You\" from her first album with Virgin in 2000. A Korean remake of the song, sung by Super Junior-M, a sub-group of the K-Pop band Super Junior, was released in their Me album titled \"Tangshiniki-e\" in 2008. In December 2001 she released a Mandarin-language album entitled \"Truly Sandy\", on which she co-wrote four songs. In the same year, Lam appeared as cast member of an Andrew Lloyd Webber concert Masterpiece, which also featured West End and Broadway star Elaine Paige and China's all-time best-selling recording artist, American-Chinese Kris Phillips. This concert was sold out with an audience of over 17,700 people.\n\nLam has won many awards in the course of her career, including Best Regional Performing Female Artist, Best Album, Best Female Vocalist, the Asia Pacific Most Outstanding Female Artist, and an honorary Music Award for her contributions to the music industry.\n\nTickets for Sandy Lam Beijing Concert are Available now!"
