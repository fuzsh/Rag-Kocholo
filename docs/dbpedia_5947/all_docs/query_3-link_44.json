        "text": "Amna Nawaz:\n\nHurricane Debby barreled into Northern Florida this morning with Category 1 winds. The state has reported at least four deaths so far. Now a tropical storm, it's slowly moving inland, expected to hit Georgia and the Carolinas later this week.\n\nIts gusty winds are packing a punch, with hundreds of thousands of power outages reported. But authorities are most concerned about Debby's rainfall, which is expected to be historic.\n\nWilliam Brangham has our report.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis:\n\nThe most important thing to do is to just protect yourself and protect your family. Don't go out into this storm. Don't drive on the roads, particularly when they're flooded.\n\nWilliam Brangham:\n\nShortly after, authorities pulled a semitruck out of the water in Tampa after it fell over a guardrail, killing the driver.\n\nYesterday, in fierce winds, the U.S. Coast Guard had to pull two people out of the Gulf of Mexico after their sailboat was damaged. On land, wind whipped Florida's Western Peninsula, as Debby slowly crept along offshore.\n\nMan:\n\nIt was actually like pushing me. Like, literally, I was — I never had — like, was outside in a storm that was actually pushing me.\n\nJeff Berardelli:\n\nAnd that means rain falling over and over and over again over the same areas. And that means we could see two-and-a-half feet of rain in some places. And there's no place in the country that can handle that much rain in that period of time. There is going to be some dangerous and maybe catastrophic flooding in the Southeast.\n\nWilliam Brangham:\n\nAs Debby continues to churn north, residents of Georgia and the Carolinas are preparing for those potentially historic rainfall totals.\n\nJames Stallings, Director, Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency: That will be a generational storm that we have not seen. They're calling it a 500-to-1,000 year storm. And so, with that, we're extremely concerned about flooding.\n\nJeff Berardelli:\n\nWhat concerns me is this is yet again another billion-dollar disaster in the making.\n\nAnd we can only handle so many of these before people become wary, before we exhaust our resources. It's really hard to help the amount of people being affected by these big, extreme weather events. And it's really starting to wear on us."
