        "text": "TWIN FALLS, Idaho (KMVT/KSVT) — The College of Southern Idaho will have a new athlete from ‘The Land Down Under’ for the upcoming season.\n\nAmarco Doyle is set to join the CSI men’s basketball team.\n\nThe Queensland, Australia native expressed to KMVT his excitement about joining the Golden Eagles.\n\n“I can’t wait to get to Southern Idaho,” Doyle said. “I’m excited to play basketball for the team but also to enjoy the beautiful area with many waterfalls and the canyon.”\n\nDoyle brings vast experience to the team.\n\nHe was a silver medalist at the under-20 basketball Australia National Championships and was the under-23 Youth Player of the Year.\n\nDoyle was also selected for the Queensland state team.\n\n“Amarco is the great get late we were looking for,” CSI Head Coach Jeff Reinert said. “He has played against really good players the past two years. He can play inside and out and has improved his 3-point shot this last season. I love big guards and we’ve added some late that will help our rebounding inside.”\n\nPlaying in a league from a young age has helped prepare Doyle for the collegiate level.\n\n“You mature in basketball, playing with older guys that are from anywhere, from 20 to late 30s, even in age,” Doyle told KMVT. Playing with those teams helped me learn some simple tricks on the court, which has helped further my game.”\n\nEarlier in the summer, Doyle played on AAU tours in both Wichita, Kansas, and Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nHe earned an offer and would sign with Division II Seattle Pacific University in Washington. The NCAA however, wouldn’t allow him to play due to his amateurization.\n\n“I was stressed. I had less than a month to find a school and still needed my visa,” Doyle said. “CSI then reached out and we went from there.”\n\nTraveling across the world is never easy, but Doyle will settle in well.\n\n“I’ll miss my family and friends but I’m adaptive to places,” Doyle said. “The food will be most missed. I love a home-cooked meal.”\n\nDoyle is the sixth signee for the Golden Eagles this offseason. He joins Tanner Hayhurst, KJ Morrast, Cooper Kesler, Jalen Lyn, Khayri Dunn, and DJ Fizer."
