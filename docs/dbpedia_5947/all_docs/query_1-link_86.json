The Electronic Muscle Toning delivers a gentle impluse of the muscle via a soft rubber pad. Your muscles respond to this impulse by contracting and relaxing in a rhythmic way, just as they would during a tummy crunch or sit-up exercise. Generally two 45-minute sessions twice a week will yield optimum results in a matter of weeks.

With our sunshowers and lying down sunbeds, it's like having a remote for the sun.\n\nOPTIONAL EXTRA TREATMENTS.\n\nCellulite Treatment\n\nCellulite is fat deposit beneath the skin.
