        "text": "the core idea behind this project is to establish an equal relationship between the two connecting links to the urban area.\n\nthis was achieved by constructing two equal levels for arrivals and departures by raising the street in the extension of bühlstrasse towards bahndamm heading north, thus ensuring the accessibility for the trains on the same level as the arriving buses.\n\nfor southbound connections, a lift takes passengers to the lower level, which is an expansion of the landscape west of the railway embankment, extending below the train station area. a key feature here is the outstanding open view underneath the bridge to the other side. what manifests here is a spatial aggregation and an interweaving of landscape and urban space, for example, in the unmistakable tectonic design of the track components."
