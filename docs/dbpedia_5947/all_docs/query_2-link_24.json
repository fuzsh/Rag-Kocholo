Try to book as soon as possible to find some of the cheapest tickets, such as the Supersaver tickets and the Saver Day Pass, as they get snapped up quickly.\n\nAvoid rush hour\n\nTry to avoid rush hours in major Swiss and European cities. At busy times, tickets are usually more expensive and the trains are more crowded.\n\nTake advantage of discounts\n\nThere are a few discounts that can help you save money on ticket prices. For example, children under 6 travel for free, and those aged between 6-16 can purchase a half-price ticket.\n\nWhether you want to reach the centre of the main cities with high-speed Intercity and Eurocity trains, or prefer a slower yet still exciting journey with the InterRegio and Regio trains, travelling by train in Switzerland is a great opportunity for you to see some of the most spectacular views from the comfort of your seat.\n\nWant to discover the beauty of the Swiss Alps? Take the Glacier Express from Zermatt to St. Moritz or the Bernina Express from Tirano to Chur and get ready to enjoy some of the most breathtaking scenic train routes. Or perhaps you're traveling to Switzerland to ski? Check out these European ski resorts you can get to by train, including some in Switzerland.\n\nAnd if you’re thinking of traveling from Switzerland to other parts of Europe, there are also frequent cross-border train routes to popular destinations across Italy, France, Germany and Austria from train companies such as Trenitalia, TGV Lyria, Deutsche Bahn and ÖBB. For example, why not plan a train trip from Paris to Zurich, or travel from Paris to Geneva by train? The world is your oyster when you take the train.\n\nGeneva\n\nKnown by many as the headquarters of several international organizations, Geneva is a city that surprises its visitors. Traveling by train to Geneva Cornavin station, you’ll arrive at a recently renovated terminal featuring many shops and restaurants. You can easily reach the city center in around 15 minutes on foot or by hopping on a tram or bus. The entire main area of the city is surrounded by the impressive Lake Geneva, easily recognizable by its 140m water jet – one of the highest in Europe.\n\nNext, continue your visit to the Palais des Nations – the European headquarters of the UN – and take a wander around the large park that surrounds it, or visit the Cathedral Saint-Pierre and the Bains district, with its galleries and contemporary art shops.\n\nWant even more travel inspiration?

Known as Zurich HB, the station is the largest terminal in the country and connects Switzerland to major European cities. It also boasts a privileged location in the central district, between the Limmat River and Shil, directly opposite the Swiss National Museum.\n\nOne of the main advantages of traveling into Zurich station is that you’re within walking distance of most of the city’s main attractions.

The terminal is also located in the heart of the city near the old town – a UNESCO World Heritage Site – so make this your first stop!\n\nWander through Bern and experience the medieval architecture of Europe for yourself. Check out the cobbled streets, charming fountains and the famous Zytglogge (Clock Tower) with astronomical spheres moving over time. The city also has a modern side though, which you can see by visiting the Zentrum Paul Klee museum – totally avant-garde and worth the detour.\n\nMain train stations\n\nBern station\n\nStudent/budget travelers\n\nVisa requirements\n\nIf you hold a valid US, UK, AU, NZ or CA passport, you won’t need a visa if you’re staying in Switzerland for less than 90 days.\n\nIf you’re studying in Switzerland, you’ll need to apply for the visa that covers the amount of time you’ll be spending there.\n\nDiscounted train travel\n\nIf you know your travel plans ahead of time, book a Supersaver ticket or a Saver Day Pass to travel on SBB trains, or a Standard ticket (booked in advance) to travel on TGV Lyria trains.

They won’t be able to have their own seat, so will have to sit on your knee during the journey.\n\nFares for children aged 6 years and older vary depending on the rail company. In general, children under 16 can get half-price tickets.\n\nSBB’s Intercity and Intercity Tilting trains on long-distance routes come with a Family Zone in Second Class, where there’s more space for strollers.
