Additionally, travellers in first class benefit from quiet and business zones. Passengers can choose to travel first class aboard Swiss boats as well.

Rigi Railways make it possible: On mild summer nights, a panoramic cabin of the Weggis-Rigi cableway is transformed into the world’s one and only “Restaurant in the Sky”.

Across the country, numerous different culinary theme cruises are on offer – especially during the end-of-year festive season and on 01 August (Swiss National Day). On that special day, it is the “national sausage of Switzerland”, the Cervelat, that oftentimes takes pride of place.\n\nTaking a train ride and exploring real Swiss traditions at the same time – that’s what the theme routes are all about.\n\nFor the spontaneous at heart, a ride in the luxurious GoldenPass Belle Epoque coaches offers many culinary highlights: Between Zweisimmen and Montreux, selected wines and, on request, also a choice of local cheese and sausage specialities from the Lake Geneva region are served at the passengers’ seats.\n\nMore information about the cheese train\n\nDelicious, tenderly melting cocoa mass – Swiss chocolate is that good!
