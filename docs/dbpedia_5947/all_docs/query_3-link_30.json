        "text": "Fair season is in full swing in New York, and while the Hudson Valley boasts some of the best county fairs in the state, the largest celebration of all is the Great New York State Fair in Syracuse, NY. Luckily, there's a brand new way to get there.\n\nWithout personal transportation, it can be tough to get around New York State. While public options are available in New York City (as well as some Hudson Valley towns), long-distance travel is nearly impossible without a vehicle. Luckily, officials have recently announced an option for Hudson Valley residents looking to make the journey to the state fair without a car.\n\nDirect Route from the Hudson Valley to the New York State Fair\n\nThe Great New York State Fair runs from August 21st to September 2nd at the New York State Fairgrounds in Syracuse, NY. Hudson Valley residents looking to enjoy the biggest celebration of the summer can now skip the road trip and hop on a train instead, which brings travelers directly from Poughkeepsie, NY to the fairgrounds. Here's how it works:\n\nDirect Train to the New York State Fair\n\nAmtrak offers several train lines that will make specific stops at the New York State Fair, including the Maple Leaf and Empire Service Trains. While the trains originate in New York City, Hudson Valley fairgoers can book tickets from Poughkeepsie (train station code POU) to the fairgrounds in Syracuse (station code NYF). But is taking the train really more convenient than driving?\n\nTrain vs. Car Travel in New York State\n\nA press release from the governor's office espouses the environmental and financial benefits of choosing train travel over a car trip. Money can reportedly be saved on gas, tolls, and parking fees, and taking the train means one less vehicle will be on the road. As of publishing, the cheapest roundtrip ticket available for the train is $119 per-person. There's also the question of trip length.\n\nRead More: Why Do New York Rescue Animals Have Dots On Their Heads?\n\nA train trip from Poughkeepsie, NY to the New York State Fairgrounds takes roughly 4 hours and 25 minutes according to Amtrak's website. The fastest path by car is nearly an hour quicker, though both highway and fair traffic is not taken into consideration. But maybe neither money or convenience is the point of the trip after all..."
