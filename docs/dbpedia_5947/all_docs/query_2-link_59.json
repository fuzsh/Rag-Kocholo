        "text": "All information boards at Swiss railway stations will have a new design, after this project has already been implemented at Basel CFF and Biel/Bienne stations.\n\nGeneral signage, line access signs and electronic panels on platforms will be given a harmonised visual identity and additional headings, the state-owned CFF announced Tuesday in a post on its website.\n\nThis will make it easier for passengers to find their way around and provide more detailed information in the event of disruptions to rail traffic. The new design for electronic platform signs and line access indicators has already been in operation since the end of March at Basel CFF and Biel/Bienne stations. On this occasion, opinion polls were conducted among passengers for two weeks on the change. As the result was positive, all line access indicators and electronic panels on the platforms will be replaced by new generation ones from 2 May 2023. The general signage, installed at strategic locations at stations, will adopt the new visual identity by this summer.\n\nNew functions displayed on information boards in Swiss railway stations\n\nIn some stations, line access signs are placed high up near stairs, lifts and ramps. The new grey-coloured information bar indicates the sectors in which the carriages are located (e.g. 1st class, 2nd class or restaurant car).\n\nOn the other hand, a directional arrow to the left or right of the train indicates the nearest access. Trains with different final destinations are marked with a distinct colour and an explanatory text to make them easier to identify. From now on, the track access indicator additionally shows the next trains for a 25-minute interval and the respective platform.\n\nCFF currently has two generations of equipment in stations. The new design only covers the new-generation indicators; the others, which are not technically compatible with the new technology, will be replaced at the end of their life.\n\nShare on:"
