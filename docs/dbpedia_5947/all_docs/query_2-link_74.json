        "text": "Switzerland is famous for its railways. The trains in Switzerland are known to be on time, clean and frequent and very often they also offer superb views. In fact, Switzerland’s rail, bus and boat network is widely regarded as the best public transport in the world.\n\nThe Swiss public transport network is operated by more than 250 public transport companies including train, bus, boat and mountain railways. We’ll cover all the essential information you need to know to travel by public transport in Switzerland in this article.\n\nWith the Switzerland railway and public transport network being so efficient, travelling by train is generally the best way to travel in Switzerland for both locals and visitors.\n\nIn this train travel in Switzerland guide, we explain the difference between a Swiss rail pass and regular Swiss train tickets, give you details about the major train routes in Switzerland, tell you where you can find a Swiss rail timetable, where to buy your Switzerland train tickets and how to make your Switzerland train reservations online.\n\n[This post may contain compensated links. Please see my disclosure policy for more information.]\n\nQuick summary of the different Swiss rail tickets and Swiss rail passes available to tourists\n\nIndividual Switzerland Train Tickets vs a Swiss Rail Pass – Swiss Train Tickets Explained\n\nIn most cases when it comes to Swiss train tickets for tourists, you are going to be better off purchasing at least some form of Switzerland train pass rather than if you buy Switzerland rail tickets individually.\n\nWhen it comes to purchasing individual tickets for train journeys in Switzerland, there are many variables that determine the price. The main factor is when you book the tickets as well as the timing of the actual train travel.\n\nBooking last minute tickets tends to be most expensive, which means you can’t be very flexible with your travel.\n\nYou’ll also want to consider if you plan on doing any mountain excursions during your Switzerland travel as these day trips alone can make it well worth your while to purchase a pass.\n\nWe outline the various ticket and rail pass options below.\n\nSwiss Travel Pass\n\nThe most convenient ticket option for use on public transport in Switzerland for tourists is the Swiss Travel Pass. This is an all-in-one ticket for the entire public transport network and it acts just like a hop on hop off ticket.\n\nThe Swiss Travel Pass can be purchased for use on consecutive days or you can select a Swiss Travel Pass Flex which entitles you to a specific number of travel days within a one month period.\n\n🇨🇭 Read our detailed guide to the Swiss Travel Pass.\n\nSwiss Half Fare Card\n\nAnother popular option when it comes to Swiss rail tickets is the Half Fare Card. With the Half Fare Card, you can buy point-to-point train tickets with a 50% reduction.\n\nThe Swiss Half Fare Card is valid for one month and half price tickets can also be purchased for mountain top excursions, boats and buses.\n\n🇨🇭 Read our detailed guide to the Swiss Half Fare Card.\n\nPoint-to-point tickets\n\nShould you only plan to do one or two trips by public transport, and are only travelling a short distance, a normal point-to-point ticket can also be an alternative at a good price.\n\nWhen purchasing your point to point tickets, keep in mind that you need to specify the exact travel days. Subsequent changes or exchanges are not possible.\n\nIf you’re after cheap train tickets, Switzerland Railways sometimes have Super Saver Tickets available. There are a limited number of Super Saver tickets available on selected routes, which offer savings of up to 70%.\n\nSuper Saver tickets also have the option of first or second class travel as well as the additional half fare discount for holders of the Half Fare Card. These tickets (subject to availability) can be purchased between 1 and 60 days prior to travel.\n\nAgain, the Super Saver ticket is only valid for the selected date of travel.\n\nChild Fares\n\nIf you are travelling with children aged between 6 to 15 and not travelling with the Swiss Travel Pass, but instead with one of the other passes mentioned above or simply point to point tickets, it is recommended that you purchase a Junior Travel Card for CHF 30 for each child.\n\nThis card then allows children to travel free of charge alongside you. The card is valid wherever the Half Fare card is available and on many other transport services as well.\n\nIf you are travelling with a Swiss Travel Pass or Half Fare Card, you are better off obtaining the free Swiss Family Card as this entitles accompanied children to travel free of charge. We cover the Swiss Family Card in more detail in this article.\n\nWhere to buy Swiss train tickets and rail passes\n\nSwiss Travel Pass\n\nWe highly recommend you buy your Swiss Travel Pass online before you leave home. This means you avoid long queues at the ticket counter in Switzerland and you can also conveniently hop on the first train, tram or bus on arrival in Switzerland.\n\nWhilst you can buy Swiss Passes at most railway stations in Switzerland, buying your Swiss Travel Pass in advance also means that you can get this significant expense out of the way long before your vacation begins.\n\nThe Swiss Travel Pass is sent as a PDF via email so you can save it to your mobile device and print it out at home, which makes purchasing the Pass online super easy and convenient.\n\nClick here to purchase your Swiss Train Pass and then as soon you arrive in Switzerland you can start taking advantage of all the benefits that come with the pass.\n\nAlso just to note that the Swiss Travel Pass is only available to be purchased by people who permanently live outside of Switzerland.\n\nCLICK HERE TO BUY YOUR SWISS TRAVEL PASS\n\nSwiss Half Fare Card\n\nJust like the Swiss Travel Pass, we also recommend you buy the Swiss Half Fare Card online before you leave home. It can be purchased from any train station in Switzerland but you’ll skip the queues by buying it online.\n\nCLICK HERE TO BUY YOUR SWISS HALF FARE CARD\n\nPoint-to-point tickets\n\nIf you are only doing a few short journeys, buying train tickets in Switzerland is easy. Larger stations have manned ticket counters which are open at specific times throughout the day but all stations have ticket machines.\n\nThe ticket machines are easy to use – you can select to display the instructions in English – and payment can be made by credit card.\n\nYou can also purchase point-to-point tickets on the Swiss Federal Railways website or the SBB Mobile app.\n\nRegional Passes\n\nIn addition to the Swiss rail passes and point to point tickets mentioned above, there are other regional train passes in Switzerland for some of the more popular tourist regions in Switzerland.\n\nPasses available include the Jungfrau Travel Pass for the Jungfrau region, Berner Oberland Pass for the Bernese Oberland including Jungfrau region, and the Tell Pass for the Lake Lucerne region.\n\nThese passes can be purchased locally but we recommend you purchase them online before you leave home. This will save you having to queue to purchase your tickets on arrival in Switzerland. You can buy them via the following links:\n\nJungfrau Travel Pass\n\nBerner Oberland Pass\n\nTell Pass\n\n🇨🇭 Read our guide to choosing the best Swiss rail pass for your trip.\n\nSeat reservations on Swiss trains\n\nFor most trains in Switzerland you do not need any reservations. On some longer distance Swiss trains you can make a seat reservation if you prefer to but it’s not compulsory.\n\nOn Switzerland’s scenic trains it is mandatory to make a seat reservation. This applies to the Bernina Express, Glacier Express, GoldenPass Express and Gotthard Panorama Express trains.\n\nAlso keep in mind that if you are crossing into many of the neighbouring countries you will most likely require a seat reservation.\n\nIt is essential that seat reservations are purchased before travel.\n\nHow to make seat reservations on Swiss trains\n\nSeat reservations on regular trains\n\nIf you want to make a seat reservation for your train holidays to Switzerland you can do so via the SBB website, mobile app or at the ticket counter at a station.\n\nIf you’d like to guarantee a window seat on a specific train, for instance the Luzern-Interlaken Express, you may wish to make a seat reservation. It costs CHF 5 per seat to make a reservation on regular trains.\n\nSeat reservations on panoramic trains\n\nSeat reservations for the premium panoramic trains should be made directly on the official website of the train company. Seat reservations are compulsory for all passengers, including children (aged 6 and over) and holders of a Swiss Travel Pass.\n\nDue to the popularity of the Swiss panoramic trains, it is highly recommended that you book your seat reservation as early as possible. Seat reservations are available to purchase from 90 days before travel.\n\nYou’ll find more information about the panoramic trains, and links to our detailed guides which include step-by-step instructions for purchasing seat reservations, below.\n\nTravelling on public transport in Switzerland with a Swiss rail pass\n\nAfter purchasing any of the Swiss rail passes that we’ve mentioned above, you will receive an email with your valid pass as a PDF attachment.\n\nWe recommend saving the PDF to the wallet on your mobile device or taking a screenshot of it which you can save to your device’s photos. You should also print a paper copy and upload a copy to the Cloud, just in case your battery goes flat or your phone gets lost or stolen.\n\nIf you have purchased a consecutive day Swiss Travel Pass (or a regional pass), you do not need to validate or activate your pass before travel.\n\nHowever, if you have purchased a Swiss Travel Pass Flex, you must activate your pass prior to each day of travel. We cover the instructions to do this in detail in this article.\n\nTravelling by train – Swiss Travel Pass instructions\n\nOn boarding the train, you can sit in any free seat in the correct class of travel. For example, if you have a 1st class rail pass you can sit anywhere in a 1st class carriage.\n\nSeat reservations are not required on the majority of trains in Switzerland – exceptions are the premium panoramic trains, as we mentioned above.\n\nBefore boarding the train, look for the numbers 1 or 2 on the outside of each carriage so you know which carriage to get on.\n\nWhen requested by the ticket inspector, you’ll be required to show your Swiss Travel Pass or your regional pass. No other tickets are required except in the case of panoramic trains when you will also be requested to show your seat reservation.\n\nTravelling by bus – Swiss Travel Pass instructions\n\nMost of the buses in Switzerland operate under the ‘self-control’ model. This means, if you are travelling with a Swiss Travel Pass, you do not need to show the pass to the driver upon entry.\n\nYou may board through any of the doors and sit wherever you wish.\n\nRandom ticket checks do occur so it’s your responsibility to ensure you carry your valid Swiss Travel Pass (or regional pass, if applicable) at all times.\n\nThere are still a few smaller bus lines where you need to show your pass to the bus driver, but you will notice when this is the case. In these instances there is only one door open (the front door) through which you can board.\n\nNOTE: Most buses and some trains (particularly regional trains) do not automatically stop at each station en route. These stations are marked as ‘stop on request’ on timetables.\n\nIf you wish to stop at the next approaching station, you need to press the ‘stop’ button which you’ll find throughout the bus or train carriage.\n\nTravelling by boat – Swiss rail pass instructions\n\nSwiss Travel Pass holders do not need to purchase any additional tickets for most boat trips in Switzerland. You can simply board the boat and sit in the correct class – the upper deck is for 1st class passengers and the lower deck is for 2nd class passengers.\n\nShow your Swiss Travel Pass (or regional pass, if applicable) to the ticket inspector when requested.\n\nTravelling by mountain railway – Swiss rail pass instructions\n\nIn order to board a mountain railway (cable car, funicular or cogwheel train), in many instances you need to proceed past the ticket counter and through a turnstile.\n\nAs a ticket is often required to be inserted into the turnstile in order for the gate to open, we recommend you stop at the ticket counter to present your rail pass, even if the ride is fully covered by your pass.\n\nThe ticket counter representative will either wave you through (if no access ticket is needed), issue you with the necessary ticket (if the ride is fully covered by your pass), or request payment at the discounted rate applicable to your rail pass.\n\nYou can see which mountain excursions are free and discounted with the Swiss Travel Pass here.\n\nTravelling on public transport in Switzerland with a regular Swiss train ticket\n\nWhen travelling by train in Switzerland it is essential that you purchase your ticket before boarding. On most trains there is no ticket machine or conductor on board so you must have your ticket before entering the train.\n\nWhen requested, show your ticket (and seat reservation if you are travelling on a panoramic train) to the ticket inspector.\n\nBus tickets can be purchased from the driver upon entry. You should enter through the front door of the bus.\n\nTickets for boats and mountain railways can be purchased at the ticket counter before boarding.\n\nRandom ticket checks do occur and heavy fines apply to passengers who do not have the correct ticket.\n\nYou may sit in any free seat (in the correct class of travel) on trains*, buses, boats and mountain railways.\n\n*except panoramic trains\n\nTaking luggage on Swiss trains\n\nAlthough there is not a huge amount of space for storing luggage on Swiss trains, most trains do have a dedicated luggage storage area in the area close to where you board the train.\n\nSome trains also have space under and between the seats where luggage can be stored.\n\nThere are also overhead racks above the seats where you can place small luggage.\n\nHow much luggage can I bring?\n\nWhilst there is no restriction on the Swiss trains as to how much luggage you can bring, it is highly recommended that you limit yourself to a medium sized suitcase and one piece of hand luggage or a backpack.\n\nThere is no porter service in Switzerland so you have to take care of your luggage. You are required to bring your own luggage to the platform and to carry it onto the train.\n\nHowever, there is always a ramp or an elevator or an escalator at the station and step-free access to the platform. For this reason, a suitcase with wheels works perfectly.\n\nLuggage shipping services\n\nIf you would prefer not to have to travel with your luggage, SBB offers a luggage shipping service. This can be a good option if you’d like to ship some of your luggage ahead for the next part of your vacation, or you’d like to stop off en route to do some sightseeing.\n\nThere are a variety of luggage shipping options available, such as:\n\nLuggage from station* to station* (2 days later): Take your luggage to a station* and 2 days later collect it from your destination station*.\n\nLuggage from door to door (Same day or next day): They will collect your luggage from an address in Switzerland and deliver it to your address. This is great for hotel to hotel luggage transfers.\n\nLuggage from station* to door (2 days later): Take your luggage to a station* and they will deliver it to your address 2 days later.\n\n*not all stations offer this service.\n\nUseful information about the best public transport system in the world in Switzerland\n\nAdvantages of train travel in Switzerland\n\nTraveling by train in Switzerland has many advantages. Not only is Switzerland train travel a wonderful way to see the beautiful countryside and stunning Swiss Alps, it is also the most efficient and often the cheapest way to travel in Switzerland.\n\nHere is a brief overview of the advantages of traveling by train through Switzerland:\n\nCentre to centre – travel in Switzerland by train is super convenient with pretty much the entire country well serviced and stations are located right in the centre of town.\n\nTravel like the locals – when you take a Switzerland train ride, you will be getting around just as the Swiss do.\n\nRelaxing – Rather than driving a hired vehicle for your Switzerland trip, sit back and relax, while you are transported to wherever you need to go. A train ride through Switzerland is extremely comfortable and a great way to relax on your holiday.\n\nFrequent – The Swiss Federal Railways are extremely efficient and trains are very regular. You’ll rarely wait long for any connections for your train trips through Switzerland.\n\nScenic – Switzerland would have to be one of the most beautiful places in the world to travel by train – the landscape is absolutely perfect for train travel. The Swiss rail network goes right past the most scenic landscapes including all the stunning lakes, snow capped mountains, flowing streams and quaint little villages. In Switzerland it’s certainly more about the journey rather than the destination.\n\nThe Swiss Rail Network\n\nThe Switzerland train system is just brilliant, with the entire country well-connected enabling you to pretty much travel anywhere you wish. The Swiss rail system is said to be the world’s densest railway network and the trains are well connected with other forms of public transport.\n\nThe entire public transport system operates with a fully integrated timetable which means there are seamless connections between Swiss rail, bus, boat, tram and mountain railway services.\n\nMajor train routes in Switzerland\n\nBelow we have listed the details of some of the major Swiss train routes.\n\nZurich to Lucerne train: A direct journey time between 45 minutes to just over 1 hour depending upon the train.

For instance, if you are wondering ‘where is first class on Swiss trains?’, the app can tell you exactly whereabouts on the platform the first class and second class carriages will stop.\n\nAll information is displayed in real time so if there’s a delay (which is rare in Switzerland) or you’d like to follow your journey live, you can do so on the app.\n\n🇨🇭 Read our guide to using the SBB Mobile app when you travel Switzerland.\n\nPanoramic Trains in Switzerland\n\nFor many people on holidays in Switzerland, a trip on a Switzerland scenic train is at the top of the must-do list.\n\nA panoramic train in Switzerland takes you through some of the most beautiful regions in all of Switzerland, with many of the trains having specially built panoramic windows to maximise your view.\n\nBelow you’ll find an overview of these scenic train routes in Switzerland.\n\nGlacier Express\n\nThe Glacier Express is referred to as the “world’s slowest express train” and is also known as one of the most scenic train rides in Switzerland.\n\nThis scenic train in Switzerland runs between St Moritz and Zermatt and crosses 291 bridges and passes through 91 tunnels.\n\nThe entire scenic train of Switzerland trip is just over 8 hours and runs twice a day during the Winter months and four times a day during the Summer months – however please note that only two trains complete the entire journey.\n\nSeat reservations are compulsory on the Glacier Express – even for Swiss Travel Pass holders – and start at CHF 39 per person.\n\n🇨🇭Read our detailed guide to the Glacier Express.\n\nGotthard Panorama Express\n\nRunning between Lucerne and Lugano, this panoramic train of Switzerland starts by taking a cruise across Lake Lucerne in a steamboat before passengers board the train at Flüelen.\n\nEn route you will pass through the world’s longest tunnel.\n\nThe entire train trip through Switzerland takes 5.25 hours and runs once a day Tuesday through to Sunday during the months of late April to late October.\n\nSeat reservations are compulsory for all passengers and cost 16 CHF.\n\n🇨🇭Read our guide to the Gotthard Panorama Express.\n\nBernina Express\n\nThis iconic Switzerland rail journey takes you from the medieval city of Chur across the Swiss Alps to Italy.\n\nThe train journey passes through the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Rhaetian Railway as well as through 55 tunnels and crosses 196 bridges before ending at Tirano.\n\nFrom here you can take the Bernina Express Bus through the Valtellina wine region before arriving in Lugano.\n\nThe entire journey takes almost 7.5 hours (4.25 on the train and the remaining time on the bus).

They include power outlets to charge your mobile devices.\n\nSecond class seats are less expensive, but not as spacious as there are more seats per car, and often these will be in a compartment-style layout with two bench seats (each seating three people) facing each other.\n\nMeals and snacks can be purchased from a dining car or snack cart.\n\nSecond class coaches often have more passenger than first class coaches as more Europeans tend to travel in second class.\n\nQuiet Zones\n\nA quiet zone can be found in first class coaches on certain routes. The areas are well marked and in these areas you should refrain from talking, making phone calls, listening to music (even with headphones) or playing any games on electronic devices.\n\nWiFi\n\nWhilst there is no free WiFi on Swiss trains, you can use your smartphone as a personal hotspot. You will need a compatible SIM card with data to access the 3G/4G network.\n\nFree internet access is available at 80 railway stations in Switzerland. The service is limited to 60 minutes.\n\nOnboard Restaurants and Bistros\n\nIf you’ve wondered “can you eat on Swiss trains?”, the answer is most definitely yes. Most InterCity and EuroCity trains have a restaurant or bistro onboard.\n\nPassengers can usually eat at the restaurant or take it away to their seats. Passengers in first class also have the option of being served at their seat on some trains.\n\nThe Family Coach\n\nFor families travelling with young children, you are going to want to visit the family coach – which is basically a playground on the train. All double decker InterCity trains on long distance routes have a family coach.\n\nYou’ll know if a family coach is on your train as it will be marked on the timetable with ‘FA’.\n\nInterCity tilting trains don’t have the Family Coach but they do have board games available for families at the games tables specially provided on board.\n\nThe Family Zone\n\nAnother great area for families on single deck InterCity or InterCity tilting trains are the family zones. These areas have much more room for prams, and parents can relax not worrying about their children being too loud and distracting other passengers.\n\nYou’ll find the family zone at the very front or very rear of the train.\n\nFAQs about train travel in Switzerland\n\nHow far in advance can I book my Swiss train tickets?\n\nLike budget airlines, the cheapest fares are usually available to those that book early, therefore it is recommended that you make your reservations as soon as you possibly can.\n\nMost Swiss trains, including the panoramic trains, can be booked 90 days prior to travel.\n\nWhere can I find a Swiss train timetable?\n\nUp to date Swiss train timetables can be found on the Swiss Federal Railways website, on the handy SBB Mobile app or you can pick one up from the nearest station.\n\nDo I need seat reservations on Swiss trains?\n\nNo, in general for most trains in Switzerland you do not need any reservations.

Some stations in Switzerland are huge and it can take a while to get your bearings and get to the correct platform. At really busy stations where there are trains arriving and departing every few minutes, the platform number from which your train is departing may not be advised until 20 minutes before departure. As soon as the platform number is displayed, there’s a huge crush to get there, so give yourself plenty of time.\n\nCheck the overhead boards for the correct train number and the platform from which your train departs. Remember that the destination on the board may be further along the line than you are travelling, therefore your destination may not show. Each train has a train number, just like a flight number, for this purpose. Always match the train number on your ticket to the train number on the overhead board.\n\nWhen purchasing an individual (or point-to-point) train ticket, you are usually allocated a specific seat in which to sit and the seat number and carriage number will be printed on your ticket. This applies to most trains however some regional trains which only offer second class carriages are ‘non-reserved’ and you can sit anywhere you like.\n\nAt the platform, check for signs showing where each carriage will stop. The train layout is displayed at most stations and is also in the SBB app. If you are in coach (carriage) #06, for example, some stations have signs showing at which point on the platform coach #06 will stop. In the photo below you can see that coach #06 will stop at Section V on the platform, so by waiting in the correct area, you will be in the right place when the train pulls up. Smaller stations may not have such specific signage but will usually show you where the 1st class and 2nd class coaches will stop.\n\nStopping times at stations can be short – three or four minutes is not uncommon. Be ready to board the train (or join the boarding queue) as soon as the train arrives at the station. When lots of people are trying to board the train with heavy luggage it can be congested, so be prepared. If you’re travelling with children or older folks, let them board first without their luggage and pass all the luggage up to them once they are on the train.\n\nMost train services in Switzerland are precisely on time! In most instances they arrive at the station at exactly the time they are scheduled to, so don’t be late.\n\nMake sure you know the name of the station at which you should disembark in the local language. Lucerne is called Luzern and Geneva is called Geneve, for instance.\n\nIf you are purchasing a ticket locally or don’t have a seat reservation for your journey, make sure you are boarding the correct carriage of the train. Some trains split at a designated station during their journey with the engine and the front carriages continuing to one destination whilst another engine is attached to the remaining carriages and travels to another end station. In these instances, each carriage usually displays a sign on the outside indicating the end station it is travelling to.\n\nFinal thoughts about train travel in Switzerland\n\nWe hope this guide to travelling by train in Switzerland has given you a better understanding of the Swiss rail system. Getting around Switzerland by train is a relaxing and scenic way to travel between destinations.\n\nWhether you choose to purchase point-to-point train tickets in Switzerland or buy a Swiss rail pass for your travels, you’ll be impressed by the efficiency and punctuality of the Swiss public transport system.\n\nListen to our podcast episode about the Swiss public transport system\n\nPIN FOR LATER\n\nSwitzerland Travel Essentials"
