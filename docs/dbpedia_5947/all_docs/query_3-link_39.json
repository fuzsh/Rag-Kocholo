        "text": "Our Band Could Be Your Life\n\nThe Handsome Daughter, 61 Sherbrook St.\n\n• Friday, 9 p.m.\n\n• Tickets $15 plus fees\n\nMichael Azerrad’s (excellent) 2001 book Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981–1991 shone the spotlight on trailblazing punk and independent rock bands carving their proverbial paths across America (and beyond) and went on to influence countless artists who have come since.\n\nAmong the baker’s dozen of bands covered by Azerrad are Black Flag, Hüsker Dü, Dinosaur Jr. and Mudhoney, and on Friday, local acts will come together at the Handsome Daughter to pay tribute to three other groundbreaking bands featured in the book.\n\nFold Paper will be playing the music of seminal D.C. post-hardcore band Fugazi; members of Kandekt, Booter and Blessed will be cranking out tunes by Minneapolis rockers the Replacements; and members of Strawberry Punch and Merin will come together to rip through songs by New York noise rockers Sonic Youth. Between bands, all your favourite indie rock and hip hop tunes from the ’90s will keep the party going.\n\n— Ben Sigurdson\n\nSleepy the Clown comes to town\n\nInkster Junction Station on Prairie Dog Trail off Park Royale Way\n\n• Sunday, 11 a.m. departure; 2.45 p.m. return• Adult tickets $36.95 for adults, $29.95 for children, under two free at tickets.pdcrailway.com\n\nHop on the Prairie Dog Central Railway from Inkster Junction Station for a 50-minute ride on a diesel locomotive to the rural community of Grosse Isle for a front-row seat to watch Sleepy the Clown in action as he juggles, performs magic tricks and cracks jokes that will make even the sternest of faces dissolve into smiles.\n\nWhen the show is done, take a stroll through the Heritage Village in Grosse Isle and visit the 1886 Ridgeway Heritage House with its many antiques and artifacts on display. Don’t forget to pop into the restored East Rosser one-room school house, the old Gunton Station and Grosse Isle United Church.\n\nBefore heading back to the station for your return journey at 2.45 p.m., visit local vendors who will be selling crafts, souvenirs, food and drinks.\n\n— AV Kitching\n\nPaint ’n’ Sip Morning\n\nDalnavert Museum and Visitors’ Centre, 61 Carlton St.\n\n• Sunday, 10 a.m.\n\n• Tickets $30\n\nSpend a serene Sunday morning at Dalnavert Museum, engaging in the art of painting en plein air. Participants will start with a beginner-friendly watercolour tutorial, capturing the garden’s vibrant beauty with a mimosa in hand.\n\nThe historic Dalnavert house will be open, inviting painters to step inside and explore its history and period interiors at their leisure.\n\nTickets start at $30, with a special rate of $25 for members. Enhance the experience with a $5 mimosa (with or without alcohol) or a mini brunch plate. Extra drinks will be available.\n\nIn case of rain, the event will move indoors to the visitors’ centre. More information and tickets at friendsofdalnavert.ca.\n\n—Thandi Vera\n\nMatteo Lane\n\nClub Regent Event Centre\n\n• Thursday, 8 p.m.\n\n• Tickets $40-$101 at Ticketmaster\n\nA funny thing happened on the way to the opera: classically trained singer Matteo Lane — he has a six-octave range — studied opera in Italy (not to mention oil painting and drawing at the School of Art Institute of Chicago) before making a detour to standup comedy.\n\nNow the sarcastic New York-based comedian, whose sharp observational material often revolves around his experiences as a gay man, is an in-demand performer who has appeared at Just for Laughs and on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Late Night With Seth Meyers and the HBO series Crashing. He hosts the Snapchat comedy Ghost Hunt, performs regularly at New York’s the Comedy Cellar and has 1.6 million followers on TikTok and Instagram.\n\nHe brings his tour to the casino tonight; a few tickets remain.\n\n— Jill Wilson\n\nCEC releases new EP\n\nThe Handsome Daughter, 61 Sherbrook St.\n\n• Saturday, 8 p.m.\n\n• Tickets $19 at cecmusic.ca\n\nSultry rhythms, Latin grooves and smooth vocals are thrown into the fire on Free Burn, the latest EP from CEC, released on Aug. 2. The collection is a confident introduction from the singer-guitarist-producer, who just wrapped up a master’s degree in music and culture from Carleton University.\n\nOn Aug. 10, CEC celebrates their release at the Handsome Daughter with support from Taylor Jackson and HAVS.\n\n— Ben Waldman"
