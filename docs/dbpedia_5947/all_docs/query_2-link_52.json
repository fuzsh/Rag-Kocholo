        "text": "You know how it goes.\n\nYou land in a new country, get the stamp in your passport, grab your bag and make it through customs. Next, you try to figure out how the public transport system works around here to make your way into the city.\n\nBut all those options can be overwhelming and you have about a million questions you don't know the answer to.\n\nShould you have booked your train ticket in advance? Are trains even a thing here or are buses more popular? Should you buy tickets as you go or would a travel pass work out cheaper?\n\nThat‘s where this guide comes in. By the time you’re done here, you’ll know just as much, if not more than the average Swiss about the public transport system in Switzerland.\n\n1. The public transport system of Switzerland\n\nPublic transport in Switzerland is efficient, (mostly) punctual, and literally all over the place.\n\nIf you sum up all the railway tracks running across this little country, you’ll end up with over 5.300 kilometres (3.300 miles).\n\nThat’s a lot.\n\nThat’s the distance from Vancouver to Halifax. Or from Ushuaia to São Paulo. Or from Cairns to Sydney. Return. Quite impressive for a country half the size of Lake Superior, isn't it?\n\nSumming up all means of public transport like buses, trains and Postauto lines, the whole network contains roughly 29.000 kilometres (18.000 miles) and looks something like this:\n\n2. Means of public transport in Switzerland\n\n2.1 Trains in Switzerland\n\n2.2 Long distance buses in Switzerland\n\nLong-distance buses aren't really a thing in Switzerland. The Swiss are a (proud) nation of train riders. 🙂\n\nHowever, bus companies have been on the move across Europe lately and it is now possible to travel within Switzerland by bus. Check the Flixbus or Eurobus websites to find your connection.\n\nWhile long-distance buses are definitely cheaper than trains, they come with a few downsides.\n\nTrains run several times per hour between major cities, while buses only run a couple of times per day.\n\nBuses take a lot longer to reach their destination than trains because they drive more slowly and get stuck in traffic.\n\nA bus ticket ties you to a specific service. This means you can't spontaneously travel at a different time, which is possible by train.\n\n2.3 Postauto buses in Switzerland\n\nNo corner of the country is too remote to have one of those iconic, yellow Postauto buses running through. The yellow lines on this map don't even come near to covering their whole territory.\n\nTo dig a little deeper into this extensive network, visit the regional section on the Postauto website.\n\nWhile Postauto buses are very common and popular in remote regions and villages, they also serve most cities and their suburbs.\n\nAs the name suggests, they were originally used to transport mail. But over time, Postauto gradually started carrying people as well, which is all they do nowadays.\n\n2.4 City buses in Switzerland\n\nIn addition to Postautos, cities and certain bigger villages also have their own local bus network. You can find a list of all local bus lines on this website.\n\nCity buses often run quite frequently. Especially in larger cities. Depending on the size of the city and the time of day, you’ll see anything between 30-minute down to two-minute intervals.\n\n2.5 Trams in Switzerland\n\nTrams aren't that widely spread in Switzerland and the only places with notable tram networks are Zurich, Basel, Bern and Geneva.\n\nTrams are in charge of connecting the cities as well as their suburbs to the centre. They usually run quite frequently – sometimes up to every two minutes. In Basel, there's even a tram running across the border to Weil am Rhein in Germany.\n\nA little word of warning from a country girl 😊 Trams can be an aggressive species and if you'd like to do ensure your physical wellbeing, look out for them in the city centres. They have a tendency to favour honking over breaking.\n\nAs they do all over the world, I suppose.\n\n2.6 Passenger ships in Switzerland\n\nWith all those lakes and rivers, it only makes sense that passenger ships are another easy way to get around Switzerland. Where there's a white line on this map, there's a passenger ship or a ferry.\n\nSince those ships are quite slow in comparison to all the other means of public transport, they're not really used by commuters. So if you're in a hurry to get from one place to another, maybe skip this one.\n\nHowever, if you have time and fancy taking in some stunning views or even embark on a steamboat, visit this website to find out more about everything that's available.\n\nPlease be aware that it can get quite crowded during summer on a sunny day. While I've never run into the situation where they stopped letting people on board, it might make sense to be at the pier a few minutes before departure.\n\nOn a little side note, services don't run with the same timetable all year round. Make sure you double-check the departure time before you set out on your cruise.\n\n2.7 Cable cars in Switzerland\n\nTechnically speaking, cable cars aren't part of the public transport system and most of them don’t get any financial support from the government. Nevertheless, they still deserve their spot on this map in the shape of black lines.\n\nTo use a cable car, you usually have to buy some sort of an extra ticket. And those are rarely cheap.\n\nHowever, most cable cars accept the most common travel passes, which I will talk about further down in this post. So make sure you show them any kind of ticket or travel pass you might already have.\n\n2.8 FAQ: What people also ask about public transport in Switzerland\n\nIs public transport in Switzerland expensive?\n\nUnfortunately, it is. Quality definitely has its price here.\n\nLuckily, there are a few ways to optimise your travel costs by buying a travel pass or a Supersaver Ticket.\n\nI will talk about both of these in the next sections of this post.\n\nWhat's the difference between first and second class coaches on Swiss trains?\n\nThere are two main differences between first and second class coaches on Swiss trains. Price and legroom.\n\nA ticket in the first class costs up to 75% more than the same journey in the second class does.\n\nIf you prefer more legroom and some extra peace and quiet, you might prefer the first over the second class.\n\nIs it worth travelling first class on Swiss trains?\n\nGenerally speaking, our second class coaches are of very high quality and if you travel outside of rush hour, you should have no problems feeling comfortable in a second class coach.\n\nHowever, if some extra peace and quiet and more legroom is a priority to you, you will enjoy your journey more by travelling first class. Just factor in the considerable 75% price difference.\n\nHow long does it take to travel across Switzerland by train?\n\nNot long at all.\n\nWith Switzerland being so small, it takes just under four hours to travel from St. Gallen to Geneva and less than three hours from Basel to Lugano.\n\nIf you travel with the fast intercity trains, that is.\n\nOf course, there are slower and more scenic trains that take longer. But if you're starting your trip in Zurich, it will take you no more than one to two hours to reach any other major city in Switzerland.\n\nHow do I know when my train, bus, Postauto or ship leaves?\n\nThe best way to find your timetable is by using the SBB website or the SBB app.\n\n3. Tickets on Swiss public transport in general\n\n3.1 One journey = one ticket\n\nIn Switzerland, it doesn't matter which company or means of transport you travel with. The price will always be the same. You pay for your journey from one place to another, regardless of who runs it.\n\nFor example, if you go from Zurich to Zermatt, you need to change trains in Visp. The first part of your trip is operated by SBB, while the second part belongs to MGB (Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn). But your ticket from Zurich to Zermatt covers both rides.\n\nThe same goes if part of your journey is operated by a different means of transport. Let’s say you travel from Zurich to Stein in the Appenzell region. After getting off the train in St. Gallen, you need to change to a Postauto bus. Your ticket from Zurich to Stein covers the whole journey.\n\n3.2 Tickets are flexible and never sell out\n\nTickets are valid for a certain time span and not for a specific service. If you buy a ticket from Bern to Zurich, you’re free to take any train leaving from Bern to Zurich on the day of travel. You're also free to get off along the way and continue your journey later that day.\n\nTherefore, tickets aren’t limited and reservations aren't necessary. Whether you buy it two days or two minutes in advance, you’ll pay the exact same price. This doesn't go for Supersaver Tickets, but we'll get into that later.\n\n3.3 Have your ticket when you get on\n\nOnce you're on the train, you need to have a valid ticket in your pocket. On certain trains, you can buy one from the ticket collector but I only suggest doing that in an emergency as it costs you extra.\n\nIf you see the sign below, it means you can't buy a ticket on the train and you'll pay 100 CHF if they catch you without one.\n\nWith buses and Postautos, it's a different story. You have the option to buy a ticket on board – either at the ticket machine or directly with the driver.\n\n4. Your ticket options\n\n4.1 Point-to-point\n\nWhat is it?\n\nIf you travel between cities that aren’t part of the same fare system (more about that later), you need a point-to-point. This allows you to catch any train running between your origin and destination, either one way or return.\n\nYou don’t have to use it for a specific train and once you begin your journey, you can get off along the way\n\nThe point-to-point ticket is best for you if you are...\n\ntravelling between cities\n\nnot using public transport on a regular basis\n\nonly in Switzerland for a short amount of time\n\nExample\n\nWith a ticket from St. Gallen to Bern, you can get off in Zurich and hop back on whenever you’re ready.\n\nYou’re free to add on as many stops as you like. As long as you don’t miss that last train to Bern because one-way tickets are only valid for one day.\n\nWhere can you buy it?\n\nAt the ticket counter: The easiest place to buy your ticket is at the counter. They sell any ticket imaginable and answer your questions about public transport.\n\nAt the vending machine: Alternatively, pick one of the many SBB vending machines standing at every train station.\n\nOnline: The SBB website lets you buy tickets with or without creating an account. You can either print your ticket or display it in the SBB app. The app will ask you for an account, though.\n\nThrough the SBB App: The SBB app is a tool I recommend to anyone travelling through Switzerland. It lets you buy tickets, displays your online tickets and comes with an extensive timetable feature.\n\n4.2 Zone Ticket\n\nWhat is it?\n\nSwitzerland is split up into over 20 fare networks. Each of them consists of several zones and if you travel within one of those networks, you need a Zone Ticket instead of a point-to-point ticket.\n\nThe Zone Ticket is best for you if you are...\n\nusing local transport within a fare system\n\nonly in Switzerland for a short amount of time\n\nstaying in the same area and not visiting any places outside the fare system\n\nExample\n\nTo get from Zurich airport into the city, you’ll be travelling within the fare network of ZVV. In this case, you need a ticket for all the zones between the airport and the main station.\n\nDepending on how many zones your ticket is for, you have between one and two hours to use it on any means of transport within those zones.\n\nWhere can you buy it?\n\nZone Tickets are available in the same places as the point-to-point tickets. You can either go through the counter, the vending machines, the SBB website or the SBB app.\n\nYou have some extra options here, though.\n\nPostauto and city buses: To get your Postauto or bus ticket, pick one of the following options:\n\nVending machine at the bus stop (in and around cities)\n\nVending machine inside the bus (in and around cities)\n\nPay the driver (in more remote places)\n\nIf you don’t already have a ticket once your bus arrives and you can’t see a vending machine anywhere, just get on through the front door and ask for a ticket.\n\nTrams: Every tram stop has a vending machine because you can’t buy a ticket from the driver.\n\nShips: Not all companies are part of a fare network but certain Zone Tickets are valid for ships as well. To make sure you get the right ticket, I suggest getting one on board or at the counter by the pier.\n\nShow them all your (local) tickets so they can give you your cheapest option.\n\n4.3 City Ticket\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThe City Ticket is a combination of the two tickets above and is only available for certain participating cities. It comes in handy if you combine an intercity trip with a local journey.\n\nThe City Ticket is best for you if you are...\n\nusing local and intercity transport in the same journey\n\nnot using public transport on a regular basis\n\nonly in Switzerland for a short amount of time\n\nExample\n\nIf you travel from Lausanne to a place somewhere in the city of Bern, you catch the intercity train for the first part of your journey. Once you’re in Bern, you change to the local city bus or the tram. The City Ticket covers both rides.\n\nIt also works the other way round, where you use local public transport only in Lausanne and then add the point-to-point ticket to Bern.\n\nAnother version of the City Ticket is the former City-City Ticket. Quite the mouthful, I know.\n\nA while ago, this one got integrated in the assortment of the City Ticket. With this one, you have the option to add your local transport to your intercity journey in both your starting and ending point.\n\nWhere can you buy it?\n\nLike the point-to-point ticket, you can buy the City Ticket at the counter, most vending machines at the train station, the SBB website or the SBB app.\n\nBuying a City Ticket works out slightly cheaper than buying two separate tickets. Savings range between 2 and 3 CHF for the whole journey.\n\n4.4 Supersaver Ticket\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThis one is worth its weight in gold. Most long distance connections come with a limited amount of Supersaver Tickets. Discounts are sometimes up to 70% off.\n\nThe catch? The Supersaver Ticket is tied to a specific train. You lose the flexibility of using any train you want and there’s no getting off along the way. They also sell out at some point because they’re so popular. Once you know your exact travel dates, it pays off to check for Supersaver Tickets right away. They’re available 60 days in advance.\n\nIn case you miss your connecting train due to a delay of your previous one, let the ticket collector know. Ideally before you get off at the station. He'll confirm the train's delay and hand you a piece of paper, which you can show along with your Supersaver Ticket on the next train.\n\nIf you spontaneously decide to catch a different train, you can get a refund. However, going through this process is a bit of a hassle and costs 10 CHF. So I only recommend getting a Supersaver Ticket if you're sure to travel on that specific day and time.\n\nThe Supersaver Ticket is best for you if you...\n\nare travelling between cities\n\nknow ahead of time when you’ll be travelling\n\ndon’t mind losing the flexibility of hopping on any train you like\n\nare not using public transport on a regular basis\n\nare only in Switzerland for a short amount of time\n\nWhere can you buy it?\n\nYou can only buy Supersaver Tickets through the SBB website or the SBB app. With both options, you have to go pretty far into the buying process to see if special offers are still available.\n\n4.5 Swiss Half Fare Card\n\nWhat is it?\n\nStrictly speaking, the Swiss Half Fare Card is not a ticket. Like the name suggests, it’s a card that gives you 50% off every ride. Everyone in Switzerland who uses public transport on a regular basis owns one.\n\nThe classic Half Fare Card is valid for a whole year but visitors can buy the Swiss Half Fare Card for one month. It costs 120 CHF, which seems like a lot for a discount card. However, since ticket prices aren't cheap in Switzerland, it pays off fairly quickly.\n\nThe Swiss Half Fare Card is best for you if you are...\n\nusing point-to-point tickets, Zone Tickets, City Tickets, City-City Tickets or Day Passes on a regular basis\n\nonly in Switzerland for a short amount of time\n\nWhere can you buy it?\n\nYou can buy the Swiss Half Fare card online or at any ticket counter. All you need is your passport or your identity card.\n\n5. Travel Passes\n\n5.1 SBB Day Pass\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThe SBB Day Pass is great if you’re covering a lot of ground in one day. It costs 75 CHF and is only available for Swiss Half Fare Card holders.\n\nTo make most of this pass, you really have to travel far, though. Unless you cut across the whole country in a day, you’re better off buying a normal ticket.\n\nWith the National Day Pass, you have access to every means of public transport in Switzerland.\n\nThe National Day Pass is best for you if you are...\n\ntravelling long distances within one day (long in terms of Swiss relations 🙂 )\n\na Swiss Half Fare Card holder\n\nnot using public transport on a regular basis\n\nonly in Switzerland for a short amount of time and a multi-day travel pass wouldn’t pay off.\n\nWhere can you buy it?\n\nYou can buy the SBB Day Pass online or at any ticket counter.\n\n5.2 Saver Day Pass\n\nWhat is it?\n\nIn September 2017, the supersaver version of the National Day Pass was released. Prices vary and if you have a Half Fare Card, the Saver Day Pass costs between 29 CHF and 59 CHF.\n\nWithout a Swiss Half Fare Card, expect to pay between 52 CHF and 106 CHF.\n\nSales open 6 months in advance and since this pass is so popular, the cheapest options sell out quickly.\n\nThe Saver Day Pass is best for you if you are...\n\ntravelling between cities\n\nwell organised and know ahead of time what day you’ll be travelling\n\nnot using public transport on a regular basis\n\nonly in Switzerland for a short amount of time\n\nWhere can you buy it?\n\nYou can only buy the Saver Day Pass online or through the app, but not through any ticket machines or at the counter.\n\n5.3 Regional Day Pass\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThe Regional Day Pass is basically a Zone Ticket that's valid for a whole day. As usual, you get 50% off with the Swiss Half Fare Card.\n\nMost fare networks give you a discount on your Regional Day Pass if you set off after 9 am. To find which network has a 9 o’clock pass, check their website.\n\nWhere can you buy it?\n\nLike the Zone Tickets, you can buy the Regional Day Pass online, at the counter, the vending machine (at the train station, inside the buses or at the tram stop), directly from the bus driver, the SBB website or the SBB app.\n\nThe Regional Day Pass is best for you if you are...\n\nusing public transport within one fare system several times a day\n\nonly in Switzerland for a short amount of time\n\nstaying in the same area and not visiting any places outside the fare system\n\n5.4 Swiss Travel Pass\n\nWhat is it?\n\nApart from including every means of public transport across Switzerland, the Swiss Travel Pass also serves as a ticket to over 500 museums.\n\nThis pass is available for 3, 4, 6, 8 or 15 consecutive days and you don’t need a Half Fare Card to get one. If you’re under 25 years old, you get a 30% discount.\n\nIf you need some help deciding if you should buy the Swiss Travel Pass or not, I've written an article about the subject.\n\nI don’t suggest using the Swiss Travel Pass right after you buy it unless you travel far. Once you validate it, every following day counts. If you land in Zurich and spend your first days in the city, a Zone Ticket works out cheaper than using your Swiss Travel Pass from the get-go.\n\nThe Swiss Travel Pass is best for you if you are...\n\nare using public transport on a regular basis\n\nare planning on seeing every corner of Switzerland without having to worry about buying tickets\n\nare travelling several days in a row\n\nlike museums\n\nWhere can you buy it?\n\nYou can buy the Swiss Travel Pass either at the counter or directly here online.\n\n5.5 Swiss Travel Pass Flex\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThe only difference between the Swiss Travel Pass and the Swiss Travel Pass Flex is the fact that the it's a little pricier and doesn’t require you to use it on consecutive days. Instead, you can travel on 3, 4, 6, 8 or 15 days of your choice within a month.\n\nIt also comes with a 30% discount for under 25-year-olds and serves as a museum ticket on your travel days. To figure out if this pass is for you or not, read my article about this subject.\n\nThe Swiss Travel Pass Flex is best for you if you...\n\nare using public transport on a regular basis\n\nare planning on seeing every corner of Switzerland without having to worry about buying tickets\n\ndon’t want to travel every day but rather keep your itinerary flexible\n\nlike museums\n\nWhere can you buy it?\n\nYou can buy the Swiss Travel Pass Flex either at the counter or directly here online.\n\n5.6 Interrail Pass\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThis popular rail pass for Europeans comes in two versions: the Global Pass and the One Country Pass.\n\nBoth allow you to use all SBB trains as well as several other companies. Certain private companies, like for example the BOB between Interlaken and Grindelwald, aren’t included, though. But they offer a 25% – 50% discount to pass holders.\n\nSince the Interrail is a popular train ticket, you’re on your own when it comes to local transport. Buses, trams and most ships aren’t included.\n\nOn a plus side, Interrail gives you several benefits. Like a free bus ride from Munich to Zurich, 15% off 43 selected Swiss Youth Hostels and much more.\n\nThe Interrail Pass is best for you if you are...\n\nEuropean\n\nnot staying long enough to make a Swiss Travel Pass pay off\n\nmainly using the major railway companies\n\nplanning on seeing every corner of Switzerland (that's accessible by train) without having to worry about buying tickets\n\nWhere can you buy it?\n\nYou can buy an Interrail Pass through your travel agency at home, ticket counters across Europe or directly here online.\n\nDepending on the pass you buy and with all the restrictions it comes with, Interrail works out 40% to 50% cheaper than the Swiss Travel Passes.\n\n5.7 Eurail Pass\n\nWhat is it?\n\nEurail is the equivalent to Interrail for non-Europeans. With the difference that Eurail doesn’t offer a One Country Pass for Switzerland. Instead, you can get a Global Pass for your Swiss trip.\n\nThe Global Pass covers 33 European countries for different time spans. Starting at 4 days within a month and ending with three months continuous.\n\nAs with Interrail, there are a few restrictions and certain private companies, like for example the BOB between Interlaken and Grindelwald, aren’t included. But they offer a 25% – 50% discount to pass holders.\n\nThe Eurail Pass is best for you if you are...\n\nnon-European\n\nnot staying long enough to make a Swiss Travel Pass pay off\n\nmainly using the major railway companies\n\nplanning on seeing every corner of Switzerland (that’s accessible by train) without having to worry about buying tickets\n\nWhere can you buy it?\n\nYou can buy your Eurail Pass through your travel agency at home, ticket counters across Europe or online.\n\n6. Decision time\n\nCongratulations. You now know just as much, if not more, than the average Swiss about your ticket options in Switzerland. The only thing that’s left to do is pick your best match.\n\nMy recommendation to get this process started is to make a rough outline of your itinerary, figure out where you want to go and use the SBB timetable to calculate prices for each leg of your journey. That way, you'll soon see which travel pass best suits you or if you're better off buying tickets as you go.\n\nActually, I've prepared a spreadsheet for you. This should help you make a decision whether or not buying a Swiss Travel Pass or a Swiss Half Fare Card makes sense in your case."
