        "text": "Although Switzerland is not a member of the EU, it is one of the constituent countries of the Trans-European Network for Transport, since it is crossed by the Rhine - Alpine corridor and located in a central point on the routes between northern and southern Europe. Additionally, it is a major objective to improve the crossing of the Alps both for passengers and freight. Transit through the Alps is made possible by the Gotthard and Lotschberg base tunnel projects.\n\nInfrastructure Managers\n\nIn Switzerland, there are two Infrastructure Managers. They are at the same time Railway companies which operate their own network. In addition, an agency (Trasse CH) is responsible for traffic allocation on the Swiss network.\n\nSwiss Federal Railways (SBB-CFF-FFS) is the biggest Swiss railway company, managing the majority of national and international services. The length of its network that belongs to the Rhine - Alpine corridor is approximately 520 km:\n\nSchweizerische Bundesbahnen (SBB) – Network Statement (Track access conditions)\n\nBLS (Bern-Lötschberg-Simplon) is the other leading Swiss rail company. It manages another major Alpine route between Bern and Brig, via the Lötschberg Base Tunnel. This route is also part of the Rhine - Alpine corridor.\n\nBLS Network Statement\n\nNational implementation plan\n\nThe Swiss National Implementation Plan (NIP) was delivered in 2017. It is fully compliant with the ERTMS European Deployment Plan, except for the cross-border sections, which could be at risk of not being completed on time.\n\nAccording to the Swiss NIP:\n\nThe network will have mixed ERTMS levels; some lines will be equipped with ERTMS Level 1, such as the Muttenz – Rothrist line, and others with ERTMS Level 2, such as the Lausanne – Villeneuve line.\n\nSince the beginning of 2018, new vehicles no longer need the SIGNUM Class B system, and ZUB because ETCS Level 1 Limited Supervision Swiss (LSCH) includes packet 44 (EuroSIGNUM/EuroZUB).\n\nNational Implementation Plans (NIP) country by country\n\nNational Safety Authority"
