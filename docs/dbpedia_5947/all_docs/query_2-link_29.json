        "text": "Trains are the backbone of Switzerland's mobility. 1.25 Million people are using the trains every day (population of Switzerland is 8.6 Million), and they have a good reason to do so:\n\n1672 railway stations\n\n3303 miles of rails (5317 km)\n\nthe densest rail network in the world\n\nat least half-hourly service between large cities\n\nat least an hourly service on the rural lines\n\nThere is no need to be stuck in traffic and having to concentrate on driving instead of enjoying the views or using the time to be productive.\n\nFrom entire school classes enjoying their field trip in the second class coaches to business people using the comfortable first-class coaches to work during their commute. Traveling by train is deeply rooted in Swiss society.\n\nFirst-class vs. second class\n\nOn my tours, we travel for your comfort in the 1st class.\n\nFirst-class carriages are available on all regular trains.\n\nIt may be a little bummer, but no, there will be no free-flowing champagne, like in first-class on an airplane.\n\nThe benefit of the 1st class on Swiss trains is that you get more space and comfort. You will have more legroom, a broader, and a more comfortable seat.\n\nWhen traveling with regular flexible tickets, the ticket price for 1st class is almost the double price of a second class ticket. As a result, the occupancy rate in this class is lower.\n\nPlease note that mountain railways and aerial cable cars don’t have a class separation.\n\nEat and drink\n\nOn all regular trains, you are allowed to eat and drink — another benefit over bus tours, where food and drink are often not permitted.\n\nThe food does not need to be purchased on-board. You can buy a snack and sandwiches at the station or a take-away breakfast from your Hotel, and eat it on-board.\n\nHere you can enjoy your sandwich with a one of a kind scenery and arrive free from hunger at the destination. This flexibility is a significant benefit, especially when you are traveling with children.\n\nOn a group tour, you may need to use their already short stops to buy and eat snacks, since you will not be able to eat again once you are on the bus.\n\nOn the mountain railways and aerial cable cars to the peak, food is often not allowed;\n\nhowever, the travel time is short (15-45 minutes).\n\nOne train - two destinations\n\nSpace is limited in Switzerland, and so are the tracks for the train. To reduce the in- and outbound frequency, some trains have two sections, each of them going to another destination. At some point during the journey, the sections will get detached, and they travel on a different route to their final destination. Listen to the announcements and the information displayed on the departure board to find the correct sector.\n\nOn some trains, not all the carriages go all the way to the final destination. Listen as well to the announcements and check the departure board.\n\nOccupancy rate\n\nOn weekends the occupancy rate is usually pretty low. Train lines to popular hiking or skiing places can be pretty busy.\n\nOn weekdays the train lines between the cities can be bustling during the rush-hours.\n\n(6.30 AM - 8.30 AM and 4.30 PM to 7 PM).\n\nIf you travel during the rush hour, a first-class ticket is a good investment, especially when you have luggage.\n\nParticularly busy is the train line between Zurich and Bern, the capital of Switzerland.\n\nOn the busiest routes, there are often relief trains or trains which take a slightly different route but offer much more space. I'm happy to assist my customers with schedules, travel- and ticket recommendations for other train journeys.\n\nTrains to mountain peaks are often jam-packed, especially on sunny days\n\nduring the peak travel time summer and winter months.\n\nThe lowest occupancy rate has the Gornergrat railway in Zermatt since this village is far away from Zurich, car-free, and does not focus on mass tourism.\n\nThe highest occupancy rate has the Jungfraujoch railway.\n\nPeak travel time:\n\nSummer season: Beginning of May to the beginning of September\n\nWinter season: December & January\n\nTraveling with dogs\n\nDogs are welcome on Swiss Trains and mountain railways. However, they require as well a train ticket at the half-fare rate (children’s ticket). For longer distances, there is a dog pass available for CHF 35.- which allows unlimited travel on the trains (excluding mountain railways and aerial cable cars).\n\nThere is one exception; small dogs with a wither height of 30 cm (11.8 inches) or less can travel with you free of charge, provided that they are in a carrier, basket, or another suitable container that does not occupy a seat.\n\nIf the dog has a train ticket, they can move freely; however, they can only be placed on a seat when they are in a suitable container.\n\nSWISSDAYTOURS with dogs\n\nMost of my tours are not suitable when traveling with a dog as the travel distance is too long. However, I do have a few suitable tours. Please get in touch so that we can find the perfect tour for you and your dog.\n\nSwiss Travel Pass (STP)\n\nThe Swiss Travel Pass is a special ticket for visitors and only available to people who are not a resident of Switzerland or Liechtenstein.\n\nIt allows you to travel unlimited on all regular trains, boats, and local transportation. Three mountain railways are included. These are currently the Mt. Rigi railway, the Cabrio cable car to Stanserhorn, and the Stoos funicular.\n\nOn other mountain railways and aerial cable cars, you get between 20-50% discount on the ticket with the STP. The STP is also valid on special trains, like the Bernina Express; however, there is a seat reservation fee, which needs to be paid additionally and purchased in advance.\n\nThe STP is available for 3, 4, 6, 8, and 15 days.\n\nThere are two different versions:\n\nthe regular Swiss Travel Pass = the travel days are consecutive\n\nthe Swiss Travel Pass Flex = you can choose your travel days within 30 days.\n\nTravelers up to the age of 24 can purchase the STP youth and youth Flex, which costs a bit less.\n\nYou can purchase the Swiss Travel Pass at any staffed train station or only on the website of the Swiss Federal Railways.\n\nSince all online purchases are not refundable, the Pass is sold in unlimited quantities, and as the prices are fixed, I recommend getting the STP upon arrival.\n\nTo purchase your Swiss Travel Pass, you will need your Passport. The Passport number will get noted on the Swiss Travel Pass and is only valid in conjunction with your ID. Therefore you will need to carry your Passport with you while traveling with the STP.\n\nIf you plan to travel only for a day on the trains, then the STP will not bring you any savings. Should you plan to use the trains and other public transport frequently and on multiple days, the Swiss Travel Pass can save you a lot of money.\n\nSwiss Family Card\n\nThe free add-on to the Swiss Travel Pass for families\n\nIf you are purchasing the Swiss Travel Pass, you can get the Swiss Family Card for free. With this card, your children can accompany you for free. This also applies to mountain railways. For special trains (like the Bernina Express), there is still a seat reservation fee if the child requires an own seat.\n\nThe Swiss Family card is valid for all children who have not had their 16th birthday at the time of travel.\n\nChildren who have not reached the age of six yet, generally travel for free, even without this card."
