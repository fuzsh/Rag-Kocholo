        "text": "The Swiss Federal Railways (Schweizerische Bundesbahnen), in the German-speaking part usually referred to by the abbreviation SBB, is very well organized, convenient, and takes you almost everywhere. Intercity trains connect Zurich directly to various cities in Switzerland or abroad. Regional trains and the S-Bahn (suburban rail) network also include stops in-between the larger cities. SBB has a useful app for checking timetables and purchasing tickets via smartphone.\n\nSBB\n\nHalf-fare travelcards (Halbtax)\n\nWith the Half-fare travelcard you can travel half price on the entire Swiss public transport network, including all SBB railway routes, busses, boat and ferry crossings and even many private and mountain railways. Half-fare travelcards can be purchased at railway stations, you just need to bring a recent photograph and a valid identification document. If you’d like to buy a travelcard online, you’ll need an electronic picture, your ID or passport number and a credit card.\n\nSBB half-fare travelcard\n\nGA travelcard\n\nIf you’re a frequent traveler or intend to travel longer distances, you might consider purchasing a GA (Generalabonnement), which allows unlimited travel on all SBB railway routes, busses, boat and ferry crossings and numerous private and mountain railways.\n\nSBB GA travelcard\n\nPoint-to-point travelpass\n\nIf you're commuting to Zurich from outside the canton of Zurich, a point-to-point travelpass might be an option as well. This is only valid on a particular route. It’s recommended to carefully compare prices, as for instance a Bern-Zurich travelpass is more expensive than a GA, which allows unlimited travel on all routes.\n\nSBB point-to-point travelpass\n\nseven25 travel card\n\nIf you’re under 25, then the seven25 travelcard might be a good addition to a half-fare travelcard. It allows for unlimited travel on trains and other public transporting Switzerland (including the ZVV network) from 7pm to 5am in 2nd class.\n\nSBB seven25 travelcard\n\nSupersaver Tickets\n\nOne possibility to save money on train trips is by buying a supersaver ticket, where discounts reach to up to 50 per cent. This kind of ticket is available only 30 days before the date of your trip and is only valid for the selected train connection."
