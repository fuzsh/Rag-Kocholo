        "text": "He looks like a panda and a Disney princess had a baby.\n\n— Glenn, \"Magazine Profile\".\n\nJonah Richard Simms was a sales associate at Cloud 9 Store #1217 in St. Louis, Missouri. He is an optimistic and helpful worker, who always tries to find the \"moments of beauty\" in every day. However, he can be immature, a know-it-all and comes from a rich family. Jonah was born in Chicago (he mentions he is 26 in \"Shadowing Glenn\", but mentions he was 28 when he flunked out of business school in season one's \"Secret Shopper\"). He has two older brothers, one named Josh and was thoroughly spoiled as a child, and also attended private school. He is portrayed by actor Ben Feldman.\n\nCharacter History[]\n\nSeason One[]\n\nJonah is hired by Dina who is attracted to him and she continually flirts with him. He encounters Amy, is attracted to her and embarrasses himself a number of times in front of her. Glenn welcomes new employees Jonah and Mateo to the store. After Jonah makes a major pricing mistake, the staff are gathered in the Break Room to review what can be learned from the error. Jonah surprises Amy with a ceiling show to break up the daily monotony. When Cloud 9 magazine reporter Cynthia visits the store, Jonah tries to help Glenn make a good impression but upstages Glenn so much that Cynthia has a fling with Jonah.\n\nJonah is taken advantage of by store pharmacist Tate to the point that Tate has Jonah performs many medical duties he isn't trained for. Amy teases Jonah by posing a mannequin that looks like Jonah various ways and when Jonah tries to get her back, he embarrasses himself. When Amy brings her daughter Emma to work, Jonah takes care of her and helps her through her first period. After destroying the Warehouse, Jonah and Amy reveal details about their lives to each other.\n\nJonah meets Amy's husband Adam during the store sales competition and ends up selling him items he can't afford. When locked in the store all night, Dina invites Jonah to the Photo Lab and propositions him but he says no due to her being assistant manager. Dina resigns from management and asks Jonah out. After he is involved in a forced kiss with Dina, he plays a phone message for her saying he doesn't want to date her, which Dina surprisingly moved on quite easily with, instead going on a date with another man. Jonah is upset Cheyenne doesn't get paid maternity leave and after Glenn is fired for giving her paid \"suspension\" he and Amy organize a walk out of the staff in protest.\n\n\"Pilot\": Jonah races shopping carts with Glenn and Garrett. His ceiling stars help create a romantic mood that results in Cheyenne / Chey accepting Bo's wedding proposal.\n\n\"Magazine Profile\": A reporter, Cynthia, from corporate magazine \"Stratus\" comes to the store. Jonah impresses the reporter which has a negative impact on Glenn. Cynthia comes onto to Jonah in the Stock Room and Jonah goes to her hotel room after his shift is done to have sex with her.\n\n\"Shots and Salsa\": Jonah believes that he is a helpful person and to demonstrate, offers to help Tate the pharmacist carry some flu shot boxes. Tate takes full advantage and tells Jonah to retrieve more boxes while he gets a coffee. At the Pharmacy, Tate is bragging to Jonah, makes him his assistant and tells him to prep the first patient. Tate leaves and tells Jonah to give a biker his flu shot. Jonah sterilizes the arm of the biker and with shaking hands, tries to give him the shot. The biker yells at him and is then seen running out, holding his arm and crying. An elderly woman in the line-up asks Jonah how much longer the wait will be. He brings her to the front of the line and when other customers protest, she makes a racist remark. After watching a training video on racism, there's only one flu shot left and many customers so Tate abandons Jonah. His shift over, Jonah backs away from the angry pharmacy customers and leaves. Dina plays guitar and sings a Mexican love song at a salsa sample booth while looking suggestively at Jonah to the point he is uncomfortable. In the parking lot, Amy is sitting at a patio set eating salsa and chips and is joined by Jonah.\n\n\"Mannequin\": The staff are enjoying a rest in the Break Room and Jonah says he feels like he is fitting in. However, he manages to unintentionally insult Garrett's disability and implies Amy looks pregnant. As Cheyenne talks about how hard it is to work while pregnant and how she got pregnant because she couldn't get a ride to planned parenthood, Jonah offers her a ride in the future which prompts Glenn to express his abortion views. This starts an argument with Dina which Jonah watches, wishing he'd never started talking. In the store, Garrett and Amy look at a mannequin which they think looks like Jonah. Jonah thinks it looks like Tom Cruise so they tease him about his ego. In the Break Room, the staff have dressed the mannequin to look like Jonah complete with vest and name tag. They affect Jonah's mannerisms and sayings with the mannequin and though he tries to join in the fun, it falls flat. After Jonah calls Amy the \"responsible one\", she re-doubles her efforts to prank him and to show she is fun. She dresses the mannequin in various costumes and poses. Jonah finally snaps and carries the mannequin into the Stock Room and tries to destroy it in a compacter. In the Stock Room, Jonah has over-loaded the compacter which has tripped the alarm. Glenn sees the mannequin legs sticking out and freaks out thinking Jonah has put a person in. Jonah tries a feeble prank with a blonde mannequin. Garrett and Amy catch Jonah in the Break Room dressing up a sex doll that looks like Amy. The doll is partially naked and Jonah looks like a pervert. In the parking lot, Jonah says he knows why Amy was dressing up the mannequins - it was an initiation.\n\n\"Shoplifter\": Garrett and Jonah find an old man, Charles, asleep on one of the store's couches. They try their best to wake him and find that he is dead. Jonah is loading cans and is told by a girl he's doing it wrong. The girl is Amy's daughter, Emma who's at the store because her babysitter cancelled. Jonah watches Emma and keeps her hidden. Emma goes to the bathroom and Jonah finds she's had her first period so he helps her out while trying to find the right aids to use. Later, Jonah and Emma are playing a video game and she casually mentions Jonah taught her to use a maxipad.\n\n\"Secret Shopper\": With word that a secret shopper will visit the store, Jonah tells everyone he achieved a perfect score on the corporate test. Amy asks Jonah to stock charcoal in the Patio department but he points out that corporate wants this in Grocery. Jonah stacks charcoal in Grocery while Glenn worries about the secret shopper. Amy asks Jonah why he disobeyed her and Glenn vouches for putting charcoal in Grocery not wanting to make any mistakes. Mateo says Jonah might be the secret shopper as Garrett said it may be an employee, so Glenn calls him into his office and laughs nervously at him. He asks a bewildered Jonah if he is in trouble and then asks for a raise which Jonah says he deserves. Glenn is overjoyed and shares sour candy with Jonah. Over the P.A. system, Amy asks Jonah to report to Patio and they proceed to have an argument over the P.A. for all to hear. In the Warehouse, Jonah seeks an apology from Amy and tries to help her operate a forklift. They end up bringing down the shelving and share some personal details. Jonah accidentally looses the forklift into the store where it chases Mateo Liwanag.\n\n\"Color Wars\": During the store's sales competition, Jonah is having a hard time selling customers things they don’t need so Amy takes him aside to tell him the Red team knows about the $100 prize and he needs to step it up. Following Amy's direction, Jonah chats with a man who is checking out an expensive BBQ. He calls his wife who turns out to be Amy, though Jonah doesn't know this. Amy doesn't have time to talk to Adam so Jonah points out that he tried to tell her about the buying the BBQ and convinces him to make the purchase. Adam shows Jonah his real-time BBQ Youtube channel which leads Jonah to convince him to also buy a new TV. Jonah tells Amy that he's sold $2000 of merchandise though Amy doesn't know her husband is the purchaser. At the checkout, Garrett points out to Jonah that the BBQ purchaser is Amy's husband. Jonah tries to talk Adam out of his purchases and offers to pay for them himself until Amy catches them. Adam and Amy argue and Jonah slips away. At the party for the winning team, Amy opens up to Jonah about her marriage.\n\n\"Wedding Day Sale\": While shopping for their wedding, Bo gets scared and runs off. To take Cheyenne's mind off Bo, Jonah and Garrett help her shop for wedding items but become competitive over the item selection. Garrett likes traditional items while Jonah likes the opposite. Jonah and Garrett argue over a green or white wedding dress but Cheyenne backs away and finds a dress on her own.\n\n\"All-Nighter\": When locked in the store all night, Jonah gets an anonymous text to go to the Photo Lab. He finds Dina there, made up and in a tight dress. Dina shows Jonah a memo from corporate and closes her eyes expecting a kiss. Jonah says he doesn't want to date his boss and lies that if she wasn't management he would. Dina is disappointed but understands. Jonah catches Amy walking on a checkout belt and she tells him she got into a good college but got pregnant and had to support her family. In the bathroom, Jonah gives Amy some water while she mentions she doesn't regret getting married. About to mention what she does regret, she throws up again while Jonah holds her hair. Morning comes and the doors unlock. Amy tells Jonah she's going to her college mid-term hung over and on no sleep.\n\n\"Demotion\": At the store front, Glenn has a morning meeting with the staff. Garrett asks Jonah about the glances Dina keeps giving him. Jonah confides that Dina propositioned him in the Photo Lab and he turned her down by saying he doesn't feel comfortable dating a manager. Dina announces she is stepping down as assistant manager to pursue \"personal matters\" and Jonah realizes his rejection excuse has backfired. In the Break Room, Garrett loudly asks Jonah if he knows what Dina's personal matters are. He fakes ignorance and as everyone speculates. Jonah approaches Dina at the makeup counter but before he can say he's not interested in a relationship, she asks him to her place for dinner. She then says her grandma died and before Jonah can interject she confesses that she thought he was stringing her along and that he'd be crazy if he did. Jonah laughs uncomfortably but can't muster the courage to let her how he really feels. Jonah is working a checkout counter when Dina shows up with items to buy for their date. They include risotto, chocolate and two boxes of condoms. Jonah stares at her in shock. Jonah asks Dina for a talk in private. In the dressing rooms, Jonah tries to play a recorded message on his phone to tell Dina how he feels. He plays the wrong file and Dina kisses him. He drops his phone which then plays the breakup message and Dina walks out. In the parking lot, Jonah catches Dina at her truck and apologies but Dina isn't bothered by what happened. Jonah is surprised but then Marcus shows up - he's going to Dina's for a dinner date.\n\n\"Labor\": The day after Cheyenne has false labor in the store, Jonah convinces Amy they should call corporate and ask about paid maternity leave. They call and employee services says no but when Jonah mentions that other companies with unions do have it, they are told that someone will be visiting the store first thing in the morning. Steve, a labor relations consultant has a session with the staff the next morning. Jonah tries to ask about paid maternity leave but Steve deflects his question. At the end of Steve's presentation, Jonah again tries to ask about paid maternity leave to which Steve replies with glib answers. In the Break Room, Jonah complains about Steve’s session and gets the staff to air their grievances against Cloud 9. He proposes forming a union but is greeted with shock and apathy. After Glenn is fired for giving Cheyenne 6 weeks paid \"suspension\" for having her baby in the store, Jonah and Amy lead a walk-out of the staff.\n\nSeason Two[]\n\nThe attraction between Jonah and Amy blossoms during his second year at the store. After he and Amy lead a walk out in protest over Glenn losing his job, they are the staff representation in dealing with district manager Jeff Sutin. They lead the staff in a strike but ultimately go back to work and get Glenn his job back. Jonah tries to help Dina improve her relations with her co-workers but isn't successful. Over his objections, Jonah is forced to work the gun counter and this results in an NRA protest in the store. He and Amy have a series of increasingly edgy dares that ends when Jonah walks into the store wearing only an apron and is caught by Adam. Mateo continues to be competitive with Jonah but they make a good team when running a dog adoption station.\n\nDuring the 2016 election, he and Amy team up to get a pro-worker candidate elected and he introduces her to his girlfriend Naomi. Jonah's gambling addiction is revealed when he creates a betting pool on which seasonal worker will quit first. When Amy finds money, Jonah tries to get her to pamper herself like he was as a child but isn't successful. He put his schooling on deferment but later found out that it had lapsed. Jonah can't mediate a dispute between Amy and Marcus. He and Glenn openly argue about abortion in the store during the Wellness Fair.\n\nHe starts dating Glenn's daughter Kristen but she breaks up with him when she sees he has unresolved feelings for Amy. When a tornado hits the store, Jonah and Amy shelter in the Pharmacy and they kiss. They both survive and Amy leaves with her family.\n\n\"Olympics\": Mateo complains to Jonah that Asian Americans can't vote. Jonah is confused when Mateo talks about the \"Green Card Store\" and it dawns on Mateo that he may be an illegal alien. When Glenn goes to great lengths to show Mateo the USA is the best country in the world, Jonah teaches Glenn that the Olympic spirit is about countries understanding each other. Cheyenne is showing some staff Missy Jones' \"dream card\" technique but she is espousing that anything written on a card will come true. Amy and Jonah interrupt and try to inject some realism.\n\n\"Strike\": After the staff walk out in protest over Glenn being fired, district manager Jeff Sutin comes to the store. He has Dina asks Jonah and Amy to meet in the Break Room. Amy and Jonah talk to the staff and he suggests that they ask for more than getting Glenn his job back. Jonah and Amy march into the store and change into business suits. After meeting with Jeff, he mocks the walkout which results in Amy and Jonah leaving and announcing a strike to the staff. The next day, Amy and Jonah admire the staff in a picket line, dressed in red \"Boycott Cloud 9\" shirts. Garrett tells Jonah that he plans to have sex with Nikki and try and teach her tolerance. The strike peters out until only Amy and Jonah are left. They agree to end the strike...for now.\n\n\"Back to Work\": Jonah and Amy are clocking in, discouraged over being back at work. Glenn is glad that corporate is gone until Jonah points out that district manager Jeff Sutin is still on site. In the store, Jonah and Amy start talking to Jeff about grievances but he interrupts them and says he wants to see the store at normal operations and then they can talk about how everyone can improve. Staff are still angry at Dina for not siding with them in the strike so Jonah offers to help Dina get the staff to like her more. Jeff asks Amy to gather the staff in the Break Room which delays them from looking for Marcus' thumb. He says that things look good in the store and asks what corporate can do better. Jonah tries to make suggestions a number of times but Amy cuts him off pretending she wants to get back to work but really wanting to find the thumb. Dina stands up and reads an apology letter Jonah wrote but she hasn't read it before. Dina finds the apology letter weak and criticizes it to everyone's confusion. She ends up saying she's not sorry and insulting everyone. She tells Jonah that she doesn't need to be liked and doesn't care if he or others do have that need.\n\n\"Guns, Pills, and Birds\": In the Break Room, Amy is handing out shift assignments and Jonah gets the gun counter. He morally objects to the assignment but Amy won't change it. At the gun counter, Jonah serves his first customer but is very uncomfortable, drops a pistol and ammo, screams \"gun!\" and ducks for cover. Jonah's next customer is a deranged man. He seeks advice from Amy and as they watch him talk to a mannequin, she agrees he shouldn't get a gun. A very calm man asks to see a bolt-action rifle which Jonah is about to give him until he learns the man has just been laid off. He denies him service even though the man seems to have no intention of taking action against his former workplace. The calm gun customer complains to Amy about Jonah. Amy tries to get Jonah to be more reasonable in dealing with the customers but he refuses. Jonah refuses to sell to another customer who says he's calling the NRA. Garrett finds out from Jonah that he is in part refusing service to get back at Amy for assigning him to the gun counter. A large group of NRA protesters with guns enters the store. In the Break Room, Dina explains the situation and everyone blames Jonah for denying so many people service at the gun counter. At the store front, the customer who threatened to call the NRA is standing on a check-out counter and speaking to the NRA protesters. He decries Jonah's actions which prompts Jonah to also stand on a check-out counter and defend his right to free speech. Jonah offers to work the gun counter properly. Amy realizes his offer is because he feels sorry for her so she doesn't want him to work the counter and they start arguing.\n\n\"Spokesman Scandal\": After Cloud 9's corporate spokesman Kyle the Cloud 9 Cloud is arrested for murder, many Kyle items need to be removed from the store including a mural which Amy and Jonah paint over. In the Stock Room, Jonah and Amy are throwing away more Kyle items including an outfit. Jonah dares Amy to wear it into the store and when she refuses, calls her a chicken. She relents and walks into the store to the horror of the customers. Glenn tells Amy and Jonah that Kyle was killing people because he was high. They say that if this were true, half the employees would be killers. Amy has dared Jonah to stay in a freezer. Jonah now dares Amy to sing the theme song from \"Charles in Charge\" over the P.A. system in both English and Spanish. Amy and Jonah ride a kayak on wheels through the store and tell Jeff they are product testing. The final dare has Jonah wearing only an apron into the store. He shows Amy but doesn't notice her husband Adam is with her until it's too late.\n\n\"Dog Adoption Day\": In the Break Room, Glenn asks for two volunteers and Mateo immediately raises his hand. Jonah reluctantly volunteers and Glenn announces that they will run a dog adoption center which evokes jealousy from everyone. Jonah says he'll switch as he thinks people spend too much money on pets. Mateo starts his usual competitiveness with Jonah and tries to embarrass Jonah in front of Lydia from the dog shelter. Lydia gets set to leave and tells Mateo and Jonah that any dogs not adopted will be killed. They decide to put aside their differences to get all the dogs adopted. Jonah and Mateo's first ploy is to hear details of a woman's deceased husband and then convince her that a dog is her husband re-incarnated. Jonah and Mateo's next ploy is that the dogs worked with celebrities. Seeing success at the dog adoption, Jonah relates some experiences which Mateo one-ups. Lydia returns to find all the dogs have been adopted and Mateo is still one-upping Jonah.\n\n\"Halloween Theft\": During Halloween, Jonah and Garrett are talking about Dina's costume, trying not to mention her large breasts. Amy, Jonah and Glenn are handing out candy to kids when Dina interrupts and gives a wildly excessive warning to the parents about their kids accepting candy from strangers. Jonah and Amy distract her by lying that they saw \"sketchy types\" heading for the Warehouse. Jonah is assigned to the jewellery counter with Cheyenne and they start to bond by gossiping about staff members. Dina interrogates staff over stolen irregular produce and when she gets to Jonah, he asks himself questions. Cheyenne tells Jonah that the staff thinks he has a crush on Amy which he tries to deny. Amy meets Jonah in the Break Room and is depressed that Emma isn't going trick or treating. Behind Amy's back, Elias is making suggestive hand gestures at Jonah. Amy, Dina and Garrett agree to go with Jonah to see \"Nosferatu\".\n\n\"Election Day\": On election day 2016, Jonah and Amy enter the Break Room to find election pamphlets from Cloud 9 corporate. In Glenn's Office, they complain to him that the pamphlets tell the workers to vote for a pro-business candidate and derides one who is pro-worker. Amy and Jonah show the pamphlet to Garrett who doesn't care and find Marcus likes the pro-business candidate because he can relate to simple platitudes. Amy and Jonah decide to create their own pamphlet. Amy and Jonah deliberate over the font to use in their pamphlets while Garrett mocks them. At a staff gathering, Amy and Jonah hand out their pamphlet and encourage the staff to vote for the pro-worker candidate. They approach more staff including those in the Warehouse and watch as they vote pro-worker. Amy and Jonah have a break and are practicing their Brooklyn accents. They complement each other and are having a good time. Amy is relating a story to Jonah when they are interrupted by an attractive woman who Jonah introduces as Naomi, whom he is dating. Jonah says he'll have to hand out pamphlets later and Amy appears a bit put off. Naomi leaves the store and Jonah goes back to help Amy with the pamphlets. However, she now has Marcus taking Jonah's place.\n\n\"Seasonal Help\": As Jonah is hanging Christmas decorations he meets Amy's husband Adam. His BBQ business has failed so Jonah suggests he apply as a seasonal temp at the store. This displeases Amy. Jonah is talked into betting which seasonal temp worker will quit first. He wins the bet on Rashface which fuels a past gambling problem. He creates a betting pool on which temp will quit next and bets on Isaac. He then actively starts to try and make Isaac quit which prompts other staff to do the same with the temps they bet on. Jonah wins and is counting his winnings until he learns from Glenn that the temps are hired from Glenn's church's last chance program which turns his glee into guilt. Jonah catches up to Isaac in the parking lot and gives him the $200 pool winnings. Isaac seems genuinely moved. Jonah than overhears Isaac calling his uncle and asking how much crystal (meth) he can buy with the money.\n\n\"Black Friday\": It's 3:00am and the associates are eating pot-luck while Jonah films his first Black Friday. Jonah films Amy taking inventory when she becomes nauseated and leaves. Amy goes to the Pharmacy to get a pregnancy test from Tate who is teasing her when Jonah happens to film and overhear them. Jonah is waiting for Amy when she comes out of the bathroom. She's not pregnant and he doesn't know how to react. Suddenly Jonah runs to the bathroom and Dina is close behind. Later, Jonah runs into the bathroom and finds Amy is in the next stall. Jonah tries to make conversation but Amy tells him they don't have to. Both sit uncomfortably on the toilet. Amy tells Jonah she's relieved she's not pregnant. They are both waiting for the other to go to the bathroom. Jonah films the staff in the Break Room nursing their sickness until Brett throws away his camera. Everyone in the Break Room starts arguing over who poisoned them and as Jonah tries to rally everyone, Glenn very uncharacteristically curses at him and everyone and tells them to shut up.\n\n\"Lost and Found\": In the Warehouse, the staff are gathered around the lost and found bin. Amy draws a beautiful leather jacket which Mateo clearly wants so she trades it for the cargo shorts he drew. Amy is on the phone arguing with her husband Adam when Jonah models the cargo pants for her.

Amy wants to spend the money on necessities for her family until Jonah convinces her to pamper herself. Amy and Jonah enter the Break Room to be greeted by everyone wanting to know about the money.

Rex shows a video of Jonah making a business presentation in college which evokes a lot of teasing from Glenn, Amy and Garrett. Rex mentions that Jonah's enrolment is still active and he can go back to school. This brings concern from Amy and Glenn. In Glenn's Office, Jonah is asked by Glenn to sign a new contract which he finds has a 30 year term. Glenn gets frantic when Jonah won't sign even promising to fire others to keep him. Amy dares Jonah to cancel his college enrolment which he says is no big deal. Jonah invites Amy to Glenn's Office to cancel his enrolment but finds it already lapsed so he tries to get it re-activated (he was bluffing that he didn't care). At the end of day, Rex hugs Jonah in the parking lot and says next time he's in town, they'll go for drinks.

Jonah joins Amy in her bedroom which is decorated with many pictures of Scott Wolf. He notices they have a lot in common including being on the debate team and liking theatre. Amy believes the packing will never get done until Jonah says she should just leave it to her parents to do and go. They climb out the window. Now in the delivery truck, a weight has lifted from Amy and she and Jonah are singing as they drive back to work. They arrive back at the store to see it being evacuated.

Mateo finally starts shoving Jonah but gets carried away and punches Jonah in the jaw. Jonah doesn't hit Mateo back and sits on a loading bay with an ice pack on his jaw.

Jonah relates that when his parents divorced, he became closer to his Dad due to his niceness. Amy finds Emma has been spending a lot of time with Adam so she runs to Jonah for advice and agrees she needs to be nicer until Emma likes her better than Adam. After Amy's laxness with Emma causes an accident, Amy tells Jonah she's angry with herself for trying to be friends with Emma and that it's OK for Jonah to be strict with her.

Jonah yells that the man's a robber so Dina chases after and tackles the robber while making a crime-show zinger. She orders Jonah to call the police and chastises the robber while sitting on top of him. A police officer interviews Jonah and Dina and establishes that Jonah made no attempt to stop the robber which disgusts Dina. For safety, \"parking lot buddies\" are established.

Dina is angered and points out Jonah did nothing which Jeff praises and says is company policy. Later, Jeff compliments Jonah and while Dina eavesdrops, Jonah asks Jeff not to compliment him in front of Dina. Jonah says Dina can be a bit of a bully which prompts Jeff to report her to HR. Jeff again gathers the staff in the Break Room but this time for a talk on bullying. Jonah insists he wasn't bullied and Dina indicates that if she had bullied someone, they would have a broken nose like Justine. Dina shows Jonah her written reprimand which he tries to apologize for.

Dina challenges Jonah to a fight while staff gather round and Marcus tries to get a chant of \"fight!\" going. As they leave store grounds, Garrett points out to Jonah that he's in a no-win situation. Jonah believes he just needs to stand up to Dina and once he does, she'll back down. Outside, the staff gather and Dina circles around Jonah and says that if he is a feminist, he should punch her. Jonah refuses and when Garrett interrupts to film the up-coming battle, Dina blind-sides Jonah and tackles him to the ground. She tries to pin him but complains that his skin is so soft that he is slippery. As she yells at him to fight back she suddenly jumps up and points at his crotch. Jonah has an erection which he tries to hide. Dina stops Jonah in the store and says that she realizes the reason he's been giving her a \"hard time\" is that he is still attracted to her.

Amy thanks Kelly for being understanding while Kelly thanks Amy for breaking the ice for her with Jonah.\n\n\"Health Fund\": After Mateo gets an ear infection, Amy makes a collection jar for Mateo and asks Jonah's opinion on the best jar sign. He is disgusted that every time a staff member is sick, they have to scramble to collect money. Amy flippantly says they can't collect money before it's needed as planning isn't the staff's forté. This gives Jonah an idea for a health fund. Jonah proposes to a group of staff that they all contribute $20 monthly for a health fund. Amy makes fun of the proposal but when Kelly offers to pitch money in, the rest of the staff follow. Sandra is overjoyed to get an inhaler from the health fund and hugs Jonah. Jonah gloats over his accomplishment to Amy. Marcus approaches Amy to sign a thank you card for Jonah which results in her seeking out Jonah and mentioning that it was her idea which led to the fund. She denies wanting credit but Jonah announces her contribution on the P.A. system and then tells Amy that the fund is a disaster. Jonah shows Amy that health claims worth $37,000 have been made in the first 4 hours of the plan and they see that certain staff have many health problems. Amy and Jonah meet with the staff who have made many health claims and diplomatically tell them that the fund isn't available to them and return their contributions. Sandra gets upset, won't accept she's out of the plan and tells them to figure out a solution. In the Break Room, Amy and Jonah meet with the staff and announce that they are not ejecting anyone from the fund but are dividing them into two groups based on projected health expenses with Group A paying less than Group B.

Jonah watches Amy's first attempt at creating a video which he sarcastically calls \"riveting\". Garrett and Jonah watch five of Amy's videos which are over-the-top. Jonah and Garrett watch Amy's latest video in which she's in the stores' kitchen and derides social media as she's gotten tired of how pointless and self-centered it is. Amy flaunts her video to Jonah and that it got 15,000 views but she didn't realize the rats in the produce behind her. Jonah prepares to clean out the rat traps, having lost the bet to Amy. Amy offers to help but Kelly has already volunteered and she and Jonah begin joking around so Amy leaves in a foul mood.\n\n\"Golden Globes Party\": In the Break Room, Jonah, Mateo and Garrett are placing bets on what will happen at that evening's Golden Globe Awards.

Amy checks on the BBQ but discovers to her horror that the propane ran out and the meat is raw. She asks for Jonah's help, and he tells Amy to not worry about the food as everyone is there to watch the Golden Globes. In the kitchen, Amy tells Dina and Jonah that she's going to microwave the meat and tries to convince them that the party is going fine. Dina tries to interest everyone in games no one has heard of until Jonah has Kelly explain a game called \"Answers\". The game is confusing to everyone except Jerry. In the kitchen, Amy, Dina and Jonah scramble to get the food ready. Amy pours BBQ sauce over the microwaved meat to which Dina and Jonah can barely contain their disgust.

The existence and creation of mermaids, unicorns and Bigfoot is discussed but when Jonah mentions angels, he is surprised that Kelly believes in them. Amy and Jonah watch Brandi make Cheyenne shop for Green Day items for the party and Amy expresses her anger towards Brandi. She believes that a mermaid party is objectively better than a Green Day party and walks away in disgust as Jonah says he likes Green Day and that she shouldn't butt in Cheyenne's relationship with her Mom. As they are folding shirts, Jonah clarifies Kelly's belief in angels which offends her. Jonah tells Garrett about Kelly believing in angels but Garrett is more interested in his weekend plans. To convince Jonah of the existence of angels, Kelly recalls a story from her childhood in which she was saved from drowning by one. The staff listens raptly and are moved but Jonah believes the \"angel\" was a hotel guest. Not believing Kelly in front of the staff results in her calling off their weekend away which concerns Garrett as it will ruin his plans. Jonah again talks to Garrett about his angel problem with Kelly. Garrett forcefully points out Kelly's good points which Jonah accepts over his suspicions that Garrett doesn't want his weekend ruined. Jonah leaves to convince Kelly to go away on the weekend.\n\n\"Groundhog Day\": Since Dina is relaxing, Glenn asks for a volunteer to be assistant manager for the day.

In disgust, Amy listens to Kelly and Jonah sing an announcement. Sandra joins Jonah and Kelly on the announcements which has now turned into a talk show. Jonah arrives at the confrontation between Amy, Marcus and Tate. Cheyenne tells Jonah that Amy slept with Tate so Jonah expresses his surprise to Amy. Jonah is shaken by the news of Amy sleeping with Tate and can't get into doing an announcement impersonating Al Pacino that Kelly sets up for him. However, her bad impressions make him laugh and forgetting about Amy, he launches into his own bad impressions.\n\n\"Video Game Release\": Inside the store, Dina announces the release of a new video game \"Barbarians Gate 3\" to the staff and asks them to be vigilant so that tramplings are avoided. Amy asks if a game can be set aside for her but Dina says no. Amy still wants the game and asks Dina again if she'll make an exception to the rule that employees can't buy products until their shift is over but Dina refuses. Dina leaves so Jonah encourages Amy to sneak a copy of the game out of the cage. Amy is reluctant but Jonah convinces her. Amy and Jonah are at the cage where the games are stored but can't reach them.

The game sold out, Jonah surprises Amy with one that he traded for with a customer. Delighted, she asks Jonah if he'd like to see the game played but he has to meet Kelly. As he walks way, Dina sees how Amy looks at him and asks if she has a crush on Jonah which she admits to.\n\n\"Safety Training\": Marcus tries to convince Jonah, Garrett and Mateo to invest in human cheese but Mateo is distracted by a customer he likes. Some staff gathers around Mateo as he is icing his wrist. Marcus and Justine both tell Mateo they received a settlement when they were hurt. Mateo doesn't consider himself a good negotiator so Jonah volunteers to help him. In the Break Room, Jeff offers Mateo a $1000 settlement. Jonah negotiates lamely and then says they'll take it. As Jonah and Mateo look through the fine print of the settlement document, they discover that a background check is required which will reveal Mateo's undocumented status so they inform Jeff they are turning down the offer. Jeff approaches Jonah and Mateo and offers a higher settlement figure which he says is the final offer. When they turn him down, he keeps offering higher figures which to his frustration are refused. In Glenn's Office, Jeff's boss is on the phone and Mateo is offered $50,000. When this is refused, Jeff and Mateo argue about their past relationship which embarrasses Jeff in front of his boss. In the Break Room, Dina gathers the staff to show them the video of the sign falling due to Kelly's incompetence. Dina can't figure out how to work the playback and video of when the tornado hit the store is shown including Amy kissing Jonah. The staff gasp in shock, Kelly is stunned and Jonah and Amy are embarrassed.\n\n\"Amnesty\": In the Break Room, the staff laugh at a video on a loop of Amy and Jonah kissing. Corey kiddingly points out where the condoms are to Amy and Jonah. Amy and Jonah are sick of the constant kidding which is made worse when Justine and Isaac arrive and tease them more. Jonah catches Amy eating her lunch in the Stock Room to avoid staff teasing. He relates that if they join in on the kidding, it'll stop. Sandra interrupts them and teases them with a sexual hand gesture which she gets wrong. Corey teases Amy and Jonah that he can leave them alone with a bed but they go along with the teasing and end up accidentally kissing so Justine runs off to tell everyone. In the Warehouse, Jonah tries to explain the kiss to Kelly. A video created by Sandra of Amy and Jonah's kiss which is a parody of the a-ha \"Take On Me\" video is shown on the store's TVs which Amy admits is impressive. In the Break Room, Glenn introduces Pastor Craig to deal with the souls of the staff. He finishes his session which Glenn is disappointed with. Glenn recalls various things staff have admitted to which causes Amy to protest that kissing Jonah wasn't adultery and, that she thought they were about to die. Pastor Craig says everyone makes mistakes and looking at Amy and Jonah, that all have lust in their hearts. They deny any lust so he counters that he senses something going on with them. Jonah points out he's dating Kelly and admits he had a crush on Amy years ago. Amy admits she had a crush on Jonah which surprises him. They both awkwardly try to explain the attraction away which no one believes. Jonah apologizes to Kelly and tells her that even if his and Amy's crushes had been at the same time, he'd still be with Kelly. They agree to move in together and hug.\n\n\"Target\": In the Break Room, Jonah and Kelly are looking on a laptop for a place to move in together but Jonah continually finds fault with all the options. At the store, Jonah and Kelly tape a floor plan of their ideal living room but Jonah insists they need to try it out with furniture. The furniture display now has many items which Jonah finds cramped. Kelly confronts him and asks if he really wants to move in together. He says he does and admits that the situation with Amy was part of the reason for his behaviour. Jonah and Kelly re-affirm their commitment while squishing bread loaves.\n\n\"District Manager\": Justine, Marcus and Sandra watch Laurie work and make negative comments about her. Amy accuses them of misogyny and Jonah comments that many people think women make better bosses than men. He makes an analogy to Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire which angers Myrtle who challenges Jonah to name movies Rogers was better than Rita Hayworth in. He can't but Marcus does while mixing up the title names. Amy tells Jonah that Myrtle is going to fired and after some questioning, admits its her fault. Amy and Jonah convince Laurie to not fire Myrtle if they can find enough savings to make up Myrtle's salary. In the Warehouse, Amy tries to help Jonah find some cost savings. Amy and Jonah enter the Break Room and tell the staff they need to take the coffee machine in order to save money so that Laurie won't fire Myrtle. This leads numerous staff to posit whether it is sexist to call a woman a bitch who is acting like one. Jonah agrees with Marcus on a point but tells him to stop using the word \"bitch\". Justine rebukes Jonah when he explains to Cheyenne that no one hosts a holocaust. Amy and Jonah present the savings they've found to Laurie but despite impressing her, Laurie still wants Myrtle fired. Leaving the store, Amy curses about Laurie to Jonah. They see the delivery truck truck on its side and Myrtle shouts it was her best day ever.\n\n\"Local Vendors Day\": Garrett and Jonah browse vendor's tables but Garrett isn't impressed with any. He sees an artisanal beer table which he pans until he sees the cute proprietor Jess. Jonah teases him that he's interested in Jess which Garrett denies. Jonah accuses Glenn of pressuring the staff to buy his wife Jerusha's items. Garrett has Jonah try one of Jess' samples and he believes it's Bud Light too. Garrett won't admit to caring about Jess despite Jonah teasing him. After learning that Amy is dating Alex, Jonah overcompensates and repeatedly says how great Alex is and he arranges a double date with Kelly, Amy and Alex. In the store, Jonah checks out Alex while Marcus rues spending his savings on creating \"boob cheese\". Jonah encourages him so Marcus gives him a sample and looks at Jonah expectantly. Jonah feels obliged to take a bite, fakes liking it which turns into surprise when Marcus admits he's grossed out by the cheese.\n\n\"Lottery\": After Glenn announces that the Missouri Lottery jackpot is the most it has been in 20 years, Jonah says his lottery win dream would be to travel but he doesn't mention bringing Kelly so Marcus claims dibs on her. In the store, Jonah sees Amy in a business suit and discovers she plans on asking Glenn for a raise. Amy is reluctant so Jonah encourages her. While stocking produce, Kelly playfully gives Jonah a hard time for not mentioning her in his lottery fantasy. He tries to explain but this evokes teasing from Kelly. Amy tells Jonah about her failure with Glenn so Jonah encourages Amy to talk to Laurie. In Glenn's Office, Amy calls Laurie to ask for a raise but gets her secretary, Skye. Skye says Laurie isn't available and Jonah accuses her of lying which makes her cry. Jonah plans dinner and watching one of Kelly's favorite TV shows which she cheerfully gets him to admit is making up for not including her in his lottery fantasy. Jonah discovers through Laurie's social media that she's playing golf. Jonah talks Amy into going to the golf course and asking Laurie for a raise. She agrees but insists he come along. At the golf course, Amy and Jonah search for Laurie in a cart with Amy driving very slowly. Jonah talks about his past which included golfing, tennis and skiing. They see Laurie in the distance and creep slowly towards her. At the course, Jonah gives Amy some funny golf segues to asking for a raise. As they pursue Laurie, it takes them down a hill. The cart picks up speed and unable to control it, Amy runs into Laurie. A paramedic arrives and advises Laurie that although nothing appears broken, she should remain prone until help arrives. Against Jonah's advice, Amy asks for a raise from an incredulous Laurie. At a putting green at night, Amy and Jonah drink beer and Jonah kids Amy about her failed raise attempt. Amy misses hitting the ball so Jonah moves closer to instruct her. He holds Amy from behind and misses a call from Kelly on his phone. Kelly leaves a cheerful message for him about their restaurant reservation which Jonah has forgotten. Amy sinks her putt and she and Jonah revel in her victory.\n\n\"Gender Reveal\": In the Break Room, Glenn and Jerusha show the ultrasound to the staff. In the store, Amy and Jonah watch Glenn and Jerusha and make jokes in an Italian accent about Amy's life is she'd been born a boy. Jeff, now sporting a moustache, surprises Mateo and maintains the ruse with Jonah that he's working for Target. Jeff leaves to shop and Mateo tells Jonah that Jeff is jobless. Jeff continually talks about Target to Jonah which prompts him to ask Jeff to tone down the work talk. Jeff figures out that Jonah knows his ruse and Mateo discusses this with Jonah. Mateo doesn't want to ask Jeff to find a job (as Jeff quit Cloud 9 for Mateo) so Jonah offers to. Jonah finds Jeff talking to Mateo and encourages him to find a job. Jeff wants to find what makes him happy which Mateo supports and so Jonah relents. In private, Mateo is angry at Jonah as Jonah was supposed to be the \"bad cop\" and insist on Jeff finding a job. In hiking gear, Jeff approaches Jonah and Mateo. Jonah forcefully tells Jeff he needs to stop dreaming and get a job while Mateo play acts supporting Jeff. Mateo continues to tie into Jonah but Jeff stops him and gives in to getting a job. He is so despondent that when Jonah keeps playing \"bad cop\", Mateo asks him to stop and Jonah relents. In private, Mateo is angry again at Jonah for not playing his role. At the gender reveal party, Jonah and Mateo watch Jeff in a fishing hat talk to Cheyenne and Mateo rues their economic down turn. Amy meets Jonah in the Warehouse cleaning up the trash. Jonah jokingly repeats the Italian accent from earlier but Amy looks deep into his eyes and moves closer. She kisses him and he responds tenderly. Amy pulls back and with tears in her eyes, tells Jonah that she's pregnant.\n\n\"Aftermath\": In the Warehouse, Jonah tells Amy he doesn't know what to do now that she's told him she's pregnant. He finds out the father is Adam and asks Amy why she kissed him and told him she was pregnant. Amy says she wanted to before everything changes which confuses and angers Jonah who leaves. In the Break Room, Glenn gives morning announcements and puts Amy on the spot when he mentions Mother's Day is coming up. Amy tells everyone she's pregnant. Jonah lies to Kelly that he didn't know. Amy tries to talk to Jonah while he's stocking a shelf but Jonah refuses and walks over to Kelly. Outside at the store front for the group photo, Glenn asks everyone to put their arms around each other and has to force Jonah to hold Amy. Jonah kisses Kelly and they flirt until interrupted by a customer who holds Jonah's hand. At a checkout, Amy again tries to talk to Jonah who doesn't want to discuss their kiss. They are interrupted by Adam who doesn't know Amy is pregnant. Amy wants to talk to Adam later but they are interrupted by Bo who tells Amy he left the baby stuff by her locker and mentions her pregnancy. This shocks Adam who thinks Jonah is the father until Amy says it's his. Jonah is finally able to leave by helping a lost boy. Jonah drapes himself over Kelly's back while she's stocking a shelf and says he wants to meet her parents. In the Break Room, Jonah comments that he and Amy aren't watching the video and he apologizes for reacting poorly to their kiss. Amy says she's had a rough day and doesn't want to discuss it which angers Jonah since Amy has been pressing him all day to do so. Jonah complains that Amy wants to discuss things when she wants. Amy cites the situation she's going through to which Jonah counters that everyone has problems. Amy belittles Jonah's problems to which he counters that Amy loves being the martyr and will give criticism but won't accept it. Amy can't believe her kissing Jonah has prompted such anger while he can't believe he waited two years for her and it wasn't until he was in a relationship and she was pregnant that she kissed him. She wonders why Jonah is still at the store and Jonah challenges her to leave but says she never will. Amy tells Jonah to go to hell and storms off. In the parking lot, Kelly tells Jonah their brunch plans with her parents. Kelly declares her love for Jonah but he tells her that they should break up.\n\n\"Town Hall\": Garrett recites his rules for dating and living with co-workers to Jonah while they watch Kelly dump Jonah's clothes on the store floor which Brett rummages through. Jonah asks if he can move back in with Garrett. In the Break Room, Laurie goes over the agenda for the town hall and also goes over forbidden topics which Jonah objects to and is burned by Kelly for dumping her. Amy catches Jonah in Glenn's Office looking for Myrtle's employee file. Brett stocks items while wearing a t-shirt from Jonah's bar mitzvah. Amy and Jonah discover that after 30 years with no disciplinary notes in her file, Myrtle was written up many times in the 6 months by Jeff before she was fired. There is tension between them as they both plan to question Jeff. Amy and Jonah talk to Jeff in his car which he's using for ride sharing. He reveals that Cloud 9 came up with a policy to falsely write-up any employee over the age of 70 as a pretext for firing them in order to save money. He offers to help with the situation which Amy takes him up on. In the Warehouse, Amy and Jonah share their discovery with a number of staff. They plan to have Jeff reveal the ageism policy at the town hall and steal Laurie's phone to retrieve an incriminating email on the policy from it. At Coffee & Bakery, Amy distracts Laurie by asking if she's a lesbian while Jonah searches through Laurie's bag for her phone. Amy mentions several prospects for Laurie to which Laurie says nothing until Jonah finds the phone. Amy and Jonah start looking through emails on Laurie's phone. Amy and Jonah find the email on downsizing legacy employees and print it off. Amy and Jonah try to get into the town hall but Laurie won't let them walk in front of the camera. Amy whispers to Jonah they can use the store's access tunnels to get into the town hall and they leave. Garrett texts Amy and Jonah to hurry so they start through the store's tunnels. Dina stalls for time until Amy and Jonah arrive and give the email to Jeff. The town hall over, Amy and Jonah bring items including the flower stand with the hidden camera to the Photo Lab and complain about their management's corruptness. Amy can't believe she was naive enough to believe they'd get justice but Jonah thinks things will work out much to Amy's annoyance. Jonah asks Amy about their situation to which Amy suggests a fresh start. They smile at each other in agreement but as Amy turns away, Jonah kisses her passionately. As the Cloud 9 cameras in store are turned off, the camera Garrett hid in the flower stand activates and broadcasts Jonah taking off his shirt and pants, revealing a white undershirt and blue boxer shorts and then taking his boxers off and having sex with Amy to the Cloud 9 global stores. Staff and customers at the stores stare in amazement while some film it.\n\nSeason Four[]\n\nJonah is teased mercilessly by Isaac and Marcus about the sex tape made with Amy.

After it's cleared up that Amy and Noam didn't have sex, Carol asks if it was illegal when Amy forced Jonah to have sex with her but Jonah insists it wasn't forced. Cheyenne and Mateo make Jonah uncomfortable by asking if sex with a pregnant woman was weird. In the parking lot, Jonah meets Amy at her car, kisses her and they make plans to have dinner.\n\n\"Baby Shower\": In the Stock Room, Amy is planning to take returned baby items until Jonah interrupts and points out she's stealing. They examine a high chair under a black light and finding multiple stains, it dissuades Amy from taking the returned items. Jonah proposes that he sign Amy up for the store's baby shower registry. Amy hates baby showers but when Jonah points out she doesn't have to have one to get 20% off everything on the registry and a free pack of diapers, Amy reluctantly agrees. Cheyenne and Sandra discover Amy is on the baby shower registry and her shower is that day. Angry they weren't invited, they confront her. Jonah tries to explain there is no shower but is cut off. Jonah convinces Amy to have a small shower in the Break Room. At Coffee & Bakery, Jonah orders a cake and is met by Glenn who's heard about the shower. He mentions how much Jerusha would love one and takes Jonah's reply to mean Amy's shower will be for Jerusha too. Glenn starts to plan a full blown shower.

As Amy and Jonah wonder if others can tell they are dating, they see Justine eavesdropping so they start mock fighting. Seeing another opportunity to deflect suspicion they are dating, Amy and Jonah argue in Produce in front of Don, Joanna and Roger.

Frustrated that Glenn won't sign her transfer payments, she makes an impression of him. In order to make Kelly happy, Jonah manipulates Glenn into believing that she is the cause of the troubles with the store's culture. In the parking lot, Amy and Jonah continue mock arguing but once Jonah points out no one can hear them, Amy finds it hard to stop being combative with him.\n\n\"Costume Competition\": As Glenn announces that a costume competition for a paid vacation day will be held, Jonah asks Sandra what her costume is. Wanting to win the paid day off, Amy changes into a Mario costume which she shows Jonah. He tries to get validation for his intelligent costume which Amy doesn't care about. As Jonah tries to get Garrett interested in his costume, he points out that a Halloween novelty song has been playing over the store's P.A. system constantly. Garrett indicates he's able to block annoying things out and does so to Jonah which offends him. Later, Garrett rebukes Jonah for pointing out the novelty Halloween song which has started to drive him crazy. In the parking lot, Glenn frantically runs around with the cart collector following him. Calling Jonah to witness, he puts the bag with the fob down beside the collector, runs back and forth and is confused when it doesn't follow him.

As the staff argue about what constitutes a culturally sensitive costume, Jonah can't explain what does and he turns to Janet for help which she declines. At the contest, Jonah takes the votes and talks about gerrymandering. Leaving for the evening, Amy finds out from Jonah that Cheyenne actually won the competition as one of her boobs fell out of her costume. However, Jonah rigged the results so Amy would win, which he points out is ironic given that his costume is gerrymandering.\n\n\"Delivery Day\": Amy and Dina are in the hospital to deliver their babies, Jonah's brought everything Amy needs and wonders if he should stay or leave. Amy wants him to stay, but not too close. Adam overhears Jonah when on the phone with Amy so she implies that he's one of many from work at the hospital. Amy hasn't told him that she and Jonah are involved. The hospital administrator, Lillian, informs Amy and Jonah that they don't take her insurance. They discover that Dina's is accepted because she's Cloud 9 management. Lillian tells them of a clinic that does accept their insurance.

Not wearing any shoes and overly spiritual, as she wanders away they're miffed that Glenn is probably going to hire her. Seeing Kimmer has been hired and is punching a box, Garrett and Jonah manipulate Glenn into allowing them to conduct the interviews for the last seasonal hire position. While preparing for the interviews, Amy walks by and they comment on her disheveled state. The interviews start with Penny who is extremely energetic and demonstrative. She tells them that she has another job offer but turned off by her, they pass. The interviews continue with a man who can't decide where to sit, an unintelligent man, a glib man, a woman with a nose bleed, a vaper, a man with a swastika tattoo and a man with an offensive t-shirt. At Coffee & Bakery, Jonah and Garrett review the bad candidates and regret not hiring Penny. Even though Penny has accepted her other job offer, Garrett and Jonah convince her to work at the store which they say is like a family. They immediately regret hiring Penny as she goofily sings and dances while working, which embarrasses them when Glenn sees her. While doing go-backs, Penny makes train noises which Garrett finds annoying. A young man, Lonnie, asks if he can apply for a position but being all taken, he's turned away. Acting polite and honest, Garrett and Jonah want to hire him, especially as Penny passes by mimicking a robot. Garrett and Jonah fire Penny who has a hard time accepting it and won't let go of her work vest. After Amy screams at Glenn, she tells Jonah and, surprised that he listens patiently without telling her an inspiring story, she teases him and they laugh. Saying that he's never done anything as hard as Amy is doing, she finds it encouraging. In the store, Garrett and Jonah praise Lonnie's work ethic to which he jokes back in a self-deprecating manner. Excusing himself to use the bathroom, Garrett and Jonah congratulate themselves on putting the work in and finding a good employee. However, they then see Lonnie peeing on the floor in the middle of the store.\n\n\"New Initiative\": Jonah gets in over his head while trying to help a customer with a drill and Glenn tries to convince a customer to buy a printer once she hears that an on-line company has same day delivery.

In private, Jonah explains to Amy how he began lying to his parents about being in medical school. Amy decides to take the opportunity to learn Jonah's embarrassing childhood events. With delight, Amy coaxes stories about Jonah from his parents while he tries to defend himself. Glenn catches Amy and Jonah with the Simms and as he starts treating Jonah like an employee, the Simms become confused. As Jonah tries to explain without revealing he works there, he lets slip that the Simms are his parents. As Glenn introduces himself and is about to say Jonah is an employee, Amy yells at Glenn and hits him in the face with a yam. In private, Amy explains Jonah's secret to Glenn. Jonah arrives and further explains that he didn't want to disappoint his parents that he was working at a retail store which concerns Glenn. Amy tries to deflect Glenn's concern by citing the Simms' unreasonable expectations of Jonah. As Jonah leaves the store with his parents, they run into Amy. To show her that their relationship isn't temporary, Jonah admits that he's been working at the store for three years. Marilyn starts to cry and when Richard finds out Jonah doesn't manage the store, he falls to his knees. In Glenn's Office, Glenn tries to fire Jonah, believing he's setting him free to pursue his dreams. Seeing what Glenn is doing, Jonah assures him that he's alright working at the store. At Coffee & Bakery, Jonah explains how his mother misunderstood that he was dating the famous actress. Vowing no more secrets except his relationship with Amy, they then both decide to tell the staff. Amy and Jonah are disappointed in the staff's response to their secret.\n\n\"Managers' Conference\": Glenn offers tickets to a managers' conference to Amy and Jonah who initially aren't interested until they find out it's in Chicago and they get to stay together in a hotel. Later at the conference check-in, they're denied access as the tickets are non-transferable. Dejected that they can't get into the conference, their former district manager Jeff sees them and says he can get them in. Entering the conference room, Amy and Jonah are surprised at the opulence, food and amenities. Unable to leave the conference since Jeff is hovering at the door, Amy comments that all the managers there are selfish \"d-bags\" who don't care about their staff. Jonah disagrees and strikes up a conversation with Ted and Kent while affecting a southern accent. Amy is offered a free iPad and realizes that the staff in green shirts are all giving away free items. After getting an expensive coat, she and Jonah start drinking, get more swag and have fun at various booths. Jeff then joins them for a forced fun picture. Having drunk a lot, Amy and Jonah call two managers over to their table and start telling mean jokes about Cloud 9 workers. Amy jokes that a full-time worker could be replaced with two part-time workers to save on benefits. Liking the idea and calling a company lawyer over, Amy realizes she's gone too far and leaves. Amy comments on the low intelligence of the Cloud 9 managers so Jonah suggests that she become one.\n\n\"Shadowing Glenn\": After Amy asks for Glenn's recommendation for her to enrol in the management training program, Jonah asks Dina why she isn't aspiring to be a manager. Claiming that Jonah humiliated her by questioning why she doesn't want to be a manager, Dina asks for Jonah's help in finding a new career. At Coffee & Bakery, Jonah asks Dina career aptitude questions but she provides obtuse answers. Garrett, Jonah and Justine name several career choices to Dina but she turns down all of them. Out of career choices for Dina, Jonah points out that he spent 200 grand on his education and he still doesn't know what he wants to do. When Dina learns Jonah owes the money in student loans and says he is going more into debt everyday, it depresses him. Jonah interrupts Cheyenne and Mateo's session with Glenn to ask him to lunch to discuss a raise. Unable to keep Glenn in his office, Cheyenne and Mateo follow him into the store where Justine is trying to sell ice pops by suggestively sucking on them. Hearing Cheyenne and Mateo plan their business, Jonah asks to join thinking he might be able to make some money. They confess that they just like to talk about various dreams and never intended to really start a business. They ask Jonah if he'd like to start a band with them but Jonah says he doesn't play an instrument. They have to re-iterate that they just like to make plans they don't intend to follow through on. Jonah agrees to join but after proposing a band name, they kick him out.\n\n\"Cloud 9 Academy\": In the Break Room, Mateo complains about the difficulties of applying for asylum in the US, while Sayid points out applying to be a refugee is even harder. Looking at the application, Jonah suggests that becoming an outspoken critic of the Philippines president, Rodrigo Duterte, may help Mateo's application. After Mateo shows Jonah some memes he's posted on-line maligning Duterte, Jonah says he'll have to show his opposition in a stronger fashion, such as leading an activist group. Agreeing, Mateo recruits Marcus. Jonah and Mateo hand out flyers for the activist group and recruit Sandra to come to a meeting. At Coffee & Bakery, Jonah and Mateo have a meeting of the activist group which Marcus, Sandra and six customers attend. Suggestions such as a letter-writing campaign and a protest march are discussed. Mateo wants a rally in the parking lot which one of the activists says she can get a TV station to do a news story on. In the parking lot, a news reporter questions Mateo about his opposition to Duterte but scared, he gives neutral answers that Jonah supports. Marcus interrupts and speaking to the camera, identifies Mateo and says that Mateo is going to kill Duterte.\n\n\"Steps Challenge\": In the Break Room, Glenn hands out SuperCloud Step Trackers and tells the staff that they're in competition with other regional Cloud 9 stores for the most combined steps by week end for a chance to win a visit from the regional VP. Watching a real-time scoreboard that tracks the steps of the competing stores, Amy realizes that a chance to talk to the VP would help with her management aspirations. Jonah tells Isaac that upping his steps per day will increase his lifespan which Isaac doesn't care about and shocks Jonah that he's under 30 years old, even though he looks much older. Seeing they are still in last place on the scoreboard, Jonah suggests that if they trash talk Colleen's store, Bel-Ridge, the backlash might motivate the staff to compete. The staff are gathered at the scoreboard to see messages from Bel-Ridge putting their store down which are actually sent by Amy. Everyone starts moving around the store in a frenzy, cheered on by Amy, Dina and Jonah. Concerned that his steps aren't being counted on his scooter, Jonah tries to give Glenn advice but this results in him going around in circles. Seeing that the store is in fifth place despite all their efforts, Amy and Dina agree that more drastic measures are required to push the staff. The next morning, staff find the store front has been vandalized and spray-painted, seemingly by Bel-Ridge. Jonah realizes that Amy and Dina are behind it but doesn't give them up. In private, Amy and Dina admit to Jonah they were behind the vandalism and dismiss his concerns they are taking things too far. A staff member, Walter, asks Jonah where the Break Room is and heads there followed by several staff with backpacks. As Jonah admits to Dina that he doesn't know who Walter is, they realize the staff are from Bel-Ridge. Running to the Break Room, they are joined by other staff and find it's been totally trashed.\n\n\"Blizzard\": During a snowstorm, Jonah tries to help Amy convince Glenn to let the staff leave early. Relenting, the staff leave the store but the storm is so bad, Jonah says they should go back inside. As the staff gather in a circle in the store, Dina makes everyone tell how they lost their virginity. Jonah says he lost his to a French exchange student.
