        "text": "There are a number of train types in Switzerland ready to transport you across the country, and to and from other European countries by day and night. Switzerland's national railway company is the SBB (Schweizerische BundesBahn). Use the Eurail train timetable or SBB timetable to check times for trains in Switzerland.\n\nRegional trains in Switzerland\n\nThe main rail network in Switzerland is made up of the following regional and intercity trains:\n\nRegioExpress trains link regional destinations with larger Swiss cities.\n\nRegio trains connect local towns.\n\nInterCity trains link major Swiss cities like Basel and Geneva.\n\nInterRegio trains connect Zurich and Geneva with cities across the whole of Switzerland. These trains make more stops than InterCity trains.\n\nS-Bahn (suburban trains) is a network of trains that operate within most big cities.\n\nZurich: Your Interrail Pass is valid for the S-bahn of Zurich except lines S4, S10 and S18.\n\nSee our Timetable for more details about availability.\n\nClick here to download a more detailed map of the Swiss train network (2 MB)\n\nTravel tip:\n\nThere's an international regional train connection between Chiasso and Milan (Italy). This connection is a great option if you want to avoid reservation fees.\n\nOn the Eurail timetable RegioExpress trains are listed as \"RE\", and Regio trains as \"R\". InterCity trains are listed as \"IC\", and InterRegio trains as \"IR\". Regional and Intercity trains do not require seat reservations. Reservations are however recommended for Intercity trains during high season (May-September) and public holidays.\n\nPrivate railway companies in Switzerland\n\nThe Swiss railway network is operated not only by the SBB, there are a lot of private railway companies as well. Some of these companies are included in your Eurail Pass while other companies offer discounted travel.\n\nClick here to download a more detailed map of the Swiss train network with all trains included (2 MB)."
