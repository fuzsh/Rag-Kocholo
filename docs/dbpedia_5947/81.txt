Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) is transforming its railway stations into mobility hubs as it simultaneously launches projects centering around railway stations. In collaboration with SBB Infrastructure, we’re leading discussions on the use of public spaces by organizing workshops for the relevant stakeholders. The findings from the workshops are then incorporated into revisions and updates of SBB Infrastructure’s development plans. We support SBB Infrastructure in developing its plans for the entire Region East.
