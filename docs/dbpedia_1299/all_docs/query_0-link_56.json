        "text": "Movies based in space have a natural appeal to me, with the Clint Eastwood directed Space Cowboys (2000) being an appreciated representative. Adventure, action and thrills intersperse with a story more than forty-years in the making. Lines blurred at the beginnings of the United States space program’s involvement with the U.S. Air Force and NASA, a story that includes Skylab came into the story set more than twenty-years into the past of the current day.\n\nThe decaying orbit of an old Soviet Union satellite using technology technology designed by Frank Corvin as portrayed by Clint Eastwood and Toby Stephens brings the past into the present day. It is Bob Gerson, as portrayed by James Cromwell and Billie Worley, who seemingly central roles in the distant past and the movie’s present helps introduce the necessary links that initiate the story of getting Frank, who had pined for space flight since the 1950s, into space.\n\nFrank had friends from the beginning storyline who shared similar hopes of becoming astronauts. When the possibility to go to space is introduced to Frank, getting seats on a space shuttle for Hawk Hawkins as portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones and Eli Craig, Jerry O’Neil as portrayed by Donald Sutherland and John Asher, and Tank Sullivan as portrayed by James Garner and Matt McColm becomes job number one.\n\nThe internal workings at NASA, along with the opportunity for publicity, mixes Frank, Hawk, Jerry and Tank into a mission to recover the satellite aboard fictional Space Shuttle Daedalus. Bob Gerson aims to spoil this chance at space for the elder statesmen with a younger set of astronauts poised to learn from Frank and his friends. Ethan Glance and Roger Hines, as portrayed by Loren Dean and Courtney B. Vance, respectively, ride to space with the elder statesmen as part of Team Daedalus.\n\nIntrigue is found on the mission in space thanks to intrigue tracing back to the KGB. Powerful ramifications are felt for the men in space as well as for people in ground control. Flight director Gene Davis along with Hawk Hawkins love interest Sara Holland, as portrayed, respectively, by William Devane and Marcia Gay Harden, gain their feet in the second half of the movie; the subterfuge of General Vostove, as portrayed by Rade Serbedzija, is paired with a surprise dance partner that knew full well, along with Ethan, the true stakes in play in space. The departing shot of the movie, accompanied by the music of Frank Sinatra, provides a surprisingly uplifting joyous note to the closing of the movie.\n\nWriting credits for Space Cowboys rest with Ken Kaufman and Howard Klausner. I grant Space Cowboys as directed by Clint Eastwood 3.75-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, April 10, 2024\n\nSo I recently watched the 8-episode first season of Amazon Prime Original Series Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan (2018-2023). Starring John Krasinski as Dr. Jack Ryan, the series first came online in August 2018 as a reprise of characters from a series of best-selling “thrillers with detailed themes of espionage, military, science, politics and technology” (Biography.Com) written by Tom Clancy. Jack Ryan as a character was central to many of these books.\n\n(Wendell Pierce, left, and John Krasinski in Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan)\n\nThe series starts with the premise that it will be telling a story based on characters from the Tom Clancy universe of books. While many of the thrillers were based on the Cold War and aftermath, with the book The Hunt for Red October first being published in 1984, the series makes no apologies for being set in the modern day with a modern set of stories for the characters to face.\n\nAn early scene in the first episode brings Jack Ryan into accidental contact with Vice Admiral James Greer, who is in the Central Intelligence Agency in the books as well as in this series. Both characters are portrayed essentially true to their known characters, though both find themselves basically being introduced to each other and in a different place in their careers than you might expect walking in. Greer is played by Wendell Pierce.\n\n(Writer Tom Clancy)\n\nCharacter Dr. Cathy Ryan (nee Mueller) as portrayed by Abbie Cornish brings home a solid introduction to the character that is sensitive to Jack Ryan yet with the intelligence to question and trust the man the audience knows Jack Ryan to be.\n\n(Abbie Cornish)\n\nBesides introducing the audience to characters we know, there is an actual story that is told in a world aware of the events of the early 2000’s and beyond. It seems fair to point out that much of the story of season one aims to set the viewer up for the expectation of multiple threads of stories that are occurring in strands and threads that, if told like a true story by Tom Clancy, would come together by the end of the season to bring together loose strands into a tightly weaved whole.\n\nThe analytics of Jack Ryan play a part in the story. The backing of James Greer in pursuing some zany thoughts of an unproven analyst also play their part. The role of the character played by Ali Suliman is important, though precisely his tale or backstory are worth the effort to watch.\n\n(Ali Suliman)\n\nThe story of Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan was compelling, and the known characters were properly likable. The known characters were largely true to their original vision, yet the alterations and switches in personality and character points were welcomed and not off-putting.\n\nSome of the threads of the story tied together better than others. While parts of the story felt like there was material to fill-in the narrative length of an 8-episode season, nothing in the season felt supremely out-of-place, either. Those familiar with books of Tom Clancy might recognize some things in the resolution to the larger story of the season. My grade for the first season of Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan is a 3.5-stars on a 5-star scale.\n\nMatt – Friday, October 5, 2018"
