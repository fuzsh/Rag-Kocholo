        "text": "Body Armor is a thrilling action movie from 1997 that showcases Matt McColm as John Ridley, a former soldier turned bodyguard to the rich and famous. Annabel Schofield plays Daisy, a young journalist with a knack for getting herself into trouble. The movie also features Ron Perlman, who plays the role of Wallstreet, the leader of a dangerous gang who are out for revenge.\n\nThe opening sequence of the movie sets the tone for what is to come as we see John Ridley, the protagonist, saving his client from a group of armed attackers. We then get to know John and his team of bodyguards, who are all ex-military, tough and resourceful. The team is hired by Daisy, who is working on an investigative piece on a corrupt businessman, but soon finds herself the target of Wallstreet's hitmen.\n\nAs the plot unfolds, we are drawn into a world of action, suspense, and intrigue. There are numerous fight scenes, car chases, and shootouts that keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Matt McColm's performance as John Ridley is impressive as he effortlessly showcases his martial arts skills and physical prowess. Annabel Schofield delivers a convincing portrayal of Daisy, a determined journalist who refuses to be intimidated by her powerful adversaries.\n\nThe antagonist, Wallstreet, played by Ron Perlman is a formidable foe, with his menacing appearance and ruthless nature. His gang of henchmen is equally menacing and creates a sense of danger and threat throughout the movie. The stakes are high as John and his team race against time to protect Daisy and bring down the corrupt businessman.\n\nApart from the electrifying action sequences, the movie also explores themes of loyalty, friendship, and redemption. We see the strong bond that exists between John and his team, who are willing to risk their lives for each other. We also witness John's struggle with his past, and his determination to make things right.\n\nThe movie's pacing is brisk, and the narrative is easy to follow. The cinematography is impressive, with stunning shots of Los Angeles as the backdrop for most of the action. The soundtrack is also noteworthy, with a mix of rock and electronic music that adds to the movie's overall ambiance.\n\nOverall, Body Armor is a classic action movie that delivers on all fronts. It has a solid cast, thrilling action sequences, and an engaging storyline. The movie has aged well and is still as entertaining today as it was when it first came out. For fans of the action genre, this is a must-see movie."
