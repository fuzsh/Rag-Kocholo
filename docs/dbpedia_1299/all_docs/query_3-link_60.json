        "text": "Movies based in space have a natural appeal to me, with the Clint Eastwood directed Space Cowboys (2000) being an appreciated representative. Adventure, action and thrills intersperse with a story more than forty-years in the making. Lines blurred at the beginnings of the United States space program’s involvement with the U.S. Air Force and NASA, a story that includes Skylab came into the story set more than twenty-years into the past of the current day.\n\nThe decaying orbit of an old Soviet Union satellite using technology technology designed by Frank Corvin as portrayed by Clint Eastwood and Toby Stephens brings the past into the present day. It is Bob Gerson, as portrayed by James Cromwell and Billie Worley, who seemingly central roles in the distant past and the movie’s present helps introduce the necessary links that initiate the story of getting Frank, who had pined for space flight since the 1950s, into space.\n\nFrank had friends from the beginning storyline who shared similar hopes of becoming astronauts. When the possibility to go to space is introduced to Frank, getting seats on a space shuttle for Hawk Hawkins as portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones and Eli Craig, Jerry O’Neil as portrayed by Donald Sutherland and John Asher, and Tank Sullivan as portrayed by James Garner and Matt McColm becomes job number one.\n\nThe internal workings at NASA, along with the opportunity for publicity, mixes Frank, Hawk, Jerry and Tank into a mission to recover the satellite aboard fictional Space Shuttle Daedalus. Bob Gerson aims to spoil this chance at space for the elder statesmen with a younger set of astronauts poised to learn from Frank and his friends. Ethan Glance and Roger Hines, as portrayed by Loren Dean and Courtney B. Vance, respectively, ride to space with the elder statesmen as part of Team Daedalus.\n\nIntrigue is found on the mission in space thanks to intrigue tracing back to the KGB. Powerful ramifications are felt for the men in space as well as for people in ground control. Flight director Gene Davis along with Hawk Hawkins love interest Sara Holland, as portrayed, respectively, by William Devane and Marcia Gay Harden, gain their feet in the second half of the movie; the subterfuge of General Vostove, as portrayed by Rade Serbedzija, is paired with a surprise dance partner that knew full well, along with Ethan, the true stakes in play in space. The departing shot of the movie, accompanied by the music of Frank Sinatra, provides a surprisingly uplifting joyous note to the closing of the movie.\n\nWriting credits for Space Cowboys rest with Ken Kaufman and Howard Klausner. I grant Space Cowboys as directed by Clint Eastwood 3.75-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, April 10, 2024\n\nReturning to our theme of the Olympics in the movies this week, we follow our look into Chariots of Fire (1981) on Wednesday with a film set some 72-years later at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. The film Richard Jewell (2019) at the center of this review looks not-so-much at the games themselves as it does the Atlanta Olympic Games bombing of 1996 and investigation into security guard Richard Jewell that followed.\n\n(From left, Sam Rockwell as Attorney Watson Bryant, Kathy Bates as Barbara ‘Bobi’ Jewell, Niko Nicotera as Dave Dutchess and Paul Walter Hauser as Richard ‘Radar’ Jewell in the Clint Eastwood film Richard Jewell).\n\nBased on the Vanity Fair article American Nightmare: The Ballad of Richard Jewell as well as the book The Suspect: An Olympic Bombing, the FBI, the Media, and Richard Jewell, the Man Caught in the Middle by Kent Alexander and Kevin Salwen, Clint Eastwood directed the film Richard Jewell. Richard ‘Radar’ Jewell was a security guard and want-to-be policeman during the summer of 1996, living at home with him mother, Barbara ‘Bobi’ Jewell. Paul Walter Hauser and Kathy Bates portray the son and mother, respectively.\n\nRichard Jewell‘s history and brief status as hero for saving people’s lives at the site of the bombing were prefaced with some of the security guard’s work history as a security guard at Piedmont College, which became known as Piedmont University in 2021. Some initial tips to the FBI combined with reporting through journalist Kathy Scruggs of The Atlanta-Journal Constitution led that conviction to change. Olivia Wilde portrayed Scruggs.\n\nThe zeal of Scruggs, the FBI officers, and even the administration of Piedmont College as portrayed in the film Richard Jewell offered legitimate drama to bringing in the legal and public face placed upon Richard Jewell and his mother, Bobi, during the period reviewed in the movie. Real estate attorney Watson Bryant, his assistant Nadya Light, and Jewell family friend David Dutchess each played roles aiming to support the Jewell perspective. Sam Rockwell, Nina Arianda and Niko Nicotera portrayed Bryant, Light and Dutchess, respectively.\n\nFor dramatic effect as well as for the ease of following the case leveled against Richard Jewell through the course of the film, FBI agent Tom Shaw feels like he was written as the combination of multiple players in the American law enforcement agency. Some facet of the same may be true for FBI agents Dan Bennet and Bruce Hughes. Jon Hamm, Ian Gomez and Dylan Kussman portrayed Shaw, Bennet and Hughes, respectively. The cumulative feeling that the Jewells should feel aggrieved by the shade cast upon them, and the story told through the course of the movie, is compelling.\n\nThat the film Richard Jewell goes so far as to demonstrate that the man Richard Jewell‘s name was legally cleared, if half-heartedly cleared in the court of public opinion, is a clear and direct message offered by the film. Some will see clear politics in the messaging of the film, which feels deliberate and mission accomplished for director Clint Eastwood. Follow your heart with whether to watch. I give Richard Jewell as directed by Clint Eastwood 3.75-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Saturday, July 17, 2021\n\nThere were the towns of Charlestown and Boston in Massachusetts, serving as characters just as distinctly as the people in the movie The Town (2010). There was the notion of burglary, armored trucks, banks, and Fenway Park serving as places just as distinctly as there were funny notions of love and loyalty. Finally, there was the resolution of criminals fighting the notion of getting pinched, all tracing back to the source story for The Town, based on the book Prince of Thieves by Chuck Hogan.\n\n(Slaine as Albert ‘Gloansy’ Magloan, Ben Affleck as Doug MacRay, Jeremy Renner as James Coughlin, and Owen Burke as Desmond Elden in The Town).\n\nBen Affleck plays Doug MacRay and Jeremy Renner plays James Coughlin, two members of a four member burglary set with Albert ‘Gloansy’ Magloan and Desmond Elden who rob banks and armored vehicles for money as a relatively practiced and efficient burglary ring having grown up in Charlestown. There is definite history among the group, which is revealed with suggested emotional depth through the film that at times is undersold by through the film. Renner is especially convincing in his role as Thomas Coughlin.\n\n(Jon Hamm as FBI S.A. Adam Frawley, left, and Rebecca Hall as Claire Keesey in The Town).\n\nAfter a burglary that includes the taking of a hostage, Doug MacRay takes a love interest in Claire Keesey, as played by Rebecca Hall. Seeing connections between this robbery and the organization run out of the flower business of a notorious criminal run by Fergus ‘Fergie’ Colm, FBI S.A. Adam Frawley and Dino Ciampa land pursue the criminals.\n\n(Pete Postlethwaite as Fergus ‘Fergie’ Colm, top, and Dennis McLaughlin as Rusty in The Town).\n\nJon Hamm plays FBI S.A. Adam Frawley while Pete Postlethwaite plays Fergus ‘Fergie’ Colm. Rusty aids Colm in the delivery of messages as appropriate in service of the larger enterprise, which eventually turns to the large heist that The Town is leading towards. The backdrop of their illegal enterprise is the store front of the flower shop run by Colm.\n\n(Left to right: Chris Cooper as Doug MacRay’s father Stephen MacRay, Blake Lively as James Coughlin’s sister and Doug MacRay’s baby mother Krista Coughlin, and Titus Welliver as Dino Ciampa, who grew up in Charlestown and serves as assistant to Adam Frawley in The Town).\n\nBesides the tension of the burglary, pressure to pull another heist, and the pull of family for James and Krista Coughlin, Doug and Stephen MacRay, and the added love angle with varying degrees of loyalty, time spent in jail, and the depths that some have gone and will go for these different constructs, that the past as well as place pull on each of these run deep. Even FBI man Dino Ciampa bears baggage in this tale, and the resonance is there and communicated well. That many of these culminate in a crowning jewel to these points in the story of Boston, and specifically Fenway Park, reinforces the larger pathos of many of these points in the story.\n\n(Ben Affleck as Doug MacRay and Jeremy Renner as James Coughlin outside Fenway Park in The Town).\n\nThe emotion and the questions underpinning this story are winners governing the telling of this story. The hardest part for me in giving the telling of this story through the cinematic telling of The Town is that I never believed Ben Affleck as Doug MacRay. It simply feels to me like Affleck wanted this role along with the telling of this story too much. The emotion of the character, as I felt, never really rang true for me. For a movie that I very much wanted to rate higher, I give The Town 3.50-stars on a scale of one-to-five.\n\nMatt – Monday, December 16, 2019"
