It was critical in our success for child care expenses and covid lock down. For us it never became a battle of office verses family. \nLast weekend we gathered the families of the office together and started designing the third space. We set aside a space in our office for our son at our first office and we are continuing that in the new office plus including our partners in the design. It’s a space that is neither work nor home but one that we can recharge and revitalize our attitude. I started out with acknowledging the most powerful person in the room.",
