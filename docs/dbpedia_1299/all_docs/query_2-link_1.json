        "text": "Real world article\n\n(written from a production point of view)\n\nMatt McColm (born 31 January 1965; age 59) is a stuntman and action actor who performed stunts as stunt double for Jonathan Frakes in the Star Trek: The Next Generation second season episodes \"Where Silence Has Lease\" and \"A Matter Of Honor\". Archive footage from the latter episode was later also seen in the episode \"Shades of Gray\". He received no on-screen credit for his performances. He is maybe best known for his portrayal of Johnny Domino/Night Man in Night Man (1997-1999, along Derek Webster and Felecia M. Bell) and more recently as Vick Chamberlain in three episodes of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (2008, with Thomas Dekker, Scott Leva, Scott Workman, Mark Wagner, and stunt coordinator Joel Kramer).\n\nMcColm performed stunts in the 1979 television movie The Night Rider, which featured Kim Cattrall, Percy Rodriguez, Whit Bissell, and Harris Yulin. This performance was followed by stunt work in the television series St. Elsewhere (1984, with Ed Begley, Jr., Ellen Bry, and Kavi Raz), Cagney & Lacey (1984, with Tina Lifford), The Fall Guy (1984-1985, along Gene LeBell, Leslie Hoffman, Chuck Hicks, and Vince Deadrick), and Riptide (1984-1985, with Rick Avery and Chris Doyle). Further stunt work include The Golden Child (1986), Maniac Cop (1988), Above the Law (1988, along Noon Orsatti and Spike Silver), Shakedown (1988, starring Peter Weller), Elvira: Mistress of the Dark (1988, with W. Morgan Sheppard and stunts by Greg Barnett and Tom Huff), Moonwalker (1988), and Cyborg (1989, with Alex Daniels and Jophery C. Brown).\n\nIn the 1990s, McColm performed stunts in A Gnome Named Gnorm (1990, with Mark Harelik), Problem Child (1990), Captain America (1990, with Ronny Cox, Michael Nouri, Bill Mumy, Gary Epper, and Jeff Imada), Knight Rider 2000 (1991, with Megan Butler and James Doohan), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), Beastmaster 2: Through the Portal of Time (1991), The Taking of Beverly Hills (1991, starring Matt Frewer), and Getting Even with Dad (1994, with Saul Rubinek).\n\nMcColm then focused more into action acting and portrayed leading roles in Red Scorpion 2 (1994, along John Savage) and the thriller Acts of Betrayal (1997), beside guest appearances in The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. (1994, with Brenda Bakke and Tom McCleister) and Baywatch (1991 and 1993, with Monte Markham, Greg Barnett, Robert Pine, and Susan Savage). After his performance as Night Man, McColm played a supporting role in Space Cowboys (2000, with James Cromwell), before he landed the role of Agent Thompson in The Matrix Reloaded (2003). He also voiced Agent Thompson for the 2003 video game Enter the Matrix.\n\nAfter a featured part in David Richard Ellis' Cellular (2004), McColm made guest performances in The L Word (2005), Criminal Minds (2005, with Tim Halligan), and CSI: Miami (2006, with Zach Grenier), beside stunt work for Daredevil (2003), Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003), Van Helsing (2004), Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), The Island (2005, with Ethan Phillips and Noa Tishby), Southland Tales (2006), and Apocalypto (2006).\n\nMore recently, McColm performed stunts in Next (2007, with Jim Beaver), Live Free or Die Hard (2007, with Tim Russ), and Transformers (2007, written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman). He also played a supporting role in Confessions of an Action Star (2008, with Lee Arenberg, Jeff Imada, Chris Palermo, and Chris O'Hara).\n\n[]"
