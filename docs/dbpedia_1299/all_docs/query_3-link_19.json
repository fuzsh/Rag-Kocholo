        "text": "Human studies with sclerostin-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies\n\nWhile numerous studies in animal models have clearly demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of sclerostin by administration of Scl-Ab leads to increased bone formation rates as well as significant improvements in bone mineral density (BMD) and bone structural strength [2–14], comparatively few studies in humans have been reported to date. In the first such human study [15], either placebo or a humanized monoclonal antibody to sclerostin (AMG 785 – later branded “romosozumab” by Amgen/UCB) was administered at various doses [i.e., subcutaneously (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 5, or 10 mg/kg) or intravenously (1 or 5 mg/kg)] to 72 healthy men and postmenopausal women (age range, 45 to 59 years) in a phase 1, single-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial. After 85 days of follow-up, no deaths or study discontinuations occurred, and only a single treatment-related serious adverse event (non-specific hepatitis) was reported. Thus, AMG 785 was generally well-tolerated and had minimal side effects.\n\nFurther, the single-dose effects of AMG 785 on bone metabolism and BMD were impressive [15]. Analyses of serum markers of bone turnover revealed dose-dependent increases in bone formation and decreases in bone resorption. Together, these divergent effects on bone metabolism created robust osteogenic responses as evidenced by significant increases in areal BMD derived from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans of the lumbar spine and hip in both men and women. Importantly, these findings suggest that Scl-Ab treatment is the first pharmacological approach with the ability to simultaneously stimulate bone formation and inhibit bone resorption in humans. Given the previously noted anabolic actions of Scl-Ab administration in various animal models [2–14], the observed increases in serum bone formation markers were expected. However, the latter finding of reduced serum levels of bone resorption markers was surprising given that the specific mechanism(s) responsible for this action is not known. Nevertheless, with these provocative findings, the stage was set to explore the utility of Scl-Ab treatment to prevent bone loss in longer duration studies.\n\nThe most convincing data to date demonstrating that pharmacological inhibition of sclerostin with Scl-Ab enhances bone health in humans come from a very recently published phase 2, multicenter, international, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial of the dose-related effects of romosozumab (AMG 785) on efficacy and safety over a 1-year period in 419 postmenopausal women (age range, 55 to 85 years) [16]. In this study, women with low areal BMD (T-scores between ≤−2.0 and ≥−3.5 at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck) were randomized to one of eight groups: subcutaneous romosozumab once monthly (70 mg, 140 mg, or 210 mg) or every 3 months (140 mg or 210 mg), placebo injections every 3 months, or active comparator drugs at standard clinically used doses and schedules – an anabolic agent (teriparatide; 20 μg once daily) or an anti-resorptive agent (alendronate; 70 mg once weekly). The primary and secondary study outcomes included safety, side effects, and changes in areal BMD and serum markers of bone turnover in the romosozumab-treated subjects as compared to subjects treated with placebo or the two active comparator drugs.\n\nThe study results were particularly noteworthy [16]. With the exception of mild injection-site reactions in response to subcutaneous romosozumab, side effects and adverse events were minimal and did not differ among groups. Thus, continuous administration of varying doses of romosozumab appears to be safe in humans, at least for up to 1 year. Further, in findings which virtually mirrored the previously studied single-dose regimen [15], significant increases in bone formation with simultaneous decreases in bone resorption were observed in subjects assigned to romosozumab. It is important to point out, however, that the early rapid peak in bone formation was only temporary (serum bone formation markers returned to baseline levels by 6 months), whereas the decrease in bone resorption was moderate, yet more sustained. The net result of these divergent effects was a strong positive balance in bone turnover. Consequently, all doses of romosozumab resulted in significant 1-year increases in DXA-derived areal BMD at the lumbar spine, with the higher doses appearing to be most effective (largest gain of 11.3% with the 210-mg monthly dose). Similar increases in areal BMD were observed at the total hip and femoral neck, but not at the wrist, in the groups randomized to romosozumab. By contrast, lesser changes were found in the placebo, alendronate, and teriparatide groups – consistent with their expected response profiles. Taken together, compared to placebo or active comparator agents, 1-year of romosozumab therapy was associated with a significant widening of the bone balance window, albeit only transiently, as well as impressive gains in DXA-derived areal BMD at the hip and lumbar spine in postmenopausal women with low bone mass [16].\n\nGiven the inability of DXA to measure bone structure or to distinguish between cortical and trabecular skeletal compartments, the effects of romosozumab on these parameters have been the subjects of additional recent research [17]. Indeed, in the same cohort of 419 postmenopausal women with low areal BMD described above [16], analysis of hip and lumbar spine quantitative computed tomography (QCT) scans revealed significantly increased volumetric (three-dimensional) BMD at both skeletal sites in women randomized to romosozumab as compared to those receiving either placebo or teriparatide [17]. The improvements in cortical and trabecular volumetric BMD at the hip and lumbar spine observed in these women lend further support to the continued investigation of romosozumab, as well as other Scl-Ab agents, in human clinical studies.\n\nGiven these impressive findings, it is of interest whether additional Scl-Ab drugs can be developed with similar success. Thus far, competition to romosozumab has been limited, although another humanized monoclonal antibody (branded “blosozumab” by Eli Lilly) has recently been developed to target and inhibit sclerostin. The first two phase 1 clinical studies of this drug in humans were recently conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single and multiple escalating doses (administered intravenously or subcutaneously) [18]. Blosozumab was well-tolerated with no safety concerns, and dose-dependent increases were observed in serum markers of bone formation and in lumbar spine areal BMD at day 85. Thus, similar to romosozumab, blosozumab appears to be safe and exhibited anabolic effects on bone density, lending further support to investigation of this drug as an alternative anabolic skeletal therapy.\n\nThis study also tested the important question of whether prior/current exposure to bisphosphonate therapy would alter the response to Scl-Ab treatment [18]. Indeed, many in the target osteoporotic population will have taken bisphosphonates, which can remain buried in the skeleton for many years, and previous data suggest the anabolic skeletal effects of teriparatide are blunted in patients with prior anti-resorptive exposure [19]. Interestingly, prior bisphosphonate use did not appear to significantly impact blosozumab-mediated effects on bone formation and BMD responses [18]. Nevertheless, because these data are preliminary, future studies will be needed to fully address this issue."
