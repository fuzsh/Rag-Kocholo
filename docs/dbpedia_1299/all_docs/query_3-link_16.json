        "text": "As I conclude my fifth year as UVU’s president, I am proud of what we have accomplished. Today, UVU is an innovative university and community college wrapped in one. With our open-admissions policy, we invite all students to “come as you are.” More than 43,000 have answered the call, joining together to create the largest university in the state. From 2022 to 2023, we helped 8,517 students earn 9,629 degrees and certificates. And we’re doing all we can to keep the cost of education affordable so that more students can keep climbing.\n\nWe have worked tirelessly to deliver on our commitment to include all students, regardless of background. We engage them with rigorous, meaningful learning opportunities and help them achieve their personal and professional goals for learning.\n\nI am grateful to everyone who helped our students succeed over the past year, including the Utah Legislature. Lawmakers funded traditional needs and supported innovative programs like the Native American Excellence Opportunity, which will help more than 800 Native American students find community and achieve their academic dreams at UVU. I also salute our outstanding faculty and staff who show up every day with the goal of making a difference for our students and each other.\n\nI’m also grateful to our generous benefactors, whose donations are an affirmation of the important work UVU is doing. More members of our community are joining them through EverGREEN, our first-ever comprehensive campaign for the university, which will support new programs and scholarships. You’ll read more about some of these transformative gifts in the following articles.\n\nThis past year, we refreshed UVU’s Vision 2030, a strategic, 10-year roadmap detailing our mission to meet the educational and workforce needs of UVU’s service region through 2030 and beyond. It was a wonderful opportunity to reflect on how UVU has provided exceptional care, exceptional accountability, and exceptional results while also setting goals to achieve even more. Our focus remains on helping our students succeed, whatever their dreams. To learn more, visit uvu.edu/vision2030/.\n\nOf all the things I’m proud of from the past year, the most inspiring examples come from our students, staff, and faculty. Their stories are the heart of this annual report. Please read them and enjoy. You’ll meet hard-working students who overcame challenges to achieve their goals. Athletes who experienced moments of triumph. Artists who brought meaning and joy to our community. And you’ll gain a new appreciation for the dedicated UVU faculty and staff who provide the “oxygen” for student growth every day.\n\nTogether, we’ve created a place of limitless possibilities. This is the real story of UVU.\n\nThank you for your support.\n\nWith warmest regards,\n\nDr. Astrid S. Tuminez\n\nPresident, Utah Valley University\n\nEmpowering\n\na Thriving\n\nCommunity\n\nUVU Latino Initiative serves growing community, individual needs\n\nUtah's population has transformed over the past decade with a rapidly expanding Latino community. According to United States Census data, 15% of Utahns are Latino, while 30% of Utahns under age 18 identify as racial or ethnic minorities — up from 24% in 2010.\n\nUtah Valley University has been well prepared to address this increase and help each student find success. In fall 2022, more than 5,000 students enrolled at UVU identified as Hispanic or Latino — about 12% of UVU’s total enrollment. In the halls and classrooms, on the athletic fields, on the stage, and in the community, Latino Wolverines have found a home at UVU.\n\nThe faculty and staff at UVU understand that each Latino student is an individual with different needs. One might be ready to thrive the moment classes begin. One might have grown up in Utah as a child of legal immigrants, with a desire to reconnect to their heritage. Another might be an international student on a visa. For another, obtaining financial aid might be their greatest need. Or overcoming the language barrier. Or finding suitable housing.\n\nIn other words: Addressing the educational needs of this rapidly rising demographic isn’t a one-size-fits-all proposition.\n\nLarge photo: Latinos of Tomorrow Summer Bridge Program participants tour UVU’s Orem Campus.\n\nUVU’s Latino Initiative was founded in 2007 with the aim to increase access, equitable educational opportunities, and enrollment and graduation rates for Latino students. Since then, it has helped thousands of Latino students at UVU thrive, earn degrees, and, most importantly, find a place for themselves in Utah Valley.\n\nElizabeth Nield, director of UVU’s Latino Initiative, said her vision is to provide services and programs to encourage inclusion, remove barriers, foster cultural competence through best practices, and guide students’ journeys to success. She wants to create a home away from home and a refuge for Latino students at UVU.\n\n“My students are my friends,” Nield said. “Even when they’ve finished school, they know they can consider you a friend. That’s the most important part I have seen.”\n\nIn addition to the Latino Initiative, UVU provides programs, activities, and events to help Latino students feel at home — in some cases, even before they’ve started attending classes.\n\nUVU offers three summer program options for high school students: Latino Scientists of Tomorrow, Engineers and Technologists of Tomorrow, and Business Leaders of Tomorrow. Each one is a tuition-free, 10-week course of classes and activities designed to increase the number of underrepresented students in Utah who graduate with STEM degrees.\n\nThe programs have been so successful that they’re now being piloted at six other universities across the nation, and they’ve received $2 million in support via a partnership with Dominion Energy.\n\n“About 85% of the students who complete the Latino Scientists of Tomorrow Summer Bridge Program come to UVU for at least one semester after graduating high school,” said Daniel Horns, dean of UVU’s College of Science and co-administrator of the Latinos of Tomorrow Summer Bridge Program. “About 40% of those students are majoring in a STEM field.”\n\nUVU also highlights resources, scholarships, and financial aid in numerous community outreach events at high schools and other places where families feel comfortable, meeting them where they are and providing information in Spanish to those who need it.\n\nUVU senior Hector Cedillo, president of UVU’s Latino Leadership Council, said the biggest thing he tries to communicate at these events is that there are no limits on what Latino kids can do in life.\n\n“Sometimes people think Latinos come to the U.S. just to work, you know, construction and restaurants, things like that,” Cedillo said, “When in reality, we have the potential, the capacity, the skills, the knowledge to become a CEO of a company, become a business owner. There are so many more things that we can do.”\n\nCedillo, a Mexico native who first immigrated to Connecticut before moving to Utah, said he was looking for that “home away from home” Nield described — something that can be a big obstacle for Latino students uncomfortable with the local language and culture.\n\n“I feel like the biggest challenge that we have is just being away from your loved ones, your family, your friends,” Cedillo said. “So you start talking to your classmates, your neighbors, and you pretty much create your own family here.”\n\nLatino-focused events at UVU, such as Bachata Fest and Celebración Latinoamericana, help students and community members preserve and embrace their cultures, even if they’re a long way from their countries of origin.\n\n“We don’t want students to lose their cultural background,” Nield said. “That’s so important for us. When another person knows about your culture, they can get to know you. You’re not putting on a mask. You don’t think, ‘Oh, I need to be another person, because I don’t fit here.’”\n\nTogether, these efforts earned UVU recognition as an Outstanding Member Institution by the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU), a nonprofit organization representing more than 500 colleges and universities in the U.S., Latin America, Spain, and school districts throughout the nation.\n\n“We are so grateful for the support from HACU as we continue to serve our growing and diverse communities,” said Kyle Reyes, UVU vice president of Institutional Advancement, who accepted the award at HACU’s annual conference in San Diego in October 2022. “Inclusivity is among [UVU’s] founding pillars. We have led the way in initiatives to open the door to success for everyone.”\n\nWhile the challenges of a college education can seem daunting and varied, Cedillo said the resources are here to help at UVU.\n\n“Regardless of your immigration status, if you’re from Utah or not, if you speak the language or not, college is really hard,” he said. “You need to have people around you. There are so many resources here. You just have to put in the effort and sacrifice. The sky is the limit.” ▀\n\nFaculty instructed UVU students about navigating cultural differences while teaching in Navajo Nation classrooms to help students build awareness of the world around them. Students on the trip earned the global/intercultural distinction on their transcripts, demonstrating that they have graduated with global and intercultural competencies and skills necessary for future employment and graduate school.\n\nElementary education students and twin sisters Sarahi and Arahi Salgado took this instruction to heart and developed a kinship with the Navajo students they taught.\n\n“Teaching at [TES], I was able to relate to the kids because I am a person of color,” Arahi Salgado said. “And not just because of that, but also because of my experiences at home. Some teachers have told [me] that a lot of students are absent much of the time, and that was our situation. Growing up, we were going through a hard time; our parents just got divorced. We were absent so much that we were behind … I want to be the one person in the room that says, ‘Hey, you‘re struggling. Let‘s do it together … It doesn‘t matter how many weeks it takes, but let‘s work.’”\n\nSarahi Salgado recalled a similar experience in TES.\n\n“I loved noticing how special our differences can be,” she said. “When we went into one of the classrooms, I started asking the kids questions like ‘What does your name mean?’ Because they all have unique names like my sister and I do. And ‘What other languages do you speak?’ … it was so beautiful to see the connections, even though we‘re so different in a way. I kind of saw myself in the kids.”\n\nThe student-teachers used lesson plans incorporating robotics from the UVU Creative Learning Studio. One such lesson was the Robot Mouse, which can be used to teach children lessons in geometry, algorithms, problem-solving, and coding — important STEM principles.\n\nWhile UVU students worked with children in classrooms, School of Education faculty Krista Ruggles, Mike Patch, Joey Foote, and Dean Vessela Ilieva worked with district staff to see how schools could integrate robotics into teachers’ lesson plans.\n\n“This effort is beneficial for both sides,” said Shannon Dewsnup, San Juan School District assessment director. “I think it‘s beneficial for the students to … get that hands-on experience to go into the classroom and work with these students. Our district is so unique; you’ll never find another across the whole United States.”\n\nIn just five days, UVU students experienced a kind of engaged learning no college class could ever teach.\n\n“This trip is a hands-on learning experience of how I can be more flexible in my teaching, and it‘s giving me that practice,” elementary education student Madison Pond said. “This has inspired me to make my lessons more engaging, more hands-on, where we can learn together.” ▀\n\nHerbert Institute for Public Policy Opens\n\nOn August 18, 2022, UVU celebrated the formal opening of the Gary R. Herbert Institute for Public Policy. The institute was built to be a voice for sound political thought, a facilitator of converging views, and an educator of the next generation of public policy leaders. Its mission is to “develop future policy leaders, gather the community, and build trust in civic institutions.”\n\nHundreds gathered at the Fugal Gateway Building for the dedication. Speakers included President Astrid S. Tuminez, Utah Governor Spencer Cox, Utah Senator Mike Lee, Utah State Representative Brad Wilson, and former Utah Governor Gary Herbert.\n\nAdditionally, the Larry H. and Gail Miller Family Foundation announced a donation of $500,000 in support of the institute, and America First Credit Union provided the institute with an endowed gift of $500,000 in support of student internships in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe institute intends to invite policymakers at all levels of government to speak and interact with students, faculty, and staff. It hosted former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence as a forum speaker in September 2022 and previously hosted speakers including Timothy Shriver, board chairman for the Special Olympics and founder of UNITE.\n\nThe Herbert Institute for Public Policy also offers paid legislative and congressional internships, giving UVU students the chance to work with Utah legislators from all political parties during annual Utah Legislative Sessions.\n\nNations Unite at UVU\n\nIn October 2022, UVU hosted “Why It Matters,” a United Nations-sponsored conference that brought nearly 1,000 attendees from around the world to UVU’s Orem Campus. Another 700+ people attended online, with sessions livestreamed in 80 languages.\n\n“This has been amazing — the welcome, the coordination, the teams. We could not have dreamt of anything like this. The quality and the diversity, the inclusion, the components like the service project, the fashion show. The support from UVU has been a dream,” said Felipe Queipo, UN communications officer.\n\nThe three-day conference welcomed academic experts on the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Conference organizer and UVU Chief Information Officer Baldomero Lago said the participation was “amazing.” “The quality of the panelists — it didn’t matter which panel I attended — it was just mind-blowing,” he said.\n\nEconomics and Finance Professor Brings Hope and Opportunity to Bangladesh\n\nOne rainy season 17 years ago, Abdus Samad, UVU professor of economics and finance, stood in a downpour in the Bangladesh farming village where he was born and raised. He watched as a group of schoolgirls struggled through the mud in flip-flops to a bus stop, where they were turned away because they had no money. They walked three miles to attend Ranbagha High School, mud flipping up onto their legs and clothing with each step, soaked to the skin and clinging to their wet schoolbooks.\n\n“It was really horrible. I was almost in tears. At that moment, I decided that I would build up a high school in this village,” Samad said. “Giving education is like giving eyesight to the blind. It is education and education alone that can help remove poverty, hunger, and social stratification. Education can provide self-confidence and dignity to them.”\n\nSamad began his dream school in 2005 by using his own money to buy the land. He received donations from friends and colleagues at UVU and supplemented that funding by teaching summer courses at the high school. Currently, there are 425 students studying in the school, where tuition is always free, and 75% of students are female.\n\nNursing Progam Focuses on Mentoring\n\nFrancine Jensen, associate professor and UVU Nursing Program coordinator, has long known the value of mentoring students. So when the decision was made to expand enrollment in the nursing program, Jensen advocated for starting a formal mentoring program for students.\n\nLast fall, 81 incoming nursing students were each assigned a faculty mentor who connects with the students regularly. Through these mentorships, students have been connected with various university resources to help them succeed, as well as find support through stressful moments in their coursework.\n\n“We feel strongly that the faculty-student mentor program demonstrates the exceptional care UVU is passionate about providing to students, and mentoring aligns closely with the values within the profession of nursing,” Jensen said.\n\nOne of the nursing students said this of the mentoring program: “My mentor encouraged me a lot and comforted me when I was frustrated.” Another added, “It was nice to be ‘seen’ by a specific faculty mentor.”"
