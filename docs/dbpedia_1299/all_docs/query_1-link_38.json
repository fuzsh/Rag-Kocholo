        "text": "Question: Was actor Lee Horsley ever a singer? My brother, who went to the University of Colorado, says there are photographs of him in school productions, some of which were musicals.\n\nAnswer: Horsley started in musicals. After college, he toured with several summer stock companies until he came to New York, where his rich voice landed him roles in productions such as 1776, George M and Damn Yankees. Several years later, with his dramatic career well established both on television and in films, he was asked by famed Broadway composer, Jerry Herman, to star in a production of his musical, Mack and Mabel.\n\nQuestion: If Roseanne's talk show goes down the tubes, will she go back to doing sitcoms?\n\nAnswer: During November sweeps, Roseanne was on every possible venue to tout her show. She has always been a scrapper, and she believes if she works hard enough to get people who have never seen the show to tune in for the first time, they'll like what they see and stay with her. Roseanne says if the show doesn't work out, she will make any decisions about the future when they have to be made.\n\nQuestion: I enjoy watching NightMan and would like to know something about the star, Matt McColm.\n\nAnswer: Actor/model/stunt actor Matt McColm, who plays both the hot jazz sax player, Johnny Domino, and his crime-fighting alter ego, NightMan, previously appeared in such series as Knight Rider, The Adventures of Briscoe County Jr. and The Fall Guy. His several feature film credits include Cyborg, opposite Jean-Claude van Damme, and Red Scorpion II. A successful model, Matt was the \"Chaps\" man for Ralph Lauren for eight years. Married, and with two daughters, McColm switched from mostly stunt acting for such stars as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Clint Eastwood and Steven Seagal, to straight acting after a close friend and colleague died when a stunt went wrong.\n\n_ Times wires"
