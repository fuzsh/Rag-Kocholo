With only six periods in place, work schedules laid out in the teacher contract could be affected.\n\nThe board also voted to cut department heads at the high school and replace them with “department specialists.” The specialists would have less planning time than their predecessors and a higher stipend. That stipend is negotiable.\n\nUnion president Barry Fike would not confirm the issues at stake, citing the importance of confidential negotiations. But he said at least five of the contract’s 25 articles may need to be re-negotiated in the wake of the cuts.\n\nGomez got more specific. He said the union, in preliminary discussions, has raised concerns over class size, work schedule, stipends for department heads at the high school, and a teacher evaluation program, involving peer review, that is built into the current contract.\n\nDistrict and union officials are scheduled to meet Monday night and set a start date for official negotiations. Both sides said they expect civil talks, but fireworks at the school board meeting Wednesday night suggest there may be turbulence ahead.\n\nAt the meeting, Fike criticized the district for failing to provide the union with financial and teacher retirement information.\n\n“BFT made a formal request for information to the district many days ago and we have yet to be handed one item on the list,” he said.\n\nSuperintendent Michele Lawrence countered that the district only heard about the request at a meeting with union officials two days before. Fike countered that the official request was first made two weeks prior, on Feb. 11.\n\nFike also attacked the district for scheduling layoff hearings during Spring Break, when many teachers have planned to go away on vacation. The hearings allow teachers to verify that the district has accurately accounted for their seniority, which plays a vital role in which teachers are cut.\n\n“The psychological trauma of receiving layoff notices is hard enough,” he said. “To purposefully schedule layoff hearings in such a way would clearly be adding insult to injury.”\n\nIn an interview Friday, two days after the board meeting, Associate Superintendent of Business Jerry Kurr said the district will address the union’s scheduling concerns.\n\n“If that is an issue with a lot of people, we won’t do that, because we don’t want to start in an adversarial mode,” said Kurr.\n\nStill, Kurr said the district does have some concerns about paying for substitutes to fill in for teachers with layoff hearings during the regular work week.\n\nWednesday night, the Board of Education voted to issue layoff notices to about 200 district employees. Roughly 150 of those employees are teachers or administrators who, if they have the proper credentials, could take a job in the classroom and “bump” a beginning teacher.\n\nThe Board, which needs to cut about $6 million by the end of the year, plans to rescind many of the layoff notices as the budget picture crystallizes in the coming months.\n\nPreservation awards to Encourage restoration\n\nFor more than 25 years national, state and local preservation groups have given annual awards to the owners, architects and contractors of buildings that have been restored, stabilized or adaptively reused in ways that are sensitive to the original building. The awards serve to demonstrate that old buildings can be reused, rehabilitated and given a new life and to encourage the preservation of older buildings. All types of buildings are eligible for these awards: from once common 1920s gas stations to warehouses, hotels, or single-family homes.\n\nThe building pictured here is the Town and Gown Club and it has received two preservation awards, one from the state-wide California Preservation Foundation, and one from the local organization, Berkeley Architectural Heritage Association.\n\nA building that receives an award need not be the work of a famous architect, but the Town and Gown Club happens to have been designed by Berkeley and the Bay Area's most famous architect, Bernard Maybeck. The building was constructed in 1899 and is one of Maybeck’s early surviving buildings; several from this period were destroyed in the 1923 Berkeley fire, and a few more have been lost to redevelopment.\n\nThe club building exemplifies Maybeck's interest in creating a visually interesting structure without the use of applied decoration. It is wood-frame construction and finished on the exterior with redwood shingles. The overhanging roof is supported by a system of outrigger joists and verticals wood pieces.\n\nRichard Longstreth in his book On the Edge of the World described the building: \"Maybeck was fascinated by the expressive potential of structural elements…[the club is] a tall, unadorned box with a structural cage that bursts out near the top, extending nearly six feet from the wall plane… This network projects just as far into the upstairs assembly room, where it appears to hang from the roof…the relationship of structure to space is made all the more tenuous by the absence of revealed posts…instead, the paneling and fireplace are improbably elongated, as if they hung from the beams.\" Stabilizing this building to make it safe for future generations of users and yet retain its unique character, required complex engineering and planning.\n\nThe Berkeley Architectural Heritage Association will present this year's awards on May 23. To nominate a building for an award, please call 841-2242.\n\nSusan Cerny is author of \"Berkeley Landmarks\" and writes this in conjunction with Berkeley Architectural Heritage Association.\n\nUC’s contradictory transit policy shows disregard for Berkeley\n\nEditor:\n\nThe University's Director of Transportation Nad Permaul asserts (Daily Planet, 2/28) that the University can't afford to follow the City's lead and provide its employees with Eco Pass transit passes that will allow them to ride A.C. Transit for free.\n\nThe cost, estimated at $60 per year per employee, is a drop in the bucket in relation to the University's overall compensation costs. It's also a drop in the bucket compared to the cost of building the planned Underhill parking structure. The University could provide all its employees with Eco Passes for the next 30 years for less than what it will cost to build the Underhill garage.\n\nThat UC thinks that Eco Pass is too expensive suggests that they view addressing the concerns of Berkeley citizens about as a very low priority.\n\nThe University is the largest generator of automobile traffic in the city. The volume of traffic and the traffic congestion in the neighborhoods surrounding campus is a real problem\n\nEncouraging more employees to use transit should be a high priority, especially if the University plans to expand.\n\nThe University's approach to transportation planning is internally contradictory. On the one hand, they have followed the lead of UC Santa Cruz and UC Davis and implemented a bus pass for students (the “Class Pass”). They have a shuttle bus system that serves the campus. But on the other hand, they charge below market rates for parking and plan to add a huge amount of additional parking at Underhill, which will encourage more people to drive.\n\nEco Pass programs in Denver and Boulder, Colorado, and in Santa Clara County have succeeded in increasing transit ridership and reducing automobile trips.\n\nIf UC can't manage to take this basic step, then they shouldn't be surprised if every one of their proposed developments meets opposition from Berkeley citizens and their elected representatives.\n\nUniversity officials are constantly saying that they want to work cooperatively with the City. Actions speak louder than words. Implementing Eco Pass for their employees would signal that they are serious about cooperation.\n\nRob Wrenn\n\nPlanning Commission\n\nBerkeley\n\nMuseum explores possibility of life beyond Earth\n\nNEW YORK — Is there life beyond Earth? A new computer-generated show at the American Museum of Natural History probes the question by taking viewers from the blackest depths of the ocean to the cosmos outside the Milky Way galaxy.\n\nIt’s quite a ride. The journey unfolds on the domed ceiling of the circular theater, where images from seven huge projectors form sights like a panorama of the surface of Mars. It feels like you’re riding some kind of magic whale that can rise with speed and grace from the deep ocean to slip through the clouds and soar through outer space.\n\n“The Search for Life: Are We Alone?” replaces “Passport to the Universe,” which took more than 3 million viewers on a different cosmic voyage during its two-year run at the museum’s Hayden Planetarium. The original show, narrated by Tom Hanks, may return later.\n\nHarrison Ford takes over the narrating duties in the new 23-minute production, which the museum developed with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\nThe new show continues the idea of sweating the scientific details. The 25,000 stars it shows in the Milky Way galaxy are in the right spots; so are the 28,000 other galaxies it depicts. And when audience members watch cosmic clouds condense to form stars, they’re seeing the results of mathematical simulations designed to understand that process.\n\nFor a lay audience of museumgoers, isn’t this overkill?\n\n“We’re a scientific institution. Our goal is to educate. ... We want to actually show the science,” replied Anthony Braun, executive producer for the museum’s Rose Center for Earth and Space.\n\nQuite properly, the show doesn’t claim to answer the question of whether there’s life in outer space, because scientists don’t know. A lay person who has paid attention to the topic won’t hear any startling insights here either. But the presentation does review key points that scientists are pondering.\n\nThe visit to the deep ocean, for example, shows a perpetually dark environment where scalding hot water spurts from the bowels of Earth — and where some organisms thrive. “Life is tougher than we thought,” Ford remarks.\n\nThe show also notes the fairly recent discoveries of dozens of planets outside the solar system, illustrating the idea that the universe contains plenty of places where life might spring up. “What are the odds that our planet is the only one with life?” Ford asks.\n\nSome of these distant “exoplanets” have already been reached by radio and TV waves from old transmissions on Earth, the show notes. You have to wonder what any distant life form would conclude about whether there’s intelligent life on Earth.\n\nFord also notes that two favorite potential spots for life are much closer to home: Mars and Europa, a moon of Jupiter. Viewers check out Mars with a 360-degree image of its surface, courtesy of the 1997 Pathfinder mission.\n\nFor all its focus on the possibility of life beyond, the show’s closing words remind viewers that there’s work to be done at home, too.\n\n“If we can learn to protect our only home in the cosmos and the life that it brought forth,” Ford says, “just think of the new worlds, and ways of being alive, that we might discover.”\n\nOut & About Calendar\n\nSaturday, March 2\n\nThe 2002 White Elephant\n\nSale\n\n9 a.m. - 4 p.m.\n\nWhite Elephant Warehouse\n\n333 Lancaster St., Oakland\n\nThe 42nd annual White Elephant Sale, benefiting the Oakland Museum.

After all, both DaShawn Freeman and John Sharper will play Division I college ball next season. Any accolades left over usually are heaped upon forward Chase Moore, a multi-talented three-sport athlete. But on Friday night against Bishop O’Dowd, it was center Simon Knight who paved the way for the Panthers to play for the North Coast Section title tonight.\n\nKnight scored 22 points, pulled down 11 rebounds and pilfered 5 steals against the third-seeded Dragons, showing a nice midrange touch to complement his inside game. The 6-foot-8 junior made his first eight shots of the game and missed just one shot before garbage time of the 74-63 St. Mary’s victory.\n\n“Everyone on this team can play,” said Knight, who put up 100 jumpers from each end of the free throw line during Thursday’s practice. “I can shoot, and the coaches told me to take my time.”\n\nSt. Mary’s head coach Jose Caraballo was effusive in his praise of his biggest player.\n\n“Simon had the game of his life tonight,” Caraballo said. “He was just outstanding. He played his ass off.”\n\nThe Panthers got off to a quick start, jumping out to a 6-0 lead, and never looked back. O’Dowd never even managed to tie the game, getting within a point at 23-22 early in the second quarter. But every time the Dragons made a run, St. Mary’s would hit a couple of baskets to get some breathing room.\n\n“We were patient, and we got back in the ballgame a couple of times,” O’Dowd head coach Pat Phelps said. “But we were just outmanned.”\n\nKnight’s outburst was such a surprise, even the Dragons didn’t seem to know who he was. Dave Brutucao-Kemp, who scored 12 points on four 3-pointers for O’Dowd, couldn’t come up with Knight’s name after the game.\n\n“Their big guy had a great game,” he said. “We just had no answer for him.”\n\nAfter a Andrew Lemke basket got O’Dowd within a point at 23-22, Knight took over, scoring 8 points during an 11-1 St. Mary’s run.\n\nIn the second half, Knight hit his eighth straight shot to give the Panthers their biggest lead of the game, 49-33. The Dragons would get no closer than seven points for the remainder of the game, as Freeman and Sharper avoided turnovers and hit key free throws down the stretch.\n\nFor Caraballo, who played for Phelps, the win was special.\n\n“I played for Phelps, and he’s got record wins and a great program,” Caraballo said. “He took us off his schedule this year, and my kids were fired up. But the most important thing is that we get to play again.”\n\nThe Panthers face top-seeded De La Salle tonight at 8 p.m. at Haas Pavilion for the championship. De La Salle is the defending Northern California Division I champion, but St. Mary’s will be fired up to play on the Bay Area’s biggest stage.\n\n“We’ve been wanting De La Salle all season,” Freeman said. “They’ve been ranked ahead of us, and we have a chance to prove everyone wrong.”\n\nLady ’Jackets take it easy, still get by San Leandro\n\nThe Berkeley High girls’ basketball team gave an uninspired effort on Friday night against San Leandro, but it was still enough for an easy 59-46 victory in the North Coast Section Division I semifinals.\n\nThe top-seeded Lady ’Jackets face No. 2 Pittsburg tonight at Haas Pavilion for the NCS title. The game will start at 6 p.m.\n\nBerkeley got 15 points and 10 rebounds from senior forward Sabrina Keys and 11 points from senior guard Angelita Hutton.\n\nThe ’Jackets were bigger and faster than the Lady Pirates, but they didn’t force as many turnovers as usual, tallying just two steals in the game. But Berkeley’s defense was still solid as they held Pittsburg to 15-for-63 (24 percent) shooting from the floor. Guard Jen King led the Pirates with 14 points, but shot just 5-for-22 as her team’s primary offensive weapon. Jackie Levesque scored 12 points for Pittsburg.\n\nThe ’Jackets jumped out to a 16-2 lead in the first quarter, and Natasha Bailey hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer for a 19-4 edge at the first break. Pittsburg managed to cut the deficit to eight points at 25-17 just before halftime, but would get no closer. They started the third quarter with a 1-for-16 shooting slump, letting the ’Jackets take a 22-point lead. The Pirates refused to let up, however, fouling and scrapping for points until the bitter end.\n\nBerkeley head coach Gene Nakamura waited until there was a little more than a minute left in the game to bring in his five promoted junior varsity players. The squad, which outscored first-round opponent McKinleyville to end the game, ran even with Pittsburg, 7-7.\n\nStudents brings clip and bullets to class\n\nA sixth-grade student brought a clip with several bullets to Longfellow Middle School earlier this week, according to school and police officials.\n\nLongfellow Principal Bill Dwyer said the student, who has been suspended, got the clip from an uncle’s gun.\n\n“I think it was just foolishness,” he said. “We weren’t aware of a violent threat, or any plan.”\n\nLt. Cynthia Harris, spokesperson for the Berkeley Police Department, said the student was booked. But, as a first-time offender, she said, the student will likely be referred to Alameda County’s Youth Court program.\n\nThe program, which stages mock trials run by youth, generally sentences offenders to community service.\n\nPolly Armstrong offered more to Berkeley than flags\n\nEditor:\n\nI read in the Planet that Councilmember Polly Armstrong is leaving. I know for most people she will be remembered as “the orange flag lady.”\n\nHowever, from someone who is admittedly single-issue focused, I honestly believe Harrison Park (and I imagine a number of other things) would not be there except for her willingness to support the project.\n\nVery early in our effort to get Harrison Park developed we had our usual crowd of kids and parents waving their green “We Need More Playing Fields” signs. And the council was all smiles as child after child came to the microphone.\n\nAt 11:30 that night, the once packed audience now nothing but a few stragglers, the council took up the discussion of the park.\n\nOne councilmember talked about how expensive the park was going to be, several said nothing. There was a lull in the conversation. And Polly spoke, “When all these people were in front of us we were more than happy to indicate we supported their cause. Now that they aren't here we don't have much to say. Well, I for one think we need these playing fields and I think we owe it to these kids and parents to give them what they have asked for.”\n\nThe council voted to option the land and the process of Harrison Park was started.\n\nSo the children and adults who play on these and other fields in the City of Berkeley, we owe you a debt that can never be repaid. You made a difference.\n\nSorry to see you go.\n\nDoug Fielding\n\nChairperson\n\nAssociation of Sports Field Users\n\nTV news making little progress in reflecting minorities, study says\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — For the first time in five years, no black reporter was among the top 25 on the network evening news programs in 2001, as measured by the amount of stories they reported, according to a study released Thursday.\n\nByron Pitts of CBS and Pierre Thomas of ABC were tied for 28th place with 72 appearances on their news programs, said the study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs.\n\nOnly one other black reporter — Randall Pinkston of CBS — was in the top 50, the center said. A year earlier, two black reporters made the top 10.\n\nOverall, the study found that the number of stories reported by all minorities and women were up slightly over 2000. Eighty-eight percent of the stories were reported by whites and 75 percent by men, the report said.\n\nThe most visible network news reporter last year was John Roberts on CBS, who reported 177 stories. Robert Hager was the leader at NBC with 159 stories, followed by Terry Moran’s 138 stories on ABC, the center said.\n\nUCLA ends Cal’s season\n\nEUGENE, Ore. – Cal had a chance to extend its season on a long Jackie Lord 3-point shot, but UCLA held on to eliminate the Golden Bears, 46-42, in the first round of the Pac-10 Women’s Basketball Tournament.\n\nThe Bruins held a 45-42 lead with eight seconds remaining, when Lord took a deep shot that could have tied the game. But she missed, the ball fell to UCLA’s Whitney Jones, who was fouled and made one of two free throws to ice the game.\n\nCal ended its season with a 7-21 record (2-16 in the Pac-10), while UCLA improved to 9-19 (4-14). The Bruins, who swept Cal in three games this season, moved on to play Stanford in the second round of the tournament.\n\n“It was so low-scoring, it might not have been a great game from a fan perspective,” Cal coach Caren Horstmeyer said, “but from the athletes’ perspective, I think you saw a great game with two teams that battled.”\n\nCal lost despite a strong performance by senior center Ami Forney, who had a double-double with 11 points and 12 rebounds in her final college game.\n\nThe Bears did come out strong, taking a 16-14 lead as they battled a tough UCLA 2-3 zone. Early on, the Bears did everything Horstmeyer wanted them to do – get points in transition, reverse the ball, even make a rare 3-pointer. Cal also tied a season high with 16 steals.\n\n“I thought our team was a little nervous,” UCLA coach Kathy Olivier said. “We played them twice and beat them twice. We felt like Cal had nothing to lose.”\n\n“Early in the game we played our gameplan,” Horstmeyer said “and then we fell into exactly what UCLA wanted us to do. Where we lacked a little bit was our shot selection.”\n\nCal shot poorly for the third time this year against UCLA, making just 16 of 59 shots for a 27.1 field goal percentage.\n\nUCLA shot just 30.4 percent itself but got a virtuoso performance from reserve guard Gennifer Arranaga, who scored a game-high 17 points on 7-of-10 shooting from the field and 3-of-4 from the free throw line.\n\nArranaga scored on a variety of jumpers and drives to the basket, often finishing UCLA fast breaks or secondary breaks.\n\n“Nat [Nakase] was telling me to run,” Arranaga said. “I’ve got a nickname, Speedy Gonzales, to live up to on the team.”\n\nIn the second half, with Cal up 30-26, UCLA slapped the Bears with a 13-0 run sparked by seven points from Arranaga.\n\nCal fought back to within 43-42 with a 12-4 run.\n\nForney, along with reserve guard Janet Franey, are the lone seniors on this year’s squad.\n\n“We had a great career, even though we didn’t win,” Forney said. “I don't think it was as bad as people think. I like to use it as a positive, because we had to fight through tough situations.”\n\nFire fighters say they got burned in negotiations\n\nUnion reps want city to come back to the bargaining table\n\nBerkeley fire fighters want the city to know they are serious about renegotiating their 2000-2004 contract.\n\nThey showed up in full force at Tuesday’s City Council meeting, making a sea of blue several rows deep. Several fire fighters stood up to testify to the dedicated service and bravery of their colleagues in order to convince the city to give them a fair shake.\n\nWhen the fire fighters negotiated their compensation package in 2000, they agreed to give up 7.75 percent of their wages each year to qualify immediately for a new benefits package enacted by the state of California called “3 percent at 50.”\n\nIn this new California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), retirement benefits would amount to a certain percentage of a public safety officer’s highest year of earnings, determined by multiplying 3 percent times the number of years of service. The previous system gave public safety officers 2.5 percent at 50.\n\n“At the time we were negotiating with the city, we knew that to enjoy the benefits, it would not be free. We’d have to give something up,” said Rick Guzman, who is president of the Berkeley Fire Fighters Association and has been a fire fighter for 16 years.\n\nSo Berkeley firefighters went two years with no raises – not even cost-of-living adjustments – so that members who were on the verge of retirement in 2000 could take advantage of the new program.\n\nBut when the police department settled their contract a year later, the city agreed not to trade cost-of-living adjustment raises for the CalPERS benefits.\n\n“Basically, the cops got an increase in salary and the city to pay for CalPERS,” said Guzman.\n\nBut Randolph Files, president of the Berkeley Police Association, did not see it this way. “There was a trade-off of money versus time,” he said.\n\nAlthough the two unions went into negotiations together, the fire fighters separated to negotiate a contract that would put the benefits in place in July 2000. Police officers’ benefits do not kick in until July of this year. Moreover, the police officers’ contract is also six-years long, while the fire fighters’ is four.\n\n“You’re comparing oranges and jet-skis,” said David Hodgkins, Employee Relations Officer for the city.\n\n“Everyone pays for it in one way or another. When you’re bargaining with unions, they see their interests differently. They carve up the money in different ways,” he said.\n\nNevertheless, said Guzman, “We’re pissed.” The fire fighters want to bring the city back to the bargaining table.\n\nA “zipper clause” in contract negotiations, however, says that both sides must agree to come back to the table. The city can only re-enter negotiations if the City Council gives Human Resources the go-ahead. This is why the fire fighters were at Tuesday night’s meeting.\n\nAlthough Mayor Shirley Dean proposed a resolution on Tuesday that would have immediately granted fire fighters a 7 percent pay raise effective this July, she withdrew her proposal. The City Council instead adopted Kriss Worthington’s proposal that the City Manager consider an “equitable policy in implementing new state retirement rules for firefighters and for all city employees” in the city’s regular budget process.\n\nThe union is now preparing information for city officials that will compare their compensation packages to those of other fire departments in the Bay Area. Guzman said it should be in the city’s hands by next week.\n\nFire fighters will know by April whether the City Manager puts their raise in his recommendations. The budget will be finalized in June by a City Council vote.\n\n“This is super-fast-forward in government time for something that’s going to cost nearly a million dollars,” said Worthington.\n\nAlthough he said he was sympathetic to the fire fighters’ request at the Tuesday meeting, he could not give them the money on the spot.\n\n“That would not have been fiscally responsible. As elected officers know, there’s no instant gratification in government,” he said.\n\nHodgkins would not comment on whether he thought the existing contracts were fair or whether he wanted to re-open negotiations.\n\n“I think we have a contract and I will abide by the conditions therein,” Hodgkins said. “I will do as the council directs.”\n\nThis isn’t enough for fire fighters. “They’re dragging their feet,” said Guzman. “First it was that, then it was this. Now they say they don’t have the money to do it,” said Guzman.\n\n“I had a bad feeling about it when we signed the contract. I was afraid they would give it to the cops and change it on us.”\n\nBut the police officers, for their part, hope that the difference in contracts does not cause bad blood between the two unions. “They’re a labor union, so we support them,” said Files. “If they’re treated unfairly, we ask the city to treat them fairly, just like any labor group.”\n\nDon’t let budget cuts rob Berkeley High of distinction\n\nEditor:\n\nBerkeley High School has in recent years been plagued by arson attacks, achievement gaps, ephemeral principals and countless other problems. The only thing holding the school together is the fantastic education that it offers to its students.\n\nWell, it seems that now that's gone too.\n\nThe Berkeley School Board's decision to reduce the schedule to six periods will have a devastating effect on the students' education. Double-period science — a program that is likely to be cut — allows students to take first-year advanced placement classes, has consistently given students an advantage when applying to college, and it offers a great understanding of the sciences.\n\nThe elective program, which provides students with a diversity of skills and includes classes in art, music, and dance, will also suffer.\n\nEverything that is great about a Berkeley High education will disappear and Berkeley High will become indistinguishable from any other high school in the nation.\n\nIt is obvious that the school board needs to cut back on something — but is taking away what makes Berkeley High unique the answer?\n\nGordon Jenkins\n\nstudent of Berkeley High school.\n\nFormer Clinton aids go Hollywood\n\nLOS ANGELES — Two former strategists for President Clinton were hired as consultants for the Screen Actors Guild during negotiations with the Association of Talent Agents.\n\nMark Fabiani and Christopher Lehane began working for the actors union in January. Fabiani was behind the scenes while Clinton fought off allegations in the Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky investigations. Lehane worked in the White House counsel’s office while Clinton was in office.\n\nBoth men were asked to consult for the union in case either an impasse or agreement was struck with the talent agents group, SAG officials said Thursday.\n\nThe two groups reached a tentative agreement last weekend that would allow talent agencies to make and receive investments in production companies.\n\nThe agreement would loosen existing rules, in place since 1939, to protect actors from exploitation by agents working on behalf of producers or studios.\n\nUnder the proposed contract, independent production companies and large advertisers would be allowed to invest as much as 20 percent in a talent agency. Movie studios and television networks still would be banned from owning or investing in a talent agency.\n\nThe deal still must be approved by SAG’s board of directors and membership and ratified by the talent agencies.\n\nBHS baseball starts season with a win\n\nThe Berkeley High Yellowjackets scored five runs in the first three innings, then held on to beat California High 5-3 on Friday in the ’Jackets’ season opener at San Pablo Park.\n\nJunior Sean Souders threw five innings for the win, giving up one earned run on four hits while striking out six. Ethan Friedman earned the save by retiring the last four Grizzly batters.\n\nBerkeley scored three of their runs in the second inning. Bennie Goldenberg led off with a walk from California starter Adam Brizentine, and Jason Moore’s grounder was kicked by shortstop Spike McDougal. Designated hitter Jeremy Riesenfeld followed with a single to bring home Goldenberg. Brizentine plunked Sam Geaney with his next pitch, but Geaney was forced at second on Lee Franklin’s grounder, with Moore scoring on the play. Rightfielder Jeremy LeBeau drove in the last run with a double to the gap in right, giving the ’Jackets a 4-0 lead.\n\nBerkeley tacked on another run in the next inning, with Clinton Calhoun singling, stealing second and scoring on a single by Moore.\n\nThat was all the lead Souders and the bullpen would need. Souders was solid through five innings, giving up just one run, a homer by California first baseman Andrew Worswick. Coming out to start the sixth, however, Souders surrendered two straight singles, prompting Berkeley head coach Tim Moellering to pull him in favor of Andre Sternberg, one of Moellering’s four southpaws.\n\nSternberg struck out Mike Ancin, but walked McDougal to load the bases. Sternberg’s bore down to get Worswick to hit a comebacker, getting the force at the plate for the second out.\n\nSternberg’s first pitch to the next batter, Justin Langro, was wild, allowing a run to score. Sternberg hurt his throwing shoulder on the pitch, the same shoulder that kept him out much of last season, and left the game.\n\n“I have four outstanding lefties, so I’m not too worried about having a righty in there,” Moellering said. “But I am concerned if we lose Andre for any length of time.”\n\nMoellering called on Friedman, yet another lefty. Langro hit a grounder up the middle that second baseman Franklin stopped with no throw to first. McDougal scored, but Franklin caught Worswick too far past third base and caught him in a rundown, with Friedman applying the final tag.\n\nFriedman set down the Grizzlies in order in the seventh inning for the save.\n\nVoter turnout estimates below average\n\nWith Election Day approaching, California Secretary of State Bill Jones is predicting that only about 36 percent of eligible voters will bother to cast ballots on Tuesday.\n\nLocal Bay Area officials interviewed today have similarly low expectations.\n\nJones cited a number of factors as contributing to the poor expected turnout, including the earliest primary in state history, the lack of high-profile ballot measures and the international war on terrorism.\n\n“Because of the competition for voter attention, the early election date and a variety of other factors, we estimate that the turnout of registered voters this March will be approximately 36 percent,” Jones said.\n\nHe said a later than usual February Super Bowl and the recently concluded Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City also may have siphoned some of the interest away from the election.\n\nJones said the tight three-way race for the Republican gubernatorial nomination could help elevate turnout though. In addition, he said that the removal of more than 2 million ineligible voters from the rolls in recent years should help provide a more accurate depiction of voter participation.\n\nContra Costa County elections officials said today they are anticipating a turnout of roughly 40 percent on Election Day. Alameda County Assistant Registrar Elaine Ginnold said they are expecting a 38 percent turnout.\n\n“It’s disappointing considering we spent six months preparing for it,” Ginnold said.\n\nSan Francisco Department of Elections Director Tammy Haygood, however, said today that she does not prognosticate.\n\n“We don't predict turnout, we count votes,” Haygood said. “We’re just encouraging people to vote.” Haygood joined Jones in reminding voters that the election will operate as a \"modified primary'' because of the U.S. Supreme Court's invalidation of California's open primary initiative.\n\nAs a result, voters who are registered with a political party may vote only for candidates in their own party. Voters who declined to state a party affiliation when they registered to vote may request the ballot for one of the four political parties that have opened up their primary to nonpartisan registrants. Those are the Democratic, Republican, American Independent and Natural Law partiesHaygood also reminded voters to check their polling places, which might have changed due to redistricting.Election information is available online at http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections/elections.htm.\n\nCounty school board members, who do you represent?\n\nEditor:\n\nBecause of my own involvement in Berkeley schools, I am very interested in the candidates for our representative on the Alameda County Board of Education.\n\nI don't exactly understand what role the candidate elected will play as the representative from our area.\n\nThe reason for my confusion, is because in all of my years as an active parent in the Berkeley schools, I have never met the incumbent. And I have only actually seen him once.\n\nThat was when Alameda County Superintendent Sheila Jordan was presenting her budget concerns to our school board. He wasn't actually involved in the presentation, but he did introduce himself.\n\nPersonally, I expect more from a candidate.\n\nI expect that person to spend time observing our schools, as well as our board. How else can they make intelligent decisions in regard to education?\n\nI want him/her to develop the kind of relationship with our principals and administration that foster a line of communication that might help us to foresee problems, before we are in the kind of budget situation we're in now.\n\nAnd I believe that Jacki Fox Ruby is that person.\n\nShe has played a very active role in our schools in the past, and I am really glad that she has found a way to continue in that role.\n\nJacki knows our schools and better understands our needs.\n\nMark A. Coplan\n\nWillard Parent\n\nDisneyland forced to test the air\n\nANAHEIM — Responding to residents’ complaints that fireworks shows at the Disneyland Resort are polluting their neighborhood, a regional agency will test air particles to collect any residue.\n\nThe South Coast Air Quality Management District will place glass plates in neighborhoods upwind and downwind from the resort later this month to determine whether ash and other products such as aluminum and magnesium are being left behind.\n\n“If we have some sort of measurable residue, we’ll make a determination whether additional sampling should be done and what type,” said Carol Coy, AQMD’s deputy executive officer of engineering and compliance. “This is just the first step.”\n\nDisney has increased the number of fireworks shows over the past two years. Park officials said they support the testing to ensure compliance with state regulations.\n\nPeople who live near the resort believe long-term exposure to the fireworks residue may be harmful.\n\n“I think there needs to be some follow up for people who have been exposed to this for a long time,” Anaheim resident Amy Davis said. “Nobody is tracking the health issues.”\n\nLocal activists return from Cuban\n\nUrban agriculture, freedom of the press and nationalized health care.\n\nThese were just a few of the issues explored by a delegation of seventeen local environmentalists and journalists in a recent nine-day trip to Cuba.\n\n“It’s really interesting to see an alternative way of doing things,” said Beck Cowles, program manager for the Ecology Center, a Berkeley-based environmental group. “Cuba has a lot of lessons for us.”\n\nThe Ecology Center co-sponsored the Feb. 15-24 journey with the Media Alliance, a left-leaning San Francisco resource and training center for activists and journalists.\n\nThe group, which spent time in the capital city of Havana and the rural province of Pinar del Rio, visited a pair of radio stations, a facility which produces chamomile and aloe vera for medicinal purposes, and a local doctor participating in Cuba’s system of nationalized health care.\n\nBut Martin Bourque, executive director of the Ecology Center, which runs Berkeley’s twice-weekly Farmers Market, said Cuba’s support of urban agriculture was particularly interesting.\n\nBourque, editor of a new book called “Sustainable Agriculture and Resistance: Transforming Food Production in Cuba,” said the island country began an intensive urban agriculture program in the early-1990s, during the height of an economic recession.\n\nWith the countryside struggling to produce and transport an adequate supply of crops to the cities, he said, the government gave away land to urban residents willing to produce crops. Today, according to Bourque, one-third of Cuban produce comes from city gardens.\n\nBourque praised the city of Berkeley and the Berkeley Unified School District for passing innovative food policies that emphasize local production. But, he added that Berkeley could learn something from the more comprehensive Cuban model.\n\n“What we don’t have is a real political will, or institutional support,” said Bourque, noting that Havana has 200 city employees dedicated to urban agriculture, while Berkeley’s only professional is a specialist at UC Berkeley’s Extension School.\n\nRebeka Rodriguez, program director for Media Alliance, said the radio stations the group visited made do with limited resources.\n\n“My impression of the stations we visited is that they were extremely underfunded, poorly-equipped stations,” she said, “and despite these obstacles, they were able to disseminate information broadly.”\n\nA station the group visited in Vinales, a small town in Pinar del Rio, made use of simple cassettes and a telephone to transmit news to a larger station in the city of Pinar del Rio for broadcast, Rodriguez said.\n\nBourque said the exchange of ideas in the press was limited, but not as limited as some Americans might think.\n\n“Any fundamental critique of the government isn’t reported,” he said. “But there is a lot of debate within the system. I think that’s something people miss when they say, ‘oh, it’s state-run media.’ ”\n\nBourque added that the Cuban media does not dig into the personal lives of politicians like the American media.\n\n“It’s refreshing. Why should we spend so much time on a president’s personal life,” he asked, in reference to the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, “when there are such pressing public issues?”\n\nNEW OF THE WEIRD\n\nPhilly lures fugitives with phony mail, cash promises\n\nPHILADELPHIA — They thought they were getting money owed to them by the city. Instead, more than six dozen fugitives got arrested.\n\nUsing a phony city agency and fake letters promising big bucks, Philadelphia police lured 80 fugitives into a trap over the last two months.\n\nDetectives sent out letters from the fictional Office of Municipal Audit and Disbursement to 549 fugitives wanted for crimes ranging from burglary to fraud. The letter said that the agency owed the fugitives $1,320.27 in unpaid benefits and they could get the check at the office.\n\nA fake office was set up near other city offices. When the cash-motivated fugitives arrived in the waiting room, a staff member would ask them to go into the next room to sign for the checks.\n\nInstead of a fat check, the room was full of detectives waiting to escort the fugitive into a police car.\n\n“It was just con men being conned. Greed took over,” Sgt. Joe Motto said.\n\nArrests included 27 people charged with assault and battery, nine charged with burglary and 10 charged with robbery.\n\nFarmer claimed to lost herd\n\nPITTSBURGH — Call it the “Little Bo Peep” ploy.\n\nA dairy farmer has admitted he tried to hide his assets, including 200 head of cattle, from creditors and federal agents by claiming he couldn’t find them.\n\nVern E. Over has pleaded guilty to concealment of assets and bankruptcy fraud for selling livestock and equipment from his Clarion County dairy farm and then telling a bankruptcy trustee and FBI agents he didn’t know where they went, according to court documents.\n\nOver has also agreed to tell authorities what happened to the missing property.\n\nAccording to court documents and his lawyer, Michael Witherel, Over sold some of the items after he filed for bankruptcy in 1994.\n\nWhen his western Pennsylvania farm was being liquidated a year later to pay creditors, a bankruptcy trustee couldn’t count the cattle, tractors, wagon, plows and other farm equipment because they were gone.\n\n“There’s no question that things were sold,” Witherel said. “He’s a good and decent man who shouldn’t have done what he did and he’s going to pay the price.”\n\nOver could face five years in prison under sentencing guidelines, but Witherel said he would likely get no more than 1 1/2 years.\n\nBall club bans bin Laden from their bobbleheads dolls\n\nHAGERSTOWN, Md. — Bobblehead dolls are a popular promotion at ball games, but a minor league baseball team decided that Osama bin Laden’s head doesn’t belong on them.\n\nThe Hagerstown Suns, an affiliate of the San Francisco Giants, rejected a proposed bin Laden bobblehead giveaway promotion Thursday after an Internet poll indicated most people would find it distasteful.\n\nThe team had considered a promotion in which fans entering the ballpark would be given the dolls and then be invited to smash them.\n\nOf 194 responses, 72 percent considered the idea “way out of line,” according to the team’s Web site.\n\n“We’re really glad the fans got online and voted,” team general manager Kurt Landes said. He said the club’s staff came up with the idea.\n\nBobblehead manufacturer Alexander Global Promotions, of Bellevue, Wash., gets requests every week for bin Laden dolls, company chief executive Malcolm Alexander said.\n\n“The answer from us consistently has been no,” he said.\n\nIdaho elevates their potatoes\n\nBOISE, Idaho — At the prompting of fourth graders, Idaho’s famous potatoes are being elevated to the top of the vegetable heap.\n\nThe state Senate unanimously sent Gov. Dirk Kempthorne a bill that would designate the potato as Idaho’s official state vegetable.\n\nThe bill, passed Thursday, had already been approved by the House.\n\nFor decades, Idaho has led the nation in potato production, making spuds practically synonymous with the state. Most license plates are graced with the slogan “Famous Potatoes.”\n\nNow the potato joins other official state symbols like the mountain bluebird, cutthroat trout and Appaloosa horse.\n\nThe idea for the official vegetable came from fourth-grade classes studying Idaho history at Grand View Elementary School. The children wrote to 200 other fourth-grade classes around the state and to all 105 legislators for their support.\n\nGOP gubernatorial race coming down to wire\n\nLOS ANGELES — Richard Riordan lashed out at Bill Simon as a “sanctimonious hypocrite” Friday, harshly criticizing the former friend who has overtaken him with just days to go before the GOP gubernatorial primary.\n\n“Those are the words my mother taught me to say about people who carry religion on their lapel but go around telling untruths about other people,” added the moderate former Los Angeles mayor, whose maverick bid to broaden the Republican Party is flagging in the face of Simon’s traditional conservative campaign.\n\nAs recently as Sunday, Riordan laughed off a question about whether he remains friends with Simon, who attends Catholic church with him in Santa Monica and who Riordan encouraged to run for governor before getting in the race himself.\n\nSince then a Field Institute poll showed Simon overcoming a 33-point deficit to overtake Riordan 37-31 among likely voters in the March 5 GOP primary, and the campaigns have been relentlessly on the attack. Simon has slammed Riordan for consorting with Democrats and accused him of being soft on taxes, and Riordan has hit back by questioning Simon’s business practices and his failure to register as a Republican until 1992.\n\nRiordan put to rest Friday any doubts about his relationship with Simon.\n\n“He has the sanctimonious gall to say he’s a good friend of Dick Riordan’s — ’but I want to tell you what Dick Riordan’s all about’ — and then he starts lying about me,” Riordan told a Hollywood press conference. “This is not friendship. This is sanctimonious hypocrisy.”\n\nIn fact Riordan’s campaign was first in airing a negative attack ad.\n\nSimon strategist Jeff Flint said the multimillionaire investor still considers Riordan his friend, and that the two will probably continue to ski together since they own houses close to each other in Sun Valley, Idaho.\n\n“Bill Simon’s not going to address the increasingly false and desperate charges from Dick Riordan,” Flint said. “It’s clear he’s only lashing out because he’s fading in the polls.”\n\nIn another sign Riordan’s campaign is in trouble, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday that the White House has reached out, through intermediaries, to Simon.\n\nThe Times said a Washington lobbyist with ties to the White House approached Simon strategists this week to discuss an appearance with the president if Simon wins the primary.\n\nRiordan has said President Bush personally urged him to run, and he has long been seen as the candidate with the blessing of an administration eager to install a Republican governor in the nation’s most populous state. He said Friday that nothing has changed in his relationship with the White House.\n\n“The White House is reaching out to both of us. This is a close race. They will support whoever wins this nomination because we have to get rid of (Democratic incumbent) Gray Davis,” Riordan said.\n\nSimon confirmed contacts took place but declined to elaborate.\n\n“There have been contacts between our staffs, and the White House will work with whoever is the winner of this election,” Simon said.\n\nAsked how he felt about it, Simon said, “You have to say, wow.” But he added, “At the end of the day I tell all our guys and all our gals, you know, stay humble.”\n\nBay Area Briefs\n\nSex offender info to be made available in 13 languages\n\nSAN JOSE — Public information on registered sex offenders now will be available in 13 languages and will be updated daily, Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Friday.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies will be able to obtain and give daily updates of Megan’s Law information by accessing a Department of Justice databasa via a secure Intranet connection. The new Web-enabled application replaces a CD-ROM produced by the attorney general’s office and distributed monthly to law enforcement.\n\nIn addition to English the information will be available in Arabic, Armenian, Cambodian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Punjabi, Russian, Spanish, Tagalog and Vietnamese.\n\nSuspect in Oakland shooting connected to another homicide\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — A man critically wounded by San Francisco police is a suspect in the killings of seven people, including a witness shot six days after testifying in a gang homicide case, police said Thursday.\n\nRamon Sapp, 24, was shot at least six times Wednesday and was in critical condition Thursday night.\n\nSan Francisco police believe Sapp has ties to a drug gang in the city’s Western Addition neighborhood. Sapp is also a suspect in the January 2001 shooting death of Dustin Thomas.\n\nAlbany schools to layoff teachers to reduce $1.5m shortfall\n\nALBANY — The Albany Unified School District will lay off teachers and administrators, and reduce the number of class periods, to slash $1.5 million from its budget.\n\nSchool officials say an array of reasons — from a fluctuating enrollment during the past several years to overly optimistic salary settlements with various unions last year — have forced them to take these steps.\n\n“The way school districts work, you’re supposed to keep a 3 percent reserve,” said Albany school board member Marsha Skinner. “This year, we’re going down into our reserve, even with cuts we’ve already made.”\n\nBombing reported in Afghan mountains\n\nKABUL, Afghanistan — U.S. warplanes and helicopter gunships bombarded suspected al-Qaida hide-outs in Afghanistan’s eastern mountains Saturday, opening a new offensive against Taliban and al-Qaida believed regrouping there, Afghan officials said.\n\nOn the ground, about 600 Afghan and American forces moved into the same Shah-e-Kot mountains Saturday, said Safi Ullah, head of the local governing council, reached by telephone in Gardez, 20 miles north of the attack.\n\nIn neighboring Pakistan, authorities sealed off the border along the mountains to block any fleeing al-Qaida from escape.\n\nThe U.S. Central Command in Florida refused comment because the operation was ongoing.\n\nThere were no details of any ground fighting, although bombing was continuing into Saturday, Safi Ullah said. The majority of the ground forces were Afghan, Safi Ullah said.\n\nCommander Wazir Khan Zedran, talking to the Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press, was quoted as saying al-Qaida had opened fire with mortars from the mountains, even though they hadn’t yet come under ground attack.\n\nU.S. B-52 bombers have been out in force in recent days over Paktia province, site of the new reported offensive.\n\nAfghan officials say al-Qaida and Taliban fighters are regrouping there and just over the border in Pakistan, urging the faithful to wage holy war against U.S. forces.\n\nU.S. officials and Afghan sources estimate 4,000 to 5,000 foreigners who fought for the Taliban and al-Qaida remain inside Afghanistan. Many of them are believed to be in Paktia and other provinces along the Pakistan border.\n\nThey are receiving support from a variety of groups, including Kashmiri separatists, Islamic militants in Pakistan and some former officials of Pakistan’s intelligence service, according to Afghan sources.\n\nIn Pakistan, a senior government official at the Pakistan border town of Miran Shah said Saturday that troops have blocked all routes to prevent escape of any al-Qaida and Taliban fleeing the attack.\n\nThe official, Javed Marwat, said a 60-mile strip with Afghanistan has been closed.\n\nA tribal elder in the area, Haji Rasool Khan, said by telephone that his Madakhel tribe would not give shelter to any al-Qaida on the run.\n\nThe last major U.S. bombing in Afghanistan was in January, when airstrikes targeted regrouping Taliban and al-Qaida forces in the eastern Zawar region. In that strike, at least 18 civilians were confirmed dead before an aid group’s count was cut short by continued bombardment. Local officials have told The Associated Press that several dozen civilians had died, but no precise figures are available. At least 35 homes were destroyed.\n\nCuban youths evicted from Mexican Embassy\n\nHAVANA — Cuban police in black berets entered the Mexican embassy early Friday and detained 21 young men who had crashed a stolen bus through the gates two days earlier and asked to be taken out of Cuba.\n\nThe unarmed, specially trained police took action after Mexico asked Cuba to remove the men. The detainees, who authorities in both countries said were seized without putting up any resistance, were rushed away in trucks during the pre-dawn hours.\n\nWhile human rights activists expressed concerns about their fate, Mexican authorities said they believed the men had no grounds to fear political persecution and there was no risk to their lives. Mexico said the men did not ask for political asylum and wanted to emigrate for purely economic reasons.\n\n“These are young people facing a difficult economic situation, like many in Latin America,” said Gloria Abella of Mexico’s Foreign Relations Department.\n\nAfter commandeering a public bus, the men crashed the embassy gates late Wednesday night. Their forced evacuation about 30 hours later sent a strong message across the island: holing up in a diplomatic mission is not a sure ticket off the island.\n\nGuantanamo prisoners continue hunger strike for 3rd day\n\nGUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba — A hunger strike by prisoners at this remote U.S. naval base seemed to lose momentum after the U.S. military agreed to allow the Taliban and al-Qaeda captives to wear turbans, as long as guards could inspect them at any time.\n\nOf the 300 terror suspects detained at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, 75 refused to eat lunch on Friday, military officials said. That number was down significantly from the peak of the hunger strike Thursday, when 194 prisoners declined lunch.\n\nThe protest began Wednesday after guards removed a makeshift turban from a praying captive’s head. Military officials had previously banned turbans because they might be used to hide weapons.\n\nThe military says the prisoners are fighters of the international al-Qaida terrorist network, believed responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, and the deposed Afghan Taliban regime that harbored it. Some have been held at the base in southeastern Cuba since Jan. 11.\n\nDetainees told officials the hunger strike was in response to two guards stripping a detainee of his turban during prayers Tuesday after the inmate ignored orders to remove it, Marine Maj. Stephen Cox said. He added that detainees have been issued prayer caps or can drape towels over their heads.\n\nThe policy change on head coverings seemed to have little impact on those who continued their hunger strike Friday.\n\nTwo inmates were taken to the camp infirmary Friday and treated for dehydration through intravenous drips, officials said. One ate and was taken back to his cell. The other refused to eat and remained in the infirmary.\n\n“We’re certainly not going to allow them to harm themselves or starve,” said Marine Capt. Alan Crouch, a spokesman for the detention mission.\n\nEven those declining food appear to be drinking water, said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Jeff Carter, another spokesman.\n\nIn an address to prisoners Thursday night by Brig. Gen. Mike Lehnert, the Marine in charge of the detention mission, indicated there might be more to the hunger strike.\n\n“He told them at this point he could not tell them how long they will be here or what will happen to them in the future,” Cox said.\n\n“Gen. Lehnert also told the detainees that they will be judged fairly” when the time comes, Cox said.\n\nThe new policy “was explained to the detainees, and they’ve talked back and forth to the commanders and the chaplain several times ... and we are hoping it will ease the tension,” Air Force Brig. Gen. John Rosa, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staffs, said Friday at the Pentagon.\n\nFriday afternoon, Camp X-ray was quiet, with detainees passing the time as usual — pacing in their chain-link cells, sitting or lying down. A few were interrogated in wooden buildings near their cells. They are not allowed to have lawyers.\n\nTension has been building among the inmates, some of whom were held for months in Afghanistan before being brought to Guantanamo beginning seven weeks ago.\n\nIn recent days, some have ignored a taped call to prayer and instead have picked individual detainees to announce and lead prayers, which Muslims do five times a day.\n\nA week ago there was “a disturbance” when a guard doing a random search of a cell inadvertently dropped a copy of the Quran, officials said.\n\n“There is an underlying tension associated with the uncertainty of their future,” Cox said.\n\nU.S. officials say they are determining the legal fates of the detainees. Those not tried by a military tribunal either would be prosecuted in a U.S. court, returned to their home countries for prosecution, released outright or held indefinitely.\n\nSome of Washington’s closest allies have criticized President Bush’s proposal to try some detainees before secret military tribunals empowered with the death penalty.\n\nThe detainees come from 32 countries, several of which have asked that their nationals be returned home to face trial.\n\n“In some instances, and I won’t pick out a country, it is indeed likely that some of those detainees may go back to those countries,” Victoria Clarke, spokeswoman for Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, said at the Pentagon Friday.\n\nAmnesty International said the protest “highlights the dangers of the legal limbo into which the prisoners have been thrown” and underscores the “urgent need” for the United States to allow the prisoners due process, including the right to challenge their detentions.\n\nReligious strife causes bloodshed in India\n\nAHMADABAD, India — Hindu attackers stalked Muslims in the streets and set fire to their homes and shops Friday, pushing the death toll in India’s worst religious violence in a decade past 300.\n\nOfficials said Saturday that a Hindu mob torched the Muslim village of Sardarpura late Friday, killing at least 27 people trapped inside their homes. The killings took the death toll in three days of carnage to 322.\n\nPress Trust of India news agency said police fired bullets in the air to scare away the mob, which regrouped as soon as the police patrol left. The mob set houses and shops on fire using cooking gas bottles, police said.\n\nThe bloodshed has been largely confined to the western state of Gujarat, and has not spread across this vast nation despite a call for a general strike by Hindu nationalists.\n\nSome 900 soldiers deployed in Ahmadabad, a city of 3.5 million, where young Hindu men brandished swords and sticks Friday in a second day of looting and attacks triggered by a fiery assault on a train by Muslims.\n\nMichael Moore makes a big stink – on purpose\n\nYou have to hand it to Michael Moore for bravery. At a time in which dissent has been sent to the back of the bus, Moore is insisting on his front-row seat.\n\nStupid White Men and Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation! (Regan Books, $24.95), a deliciously wicked read for those who like to see the comfortable hung, drawn and quartered, is the latest book by the blue-collar big mouth whose best known work is the documentary Roger & Me. With characteristic relish, Stupid White Men takes aim at “Thief-in-Chief” George W. Bush, fat-cat executives, general American ignorance, self-satisfied whites and Democrats who might as well be Republicans.\n\nBerkeley fans will get a chance to see Moore on Mar. 6 when he will be appearing at the First Congregational Church of Berkeley at 7:30 PM. Moore told the Planet he is looking forward to coming back to Berkeley, a place he admires for its “rich history of dissent and of politics and of ideas, though it’s not the place it used to be.”\n\n“I like Berkeley,” said Moore. “It reminds me of a city back home – Ann Arbor.”\n\nMoore’s book Stupid White Men is full of the same wisecracks. Social commentary is served up with the same funny-yet-disturbing “What Gives?” humor we have come to love in Moore’s work. In a prayer to “Lord (God/Yahweh/Buddha/Bob/Nobody),” for example, he writes, “We beseech You to make the children of every senator in the Mountain Time Zone gay–really gay.”\n\nStupid White Men’s humor is even more biting because Moore has done his homework. When Moore writes, “Never, ever let someone fly you up in the air who’s making less than the kid at Taco Bell,” he knows what he is talking about. His research confirmed that commuter plane pilots’ starting pay can be as low as $13,000, which comes to about $9,000 after pilots pay for their own flight training and uniforms.\n\nMoore, who was writing the book last spring, also pointed the finger at Enron long before Kenneth Lay was publically outed. His book slams the energy company for running a big scam – and taking advantage of California in particular.\n\n“Look, Bush and Kenny Boy have a map of the state of California for target practice,” Moore told the Planet. “It’s the home state of Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, but they hate it. They wrote it off in the last election. They knew it was going to go to the Democrats.”\n\nMoore’s essay on race relations, “Kill Whitey” is not as sharp as other parts of his book, however. Moore rightly points out that white people need to take more responsibility for slavery, the programming on FOX and the invention of the punch card ballot. But the mea culpa strikes an almost self-righteous note in parts.\n\nHe also focuses mainly on blacks, to the exclusion of other minorities in today’s underclass, because, he writes, “African-Americans have been on the lowest rung of the economic ladder since the day they were beaten and dragged here in chains.” But recent scholarship has suggested that race and class do not map so neatly among color lines as they used to. In fact, by 1980, Harvard Professor William Julius Wilson had already written a landmark sociological study of urban blacks called The Declining Significance of Race.\n\nMoore’s most controversial chapter, though, is the “Dear George” letter in which Moore asks if the president if he is an illiterate, a drunkard and a felon. This sharp criticism almost prevented his book from being published at all.\n\nStupid White Men was due to be shipped on Sept. 11 for sale on Oct. 2 when hijacked planes slammed into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Moore and his publisher, Regan Books, an imprint of Harper Collins, both felt it was best to hold the book.\n\nBut when his book had not been published by Dec. 2, Moore said he was wondering, “Where’s my book?” Turns out, Regan Books wanted Moore to rewrite up to 50 percent of his book because it was too harsh on the president.\n\n“I said, ‘I’m not rewriting 50 percent of one word. I feel the same way now as I did then. If you want me to rewrite it, I’ll just make it harsher,’” said Moore.\n\nLuckily some librarians from New Jersey came to his aid when they heard him speak at a private event. They organized an internet campaign, posting on list-serves and barraging the publishers with e-mail complaints. When trade magazines and the New York Post picked up the story, the publishers relented.\n\nMoore said he is very pleased that the book has been published without a single irreverent word of it altered, though he will be soon posting an additional chapter called “The Sad and Sordid Whereabouts of bin Cheney and bin Bush” on his website (www.michaelmoore.com). “People were nervous. That’s why I was afraid to put my book out,” explained Moore. “But it’s not good in a democracy to be afraid of dissent,” he added.\n\n“My biggest motivation for writing the book was to get people fired up and tell them not to give up.”\n\nWoman accused of killing son pleads guilty in court\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nREDWOOD CITY — A judge suspended criminal proceedings in the case of a Minnesota obstetrician accused of killing her 13-year-old son after the woman blurted out in court Friday that she wanted to represent herself and plead guilty to charges she stabbed the boy to death.\n\nDonna Anderson, 48, made the statements at the beginning of a hearing in the courtroom of San Mateo County Superior Court Judge Stephen Hall. The judge did not accept entry of Anderson’s guilty pleas and instead ordered another hearing to appoint two doctors to examine the woman to assess her mental status.\n\nAnderson had previously claimed a child pornography ring may be funding her defense against her will and is not allowing her access to a fair trial.\n\nDuring an interview Thursday with two San Francisco Bay area media outlets, Donna Anderson recited a rambling list of names, her work history and vague allegations. She refused to answer any questions and did not mention her son’s name in the prepared statement she read.\n\nProsecutor Steve Wagstaffe said the woman’s statement’s Friday brought a quick end to the proceedings which were to resume Tuesday. Anderson was seeking attention for her case, Wagstaffe said.\n\n“Two days ago she was blaming some pornography ring for everything that’s happened and today she’s pleading guilty to two counts,” Wagstaffe said.\n\nAnderson is being held in the San Mateo County jail’s medical wing on charges she stabbed her son, Stephen Burns, to death.\n\nCounties unsatisfied with use of settlement money\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nPHILADELPHIA — The 1998 national tobacco settlement was supposed to end government-sponsored litigation against Big Tobacco. But some local officials, unhappy with the way states are spending the settlement money, are looking to the courts for help.\n\nAt least two counties — one in Pennsylvania and another in Michigan — are pursuing lawsuits against the tobacco giants, arguing that they haven’t received their fair share of the $206 billion settlement.\n\n“Most of the money was supposed to go to help people. And now we’re building bridges with it,” said Larry Levin, an attorney representing Carbon County, Pa., in a suit against the tobacco industry.\n\nLevin’s firm is trying to organize a class-action lawsuit of Pennsylvania counties. So far, only Carbon County has signed on.\n\nThe rural county in eastern Pennsylvania says it is entitled to millions of dollars from the state’s share of the tobacco settlement to treat sick smokers. The county has been promised $136,000 per year for anti-smoking programs.\n\nThe dispute has led to an unusual alliance between the tobacco industry and the state of Pennsylvania, which plans to withhold Carbon County’s share of the settlement if it goes ahead with litigation.\n\n“The tobacco companies have paid to settle these claims,” said Sean Connolly, spokesman for state Attorney General Mike Fisher. “It would be unfair to have them pay over and over and over.”\n\nUnder the terms of the national settlement, eight major tobacco companies agreed to pay 46 states for smoking-related health costs. Most states have used at least some of the money for programs unrelated to smoking and for closing budget gaps, leaving anti-smoking forces up in arms.\n\nA report released last month by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids said that only five states are funding anti-smoking programs at the level recommended by the federal government. In Pennsylvania, lawmakers have earmarked just under $30 million per year for anti-smoking programs, out of an initial settlement share of $927 million.\n\n“The problem the counties are raising is indicative of what’s happening around the country,” said William V. Corr, executive vice president of the campaign. “People who want to address the tobacco toll aren’t getting substantial resources.”\n\nIn the Detroit area, Wayne County, Mich., has been pursuing a lawsuit against the tobacco industry for the past three years. The suit hit a stumbling block last month, when the Michigan Supreme Court said the county was bound by the national settlement and not permitted to sue. But a federal judge has asked the high court to revisit the case.\n\nThe national settlement insulated the tobacco industry from lawsuits by counties, cities and other political subdivisions. The settlement says that if a local government wins a judgment, the money will be deducted from the state’s share.\n\nWorried about that possibility, the Pennsylvania General Assembly last summer passed a law that punishes any local government that pursues legal action against tobacco companies. A county or city filing such a suit would not get any money from the tobacco settlement. Private hospitals, social service agencies and other groups entitled to tobacco money would also be penalized.\n\n“The General Assembly will not allow counties to double-dip,” Connolly said. “They can’t have it both ways, suing on their own behalf and still benefitting from the state’s settlement.”\n\nThe law came into play last year when Lackawanna County in northeastern Pennsylvania sued seven major tobacco companies and two Pennsylvania cigarette distributors. The county claimed it was entitled to reimbursement for the cost of treating sick smokers at the county-run nursing home and prison.\n\nThe county withdrew its lawsuit in October, a few months after the Legislature acted.\n\n“The state government just put the squeeze on the counties and forced local governments out of participation in lawsuits,” Lackawanna County Solicitor Joseph O’Brien said. “The state people wanted the ability to decide where the money went rather than let local government do it.”\n\nBill Godshall, executive director of SmokeFree Pennsylvania, said anti-smoking forces sued three years ago to prevent the attorney general from signing the national settlement agreement in the first place. But the lawsuit was tossed out and subsequent appeals failed.\n\n“I don’t think (Carbon County’s) lawsuit has one chance of success,” Godshall said. “That train left the station three years ago.”\n\nUkrainian immigrant accused of killing family died by hanging\n\nSACRAMENTO — An autopsy has confirmed a Ukrainian immigrant accused of killing six family members died by hanging in his jail cell, officials said Friday.\n\nSacramento County coroner Paul Smith said he expects a formal ruling that Nikolay Soltys committed suicide Feb. 13, but other details are pending the release of toxicology reports in about a week.\n\nThe death is being investigated by the sheriff’s department that oversees the Sacramento County Jail and by the district attorney’s office that had been expected to prosecute Soltys.\n\nSoltys’ attorney, Tommy Clinkenbeard, has asked for an outside investigation by the attorney general’s office into whether jailers were negligent by not preventing his client’s death.\n\nSheriff’s officials have denied any lapse in vigilance.\n\nHard times send shopper to bargain bins, second-hand retail\n\nAt the Crossroads Trading Company, Nika Thomas fingers a pair of black leather boots and explains her recent job lay-off. Until last fall, she worked at IKON, an office-supply shop. Then the economy went south, and she was let go. She gave up her frequent shopping haunts.\n\n“I shop less now at stores like Macy’s and Nordstroms,” said Thomas, 23. She settles on the boots, a mid-length skirt and heads to the register. The total is $18. “Now I shop at consignment shops, second-hand stores; that sort of thing,” she said.\n\nShe wasn’t the only fiscal conservative at Crossroads. The store trades in new and used clothing on College Avenue in Berkeley. It also buys old clothing for resale and sells a few items on consignment.\n\n“People come in and say, ‘I’ve just lost my job!’ said Crossroads manager Kristofer Velasquez. “But they’re still shopping.”\n\nWhile the recession has slowed business at most retail shops, Velasquez said that his business has been steady, if not improved. Customers said that Crossroads and other second-hand stores are reasonable compromises between expensive boutiques and lower-end thrift-stores.\n\n“People can still take care of their shopping addiction,” said Velasquez, “but not spend as much.”\n\nAbout half the shoppers on a recent Tuesday said they’d been laid off at some point. A few have been re-hired. All said they were worried about the sluggish economy.\n\n“My friends are scaling down,” said Matt Russell, as he browsed men’s jeans. “People are worried about the basics – paying bills, getting groceries.”\n\nCalifornia’s unemployment rate of 6.2 percent now tops the 5.6 percent national rate, and San Francisco’s unemployment is a record 7 percent, according to recent figures released by the state’s Employment Development Department. And a break from the recession, at least for California, is not in sight.\n\nSo even at second-hand stores shoppers want bargains.\n\n“People are not buying as much expensive stuff,” said Emily Gautier, a Crossroads clerk, “it’s more the ten-dollar-and-under pile.” While the occasional Gucci hits the rack, prices rarely top $60 dollars, and most clothing at Crossroads is casual. Some is even a steal. The price for a pair of brown-velvet Gap-pants: nine dollars.\n\nIt’s prices like these that drew Dianne Mighetto into the store on Tuesday. She had a baby last month and is searching for non-maternity blue-jeans. Her little girl gives her cause to celebrate, she said, but not to splurge. She has not lost work because of the recession, but it has worried her. Since it began, she said, “everything has changed.”\n\n“I am on a total budget,” she said, her arm cradling ten pairs of jeans. “I’m looking for one pair. These jeans are half-off, so that’s like $12.” Like many shoppers at Crossroads, she wants to find a bargain, but not look like she’s wearing one. The store sells used clothing that is “pleasing,” according to a flyer that outlines the store’s guidelines. It stipulates that it will only buy clothing that is “clean, without spots, holes or odors.” The store’s meticulousness sells.\n\n“It’s nice to cut corners and still get nice things,” said Mighetto. “That’s why I come here.”\n\nOthers come hoping to off-load a bag of old clothes. They are recently unemployed and panicked, says Velasquez, and hope to make enough to “pay the rent.”\n\nCrossroads pays sellers 40 percent of the item’s selling price in the store. One woman left the shop on Tuesday with $30 dollars cash for two pair of pants, a suede top and a jean jacket. It’s a handy sum, but probably won’t cover a week’s groceries, never mind a month’s rent.\n\nBut then, it all depends on the scale you work with. “There were a few people who worked at Levi’s and had thousands of dollars of free samples and clothing they’d bought with discounts,” said Velasquez. “Then they were laid off. So they brought them down here and sold them to us.”\n\nFamilies of farm workers killed in crash to receive compensation\n\nFRESNO — The families of 13 tomato pickers killed on their way home from work and two survivors are eligible for more than $2 million after a judge ruled that their commute was covered under workers’ compensation.\n\nIn a decision made public Friday by the Worker Compensation Appeals Board, a judge ruled that the farmworkers were exceptions to a “going and coming” rule that prevents commuters from collecting workers’ comp benefits.\n\nGreen Valley Ag, a farm labor contractor, and Terra Linda Farms were found liable to pay workers’ comp claims and death benefits to the victims of the Aug. 9, 1999 crash in Five Points, west of Fresno.\n\n“It’s been something that I’ve been waiting for,” said crash survivor Lucila Gonzalez, 23, who had several surgeries to repair her liver. “I cried a lot. They had to take me to the bathroom and shower me. I couldn’t move for three months.”\n\nThe workers were headed home in the early morning when their van slammed into a big-rig truck that was making an illegal turn, killing all but two of the tomato pickers.\n\nThe crash spurred reform of farm worker transportation vehicles, requiring seats and seat belts in vans.\n\nJudge Stephen Webster said the survivors could collect workers’ comp because they were required to use the labor contractor for transportation and both the labor contractor and the grower benefited from the transportation they were provided.\n\nEach family will be entitled to $200,000 in death benefits, said Robert Perez, the farmworkers’ attorney. The companies will also pay past medical bills and medical benefits for life. Gonzalez’ bills totaled $1.1 million.\n\nJavier Alabart, a lawyer for Green Valley Ag and its insurance company, said it was not immediately clear if his clients would appeal.\n\nHe said the case was difficult because the law is slanted in favor of the workers and because the facts were so horrible.\n\n“It’s a heart wrenching case because you have relatively young people, hard working individuals working for minimum wage, with families here or in Mexico and they’re dead,” Alabart said. “There’s not much you can do about that.”\n\nAlabart emphasized that the Workers Compensation Appeals Board is a no-fault system and the judge did not blame the contractor or the farm. However in a final comment, the judge made a scathing remark about conditions for farmworkers.\n\n“We, as a society, should be ashamed to allow our fellow human beings to be treated in this disgraceful and obscene manner,” Webster said.\n\nInsurance commissioner candidates paying big bucks for mudslinging ads\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — As they head toward Tuesday’s primary, the three major Democratic candidates for insurance commissioner are running TV ads that are triggering more sniping in one of the fiercely contested statewide races.\n\nIn an ad for Assemblyman Tom Calderon that began running widely earlier this week, a woman speaking in sign language, “I’m sick of waiting for someone to take on the HMOs, so I’m voting for Tom Calderon.”\n\nThe ad is misleading, according to Calderon’s opponents and consumer critics, because the insurance commissioner has little jurisdiction over the state’s major health maintenance organizations, or HMOs. The state Department of Managed Health Care, created in July 2000, is the HMO industry’s primary regulator.\n\n“It’s a tremendously deceptive claim,” said consumer activist Jamie Court, who has worked on several HMO reform bills in the Assembly.\n\nIf he is elected, Calderon intends to push for changes that will give the insurance commissioner more power over billing disputes involving HMOs, said his spokeswoman Valerie Martinez. “It’s an issue important to California and an issue that hasn’t been addressed,” she said.\n\nThe Department of Managed Health Care doesn’t agree with Calderon. “The governor created this department to protect patients’ rights and any retreat from that would be bad news for consumers,” said Daniel Zingale, the department’s director.\n\nThe ads of Calderon’s chief opponents, former Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi and former Assemblyman Tom Umberg, are also drawing criticism.\n\nJudge sets Dec. 2003 trial date for Enron lawsuits\n\nJudge expects cases to be settled as lawyers start gathering millions of documents\n\nHOUSTON – Multibillion-dollar lawsuits against Enron Corp. officials and the company’s former auditor, Arthur Andersen LLC, will go to trial in December 2003, a federal judge has ruled.\n\nU.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon in Houston told lawyers before filing the trial schedule that she expects the cases to be settled. But they have 18 months to gather millions of documents and prepare their cases if they take their claims to trial.\n\n“It’s something real now,” said Rod Jordan, 63, a member of the Severed Enron Employees Coalition. Jordan was among 4,500 workers abruptly laid off in December after Enron filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history.\n\nHe also is among hundreds of former workers, retirees and investors who filed lawsuits over millions of dollars in investments or 401(k) accounts that evaporated when Enron’s once-enviable stock price plummeted to less than a dollar.\n\n“Without a date, it was something that maybe would go to trial someday, maybe it won’t,” Jordan said Friday.\n\nHarmon said in the order filed late Thursday the cases have generated national attention given allegations of accounting abuses and Andersen’s role as Enron’s former outside auditor. She said she hoped an efficient resolution of the cases would change “the nation’s impression that the justice system grinds slowly in a Dickensian fashion.”\n\nHarmon also ordered Enron to provide plaintiffs with all documents the company has given Congress and the Labor Department, both of which are investigating the collapse. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department also are investigating.\n\n“We’ll continue to cooperate with all investigations and inquiries,” Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said Friday.\n\nHarmon’s order addresses class-action lawsuits against current and former Enron officials and Chicago-based Andersen.\n\nPlaintiffs in the consolidated case are large investors, like the University of California regents, the lead plaintiff. They also include several state pension funds, Amalgamated Bank and some individual investors.\n\nPlaintiffs in the other actions are Enron employees and retirees. Those cases will be consolidated April 1.\n\n“The order sends a strong message that the judge wants to move quickly,” University of California spokesman Trey Davis said Friday.\n\nThe plaintiffs are seeking more than $25 billion from Enron officials, including former chief executives Kenneth Lay and Jeff Skilling, and the auditing firm.\n\nDavis declined to say whether Arthur Andersen has offered a reported $750 million to settle claims with creditors, investors and employees. But other lawyers involved with the cases said Andersen had claimed that anything more would put the firm out of business.\n\nAndersen spokesman Patrick Dorton declined comment Friday beyond an earlier statement that “we think it is in the best interests of all parties to deal expeditiously and responsibly with what has occurred.”\n\nRandy McClanahan, one of the lawyers representing employees, called the reported offer “a good start,” but that he doubted it would be anywhere close to what plaintiffs eventually will demand.\n\nAnthony Sabino, a professor at St. John’s University and an expert in bankruptcy, oil and gas law, said Andersen’s efforts to settle the claims quickly show the firm wants to leave Enron behind and focus on its other clients.\n\n“Clearly this is damage control in the extreme,” Sabino said. “Right now, job one is to retain the very significant client base they have.”\n\nBLM withdraws backing of proposed cat litter mine\n\nRENO, Nev. – The Bureau of Land Management formally withdrew its approval of a proposed cat litter mine on BLM land north of Reno Friday, but said the Oil-Dri Corp. could submit a revised plan.\n\nBLM officials said they were forced the withdraw their earlier record of decision because the project no longer is feasible after Washoe County rejected a special use permit this week for an accompanying processing plant on neighboring private land.\n\nOil-Dri Corp. officials expected the move and already are making plans to submit a new proposal. John Singlaub, manager of the BLM’s district field office in Carson City, said the revised plan will require a supplemental environmental impact statement as well.\n\nUnder the revised plan, the largest maker of cat litter in the world still would mine the clay in two open pits across about 300 acres of BLM land but likely would site the processing plant on federal land as well.\n\nAnother option is to ship the raw clay material elsewhere for processing, company officials say.\n\nThe Washoe County Board of Commissioners rejected the special use permit on a 3-2 vote late Tuesday night despite Oil-Dri’s claims that the county has no authority to block access to the company’s mineral rights on federal land under the General Mining Law of 1872.\n\n“One way or another, we’re going to mine, whether we have to go to district court or ship the clay out or whatever,” Oil-Dri Vice President Bob Vetere said after the vote.\n\nOpponents said the project could cause water shortages and would pollute the air and water, clog residential streets with truck traffic and ruin the rustic qualities of the Hungry Valley area, just 10 miles north of downtown Reno.\n\n“I really think this could end up being some kind of defining case on the 1872 mining law,” said Tom Myers, a hydrologist and executive director of the Great Basin Mine Watch who has been involved in numerous appeals challenging mining projects in Nevada.\n\nCommissioners Jim Shaw and Jim Galloway joined Chairman Pete Sferrazza in opposing the project, and Commissioners Joanne Bond and Ted Short supported Oil-Dri’s bid. Bond and Short said they fear Tuesday’s vote will mean the county will lose jurisdiction over the project if it is built on federal land.\n\nOil-Dri officials say their project would produce about 100 jobs and generate $12 million annually for the local economy. The project is the result of a search started 20 years ago for a new source of raw material for West Coast customers who sell Oil-Dri cat litter under several brand names.\n\n“We’re businessmen,” Vetere told the commission Tuesday night. “We’re being told by our customers, the Chloroxes and the Wal-Marts of the world that they want this clay and they want it quick.”\n\nAndersen to pay $217 million to settle Baptist Foundation suits\n\nEmbattled accounting firm settles Arizona cases without admitting wrongdoing\n\nPHOENIX – Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm battling fallout from the collapse of Enron Corp., agreed Friday to pay $217 million to settle three lawsuits stemming from the 1999 collapse of the Baptist Foundation of Arizona, an investment group.\n\nThe foundation’s failure, the largest nonprofit bankruptcy in U.S. history, left 13,000 mostly elderly investors out $590 million.\n\nThe settlement resolves a case brought by a bankruptcy trust for foundation investors that was suing Andersen in Maricopa County Superior Court for $155 million in compensatory damages.\n\nIt also resolves a class-action against Andersen by former BFA investors, a civil action brought by the Arizona Corporation Commission, a state regulatory agency, and disciplinary proceedings brought against Andersen and some of its employees by the Arizona Board of Accountancy.\n\nThe foundation was created in 1948 as a nonprofit religious entity to raise money for Southern Baptist causes.\n\n“These investors, many of whom are elderly, trusted the misleading financial statements audited by Andersen,” said Arizona Attorney General Janet Napolitano. “This agreement will allow Baptist Foundation victims to at least recover most of their investment.”\n\nA statement from Arthur Andersen said the firm made a business decision to settle the cases without admitting wrongdoing.\n\n“This settlement is an important step in building confidence in our firm,” the company’s statement said.\n\nThe state’s lawsuit alleged that Andersen prepared financial statements that concealed huge losses that should have been red-flagged to alert investors.\n\nWarnings of potential trouble were ignored or inadequately investigated, allowing senior managers of the foundation to mislead the board of directors and to engage in fraud at the expense of investors, the suit said.\n\nLawsuits against Andersen in the Enron case make similar allegations.\n\neBay snafu has customers asking where their miniature mice are\n\nDealer di"
