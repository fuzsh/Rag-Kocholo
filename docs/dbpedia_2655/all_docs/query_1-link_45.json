        "text": "A total of 186 roles, 89 of which are currently vacant, would be disestablished by the ministry. A further 59 new roles would be established, resulting in a net reduction of 127 roles - almost exclusively involving staff carrying out national office functions.\n\nThe new structure would come into effect on October 1.\n\nThe ministry initially proposed 178 job cuts at the beginning of June, 67 of which were vacant at the time. A further 55 roles were proposed to be created.\n\n“I want to acknowledge how difficult and unsettling it has been for our kaimahi [employees], especially those who have been impacted by the change proposal and today’s final decisions. Throughout, they have behaved with professionalism and a commitment to our RISE values of respect, integrity, service and excellence - and I want to thank them for that,” Kibblewhite said in the statement this afternoon.\n\nHe added that the ministry had received more than 1400 pieces of feedback from staff on the original proposal.\n\n“As I said at the start of our change proposal process, the key factor in our decision-making has been the need to deliver on our core functions and strategy and continue our work to strengthen people’s trust in the law of Aotearoa New Zealand,” Kibblewhite said.\n\n“In finalising these proposals, we looked closely at where we might be able to make savings, reduce duplication or overlap in functions, and be more efficient.”\n\nThe ministry said the announcement was the latest in a series of measures it has initiated to identify efficiencies and ensure its long-term fiscal sustainability.\n\n“[This includes] significantly reducing the use of contractors and consultants, and actively identifying savings in non-personnel areas by reducing travel, printing, Sim cards and other operational costs.”\n\nThe ministry said it would now begin the appointment of people into the 59 new roles, with the new structure coming into effect at the beginning of October.\n\nJustice Minister Paul Goldsmith said; “These are operational decisions for the ministry to speak to”.\n\n‘Dangerous’: Public sector union responds to latest cuts\n\nPublic sector union, the Public Service Association (PSA), was unsurprisingly critical of the announcement, calling the cuts “dangerous”.\n\n“The wheels of justice will now turn slower with the loss of these critical workers,” PSA assistant secretary Fleur Fitzsimons said.\n\n“The Government claims to have made law and order a top priority, promising more police, expanding prisons, bringing back the three strikes law and demanding longer jail sentences. These cuts make a mockery of these promises.\n\n“We should be investing more not less in the Ministry of Justice, as these cuts do. These cuts mean a less effective justice system and the loss of talented public servants.\n\n“The cuts will slow decision-making, and bottlenecks will grow as teams consolidate and managers become responsible for more and more.\n\n“These cuts are dangerous.”"
