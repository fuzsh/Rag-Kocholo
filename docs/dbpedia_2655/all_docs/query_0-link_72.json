ANNEX TO TBE MINUTES\n\nANNEXE AUX PROCÈS-VERBAUX\n\n1. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIR LIONEL HEALD\n\n(COUNSEL FOR THE COVERWMENT OF THE UNITED KINCDOM)\n\nAT THE PUBLIC SITTINGS OF SEPTEMBER 17th AND 18th, 1953\n\nhlr. Presidentand Members of the Court :\n\nIn presenting to you the case of Her Majesty's-Government upon the\n\nquestion of the title to the Minquiers and the Ecréhous, 1 would like\n\nfirstto Say how much 1 appreciate the privilege of appeanng again\n\nbefore the International Court of Justice.\n\n1 need hardly tell yau, Mr. President, that the present case differs\n\ngreatly from that in which 1had the honour of addressing you last year,\n\nboth in subject-matter and in atmosphere-that was the Iranian case.\n\nTo-day Great Britain and France come before you am-in-am, as it\n\nwere, asking you to resolve our disputeWe are here, in factnot in any\n\nspirit of bittemess or hostility, but as friends and good neighbours, both\n\nof us declared supporters of the pnnciple of the international adjudica-\n\ntion of disputes.\n\nBefore the case is over, I have no doubt that some shrewd blows will\n\nhave been exchanged between the represcntative advocates, but the\n\nCourt will not need tobe assured that these will betaken in good part\n\non both sides, and that, whatever your decision may be, it will be\n\nloyaily accepted, and wil1not disturb the present excelIent relations\n\nbetween Our two Governments.\n\nas this, ifange, Rlr.President, from the old days, when sucha dispute\n\nthe spot and decided by force of arms, leading perhaps to a serious con-\n\nflict. To-day a question of national sovereignty is by mutual consent the\n\nsubject of fair legal argument and thereafter of mature adjudicatioby\n\nerninent jurists, as the result of the Special Agreement to which you\n\nhave referred, dated 29th December 1950. Progress may be slowtowards\n\nthe attainment of the noble ideal which inspired the building of this\n\nplace ;but the present reference must surely be acknowledged, even by\n\nthe cynics, not only as a tribute to the Court itself but also as a practical\n\ncontribution of lasting value to the cause of peace.\n\nApart from the symbolic aspect of the matter, to which 1have already .\n\nreferred, 1feeljustified in asking the Court to regard thiç as an important\n\ncase upon its own merits. Itiçtrue that the actuaI area of land in issue\n\nis not very great. But, as youwiH hear later, the population of Jersey\n\nattaches the deepest moral significance to the result of this case which,\n\nif the French claim were to succeed, would mean the loss of something\n\nmuch more preciousthan a mere group of islets-something which has\n\ncome to be regarded by Jersey men and women with pride and affection\n\nas an integral part of their island heritage.\n\nMr. President, no advocate with any knowledge of the work of this\n\nCourt could fail to recognize with real gratitude the care andimpartiality\n\nwith which its members study the written proceedings inadvance of the 20 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIR L. HEALD (u.K.)-17 IX 53\n\noral hearing. I shall not therefore occupy your time with detailed refer-\n\nences to the pleadings, but, in view of the volume and complexity ivhich\n\nthey have inevitably assumed, 1 feel that it may be helpful tothe Court\n\nif 1 make a general opening statement, summarizing the main points\n\nwbich seem to us to arise from the documents, togethe rrith a brief'\n\nindication of how we propose to deal with them. 1 use the word \"indi-\n\ncation\" deliberately, because 1 do not myself feel qualified, in this com-\n\npany, ta discuss in detail many of the highly technical points that are\n\nin dispute. For that purpose 1 have armed myself with the assistance of'\n\na team of experts, who are-1 have no doubt-well matched by those\n\naccompnnyingmy Iearned frjend Professor Gros-not that 1suggest that\n\nheis nearly as much in need of expert assistance as 1 am. I will mention\n\nwho my assistants are, and what they propose to deal ivith, in a few\n\nmoments ; but Grst may 1 inform the Court of the presence at rny side\n\nof my very good friend and learned colleague, Rlr.Cecil Harrison, who\n\nis Her Majesty's Attorney-General for the island of Jersey, and himself'\n\na Jerseyman. Apart from the practical value of Iiis collaboration, the\n\nnature and history of his officeand the special and distinctive robe which\n\nhe wears are in themselves significant. For they emphasize, as he him-\n\nself cm explain to you much better than 1,that, although this case is.\n\nbrought before you by Her hlajesty's Govemment in the United King-\n\ndom, of which I have the honour to be a member, it is one particular-\n\npart of Her Majesty's dominions that is directly affected-a small part\n\nperhaps, but one which is nevertheless largely self-governing. For Jersey\n\n. enjoys almost compIete autonomy, and it is from Jersey and not from\n\nLondon that administrative control has long been exercised over the\n\nvery islets whose title is in issue,s proof of this,and of the reality of.\n\nJersey's independent status, I would like to refer you to the language of'\n\nthe officiaidocument which testified Jersey's agreement to the submis-\n\nsion of the present dispute io the International Court :it was a Resolu-.\n\ntian of the States of Jcrsey on the 14th September of the year 1948,and\n\nit stated that the States, in the name of the Government of Jersey, had\n\ntaken into consideration a Resolution adopted at a joint meeting of'\n\ncertain Committees, and it stated this, that :\n\n\"The Cornmittees of Finance and of Harbours and Airport have.\n\nthe honour to inform the States that His Majesty's Government,.\n\nfollowing consultation with the Lieutenant Governor, the Bailiff,\n\nthe Law Officersof the Crown and the Cornmittees concerned, has.\n\nsought, by negotiations through diplomatic channels, to obtain Jrom\n\nthe French Government an unequivocal acknowledgement of His.\n\nMajesty's ~overeignty over the Minquiers and Ecréhous Islands.\n\nThe Committees regret to inform the States that these negotia-\n\ntions have not been productive of the results hoped for.\n\nUnder these circumstances, His Majesty's Govemment recom-.\n\nmends that the question of sovereignty should be referred to the.\n\nInternational Court of Justice.\n\nThe Committees are in agreement with this recommendation.\n\nand ask the concurrence of the States therein.\n\nThe States unanimously concurred in the recommendation of'\n\nWis Majesty's Government and requested their President to take:\n\nthe necessary action in the matter.\"\n\nSigned by the Greffier des États. ORAL ARGUM OFESNR T.HE~D (u.K.)-17 IX 53 21\n\nhlr. President, one can see at once from that document that the real\n\nand the United Kingdom, as between France and Jersey, who çeeksFrance\n\nto retain certain adjacent islets, which, as the evidencewillreally\n\nshow, the inhabitants of Jersey have for many generations thought\n\nof and dealt with as part of themselves.\n\nIn view of theattitude taken upby Ouropponents in certain portions\n\nof their pleadings,1 have felt it essential to leave no doubt on this.\n\npoint. 1 can testify from my own persona1 experience to the intensity\n\nof the local feeling. 1 have twice visited Jersey since I was last here,\n\nin order to qualify myself to present their case, and in particular to\n\nensure that 1 should correctly interpret the views of the population.\n\nIn September of Iast year 1 was fortunate in being able to sail round\n\nthe Minquiers and the Écrbhous in perfect weather and to land on\n\nboth those groups. I only wish the mernbers of the Court had been\n\nable to go there also, not only to enjoy the beautifuI sunshine anda\n\nscenery but alço because an actual view of the locus in quo iç al~vays\n\nof such assistance, provided always of course that one is a good sailor.\n\nLast week 1 was in Jersey again, and on this occasion 1 had the great\n\nadvantage and interesting experience of Qing over the whole of this\n\narea and thus obtaining an intimate picture-more intimate perhaps\n\nof hearingatheviews of Jersey menhaand women in al1 walks of life on\n\nthis subject, and 1 can assure you that they regard this matter before\n\nthe Court with great seriousness and real emotion. They do not profess\n\nto understand the legal refinements of the pleadings: they look on\n\nthe matter in a very simple way-which may perhaps appear to the\n\nCourt as fundarnentally sound. They base themselves in the first\n\ninstance on the traditions handed down to them by their fathers and\n\ngrandfathers, according to which these islets have been for al1practical\n\npurposes part of Jersey for hundreds ofyears past. They aIso rely\n\nstrongly on the fact that the Channel Islands themselves are unquestion-\n\nably, and have been for nearly a thousand years, possessions of the\n\nBritish Crown. How, in these circumstances, Jersey men and women\n\nask, can it beseriously suggested that the Minquiers and the Écréhous\n\nbelong to France ?\n\nIn connection with this point of view of the Jerseyman, the Court\n\nhas no doubt exarnined with intereçt the French argument, and it may\n\nhave occurred to you that thiproves fatoo much. For you wili remem-\n\nber that the French argument relies very strongIy on such allegations as\n\nthat King Henry III of England did homage to the French King in the\n\nwere any validity in that argument, it would follow that the rest of the\n\nChannel Islands-Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney, Sark and al1the others-\n\nare al1French to-day. Indeed 1could not help wondenn as 1 read the\n\nFrench Rejoinder whether, when we arrived before this fourt, I rhould\n\nhear my learned fnend, Professor Gros, make an application to arnend\n\nhis pleadings so as to include a final daim to French sovereignty over\n\nthe whole of the Channel Islands,\n\nThismay be descnbed as a reductio ad absurdum,but if the French\n\nargument does not have this effect, what does it really amount to 7\n\nIt is no doubt a strange historical circumstance tfar,from there\n\nbeing any question of the British title to the Channel Islands being22 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIR L. HEALD (u.K.)-17 IX 53\n\nbased upon any British act of aggression, it resulted in fact from the\n\naggression which England suffered at the time of the Norman conquest\n\nbut the Court must remember that our opponents claim that the Dukeor-\n\nof Norrnandy was a French baron. The fact remains-and its importance\n\nfor present purposes is surely this-that, since one must accept asa\n\nlegal fait accomfilithe British title to the Channel Islands, there is no\n\nvalidity at al1in the comment which appears on page 687 of theFrench\n\nRejoinder (1quote) : \"The most sober-minded person may view with\n\nastonishment the fate of these islands, lying in a French bay, which have\n\nbecome English because a French baron, a Duke of Normandy, con-\n\nquered England in the year 1066.\" Indeed once it is conceded, asit\n\nmust be, that the British title to the Channel Islands has to be accepted\n\nby everyone-whether sober-minded or otherwise-the French case\n\nbecomes unarguable, unless,unless itcan be shown that the title to the\n\nMinquiers and the Écréhousis governed b some entirely different and\n\ndistinct consideration-a somewhat di cult proposition surely to\n\nestablish.\n\nJerseymen contend, and we support them strongly in this, that when\n\nin the thirteenth century there was a division between continental\n\nNormandy and the Islands, and King ohn of England retained the\n\nChannel Islands, the Minquiers and the d créhouswerethen, and remain\n\nta-day, part of the possessions of the Crown along with the island of\n\nJersey. Unless that contention can be displaced, 1 think it must be\n\nagreed that most of the detailed discussion in the pleadings becames\n\nirrelevant. And when this single historical argument is supplemented\n\nby the ovenvhelming evidence of continuous and effective possession,\n\nparticularly over the last hundred years and more, it isnot difficult to\n\nunderstand the impatience of the average Jersey man or woman with\n\nany lawyer who disputes their claim.\n\nAn interesting light on this aspect of the case is provided by the\n\nChausey group ofislets-which, as the Court wiiino doubt already be\n\naware, is close tr, Granville on the French coast. The Chausey group, as\n\neveryone agrees, are French to-day, and it is therefore pertinent to ask\n\nbnesKing Henry III in?the yeare1259,land, in fact, as late as the reign of\n\ndng Henry VI1 of England in the year 1500, we find the Chausey\n\ndescribed in a Papal Bull, the Buli of Pope Alexander VI, as part of the\n\nChannel Islands, and unquestionably at that tirne, ~'Bntiçh.I refer to\n\npage 532 of the United Kingdom Reply, where the details of that Buil\n\nWU be found. The Chausey group became French much later, as the\n\nresult of specificacts in the exercisof French sovereignty. And when\n\nyou find, in the case of the Minquiersand the Écréhous,not this process\n\nof trançfer to France, but, on the contrary, the intensification of acts\n\nand incidents of British sovereignty and character, preciseIy paralIeI to\n\nthose exercised by France in the case of the Chausey, the admitted title\n\nof France to the Chausey becomes a very relevant point, not infavour\n\nof the French claim but againstit.\n\nThe French legal advisers clearly appreciated the danger of this\n\nargument and with characteristic quickness of thought they adopted\n\nthe offensive in their pleadinga by asserting that the Minquiers are\n\ndependenciesofthe Chauseygroup. This, ofcourse,would be an excellent\n\npoint, iit could be established, butaU the evidence is tothe contrarfr ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIR L.HEALD (u.K.)-17 IX 53 23\n\neffect. It is summarized in the Reply of the United Kingdom Government\n\nat pages531-53t2 o,which1 havealready referred. Finally, upon thispoint,\n\nthe actual behaviour of the French Government itself is sureIy quite\n\ninconsistent with any relation of dependence between the Chausey groiip\n\nand the Minquiers. In the case of the former, the Chausey, a number\n\nof administrative and protective acts are on record, and if one sees the\n\nChausey from the air, one sees the concrete results in siich things as\n\njetties and buildings. The French have, in fact, done at the Chausey\n\nexactly the same as Jersey has done at the Minquiers and Écréhous :\n\nthey have constructcd slipways, landing stages and so on. They have\n\nalso performed numerous other acts of sovereignty, no doubt. If the\n\nMinquiers really are a dependency ofthe Chausey, as is alleged, how is it\n\nthat France has never extended to the Minquiers any ofthe adminis-\n\ntrative or governmental acts of which the Chausey provide such clear\n\nevidence ? We see that where the French.admittedly do possess the\n\nsovereignty, namely, at the Chausey, they behave accordingly. Then why\n\nnot at the Minquiers and the ficréhousif France hai the sovereignty?\n\nAnd if that were not enough, how can one reconcile with the French\n\ncontention the fact thatprecisely thoçe acts, which have been performed\n\nby France at the Chausey but not at the Minquiers or the Écréhous,\n\nhave been performed at the latter by Jersey? So 1 maintain that the\n\ncircumstances of theChausey, far from assiçting the French case, provide\n\na strong inferential argument againçt it.\n\nAs regards both the Minquiers and the Ecréhous, the Jerseyman\n\nsays it is a strange thing that, if the French Government ever had a\n\ngood title, it has done so little-infact nothing-to assist or maintain\n\nthat title. He finds sucha clairn put fonvard now, after al1these years\n\nof neglect, contrary to a11the realities as he knows them. This is surely\n\nalso a perfectly sound objection in law. We are not concerned here\n\nto-day with what \\vas the position seven hundred years or even one\n\nhundred years ago. What the Court has to decide, according to the\n\nCompromis, is the position to-day. The words are : \"Whether the\n\nsovereignty belongsV-not whether the sovereignty \"belonged\" in the\n\npast. If we were to take the French argument literally and ignore\n\neverytiiing that has happened \"after the dispute was bom\", asthey\n\nSay, we rnight fmd ourselves arguing quite easily that, despite what\n\nhappened in 1776. New York is still really a British colony. If one\n\nis to-ignore everything which happens \"after the dispute is born\",\n\nas the French Say, al1 the acts of the United States Congress, let aIone\n\nthose of Jefferson and Lafayette, must equally be ignored. We shall\n\ndeal with this argument of \"critical dates\" in detail later, but it is,\n\nI think, relevant to mention it here, to show how manifestly absurd\n\niC would be to ignore the modem history of the Minquiers and the\n\nEcréhous. For, we contend, it is precisely by such evidence, and by\n\nno other, that the recent acts of peaceful and effective possession\n\nrequired by international tribunals can be established.\n\nAs regards the geographical aspect of the case,some members of\n\nthe Court rnight possibly have been moved by the French plea that\n\nthese two groups are situated very close to France. But aIIthe Channef\n\ninstance,riçractually nearer to the French mainland than are thefor\n\nMinquiers. Moreover, the Minquiers are nearer to Jersey than they\n\nare to the mainland of France, and they are actually further away ,\n\n3£rom the mainland of France than Jersey itself is. If any member of\n\nthe Court should feel sympathy with this particular French plea,\n\nhowever, I would ask him to remember what I said earlier, that the\n\nentity actually affected by these proceedings is Jersey. Now, al1 these\n\nislands are closer to Jersey than they are to the French mainland.\n\nIt iç certainly not Our view that geogaphical propinquity is in itselfiis.\n\na ground of title, and we should never think of putting fonvard a\n\nclaim to the Minquiers and the Écréhous on that ground alone. Al1\n\nthat we Say, and this is what 1 want to draw to the attention of the\n\nCourt, is that in so far as this consideratioisat al1relevant, it operates\n\njust as much in our favour as it does in that of France, if not more so.\n\nTo conclude these introductory remarks, 1 would like to Say some-\n\nthing about the actual facts as they exist to-day, in relation to the\n\ndisputed groups. The claims of both the parties are alike in this, that\n\nthey are founded on a clah of ancient right and title. But there the\n\nresemblance ends. The United Kingdom claim is also founded on\n\nIong continued effective possession and control of the groups and on\n\nthe actual and concrete exercise of sovereignty in respect of thern.\n\nFrance's claim is not so founded, and it would be no exaggeration\n\nto Say that the French claim is founded on an aIIeged original title\n\nand nothing else-for never at any time-at any time at d-has\n\nFrance, as France, ever possessed these groups or exercised the least\n\ncontrol or authorit y over them except during certain temporary military\n\noccupations. Indeed, French acts of savereignty in respect of them\n\nare virtually non-existent. You wiilhear in greater detail £romMr. Har-\n\nrison later about the present-day situation, but to dl outward appear-\n\nance, these içlands are purely British and nothing else. The groups,\n\nas the Court is weU aware, do not consist of mere rocks and reefs,\n\nthough our opponents have at times suggested that they do. A glance\n\nat the photographs comprising the Annex C series to Our Mernorial\n\nshows the faliacy of this-and 1 am sure the Court will carefully study\n\nthese photographs, which, I venture to suggest, are of considerable\n\nintereçt. The two groups are adminiçtered aspart of parishes situated\n\nin Jersey. The houses on them, owned by Jersey residents and others,\n\nare registered in Jersey. Rates and taxes in respect of thern are paid\n\nto the Jersey authorities. The same authorities have carried out public\n\nworks on the islandç, such as the construction of sljpways and landing\n\nstages,the establishment of custom-houses, and so on. AU this has\n\nbeen in existence for a long time. With the single exception, to which\n\nnlr.Hamson wiii refer in due course, of a hut for the protection of\n\nmariners in stormy weather, the houses and buildings on both groups\n\naredl Jersey or English owned. They have been erected by Jerseymen\n\nor by the authorities of Jersey. There are no French residents there\n\nnor are there any French perçons registered as owners of property\n\non the groups. The law which is applied there is purely Jersey law.\n\nIf the rnernbersccauldpay a visit to these islets, as I myself havedone,\n\nthey would find that such officiaisasthey met would be Jersey officia$;\n\nthe residents they found there would be Jersey or English. It would\n\nbe the arms of Jersey that they would find on the Custorn-House, .\n\nthe British flag on the flagstaff, andso forth. If they asked any owner\n\nof property where his property was registered, they would be told\n\n\"in Jersey\". If they askedto whom he paid his rates and taxes in ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIR L, HEALD (u.K.)-17 1x 53 25\n\nrespect of his property, they would be toId \"to the Jersey authorities,\n\nof course\". If they asked when a French officialhad last visited either\n\nof the groups, a Jerseyman would certainly answer : \"Not within\n\nliving memory\", or if he said \"Never\", it would probably not be very\n\nfar from the actual tnitli. They would also find much evidence, both\n\non the islets themselves and in Jersey, that this situation has been\n\nin existence for a great many years, that it ha been in existence really\n\nfor centuries, and that the direct evidenceof it during the 1st century\n\nand a half, or even longer, rvasabundant.\n\nWhat better example, Mr. President, couId one have of the existence\n\nand exercise of sovereignty ? The flagstaff, the execution of public\n\nworks, the imposition of local taxation, custom-houses, registration\n\nof title to land, inquest on dead bodies, jurisdiction over criminal\n\nofThose being the actua! facts, the actual situationdineand relating to\n\nthese groups, the Court can well imagine the effect produced on the\n\nrninds of the people of Jersey by this French claim, based as it ison\n\nnothing more tangible or concrete than the claim of ancient right-\n\na highly technical claim, deriving from nothing more than an abstract\n\nfeudal title.\n\nThere is in fact absolutely no reality about this clai;and that is so\n\nobvious to anyone who visits the islets that one cannot Iielp asking\n\nperhaps-and 1 believe ithas been asked-what it is that has caused\n\nthis matter to be brought before the Court. Anyone ~vhoreads the diplo-\n\nmatic correspondence of the last 70 or 8o.years cannot faiI to be struck\n\nby the fact that the claims, which France has at certain times put\n\nforward, have remained paper claims, never followed up in any way.\n\nAs regards the Écréhous, no interchanges at al1 took place between the\n\nparties after the year 1888, and very few about the Minquiers. Taken\n\nin relation to the history of the case in the Middle,Ages and aftenvards,\n\nand to the situation of fact in the islands which 1 have described, it\n\nseems cIear that France, while not willing formally to abandon her\n\nclaim, was not prepared to assert it, or to ernbark on any attempt\n\nactually to exercise sovereignty over the groups. We on the other hand\n\nin Jersey were exercising sovereignty, and we had no doubt at al1about\n\nour right so to do.\n\nIn Jersey, ashlr. Harrison will te11you, it never occurred to anyone\n\nthat these isIands were other than dependencies of Jersey and in every\n\nrespect British territory. Before the war there was no reason why the\n\ncase should ever come before an internation-a1 tribunal, because there\n\nwas really nodoubt about the position. It was really asan indirect reçult\n\nof the war that this case has now come before the Court. During the\n\nwar, the Channel Islands were occupied by the Gerrnans, and Jersey\n\nfishermen were forbidden to visit the Minquiers or the Ecréhous. When\n\nthe occupation ended, and natives of Jersey were for the first time in\n\nfive years able to go to these isIets, they found, especially at the Min-\n\nquiers, that they were being fished by French fishermen in considerable\n\nnumbers. As Mr. Harrison will tell you and as appears from certain of\n\nthe affidavits of Jerseymen which have been reproduced in the annexes\n\nto the written pleadings, this was something new-for in fact there was\n\nvery little French fishing at these islets before. 1 shodd perhaps have\n\nmentioned that the mainland of France was liberated in 1944 but the\n\nejection of the Germans from the Channel Islands could not be effected26 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIR L.HEALD (u.K.)-17 IX 53\n\nuntil May 1945 .t was only then that this new state of affairs at the\n\nMinquiers and the Écréhous was discovered, and a difficult situation\n\nnaturaliy arose, as the Jersey fishermen's Iivelihood was being senously\n\nafiected by this cornpetition. The United Kingdom Governmcnt there-\n\nfore asked the Government of the French Republic to recognize and\n\nadmit the British title. But, as1said just aow, the Government of the\n\nFrench Republic, while it had in practice, and indeed really for many\n\ncenturies, acquiesced in the Britis phossession of these islets-not on\n\npaper, of course, but in substance-the Government of the Republic\n\nwas not willing formally to admit our claim, and therefore the upshot\n\nofthe matter was the submission of the dispute to this Court.\n\nIt is not easy to understand the attitude of the French authorities\n\nin regard to these groups. For example, they have let pass not only\n\nwithout protest, but without the slightest comment, acts of the most\n\npublic character-clear exercises of State. aythori,ty-carried out by\n\nthe Jersey authorities in the Minquiers and the Ecréhous-acts of a l\n\nkind such as-one would think-no country genuinely possessed of\n\nsovereignty over a temtory could possibly pass over in silence if done\n\nby another country. The French explanation of this-fhat they could\n\nnot be expeçted to know everything that was going on in the islets-\n\nis not very convincing. It is, in fact, significant, for surely a govern-\n\nment does know what goes-on in what it claims as its territory, so\n\nnear its coasts.\n\nAgain, we shall show later how considerable is the extent to which\n\nthere can be said to have been a veritableBriti~hcornmrcnityliving,\n\nor owning property, on the Minquiers and the Ecréhous, registenng\n\nin Jersey the title totheir property or dwellings on the islets, paying\n\ntheir rates and taxes for them to the Jersey authorities, and submitting\n\nthemselves generally to Jersey law and jurisdiction : and, of course,\n\nno such French community at any time. I would ask the Court to\n\nconsider how extraordinary has been the attitude of the Govcrnment\n\nof the French Republic to this, comrnunity, if, as our opponents\n\nmaintain, the Minquiers and the Ecréhous are, and always have been,\n\nFrench. If this were correct, it would rnean that this comrnunity has\n\nbeen living or owning property on French soil for one hundred years\n\nor more. Yet there is no evidence that any French official ever went\n\nof the application of French laiv, there is no judgment of any Frenche\n\ncourts in respect of them, or of anything occurring in thcm or in\n\nrelation to them. If the houses and buildings concerned are on French\n\nsoil, in what registcr of property is theowrierçhip recorded ? To what\n\nFrench authorities have their owners ever bcen responsible for them,\n\nor for any taxes or rates due in respect of them ? If this is indeed\n\nFrench territory, how can it be explained that propertyha been bought\n\nand sold there in accordance with Jersey law, and registered in Jersey?\n\nMr. President, iis notsufficient to Saythat al1this happened because\n\nthe pcrsons concerned were Jerseymen, that it was based on some\n\npersona1 consideration. We shall bring out this point very clearly\n\nIater and we can show clearly that the basis of all these acts was not\n\npersonal but territorial. But in any event, surely the merc fact that\n\nal1 those concerned were Jerseymen, or English, is significant. If this\n\nwere French soil, dependent on the French mainland, as our apponents\n\nclairn, why were tliey not Frenchmen ? Why were not at least some ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIR L. HEALD (u.K.)-17 IX 53\n\n27\n\nof them French, at any rate ? Normdly, if a country has sovereignty\n\nover a given piece of temtory. the persons, or most of them, or some\n\nof them at least, in that territory or owning property in it, would be\n\nexpected to be nationals of that country and not of some other.\n\nWe say, therefore, that al1 these things on the Minquiers and the\n\nEcréhous were carried out in accordance with Jersey law because this\n\nwas the applicable law and no other law was applicable. 1 would\n\ninvite the attention of the Court to the liçt of perçons given in\n\nAnnex A 98 to the United Kingdom Memorial as owning dwellings,\n\nbuildings or other property on the Minquiers or the Écréhous. If the\n\nFrench claim were to be admitted, those persons would suddenly find\n\nthat they were and always had been subject to French Iaw, that their\n\nproperty was on French, not British, soil, that even to visit their own\n\nproperty they would require a passport and would Iiave to conform\n\nto French immigration, customs, and other regulations. In other wordç,\n\nthey would find themselves in a position totally at variance with fact\n\nand reality, and I submit that this is an aspect of the matter to which\n\nthe Court cannot fail to give the most serious attention.\n\nIf 1 may give one concrete example, if the Court would look at the\n\nphotograph Annex C6, Part IV,Volume IV, of the Memorial, the Court\n\nwill see there a picture of a two-storied house at Blanc lle, owned by\n\nhfajorR. J. B. Bolitho, a Jersey resident. Rlr. President, Major Bolitho\n\nand his wife are here to-day in Court, having sailed here in their oivn\n\nboat from Jersey in order to attend this case to which they and the other\n\ninhabitants of Jersey attach so much importance. Major Bolitho's wife\n\nenjoys the name of Lemprière, one of the best-known names in Jersey,\n\nand her family have owned this land for many, many years past. So\n\nthere we find a concrete example of someone, a man and his ivife, the\n\nwife belonging to an ancient family of Jersey, who, ifthis Court were to\n\ndecicle in accordance with the French claim, will suddenly find that al1\n\nthis time, without knowing it, they have been really for al1 practical\n\npurposes living in France. Well, that seems to me a rather remarkable\n\nsituation.\n\nIn thefirst instance, therefore, hlr. Presiden1maintain quite simply\n\nthat, although France claims sovereignty and, by insisting on that claim\n\nin the face of al1 the realities, has compelled this dispute to be brought\n\nbefore the Court, she has not in fact conducted herself in relation to the\n\nislands as a country normally would do which possesses sovereignty.\n\nThe Jersey authorities, on the other hand, have, If you ask, for instance,\n\nwho constructed the necessary public works and facilities on theisIands,\n\nagain the answer is : the Jersey authorities. If you ask who has installed\n\nand wlio keeps up the buoys, beacons, marks and other aids to the\n\nnavigation of the islands, the answer is the same. The French buoying\n\nof the Minquiers, on wliich they rely, as we shallshow later, is outside\n\nthe reef or plateau, at a distance of more than threc miles from the\n\nmain islands, directed towards facilitating the entry of ships into St.\n\nMa10and Granville, and, in fnct, rather to keep shipping away from the\n\nMinquiers than to facilitate the approach to it. Again, when you corne\n\nto askywho has esercised the necessary jurisdiction in respect of offences,\n\nwho has held inquests and so on, the answer is equally : the authorities\n\nand courts of Jersey. There isno trace of any evidence of such things\n\nbeing cloneby any French authority. Equally one can Say this of espcndi-\n\nture. Considerable sums have been expended by the Jersey authorities : ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIR L.HEALD (u.K.)-17 IX 53\n\n28\n\nnone, so far as weknow, has ever been expended by France. Mr.Harrison\n\nwill give the details of this in due course: 1 shall not delay the Court\n\nover them. It is, however, important to emphasize that claims to sover-\n\neignty cannot be divorced from responsibility for the territory claimed.\n\nAn affirmation of sovereignty involves a duty to carry outits obligations.\n\nNo one can doubt that it isby Jersey that these obligations and responsi-\n\nbilities have, in fact, been carrieclout and discharged. France has not\n\nbeen willing to make any forma1admission of the British claim, but she\n\nhas, nevertheless, been willing to allow the Jersey authorities to carry\n\nout theresponsibilitiesand incur espenditure in connection with these\n\ngroups. 1 venture to suggest that these are points of significance. Deci-\n\nsions of international tribunals, to which we shall later refer, showvery\n\nclearIy the importance that has always becn attached to the question :\n\nwhich party has demonstrated by its conduct its belief in the validity of\n\nits claim, and has on that basis conducted itself after the manner of a\n\nresponsible sovereign authority ? . ,\n\nOur opponents have, of course, naturally tried to discount and to\n\nminimjze the significance of much that Jersey has done, principally,\n\nI think, upon the ground-as 1 have already mentioned in passing-\n\nthat most of those acts are explicable on a basis of jurisdiction exercised\n\nratione @ersom over Jerseymen, not ratione soli .his argument, 1 sub-\n\nmit, is misconceived. In the first place, it could not apply at ail to many\n\nof the acts concerned, for example, the construction of public works\n\nand facilities on the isletthe opening of cnstom-houses, and so on. For\n\nthese are clear acts 01sovereignty in any event.\n\nAs regards police and the exercisc of legal jurisdiction, thereisno\n\ndoubt at all-as iveshali suggest to the Court-that the basis is tem-\n\nhearing from hlr. Hamson in due course, but also, 1suggest,h yasa matter\n\nof generallegal principle.I willgire the Court one exampie-the holding\n\nof inquesb on deceased perçons who might be found at the Minquiers\n\nand the Ecréhous. The basis of this act could not be personal, for the\n\nfollowingreasons. In the first place, the nationality of the deceased person\n\nis,not officially established until the enquiry is held. Part of the object\n\nof the enquiry, in fact, would be to ascertain the identity of the dead\n\nperson. Secondly, at the inquest no accused person is before the court,\n\nfor the other object of the enquiry is to ascertain how the deceased met\n\nhis death. It rnay have been accident, it may have been suicide: only\n\nif the facts pointed to a crime ~vouldthe rnatter lead to a triaand that\n\nwould be quite a separate proceeding. Unquestionably, therefore, the\n\nholding of an inquest on the finding of a dead body is an act of territorial\n\njurisdiction. Iis an enquiry carried outby authorities ofaterritory with\n\nregard to something which has occurred in that territory, an adminis-\n\ntrative rather than a judicial act, carricd out as a measure of good\n\ngovernment. So far as 1 am aware, proceedings of thiç character are\n\nnever held except in respect of bodies which are found within the terri-\n\ntorial jurisdiction of the authority concerned. Can it be imagined that\n\nthe Jersey authorities would hold an inqucst on the death of a man in\n\nFrance ? And, in fact, some of the deceased persons who have been\n\nconcemed in inquests in Jersey have, in fact, been Frenchmen whose\n\nbodies have been found there, but the nationality of the deceaçed is\n\nquite irrelevant. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIR L.HEALD (u.K.)-17 IX 53\n\n29\n\nMr. President, a few moments ago, when 1was refen-ing to the actual\n\nlist of residents in houses on these islets, 1 mentioned that one of those\n\ninhabitants and hiswife were present here andhad come here in order\n\nto act as representatives of al1those who were interested in the matter,\n\nand 1 notice that the interpreter, who serves us so weii and faithfully\n\nin these matters, did not mention that fact. 1 think that it is perhaps\n\ndesirable that itshould be made quite clear when people have taken\n\nthe trouble to come here inorder to show the great local interest in the\n\nmatter.\n\n1 now wish to Say one word with regard to this question of rating.\n\nRating, as the Court wiil probably know, is an expression used particu-\n\nlarly in English law in relation to the local taxation of property, as\n\nopposed to the word \"taxes\" which is used in relation to the national\n\ntaxation. Towards the bottom of page 721 of the French Rejoinder, 1\n\nfind it stated(1quote) :\n\n\"As regards the rating of houses, these mesures were in Jersey\n\nand did not give rise to any important or overt act in thetemtory\n\nunder dispute.\"\n\nThe implication here is that no act is an act of sovereignty in relation\n\nto given territory unless it takcs place inside that territory. There is, so\n\nfar as 1am aware, no warrant for any such proposition. History abounds\n\nin examples ofacts of sovereignty carried out by or from one temtory\n\nin relation to another. Canone think of a clearer example of an assertion\n\nof sovereignty than the levying of taxes on houses and property ? In\n\nno country in the world, 1believe, do the authorities levy taxes on houses\n\nand property which is not within their jurisdiction. For example, if an\n\nEnglishman owns property in France, it is the French authorities who\n\nlevy the rates and taxes on that property. It would be inconceivable\n\nthat the United Kingdorn authorities wouid think of doing so, and\n\ntherefore surely such mesures are the clearest possible evidence that\n\nthe authorities concerned have, or at least claim to have, authority over\n\nthe territory in question. The passage which 1 cited from the French\n\nRejoinder continues as follows (1 quote) :\n\n\"Actually they [that is to Say, the rating measures] only consti-\n\ntute evidence of the existence on those reefs of the houses on which\n\nthe rates were levied.\"\n\nBut surely these measures are evidencc of much more than that : they\n\nare evidence of sovereignty over the territory, otlierwise the measures\n\ncould never have been taken. For such rates are essentially a Ievy for\n\nservices which the local authorities render in respect of the property\n\nconcerned. The services are rendered in respect of houseç and property\n\nwould not be rendering any service if the house was in France, even ifs\n\nit belonged to a Jerseyman. They would leave that to the French author-\n\nities,,who would also Ievy the rates. It is just because the Minquiers and\n\nthe Ecréhousare Jersey territory that such rates are Ievied. There is no\n\nother possible basis in law or principle that 1 can understand.\n\nI think it is helpful if 1 invite the Court to consider a little more\n\nclosely what are the implications of the French attitude in these sorts\n\nof matters. There is no attempt to show why, if the islets were French,\n\nand, as is maintained, dependencies of the French coast, there is no ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIR L.HEALD (u.K.)-17 IX 53\n\n30\n\nattempt to show why the houses on them were not French, registered\n\nin France according to French law and with these rates levied upon\n\nthem by the local authorities inreturn for services performed for the\n\ninhabitants by those authorities. There is no suggestion. that I am\n\naware of, of anyinstance of the exercise of jurisdiction ratione soli on\n\nthe basis of French law. It is merely denied that it has been so exercised\n\non the basis of English or Jersey law, Now if this were to be correct it\n\ncould surely only lead ta the conclusion that there is or was no law\n\nterritoridy applicable to this land at ali-thathe land is land without\n\na jus soliN,ow is that a tenable proposition ? In the first instance it\n\nimplies that the groups are or were res ndius. That will be discussed\n\nnextrit fails to provide for something which with such islands asthese is\n\nsurely an absolute essentid. It might not matter very much if some\n\nremote atollin the Pacific, or rock in the Arctic sea, lacks any applicable\n\njws soli but such a situation cannot be admissible with regard to islands\n\nclose to the mainland of Europe and close to important sea traffic\n\nroutes. Suppose, for example, that someone who is neither French nor\n\nBritish were to commit a crime on these islands. Neither country could\n\ntry hirn rationepersonce,and if, as is apparently contended, there is no\n\napplicable jus soli, there would be no power to arrest him and send\n\nhim back to his own country. Obvioudy there must be a jus solii: t is\n\nrequired by reason andnecessity. And if so, what is it ? It must be\n\nEnglish or Jersey. Further, we Say that in fact and in history the sole\n\nevidence of the exercise of jurisdiction, of the ap lication of law, isof\n\nthe application of English or Jersey lawand for eat, wc suggest, there\n\nis a very good and sufficient reason which is this : that a art from\n\nvisiting fishermen, al1the residents on both groups anda11t1 e owners\n\nof property are andalways have been Jerseymen or Englishmen and\n\nnearly al1 the habitations, practically al1 the habitations, have always\n\nbeen Jersey or English built and owned, with their title deeds registered\n\nbe Jersey or English law. That really cornes to the application of thell\n\nold tag res ipsa loquitur, for it is just what one would expect, if the\n\nislands are British islands, dependencies of Jersey. In those circum-\n\nstances there would be notliing surprising in finding that the residents\n\nand property owners are English or Jerseymen. It is what one would\n\nexpect. What would be surprising would be to find this degree of English\n\nand Jersey residence and the absence ofFrench residence, if the groups\n\nwere French. That would indeed require some explanation. The obvious\n\nconclusion is surely the natural one. Jersey people live on the islets and\n\nown houses there, and Jersey law applies, because the islets are British,\n\nand because they are dependencies of Jersey.\n\nMT.President, 1have now cornpleted what 1 wish to say about what\n\n1 might call the setting and context of this case, and 1 hope that 1\n\nhave not detained the Court too long with that part of my address.\n\nNext, 1 would iike to tellthe Court how we propose to present Our\n\nargument. It seems to us that this case falls naturally into three\n\ndifferent parts. There is first the older, more historical part, the events\n\nof the Midde Ages and of Iater years up to the eighteenth and nine-\n\nteenth centuries-what 1 might call the \"ancient times\". Next there\n\ni\"recent times\", leading up to the very point where the dispute was referred to the Court. But then there is a third and quite separate\n\nsection of the case-in our view quite irrelevant and quite unnecessary\n\n-which anses entirely from the French contention that al1the events\n\nwhich have occurred since a date in 1839, when a certain Fishery Con-\n\nvention*was signed between the Parties, should be ignored and treated\n\nas if they never took place at all. This has always seemed to us to be\n\na very extraordinary contention, especially when one rernembers the\n\nslender foundation on which it is based-a simple provision about\n\nfishing for oysters-something that seems to have nothing to do with\n\nany question of sovereignty. \\Ve are not ail of us assembled here to-\n\nday to decide to which country these islets belonged in 1839, but to\n\ndecide to which country they belong fiow.That was the question put\n\nto the Court by the Special Agreement or Compromis which submitted\n\nthis dispute to the Court. And it seems a strange thing that our French\n\nfriends should now really seek, in efiect, to put a severe limitation\n\nuthey have referred to it.e Court to decide the very question which\n\n' However, since our opponents have raised this curious issue, we\n\nshall be obliged to deal with it. Our scheme of presentation of the\n\ncase wiIl be this. My own remaining observations will be of a general\n\ncharacter relating to the case as a whole, but in the course of them 1\n\nshaii try to bring out certain further points of particular interest and\n\nimportance. But 1 shall also draw the attention of the Court to certain\n\nlegal considerations, which arise out of past decisions of international\n\ntnbunals on questions of territorial sovereignty, decisions which, in\n\nour view, are of special relevance to the present case. Mr. Fitzmaurice\n\nwili then deal with the French contention about the year 183-that\n\nis, what has been called the question of the \"critical date\". Here 1\n\nought to Say at once that of course we in no way dispute that in this,\n\nas in every other case of a disputed clairn to temtory, there must be\n\nsome date which can be described as the \"critical date\", subsequent\n\nto which no legal significance or effect would attach to acts which\n\nmight otherwise be relevant from the point of view of title. We, how-\n\never, differ from our opponents radically as to what that date should\n\nbe in the present case. According to us, the proper date to take for\n\nthat purpose is the date of the signature of the Compromis-Decem-\n\nber 2gth, 1950 O.bviously, anything which has happened since that date\n\ncan be disregarded. But, according to Our opponents, the critical date\n\nis August znd, 1839,the date of the signature of the 1839 Fishery Con-\n\nvention, and our opponents appear to have made this differencebetween\n\nthe Parties a principal issue in the case. We do not so regard it, as 1\n\nhave already pointed out, and we Say that, in effect, it isquite incon-\n\nsistent with the very terms of the Compromis which has brought the\n\nmatter before the Court. The Court does not need to be reminded\n\nwhom the sovereignty at present rests. And it wouId be a strangee in\n\nthing if,at the same time, one has to read into that document some\n\nimplication that there is some temporal bar to the Court considering,\n\nand that the Court must shut its eyes to, these most important events\n\nwhich have occurred dunng the last hundred years. But that issue,\n\nhowever irrelevant it may be, is certainly the first-as obviously,\n\nlogically, it precedes ail the others. We shail therefore deal with it\n\nfirst, for that reason only, not because of what we think of its intrinsic32 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIR L. HEALD (u.K.)-17 1X 53\n\nimportance-and, as1 have said, Mr. Fitzmaurice will assume that\n\ntask on oiir behalf. Then, Mr+Preçident, next Professor Wade, who\n\nis Professor of the Law5of England in the University of Cambridge\n\n(and, 1 may Say, one of the most distinpished living British author-\n\nities on constitutional law), will deal with the Middle Ages and the\n\nfollowing period ; and then Mr. Harrison, the Attorney-General for\n\nJersey, as you know, wiil deal with more recent events. He will put\n\nthe particular point of view of Jersey, andhe wïUbe able to deal with\n\ncertain interesting and important legal points, and, as 1 havealready\n\nsaid, he will be speaking on behalf of people whose own position will\n\nbe directIy affected by the outcome of the case.\n\nIt may be convenient if, at this point, 1 recall to the Court what\n\nthe basis of the United Kingdom claim is, as pleaded and asmaintained\n\nby us. In the first place, we argue that the United Kingdom is entitled\n\nto sovereignty over the groups-and 1 quote the actual words that\n\nhave been used: \"by reason of having established the existence of\n\na root of title in ancient times, which is supported by effective pos-\n\nsession in recent times to be found in acts which manifest continuous\n\nand peaceful display of sovereignty over the territories\". Secondly,\n\nand in the alternative, we argue that the United Kingdom is entitled\n\nto sovereignty over the groups (1quote) \"by reason ofhaving established\n\ntitle by effective poçsession alone, such possession being found in acts\n\nwhich manifest a continuous and peaceful display of sovereignty over\n\nthe territories\".\n\nThose are our daims. But there are certain points arising out of\n\nthem which 1must clarify beyond any possibility of misunderstanding.\n\nTo begin with, the expressions \"ancient\" and \"recent\", which 1 used\n\njust now, were first used in theMernorial-they were used before there\n\nwas any question of the raising of the date of 1839.And our expressions\n\n\"ancient\" and \"recent\" have no relation to the year 1839 at all. We\n\nregard 1839as a date which haî no significance ai all in thedispute,\n\nand the use of those words \"ancient\" and \"recent\" arose from the\n\nconsideration that this case was essentially one in which the claimç\n\nof the respective Parties should be considered as a whole over the\n\nentire period. The division of the history into ancient and modem\n\ntimes is simply for the purpose of çonvenience in dealing with the\n\nmatter, particularly having regard to the separation of the subject\n\nbetween two speakers. When we used the expressions in the Memorial,\n\nwe had in mind certain famous words of Judge Huber in the Island\n\nof Palnzascase, which 1 am sure are familiar to members of the Court.\n\nThey are to be found on page go8 of the report in Volume 22 of the\n\nAmerican journal ofInbernationalLaw, and they are these (1 quote) :\n\n\"It is not necessary that the display of sovereignty should be\n\nestablished as having begun at a precise epoch; itsufices that\n\nit had existed at the critical period ....It is quite natural that\n\nthe establishment of sovereignty may be the outcome of a slow\n\nevolution, of a progressive intensification of State control.\"\n\nHavlng that passage in mind, and having regard also to the fact\n\nthat this case covers a period of over a thousand years, the expressions\n\n\"ancient\" and 'Irecent\"-however loose-seem to US to have the\n\nright significanceand thereforeto be suitable for use in stating the case. The second point arising out of our basis of clairn which I should\n\n'like to make clear beyond any possibility of misunderstanding is this.\n\n1 have already said that we are not interested in the date of 1839,\n\n1 now wish to emphasize that, when in the second, or alternative,\n\nclaim we refer to our title based on \"effective possession alone\", we\n\nare again not limiting ourselves in any way by reference to the year\n\n1839. The second claim covers the entire period just as much as the\n\n6rst. It affirrns that there are acts of effective possession, spread over\n\nthe entire thousand years. In the second claim, therefore, we provide\n\nfor the possibility-though of course we deny that it is so-that at\n\nsome point in time the title to sovereignty may have been with France ;\n\nbut we contend that, even if that was so, the United Kingdom has\n\nexercised effective possession over the groups for a sufficiently long\n\nperiod to be entitled now to claim sovereignty over them. In that\n\nrespect, and in that done, does the second claim differ from the first,\n\nwhich assertts hat the United Kingdom done has been sovereign\n\nover the groups throughout the entire period.\n\nThe fact, therefore, Mr. President, that Professor Wade will deal\n\nwith the period broadly up till the end of the eighteenth century and\n\nthat Mr. Harrison will deal wjth the period broadly after 1800, does\n\nnot in any way mean that Professor Wade is dealing with the first\n\npart of the claim and Mr. Harrison with the second. It will also be\n\npartof Professor Wade's task to show that the United Kingdorn can\n\ninvoke an ancient title and has supported that ancient title by effective\n\nBut it will also. be part of Professor Wade's task-andby Mrthis is what\n\n1 am concerned to emphasize lest there should be any misunderstanding\n\n-it will also be part of Professor Wade's task to show that, even if\n\nwe could not establish the existence of a root of title in ancient times,\n\nwe could nevertheless prove that by the nineteenth century the United\n\nKingdom was entitled to sovereignty over the groups by reason of\n\neffective possession alone. If that should be the case, Mr. Harrison.\n\nwill equally be able to show that the title hasbeen effectively main-\n\ntained evcr since, just as he will also be able to show that the title\n\nwhich we claim asbeing rooted in ancient right has been effectively\n\nmaintained.\n\n[Public sittingofSeptember17th,1953a ,jternoon]\n\nMr. President, when the Court adjourned I had just stated how we\n\nproposed to put our case before the Court and I had said that 1 myself\n\nintended to deal with one or two of the fundamental questions. I begin\n\nnow with a rhetorical question:what does one do-what does a govern-\n\nment ordinarily do-when it is called upon to prove or to make good a\n\nclaim to possess, and be the sovereign over, certain territory ? The\n\nanswer, surely, is that you bring forward positive evidence of your\n\nsovereignty, by showing how, and in what way, you have exercised it,\n\nand still do esercise it. You may show how your title originated-but\n\nyou would never normally stop at that. You would show that you not\n\nonly had a title, but that you exercised it-and wereexercising it now-\n\nat the very moment. That is how the existence of sovereignty is proved. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIR L. HEALD (u.K.)-17 IX 53\n\n34\n\nI ho e I can claim that this is just what the United Kingdom Govern-\n\nment R as done in its written pleadings. We claim an original root of\n\ntitle in ancient times-but we have not rested on that. je have been\n\nat pains to show that we have exercised this sovereignty and have\n\nexercised it for a very long time. We have brought forward a great mass\n\nof carefully documented and fully authenticated evidence, which not\n\nonly supports our claim to possess sovereignty, but also shows in very\n\nconsiderable detail how we have exercised this sovereignty in concrete\n\nfashion. In short, we have made a serious-and 1hope not unsuccessful\n\n-attempt to prove Our case.\n\nTo what extent then have Our opponents demonstrated or tried to\n\ndemonstrate theirsovereignty ? To ascertain this, we must examine what\n\nexactly the French case consists of. And I am bound to suggest that it\n\nconsists not of any real affirmative proof of French title, but much more\n\nof an attack on the United Kingdom evidence, with a view to weakening\n\nor destroying its value. It is in fact a negative case,1ashall show later\n\nthat it depends almost exclus~vely on establishing and rnaintaining a\n\npresumption ofan original French sovereignty, which, it is said, must be\n\nassumed still to exist. Yet, as the preamble of Article II of the Com-\n\ntitle:the French Government paysr eaclipaservice to this proposition, but\n\nthen fails altogether to accept its implications. As we pointed out in\n\nparagraph 182 of our Memorial, the fact that the United Kingdom put\n\nin the first written pleading, andisopening the present oral hearing, in\n\nno way makes us plaintiff, or France defendant. It creates no presump-\n\ntion of French sovereignty to be displaced by us, nor does it relieve Our\n\nopponents from the obligation to prove their own title. If indeed any\n\npresumption could be said to exist in the matter, it would surely be in\n\nfavour of the United Kingdom, which is unquestionably actualky exer-\n\ncising the sovereignty at the present time.\n\nIn any event, the fact that the French case takes the form essentially\n\nof an attack on the United Kingdom evidence, emphasizes that al1the\n\npositive evidence of title which the Parties are able to adduce cornes\n\nfrom the British side. The Court cannot ignore the fact that practically\n\nevery originai document, practically all the evidence of the concrete\n\nexercise of sovereignty, has been put inby us,\n\nIf the Court will look at the Annexes to the British Memorial, it will\n\nfind na less than about 75 of such documents and pieces of evidence in\n\nthe Annexes A 7-22 and A 79-140I. n the French Counter-Memorial,\n\nwhere, if anywhere, one might have expecled ta find the positive evid-\n\nence of the French title, there is hardlyasingle original document, and\n\nhardly any extracts from contemporary records, cxcept such as had\n\nalready been cited by us. The whole French Counter-Mernorial on its\n\nhistorical side is simply an attempted refutation of the English case, not\n\na statement ofa French claim to the islets.\n\nSimilarly, the Court will findannexed to the United KingdomReply\n\nmore original documents or pieces of concrete evidence, and still more\n\nare furnished in the volume of Additional Annexes ; whereas annexed\n\nto the French Rejoinder there is nothing except some material relating\n\nthe Bay of Cotentin. This obviously can have a nodrjuridical relevance of\n\nany kind to the question of titIe, and indeed, if it were reaIIy material,\n\nwould it surely not have made such a tardy appearance in the pleadings. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIR L.HEALD (u.K.)-17 IX 53 35\n\nNow, as with the earlier periods, it is equally noticeable that virtually\n\nail the evidence of concrete exercise of sovereignty over the groups in\n\nthe last 150years cornesfrom the United Kingdom's side. To set against\n\nthis, the Government of the Republic can in the same period onlyinvoke\n\nthree acts, al1of them incidentally relating to the Minquiers alone. As\n\nregards the Écréhous there are non?. These three acts relative to the\n\nMinquiers are considered in detail in the United Kingdom Reply, para-\n\ngraphs 233-239 w,here it is shown why we contend that they are quite\n\ninsufficient to support the French claim. We shall go into this again\n\nlater ;1merely surnrnarize the facts now.\n\nThe French pleadings and their method of presentation of documents\n\nconsist of the allegation that modern acts are al1 automatically and\n\nipso facto without value because they occurred after 1839 (although,\n\nin fact, even if it could be accepted that 1839 were the critical date,\n\nsome of the acts occurred before that date). Or else-this was an earlier\n\nto the period 1869-~876wd , hen the dispute is said to have been \"born\"s\n\n(though here again, even if that date could bc accepted, many of the\n\nacts in question occurred before). Alternatively, the value of individual\n\nacts is attacked upon the basis that most of them can be explained\n\nas exercises of jurisdiction ratione persona rather than ratione soli.\n\nIn any case, the French position appears to be not only that the Gov-\n\nernrnent of the Republic need not show any manifestations of French\n\nsovereignty .during this period, but that it is not even necessary\n\nseriously to consider the United Kingdom acts. The general line taken\n\n-1 quote from page 399 of the Counter-Memorial-is that the Govern-\n\nment of the Republic considers it(1 quote) : \"..., unnecessary to\n\nproceed to a detailed examination of the factuaI arguments brought\n\nforward in the British Mernorial\" in respect of the more recent periods.\n\nBut whatever Our opponents may Say, we cannot believe that the\n\nCourt will refuse to give this very important evidence the attention\n\nand consideration it obviously merits. \\Ve believe that no court would\n\ncare to give a decision in a case of this kind that took no account of\n\nanything that had happened in the previous 114 years. Ive suggest,\n\nmoreover, that when the Court finds that the whole case, broadiy\n\nlooked at, consists of a process whereby one side furnishes al1or nearly\n\nal1the positive evidence of title,and the other side produces practically\n\nno counter-evidence, but merely criticizes the value of the other's\n\nevidence, or seeks to write it off as beinga firiori irrelevant, there can\n\nonly be one deduction. Even if it were considered that not al1\n\nthe evidence produced on the British sideisconclusive, or even capable\n\nof being questioned, and even if tliere can be said to be certain gaps\n\nand lacun2 or unexplained factors, nevertheless, it is virtually the\n\nonly positive evidence that exists :there is a considerable quantity of\n\nitand it all points one way.\n\nIf, therefore, the question which the Court has to determine is, as\n\nwe believe, which of the two countries ha the superior title, then we\n\nventure to think that, taking the weight of the evidence as a whole,\n\nthere can only be one answer.\n\n1 would like to give just one example of the French technique of\n\nmere denial to which I have been referring ; others willemerge later.\n\nFor this instance 1 go back to the Middle Ageç. The Court will recollect\n\nthat the Abbot of Val-Richer, throggh his Prior on the gcréhous,36 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIR L, HEALD (u.K,)-17 IX 53\n\nwas summoned to appear, and did appear, before the King's Justices;\n\nin Jersey on a writ of quo warranta, to answer in respect of certain.\n\nmatters affecting his priory. We have claimed this as constituting a.\n\nclear exercise of sovereign jurisdiction over the Écréhous, and as'an,\n\nacknowledgment of it on the part of the Prior, who wns not an English--\n\nman-so that there could be no question here of any exercise of juris--\n\ndiction ratione persona. If, therefore, the Prior, or his syperior the\n\nAbbot-equally not an Englishman-had considered the Ecréhous to~\n\nbe French territory, they must surely have refused to appear before.\n\nan English court and would have regarded themselves as answerable,\n\nonly to a French court. On this basis we have argued that the outcome-\n\nof the proceedlngs was irnmaterial. Whai counted was the clear exercise.\n\nand admission of territorial jurisdiction. That the jurisdiction was in.\n\nfact territorial admits of no doubt, since the subject-matter of the.\n\nproceedings was a nght of property in land, and it is a universal:\n\nprinciple of law, applicable then, as now, that jurisdiction in respect\n\nof territorial rights can only be exercised by the courts of the country-\n\nin which the land issituated or uncler whose sovereignty it cornes,\n\nThe point that I wish to make at this stage is that the French method. !\n\nof dealing with this particular matter is sirnply to deny that the appear--\n\nance of the Prior before the King's courts in Jersey had any implication\n\nthat the Écréhous was English. Our opponents fumish no counter-.\n\ncourts,eorthat French courts everconcerned thernseIveswith the Ecrehous.\n\nbefore any French court in respect of the Ecréhous, as the Prior didd\n\nbefore the English court. Thus, the only positive evidenceof the ex-ercise-\n\nof jurisdiction by any courts over the Ecréhousat that period is on the\n\npart of the English courts, and of this fact the Court cannotfail to takea\n\ndue account. Broadly, it is the same thing al1along the line.\n\nMr. President, we naturally do not criticize our opponents for their.\n\nfailure to adduce positive evidence ofany actual French exercise of sov--\n\nereignty. They cannot make bricks without straw. But the significant fact\n\nremains that this negative presentation of their case is the best that\n\nthey can dc-the only thing they can do in the absence of any positive-\n\nevidence. Even if Ouropponents succeeded in discounting the significance-\n\nof the British evidences of title, they would still, we suggest, not have.\n\neçtablished the title of France, because they have shown no instance in\n\nwhich, in all the long history of these islands, France has ever actuaUy.\n\nexercisedany sovereignty over, or in respect of, them. Yet the dispute-\n\nhas been submitted to the Court under the Compromis on the basis-\n\nthat in fact these islands must be under the sovereignty of one or other.\n\nof the two couniries, Can there then be any doubt that they must be-\n\nunder the sovereignty of that one ofthem which can produce the greatest\n\nweight of positive evidence in support of its claim ? And can there be-\n\nany doubt, if the evidence islooked at as a whole, that the country which\n\ncan do this is the United Kingdom 7 We shaU show that so far as any\n\nconsiderations based on history, geography, or contiguity are concemed,\n\nwe can at least match any title France can put fornard ;while, on the-\n\nother hand, we can put forward an incornparably greater weight of-\n\nevidence of the actual exercise of sovereignty far exceeding, particularly.\n\n(but by no means exclusively) during the last century or two, anything.\n\nFrancecan addüce. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIR L.HEALD @.K.)-17 IX 53 37\n\n1have insisted somewhat on this matter because, unleçs the evidence\n\nwere looked at as a whole, it would be very easy to corne to a conclusion\n\nwhich woüld not accord with the facts or the realities of the situation.\n\nThe history of the case extends to over a thousand years if we take as\n\nthe starting point the year 933,at about which time William Longsword,\n\nDuke of Normandy, extended his nile over the Channel Islands. It is\n\nnow 1953-one thousand and twenty years on. Much that has happened\n\nin those thousand and twenty years may be obscure, there are certain\n\ngaps and silences, there is room for dispute and argument, and the\n\nmedievalists may not always agree about the exact value or legal effect\n\nof this or that act or factor. Rut al1 doubt and uncertainty vanishes\n\nwhen we look at the case and the evidence as a whole, for then the\n\npicture is one of Britishvereigiity definitely and continuously exercised\n\nfor many centuries and evidenced b numerous concrete acts.\n\nMay 1 now carry my analysis O rthe French case a stage further.\n\nCareful consideration wiIl show not only that it is a negative case.\n\noffering practically no evidence of French exercise of sovereignty, but\n\nalso that it is founded and depends on one single, simple and all-\n\nembracing proposition, which really constitutes the entire French case.\n\nThis proposition isas follows. Our opponents Say that France originally\n\nhad the sovereignty, in the serise that it was vested in the Kings of\n\nFrance asfeudal overlords of the Dukes of Normandy. (Whether that\n\nview is correct or not,1 am not concerned at this moment to discuçs,\n\nthough, aswe shall show later, it is in fact dubious. However, 1 will\n\npass that over for the moment.) The next step in the French argument\n\nis that soon after 1200 the Channel Islands became separated from\n\ncontinental Normandy ; but, according to. the French thesis, the\n\nsovereignty of the Kings of France over the Channel Islands auto- '\n\nmatically continued except to the extent to which the English were\n\nor came to be in actual possession or control of any of the islands.\n\nand control of certain of the islands such as Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney\n\nand others, but, according to our opponents, we cannot show this\n\nwith regard to the Minquiers and Écréhous. Consequently, they Say,\n\nthe original French sovereignty over these two groups automatically\n\ncontinued and still exists to-day.\n\nSuch is, fundamentally, the French argument, and on that basis\n\nOur French friends, metaphoricall speaking, sit back and say that\n\nthere is no more for them-to do. I he bal1 is now in our court and it\n\nis for us to prove out effective possession and control of ttwo groupa\n\nin dispute. If we cannot do this, they say, France must be adjudged\n\nsovereign, and therefore al1 that the Government of the Republic\n\nhas to do is to show that the evidence we can adduce of having exer-\n\ncised, and of nolv exercising, the effective possession and control is,\n\nfor one reason or other, dubious, or valueless for the purpose of\n\nestablishing our sovereignty. If the Court wili look atpage 722 of the\n\nFrench Rejoinder, and at the conclusion which appears asthe final\n\nparagraph of Sub-Section 1, it will see that the French position is,\n\nin effect, precisely as1 have suggested, narnely, it is said that the\n\nUnited Kingdom is not entitled to invoke any acts perforrned çub-\n\nsequent to 1839, and France is not under any necessity to do so,\n\nbut need only show that the United Kingdom acts are inadequate or\n\ninvalid.38 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIR L.HEALD (u.K.)-17 IX 53\n\nIt is literally true, therefore, that the Frenchcase begins and ends\n\nwith the Middle Ages. After that there isnothing. Even in the Middle\n\nAges what was there? Nothing but an abstractioa-nothing but a\n\nbare feudal right devoid of any content or substance.\n\nNow, Mr. Yresident, as I shall presently show, on the bais of\n\nrevious decisions of international tnbunals, the French attitude which\n\nP have describcd is unsound, and the whole French thesis is based\n\nupon a misconception.
