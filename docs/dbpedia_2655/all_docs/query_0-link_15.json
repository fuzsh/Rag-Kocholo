        "text": "On October 17th we shall be hosting a breakfast discussion in Pinsent Masons’ London office with the Solicitor General, Edward Garnier QC of the Attorney General’s Office, and Richard Alderman, Director of the Serious Fraud Office.\n\nThe Solicitor General and the Director of the SFO are seeking views from practitioners, corporates and others on the government’s consideration of introducing a form of Deferred Prosecution Agreement to strengthen its armoury in enforcing against complex economic crime.\n\nAt the breakfast meeting at our offices the Solicitor General and the Director of the SFO will explain the proposals under consideration and the reasons for considering changing the present system.\n\nThe floor will then be thrown open for discussion.\n\nWe have written on numerous occasions (including here, here, here and here) about the inadequacy of the present UK system. In summary the UK system needs to provide certainty and finality for corporates in the same way as the US system to avoid what we have termed, enforcement arbitrage.\n\nIt is proposed that the output from these informal discussions with the Solicitor General and the SFO Director will be included in the government’s proposals in a future consultation.\n\nJoin us to communicate your views to the Solicitor General and the SFO Director or if you would prefer, communicate your views to us and we will communicate them on your behalf at the meeting."
