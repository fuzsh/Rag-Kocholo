        "text": "Harborough MP Sir Edward Garnier has joined anti-wind turbine campaigners who staged a protest walk against plans to erect masts on two rural sites.\n\nMore than 40 people gathered in Burton Overy to complain about schemes which they say “will ruin the High Leicestershire landscape.”\n\nHarborough District Council has received a planning application for a 253ft turbine at Burton Brook Farm and another for a 243ft mast at a site a quarter-of-a-mile away.\n\nSir Edward said: “I have objected and will continue to object to applications for wind turbines in the wrong place.\n\n“We need to see a positive economic case as well as a satisfactory environmental case for these structures before they can be approved.\n\n“I have yet to see a good argument that does not depend on massive taxpayer subsidies for these turbines, not just when they are not generating power but even when they are.”\n\nThe walk on Saturday was organised by Fran Brown, chairman of Burton Overy Parish Council.\n\nShe and many other residents from the two villages are concerned the proposals to install vast wind turbines in the area will ruin the local landscape without providing any compensatory benefit to energy users.\n\nThe Burton Brook scheme, by Prowind UK, is a revised project which was rejected by planning officers last year.\n\nShe said: “We walked to the site of the Burton Brook mast and talked to a local tenant farmer who was worried about the impact importing all the concrete would have on the local ecology.\n\n“We also walked to a spot where we could see the site of the other scheme, by farmer David Holman.\n\n“Both masts would have an over-dominant impact on unspoilt countryside.”\n\nDr Kevin Feltham, county councillor for the area, also joined the protest.\n\nDr Feltham said: “High Leicestershire is a particularly unspoilt landscape and these two turbines would dominate it and have an imposing impact.\n\n“My concern about the application by Mr Holman is that it is very close to the A6 and could easily distract drivers travelling between Kibworth and Great Glen.\n\n“I believe most of the people who gathered on Saturday are not against wind energy, but the turbines have to be in the right place. These are not.”\n\nA spokesman for Prowind UK disagreed and said the community at large has to accept the need for green energy generation.\n\nMr Holman said his scheme would provide energy for local residents and he has pledged to inject £25,000 a year into community projects.\n\nThe parish council also organised a meeting on the two projects, which was held at the Burton Overy village hall last night."
