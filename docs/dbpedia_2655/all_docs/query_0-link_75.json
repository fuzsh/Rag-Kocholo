        "text": "Justice Series with BPP Law School, 2020\n\nThe UK’s justice system rests on proven principles and practises – the right to a fair hearing and a rule against bias. How can such principles be enshrined in a justice system for the 21st century?\n\nCentral to the series will be a discussion of the principles and practice on which the effective operation of the justice system rests, and why these principles matter: for instance, the right to a fair hearing, and the rule against bias. It will explore the damage done when these principles are neglected and the reasons why such failures take place. Such damage is often serious, including miscarriage of justice and the reputational and financial harm caused by failed trials, the costs are high.\n\nEvents in the 2020 BPP-Politeia Series:\n\nWhy Trials Collapse?
