        "text": "A special event was held to mark the opening of The Symington Building, owned by Harborough District Council, on Friday, 4 April 2014, which saw the unveiling of a plaque in the foyer of the main reception of the building by local MP Sir Edward Garnier.\n\nThe occasion was attended by Harborough District Councillors, local dignitaries, MPs, representatives from Leicestershire County Council, heritage groups, Willmott Dixon, the contractor which carried out the redevelopment, and others.\n\nThe former Victorian corset factory, in Adam and Eve Street, accommodates the Harborough District Council offices – now on just one floor of the building – county council and adult learning services, Job Centre Plus, integrated library and museum, and will soon see shops and businesses open on the ground floor.\n\nThere will also be a Registrars Office in the building providing a venue for marriage ceremonies.\n\nThe building has been named The Symington Building to reflect its history with the Symington family.\n\nCouncillor Blake Pain, leader of Harborough District Council, said: “The redevelopment of this building has been a major project for the Council, and our partners, and this event formally recognises the completion of all that hard work. As well as the improved council reception, and public areas – like the fantastic library and museum – we are ensuring value for money by reducing our running and maintenance costs, maximising the use of space, and generating revenue for public services from leased out office and retail space.”\n\nSir Edward Garnier, Harborough MP, said: “It is important to recognise and celebrate the past, but also to look forward to the future. This redeveloped building provides an excellent community hub, joining together District and County Council services, other public sector organisations, local businesses and the Harborough Museum and Library. I am proud to be associated with this district and this building, and I congratulate those from all the organisations involved who have worked so hard to make this redevelopment happen on time and on budget.”\n\nThe library and museum will be open to the public from Tuesday, 8 April 2014 and a number of community events to showcase what the building has to offer will be held over the coming weeks."
