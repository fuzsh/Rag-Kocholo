        "text": "The route to becoming an advocate on the Isle of Man needs significant reform, an external review has found.\n\nLord Edward Garnier KC has made a total of 32 recommendations to improve the island's legal services.\n\nHis review was commissioned after a report by Tynwald's Constitutional and Legal Affairs and Justice Committee.\n\nThat investigation saw the government and the Isle of Man Law Society put forward proposed reforms that Lord Garnier considered within his review.\n\nLord Garnier said he had found \"a mixed picture\" of \"things to celebrate and things I believe need changing\".\n\nThe recommendations included 12 on training and education.\n\n'Constructive criticism'\n\nThey included the scrapping of a degree requirement to train as an advocate \"so long as a robust system of legal education and training\" was in place, he said.\n\nThe industry should not be \"seen as equivalent to membership of a small exclusive club open only to those with the finances and professional connections\" and it was \"important that domestic talent is nurtured\" in a small jurisdiction, he continued.\n\nThe review also includes several recommendations relating to the Manx bar examinations, which should \"focus on the law of the Isle of Man\" with a syllabus that went into \"far more detail\".\n\nLord Garnier also calls for an advocates' Code of Conduct to be published and an overhaul of Advocate Disciplinary Tribunals.\n\nThe hearings should be publicly available and tribunal's website \"should publish information\" about sittings, he said.\n\nThe report also recommends every law firm have an improved internal complaints systems.\n\nJustice and Home Affairs Minister Jane Poole-Wilson said the report contained \"constructive criticism to help improve the unique and independent legal system on the Isle of Man\".\n\nShe said the department would publish \"a detailed plan of action no later than the end of February 2024\".\n\nThe report is due to be debated at the October sitting of Tynwald."
