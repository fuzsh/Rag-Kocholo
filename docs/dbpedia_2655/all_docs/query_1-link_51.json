With access to so many interesting roles right across the public sector, PSR is always my first port of call.​\n\nThe PSR team are always happy to answer my questions about the role, and I found the recruitment process to be straightforward. Once in contract, the time sheet process coupled with prompt payment are a huge positive but if ever there are any queries, I can easily contact the PSR helpdesk team or access the online self-service portal with any questions which are promptly resolved.​\n\nKeep up the great work PSR and I will keep returning for my next contract.​"
