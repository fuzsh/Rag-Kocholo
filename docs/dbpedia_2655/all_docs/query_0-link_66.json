        "text": "The Secret Barrister is an anonymous junior barrister practicing criminal law in England and Wales. Through a series of books and a popular blog, this enigmatic figure has shed light on the intricacies and flaws of the UK’s legal system, making complex legal issues accessible to the general public.\n\nThe Secret Barrister should not be confused with the BlackBelt Barrister.\n\nWho is The Secret Barrister ?\n\nThe identity of The Secret Barrister remains unknown to the public, but everyone loves a good mystery and a healthy whodunnit !\n\nDespite various speculations and attempts to uncover their identity, they have successfully maintained their anonymity until now. The Secret Barrister was described as a junior barrister specialising in criminal law, aged between 30 and 40, and not an Oxbridge graduate. They have also been described as a lefty lawyer.\n\nThe Secret Barrister stated on X that the question : Is Keir Starmer The Secret Barrister ? kept recurring.\n\nThere may be a clue to the identity of The Secret Barrister on The Secret Barrister website.\n\nMiss Lucie Anne Wibberley, a former secretary of the Criminal Bar Association and a member of the Society of Labour Lawyers is listed on the register at the Bar Standards Board website.\n\nIs Lucie Wibberley The Secret Barrister ??\n\nWho do you think The Secret Barrister is ? Will the Bar Standards Board reveal who they are ⬇\n\nThe Secret Barrister and a “Moron”\n\nOn the 7th August 2024 in response to a tweet by Alex Armstrong, The Secret Barrister replied publicly “You are a moron….”.\n\nIn a now deleted tweet (due to continued abusive language), I asked if this behaviour was in breach of CD5 of the Bar Standards Board Code of Conduct.\n\nCD5 You must not behave in a way which is likely to diminish the trust and confidence which the public places in you or in the profession\n\nBar Standards Board Code of Conduct\n\nThe Secret Barrister replied “Suck it up, buttercup. It’s called free speech. I understand your sort are very keen on it.“\n\nThe term moron is now widely accepted as being dated and offensive.\n\nA person affected with mild intellectual disability\n\nThe terms idiot, imbecile, moron, and their derivatives were formerly used as technical descriptors in medical, educational, and regulatory contexts. These uses were broadly rejected by the close of the 20th century and are now considered offensive.\n\nMiriam Webster definition of moron\n\n“Name calling” is also widely considered to be a form of bullying and harassment. I believe it’s also illegal !\n\nHardly the behaviour of a Barrister of England and Wales. It displays wanton arrogance and a rules don’t apply to me attitude.\n\nThe Secret Barrister may have friends in high places and be an expert in law, however no one is above the law. Thanks for reminding me about free speech.\n\nThe Secret Barrister has been reported to the Bar Standards Board to investigate :-\n\nYou can also report behaviour by a barrister to us even if you were not their client.

This explanation is simply not true.\n\nThe most simplistic and accurate explanation of two tier policing is that there’s one rule for one person and another rule for another. The publicly shown bias and discrimination by the Police is manifesting itself irrespective of politics, sexuality, race or colour.\n\nThe police should and must operate independently under the law without fear or favour. The Rule of Law applies to everyone regardless of who they are. Policing in this country and around the world is by consent. There should no bias by the police or by anyone in the justice system.\n\nThe debate over two-tiered policing has significant implications for public trust in law enforcement. If the perception of biased policing persists, it can erode confidence in the police and exacerbate social divisions. On the other hand, dismissing legitimate concerns about unequal treatment can also harm community relations and hinder efforts to address systemic issues within law enforcement.\n\nTwo-tiered policing remains a contentious issue, with strong arguments on both sides. While some see it as a reflection of systemic biases within law enforcement, others view it as a necessary differentiation based on the nature of the protests or other lawlessness.\n\nRegardless of where one stands on the issue, it is crucial to continue scrutinising police practices to ensure fairness and accountability in all aspects of law enforcement.\n\nThe State of Policing Report 2022 and the Loss of Public Trust by HMICFRS said amongst other things “The public’s trust and confidence are unacceptably low. The fundamental principle of policing by consent, upon which the service is built, is at risk.”\n\nThe discussion of #TwoTierPolicing #TwoTierJustice and #TwoTierKeir along with Free Speech is very much alive on X.\n\nSir Keir Starmer stated “there is no two-tier policing” and said it is a “non-issue”.\n\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has called accusations of two-tier policing “complete nonsense”.\n\nThey are hardly going to agree that there is Two Tier Policing ?!

It is a concept rooted in the belief that the authority of the police derives from the consent and cooperation of the public they serve, as opposed to the power of the state.\n\nIt does not mean the consent of an individual. No individual can chose to withdraw their consent from the police, or from a law.\n\nBritish policing is based on consent, meaning the ability of the police to carry out their functions rests on ‘public approval of their existence, actions and behaviour’\n\nPolice accountability – Institute for Government\n\nThe nine principles of policing by consent, often referred to as the Peelian principles, were articulated by Sir Robert Peel.\n\nThere is no evidence that these principles were devised by Sir Robert Peel and it more than likely that they were devised by the first Commissioners of Police of the Metropolis (Sir Charles Rowan and Sir Richard Mayne).\n\nWhat are the Peelian Principles ?\n\nTo prevent crime and disorder, as an alternative to their repression by military force and severity of legal punishment.\n\nTo recognise always that the power of the police to fulfil their functions and duties is dependent on public approval of their existence, actions and behaviour and on their ability to secure and maintain public respect.\n\nTo recognise always that to secure and maintain the respect and approval of the public means also the securing of the willing co-operation of the public in the task of securing observance of laws.\n\nTo recognise always that the extent to which the co-operation of the public can be secured diminishes proportionately the necessity of the use of physical force and compulsion for achieving police objectives.\n\nTo seek and preserve public favour, not by pandering to public opinion; but by constantly demonstrating absolutely impartial service to law, in complete independence of policy, and without regard to the justice or injustice of the substance of individual laws, by ready offering of individual service and friendship to all members of the public without regard to their wealth or social standing, by ready exercise of courtesy and friendly good humour; and by ready offering of individual sacrifice in protecting and preserving life.\n\nTo use physical force only when the exercise of persuasion, advice and warning is found to be insufficient to obtain public co-operation to an extent necessary to secure observance of law or to restore order, and to use only the minimum degree of physical force which is necessary on any particular occasion for achieving a police objective.\n\nTo maintain at all times a relationship with the public that gives reality to the historic tradition that the police are the public and that the public are the police, the police being only members of the public who are paid to give full time attention to duties which are incumbent on every citizen in the interests of community welfare and existence.\n\nTo recognise always the need for strict adherence to police-executive functions, and to refrain from even seeming to usurp the powers of the judiciary of avenging individuals or the State, and of authoritatively judging guilt and punishing the guilty.\n\nTo recognise always that the test of police efficiency is the absence of crime and disorder, and not the visible evidence of police action in dealing with them.\n\nSince 1829 these ‘General Instructions’ have been issued to every new police officer.\n\nHistory of Policing by Consent\n\nThe origins of policing by consent can be traced back to the early 19th century in England. Prior to this period, law enforcement was often characterised by a lack of professionalism, corruption, and arbitrary use of power.\n\nIn 1829, Sir Robert Peel introduced the Metropolitan Police Act, which established the Metropolitan Police in London. This act marked a significant shift in policing philosophy, emphasising the idea of police as a civilian force serving the community rather than a military presence.\n\nTo implement his vision, Sir Robert Peel appointed Sir Charles Rowan and Sir Richard Mayne as the first Commissioners of the Metropolitan Police. Rowan and Mayne were instrumental in establishing a professional police force based on Peel’s principles. They implemented rigorous recruitment standards, emphasised training and discipline, and ensured that the police operated under public scrutiny and consent.\n\nUnder the leadership of Rowan and Mayne, the Metropolitan Police successfully transformed the concept of policing in London. Their commitment to upholding the principles of policing by consent set a precedent that would influence police forces worldwide.\n\nSir Robert Peel\n\nSir Robert Peel (1788-1850) was a British statesman and is widely regarded as the founder of modern policing. Born in Bury, Lancashire, England, Peel had a distinguished political career and served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom twice, from 1834 to 1835 and from 1841 to 1846.\n\nPeel is most renowned for his significant contributions to law enforcement and criminal justice reforms.\n\nPeel’s reforms also included the establishment of the first detective force, the improvement of police training and professionalism, and the standardisation of police uniforms and equipment. His contributions to policing set the stage for the development of professional law enforcement agencies that focus on crime prevention, community engagement, and the protection of individual rights.\n\nBeyond his work in law enforcement, Peel made other significant contributions to British politics. He was instrumental in the repeal of the Corn Laws, which were tariffs on imported grain that had protected British agriculture but contributed to high food prices for consumers. The repeal of these laws had a profound impact on British trade and economic development.\n\nSir Robert Peel’s legacy as a statesman and reformer, particularly in the field of policing, remains influential to this day. His principles continue to shape the foundations of modern law enforcement, emphasising the importance of community consent, accountability, and professionalism in the maintenance of public safety and order.\n\nSir Charles Rowan and Sir Richard Mayne\n\nSir Charles Rowan and Sir Richard Mayne were two key figures who played significant roles in the establishment and development of the Metropolitan Police in London, working closely with Sir Robert Peel. They were the first Commissioners of the Metropolitan Police, serving under Peel’s leadership and implementing his vision of professional policing.\n\nSir Charles Rowan (1782-1852) was a British soldier and police administrator. He was appointed as one of the two Commissioners of the Metropolitan Police when it was first established in 1829. Rowan brought his military experience and organisational skills to the role, contributing to the professionalisation and efficiency of the police force. He worked closely with Peel to implement reforms and ensure that the principles of policing by consent were upheld. Rowan’s emphasis on discipline, training, and strategic deployment of police resources helped shape the early foundations of the Metropolitan Police.\n\nSir Richard Mayne (1796-1868) was a British lawyer and civil servant. He also served as one of the original Commissioners of the Metropolitan Police alongside Rowan. Mayne, known for his administrative abilities, played a crucial role in developing the infrastructure and operations of the police force. He focused on establishing clear guidelines, procedures, and protocols for police officers, ensuring that they operated within the framework of the law and maintained public trust. Mayne’s contributions helped to solidify the principles of accountability, impartiality, and transparency within the Metropolitan Police.\n\nRowan and Mayne worked collaboratively to shape the structure and functioning of the Metropolitan Police. They were responsible for recruiting and training officers, establishing a hierarchical command structure, and implementing policies that aligned with Peel’s principles.\n\nTheir efforts were instrumental in the successful establishment of a professional and civilian police force in London, setting a standard for policing practices that influenced law enforcement agencies both in the United Kingdom and internationally.\n\nPolicing by Consent around the World\n\nHere are some examples of how the Peelian principles of policing by consent have influenced policing globally:-\n\nThe principles of policing by consent have had a profound influence on law enforcement practices in the United States. Many police departments strive to build positive relationships with the communities they serve, engaging in community-oriented policing initiatives, implementing transparency measures, and emphasising de-escalation techniques. The principles have also informed the development of professional standards and training programs for officers.\n\nAustralian police forces have embraced the Peelian principles as a foundation for their operations. Community engagement, collaboration, and accountability are emphasised in Australian policing, with efforts made to build trust and partnerships with the diverse communities across the country. The principles have guided the development of community policing programs and the adoption of ethical standards.\n\nPolicing in Canada is influenced by the Peelian principles, particularly in terms of community engagement and accountability. Canadian police agencies have adopted community policing strategies, emphasising the importance of building relationships, problem-solving, and preventative measures. The principles also guide the training and professional conduct of Canadian police officers.\n\nThe Peelian principles have shaped the philosophy of policing in New Zealand. The New Zealand Police explicitly incorporate the principles into their values and code of conduct. The focus on community engagement, proactive policing, and respect for human rights aligns with the Peelian principles. New Zealand Police have also emphasised the importance of building trust and legitimacy through transparency and accountability.\n\nPolicing in various European countries has been influenced by the Peelian principles. Concepts such as community policing, the protection of individual rights, and the need for police legitimacy are prevalent across European police forces. Efforts are made to establish partnerships with communities, promote equality and impartiality, and maintain transparency in police operations.\n\nIt’s important to note that while the Peelian principles have had a broad impact on policing worldwide, the specific application and implementation may vary across different countries, taking into account local laws and cultures.\n\nNonetheless, the principles continue to shape the ongoing development of modern policing, emphasising the importance of maintaining public trust and collaboration with the communities they serve.\n\nWe recommend you should always seek formal legal advice if required, from a qualified and reputable lawyer (solicitor or barrister).\n\nWe have a number of links to Free Legal Resources and Legal Organisations on our Free Legal Advice , Legal Aid and Pro Bono pages.\n\nCheck out our related articles on Rule of Law, Open Justice, Innocent until Proven Guilty, What is Two Tier Policing, R v Sussex Justices and the highly questionable Sussex Family Justice Board.\n\nRead the reviews of Junior Sussex Barrister Gavin Howe and Legal 500 Junior Barrister Eleanor Battie\n\n“He is awful, underhanded and should not be practising law!”\n\n“She is a one-woman legal A Team”\n\nLatest Articles\n\nThe Secret Barrister\n\nThe Secret Barrister is an anonymous junior barrister practicing criminal law in England and Wales.

It… Read more: Rule of Law\n\nAll articles can be found in our Sitemap\n\nThe rule of law is a fundamental principle of democratic societies that underpins the concept of justice and fairness.\n\nIt refers to the idea that all individuals and institutions are subject to the same set of laws and procedures, regardless of their position or status.\n\nThis means that the law should be applied equally to everyone, without discrimination, and that no one should be above the law.\n\nOrigins of the Rule of Law\n\nThe origins of the rule of law can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as Greece and Rome, where it was seen as a key component of a just and stable society.\n\nIn ancient Greece, the philosopher Aristotle wrote about the importance of the rule of law in preventing the abuse of power and promoting the common good.\n\nSimilarly, in ancient Rome, the idea of the rule of law was embodied in the concept of “equal protection under the law,” which was enshrined in the Roman legal system.\n\nIn more recent times, the rule of law has been a central tenet of modern democratic societies.\n\nIt was first articulated as a formal principle during the Enlightenment, when thinkers such as Hobbes, Locke, Montesquieu, and Rousseau argued that the power of the state should be limited by law, and that citizens should have certain rights and freedoms that were protected by the law.\n\nImportance of the Rule of Law\n\nThe rule of law is important for several reasons. First and foremost, it helps to ensure that everyone is treated fairly and equally under the law. This means that no one can be arbitrarily deprived of their rights or subjected to unfair treatment by those in positions of power.\n\nSecondly, the rule of law is crucial for maintaining social order and stability. When people believe that the law is just and that it is being applied fairly, they are more likely to respect it and to comply with it voluntarily. This helps to prevent social unrest and disorder, and ensures that conflicts are resolved through peaceful means.\n\nThirdly, the rule of law is essential for protecting individual freedoms and rights. By providing a framework of laws and procedures that are designed to protect individual rights, such as freedom of speech, assembly, and religion, the rule of law helps to prevent abuses of power and ensures that people are able to live their lives in accordance with their own values and beliefs.\n\nThe Rule of Law in the UK\n\nThe rule of law is a fundamental principle of the UK’s constitutional system. It is enshrined in a number of key legal documents, including the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights 1689, and the Human Rights Act 1998.\n\nIn practice, the rule of law is upheld by the judiciary, which is independent of the government and other branches of the state. The courts are responsible for interpreting and applying the law, and for ensuring that the government and other public bodies act in accordance with the law.\n\nThe rule of law is also central to the UK’s relationship with the European Union. As a member of the EU, the UK was bound by EU law and subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.\n\nThis helped to ensure that the UK government and other public bodies acted in accordance with EU law and that citizens were able to enforce their rights under EU law.\n\nThe Rule of Law around the World\n\nThe rule of law is also an important principle in the international arena. It is enshrined in the United Nations Charter and in a number of other international agreements and treaties.\n\nOne of the key functions of international law is to promote the rule of law in relations between states, by providing a framework for the peaceful resolution of disputes and the protection of human rights. International law also helps to promote cooperation and collaboration between states, by setting out common standards and norms for behaviour.\n\nHowever, the rule of law is not always respected in the international arena. In some parts of the world, governments and other institutions may be corrupt or lack the capacity to enforce the law effectively. This can lead to human rights abuses, social unrest, and conflict.\n\nIn addition, there are concerns about the erosion of the rule of law in some countries, as governments may seek to restrict the rights and freedoms of their citizens in the name of national security or other interests.\n\nThe Importance of Upholding the Rule of Law\n\nThe rule of law is a fundamental principle of democratic societies, and its importance cannot be overstated. When the rule of law is respected, it helps to ensure that all individuals and institutions are held accountable, and that everyone is treated fairly and equally under the law.\n\nThe rule of law is also essential for maintaining social order and stability, protecting individual freedoms and rights, and promoting cooperation and collaboration between states.\n\nIn order to uphold the rule of law, it is essential that governments and other institutions act in accordance with the law, and that the judiciary is independent and impartial. It is also important for citizens to be informed about their rights and responsibilities under the law, and to be able to enforce those rights through the courts if necessary.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe rule of law is a fundamental principle of democratic societies, and its importance cannot be overstated. It helps to ensure that all individuals and institutions are held accountable, and that everyone is treated fairly and equally under the law.\n\nIn the UK, the rule of law is enshrined an unwritten constitution made up of various sources, including statutes, case law, and conventions which is upheld by an independent judiciary. The principle of the rule of law is an important aspect of the UK’s constitutional framework.\n\nThe UK’s longstanding commitment to the Rule of Law is under grave threat according to the landmark report The State We’re In: Addressing Threats & Challenges to the Rule of Law written by the legal charity JUSTICE.\n\nIn the world, the rule of law is an important principle in international relations, and is enshrined in a number of international agreements and treaties. However, there are concerns about the erosion of the rule of law in some countries, and the need to promote and protect the rule of law globally.\n\nUltimately, the rule of law is essential for promoting justice, fairness, and equality in societies around the world, and for ensuring that human rights and freedoms are protected and respected.\n\nCheck out our related articles on Innocent until Proven Guilty, Open Justice, Policing by Consent, What is Two Tier Policing, Innocent until Proven Guilty, R v Sussex Justices and the highly questionable Sussex Family Justice Board.\n\nRead the reviews of Junior Sussex Barrister Gavin Howe and Legal 500 Junior Barrister Eleanor Battie\n\n“He is awful, underhanded and should not be practising law!”\n\n“She is a one-woman legal A Team”\n\nLatest Articles\n\nThe Secret Barrister\n\nThe Secret Barrister is an anonymous junior barrister practicing criminal law in England and Wales.

The principle is that an individual is considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. It is also known as “The presumption of innocence”.\n\nThis principle is enshrined in the Human Rights Act 1998 and the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nWhat is the concept of innocent until proven guilty ?\n\nThe concept of innocent until proven guilty dates back to ancient Roman law. It is a cornerstone of the justice system in many countries around the world. The principle is based on the idea that an individual is presumed innocent until the prosecution proves otherwise. This principle is essential because it protects the rights of the accused and ensures that justice is served.\n\nThe Human Rights Act 1998\n\nThe Human Rights Act 1998 is a piece of legislation in the United Kingdom that incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law. The act is intended to protect the rights and freedoms of individuals in the UK. One of the most important rights protected by the Human Rights Act 1998 is the right to a fair trial.\n\nThe right to a fair trial includes the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. This means that the prosecution must prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. The right to a fair trial also includes the right to legal representation, the right to examine witnesses, and the right to a public trial.\n\n(1) In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interest of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice.\n\n(2) Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.\n\n(3) Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n\n(a)to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him;\n\n(b)to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence;\n\n(c)to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require;\n\n(d)to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him;\n\n(e)to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court.\n\nRight to a Fair Trial Article 6 Human Rights Act 1998\n\nThe United Nations Declaration of Human Rights\n\nThe United Nations Declaration of Human Rights is a document adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. The declaration sets out a range of fundamental human rights that should be protected around the world. The declaration includes the right to a fair trial.\n\nArticle 11 of the declaration states that “Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defence.” This article emphasizes the importance of the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial.\n\nTrial by media\n\nThe issue of trial by media has become increasingly prevalent in recent years. Trial by media refers to the situation where an individual is tried and convicted in the court of public opinion before they have had a chance to defend themselves in a court of law. This situation is often exacerbated by sensationalist media coverage and the use of social media.\n\nTrial by media can have a significant impact on the accused, including damage to their reputation and public humiliation. In some cases, trial by media can even lead to the denial of a fair trial.\n\nExamples of trial by media\n\nOne example of trial by media occurred in the case of Amanda Knox, an American student who was accused of murdering her roommate in Italy in 2007. The case received extensive media coverage, with many media outlets portraying Knox as guilty before the trial even began. Knox was eventually acquitted, but the media coverage had a significant impact on her reputation.\n\nAnother example of trial by media occurred in the case of Barry George, who was accused of murdering British television presenter Jill Dando in 1999. The media coverage of the case was highly sensationalised, and George was portrayed as guilty before the trial even began. George was eventually acquitted, but the media coverage had a lasting impact on his reputation.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the principle of innocent until proven guilty is a fundamental aspect of the justice system in many countries around the world. It is essential to protect the rights of the accused and ensure that justice is served.\n\nThe issue of trial by media must be addressed to ensure that individuals are not unfairly tried and convicted in the court of public opinion. The media has a responsibility to report fairly and objectively on legal proceedings, and individuals have the right to a fair trial, including the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.\n\nWe recommend you should always seek formal legal advice if required, from a qualified and reputable lawyer (solicitor or barrister).\n\nWe have a number of links to Free Legal Resources and Legal Organisations on our Free Legal Advice , Legal Aid and Pro Bono pages.\n\nCheck out our related articles on Rule of Law, Open Justice, Policing by Consent, What is Two Tier Policing, R v Sussex Justices and the highly questionable Sussex Family Justice Board.\n\nRead the reviews of Junior Sussex Barrister Gavin Howe and Legal 500 Junior Barrister Eleanor Battie\n\n“He is awful, underhanded and should not be practising law!”\n\n“She is a one-woman legal A Team”\n\nLatest Articles\n\nThe Secret Barrister\n\nThe Secret Barrister is an anonymous junior barrister practicing criminal law in England and Wales.

He finds that the JCIO is part of the MoJ which is a public authority for the purposes of FOIA. By failing to confirm whether it held the requested information within 20 working days, the MoJ has breached sections 1(1)(a) and 10(1) of FOIA.’\n\nJudicial Conduct Investigations Office must comply with FoI requests\n\nRules and Regulations\n\nThe 2014 Judicial Discipline Regulations and supporting rules came into effect from 18 August 2014\n\nThe Judicial Discipline (Prescribed Procedures) Regulations 2014\n\nJudicial Conduct (Magistrates) Rules 2014\n\nJudicial Conduct (Judicial) Rules 2014\n\nJudicial Conduct (Tribunals) Rules 2014\n\nJudicial Conduct (Tribunals) (Amendment of Offices) Rules 2017\n\nSupplementary Guidance – The Judicial Conduct (Judicial and other office holders) Rules 2014\n\nSupplementary Guidance – The Judicial Conduct (Magistrates) Rules 2014\n\nSupplementary Guidance – The Judicial Conduct (Tribunals) Rules 2014\n\nEmployment Tribunal (Scotland) – Making a complaint of Judicial Misconduct about an Employment Judge\n\nHow to Complain\n\nThe Judicial Conduct Investigations Office can only deal with complaints about the personal conduct of judicial office holders. This means that they cannot accept complaints about a judge’s decision or the way a judge has managed a case.\n\nThe JCIO Making A Complaint website contains all the details along with the link to the JCIO portal.\n\nOffice for Judicial Complaints (OJC) – 2004\n\nBefore the establishment of the JCIO, the responsibility for investigating complaints against judges rested with the Office for Judicial Complaints (OJC), which was established in 2004. The OJC was a part of the Ministry of Justice and had the power to investigate complaints made against judges in England and Wales.\n\nHowever, the OJC was widely criticized for being insufficiently independent and for lacking transparency. In response to these criticisms, the government established the JCIO in 2006 as an independent body to investigate complaints against judges.\n\nJudicial Complaints Investigation Bureau (JCIB) -1991\n\nBefore the Office for Judicial Complaints (OJC) was established in 2004, the responsibility for investigating complaints against judges in England and Wales rested with the Judicial Complaints Investigation Bureau (JCIB), which was created in 1991.\n\nThe JCIB was a division of the Lord Chancellor’s Department (which later became the Ministry of Justice), and it was responsible for investigating complaints about the personal conduct of judges. However, the JCIB was criticized for being insufficiently independent and for lacking transparency, particularly following a high-profile case in 1993 involving a judge who was found to have used racist language.\n\nJCIO Powers\n\nThe JCIO is responsible for investigating complaints about the personal conduct of judges, as well as their professional conduct. It has the power to investigate complaints made by members of the public, legal professionals, and other judges.\n\nThe JCIO’s investigations are carried out by a team of investigators who are independent of the judiciary.\n\nOverall, the establishment of the JCIO was seen as an important step in ensuring the independence and integrity of the judiciary in England and Wales.\n\nDisciplinary Statements\n\nYou can check if a a judge has had any disciplinary action against them as Disciplinary statements are published on the JCIO website and are sorted by year.\n\nThe JCIO publication policy states that a statement will normally be published when a disciplinary sanction has been issued to a judicial office-holder for misconduct.\n\nThe Lady Chief Justice and Lord Chancellor may decide jointly to:\n\nissue a statement in any case;\n\ndecline to issue a statement in any case;\n\ndelete a statement prior to the expiration of the relevant publication period.\n\nPublication Periods\n\nStatements published before 22 August 2022\n\nStatements about cases which resulted in a sanction below removal from office will be deleted after one year.

Passing the BPC is a prerequisite for the final stage of training called pupillage.\n\nEssential Skills\n\nBarristers need a diverse skill set:\n\nCommunication: Ability to interact with various people effectively.\n\nAnalytical Thinking: Logical approach to problem-solving.\n\nAdvocacy: Representing clients’ interests persuasively in court.\n\nAttention to Detail: Crucial for legal research and case preparation.\n\nTime Management: Juggling multiple cases efficiently.\n\nCommercial Awareness: Understanding business and industry contexts.\n\nIn summary, barristers are legal advocates who specialise in court representation and provide vital legal advice.
