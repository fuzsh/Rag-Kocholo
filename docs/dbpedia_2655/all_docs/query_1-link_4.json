The incumbent is a member of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom. Since the office's inception, the incumbent has concurrently been appointed Lord Chancellor.\n\nThe officeholder works alongside the other justice ministers. The corresponding shadow minister is the shadow secretary of state for justice, and the performance of the secretary of state is also scrutinised by the Justice Select Committee.[3]\n\nAccording to what is generally known as a justice minister in many other countries, the justice secretary's remit includes:\n\nHis Majesty's Prison Service in England and Wales\n\nMatters of probation\n\nThe UK’s relations with the governments of the Crown Dependencies (Guernsey, Jersey, and the Isle of Man)\n\nThe then Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, was appointed to the post of Secretary of State for Justice when it was created in 2007. The office of the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs was abolished, along with the Department for Constitutional Affairs. The home secretary, John Reid, told Parliament that future secretaries of state for justice would be MPs rather than peers.\n\nFor Lord Chancellors before 2003, see List of Lord Chancellors and Lord Keepers. For Secretaries of State between 2003 and 2007, see Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs.\n\nSecretary of State Term of office Political party Government Charles Falconer,\n\nBaron Falconer of Thoroton[4] 9 May 2007 28 June 2007 Labour Blair\n\n(III) Jack Straw[n 1][5]\n\nMP for Blackburn 28 June 2007 6 May 2010 Brown Kenneth Clarke[6]\n\nMP for Rushcliffe 12 May 2010 6 September 2012 Conservative Cameron-Clegg\n\n(Coalition) Chris Grayling[7]\n\nMP for Epsom and Ewell 6 September 2012 8 May 2015 Michael Gove[8]\n\nMP for Surrey Heath 8 May 2015 14 July 2016 Cameron\n\n(II) Liz Truss[9]\n\nMP for South West Norfolk 14 July 2016 11 June 2017 May\n\n(I) David Lidington[10][11]\n\nMP for Aylesbury 11 June 2017 8 January 2018 May\n\n(II) David Gauke[12]\n\nMP for South West Hertfordshire 8 January 2018 24 July 2019 Robert Buckland[13]\n\nMP for South Swindon 24 July 2019 15 September 2021 Johnson\n\n(I) Johnson\n\n(II) Dominic Raab[14]\n\nMP for Esher and Walton 15 September 2021 6 September 2022 Brandon Lewis\n\nMP for Great Yarmouth 6 September 2022 25 October 2022 Truss Dominic Raab\n\nMP for Esher and Walton 25 October 2022 21 April 2023 Sunak Alex Chalk\n\nMP for Cheltenham 21 April 2023 5 July 2024 Shabana Mahmood\n\nMP for Birmingham Ladywood 5 July 2024 Incumbent Labour Starmer\n\nConstitutional Reform Act 2005\n\nLord Chancellor"
