Lord Garnier

Kings's Counsel at 4 Pump Court

Edward Garnier KC is a highly experienced silk in England & Wales and Northern Ireland.

His practice includes corporate advisory and financial services work, corporate crime and international human rights as well as defamation, privacy, confidence, malicious falsehood, contempt and related media law cases. His extensive experience in practice is underpinned by a parallel career in politics and as one of the Government’s two Law Officers: he served as an MP from 1992 until 2017 and was HM Solicitor General from 2010 to 2012. He is now in the House of Lords.

When in Government as Solicitor General, he developed and introduced into this jurisdiction from the United States the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, a means of dealing with companies who admit their offending to supplement prosecutions against individuals suspected of economic crime. He appeared for the Serious Fraud Office in two of the DPAs so far approved by the Court, the first one, Standard Bank, in 2014, and the then-largest, Rolls-Royce, in 2017. In 2020-21 he led the legal team acting for two respondent companies in the 11th and 12th DPAs to be approved by the Court.

In the media law sphere, Edward acts for individual and corporate claimants, both within England & Wales and Northern Ireland and abroad, and for individual defendants and corporate defendants from the publishing, internet and broadcasting world.

Lord Garnier will be joining us for Dinner at at Innholders Hall on Friday to speak to us about Sanctions in the International Arena.

Margarida Bonito

Director of MBC

Margarida is a former lawyer who felt lost at some point in 2012 with the profession’s day-to-day reality, so made the decision to start again.

After a while trying to find the right track, it wasn’t until she started studying coaching that she realised that it was not just an amazing tool but a crucial skill set the university didn’t provide and certainly would have positively impacted the beginning of her career.

As a coach, she had the privilege to work with a wide range of businesses, but Margarida is specially found of help young lawyers. In early 2021 Margarida decided to deliver this skill set to Portuguese young lawyers through a Podcast called «Artigo Zero».

Later that year Margarida released an E-book with helpful tips on how to take the first career steps.

In the same year, Margarida delivered workshops to the European Law Students Association (ELSA), about time management and the first steps after graduation Margarida has also been delivering workshops to a few regional branches of the Portuguese Lawyer Bar Association.

Last year, Margarida started a networking group and she will be speaking to us about Marketing and Personal Branding – Your Differentiation Strategy.
