        "text": "On most TVs, Netflix will always show a resolution label, and if high definition is an option, it'll also show a label for the high-definition system the title will use to play on the TV.\n\nOn some TVs and other devices, you'll see only one video quality label even if more than one applies. If the title and device support high dynamic range, the label will show that one. For example, if a title plays in 4K and also supports Dolby Vision on a device, only the Dolby Vision label will show.\n\nSo look for 4K and HD labels to check resolution, and Dolby Vision and HDR labels to check high dynamic range. In step 5 below are titles to use to check each.\n\nTo get the best quality available for your plan, all the devices you're using have to support it. If youâ€™re on the Premium plan and trying to watch on a TV with a streaming stick and an audio receiver, then all three devices have to support 4K to watch in 4K or HDR to watch in HDR.\n\nYou should also check that all devices are running the latest software or firmware and that their video resolution settings are equal to or greater than the quality you're aiming for.\n\nYour video cables and the ports they're plugged into must also support your plan's quality. For the Premium plan, you need to use Premium High Speed HDMI or Ultra High Speed HDMI cables. (Not sure what type of cable you have? It's often printed on the cable or the cable ends.)\n\nFor 4K or HDR, make sure that devices and cables are plugged into an HDMI port that supports HDCP 2.2 or later (usually the HDMI 1 port).\n\nIf a device or cable in your setup doesn't meet all requirements for a particular quality, Netflix will play at the highest quality available for that device, port, or cable.\n\nTVs and TV streaming devices\n\nHDR can be turned on or off in the Netflix app on HDR-capable devices:"
