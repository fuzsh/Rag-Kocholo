        "text": "Everyone can use Notion AI for free, so you can test its capabilities before purchasing the add-on subscription. The number of complimentary AI responses increases with the more members you have, and is shared among the entire workspace.\n\nOnce you've used all your complimentary AI responses, you will see a message that a Notion AI add-on subscription is necessary to continue using AI features. You’ll need to be a workspace owner, and on desktop, to add Notion AI to your plan.\n\nThe Notion AI Writing Suite will not use your data to train our models unless you opt in to a request to share your data. Any information used to power Notion AI will be shared with our partners for the sole purpose of providing you with the Notion AI features.\n\nNotion AI can only be purchased for the entire workspace. Currently, there isn’t an option to provision AI access to only a portion of your workspace.\n\nIf you do decide to add AI to your workspace, every member in the workspace will be able to use AI features — this includes workspace owners, membership admins, and members. Guests will not be able to use AI features in your workspace.\n\nYou’ll receive an invoice for these charges on your selected payment method on the day of the month you initially signed up for your subscription.\n\nFor every member you delete, you’ll be issued credit based on the time they’ve spent in your workspace and your current subscription’s rate. This credit will automatically be applied to your next invoice.\n\nWorkspace admins can access, view, and download your workspace's invoices by going to Settings & members → Billing, then scrolling to Invoices. There you can click on \"View invoice\" to see the invoice PDF.\n\nIf you’re using a Free Plan workspace by yourself, you’ll be able to add as many pages and blocks as you like.\n\nIf you’re using a Free Plan workspace with multiple members, you’ll be able to add a limited number of blocks before you have to upgrade.\n\nWhen you reach the limit, you can still read, edit, and organize existing content blocks as usual, but you won’t be able to add new content blocks.\n\nA block is any single piece of content you add to your page, like a paragraph of text, a to-do item, an image, a code block, an embedded file, etc. Think of your page as being made up of these building blocks.\n\nThe Plus Plan (with a 1-member limit) is free for students and educators. Compared to the Free Plan, you’ll be able to add more guests, have access to more version history, and upload larger files.\n\nGuests are free of charge – but they can only access individual pages they are invited to. In other words, guests won’t be able to see all the team pages under the Teamspaces section in the left sidebar.\n\nWorkspace analytics (Enterprise Plan): Includes everything above as well as user level analytics, analytics on all pages in your workspace, and search analytics for content in your workspace.\n\nWhether you're on a monthly or yearly billing schedule, your account may be charged on a monthly basis if you make these types of changes. If you added members, your account will be charged a prorated amount based on the percentage of the billing cycle left at the time each member was added. If you removed members, your account will be credited in the same way.\n\nYour Notion subscription, annual or monthly, will automatically renew until you cancel it. You can cancel your subscription by going to \"Settings & members\" in the left-hand sidebar on a desktop computer, then selecting \"Billing,\" then \"Change plan.\" After you cancel, you’ll still have access to all the paid features until the end of your billing cycle.\n\nYour account email will be notified after each failed payment. Payments may be retried up to 8 times within the next month.\n\nAfter this, if the payment did not succeed, your workspace will get restricted to view-only for a period of time before being downgraded to the Free plan.\n\nOur refund policy is simple. If you believe you've made a mistake signing up for a paid Notion subscription online or in-app, please contact us inside the app or email team@makenotion.com. We'll be happy to refund you the full amount (not pro-rated) if you downgrade your subscription within 72 hours of signing up for monthly billing, or within 30 days of signing up for annual billing.\n\nIf you were invoiced for members accidentally added to your workspace, we're happy to provide a refund of the prorated charges if you reach out within 72 hours of the invoice date (please make sure the additional members have been removed from your workspace when writing in).\n\nAnd if for any reason you're unhappy with Notion, please let us know at team@makenotion.com — we'd love to hear your feedback, and will be happy to work with you to create the best experience possible.\n\nIf you live in the European Union, United Kingdom, or another region with a mandatory refund policy, you may be eligible for a monthly subscription refund past 72 hours. For example, customers in the European Union can receive a full refund for a monthly subscription within 14 days of purchase, rather than 72 hours.\n\nTo request a refund, please contact us inside the app or email team@makenotion.com. If you live in a region with a mandatory refund policy, please let us know and we'll be happy to assist you."
