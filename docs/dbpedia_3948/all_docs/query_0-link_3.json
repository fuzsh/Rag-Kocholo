D.C. • TELEPHONE STERLING 3-1755 • VOL. 11: No. 1 NOT REMOVE RTB LIBRARY^ ImJ^A with Electronics 1/ Reports MARTIN CO DEL’S AUTHORITATIVE NEWS SERVICE FOR MANAGEMENT OF THE VISUAL BROADCASTING AND ALLIED ELECTRONICS ARTS AND INDUSTRY 3 * ^95® Sl/MMARr- INDEX OF THE WEEK'S NEWS -^January I, 1955 34,000,000 TV SETS NOW, and there's another great year ahead, with production & sales expected at 6-7,000,- 000, & more than $1 billion telecasting business (p. 1). DuMONT CURTAILS TO \"MAIN LINE\" NETWORK, reducing AT&T interconnections, cutting back staff, banking on emergence of more stations for full-scale revival (p. 3). AMs ADD UP TO 2782 AT YEAR'S END, 138 more author- ized during 1954; new AM-FM Directory also shows 583 FM grantees, down from last year's 602 (p. 5). PHOENIX'S 4th VHF & PASCO UHF SATELLITE, plus limited operation of uhf KCEB, Tulsa, bring year-end total to 426 stations on air (p. 5). FIRST STATION TO HIT FULL 1000-kw is uhf WBRE-TV, Wilkes-Barre; second is WILK-TV, Wilkes-Barre, striving tor boost to megawatt on New Year's Day (p. 6). MORE UHF STATIONS SHIFTING to lower channels; Fair- banks CP granted, while Albany battle goes to hear- ing and Flint grant is challenged (p. 7). TRADE RIDING HIGH INTO 1955, with TV output near 1950 record and retail sales close to 7,000,000 in 1954; prospects for future are encouraging (p. 11). INCREASE IN IMPORTS OF RADIOS & PARTS have a lot of U. S. manufacturers uneasy about potential compe- tition from abroad; will seek tariff hike (p. 12). COLOR-EQUIPPED STATIONS increasing rapidly, all CBS- TV & NBC-TV basics carrying network feeds, many equipping themselves for local color (p. 10). NEW TV MODELS INTRODUCED by Admiral, DuMont, GE, Magnavox, Motorola, Trav-Ler, Westinghouse; Crosley cuts price of 10 \"Super V\" models (pp. 13-14). MOTOROLA SIGNS PATENT LICENSE RENEWAL as RCA settles FM suit out of court with Maj. Armstrong's widow; status of other patent cases (p. 15). NETWORK BILLINGS HIT ALL-TIME HIGH in Nov., accord- ing to PIB, which shows ABC, CBS & NBC set TV sales marks; 1954 billings to reach $320,000,000 (p. 16). YOU CAN EXPECT ANOTHER GREAT TV YEAR: TV enters its 9th year — dating its commer- cial beginnings from the 16 stations on the air in 1947 and mere trickle of 178,571 receiving sets produced that year — with some 34,000,000 sets in the ^ands of the American public. That's about 7,000,000 more than a year ago, and the prospect is that another 6-7,000,000 will be made and sold in 1955. The New Year starts with 426 stations on the air and several dozen more being built, up 101 from year ago, with probability that 50-75 more will start in 1955. Telecasting has ended a $900,000,000 advertising year — and there's good reason to expect the 1955 figure will go well over $1 billion for time, talent and all other costs-, thus representing more than 10% of the national advertising budget. TV receivers, parts & service accounted for something like $2 billion of the gross national product in the year just ended, should do as well or better in 1955, depending on consumer demand and the price structure. Product of whole electronics industry, of which TV is the keystone, is variously estimated up to $10 billion. * * There you have a quick glimpse of the fabulous TV industry in general. But what about particular aspects? What's in store for 1955? Here are summaries of the best thinking of Television Digest's editorial staff on major trends & developments as we launch 11th volLime in 10th year since publication of Vol. 1;1 on Sept. 1, 1945: Telecasting : 101 stations went on the air in the U.S. in 1954 (25 of them uhf), latest being satellite in Pasco, Wash, (see p. 5). There are currently 179 CPs outstanding, and it's our guess that more than half of these will never be built — unless uhf fortLines take a turn for the better. There are 175 new-station appli- cations pending. It will be surprising if new starters in 1955 total as many as 100. Incidentally, Canada now has 24 stations, 15 of which started in 1954, and will very likely add this year the 7 holding CPs and possibly a handful more. Film ; More live network shows are preparing to switch to film, though it's noteworthy that of ARB's \"Top 10\" for Dec. (p. 9) only 4 were filmed. Biggest film COPYRIGHT 1955 BY RADIO NEWS BUREAU - 2 - news in 1955 will be wide-scale increase in top shows syndicated to topnotch stations for placement in prime hours — the first emergence of long-heralded \"film networks.\" Even DuMont Network may turn to teletranscription mainly (see p. 3). The trend is toward consolidations among top producers & syndicators, making for group of select \"majors\" as in the motion picture industry. Good feature films will command big prices, leading movie majors to re-examine their policy of withholding backlogs from TV. Relaxation of major producers' stiff-backed opposition to release of old films may be triggered not only by high prices but by fact that imminence of color reduces value of oldies; that General Teleradio's \"Million Dollar Movie\" package, bought from Bank of America, is clicking around country; that Walt Disney is releasing his features on his ABC-TV Disneyland show; that Republic has released a batch of 27 high-budget films made in the '40s. Video tape recording will emerge from the lab in 1955, but practical use of it will be limited to on-the-job field-testing by NBC. * * ♦ UHF ; 1954 was a tough year, 51 outlets having quit operating, all of them for economic reasons. Three resumed operation, but year ended with fewer uhf on the air (121) than when it began despite fact 25 started. Uhf woes won't end in 1955 and there will be more mortalities, but a fevr more established stations in good markets should turn the profit corner. Great boost to uhf will come from big-interest oper- ations like Storer ' s in Portland, Ore. & Miami, CBS ' s in Milwaukee, NBC's in 2 as yet tuidisclosed cities. Some uhf may switch to satellite or quasi-satellite operation. Some well-heeled operators will go to maximum 1000-kw power, j Uhf operators will con- tinue to clamor for de-intermixture in selected areas, but may not get any further with FCC this year than last — albeit pressures from Congress will increase for a rejuggle of allocations to protect uhf areas from vhf or else switch uhf to vhf. UHF Receivers; Approximately 1,250,000 uhf-equipped sets were produced in 1954, about 17% of total output, compared with 1,460,000 in 1953 (20%). Together with 2,190,000 field conversions in 1953 and estimated 1,300,000 in 1954, the uhf- equipped sets now total around 6,000,000. Several new developments in uhf tuner de- sign, leading to better and cheaper tuners, can be expected in 1955, with probable reduction of price differential between vhf-only & vhf -uhf sets and resultant in- crease in \"circulation\". How great the increase is, will determine to large extent the success of uhf stations in 1955. Color ; Majority of TV homes will be within reception range of network color- casts in 1955, and a sizeable percentage of TV homes will be in range of locally- originated color, live & film. Network color originations will increase, including feeds from west coast and some \"spectacular\" remotes. Rate of set production and sales may remain disappointingly low this year, probably well under the 200,000-to- 400,000 predicted by industry leaders — barring some now-unforeseen technical and production developments making possible prices under |500. Quality and simplicity of color sets will improve steadily and significantly, with greater brightness, sta- bility, registration, resolution, contrast, etc. No important change in picture size (21 & 22-in. ) can be expected. Important developments are likely in studio equipment, possibly including emergence of the single-tube camera chain. Color film producers will start coming into their own as stations with film cameras begin to demand their product. *■ * * * Govt. Regulation (FCC) : Chairman McConnaughey, his confirmation held up in last Congress, will be renominated by President Eisenhower and confirmed by Senate after minor objections & delays. Comr. Hennock is unlikely to be reappointed, and there's good chance of another woman Democrat getting her place in June. \"Protest\" provision of Communications Act will be modified by Congress — at least, legislative wheels to that end will start rolling. FCC will have to spend a lot of time in court defending decisions in TV cases; it will win most court decisions, as in past. FCC will continue the \"free enterprise\" philosophy expressed by McConnaughey and others, with less and less actual interference with station operations. There will be some exceptions, such as inquiries into \"overcommercialization\" which will be more per- suasive than dictatorial. Effort will continue to streamline FCC procedures, cut down on paper work required of stations. 3 Govt. Regulation (Congress); Investigation fever will continue to run high despite change in control of Congress. Senate Commerce Committee under new chairman. Sen. Magnuson (D-Wash. ) , will probably continue network-uhf probe begun by Bricker (R-Ohio), but with change in emphasis because of diminished influence of' the inves- tigation's GOP counsel, ex-FCC Comr. Robert F. Jones. Some of Potter subcommittee's recommendations may be revived — cutting excise taxes on uhf-equipped sets, and an ad hoc committee to study uhf & allocation problems. Sen. Kilgore (D-W.Va.) will run into jurisdictional dispute between his Judiciary Committee's proposed TV-radio monopoly probe and Commerce Committee's inquiry — and scope of Judiciary probe will be narrowed or the 2 investigations will be \"combined\" under aegis of Commerce Com- mittee. House Commerce Committee, under new chairman Rep. Priest (D-Tenn. ) , will be more active in TV-radio matters than was its predecessor. But best bet still is that no far-reaching TV legislation will be passed during the 1955 session. ♦I ♦ I* Subscription TV: Start of rule-making on pay-as-you-look in next few weeks is virtually certain. FCC is likely to couch its proposal in exceedingly general terms, throwing whole matter open to comments, picking the industry's brains. Oral hearings are possible some time this year — but they're not likely to be nearly so protracted as were the color hearings. Commission will look to Congress for guidance on basic question — \"to pay or not to pay.\" Decision this year is improbable. Boosters & Satellites; Commission will finalize current proposal to allow 100-watt satellites, probably also start rule-making on low-power boosters. After satellite proposal is finalized, installation of satellites will be gradual — slower than many expect, because costs will be greater than many think. Microwave-Cable Facilities; FCC will liberalize conditions under which TV stations may build own microwaves, resulting in booming construction of many indi- vidual links. AT&T will offer \"utility grade\" of interconnection service for new small-station towns, at considerably lower cost than present service. Compared with past years, AT&T will extend service to relatively few new areas, having completed most of its basic network. Educational Stations; The infant educational TV took its first steps in 1954 and 10 stations went on the air, one going off ; total at year's end was 11 and at best another 15 will start ini 1955. Slowly and not-too-surely, educational TV may eventually find its niche and achieve stability — but it's still subject to the caprices of the political winds, particularly in state legislatures, which usually hold pursestrings too tightly to permit real growth. Community Antennas: They'll continue growing, but at somewhat slower rate, while potential operators keep close eye on boosters and satellites, sweating out caprices of state utilities commissions and battling excise taxes. Trade Developments; See Trade News section (pp. 11-12). DuNONT CURTAILS TO miN LINE' NETWORK: Can the DuMont Network survive the loss of its main fiscal prop, the highly profitable WDTV, Pittsburgh (Ch. 2) which has been sold to Westinghouse (Vol. 10:49) for the unprecedented svim of $9,750,000? Dr. Allen B. DuMont thinks that it can — and the explanation of this week's drastic curtailment of AT&T interconnections and severe cutbacks in staff is that it's \"merely a temporary tightening of our belts.\" Also hinted is a new \"technological development, \" unexplained but presumably having to do with teletranscriptions ; this would seem to indicate plans to expand in film fields, though it's denied there's any intention of becoming a film syndicate. Though the network has never made money despite increased billings, and has been supported largely by the 3 DuMont-owned stations (other 2 are in N.Y. and Wash- ington), its operators are still convinced there's an economic basis for a fourth national network, as in radio. This is a point of dispute along Madison Avenue's advertising row because of the high cost of telecasting time. Moreover, it requires at least 4 stations in a market to justify a competitive structure and, as of now, as DuMont director Ted Bergmann points out, only 14 of the - 4 - top 148 markets have as many as 4 stations. Worse than that, 27 markets have only 5 stations, 55 have only two, 59 have only one. 15 have none. Small-market stations, still relatively few, aren't as much. in demand by the national advertiser. As and when more stations are built, as and when uhf wins its rightful place in the TV sun, another network ought to be able to get along — and DuMont appears to be banking on just that. Whether new construction or the juggling of channel assignments by Washington brings it about, this is the cue to DuMont's thinking; \"In 1954,\" said Bergmann recently before an advertisers' convention, \"the fourth vhf station started telecasting in such important markets as Detroit, Minne- apolis and Denver, and 1955 shows promise of increased numbers of stations in cities like Boston, Pittsburgh, Toledo, St. Louis, New Orleans and many others. In addi- tion, some inadequately covered markets are now being opened up by outside stations — KOVR in Stockton, Cal., for example, is covering the San Francisco area, and plans are afoot to cover Pittsburgh from Steubenville, Ohio.\" Whatever its hopes and plans — and the next few months should prove or dis- prove its theories — the facts about this week's DuMont actions are these: Whereas the network has been engaging AT&T lines as far west as Kansas City and south to Atlanta on the customary contract basis of ^59.50 per mile per month, 8 hours per day minimum, interconnecting up to 188 stations, spending about $175,000 a month^ it will now contract only for a \"main line\" hookup of these cities; New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, York, Harrisburg, Altoona, Johnstown, Columbus, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Youngstown, Windsor (Detroit) and Chicago. That means 15 stations plus some off-the-air feeds to other affiliates from these stations. The rest of DuMont's 215 affiliates will be served, as many already are, by teletranscriptions as ordered by the sponsor. If an advertiser wants a bigger live network and station time can be cleared, AT&T lines will be ordered on so-called \"occasional basis,\" for which the AT&T rate is $1.15 per mile per hour. That's how Bishop Sheen, for example, can be continued live to some 70 stations; how occasional sports events, in which DuMont has specialized, can be continued. Only last week it interconnected 187 stations for pro grid championship from Cleveland; it's also carrying Shrine's annual East-West football game from San Francisco New Year's Day and big Pro Bowl game from Los Angeles Jan. 16. It's estimated that line costs are being cut to about $70, 000-$80, 000 per month — more than halved. Besides that, staff cutbacks will be considerable — notably engineering, production & office employes. Fact is that DuMont Network has never utilized all its 8 hours per day on the whole 188-station hookup. It has been feeding out only 20-22 hours of programs per week, clearing time for all of them on only its own 5 stations, for most of them on such major affiliates as Chicago's WGN-TV and Baltimore's WAAM. Varying hours were taken by other stations, especially those also having affiliations with another net- work or networks. This scant budget of shows is being further reduced by loss of the American Chicle-Geritol co-sponsorship of \"Rocky King, Detective\" and by cancel- lation of Consolidated Cosmetics Co.'s \"They Stand Accused.\" These losses doubtless hastened the decision to curtail. * * * * DuMont has had plenty of offers to buy both New York & Washington stations, but won't consider their sale — yet. There's also talk, which DuMont spokesmen in- sist is merely talk, that Paramount Pictures might be willing to liquidate its 25.5% interest in DuMont (which enjoys a flourishing TV set, tube and electronics manu- facturing business) if the network and its 2 remaining stations are turned over to it. Paramount already has a TV station in Los Angeles, KTLA, which operates quite successfully as an independent. Entirely rejected is the suggestion that the new Vitapix-Guild film syndicate combine might merge with DuMont. Guild Films' Reub Kaufman is known to hanker after DuMont's splendid New York studios, and for a while Bergmann considered joining his 2 stations in the Vitapix plan calling for fixed time clearances for its films. 5 Dr, DviMont pioneered network TV, as he did the set & tube field, only to see more aggressive later comers like CBS & ABC come along and forge ahead of his net- work. Yet he*s obdurate in wanting to be identified with the telecasting side of the business, rather than manufacture alone. And he believes time is on his side as TV surges to No. 1 advertising medium and as demand for more facilities is created. His present purpose seems to be to sweat out as much time as cheaply as possible. ANs MULTIPLY, TOO— 2782 AT YEAR'S END: TV's tremendous commercial upsurge during 1954 did not prevent AM from increasing its ranks also — in fact, there were more new radio stations authorized during year (exactly 138) them there were new TV starters (101). This surprising fact is disclosed in a statistical recapitulation of our 1955 AM-FM Directory, which comes off presses in about 2 weeks. The oft-predicted decline of AMs simply hasn't happened — and FM's drop has been slight. Actual figures are these; Total AMs authorized at end of 1954 were 2782, of which 2662 were licensed and on the air and 120 still CPs. On same 1953 date, total was 2644, of which 2514 were licensed and on the air and 130 were CPs. Thus there hasn't been a year since the wartime freeze ended that AM didn't add to its ranks; At end of 1952, total was 2516; 1951, 2410 ; 1950, 2351 ; 1949, 2246 ; 1948, 2131 ; 1947, 1961 ; 1946, 1579 ; 1945, 1056. Most of the newcomers are local or daytime stations. FM grantees totaled 583 at end of 1954, of which 549 were on air. Year ago total was 602, with 550 on air. During last year, 37 FM licenses and; 2 CPs were dropped. At end of year, only 11 applications for new FM stations were pending. The 1955 AM-FM Directory (loose-leaf & punched for binding, carrying no ads, cost per extra copy |7.50) also lists all applications for new AM stations pending as of Dec. 31. These totaled 174, as against 207 year before. Dropped during 1954 were 9 AM licenses, 13 CPs. Canada's radio stations increased to 197 from 191 during year, Mexico ' s to 443 from 420; Cuba ' s to 135 from 121 — all listed with addresses, facilities, etc. TWO MORE STARTERS MAKE ON-AIR TOTAL 426: Phoenix's 4th vhf station and the Yakima uhf satellite in Pasco, Wash, got going this week — these and the announced resump- tion of Tulsa's KCEB (Ch. 23) on limited basis bringing year-end total to 426 on air (121 vihf). At press time, FCC had not yet been notified that oilman Elf red Beck's uhf, which got permission to suspend for 6 months due to economic troubles (Vol. 10:49), was back in operation but he writes us: \"We are at present continuing opera- tions on a limited film schedule and present plans are to continue with this limited operation until reorganization plans are completed.\" Week's new starters; KTVK, Phoenix. Ariz. (Ch. 3) began test patterns Dec. 24, plans commercial debut Jan. 15 as independent. It has 25-kw RCA transmitter with 100-kw visual ERP, 125-ft. Allison tower with 6-bay antenna on 2655-ft. Salt River Mt. Ex-Senator, now Gov. Ernest W. McFarland owns 40%, heading group which includes v.p.-gen. mgr. Ralph A. Watkins, 20%; Leon M. Nowell, 20%; Ed Cooper, 20%. Sean Dillon, ex-ABC, is oper- ations & program mgr. ; James E. Overpeck, sales mgr. ; Robert Latham, chief engineer; Ray Gallagher, senior producer. Base rate is $300. Rep is Weed. KEPR-TV, Pasco, Wash. (Ch. 19), first satellite to be authorized by FCC, be- gan operation Dec. 28, feeding Kennewick-Pasco-Richland area with programs from Yak- ima's KIMA-TV (Ch. 29). It uses 1-kw GE transmitter, 300-ft. Fisher tower with 5-bay helical antenna on 1730-ft. Badger Mt. M. Dow Lambert, ex-KING-TV, Seattle, is in charge of the operation, which is manned by himself and one other engineer. KIMA-TV has increased base hour from $200 to $300 for combined operation. Rep is Weed. ♦ * * ♦ Note ; Danville, Va.'s only TV station, WBTM-TV (Ch. 24) announced this week \"heavy financial losses and a lack of advertising revenue\" would force it off air on Dec. 31. Following announcement, a community-wide \"save our station\" movement was organized, according to v.p.-gen. mgr. Edward G. Gardner Jr., aimed at guaranteeing station enough advertising contracts to insure operation for next 12 months. As we went to press, station's future was still in balance, pending tally of new contracts.

Washington law partners Norman E. Joi’gensen & Seymour Krieger have applied for their third radio CP, station to be built in Herkimer, N. Y. (1-kw daytime, 1420 kc). Each holds 40%, Louis Adelman, Trans-World Pro- ductions Inc., New York TV film producer, holding 20%. They also hold 42% each of Broadcasting Inc., which oper- ates WSBB, New Smyrna Beach, Fla. (250-watts, 1230 kc), and is building WLCO, Eustis, Fla. (250-watts, 1240 kc). Senator Assis Chateaubriand, the Brazilian TV-radio station and newspaper owner, arrived in N, Y. this week. 6 - FIRST MILLION-WATT TV transmissions began at 3:15 a.m. Dec. 31 from NBC-basic WBRE-TV, Wilkes- Barre, Pa. (Ch. 28), and second station to achieve 1-mega- watt was planning to go to full power next day — ABC- basic WILK-TV (Ch. 34), also in Wilkes-Barre. WBRE- TV achieved the full 1000-kw power after completing an- tenna installation and de-icing operations on afternoon of Dec. 30. WBRE-TV’s installation is RCA 25-kw trans- mitter with new 46-gain antenna. WILK-TV is using GE 45-kw transmitter, 25-gain helical antenna (Vol. 10:50-52). “Mt. Higby mystery” (Vol. 10:51) was still unsolved this week, but best guessing was that NBC is the un- identified lessee of 3-acre tract on high point at Middle- town, Conn., about halfway between Hartford & New Haven, and will soon seek uhf channel for new 1000-kw uhf station there. NBC engineers meanwhile have com- pleted uhf survey of San Francisco area. Network’s uhf plans are expected to be made known momentarily. ^ ^ Only shipments reported this week were GE 50-kw amplifier to WCPO-TV, Cincinnati (Ch. 9), 12-bay batwing antenna to U of Illinois’ upcoming WTLC, Champaign- Urbana (Ch. 10) and all remaining transmitter parts for W ILK-TV’s boost to 1000-kw. From principals of upcom- ing TV stations, these are latest reports: WCBI-TV, Columbus, -Miss. (Ch. 4), previously re- porting “early 1955” target, now is negotiating for 500-ft. tower which it hopes to have ready by May 1, according to gen. mgr. Bob McRaney. RCA 5-kw transmitter is on hand, but antenna has not yet been ordered. Station plans to ask for site change to Hwy. 12, four mi. NNE of city at new location of radio WCBI. Signed as CBS affiliate under new Extended Market Plan, it also seeks other network affiliation. Owner Birney Imes Jr., who turned in Ch. 28 CP last May, publishes Columbus Com- mercial Dispatch and controls WCBI and 5 other Miss, radio stations. Base rate not set. Rep will be McGillvra. KCOR-TV, San Antonio, Tex. (Ch. 41), which re- cently asked for Ch. 14 allocation, now doesn’t expect to get on air with test patterns until mid-March, plans mid- April programming, reports chief engineer Marvin L. Fiedler. Delivery date hasn’t been set for 1-kw RCA transmitter, nor has work begun on Emsco 406-ft. tower and RCA antenna. It plans to be all-Spanish outlet, using films and kines from Mexico and other Latin-American countries, as well as U. S. Nathan Safir, from radio KCOR, will be gen. mgr. Base hour will be $250. Rep will be Richard O’Connell. * * * * CBOFT, Ottawa, Ont. (Ch. 9), first Canadian TV with 5-letter call (and first such in North America with- out hyphen), won’t be on air until next summer due to equipment delays. CBC will operate it as French-lan- guage outlet, using same studios and same transmitter setup as companion CBOT (Ch. 4), which will switch to all-English. Initial CBOFT programming will be net- work only. In Montreal, CBC setup is similar, with CBFT (Ch. 2) as French-language, CBMT (Ch. 6) English. ■ KDRO-TV, Sedalia, Mo. (Ch. 6) this week asked FCC permission to leave air Dec. 31 — then changed mind and told Commission it will reduce programming to 2 hours daily beginning Jan. 1. Non-interconnected non-network station is undergoing financial reorganization, according to spokesman for owner Milton Hinlein. WGBS-TV call letters are now being used by Storer’s Ch. 23 Miami outlet, telecasting from temporary Ft. Lauderdale location formerly occupied by WFTL-TV, whose physical facilities and channel WGBS-TV has taken over (Vol. 10:47,51). 7 Shifts of UHF stations downward in frequency, re- quested more and more often nowadays, aren’t what FCC would like — but it continues to authorize them because it’s apparent that alternative is even greater uhf mortality. FCC’s concern about trend is based on fear that paucity of stations on higher channels will discourage receiver and transmitter makers from improving equip- ment— leading to general abandonment of large chunk of TV spectrum. Three more uhf CPs have been turned in, meanwhile: WJOL-TV, Joliet, 111. (Ch. 48); WJLB-TV, Detroit (Ch. 50); WSBM-TV, Saginaw, Mich. (Ch. 51). Taking cue from FCC’s action in granting WMGT, Adams, Mass, shift from Ch. 73 to Ch. 19, giving it “show cause’’ order insuring that station would get the channel, other stations are making similar requests. WLOK-TV, Lima, 0. (Ch. 73), soon to become WIMA-TV following sale (Vol. 10:52), has asked shift of educational Ch. 14 from Oxford, 0. WWLP, Springfield, Mass. (Ch. 61), wants to go to Ch. 22, submitting channel-shifting plan involving substitution of Ch. 36 for Ch. 22 in Providence and Ch. 38 for Ch. 50 in Boston, deletion of Ch. 36 from Northampton, addition of Ch. 61 to Easthampton. A geographical and channel shift is requested by WKST-TV, New Castle, Pa. (Ch. 45). Having lost $70,000 to date, it told FCC it believes it can make out in Youngs- town, get a network affiliation there. It asks permission to move to Youngstown with Ch. 45 transmitter, shifting Youngstown’s Ch. 73 to New Castle. Search for vhf channels continues, too. E. Anthony & Sons, one-time holder of CPs for WBOS-TV, Boston (Ch. 50) and WTEV-TV, New Bedford (Ch. 28), peti- tioned for allocation of Ch. 6 to Nashaquitsa, Mass. Meanwhile, Commission granted one of its now-in- fi’equent CPs, giving Ch. 11 to Northern TV Inc., Fair- banks, Alaska (A. G. Hiebert, pres., principal stockholder). One initial decision was rendered, examiner Charles Fred- erick choosing Beachview Broadcasting Corp. over WAVY, for Norfolk’s Ch. 10. He found the 2 generally equal, but frowned upon action of 50 WAVY stockholders in giving control of their stock (37.4%) to 11 voting trustees. Pres, and 77.77% stockholder of Beachview is optometrist Dudley Cooper; secy, and 10% stockholder is Irvin M. Kipnes, one- time reporter (including stint on Broadcasting -Telecast- ing Magazine) and ex-mgr. of radio WCAV, Norfolk, and other stations. Pres, of WAVY group is Hunter C. Phelan (food store chain) ; v.p. is Carl J. Burkland, former mgr. of WTOP, Washington, ex-gen. sales mgr. of CBS Spot Sales. Battle between WTRI and WROW-TV, Albany, N. Y. (Vol. 10:51), will be settled by hearings, FCC decided this week, setting en banc oral argument for Jan. 24, with evidentiary hearing before an examiner to come later. Commission turned down WTRI’s request that sale of WROW-TV to Lowell Thomas group be held up. Oral argument will be on whether Thomas group’s ownership of WROW-TV would violate rules on station ownership by network personnel and whether affiliation arrangement between WROW-TV and CBS violates anti- trust laws. Hearings will be on allegations of “secret agreement” on affiliation between the two, possibly also on matters considered in oral argument. Fight over grant of Ch. 12, Flint, to Detroit’s WJR, hasn't let up, either. Defeated applicants WFDF, Flint (Bitner) and Butterfield Theatres filed joint petition for further hearing, charging that grantee WJRT has com- pletely changed plans from those it advanced during hear- ing— moved site 44 mi., renting studios rather than build- ing, affiliating with CBS rather than DuMont, changing stock ownership, changing program plans, etc. On allocations front, off-air WTOV-TV, Norfolk (Ch. 27), seeking assignment of Ch. 13 to area, challenged prop- agation data of WAAM, Baltimore (Vol. 10:51), stating that it wasn’t timely filed, is incorrect and based on in- sufficient measurements. Even if data were correct, WCOV-TV said, FCC should stick to its 170-mi. co-channel separation in Zone I because of need for more stations there. Midnight Sun Bcstg. Co.’s $100,000 purchase of KFIA, Anchorage (Ch. 2) and CP for KFIF, Fairbanks (Ch. 2) from Richard R. Rollins, in deal whereby Rollins retains approximately 19% (Vol. 10:47), was approved by FCC this week. Midnight operates 4 Alaskan radio stations, has as majority owner Lathrop Co., operator of theatres in Anchorage and Fairbanks. Other transactions ap- proved: (1) Transfer of WAYS-TV, Charlotte, N. C. (Ch. 36), to local advertising man Hugh Deadwyler for token $4; radio WAYS is not involved (Vol. 10:51). Sellers are G. W. Dowdy, B. T. Whitmire, J. Horton Doughton & Harold H. Thoms, latter also owning uhf WISE-TV, Ashe- ville. (2) Transfer of CP for KBAY-TV, San Francisco (Ch. 20) from Lawrence Harvey to Bay Television, in which Dr. & Mrs. Leonard Averett are equal partners (Vol. 10:45). Averetts are to contribute $200,000 each to partnership. KNUZ-TV, Houston (Ch. 39), which went off air last June after 8 months deficit operation (Vol. 10:27), filed this week for extension of CP for 6-12 months while it considers plan to return to air from studios of radio KNUZ. Letter with application revealed uhf station had lost total of $300,000, at rate of $18,000-$40,000 a month. Talk of moving all or some vhf stations into uhf, be- cause of military requirements, is discounted by FCC chair- man George McConnaughey, who also views with skep- ticism the reverse — getting more vhf from the military. Edward Lamb hearing will resume Jan. 18, by agree- ment between counsel for Lamb and FCC broadcast bureau, instead of Jan. 4 as previously announced. “TV Assignment Rules & Policies” is title of paper to be delivered Feb. 1 by FCC Broadcast Bureau chief Curtis Plummer, during Jan. 31-Feb. 4 AIEE meeting in New York’s Statler and Governor Clinton Hotels. Other- papers same day, in addition to several on color (Vol. 10:52): “UHF Wave Propagation,” by Robert P.

Hutton, Goodyear Aircraft Corp.; “TV Receiver Signal Overload,” by C. Masucci, CBS-Co- lumbia. Network service was extended by AT&T to 4 stations over Xmas week end: WFIE, Evansville, Ind.; WEHT, Henderson, Ky.; WBTW, Florence, S. C.; WSFA-TV, Mont- gomery, Ala. WWTV, Cadillac, Mich., is now getting net- work service via its own 3-hop private microwave from Kalamazoo. Next on AT&T’s hookup list are WEAT-TV, W. Palm Beach; KLRJ, Henderson, Nev.; KEYD-TV, Minneapolis. R. W. Miller, asst, operations director of AT&T long lines dept., promoted to asst. v.p. in charge of new group to promote use of all long-distance services. Beverly H. Swango replaces Miller. John C. Marsh is promoted to asst. v.p. in charge of personnel for new group; Wm. J. Whittaker succeeds Marsh as asst, treas. FCC meeting on pay-as-you-look TV will probably come week of Jan. 10, starting wheels moving toward rule- making on subject. Previously, Jan. 3 had been set for meeting, but too few commissioners are expected to be in town then. 8 Station Accounts: Spot TV billings in 7 categories — detergents, toilet soaps, shortenings, margarines, denti- frices, home permanents, shampoos — exceeded spot radio by nearly 5-to-l in third quarter 1954, overturning radio’s slight lead over TV in third quarter 1953, according to report this week of N. C. Rorabaugh Co., 347 Madison Ave., N. Y. Spot TV expenditures in those categories in third quarter totaled $6,385,654 vs. radio’s $1,476,796; in same 1953 quarter spot TV totaled $2,963,951 vs. radio’s $3,105,566. For 15-month period from July 1, 1953 to Sept. 30, 1954, TV billings were $25,033,198 vs. radio’s $11,632,460 in those categories . . . National Biscuit Co. to sponsor weekly 30-min. filmed Sky King in about 25 mar- kets starting in Jan., thru McCann-Erickson . . . White King Soap Co., Los Angeles, for its new “D” detergent, to use heavy TV spot campaign in all major western markets starting in Feb., thru Jim Morgan Co., Hollywood . . . Carter Products (Carter’s liver pills) to use 125 TV mar- kets in 13-week spot campaign starting Jan. 3, thru Ted Bates . . . National Brush Co., Aurora, 111., to introduce its new “Sno-Chaser” snow removal brush for motorists, uses one-min. spots in several stations across nation only on snowy days, thru Charles 0. Puffer Co., Chicago . . . Pro- ducers Livestock Marketing Assn., Salt Lake City, pleased by results of 4-month spot campaign in Utah this year to promote lamb consumption, expands budget for bigger pro- motion in 1955 . . . Among other advertisers currently re- ported using or preparing to use TV : Ore-Ida Potato Products, Ontario, Ore. (frozen potato products) , thru Sidney Garfield & Assoc., San Francisco; Bissell Carpet Sweeper Co., Grand Rapids, Mich., thru N. W. Ayer & Son, Chicago; Botany Mills, Passaic, N. J. (Botany lanolin cosmetics), thru Hirshon-Garfield, N. Y. ; Autoyre Co., Oakville, Conn, (bathroom-kitchen closet accessories) , thru Ben Sackheim, N. Y. ; Lux Clock Mfg.

(PEZ candy with own dis- pensing unit), thru Wesley Assoc., N. Y.; Porter-Cable- Machine Co., Syracuse (saws, sanders, planes). Network Accounts: Changing concept of network spon- sorships, in which rival companies sponsor same program, may be heralded by announcement that 3 soap companies have bought 15-min. segments of NBC-TV’s Ding Dong School (Mon.-thru-Fri. 10-10:30 a.m.) — albeit for non- competing pioducts. The companies are Procter & Gam- ble, for its pin curlers; Colgate, for toothpaste; Manhattan Soap Co., for its Sweetheart soap. It’s a by-product of the ever-increasing diversification of many large corpora- tions, of course, but it’s inspiring what Variety’s George Rosen calls “some unprecedented shenanigans” in sponsor- ship concepts. Only a year ago, writes Rosen, anyone who suggested such affinities would be “raih'oaded out of the business so fast that he wouldn’t know what had hap- pened to him” . . . H. J. Heinz Co. to sponsor Captain Gallant of the Foreign Legion on NBC-TV starting Feb. 13, Sun. 5:30-6 p.m., thru Maxon Inc.; Hallmark will cut hack its current 5-6 p.m. Hallmark Hall of Fame drama to 5-5:30 . . .

C. from $300 to $350 & $60 to $70. CKLW-TV, Windsor, Ont. (Ch. 9), opposite Detroit, has one rate for CBC network & Canadian accounts and separate rate for U. S. business, reports station rep Adam J. Young Jr. The $450 base hour reported as revised rate (Vol. 10:49) applies to Canadian business. All U. S. busi- ness “which represents the greater portion of station’s dollar volume” is based on $1100 base rate reported when station began operation last Sept. 16. NBC will televise and broadcast both the announce- ment of Academy Awards movie nominations Feb. 12 and the “Oscar” presentation ceremony itself in March under 6-year contract signed this week with Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, Oldsmobile again sponsoring. NBC’s WRCA-TV, New York, hikes cut-in rates on Today from $350 to $425 as of Jan. 3. Alexander W. Dannenbaum, ex-pres. of WDAS, Phila- delphia and father of Alexander W. Dannenbaum Jr., sales mgr. of WPTZ, died Dec. 28. Arthur W. Kelly, 64, onetime United Artists exec, v.p., lately in TV film production, died in Nice, France, Dec. 26. 9 Telecasting Notes: “a staggering $go,ooo,ooo — about double the record figure of 1954 — has been budgeted by telefilm producers in Hollywood for 1965,” reports Dec. 29 Variety on basis of survey of all Hollywood TV film pro- ducers. These conclusions are reported: Some 111 series are definitely planned for 1955, compared to 64 last year; 60 of the 111 are pre-sponsored, 35 are being produced for syndication — as compared to 34 pre-sponsored and 23 for syndication last year . . . While the giants are growing larger, there’s still ‘‘ample room for more of the smaller comj)anies leasing one or 2 sponsored series,” article notes, pointing out thei’e are 51 Hollywood TV “filmeries” with production definitely set, as compared to 34 a year ago . . . No. 1 in TV film field this year and last is Ziv, which esti- mates $9,500,000 in 1955 production vs. $5,000,000 in 1954; No. 2 is MCA’s Revue Productions, with $6,000,000 planned; then McCadden Productions (Burns & Allen), “which shot into the big leagues in one season,” with more than $5,000,000 scheduled. Other ranking companies are Desilu, planning nearly $5,000,000, Gross-Krasne with $4,- 500,000, Columbia Pictures’ Screen Gems with $4,200,000 . . . TV as employment source for Hollywood actors now ranks neck-and-neck with theatrical movies. Screen Actors Guild reports. Survey by the 8000-member Guild showed TV films now provide 46% of employment of actors earn- ing up to $7500 a year, while theatrical films provide 54% . . . Ziv TV finally has “the home we needed,” as chairman Frederic Ziv puts it — the big American National Studios, once home of Eagle-Lion and Pathe, purchased this week for sum in excess of $1,400,000. It covers 6 acres with completely equipped sound stages, more than doubling Ziv’s present facilities. It will be used for all production henceforth. Property is being taken over 100%, sellers including Bob Hope, Ed Pauley, Dan Reeves, Fred Levy, Ed Matz, Bernard Prokter. Heading new “one roof” facil- ities is Ziv’s West Coast v.p., Maurice Unger . . . Guild Films pres. Reub Kaufman, reporting his company did $5,000,000 in billings in 1954, says 8 series are to be filmed in 1955, totaling 234 half hours, 273 fifteen-minute programs. To be shot in Hollywood: Life with Elizabeth, Liberace, Confidential File, Frankie Laine, Florian Za- Ba.ch, Connie Haines; in N. Y., The Goldbergs, It’s Fun to Rediice . . . General Teleradio’s WOR-TV reports it hit black for first time in 1954, most of profit having been made last 16 weeks and much of it attributable to Million Dollar Movie series; v.p. Gordon Gray also says radio WOR billings in 1954 topped 1953 by 16.8% . . . WKY-TV, Oklahoma City, has received copyright on its on-the-air and advertising identification which promotes its color- casts— an artist’s palette with brushes and daubs of color . . . As Xmas gift to sponsors and timebuyers, and in lieu of greeting cards, Calgary’s CHCT-TV sent them shares of bona fide Calgary oil stock. Newcomers to ARB’s top-10 for Dec.: Disneyland (ABC) No. 9, and George Gobel Show (NBC) No. 10. Rating-wise, Dragnet (NBC) is No. 1, You, Bet Your Life (NBC) No. 2, Jackie Gleason Show (CBS) No. 3, I Love Lucy (CBS) No. 4, Toast of the Town (CBS) No. 5 — though Toast of the Town ranked first in number of view- ers reached . . . Nielsen ratings for 2 weeks ended Nov. 27 put top 5 in this order: Jackie Gleason Show, Toast of Ihe Town, I Love Lucy, Buick-Berle Shoiv (NBC), Disney- land. Knight Newspapers Inc. bought Charlotte (N. C.) Ob- server for $7,000,000 this week in deal involving no TV- radio properties. Elsewhere, Knight owns 45% of WAKR- TV, Akron (Ch. 49) ; 27.7% of CP for WIND-TV, Chi- cago (Ch. 20) ; part of Ch. 7 application for Miami. Other Jack Knight newspapers: Akron Beacon- Journal, Chicago Daily News, Detroit Free Press, Miami Herald. TV in 1955 will “crash the $1 billion barrier,” says Oliver Treyz, pres, of Television Bureau of Advertising, in year-end statement verifying our recent guesstimate (Vol. 10:48) of $900,000,000 as the advei’tisers’ 1954 in- vestment in TV. He points out that network billings are up 40%, national spot billings “similarly up,” whereas 11-month PIB figures show slight decline in magazine ad- vertising billings and Media Records reported small de- cline in newspaper linage in first 11 months of 1954. This means, he adds, that “although TV is behind direct mail, and newspapers out-bill TV by more than 2-to-l, the gap is closing. In fact, only TV is gaining.” Also predicting records is Richard P. Doherty, consultant, ex-NARTB eco- nomics chief, who in Jan. Television Age estimates TV’s revenues (not including time, talent & other costs) at $615,000,000 to $630,000,000 in 1954 and predicts more than $800,000,000 in 1955. Beer & wine advertisers sponsored only 2% of all radio programs, 3% of TV, in year ending Aug. 31, NARTB told House Commerce Committee in final report answering its request in connection with Bryson bill (HR-1227) which would outlaw such commercials (Vol. 10:42). Of actual commercial time, NARTB said, beer-wine com- mercials took only .21% of radio, .31% of TV. Dollar-wise, expenditures for beer-wine commercials were $34,000,000. NARTB survey included data from 2139 radio stations (76.5% of all), 205 TV stations (92.3%). Beer-wine spon- sors bought 17.88% of all sports programs; next highest were music and news, with 1.95% each. NARTB pres. Harold E. Fellows reiterated contention that Bryson bill is unconstitutional and that industry has been successful in self -regulation. Legal slap on the wrist was administered to CBS-TV’s Strike It Rich by N. Y. City Magistrate Samuel H. Ohringer Nov. 28 when he found show guilty of soliciting funds from studio audience without license from Welfare Dept. (Vol. 10:10). He also ruled local authorities had no jurisdiction over relationship between show and its sponsors or nationwide TV audience — and said he would have dismissed the charge if program were not presented before studio audience. In 16-p. opinion, magistrate said matter was “a very close question of law” and that no fine was called for. Producer Walt Framer and city wel- fare commissioner Henry L. McCarthy both expressed gratification with decision. Framer declaring show would continue, but without studio audience participation, and that he would nevertheless appeal the ruling.

Sales for the 1954 period were $93,007,000 vs. $81,212,000 preceding year. For 3 months ended Nov. 30, sales of $48,300,000 and profit of 52^ a share were indicated, compared to $43,- 900,000 and 29^ a year ago. Pres. Charles F. Adams Jr. attributed impi’ovement in sales to continuing high volume of govt, orders, improved market for TV sets, tubes and components, steadily increasing demand for transistors and diodes. He added that govt, billings in first half of fiscal year were approximately 60% of total, compared with 70% in previous periods, and Nov. 30 backlog of govt, orders was $117,000,000 vs. $150,000,000 at end of previous fiscal year and $185,000,000 Nov. 30, 1953. International Resistance Co., which operates on annual accounting basis for ten 5-week periods, reports earnings after taxes for 3-period June 28-Oct. 24 amounted to $245,- 242 as against $123,080 for 5-period Jan. 1-June 27. In- come for June 28-Oct. 24 period was $4,176,135 vs. $5,813,- 243 for 5-period Jan. 1-June 27. Final 2 periods of 1954, states pres. Charles Weyl, “will conform generally to the June 28-Oct. 24 periods.” IRC last Oct. 24 purchased Van Dyke Instruments Inc., maker of precision potentiometers required for guided missiles, automation, etc., is operating it as a wholly owned subsidiary. Trav-Ler Radio’s 1954 sales reached new high of about $16,000,000, compared to $14,700,000 in 1953, pres. Joe Friedman told meeting of distributors and dealers. Earn- ings won’t equal 1953’s $412,275 (54(f a share) but will be high enough to cover 30^S dividend payment, he said.

CBS Foundation Inc.’s plan for making grants to privately-endowed educational institutions, based on a formula whereby contributions are made in the names of its executives who meet certain standards, has met good reaction in business and educational circles, indicating pos- sibility others may follow suit. Foundation’s first contri- bution was $32,000 to 14 colleges & universities on behalf of 16 executives (Vol. 10:52), and similar contribution is planned in 1955. Color Trends & Briefs: Most authoritative report avail- able on network affiliates’ ability to rebroadcast network color feeds and originate own slide, film and live color will be included as a new feature in TV Factbook No. 20, due off presses later this month. Based on information supplied by networks and equip- ment manufacturers, it will give network-by-netwoi’k and station-by-station tabulation showing whether or not sta- tions ai’e now able to handle network or local color — plus tai’get dates for local color for these not now using slide, film or live equipment. Compilation gives this lineup: NBC-TV — All 53 basic affiliates are equipped to carry network color, 14 have slide & film equipment, 7 have live cameras. Sixteen basics plan to get slide & film gear this year, 12 live cameras. Of interconnected affiliates indi- vidually available, 41 can carry network color, 5 have slide & film gear, none live cameras. Eight more plan to be ready with slide & film this year, while 2 plan to ac- quire cameras. CBS-TV — Equipped for network color are 48 basic re- quired affiliates, while 6 are shown with slide & film equip- ment, 4 with live cameras. Sixteen basics are due to get slide & film gear this year, 2 live cameras. Of supplemen- tary interconnected affiliates, 37 can carry network color, none are shown with slide, film or live color installations. Nine are due for slide & film this year, 3 live cameras. DuMont — Total of 81 affiliates (most shared with NBC-TV or CBS-TV) able to take network color, 16 of these also ready with slide & film equipment. ABC-TV supplied no report on status of its affiliates. AT&T reports that it re-engineered and re-equipped over 47,000 channel miles of facilities during 1954, to bring color to 139 stations in 101 cities. As of Jan. 1, 1955, AT&T served 260 stations in 234 cities with mono- chrome. 1|! * * # Color .set production won’t go beyond 50,000 in 1955, says Dr. Allen B. DuMont, who takes issue with forecasts ranging up to 300,000 by other industry leaders. In year- end statement, he commented: “The development of the right color tubes; the refinement in receiver circuits; the necessary reduction in manufacturing costs; the laz’ge scale presentation of color programs in all markets — all of these things are taking time. Eventually, yes, TV will be both a color and a black-&-white medium. However, in 1955 it looks about 99% black-&-white.” DuMont Labs tube div. mgr. F. P. Rice, reporting limited production of rectangular color tubes is scheduled for latter 1955, also thinks “average estimates of approximately 250,000 color sets seems to be very high.” Color TV will cut into other media’s take of ad budgets, according to 68% of the 5000 members of Tide Magazine’s “leadership panel” of marketing executives. Only 8% feel it will increase use of other media, while 24% say it won’t affect them. What can other media do about it? Execu- tives generally say “improve,” “use more color,” “make a pitch for smaller advertisers who can’t afford color TV.” Rumors that CBS and NBC would reduce or quit color- casting were denied vehemently by spokesmen of both, NBC going so far as to issue statement by pres. Sylvester L. Weaver that “public interest has been highly encourag- ing and we look forward to continued advances and ex- pansion in color programming during 1955.” Jan. 3 week network color schedules: CBS-TV — Jan. 5, Best of Broadway, “Arsenic & Old Lace,” 10-11 p.m. ; Jan. 8, My Favorite Husband, 9:30-10 p.m. NBC-TV^ — Jan. 5, Norby premiere, 7-7:30 p.m. Recognizing color’s commercial infancy, AT&T again notified FCC that it will continue “experimental” rates for color network facilities — asking extension to May 31. . with Electronics Reports WASHINGTON 5, D C. • TEtEPHONE STERLING S-1755 Trade Report January 1, 1955 AS 1955 BEGINS-TV-RADIO TRADE RIDES HIGH: The year's TV production hovered close to 1950's record 7,465,800 as we went to press. With one week yet to be reported, the preliminary RETMA estimate, subject to revision, showed 7,505,000 TVs turned out, exceeding the 7,214,827 produced in all of 1953. Output for week ended Dec. 24, normally a low-production holiday week, totaled 151,285. Radio production that week was 239,168 (109,472 auto), for 51-week 10,210,000 total vs. 13,000,000 in 1953. And 1954 has been TV's biggest retail sales year, irrespective of whether it was first or second best production year. Several weeks ago retail sales passed 1953 high of 6,400,000, and are expected to total between 6,800,000 & 7,000,000 for the full year. This means about 55,000,000 sets sold to the public in TV's 8 com- mercial years from 1947-54, of which perhaps 1,000,000 have been scrapped. Inventories at year's end are estimated about 2,200,000, compared to about 2,000,000 at start of year. Whether this represents a potential danger to trade, as has been suggested by some industry leaders' (Vol. 10:49-50), is open to the normal differences of opinion which exist in TV no less than in other industries. *1 * * What does 1955 hold for trade? From where we sit, it looks' like 6-6,500,000 black-&-white sets should be produced and marketed in 1955 — down somewhat from the 1954 level — but total dollar volume from TV alone shouldn't be far off estimated $2 billion in 1954 if sales of high-priced color receivers come anywhere near the 200-300,000 predicted by industry leaders. This, of course, is pegged to highly optimistic forecasts of consumer purchasing power and employment in 1955. With TVs now in about 70% of nation's 47,000,000 household units, trade just can't realistically expect many more fat years in initial sales — at least not until color really gets going. Consequently, we look for replacement and multiple sales to a family to assume greater importance than ever this year — and this inevitably means far keener competition and bigger promotions to induce families to trade in their old sets or buy second sets for use in other rooms. Prices this spring should remain firm or even dip slightly lower on leader models. But if market holds up reasonably well, look for some price hikes by fall. The models introduced thus far this winter (for details of those introduced this week, see p. 13) are f irm-to-lower in the majority of cases. 't' ^ Accent will continue to be on 21-in. overwhelmingly as most popular size, with 24- in. creeping up slowly at expense of 17-in. Several companies have added 24-in. to their lines for first time this winter; still others have expanded their offering of 24-in. RCA and Philco , among the major manufacturers whose actions and comments are watched closely by trade for future trends, have expressed themselves as pleased with sales of big-ticket 24-in. in a $300-plus market. RCA's Frank Folsom says it has sold entire output of 24-in. full-door mahog- any and walnut console at $500, the highest price in RCA line. And he says total unit production in that model is \"more than you think.\" Philco's James H. Carmine says \"Miss America\" 24-in. console at $360 is currently by far best console seller. Color's impact remains conjectural. Best that can be seen in admittedly hazy crystal ball is that color will exert a greater influence on 1955 market than in 1954 — but scarcely enough to make many prospective TV customers pay the price or induce set owners to trade in good-working black-&-white receivers for it. Folsom, for one, says there will be a \"substantial market\" this year for RCA's $895 color set among the \"Cadillac\" and \"Miami\" carriage trade as a starter. The 1954 servicing bill was impressive, and 1955 should be slightly higher. Overall, it was about $1.7 billion, and RCA corporate executive v.p. Charles Odorizzi 11 12 - estimates it will reach annual gross of $2.7 billion in 3 years (Vol. 10:48). Some 88,000,000 TV-radio replacement receiving tubes had estimated retail value in 1954 of $260,000,000; 5,500,000 TV replacement picture tubes had retail value of about $210,000,000; and components, antennas & accessories added up to $400,000,000. Radio production and sales appear to have fallen off to about 10,500.000 in 1954 — and the prospect is that 1955 should see about same volume. At factory value this would mean about $225,000,000. In 1953 it was $300,000,000 for 13,000,000 sets. MANUFACTURERS UNEASY AS IMPORTS GO UP: increase in imports of radios and parts and heavy promotion of foreign items — — have a lot of U.S. receiver and parts makers uneasy about what future may hold in potential competition from abroad. Although imports thus far have been confined to radio receivers & components, they're asking themselves, logically enough, can TV be far behind? Concern with what future may bring, more than any present inroads, impelled RETMA to resolve at recent convention to fight for restoration of import duty to 35% from current 12)^% (Vol. 10:47). While admitting nobody's being put out of business by current level of imports, parts makers particularly want protection for future. RETMA is currently surveying its membership to determfne exactly how much competition really exists, as first step before petitioning Congress and the Tariff Commission for an increase in duty. Tariff laws provide that substantial injury to an industry must be proven before duties on individual commodities can be increased. It's frankly doubted that the industry, having just ended highest TV sales year in history and a good if unspectacular radio year, can prove very extensive injury now. Plea for tariff hike will also cite fact that West Germany and Britain, where most serious competition originates, have far lower labor costs than U.S. RETMA is also expected to contend that U.S. Govt, funds have directly subsidized exporters. James D. Secrest, RETMA exec, v.p., characterized goal thus: \"We're trying to put out the flame while it's still just a small brush fire. We don't know if or when it will erupt into a four-alarm blaze.\" Commerce Dept, classifies electronics imports as \"TV Apparatus and Parts\" (Schedule A-7090680) and \"Radio Apparatus and Parts\" (Schedule A-7090660). They in- clude receivers and components, though in practice virtually no TV receivers have been imported. Combined imports of such electronics items in first 8 months of 1954 totaled $1,814,515, composed of $1,465,220 radio, $349,295 TV — mainly components in case of TV and obviously a bagatelle when stacked against U.S. industry's factory value (1953) of $1,235 billion TV, $299,236,000 radio. In 1953, imports totaled some $3,334,558, compared to $6,330,885 in 1952. No breakdown by units is provided. Electronics exports by U.S. in first 9 months of 1954 were $192,177,193. In 1953, they were $247,839,764 and in 1952 were $210,000,000. TV-radio sets are sub- stantial but by no means dominant items among these exports. ♦ * ♦ * West German radios and British TV-radio and high fidelity components provide keenest competition in U.S., Commerce reports. German exports to U.S. totaled some $300,920 in first 8 months, compared to only $109,058 for all of 1953 and $95,420 in 1952. Leading German radios in U.S. are Telefunken (distributed by American Elite Inc., N.Y.) ; Grundig (by Majestic Radio) ; Siemens and Metz. To this list should be added Philips of Eindhoven, the Dutch radio distributed in U.S. by North American Philips. Philips is particularly strong in South America (Vol. 10:12). In recent months, German firms have been signing U.S. distributors, many of them retailers. German radios are well-constructed and many of them admittedly have tonal qualities superior to same-priced U.S. sets. German radios for sale in U.S., how- ever, usually have high price tags by American standards. For example, the least expensive Grundig AM-FM radio sells for $70; similar American sets start at $40. British electronics exports to U.S., chiefly components, totaled $607,331 in first 8 months, compared to $463,006 in 1953 and $789,541 in 1952. Among popular British items are Wharf e dale speakers, Garrard record changers. Leak amplifiers. - 13 - Topics & Trends oi TV Trade: Industry-wide price cuts in long-playing records are regarded as certain in wake of RCA Victor’s surprising, heavily-publicized an- nouncement of reductions of up to 30% in price of 10 & 12-in. LP records, along with revision of dealer discounts, effective Jan. 3. Within 48 hours of RCA’s announcement, which hit record industry like a bombshell, Columbia Records — re- garded 1-2 with Victor in industry — cancelled its 5-month price guarantee to dealers on LP records, announced only week before. M-G-M Records and London Records cut prices to meet RCA’s reductions. Several other major manufacturers indicated they would also cut prices in week or so. RCA made these changes: All 12-in. LPs were cut to $3.98 from $5.95, $4.85 & $4.19, depending on whether they were classical, semi- classical or popular; 10-in. LPs were cut to $2.98 from $4.95, $3.85, $3.15 & $2.99; double extended play 45rpm’s were set at $2.98 from $3.85, $2.99, $2.98 & $2.94; 45rpm singles were cut to 89«f from $1.16 & $1; single extended plays were set at $1.49 from $1.58 & $1.47. Price of 78rpm was increased from 89<S to 984, as consequence of drasti- cally diminished production and sales. Of equal importance to trade is radical revision of discount structure. Dealer gross margin on all 45 & 78rpm records will be spread from current 38% to 42%. On LPs it will remain 38% and traditional dealer return privilege will be eliminated. Returns continue at 5% for 78s & 45s. RCA pres. Frank Folsom, who made cuts after recent cross-country visit to distributors & dealers, said Victor action hits hard at mail order business in records. Trade sources commented that discount houses would also suffer as result of big price slashes. Discount houses sell records average 25% below regular retail outlets. Folsom said new plan was developed because of his belief that record industry “is on the threshold of its great- est period of expansion.” Record sales in 1954 are esti- mated by authoritative trade sources at about 230,000,000 units, with retail value of $275,000,000. Folsom foresees a 15% increase in record sales in 1955. He commented: “Today there are more than 25,000,000 turntables — many of them equipped to handle the 3 phonograph speeds — compared with only 16,000,000 phonographs at the end of World War II. About 20,000,000 record players of all types are expected to be produced and sold in the next 5 years. Renewed popularity of the phonograph is expected to continue to increase the number of machines in use and this, of course, will mean greater sales of records.” 4: 3(( % :|c Motorola introduced new line of 26 TV models to dis- tributors Dec. 29 at Chicago’s Edgewater Beach Hotel — only major manufacturer to show full new line at mid- winter.

All new models have high-fidelity sound. Stewart-Warner, going out of TV-radio field, its serv- ice and some of distribution facilities being taken over by Ilofl’man Radio (Vol. 10:51-52), has sold some of its fac- tory inventory to Macy’s, N. Y., which will shoiTly break big promotion. Said to be involved are 2500 TVs, 6000 radios. 14 - DuMont re-entered radio production after 3-year ab- sence with announcement this week that own AM-only radios would be included as optional equipment at $30 extra in 3 new “wide horizon” TV models to be introduced Jan. 3 at Chicago marts. Sales mgr. Dan Halpin said radio production would be in limited quantities on experi- mental basis at first. The radio chassis ai’e housed in TV cabinets but operate independently, using only the speaker in common with TV chassis.

Picture tube sales in first 10 months totaled 7,746,- 240, valued at $161,520,089, compared to 8,501,455 worth $203,127,855 in first 10 months of 1953, reports RETMA. Oct. sales hit new monthly record of 1,269,674, valued at $26,597,702, compared to 1,149,791 at $23,892,469 in Sept, and 948,593 at $23,994,184 in Oct. 1953. Receiving tube sales in first 10 months totaled 308,398,701, valued at $220,- 988,119, compared to 382,080,558 at $263,328,699 in same 1953 period. Oct. sales were 42,347,794 at $29,228,992 vs. 40,966,063 at $28,953,592 in Sept, and 34,928,108 at $25,- 393,879 in Oct. 1953. [Note: Tabulation of picture and receiving tube sales, 1947-54, with breakdowns by initial equipment, renewal, export, govt. & factory value, will be included in upcoming spring edition of TV Factbook, off presses about mid- Jan.] GE tube dept. mgr. J. Milton Lang figures 5,500,000 new picture tubes will be required as replacements in 1955 — about one in every 6 sets. That would be highest re- placement ratio yet, having been one in 7 in 1954. In addi- tion, he estimates the industry will make about 6,000,000 tubes for new sets, so that 1955 total will run 11,500,000, or about 500,000 ahead of record 1953. Industry-wide, in- cluding receiving industrial & military types, the electronic tube business will enjoy total volume of about $650,000,000 in 1955, in Lang’s opinion. TV set sales by Canadian factories totaled 530,350 at average price of $348 in first 11 months of 1954, when pro- duction was 499,928, reports Canadian RTMA. Projected production estimate is for 224,640 more sets in Dec.-Feb. period. Inventory at end of Nov. was 38,411, compared to 36,318 at end of Oct. and 49,165 at end of Sept. Montreal area led in sales with 148,081; Toronto second, 93,544; Prairies, 58,911; British Columbia, 52,457; other Ontario, 46,528; Ottawa & eastern Ontario, 34,645; Hamilton- Niagara, 30,811; Quebec City area, 29,400; Maritime Prov- inces, 19,721 ; other Quebec provincial areas 1920. Trav-Ler Radio introduced new line of 22 TVs, 40 radios at distributor-dealer meeting in Chicago this week. TV prices range from 17-in. table model at $130 to 21-in. TV-radio-phono combination at $400, company’s first com- bination. A 24-in. table model was reduced from $300 to $200. Pres. Joe Friedman disclosed company plans to enter Canadian TV market in 1955, is currently negotiat- ing for plant in central Canada. Definition of high-fidelity is sought by RETMA in let- ters this week to its high-fidelity equipment members ask- ing them to write their own definitions in 50 words or less. Initiated by Joseph N. Benjamin, Pilot Radio v.p., move is designed to clarify existing confusion on what the term includes, for benefit of industry and consumers. Letters will be discussed at meeting of RETMA high-fidelity sec- tion during Los Angeles Audio Fair in Feb. Radio shipments to dealers, excluding auto radios, totaled 4,416,783 in first 10 months of 1954, according to RETMA state-by-state report released this week and avail- able from RETMA to members on request. Oct. shipments were 639,624, compared to 722,101 in 5-week Sept. Trsdo PsfSOnslS! Clifford J. Hunt, gen. mgr. of Strom- berg-Carlson TV-radio div., elected v.p. in charge; An- thony G.

Plant has 30,000-sq. ft., will eventually turn out 2500-3000 tubes per week, said pres. Thomas Stave. Sears, Roebuck spring catalog, out this week, has TV- radio receiver prices average 5V2% under year ago, as part of overall decline in consumer goods prices. Sir Alexander Aikman has retii'ed as chairman of Elect! ic & Musical Industries Ltd. (EMI), succeeded by J. F. Lockwood. 15 - Electronics Reports: Factory sales of electronic prod- ucts in 1955 should reach $6.1 billion in 1955, compared with an estimated $5.8 billion in 1954. That’s authoritative forecast of Commerce Dept.’s electronics experts, whose predictions in past have often been quite accurate. It’s con- tained in year-end review by Commerce Secy. Sinclair Weeks, who predicts 1955 will see moderate rise in business activity, high employment and increase in living standards. Electronics forecasts were prepared by Commerce Dept.’s Business & Defense Services Administration (BDSA) Electronics Div., headed by Donald S. Parris. At factory level, the predicted $6.1 billion output would approach 1953’s record high electronics production of $6.3 billion, when military expenditures were at peak levels. Products included in estimate are TV-radio re- ceivers, broadcast & communications equipment, tubes & components, and military equipment such as radar, sonar and guided missile systems. Breaking down forecast. Commerce Dept, estimates 1955 color TV receiver factory sales at about $150,000,000 (or 300,000 sets at $500 each), and black-&-white sales at “almost $1 billion” (or about 6,500,000 sets at current average price of around $150). There was no breakdown as between military and civilian production, but most esti- mates place military electronics procurement at annual rate of around $2.5 billion for both 1954 & 1955. Com- merce Dept, estimate differs from RETMA’s slightly lower one (Vol. 10:51) in that Commerce includes factory value of all components, while RETMA considers only replace- ment components. « * * « What happens to the electronics industry in the event of an enemy attack? The ability of electronic and other vital plants to spring back into production, with continuity of management, administration and technical know-how, could mean the difference between victory and defeat. Commerce Dept.’s Business & Defense Services Adminis- tration (BDSA) is waging all-out campaign to emphasize the immediate need for individual company planning — and making available knowledge and experience accumulated in this field by both Govt, and industry. Electronics Div. of BDSA has already met individually with top officers of 25 leading electronics firms to discuss industrial defense plans, and is appealing to other companies in the industry to meet with it for discussions on comprehensive plans to insure continuity of management and rapid resumption of vital production in the event of attack. Corporate defense planning is outlined in new booklet, “Job for Management,” published by BDSA and available from Electronics Div., BDSA, Commerce Dept., Washington 25, D. C. “Unit Territory Plan — to Serve the Jobber Better” is new report based on 18-month study by RETMA jobber relations committee under J. A. (Shine) Milling, exec, v.p., Howard W. Sams & Co., designed to improve distribution of electronic parts through more efficient utilization of manufacturers’ representatives. Copies of report are avail- able to all members of industry, whether or not RETMA members, from RETMA, 777 14th St. N.W., Washington 5, D. C. Carrier Corp., air conditioner manufacturer, enters electronics field through affiliate Cambridge Corp., which begins electronic equipment production this month in new 60,000-sq. ft. plant in Lowell, Mass. “TV telephone,” which enables telephone callers to see one another, was one of prize exhibits at recent com- munications conference in Hull, England. Transistor the size of match-head is now being pro- duced by CBS-Hytron for use in hearing aids. Lowest-priced transistor hearing aid yet: Zenith’s tiny 3-transistor model 75-X, at $76. Motorola renewed patent license agreement with RCA Dec. 30, effective for 5 years — and that ap- pears to leave Admiral & Philco the only majors still unsigned, except of course for litigating Zenith. At press time, Dec. 31, RCA declined to reveal names of companies that have or have not renewed but checkups to date have indicated most have signed. There was even possibility Admiral & Philco would renew at last minute. The late Maj. Edwin H. Armstrong’s infringement suit against RCA & NBC, involving FM patents, was dis- missed by stipulation this week on motion of plaintiff in Federal Judge Paul Leahy’s court in Wilmington. Judge Philip J. McCook, former N. Y. state supreme court justice, acted as arbitrator and fixed amount of settlement at ap- proximately $1,000,000. Mrs. Armstrong, as executrix of the estate of the late inventor, was said to have insisted personally on the out-of-court settlement; she was Gen. Sarnoff ’s secretary in the early days of RCA. Other Armstrong patent infringement suits against Motoi’ola, Wells-Gardner, Radio Craftsman & Sentinel have been ordered to trial before Federal Judge Igoe in Chicago court Jan. 13. On other patent fronts. Judge Knox in Federal court for N. Y. southern district still had under advisement as of Dec. 30 RCA’s motion to change venue of Dept, of Justice’s anti-trust suit to Wilmington (Vol. 10:47-48), and Judge Leahy in Wilmington on Jan. 4 is to set trial date in RCA-Zenith suit. Combination TV-radio-tape recorder may be in works by Raytheon. Dec. Wireless World (London) notes that “the corporation is contemplating developing several new receivers which will incorporate tape recorders and is, therefore, interested in contacting [British] manufacturers who would be willing to supply the basic tape recording chassis without the loudspeaker and other sound repro- ducing equipment.” TV is helping to solve one of most distressing prob- lems of the auto age — finding a place to park. In Oakland, Cal., Downtown Merchants Assn, has installed RCA “TV Eye” industrial TV camera atop light pole overlooking its 225-300-ft. parking lot. It automatically scans entire parking area, enabling attendant in booth to spot vacant spaces by looking on screen of 21-in. set. Navy’s new super-carrier Forrestal uses TV to keep ship’s officers in visual contact with all parts of ship. Fixed TV cameras on flight deck and other key stations flash pictures to screens in below-decks control centers. Ship is also equipped with underwater TV cameras which can be swung over side to inspect hull in case of battle damage. Raytheon has issued new 12-p. brochure describing its basic KTR-100 color TV microwave relay equipment, which carries video & audio simultaneously. It’s bulletin 3-110, available from Dept. 6130, Raytheon, 100 River St., Wal- tham 54, Mass. New 9xl2-ft. projection unit of Fleetwood Corp., To- ledo (Vol. 10:49) will be demonstrated Jan. 6-7 in Room 5A1070, Pentagon, open to public. It’s Model FL-1001, sells for $2350, is designed for closed-circuit or off-air. Size of cigar box, newly designed DuMont “Tel-Eye” industrial TV camera measures 10x6 %x4%, weighs 8% lbs., and is priced at $975. Thomas R. Jones, pres, of Daystrom Inc., Pough- keepsie, N.

REFERENCE USE ONLY DO ?-QT REMOVE FROM N Billings November 1954 and January-November 1954 (For October report, see Television Digest, Vol. 10:49) (For preceding years, see TV Factbook No. 19, p. 15) Three networks achieved new records in TV bill- ings in Nov., according to monthly Publishers Infor- mation Bureau tabulations — CBS-TV jumping to $14,218,- 622, NBC-TV to $12,391,828, ABC-TV to $4,134,103. Month’s total for all networks reached new high of $32,- 141,881 (compared to $23,573,056 in Nov. 1953) to bring 11-month total to $286,648,222, which compares with $202,- 904,049 in same 1953 period. It’s clear now that figure for whole year will be around $320,000,000. Network radio billings, now running about one-third TV, held fairly firm during Nov., compared with recent months, but $11,348,785 agregate total was considerably under the $13,666,932 for Nov. 1953. For 11 months, radio aggregate was $126,379,619 vs. $146,349,762 for same 1953 period. CBS continued to maintain lead in radio, as in TV.

TV cameras won’t be permitted at any House com- mittee hearings, incoming Speaker of House Sam Rayburn (D-Tex.) said Dec. 28, immediately stin-ing protests from industry. Rayburn made similar ruling during 82nd Con- gress (Vol. 8:9), but Speaker Martin (R-Mass.) held dur- ing 83rd Congress that it was up to House committees to determine whether they would permit televising of their hearings. Senate in past has left matter to dis- cretion of individual committees. Following Rayburn’s latest statement, NARTB pres. Harold Fellows wired him asking meeting to discuss matter, adding that broadcasters “have earned and deserve an acknowledged position with all other media in coverage of the public sessions of our legislative bodies.” NARTB’s freedom of information committee, under Edgar Kobak, WTWA, Thomson, Ga., meanwhile sent letters to chairmen of Senate & House Rules Committees requesting early conferences to estab- lish rights of TV-radio in covering legislative hearings. Richard L. Harkness, executive committee chairman of Radio & TV Correspondents Assn. (Congressional gal- leries) also said his group would take up matter with Rayburn on his return to Washington. Amplifying his “minimum controls” philosophy, FCC chairman George McConnaughey stated, in speech before Southern California Broadcasters Assn, in Los Angeles Dec. 30: “Dangerous thinking by wild-eyed theorists was the order of the day in the 1930’s. These theorists de- scended upon Washington with the basic ideas and ideals that the only salvation for this country was for the Fed- eral Govt, to assume a leading role — ^yes, I might add a commanding role, in controlling and regulating the oper- ations of all business enterprises ... I favor as few Govt, controls as possible consistent with the public interest and other considerations required by the Communications Act.” An ardent Ohio State U football fan, McConnaughey went to Rose Bowl game. Vote on 1955 football TV plans will be taken next week as more than 1200 representatives of universities and col- leges convene in New York for NCAA convention. Dele- gates will hear report and recommendations by NCAA’s TV committee, under Harvey Cassell, U of Washington, which is expected to endorse nationwide telecasts again, but with some changes and “liberalization.” This year, TV committee will present 5 alternative TV plans, but is expected to recommend only one. All 3 DuMont-owned stations operated in the black during 1954, reports gen. mgr. Donald McGannon in year- end statement. Average billings ran 16% ahead of 1953 with “comparable composite increases in profit.” Last re- port on WDTV, Pittsburgh, whose sale to Westinghouse for $9,750,000 pends FCC approval, showed 1954 profit be- fore taxes in accounting period to Oct. 10 was $2,439,000 on revenue of $4,153,000, with similar high returns for 1953 & 1952 (see Vol. 10:50, p. 9). No major RCA-NBC staff changes are contemplated at Jan. 7 board meeting, according to latest advices — and we were wrong last week in reporting probable shifting of RCA staff v.p. Mannie Sacks, to new duties at NBC-TV. He will continue with parent RCA organization, continu- ing also as gen. mgr. of RCA Victor Records Div. and as an NBC v.p. paying special attention to talent. NBC is releasing 30-40 TV engineers and technicians in N. Y. as of Dec. 31, mainly men of low seniority, due to curtailment of certain technical operations. There’s no plan, though, to cut back colorcasting schedules during 1955, as rumored. DuMont Network also is dropping about 50 engineers and about 25 in program dept, (see p. 3). Power increases: WJAR-TV, Providence (Ch. 10) to 316-kw ERP; WKRC-TV, Cincinnati (Ch. 12) to 316-kw; WDAK-TV, Columbus, Ga. (Ch. 28) to 234-kw.
