        "text": "When we say free, we mean free. No hidden fees, no commitment, no credit card required.\n\nThe free edition includes everything you need to design, build, and deploy demos, prototypes, or small applications. It includes a deployment environment for each application with unlimited users. You’ll want to upgrade to a paid package if you’d like to get product support and guaranteed availability of your apps for the best user experience.\n\nThat depends on the type and number of apps you’re planning to build. As a general rule of thumb:\n\nFree is to explore the full capabilities of our platform, build prototypes or small applications for personal use. Learn more about Mendix Free\n\nBasic is a good fit for simple applications like automating a spreadsheet or creating a departmental workflow as it offers guaranteed availability (responsiveness, uptime) on Mendix Cloud and access to our Support team. Learn more about Basic.\n\nStandard is suitable for the majority of business applications as it provides all the key features for the application life cycle with deployment in the cloud of your choice.\n\nPremium is ideal for mission-critical applications and core systems, as it comes with enterprise-grade scaling, high-availability, and fallback options with deployment in your cloud of choice.\n\nYou can upgrade to a higher package whenever you want as your application needs grow. Try out our ROI calculator.\n\nThere’s no technical difference between the platform capabilities in the One App and Unlimited App plans. The difference is price. If you’re just starting out or planning to build one large app (eg, Customer, Employee or Supplier portal), you can start with the lower-threshold entry offered by the One App plan. On the other hand, if you have a good idea of the portfolio of apps you want to build, then the Unlimited App plan is better for you.\n\nA user is an individual that has access to applications you make. We do not charge for anonymous users accessing applications made on the Mendix platform. We also do not charge for developers making apps on our platform.\n\nYes. The price per user you pay comes down as the user volume grows. If your apps have external users (eg: users who access the apps at a lower frequency, like for B2B or B2C portals), we offer more attractive pricing for those scenarios. Try out our ROI calculator. For more details, please contact us using the form below.\n\nFor the Basic package, cloud resources are included.\n\nFor the Standard and Premium packages, since Mendix supports various public and private cloud deployment options, we don’t include the compute resources you’ll need in our license price. We will work with you to determine the best deployment options for your specific needs, and determine the cloud resource costs as part of helping you define the best deployment model for your business."
