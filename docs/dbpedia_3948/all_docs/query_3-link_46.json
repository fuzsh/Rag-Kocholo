        "text": "Ever since 2007, Netflix has been one of the biggest players in the world of streaming and has provided the world with such incredible shows and movies as Stranger Things, Black Mirror, Squid Game, Glass Onion, and so many more.\n\nIt may seem like everyone has Netflix, but things have changed a bit since the streamer started cracking down on people sharing their accounts with people outside of their home. It’s also true that there are so many other streaming options these days that many people rightfully need to pick and choose which ones to subscribe to so they can avoid a horrifying monthly bill. If you need to downgrade your plan or cancel your Netflix subscription, it's worth looking at the prices below.\n\nSo, whether you are considering signing up for Netflix for the first time, want to come back for a specific show or movie, need to finally get your own account after sharing one for years and years, or whatever else, this guide will let you know everything you need about Netflix’s current plans to help make that decision as easy as possible for you.\n\nAs of April 2024, Netflix has three plans - Standard with ads, Standard, and Premium - each plan has its pros and cons in regard to features and price, and we will break down each one below, first in a quick bulleted list from Netflix and then in a more detailed version from us below that. Netflix used to have a Basic plan as well for $9.99/month, but the company removed it for new/rejoining users back in July. However, those who were subscribed to the Basic plan before it was scrapped can keep it until they either switch plans or cancel their account.\n\nNetflix Plans and Prices (As of April 2024)\n\n1. Standard with Ads - $6.99/month\n\nAd-supported, all but a few movies and TV shows available, unlimited mobile games\n\nWatch on 2 supported devices at a time\n\nWatch in Full HD\n\n2. Standard - $15.49/month\n\nUnlimited ad-free movies, TV shows, and mobile games\n\nWatch on 2 supported devices at a time\n\nWatch in Full HD\n\nDownload on 2 supported devices at a time\n\nOption to add 1 extra member who doesn't live with you ($7.99/month)\n\nAdd extra member slots for $7.99 each\n\n3. Premium - $22.99/month\n\nUnlimited ad-free movies, TV shows, and mobile games\n\nWatch on 4 supported devices at a time\n\nWatch in Ultra HD\n\nDownload on 6 supported devices at a time\n\nOption to add up to 2 extra members who don't live with you ($7.99/month per user)\n\nNetflix spatial audio\n\nAdd extra member slots for $7.99 each\n\nNetflix Subscriptions Tiers, Explained\n\nStandard with Ads - $6.99/Month\n\nThe lowest-priced Standard with Ads plan was one that had been requested for many years, and Netflix finally released it on November 3, 2022, in the US, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Spain, and the UK.\n\nThe Standard with Ads plan costs $6.99/month and is an ad-supported plan that includes “all but a few movies and TV shows'' and unlimited mobile games like Oxenfree and Spiritfarer. It also allows for subscribers to watch on two supported devices at a time, which means you can be watching two different shows (or the same one!) on two different devices, which is especially useful if you live with other people.\n\nSubscribers of this plan will be able to stream their content in 1080p (Full HD), which is a bump up from the 720p (HD) offered in the basic plan.\n\nStandard - $15.49/month\n\nThe Standard plan is Netflix’s most popular as it gives the best options for those who live in homes with multiple people and like to watch their content at a higher resolution.\n\nWhile it does come with a hefty price hike of $5.50/month over the Basic plan, it does give some important upgrades that make it worth a look. First up, it includes ad-free access to all of Netflix’s content, and subscribers to the Standard plan will be able to stream that content at a resolution of up to 1080p (Full HD). Sure, it’s not the 4K offered in the highest-tier plan, but 1080p is good enough for a lot of people who don’t necessarily care as much about the tech behind streams and just want content that looks good, which it does at 1080p!\n\nThe Standard plan also lets subscribers watch Netflix on two devices at once and download content to two of those devices at a time. This tier also allows you to add one member who lives outside of your home at $7.99/month, which is a good option now that Netflix is cracking down on account sharing. This is very useful, especially if you have family members or friends who don’t live with you that you are supporting or simply just want to gift the treat of Netflix to them.\n\nIt’s also important to note that the members you invite outside of your home will use their own Netflix account and password, you simply just pay to let them use it.\n\nPremium - $22.99/month\n\nThe Premium plan is Netflix’s most expensive tier and offers all the best features the streamer has to offer. Alongside obviously giving subscribers access to Netflix’s entire library, it allows them to watch the content at resolutions up to 4K (Ultra HD), which is great for those who have the latest and greatest TVs.\n\nThe Premium plan also allows for four devices to watch Netflix at a time, which is beneficial for those living with big families or a bunch of friends. It also has the benefit of letting you download Netflix content on up to six devices at once, meaning four people can watch Netflix at once and two others can still watch their downloaded content without anyone running into any errors or getting kicked off.\n\nOne of the other bigger selling points of the Premium plan is Netflix spatial audio, which, according to Netflix, “enhances sound without the need for surround sound speakers or home theater equipment.” Think of spatial audio as a type of 3D audio that makes it so sounds appear in more precise locations and not just from left or right stereo channels.\n\nLastly, you have the option to add up to two extra members who don’t live with you for $7.99/month per user.\n\nFor more from the world of Netflix, check out our list of the best Netflix movies you can watch on the streamer right now, as well as our best of lists for the genres of anime, horror, action, and sci-fi.
