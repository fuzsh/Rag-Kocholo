        "text": "We would like to inform you about upcoming modifications to the Elementor Pro Essential subscription plan, which will impact new purchases of this plan starting December 4th, 2023.\n\nThese changes allow us to increase our investment in the development of the Free and Pro Elementor plugins, and you will be able to build websites that are even more sophisticated, converting, and content-rich.\n\nWhen Will the New Plans Come Into Effect\n\nThe new subscription plans will come into effect on December 4th, 2023.\n\nWhat This Means for You\n\nAs part of this update, the Elementor Pro Advanced, Expert, Agency, and all the Hosting plans will not change. Meaning, these subscriptions will remain as before, with complete access to Elementor Pro existing and upcoming features.\n\nNew Essential Pro subscription plans purchased on December 4th, 2023 or later will follow the new subscription plan breakdown, as detailed below.\n\nIf you’d like to upgrade your Elementor Pro Essential subscription plan, or purchase a new, higher subscription plan, the upcoming Black Friday discounts are the best opportunity for that.\n\nWhy We’re Changing our Subscription Plans\n\nElementor began 7 years ago, starting as a drag and drop page-builder with several widgets that enabled you to add visual elements to your page. Soon after, Elementor introduced more advanced design capabilities, with embedded widgets such as video playlists, and functional widgets such as marketing widgets, dynamic content widgets and WooCommerce features, ultimately becoming a full-fledged website builder.\n\nAll this time every Pro feature and widget Elementor released became available to all Pro plans, with no distinction between the type of features different websites may need. While this resulted in a wide variety of features available in all of our subscription plans, it didn’t provide you with a personalized experience based on the type of capabilities required for each website, and doesn’t reflect the value given from the Elementor Pro plugin.\n\nAs we plan our upcoming product roadmap, and review how we can implement not only additional features you requested, but also new innovative features, we realized that by modifying the Essential Pro subscription, we can better focus our roadmap and invest more to broaden our features. By doing so, we can give you more flexibility, more capabilities, and more features – but more importantly, we can introduce the features you need for your website – in all the tiers of the plugin – Elementor Free and Pro.\n\nIntroducing Elementor Pro’s New Essential Subscription Plan\n\nThe new Elementor Pro Essential subscription plan will give you all the capabilities you need to build a basic website. You’ll get access to 50+ Pro widgets, as well as the Theme Builder so you can edit your header, footer and other theme parts. As part of this plan, you’ll also get basic marketing tools with the Form widget, so you can create any type of form.\n\nGoing forward, when you purchase the new Elementor Pro Essential, you will have all the features you need to create a complete basic website, and also gain access to new features that will be part of the Essential plan. For more professional capabilities like the Popup Builder, ecommerce features including PayPal button, Stripe button, and the full WooCommerce Builder or collaboration tools like Notes or the Role Manager, you will need to upgrade to the Advanced plan or higher.\n\nBelow, you can see a general breakdown of the features available in the new Essential plan, compared to the higher plans.\n\nWe Continue To Be Committed To Your Success and Appreciate Your Support\n\nWith over 15 million websites globally using our product, we are inspired by your creations. These modifications ensure that we can continue to grow alongside you, providing the best product for your needs, regardless of the type of website you need to build.\n\nYour feedback is always important to us, and over the years has greatly influenced our roadmap. As we introduce these upcoming modifications, new plans, and new features, we appreciate your feedback and support."
