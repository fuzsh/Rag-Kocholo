        "text": "1. What is the major difference between Personal and Business Plans?\n\nAdditionally to all the Personal Plan features, the Business Plan allows you to create up to 5 websites on one account and to export the source code of your project. With the Personal Plan, you can only create 1 website per account.\n\n2. Is it possible to assign my domain to a website that was created on Tilda?\n\nYes, you can assign your domain! To learn how to do it, read this guide.\n\n3. What does the \"export source code\" feature in the Business Plan mean?\n\nYour website will be exported to static HTML with all the necessary files (images, css, js). The website will be stored in an archive, and you'll get a link to download it. Just unzip the files and copy them to your server. You'll get a website that will be hosted on your server and will not be dependent on Tilda. To learn more, read this guide.\n\n4. What happens if I don't renew my subscription?\n\nThe website will be unpublished, and the data will be stored on Tilda for 6 months. You can renew the subscription and continue to make changes to your project anytime. If you do not renew your subscription after this period, the data will be deleted.\n\n5. What is the difference between a website and a page?\n\nA website may consist of multiple pages (a portfolio, magazine, blog, etc.), or a single page (a landing page, a longform article, etc). The difference is in the settings: the style (fonts, colors) is assigned to the entire website. Also, the domain is assigned to the entire website, not to every individual page.\n\nTherefore, if you make several landing pages or multimedia articles in the same style (fonts, colors, etc), and host them on the same domain, you can use one single website. However, if you want to make several independent pages with different styles assigned to different domains (for example, landing pages for different clients), you will need multiple websites.\n\n6. Do Tilda websites rank well (appear high in search engine rankings)?\n\nWebsites built on Tilda are perfectly indexed by search engines by default thanks to the features of the platform: the pages consist of sequential blocks. In addition, you can improve your search results using a variety of SEO tools and settings. Read more about SEO in our Help Center.\n\n7. What is White Label?\n\nIf you purchase our annual Personal or Business Plan, you can remove the \"Made on Tilda\" label that is added to all pages by default.\n\n8. Is there any program for nonprofits?\n\nYes, we support nonprofit organizations around the world. Learn more about Tilda Grant for nonprofits."
