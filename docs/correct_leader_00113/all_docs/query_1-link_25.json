        "text": "Lithuania's parliament has impeached the country's President Rolandas Paksas for violating the Lithuanian constitution and his oath of office.\n\nPaksas came under fire in October 2003 when a state security report found links between him and criminal gangs as well as the Russion secret service. The Lithuanian parliament voted in December 2003 for the launch of the impeachment procedure which began on 8 March.\n\nThe charges against Paksas centred on his dealings with a Russian businessman Yuri Borisov. The president granted Lithuanian citizenship to Borisov at his request who, in turn, was the main financial supporter to Paksas' presidential campaign.\n\nOut of the minimum of 85 votes needed of the 141-seat parliament, 86 MPs voted that Paksas illegally granted Lithuanian citizenship to Borisov and leaked state secrets. 89 deputies voted that he improperly meddled in a privatisation deal.\n\nThe constitution gives the opportunity to Paksas, who has served two terms of office both as mayor of Vilnius and as prime minister, to stand again for office. Polls predict he would have a chance of winning.\n\nThe president's impeachment comes a week after Lithuania's accession to NATO and less than a month ahead of its EU membership."
