        "text": "Valdas Adamkus ([ˈvɐ̂ˑɫd̪ɐs ɐˈd̪ɐmˑkʊs] ( listen); born as Voldemaras Adamkavičius, 3 November 1926)[2] is a Lithuanian politician. He was the President of Lithuania from 1998 to 2003 and again from 2004 to 2009.\n\nIn Lithuania, the President's tenure lasts for five years; Adamkus' first term in office began on 26 February 1998 and ended on 28 February 2003, following his defeat by Rolandas Paksas in the next presidential election. Paksas was later impeached and removed from office by a parliamentary vote on 6 April 2004. Soon afterwards, when a new election was announced, Adamkus again ran for president and was re-elected. His approval ratings were high[3] and he was regarded as a moral authority in the state.[4] He was succeeded as the president on 12 July 2009 by Dalia Grybauskaitė.\n\nHe is married to Alma Adamkienė, who is involved in charitable activities in Lithuania. Following the end of his term as president, Adamkus remained involved in international development, and a member of the European Academy of Diplomacy.\n\nBiography[]\n\nAdamkus was born as Voldemaras Adamkavičius (named changed to Valdas Adamkus in 1955)[5] into a Roman Catholic family in Kaunas. His father was one of the first heads of the Lithuanian Air Force School in the Republic of Lithuania. As a young man, Adamkus joined the underground against the first Soviet occupation of 1940. During World War II, his family fled Lithuania in order to avoid the second Soviet occupation in 1944. His uncle was Edvardas Adamkavičius, who was the general in Lithuanian Armed Forces during the interwar period.[6] He attended the University of Munich in Germany before emigrating to the United States in 1949. Fluent in five languages — Lithuanian, Polish, English, Russian, and German — he served as a senior non-commissioned officer with the United States 5th Army Reserve's military intelligence unit in the 1950s. During his youth, Adamkus was interested in track and field. He also set national record at 100 metres running.[7] In 1951, Adamkus got married to Alma Nutautaite. However, they have no children.\n\nAfter arriving in Chicago, Illinois as a displaced person, he worked in an automobile factory and later as a draftsman. Adamkus graduated as a civil engineer from Illinois Institute of Technology in 1961. While a student, Adamkus, together with other Lithuanian Americans, collected about 40,000 signatures petitioning the United States government to intervene in the ongoing deportations of Lithuanians to Siberia by the Soviets.[8] The petition was presented to then-Vice President Richard Nixon. Adamkus also raised concerns about other Soviet activities in occupied Lithuania to United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld in 1958, and to President John F. Kennedy in 1962.[8]\n\nCareer in the United States Environmental Protection Agency[]\n\nHe joined the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at its inception in 1970, working in Cincinnati. In 1981, he was appointed regional administrator by President Ronald Reagan, and was responsible for all air, water, hazardous waste, and other pollution control programs in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. In 1985, President Reagan presented him with the Distinguished Executive Presidential Rank Award – the highest honor that can be bestowed upon a civil servant.\n\nIn 1972, Adamkus visited Lithuania for the first time in almost thirty years. He was a member of the official delegation from the United States attending an environmental conference in Moscow. As perestroika took root in the Soviet Union, Adamkus's visits to his homeland became more frequent. Valdas Adamkus served as regional administrator of the EPA for sixteen years, and retired in 1997, after twenty-nine years of service. Upon his retirement, he received a congratulatory letter from President Clinton and a Distinguished Career Award from EPA Administrator Carol Browner. EPA Region 5 presented him with the newly established \"Valdas V. Adamkus Sustained Commitment to the Environment Honor Award\".\n\nLithuanian presidency, 1998–2003[]\n\nShortly after leaving the EPA, Valdas Adamkus moved back to Lithuania. Soon after his decision to run for presidency in 1998, he faced a legal battle in the Lithuanian courts, as doubts arose whether Adamkus was eligible to run for presidency due to the length of time he had spent abroad and the possibility that he might not meet minimum residency requirements. However, the court resolved the case in Adamkus' favor and no other obstacles remained other than his U.S. citizenship, which he officially renounced at the American Embassy in Vilnius.[9] He was elected as President of Lithuania in 1998, defeating Artūras Paulauskas in the runoff, serving from then until 2003, when he ran for re-election, but was unexpectedly defeated by Rolandas Paksas. He returned to politics as surprisingly as he had left, after the presidential scandal of 2003/2004, when his former rival Paksas was impeached and removed from office. Adamkus ran for the presidency again and was re-elected.\n\nThe first round of the 2004 election was held on 13 June 2004, with Adamkus securing 30% of the vote – more than any other candidate. Paksas could not run for office again, because a ruling from Lithuania's Constitutional Court disallowed him from running for public office and he was, therefore, unable to register as a candidate. A runoff election was held on 27 June 2004, which Adamkus won with about 52% of the votes against Kazimira Prunskienė. By 2009 he had served the two presidential terms permitted by the Constitution of Lithuania and was succeeded as president by Dalia Grybauskaite.\n\nIn 2003 Valdas Adamkus was named UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for the Construction of Knowledge Societies. The Director-General of UNESCO, Koïchiro Matsuura, noted that Adamkus was named as Ambassador \"in recognition of his dedication to the Organization's aims and ideals and with a view to benefiting for the construction of knowledge societies from his wisdom and extensive experience in many of UNESCO's areas of concern, in particular promotion of social development, cultural diversity, dialogue and international cooperation.\"[10]\n\nLithuanian presidency, 2004–09[]\n\nForeign affairs[]\n\nUnder the presidency of Valdas Adamkus, Lithuania actively promoted democracy in the formerly Soviet Eastern European and Asian nations. President Adamkus, together with President Aleksander Kwaśniewski, Javier Solana, Boris Gryzlov and Ján Kubiš, served as a mediator during Ukraine's political crisis, when two candidates in the 2004 presidential election, Viktor Yanukovych and Viktor Yushchenko, each claimed victory. President Adamkus recalled in an interview that \"when I asked what we could do to help, Kuchma said the friends of the Ukrainian people should drop whatever they were doing and come to Kiev immediately.\".[11] The next day international mediators met in Ukraine. The crisis was resolved after a new election was held.\n\nValdas Adamkus and his Estonian counterpart Arnold Rüütel rejected an invitation to participate in a commemorative celebration of the end of World War II in Europe in 2005. President Adamkus expressed the view that the war's end, in Lithuania, marked the beginning of a fifty-year Soviet occupation and repression. In response, on 22 July, the United States Congress unanimously passed a resolution that Russia should \"issue a clear and unambiguous statement of admission and condemnation of the illegal occupation and annexation by the Soviet Union from 1940 to 1991 of the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania\",[12] but Russia refused.\n\nPresident Adamkus supported an active dialogue between European Union member states and those former Soviet republics such as Georgia, Ukraine, and Moldova, that are actively seeking membership in the EU. He expressed support for these candidate members during the Community of Democratic Choice in 2005, at the Vilnius Conference 2006, and on several other occasions.\n\nValdas Adamkus is an Honorary Member of The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation.\n\nDomestic affairs[]\n\nValdas Adamkus enjoyed a very high approval rating in Lithuania. He was also recognized for the second time for his support of Lithuanian youth. President Adamkus was actively involved in government reorganizations in 2004 and 2006. In his 2006 State of the Nation address,[13] Adamkus stated that his top priorities were:\n\nIncreasing public participation in the political realm\n\nTargeted and transparent use of the EU funds and opportunities for building a greater well-being in Lithuania\n\nReforms in public governance, education and science, social support and health care\n\nThe development of professional competence among civil servants, especially in assessing regulatory impacts\n\nApproval of a political code of ethics\n\nDirect mayoral elections, and elimination of the county system\n\nConstruction of a new nuclear power unit in Ignalina\n\nLegislation regulating the selection, appointment, and promotion of judges\n\nControlling \"brain drain\" by supporting research and higher education infrastructure\n\nHonours and awards[]\n\nValdas Adamkus has been honored with the following decorations:\n\nYear Award Issuer 1985 President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service United States 1998 Grand Cross of the Order of the Falcon[14] Iceland 1998 Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav Norway 1998 Member First Class of the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise Ukraine 1999 Collar of the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana Estonia 1999 Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer Greece 1999 Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic Italy 1999 Knight of the Order of the White Eagle Poland 1999 Grand Cross of the Order for the Services[Clarification needed] Malta 1999 Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary[Clarification needed] Hungary 2000 Recipient 1st class of the Order of Friendship Kazakhstan 2001 Commander Grand Cross with Chain of the Order of Three Stars Latvia 2001 Grand Cross of the Order of the Legion of Honour France 2001 Sash of the Order of the Star of Romania Romania 2002 Recipient of the Order of St. Meshrop Mashtots Armenia 2002 Collar and the Grand Cross of the Order of the White Rose Finland 2002 Member of the Order For Special Merits[Clarification needed] Uzbekistan 2002 St Andrew 'Dialogue of Civilisation' prize laureate[Clarification needed] Russia 2003 Recipient of the Order of Vytautas the Great with Golden Chain Lithuania 2004 Collar of the Order of the White Star Estonia 2005 Dame of the Collar of the Order of Isabel the Catholic[Clarification needed] Kingdom of Spain 2005 Grand Cross Special Class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Germany 2006 Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold Kingdom of Belgium 2006 Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath United Kingdom 2006 Member First Class of the Order of Merit Ukraine 2007 Member of the Order of Mother Theresa Albania 2007 Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum Japan 2007 Recipient of the St. George's Victory Order Georgia 2007 European of the Year 2008 Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Netherlands Lion Netherlands 2008 Collar of the Order of the Merit of Chile Republic of Chile 2009 Grand Star of the Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria Austria 2009 Member of the Order of Stara Planina Bulgaria 2009 Recipient of the Order of Liberty Ukraine\n\nHonorary doctorates[]\n\nValdas Adamkus holds honorary doctorates at universities in Lithuania, the United States and other countries, including:\n\nVilnius University, 1989.\n\nIndiana St. Joseph's College, USA, 1991.\n\nNorthwestern University, USA, 1994.\n\nKaunas University of Technology, 1998,\n\nThe Catholic University of America, USA, 1998.\n\nLithuanian University of Agriculture, 1999.\n\nIllinois Institute of Technology, 1999.\n\nEurasian University, Kazakhstan, 2000.\n\nDePaul University, USA, 2001.\n\nLaw University of Lithuania, 2001.\n\nVytautas Magnus University, 2002.\n\nLithuanian Academy of Physical Education, 2004.\n\nYerevan State University, Armenia, 2006.\n\nBaku State University, Azerbaijan 2006.\n\nDonetsk University, Ukraine, 2006.\n\nUniversity of Notre Dame, USA, 2007.\n\nNicolaus Copernicus University, Poland, 2007.\n\nTallinn University, Estonia, 2008.\n\nUniversity of Chile, Chile, 2008.\n\nKlaipėda University, 2008.\n\nJohn Paul II Catholic University, Poland, 2009.\n\nISM University of Management and Economics, 2009.\n\nSee also[]\n\nList of presidents of Lithuania\n\nPresidential Palace, Vilnius\n\nHistorical Presidential Palace, Kaunas\n\nReferences[]\n\nFurther reading[]\n\nFredriksen, John C. ed.
