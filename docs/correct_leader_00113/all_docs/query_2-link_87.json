        "text": "The 2008 elections were held in parallel with a consultative referendum on the Ignalina nuclear power plant. This plant had been earmarked for closure by the end of 2009 as one of the conditions for accession to the European Union in 2004. The government was seeking voters' views on a request for a possible extension of this deadline to 2012. The elections were held against a background of rising inflation following two years of prosperity.\n\nIn the previous elections held in October 2004 the Labour Party (DP) led by wealthy Russian-born businessman Mr. Viktor Uspaskich became the largest party winning a total of 39 seats in the 141-member parliament. The outgoing governing coalition Working for Lithuania won 31 seats. It comprised the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party (LSDP formerly the Communist Party) and the Social Liberal Party (SLP) led respectively by Prime Minister Algirdas Brazauskas and Speaker Arturas Paulauskas. The Homeland Union (TS) and the Liberal Centre Union took 25 and 18 seats respectively. After lengthy power-sharing negotiations Mr. Brazauskas (LSDP) was re-elected Prime Minister on 14 December. He subsequently formed a new coalition government comprising the LSDP the SLP the DP and the Union of Farmers' Party and New Democracy Party.\n\nPolice investigations initiated into the DP's finances in May 2006 sparked a crisis that led its leader Mr. Uspaskich to leave the country for Russia where he stayed until May 2008. DP ministers also resigned from the government in protest against criticism by President Valdas Adamkus. Following the subsequent resignation of Prime Minister Brazauskas (LSDP) and his entire cabinet a new caretaker prime minister was appointed in the person of the outgoing Minister of Finance Zigmantas Balcytis (LSDP). His appointment was rejected by Parliament after some members sought clarification about his activities as the head of the Communist Youth Union during the Soviet era and an alleged attempt to join the KGB. In early July former defence minister Mr. Gediminas Kirkilas (LSDP) became the country's eleventh Prime Minister since it gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nMay 2008 also saw the formation of two new parties: the TS-LKD (the result of a merger between the Homeland Union and the Lithuanian Christian Democrats) under the leadership of former prime minister Mr. Andrius Kubilius; and the Rising Nation Party (RNP) formed by TV show host and lawyer Mr. Arunas Valinskas.\n\nIn all 1 583 candidates (including 456 women) from 20 parties and coalitions ran for the 2008 elections.\n\nPrime Minister Kirkilas pledged to introduce progressive taxation. He also argued that the country should introduce the euro in 2011. He vowed to leave the LSDP if it lost the elections.\n\nTS-LKD leader Mr. Kubilius pledged to continue to negotiate with the European Commission (EC) to extend the Ignalina nuclear plant's deadline for closure. The party also promised to introduce the euro without specifying any date. It promised to cut income tax by introducing a land tax.\n\nThe Order and Justice Party (Liberal Democratic Party) led by former president Rolandas Paksas who had been impeached in April 2004 over a bribe-taking scandal advocated maintaining pragmatic ties with Moscow. Mr. Paksas promised to hold a referendum on the adoption of the euro.\n\nThe DP was led by Mr. Uspaskich who was barred from leaving Lithuania until the investigation into party finances was completed. The DP which has its stronghold in small towns campaigned for pro-market policies with more security for small and medium-sized businesses. It formed a coalition with the Youth Party under the name Labour Party + Youth Coalition.\n\nRNP leader Valinskas dismissed criticism accusing him of ÂshowbizÂ politics and ruled out the possibility of forming a coalition government with the Order and Justice Party (Liberal Democratic Party).\n\nPre-election polls showed the TS-LKD in the lead.\n\nOn 12 October 48.6 per cent of the nearly 2.7 million registered voters turned out at the polls.\n\nSeven parties surpassed the five per cent threshold to win a share of the 70 seats available under the proportional representation (PR) system. The TS-LKD won 18 of the PR seats. The RNP surprised many observers by coming in second with 13 seats followed by the Order and Justice Party (Liberal Democratic Party) with 11 seats. The LSDP took ten seats. The Labour Party + Youth Coalition won eight seats. The Liberals' Movement of the Republic of Lithuania (led by Mr. Eligijus Masiulis) and the Liberal and Centre Union (led by former mayor of Vilnus Mr. Arturas Zuokas) took five seats each.\n\nAs for the 71 members elected by the majority system only three candidates won the absolute majority of votes required to be elected in the first round. Among the three candidates elected two were from the LSDP and one was from the Lithuanian Poles' Electoral Action a party representing the Polish minority in Lithuania.\n\nRun-off elections for 68 remaining seats were held on 26 October. The final results gave 45 seats to the TS-LKD and 25 seats to the LSDP. The RNP took 16 seats. In all 25 women were elected.\n\nIn the referendum on the Ignalina nuclear power plant 88.56 per cent of voters approved the extension of the lifetime of the plant. However turnout was below the 50 per cent required to validate the referendum.\n\nThe newly elected parliament held its first session on 18 November and elected Mr. Arunas Valinskas (RNP) as its new Speaker.\n\nIn the meantime on 17 November Mr. Kubilius signed an official agreement to form a coalition government with his TS-LKD the RNP the Liberals Movement of the Republic of Lithuania and the Liberal and Centre Union. On 20 November President Adamkus signed a decree proposing the candidature of Mr. Kubilius for the position of the Prime Minister. His nomination was confirmed by the Seimas on 27 November."
