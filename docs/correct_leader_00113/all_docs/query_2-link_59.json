        "text": "The president, whose main competencies as head of state pertain to foreign affairs, is directly elected for up to two five-year terms. The prime minister, who as head of government holds most executive authority, is appointed by the president with the approval of the parliament.\n\nCentrist nonpartisan candidate Gitanas Nausėda was elected as the new president in 2019 after his predecessor, Dalia Grybauskaitė, completed her second term of office. Nausėda took 66 percent of the vote in the runoff round, defeating Ingrida Šimonytė, an independent lawmaker backed by the TS-LKD, who took 33 percent. Šimonytė was appointed as prime minister following the October 2020 parliamentary elections and took office in December. Both the presidential election and the appointment of the prime minister were in accordance with democratic standards.\n\nThe unicameral, 141-seat Seimas (parliament) consists of 71 members elected in single-mandate constituencies and 70 chosen by proportional representation, all for four-year terms.\n\nIn the October 2020 elections, the center-right opposition TS-LKD captured 50 seats, leaving the incumbent centrist-populist Farmers and Greens Union (LVŽS) in second place with 32 seats. Another centrist-populist party, the Labor Party, won 10 seats, while the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party (LSDP) received 13. The junior coalition partners in the LVŽS government—Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania–Christian Families Alliance (LLRA-KŠS) and the Lithuanian Social Democratic Labor Party (LSDLP)—won three seats each. Two liberal and business-oriented parties—the Liberal Movement and the Freedom Party—won 13 and 11 seats, respectively, and formed a new governing coalition with the TS-LKD in November.\n\nThe elections were considered free and fair, with few irregularities reported. However, the outgoing LVŽS government’s decision to distribute cash benefits for pensioners and other social groups just before the balloting was widely criticized as politically motivated.\n\nPolitical parties generally operate freely. Citizens of other European Union (EU) member states are eligible to join Lithuanian political parties but cannot found them.\n\nSmall parties and some civic organizations argue that the minimum number of members for political parties (2,000) is a burdensome requirement that hampers the creation of new parties and the maintenance of small ones. Public funding rules generally favor the main parliamentary forces, as private financing of political organizations is tightly restricted. The state subsidies are calculated according to the results of the previous elections and represent the main source of revenue for parties. Public election committees—a way for groups of citizens to run for municipal councils without joining or establishing a political party—have been an option since 2010, though they are not permitted for parliamentary elections.\n\nThere are no formal restrictions on the political participation of women, LGBT+ people, or members of ethnic, religious, and other minority groups. Women and women’s interests remain underrepresented in politics, though women candidates won 27 percent of the seats in the October 2020 parliamentary elections—an increase from 21 percent in the previous Seimas. Moreover, the three main leaders of the new governing coalition were women, including Prime Minister Šimonytė and Seimas speaker Viktorija Čmilytė-Nielsen, who heads the Liberal Movement. Šimonytė’s cabinet approached gender balance, with women holding six of the 14 ministerial posts.\n\nPolitical parties that are supportive of equal rights for LGBT+ people increased their parliamentary representation in 2020. The Freedom Party, founded in 2019, campaigned for marriage equality and had an openly gay candidate among its leaders, garnering 9 percent of the national vote.\n\nThe LLRA-KŠS, which represents members of the ethnic Polish minority, failed to clear the 5 percent vote threshold for proportional-representation seats in 2020, having succeeded in the 2012 and 2016 Seimas elections. Nevertheless, it captured three seats in single-mandate districts.\n\nThe government generally respects freedom of the press, and the media market is vibrant. However, the increasing concentration of media ownership in the hands of a small number of companies raises the risk of editorial interference by powerful political and business interests. Journalists often engage in self-censorship when reporting on certain large companies. The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 left the media more vulnerable to undue influence.\n\nIn July, the Radio and Television Commission of Lithuania banned five television channels operated by the Russian state-owned network RT, following a recommendation from the Foreign Ministry. It cited links between RT and Dmitry Kiselyov, who heads another Russian state media group and had been sanctioned by the EU. Reporters Without Borders criticized the ban.\n\nIn October, the Court of Appeal found former Lithuanian president Rolandas Paksas and Lietuvos Rytas media group owner Gedvydas Vainauskas guilty in an influence-peddling case. Vainauskas, who received a fine, was accused of bribing Paksas, who received a suspended three-year prison sentence, to help secure regulators’ support for a business project in 2015. An appeal to the Supreme Court was pending at year’s end.\n\nBecause of a vaguely worded law restricting the dissemination of information that “abases family values,” public and private media outlets have faced pressure to limit coverage of the LGBT+ community and its interests.\n\nScore Change: The score declined from 4 to 3 because journalists’ autonomy has been curtailed in recent years by ongoing consolidation of media ownership and related editorial pressure to support owners’ business and political interests.\n\nWorkers have the right to form and join trade unions and engage in collective bargaining, though there have been reports of employees being punished for attempting to organize. Less than 10 percent of workers are trade union members, and the share of workers covered by collective agreements is similarly low. Changes to the labor code in 2017 required employers with at least 20 workers to initiate the election of a work council to represent employees’ interests, if a union was not already established, though only unions can engage in collective bargaining. Strikes are relatively uncommon due to strict regulations, lack of strike funds, and the absence of a culture of industrial action.\n\nAlthough public confidence in the courts has been steadily improving in recent years, judicial corruption remains a significant concern. An extensive bribery scandal in 2019 led to criminal charges against eight senior judges, including a member of the Supreme Court.\n\nIn April 2020, the parliament rejected all three of the proposed candidates to replace three outgoing judges of the Constitutional Court, including its chairperson; the three were nominated by the president, the Seimas speaker, and the acting head of the Supreme Court, respectively. Lawmakers also rejected a permanent appointment for the acting Supreme Court chief, which had been proposed by President Nausėda. The votes left both of the country’s highest judicial institutions without permanent leadership at the end of the year.\n\nThe population is largely free from major threats to physical security, and the homicide rate has declined in recent years, though it remains one of the highest in the EU, according to the statistics agency Eurostat.\n\nAlthough the government has taken measures to improve the situation, conditions at some prisons are substandard, violence among prisoners remains a problem, and physical abuse of prisoners by correctional officers persists.\n\nThe constitution guarantees equality before the law and forbids discrimination based on gender, race, language, and other categories. The laws provide similar protections, including against discrimination based on sexual orientation, though gender identity is not addressed. In practice, women generally earn less than men per hour worked, and both LGBT+ people and members of the Romany minority experience societal discrimination. Ethnic Poles and members of other national minority groups have objected to limits on the use of their languages; public signs must be written only in Lithuanian, even in areas predominantly inhabited by people who speak different languages."
