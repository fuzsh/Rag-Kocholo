        "text": "Rolandas Paksas EN\n\nEU Commissioner Andriukaitis: Paksas should not be held hostage to the situation\n\nLithuania should adopt constitutional amendments to allow Rolandas Paksas, the impeached former president, to run for elected office, says Vytenis Andriukaitis, European commissioner for health and food safety and member of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania. However, he is critical of a recent resolution passed by the Lithuanian parliament, advocating Paksas’ rehabilitation. […]\n\nParliament endorses resolution blaming Constitutional Court for violating rights of impeached president Paksas\n\nThe Seimas, the Lithuanian Parliament, has approved the findings of the ad hoc commission tasked with probing the implementation of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) decision in the case of impeached former president Rolandas Paksas. […]\n\nLithuania may face fines after blocking Paksas from running for office, says PM\n\nLithuania may face fines following the decision by parliamentarians not to allow former Lithuanian president Rolandas Paksas to run again for elected office, according to Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevičius. […]\n\nFailed Paksas vote was calculated move by Labour Party, observer says\n\nA failed vote in the Lithuanian Seimas on Tuesday will prevent the leader of the ruling Order and Justice party, Rolandas Paksas, to run for parliament in next year’s elections. Observers say the situation has been engineered by the Labour Party which wants to steal Paksas’ voters. […]\n\nCurrent leaders among most trustes public figures in Lithuania\n\nFor several months in a row, Lithuanians trust most the current leaders of the country, the latest poll shows. Political experts link this to a stable political and economic situation in the country and the leaders’ authority. […]\n\nLithuanian MEPs have split opinion over EU refugee plan\n\nAt the European Parliament (EP) vote in Brussels on Thursday on distribution of 120,000 refugees among European Union (EU) member-states, the opinions of Lithuanian MEPs split. […]\n\nLithuanian parliament backs ‘Paksas amendment’\n\nThe Seimas of Lithuania on Thursday gave its initial backing to a constitutional amendment that will allow Rolandas Paksas, leader of the Order and Justice party, to run for parliament and president. […]\n\nLithuania’s incumbent MP most popular candidate to continue in the post\n\nWith a full year still remaining until the next Lithuanian parliamentary elections, incumbent Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevičius retains high approving rates. The majority of surveyed voters, 20.9 percent, believe he would be the best candidate for prime minister, a recent survey showed. […]\n\nLithuanian opposition parties to snub national agreement on emigration\n\nA national agreement on emigration, initiated by Lithuania’s ruling Order and Justice party, has failed to secure the support of the country’s key political parties. Major opposition parties have no plans of signing it, the Lietuvos Žinios daily reports. […]\n\nTwo bills regarding impeached president fail to reach Lithuanian parliament’s agenda\n\nTwo bills opening the way for impeached and removed Lithuanian president Rolandas Paksas to run for parliament were to be presented for parliamentary deliberation on Thursday, but were removed from the agenda at the last minute. […]\n\nGood news for Paksas from the Seimas\n\nLithuania’s Seimas on Thursday gave its initial backing to a constitutional amendment that would allow leader of the Order and Justice party Rolandas Paksas who was impeached and removed as president to run for parliament and president. […]\n\nRuling bloc to submit amendment to pave way for Paksas to elections\n\nLithuania‘s ruling parties intend to shortly again submit a Constitutional amendment to the parliament to pave way for removed president Rolandas Paksas to run for parliament and president. […]\n\nLithuanian parliament moves to amend Constitution to allow Paksas to run for office\n\nA hundred Lithuanian MPs have drafted Constitutional amendments that should pave the way for Rolandas Paksas, a member of the ruling Order and Justice party who has been impeached as president in 2004 and banned from running for public office since then, to run for parliament and president again. […]\n\nLithuania urged to implement ECHR rulings on sex change and ousted president\n\nLithuania’s representative at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Karolina Bubnytė has urged state institutions to focus its efforts on the implementation of the court’s rulings on sex change surgeries and the right for ousted president Rolandas Paksas to run for elections.
