        "text": "VILNIUS, Lithuania (Reuters) -- A political crisis surrounding Lithuanian President Rolandas Paksas, in trouble after an unpublished security report linked his office to organised crime, widened on Saturday as further details emerged.\n\nExcerpts from the report by the Lithuanian State Security Department (VSD) were published in a special edition of the newspaper Respublika, giving examples of the connection between Paksas's office and international crime.\n\n\"The information which VSD has gathered allows it to be stated that Lithuania is used as a third party for the trade and distribution of arms as well as forbidden and dual-use materials,\" the newspaper quoted the report as saying.\n\n\"Lithuania is also used as a third country to carry out illegal financial operations (contraband, money laundering) for the financing of international terrorism,\" it added.\n\nThe president holds little formal power in domestic affairs, but oversees Lithuania's foreign policy and is seen as a key figure in preparations to join NATO and the European Union.\n\nThe small nation of 3.5 million is due to join both blocs next year, marking the culmination of painful reforms since independence from Soviet rule in 1991.\n\nPresidential spokesman Rosvaldas Gorbaciovas told Reuters Paksas would issue a statement in response to the partial publication of the report.\n\n\"The president considers the (Respublika) issue -- however legal it may or may not be -- as having already taken this matter public to a certain extent,\" he said.\n\n\"Paksas said it shows that the whole thing has been unnecessarily overblown,\" Gorbaciovas added.\n\nAsked about issues of arms trade and financial crimes, Gorbaciovas said: \"This may be an East-West affair, time will tell, but I don't want to get in to that now.\"\n\nPaksas promised Lithuanians on Friday he had broken no laws, but his opponents said the president still bore political blame for the scandal, dubbed \"Lithuania's Watergate.\"\n\nThe president has repeatedly denied that he had any links to the criminal world since news of the report broke late on Thursday, but suspended his security adviser Remigijus Acas, who is named in the report by the government security services.\n\nAcas has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nLithuanian media said on Friday the report included conversations taped by intelligence agencies purporting to involve associates of Paksas discussing \"election promises\" with representatives of Russian organised crime.\n\nPrime Minister Algirdas Brazauskas stood behind Paksas, telling reporters on Friday he saw no grounds for impeaching the president. He called for a thorough investigation.\n\nThe constitution allows parliament to impeach a president and then call fresh elections, installing the speaker as acting head of state. Parliament will meet in emergency session on Monday to discuss the affair.\n\nPaksas, a former stunt pilot, beat incumbent Valdas Adamkus to the presidency in January elections by appealing to all those who had lost out in the transition from Soviet republic to free-market democracy.\n\nClick Here to try 4 Free Trial Issues of Time!"
