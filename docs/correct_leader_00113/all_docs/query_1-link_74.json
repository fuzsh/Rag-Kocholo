        "text": "President Rolandas Paksas denies any wrongdoing\n\nSenior politicians in Lithuania say they have enough signatures to impeach President Rolandas Paksas.\n\nPrime Minister Algirdas Brazauskas and parliamentary speaker Arturas Paulauskas said at least 85 members supported impeachment in parliament.\n\nThirty-six were needed to start proceedings in the 141-member chamber.\n\nMr Paksas is accused of violating the constitution and having links with organised crime - he has denied the allegations and vowed to stay on.\n\nThe impeachment document says Mr Paksas posed a threat to national security, leaked state secrets, obstructed the work of state institutions and let top aides abuse their office.\n\nBelgian cool\n\nTo oust the president, a majority of 86 deputies is needed.\n\nOfficials say impeachment proceedings could start on Thursday and last up to six months.\n\nThe scandal comes as Lithuania prepares to join the European Union and Nato next year.\n\nIn recent weeks there have already been big demonstrations in the capital Vilnius, calling for Mr Paksas to resign.\n\nHowever the president - a former Soviet aerobatics champion - has resisted the calls.\n\n\"I'm as calm as a Belgian,\" Mr Paksas recently said, using a traditional Lithuanian phrase."
