        "text": "As the results came in and it became obvious Paksas would win, he announced that he would give top priority to renegotiating the terms of Lithuania’s EU membership.\n\n“My first visit will be to Brussels to meet EU leaders and clarify the situation on certain points that do not satisfy me,” he told reporters, mentioning Ignalina and farm aid in particular.\n\nHowever, analysts quickly pointed out that Lithuania’s membership negotiations were theoretically closed at last December’s EU summit in Copenhagen, when the country was formally invited to join the Union in 2004.\n\n“It is obvious that the resumption of talks would leave Lithuania but one option – to stay barred from the European Union for another three years, thus putting off the assistance of the rich European states to Lithuania and especially to those people who voted for Paksas’ generous promises of a better life,” wrote Lithuanian newspaper Lietuvos Rytas in a stinging editorial shortly after his victory.\n\nExperts at the European Commission have also confirmed that, while Lithuania\n\nis a sovereign country, the terms of its EU accession have in principle already been agreed.\n\nOther experts argue that, despite his bravado, Paksas is aware of the realities of Lithuanian politics and unlikely to jeopardise the country’s EU membership bid just to increase his own personal standing.\n\nHe has been mayor of Vilnius and twice served as prime minister, so has first-hand experience of the tortuous negotiations that led to his homeland being invited to join the Union in 2004.\n\n“During his first mandate Lithuania was invited to start negotiations with the EU and in his second term the country moved into the group of front runners for EU membership,” recalls the Commission expert.\n\nPaksas’ two terms as prime minister both ended in resignation, which has led some of his critics to brand him a ‘quitter’. In 1999 he walked out in protest\n\nat plans to sell a 33% share in the state-run Maziekui Nafta oil refinery to US petrochemicals giant Williams International.\n\nMany Lithuanians backed his stand and he was reappointed premier\n\nAdvertisement\n\nfollowing elections in 2000. But his second premiership came to an\n\ninglorious end the following year after political infighting saw six of his\n\nministers resign en masse, forcing Paksas himself to step down after just eight months at the helm.\n\nWhile much still remains uncertain about what kind of president Paksas will be, it is already clear that he is one of the most colourful politicians Lithuania has seen for a long time.\n\nFor a recent publicity stunt he flew a single-engined plane under one of Vilnius’ bridges. And during his campaign, he piloted himself from meeting to meeting in a helicopter loaned by Avia Baltika, the Russian-backed company that bankrolled much of his presidential bid.\n\nPaksas was a pilot and flight instructor in the former Soviet Union’s airforce. He joined at the age of 24 after completing his studies at the Civil and Industrial Engineering Institute in Vilnius and served for six years. During this time he learned the stunt skills that have helped to put him in the political limelight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd despite the gravity of his new post, Paksas has made it clear that he still intends to take to the skies as often as possible.\n\n“I was flying while mayor of Vilnius and I did so as prime minister,” he told journalists recently, adding: “I will be flying as president.”\n\nAs if Paksas’ penchant for aerobatics were not enough to give nightmares to his security guards and his family – he is married with two children – the new president is also a keen biker.\n\n“He rides his motorbike whenever he can,” said one Lithuanian diplomat, who nonetheless added that Paksas would be unlikely to take to two wheels for his presidential duties.\n\nBut some analysts have warned that, while his daredevil image may be\n\npopular at home, Paskas will find it more difficult to impress foreign audiences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“His only fluent foreign language is Russian, and he lacks the intellect of his colleagues in next-door countries, such as Latvia’s steely Vaira Vike-Freiberga or Poland’s suave Alexander Kwasniewski,” the Economist wrote recently.\n\nInstead, some critics see Paskas as the Lithuanian equivalent of notorious nationalists like France’s Jean-Marie Le Pen or Russia’s Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Whether this is fair remains to be seen.\n\nMany experts seem to think that while the new Lithuanian president is right wing he is not a Le Pen-style extremist.\n\n“I certainly didn’t get that feeling,” argues Gordon Adam, who visited Lithuania as the election campaign was hotting up.\n\nThe MEP agreed that Paksas was “certainly to the right of the present government”, but insisted that there was a difference between the right and the extreme right.\n\nJust how Paksas intends to put his populist campaign pledges into practice will only become clear over time. But at least as far as the question of EU membership is concerned we should have a clearer idea pretty soon – Paksas intends to pay a flying visit to Brussels on 19 March.\n\nAdvertisement"
