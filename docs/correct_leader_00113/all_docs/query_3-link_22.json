        "text": "The Lithuanian president Rolandas Paksas, who is under pressure to quit over alleged links to organised crime, faces the threat of formal impeachment charges in parliament today after a damning report into his probity.\n\nAides to the Baltic republic's leader were insistent he would not step down because of allegations of links with Russian mobsters. But the pressure increased on Mr Paksas after a parliamentary investigative committee concluded he was a threat to national security and had personally leaked sensitive information through his associations.\n\n\"The conclusions of the investigation are clear, strict and unfavourable to the president,\" the parliamentary speaker, Arturas Paulauskas, said.\n\nThe nine-member panel voted 7-1 to accept the report's conclusions, with one abstention. The lone dissenter, Dailis Barakauskas, of the Liberal Democratic party, accused the panel of bias and said he saw no threats to the country.\n\nThe prime minister, Algirdas Brazauskas, also played down the suggestion of a threat to national security.\n\nBut he added: \"If I was the president, I would resign.\"\n\nThe committee will formally submit its findings today to lawmakers in the Seimas, or parliament, which is widely expected to start impeachment proceedings.\n\nPresident Paksas, a former stunt pilot champion who won a surprise victory in the presidential election in January, has denied any wrongdoing and refuses to step down.\n\nThe report said the president's office had \"inappropriate\" ties to a businessman, Yury Borisov.\n\nIt added that Mr Paksas had been \"influenced\" by Mr Borisov and had helped him obtain Lithuanian citizenship in April, just months after the president was installed.\n\nA separate criminal investigation was launched against Mr Borisov - who donated 1.2m litas (Â£240,000) to Mr Paksas's campaign last year - after police said he was suspected of trying to blackmail the 47-year-old president for political favours.\n\nMr Borisov, who also has Russian citizenship, has denied the claims. His passports have been seized and he is unable to leave the country.\n\nThe parliamentary body repeatedly asked Mr Paksas to testify, but he refused. Two weeks ago, however, he did testify before prosecutors investigating the blackmail charges.\n\nTo start impeachment proceedings against the president, 36 MPs in the 141-seat parliament must vote in favour, but 86 votes will be needed to oust him. Analysts say there is enough support to start the process.\n\n\"If there is a real basis to start impeachment, our party would vote to oust the president\" said Vytenis Andriukaitis, a leader of the Social Democrats, which shares power in a two-party centre-left coalition with the Social Liberals.\n\nThe scandal, which broke in October, has shaken Lithuania, which is to join the EU and Nato next year.\n\nMore than 5,000 people marched through the streets of the capital, Vilnius, on Sunday demanding Mr Paksas's resignation. It was the third anti-Paksas protest there in a week."
