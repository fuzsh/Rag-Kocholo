        "text": "Viacheslav Nikonov Nikonov\n\nVyacheslav Alexeyevich noted the increasing role of the BRICS countries in the G20. “Not so long ago everything was determined by the G7 countries. Why these seven countries? Because there were seven major economies of the world. On Friday it was announced at the BRICS summit that the BRICS economies are already bigger than the economy of the G7. The G7 is not a decisive factor in world development. Only BRICS brought more than 50% growth in the world economy last year, which is 43% of all humanity. No decision of the G20 is taken without the BRICS countries,” the parliamentarian said.\n\nIn his opinion, the G20 summit proved to be extremely successful for Russian foreign policy. The parliamentarian recalled that a meeting of the leaders of the Russian Federation, India and China was held on the margins of the G20 summit in Argentina for the first time since 2006 in the RIC format (Russia — India — China). In addition, on the margins of the summit Russian President Vladimir Putin held meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud.\n\nThe fact that there was no bilateral meeting between Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump was presented around the world as a sign of the growing diplomatic isolation of our country.\n\nHowever, Donald Trump did not hold meeting with Vladimir Putin because of lack of support in his own country, Viacheslav Nikonov believes.\n\n“The opponents of [Donald] Trump in the United States have done three things to prevent him from meeting. The first one- a well-known provocation with Ukrainian vessels in the Black Sea. The second — a forced confession of his lawyer Cohen that [Donald] Trump wanted to build the Trump tower not only at the beginning of 2016, but in the middle of 2016. In addition, Daniel Coats, Director of the US National Intelligence, on Friday produced evidence of a violation of the INF Treaty, and he named the manufacturer of the corresponding Russian missile 9M729 and the date of its testing. After that, a meeting with [Vladimir] Putin became already completely impossible,” the parliamentarian explained.\n\nThe US President did not held meeting with Vladimir Putin, because he could not do this for internal political reasons, Viacheslav Nikonov stated.\n\nHe also highlighted that during the G20 summit the US authorities refused to support a number of outcome documents. “19 countries signed the Declaration on climate change, except the United States. USA until the last moment prevented the adoption of the Declaration on fight against the policy of protectionism. Who defended the policy of protectionism? One country, the United States, opposed globalization. Therefore, of course, not Russia, but the United States to a much greater extent are isolated,“ — Viacheslav Nikonov said.\n\nAs he said, the summit results for Russia reflected the market, including rising oil prices and a strengthened ruble. “As a result of this summit, where we were supposed to be isolated, no isolation could be noticed,” said the parliamentarian.\n\n“Our Western 'partners', the United States, first of all, are trying to do more than they can — isolate our country. God will help them, of course, but nobody will ever succeed in isolating Russia,” Viacheslav Nikonov concluded."
