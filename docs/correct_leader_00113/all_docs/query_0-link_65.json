        "text": "Lithuania’s foreign minister Antanas Valionis confirmed the deportations in a news conference on Friday.\n\n“I wish to confirm the fact that three employees of the Russian embassy were expelled from Lithuania for activities unrelated to their employment,” Valionis said.\n\n“We regret having to take this action, and we hope that in the future our relations with Russia will be friendly and constructive,” he added.\n\nOther diplomats said the case was not linked to Lithuanian President Rolandas Paksas.\n\nPaksas is facing impeachment over a range of accusations including alleged links between his office and Russian mobsters and Russian intelligence services.\n\nThe affair has greatly embarrassed Lithuania just months before it joins the European Union and NATO, and has raised fears that Russian mobsters would use the Baltic country as a springboard for illegal activities across the enlarged EU."
