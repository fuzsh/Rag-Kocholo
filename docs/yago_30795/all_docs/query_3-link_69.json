        "text": "Victor Antonio Vega is survived by his best friend & fiancé, Margaret Olvera, mother, Silvana Martinez, father, Victor Vega, sister, Jessica Vega, fur baby, Chewy, his other mom, Carmen, other grandmother, Ma Ofelia, aunt, Josefina Martinez and all his other aunts, uncles, cousin, Christian Arenazas Martinez and all his other cousins, and eight and a half million spiritual brothers and sisters.\n\nVictor's death was a sudden unexpected loss. Victor was a gentleman, and he was a hardworking, loving, caring, funny, respectful person. Victor had a hard life, but today we will remember only the happy moments of his life and his future. Victor's life changed completely in the year of 2016, when he met Dale Dellinger, who became a good friend and who introduced Victor to study the Bible with the Jehovah's Witnesses. From there on he became a totally different person, he changed, those who truly knew him were able to see his transformation. He continued his Bible study, and with time he started commenting and giving speeches at the Kingdom Hall, and helped in anything that was needed at the Kingdom Hall and assemblies, and the get togethers'. And when COVID-19 came around he was able to give speeches through Zoom. He had decided that he was ready to get baptize and become a Jehovah's Witness. Before Victors' passing, he said \"I can't wait to go back to the Kingdom Hall with all the friends.\" Unfortunately, Victor passed away before we were able to go back to the Kingdom Hall.\n\nDuring his journey of getting to know Jehovah he met Maggie, who became a very good friend, but later on they both agreed that this was more than just a friendship. So, after a few years Victor proposed to Maggie. They both had their future planned out, they were very excited to start a new happy chapter of their lives, always making sure that Jehovah came first. Unfortunately, they weren't able to marry because of his sudden death.\n\nVictor would always rely on Jehovah God, in every decision he had to make, big or small. He would always cite Bible texts that demonstrated that he knew he would never be alone in his life anymore. He not only had Jehovah but also had his friends from the congregation. He always kept in mind Isaiah 41:10 \"Do not be afraid, for I am with you. Do not be anxious, for I am your God. I will fortify you, yes, I will help you, I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness.\"\n\nVictor left this world, no one expecting it, but he finished his race in this world. He didn't only physically run every day and worked out, he was also running his spiritual race, and he made it! 2 Timothy 4:7 \"I have fought the fine fight, I have run the race to the finish, I have observed the faith.\" Victor is resting now, but he will be resurrected, and we will be able to see each other again. Revelation 21:4 says \"And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.” Death will be no more, so may we continue to serve Jehovah and work hard to finish our race just like Victor did."
