        "text": "Andrew Combs Interview: The In-between Space\n\nPhoto by Austin Leih\n\nBY JORDAN MAINZER\n\nAndrew Combs has discovered the magic in the stillness. For this singer-songwriter with a family, including young kids, the evening, post-bedtime, represented the do-or-die moment for creativity: He could either kick back and relax or start some new tunes. What he found was that such hours of the night were actually the most fruitful. At ease, Combs was able to tell all kinds of stories, from autobiographical and biographical to fictional, with tones ranging from light, sweet, and romantic to heavy and devastating. The result is the aptly titled Dream Pictures (Chunk of Coal/Missing Piece), a collection of songs that started at home and built up into their own surreal worlds in the studio.\n\nUpon reading the history behind Dream Pictures, I immediately thought of Combs' previous album, Sundays, because it was also named after and born out of a regular schedule. (Combs wrote a song during the week and recorded it on a Sunday.) But in speaking to Combs last month, it became clear to me that Dream Pictures' existence as a product of mental clarity was more casual than it was some newfound, purposeful desire to create. It's also not an album of kitchen table existential dread like Hiss Golden Messenger's Bad Debt; while they contain moments of self-doubt or even anger and violence, the songs on Dream Pictures are attitudinally variable, even within themselves. On \"Eventide\", Combs' dedication to his wife rife with subtle drums and piano, muted pedal steel, and whooshing synths, he nonetheless delivers lines like, \"I passed away deep in my slumber / Far from fury and far grief.\" The folky, soulful, and textural \"Your Eyes and Me\" juxtaposes clever, pointed similes--\"Your melancholy hair like curtains in between your eyes and me\"--with verses that are weighty in their ambiguity. \"Swan dive in the water / Down to the bottom of the lake / Visions of you and our daughters / But I drowned them all now, didn't I babe?\" Combs asks, as you gasp, wondering who or what (the visions? the daughters themselves?) was exactly drowned. The very same song contains a plea to \"remember the good before the bad,\" a useful mantra no matter the context.\n\nOn Dream Pictures, Combs worked again with Dom Billett, the drummer on Sundays. Billett co-produced Dream Pictures and helped Combs flush out the instrumental arrangements, playing drums, bass, piano, and synthesizers and providing background vocals. Overall, Billett's keen ear for atmosphere, combined with Combs' acoustic and electric guitar playing and Spencer Cullum's pedal steel, gave life to the idea of \"dream pictures.\" Opening track \"Fly In My Wine\", written by the three of them, is an instrumental consisting of upright piano, pedal steel, and field recorded audio from Richard Serra's installation at the Bilbao Guggenheim. \"To Love\" is another sonic experiment, one not too far removed from Combs' initial demo, Combs delivering high-pitched, starry-eyed mantras over analog synths, electric guitars, and noise. \"The Sea in Me\" binds scraped acoustic guitars with an 8-bit synth line. These off-kilter sound collages effectively represent the fragility of memories and dreams. Even on comparatively traditional pop songs like the ballad \"Point Across\", the echo and delay on Billett's snares feel like time being bent. And when the instrumentation itself is cleaner, it effectively contrasts Combs' unhinged narrator: On Burton Collins co-write \"I'm Fine\", an electric guitar and Rhodes jam, Combs plays the part of the lovelorn person denying his own heartbreak. \"Do I ever touch your heart at all?\" he asks, \"Or are you busy laughing while I'm punching the walls?\"\n\nWhen I spoke to Combs, he was again in the stillness, but he wasn't working. He was on a beach in the Florida panhandle, on a vacation with his family and parents, getting some much needed rest before moving again. Starting tomorrow, Combs will embark on a two-and-a-half-week tour of the UK, Ireland, and the Netherlands, armed with an acoustic guitar, drum machine, and keyboards. Though Combs is known as a Nashville singer-songwriter, his first love was electronic music, and these days, he writes most of his songs on piano as opposed to guitar. And if the sparkling smog of Dream Pictures is any preview, he might just be able to shed that Americana label once and for all. Below, read our conversation, edited for length and clarity.\n\nPhoto by Austin Leih\n\nSince I Left You: Sundays was titled and formed around a dedicated day of the week that you sat down and recorded the song you had written over the past seven days. Dream Pictures is sort of similar in that it was inspired by your periods of creativity after your kids went to sleep. Is there something that's special in general about setting aside consistent time for music?\n\nAndrew Combs: Honestly, it started out of pure necessity. It's [when] I can have time alone. I don't know how conscious I [am] of it, but at this age, I'm trying to stay more present and really take in every day and what I'm grateful and thankful for. That doesn't necessarily mean that the songs are all about that, but [I'm] trying to be cognizant of the world that I'm living in now. That time of day is when [songwriting] is easiest to do, [when] I'm still with it enough that I can formulate creative output that may or may not mean something.\n\nSILY: Let me ask you a couple questions about what the songs on Dream Pictures are about. First, I'm assuming there are some songs on here that are not autobiographical.\n\nAC: Yeah. I do feel like pieces of me are in every song, but \"The Sea in Me\" is about two friends going through a breakup with each other. That's not about me at all, really, but there are things I identify with in that song from my history.\n\nSILY: Even if songs aren't about you, however, they have that same sort of biographical presence, that \"moment in time\" feel.\n\nAC: Listening back now, I definitely think that's correct. They are little snapshots in time.\n\nSILY: Quite literally, the opening track, \"Fly In My Wine\", has field recordings, which I find, when mixed with abstract instrumentation, to be very dream-like, which would go along with the theme of the record. When did you realize you wanted to open the album with something like that?\n\nAC: When I figured out the album title was going to be Dream Pictures. I'm right there with you in that field recordings mixed with abstract music feels dream-like. I also really love the song \"Eventide\". I wanted it to be the first song, but I didn't feel like just starting [the record] with the song itself. I wanted to have some sort of bed to dip your toes into.\n\nSILY: \"Eventide\" is, on the whole, a dedication to your wife, but one can read yourself working through some troubles. A line like, \"I passed away deep in my slumber / Far from fury and far grief\"--I don't know what you're referring to, but both within the album and within certain songs themselves, there are moments of struggle or darkness.\n\nAC: Totally. I'm always looking for the darkness in the light and the light in the darkness. Maybe I should try to accept the light when it's light and the dark when it's dark.\n\nSILY: But the former is more true. It speaks to the complexity of things, that things aren't one or the other.\n\nAC: Sure. It would be nice, though, to live in the light.\n\nSILY: If we could figure it out, everybody would be doing it.\n\nAC: That's right.\n\nSILY: What's the story behind \"Heavy the Heart\"?\n\nAC: Without getting too namey, it's sort of about Elvis, but it's really about a couple people I've known within the music industry who burned it at both ends. They've all been tragic people deep inside, destined for a large and horrific crash.\n\nSILY: Spencer Cullum's pedal steel stands out to me throughout the record. Normally, pedal steel stands out in general by virtue of its sheer quality, but on a lot of this album's songs, it's really subtle. Was that a product of Spencer's choice, the mixing, or something else?\n\nAC: It's a combined brainchild of Spencer, myself, and Dom. Pedal steel is a beautiful instrument, but being in Nashville and starting our careers in the Americana sphere and hearing pedal steel all the time, it can be overplayed and overused. We three have all gravitated towards simplicity and stripping back instead of layering and putting a lot of stuff on top. That being said, on a song like \"Mary Gold\" or \"Genuine and Pure\", we really wanted it to stand out for a solo section. I know Spencer's taste is similar, and Dom's is probably the same, but I really like Steely Dan pedal steel instead of alt country [pedal steel,] a more tasteful, thought-out thing. Some of [the pedal steel subtlety] is in the mixing, but I'd say 90% of it is where we chose to put it.\n\nSILY: The instrument has become really prevalent in indie rock to the point where so much prominent indie rock is basically alt country. You'd be considered more of an Americana artist, accurate or not, but Dream Pictures is closer to me to Steely Dan than it is alt country.\n\nAC: Yeah. I know how I got into [Americana,] but I don't necessarily know how I'm gonna escape those tags. [laughs] I'll let time deal with that.\n\nSILY: You've definitely never released a song like \"To Love\", which is electronic. Can you tell me how that song came to be from start to finish?\n\nAC: I made demos for a lot of [the Dream Pictures] songs on my computer at home. I have a really simple setup with the MIDI controls, microphone, and guitars. That was the only song for which we actually used a lot of the demo. I didn't think or know if it was gonna fit. I still don't really know, but I like it a lot. I definitely feel like there's a handful of songs that I really like that I have stowed away in that vain.\n\nWhen I first got into music, I was into electronic music. Besides hearing The Beatles and knowing it was something special, when I first started making my own compositions or songs, it was all electronic stuff. It's something I've always loved to do. I haven't always felt confident enough to put it on a record. I definitely feel like I'm doing it more and more. [On the] \"To Love\" demo, I had done the drums and some of the keyboards and the guitar solo and the vocals. [Dom] added percussion, more keys, and real bass. I don't have a real bass, so I just played bass on the keyboard. It's definitely different than the rest of the record.\n\nPhoto by Austin Leih\n\nSILY: I wanted to ask you about \"Table For Blue\", which seems like a very sweet, simple, almost low-stakes song, in the best way. Is that how it fits within Dream Pictures, providing levity?\n\nAC: Yes. It's the kind of song I've always been trying to write since I started writing songs. It is a low-stakes songwriting song. I'll always try and write songs like that, but they're fewer and farther between these days.\n\nSILY: You co-wrote \"I'm Fine\" with Burton Collins. Can you tell me about your working relationship with him?\n\nAC: Burton and I have written a lot since 2011 or 2012. For six years, I had a publishing deal where I was co-writing all the time for people on Music Row. Burton is one of the very few people I've maintained a working relationship with. He's mostly an actor. He doesn't play or sing. But he's a brilliant lyricist. He writes with Doja Cat and also collaborates with country people. He did a kids play. He likes to keep his fingers in as many things as possible. We've written a lot over the past ten years and try to do so once or twice a year.\n\nDream Pictures cover art\n\nSILY: How did you come up with the front cover for the album? Lately, you have a lot of experimental photographs of yourself adorning your records.\n\nAC: It's a photo my buddy Austin Leih took. He's done videos for me in the past and did the \"Eventide\" visual accompaniment. I was just messing with the picture and the idea of \"dream pictures\" and the in-between space, [such as] between dreaming and sleeping. I might have hit the nail too much on the head.\n\nSILY: It doesn't have to be subtly symbolic. It can just look cool.\n\nAC: Good. [laughs]\n\nSILY: You co-designed the record cover, too. I know you paint, but do you do design work?\n\nAC: My dad is a retired graphic designer, so I grew up knowing that world. I've always dabbled in it, but I've never had the money to buy the Adobe suites and have never had the time or want to learn how to do it technically well. It's something I do find pleasing to toy around with. I didn't have much money behind this record and Sundays, so [I tried] to do as much as I could by myself.\n\nSILY: Will your upcoming tour be the first time you've played these songs live?\n\nAC: I've played a few of them at a show here and there, trying them out, but yeah, in terms of a formal setting. I'm playing solo, so it's not going to be a full record experience, but I'm trying to incorporate drum machine and keyboards. I'm so bored by the [just] acoustic guitar thing.\n\nSILY: I'm sure it'll prove an artistically satisfying challenge to adapt the songs in that way, too.\n\nAC: Totally. It's actually been really fun.\n\nSILY: On what instrument did you write most of the Dream Pictures songs?\n\nAC: A lot of them were on keys. I'm not a great keyboard player. I just kind of plunk along with chords. Dom did the more elaborate arrangements. I have an old RMI Electra-piano and mess around on that a lot. There are certain things that only guitar can do, but I've grown bored with it being the thing I reach for every time. I think it's nice to start with keys or even a drum beat to change things up.\n\nSILY: Are you planning on touring in the US?\n\nAC: I don't know. I'd like to do some stuff. I can't really foresee doing a real long tour, hitting smaller markets, because I can't afford it. I would at least like to do New York, Philly, the East Coast big city stuff. Do a Nashville show, maybe go out West. It might also depend on if a big artist likes the record and wants to take me out to do some opening sets. I'm always keen on that in the States. It's a lot easier that way.\n\nSILY: That makes sense. You don't have to do a ton of the planning yourself.\n\nAC: And if they have an established audience you haven't tapped into. I did some shows with The Milk Carton Kids, and it was the best opening slot ever, because their crowd is quiet and respectful and they listen. What I do is subtle and can be quiet, so it worked. Then you have those people on your side.\n\nSILY: Are you writing right now?\n\nAC: The time period after you make something and before it comes out is actually really productive for me. It's a time to dream and mess around without a deadline or expectations. I don't know what exactly it is, but I have ideas floating around for what's next. Who knows whether it will stay that way or morph into something different. A lot of my time right now is being spent getting ready for the tour.\n\nSILY: When you're making music, do you try to not consume other media? Or are you pretty good at compartmentalizing and not letting other records, TV shows, movies, or books affect you?\n\nAC: I like learning and listening and seeing new stuff all the time, so I keep it going at all times.\n\nSILY: Anything recent you've liked?\n\nAC: I read [Daniel Mason's] North Woods, which was really beautiful. I'm re-reading East of Eden, which is one of my favorites. The King Hannah record is really cool. I'm listening to these Romanian folk songs, which are mostly a capella with maybe some sparse instrumentation, but they're really cool. I wouldn't know how to tell you what they're called, though, because they're in a different alphabet. I don't watch a ton of TV. I really liked The Zone of Interest.\n\nPhoto by Austin Leih\n\nTour dates\n\n8/22: The Keep, Guildford, UK 8/23: The Railway Inn, Winchester, UK 8/24: Stanford Hall, Bottesford, UK 8/25: Caroline Street Social Club, Shipley, UK 8/26: Kazimier Stockroom, Liverpool, UK 8/27: St Mary's Creative Space, Chester, UK 8/28: The Workmans Cellar, Dublin, Ireland 8/29: Cleere's Bar & Theatre, Kilkenny, Ireland 8/30: The American Bar, Belfast, UK 8/31: Run of the Mill 2024, Paisley, UK 9/1: Sneaky Pete's, Edinburgh, UK 9/3: Water Rats, London, UK 9/5: De Doelen, Rotterdam, Netherlands 9/6: Luxor Live, Arnhem, Netherlands 9/7: Burgerweeshuis, Deventer, Netherlands 9/8: Sugar Mountain x Indiestad Met Festival, Amsterdam, Netherlands 9/9: Muziekgebouw Eindhoven, Eindhoven, Netherlands\n\nHamish Hawk Interview: Pathos in the Ridiculous\n\nPhoto by Michaela Simpson\n\nBY JORDAN MAINZER\n\n\"It's a very sunny afternoon here in Edinburg, so I'm in a good mood,\" Hamish Hawk told me over Zoom late last month. When I mentioned to him that I had spent time in Scotland's capital city decades ago and loved it, he lit up. \"When it comes to Edinburgh, I'm such an enthusiast,\" he said. \"I really like when people come here.\" Part of me was shocked that Hawk abided by such simple logic, that nice weather plus a feeling of civic pride equals even temporary happiness. On albums like Heavy Elevator, Angel Numbers, and his latest, A Firmer Hand, out Friday via So Recordings and Fierce Panda, Hawk is not necessarily a spoilsport, but he toes the line between truth and facetiousness. Such a balancing act has proven so far to be successful for Hawk, who has found himself fostering a long-term working relationship with Rod Jones of beloved Scottish rockers Idlewid and twice shortlisted for the Scottish Album of the Year award. But with A Firmer Hand, Hawk didn't withhold a thing, sharing an album focused on various types of relationships with men, from romantic to professional, as well as insecurities with masculinity. And he doesn't quite know whether people will like it. \"[A Firmer Hand] is different enough from Heavy Elevator and Angel Numbers being safely on the cheaper poppy side of things,\" he said. \"This one is lyrically and musically quite a change.\"\n\nDon't get me--or Hawk--wrong: A Firmer Hand is very much a Hamish Hawk record, through and through. Jones returns to the producer's chair, the songs were written by Hawk, and the instrumentation was composed by his core band of guitarist Andrew Pearson, keyboardist/drummer Stefan Maurice, and bassist Alex Duthie. The songs exude familiar vibes, from the very opener \"Juliet as Epithet\", with its harmonic keyboards, rippling percussion, and of course, Hawk's unmistakable croon. But the first track also sets the mood for the entire record, individual verses encompassing simultaneous feelings of devotion, worry, bitterness, and self-aggrandizement. \"So goddamn handsome he makes me anxious / He holds my hand thru the sad advances / Why wouldn't he tho? / I'm just the open secret no-one's ever gonna blow,\" Hawk sings, making you want to cry and laugh all at once. In general, Hawk uses explicitness not for shock value, but to reveal a similar contradiction within sex, that of vulnerability and hilarity. The album's double entendre title comes from dance punk jam \"Big Cat Tattoos\", one that both derides and expresses jealousy over traditional notions of manliness. \"I think you'd prefer a firmer hand with big cat tattoos and a wedding band,\" Hawk sings to a lover, eyes rolled, taking down all types of compensatory masculine personas, from the tech bro and the music snob to even the strong-and-silent sad-sack within himself.\n\nA skilled songwriter, Hawk both sings autobiographically and exaggeratedly, and he's able to present other perspectives without the pretense of becoming them. On A Firmer Hand, most importantly, you're not left wanting to solve a puzzle of what happened and when and to whom; instead, you can find a sense of solidarity with the imperfections and troubles of everyone involved, even if your life has nothing in common with them. The ivory tower narrator of \"Nancy Dearest\" may be lonely at the top, but what matters is that they're lonely at all. The slinky bass and trilling guitars of \"Autobiography of Spy\" visualize a suave 007 on paper but someone living a secret sexual existence in a sad reality. \"We're footprintless on fallen snow / We wear the mist and learn the code,\" Hawk sighs. Yes, Hawk's clearly diffident himself on songs like \"Men Like Wire\" and \"Questionable Hit\", on the latter participating in a music industry where other men wont want to be him if he's clearly gay or effeminate, but thinking, \"Will I never tire of fronting?\" on the former. But he finds power for us all when adopting a devilish swagger on \"Milk an Ending\". \"This is my ninth life / I shan't stand by like a half shut knife,\" he declares, continuing, \"If you can't take this dance / If you won't fake romance, why should I?\" After all, the right to live freely means the right to boast freely, too.\n\nIf I was surprised by the wholly sunny disposition of a purportedly autobiographical songwriter who made an album like A Firmer Hand, I was not taken aback by his willingness to break down its songs. Throughout our conversation, Hawk was honest about which aspects of the album were the results of a longstanding goal and which came naturally or even unexpectedly. Read our conversation below, edited for length and clarity, and catch him on tour in the UK and Europe through the rest of the year, with the same band who played on the album.\n\nPhoto by Simon Murphy\n\nSince I Left You: At what point did writing a \"skeletons in the closet\" record become unavoidable?\n\nHamish Hawk: The first song I wrote for the record was \"Questionable Hit\". It was written roundabout the same time as some of the Angel Numbers songs, or at least towards the end of the Angel Numbers era, as it were. There's something in the tone of \"A Questionable Hit\", and even of a song like \"Money\" from Angel Numbers, and of a couple others in my repertoire, that's similarly slightly finger-pointing, embittered, and cynical. But I felt with \"Questionable Hit\" there was a sharper tooth in there that I didn't expect. When I wrote that, I felt, even though it was roundabout the time of the Angel Numbers stuff, it wasn't going to fit very comfortably with Angel Numbers, so I sort of put it to one side. Then, my collaborator Stefan Maurice, my drummer, sent me a keys loop that essentially became \"Machiavelli's Room\". When I was writing that, I became consumed with it. Some songs come really fast, and others take months. This was neither. I ruminated on it, listening to it constantly trying to edit and redraft the lyrics to get them perfect. As soon as I finished it, I looked back at the work and thought, \"Ok, I don't think a song like that is gonna sit very comfortably with songs that sound like Angel Numbers.\" It struck me quite quickly that whatever album \"Machiavelli's Room\" would appear on, the songs that surrounded it would have to be cut from the same cloth. It was from there that \"Questionable Hit\", even though it's got a slightly different tone, reared its head again.\n\n[A Firmer Hand] became this wider exercise in seeing how direct, how honest, how diaristic I could be. I think the album has achieved that, but for that reason, I'm slightly more nervous about the release of this record than I was for the past two. It's a vulnerable record...albums kind of exist in this odd space before you release them where you feel you might want to change something, or you're not convinced of exactly what they are. As soon as they're released, it's like, \"Ok, now that's done. I can close the door on that. I can orient myself towards something completely new.\" I'm still in that strange period with A Firmer Hand, admittedly, but I think it's a good piece of work.\n\nSILY: It's not necessarily a logical step after you've gained critical acclaim and more fans to say to the general music listening public, \"Here's an album where you might not like me very much.\" Would you describe the album as totally diaristic, or are there aspects that are tongue-in-cheek and a little self-aware?\n\nHH: Across the board, even with Heavy Elevator and Angel Numbers, and even before that, the vast majority of the inspiration I get to write songs does come from real events and real life. I definitely write in heightened terms. I'm inspired by writers like Scott Walker and Jarvis Cocker who take mundane kitchen-sink narratives and bring them up to this level where they could sing about something incredibly ordinary, like taking the kids home from school or something, and put it on this big Las Vegas stage, this high drama Caravaggio lighting. That's a process I've always been really interested in. As much as my songs are autobiographical, they're not strictly autobiographical. I'll take the truth and polish it up a bit and inject it with this new dramatic or poetic energy. But if we were to go through my songs, I'd be able to point at lyrics and tell you exactly where they came from and what moment in my life caused them to be written. I'm definitely not an abstract writer in that sense: I don't attack things from the perspective of other characters, and I don't try to take on a different persona and write about a period in history or a place I've never been to. It is autobiographical in that sense. My songs are very personal to me. That's the only way I know how to do it, so within that frame, I am trying to push myself to write in different ways, but that's my medium, as it were.\n\nSILY: Even if you don't inhabit other characters or mindsets, you still give space to other voices. There are conversational aspects of your songs where you're presenting the perspectives of others without inhabiting them. How do you find that balance when you write?\n\nHH: I don't think it's necessarily the healthiest thing in the world. In the past, I've been guilty of other characters or people that feature in my songs turning into kind of cyphers, versions of them where they say the things I want them to say. Angel Numbers was when I first started working with other characters in the songs saying things that really did happen, exact phrases. I wouldn't note them down at the time, but they were etched into my brain forever. That continues into A Firmer Hand. I'm trying to be as cutthroat with myself as I possibly can, because more often than not, these characters are saying something to me or about me. This album was a warts and all approach. At the end of some of these songs, I'm not necessarily gonna look great. It was an exercise in seeing how true to life I could be without being fantastical or this sort of protection of artifice. Sometimes, when I listen to these songs back, I think, \"Oh, I remember that, that wasn't [my] best day.\" [laughs]\n\nSILY: On A Firmer Hand, you do write about the mundane, but at the same time, you include hyper-specific cultural references and, even if they're based on real people, tropes like the tech bro on \"Big Cat Tattoos\". I laughed at the line, \"You vetoed every one of my miserabilist movies / You bored everyone from out of town with the virtues of shoegaze.\" Everyone knows someone like that. Do you try to connect with a wider audience by being hyper-specific?\n\nHH: It's a really good question. In you saying that, I can see you agree with me in that often times, the more hyper-specific you can be, the more idiosyncratic, the more personal, the more likely it is to suddenly explode and be relatable to a huge number of people. More formulaic commercial pop music, there has been historically a belief that if you try to make things as generic as possible, it can be consumed by a much larger number of people. I think you find that the more you try to be generic, the more you try to dumb it down to the lowest common denominator so that everyone can get it, the more people are put off by it. I've always tried in my music to give a vast amount of credit to the listener. I don't want to dumb things down for anybody. I'd like to be immediate in my lyricism. I'd like my lyrics to be understood. I'm not trying to be so pretentious that no one can engage with it. The more personal I can be, the more it ends up relating to so many more people. By adding in cultural references or even local references, those things endear people much more than trying to get to them where they are. It's about creating something so they can approach you, as opposed to--I don't know--trying to be close to their life inauthentically. It's much stronger to be authentically you so people can move towards you.\n\nSILY: It's almost a matter of humility. You don't know their life, and they don't know yours, but being hyper-specific is how we relate to each other.\n\nHH: The song \"Panic\" by The Smiths has so many British references in it, but towards the end of the song, Morrissey sings, \"Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ.\" He's talking about the songs the DJ is playing, singing, \"It says nothing to me about my life.\" I don't think he's talking about songs that talk about far flung places, because even the songs that talk about far flung places can talk to him about his life. We don't have to have identical lives in order to relate to each other. There's so much more going on underneath all that. I like to give the listener fair credit and assume that they have what it takes to engage with the song on whatever level they'd like to. Pop music listeners are certainly very engaged and have the intelligence and willingness to engage on whatever level they'd like to.\n\nSILY: And the internet prowess!\n\nHH: [laughs] Yeah!\n\nA Firmer Hand cover art\n\nSILY: The mid-album back-to-back of \"You Can Film Me\" and \"Christopher St.\", I don't know the stories behind the songs, but they seem to me to comprise a tragic mid-section. Am I off base there?\n\nHH: Not at all. There is a link between those. I'm not going to disclose too much about it, if I may, but you're quite astute to pick that up. \"Christopher St.\", the music was written by Stefan. I've always been a fan of little vignettes in albums. The thing that makes Angel Numbers cohesive is that it is one unified voice: It is my voice. The band and I never worried too much about dipping our toes into different genres or different sounds or instrumentation within one album. Giving fair credit to the listener, they're able to deal with an album like Angel Numbers. It's not tricky: \"Rest & Veneers\" has a sort of country feel. \"Elvis Look-alike Shadows\" is bombastic and loud and high drama. \"Frontman\" is a harmonium-led lament. I don't think it's hard to engage with an album just because it has many different faces, so I've never worried about having fragments or vignettes or moments in albums that take you out of the world you think you're in, and suddenly they pull you right out. I've always been inspired by albums that seem like they have a left turn in the middle of the record.\n\nI must say, to compliment him, that Stefan is an incredibly gifted piano player and composer on the keys. He's written so many beautiful songs for me and so many beautiful moments that no one's heard, so I was really excited to have a song like \"Christopher St.\" [on A Firmer Hand] because it's such a beautiful piece of music. The writing and the lyrics came so, so quickly. I won't go too much into the inspiration or the stories behind the songs, but I think you're right. It's this tragic two sides. Everything that's in \"You Can Film Me\" is as bombastic and full of pomp, arch, raised eyebrow stuff I'm capable of, and \"Christopher St.\" is about as earnest and as tender and as melancholic as I get. Those things are absolutely essential parts of my music, so to have them sit next to each other, you'd think it would be a contrast that could repel a listener, but I think--or at least I hope--it achieves the opposite. Having those things sit side by side is really effective. I've always been inspired by the idea of pathos in the ridiculous. Having something very deeply emotional and sad, the height of a certain emotion, next to something really amusing, silly, absolutely absurd. It makes the emotional thing more intense. It has this odd effect that you think would be uncanny and not work, but more often than not, it does.\n\nSILY: Was there a general process for how you came up with the instrumentation on the record? Or was it truly on a song-by-song basis?\n\nHH: It was different than the previous records. Heavy Elevator was one way, this sort of indie rock default. Angel Numbers took off and gave it a little more pomp with brass, horns, and pedal steel, embellishing the slightly rougher edges, softening them up, and bringing them to the fore. It was slightly ballroom. The band and I were very careful with A Firmer Hand to make it a band record. We wanted to be able to replicate all of the songs on the record on stage exactly as they are instead of having to make approximations or use samples or for someone to have to play the violin line on the keys or the trumpet line on the guitar. It was about having a band in a room. We wanted track 1 to track 12 to be obviously the same group of people and basically the same instruments. I think that limitation is really helpful and can often be really fruitful for a creative process. There wasn't too much pre-production involved in the songs. [Though,] the more we record and the more often we're in the studio, we think that's what we want to do next time, to have time to really work things out, as painstaking as it might be.\n\nSILY: Have you played the songs from A Firmer Hand live yet?\n\nHH: Some of them. We've played \"Men Like Wire\", \"You Can Film Me\", \"Nancy Dearest\", and \"Big Cat Tattoos\". Beyond that, most of the middle tracks we haven't touched yet. We've rehearsed them, and some of them are sounding really great. I'm certainly feeling--and I can't speak for the band--that it's an interesting experience trying to put these songs next to some of the older songs in our set. It starts to feel like a tale of two cities. I think that's exciting. I think it's probably somewhere where good things can come. I don't think it's going to be too much of a problem.\n\nSILY: Do you have the same approach to adapting the new songs to the stage as you did for those on your previous records?\n\nHH: I'd say so. I wouldn't say too much has changed. The first thing we've noticed is that setlists are becoming really tricky. Our sets are typically an hour and a quarter, an hour and twenty minutes, and we're having to cut out some of the mainstays of the set, turn it on its head completely and say, \"Ok, suddenly, we're not playing that.\" Which is okay. That can only be good, to have a sense of renewal or rejuvenation. Reconfiguring the sets is tricky, but it's important we don't rest on our laurels. Any change is good for us. It's always the new song that feels exciting to play. With all these new shows coming up, we're excited to have some new blood in the set.\n\nSILY: Is there one on this record that you're most excited to play, whether you've played it already or not?\n\nHH: I have three, for different reasons. I'm really looking forward to playing \"Machiavelli's Room\" live. We've rehearsed it, and it's sounding great, but we haven't played it live yet. The first time that will likely get played live is before the album comes out. Who knows what people will make of it the first time they hear it? I'm excited about that one because it's so stark, and it's the type of song that's quite unyielding in the sense that it is what it is. You can't sugarcoat it. On stage, I love performing and love trying to engage with the audience and bring them in. Some of the songs on A Firmer Hand are more pushing people back, or more affronting in some sense. I'm excited to see how \"Machiavelli's Room\" works, not only in terms of how the audience experiences it, but in terms of what it does to us. It's a two-way street. We can treat the songs a certain way, but the songs treat us a certain way.\n\nAnother is \"Autobiography of Spy\". I really like that song, and I think it's a really interesting album track. It isn't a single, and isn't going to get that much limelight. But I really like it. I think it's a great length, the instrumentation is really interesting, and all the moments are sort of considerate and well thought-out. We're all quite happy with that song and how it happened.\n\nThe third is \"Juliet as Epithet\", the [opening track]. It's very atmospheric.\n\nSILY: Do you use loops live?\n\nHH: We do, but they're never a cornerstone of the songs. They're never an essential part. It's more window dressing. We have little things that will continue throughout the entire record. There are a few songs where we have a loop going on in the background, but it's more painting. We don't like having too many major parts being played by samples.\n\nSILY: Are you planning on coming to the US?\n\nHH: Next year, it's looking like it. This year, we have two tours in the UK, one in August and one in December. We're going on tour with Travis in September throughout Europe. America is likely on the cards for March or April for next year, though it's more likely to be February or March. We've played SXSW twice and are hoping to get invited a third time, but surrounding that, we're hoping to get things sorted on both coasts so we have shows either side of SXSW.\n\nSILY: Would you come to Chicago?\n\nHH: That would be ideal. Obviously, it's all up in the air right now. The ideal would be New York, L.A., and something in Austin, but something in the Midwest would be awesome. Chicago would have to get done. Not only do I love Chicago, but in terms of the numerous art scenes in Chicago, we'd have to sink our teeth into them.\n\nSILY: Have you played here before?\n\nHH: Yes. I've played there and in America, but it was sort of a shoestring tour of the US. I was playing DIY house shows, no money was exchanged. It was me playing in people's living rooms. I've played in 26 states. I played in a living room in Chicago. I've played in Detroit, Atlanta, Athens, Baltimore, L.A., Salt Lake City, all over the place.\n\nPhoto by Elliot Hetherton\n\nSILY: Are you the type of songwriter who's always writing, or do you compartmentalize between album cycles?\n\nHH: Sadly, I do always write. Right now, I'm writing a little bit, but not much because I don't have too much time in my hands. But I've not been known to successfully compartmentalize and say, \"This year, I've written my record, and next year, I won't write at all.\" I don't know how to do that yet. I don't have that relationship with my writing. It is quite consistent. When I do have a fallow couple of months, those months are full of insecurity and dread and self-doubt. Hopefully, in the future, I'll manage to foster something that says, \"Okay, I haven't written something for 6 months, and that's okay.\" But at this stage, if I don't write anything for 2 weeks, I think, \"Woah, what's happening? Is there something coming? Maybe I've dried up.\" Right now, the band and I are throwing some things around at the moment. Let's hope it's the beginning of the next record.\n\nSILY: You could always write about writer's block!\n\nHH: Exactly, but that's when you start falling down the rabbit hole of writing songs about writing songs, and writing songs about going on tour. Suddenly, no one relates to your albums at all except for musicians. \"That album's so great, that one about being on the road.\" People don't really like listening to that on the way to work.\n\nSILY: Is there anything you've been listening to, watching, or reading lately that's caught your attention?\n\nHH: My listening at the moment, I don't know why it's happened this way, but it's been dominated by new country and roots music and new interpretations of traditional blues music. Since I was a kid, I've always really liked folk singers. My mum was a huge fan of James Taylor, Kris Kristofferson, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Ralph McTell, Gordon Lightfoot, and these 60s folkies. It was my first entrance into singer-songwriter music. Of late, I wouldn't say I've been listening to anything specific, other than the absolute classics of blues, Blind Willie McTell, Mississippi John Hurt, and Lead Belly, which I've always gone back to fairly infrequently. At the moment, I'm listening to a lot of blues and country music. Who knows what that promises for the next record, because I don't think country had much of an input on A Firmer Hand. Maybe I'll see if Willie Nelson wants to do a collab.\n\nSILY: I don't know, the guitar tones on \"The Hard Won\" at the end are kind of country western.\n\nHH: That's true. That's the last track as well, so maybe that suggests what might come. Here's hoping.\n\nPitchfork Music Festival 2024: 7/19-7/21, Union Park, Chicago\n\nJeff Rosenstock; Photo by OK Pedersen\n\nBY JORDAN MAINZER\n\nWhen I previewed this year's Pitchfork Music Festival, I mentioned that the undercard has always excited me more than the headliners. Last year, in contrast, two headliners blew me away. This year, sure, I had a great time watching Alanis Morissette, but as predicted, the non-headliners were the ones who most consistently surpassed my expectations. This was also the first year I can remember in a while--maybe ever--that I opted to see the Blue Stage sub-headliner over the larger sub-headliner at the Red Stage every single night. I guess you could say that my favorite sets at this year's festival made the most out of the time and space they were given. Here they are, in chronological order.\n\nFRIDAY\n\nBlack Duck's Douglas McCombs; Photo by Jared Holt\n\nBlack Duck\n\nWhen I first saw this guitar-guitar-drums trio of Douglas McCombs, Bill MacKay, and Charles Rumback, I hoped for the possibility of recorded music. As it turned out, the years of Black Duck's live improvising resulted in their self-titled debut, released last year on Thrill Jockey. Each band member brought a written tune into the recording session, and the rest of the tracks on Black Duck were improvised. The band's set to open this year's Pitchfork Music Festival was emblematic of the spirit of McCombs' gorgeous \"Of the Lit Backyards\", a tribute to gathering together outside, a symbol of our desire to collaborate and the interplay among musicians and between musicians and crowd. His and MacKay's dual guitar riffs echoed off of each other, backed by Rumback's rolling drums. When MacKay soloed, his guitars at times wavered like a violin, elsewhere delving into a funky strut or requinto-style freak-out. The band's dynamics shined, their proficiency in tension, build, release, and quiet captivating the audience and carrying on the great tradition of Chicago post-rock.\n\nFrom left to right: Rosali Middleman, Kevin Donahue, & David Nance; Photo by Jared Holt\n\nRosali\n\nOne of my favorite things about Bite Down (Merge), the terrific fourth album from indie rock musician Rosali, is the extent to which the songs' sounds and moods subtly shift. Similarly, live, her band--including bassist David Nance, guitarist James Schroeder, and drummer Kevin Donahue--doesn't so much jam as mold Rosali Middleman's songs into shape. Her buttery voice, Nance and Donahue's backing vocals, Schroeder's buzzing guitars, and Donahue's slinky drums morphed \"On Tonight\" from a shrugged-off suggestion into a deep yearning for connection. Middleman's gentle riffs and falsetto-to-deep vocal led \"Hills on Fire\"'s minimalist journey from noise to soul. And then there were the sharper, more simple changes, like Middleman's rasp when singing \"My Kind\" and the phrase, \"You found me\" on older song \"Waited All Day\", or Schroeder's expertly placed Crazy Horse solos. I expected Rosali to be a standout set, the perfect transition from early to late afternoon, but I'm glad I got to experience exactly how they achieved it.\n\nBilly Woods; Photo by Kimberley Ross\n\nBilly Woods & Kenny Segal\n\nTalk about a masterclass in live MCing. It seemed like Kenny Segal was just feeding beats to Billy Woods, who didn't know what was coming yet still slayed every single verse. Whether on songs from either of the duo's two albums, Woods' solo records, or even Armand Hammer material, Woods' flow was as it was on his albums, deft and nonstop without being overwhelming. The set had very few flourishes. BackwoodzStudioz labelmate (and Chicago native) SKECH185 came out to perform Jeff Markey's \"Bud Billiken\", and Woods only really stopped mid-song when he realized he forgot to give flowers to songs' featured artists, at one point letting all of Fielded's verse play on \"Western Education is Forbidden\". \"My girl Fielded couldn't make it this weekend, but she makes this song,\" Woods said, forcing you to pay attention. He was so captivating on the mic, you didn't want to be distracted by the crowd's weed-imbued haze and miss a moment.\n\nYaeji; Photo by Cole Kincart\n\nYaeji\n\n\"Give Yaeji a couple more dancers and a bigger stage, and she could be a headliner,\" a friend remarked to me the day after her epic Red Stage performance. Even the singer and producer herself recognized her growth. After all, when she played the festival in 2021, she was a year and a half removed from her debut mixtape, What We Drew 우리가 그려왔던, and this time, she had a great full-length under her belt, last year's With A Hammer (XL). According to Yaeji, she was a different person then, and her garnering of a bigger crowd is due to her ability to connect with people. \"If you resonate with my music, you are a mirror of myself in some ways as I am for you,\" she told the crowd. Thankfully, the philosophizing was mixed between bangers like the syncopated \"With A Hammer\" and \"Raingurl\", a clear standout for the bopping crowd. At the end of her set, Yaeji took a selfie with the audience, as if to document where and what type of person she was at this very moment in time, something to look back on in years to come.\n\nJeff Rosenstock; Photo by Kimberley Ross\n\nJeff Rosenstock\n\nTo soundcheck his guitar, Jeff Rosenstock toyed with the crowd by playing the first few seconds of riffs from 90s and early Aughts rock staples. Like a lot of things with Rosenstock, it was a joke--or was it? As the band walked out to System of a Down's \"Chop Suey!\", they picked up their instruments and smoothly finished the song where the sound engineer cut it off. The crowd, whether familiar or not with Rosenstock's brand of funny, self-aware, at-times-political-but-never-self-serious punk rock, was hooked. The band burned through HELLMODE (Polyvinyl) tracks like the built-up \"3 SUMMERS\" and climate change reflection \"FUTURE IS DUMB\". And Rosenstock does what he always does: Use his platform for shout-outs that toe the line between facetiousness and earnestness (Festival sponsor Nespresso) and ones that refuse the status quo (the corporate privatization of water), before playing WORRY. classic \"Festival Song\". That he impressively ripped a saxophone solo while crowd-surfing during \"You, in Weird Cities\" was an added bonus.\n\nSATURDAY\n\nL'Rain's Taja Cheek; Photo by Kimberley Ross\n\nL’Rain\n\nI foresaw the drifts and flows of Black Duck, and perhaps the local band that led off Saturday, Lifeguard. But the set of the Festival that best segued the calm into the storm was L'Rain, the experimental project of multi-instrumentalist, composer, and curator Taja Cheek. Backed by a band, Cheek showcased a world of enveloping sound, whispered vocals and cooing harmonies subsumed by saxophone loops, clattering cymbals, and keyboard arpeggios. Wiry guitars and pounding bass shocked the quiet of \"Clumsy\", a highlight from last year's excellently titled I Killed Your Dog (Mexican Summer). With L'Rain's albums, you never know what you're gonna get, and the same goes for their live show, apparently.\n\nHotline TNT's Will Anderson; Photo by Daniel Cavazos\n\nHotline TNT\n\nMost artists that cut their teeth in the house show world don't exude sounds as stadium-sized as that of Will Anderson's Hotline TNT--at least this quickly and seamlessly. In 2022, after touring the prior year's Nineteen in Love, Anderson was approached with a record deal by Jack White's label Third Man. Though the DIY stalwart was initially skeptical, he accepted after realizing that the label would simply give him more money to be himself, which is exactly what Hotline TNT's label debut Cartwheel sounds like: a bigger, bolder, better Hotline TNT. Live, the fuzz was even more all-encompassing, on opener \"Protocol\", the seemingly ceaseless \"Spot Me 100\", and new songs like \"Candle\". With 17 minutes left in their set, Anderson introduced \"Had 2 Try\" as the final song that \"you're not gonna wanna miss,\" which made me think they might extend the shoegaze banger to double or triple its studio length. They didn't--they ended their set 13 minutes early--but with someone as prolific as Anderson, leaving us wanting more might have been the smartest thing to do.\n\nfeeble little horse's Lydia Slocum; Photo by OK Pedersen\n\nfeeble little horse\n\nDuring a derecho that tore its way through the Chicago area earlier in the week, a group of friends and I were laughing at how a local TV weatherperson kept referring to the tornado path as a \"jagged squall.\" Days later, that term was in my head watching and listening to the tones of Pittsburgh indie rock four-piece feeble little horse. Sebastian Kinsler and Ryan Walchonski's guitars were coarse enough to be playful on songs like \"Sweet\", but piercing like early MBV on \"i am smoking cigarettes again\" and righteous song of last summer candidate \"Steamroller\". Vocalist and bassist Lydia Slocum was effectively atonal on \"Freak\" and ear-splitting during traditional set closer \"down\". I'm glad I finally caught feeble little horse following last year's live hiatus; I'm glad I stayed in the back having followed Hotline TNT with another distortion-loving band.\n\nWednesday's Karly Hartzman; Photo by Daniel Cavazos\n\nWednesday\n\nAt Wednesday's victory lap of a mid-afternoon set on Saturday, every aspect of their aesthetic was emphasized: the twang in Xandy Chelmis' lap steel, the distortion in the electric guitars, Karly Hartzman's drawl-to-guttural yell. Her pointed, yet cosmic lyrics, combined with drummer Alan Miller's propulsive beat rendered \"Toothache\" their \"Tiny Cities Made of Ashes\" mini-epic. They wore their influences on their sleeve, both figuratively (following up the Drive-By Truckers-referencing \"Bath Country\" with a cover of \"Women Without Whiskey\") and literally (Hartzman's sequin country-esque cardigan). Of course, set closer \"Bull Believer\" continued to be the scream-along anthem of our times; Hartzman invited the crowd to tag along in her moment of catharsis, a collective expression of anger over the genocide in Gaza, the erosion of LGBTQ+ rights, or whatever ghoulish thing the powers that be were doing that you were most mad about that day.\n\nJessie Ware; Photo by Daniel Cavazos\n\nJessie Ware\n\nSometimes, though you like an artist, you haven't seen them live for over 10 years and overlook their presence on a festival lineup. Can't be me! Ok, I last saw English singer-songwriter Jessie Ware at a Lollapalooza after-show at Lincoln Hall in 2013, fresh off her head-turning quiet storm-indebted debut Devotion. I was wholly aware of--and appreciated!--her left-turn into disco pop, but didn't realize the extent to which her live performance was a gloriously performed and choreographed expression of utter euphoria. Armed with a live band, backing vocalists, and dancers (dubbed The Pearlettes), Ware performed a selection of earworms from 2020's What's Your Pleasure? and last year's That! Feels Good! (Interscope). She taught the crowd a dance during \"Beautiful People\", covered Cher's undeniable \"Believe\" (the second time an artist covered the song on the Green Stage in the past three years), and ended with \"Free Yourself\", an anthem of Pride year-round.\n\nUnwound\n\nIf Unwound's initial reunion shows represented the band returning where they left off, Saturday night's Blue Stage sub-headlining set displayed a taut group sounding grander than ever, at times even showy. Jams, the quartet giving into the crowd's desire for volume, Justin Trosper triumphantly raising his guitar in the air, each member tossing flowers into the crowd at the end of the set was, to these eyes and ears, evidence of people truly in love with playing music. If you'd written songs as good as \"Corpse Pose\" and \"Look a Ghost\", wouldn't you, too, love playing them?\n\nSUNDAY\n\nJoanna Sternberg; Photo by Daniel Cavazos\n\nJoanna Sternberg\n\nThe music of singer-songwriter Joanna Sternberg is at once immensely confessional and feels like it was dropped from somewhere out of time. During their early Sunday set, Sternberg, sitting on a plastic chair with only an acoustic guitar in hand, effortlessly switched between heartbreaking songs of self-disillusionment and skillfully crafted folk ditties that sounded like standards. Though I anticipated get a frog in my throat when they sang lines such as, \"With a smile like yours, you could get away with murder\" on \"For You\", seeing Sternberg live emphasizes what an incredible guitarist they are, strumming or fast-picking as if to give their words that much more weight. Extra credit points for their A+ stage banter; after a \"Clown Town\" false start because a bug landed on them, Sternberg said, \"Can you believe Taylor Swift had a bug fly into her mouth and she kept going? That's the toughest thing I've ever seen!\"\n\nNala Sinephro; Photo by Alexa Viscius\n\nNala Sinephro\n\nThree years after releasing her debut album Space 1.8 (Warp), ambient jazz harpist and synth player Nala Sinephro finally arrived to play in the United States, gracing the shady Blue Stage, the crowd getting a respite from the sun and any harsh noise they'd been exposed to so far. Accompanied by Dwayne Kilvington on synth bass, Chelsea Carmichael on tenor sax, and Edward Wakili-Hick on drums, Sinephro hypnotized listeners with arpeggiated builds, rubbery textures, and lengthy grooves. Those who wanted to pick apart the synth and drum polyrhythms and give and take among the musicians, could, while those who wanted to close their eyes and vibe had an equally profound and beautiful experience.\n\nJessica Pratt\n\n\"It's a bad day to be dressed like a pallbearer,\" quipped Jessica Pratt, who brought the L.A. heat with her to a Sunday afternoon set that sounded every bit as immaculately constructed as the sounds of her latest, greatest record Here in the Pitch (Mexican Summer). Indeed, watching her, I couldn't help but think about her self-description as a perfectionist, one who took over three years to finish her less-than-half-an-hour record, but how every note served its purpose. Riley Fleck's percussion emerged during the most impactful moment on \"Get Your Head Out\". Pratt's acoustic guitar created a beautiful fabric with the woodwind swirls of \"Poly Blue\" and back catalog favorite \"Back, Baby\". And though set closer \"Life Is\" was what the crowd was clearly waiting for, I fell in love all over again with the somber lure of \"This Time Around\". Never has a relatively soft set hit so hard.\n\nMannequin Pussy's Marisa Dabice; Photo by Kimberley Ross\n\nMannequin Pussy\n\nA lot of folks posited that Turnstile was the one who brought hardcore to the mainstream. Judging by their packed Blue Stage set, Mannequin Pussy's next in line to garner the genre a new legion of fans. They lulled in the crowd with \"I Don't Know You\", lead singer Marisa Dabice in full-on ASMR chanteuse mode before unleashing her loud bark and deep bite. Like Hartzman of Wednesday, Dabice invited the crowd to participate in a collective scream, but she was alone in her desire to make the crowd confront its own discomfort with the traditional taboos of religion, sex, and--yes--the word \"pussy.\" As loud as they were, the band sounded pristine, from backing vocalist/keyboardist/guitarist Carolyn Haynes' high notes to bassist Colins \"Bear\" Regisford's clarity over the accelerated blast of \"OK? OK! OK? OK!\" Before Regisford took the lead vocals, he shouted out the Black and brown folks in the crowd, a reminder that no matter how mainstream hardcore might get, it should never lose its radical inclusiveness.\n\nMUNA; Photo by Kimberley Ross\n\nMUNA\n\nIn case you weren't aware, MUNA do want the revolution, but it's important to them to, as lead singer Katie Gavin said when introducing mega-bop \"Silk Chiffon\", \"carve out spaces of joy.\" Really, how could you not be joyful, surrounded by beautiful people, getting down to the synaptic funky bass of \"Number One Fan\", skittering drums of \"Runner's High\", twangy strums of \"Taken\", and dancefloor sparkle of \"Home By Now\"? And though MUNA is for everyone, they made sure to give their queer fans special dedications on \"Solid\" and \"Kind of Girl\".\n\nLes Savy Fav\n\nSeeing Les Savy Fav at Riot Fest 2021, I could see, in hindsight, why performing again would have given them the kick in the pants to write music again. After all, as much as lead singer Tim Harrington's a wonderfully volatile performer, the rest of the band is whip-tight, just begging to churn out riffs and snare hits that you could cut your finger on. Earlier this year, the quintet released their first record in 14 years, OUI, LSF (Frenchkiss), a surprisingly varied collection of tunes equally dreamy, reflective, and vulnerable as barn-burning and mosh-inducing. During their Sunday night sub-headlining Blue Stage set, the band picked fitting songs from the new record, especially to pair with classics. \"Void Moon\", named after a time when it's dangerous--astrologically speaking--to make decisions, was consistent with Harrington's rash-as-ever behavior during shows, which culminated in him unplugging the stage clock and the band having to have the mic cut on them for going over time. The carnal \"Limo Scene\" appeared only a couple songs after its spiritual sibling, set opener \"The Equestrian\". And \"World Got Great\" matched the unabashed highs of \"The Sweat Descends\" and \"Let's Get Out of Here\". Even if they don't release another album for 14 years, Les Savy Fav remain essential live performers.\n\nPrefuse 73 Interview: Chiseled Patience\n\nPhoto courtesy of Prefuse 73\n\nBY JORDAN MAINZER\n\nFor almost three decades, Guillermo Scott Herren has been producing tracks, delving into hip-hop, IDM, glitch, and ambient, best known under the moniker Prefuse 73. Like for many, the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns allowed Herren the opportunity to take things a bit slower and truly, for once, consider what was next, as opposed to throwing things at the wall and seeing what stuck. Living at the time in Midtown Manhattan, during the protests of the murder of George Floyd, Herren found himself rolling his eyes at user submission location-based safety apps like Citizen. Though some protesters were damaging property, Herren saw that the unsubstantiated user submissions on Citizen that tended to greatly exaggerate crime were finding their way, virtually unchecked, onto local news media. At the same time, while casually making music, he had on in the background 70s and 80s vigilante films like Death Wish, seeing a parallel between their sensationalism of crime and that of the modern day news media. The music he was making, Herren realized, was forming a theme, exploring the absurdity of the modern day by paying musical homage to the soundtracks of the films he was watching. The cheekily titled New Strategies for Modern Crime was born.\n\nSo far, New Strategies for Modern Crime has been split into two volumes: Vol. 1 was released in March, with Vol. 2 coming out last month, both on Lex Records. Both albums use guitars, synths, horns, woodwinds, and drums to capture the vibe of 70s/80s vigilante film soundtracks. To fill out its sound, Herren turned to jazz multi-instrumentalist and composer Remy Le Boeuf, electronic producer and drummer Nova Zaii (aka Everett Reid), and Herren's partner, Vanessa Maldonado, on synths and processing. \"A lot of the instrumentation was...typical of a small ensemble,\" Herren told me last month over the phone, from his home an hour outside of New York City, emphasizing the difference between his new material and the more electronic material he's known for. \"That's what I had to work with. Either me or [Zaii] playing drums, or me on bass and doing keys and essential writing, or me doing guitar parts with [Le Boeuf], who plays a multitude of horns. Just making it as authentic to that sort of time and feeling.\"\n\nThough on Bandcamp, the second volume is presented in tandem with the first, Herren insists they are distinct. On Vol. 1, he was more explicitly paying tribute to vigilante film soundtracks, on tracks like the funky and confident \"She Needs No Introduction\", drum, bass, and sax-laden groove \"Desperate Demise\", and warped, woozy free jazz-indebted frea-kout “Lullabyes and Awakenings”. Vol. 2, meanwhile, Herren treats as a manipulation of many of the sounds on Vol. 1. It definitively leans more experimental, from the thumping, crunchy glitch of \"Complete Rejection\" to the atonal keyboards of \"Weather Systems\". Its songs also traverse more territory within themselves. \"Canine Chorus\"'s rolling drums and synth line break down into disorienting and chopped panning, while \"Python Print\"'s string plucks and snappy, synaptic drums melt into a drone. Best, Herren's material may or may not continue to collapse in on itself, but what's certain is there will be more: He's already recorded an EP and is working on what might be a third volume. \"As time goes by,\" he said, \"I keep thinking, 'Where else does this go?'\"\n\nRead my conversation with Herren below, edited for length and clarity. We talked about New Strategies for Modern Crime, but also the world's broken brains post-COVID, Herren's relationship with his earliest material, the music industry today, being influenced by other mediums, and more.\n\nSince I Left You: Do you consider New Strategies for Modern Crime one big project, or do you separate the two volumes in your mind?\n\nGuillermo Scott Herren: I think it might have just become two. I started working on it during COVID, so things were sort of slow and backed up. It was becoming this nonstop flow of music. Some stuff I would keep, and some stuff I would take away. It ended up being two by accident, in a way.\n\nSILY: How would you describe the difference between the two?\n\nGSH: They're definitely along the same lines. They're from the same movie. They're from the same group of scenes. Something like that. But the second one is more a manipulation of the first. The first is, all the way through, more live. It was written out and played. The second one is still live and played but it has more manipulation going on.\n\nSILY: The second one seems to be a little more self-referential. You have a title in the first volume with the words \"Scene One\", but it's not till the second volume where you have a lot of titles with \"Scene Two\" and variations on a theme.\n\nGSH: Totally. I wanted this to be written out sort of like a soundtrack, sort of like scenes. I got more comfortable [with] that idea, especially [in] the second [volume.] It's not the same song, but the scene is there. [They might share] a key or one sound.\n\nSILY: The impetus for this project was, among other things, the sensationalizing of crime. Were you using the Citizen app to track reports of crime during COVID?\n\nGSH: Yeah. I was living in Midtown. It's just a shithole. No one really wants to live there, and most of the people who do live there have lived there for a really long time and have these amazing old apartments, or they're actors living there because of Times Square proximity. The rest is just complete breakdown: corporate people going two and from work, and everything that goes between, since forever. It's the most condensed part.\n\nPeople go crazy on Citizen. It's a crime propaganda machine.\n\nSILY: I was first aware of Citizen was during the George Floyd protests. Here in Chicago, there was looting and smashed windows, and people became so terrified that they downloaded Citizen and would track mostly unsubstantiated reports of things going down in random alleys, and it would make them feel unsafe. It then became sensationalized by local media.\n\nGSH: That's super on point. When I first got it, it was more like a novelty. Somebody was like, \"Get this app, you can see random shit happening.\" Somebody watching somebody do something on the street was how it started out, pre-COVID. Then, it just turned into people compelled to report what they're seeing, making situations sort of happen. People were battling for a story on the Citizen app. It was pathetic. It was most likely heightened because of the protests, to a ridiculous degree.\n\nSILY: These albums were also inspired by crime movies from the 70s and 80s. In a city like New York, those times were pretty rough and ragged, but those movies, too, tended to sensationalize things.\n\nGSH: Beyond sensationalize. But that's what's cool about them. At least they were movies. There was stuff going on, and I'm not negating that, but with the movies you have rip-offs of revenge movies, variations on Death Wish, but somehow, they'd all have ridiculous storylines that were pretty much the same. Here we are in 2024, and it's reality. This is our scared reality versus when things were actually happening. I'm not saying things don't happen. Crazy shit happens all the time. But when it does, it's an explosion. The news has the embedded idea to sensationalize everything that happens since protests and being locked up during COVID.\n\nYou can see that people are crazy. I just watched that Anthony Fauci hearing. You can see how people's minds just broke, the way people are attacking him as if he caused COVID. Any sort of QAnon-adjacent thing. They're still fighting it. It's a collective trauma. It's just weird how the narrative shifts, you know.\n\nSILY: Have you seen the film Nightcrawler? I think it's a good example of a contemporary movie about crime and the media and might actually go along with the themes you're exploring.\n\nGSH: I think that's a really understated, cool movie, the way they're battling to get to this one scene. They're not making a whole lot of money, but they're still battling for who gets the story. For sure.\n\nSILY: I found it interesting that on both albums, there's a lot of contrast between the \"organic\" sounds versus sounds that are more textured and layered. There are a few moments of sampled vocals, and a lot of sudden shifts. Did you want to make something that couldn't be 100% a soundtrack, something that might throw you off a little bit when listening to it?\n\nGSH: For sure. I didn't want to alienate people with an idea, a record that leaves everybody wondering what just happened. I've done that before, and people don't seem to gravitate towards that sudden change. I just learned that if I wanted to do something that's a complete departure, I would call it something else. I felt like I could still call this Prefuse 73. Upon listening, it has certain elements where you're like, \"Okay, I remember that guy, I remember that album. This is different, but I can hear certain things that might be familiar.\"\n\nSILY: Were you looking back to some of your earliest releases in terms of artistic approach or aesthetic?\n\nGSH: I really try my best not to. I'm not the biggest fan of my own work. As I get older, I've become more of a fan of things like this. There have been albums of mine from when I was younger that I like more than others. But it's kind of embarrassing. Some people might like it, but for me, I feel like I went a little too crazy doing this or that. It's just hard to listen to. Certain techniques are embedded in me, but the sound and the structure of things I have a hard time listening to.\n\nSILY: You're close to your own records. Your earlier releases sound like the era in which they came out; outside listeners can contextualize them with the time period. You remember where you were and what you were feeling when you made it.\n\nGSH: Exactly. I've been asked this in different ways, about older releases: \"Is there a theme you keep throughout?\" [Yes, but] I do it unintentionally. Being so close to [the music], you don't want to repeat [anything], but you sometimes can't help it. [If] you learn to play drums a certain way, you can advance and excel but you're still gonna be that drummer. You're going to gravitate towards certain things. I think I gravitate towards certain sounds and in a certain range, color, and textural scheme no matter what I'm making.\n\nSILY: When coming up with the track titles on these two records, did you have specific scenes in your head with similar names, or were you just trying to create a vibe by contextualizing the sounds with some words?\n\nGSH: It's more along the latter's lines. Everything was a working title at first. For instance, it could be, \"Night Song\" or \"Summer Song\". I never have been one to title a song before making it. It usually starts with a couple bars of something, you title it, and when it's all together, you figure [the real title] out. [On these albums], the title[s] didn't make a difference until everything was pulled together into [its assigned] volume.\n\nSILY: Have you ever scored a film?\n\nGSH: I scored a film in Spain. I did the whole thing, and it was approved. I got paid for it. But when it came out, my music only ended up in the trailer for the film, and there was no music in the entire movie, meaning aesthetically, there was no music. I've contributed to soundtracks. I'm working on some horror stuff coming up soon I can't really talk about.\n\nAll I really want to do is score stuff at this point and release records as they come to my mind. Scoring is a different realm. It's so fun to connect and work with imagery in this day and age, as opposed to just making a record and hoping for the best. I don't make music because I want to make records. I just love to make music, and matching it with imagery is probably the best fit for me because I don't tour all the time. I like playing live when the conditions are right, but I don't like, say, going on tour for a year straight and not doing any music and not having any ties to what's going on with anything. You get a real disconnect when you're touring. The standard ideas of making records and touring in the old school ways, I'm sort of burnt out on all that at this point.\n\nSILY: I think it's proven to be unsustainable for a lot of folks.\n\nGSH: For sure. For this [material], I would love to do some shows, and I plan to with this group of music, but there's no way I could afford to get that many players together for a long tour. We could only do some major market big cities. It is unsustainable. Unless you're new and trying to come up. I did it. Everybody has to do it. At this point in my life, I'm like, \"I can't do that.\" [laughs] I can't even be away for two weeks and have everything be normal. I have to plan out every day now. More organization goes into life at this point than it did when you were in your late teens and 20s and you were just going on tour to support something because you're brand new and you're going for it, going out in a van.\n\nSILY: It's proven to be a reverse curve, where it's often better to be a really small band that plays cheaply and locally rather than in the middle ground of not necessarily being big enough to sell out an arena or have your own catering but playing mid-sized venues on month-long tours. These acts are losing money even though they're more popular and playing bigger venues than ever before.\n\nGSH: It's crazy. You can call me old, but I think that's the negative side of people not being able to decide what they're really into, [as a result of] gatekeeping Spotify owners and billionaires creating algorithms controlling what you see and what's considered good. I just feel like it's a different time. There's no power shift. It's like an authoritarian government. I don't see many other Taylor Swifts. A lot of people don't want to be at the top and just want to play, but they're over-saddled by this corporatized industry. It's always been corporatized, of course, but it's very, very hard these days. It doesn't make much sense. Everything is taken from the musician. It goes way beyond music. It's in film and books, everything that's artistic that's become devalued and more valuable for people with money and corporate positions. A lot of people just want to tour, play for their fans, and make enough money to at the very least, break even or come home with just a little bit. That's not asking too much.\n\nSILY: I've done a coupleinterviews with Small Isles, who started his project by creating a piece of music that was a score to a film that didn't exist. In the meantime, he got some actual film scoring work. The project has turned into a symbiotic relationship with his film scoring work. He keeps imagining other movies and creates scores for them, but in the creative process, he'll take some of that music and use it for the real film he's scoring, or vice versa. He's finding a way to creatively supplement the original studio album with hired work.\n\nGSH: I'm totally on board with that. That's exactly what I'm trying to do. I guess that's what I'm kind of doing. There are certain [opportunities] that come up where people are really insisting, and you're like, \"Okay.\" You stop what you're doing and you go into it. I feel you. What he's doing, that whole framework, makes the most sense. You have to be creative.\n\nI remember listening to an interview with a label owner during COVID. He said, \"All of these bands out there need to be thinking about teaming up with your local coffee shop.\" There are so many creative ways to do this, whether collaborating with a company that does something different than you, or film, all these other different mediums. It's important for artists if they want to get by now, if they want to be serious about their career.\n\nSILY: Of course, there's always going to be a subset of people calling one thing or another \"selling out,\" but if you think about what are considered some of the greatest paintings of all time, those were private commissions by some of the world's wealthiest people.\n\nGSH: The best way to think and be in this industry now, from everything I've learned, is to stay proactive. When those collaborations come up, just do them if they make sense. When I first started, I thought, \"Fuck this, I'm not gonna collaborate with this company or brand because of what they do.\" Now, it's more, \"What's the damage they do. Are they aligned with my morals?\" If they're aligned with bombing Palestinians, I'm not gonna do it. But if they're just a bunch of dudes making food, I'll do it. When it comes to selling out, you're not doing any damage doing something with other companies, it's what's behind the companies. What kind of damage are they doing within your reality? If they're a part of the problem, maybe say no, even though it sucks. Don't say yes to the worst people or people funding the worst things happening on the planet.\n\nMost of us have so much in front of us where we can investigate you in 10 minutes to find out who is backing [what] company, whether they're responsible for these huge bombs that they're manufacturing, or they shit on and broke up a union that a small group of people were trying to form for better wages. Those are the types of people you don't want to work with. That falls into the idea of being proactive. Be proactive in looking for stuff and not working with the wrong people. In the long run, they're not gonna do you any favors. Once they get what they needed, they're gonna be gone.\n\nSILY: When making music, you have playing in the background images or movies to give you some direct inspiration. Do you ever find that something you're consuming art-wise when you're not actively sitting down making music, nonetheless ends up seeping its way into your music? Or are you pretty good about shutting off outside influences?\n\nGSH: [Things seep in] all the time. Since the beginning, I was always inspired by architecture, certain sorts of design, the way things are laid out. It's hard to explain, but when you think about patterns and grids in a city or planning, those sort of things seep into your work somehow. The edges and cuts. Maybe because I spent almost 8 years going to art school, those things were in my mind bubbling at all times. [I've always been influenced by] other sorts of media that I could never do, like architecture, the way a building is made, design, even clothes. You're not purposefully putting it in your work, but it becomes a part of your flow, all sort of jumbled up with human emotion like love and anger.\n\nSILY: These two records definitely have a physical and spatial aspect to them, the way the songs are constructed. They are, in a way, multimedia already, even if the film they're scoring is imaginary. So it would make sense that something like architecture could find its way in there.\n\nGSH: For sure. That's the way I see writing a song. I've never been somebody that sits down the way some people can, with an acoustic guitar. Everything that I do is more like, \"I have to knock this corner down here, shave this off here.\" It's more like you're building a structure whenever you're making something; even if it's just recording something a certain way, you're manipulating the way it's being captured.\n\nSILY: Will there be a third volume of this material?\n\nGSH: I have an EP recorded. I sort of want to keep on working in this mode. I'm really comfortable in this workflow. I like creating these tracks, not going too crazy when I'm recording it, and thinking of the other instruments that will fit into certain spaces. It's a more patient sort of way of writing, if that makes sense. I'm not very patient when it comes to writing. This gives me a little more time to look at the big picture. For every other record I've released, I make it with more urgency. It shows. I've always been a bit too maximalist with everything. It's cool to sit back and think as I'm putting things in.\n\nSILY: There are times of minimalism and space on these two records, and times that are a bit more layered, but I would never call any of it maximalist.\n\nGSH: That's why I'm more into it. I'm more attracted to it at this point. Despite similarities to anything I've done, these two volumes are something I can play for somebody without feeling like I'm challenging the shit out of them or their mind. As opposed to something from back in the day that I made, where people look at me like, \"What? What is happening right now?\" They listen to it five times and say, \"It's cool, I guess, but I can't really follow what you're doing.\" Plenty of people who listen to it are not musicians, they're just friends of mine who have always been around to listen my music and say, \"It's cool, man, I just don't understand what the fuck you're doing though.\" It's a little too weird or out there for them. Especially in the early days, I had friends who were into straight up hip-hop or very traditional synth [music.] They'd say things [about my music] like, \"It's very open-minded.\" They're trying to say it's weird or fucked up. I would think, \"I think I'm doing something right because they're not saying, 'This is good,' or, 'This is great.'\" They're always scratching their head, like, \"What are you doing?\"\n\nSILY: Do you not want people to scratch their head as much anymore?\n\nGSH: If they do, that's still cool. I still love that reaction. But I think there was a time where I would throw everything at what I was working at. I would be done, and it was like 6 hours. I'd maybe spend another 6 hours mixing it, but the song itself was done very quickly. Even if it wasn't all the way thought through, I wouldn't change it because I was very stubborn. People scratch their head because it's like you say something off the top of your head and you have to expect people to understand what you've just said.\n\nSILY: Is there anything you've been listening to, watching, or reading lately that's caught your attention?\n\nGSH: I've just been working on my car a lot. I've never wanted to work on cars, but it happened during COVID. When I was really young and got my first car, I was taught how to work on it, so I just started getting a car, working on it, selling it, getting the same exact car, and repeating, just to separate my mind from music. I would just sell it for the same price I bought it for. There's no capital or money I'm making from it. I probably lose money doing it. But I love the mechanics of it. I feel like it sparks new ideas.\n\nSILY: You save money by not having to go to the mechanic!\n\nGSH: I only have to go to the mechanic for taking tires off the rim. I don't have a ton of tools.\n\nSILY: Do you have the same appreciation for the tactility of older cars that you do for older synthesizers?\n\nGSH: My partner really does not want me to talk about cars, because it's a huge disconnect. She doesn't care. When she met me, I didn't talk about cars unless it was like, \"Damn, that's a cool car,\" if I saw one driving down the street. But now, I'll be like, \"I saw the dopest Volvo 240 driving down the street today, and this person put so much work into it, it was so beautiful,\" and she's like, \"So what?\" You can see a car, and if your eye gets fixated on that car, you see it everywhere. It's sort of like the Slug Bug game. Wherever I go, I see my car. We wave at each other, thumbs up, peace sign. [My partner's] not about it. She doesn't give a shit. She said, \"As long as it drives, cool.\" When we're stuck, it's not cool. Basically, I'm in this alone. It's a very lonely game I'm in.\n\nSILY: But it helps you clear your mind in the long run.\n\nGSH: It erases or takes away everything you're thinking about musically. You can still think about music, but it's a good meditation. I put it parallel to gardening. That's what my partner does. She has all kinds of gardening stuff outside. She's normally a teacher and a librarian, so she's not doing what she would normally do. It's the exact same thing [with car maintenance]. You're doing it totally silently, nobody's looking at you, you're in the moment. Being up here, one hour away from the city, I just went head-first into it.\n\nIt's kind of a fun thing to do. It's a very strange fixation. Wherever you go, if you stop the car, people come up to you, and you meet completely different people you were ever friends with. You'll stay in touch with them for parts. You'll keep their number. That's one of the things you have to do in life: Make a friend who has absolutely nothing to do with you, who is in a completely different age range, and there's one thing that brings you together. Finding commonality with someone you would just walk right past. It's the same as getting into a certain type of music you're obsessed with, or somebody who collected only 7-inch records. Those people would become friends. I would make friends with people who like music from a certain era. It was cool just hanging out and listening to them talk.\n\nLiz Lamere on Alan Vega and Her Solo Career: Whatever Happens, Happens\n\nLiz Lamere; photo by Jasmine Hirst\n\nBY JORDAN MAINZER\n\nLiz Lamere's got a story to tell, and one that won't end any time soon. The former Wall Street lawyer and boxer and current singer-songwriter is also the widow and former creative partner of the late, great Alan Vega, the visual artist and vocalist of landmark proto-punk duo Suicide. Since Vega's death in 2016, Lamere has, in conjunction with Jared Artaud of post-punk act The Vacant Lots, worked to bring to light a wealth of unreleased material from Vega's vault.\n\nAfter the release of 2017's It, the final album Vega recorded before he died, Lamere and Artaud discovered the material that would constitute the 2021 release Mutator. In 2022, they unearthed the songs that would be released this past May as Insurrection (In The Red). It hasn't been until now, however, where there's been a simultaneous awakening of all things Vega. In addition to Insurrection, Artaud co-curated \"Cesspool Saints\", an exhibition of Vega's fine art works, which opened two months ago at Laurent Godin's Gallery in Paris. Lamere, meanwhile, co-wrote Vega's biography with Laura Davis-Chanin, entitled Infamous Dreams: The Life of Alan Vega (Backbeat Books). (The foreword? By none other than Bruce Springsteen.) With a rich collection of songs waiting for ears--material that Lamere and Vega recorded and Vega meticulously documented between actually released Vega solo albums throughout the 90s and 2000s--it's become clear that Vega's backlog rivals of those like Prince and Arthur Russell, full of albums that are contextualized by what was recorded before and after them but that stand alone as cohesive statements.\n\nLamere; photo by Jasmine Hirst\n\nAt the same time as everything Vega-related, Lamere has finally found not just the time but the will to release her own solo records, an artistic career that Vega always encouraged but never was able to witness. Her songs are certainly different than Vega's in terms of subject matter and aesthetic, but Lamere credits Vega's approach to music-making--be spontaneous and fearless and realize that nothing is a mistake--for informing her artistic process. She started working on her debut, Keep It Alive, during COVID lockdown, and finished the album in mere weeks. Her follow-up, One Never Knows (In The Red), released last month, took a little bit longer to make, understandably when Lamere was working on Vega's biography and Insurrection all at the same time. Thankfully, Lamere was able to separate the entities, another thing she took from Vega. \"It wasn't too difficult to compartmentalize because I wore so many different hats and did so many different things, like Alan,\" Lamere said over the phone last month. \"Alan could be hyper-focused on visual art, and then hyper-focused on music and sound. They might be different sides of the same coin, but whatever he was focused on, he was so in the moment and heavily focused on that creation.\"\n\nTo really understand Vega's perspective on art and life, you have to go far back into the oft-ignored details that inspired Lamere to start writing his biography. Vega was, infamously, 10 years older than everyone thought; various articles incorrectly referred to 1948 as his birth year rather than 1938, confirmed when the 70th birthday release of his recordings was announced in 2008. The parents of the man born Alan Bermowitz were Jewish immigrants. His first wife, Mariette Bermowitz (née Birencwajg), is a Holocaust survivor from Belgium; they met attending Brooklyn College. Lamere credits such a close familial proximity to persecution as a reason for the trauma Vega felt, and also why he chose to not use his birth name as his stage name. But such closeness was also why Vega chose to sing about difficult topics in his music. \"Alan was always hypersensitive to any type of oppression or challenging situations,\" Lamere said. \"He had tremendous empathy. He wasn't doom and gloom but more readily shining a light.\" Out of college, Vega worked for the Welfare Department, eventually quitting because he felt the menial work he was tasked with doing didn't allow him to make a true difference in the lives of the poor. But the experience helped him understand how to secure funding when working with the Art Workers' Coalition, and from the New York State Council on the Arts to help found 24-hour artist-run multimedia gallery MUSEUM: A Project of Living Artists.\n\nAlan Vega; photo by Walter Robinson\n\nVega possessed the ability to apply what he learned from one effort to another, and his mind was well-rounded. He actually enrolled in Brooklyn College not for art, but for astrophysics, having received a scholarship as a result of his building his own telescope(!) But one day, the head of the Art Department witnessed Vega sketching portrait drawings in the cafeteria and immediately recognized Vega's artistic brilliance and convinced him to study art. (Vega's portrait drawings appear in the video for Lamere's \"King City Ghost\".) Vega ended up studying with legendary artists like Kurt Seligmann and Ad Reinhardt. When substitute teaching a class for Reinhardt during his senior year, Vega assigned students a self-portrait to be turned in the next class, but instead of collecting them, he told the students to rip them up. \"When he was telling me the story,\" said Lamere, \"He said, 'You should have seen the look on these kids' faces!'\" But Vega viewed art as, in the words of Lamere, \"coming from a pure place of expression,\" not of preciousness, and one worthy of consuming your life. Vega met Martin Rev and formed Suicide in 1970, garnering notice for their wild live shows throughout the New York punk scene. After they released their self-titled debut in 1977, they toured with The Clash, an infamous time during which the crowd, unable to understand the Suicide's artistic vision, would throw switchblades at the band. \"Alan was willing to be...out there front and center and put his life on the line, literally,\" Lamere said. \"He believed so strongly that what [Suicide was] doing was breaking new ground and important in its own right.\"\n\nVega had been releasing solo albums for a decade before Lamere came in the picture; he met her while making 1990's Deuce Avenue, the record that returned to the beloved electronic minimalism of Suicide. Though the actual release of solo albums was sporadic, he and Lamere never stopped making music. \"When we were in the studio together all those years, I was very much the type of person thinking about releasing albums, whereas Alan wasn't structured in that way,\" Lamere said. \"His thought was, 'We're going into the studio to create sound, and whatever happens, happens...' Part of his process was he would just keep moving forward. Unless I said, 'Hit stop,' so we could put out an album of what we'd been working on right at [that] moment in time, he would keep evolving and moving forward on new material.\" Vega constantly wrote poetry in his notebooks, often using what he wrote for ad-libbed song lyrics; Lamere was actively involved in mixing their recordings. At the same time, Vega was a staunch documenter. He would burn a CD of what he and Lamere had worked on in the studio and note down changes he thought they needed to make to each song. Even the titles of the songs from Mutator and Insurrection came from his notebooks.\n\nInsurrection artwork design by Michael Handis\n\nThe extent to which, upon being done with a song or an album, Vega moved on, proved to be extreme, and would have ripple effects on Lamere's solo career. The two, along with French director Marc Hurtado, would tour Europe after recording a solo album and perform the unreleased songs they'd recorded. (\"The Europeans have heard a lot of this stuff before,\" joked Lamere about Mutator and Insurrection.) For the songs that had been released, Vega would rely on Lamere to feed him lines so that he could give the audience at least something recognizable. \"I would be chanting little phrases, he would hear that, and he would riff on it, and the audience would be happy even though the lyrics [were] mostly completely different,\" Lamere said. \"I learned to 'sing' because Alan never wanted to rehearse anything...I kind of learned a little bit how to project my voice.\" Meanwhile, upon hearing it for the first time, Vega didn't even remember \"Nike Soldier\", a track long-time engineer Perkin Barnes had digitized and Lamere chose for a split single with The Vacant Lots in 2014. Lamere's the opposite. \"When we first started mixing [Insurrection], I could literally remember and envision the days in the studio I was laying down [those riffs].\" But the ultimate story comes from when Springsteen, touring Devils & Dust, invited Vega to one of his shows, as he had been covering Suicide classic \"Dream Baby Dream\" during the encore. \"[Vega] literally was sitting with Jesse [Malin], they're waiting for the show to start, and on the PA comes the song 'Dujang Prang' that he and I had done in 1995,\" Lamere said. \"Alan turns to Jesse and says, 'This is really good, do you know who this is?' Jesse said, 'Alan, that's your song.' That's classic Alan: been there, done that, don't wanna hear it.\"\n\nIt was during the release of The Vacant Lots split single where Vega gave Artaud and Lamere his blessing to unearth songs from the vault. The single happened when Artaud reached out to Vega, sharing The Vacant Lots' cover of Vega's \"No More Christmas Blues\". The two men became fast friends, as Artaud, living in Brooklyn Heights a subway stop away from Vega and Lamere in Lower Manhattan, often visited. \"Jared would come over here and sit and talk to Alan for hours about everything,\" Lamere said. \"He had listened to every piece of music that Alan had pretty much ever done. He understood Alan's philosophy of creation and the minimalism and the existential philosophers that Alan had studied.\" As for Lamere, Vega knew that her approach to producing his music was intuitive. \"After Alan heard 'Nike Soldier', I said, 'Alan, you have no idea how much material is in the computer in the studio of what we've done over the years,'\" Lamere said. \"He said, 'I know. Once I'm gone, you should feel free to put it out because I trust your judgement. You've worked with me for so long, you're my co-producer.' I could go in and make these tracks sound completely different. But I make what Alan would want. He's still so present with us because he had such a strong influence on us. It's part of our DNA. That's the reality.\"\n\nLamere; photo by Jasmine Hirst\n\nInsurrection was recorded in the late 90s, and you can hear its influence on the material that would make up 1999's 2007. The album is a snapshot of an era for Vega, New York City, and the world at large. Dante, Vega and Lamere's child, was about to be born, so Vega's mind was occupied with the post-Gulf War, pre-9/11 state of a city and country rife with racism and capitalistic rot. (The mention of 9/11 is not teleological; Vega literally had premonitions of a terror attack in New York City.) Songs like \"Sewer\" and \"Invasion\" sport thumping, propulsive beats and clattering, machine-like percussion, the most messed-up club songs you've ever heard, Vega chanting like a street urchin. The presciently titled \"Murder One\" and \"Genocide\" are circular, droning, and forward-lurching. The instrumentation is perfect for Vega's mantras and pleas to \"Make a new reality!' Lamere's One Never Knows, though a personal album whose singles' videos feature Lamere sort of half-boxing, half-dancing, a callback to her earlier career, echoes Vega's idealistic spirit. \"Don't destroy the dream tonight,\" she sings on the dystopian \"If Only\", an almost 50-year-later spiritual sibling to Suicide's best known song.\n\nOne Never Knows, like Keep It Alive, was engineered by Dante at their Dujang Prang home studio, where Alan held his sculptures. Before the pandemic, Dante had been working with hip-hop artists, but as they weren't coming in during lockdown, Lamere asked him to help her with her solo debut. Dante sang in The Choir of Trinity Wall Street for 10 years and purportedly has perfect pitch, whereas Lamere is not formally trained. \"He wants to help other people with their vision,\" Lamere said of her son. \"I do say to him once in a while, because I run a lot of sounds through the keyboard, 'What key is this?'...He knows I like dissonance, so he says, 'If you like it, it works.'\" Lamere's taking a key from Vega and not wanting to get technical any time soon. \"I'm sure Miles Davis had his pick of brilliant musicians to work with, but Alan used to say, 'Miles Davis liked working with people who weren't necessarily formally trained.' They didn't say, 'You're not supposed to do that,' or, 'This is what you're supposed to do here, this chord progression.' No! It's none of that. There are no rules,\" Lamere said.\n\nLamere; photo by Jasmine Hirst\n\nLamere's planning on taking the same approach to her recording as playing live, but with a little bit of her boxing knowledge thrown in. \"When I was performing with Alan, I was always playing effects machines in the background. It's a whole different animal carrying the show front and center,\" she said. \"For me, it's like getting in the ring sparring. You have to be hyper-focused. The adrenaline kicks in. It's a great feeling...It scares the shit out of me ahead of time. In the moment, I absolutely love it. Alan was the same way. He wouldn't even be thinking about getting on stage, but as soon as he did, he kind of embraced it.\"\n\nAs always, her musical endeavors will constitute at least some work with the Vega vault. For one, according to Lamere, there are about 4 or 5 albums worth of material from the 8 years between the release of 2007 and Station alone, from when they were first raising Dante, as well as even more from after Station, despite Vega suffering a stroke in 2012. \"I love the opportunity for people to hear what I'm doing and discover what Alan did and is continuing to do,\" Lamere said. \"I love the fact that he's still influencing people from beyond.\"\n\nOne Never Knows artwork: Jasmine Hirst\n\nWalt Disco Interview: The Truest Picture\n\nPhoto by Izzy Leach\n\nBY JORDAN MAINZER\n\nThey're growing as a band--sure--but they're also simply able to reveal more of themselves. Glasgow post-punk quintet Walt Disco broke out in 2022 with their debut album Unlearning, a stellar, concise collection of indie rock songs that was stitched together over the Internet during pandemic-era lockdowns. Listening to sophomore album The Warping, out Friday via Lucky Number, at first, you wonder what Unlearning might have sounded like had the band members been able to collaborate in the same room. Then again, Walt Disco has proved to impress due to their clear ability to create something big with constraints, and now, deliver something cohesive with a plethora of options at their fingertips. For The Warping, the band had pre-album recording sessions with Lucas Polo (at the studio of none other than Phil Manzanera of Roxy Music), co-produced the album with Chris McCrory, got Vale Studio's Chris D'Adda to engineer, and collaborated with string and horn players to flesh out already existing arrangements. The result is, well, whatever the opposite of a sophomore slump is, a hard-to-avoid pitfall when your debut already a clear artistic voice. Instead, Walt Disco have provided the glam rock record of the year.\n\nOf course, Walt Disco didn't choose such an aesthetic just because it sounded cool: They needed something to match the grandiosity and gamut of emotions The Warping's songs exude. Lead vocalist Jocelyn Si sings about getting older and gaining self-confidence, often in the context of gender dysphoria they've felt throughout their life. Fittingly, the title track represents the greatest encapsulation of the album's themes and aesthetic, Si delivering bits of stark truth atop high-pitched synth whirrs, textured piano and acoustic guitar, cinematic strings, and staccato percussion reminiscent of Roxy Music and The Psychedelic Furs. Namesake single \"Jocelyn\" imagines a conversation between singer and mother, a gently galloping song with electric picking, thudding drums, fluttering woodwinds, and slide guitar, Si looking at themselves from what feels like an outside perspective on lines like, \"Her name was Jocelyn / She had a worried grin / A mole upon her chin,\" but ultimately inhabiting their true self. Their ruminations on identity carve other paths, too. Nursery rhyme-inspired \"Black Chocolate\" tackles the warm parts of family, connecting over food, simplicity that nonetheless wields seemingly infinite emotional power, represented by the song's fast strings, atonal horns, electric synth lines, and huge programmed drum beat.\n\nMuch of The Warping is about change, both tangible and in the past, and inevitable and in the future, and "
