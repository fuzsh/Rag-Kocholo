        "text": "Couldn't stand Lillian Raines on Guiding Light. Weak woman who allowed her crazy broke husband to terrorize her daughter. Then years later she gets breast cancer and uses it as an excuse to sleep with her best friend's husband.\n\nI hated Buzz Cooper too. Fug deadbeat loser who somehow was swimming in pussy. I blame his character for getting Fiona Hutchison's Jenna killed off. She was stuck on an island with him and had nowhere else to go.\n\nWhen Buzz and Lillian got married, I believed they deserved each other. Had the show not been canceled, I would have enjoyed fastforwarding through their (twice-monthly) scenes.\n\nAssholes.\n\nI loved Natalie on OLTL! But I get she could be alienating and her acting wasn't the best but I felt she had tons of charisma.\n\nI hated the second Todd though. He seemed the opposite of Roger Howarth's version and he became so dominant. They also played him off more as sexy which I thought was a bad look. I was so happy when they undid that story.I do think the actor was good though. I also did hate Roger's version actually but it was different in the sense that I respected the stories and direction. With second Todd, I was more annoyed by him than I was afraid, and it felt like we were supposed to root for him.\n\nAnother character I hated but this time due to bad acting was the Jen character on OLTL.\n\nI also hated Sonny on GH even though I didn't watch that. But I've always hated \"tough macho\" gangsters with hearts of gold.\n\nLUKE SPENCER\n\nI realize this is Soap Opera blasphemy but I hated this character!\n\nNothing rang true about this character. He was one of the most inauthentic soap characters I ever watched.\n\nHe was supposed to be a pussy hound but people in space could see the man was gay!\n\nHe was supposed to be cool but his acting was an Eminen type (imitation Black man). All I saw was a nerdy White boy over-acting and trying to disco dance! LOL\n\nThe character was supposed to be handsome but was literally the UGLIEST younger man on the show!\n\nHe was supposed to be so charming and irresistible that good girl Laura Baldwin fell in love with him after he RAPED her?Stupidest storyline EVER!\n\nHe also murdered both his parents yet they somehow \"redeemed\" him? I hated that.\n\nLuke and Laura also never even had chemistry, but Genie Francis was beautiful and an amazing actor. SHE made it work.\n\nGenie Francis had much better chemistry with smart and handsome law student Scotty Baldwin. I loved that pairing. There was not enough character contrast between Scotty and Luke (or maybe it was just Geary's horrible acting). It was never believable to me that she would leave Scotty for Luke. No Fuckin way!\n\nThis character could have been so much more with some tweaks to the writing and a better actor.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on alter-ego Bill Eckert, which was essentially Luke in a bad wig (even worse than Luke's ridiculous wanna-be Afro).\n\nLuke, Bobbie and Ruby were Poor White Trash from the other side of the tracks, but they woulda been a lot more interesting if GH woulda made them Black. It seems that was what they wanted to do but in the 1970s I guess they didn't have the balls!\n\nGH was still a great show during this time because compared to other soaps, they still had very high production value which included lots of great storylines, characters and really good looking and accomplished actors, despite this Luke Spencer mess!\n\nHe was such an awful character.\n\nI agree with so many of these. There are a lot of characters that I used to like that I do not like now. I liked Carly on GH until Laura Wright took over. I just find her insufferable. I don't like her much on GL either.\n\nI've never liked Sammy on Days of Our Lives. She just rubs me the wrong way. I've also got a bit tired of John too. Melissa Horton is isn't a bad character but Melissa Reeves is a sanctimonious bitch.\n\nI like Nikki and Victor on The Young and the Restless up to the 90's, but I can't stand either one now, and Eric Braeden is overexposed and seems to be a prick in real life although I didn't like the fact that he was very supportive of Marla Adams.\n\nI have never liked Heather Tom ever since she debuted as Victoria on Y&R. I don't think I have ever seen her smile, even on One Life to Live where the character was supposed to be outgoing. I am not a Bold and the Beautiful fan but the few times I seen her, she has the same sad woe is me face. It gets old after a while yet she continues to get all the awards.\n\nKrystal and Babe could have been great characters if they had kept Babe as a bad girl with moments of vulnerability and Krystal as a bad mother with shades of original recipe Opal. Instead they had Babe is Love and Krystal was this Mama Bear Earthy Mother protecting her baby girl. They really tried hard to make Tad and Krystal a super couple and they never had any chemistry. They should have paired him with Simone or Liza. Krystal did have chemistry with Adam and Daviid and those couples could of work if they kept her a schemer, instead they went for the overdone Adam/David victimizing their helpless wife.\n\nJulie Chandler really annoyed me at times. I think the only time Lauren Holly did not bug me was Picket Fences.\n\nThis is probably an unpopular one, but would not have minded Stuart getting hit by a bus, especially in the later years when he and Marion kept harassing poor Liza (sadly both Marion and Liza were watered down at that time).\n\nProbably not on long enough to make the list, but who thought it was a good idea to give Kit Fisher a heavy rape storyline right away, especially since she could not act. She was not beloved.\n\nI was watching when Katie K showed up. It was kind of strange how they all of a sudden took Emily Anne, the ingenue they wanted us to cheer on the previous year or two, and have her do a 180 to prop-up this bland character they just introduced. Plus, Joey really seemed to like Emily Anne, so it was hard to believe all of a sudden this new character was this great love. It seemed like a lazy retread of Jeff-Mary-Erica, with little build-up.\n\nI am not sure of Liz Vassey made someone angry, when they ushered her off to the looney bin, they did not show much hope for recovery. It is not like she felt bad and wanted to get better. I remember someone asked Donna how Emily Anne was a few years later, and I expected her to say doing better - and it was - not well. With her father as Billy Clyde and how she found out, it was not out of the realm of possibility that she might have some mental health issues, but the way it happened and over Katie seemed at odds for how they portrayed her most of her run. It seemed like all of a sudden they wanted to get rid of the character and did as quickly as possible, making it so people would not want her to return.\n\nI started watching AMC summer of '87 (summer job had it on during lunch). I think it was having a slow resurgence after a bit of a doldrums following the early 80's golden age. When I see clips from the couple of years before I started watching, the only thing that stands out is the Natalie/Erica rivalry and am guessing Mark's drug addiction was well done. I think the rest of the 80s were pretty decent and then it was pretty strong for a good portion of the 90's, at times really strong.\n\nBy 2000 it was pretty spotty, but still seemed salvageable. I think the last chance of it righting the ship was around the time of Bianca's coming out -- new characters Leo, David, early-Greenlee and early Vanessa were pretty strong. Bianca's coming out was well done. It is too bad they did not follow it up with having her help Frankie come to terms that she was gay and start a relationship. It would have been a good follow-up, but they seemed pretty hesitant to actually put Bianca in a relationship that would be on screen much of the time. I think by 2005 it was pretty painful and I largely gave up - Babe - Ryan - Zack who might have been ok if we were supposed to think he was a controlling Adam type and not some hero...\n\nI heard it was a bit stronger at the end, and the Prospect Park show was not bad. I was tempted to check it out, but Prospect Park announced after about one week of shows they were cutting back the episodes, so I assumed it was a lost cause and not going to last.\n\nR336 Frons called himself making half-assed attempts to salvage AMC as best as he could, because the show that he grew to despise was the \"red-headed stepchild\" of ABC, One Life To Live. R&B singer Brandy Norwood was approached to join AMC in or around 2008, however she ended up declining before an agreement was reached during negotiations. When Frons moved AMC to LA in late 2009/early 2010, he was planning to get rid of OLTL in favor or saving AMC, since it was cheaper to produce soaps in LA (ATWT was nearing cancellation, so OLTL was the only remaining soap being produced in NY). However his plan backfired when OLTL's ratings were higher than AMC's (at one point, OLTL even beat GH) so he cancelled both. He moved Frank and Ron to GH even though they both had already agreed to helm OLTL on The Online Network (the deal wasn't signed yet) because he was fans of theirs, just not OLTL. He wanted AMC to stay on the air however it just wasn't bringing in the ratings that ABC wanted. When Susan Lucci was skeptical about traveling back and forth from NY to LA, Deidre Hall (who wasn't on DOOL at the time) was under consideration to join, in hopes of attracting DOOL viewers to AMC.\n\nAll this talk about AMC makes me miss it. That really was a fabulous soap opera which should have lasted.\n\nThe 1980s was when soap operas hit their peak. All the networks even had night time soaps during that era.\n\nSoaps hung on for the first part of the 1990s but the market was saturated and by 2000 soaps were very much on the decline. This was also around the time that the internet kind of blew up and cell phones were huge so people were less limited to tv.\n\nIt seems like each network only kept their flagship soap. ABC kept GH, NBC kept DOOL and CBS kept Y&R. All of those are older than AMC except Y&R. I sometimes wonder if AMC had been on a channel other than ABC they might have been able to hang on. No way were they ever going to beat GH.\n\nI watched all the soaps at some point but AMC was always my favorite.\n\nR356 Frons wanted to keep AMC with GH initially, going so far as to relocate production to Los Angeles. The plan was to drive OLTL into cancellation since they were both underperforming, however OLTL was doing better than AMC ratings wise and with fans, so he thought the move to LA and Charles Pratt writing, Rebecca Budig's return (who had permanently relocated to LA a year prior) would increase ratings, although they didn't so he cancelled both. He wouldn't have been justified in only cancelling OLTL since it was \"the better soap\" according to Michael Logan and others, and he wasn't going to cancel AMC on its own seeing how he didn't particularly care for OLTL. There were rumors of bringing both of them back in recent years either as two half hour soaps or as one soap together (\"All My Life\" was what fans were calling it) however the closest that AMC is coming back to TV is the Primetime serial \"Pine Valley\" that Kelly Ripa and her husband Mark are working on.\n\nR362 Lol that was years after he cancelled them when she gave that interview. Before he did that they were friends and she would've ended up on AMC most likely had Susan Lucci refused to travel to LA to film. I recall they gave all the actors options to get out of their current contracts if they were against the move to LA, or at least appear on recurring since they were pretty much all for the most part settled in and had roots in New York. Jacob Young and Bobbie Eakes were excited about the move to LA (after both having been on B&B for some time) and Rebecca Budig agreed to return because of the move, since one of the reasons she gave for leaving again in early 09 was due to the commute back and forth from her home in LA to NY. Frons had quite the obsession with Budig, along with Kelly Monaco, and the actresses who portrayed Alison on PC, Babe on AMC, Jennifer on OLTL, and Courtney on GH. Fans commented how he was obsessed with a blonde on every ABC soap lol\n\nAmen R372. I loathed AMC and it gets tiring as to how lauded it is. Agnes Nixon seemed very cunty to me too.\n\nHowever, AMC was my mom's \"soap\" and I can get the appeal when I watch the early to late 80's episodes. And I stand by that Julia Barr's scenes when Laura died were some of the best acting I have ever seen. I watched the show for more than a month twice- during that storyline and also Natalie in the Well (Kate Collins WAS awesome) And in that timeframe when AMC was once again kicking ass in the ratings- wasn't it 2nd ranked for a good year or so in 1991/1992 during the Natalie/Janet storyline- my god the show looked absolutely horrible.\n\nHowever, it was extremely cheap to look at (with the exception of some episodes I have seen in late 80's where apparently the executive producer knew how to make a good looking show) and incredibly hokey. It was almost \"smaller than life\".. The comedy was also overrated. It was pure sitcom.\n\nHowever, other than that 1980-88 era, I really do not understand the hype.\n\nI was a massive OLTL fan, and despite its flaws (1990-91 was WORSE than AMC could ever be) it was massively underrated.\n\nGH- Never gave a fuck one way or another. I would rather watched Y&R at any point through 2008 or so.\n\nI haven't watched any soap since 2012 or whenever that Prospect Park debacle occurred. I did not enjoy the Prescott Park OLTL at all.\n\nI was wondering why Ellen did not take out her venom on Andrea Evans or another major star of OLTL at that time.\n\nI can only surmise that this is because Erika became more of a central character in the early to mid 80's shortly before Ellen was fired..\n\nOne thing you can say for sure is that they were never close or remotely friends throughout that 15 year period that they were on the show together.\n\nIt appears that Ellen must of always disliked Erika for her to target her like this.\n\nIts actually scary to me what you can do to someone's reputation.\n\nThe sad fact is Ellen has some valid points and most of her gripes are warranted in my opinion.\n\nBut the Erika thing negates everything she says, and I believe it's a venomous lie.\n\n[quote] wasn't it 2nd ranked for a good year or so in 1991/1992 during the Natalie/Janet storyline-\n\nI think it actually stayed number 2 for a few years into the mid-90's. I believe it fell out of that position post-OJ when Days passed it being the only soap to have a post OJ trial surge with the Marlena possession story.\n\nThey then compounded things by overreacting and trying some over the top Days type stories that did not fit the show - voodoo in Jamaica - Matteo having coma visions. They then did the very unpopular Maria sleeps with Dimitri leading to Erica stealing her baby (although Lucci might have done some of her best work realizing about the affair while dealing with her miscarriage and the scene where she gets Maria to confess and later when she returns the baby).\n\nIt seems like everything they did late 90's onward just made things worse, although they seemed close to getting back on track in the early 2000 with Bianca, Leo, David etc.\n\nProducers and execs know how to hire actors but they don't know how to hire great writers to write for them\n\nDee to AMC could have been great if there were a character and decent writing.\n\nI'm not opposed to actors soap hopping. I loved Doug Marland's Guiding Light and it was tough watching the show be written by Pat Falken Smith and L. Virginia Browne after he left ... then, I read the creative team from Texas was going to GL. How was THAT going to help I thought?\n\nPam Long's GL became my favorite soap opera. She kept some of the old (Ed, Maureen, Alan, Vanessa, Josh, and Ross) and added in so much new (Alexandra, India, Reva, Mindy, Beth, Fletcher) and wrote such great stories -- Josh/Reva/HB, Sonni, Phillip taking down Alan, four Muskateers -- that I got hooked. Never thought I'd love McKinsey in a role other than Iris but I did.\n\nBut bringing a big name star to a show without story? That never works.\n\nR372 I gotta disagree. I watched all three shows off and on and AMC was by far the far superior show.\n\nI do agree with you about GH though. Terrible show and that Rape/Love Story was awful. The only reason it was able to fly was because they already had a captive audience of faithful viewers. GH also seems to constantly lose its way. It doesn't know whether it wants to be a hospital drama or a show about spies and intrigue or half a dozen other things. Most of the characters are pretty one dimensional which makes the whiplash show focus even more troubling.\n\nSorry guys, but OLTL was an awful Soap Opera. I watched every major soap opera at some point and OLTL was one of the worst (probably only second to GL in awfulness). I began watching it because family members watched it. I always referred to it as the \"boring\" show. LOL Had it not been for Robin Strasser, Gerald Anthony and Judith Light, I would have fallen asleep. Those three were awesome by the way.\n\nThe casting and couplings were crazy too. I never liked the Buchanan family (which pretty much was the show). They seemed pretty deplorable. Mia Korf (an Asian woman) was Blair and they recast her as a blonde White woman? I was like WTF? Cord was cute but then they matched him up with Tina Lord who was over the top and someone he seemed to not have any chemistry with. And I don't know what Andrea Evans looks like under all that hair and make up but on the show she looked like an \"EXAGGERATED\" drag queen! She was a hot mess, a complete clown and ugly AF.\n\nOLTL never showed any sustained commitment to diversity. Ellen Holly was the first Black actress to become a recurring character on Daytime TV. She played on OLTL for over 20 years and for her to be unceremoniously fired like that was a travesty. I've read all the articles and seen the videos. I'm not sure who specifically was responsible for this, but OLTL did her dirty.\n\nAMC was the best AMC show because they were the most consistent and socially relevant with their stories about family. You never turned on AMC and had to wonder what show you were watching. They cast some of the most beautiful people too. They had so many iconic storylines: Greg and Jenny; Nina and Cliff, Tad/Marion/Liza; Erica and everybody! LOL They also had the first gay character on an American soap opera (Lynne Carson). On April 22, 2003, the first lesbian kiss on daytime television occurred between Bianca Montgomery and Lena Kundera on AMC. Michael Delaney was a gay teacher who came out to his students and then got fired.\n\nAll of these shows dropped the ball on diversity, but AMC had the most interesting ongoing Black couple - Angie and Jessie. They went from Phoebe's maid (Mrs. Valentine) to a Black super couple. They also had many other memorable Black and Latino characters to include the entire Santos family.\n\nAMC certainly had its Golden Age but the last several years were all about Greenlee coming and going and going and coming and every time she came back, all that transpired while she was gone was done away with -- forgotten\n\nNone of the new young people stood out except maybe Damon, played by Finn Wittrock but he got out before long.\n\nThey kept writing Erica as a perpetual 35 year old.\n\nI heard that Cady complained about some storylines; Megan called up Frons, furious, saying she wanted to kill her off; Frons let her. I could never look at pancakes again.\n\nAMC lost its way long before it got canceled.\n\nThose 'the real Greenlee' promos were insulting. The real Greenlee was back to do scenes with the fake Kendall, I guess.\n\nR400 I think what Agnes was going for with Christina was a heroine who was really misunderstood, since she started off as being involved with Dr. David Thornton then being falsely accused of murder. Since Erica was already based off of AW's Rachel, it would have possibly been slightly jarring for Christina to be another version of that type of character, so Christina was probably intended to be Rachel-lite in some aspects however moreso an edgier version of Mary Kennicott (like someone previously stated). Christina was supposed to come off as bad even though she wasn't, so when the Martin's were at the point of accepting her the audience was expected to follow suit, which didn't happen. Robin just always came off as one of those actors who didn't seem quite suited to play a nice character, as if it didn't ring true. She's very talented, however she just didn't have it in her to play good on one show and bad on another as many other actors did. One of the worst things you can be as an actor on a soap is playing a seemingly good character that the audience hates lol. It's usually the ones that everyone loves or loves to hate that last the longest.\n\nI remember someone suggested Erica could have even been pregnant with Tom's baby when she left for CA (Lucci's maternity leave).\n\nAs misguided of an idea that the unabortion was, they did not even mine the potential drama. Instead of creating a bunch of tension between Erica and the Martins and exploring Erica's long up and down history with them, they used Jeff's return as an easy, cheap way to break up Erica and Jack. They did absolutely nothing with Tad killing the person his nephew considered as his father. I think the unabortion (Josh?) realized Tad was responsible for his father's death and they never even had a confrontation or conversation about it. Instead of really digging into Erica and Josh working or not working things out - the tension between them was mainly Josh liked Babe and that is what his focus was. Another sign that Babe (is love) was eating the show. I think Tad burying Madden in a box where he suffered horribly for days before being buried alive and Tad facing no consequences and Dixie's death by pancakes are what caused me to finally stop recording the show.\n\nTo give Buding some credit, I remember her speaking out about how wrong those \"real\" Greenlee promos word and acknowledged the other actress as also being a real Greenlee.\n\nAnyone watch AMC in the 70's? Since it was pre-VCR there is not much of it on YouTube. It seems like a lot of the main characters of the first five years were gone by the end of the decade. Phoebe and Erica were really the main original characters still driving stories in the 80's. Joe, Ruth and Mona were still important to the show, but seemed to be more of supporting characters by that point.\n\nI caught a youtube clip with the replacement Brooke. She was not featured enough to get a good feel for her, but she seemed very bland and generic from the little I saw of her. Again, not enough to make a sound judgment, but from the little I saw of her she seemed to have not much of a spark with either Tom and more importantly Erica.\n\nAs bad as AMC was at the end, I still cannot believe that Bold and the Beautiful is one of the soaps that has managed to stay on the air.\n\nr412 right his name was Josh and yes when Erica went to CA it would've been perfectly logical for her to have been pregnant by Tom and gave the baby up without telling him or getting pregnant in CA, then giving them up. All of your points make sense lol there was absolutely no fallout just plot point after plot point. The way they explained the abortion was even strange, Dr. Greg Madden took Erica's aborted fetus and implanted him in his wife Emily who had miscarried their baby. The show was called out on it not being medically possible in the manner that it supposedly transpired, especially not in 1973 (however they changed his year of birth to 1980 to fit the story, similar to how they changed Kendall's from 1969 to 1976). As for Greenlee, Frons was behind those \"Real Greenlee\" promos after reluctantly agreeing on Sabine Singh being recast as Greenlee a year prior; Rebecca Budig stated that she was \"the original\" and seemed to feel bad for the treatment towards Sabine.\n\nR393 I am not unaware that AMC had its flaws and I will have to take your word about the last years of the AMC since I had abandoned it long before then. I was specifically talking about the Golden Age of AMC. I was comparing apples to apples. I should have been clearer, I was specifically talking about what I consider the prime years of American soaps (the late 1970s to early 1990s) AMC was the best.\n\nI wasn't watching any soaps consistently (except occasionally Y&R) around the time the soaps were getting cut. I never liked Greenlee so I feel your pain where she is concerned. Don't get me started on fake Kendall (HA, I thought I was the only one calling her that). Sarah Michelle Gellar was the perfect conniving bitchy little daughter Erica deserved. Alicia Minshew didn't really fit in that family. I loved Bianca's character and the actress, Eden Riegel is really good and was the perfect combination of Travis and Erica. She also had great chemistry with Susan Lucci.\n\nLike I said, i wasn't watching at the end but if I had to put my finger on the problem it would be losing both Ruth Warrick and Mary Fickett in pretty close proximity without having a replacement for at least one of those pillars was the death knell. They can give Erica a hundred kids but she never was going to be able to fill the matriarch role. She's too self-centered. The name of the show is \"All My Children.\" And to be fair, none of the other older ladies on the show at the time could have filled that function.\n\nBut even with those flaws I would have taken AMC over boring ole OLTL and the outrageous and unrealistic GH which continued to jump the shark.\n\nR402 I do not think that is correct.\n\nNone of us was there, so we only know what people who were there at the time are saying and what we read. From everything I was able to find, both women started on their respective soaps in 1968. But the biggest difference is that Zaida Coles was not a central character. This is supported by the fact that she was only on The Doctors for 2 years. Even today, to be considered a \"central character\" you have to be on the show for several years. Ellen Holly was on OLTL for over 20 years and yes from everything I have seen, Ellen Holley was the first African American to be in a recurring status. I have seen nothing saying that about Zaida Coles.\n\nIn the U.S. soap opera world, recurring status is a term used to describe the status of a performer who consistently performs in less than three episodes out of a five-day work week.\n\nBTW, Ellen Holley's character was created within about a month of OLTL's on air premiere. She started with the cast about 6 months later. Ellen said when she started the show she was appearing on it almost every day.\n\nWhat is funny is that recurring nowadays is a step down because it usually is a demotion from a full time contract with \"regular\" status. I would assume there is something lower than \"recurring\" which is probably what Zaida had.\n\nI don't think Zaida Coles was recurring, even though if she was in 100 episodes in 2 years she probably should have had a recurring contract.\n\nIn the interview below Ellen Holley describes herself at 08:45 as \"The first Black central star in the history of daytime.\" I will take her word for it. That probably means she got the \"best\" contract a Black person could get at the time. It also suggests that the White actors who were also \"central\" characters were on regular (not \"recurring\") status and got better pay which was shitty as fuck.\n\nReading between the lines it appears that both these amazing Black actresses were underpaid.\n\nWhat is fascinating in these clips of Ellen Holly is that not only does she look great for her age, but her mind is still sharp as a tack! She is so lively and makes the interviewer's job easy. She is remembering all this shit from 50 years ago like it was yesterday and she is currently 90 years old! This interview is only from a few years ago when she would have been in her late 80s. I can't remember what I did last week. LOL\n\nAngie also filled the void of having a strong female character that was not a bitch that had been there since they minimized and then eliminated Brooke. I liked Erica, but the show always worked best with another strong female lead to balance her (when I was watching, usually Brooke). At the end, Kendell and Greenlee took up a lot of air time, and when you add Erica into the mix, it was too much of the same. I think they wanted Krystal to fill in the role of the long-suffering heroine, but she was no Brooke.\n\nWhen Greenlee first showed up, I remember thinking they should have made her a Kendell recast. She was written as a young Erica-type and had good chemistry with Lucci, and was a stronger actor and had more of a presence then Alicia would have. Most of the time, you really did not need both Kendell and Greenlee on the show. Kendell would have been the character to keep due to her family ties, but Buding would have been the actress to keep. I also found Greenlee more interesting when working off of Roger and Mary and their dysfunctional dynamics then plot-driven father Jack. Plus Mary and Rodger brought some nice blue blood snobbery that had been missing since Phoebe stopped being prominent. AMC lost a lot of character in the later years.\n\nR448 Kendall and Greenlee were similar in some ways yet sort of different in other ways, if that makes sense, although they were both mini-Erica's. I think they were trying to establish a rivalry between the two before the whole girl-power, Fusion movement which resulted in their friendship. Rebecca didn't like the direction they were going with Greenlee, saying she was becoming too soft, and along with her wanting to live in LA with her then husband Bachelor Bob, it was a no-brainer for her to leave. When she went off on Kendall for impregnating herself with Ryan's baby (even though Kendall's intentions were good) Rebecca & Bob commented how Greenlee got her balls back. When Sabine was cast, Greenlee started to go back to being bitchy, however the writers felt that they wanted to base Greenlee more off of Sabine's personality, so they made her more of a heroine to play to her strengths. What's funny is that Rebecca didn't like when they would soften Greenlee, while Alicia lamented how she didn't like when they would have Kendall revert to her old ways, for she stated how it didn't show any growth and a lack of maturity.\n\n[quote]Kendall and Greenlee were similar in some ways yet sort of different in other ways, if that makes sense, although they were both mini-Erica's. I think they were trying to establish a rivalry between the two before the whole girl-power, Fusion movement which resulted in their friendship.\n\nI would agree with that, they did have differences. I would say Greenlee was probably more like Erica. I thought the two actresses played well off of each other, and both worked well with Lucci. My biggest complaint was that they needed some separation from time to time instead of constantly being in each other's orbit. It did not help that they would do a 180 within about one episodes whether they were best friends or hated rivals. One story would end and they would decide to change the dynamic for the next story and instantly flip the switch on whether they hated or liked each other in a plot-driven rather than more organic, gradual way.\n\nAlicia was not the greatest actress when she got the part, but she got better, and they did do a gradual softening for her using her relationship with Bianca and then did a good job of her gradually getting closer to Erica. They went through a stage where they were civil but not close, had a back step or two but did not revert to the full animosity they had, before they were genuinely close and Kendell called Erica \"mom\".\n\nStill, the last scene with SMG was perfect where they had a mature good bye and SMG left on good terms, but they were not sad to part ways and acknowledged they might well never be close. It was well acted by both, especially with what was going on behind the scenes. It would have been a perfect way to end their relationship, but was also set the stage for them possibly working things out if Kendell ever returned.\n\nR460 Their multiple writing changes in the 2000's is most likely why the dynamic between Greenlee & Kendall would constantly shift. When Charles Pratt came on board, he asked the actors about the history of their characters, which seemed flattering to them, only to pull the rug from under them by saying from that point on, forget history since he was going to reset their characters in his vision. So the constant back and forth between them depended on who was writing at the time. Although Alicia wasn't exactly the best, I agree that she would try and did improve as time went on. She had big shoes to fill from Sarah Michelle and I see how you're being nice by not mentioning the backstage beef between Susan and Sarah Michelle which resulted in SMG's firing (the \"rumor\" is that Susan was so furious over Sarah Michelle's win that she demanded they get rid of her that very next day, so those scenes you were referring to aired on July 3rd, 1995, after being filmed shortly after the Emmy ceremony). Susan for along well with Rebecca and Alicia so it isn't that she was difficult to work with, she just clashed with Sarah Michelle. Susan wasn't too fond of Erica having grown children for awhile; she had also informed the higher ups that they were aging Bianca (who Susan named herself when the writers had trouble naming her) too fast (possibly because she wanted Erica to stay as childlike as long as she could)\n\nRauch's OLTL was VERY 80's and very brightly lit- however the sets were pretty cool and over the top- After watching 86-89 episodes, the show looks good in a very 80's way. And the background music was EVERYTHING.\n\nBy 90-91 the show looked like shit and everyone looked like shit. And the stories were abysmal.\n\nGottlieb was right. And her show looked dramatically different from Rauch's. It did not look or sound like 80's OLTL at all. I despised her background music. It was utterly boring, other than Todd's theme and Viki's alters (that music was awesome)\n\nOLTL was written and produced to evoke a film, and it was nearly on par with Y&R.\n\nAMC always looked and sounded like some hokey sitcom. (I have to go on YouTube though- there was a a good 3 year period- It think it was the late 80s) where the show really did look great.\n\nAMC looked fine in the 1970s and early 1980s. By the mid-1980s through the early 1990s, the show was lit way too brightly and looked like an off-network syndicated sitcom. Yet the audience didn't care, as the show was ranked in the top thee throughout that whole period.\n\nWhatever you say about McTavish she really revived AMC in 2003. She actually had a plan and a series of storylines that wove together most of the cast (except Brooke who was needlessly dumped) that lasted about 2 years. All the writers that followed arrived with seemingly no plans and just started writing with no idea of what was going to happen next. It was incredibly dark - the lesbian heroine is raped, impregnated, and then has her baby stolen - but it was the last time the show had to be watched every day. The characters were also positioned correctly - for that first year Greenlee and Kendall remained anti-heroines, bitches and rivals. Kendall and Erica didn't get a long. And then everyone became best friends and the awful \"We are strong. We are Kane women\" BS. Ryan and Zach became super heroes. Babe and Krystal annoyed everyone to death. Brooke disappeared. The Martins disappeared. Everyone became a successfull businessman.\n\nR474 Correct Reggie was written as a ghetto child \"in the system\" who needed to be \"helped\" (first by Kendall & Leo's brother Trey, then by Jack). That's why original Reggie actor Chadwick Boseman RIP decided to quit after about a weeks worth of shows; he said that ppl he knew thought that he was crazy to turn down a contract on a soap, however he felt that he didn't want to portray that stereotypical type of role, which is where Michael B. Jordan stepped in (so ironic how their paths ended up meeting later in life).\n\nMichael B. Jordan didn't particularly enjoy his time on AMC. Aside from Michael E. Knight, with few others here & there, he didn't feel too welcomed by his castmates. There was an episode of him on The View, where he participated in a fashion show with Cameron Mathison, Eden Riegel & Kassie DePaiva. Cameron & Eden were all hugged up, giggling while completely ignoring him, as if he were someone they never met before. He looked so sad until Kassie went over and hugged him, which cheered him up. I wonder if they tried to contact him once he got big since he doesn't seem to be close with any cast members from his Kane-Montgomery families (he is/was friends with the guy who played Dre, I think the son of Mario Van Peebles' character, although I think Reggie had been written off long before Dre showed up)\n\nI did not think Michael Jordan was necessarily the best actor on AMC, but he did have something of an it factor. They really did not know what to do with him, and other than being adopted by Jack, he never really had a storyline except being a supportive brother. He had good chemistry with Amanda Seyfried's Joannie and it looked like they were going to do a storyline with them and her religious parents, but they never put her on contract and she disappeared. I always thought that was strange, because of the group of teens she was brought in with (a really bad JR, Joannie's sister - maybe a Jamie) she stood out as having potential.\n\nJordan seems to be pretty careful about what he says about AMC in interviews. He seems like he might be embarrassed about it, but have not heard him badmouth it. The one thing I have heard him say is that he learned about work ethic watching Lucci. While they did not treat his character great and he had kind of cringe-worthy white man saves black youth story, I do think they might have toned down the stereotype of the Reggie character a bit from the Boseman version.\n\nAs much of a success as they had with Angie and Jessie, and some success with the Frye's and a couple of big years with Noah (although I thought Noah and Julia were overrated), AMC was pretty lilywhite in the 2000s.\n\nSomeone upthread made a good point - fans are sometimes silly about pitting shows against one another but clearly most of them had something to attract viewers.\n\nI was a big GL/ATWT fan (somewhat AW too) but there were times I loved peeking in on the Nixon shows. GH had its moments during the Labine/Riche era. Y&R was the perfect lunchtime retreat on a swelteringly hot summer day. I never cared for the supercouple gangbang that DAYS became but I totally see why people loved it. Santa Barbara changed too many times to survive but it was a special thing when it was firing on all cylinders.\n\nThe only successful show that completely mystifies me is B&B. Susan Flannery and Darlene Conley were the only human beings I ever saw on that show and Flannery's humanity and gravitas (even as a monstrous bitch) was the only thing that carried it for years. Otherwise, it's been the same characters playing musical chairs for years. There isn't an interesting thing about any of these people beyond who they pretend to fuck, and I can't believe a word any of them say.\n\nR477 I totally agree, Felicia (AW) and Vickie (OLTL) sucked. I hated those characters to and for the same reasons. I never understood why they got so much airtime when there were better (and more realistic) characters they could have highlighted.\n\nThe problem with Adam Newman is the writers did not know what to do with him. They cycled through multiple actors who all had a different presentation of the character. Michael Muhney (racist asshole) was the worst to play Adam and he played him the longest which made his scenes hard to watch. They finally got it right though. Mark Grossman is a great Adam. He has some of the cut throat instinct of his daddy Victor but also you can see the sensitivity of his mother Hope. That is what the character should be. I also think he is the most attractive of the 5 actors who played this still young man.\n\nR493 Virginia was great; the turkey baster pregnancy story is legendary lol. I think the problem was that alot of writers/producers, maybe even networks didn't want to go there with \"Black villains\" so they were always either virtuous doctors, lawyers, etc. I always found it refreshing when they had Black villains since bad comes in all shades.\n\nTypically a villain would only be short-term or quickly redeemed if they happened to be Black, or was just there to play the heavy to cause trouble in a temporary way, such as Vanessa Bell Calloway's Yvonne Caldwell on AMC to Angie/Jesse, or Taye Diggs' Sugar Hill on GL to Dahlia & Kevin Mambo's character (sorry forgot his name; I know he won Emmy's for the character). It's too bad Generations didn't last longer, so that Doreen and Vivian could continue on since they we're leads. I do know that as much flack Frons gets for being an ass, Susan Sussman Morina said that it was idea to make one of the leading families Black, since he felt there wasn't enough of a representation at that time.\n\nR495 Excellent points. I forgot about Amanda Seyfried's Joanie; she was supposed to be the supporting character/confidant of Alexandra Daddario's character however she stood out, and her burgeoning relationship with Reggie was cute. Daytime still tends to stay away from interracial relationships where the guy is Black & the girl is White (except for a few exceptions, however it usually never gets any further than kiss; other than Alexis/Shawn on GH, I can't recall any other love scenes that featured any) so I don't know why they even teased them. IA MBJ wasn't that great as an actor however he was 16 when he started (even though there have been teen actors who've acted circles around adults) and I saw that \"it factor\" in him as well too. Anna Stuart gave some insight to her experience on AMC, saying that she had a better time on AW, for at AMC there were \"too many egos.\" I do recall another story about complaints of MBJ having his \"music too loud\" is his dressing room lol but I chalked that up to him being young.\n\nR569 IA there were traces of Silver in Kendall, down to their resentment of Erica, inserting themselves in her life and ruining her relationship. They also were both definitely mousy before their true intentions were known. I suppose from Susan's standpoint, they were bringing someone on, a relative of Erica's in both instances, to \"best\" her, when she was the lead and used to playing the character who would get the best of others. Since Erica was originally written as the antagonist to Tara, same as Rachel to Alice on AW, they're both from an era where things began to change with the antagonist being the star (ushering in similar leads in the form of male counterparts such as Luke on GH, Victor on Y&R, Sonny on GH, etc.) so she wasn't used to being in that position, especially with women younger than her. However, both Silver and Kendall were welcome additions, for as long as they lasted (to her credit, Susan did inform tptb that either SHE goes, or I go, in regards to Sarah Michelle, so it wasn't just her demanding they fire Sarah Michelle flat out after her Emmy win lol)\n\nSusan's melodramatic performances were panned by critics for years. Those are good examples of her giving toned down, \"less is more\" scenes. One Emmy voter said that one of the main reasons why he could never vote for her is because of her overacting, citing scenes like Mona's funeral where she threw herself on the casket, compared to the scenes where she actually did win, which were from Bianca's anorexia iirc prompting him to actually vote for her, for he said that was the first time he actually saw her give an understated performance.\n\nR575 & R576 would be my defense lawyers if I were ever on trial lol thank you for providing evidence and counter arguments. I didn't know that Sarah Michelle actually told that to Kathy Griffin; that's exactly how I remember hearing about it, except I wasn't aware that Susan got her fired before the Emmy Awards were even over. Wow. That was really coldblooded lol however SMG did have quite the career with her films and Buffy; I just wonder what happened for her career was really taking off and then all of a sudden (especially after Buffy) she was barely in anything anymore.\n\nI can definitely see their friendship with her being more political than with Sarah Michelle. I remember how Sarah Michelle would actually have girls nights out with them. Same goes for Rebecca, Alicia, and Eden Riegel; Susan is \"close\" with all of them too however she wasn't at any of Rebecca and Alicia's sleepovers lol. I can't even see Susan being with them comfortably in either of those scenarios lol"
