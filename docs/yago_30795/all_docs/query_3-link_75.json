        "text": "Milo Antonio Vega, vice president of Corral-Wodiska Cigar Co., died Sunday (Oct. 6, 1991) after suffering a heart attack while rowing on the Hillsborough River. Mr. Vega also was founder and president of the Tampa Rowing Club. He was 55. \"He was doing what he loved (at the time of his death), and that's what counts,\" said Rene Rodriguez, a family friend who occasionally rowed with Mr. Vega. Rodriguez said Mr. Vega won the Master's World Championship rowing competition last month in Miami.\n\nVance Smith, Mr. Vega's brother-in-law, said it was surprising he would have a heart attack, considering he had just won a major competition and seemed fit. Smith said Mr. Vega was dedicated to his rowing. \"He spent most of his free time training for that sport.\"\n\nBorn in Tampa, Mr. Vega received a bachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania and served briefly in the Air Force after graduation.\n\nAs grandson of Manuel Corral, founder of Corral-Wodiska, Mr. Vega went to work for the company, eventually becoming vice president. The company makes cigars with the Bering label.\n\nDonna Todd, executive director of the Travelers Aid Society, said Mr. Vega served as interim director of that organization after the previous director died in January.\n\nMr. Vega was a member of Christ the King Catholic Church, the Tampa Yacht & Country Club, Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla and the Board of Fellows at the University of Tampa. Smith said that years ago Mr. Vega raced sports cars in amateur events.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Mattie T.; a son, Tison C.; a daughter, Sylvia H. Vega; his mother, Sylvia Corral Vega; and a sister, Sylvia \"Nootchie\" Smith, all of Tampa.\n\nVisitation is 6:30 to 8 p.m. today at B. Marion Reed Chapel, 258 Plant Ave., with a wake beginning at 6:30 p.m. A funeral Mass, celebrated by Monsignor Norman G. Balthazar, will be 10 a.m. Wednesday at Christ the King Catholic Church, 821 S Dale Mabry Highway. Burial will be in Myrtle Hill Cemetery.\n\nThe family requests that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to the National Neurofibromatosis Foundation, Florida Chapter, 2460 Royal Oaks Drive, Tallahassee 32308-2912. Marsicano Funeral Home is in charge of arrangements."
