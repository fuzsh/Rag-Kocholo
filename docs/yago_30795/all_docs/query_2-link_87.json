        "text": "This was posted on facebook by the group True Soap Fans Want AMC and OLTL Back On ABC Daytime, @wewantsoaps\n\nAn ABC insider said that there was a meeting with Karey Burke (New ABC Entertainment President) and other ABC executives to discuss AMC and OLTL coming back, Frank Valentini ( General Hospital Executive Producer) also sat down at the meeting to discuss possible reboots. Nothing is official, but were getting closer of possibly getting our shows back. We do know there are multiple soap stars who want the shows back as well, were not sure who they all are but its a plus that the stars are with us in this fight. There has been all sorts of different talks about possibly rebooting or retooling both soaps with the same characters but different actors playing the roles ( we will call it rumors for now) Many of us would rather they continue off from 2011 instead of off the online versions, while there are a few who have suggested rebooting both shows for the newer generations, which would mean different actors/actresses playing the roles such as a new Erica Kane or new Nora Buchanan, but we don't think that will happen (it wouldn't be the same nor would it work) Like we said its all talks for now, nothing is official of yet. Now we just patiently wait, who knows a few months from now, we could be turning our TVs on at 1 PM (Eastern Time) and watching Erica Kane going after Jackson Montgomery.\n\nI am not vouching for the reliability of the post.\n\nI would never watch with new actors in the classic roles. If the actor has died or can't do it then write out that character. Actually it's only OLTL I would watch again. I stopped watching AMC years before it went off the air and I could never stand SL. I would hope RH would go back to being Todd on OLTL and ES as Viki. That would be heaven. I was never a Blair fan so I could live without KdP coming back. I wasn't that fond of Tea either but I could tolerate her but I think they should hire the actress who once played Rebecca Lewis. I liked Charlie for Viki and Nora and Bo I could take or leave. If any are still alive I'd like to see Larry and his family and please don't let them bring 180 year old Victor Lord for a third or forth time.\n\nThe shows would never make enough money for ABC to consider this. This is a blatant lie. Give it up folks.\n\nAnd IF this ever happened, it would be AMC rebooted or a AMC OLTL mashup that heavily favors AMC- and I think it would be called All My Children.\n\nOLTL got no credit for its good ratings in its last year, beating GH and AMC, and the fact that OLTL's finale numbers were higher than AMC's- when AMC was basically the crown jewel soap of ABC. I thought that said a lot about the \"red headed stepchild\" show.\n\nLoved OLTL, but it's over.\n\n[quote]Is Tuc Watkins gay? I only recently saw it confirmed that Tony Geary is gay.\n\nWow. Welcome out from under that rock you've been hiding under for the past six years.\n\nTuc Watkins officially came out in April 2013 with the launch of the online version of OLTL\n\nAs for Tony Geary, he has never officially come out, never done an interview with the press where he said \"Yep, I'm gay.\"\n\nHe essentially lives in a glass closet, but every now and then, puts on a charade such as claiming that he and Elizabeth Taylor were sleeping together in the early 1980s.\n\nIt will only work for ABC to do a reboot if they can produce AMC and OLTL in the same studio, negotiate contracts way lower, and focus on a younger generation.\n\nProspect Park actually showed them the way to do it, but didn't have the ability to sustain it.\n\nWhether the economics would work is very questionable. And that's probably what they are trying to figure out. Also, after both shows being off the air for almost a decade now (PP reboots aside) local affiliates have filled those slots with cheap local programming. They would be unlikely to give up those time slots.\n\n[quote] Some characters should just be permanently retired such as Dorian, Clint, Gigi, Bo, Blair, David Vickers (sorry Tuc), Victor Lord, Star and Mitch Lawrence. Keep or bring back Vickie if she doesn't look too old, Jess, Natalie, Danni, Carlotta and the Vega Boys (different actors), the younger Buchanan Boys, and Allison from the Cult. And Tina new actress. Actually a lot of the characters should be recast.\n\nClint, Bo and Dorian should be recurring if used at all. Nora, same. Rotate them in if stuff is happening.\n\nBlair is now at DAYS so that may be a moot point. Starr is dead and Victor and Mitch are unlikely to return.\n\nNo one wants Carlotta back, and her sons can stay gone.\n\nViki should have Kevin (Dan Gauthier) return with a new wife and adopted stepson. We find out the wife, instead of being sweet and kind as initially thought, is a money grubbing bitch. Jess or Natalie can catch on to her, or Dani, maybe. Then we have a Dorian vs Viki Next Generation. The stepson becomes close to Viki and becomes one of the family.\n\nTea and Dani are welcome back. Matthew can come back too.\n\nFACT: Robin Strasser is truly a very nice person. How do I know? Met her in February 2012 post-performance (\"Love, Loss, and What I Wore\") outside of The Westside Theatre in sub-zero temperatures and OMG she braved the fierce cold (in a gorgeous, glamorous full-length mahogany mink coat) and greeted every single freezing fan with genuine warmth and unmistakable sincerity. Throughout our conversation, her smile was real, not fake...she encouraged my questions about her craft + career...and then -- right when I started getting ferklempt about it all -- Robin Strasser reached over right away and gave me a big hug. Only a real mensch responds like this to a moment like that.\n\nReally hate that she wears tortured, murdered animals, but I have to say I used to tweet with her and she was very nice and very appreciative of anything nice I said about her acting. We tweeted back and forth for a couple of years. Then again used to tweet a lot and even talk on the phone (via a radio show she had) with Roseanne and she and her boyfriend Johnny were amazing to talk to. She loved Obama back then so she was still somewhat normal and look what happened there so I have no idea what Robin is like these days. At least she's not insane on Twitter and I doubt she's a Trumper.\n\nHated what Malone did with KT. She was a ditz. Not clever or cunning. A soccer mom. I liked Karen Witter as Tina also Malone wrote for her making her more of a misunderstood heroine.\n\nI don’t think ether versions of Malone’s Tina’s were accurate. AE was a vixen! A very Marilyn Monroe lovable badgirl who used her sexuality and played dumb to be underestimated. Cunning always looking to get ahead but made bad choices. A lot of times she showed her heart but was selfish!\n\nR330 Blair isn't the Mona type, either. Addie, yes, but not Blair. I'm guessing they just mean putting a mother/daughter relationship at the center of the show. Or, they could focus on Starr and her Aunt Vikki, they had the sort of Erica/Mona relationship. Maybe Blair, Todd and Dorian are no longer in Llanview, so Starr has to rely on her Aunt Vikki for support. Starr really should have been much more of a Tina like character. I could see her having gone a little wild after the deaths of her baby and boyfriend. However, when she left Port Charles it was implied that Cole and Hope were actually alive, so I don't know.\n\nHow about instead of trying to do an Erica/Mona redux, they go further back in soap history and do a Love of Life style show focusing on two sisters, Starr and Danielle. Since Starr had become the \"good\" heroine, she could be the Vanessa Dale and Danielle could be the bad Meg Dale style sister.\n\nHonestly, I could see some sort of OLTL and AMC coming to Hulu, now that Disney has complete control of it. I could see them doing the two thirty minute episodes a week schedule that Prospect Park was using at the end. Having new content that will appear year round, on a set schedule, is a plus for a streaming service as it drives viewers to keep coming back and discovering other content.\n\nThey just need to keep the casts small and budget wise it should be fine. I would have no more than a dozen regular characters, with a focus on younger legacy characters, with a few veteran names, like Vikki on OLTL, or Erica on AMC, but the older veteran characters should only be played by the original actors. They can always bring other actors and characters back for short term guest roles. As long as they respect each show's history, while making it completely accessible to new viewers, it could work. They just need to make sure that they have fresh writing.\n\nR360 If WWTBAM is Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, it would not have anything to do with a reboot, because it is a syndicated program, though produced by ABC/Disney, it is the same as Live with Kelly and Ryan. It doesn't even air on my ABC affiliate, it is on the CW affiliate. The only shows that are on ABC Daytime right now is The View, Strahan and Sara, and GH.\n\nI have no interest in seeing a half-assed twice a week OLTL with nothing but young characters. When I was a teen I hated stories for young characters on the soaps. I was interested in long term adult characters and I still am. I'm also not interested in twice a week. Four days a week is the least I'd be interested in. Don't forget Hulu isn't free like PP online was. If I have to pay for it it better damn be what I want to see.\n\nR363 Everyone, I knew watched the PP shows, on hulu or itunes. When, I said younger characters I didn't mean teens, per se, but characters in their 20s and 30s. Most of the long running characters, such as Vikki on OLTL and Erica on AMC, started out as teens, before growing into the characters they became.\n\nOut of the PP shows I really enjoyed AMC, because they seemed to get the age balance right for storylines, better than OLTL did. Twice a week would be ideal, at least at the beginning, because you need to attract a generation or more of viewers who are not in the habit of watching everyday. If you really love these shows, you'd be happy to get even one episode a week, because one episode of a half-assed OLTL is better than no OLTL.\n\nR381 That was one storyline I hated, even though I actually liked both characters. They should have just had Nigel come out, he seemed so obviously gay and it was clear he was in love with Asa, and that is why he put up with all his crap. Asa kept getting married to all these people, but the only ones that truly loved him was Nigel and Renee.\n\nMe too and together, Viki/Dorian scenes, they were magic you just don't see these days. I also loved both characters in scenes with Todd, especially ES and RH, but RS was great with him too. RH's Todd was wasted with Blair and Tea. They should have just kept him in stories with these powerhouse actresses and forgotten about trying to make him a love interest to anyone. Believe it or not I also like RH in scenes with Kale Brown. So much better than Sam and Nora or the totally horrid Sam and Blair. Actually I really only liked Blair in scenes with the Cramer \"girls.\"\n\nBlair was written somewhat as a submissive punching bag to anyone she gave a little what for to and it wasn't like whoever it was didn't have it coming. I always wanted Blair to be a bona fide BOW (bitch on wheels) because that's what I thought we were getting when KdP was put into the role i.e., playing the new hire's strenghs. It would've been grand to let her have the upper hand more often than not a la Nellie Oleson re: TnT, Asa, Skye, etc. The Cramer women tagline mantra got old too. Kelly should've been bitchier too. Sweet, but prone to flying off the handle unexpectedly. Ya know? Like just a quirk.\n\nGREAT clip R411. One thing I can say about Gottlieb was that she made OLTL a very good looking/classy show.\n\nABC must have saved millions a year on the electric bill alone. Rauch's bright lighting sucked up half the wattage in NYC.\n\nBut overall after much review- it was generally a giant snooze fest, minus 3-4 excellent stories.\n\nTHAT was a great scene.\n\nThat summer of 1988 gave me LIFE chiles!!!!\n\nThis little gay boy found great comfort in Delilah, Bo, and Didi-\n\nThat summer was OLTL at its zenith. I cried like a metal case when Didi died.\n\nI had never really watched a soap for 3 months straight, and I never expected her to die.\n\nIt was a first, to feel that way about someone!\n\nI know, Mary!!!! But how I adored that show.\n\nHow...how much more do you want, Mr. Callison?\n\nHaven't I said what everyone wants to hear? What you want everyone to hear?\n\nThat I am a common hooker like Katrina Karr? That Marco Dane was my pimp! Is that what you want me to say? What do you want from me? You want blood? You want me to say that I'm lower than the lowest piece of scum? You want more filth? You want more slime? You want more names? I'll give you another name -- Talbot Huddleston! He was my first john! He was the first in a string of so many men, I don't even remember their names!\n\nNow? NOW ARE YOU SATISFIED?????"
