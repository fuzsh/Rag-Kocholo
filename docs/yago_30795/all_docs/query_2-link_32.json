Displays the people the path traverses and their relationships.\n\nExplore Tree: Displays the immediate family of Person 1. Click on other people to display their immediate family.\n\nNote: I do not have everyone in Hanszen in the network. If you want someone to be added, fill out the website feedback form with the person to be added and a list of everyone (that you know of) in their O-Week Group. Also email if something you see is incorrect, or if you have any other suggestions. Thanks for helping expand the network!"
