She of course played Kerri Reynolds from 1999–2002.\n\nMeanwhile, Kamar took on the role of Antonio Vega from 1995–2009. So, their time on the soap opera would have overlapped, and the set is where the couple presumably met and fell in love.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nNot too much is known about them, other than that they said \"I do\" in 2007 and lived in Los Angeles. Kamar and Sherri share two sons (more about them in a moment).\n\nMeanwhile, Sherri's Instagram mostly focuses on her career, but once in a while, she shares photos of her family, including a post that praised her husband for his most important role as a dad.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nKamar de los Reyes had three kids, including twin sons.\n\nThe beloved actor is not only survived by his wife, but by their two young children: 9-year-old twins Michael and John.\n\nHe also had an older son, Caylen, age 26, from a previous relationship.\n\nFans stepped up to support the mom and her children in light of their very sad loss, with one person commenting on Sherri's most recent Instagram post, \"We love you, sending love and prayers to you and your kids.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nKamar de los Reyes also left behind a substantial net worth.\n\nAs fans mourn the loss of the soap and video game star, and send their thoughts and prayers to his wife and kids, some also can't help but wonder what kind of net worth Kamar may have amassed over the course of his memorable career.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, Kamar counted $3 million as his fortune before his truly tragic death at a very young age. He had been a working actor for decades before he went from the small to the big screen and starred in movies like Nixon and Salt.\n\nThe last project he completed was in 2023 on the show All American, playing Coach Montes.\n\nThe good news is that Sherri is rumored to also be rather well off, having earned a net worth of as much as $6 million herself at the time of writing.\n\nShe is a working actor who also notably starred on the show The Fosters, and Locke & Key, as well as the miniseries Mrs. Davis."
