A representative for de Los Reyes also confirmed the news.\n\nThe actor grew up in Las Vegas and was born in Puerto Rico. He enjoyed several theater roles early in his career and appeared in movies like \"Nixon,\" \"Salt\" and \"The Cell,\" but his career flourished in television.\n\nHe more recently recurred on FOX's \"Sleepy Hollow,\" ABC's \"The Rookie\" and the CW's \"All American.\" He was filming \"All American\" and had roles in upcoming projects like Hulu's \"Washington Black\" and Marvel's \"Daredevil\" series.\n\nDe Los Reyes is survived by Saum as well as sons Caylen, 26, and twins Michael and John, 9."
