        "text": "Well what can I really say except thank you with all heart and soul to one of the most brave and selfless serving soldiers I have ever met. My name is SPC. Parker James Hoogesteger and I was SGT. Yelners Gunner on the day we were hit by an IED that sadly ended his short lived life. I did not really know him that well personally but on that satin that brief little time I chatted with him up until the tragedy I felt I knew my whole life. I often carry a tramendous amount of guilt and blame and pain for his family and friends because I was schedualed to drive on that day, he saved my life by sacrificing his for mine and lord knows I've carried it almost as a burdon of guilt and shame he is gone. I've never really had the opportunity to express this to anybody and I do want his friends and loved what a special son and loved one they truly were blessed with. I was scheduald on the roster to drive that day but do to lack of experience on the gun as yelner had with driving he had the roster switched so i would be on the gun and he wanted to drive. He and I were planning a mid tour Euro Trip leave together where he and I would tour Europe together for the first two weeks of leave and then part ways to spend the last two weeks with our friends and family back in the states, we were planning this all out dicussing in detail during what we thought would be a fast trip back to the saftey of FOB Kutchbach in Tag Ab Valley when the tragedy suddenly ended his life wounding myself and two other in the vehicle. I've been living and hiding the guilt and pain ever since and have never spoken of it until now and want all his loved ones and those close to him to know that he lives in my heart and that I may not really have lived my life as thankfully and carefully as I should have but I am eternally greatful of his sacrifice and are very much thankful to be here and alive today because of his sacrifice. Yelner is a true hero, a true lord, and a true savior and I thank him and his family for their sacrifice and are forever in their debt. I love all my brothers and sisters in arms and after my rock bottom tumble I would have never been able to recover back the Hoogy I was when I served along side them. Because of all the mental stress of combat I had a bit a mental fallout for a while and I apologize to friends and loved ones I scared over that ordeal but I am striving hard to bring back the Hoogy everybody knew me as, and finally speaking out about all this lifts a lot of the pain off my heart and soul. In the short time I knew him Yelner became more than just a friend or a hero on that day, I want all his loved ones mother and father to know he became my savior, and I truly am forever greatful. Amen. Rest In Piece my brother Jonathan Yelner and I am forever greatful of your sacrifice. SPC Parker James Hoogesteger"
