        "text": "Raised in the backstage wings of Las Vegas hotels by his Cuban father, Puerto Rico-born Kamar de los Reyes knew the second he was hoisted onto the stage to dance with Lola Falana at the age of 8, that he not only wanted to perform, but he wanted to be out front.\n\nKamar's father, a Cuban drummer and percussionist, would see two of his three sons follow in his footsteps: one a world-renowned drummer, the other a world-renowned percussionist. Kamar, the youngest of the brood, chose to go another route. While in high school, he discovered the arts as a singer and dancer. During his senior year, a stage role as El Gallo in \"The Fantastiks\" marked his acting debut. Shortly thereafter, Kamar would go to Los Angeles, to visit his brother Daniel, who was playing percussion for the Cher video \"We All Sleep Alone.\" Kamar landed a dancing role and subsequently went on to work with Kenny Ortega in the feature film Salsa (1988) and the television series Dirty Dancing (1988). Later in 2001, Kamar would work again with Ortega in the VH-1 movie The Way She Moves (2001). Only this time, he would work as the lead actor.\n\nIn 1989, Kamar began to focus only on his acting career; \"I was baptized by fire,\" he likes to say. With very little professional experience as an actor, he landed a role in the critically acclaimed Off Broadway play \"Blade to the Heat\" and rose to critical attention for his portrayal of gay Irish-Mexican boxer Pedro Quinn. The rest, I guess you can say, is history.\n\nKamar has steadily performed alongside a virtual Who's Who in television, movies, stage, and music for more two decades, including projects such as The Gifted (2017)), Sleepy Hollow (2013), Liebe, Lüge, Leidenschaft (1968), Shooter (2016), and Blue Bloods: Crime Scene New York (2010), to name just a few. He would star in the made-for-television movie The Way She Moves (2001); in Nixon - Der Untergang eines Präsidenten (1995), directed by Oliver Stone; and in the feature film Salt (2010), starring Angelina Jolie. You might also recognize him as the face and voice of Raul Menendez in the most successful video game franchise in history, Call of Duty: Black Ops II (2012), Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 (2018), and Call of Duty: Vanguard (2021).\n\nJoining forces with his actor wife Sherri Saum, they created MaPá Productions and recently starred in and produced their first short film, First Strike Butcher Knife (2017), which premiered at the Los Angeles Short Film Festival to critical acclaim.\n\nAn avid gym rat and self-professed weekend warrior, Kamar resides in Los Angeles with his wife and twin sons, Michael Luis and John Rubén. Kamar is also very active in helping with the recovery efforts of his beloved island Puerto Rico. To date, Kamar and his brother Daniel de los Reyes, along with Day Glow Relief, have made five trips to the hurricane-ravaged island. \"We want to make sure that the relief aid makes it into the hands of the people who need it most, but also create awareness so that the people of Puerto Rico aren't forgotten,\" he has said"
