        "text": "“One Life to Live” star Amanda Davies, who played the teenage version of her real-life mother Erika Slezak‘s character, Victoria “Viki” Lord, on the long-running ABC soap opera has died. She was 42.\n\nSlezak, 77, confirmed the news of her daughter’s passing on the homepage of her official website.\n\n“It is with great sadness that I share the news of the passing of Erika’s daughter Amanda Elizabeth Davies, who died very suddenly,” a message posted Monday read. “The family is heartbroken and would appreciate privacy at this time.”\n\nAt this time, no cause of death has been revealed.\n\nThe Post has reached out to reps for Davies and Slezak for comment.\n\nDavies was born in 1981 to Slezak and husband Brian Davies, an actor known for his roles in “American Gigolo” (1980), “Convoy” (1978) and “The Age of Innocence” (1993).\n\nSlezak played Viki for a decade on “One Life To Live” from 1971 through the television finale in 2012. Davies played Viki in a series of flashbacks in 2002 and in 2013, when the series was briefly revived as a web series.\n\nSlezak won a record-breaking six Daytime Emmy Awards during her four decades in the role of Viki.\n\nThis is the second death to hit the “One Life To Live” family in less than two months.\n\nPuerto Rican actor Kamar de los Reyes, who played cop Antonio Vega, died at the age of 56 on Christmas Eve after a brief battle with cancer.\n\nDavies is survived by her mother, father, who is 85, and brother Michael, who is 43."
