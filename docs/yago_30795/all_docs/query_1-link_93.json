        "text": "The world of daytime lost another beloved star on Christmas Eve. Kamar de los Reyes, who portrayed Antonio Vega on the now-defunct soap One Life to Live, died at 56.\n\nHe passed away on December 24th after a short battle with cancer. The details of what type of cancer he had and when it was diagnosed were kept private.\n\n‘One Life to Live’ Star Portrayed Antonio Vega\n\nDe los Reyes played Antonio Vega from 1995 to 1998 and returned two years later in 2000. He remained in Llanview until the show went off the air in 2013.\n\nAntonio was a former gang member who had been sentenced to prison for seven years for killing someone. With the help of lawyer Nora Buchanan (Hilary B. Smith), Antonio won the respect of his community and became a lawyer and then a police officer.\n\nPatricia Maucheri, who played Carlotta Vega, Antonio’s mother on the show, had this heartfelt message about the actor:\n\n“Kamar was a gentle soul, a kind and talented man. It was an honor to work alongside him as his Mom for the years we enjoyed. A life too short. My sincere condolences to his wife Sherri and all of his family.”\n\nFlorencia Lozano, who played Antonio’s cousin on the show, said,\n\n“If it weren’t for Kamar, Tea Delgado probably never would have existed. I arrived in Llanview playing Kamar’s character’s cousin. His confidence, ease, and charm immediately made me feel welcome and eager to play. As an actor, he was so much fun to spar with, and as a person, he made me feel right at home and one of the gang at One Life to Live. May he rest in peace. I will miss Kamar’s generous, radiant presence.”\n\nKamar Was a Talented Actor\n\nBree Williamson, who played Kamar’s love interest, Jessica Buchanan, on OLTL, expressed her sadness,\n\n“Kamar was a talented, charismatic, and wonderful man. I’m heartbroken that I will never be able to see him again. He was an incredibly important part of my life during my time at One Life to Live, and I will miss him very much.”\n\nMany fans also recognize Kamar as the voice of the villain, Raul Menendez, in the Call of Duty video game. The character was a terrorist and arms dealer who had a major beef with the US.\n\nSleepy Hollow fans might know de los Reyes from his role as a demon on the supernatural drama Sleepy Hollow. Fans of the show “The Rookie” might know Kamar as Detective Sergeant Ryan Caradine.\n\nKamar also played Coach Montes on the CW series All-American. Nkechi Okoro Carroll, who is the showrunner for the series, had this to say,\n\n“He was such a beloved member of our All-American family. He brought so much love, light, and joy to the set every day, even during his final days. We are so grateful for every moment he spent with us. Our hearts and sincere condolences are with Sheri (Saum, his wife), Caylan, Michael, and John (his children), and the rest of Kamar’s family. Thank you for sharing him so generously with us and the rest of the world. He was truly a gift. One we will cherish forever.”"
