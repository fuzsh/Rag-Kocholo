        "text": "In just heartbreaking news to report this Christmas, Kamar de los Reyes, beloved for his portrayal of Antonio Vega on ABC’s One Life to Live, has died.\n\nAccording to reports from a family spokesperson, Reyes passed away on Christmas Eve after a short bout with cancer. He was 56-years-old.\n\nKamar first appeared on One Life to Live from 1995-1998 as Antonio Vega, a former gang member who went on to become a lawyer and a top cop. Antonio and his brother Cristian Vega played by David Fumero, were often romantic leads in storylines. The actor later returned to the soap for a longer run from 2000 to 2009.\n\nWhile at OLTL, Kamar met Sherri Saum, who at the time was playing Keri Reynolds. The couple tied the knot in 2007. They shared 9-year-old twin sons, John and Michael. The actor also has another son Caylen from a past relationship. Saum went on to her own fame on the series, The Fosters.\n\nDe Los Reyes built up quite a resume of acting credits including as the villain Raul Menendez in Call of Duty: Black Ops video games, plus his recent TV credits that included: recurring roles as Jobe on Fox’s Sleepy Hollow in 2017, a detective on ABC’s The Rookie in 2021, and as a college football coach on the CW’s All American since 2022.\n\nAt the time of his death, Kamar was working on the new season of All American and had recently shot a role in Hulu’s Washington Black with Sterling K. Brown, and has part in Marvel’s upcoming Daredevil series.\n\nThroughout his career, Kamar appeared on: ER, New York Undercover, Touched by an Angel, Early Edition, Law & Order, CSI: Miami, Blue Bloods and Castle plus numerous stage and film productions.\n\nThroughout his OLTL career, Kamar received five ALMA Award nominations and took home the award in 2008 in the Outstanding Performance in a Daytime Drama Series category. In addition, back in 2002, along with Sherri Saum, Kamar received a Daytime Emmy nomination for a special fan award deemed America’s Favorite Couple.\n\nDeLos Reyes is survived by his aforementioned wife, actor Sherri Saum; sons Caylen, Michael and John; his brothers Daniel and Walfredo, Jr; his sisters Lily and Ilde; his mother Matilde and his father Walfredo.\n\nMichael Fairman TV will continue to update you on this developing story as reactions come in from the daytime and television community.\n\nShare your condolences and remembrances for Kamar de los Reyes via the comment section below.\n\nPhil Donahue, a trailblazer in the daytime talk show format, has passed away. The longtime TV talk show host died on Sunday night, August 18th after a long illness his family shared. He was 88-years old.\n\nMarlo Thomas, Donahue’s wife for more than 44 years, along with his sister, children, grandchildren and his beloved golden retriever, Charlies surrounded him as he passed on. The news of his death was confirmed by Today on Monday.\n\nIt was just three months ago in May, that Donahue received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Joe Biden.\n\nPhil’s success truly began when the issue-oriented The Phil Donahue Show was picked up for national syndication in 1969, then was renamed Donahue in 1974. Soon, more than 200 stations carried his show. The talk show continued on until 1996, when the daytime talkshow landscape changed to the Jerry Springer and Sally Jesse Raphael’s of it all. In addition, Oprah Winfrey and her success was taking away his female audience.\n\nDuring his run, segments of Donahue were also broadcast three times a week on NBC’s Today, and he joined the staff as a regular interviewer. He also hosted NBC primetime specials, including the Emmy-winning Donahue and Kids and the five-part Phil Donahue Examines the Human Animal.\n\nLater in 2002-03, Donahue briefly returned to television with a self-titled MSNBC talk show in which he interviewed newsmakers on social and political issues.\n\nIn his career, Phil would win 10 Daytime Emmys for Outstanding Host and 10 for Outstanding Talk Show, and the show would capture 200 Emmys during its run.\n\nWhen Donahue called it quits at the age of 60, Oprah Winfrey presented him with a Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement honor in 1996, and shared, “I want to thank you for opening the door so wide, wide enough for me to walk through. Had there not been a Phil Donahue, I don’t believe there could have been an Oprah.”\n\nAfter receiving his Lifetime Achievement Daytime Emmy, Phil, in turn, shared, “Having to go in there every day and jump out of a cake and make sure you have a nice crisp clean shirt and all that, it was wonderful while it lasted, but I think we chose the right time to walk. I’ve never regretted it.”\n\nThe family requested that donations be made to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital or the Phil Donahue/Notre Dame Scholarship Fund in lieu of flowers.\n\nSurvivors include Donahue’s second wife, Marlo Thomas, whom he married in 1980; and his five children from his first marriage.\n\nShare your remembrances and condolences on the passing of Phil Donahue via the comment section below.\n\nJohn Aprea, best-known to soap fans for his role as Lucas (Luke) Castigliano on Another World, has died at the age of 83.\n\nHis manager confirmed his death, which happened earlier this month on August 7th according to TMZ, and August 5th according to the Hollywood Reporter.

We will all miss him dearly.”\n\nKnots Landing fans will remember Aprea from his turn as bad guy Manny Vasquez. John’s former Knots Landing co-star Paul Carafotes (ex-Harold Dyer) took to his Instagram on learning the news of John’s passing, sharing, “I just heard that my old pal, friend. Actor, father, husband, brother. We had lots of laughs. We met on the set of CBS television show Knots Landing, 1987. Over 40 years ago. Many will miss this man! Rest old friend. I’ll see you on the other side.”\n\nAprea is also known for his work in The Godfather Part II where he played a young Salvatore Tessio in the 1974 film, and on the 80s TV sitcom Full House and its reboot 3o years later, Fuller House in the role of Nick Katsopolis, father of Jesse played by GH alum, John Stamos (ex-Blackie Parrish).\n\nThroughout his career, Aprea appeared in several television shows including: Falcon Crest, The Rookies, The F.B.I., Wonder Woman, Silk Stalkings, The Sopranos, Cold Case, NYPD Blue and CSI to name a few.\n\nJohn is survived by his third wife, Betsy, daughter, Nicole, from a previous marriage to actress Ninon Aprea; and stepchildren Marika and Valentino.\n\nShare your remembrances and condolences for John Aprea via the comment section below.
