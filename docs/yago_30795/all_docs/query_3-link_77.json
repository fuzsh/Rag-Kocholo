        "text": "Kamar de los Reyes, best known for playing Antonia Vega on One Life to Live, has died at the age of 56.\n\nDe los Reyes passed away in Los Angeles on December 24, according to a family spokesperson (via The Hollywood Reporter). His death comes following a brief battle with cancer.\n\nDe los Reyes began his career with roles in the Bobby Rosa 1988 musical Salsa and 1989’s East L.A. Warriors. He then added to his list of film credits with 1989’s Ghetto Blaster and 1990’s Coldfire. His other movie roles came in Da Vinci’s War, Nixon, In Search of a Dream, Love & Suicide, LA Apocalypse, and Amelia 2.0.\n\nHe starred as Antonio Vega, a former gang member who, after time behind bars, became a layer, then a cop, in nearly 300 episodes of One Life to Live, off and on from 1995 to 2009.\n\n“His chapter is closed in my heart. I cut those ties in 2009—I think he came full circle and I think he’s done, I’m certainly done,” De los Reyes told TV Insider in 2018. “I had an amazing time and I will be forever grateful to One Life to Live, Antonio Vega, and, of course, my wonderful fans for the time I spent there.”\n\nHis other TV credits include Four Corners (pictured above) and Sleepy Hollow. His guest spots included ER, New York Undercover, Swift Justice, Promised Land, Total Recall 2070, Touched by an Angel, Early Edition, Law & Order, CSI: Miami, The Mentalist, Blue Bloods, Major Crimes, Castle, MacGyver, SEAL Team, and The Rookie. He joined All American in a recurring role in Season 4 in 2022. Yet-to-be-released appearances include Washington Black, Sterling K. Brown‘s Hulu series, as well as the new Daredevil.\n\nThe actor is also known for voicing Raul Menendez, a villain in four Call of Duty video games."
