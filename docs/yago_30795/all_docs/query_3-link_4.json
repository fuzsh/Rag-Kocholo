        "text": "Puerto Rican actor (1967–2023)\n\nKamar de los Reyes (November 8, 1967 – December 24, 2023) was a Puerto Rican actor. He was best known for his portrayal of Antonio Vega on the ABC soap opera, One Life to Live, and as Raul Menendez, the primary antagonist of the 2012 video game, Call of Duty: Black Ops II.\n\nDe los Reyes also played Jobe, a demon in the fourth season of Sleepy Hollow, and Ryan Caradine on The Rookie.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nDe los Reyes starred as a Chicano boxer named Pedro 'Roadman' Quinn, in 1994's acclaimed theatrical production of Blade to the Heat.[1]\n\nThe most arresting figure, however, is Mr. de los Reyes. More than any words he utters, the actor's haunted eyes, sunken cheeks and shaved head convey the extent of Pedro's torment. In repose, he's almost spectral. In the ring, he's like a short circuit, and his silent scream of triumph is a guaranteed spine-tingler.\n\n— David Richards, theater reviewer for The New York Times[1]\n\nDe los Reyes appeared alongside Patrick Stewart as a \"dashing, if thick-tongued\" Ferdinand in a 1995 production of William Shakespeare's The Tempest.[2] In 1997, de los Reyes was named on People Magazine's \"Fabulous 50\" list.[3] In 2001, he starred in a television film, The Way She Moves, starring Annabeth Gish and fellow soap opera star Daniel Cosgrove. He also starred in the controversial film Love and Suicide and in Toni Braxton's video for her song \"Spanish Guitar\". He has made numerous guest appearances on shows such as Law & Order and CSI: Miami. In 1995, de los Reyes starred with James Woods, Ed Harris and Sir Anthony Hopkins in Oliver Stone's controversial biopic, Nixon, playing convicted Watergate burglar, Eugenio Martínez.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2012, he performed the voice acting and the motion-captured body acting of the main antagonist, Raul Menendez, in the video game titled Call of Duty: Black Ops II.[4] The game's publisher Activision reports an estimated US$1 billion gross in its first fifteen days of availability, which the company states is superior to the seventeen day cinema record held by 2009's Avatar.[5]\n\nIn 2013, he played the role of Los Lordes gang leader, Santana in the two-part season finale of the third season of the CBS police procedural drama Blue Bloods.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2022, he joined the cast of CW’s All American, in the role of Coach Mr. Montez.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban percussionist Walfredo de los Reyes and a Puerto Rican mother, Matilde Pages, Kamar de los Reyes grew up in Las Vegas, Nevada. He is the brother of the percussionist of the band Chicago, Walfredo Reyes Jr., and to former Yanni, and now Zac Brown Band percussionist, Daniel de los Reyes. He married actress Sherri Saum in 2007 and they had twin boys. He had a son from a previous relationship.[6]\n\nDe los Reyes died from cancer in Los Angeles, on December 24, 2023, at the age of 56.[7]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nTelevision Year Title Role Notes 1994 The Corpse Had a Familiar Face Puerto Rican TV movie Valley of the Dolls Ray Ariaz 65 episodes 1995 ER Hernandez Episodes: \"Sleepless in Chicago\",\n\n\"Full Moon, Saturday Night\",\n\n& \"House of Cards\" 1995–2009 One Life to Live Antonio Vega Regular cast member 1996 New York Undercover Luis Episodes: \"Bad Blood\"\n\n& \"Fire Show\" Swift Justice Palo Montega Episode: \"No Holds Barred\" 1998 Four Corners Tomas Alvarez — Blood on Her Hands Gavin Kendrick TV movie 1998–99 Promised Land Leon Flores Episodes: \"Denver: Welcome Home\",\n\n\"Out of Bounds\",\n\n\"The Visitor\",\n\n& \"All in the Family\" 1999 Total Recall 2070 Jack Brant Episodes: \"Paranoid\"\n\n& \"Restitution\" Touched by an Angel Eddie Testaverde Episode: \"Godspeed\" Early Edition Ramon Archiletta Episode: \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" 2000 The 27th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards Himself Television special 2001 The 28th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards Himself Television special The Way She Moves Nicholas TV movie 2002 The 29th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards Himself Television special 2003 Undefeated Jose Beveagua HBO TV movie 2004 The 31st Annual Daytime Emmy Awards Himself Television special SOAPnet Reveals ABC Soap Secrets Himself TV movie documentary 2005 The 32nd Annual Daytime Emmy Awards Himself Television special\n\nPresenter for Outstanding Young Actor in a Drama Series Law & Order Aberto Moretti Episode: \"Dining Out\" 2006 Wheel of Fortune Himself – Celebrity Contestant Episode: \"Soap Stars 1\" The 33rd Annual Daytime Emmy Awards Himself Television special The 2nd Annual Quill Awards Himself Television special SoapTalk Himself Episodes: dated March 6, 2006\n\n& October 17, 2006 2007 6ABC Boscov's Thanksgiving Day Parade Himself TV movie 2008 Paula's Party Himself Episode: dated January 18, 2008 2009 CSI: Miami Jason Molina Episode: \"Collateral Damage\" Law & Order: Criminal Intent Teru Episodes: \"The Glory That Was...\"\n\n& \"Alpha Dog\" 2011 The Mentalist Omar Vega Episode: \"Pink Tops\" Reed Between the Lines Anthony Guillory Episodes: \"Let's Talk About Change\",\n\n\"Let's Talk About Ms. Helen's Son, Part 2\",\n\n& \"Let's Talk About Game Night\" 2013 Blue Bloods Santana Episodes: \"The Bitter End\"\n\n& \"This Way Out\" Pretty Little Liars Dominic Russo Episode: \"Into the Deep\" 2014 Major Crimes Dr. Enrique Cabrera Episode: \"Frozen Assets\" 2015 Castle Manuel Villalobos Episode: \"Private Eye Caramba!\" 2016 Kingdom Detective Poole Episode: \"Take Pills\" Shooter — Episode: \"Recon by Fire\" 2017 Sleepy Hollow Jobe 13 episodes Home and Family Himself Episode: \"Carla Jimenez/Kamar de los Reyes/Shirley Chung/King\" 2018 MacGyver Captain Delarosa Episode: \"Wind + Water\" The Gifted Sebastian Diaz Episode: \"coMplications\" SEAL Team Comandante Salas, Priest Episodes: \"Prisoner's Dilemma\" and \"Santa Muerte\" 2019 The Passage Julio Martinez Episode: \"You Are Like the Sun\",\n\n\"You Are Not That Girl Anymore\",\n\n& \"Stay in the Light\" 2021 The Rookie Ryan Caradine 5 episodes 2022–2023 All American Coach Montes 8 episodes 2025 Daredevil: Born Again Hector Ayala / White Tiger Posthumous release; post-production\n\nFilm Year Film Role Notes 1988 Salsa Featured Dancer credited as Kamar Reyes 1989 Ghetto Blaster Chato — East L.A.
