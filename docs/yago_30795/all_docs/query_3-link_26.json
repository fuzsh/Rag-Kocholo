        "text": "Kamar de los Reyes, who made fans of One Life To Live swoon over his rendition of lawman Antonio Vega, has died. The actor had a prolific career after leaving the soap in 2009. He passed away at the age of 56.\n\nRemembering Kamar de los Reyes\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter broke the news that the actor died on Christmas Eve in Los Angeles after a short battle with cancer, per a family spokesperson.\n\n“We are absolutely devastated at the loss of Kamar,” Nkechi Okoro Carroll, showrunner, All-American, the CW series on which de los Reyes plays Coach Montes, told Deadline. “He was such a beloved member of our All American family. He brought so much love, light and joy to the set every day, even during his final days. We are so grateful for every moment he spent with us. Our hearts and sincere condolences are with Sherri [Saum, his wife], Caylen, Michael, John [his children] and the rest of Kamar’s family. Thank you for sharing him so generously with us and with the rest of the world. He truly was a gift. One we will cherish forever.”\n\nBorn Luis Ruben De Los Reyes on November 8, 1967, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Cuban percussionist Walfredo de los Reyes and Matilde, his Puerto Rican mother. He was raised in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he was exposed to the entertainment world because of his father’s line of work. It was said that at age 8, he was brought on stage to dance with nightclub entertainer Lola Falana, (ex-Charity, Capitol) and it was at that moment that he knew this was the life for him. His two brothers followed in their father’s footsteps but Kamar chose another route.\n\nDuring his senior year of high school, he made his acting debut playing El Gallo in The Fantastiks. A trip to Los Angeles to visit his brother, who played percussion on a Cher video, “We All Sleep Alone,” opened the door for him. He met choreographer Kenny Ortega, whom he would work with in the film Salsa in 1988, as well as the TV series, Dirty Dancing. In 2001, he worked with Ortega again in the VH-1 movie, The Way She Moves — this time in the lead role.\n\nThe year 1989 was a pivotal one for his acting career as he landed the role of gay Irish-Mexican boxer Pedro Quinn in the Off Broadway play Blade to the Heat.\n\nBut it was in 1995 that he would set the daytime world on fire when he joined One Life to Live. His portrayal of Antonio, a man who was imprisoned for something that was self-defense but would turn his life around and become a lawyer and a cop — won hearts all over for his moving and mesmerizing work. He was a contract player on OLTL from 1995 to 1997. He recurred on the show in 1998; in 2000, he returned to the show full-time and remained on it until 2009.\n\nIn addition to OLTL, he was well known as the villain Raul Menendez in Call of Duty video games, played Ray in 1994’s Valley of the Dolls, recurring roles in ER, New York Undercover, Four Corners, Promised Land, Total Recall 2070, Blue Bloods, Sleepy Hollow, The Passage, MacGyver, and The Rookie. He acted in countless TV guest shots, as well.\n\nHe also appeared on the big screen in the films Oliver Stone’s Nixon as a Watergate burglar, Tomas in Love & Suicide, The Cell, Mambo Café, Cayo, and Salt.\n\nDe los Reyes is set to appear posthumously in Sterling K. Brown’s (This Is Us) Hulu drama Washington Black and he also has a role the Marvel series Daredevil: Born Again, which will stream on Disney+.\n\n“I am gutted by this loss,” shared Lilly Melgar (ex-Lilly, General Hospital) on Instagram. “Life is so f’in fragile!! Kamar was one of a kind. Such a special soul. I was in awe of his growth. His depth. His talent. We got to work together later in life as I directed him with VO work and he was still the same passionate force of nature w/that vitality of “life” he always emanated.\n\n“On a personal level, I am deeply saddened to lose you my friend,” Melgar continued. “May you rest in peace & paradise. Thank you for being there for me when I needed support & guidance. You were so good to me. So kind and generous. I’ll carry that with me forever. So proud of the man you evolved into being. My deepest condolences to his beautiful family. We lost you way too soon.”\n\nThe actor is survived by his wife and former OLTL leading leady Sherri Shaum (ex-Keri; ex-Vanessa, Sunset Beach; The Fosters) whom he wed in 2007; sons Caylen, 26, and twins Michael and John, 9; siblings Daniel, Walfredo, Jr., Lily; and Ilde, his mother Matilde and his father Walfredo.\n\nSoap Hub sends our sincere condolences to his wife, children, family, friends, and fans during this difficult time."
