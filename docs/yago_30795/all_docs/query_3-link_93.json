        "text": "Although Carlotta Vega has lived in Angel's Square for many, many years, it wasn't until 1995 when she appeared on the scene in Llanview. Having lost her husband, and with her oldest son, Antonio, in jail for killing a man in self-defense, Carlotta was forced to raise her second son, Cristian, by herself in an area of town that is notorious for gangs.\n\nWorking as a maid for Dorian Lord, Carlotta's dream was to once again run the Angel Square Diner that she and her late husband took over. It was Antonio who made her dream come true after he bought back the diner and turned it over to his mother.\n\nAlthough love didn't come easy for Carlotta throughout the years, she did allow a few men into her heart. She had genuine feelings for Clint Buchanan, but knew it could never work because of their conflicting backgrounds. From there on, Carlotta decided to play it safe and had a steamy, no strings attached, affair with DA Hank Gannon, which also ran its course over a period of time.\n\nYears went by and Carlotta shocked her family when she admitted that Antonio wasn't her biological son, rather the son of her mobster brother Manuel Santi who would've destroyed Antonio's life with his dark crimes.\n\nIn 2008, the diner burnt down and devastated Carlotta, but Charlie Banks came to the rescue and turned it in to a replica of the Bonjour Cafe, which quickly grew on her!\n\nCarlotta's motherly qualities managed to hold her family together through the hard times and continue to remain strong. A loving mother and grandmother, her family and her faith are nearest to Carlotta's heart."
