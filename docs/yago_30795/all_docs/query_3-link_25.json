        "text": "Kamar de los Reyes, an actor best known for playing the police officer Antonio Vega on the soap opera “One Life to Live” and for voicing the villain Raul Menendez in the video game franchise “Call of Duty,” died on Sunday in Los Angeles. He was 56.\n\nThe cause was cancer, said Lisa Goldberg, the publicist for his wife, the actress Sherri Saum.\n\nMs. Saum was also on “One Life to Live” before the two actors married. Her character, Keri Reynolds, and his were romantically involved.\n\nMr. de los Reyes’s character on the soap opera, a gangster-turned-police officer, was his longest-running and perhaps most widely known role; he appeared in nearly 300 episodes of the show, from 1995 to 1998 and again from 2000 to 2009 (Ms. Saum was on the show from 2001 to 2003). After his character was released from his prison sentence for murder charges when it was revealed that he was acting in self-defense, he became a police officer and had a series of romantic entanglements.\n\nMr. de los Reyes was born in San Juan, P.R., on Nov. 8, 1967, to a Cuban father, Walfredo de los Reyes, and a Puerto Rican mother, Matilde Pages. He described himself as coming “from a family of musicians”: His two brothers and his father were acclaimed percussionists, and his grandfather was a famous trumpeter.\n\nMr. de los Reyes was raised in Las Vegas and, after high school, moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting. But his first big break was in New York, where he took on the role of Pedro Quinn in the Off Broadway play “Blade to the Heat,” a performance that the New York Times theater critic David Richards described in 1994 as the show’s “most arresting.”\n\n“More than any words he utters, the actor’s haunted eyes, sunken cheeks and shaved head convey the extent of Pedro’s torment,” Mr. Richards wrote. “In repose, he’s almost spectral. In the ring, he’s like a short circuit, and his silent scream of triumph is a guaranteed spine-tingler.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
