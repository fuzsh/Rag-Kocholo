In the Wilderness of the far North, in a place called the Klondike, there lived an animal who became a legend. They call him White Fang. Part wolf and part husky, White Fang ran with the wind. Nothing could stop him for he was wild and free.

Then thousands of people came seeking their fortunes at the expense of the land. Only one little girl earned White Fang’s love and respect, and they became true friends.

Life in this majestic wilderness was forever changed. White Fang’s world would never be the same. But he and Wendy met the challenges of this new land. And together they lived the legend - The Legend of White Fang.
