        "text": "If you'd like to see the movie of the much-adored book then do not waste your money on this one. The Walt Disney version is well worth investing in. This obviously had a very cheap budget. The animation is poor, voice actors bad and the singing is almost painful.\n\nThe backgrounds were very skillful and detailed but were destroyed by the badly drawn characters. The movie sticks to the plot but has simplified it for children. I purchased it for a small price and since I'm a great fan of dogs and wolves anyway, I've decided to keep it. But I'm now commenting to warn you of it. It's not as the cover describes.\n\nThe songs are of poor quality. I must say, the worst was probably Beauty Smith's. The ending is satisfactory but does not end as the book does which was disappointing. Although Disney's White Fang does differ from the book it is much better quality than this one by far."
