As he grows up, White Fang must walk the line between his wolfish nature and his domestic circumstances. He works as a sled dog, then as a fighter, before he is rescued by a kind man who teaches him to trust. Ultimately, White Fang must journey far to discover where he belongs. With foil on the cover and fresh full-color art from Liza Tretyakova, this adaptation of Jack London's White Fang promises to be an exciting first chapter book.
