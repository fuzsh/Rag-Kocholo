        "text": "The hardest question when reading the classics is where to start. The Classic Starts series takes classics loved by children through the ages and makes them approachable and easy to read independently. Each novel is expertly abridged to around 160 pages, making them suitable for young readers, without losing the charm and excitement that made the original story so popular.\n\nThe language and selection of stories in the Classic Starts books are pitched at children 7+. You'll find something to love whether you want to introduce your children to some of your own favourite childhood books, like White Fang, Black Beauty or The Secret Garden, broaden their horizons with literary masterpieces such as The Three Musketeers or The Time Machine, or simply give them a rip-roaring adventure like Treasure Island or The Story of King Arthur. What all the books have in common is that they are stories that will appeal to children, thanks to their exciting plots and memorable characters.\n\nEnjoy all the excitement of the original story without getting stuck on the language. These books are sure to inspire an appreciation of great literature, making sure that children see the classics for what they are – fantastic stories.\n\nThere are many benefits to reading the classics early: learning about history, widening your vocabulary, but mostly you should read them for the sheer pleasure – these books are still being read hundreds of years after their initial publication simply because they are brilliant stories.\n\nWe would say that the Classic Starts reading level is around Year 3 and over, aged 7+, although some younger readers will also be able to enjoy these stories as the language has been simplified. Start with children’s classic like Tom Sawyer or A Little Princess and then young enthusiasts may progress to more challenging reads like The Odyssey or Moby Dick\n\nYou shouldn’t have to wait to read the best stories in literature!\n\nAll the Classic Starts books in order:\n\nBook 1: The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (2005)\n\nBook 2: Anne of Green Gables (2005)\n\nBook 3: The Call of the Wild (2005)\n\nBook 5: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes: Retold from the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Original (2005)\n\nBook 6: A Little Princess (2005)\n\nBook 7: The Adventures of Robin Hood: Retold from the Howard Pyle Original (2005)\n\nBook 8: Gulliver's Travels: Retold from the Jonathan Swift Original (2006)\n\nBook 9: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: Retold from the Mark Twain Original (2006)\n\nBook 10: Oliver Twist: Retold from the Charles Dickens Original (2006)\n\nBook 11: The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde: Retold from the Robert Louis Stevenson Original (2006)\n\nBook 12: Frankenstein: Retold from the Daniel Defoe Original (2006)\n\nBook 13: Robinson Crusoe: Retold from the Daniel Defoe Original (2006)\n\nBook 14: White Fang (2006)\n\nBook 15: The Story of King Arthur & His Knights: Retold from the Howard Pyle Original (2006)\n\nBook 16: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea: Retold from the Jules Verne Original (2006)\n\nBook 17: The Red Badge of Courage (2006)\n\nBook 18: The War of the Worlds (2007)\n\nBook 19: The Prince and the Pauper (2005)\n\nBook 20: The Three Musketeers: Retold from the Alexandre Dumas Original (2005)\n\nBook 21: Heidi: Retold from the Johanna Spyri Original (2005)\n\nBook 22: The Swiss Family Robinson: Retold from the Johann David Wyss Original (2007)\n\nBook 23: Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (2007)\n\nBook 24: Pollyanna: Retold from the Eleanor H.
