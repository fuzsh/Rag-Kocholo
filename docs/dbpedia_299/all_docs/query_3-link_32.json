        "text": "The Dogs of Babel\n\nBy Carolyn Parkhurst,\n\nFrom my list on wild and weird books on dogs.\n\nBy Neal W. Fandek Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’m the author of the Peter Pike private eye series. Pike is a beat-up Middle Eastern veteran-turned private eye who finds himself embroiled in mysteries, usually with lost treasure involved: in the huge, sophisticated Indian civilizations that were here before us; in Lincoln’s murky sexuality; in a lost Faberge egg and the downfall of the Romanovs; and with Peter Pike and the Silver Shepherd, some rather nasty (and one nice) Nazi war dogs.\n\nNeal's book list on wild and weird books on dogs\n\nWhy did Neal love this book?\n\nYou want heartwarming books about man’s best friend? You’ve come to the wrong place. Novels with dogs don’t have to be heart-warming. They can be quite strange, sinister or both.\n\nHere’s a prime example: The Dogs of Babel, which starts as the heartbroken narrator discovers his artsy, Goth wife has fallen from a tree and died. There are plenty of clues that this was not an accident. But there are no witnesses, except for poor Lorelei the dog. What starts out as a heartbreaking account of grief then takes a sharp turn into the bizarre as the narrator tries to teach Lorelei to speak so he can reconstruct his wife’s last hours. It descends into a seething underground, complete with people operating on dogs’ vocal chords to make them speak. Have I mentioned my list isn’t heartwarming? Did I swipe elements of this novel for my book? You bet…\n\nBy Carolyn Parkhurst,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Dogs of Babel as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nDiscovering clues that indicate his beloved wife may not have died accidentally, Paul Iverson begins a perilous search for the truth while attempting to teach his dog, who witnessed the crime, to communicate.\n\nPreview\n\nLord of the Flies\n\nBy William Golding,\n\nFrom my list on mystery that takes you into the characters head.\n\nBy Laura Giebfried Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve been intrigued with the mind for as long as I can remember. As a child, I imagined shrinking myself down and worming my way into other people’s brains to discover how their thoughts differed from mine. When I realized that was impossible, I started creating characters and imagining how they would think, react, and feel. This led to writing novels and motivated me to get my bachelor’s in abnormal psychology and my master’s in forensic psychology. Now, with an innate curiosity for the mind and a background in how it works, I find myself drawn to reading and writing books that take me into characters’ heads.\n\nLaura's book list on mystery that takes you into the characters head\n\nWhy did Laura love this book?\n\nThis book took me into a world of darkness. That darkness–so beautifully juxtaposed with the innocence of childhood–left a lasting impression on me, which I haven’t shaken to this day and which has greatly inspired my writing.\n\nThere is no one protagonist, so I found myself entering the minds of several young boys as they try to make sense of the situation they’ve fallen into. Once inside their minds, I followed each of them on their equally frightening paths and was shaken to the core to see that it didn’t matter who chose to be good and who chose to embrace their animalistic sides, as they each fell in one way or another.\n\nStrange, dark, and twisted, I struggled to let go of these characters and still feel haunted by what became of them.\n\nBy William Golding,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n13 authors picked Lord of the Flies as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA plane crashes on a desert island and the only survivors, a group of schoolboys, assemble on the beach and wait to be rescued. By day they inhabit a land of bright fantastic birds and dark blue seas, but at night their dreams are haunted by the image of a terrifying beast. As the boys' delicate sense of order fades, so their childish dreams are transformed into something more primitive, and their behaviour starts to take on a murderous, savage significance.\n\nFirst published in 1954, Lord of the Flies is one of the most celebrated and widely read of modern…\n\nPreview\n\nCujo\n\nBy Stephen King,\n\nFrom my list on monster lovers (aka a \"beast\" for the senses).\n\nBy Michael Brumm Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nOn the wall in my office, I have an old newspaper article containing a recipe for Boris Karloff's guacamole. (If you're interested, the title of the article is \"Boris Karloff Mad About Mexican Food.\") I keep it there because it reminds me of what I love about this genre, in that monsters can contain multitudes. They're not just evil... they can also love guacamole. A good monster novel will have you both cowering in fear and feeling a pang of empathy for the creature, making it a ton of fun to read.\n\nMichael's book list on monster lovers (aka a \"beast\" for the senses)\n\nWhy did Michael love this book?\n\nThis is really how the Disney film Old Yeller should have ended, with a rabid canine raising hell and ripping out throats. What a phenomenal book.\n\nMy first foray into the world of Stephen King. I loved it so much I tried to name my dog Cujo … but I was overruled. We settled on Otto cause it sounds sorta similar. But, again, I love this book for the same reason I love Who Goes There?—a beast is terrorizing people who are trapped and can’t flee. It’s a simple formula for monster-themed novels, but it gets me every single time.\n\nBy Stephen King,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n6 authors picked Cujo as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe #1 New York Times bestseller, Cujo “hits the jugular” (The New York Times) with the story of a friendly Saint Bernard that is bitten by a bat. Get ready to meet the most hideous menace ever to terrorize the town of Castle Rock, Maine.\n\nOutside a peaceful town in central Maine, a monster is waiting. Cujo is a two-hundred-pound Saint Bernard, the best friend Brett Camber has ever had. One day, Cujo chases a rabbit into a cave inhabited by sick bats and emerges as something new altogether.\n\nMeanwhile, Vic and Donna Trenton, and their young son Tad, move…\n\nPreview\n\nHell Hound\n\nBy Ken Greenhall,\n\nFrom my list on wild and weird books on dogs.\n\nBy Neal W. Fandek Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’m the author of the Peter Pike private eye series. Pike is a beat-up Middle Eastern veteran-turned private eye who finds himself embroiled in mysteries, usually with lost treasure involved: in the huge, sophisticated Indian civilizations that were here before us; in Lincoln’s murky sexuality; in a lost Faberge egg and the downfall of the Romanovs; and with Peter Pike and the Silver Shepherd, some rather nasty (and one nice) Nazi war dogs.\n\nNeal's book list on wild and weird books on dogs\n\nWhy did Neal love this book?\n\nEvery list should have a lost classic, and this is mine: The tale of Baxter, the full-fledged psycho bull terrier, with, again, extended passages from the dog’s point of view. The book opens with Baxter musing:\n\n“What if some morning as the old woman stood at the head of the staircase she were suddenly to feel a weight thrusting against the back of her legs? What if she were to lunge forward, grasping at the air, striking her thin skull against the edge of a stair?”\n\nBad dog. Baxter then trots over to live with the young couple across the street. That doesn’t end so well either. Then he finds true love with a kid with as little capacity for love as Baxter, and suddenly Baxter is no longer the antagonist and … the novel comes full circle. Very dark and very funny in spots and, I hate to repeat…\n\nBy Ken Greenhall,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Hell Hound as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n‘What are the possibilities of my strength? That is a thought I have never had before. What if some morning as the old woman stood at the head of the staircase she were suddenly to feel a weight thrusting against the back of her legs? What if she were to lunge forward, grasping at the air, striking her thin skull against the edge of a stair? What would become of me if she were found unmoving at the bottom of the stairway?’\n\nSuch are the thoughts of Baxter, a sociopathic bull terrier on the hunt for the perfect master, as…\n\nPreview\n\nA Straunge and Terrible Wunder\n\nBy Abraham Fleming,\n\nFrom my list on wild and weird books on dogs.\n\nBy Neal W. Fandek Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’m the author of the Peter Pike private eye series.

Hell hounds pop up in legends and stories from all over the world: Cerberus from Greek mythology; almost every single European country including Garmr from Norse mythology and ye fierce blacke dogges of English folklore; all over Latin America; China; Japan; India; Arabia; Russia; even the United States.\n\nThis account of a demon dog stalking English churches in the time of Shakespeare and Queen Elizabeth I is the earliest account I’ve found in English. The full title is A straunge and terrible wunder wrought very late in the parish church of Bongay, a tovvn of no great distance from the citie of Norwich, namely the fourth of…\n\nBy Abraham Fleming,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked A Straunge and Terrible Wunder as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis is a reproduction of a classic text optimised for kindle devices.

As a young reader, I lost hours on end exploring Africa with this man separated from all society. Mr. Burroughs has a way of storytelling easily followed and powerfully descriptive. The story is simple but compelling and easily accessible for early teens.\n\nBy Edgar Rice Burroughs, Remo (illustrator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Tarzan of the Apes as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nTarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs\n\nHow is this book unique?\n\nTablet and e-reader formatted\n\nOriginal & Unabridged Edition\n\nAuthor Biography included\n\nIllustrated version\n\nTarzan of the Apes is a novel written by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the first in a series of books about the title character Tarzan.

That’s what I felt reading Athabasca. Growing up in northern Utah, I thought I knew cold. Then Alistair MacLean introduced me to a true, icy, desperate cold. The atmosphere is so much a part of this story, it’s like a character. I’ll admit, this book challenged me as a young reader. It tends to plod along at glacial pace until the last third of the book, but that end is feverishly spectacular. This book is the first I read by this author and I rapidly devoured all his other titles.\n\nBy Alistair MacLean,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Athabasca as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nReissue of the nail-biting tale of sabotage set in the desolate frozen wastes of two ice-bound oil fields, from the acclaimed master of action and suspense.\n\nSABOTAGE!\n\nTHE VICTIMS\n\nTwo of the most important oil-fields in the world - one in Canada, the other in Alaska.\n\nTHE SABOTEURS\n\nAn unknown quantity - deadly and efficient. The oil flow could be interrupted in any one of thousands of places down the trans-Alaskan pipeline.\n\nTHE RESULT\n\nCatastrophe.\n\nOne man, Jim Brady, is called in to save the life-blood of the world as unerringly, the chosen targets fall at the hands of a…\n\nPreview\n\nNo Parachute\n\nBy Arthur Gould Lee,\n\nWhy did Brian love this book?\n\nI grew up on Air Force bases, and like most kids, I wanted to fly planes. Arthur Lee gave me the chance to not just fly, but to experience the thrilling life of a pilot during the first world war. His description of life for a fighter pilot in those early days of military aviation captured my heart. The way they lived and the realities they faced revealed on those pages I devoured without sleep. I couldn’t put it down.\n\nBy Arthur Gould Lee,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked No Parachute as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nFrom the young airmen who took their frail machines high above the trenches of World War I and fought their foes in single combat there emerged a renowned company of brilliant aces - among them Ball, Bishop, McCudden, Collishaw and Mannock - whose legendary feats have echoed down half a century. But behind the elite there were, in the Royal Flying Corps, many hundreds of other airmen who flew their hazardous daily sorties in outdated planes without ever achieving fame.\n\nHere is the story of one of these unknown flyers - a story based on letters written on the day,…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Call of the Wild\n\nBy Jack London,\n\nWhy did Ken love this book?\n\nI love this book for its fabulous sense of place, nonstop action, and realistic depiction of the rough-and-tumble Yukon during the 1890s Gold Rush.\n\nThe protagonist may be a dog but Buck, the good-heard Saint Bernard we meet as affable and innocent puppy, is I truly believe one of the most unforgettable characters in the history of adventure novels. His transition to a feral state is utterly believable as the book unfolds the darkness that lies at the heart of all too many men and the often violent chain of events that causes Buck to seek a new life.\n\nI have read this book three times, and each time, it continues to amaze me.\n\nBy Jack London,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n9 authors picked The Call of the Wild as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 8, 9, 10, and 11.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nPuffin Classics bring together the best-loved stories to a new generation.\n\nIn The Call of the Wild life is good for Buck in Santa Clara Valley, where he spends his days eating and sleeping in the golden sunshine. But one day a treacherous act of betrayal leads to his kidnap, and he is forced into a life of toil and danger. Dragged away to be a sledge dog in the harsh and freezing cold Yukon, Buck must fight for his survivial. Can he rise above his enemies and become the master of his realm once again?\n\nJack London (1876-1916) was…\n\nPreview\n\nKazan\n\nBy James Oliver Curwood,\n\nWhy did Tabitha love this book?\n\nThis is an old book, in the tradition made so popular by Jack London. There were a number of these ‘proud, free dog of the North’ type of books published, and they are all great reads, yet this one is in my opinion the finest of them. It never descends into mawkish sentiment, but tells Kazan’s story from his own viewpoint; there is little of the human world, and we get a glimpse of just how alien a wild animal is, how different from our own, more domestic companions.\n\nA tremendously exciting read, with not a dull page in it.\n\nBy James Oliver Curwood,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Kazan as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis carefully crafted ebook: \"Kazan, the Wolf Dog\" is formatted for your eReader with a functional and detailed table of contents.\n\nExcerpt:\n\n\"Kazan lay mute and motionless, his gray nose between his forepaws, his eyes half closed. A rock could have appeared scarcely less lifeless than he; not a muscle twitched; not a hair moved; not an eyelid quivered. Yet every drop of the wild blood in his splendid body was racing in a ferment of excitement that Kazan had never before experienced; every nerve and fiber of his wonderful muscles was tense as steel wire...\"\n\nJames Oliver Curwood was…\n\nPreview"
