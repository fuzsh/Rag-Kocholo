        "text": "‘White Fang’ has often been called the antithesis to ‘The Call of the Wild’, and while this is very true, the books are also very similar. The ‘Call’ is the story of a tame dog transformed by the rigors and hardships of life into a wolf of legend, a true beast of the Wild. ‘White Fang’, meanwhile, tracks a young wolf pup from his birth and follows him, also a beast of the wild, through life until as his story ends, we can see him as a quiet, peaceable dog, and much like the dog in the beginning of the ‘Call’ was. In many ways, it’s the same story, reversed and changed sometimes subtly, sometimes not so subtly. Even though they are very similar, it is often that ‘The Call of the Wild’ is singled out as great, while ‘White Fang’ lingers in the background of obscurity. Why is this? Is it because the ‘Call’ is simply that much greater of a book, while ‘White Fang’ is simply an inferior work? I do not think so. In fact, counter to that claim of the superiority of the ‘Call’, I believe ‘White Fang’ is, and far so, the ‘better’ work of writing. As relates to the overall style, plot, writing of these books, I believe they are very much on the same level. However, I believe that the opinion on these books has more to do with the themes and feelings behind and in them than the overall quality of writing and plot. Therefore to attempt to answer this question, of why the ‘Call’ is regarded more highly than ‘White Fang’, we will examine these books, attempting to find and discover the ideas and themes behind them, as well as attempt to understand why the general public embraces the ‘Call’s themes more wildly than ‘White Fang’s.\n\nTo begin with, I believe that when trying to understand the themes and ideas of two books with a common author, it is helpful to start off with an idea of the writer himself, and the ideas he would wish to impart through his writing. Jack London was grew up in the late 1800’s, and at a very early age began to run, you could say, wild throughout the land. He tramped across America, going from California to New York, before finally returning, only to set off once again for the Klondike in the Alaskan gold rush. Before setting off, however, he spent some time reading Darwin, which greatly influenced his writings. London’s writing was indeed born in this time, as he tramped through woods and snow, with Darwin’s words, among others, roaming through his mind. This was Jack London. His books show the ideas both of a love of nature and the Wild, along with the idea that man is nothing more than an intelligent animal, no different than a bird, fish, or dog. These are the themes of Jack London’s writing, or rather, the themes he intended to write with. You cannot get very far into one of his novels without encountering these ideas, either through subtle actions or feelings, or written factually without a thought to disagreement. Both the ‘Call’ and ‘White Fang’ are told through the perspective of a dog or wolf, and the feelings and thoughts they have never transcend their animalistic natures. Both White Fang and Buck, the main characters of ‘White Fang’ and ‘The Call’ respectively, experience a variety of situations in which they could express ‘human’ feelings, but London never goes there, except in a few cases. The characters are animals, and they never become anything more. While London could have humanized them, he chose not to, because, as he thought, humans were nothing more than advanced dogs, so, human emotions were nothing more than animal emotions evolved. He saw human feelings almost as he saw animal feelings. In his writing, there is no difference. This is London’s theme. Humans are animals. The thoughts, emotion, and feelings they have are no different than an animals, and if there are differences, it is only the difference of a puppy to an older and more mature dog. This is what London attempts to convince his readers of, and what he himself believes. London’s books are, in some ways, thoroughly without feeling. When we read ‘The Call’ and ‘White Fang’ we are stripped of ‘deeper’ feelings, and reduced to an animal state. This is London’s intention. These are the themes and ideas he penned into his writings. After this brief examination of the author, let’s begin the discussion of the themes of these books with a look at how they both hold true to their writer’s beliefs.\n\nHow do these stories hold true to London’s ideas of the world? They hold very true indeed. To begin with, in ‘The Call’, Buck never feels any truly human feeling towards anything. When he hates, as is the case with his rival sled dogs, it is out of necessity, out of ‘the survival of the fittest’. Buck feels these ways for no reason other than his desire to live. He hates these dogs, and other creatures, because they stand in the way of him living, and therefore are worthy to be despised. He doe not hate them because they hurt him, necessarily, he encounters many things that hurt him, but does not feel hate for. He does not hate them because they harmed something dear to him, there is nothing dear to him at all, besides one notable exception. As he himself recounts later in his mind, he felt no true affection for his old master, or the children he used to hunt with in his tame days. He simply walked with them, out of necessity for food and shelter, along with the simple lack of a desire to change things, or even think about how they could be different. Those thoughts are of no use to an animal, as the only focus of his life is the struggle for life itself. If one is living comfortably, there is no need to change it. Buck, to get back to what I was discussing before, only hated those who would threaten to quench this life of his. He lived for life, and in the struggle for it would ‘hate’ those who would take it from him, and ‘love’ those who would help him. He never rose above those natural, animal instincts. Even at times when it seemed like Buck was truly pondering life, as an animal would not and only as humans could, such as the times he would stare into campfires and ‘see’ the past in his mind, it is only, as London repeatedly tells us, his ‘natural’ sense of the wild, being passed down to him. Buck is not pondering the past, he is simply inheriting the long forgotten thought of his ancestors, the same thoughts that taught him how to walk and run, eat and breathe. These thoughts at the campfire are nothing more than instinctual, animal ideas. This is, again, the manifestation of London’s ideas of human thought and feelings being nothing more than a more evolved sense of Buck’s campfire instincts, and his sense of the past.\n\nIn the same way, White Fang is also indisputably an animal. His thoughts and feelings are nothing more than an animalistic instinct. At times, it seems White Fang is more than an animal, such as when he returns to his master for apparently no reason after being free of him and living in the wild. It is with great pains, however, that London assures us of the thought that White Fang is only returning because of his dependence upon the humans for food and shelter, as well as a sheer ‘lowness’ of thought that compels him to return simply for the reason, as with Buck, that if he is alive in one way, there is no need to change or think about it differently. Life is as it is, these dogs ‘think’; they have no reason to want it any different. In much the same way as Buck, White Fang ‘hates’ a particularly cruel master because his very life, which in his animal way is the only thing that matters, is regularly being cast upon almost luck. This endangers his life, which means this master is an enemy, and needs to be ‘hated’. In some ways, however, ‘White Fang’ goes farther than ‘The Call’, in its attempt at turning humans into beasts. Throughout White Fang’s life, he is constantly referring to the humans he interacts with as ‘gods’. They are gods to him because when he is very young, his mother is reverent to them, and respective of the power they hold. It is not because they truly are gods, but only because White Fang sees them as this. London again, repeatedly assures us of this. It is, after all, he who is behind every thought of White Fang. In this way, London attacks yet another fundamental aspect of humanity, besides deeper thoughts and feelings, the sense of a higher power, and creator. London’s tone and attitude towards White Fang’s simplistic views on these ‘gods’ reflects his scorn upon those who would be silly enough to think that they are more than animals, and that there is indeed a power out there, a higher being. Throughout his books, this is London’s theme. Humans are nothing more than evolved animals, and any thoughts and feelings they have are just as the thoughts and feelings of dogs, except of a more evolved and sophisticated tone. Love? Hate? The feeling that there is a creator? London explains it all away, scorning the very ideas, as he explores these thoughts through the minds of animals.\n\nIt might seem to you that I am skipping over certain parts of these books, such as Buck’s time with John Thornton, and White Fang’s with Scott, among others. I did not discuss these moments for two reasons. The first being that I was discussing the ways these books correspond with London’s views and these moments at times don’t align with, if not absolutely contradict, these views. The second isn’t really a reason in of itself, but more of a tie in with the first, in that I will discuss these moments, particularly in how they contradict London’s views in a moment. Before that however, I’d like to discuss why these moments do not align with London’s views, even though he wrote them, and had full control over what went into his own books. I believe that these ‘scenes of contradiction’ are in London’s books for the simple reason that they cannot be removed. These scenes represent themes that resonate with the whole order of being. These themes, the ‘Inextricable Themes of the Creator’, you could call them, are woven throughout the entire time of human existence. It might sound a little weird to you, but bear with me a moment. I believe that God created the entire world, and, in the words of Ecclesiastes, put ‘eternity in their hearts’, ‘their’ being all of mankind. Throughout the Bible, there are themes of sacrifice, love, grace, and faith along with the idea that man is inherently flawed, broken and incapable of saving himself, that are present in almost every book from the Old to the New Testament. These biblical themes are not just found only in scripture, however, but instead permeate every human thought. This permeation, resulting in stories of such themes, is shown throughout the history of the world, in all the parts of the world. Stories of sacrifice, love, grace, and faith abound everywhere. Indeed, it is impossible to tell a story without coming across one of these ideas, in some form or another. This makes sense when you consider that there is a God who designed the entire world, and knew of its every twist and turn from the very beginning. God longs to draw us to him, and so, just as nature proclaims the creator, creativity, especially writing, proclaims the themes and ideas of the original creator. God has woven these ideas of our hopelessness, need for a savior, grace, love, and sacrifice so deeply inside of our very humanity that is impossible to deny them, no matter how hard we try. These themes continue to point to God, to any mind willing to think upon them. We cannot deny these themes, but we can try to blot them out. This is what London attempts to do with his writing. He attempts to remove all mention of love, grace, faith, the deep feeling of sinfulness all humans have, the need for a savior, and sacrifice. He attempts to turn his writing into a testament to ‘nature’, a belief in, really, nothing. At this, London succeeds rather admirably at most points, but he fails when considering his writing as a whole, as he cannot fully scrub them clean of these thoughts and ideas. This is what I’d like to discuss next, the way these ‘Inextricable Themes of the Creator’ are woven into ‘The Call’ and ‘White Fang’.\n\nLet’s begin with ‘The Call of the Wild’, and start with Buck’s ‘love’ for Jack Thornton, which I said I’d come back to later. Buck’s ‘love’ in this case is very complicated. It is both aligned with London’s view and against it. It is aligned with London’s view, mostly because he says it is. Repeatedly during this part of Buck’s life, London takes care to make sure the reader doesn’t develop a wrong idea of Buck’s ‘love’ for Thornton. Continually we are told that Buck only cares for Thornton because of Thornton’s care for him. It is not un-animal-like, at all, London reassures us. Buck simply feels this way because Thornton saved him, and of the deep animal instinct of protecting and caring for those who care for you. It is a survival instinct, London tries to convince us. And yet, for two reasons this passage proclaims the themes of the creator. The first is that the feelings Buck feels for Thornton, while indeed mostly animal, do not explain the outrage and ferocious attack Buck wages upon the Indians that kill Thornton. Buck ignores the belief that he has founded his life upon to this point, ‘the law of fang and club’, and rushes to kill and destroy the Indians, who are humans, the highest level of this law. This violates the animalistic sense of living only to live. Killing the Indians does nothing to help Buck in his struggle for life, indeed, it does the opposite. Attacking the Indians, though he finds is surprisingly easy after beginning, is a needless risk of life, against what Buck at the time believed to be a formidable foe. This goes against all of London’s reasoning for ‘survival of the fittest’. Where does raging killing for a dead friend come in to helping an animal live? It does not. This act of love, something that should not happen, is unavoidable for London, and so he instead tries to mislead and deceive the reader into thinking it is a natural, animalistic instinct to endanger one’s life for no reason other than a sense of loss. There is another part of this, however, that also proclaims these themes of the creator in this passage. One simply needs to ask, ‘If these actions go counter to London’s beliefs, why are they included?’ London himself could not write a story without them. London, in his attempt to write without humanity, fails, and by his own admission. This passage could have been removed. Buck could have simply escaped some other way into the wild. London did not choose this path, instead creating a character simply for love. He knew it would have been much simpler, a lesser story, one that would not have been as appealing. And so love entered into London’s writing, against all of his intentions. ‘But, what if he had indeed removed this scene?’ you may ask. Wouldn’t it then have been without these themes? No, it would not have. There is more in London’s novels that express the creator than this passage. Throughout ‘The Call’, we are filled with an undeniable sense of emptiness. London would have us believe that this feeling of instinctual, animalistic, emptiness and life for the sake of life is how we should feel. But it isn’t. No matter how much London tries to squeeze humans into the bodies of animals, it is not possible. The life of Buck the dog is an empty façade. Animals live this life. They are fine with it. They cannot think. They live to live. London would have us believe the same. But we do not. Instead, the lack of feeling in Buck seems to us cold, and lonely. London writes ‘The Call of the Wild’ through the perspective of an animal, and attempts to wipe out all human themes from it. He mostly succeeds. But this success only inspires emptiness, emptiness that leaves us longing for something more. Something more than being an animal. And this screams aloud the truth that we are more than an animal, and that we need more than an animal needs. Try as he might, London cannot convince us we are fine as we are. He can fool us into thinking it for a time, but sooner or later, the idea is exposed as false, and the deep feeling of emptiness pervades our souls. London denies all other themes of the creator, but in doing so, leaves himself unable to defend his writing against this final theme. And so it invades. But it not, unlike most of the other themes, a ‘happy’ theme. It simply reminds us of our fallen, broken selves. This is really never pleasant, especially for one who does not know of salvation.\n\nThis then, is where I believe ‘White Fang’ triumphs over ‘The Call of the Wild’. To be sure, ‘White Fang’ possesses the very same feeling of emptiness and loneliness at points as ‘The Call’ does. But London does a far better job hiding away the other ‘themes of the creator’ in ‘The Call’, then he does with ‘White Fang’. In ‘White fang’ there are, as with Buck and Thornton, places where White Fang loves people and fellow creatures around him, such as his mother, his mate, and his eventual masters ‘property’. However, in ‘White Fang’, there is a greater love than Buck and Thornton, and it is due to London’s use of ‘The Greatest Theme of The Creator’. This ‘greatest’ theme being the grace and love for and salvation of a deservedly dying being. This is of course, the entire theme and idea behind creation. Jesus’ death on the cross for all of us, undeserving, sinful, broken people incapable of saving ourselves from death, out of love and grace is what, really, the world is based upon. From the very beginning, when man first failed, this has been God’s plan. It is no surprise then, that this theme above all others finds itself more often the other themes upon our minds. What is surprising, however, is that such an idea snuck into London’s writing. What would a naturalistic, evolutionist such as London, who believed that humans were nothing more than evolved animals, be doing writing about such an idea? One can only wonder if, as these themes are ‘written upon our hearts’ if London struggled with explaining these ideas of love and sacrifice to himself, and perhaps this was his attempt at de-humanizing it, and turning such an event into nothing more than an animalistic, instinctual action. London, however, failed miserably in this regard. White Fang is a trained dogfighter now. Every so often he is put into a cage with another dog, and the only way it will end is if one of them kills the other. And White Fang is good at this. He is a wolf, bred to kill. And so hed does, again and again, with ease. White Fang grows more and more wicked and bloodthirsty, his heart is full of rage and hate, and he has no thought of kindness. He is, in essence, a killer, through and through, with no shade of remorse or sadness. Then one day, he is beaten. A bull-dog, that he cannot kill is snuffing his life out. There is no escape for White fang. He is going to die. It is inevitable. He cannot save himself. Then, in comes Weedon Scott. Scott runs into the ring where White Fang is dying, and save him from death. A deserved death, in the eyes of many of the spectators. White fang is nothing more than a beast and all beasts eventually die. Why save one? It is simply out of love and grace that Scott frees White Fang, and persists in gaining his love even though White Fang is resistant to all attempts. Eventually, however, White Fang changes. He begins to truly love Scott, in a way that London even admits is not normal for an animal. White Fang does a complete U-turn in his life, going from a maniacal killer with only hate in his heart, to a loving and protective wolfdog. ‘White Fang’ ends finally with White Fang proving his love for Scott multiple times over, both in being submissive to Scotts orders and commands, and risking life and limb for Scott and those he loves. White Fang’s love is most evidenced by the time when White Fang kills a chicken, not knowing that this is against the rules. Scott’s father gives up on him, saying that ‘Once a chicken killer, always a chicken killer’. The family is saddened by this, to an extent, as they know that eventually now, White Fang will kill a neighbor’s chicken, and suffer the consequences. Scott however, instructs White Fang that chickens are off limits, and to test him, locks him into the chicken yard. White Fang not only does not touch any of the chickens, but eventually finds a way out of the yard itself, and flees. This is why I liked White Fang more than ‘Call of the Wild’, for what else is White Fang a picture of, than us? Jesus saved us from our hopelessness, and a death that was inevitable and deserved. More than that though, Jesus continues to love and care for us. He gives us orders and instructions that sometimes make no sense to us, as White Fang must have felt upon being ordered not to kill the chickens, which he saw as simply food. Yet out of love he obeys. He does not know that if he killed the chickens, punishment, and most likely death, would follow. And yet, he obeys. So it is with us. The word God tells us sometimes seems to hurt us, but we do not have the whole picture, and do no know what God knows. We can only obey him, out of love. White Fang’s story is more than just a book that has the creators themes in it, it is the story of all believers. And the fact that this all came from a man who had no such belief, indeed believed the opposite, is all the more amazing.\n\nHere we are then, at the end. We have gone over both how these two books, ‘White Fang’ and ‘The Call of the Wild’. I hope you now agree, or at least understand, why I believe ‘White Fang’ is the better of the two. Not for its writing, or plot, or style, but for its deep, inextricable themes of salvation from death, and the life of the believer. This is also then, in the same way, the reason the general opinion is that ‘The Call of The Wild’ is seen as the better. Is it just for this reason? I am sure it is not. I am sure there are those who much prefer the plot and writing of ‘The Call’ over ‘White Fang’. But I do believe that it is a major reason. For those who read these books, like Jack London, want his beliefs to be true. They are inextricably drawn to the emptiness of ‘The Call’, attempting to convince themselves that what it tells of is true. ‘White Fang’, meanwhile, is a stunning testament to forces and ideas they do not want to acknowledge, or even think upon. And so readers choose, over and over again, the emptiness and bleakness of ‘The Call’, over the hope, love, grace, sacrifice and redemption of ‘White Fang’. As John 3:20 says, ‘For everyone who does wicked things hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.’ In ‘White Fang’ the unbeliever hears a ‘call’ that is contrary to their ideas, and would force them to acknowledge their darkness, and turn to a greater and more powerful being themselves for salvation. And so instead, they are content to bear the emptiness and darkness of the ‘The Call’, and praise its false lucidity of humanity."
