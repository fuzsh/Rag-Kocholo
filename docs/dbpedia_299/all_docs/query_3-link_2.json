        "text": "After I read Into The Wild a couple of years ago, I made a mental note of the authors that Chris McCandless had read in his life. Eventually in that process, I picked up Walden by Henry David Thoreau and fell in love with that work ever since and became his fan and a nature-lover. Now, recently I picked up Jack London's White Fang from the same mental note of mine, and I'm intrigued by the wild beauty this book holds in its pages. I mean, in a nutshell the book is simply about a growing wolf cub and its life in the wilderness and domesticity, but man it was splendidly written. I never knew that an animal's life can be so beautifully and deeply penned. Jack London is a genius.\n\nEDIT: And I also think I now slowly see what influenced the mind of Chris McCandless to do what he did with his life."
