It’s a French-Canadian cartoon series from 1992 which is very loosely based on the famous novel by Jack London, White Fang. I discovered it around 2012 and have been a huge fan of it ever since. I now own the complete series’ DVD box set. With gorgeous traditional animation and watercolor backgrounds, it has the feel of a classic adventure series. Each of its 26 episodes has its own original standalone story. I watch it mainly for the unique dog and wolf characters, such as White Fang himself and members of his pack, but the adventures of the human characters are interesting to me as well.

I am making this post because I plan to upload fanart for this show to this blog in the near future. I can’t help but notice the serious lack of fan material on the internet. If more people (especially furries) knew about The Legend of White Fang, I’m sure they would find that there is A LOT to work with here! There are plenty of one-off characters and unresolved storylines which are perfect for fanfic writers. It is also SO EASY to create OCs for this series and put them basically anywhere in this universe. In short, I’m going to have a lot of fun here.
