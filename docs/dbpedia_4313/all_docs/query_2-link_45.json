        "text": "Brian Patterson\n\nOur positioning within the cultural map of time is the result of humanity’s constant search for identity and meaning. My working practice is concerned with the poetics of being in relation to place (the present/environment) and intellectually how we have arrived here (through our past/histories), and the potentially to navigate our future/s.\n\nMy specific interest in art has evolved into the metaphysical aspects of being and the dualism that arises, between our transient ephemeral realms and different natures of our physical bodies in relation to being constant spiritual embodiments. The relationship between being and the world we experience around us, informs the world/s we live in, from the private to the community.\n\nArt through its creative process is an integrated and alchemical transformation of the self and consciousness. It has a vital role for the well being of the individual in todays’ society. As Gandhi said, “Be the change you want to see in the world”\n\nElvira Santamaria\n\nAction Art is an amorphous form of art and existential practise of self-knowledge. Its poetic postulates the self-creation through the acts, and it is an endless process of learning. The symbolic act creates important reference points in the evolution of the consciousness of the artist, but the not symbolic one is the true dimension of the present.\n\nI work with the things that life presents me in the moment. I don’t use things, I try to dialog with them. The public context is for me the place where the creation of situations can deconstruct what we think about reality, human relationships and ourselves. Following the ideas of the situationists, “the audience must not exist anymore but les ‘vivants’ (the living people), in their plural and diverse forms”.\n\nMy works has evolved through a personal search by means of many forms of action art (performance, public interventions, process, installation etc). Nowadays I am doing urban interventions, process art and In-situ installations, which are rarely practiced in Mexico."
