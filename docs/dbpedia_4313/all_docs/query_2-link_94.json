        "text": "Verb fluency (VF) is the less commonly used fluency test, despite several studies suggesting its potential as a neuropsychological assessment tool. To investigate the presence of VF deficits in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) dementia; to assess the usefulness of VF in the detection of cognitively healthy (CH) people who will convert to MCI, and from MCI to dementia; and to establish the VF cut-offs useful in the cognitive assessment of Spanish population. 568 CH, 885 MCI, and 367 mild AD dementia individuals were administered the VF test and a complete neuropsychological battery. Longitudinal analyses were performed in 231 CH and 667 MCI subjects to search for VF predictors of diagnosis conversion. A worsening on VF performance from CH, MCI to AD dementia groups was found. Lower performances on VF were significantly related to conversion from CH to MCI/MCI to dementia. When the effect of time to conversion was analyzed, a significant effect of ...\n\nThis study aims at investigating the ability of Greek-speaking individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to comprehend and produce verbs that vary with respect to their lexical and grammatical aspect. Lexical aspect concerns situation types with different temporal and semantic features, such as activity ( run ), state ( know ), achievement ( break ), semelfactive ( hit ), accomplishment ( build ) verbs (Smith 1997). Grammatical aspect is divided into perfective ( I untied ) and imperfective ( I was untying ) (Comrie 1976). The interaction of lexical and grammatical aspect and how that might be affected by patients’ linguistic impairment is also examined."
