        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative ailment and the most common cause of dementia worldwide [1, 2]. Unfortunately, despite intensive research and a great societal need, biomarkers for reliable and cost-effective early diagnosis of AD are still in their infancy. This also presents an impediment for the development of new drugs, and there is presently no cure for AD.\n\nThe main obstacle for further progress is the lack of important basic knowledge about the complex dynamic processes that lead to AD development. While detailed molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood, it is well established that an imbalance in the production and clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, accompanied by their self-assembly into structured aggregates and accumulation in so-called senile plaques in the central nervous system (CNS) of affected individuals, is a characteristic of AD. The Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis proposes that misfolding, aggregation, and deposition of Aβ peptides is a major cause of AD [3]. Aβ peptides are 39–42 amino acids long peptides derived from the amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) via proteolytic processing. The most common forms of Aβ peptides are Aβ40 and Aβ42 (reviewed in [4]).\n\nThe aggregation mechanisms have been investigated using a variety of different analytical techniques, including fluorescence spectroscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ([5] and references therein). Early on a fluorescence assay with the benzothiazole salt Thioflavin T (ThT) became a standard method for amyloid detection by fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy [6, 7]. As more recent studies have shown, amyloidogenic aggregates enriched with pleated β-sheet secondary structure readily bind ThT and significantly alter its spectral properties, shifting the absorption spectrum towards longer wavelengths and significantly increasing the fluorescence quantum yield (Fig. 1, inset) [8–12].\n\nFig.1\n\nDiagnostic methods for early AD detection are still under heavy discussion [13–16]. For diagnosis of prodromal patients, before mental decline is noticeable, it is required that reliable biomarkers are available [17]. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) autoantibodies against Aβ have shown promise and warrant further investigations [18, 19], but the predictive power has not been particularly encouraging so far. Brain imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) and radiotracers will reliably reflect on fibrillar deposits of amyloid in the brain that are >1 mm in size [20–22]. Measuring the content of Aβ peptides (and tau protein) in the CSF using immunochemical techniques is also considered reliable [23–25]. However, PET is expensive and CSF sampling is invasive. In topical reviews [13, 14], the authors list drawbacks of simply measuring Aβ in blood plasma as a diagnostic method, and show that attempts to correlate blood studies and PET or CSF results are not convincing so far. The heterogeneous and different structural states of Aβ measured by the two technologies are one probable reason for the experimental difficulties: the immunochemical methods measure the soluble forms of the Aβ peptide(s), whereas the PET method measures the precipitated insoluble peptide aggregates in the brain. There is no clear direct connection between the two types of measurements, even if both relate back to the presence and behavior of the Aβ peptide. There is obviously a strong need for a novel, non-invasive, and reliable method for early AD diagnostics. The lack of such methods also presents an impediment for the development of new therapies aiming to reduce the amyloid burden in the brain, which critically depends on the possibility to routinely identify and characterize the levels of structured amyloidogenic aggregates in the same individual repeatedly over time.\n\nHere we present a fluorescence-based assay on blood serum labelled with the amyloid-sensitive dye ThT. The method is based on observations using a time-resolved and highly sensitive single-molecule fluorescence technology called fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). We have earlier used the ThT based FCS assay (ThT-FCS) to study the heterogeneity and turnover of Aβ peptide aggregates during their fibril formation process in vitro [5]. In the present study, we show that the passage of ThT-active structured amyloidogenic oligomeric aggregates, hereafter called nanoplaques, through an extremely small (< femtoliter) focal volume can be recorded in real time, the number of passages can be counted and the passage time can be measured. We show that the number of passages and the passage time are related to the concentration and size of the nanoplaques, respectively, and that there is a significant difference in the number and the size of nanoplaques in the blood serum from diagnosed AD patients and control individuals.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe present here a new quantitative method for the detection of structured amyloidogenic aggregates in blood serum that is based on the analysis of time-resolved ThT fluorescence intensity fluctuations. In the presence of amyloid fibrils and structured amyloidogenic oligomers ThT acquires fluorescence excitation and emission spectra that are markedly distinct from those of the free dye (Fig. 1, inset) [8–12]. This change in fluorescence is generally considered to be specific for ThT interactions with amyloidogenic structures, and is not induced upon binding to native protein monomers or amorphous aggregates [6, 7]. Due to this property, ThT has been widely used to visualize tissue amyloid deposits by fluorescence microscopy [37–39]; ThT congeners are also the bases for in vivo imaging using PET and single photon emission computed tomography [40–42]; and ThT is indispensable in basic studies of protein aggregation by classical, bulk fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor the time course of amyloid fibril formation from purified proteins and peptides in vitro [5, 43, 44].\n\nWhile classical bulk ThT fluorescence spectroscopy is very important for basic studies of Aβ aggregation kinetics [43], this method also has serious limitations. Most notably, bulk ThT fluorescence spectroscopy involves signal integration time that is typically of the order of 1–10 s, averaging ThT fluorescence over all Aβ aggregation states that are present in the sample [43]. When such measurements are performed in blood serum, fluorescence originates from autofluorescence and from dim fluorescence arising from ThT-active compounds present in a large excess, such as lipids, proteins (disordered or acquiring other types of secondary structure than β-pleated sheet), organic heterocyclic molecules and their derivatives. The contribution of rare and short-lasting (0.2–100 ms) fluorescence intensity peaks that arise when sparse, yet bright ThT-active structured amyloidogenic aggregates pass through the OVE, is averaged out over the long signal integration time and the contribution from autofluorescent and ThT-active molecules, while dim in comparison, prevails as the molecules that give raise to it outnumber by far the bright ThT-active structured amyloidogenic nanoplaques. Hence, the mean ThT fluorescence of blood serum depends on its specific biochemical composition, individual differences in mean ThT serum fluorescence intensity are large (Supplementary Table 1) and the usefulness of bulk ThT fluorescence spectroscopy in biomedical diagnostics of amyloid-featuring diseases has been shown to be limited [34, 35].\n\nIn contrast to bulk ThT fluorescence spectroscopy, time-resolved detection of fluctuations in ThT fluorescence in a sub-femtoliter OVE does not involve such averaging [5]. Here, the signal is recorded with a sub-microsecond temporal resolution and the passage of bright ThT-active structured amyloidogenic nanoplaques through the OVE can be readily discerned (Fig. 3). In our analysis, we are counting the numbers of fluorescence intensity peaks that differ from the mean fluorescence intensity by a value that is five times larger than the SD of the whole time series. We are counting the number of fluorescence peaks, i.e., determine the frequency of their encounter (fSEO) to measure the concentration of amyloidogenic aggregates, and we analyze the average duration of fluorescence intensity peaks to determine the diffusion time, i.e. the size of the amyloidogenic aggregates. When the background is low, the signal-to-background ratio is high, and the peaks are easily discernible. However, even if the background is high, our analysis is, within certain limits, possible because of the following reason – the more autofluorescent and ThT-active molecules in the blood serum, the larger the mean fluorescence intensity, but the smaller the SD of the time series. Given that the peaks are identified through an increase in fluorescence intensity that is five times larger than the SD of the whole time series, the fluorescence peaks are, within certain limits, discernible even though the background signal is high.\n\nIn conclusion, we report here the detection of structured amyloidogenic aggregates in the blood serum using time-resolved ThT serum fluorescence intensity fluctuations. Moreover, we demonstrate that there is a positive correlation between AD diagnosis and the mean frequency at which ThT-active structured amyloidogenic aggregates occur in the blood serum of AD patients (Figs. 4 and 6); and that there is a pronounced difference in the translational diffusion of ThT-active structured amyloidogenic nanoplaques in the blood serum of AD patients (Fig. 5), which indicates that the ThT-active structured amyloidogenic nanoplaques are significantly larger in AD patients.\n\nWhile the capacity of this method for the early identification of individuals at risk to develop AD remains to be confirmed in large clinical trials, our results clearly show that this new method with single-particle sensitivity, which neither relies on the use of immune-based probes, nor on the use of radiotracers, signal-amplification or protein separation techniques, may provide a minimally invasive test for a fast and cost-effective early determination of structurally modified proteins in the peripheral blood circulation, CSF, but also in other, more easily accessible biological fluids, such as saliva and urine.\n\nHowever, we also need to caution about the limitations of the current method. One problem associated with ThT-based fluorescence assays for the detection of structured amyloidogenic forms of Aβ in biological fluids is that only relatively large oligomeric states (>40 monomers) appear to have attained structures which give rise to observable ThT fluorescence [5]. The smaller oligomeric states, which are more abundant at an early kinetic stage of the aggregation process and which are considered to be among the most cell toxic species, seem not to be made fluorescent by ThT binding [5, 45]. However, the presence of ThT-fluorescence at later kinetic stages of peptide aggregation is generally considered to indicate that the toxic forms of oligomers are still present or have been present earlier (“on pathway”). In addition, in vitro studies show that the initial step in Aβ peptide aggregation is slow, but once the reaction has commenced, the turnover of small oligomers is fast [5]. Thus, while our method cannot detect the smallest oligomers, such as dimers, trimers, tetramers, etc., the smallest ThT-active structured amyloidogenic oligomeric aggregates will form very quickly after the inception of the aggregation process, enabling early AD diagnosis.\n\nIn addition, the ThT assay is a structure-based assay that efficiently identifies structurally modified proteins enriched in β-pleated sheet secondary structure and does not discriminate between aggregated protein targets of different chemical composition. Moreover, the nanoplaques may be composed of several different amyloid-forming peptides/proteins that cross-react with one another [46]. Hence, additional methods, such as immune-based and/or proteomic assays are needed to determine the chemical composition of the small structured amyloidogenic nanoplaques identified by ThT. This, however, is not a trivial task. Immune-based assays, such as the most frequently used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), digital ELISA [47, 48], sandwich ELISA [49], and associated methods recently reviewed by Andreasson et al. [50], immunoprecipitation–mass spectrometry (IP–MS) [51] and immuno-infrared-sensor [52–54] all have common inherent limitations that are related to the specificity and the sensitivity of the antibody-antigen reaction [55–57]. In the case of Aβ immune-based assays, the following difficulties, to name but a few, are typically encountered: monomeric Aβ that is present in excess can occupy binding sites on the antibody, thereby interfering with the detection of Aβ oligomers [58]; interference from the p3 peptide and Aβ-catabolic peptides derived from the non-amyloidogenic pathway of AβPP processing may introduce uncertainty in the interpretation of results [59]; substrates for signal amplification and detection are inherently unstable and may produce signal even in the absence of enzyme [50]. Proteomic approaches using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), 2D-PAGE, liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and related techniques, characterize directly the molecule of interest with high sensitivity and specificity, thereby providing invaluable information [60]. However, these techniques are constrained by the difficulty to detect low-abundance proteins in complex mixtures such as biological fluids due to limitations in the dynamic range; inability to measure intact larger proteins and involved sample preparation procedures [61]. As a consequence, there is to date no CSF biomarker discovered in proteomic studies that has reached the clinic [62].\n\nIn summary, we would like to underline that currently available immune-based methods clinically used for CSF and blood plasma biochemical analysis show that the concentration of Aβ42 decreases in the CSF and blood plasma of AD patients [23, 36, 63–65]. This is very likely due to the fact that the antibodies largely recognize monomeric Aβ peptides, whereas aggregation renders Aβ peptides into states that are not easily recognized by immunochemistry as discussed by Klaver et al. [58] and references cited therein. In contrast, our method measures the ThT reactive states in the blood serum that correspond to the actual amyloid states present in the fibrils seen in the brain. Obviously, the two types of observations both correlate with the AD pathology in the patient, as can be seen from the data presented in Fig. 6, but our method relies on a simple blood test to derive the information. The limit of quantification of the proposed method is unparalleled, reaching the ultimate single-particle sensitivity for structured aggregates comprising more than 40 Aβ monomers. Moreover, the proposed method allows us also to determine the distribution of structured aggregates size, which may be a valuable indicator of disease stage (early vs late) and a reliable predictor of disease progression [66, 67]."
