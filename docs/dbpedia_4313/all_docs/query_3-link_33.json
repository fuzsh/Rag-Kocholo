        "text": "BELGRADE -- By appointing two members who are under U.S. sanctions to the new Serbian government, Belgrade has only nurtured its relationship with Moscow, a senior associate with the Berlin-based Council for Democratization Policy told RFE/RL on April 30.\n\nBut including the two sanctioned officials to the new government roster \"doesn't imply abandoning the policy of sitting on two chairs\" -- one in the East and one in the West, said Bodo Weber, who replied to e-mailed questions from RFE/RL after the government was named.\n\nThe \"two-chair\" policy refers to Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic's attempt to maintain good relations with the European Union -- which Serbia strives to join -- while keeping close ties to traditional ally Russia, even after the Kremlin's decision to invade Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nMilos Vucevic, leader of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), was tapped last month to form a new government, and on April 30 he announced it will include former intelligence chief Aleksandar Vulin, who has been under U.S. sanctions since July 2023, to the post of deputy prime minister, and Nenad Popovic, another official blacklisted by the United States, as a minister without portfolio.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:25 0:00\n\nVulin was placed on the U.S. sanctions list in July 2023 for allegedly using his position to further Russian and criminal agendas, including arms dealing and drug trafficking.\n\nPopovic, designated in November 2023, used his Russia-based businesses to enrich himself and gain close connections with Kremlin senior leaders, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.\n\nThe U.S. State Department told RFE/RL that the United States is \"disappointed to see two sanctioned individuals proposed for positions in the new government.\" The department's e-mailed response to a request for comment added, \"Our position on Mr. Vulin and Mr. Popovic is well known. They remain under U.S. sanctions.\"\n\nVucevic also named Milica Djurdjevic Stamenkovski, president of the right-wing Zavetnici party, to head the Ministry of Family Care. The Zavetnici party, formerly in opposition, entered into cooperation with the SNS after the December elections, which were marred by widespread allegations of fraud and irregularities.\n\nThere also are several new names in the 25-member government, while 13 ministers remain at the helm of the same ministries they led in the previous government.\n\n\"There's a recognizable continuation of the trend of greater involvement of party operatives [and] members of the inner circle around Vucic,\" said Weber, adding that he didn't see any ideological shift in the policy of Vucic's regime in the composition of the new government.\n\nHe said Vucic's regime has always relied less on a specific ideology and more on maintaining power, \"so the authoritarian mindset behind it, rather than its nationalist ideological heritage, has been and remains more important.\"\n\nAsked what message the new government sends to the international community, Weber said EU membership has long been more of a means for Vucic to consolidate and maintain power and to strengthen Serbia's international position rather than a serious goal.\n\nAt the same time Weber is very critical of the European Union's \"appeasement policy\" toward Serbia, saying it means Vucic doesn't need to worry about what message his new government sends.\n\n\"Since the EU has failed to muster the strength to stop its long-failed appeasement policy toward the authoritarian-autocratic regime in Serbia, what continues is a performance devoid of any substance called Serbia's European integration,\" he said.\n\nAn initiative by Germany and France on the political dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo, a former province of Serbia whose independence Belgrade does not recognize, \"was based precisely on that previously proven failed appeasement policy toward Vucic,\" Weber added. \"It has gloriously failed in an unprecedented escalation in northern Kosovo, which Western capitals still aren't willing to acknowledge.\"\n\nTensions in ethnic-Serb dominated northern Kosovo have remained high since an incident in September that left an ethnic Albanian Kosovar police officer dead after an encounter with masked commandos allegedly led by a Kosovar Serb politician. Three of the gunmen were also killed.\n\nWeber said Belgrade will never face sanctions for the regime's \"direct responsibility for the attack…ensuring that even resorting to massive electoral fraud in the December elections in Belgrade won't provoke a serious reaction from the West.\"\n\nHe added that Vucic apparently had no concerns about a possible strong U.S. reaction to the appointment of two sanctioned ministers.\n\nThe policy of imposing sanctions on officials close to the Kremlin remains \"entirely disconnected from the general policy of the U.S. administration towards Belgrade.\"\n\nWeber also criticized the United States as having \"taken a leading role in the Western appeasement policy.\"\n\nHowever U.S. envoy for the Western Balkans Gabriel Escobar has urged the two sides to resolve their differences. And in March during a visit to Pristina he put pressure on Prime Minister Albin Kurti to reverse a ban on the use of Serbia's dinar in the country's north.\n\nBut Weber said it was apparent that nurturing relations with Moscow was considered in forming the government at a time when Vucic feels pressure due to the Council of Europe coming closer to admitting Kosovo and a UN resolution on the genocide in Srebrenica.\n\n\"However, this still doesn't mean abandoning the policy of sitting on two chairs,\" Weber said.\n\nWeber also said Vucevic has the capacity to lead the government and keep the cabinet together based on his status as a member of Vucic's \"inner circle\" and his position as president of the party.\n\nHe added that it will be interesting to see how Vucic relates to the prime minister, noting it won't be as easy to shift blame for negative events onto the government when it's led by the president of the ruling party.\n\nNone of this will jeopardize the stability of a regime that currently isn't seriously threatened, \"least of all by the West, and it seems, no longer by the opposition,\" Weber said.\n\nWith reporting by RFE/RL's Balkan Service\n\nAt least nine people were killed by fresh Russian strikes and the shelling of two Ukrainian regions on August 28 as an oil depot in Russia's Rostov region was engulfed in flames after a Ukrainian drone strike.\n\nSeveral of those killed were in Ukraine's eastern region of Donetsk, where fighting has been going on for several months as Russian troops press their offensive towards the regional hub of Pokrovsk.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\n\"This morning, Russians killed four people and destroyed a house in Izmaylivka in the Kurakhove community,\" Donetsk Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Telegram.\n\nFilashkin said that two more people were killed by Russian shelling in Chasiv Yar, in the region's Bakhmut district, which was the scene last year of a monthslong clash between Ukrainian forces and attacking mercenaries from the notorious Wagner Group.\n\nA total of 16 houses and two high-rise buildings were also damaged in the shelling Filashkin said.\n\nIn Ukraine's southern region of Zaporizhzhya, a Russian drone attack killed three people -- two women and a man -- the region's Governor Ivan Fedorov said.\n\n\"Two women aged 83 and 86 and a 61-year-old man died, three more women aged 19, 30, 56, and a 59-year-old man were wounded as a result of a Russian drone attack,\" Fedorov said.\n\nKryviy Rih, in the southern region Dnipropetrovsk region, was again targeted on August 28 by a Russian missile strike that wounded three people, regional Governor Serhiy Lysak reported, a day after another Russian Iskander missile hit a hotel in the city, kiling 4 people.\n\nLysak said infrastructure and cars also sustained damage in the city.\n\nEarlier on August 28, the governor of the southern Russian region of Rostov, Vasily Golubev, confirmed reports on Russian Telegram channels of a fire at an oil depot in Kamensky district.\n\nA strong explosion occurred before the fire broke out at the depot located close to the village of Molodezhny, reports on Telegram said.\n\n\"In the Kamensky district, as a result of a drone attack, a fire broke out at a fuel depot. There are no casualties. Emergency response forces are involved in the extinguishing the blaze. There is no threat of fire spreading to residential buildings,\" Golubev wrote on Telegram.\n\nGolubev said earlier that four drones had been shot down by Russian air defense systems above his region.\n\nBaza, a Telegram channel with close ties to Russia's security services said debris from two drones ignited a fire at three storage tanks in the Kamensky district.\n\nVideos posted on Telegram purported to show what appeared to be large fuel tanks burning in the dark.\n\nUkraine has not commented on the information, which could not be independently confirmed immediately.\n\nUkraine, whose civilian and energy infrastructure has been battered by relentless Russian strikes since the start of Moscow's unprovoked invasion in February 2022, has in turn resorted in recent months to targeting oil and fuel installations inside Russia that mainly work for the military.\n\nIn another Rostov district, Proletarsk, fuel tanks were reportedly still on fire some 10 days after they were hit by Ukrainian drones.\n\nIn the southwestern Voronezh region, Governor Aleksandr Gusev reported a fire \"near explosive objects,\" likely an ammunition depot.\n\n\"Air defense forces in the Rossoshansk district spotted and destroyed an aircraft-type unmanned aerial vehicle...The fall of fragments of the drone caused a fire near explosive objects. There was no detonation,\" Gusev wrote on Telegram.\n\nHe said there were no casualties among civilians, but the residents of two nearby villages had been evacuated by bus as a precaution,\n\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian military said it had shot down a Russian Su-25 plane in Kramatorsk, in the eastern region of Donetsk.\n\n\"In the direction of Kramatorsk, our military shot down a Russian Su-25 aircraft that was trying to fire at the positions of units of the Defense Forces. Antiaircraft forces employed \"a well-aimed shot from a MANPADS system,\" to destroy the plane, the military said in a statement.\n\nMANPADS (Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems) are lightweight and highly mobile antiaircraft weapons.\n\nFrench prosecutors are poised to charge or release Pavel Durov, the Russian-born co-founder and CEO of the Telegram messaging app, whose detention since the weekend has roiled Moscow.\n\nThe deadline for a decision on Durov comes as the 96-hour questioning period ends on August 28. No exact time has been given for when a decision will be handed down.\n\nDurov, a billionaire who holds citizenships from Russia, France, the United Arab Emirates, and the Caribbean island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, was detained at Le Bourget airport outside Paris on August 24 and held for questioning.\n\nFrance's OFMIN, an office tasked with preventing violence against minors, has reportedly issued an arrest warrant for Durov in a preliminary investigation into alleged offenses, including fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, organized crime, and the promotion of terrorism.\n\nTelegram has said that Durov “has nothing to hide” and that it is “awaiting a prompt resolution of this situation.\"\n\nMoscow has expressed outrage over what it said appeared to be \"a direct attempt to restrict freedom of communication,\" while the Kremlin has said the allegations against Durov were “very serious” and that “they require evidence that is just as serious” to erase the suspicions of many that the billionaire's arrest was politically motivated.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has tried to allay such suspicion, saying Durov's arrest was solely part of an independent investigation.\n\nDubai-based Telegram boasts more than 900 million users worldwide. In his first major interview in seven years, which he gave to U.S. conservative media figure Tucker Carlson on April 17, Durov vowed that Telegram aims to be a \"neutral platform\" and not a \"player in geopolitics.\"\n\nCritics in Ukraine, however, say it spreads misinformation and facilitates illegal actions. Some accuse Telegram of having ties to the Russian state and of contributing to its war effort.\n\nAccess to Telegram was temporarily restricted by Russia in 2018. The decision was made after the messaging app allegedly refused to provide Russia's FSB security agency with encryption keys from users' correspondence, citing the secrecy of correspondence guaranteed by the Russian Constitution.\n\nThe decision to block the app was sharply criticized by many Russian public figures, as well as critics of the Russian government. However, independent Russian media reports indicated that Telegram reached a compromise with the authorities and has been sharing some data with the security services for several years, although that has been denied by Telegram.\n\nThe former editor in chief of Novaya Gazeta and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dmitry Muratov has called on the Red Cross to intervene to alleviate the situation of Aleksei Gorinov, who is serving a 7-year sentence that rights groups and his supporters say is politically motivated.\n\nGorinov, 63, a former Moscow municipal lawmaker, was sentenced in July 2022 for spreading \"fake news\" about the Russian military because of his stance in opposition to Russia's aggression against Ukraine.\n\nIn November 2023, a new criminal case was opened against him for \"justifying terrorism.\"\n\nMuratov sent the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Mirjana Spoljaric-Egger, a request to assist in providing medical assistance to Gorinov.\n\n\"The consequences of inaction are obvious. I ask you, Ms. Spoljaric, to facilitate the provision of medical assistance and to intervene to stop the torture of Aleksei Gorinov by authorities. I again ask you for an urgent inspection by the Red Cross into places where internationally recognized political prisoners are held in Russia and Belarus,\" Novaya Gazeta quotes Muratov's letter as saying.\n\nNovaya Gazeta writes that Gorinov was not issued a mattress or blanket, does not have hot water or a working toilet, and is deprived of books, letters, and phone calls. The publication says that due to his complete isolation, Gorinov has begun to forget words.\n\n\"He is facing a second sentence -- in a case regarding conversations he had with cellmates in which he allegedly justified terrorism,\" Novaya Gazeta writes, adding that the accusation is based on false testimonies by other prisoners.\n\n\"The word of a criminal against the word of a political prisoner is, of course, more significant; Gorinov will be given an extra sentence. He will certainly not live to see the end of it,\" Novaya Gazeta writes.\n\nGorinov was the first individual to receive a prison term under the article on the dissemination of \"fake\" information about the Russian military, which was added to the Russian Criminal Code after the start of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nGorinov underwent surgery to remove part of one lung in 2016. His support group has repeatedly reported on his health problems in prison.\n\nAfghanistan is one of the largest recipients of humanitarian aid from the European Union, EU officials said on August 27, one day after saying it was appalled by a new decree issued by the Taliban-led government further restricting the lives of women.\n\nThe European Union this year has provided 125 million euros ($139 million) to Afghanistan for humanitarian-aid purposes, Balazs Ujvari, European Commission spokesman for budget, human resources, humanitarian aid, and crisis management, said at a European Commission news briefing in Brussels.\n\nIn addition to classic aid distribution, the EU has also organized 35 “air-bridge” flights carrying 1,600 tons of aid since 2021.\n\n“This shows that in a broad variety of areas, we are deploying a variety of humanitarian and civil-protection tools as well to try and alleviate the ongoing difficulties in the country,\" Ujvari said.\n\nEuropean Commission chief spokesman Eric Mamer added that when the EU distributes humanitarian aid, it works with partner organizations, not the government.\n\nNabila Massrali, spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, said the EU reacted very quickly on August 26 to the Taliban’s so-called Law on the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, but at the same time she defended keeping ties with the Taliban.\n\n“When it comes to the engagement with the Taliban, we do maintain contact...to allow the dialogue for political priories of the EU and to ensure that the EU can provide support to the Afghan people, and this is very important,” she said at the briefing. “The EU engagement with the Taliban is not an acknowledgement of legitimacy.”\n\nIn addition to saying it was appalled by the August 26 decree, the EU statement called it a “serious blow undermining the rights of Afghan women and girls, which we cannot tolerate.”\n\nThe decree imposes further restrictive dress codes for women and says that voices of women must not be heard in public, “which effectively deprives Afghan women of their fundamental right to freedom of expression,” the EU statement said.\n\nThe European Union said the decree, issued on the third anniversary of a suicide bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport that killed 13 U.S. soldiers and scores of Afghans during the chaotic U.S. withdrawal, also gives the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice a mandate to enforce it.\n\n“This, together with the restrictions imposed, punishable under Taliban law, violates legal obligations and treaties to which Afghanistan is a state party, including by undermining Afghan people’s right to due process,” the EU statement said.\n\nIt also noted that the decree creates another obstacle to normalized relations and recognition by the international community -- goals that the Taliban publicly aspires to.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Kyiv has conducted its first test of a domestically produced ballistic missile as Russia unleashed a second day of deadly strikes on across Ukraine.\n\nZelenskiy also said at a news conference following a forum in Kyiv on August 27 that the war with Russia would eventually end in dialogue, but that Kyiv had to be in a strong position.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nZelenskiy said he hoped to go to the United States in September to attend the UN General Assembly in New York and meet U.S. President Joe Biden and present a plan to end the war. Kyiv's incursion into Russia's Kursk region is part of that plan, but it also includes other steps on the economic and diplomatic fronts, he said.\n\n\"The main point of this plan is to force Russia to end the war,\" he said, adding that he wants it to be fair for Ukraine.\n\nHe did not elaborate on the next steps but said he would also discuss the plan with Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate running for president, and probably also with former U.S. President Donald Trump, the Republican candidate.\n\nHis announcements came as Ukraine has been pleading with its Western allies to remove their ban on Kyiv using weapons they supplied to attack military targets deep inside Russia in order to prevent Moscow's forces from destroying civilian and energy infrastructure.\n\nUkraine has also said it is working on developing the Hrim-2 short-range ballistic missile system, which is designed to combine the features of a tactical missile system and a multiple rocket launcher.\n\nLast weekend Zelenskiy also confirmed the existence of the domestically produced Palianytsia missile, which he called a \"new class\" of weapon for Ukraine.\n\nZelenskiy spoke hours after at least five people were killed and several more were wounded in a second massive drone and missile attack by Russia on Ukraine in as many days.\n\nIn Russia's Kursk, where fighting has been under way since August 6 when Ukrainian forces launched a shock incursion into Russian territory, Rafael Grossi, the chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN nuclear agency, visited the Kurchatov nuclear plant amid fears about the atomic installation's safety.\n\nGrossi said after the visit that there was a risk of \"nuclear incident\" at the plant, where the situation was serious.\n\nThe Kurchatov plant is situated some 60 kilometers from the Ukrainian border on the banks of the Seym River, where there has been heavy fighting for the past three weeks.\n\nSeparately, the Ukrainian military's top commander, General Oleksandr Syrskiy, said that his forces now control 1,294 square kilometers and 100 settlements in Kursk. He also said Ukrainian troops have taken a total of 594 Russian prisoners during the ongoing operation in Kursk.\n\nAs Russia launched another wave of strikes, the Ukrainian Air Force said it had shot down a total of 60 drones and 5 missiles early on August 27.\n\nThe fresh wave of attacks prompted an all-out air-raid alert declared for the whole of Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian aviation expert Valeriy Romanenko told RFE/RL that the recent massive air strikes that Russia has launched are meant to exceed the capabilities of Ukraine's antiaircraft missile systems.\n\nRockets fly in a \"bunch\" and appear to air-defense systems be just one rocket, Romanenko said. The air-defense system launches a single rocket, but there is not one but five or six to shoot down.\n\nRomanenko also pointed out that the Russians are using X-101 missiles, which have a range of almost 5,500 kilometers.\n\n\"The Russians take advantage of this and plan trajectories in such a way as to avoid the positions of antiaircraft missile systems as much as possible,\" he told Current Time, the Russian-language network run by RFE/RL. They also use variations in the terrain where possible, programming the rockets to pass undetected behind hills and other topography and make many turns without losing the target.\n\nIn the latest wave of Russian missiles strikes, a hotel in Kryviy Rih in the southern region of Dnipropetrovsk was hit. Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram that a man and a woman had been killed and five people were wounded.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:00:49 0:00\n\nLocal officials also said that two people had been killed in overnight Russian strikes in the southern region of Zaporizhzhya.\n\nIn the northeastern region of Kharkiv, a Russian missile killed one person and wounded another five, regional Governor Oleh Synyehubov said on Telegram.\n\nIn the Khmelnytskiy region, eight Russian drones were shot down, but a person was wounded during the attack, regional Governor Serhiy Tyurin said on Telegram.\n\nAir defense systems shot down all 15 drones that attacked Kyiv, the administration of the Ukrainian capital said, adding that a fire broke out due to falling debris in a forest park in the city's Dnipro district.\n\nVyacheslav Gladkov, the governor or Russia's Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, claimed early on August 27 that the situation was challenging but manageable in the area amid an attempted incursion by Ukrainian troops.\n\n\"According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the situation on the border remains difficult, but under control. Our military is carrying out planned work. I ask you to remain calm and trust only official sources of information,\" Gladkov wrote on Telegram. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine on Gladkov's claim.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nAt least 4 people were killed while several others were either wounded or missing on August 27 in a second massive drone and missile Russian attack on Ukraine in as many days that included a strike on a hotel in Kryviy Rih, in the southern region of Dnipropetrovsk.\n\nThe fresh wave of attacks came as Rafael Grossi, the chief of the UN nuclear agency, was expected to visit the Russian nuclear plant in Kursk, where fighting has been under way since August 6, when Ukrainian forces launched a shock incursion into Russian territory.\n\nDnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram on August 27 that a man and a woman had been killed in the overnight missile attack on the Kryviy Rih hotel. \"5 were wounded, a 43-year-old woman is in a severe state,\" Lysak said, adding that the fate of two more people was unknown, and they could still be under the rubble.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:00:49 0:00\n\nLysak said that four high-rise buildings and several shops were also damaged in the attack. He said that Nikopol has also come under attack.\n\nLocal officials also said that two people had been killed in overnight Russian strikes in the southern region of Zaporizhzhya.\n\nAir defense systems shot down all 15 drones that attacked Kyiv, the administration of the Ukrainian capital said, adding that a fire broke out due to falling debris in a forest park in the city's Dnipro district.\n\nThe August 27 attack prompted an all-out air-raid alert declared for the whole of Ukraine.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians.

Every leader, every one of our partners, knows the decisive actions required to end this war justly,\" he added, while calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a \"sick creature.\"\n\nThe detention of Pavel Durov, the Russian-born co-founder and CEO of the Telegram messaging app, has been extended by a French investigative judge until August 28 as Moscow expressed outrage over what it said appeared to be \"a direct attempt to restrict freedom of communication.\"\n\nDurov, a billionaire who holds citizenships from Russia, France, the United Arab Emirates, and the Caribbean island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, was detained at Le Bourget airport outside Paris on August 24 and held for questioning. The Paris prosecutor's office said late on August 26 that Durov's detention order was extended for 48 hours, meaning he must be charged or set free by August 28.\n\nFrance's OFMIN, an office tasked with preventing violence against minors, has reportedly issued an arrest warrant for Durov in a preliminary investigation into alleged offenses, including fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, organized crime, and the promotion of terrorism.\n\nTelegram has said that Durov “has nothing to hide” and that it is “awaiting a prompt resolution of this situation.\"\n\nIn Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on August 27 that the allegations against Durov were “very serious” and that “they require evidence that is just as serious” to erase the suspicions of many that the billionaire's arrest was politically motivated.\n\nWithout substantial evidence, \"we are witnessing a direct attempt to restrict freedom of communication and, one might even say, direct intimidation of the head of a large company,” Peskov said.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has tried to allay such suspicion, saying on August 26 that Durov's arrest was solely part of an independent investigation.\n\nIn a post on X, Macron said France “is deeply committed” to freedom of expression but that “freedoms are upheld within a legal framework, both on social media and in real life, to protect citizens and respect their fundamental rights.”\n\nDubai-based Telegram boasts more than 900 million users worldwide.
