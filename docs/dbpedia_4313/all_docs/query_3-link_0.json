        "text": "SMBT-1 versus [3H]-BU99008 and [3H]-l-deprenyl (Autoradiography in AD and CN Brains)\n\nAutoradiograms of large frozen brain sections obtained from one EOAD, one LOAD, and 2 CN subjects demonstrated the regional binding of [3H]-BU99008 and [3H]-l-deprenyl (total binding) as illustrated in and , respectively. The autoradiograms in showed that 1 μM non-radiolabeled SMBT-1 only partly displaced the [3H]-BU99008 binding in AD (both EOAD and LOAD) cortical brain regions, while 1 μM non-radiolabeled SMBT-1 completely displaced the [3H]-l-deprenyl binding in the AD cortical regions (both EOAD and LOAD), indicating that SMBT-1 and deprenyl seem to compete for the same binding site on MAO-B ( ).\n\nAs illustrated in for CN subjects, coincubation of 1 μM SMBT-1 with [3H]-BU99008 only partly displaced the [3H]-BU99008 binding in the cortical regions, while [3H]-l-deprenyl completely displaced the [3H]-l-deprenyl binding. The competition data between 1 μM SMBT-1 versus [3H]-BU99008 suggest a potential interaction between them, although to a lesser extent, than with [3H]-l-deprenyl. Semiquantitative analyses (Table 2) of the young CN large brain sections indicated that SMBT-1 displaced 53% in the temporal cortex and 56% in the frontal cortex. Similarly, in EOAD large brain sections, the displacement was comparable as SMBT-1 displaced 43% of [3H]-BU99008 binding in the temporal lobe and 55% in the frontal lobe (compare with ).\n\nDetecting early brain pathological changes using PET imaging is fundamental to improving AD diagnosis. Over recent decades, a lot of attention has been given to the involvement of glial cells, especially astrocytes, in the early stages of AD. Astrocytes are now considered one of the first brain cells to respond to AD pathology via a phenomenon termed reactive astrogliosis.15−17 Following our studies proposing “two waves of reactive astrogliosis” in the AD continuum (see review26), immense effort has been directed toward identification and development of novel PET tracers that could improve our understanding of the role of reactive astrocytes in AD pathogenesis. In this context, [11C]-deuterium-l-deprenyl and [11C]-BU99008, which, respectively, detect overexpression of MAO-B and I2Bs in reactive astrocytes, exemplify two available PET radiotracers that image/map reactive astrogliosis in vivo.16,27 The recently developed [18F]-SMBT-1, which also targets MAO-B with high selectivity, has shown potential as a new surrogate marker for reactive astrogliosis in the AD continuum.22 However, a direct evaluation in terms of binding behavior/mechanism between these PET radiotracers in AD and CN brains was still lacking.\n\nIncreased MAO-B activity in AD was initially observed and reported four decades ago, in association with brain regions prone to amyloidosis.9 The correlation between higher MAO-B levels and reactive astrocytes was later demonstrated by different groups using [3H]-l-deprenyl and histological analyses of postmortem brain tissue.10,28 Carbon-11 radiolabeling of l-deprenyl allowed reactive astrocytes to be imaged in living individuals.16,29 [11C]-deuterium-l-deprenyl PET demonstrated higher binding in patients with mild cognitive impairment or presymptomatic autosomal-dominant AD (compared to CN individuals), suggesting that reactive astrogliosis is an early phenomenon in the AD continuum.15−17 An increased MAO-B activity has also been demonstrated by [11C]-deuterium-l-deprenyl PET in the physiological aging of normal healthy individuals (35). In a recent cross-sectional study, high [18F]-SMBT-1 binding has been demonstrated in regions linked with early amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in AD patients and Aβ+ CN subjects.22 To examine SMBT-1 binding behavior and its interaction with [3H]-l-deprenyl binding sites, we undertook competition binding assays using a very broad concentration range of non-radiolabeled SMBT-1 (10–15–10–5 M) against [3H]-l-deprenyl in brain homogenates from the temporal and frontal cortices of AD and CN brains. We observed very similar displacement curve patterns, with one binding site (in the nanomolar range) in both analyzed brain regions of AD and CN brains. These findings correlated very well with our previous competition studies in temporal cortex brain homogenates with [3H]-l-deprenyl versus non-radiolabeled l-deprenyl, where we also observed one binding site (with nanomolar affinity) in both AD and CN brains.19 Furthermore, in this work, we have demonstrated, using large frozen hemisphere section autoradiography studies of AD postmortem brain tissue, that [3H]-l-deprenyl binding is completely displaced/abolished by micromolar concentrations of SMBT-1 in the cortical regions. These findings clearly suggest that l-deprenyl and SMBT-1 selectively compete for the same site (i.e., MAO-B) on reactive astrocytes. Our results are in line with those of Harada et al., who used small brain section autoradiography to show that [18F]-SMBT-1 binding was fully displaced by the non-radiolabeled selective MAO-B inhibitor lazabemide.24\n\nThe I2B-selective PET tracer [11C]-BU99008 is another potential tool for exploring different astrocytic states and reactive astrogliosis. Increased I2B density, which is often observed in astrocytes, is associated with GFAP upregulation and reactive astrogliosis in AD.20 We have previously demonstrated that [3H]-BU99008 can visualize reactive astrogliosis and detect multiple binding sites in AD brains.19 We have also reported that the binding behavior of [3H]-l-deprenyl is different from that of [3H]-BU99008 and that they might be targeting distinct astrocytic subpopulations or states. Consequently, we decided to investigate the binding behavior of SMBT-1 in the context of [3H]-BU99008, as we have previously done for l-deprenyl versus [3H]-BU99008.19 Competition radioligand assays in brain homogenates revealed that SMBT-1 could also interact with [3H]-BU99008 at two binding sites with varying affinities in the frontal and temporal cortices of both the AD and CN brains. The binding affinities ranged from picomolar to nanomolar, and the total binding displacement was ∼50%. These results corroborate our previous findings, where l-deprenyl also interacted with [3H]-BU99008 at multiple binding sites with pico- and micromolar affinities.19 The autoradiograms of large sections of AD brain tissue provided complementary data into the interaction between SMBT-1 and [3H]-BU99008 binding sites and indicated displacement of [3H]-BU99008 binding in both frontal and temporal lobes in a similar extent to that observed in the brain homogenate studies (43–56%). Remarkably, the proportional displacement of [3H]-BU99008 by SMBT-1 in competition studies differed between the frontal and temporal cortices. These changes in the proportion of binding could be attributed to the existence of I2Bs in the catalytic site of MAO-B30 and, to some extent, to conformational changes in the protein structure, perhaps pathologically induced and in specific regions of the brain. A detailed crystallography analysis led by Bonivento and colleagues31 showed that tranylcypromine (an irreversible MAO-B inhibitor) induces conformational changes in the enzyme, leading to the formation of a high-affinity I2B.31 In this context, it is possible that the nanomolar high affinity site detected by SMBT-1 could be the I2B for [3H]-BU99008 binding in reactive astrocytes.19 Similarly, we also observed the existence of a binding site in the picomolar range (superhigh affinity). The interaction at the picomolar site agrees with our previous findings and conclusions: the existence of an MAO-B site to which BU99008 can bind and be blocked with MAO inhibitors.19 In our competition studies using non-radiolabeled SMBT-1 concentrations in the range of 10–12–10–5 M with [3H]-BU99008, we observed, in addition to a superhigh and high affinity site, a third low affinity site in the micromolar range in both the analyzed regions. This low affinity site most probably could represent a nonspecific binding of SMBT-1 binding to additional non-MAO binding sites for BU99008 and, hence, of no interest in PET studies.\n\nThese results show that subtle alterations in the biological milieu can affect the MAO-B conformation and, consequently, the number of available sites and the ligand binding affinity. In addition, the regional differences observed suggest that dynamic changes in the [3H]-BU99008 binding sites in the pico- and nanomolar affinity ranges could also be dependent on the brain region. However, these observations/conclusions need further exploration. If we look from a broader perspective, these differences in tracer binding resulting from different astrocytic subtypes or states could be a benefit in disguise as a multi-PET approach with different astrocytic tracers could be employed to deepen our understanding of astrocytic heterogeneity in the AD continuum. The changes in MAO-B activity measured by different PET tracers in vivo in AD might represent defense mechanisms aimed at modulating neuronal excitability by increasing tonic glial GABA inhibition.32\n\nOur studies have some limitations: first, the binding studies were performed on a small number of cases and a follow-up study in a large cohort of AD cases would be interesting to further validate the potential and binding characteristics of SMBT-1 in relation to l-deprenyl and BU99008. However, despite this limitation, the findings presented here clearly justify the aims of this explorative study. Second, caution should be exercised when directly comparing the results of different autoradiography studies as the large frozen brain sections could be from different coronal anatomical levels and may have scarring in some regions. Overall, our findings have shown that SMBT-1 behaves like l-deprenyl and that it could target MAO-B with high selectivity in AD brains. Moreover, SMBT-1 could also interact with BU99008 at multiple binding sites, possibly with different outcomes in AD and CN brains."
