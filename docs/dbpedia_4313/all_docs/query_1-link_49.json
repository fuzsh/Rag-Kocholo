Case studies of alternative models for environmental initiatives in architectural and urban practices are explored to contest a historical narrative of environmental activism that claims it is underpinned by Western democratic political conditions. The research is based on a comparative analysis of documents and period sources about the activities, which ranged from self-organized exhibitions to architecture and urban-design competitions. Thus, the article examines how these strategies of environmental mobilization contributed to shifts in the highly formalized politics of urban planning prevalent at that time. This article therefore examines political and cultural factors, as well as the dynamics underpinning dialogues, critiques, and collaborative practices as part of a general movement to humanize the transition as a condition of the late-socialist society. This article challenges conventional models of interpreting relations between local and global architectural culture by bringing its multilayered transfers under the spotlight.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\n2At the same time, many cases that require an interdisciplinary approach grounded in the cultural history of architecture, anthropology, sociology, and media studies remain inadequately researched. One typical example is the discussion of issues related to the urban environment during the democratization of Yugoslav society in the 1970s and 1980s, where the concept of the environment was in use as of the early 1970s, yet with a variety of meanings. These ranged from references to the general principle of shaping the human domain and experimental models of architectural education, to ideas of environmental science and the increasingly popular awareness for the need to protect natural ecosystems as important resources promoting life quality.\n\n3This article will consider the idea of the environment as a starting point for an alternative historiography of socialist modernism, and will explore the key roles of the mediators in affirming a social awareness of the quality of environment in order to achieve this. This article argues that, by investigating the actors and the political, social, and theoretical aspects of discussions about the environment, we can explain differences present in global modernizing processes. Nevertheless, the environment is both a theoretical and historical concept and a construct influenced by social and political processes. While state-control mechanisms did not permit radical forms of activism in Yugoslavia, the democratization of society from the 1970s onward was visible in a dynamic wherein citizen associations engaged in (self-)organized actions that articulated their dissatisfaction with the dearth of official policies linked to environmental protection.\n\n5This article analyzes the activities of the Center for Urban Development Planning (CEP) as part of the ecologically aware culture of environmental design in the 1970s and 1980s. It highlights specific features of its politically and socially engaged position in late socialism. Here, the concept of activism is used to refer to the field and methods of actions that formed strategies for professional and academic communication in a manner deemed politically acceptable in the socialist system when open protest was not possible. These strategies, however, relied on more radical models such as situationism. This article takes a transdisciplinary approach to the history of environmentalism, considering the context of networking, critical thinking, debate, dialogue and collaborative practices crucial for affirming new forms of action (in the field of urban planning) that focused on the protection and quality of the built and natural environment. The alternative position assumes a critique of the model of self-managing socialism, as affected by the crisis, and an awareness that the development of industry does not only lead to modernization and advancement, but also to the devastation of the natural and built environment.\n\n6Furthermore, this article places special emphasis on the dynamics of the CEP participants’ networking in order to consolidate a socially engaged awareness of the environment. Strategies ranging from spontaneous actions, exhibitions, site-specific interventions, to architectural and urban design competitions and experimental models of architectural education are considered. The broader aim is to argue that these practices initiated changes in the politics of urban planning that were of great importance at that time.\n\nThe Social and Political Context of Environmentalism in Yugoslavia During the 1970s and 1980s\n\nEnvironmentalism as an Alternative Practice in Socialist Yugoslavia’s Architectural Culture\n\n15The CEP’s protagonists, who mediated dynamic transfers of architectural ideas, were young architecture graduates from the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Belgrade. These graduates had trained professionally at international schools or studios. Đorđe Bobić (b. 1939) worked in architectural offices in Paris from 1965 till 1968, while Miša David (1942–2000), one of the pioneers of participative urban planning in former Yugoslavia, attended a specialist course at the Centre for Environmental Studies in London in 1972. There was also Miodrag Ferenčak (b. 1943), who studied at the University of Baltimore’s Center for Metropolitan Studies, while Miloš Bobić (1946–2007) attended the summer session at the Architectural Association in London in 1971.\n\n16In his role as a professor at the Faculty of Architecture in Belgrade, Bogdan Bogdanović had a decisive influence on his students’ ideas, and later on members of the CEP with whom he collaborated, including Bobić. He had introduced the concept of urbanology, which sought to challenge conventional approaches to urban planning, defining it as form of free thinking about the city, beyond the constraints of utilitarian urbanism. His approach was based on the thesis that spatial thinking establishes a new system of signs by situating them with regard to one another in contemporary spatial relations.\n\n17As a professor of urban planning and as the mayor of Belgrade (1982–1986), Bogdanović advocated models of urban planning based on a holistic, all-encompassing, nonhierarchical approach to the city, which opposed the then current formalist urban policy in Yugoslavia. Despite support from the leading representatives of the Communist party, he constantly faced conflicts and misunderstandings with lower-level politicians. Yet political conflicts strengthened his authority by expanding the field of architectural, urban, and educational practice, including Bogdanović’s intensive participation in activities organized by the CEP. A characteristic example of bottom-up practice was the workshop “For Belgrade, Here and Now” (1982), initiated by Bogdanović and organized by the CEP. It aimed to revitalize neglected and devastated parts of the city. The workshop contributed to expanding the field of the participatory, self-organized production of urban space.\n\n19Since 1976, the CEP has organized Communications each May, which consist of a series of conferences where urban planners and architects from all the (former) Yugoslavian countries meet in the Cvijeta Zuzorić Pavilion in Belgrade. They aim to rethink urban planning and develop alternative ways of communicating and interacting with the public (Fig. 1).\n\n25The first prize went to Wild Pigs on the Run Present: Living with Nature by the Slovenian architecture students Aljoša Kolenc and Matjaž Požlep. It referenced Orwell’s cautionary tale by evoking a song from the album Animals by the psychedelic rock group Pink Floyd (Fig. 3).\n\nSource: The bulletin Communication, N° 23, January 1984\n\nConclusion\n\n36In summary, by opening up a discourse on participatory practices of environmental mobilization in the 1970s and 1980s, this article has examined the CEP’s mediating role in the democratization of decision-making on key political issues. The CEP’s fascinating activities, which were ahead of their time in the 1980s, sadly remain part of the disputed and ignored intellectual heritage identified with the former political system. Under the current neoliberal circumstances, the former Yugoslav space is paradoxically increasingly distanced from projective tendencies toward including social and ecological awareness in contemporary architectural culture."
