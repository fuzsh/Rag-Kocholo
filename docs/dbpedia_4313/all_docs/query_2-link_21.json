Please call the case.\n\n6 THE REGISTRAR: Good morning. Case number IT-95-9-T, the\n\n7 Prosecutor versus Blagoje Simic, Miroslav Tadic, and Simo Zaric.\n\n8 JUDGE MUMBA: Yes, Mr. Pisarevic. Yes. You're going to call your\n\n9 client, Mr. Simo Zaric.\n\n10 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Yes, certainly, Your Honour. But\n\n11 I thought that before that, some questions would be raised. But if not, I\n\n12 would like to call Mr. Simo Zaric to take the witness stand before this\n\n13 Tribunal.\n\n14 JUDGE MUMBA: Yes, Mr. Zaric. Please make the solemn\n\n15 declaration.\n\n16 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I solemnly declare that I will speak\n\n17 the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.\n\n18 WITNESS: SIMO ZARIC\n\n19 [Witness answered through interpreter]\n\n20 JUDGE MUMBA: Thank you. Please sit down.\n\n21 Yes, you can start.\n\n22 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Good morning, Your Honours.\n\n23 Examined by Mr. Pisarevic:\n\n24 Q. [Interpretation] Good morning, Mr. Zaric.\n\n25 A. Yes. Good morning.\n\nPage 19023\n\n1 Q. When we were preparing you for your testimony, we were speaking\n\n2 about the technical details of your testimony. That's why I'm not going\n\n3 to give you any particular instructions. However, I would like to ask you\n\n4 that if you find yourself in a situation that you don't hear something or\n\n5 that something doesn't function, please let me know and then we will\n\n6 repeat the question and we will resolve the issue.\n\n7 Mr. Zaric, tell us, please, for the record, your name, your first\n\n8 name and your last name.\n\n9 A. My name is Simo Zaric.\n\n10 Q. Mr. Zaric, do you have a nickname?\n\n11 A. Yes.\n\n12 Q. What is that?\n\n13 A. Solaja.\n\n14 Q. What is the meaning of that nickname? Who were you nicknamed\n\n15 after?\n\n16 A. I got this nickname -- I was nicknamed after a war hero [Realtime\n\n17 transcript read in error \"herey'] from the Second World War, Simela Solaja\n\n18 from the area of Kozara. They called me Simela as a term of endearment.\n\n19 And then I got this nickname, Solaja, which became an integral part of my\n\n20 first and last name.\n\n21 Q. Did your fellow citizens know you by that nickname?\n\n22 A. Yes, many of my fellow citizens knew me by that nickname, and the\n\n23 majority of my acquaintances addressed me by that nickname.\n\n24 MR. LAZAREVIC: Just one small correction on page 2, line 16.\n\n25 It's a war hero. Here it says \"herey.\"\n\nPage 19024\n\n1 JUDGE MUMBA: Yes. It will be corrected.\n\n2 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation].\n\n3 Q. When were you born?\n\n4 A. I was born on 25 July, 1948.\n\n5 Q. Where were you born?\n\n6 A. The name of my village is Trnjak Zorice in the area of Odzak\n\n7 municipality in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n8 Q. Your native village is called Trnjak Zorice. Can you tell us\n\n9 something about its ethnic composition?\n\n10 A. It is of mixed ethnic composition, inhabited by Croats and\n\n11 Muslims -- sorry, Serbs. And I would like to say that there is an equal\n\n12 ratio of Croats and Serbs residing in that village.\n\n13 Q. Where and when did you complete your elementary education?\n\n14 A. The first four grades of the elementary school I completed in\n\n15 Zorice, in my native village, and the second part of elementary education\n\n16 I completed in Bosanski Samac.\n\n17 Q. And where did you attend secondary school, and which school was\n\n18 that?\n\n19 A. I attended the second school for economics in Bosanski Samac, and\n\n20 it was between 1963 and 1967.\n\n21 Q. Mr. Zaric, how long did you reside in Trnjak Zorice village? Up\n\n22 to when?\n\n23 A. I resided there up to 1969.\n\n24 Q. And where did you reside from 1969?\n\n25 A. Since 1969, up to this day, save for the five or six years that I\n\nPage 19025\n\n1 spent here in The Hague, I've resided in Bosanski Samac.\n\n2 Q. Where did you find your first employment?\n\n3 A. I found my first employment in a state-owned company called\n\n4 Bosanka. It is a trading company where I started to work on the 15th of\n\n5 May, 1969. I stayed there until 15 May, 1975.\n\n6 Q. Thank you. What duties did you discharge in that trading company\n\n7 called Bosanka?\n\n8 A. I first started as an intern in the sales. I was calculating the\n\n9 prices. And then, in 1973, I obtained my degree from the higher school of\n\n10 economics. I became the financial director of that company and I\n\n11 discharged the duties of the financial director of that trading company\n\n12 for two years before I left the company and joined another company.\n\n13 Q. Tell us, please: When was it that you graduated from the school\n\n14 of economics, and where was that?\n\n15 A. First, I graduated from a higher school of economics in 1973, and\n\n16 then I obtained a full degree in economics, and that was on the 18th of\n\n17 December, 1979, from the school of economics in Brcko.\n\n18 Q. Thank you very much. If you could just slow down a little bit for\n\n19 the interpreters.\n\n20 When did you become the chief of SUP in Bosanski Samac?\n\n21 A. I became the chief of SUP on the 15th of May, 1975.\n\n22 Q. And how long did you stay in that post, in the post of the chief\n\n23 of SUP in Bosanski Samac?\n\n24 A. Up to the 1st of August, 1979. A little over four years.\n\n25 Q. After the expiry of that mandate, after the end of your term,\n\nPage 19026\n\n1 where did you continue your professional career after that? What did you\n\n2 do?\n\n3 A. After the job of the chief of SUP, I applied for the job of the\n\n4 director of the Buducnost company, and I was given that job and I started\n\n5 working on the 1st of August, 1979. Buducnost is a manufacturing company\n\n6 which produces upholstered and other types of furniture, and it had 1.000\n\n7 employees.\n\n8 Q. That company, Buducnost, was it a part of some system in\n\n9 Bosnia-Herzegovina, a system of companies, of associated companies?\n\n10 A. Yes. Buducnost was part of -- one of the largest corporations at\n\n11 the time in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the name of that corporation was\n\n12 Sipad and it was based in Sarajevo. And let me just tell you that there\n\n13 were 52 manufacturing companies, members of that corporation, and those\n\n14 were furniture companies. Besides that, that company also had forests and\n\n15 it had mills and timber processing companies. It was one of the major\n\n16 companies in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time.\n\n17 Q. Mr. Zaric, how long did you remain the director of the Buducnost\n\n18 company?\n\n19 A. I stayed there in that job until 1992.\n\n20 THE INTERPRETER: Interpreter's correction. In 1982.\n\n21 A. And then in 1982, I was appointed the director of the\n\n22 representative office of that company in Belgrade for the area of Serbia\n\n23 and two autonomous provinces, that is, Kosovo and Vojvodina. I stayed in\n\n24 that job in Belgrade and I mostly engaged in the sale of furniture\n\n25 produced in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the marketplace where I operated\n\nPage 19027\n\n1 was Serbia, with its two autonomous provinces, Kosovo and Vojvodina.\n\n2 Q. Thank you very much, Mr. Zaric. Again, can you please slow down\n\n3 in giving your answers. How long did you stay in that job, in the job of\n\n4 the representative of the Sipad corporation in Belgrade?\n\n5 A. I stayed in that job until the 31st of January, 1985. Then I\n\n6 returned to Bosnia and Herzegovina for family reasons, and from 31st\n\n7 January 1985, I started working in the sector of the State Security\n\n8 Centre.\n\n9 Q. Mr. Zaric, please just answer my questions and we will answer\n\n10 other questions at a later stage.\n\n11 While you were in Belgrade, where was your family residing at that\n\n12 time?\n\n13 A. While I was working in Belgrade, my family resided in Bosanski\n\n14 Samac.\n\n15 Q. How often did you visit your family? How often did you go home?\n\n16 A. Every weekend I would take the business train to see my family.\n\n17 There would hardly be a weekend when I didn't go to Bosanski Samac. And\n\n18 sometimes I would also visit my family when business took me to Bosnia and\n\n19 Herzegovina, when I paid visits to the furniture companies whose products\n\n20 I sold on the marketplace in Serbia.\n\n21 Q. A little while ago you mentioned that you left the job in Belgrade\n\n22 for family reasons. What family reasons were those? Why did you return\n\n23 from Belgrade to Bosnia and Herzegovina?\n\n24 A. In January 1982, my father, Mirko, had a stroke. He became\n\n25 severely ill, and that was the only reason for which I returned. I wanted\n\nPage 19028\n\n1 to help my mother look after him. My sisters were all married and they\n\n2 could not dedicate so much time to my father. And I, as his only son,\n\n3 decided to do that. I had a lot of emotional reasons to help my father.\n\n4 Unfortunately, my father lived like that for eight years. But I never\n\n5 regret going back home. Although, if that had not happened, my life would\n\n6 have looked differently and I would have never ended up in The Hague.\n\n7 Q. Where did your mother and father reside? Did they have some\n\n8 property there?\n\n9 A. My mother and father resided in Trnjak. We had one of the best\n\n10 farms in that village. And when I say one of the best, then I would like\n\n11 to say that this farm was so well known because we had one of the largest\n\n12 orchards in that area. We had over 300 trees of different fruit. And\n\n13 every time when I had time, I would go there to help them work on that\n\n14 farm. So they indeed reside on a farm in Trnjak.\n\n15 Q. Were they farmers then?\n\n16 A. Yes.\n\n17 Q. When you returned from Belgrade, where did you find employment?\n\n18 A. When I returned from Belgrade, my first job was in Doboj. I\n\n19 worked in the sector of the State Security Centre for a year. I was an\n\n20 inspector. That sector of the state security centre was linked to the\n\n21 Security Services Centre in Doboj and its Superior Command was the\n\n22 Ministry of the Interior of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n23 Q. Thank you. While you were working in Doboj, did you also reside\n\n24 in Doboj?\n\n25 A. No. While I worked in Doboj, I had a temporary residence there,\n\nPage 19029\n\n1 and every weekend I would go back to the area of Samac. I would go back\n\n2 to my family.\n\n3 Q. Thank you. Mr. Zaric, after a certain period of time, was a\n\n4 detachment of the State Security Centre established in the town of\n\n5 Modrica?\n\n6 A. The detachment of the State Security Centre was established even\n\n7 before I became the chief. But in February 1986, pursuant to the decision\n\n8 of the Ministry of the Interior, Mr. Dusko Zgonjanin, I was transferred\n\n9 and I became the chief of the detachment of the State Security Centre, and\n\n10 this detachment at that time covered the area of three municipalities.\n\n11 Those were the municipalities of Modrica, Bosanski Samac, and Odzak.\n\n12 Q. Thank you. Did you move to Modrica with your family?\n\n13 A. No. My family remained in Samac. I commuted to Modrica every day\n\n14 because the distance between Samac and Modrica is 20 kilometres.\n\n15 Q. Thank you. Mr. Zaric, could you explain to the Chamber the\n\n16 structure of the state security at that time and how it functioned.\n\n17 A. The state security service started with the Ministry of the\n\n18 Interior in Sarajevo. There were two sectors there. One of them was the\n\n19 sector of state security, and the other was the sector of public security.\n\n20 The Ministry of the Interior coordinated the work of both of these\n\n21 services. The chief of the state security was the undersecretary of the\n\n22 state security. So that was the first person in the Ministry of the\n\n23 Interior, reporting directly to the minister and who was in charge of the\n\n24 organisation of that service and who managed that service.\n\n25 The second down the hierarchy were centres for state security, and\n\nPage 19030\n\n1 they were organised in various regions. They also had a similar division.\n\n2 They also had two sectors. One was the state security and the other was\n\n3 the public security sector. The head of the regional centres were chiefs,\n\n4 and each of the respective sectors had their superior.\n\n5 And the third, or the lowest step in that organisational ladder\n\n6 were detachments, and this is precisely where I worked. A detachment\n\n7 would cover some microregions, and there were many more detachments than\n\n8 state security centres. I personally was in the Modrica detachment, which\n\n9 covered three municipalities. There was also a detachment in Derventa,\n\n10 which covered some other municipalities, and so on and so forth.\n\n11 Q. Thank you very much, Mr. Zaric. You have explained the structure\n\n12 to us. What were your concrete tasks as the chief of the detachment in\n\n13 Modrica, and what were your authorities?\n\n14 A. The state security service is a very specific service. It\n\n15 collects intelligence along various lines of work. When I say that, then\n\n16 I mean that one line of work was collecting intelligence relative to the\n\n17 counter-intelligence of foreign intelligence services in the area of the\n\n18 former Bosnia and Herzegovina and the former Yugoslavia, because the state\n\n19 security service was linked up to the service at the federal level.\n\n20 The second line of work was collection of information on the\n\n21 Chetnik Ustasha, and Muslim emigration [Realtime transcript read in error\n\n22 \"immigration\"] in the diaspora, abroad, not residing in the former\n\n23 Yugoslavia. And the third line of work was collection on intelligence on\n\n24 the activities of the internal forces which jeopardised the constitutional\n\n25 order of the country. The fourth line of work was, for example, the\n\nPage 19031\n\n1 collection of intelligence on significant, vital facilities of particular\n\n2 significance for the state and protection of the most important persons in\n\n3 the area of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the former Yugoslavia.\n\n4 So those were the lines of work that we carried out, and the task\n\n5 of the state security service was to collect intelligence about all these\n\n6 things, and people were specialised in different types of work:\n\n7 MR. RE: Can I just clarify something for the transcript? It\n\n8 reads, at line 20 on page 9: \"Chetnik, Ustasha, and Muslim immigration in\n\n9 the diaspora.\" I think it should be emigration, e-m-i-g-r-a-t-i-o-n,\n\n10 rather than immigration. Going out rather than coming in. Perhaps that\n\n11 could be clarified or corrected.\n\n12 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation].\n\n13 Q. Mr. Zaric, you said emigration, didn't you?\n\n14 A. Correct. Emigration was the word.\n\n15 Q. You, as the chief of the detachment in Modrica, if you received\n\n16 some intelligence or if you collected some intelligence, what did you do\n\n17 with that information, with that intelligence? Who did you send reports\n\n18 to about the intelligence that you gathered or obtained?\n\n19 A. In order to gain a clear picture on the size of the detachment, I\n\n20 would like to say that I had five more people working with me in that\n\n21 detachment, and our main task was to collect the so-called initial\n\n22 information at that microregion, and to transform them into the initial\n\n23 official records. I, as the chief of the service, would inspect all those\n\n24 reports. I would certify and sign those reports and I would then forward\n\n25 those reports to the sector in Doboj. As I did that, this completed our\n\nPage 19032\n\n1 operational task.\n\n2 Q. Thank you. Mr. Zaric, do you remember, while you were the chief\n\n3 of the detachment, do you remember who your immediate superiors were, both\n\n4 at the regional and the republican level?\n\n5 A. Upon arriving in the service, upon joining the service, the\n\n6 republican secretary was Mr. Mato Andric. He was a Croat. And the head,\n\n7 the chief of state security at the time, was Dusko Zgonjanin. In the\n\n8 centre in Doboj, when I arrived there, the chief of the security centre\n\n9 was Bogdan Nikolic, and the chief of the state security sector was\n\n10 Marko Brezanic.\n\n11 Just before I retired, and following the multiparty elections, the\n\n12 entire leadership was changed. So my immediate officer just before I\n\n13 retired in the state security sector in Doboj was Ilija Bilic from the\n\n14 HDZ, the Croatian Democratic Alliance. And the chief of the centre was\n\n15 Andrija Bilosevic from the Serbian Democratic Party. He had been\n\n16 appointed as chief so I had, so to speak, two leadership teams. The first\n\n17 one when I arrived there and the second one when I left.\n\n18 Q. Mr. Zaric, can you just tell us up until which year you worked in\n\n19 the state security service?\n\n20 A. Up until the 1st of October, 1991.\n\n21 Q. Mr. Zaric, why did you stop working in the SDB, in the state\n\n22 security service?\n\n23 A. Well, it's a long story. I'll try and summarise the basic facts.\n\n24 After the multiparty elections, and when the national and nationalistic\n\n25 parties assumed power, the leaders in the organs of internal affairs were\n\nPage 19033\n\n1 changed. The minister of the interior -- as minister of the interior,\n\n2 Alija Delimustafic was appointed to this post. And as I said earlier on,\n\n3 I've already said what sort of changes occurred in the Doboj centre, which\n\n4 is where my -- which is -- which was my -- the institution that was above\n\n5 me, that I was subordinated to. With a certain number of colleagues in\n\n6 the SDB, in the state security service, I reacted very critically with\n\n7 regard to certain negative appearances that one could notice at the time,\n\n8 and that exerted an influence on the political gulf between the people in\n\n9 Bosnia and Herzegovina, the peoples in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and this\n\n10 complicated the security and political situation. And I wasn't much loved\n\n11 as a leader, given the positions that I held. So on the 1st of October,\n\n12 in the course of the night, I and five of my colleagues of Serbian\n\n13 nationality, and a colleague of Muslim nationality, were retired.\n\n14 Q. Thank you, Mr. Zaric. When you retired, how old were you?\n\n15 A. When I was retired, I was 44 years old.\n\n16 Q. Thank you. The fact that you weren't a member of one of the\n\n17 national parties that won the elections, did that have any influence on\n\n18 your premature retirement?\n\n19 A. That was the main reason.\n\n20 Q. Thank you. Mr. Zaric, we will now turn to your family background.\n\n21 Could you tell this Trial Chamber when you married for the first time.\n\n22 A. Well, that part of my curriculum is not the most positive aspect\n\n23 that I could display, but I married in 1969 for the first time, when I\n\n24 came back from the JNA, the Yugoslav People's Army.\n\n25 Q. What was your wife's nationality?\n\nPage 19034\n\n1 A. My first wife was called Milka. She came from a mixed marriage.\n\n2 Her father was a Serb and her mother was a Croat. And I had a daughter,\n\n3 whose name is Natasa, with my wife Milka.\n\n4 Q. Thank you. After you got divorced from Milka, to whom your\n\n5 daughter Natasa was given for education, she was appointed as her guardian\n\n6 by the court --\n\n7 A. Well, perhaps it's not modest to say so, but at the time, Natasa,\n\n8 who hadn't even started walking at the time, was appointed to me, to the\n\n9 father, as her guardian. I won't go into the reasons. This is a private\n\n10 matter. But what I've said is sufficient.\n\n11 Q. Thank you. Mr. Zaric, when did you get married for the second\n\n12 time? You don't have to mention the name. Just say what nationality your\n\n13 second wife was.\n\n14 A. In 1972 I got married for the second time. I married a woman who\n\n15 was of Croatian nationality.\n\n16 Q. Did you have any children with that -- with your second wife?\n\n17 A. No, I didn't.\n\n18 Q. When did you get married for the third time?\n\n19 A. It was on the 12th of January, 1974 that I got married for the\n\n20 third time. My third wife's name is Fatima, and she testified before this\n\n21 Tribunal quite recently.\n\n22 Q. Her name is Topcagic, isn't that right?\n\n23 A. Yes. And I had a son, Mirel [Realtime transcript read in error\n\n24 \"Miro\"] with her, and my wife was married before. And when we got\n\n25 married, she already had a son called Denis. So that Fatima and I fed\n\nPage 19035\n\n1 three children. We had three children to feed. I'm not joking when I say\n\n2 that it was my child and her child, and our child. But in fact these are\n\n3 our lovely children.\n\n4 Q. Thank you, Zaric. Just a minute.\n\n5 MR. LAZAREVIC: [Previous translation continues]... Page 13, line\n\n6 22. It's Mirel, the name of Mr. Zaric's son. Nor Miro, it's Mirel,\n\n7 M-I-R-E-L.\n\n8 JUDGE MUMBA: Yes. I think we've heard this detail before. Thank\n\n9 you.\n\n10 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation].\n\n11 Q. And you still live with Mrs. Fatima, with your third wife; isn't\n\n12 that correct, Mr. Zaric?\n\n13 A. Yes, it is.\n\n14 Q. Mr. Zaric, tell us: Since when has your family, Zaric, lived in\n\n15 the Trnjak Zorice village, and when did they arrive in that area?\n\n16 A. The Zaric family, I think it's one of the oldest families in that\n\n17 area, they arrived in Trnjak in 1870, from the area of Uzice in Serbia.\n\n18 They arrived in the Posavina area. And from that date to this very day,\n\n19 they live in a village. I'm the only one who is here where I am.\n\n20 Q. Thank you, Mr. Zaric. Could you please tell us now, could you\n\n21 tell this Honourable Trial Chamber: What happened to your family, to the\n\n22 Zaric family, and to other Serbian families, in the area of Trnjak Zorice\n\n23 in December 1944?\n\n24 A. Well, that's the most tragic part of my family's history, without\n\n25 a doubt.\n\nPage 19036\n\n1 JUDGE MUMBA: Yes, Mr. Pisarevic. I don't understand why we need\n\n2 these details, 1944. I don't think they are relevant to the case. I\n\n3 think we've had enough personal history of Mr. Zaric. Can we proceed with\n\n4 the current issues rather than going back to 1944.\n\n5 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Your Honour, why did I put this\n\n6 question? Well, above all, because part of this story appears in the\n\n7 interview that Mr. Zaric gave to OTP investigators, and it is for this\n\n8 reason that I thought that it would be reasonable, logical, for Mr. Zaric\n\n9 to tell this Trial Chamber what happened. And secondly, given the nature\n\n10 of the charges levelled against Mr. Zaric, I think that it is of great\n\n11 significance, and it should be, it should be of great significance. It\n\n12 would be significant to know, in addition to the tragedy of the Zaric\n\n13 family, the members of the Zaric family mustered the strength to forgive\n\n14 and to live and to have children with members of other ethnic groups,\n\n15 other nationalities, all the more so given that Mr. Zaric is charged with\n\n16 having committed certain acts on the basis of discrimination. But if the\n\n17 Trial Chamber is aware of these facts, I'm quite prepared to move on to\n\n18 other matters. I just wanted Mr. Zaric to inform us about this briefly.\n\n19 JUDGE MUMBA: Yes. Perhaps very briefly, Mr. Zaric can go ahead.\n\n20 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Thank you, Your Honour.\n\n21 Q. Mr. Zaric, could you please try to provide us with the main\n\n22 details about that event, very briefly.\n\n23 A. As I said, that is the most tragic part of my family's story. On\n\n24 the 7th of December, 1944, in the course of the Second World War, 601\n\n25 Serbs - women, children, old people - they were killed in that village.\n\nPage 19037\n\n1 In the house of my father, Mirko, on that day, 242 people were killed,\n\n2 including two of his sons and three daughters, his mother, his wife, and\n\n3 two sisters, and other relatives, some of his other relatives. One of his\n\n4 sons at the time, his name was Simo -- well, I'm here for biological\n\n5 reasons. His father is -- married my mother and had four children. That\n\n6 was his second marriage. And then he called me after one of his sons who\n\n7 was killed on that day. As far as my mother is concerned, who married my\n\n8 father, she suffered a similar tragic fate as my father did. She lived in\n\n9 Donja Dubica. She got married there. Her husband and her entire family\n\n10 from Klakar, that's a village in the area of the municipality of Brod,\n\n11 they were taken to Jasenovac, where they were all killed. The two of them\n\n12 who remained, who survived, they got married and they had children. And\n\n13 again, there were five children in the Zaric family. I was the only male\n\n14 child, and I have four lovely sisters. The oldest one is Koviljka. She\n\n15 is my half sister. She had the status of a wartime orphan because my\n\n16 mother lost her husband who was taken away to Jasenovac and was killed\n\n17 there. So that would be a very brief outline of that part of my history.\n\n18 But I would just like to say in a very few words that I very seldom -- we\n\n19 very seldom heard about this terrible story from my parents. It was never\n\n20 a subject that was dominant in the Zaric household. And my parents strove\n\n21 to educate us in a new spirit, in a spirit of fraternity and unity. That\n\n22 was a principle for me, and all it meant was that one should live normally\n\n23 with others and be prepared to forgive, whether it's possible to forget\n\n24 such matters, that's another issue.\n\n25 Q. Mr. Zaric, thank you. I would now like to ask you: Who was your\n\nPage 19038\n\n1 half sister, Koviljka, married to, or rather, as you say, your sister,\n\n2 because she grew up on her own. Who was she married to?\n\n3 A. My eldest sister, Koviljka, she is married to Mustafa Omeranovic,\n\n4 who is a Muslim. She has three children. She had three children with\n\n5 him, two sons and a daughter.\n\n6 Q. And who is your sister Mara married to?\n\n7 A. She is my second elder sister. She is married to\n\n8 Nenad Brocilovic, a Serb, and is currently living in Serbia. And right up\n\n9 until the war, she lived in the area of Odzak, as my other three sisters\n\n10 did.\n\n11 Q. Mr. Zaric, who is your sister Jelena married to?\n\n12 A. My sister Jelena was married to a Muslim. She got divorced before\n\n13 the war and she had one child with him, a son, with whom she lives in\n\n14 Bosanski Samac at the time. He's married and has two children.\n\n15 Q. And your sister Nada, Dr. Nada, who is she married to?\n\n16 A. My younger sister is married to Marko Jakic, a Croat from the\n\n17 village of Osicac which is part of the Odzak municipality. At the moment\n\n18 they live in Kanjiza, in the territory of Serbia.\n\n19 Q. A minute ago, you said that all your sisters lived in the\n\n20 municipality of Odzak. But where did Koviljka live?\n\n21 A. She lived in Samac, whereas Mara, Jelena and Nada all got married\n\n22 and lived in the municipality of Odzak, or to be more precise in the town\n\n23 of Odzak.\n\n24 Q. And before the fighting broke out, where did your mother Mileva\n\n25 live, your mother Mileva Zaric?\n\nPage 19039\n\n1 A. My mother, Mileva Zaric, lived in Trnjak.\n\n2 Q. You said you had a daughter whose name was Natasa tell us who is\n\n3 she married to and where does she live now?\n\n4 A. My daughter Natasa is married to Mario Prgomet. He's a Croat from\n\n5 Bosanski Samac. And up until the war, they lived in the area of\n\n6 Bosanski Samac. But they are now living in Croatia. I have two\n\n7 grandchildren, that is to say, they have two sons.\n\n8 Q. Thank you, Mr. Zaric. Did you perform your military service in\n\n9 the JNA, the Yugoslav People's Army? If you did, where and when?\n\n10 A. Yes. I performed my military service in the JNA from 1967 to\n\n11 1969. I did my service in three towns in Serbia. First of all, I was in\n\n12 Pozarevac, then Kragujevac and then finally in Sabac. And I was a member\n\n13 of Tito's guards.\n\n14 Q. Was a rank conferred on you while you were performing your\n\n15 military service, and if so, which rank?\n\n16 A. Yes. I had a rank, the rank of what we call a \"desetar\" at the\n\n17 time, nothing else, and that was the rank with which I left the JNA.\n\n18 Q. And after that, was another rank conferred on you, that of a\n\n19 non-commissioned officer or an officer?\n\n20 A. Yes. First of all, I was assigned to the reserve police force in\n\n21 the Odzak municipality, because after I had completed my military service\n\n22 I was still living in the territory of Odzak. And in 1969 I moved to\n\n23 Samac and I became a non-commissioned officer. I was a corporal. And\n\n24 when the war broke out, I was a senior corporal.\n\n25 Q. And do you have a rank at the moment?\n\nPage 19040\n\n1 A. At the moment I have the rank of first lieutenant.\n\n2 Q. Thank you. Mr. Zaric, were you ever charged for a crime or\n\n3 misdemeanour of any kind?\n\n4 A. No, never. That never happened.\n\n5 Q. Thank you. We'll now move to your political affiliation. Were\n\n6 you a member of the Communist Party in Yugoslavia; and if so, from which\n\n7 date and until which date?\n\n8 A. Yes, I was a member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia since\n\n9 1966. When I joined the state security service in 1985, they started\n\n10 depoliticising the work of the Ministry of the Interior, so I then ceased\n\n11 with my party activities. And when I retired on the 1st of October, 1991,\n\n12 I joined the Socialist Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which\n\n13 was led by Nijaz Durakovic at that time.\n\n14 Q. Thank you. What was the ethnic composition of the SDP in Bosnia\n\n15 and Herzegovina?\n\n16 A. Well, it was a civil party. It was recognised as such, above all\n\n17 because members -- people from all ethnic groups were represented in this\n\n18 party.\n\n19 Q. Thank you. You said that the president of the SDP of Bosnia and\n\n20 Herzegovina was Nijaz Durakovic at that time. Do you remember the names\n\n21 of any other leaders during that period of time?\n\n22 A. I can remember Mr. Lagumdzija at that time. He was a member of\n\n23 the Socialist Democratic Party. And I think that to this very day he is\n\n24 the president of the BH SDP. I can remember Mr. Filipovic. I can\n\n25 remember Dr. Stojanovic and some people -- some other people from that\n\nPage 19041\n\n1 period. But I know that there were people who were members of various\n\n2 ethnic groups, of all the ethnic groups, and they still adhere to the SDP\n\n3 policies.\n\n4 Q. Could you tell us, do you know anything about this matter: What\n\n5 was the position of the BH SDP with regard to the national and religious\n\n6 rights of the peoples in Bosnia and Herzegovina?\n\n7 A. Their position was that they should have total national and\n\n8 religious freedom. People should not be divided according to their\n\n9 nationality, their religion, their race, et cetera. So these were\n\n10 civilian principles, civil principles, which were based on the most modern\n\n11 programmes of democratic parties in Europe.\n\n12 Q. Thank you, Mr. Zaric. In Bosanski Samac municipality, was there a\n\n13 municipal committee of the SDP?\n\n14 A. Yes, there was.\n\n15 Q. Do you know who the members of the SDP in the Bosanski Samac\n\n16 municipality were?\n\n17 A. Yes. I know official that the ethnic composition of the SDP in\n\n18 Bosanski Samac at that time -- well, the members were of -- came from\n\n19 various ethnic groups, from all the ethnic groups. But the Serbs were\n\n20 perhaps -- had perhaps the majority, and the Muslims and the Croats to a\n\n21 lesser extent. But I would like to say that people from all the ethnic\n\n22 groups were members of that party.\n\n23 Q. Thank you. We have already heard that the first multiparty\n\n24 elections were held in 1990. There were also elections at the same time\n\n25 for deputies in assembly -- Municipal Assemblies. Do you remember how\n\nPage 19042\n\n1 many deputies the SDP had in the Municipal Assembly of Bosanski Samac?\n\n2 A. If I remember well, during the first multiparty session, during\n\n3 the first multiparty assembly, there were six deputies from the SDP, three\n\n4 from the federation of reformist forces, and I think there were three from\n\n5 Liberal Party, whereas the other deputies in the Municipal Assembly of\n\n6 Bosanski Samac were from the SDS, the HDZ, and the SDA.\n\n7 Q. Thank you, Mr. Zaric. Could you just tell me whether among the\n\n8 deputies from the SDP, were there Serbs, Croats, and Muslims among their\n\n9 deputies?\n\n10 A. Yes, as far as I can remember. I know that the deputies at the\n\n11 time -- well, Rajko Kuresevic and Perica Krstanovic and Dr. Sekib, they\n\n12 were deputies at the time. There was someone called Marko Filipovic too.\n\n13 So I know that the ethnic composition of the deputies in the assembly was\n\n14 mixed.\n\n15 Q. Thank you. Tell us, please: Are you now a member of any\n\n16 political party?\n\n17 A. Yes. Since 1993, I've been a member of the Socialist Party of\n\n18 Republika Srpska, and to this very day I am its member.\n\n19 Q. That party, the Socialist Party of Republika Srpska, is it a\n\n20 political successor of the former SDP whose member you were in 1991 and\n\n21 1992?\n\n22 A. To a large extent.\n\n23 Q. Thank you. You, Mr. Zaric -- let me rephrase that. I'll withdraw\n\n24 that. Was there a municipal board of the Socialist Party in\n\n25 Bosanski Samac municipality?\n\nPage 19043\n\n1 A. Yes, there was. There was a municipal board, and it played its\n\n2 role in the first multiparty elections after the war, which took place in\n\n3 1996.\n\n4 Q. In that municipal board, did you have some sort of a duty in that\n\n5 municipal board, Mr. Zaric?\n\n6 A. Yes. I was the general secretary of the Socialist Party in Samac\n\n7 municipality, and during the first congress of the Socialist Party, I was\n\n8 member of the statutory commission of the Socialist Party of\n\n9 Republika Srpska.\n\n10 Q. So much about your political engagement. Let's now move on to\n\n11 some activities and inclinations that you have. And therefore, I would\n\n12 like to ask you about your sports engagement in Samac municipality and in\n\n13 the local commune of Trnjak Zorice.\n\n14 A. Well, that is probably the nicest page of my biography. In that\n\n15 part, I've tried to find myself. I found satisfaction. I was an active\n\n16 athlete. And I also was a member of the cultural society in my village,\n\n17 because I was a good singer. I sang folk songs. I also played football\n\n18 in a number of teams, in the team of Samac, in a number of village teams.\n\n19 I was a good athlete. In 1968, when I served in the JNA, I was a Yugoslav\n\n20 champion in 1500-metre race. As far as my cultural activities are\n\n21 concerned --\n\n22 Q. Slow down, Mr. Zaric. We will come to your cultural activities,\n\n23 but I would like to talk about sport now. Did you have any role in the\n\n24 sports life apart from you being an athlete?\n\n25 A. When I was younger, I was an active athlete. Later on, when I got\n\nPage 19044\n\n1 a bit older and gained some more authority, then, together with my fellow\n\n2 citizens, I was actively involved from the organisation of sports clubs,\n\n3 in their maintenance. I was a member of many of the management board of\n\n4 sports teams. I was president of a number of clubs. I was the president\n\n5 of the intermunicipal sports alliance in Brcko. Later on, this amateur\n\n6 involvement evolved into something more serious.\n\n7 Q. Once you stopped playing football, did you appear as a member of a\n\n8 veteran teams? Did you have any activities in that area?\n\n9 A. Yes. Before the war, for eight years, I was an active veteran in\n\n10 the Sloga football club from Prud. That is a Croatian village\n\n11 neighbouring on my village. And that is where I spent most of my football\n\n12 time in the later stages of my life, and that is where I have a lot of\n\n13 friends.\n\n14 Q. Let's move on to your activities within the cultural and artistic\n\n15 life of your community. Can you tell us something about your hobbies,\n\n16 your talents, your activities, and how did all that reflect?\n\n17 A. In the Zaric household, we always fought tragedy with song. Both\n\n18 of my parents were good singers, and I inherited that talent, talent for\n\n19 singing original folk songs that existed in those rural areas. And I\n\n20 would like to say that at that time that song was understood by over 5\n\n21 million people in the area of the former Yugoslavia. I also recorded my\n\n22 first videocassette of original folk songs with the Begic brothers, who\n\n23 were the best folk singers in the former Yugoslavia. They are Croats who\n\n24 resided in the territory of Derventa. They are still alive and they are\n\n25 still the best singers of those original folk songs. And since I had this\n\nPage 19045\n\n1 talent, I was a member of cultural clubs, and I also appeared on TV show\n\n2 called Knowledge is Wealth, and that show was dedicated to the problems of\n\n3 the rural areas. Every time a singer would appear on those shows. I\n\n4 myself appeared eight times on that particular show before the war. There\n\n5 was a cultural association, Sloga, which at that time was called Vladimir\n\n6 Nazor and it was active in Prud. I was their active member and, as such,\n\n7 I participated in many international shows, some of them in Italy,\n\n8 Switzerland, and Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia. We went everywhere. We sang\n\n9 everywhere. In simple words, I was a very active in that part, and that\n\n10 is where everybody knew me by my nickname, Solaja.\n\n11 Q. When you were a member of the Vladimir Nazor cultural association\n\n12 from the village of Prud, did you have to wear a folk -- the Croat folk\n\n13 costume?\n\n14 A. Yes. That is exactly the folk costume that I wore. It was a\n\n15 beautiful folk costume, very rich. And wherever we went, it attracted the\n\n16 attention of the audience, because it was really very, very rich in\n\n17 colours. And whenever there -- at some other cultural events, I would\n\n18 also wear the Serbian folk costume, and I sang. But whenever I went on\n\n19 tours with the cultural society of Prud, I would always wear the Croatian\n\n20 folk costume.\n\n21 Q. As a performer of the original folk music, Mr. Zaric, did you\n\n22 participate in celebrations, in religious festivities, in weddings, in\n\n23 sending off boys to the army?\n\n24 A. Yes. That was a regular thing. I can even say that there could\n\n25 hardly an event be organised at which I did not participate, at which I\n\nPage 19046\n\n1 did not sing, at which I did not make my contribution. Weddings,\n\n2 christenings. I sang several times when Catholic priests were ordained.\n\n3 There is a very special ceremony when a Catholic priest is ordained, and\n\n4 when he delivers his first mass. This is a huge event. And several times\n\n5 I sang songs at those events. I would also like to say that a number of\n\n6 times people from the party, party members, would call me to task because\n\n7 of my hobby, because they were of the opinion that the political activity\n\n8 and the singing of folk songs cannot go together, but I nevertheless\n\n9 continued doing that.\n\n10 Q. You participated in all sorts of events of all the ethnic\n\n11 backgrounds?\n\n12 A. Yes. I was in Sehovici, in a well-known cultural event. I\n\n13 participated together with well-known singers of Muslim folk songs,\n\n14 together with the Begic brothers and a number of people from all ethnic\n\n15 backgrounds who also were involved in that kind of activity.\n\n16 Q. Thank you very much, Mr. Zaric. We will move on to another topic.\n\n17 You've already told us that you took an early retirement, that you were\n\n18 forced to retire early, and you told us about the conditions under which\n\n19 you were retired. Can you please tell us now what you did after you were\n\n20 retired, and what were your activities? So what did you do from the 1st\n\n21 of October onwards? I would like to cover the period up to the\n\n22 establishment of the 4th Detachment, the 5th of January, 1992.\n\n23 A. I was very young when I had to retire. I was still strong. I was\n\n24 going strong. And at the beginning I dedicated my time to stabilise\n\n25 myself, to recharge my batteries, and that's why I helped my family work\n\nPage 19047\n\n1 on the farm in Trnjak. And I also helped my wife, who at the time managed\n\n2 a private grocery store. So I was helping both of the sides, my mother\n\n3 and my wife, and that's how I spent most of my time. And then the\n\n4 municipal secretariat for National Defence mobilised me, and I started\n\n5 working as a reservist, gathering intelligence for the Yugoslav People's\n\n6 Army in the same area where I had previously been the chief of detachment.\n\n7 Q. How did you perform these duties? Who were your contacts with and\n\n8 who gave you your orders and your tasks?\n\n9 A. My first conversation about that was in the command of the 17th\n\n10 Corps in Tuzla, in the presence of the commander of that corps, General\n\n11 Savo Jankovic, and the chief of the security of that corps,\n\n12 Colonel Musulovic also attended that meeting. Another person who attended\n\n13 was the commander of the 17th Tactical Group, Lieutenant Colonel at that\n\n14 time Stevan Nikolic and Captain Petrovic was also there. He was from the\n\n15 Yugoslav People's Garrison in Brcko.\n\n16 Q. Thank you very much. Mr. Zaric, what did you discuss at the time\n\n17 with the people who you have just mentioned?\n\n18 A. I forgot to say that there was also Milos Bogdanovic there at the\n\n19 time. He was the municipal secretary for National Defence. And I have to\n\n20 be honest with you and say that those people had heard that I had been\n\n21 forced to retire overnight, but they also knew that I was very good at\n\n22 what I did and that I was very professional in what I did. And then they\n\n23 told me that I would be mobilised to work on gathering intelligence and\n\n24 necessary for the Yugoslav People's Army in that area. They told me that\n\n25 this intelligence was important to preserve the Yugoslav People's Army as\n\nPage 19048\n\n1 the defence component in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to\n\n2 preserve Bosnia and Herzegovina as an administrative unit of the former\n\n3 Yugoslavia, and to preserve Yugoslavia, which to my mind was the best\n\n4 country in the world and my favourite country in the world ever.\n\n5 Q. Thank you. I suppose that you have accepted those tasks. Did you\n\n6 perform them later on?\n\n7 A. Yes, I did carry out those tasks. I would like to say that\n\n8 nothing was different in the method of work. I didn't apply anything new\n\n9 with regard to what I had done before. When I was retired, I was still a\n\n10 reserve officer for the defence preparation of the SDB of Samac\n\n11 municipality. It's a normal procedure. Once you cease to be an active\n\n12 officer, you become a reserve officer, and that department is the\n\n13 department for preparation -- defence preparation of the SDB. The chief\n\n14 of that was Boro Cvijanovic who was my previous colleague from the SDB\n\n15 detachment in Modrica. I was using my network of associates that I had\n\n16 established as the chief of the service. When I collected my basic\n\n17 intelligence I used to find out how best I could preserve the component of\n\n18 Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Yugoslav People's Army, all in view of\n\n19 creating the best possible relationship in order to avoid the evil that\n\n20 had struck Slovenia and Croatia at the beginning of the war there.\n\n21 Q. Mr. Zaric, I would kindly ask you to say something about the\n\n22 reserve department for the defence preparations of the SDB. Is that\n\n23 department a department that had its office in the Bosanski Samac SUP?\n\n24 A. Yes. This department always had its separate office in the -- on\n\n25 the premises of the public security station. That office was always\n\nPage 19049\n\n1 locked. There was a desk there and some of our technical equipment was\n\n2 there, the equipment that we used as the state security service. And that\n\n3 technique was somewhat different than the technique and technical means\n\n4 used by the public security service. And obviously this department for\n\n5 defence preparations, that was its official establishment title, it\n\n6 belonged to the sector and it was linked up to the Ministry of the\n\n7 Interior of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina at the time.\n\n8 Q. Yes, of course, but can you please explain to the Honourable\n\n9 Chamber the intelligence that you gathered as the department. Who did you\n\n10 forward this intelligence to? You mentioned Mr. Boro Cvijanovic. Was\n\n11 that the link that you had?\n\n12 A. Precisely. When we had our meetings, there were seven of us in\n\n13 that department for defence preparations, and one of those people were\n\n14 Mr. Petar Karlovic, who testified before this Chamber. There was also\n\n15 Mr. Goran Kljajic, who is Mr. Dragan Lukac's brother-in-law, and\n\n16 Dragan Lukac testified before this Chamber. There was also\n\n17 Fikret Sejakovic. What I'm saying is we were of a mixed ethnic\n\n18 composition, our department was. The intelligence that we gathered in the\n\n19 field, we would brief our chief. Our chief would make note of our\n\n20 briefing and then he would inform his superiors in the SDB sector of\n\n21 Doboj.\n\n22 MR. RE: Could we perhaps just clarify for the transcript when\n\n23 this was? It's a little bit unclear as to whether it was post-retirement\n\n24 or before.\n\n25 JUDGE MUMBA: I thought the witness had explained that this was\n\nPage 19050\n\n1 after retirement when he joined the 4th Detachment and was assigned these\n\n2 duties. Perhaps Mr. Pisarevic can ask the accused to explain.\n\n3 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n4 Q. Before I started asking you questions along these lines, I said\n\n5 that we were talking about the period of time from the 1st of October,\n\n6 when he was retired, and to the 5th of January, 1992, when the 4th\n\n7 Detachment was established.\n\n8 Mr. Zaric, we were talking about your activities in this\n\n9 department for defence preparations. All this refers to the period\n\n10 between the time you were retired and --?\n\n11 A. Between the point of my retirement up to the beginning of April\n\n12 1992, immediately before the beginning of war.\n\n13 Q. How did you perform your duties towards the Yugoslav\n\n14 People's Army? Who did you report to?\n\n15 A. I reported to the Yugoslav People's Army in drafting reports in\n\n16 one copy, and I would report to my superior in the 17th Tactical Group,\n\n17 Mr. Makso Simeunovic. And before Mr. Makso Simeunovic, there was\n\n18 Mr. Zvonko Jurevic, who was the chief of the OB in the 17th Tactical\n\n19 Group, because Mr. Simeunovic joined the 17th Tactical Group somewhat\n\n20 later. Before he arrived, it was Mr. Zvonko Jurevic, who received the\n\n21 intelligence data from me, those that I deemed significant. And they\n\n22 spoke about the movement of certain forces, about some phenomenon that I\n\n23 recorded in the area of Posavina, and to my mind, those threatened to\n\n24 jeopardise the Yugoslav People's Army or the constitutional order of\n\n25 Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nPage 19051\n\n1 [Defence counsel confer]\n\n2 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n3 Q. Mr. Zaric, let's conclude by saying -- if I understood you well,\n\n4 you had two jobs at the time. One was for the state security, and the\n\n5 other was for the Yugoslav People's Army?\n\n6 A. Exactly. That was precisely the case. But both institutions\n\n7 were -- belonged to the state, because the Yugoslav People's Army was\n\n8 something that I considered the only legitimate defence force in\n\n9 Bosnia-Herzegovina and the state security was obviously the state security\n\n10 of that state of Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\n11 Q. Mr. Zaric, we're now going to talk about the meetings which\n\n12 preceded the establishment of the 4th Detachment of the Yugoslav People's\n\n13 Army. Before this Tribunal, we've heard testimonies about that, about the\n\n14 secretariat for National Defence of Samac municipality having organised\n\n15 two meetings with the officers and non-commissioned officers of the JNA in\n\n16 order to inform them about the political and security situation in the\n\n17 area. At those meetings, one -- and these was Colonel Nikolic. My\n\n18 question to you is as follows: Did you also attend those meetings?\n\n19 A. Yes.\n\n20 Q. Let's start with first meeting first. Can you please tell us when\n\n21 this first meeting took place?\n\n22 A. If my memory serves me well, both meetings, the first one and the\n\n23 second one, were held in late 1991. The first meeting was held in early\n\n24 November and the second meeting was sometime towards the end of that year.\n\n25 Both meetings were held in the Mitra Trifunovic Vucar [phoen] centre.\n\nPage 19052\n\n1 They were organised by the municipal secretariat for National Defence.\n\n2 All the reserve officers and non-commissioned officers were invited, those\n\n3 were the Samac municipality. Amongst others, Mr. Stevan Nikolic,\n\n4 Lieutenant Colonel, the commander of the 17th Tactical Group, with his\n\n5 chief of staff, Brajkovic and some other associated, attended this\n\n6 meeting. At this moment, I can't remember all the names, but I am certain\n\n7 about the two that I've mentioned. The subject, the topic of that meeting\n\n8 was how to organise the defence component in the town of Samac, with a\n\n9 view to preventing the war from the Republic of Croatia spreading in that\n\n10 area, with a view to preventing interethnic conflicts of a large -- at a\n\n11 large scale, if the police was unable to deal with that problem\n\n12 themselves. And also one of the goals was for Bosnia and Herzegovina and\n\n13 this part of the territory to remain an integral part of the former\n\n14 Yugoslavia. These were the three main messages that could be heard at\n\n15 that meeting. I don't want to go into any greater detail.\n\n16 Q. Thank you very much, Mr. Zaric. And the secretary of the\n\n17 municipal secretariat for National Defence, Milos Bogdanovic, was he also\n\n18 at that meeting?\n\n19 A. Yes. I have already said that the meeting was organised by the\n\n20 municipal secretariat, because they were the ones who sent out the\n\n21 invitations. They were the ones who had the record of all the officers\n\n22 and non-commissioned officers. And I remember well that Mr. Milos\n\n23 Bogdanovic attended that meeting, and I have to say that Mr. Bozo Ninkovic\n\n24 also attended the meeting. At that time, he discharged one of the\n\n25 important duties in the secretariat of the National Defence, but I don't\n\nPage 19053\n\n1 know whether he was a deputy or maybe he had some operational duty in that\n\n2 secretariat.\n\n3 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] I believe that we have reached the\n\n4 time for the break, Your Honours.\n\n5 JUDGE MUMBA: Yes. We'll take our break now.\n\n6 --- Recess taken at 10.29 a.m.\n\n7 --- On resuming at 11.01 a.m.\n\n8 JUDGE MUMBA: Yes, Mr. Lukic.\n\n9 MR. LUKIC: [Interpretation] Your Honours, I apologise for\n\n10 interrupting the testimony, very briefly. Before Mr. Zaric started\n\n11 testifying, I wanted to address you with regard to the submission of the\n\n12 Prosecution with regard to Mr. Jovan Erletic, but I had to take advantage\n\n13 of the break to confer with my colleague. Since we have been instructed\n\n14 to express our position by today, I would just like to briefly\n\n15 say that Mr. Miroslav Tadic's Defence counsel doesn't have the intention\n\n16 of cross-examining Mr. Jovan Erletic. This is all I wanted to inform the\n\n17 Trial Chamber of. I didn't want to submit anything in writing about this\n\n18 matter. I wanted to follow the Trial Chamber's instructions about oral\n\n19 addresses. And with regard to the Prosecution's position, we will not be\n\n20 cross-examining Mr. Jovan Erletic, given the contents of his statement.\n\n21 This is what I wanted to inform the Trial Chamber of.\n\n22 JUDGE MUMBA: Thank you very much.\n\n23 Yes, Mr. Pantelic.\n\n24 MR. PANTELIC: Yes, Your Honour. On the same matter, we would\n\n25 like to have this witness for cross-examination. Thank you.\n\nPage 19054\n\n1 JUDGE MUMBA: Which one? What's the name?\n\n2 MR. PANTELIC: Erletic, the last one. Because you already ruled\n\n3 with regard to the presence of Witness Marko Tubakovic, I believe.\n\n4 JUDGE MUMBA: Yes.\n\n5 MR. PANTELIC: So we are speaking about Mr. Erletic. Yes, thank\n\n6 you.\n\n7 JUDGE MUMBA: All right. We'll proceed, Mr. Pisarevic.\n\n8 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Thank you, Your Honour.\n\n9 Q. Mr. Zaric, just a brief instruction. I have been asked by the\n\n10 interpreters to ask you if you could slow down slightly. It's in your\n\n11 interest to speak a little more slowly, because that will enable them to\n\n12 do their work properly. So could you please try to speak a little more\n\n13 slowly.\n\n14 A. Very well.\n\n15 Q. Thank you. We were speaking about the first meeting in the\n\n16 centre, organised by the secretariat for National Defence in the\n\n17 municipality of Samac, and I would now like to ask you if you can remember\n\n18 anything about this: Who took the floor at that meeting? That's my first\n\n19 question. Because at that meeting of the reserve officers and\n\n20 non-commissioned officers, Milos Bogdanovic, as the secretary of the\n\n21 secretariat for National Defence, he spoke at that meeting?\n\n22 A. Yes, he did.\n\n23 Q. Thank you. Did the commander of the 17th Tactical Group,\n\n24 Stevan Nikolic, take the floor at that meeting?\n\n25 A. Yes.\n\nPage 19055\n\n1 Q. If you can remember, can you tell us what Colonel Stevan Nikolic,\n\n2 as commander of the 17th Tactical Group of the JNA, can you tell us what\n\n3 he told the reserve officers and non-commissioned officers who were there\n\n4 at that time?\n\n5 A. Before I answer this question, I would first of all like to inform\n\n6 the Trial Chamber to compare the speakers. If we're talking about\n\n7 Milos Bogdanovic, who was the secretariat of the municipal secretariat, he\n\n8 only made introductory remarks and explained the reasons for which we were\n\n9 gathered. Lieutenant Colonel Stevan Nikolic, the commander of the 17th\n\n10 Tactical Group, took the floor. Igor Kobas [as interpreted], the\n\n11 commander of the municipal staff of the Samac municipality, took the floor\n\n12 at that time. I spoke briefly at that meeting. Mr. Esad Delic also\n\n13 spoke, Captain first class, and there were several other people who spoke,\n\n14 who took the floor. It wasn't just a matter of simply issuing instructions\n\n15 and information. There was, so to speak, a more open discussion.\n\n16 MR. LAZAREVIC: Yes. One correction for the transcript. On page\n\n17 34, line 2, the name was Ivo Kobas, and he was actually the commander of\n\n18 the municipal staff of the TO of Samac municipality. Just to have this\n\n19 clarification.\n\n20 JUDGE MUMBA: Very well.\n\n21 A. To summarise what some of them said, I can point out that the main\n\n22 message of Lieutenant Colonel Stevan Nikolic was that it was essential to\n\n23 organise a defence within the JNA, the Yugoslav People's Army. At the\n\n24 time he did not conceal the fact that the Territorial Defence was not\n\n25 performing the function that it was supposed to perform, and Ivo Kobas in\n\nPage 19056\n\n1 particular addressed this matter and he pointed to the impossibility of\n\n2 organising the Territorial Defence in the way that it was supposed to be\n\n3 organised, according to the constitution in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\n\n4 because many officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers, failed to\n\n5 respond to the summons as issued by the municipal staff for legitimate\n\n6 defence units to be formed, and according to the BH constitution and the\n\n7 law on national defence, such units were supposed to be formed.\n\n8 Mr. Stevan Nikolic's main message was that what the television programme\n\n9 showed from the territory of Slovenia and Croatia was quite sufficient to\n\n10 show the evil spread by war, and everything should be done to make sure\n\n11 that the way the war was being presented from Croatia, it shouldn't be\n\n12 presented in Bosnia and Herzegovina in that way. He asked for unity,\n\n13 freedom among the officers and non-commissioned officers, and he requested\n\n14 that they help maintain order, maintain harmony among the people, and he\n\n15 requested that there should not be interethnic conflicts on a large scale\n\n16 in this area of ours. He drew attention to certain very complex security\n\n17 elements which were present in the Posavina area, from Bosanski Brod right\n\n18 up to Brcko.\n\n19 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n20 Q. Mr. Zaric, at the time, did Mr. Nikolic ask all officers and\n\n21 non-commissioned officers, regardless of their ethnic membership, did he\n\n22 request that they join the JNA, the Yugoslav People's Army?\n\n23 A. Yes. In a very manifest and clear way, and I quite clearly\n\n24 remember his words, and this is a well-known fact. It was easy to\n\n25 organise a certain kind of defence in villages inhabited by Serbs, where\n\nPage 19057\n\n1 the Serbs were in the majority or where the Croats were in the majority.\n\n2 It was a problem how to organise defence in a town in which people of all\n\n3 ethnic groups lived. That was the main problem, which is why he made an\n\n4 appeal and he requested that all officers and non-commissioned officers\n\n5 who were prepared to defend such a conception, who were prepared to defend\n\n6 the city, he asked them to report to the secretariat of -- for National\n\n7 Defence. He asked them to mobilise. And then it was the responsibility\n\n8 of the municipal secretariat for National Defence to compile certain\n\n9 records. And on the basis of those records, to proceed to organise\n\n10 certain units, and also to organise the 4th Detachment, of which more will\n\n11 be said in the future.\n\n12 Q. Yes, of course, Mr. Zaric.\n\n13 JUDGE LINDHOLM: Excuse me for interrupting you, but there\n\n14 is -- on page 35, line 7, there is an expression which perhaps is due to\n\n15 the translation. It reads: \"That they help maintain order, maintain\n\n16 harmony among the people, and he\" - that means Lieutenant Colonel\n\n17 Nikolic - \"requested that there should not be interethnic conflicts on a\n\n18 large scale in this area of ours.\" That expression \"on a large scale\"\n\n19 must -- it's very ambiguous what is meant. Is it that he accepted, so to\n\n20 say, on a small -- on a minor scale but not on a large scale? Could you\n\n21 clarify that with the witness. Thank you.\n\n22 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Yes, of course. Thank you.\n\n23 Q. Mr. Zaric, you have heard the question. I think it has to do with\n\n24 the translation, after all. What did Mr. Nikolic request? How did he\n\n25 want the reserve military officers to become engaged? What sort of\n\nPage 19058\n\n1 contribution did he want them to make?\n\n2 A. When I used the word \"large scale,\" when I was testifying before\n\n3 the break, I clarified this matter to a certain extent, I was referring\n\n4 to, and I think that Mr. Nikolic was referring to the same thing, I was\n\n5 thinking about certain ethnic conflicts not being able to be controlled by\n\n6 the police and the army. I was thinking of serious incidents that\n\n7 couldn't be controlled by the police. And then in such a case, the army's\n\n8 role would be obvious. In such a case, the army would have to assume a\n\n9 position. But the army didn't tolerate any serious incidents.\n\n10 Mr. Nikolic was only pointing to certain details, and I'll talk about\n\n11 these details later on, because they're part of the security problem in\n\n12 that area. He was just drawing attention to the fact that those details,\n\n13 events in various parts of Posavina, could make the situation more complex\n\n14 and could make it difficult to control the political and security\n\n15 situation. That's what I was thinking of.\n\n16 JUDGE LINDHOLM: Thank you.\n\n17 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Thank you.\n\n18 Q. Mr. Zaric, you said that you too participated in that first\n\n19 meeting, you also took the floor. Isn't that correct?\n\n20 A. Yes.\n\n21 Q. Can you remember, before this Trial Chamber here today, the\n\n22 matters you spoke about at that meeting? Could you be brief, please.\n\n23 A. I took advantage of the opportunity, because the people who were\n\n24 at that meeting, the officers and the non-commissioned officers who were\n\n25 there, knew me quite well, and they knew that I had worked in the security\n\nPage 19059\n\n1 service for years. Perhaps many at the time were not aware of the fact\n\n2 that I had been retired. I pointed to the complex security situation in\n\n3 the Posavina area, and in particular in the area of Samac, Modrica, Orasje\n\n4 areas, and I referred to certain events. I knew that these things were\n\n5 happening for sure, and I said that it was necessary to organise a unified\n\n6 defence, not only in the town of Samac. I spoke about it necessary to\n\n7 having a unified defence in the area of the entire municipality of Samac,\n\n8 and beyond that area too. And this was borne out by subsequent events.\n\n9 It would have been of no significance if Samac had joint defence and other\n\n10 rural areas had other military formations, other armies. In such a case,\n\n11 this would not have improved the situation. This would only have made the\n\n12 security situation deteriorate. So that is the matter that I addressed,\n\n13 because we knew each other, and our main task was to remain unified in the\n\n14 town of Samac, because Samac was also the administrative centre of the\n\n15 municipality, where all the key institutions were located: The industry,\n\n16 et cetera, in the municipality area.\n\n17 Q. Thank you. Mr. Zaric, did you appeal to all officers and\n\n18 non-commissioned officers to join the JNA, regardless of the ethnic groups\n\n19 they belonged to?\n\n20 A. Absolutely. That was the principle that I followed, and this is a\n\n21 principle that I will adhere to at all times.\n\n22 Q. Thank you. We will now turn to the other meeting held in\n\n23 December. You said that at that meeting -- that that meeting was also\n\n24 held in the memorial centre. Who was present at the meeting, and what did\n\n25 you notice at that meeting with regard to the presence of officers and\n\nPage 19060\n\n1 non-commissioned officers?\n\n2 A. All I can say is that the first and second meetings were\n\n3 held -- that the first and second meeting were held in the hall, the\n\n4 so-called red hall of the memorial centre. It's called the red hall\n\n5 because the seats in the hall had red upholstery. I can remember very\n\n6 well that there were between 60 and 70 officers and non-commissioned\n\n7 officers from the town of Samac. And on the second time the meeting was\n\n8 held in December, a third of that number was present. About 70 per cent\n\n9 of that third were Serbian nationality. The others were Muslims and\n\n10 Croats. I apologise -- who had responded to that appeal. And it is thus\n\n11 possible to conclude that the appeal made at the first meeting didn't bear\n\n12 any fruit. Many officers and non-commissioned officers, in my opinion,\n\n13 followed national leaders rather than us from the defence unit that I have\n\n14 spoken about.\n\n15 Q. Thank you. What were the matters discussed at the second meeting\n\n16 at the memorial centre?\n\n17 A. The subject-matter was very similar at the second meeting, and it\n\n18 was indicated that there was a mood in town, there was the will to form a\n\n19 defence, and an agreement was reached to mobilise, to carry out the\n\n20 voluntary mobilisation of all men liable for military service who wanted\n\n21 to join such a defence unit. So the tasks -- the objectives would be the\n\n22 same as the ones that I have spoken about here. There was nothing else\n\n23 apart from the fact that the people from the secretariat for National\n\n24 Defence made a record of those who were present at the second meeting, and\n\n25 they counted on those officers and non-commissioned officers for\n\nPage 19061\n\n1 organising a unit which would be established as of January, as a certain\n\n2 unit in the area of the town of Samac.\n\n3 Q. Thank you. You said that a unit would be formed. Tell us: What\n\n4 was the nature of the unit that was formed? What was its name and when\n\n5 was it established?\n\n6 A. This united was called the 4th Detachment of the JNA, the Yugoslav\n\n7 People's Army. In territorial terms, it was linked to the Samac\n\n8 settlement alone, and it was part of the 17th Tactical Group, under the\n\n9 command of Lieutenant Colonel Stevan Nikolic, and its headquarters was in\n\n10 Pelagici [phoen].\n\n11 Q. When was the 4th Detachment established?\n\n12 A. By order of the command of the 17th Tactical Group, Lieutenant\n\n13 Colonel Stevan Nikolic, it was established on the 5th of January, 1992.\n\n14 The decision was adopted on forming the 4th Detachment. Its principal\n\n15 leadership was appointed and its leadership was assigned with the task of\n\n16 gradually organising subordinate and other necessary military units which\n\n17 would form the detachment, which would compose the detachment as a unit.\n\n18 Q. Mr. Zaric, did you become a member of the 4th Detachment? How did\n\n19 this take place and when did it take place?\n\n20 A. When this order was issued, the one that I mentioned a minute ago,\n\n21 Lieutenant Colonel Nikolic appointed a detachment commander, and from the\n\n22 5th of January, 1992, I officially became a member of that detachment and\n\n23 I had the duties of the -- as assistant commander for security and\n\n24 information affairs and for information and morale. This additional\n\n25 function was given this name later on.\n\nPage 19062\n\n1 Q. Can you tell us: Who was appointed as commander of the 4th\n\n2 Detachment by Stevan Nikolic's order?\n\n3 A. Captain first class Mr. Radovan Antic was appointed as commander\n\n4 of the detachment.\n\n5 Q. And who was appointed as deputy commander of the 4th Detachment?\n\n6 A. Deputy commander of the 4th Detachment, as deputy commander of the\n\n7 4th Detachment, Mr. Jovo Savic, who was also a Captain first class, was\n\n8 appointed to this post.\n\n9 Q. Was Mr. Miroslav Tadic also appointed a certain position by\n\n10 virtue -- by this order?\n\n11 A. Yes. He was the deputy commander of the 4th Detachment for\n\n12 logistics.\n\n13 Q. Thank you. You've just told us that you were appointed as a\n\n14 deputy commander for security and intelligence affairs, according to the\n\n15 order issued by lieutenant colonel. Could you now tell us what your\n\n16 duties and tasks included, as deputy commander for security and\n\n17 intelligence.\n\n18 A. When the decision was adopted on establishing the 4th Detachment,\n\n19 I was given these security duties in addition to my other duties, and this\n\n20 in fact meant that I should monitor all intelligence, that I should gather\n\n21 all intelligence that might relate to threats, to the existence of that\n\n22 unit. I had monitored the security situation in that area, in the area of\n\n23 the town, where our zone of responsibility had been established. I was to\n\n24 gather all kinds -- all sorts of information in intelligence that might be\n\n25 of interest. And intelligence on units that were against the\n\nPage 19063\n\n1 establishment of that detachment. So it had to do with protecting\n\n2 intelligence and also counter-intelligence. So very briefly, those would\n\n3 be my duties.\n\n4 Q. Thank you. And what sort of authority did you have? Did you have\n\n5 any kind of authority as part of your duties that you had to perform?\n\n6 A. The deputy commander of the detachment is on the lower step of the\n\n7 hierarchy in security terms in the JNA, and in the Territorial Defence\n\n8 too. There are no -- lower [as interpreted] units in the detachment don't\n\n9 have that security component. So my task was to gather such intelligence\n\n10 and to relay such intelligence to my superior, Makso Simeunovic, who was\n\n11 the chief of the intelligence and security organ of the 17th Tactical\n\n12 Group. So I was authorised to gather intelligence, information, and to\n\n13 relay this intelligence. Some of the intelligence was intelligence that I\n\n14 relayed to Mr. Simeunovic, and other parts of the information I would\n\n15 relay to the commander of the 4th Detachment, Mr. Antic.\n\n16 MR. LAZAREVIC: Yes. The exact word that Mr. Zaric used here on\n\n17 page 41, line 23, is the lowest step of the hierarchy, and here it says\n\n18 \"lower.\" The lowest. That was the word he used.\n\n19 JUDGE MUMBA: Thank you. It will be corrected.\n\n20 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n21 Q. Mr. Zaric, did you have any command role in the detachment, i.e.,\n\n22 did you have the right to issue any orders to anybody, to any of the\n\n23 members of the 4th Detachment?\n\n24 A. No, I did not have any command role along these lines. I did not\n\n25 have any authorities along these lines. This is not envisaged by any\n\nPage 19064\n\n1 regulations, nor did I have such a role in reality.\n\n2 Q. Who in the command of the 4th Detachment had the authority to\n\n3 issue executive orders to the members of the 4th Detachment?\n\n4 A. The authority to issue such orders belonged to the commander of\n\n5 the 4th Detachment, Mr. Radovan Antic. In case of his absence, some of\n\n6 the executive orders could be issued by his deputy, Captain Jovo Savic.\n\n7 Q. Did you, Mr. Zaric, have any authority, either given to you by the\n\n8 commander or the deputy commander of the detachment, to issue any kind of\n\n9 executive orders?\n\n10 A. No. I did not have any such authority.\n\n11 Q. Very well, then. Irrespective of that, did you yourself,\n\n12 Mr. Zaric, ever issue any executive order to any of the members of the 4th\n\n13 Detachment?\n\n14 A. No, never.\n\n15 Q. Now I will ask you to answer a few questions relative to the\n\n16 functioning of the security organs of the 4th Detachment. One of them\n\n17 would be who was your superior? Who were you subordinated to?\n\n18 A. I was subordinated to the commander of the detachment. That was\n\n19 down the line of commandment and the line of subordination. My immediate\n\n20 superior was the chief of the security in the 17th Tactical Group,\n\n21 Mr. Makso Simeunovic, which means that one needs to bear in mind these two\n\n22 communication components. One goes along the line or the chain of\n\n23 command, to which I'm linked directly -- according to which I'm directly\n\n24 linked to the commander of the detachment, and with that, the commander of\n\n25 the 17th Tactical Group, and according to the lines of subordination and\n\nPage 19065\n\n1 the conveying of the intelligence information, my first immediate superior\n\n2 was my -- was Mr. Makso Simeunovic, as the chief of the intelligence and\n\n3 security at the level of the 17th Tactical Group.\n\n4 Q. Thank you. Who did you report to, Mr. Zaric, about your work?\n\n5 A. I sent a written report and I gave oral reports to my superior,\n\n6 Mr. Makso Simeunovic. Some of the intelligence which I believe they were\n\n7 of vital interest for the security of the detachment, I would give\n\n8 directly to the commander of the detachment, Mr. Nikolic, or - sorry -\n\n9 Mr. Antic, the commander of the detachment.\n\n10 Q. When you submitted your report or when you conveyed certain\n\n11 information to your superior - according to the principles of\n\n12 subordination, that was Mr. Makso Simeunovic - was Mr. Makso Simeunovic\n\n13 under the obligation to inform you about what happened with your report\n\n14 and the intelligence that you gathered?\n\n15 A. No. Once I issued my report to Mr. Makso Simeunovic, he was under\n\n16 no obligation to give me any feedback on what the lot of my information or\n\n17 my report was. But it did happen that some significant intelligence was\n\n18 discussed or I would receive some new task that stemmed from that piece of\n\n19 intelligence. However, he was under no obligation to give me any feedback\n\n20 on what I gave him as intelligence.\n\n21 Q. You mentioned that in addition to the security and intelligence\n\n22 tasks in the detachment, you also performed some tasks that were relative\n\n23 to morale and information. Tell me: Who issued the orders to you about\n\n24 the morale and the information in the 4th Detachment?\n\n25 A. When the command of the detachment was established, it was\n\nPage 19066\n\n1 immediately said that in addition to the intelligence and security, I\n\n2 would also be in charge of the duties relative to the information and\n\n3 morale in the unit. In simple words, this meant I would be the port\n\n4 parole [phoen] [Realtime transcript read in error \"corporal\"] of that\n\n5 unit. And when I received my orders in that segment, that was from the\n\n6 commander Antic or his deputy Mr. Savic. And when I appeared on two\n\n7 occasions in the public, that was done at the express order of Commander\n\n8 Nikolic.\n\n9 Q. Can you now describe for the Trial Chamber what were the contents\n\n10 of your tasks relative to the issues of morale in the 4th Detachment.\n\n11 A. When the decision was adopted on establishing the 4th Detachment,\n\n12 an attempt was immediately made to do a trial and see how many people\n\n13 would respond to this mobilisation, the tasks and goals were of\n\n14 which -- of which were as I explained a little while ago.\n\n15 MR. LAZAREVIC: [Previous translation continues]... Clarification\n\n16 on page 44, line 20. In simple words, this means that I would be the\n\n17 corporal. Actually, Mr. Zaric said \"port parole\" [phoen]. This was the\n\n18 word that he used, the speaker.\n\n19 JUDGE MUMBA: Thank you. It will be corrected.\n\n20 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n21 Q. At the beginning already in January, over 200 men responded to the\n\n22 mobilisation call. They were of all ethnic backgrounds and they wanted to\n\n23 join this detachment. Very soon after that, we decided to stage a public\n\n24 meeting with the first group of people who volunteered and responded to\n\n25 the mobilisation call. And one of my tasks at that meeting, which was\n\nPage 19067\n\n1 amongst others attended by Mr. Nikolic and by Mr. Antic, so one of my\n\n2 tasks was to exert moral influence, to exert influence and try and\n\n3 mobilise as many people as possible to join this defence component whose\n\n4 name was the 4th Detachment. My message was that it was the only\n\n5 guarantee for the safety of our town of Samac.\n\n6 Q. And your duties relative to information in the detachment, what\n\n7 were they all about? Let's first consider the issue of providing\n\n8 information to the members of the 4th Detachment. How did -- how was that\n\n9 organised? Were there any regular meetings with those people?\n\n10 A. Yes. There were meetings on a large scale, with all the members,\n\n11 and smaller-scale meetings in units. There was three or four meetings,\n\n12 one of them in the memorial centre, another one in the Tekstilac\n\n13 restaurant. Tekstilac is the Samac textile industry, which also housed\n\n14 the command of the 4th Detachment.\n\n15 Q. Thank you. What were the topics that you discussed at those\n\n16 meetings?\n\n17 A. The main topic was to point to the members of the 4th Detachment\n\n18 how serious the political and the security situation was at that time, not\n\n19 only in the town and municipality of Samac but also in the general area.\n\n20 The message was also to point out the need to establish a defence\n\n21 component in order to resist everything that looked like war.\n\n22 Q. Tell us now: Who were the speakers at the meetings of the members\n\n23 of the 4th Detachment?\n\n24 A. At the meeting which was held in the memorial centre, one of the\n\n25 speakers was Mr. Stevan Nikolic, Lieutenant Colonel Nikolic, whose speech\n\nPage 19068\n\n1 conveyed the messages that I've already mentioned. Another speaker was\n\n2 Mr. Radovan Antic, who was the commander of the detachment, and also\n\n3 several members of the unit, people who raised certain issues, who wanted\n\n4 to know how the detachment would be organised and how the defence\n\n5 component of the 4th Detachment would develop. One of the speakers was\n\n6 also myself, and I've already spoken about that.\n\n7 Q. Obviously you were one of the speakers, and what did you\n\n8 emphasise? What messages did you convey to the members of the 4th\n\n9 Detachment? Was your goal to inform the people about the situation in the\n\n10 general area in the town of Samac?\n\n11 A. Absolutely. Already at that time, we had at our disposal\n\n12 information about several incidents that had happened and that had shown\n\n13 us that the situation, both in town and in the general area of Samac\n\n14 municipality, was getting more complex by the day. We mentioned all those\n\n15 incidents, and we wanted to show people how complex the situation was and\n\n16 what the final outcome of that situation might be. On the other hand, in\n\n17 the political and public life of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a very complex\n\n18 drama was evolving. There was an ethnic drift, and the parliamentary\n\n19 system in Bosnia and Herzegovina was blocked. Those incidents in our area\n\n20 deserved to be mentioned to the members of the unit. The underlying idea\n\n21 was to tell them that there was no other possibility for us to defend\n\n22 ourselves from the evil but to be united in our defence.\n\n23 Q. Thank you very much, Mr. Zaric. Let's move on to the question of\n\n24 providing information to the general public in Bosanski Samac, about the\n\n25 existence and the goals of the detachment.\n\nPage 19069\n\n1 Did any of you appear in the media or in meetings? Did any of you\n\n2 inform the general public about that?\n\n3 A. Yes, there were public appearances which took place in two ways.\n\n4 Firstly, there was an official information on behalf of the general\n\n5 secretariat for National Defence about a defence component, under the name\n\n6 of the 4th Detachment of the JNA, having been formed in Samac. It was\n\n7 said that this unit was organised and that it comprised of people from all\n\n8 ethnic groups. And the second way of conveying information was a round\n\n9 table, a public round table, in Radio Samac. I was one of the\n\n10 participants of that round table. I participated on behalf of the 4th\n\n11 Detachment. Another participant was Vinko Dragicevic, on behalf of the\n\n12 public security station. Commanders Antic participated on behalf of the\n\n13 4th Detachment. And I believe there was also Mr. Milos Bogdanovic, on\n\n14 behalf of the secretariat for National Defence. And we, as such, answered\n\n15 a number of people who phoned in and wanted to raise questions with that\n\n16 regard.\n\n17 Q. Slow down, Mr. Zaric. You said that there was a round table.\n\n18 Does that mean that you participated in radio shows and you talked about\n\n19 the existence of the 4th Detachment?\n\n20 A. Yes.\n\n21 Q. You said who were other participants in that show. What did you\n\n22 say on that show? What did you personally say? Did you again appeal and\n\n23 mention the need to be united?\n\n24 A. Yes. I did convey exactly that message. Unity was something that\n\n25 I always fostered, and whenever I appeared in public, I could not not\n\nPage 19070\n\n1 mention unity, because that's the only way I could talk. That was my life\n\n2 motive, unity of all peoples.\n\n3 Q. Thank you very much. Did you -- you always said that it was a\n\n4 live show. Does that mean that people could phone in, that listeners\n\n5 could directly ask questions to all the participants of the show?\n\n6 A. Yes, it could be done. There were some very delicate issues\n\n7 raised, because there had been a number of incidents that preceded that\n\n8 show. Some of those happened in Samac, Bosanski Brod, Orasje. And would\n\n9 we -- we could say in very honest terms, we would answer the questions,\n\n10 all of us, Mr. Antic, Mr. Dragicevic, and myself. We tried to answer all\n\n11 of these questions in a very honest manner.\n\n12 Q. Thank you very much. Mr. Zaric, did you appear at meetings of\n\n13 citizens on various occasions on behalf of the 4th Detachment of the JNA?\n\n14 A. Yes.\n\n15 Q. Can you tell us: How many such meetings did you attend, and how\n\n16 many times you appeared in such meetings.\n\n17 A. The majority of these meetings took place in the area of the town\n\n18 of Samac. Those were attended by members of the 4th Detachment. But I\n\n19 must also say that all of our public meetings could be attended by any\n\n20 citizen who was of military age. And listen to what we were talking\n\n21 about. We never kept anything concealed from the general public. We\n\n22 didn't -- we never refrained from talking about our goals. Many of the\n\n23 people who attended those meetings, we knew that they had already been\n\n24 members of some paramilitary units organised by their respective parties.\n\n25 But our message was always clear, and we always pointed out the things\n\nPage 19071\n\n1 that I have just spoken about. I want to say something else. Not only as\n\n2 a member of the 4th Detachment, but also as -- in other capacities, I\n\n3 participated in some peace rallies in Prud, Vojskova, and Kornica, and I\n\n4 had the opportunity to talk about that at those rallies. And my only goal\n\n5 was to defend the unity of the Yugoslav People's Army and the unity of\n\n6 those peoples who resided in the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\n7 Q. Very well, then. Thank you. I'm going to ask you a question. We\n\n8 will go back to this subject again at a later stage, but now I'd like to\n\n9 ask you this: Were there any meetings with the representatives of the\n\n10 Bosanski Samac local commune, and did you attend those meetings?\n\n11 A. Yes. There were very many such meetings and very many times I\n\n12 participated in those meetings.\n\n13 Q. Thank you very much. We'll come back to that later. And now\n\n14 let's move on to the political and security situation in Samac\n\n15 municipality during the period between the 1st of October, 1991, and the\n\n16 17th of April, 1992. We're talking about the period of time between the\n\n17 1st of October, 1991, and the 17th of April, 1992. Can you give us a\n\n18 short overview of that situation in Samac municipality, and then we will\n\n19 go into details of various events that occurred during that period of\n\n20 time.\n\n21 A. I can say that during that period between the 1st of October and\n\n22 the outbreak of conflicts, because of various incidents that were taking\n\n23 place from Bosanski Brod to Brcko, that part of Posavina was a little\n\n24 Beirut, and especially Samac. When I say Beirut, I mean that there were\n\n25 almost daily sabotage and terrorist actions of all sorts, which\n\nPage 19072\n\n1 jeopardised the political and security situation and contributed towards\n\n2 the political polarisation in the territory of Posavina and in the general\n\n3 area of Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\n4 Q. Very well, then. As far as you can remember, which sabotage\n\n5 actions by their force and by their consequences made the situation more\n\n6 complex? What sabotage actions took place?\n\n7 A. I don't know how fair it is going to be, but I would like to\n\n8 inform the Honourable Chamber what happened before the 1st of October.\n\n9 There were two situations which I believe were relevant. Before I was\n\n10 retired, there was one incident in July, and the other one was in August,\n\n11 immediately before I was retired. So I'm talking about the time when I\n\n12 was still the active chief of the service.\n\n13 The first incident took place in the village of Obudovac, the\n\n14 largest Serbian village in the territory of Samac municipality. We learnt\n\n15 about an illegal operation of smuggling of hunting rifles. The\n\n16 intelligence was gathered together with the state security and the public\n\n17 security services, and we arrived at the conclusion that these hunting\n\n18 rifles were bought and resold for material gain. They were not bought to\n\n19 serve as a deterrent against anybody or as -- in order to threaten\n\n20 somebody. Those rifles were bought at hundred German marks and sold at\n\n21 two or three hundred German marks. This was published in the security\n\n22 bulletin of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and it went down with a bang, and a huge\n\n23 security impact was given to that case. And I have just told you the way\n\n24 I saw that incident. It was nothing but a small-scale smuggling.\n\n25 The second security incident took place at the end of August, when\n\nPage 19073\n\n1 an illegal contingent of weapons arrived in Modrica. This was organised\n\n2 by the HDZ, and the weapons were produced in the Djuro Djakovic company in\n\n3 Slavonski Brod. These weapons were Zagi automatic weapon, and the Sokac\n\n4 automatic weapon. Zagi and Sokac were their popular names.\n\n5 Through my network of associates, I managed to break this\n\n6 smuggling canal on the other side in Kladari, Garevac villages, in the\n\n7 territory of Modrica municipality, these were things were supposed to be\n\n8 given to the HOS paramilitary formation. Those were the Croatian defence\n\n9 forces which were based in the Republic of Croatia and their commander was\n\n10 Dobrislav Paraga. I must say that at that point in time, when we were\n\n11 able to intercept this operation, something happened in our service and\n\n12 this was interrupted. I was very angry. I reacted to that at our meeting\n\n13 in Doboj. And I'm not saying that this was the only reason, but certainly\n\n14 one of the reasons for which I was forced to retire prematurely.\n\n15 Q. Okay. Very well, then, Mr. Zaric. Let's go back to my original\n\n16 question, and that was about the sabotage actions that took place in Samac\n\n17 municipality during the period between the 1st of October and the 17th\n\n18 of -- that is, the 1st of October, 1991, and the 17th of April, 1992.\n\n19 What sabotage operations or actions took place during that time, and what\n\n20 happened next?\n\n21 A. There were a number of those sabotage actions, one worse than the\n\n22 other. The first such sabotage actions took place at the very beginning\n\n23 of December 1991. I'm not going to draw any inferences. That should be\n\n24 the task of somebody else. But at the beginning of December, a special\n\n25 unit of the Ministry of the Interior of Bosnia-Herzegovina arrived in the\n\nPage 19074\n\n1 territory of Samac. Their commanders were Besirevic, Safet and Hodzic\n\n2 Ragib and they arrived on the 2nd of December, and they had about a\n\n3 hundred specials with them, all members of the Ministry of the Interior.\n\n4 Their task was primarily to provide security for the bridge on the Sava\n\n5 River. At that time, that was the only possibility to cross the Sava\n\n6 River and that was the only connection between the Republic of Croatia and\n\n7 Bosnia-Herzegovina. And their task was also to look after the security\n\n8 component in the territory of the municipalities of Samac and Odzak.\n\n9 (redacted)\n\n10 (redacted)\n\n11 (redacted) . Maybe if the Trial\n\n12 Chamber will allow me, I can mention their names in a closed session.\n\n13 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Your Honours, could we briefly go\n\n14 into closed session so that the names of these people around mentioned.\n\n15 JUDGE MUMBA: I think we can go in private session, yes.\n\n16 [Private session]\n\n17 (redacted)\n\n18 (redacted)\n\n19 (redacted)\n\n20 (redacted)\n\n21 (redacted)\n\n22 (redacted)\n\n23 (redacted)\n\n24 (redacted)\n\n25 (redacted)\n\nPage 19075\n\n1 (redacted)\n\n2 (redacted)\n\n3 (redacted)\n\n4 (redacted)\n\n5 (redacted)\n\n6 (redacted)\n\n7 (redacted)\n\n8 (redacted)\n\n9 (redacted)\n\n10 (redacted)\n\n11 (redacted)\n\n12 (redacted)\n\n13 (redacted)\n\n14 (redacted)\n\n15 (redacted)\n\n16 (redacted)\n\n17 (redacted)\n\n18 (redacted)\n\n19 (redacted)\n\n20 (redacted)\n\n21 (redacted)\n\n22 (redacted)\n\n23 (redacted)\n\n24 [Open session]\n\n25 THE REGISTRAR: We are in open session.\n\nPage 19076\n\n1 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n2 Q. Mr. Zaric, were there any other privately owned buildings that\n\n3 were blown up in the municipality of Samac?\n\n4 A. In December, December was a month during which many incidents\n\n5 occurred, both private and public incidents. As far as I can remember, on\n\n6 the 9th of December, the nuclear shelter in the Hranaprodukt food factory\n\n7 was destroyed and there were over 540 missiles, anti-hail missiles there.\n\n8 Kapetanovic's summer house was destroyed, which was located in the\n\n9 direction of Tursinovac. It was outside the Samac area. On the 14th of\n\n10 February, the business premises of Muharem Bajraktarevic was destroyed.\n\n11 He's a Muslim from Samac. It was a building that hadn't been completed.\n\n12 Explosives were planted there and damage was inflicted on that building.\n\n13 And on the same day, a little later, that notorious incident in the\n\n14 Valentino Cafe occurred.\n\n15 JUDGE WILLIAMS: Excuse me, Mr. Zaric. I just want to just\n\n16 clarify one thing. It might be a matter of translation. On page 54,\n\n17 lines 18 to 21, Mr. Zaric's answer speaks about the nuclear shelter in the\n\n18 Hranaprodukt food factory was destroyed and there were over 540 missiles\n\n19 there. Is that correct? It just reads a little oddly to me. Maybe you\n\n20 could clarify with Mr. Zaric, Mr. Pisarevic.\n\n21 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation] Yes, of course.\n\n22 Q. Mr. Zaric, you have heard Judge Williams' question. Missiles,\n\n23 rockets were mentioned. It's obvious that -- what sort of rockets are at\n\n24 stake, the ones that were located in the nuclear shelter in the food\n\n25 company?\n\nPage 19077\n\n1 A. These are anti-hail missiles, rockets. That is their name. These\n\n2 are rockets that are used if there's a ferocious storm. These rockets are\n\n3 launched from launch pads in order to disperse the clouds and to prevent\n\n4 the storm from inflicting damage on the city. In wartime conditions, when\n\n5 these rockets are placed on launch pads, they only perform a psychological\n\n6 role. Their purpose is to frighten people. Because when you put them one\n\n7 next to the other, you have the impression that what is involved is a\n\n8 multiple rocket launcher. So this was one of the biggest and most modern\n\n9 nuclear shelters in the municipality of Samac. It was a new factory, and\n\n10 in that nuclear shelter, that's what it was called, there were over 540\n\n11 anti-hail missiles, anti-hail rockets. And there is one other thing that\n\n12 I should inform Judge Williams of. When the explosion occurred, it was\n\n13 terrible to observe, because Samac was practically covered by cloud.\n\n14 Those rockets don't -- aren't fired all at once, but in succession. They\n\n15 can't all be fired at once. They are fired in succession. So you can\n\n16 imagine when 540-odd rockets exploded, it was something that was quite\n\n17 frightening for the people who observed the event, and this factory was\n\n18 located on the outskirts of the town, at a certain distances from the\n\n19 centre.\n\n20 JUDGE WILLIAMS: Thank you.\n\n21 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n22 Q. Could we just be a little more precise about those rockets. In\n\n23 fact, these rockets used for weather purposes, meteorological rockets; is\n\n24 that correct?\n\n25 A. Yes.\n\nPage 19078\n\n1 Q. Very well. Were buildings damaged, bridges, power lines, and so\n\n2 on?\n\n3 A. In December, as far as I know, several power lines were destroyed.\n\n4 One of the biggest power lines was near the bridge, in the immediate\n\n5 vicinity of the bridge over the Sava, and it was guarded by the special\n\n6 police units from Sarajevo. And on that same evening, Nedic Marko's\n\n7 disco, called Miler was destroyed. It's on the main road from Samac to\n\n8 the village of Obudovac. The second power line that was destroyed was in\n\n9 the direction of Lugovi. It is sort of an agricultural location and in a\n\n10 certain sense all the Serbian villages were cut off. I don't want to go\n\n11 into the details, but Mr. Alija Fitozovic has testified about this in very\n\n12 clear terms.\n\n13 Q. Very well. Were there any other events in the seriousness of\n\n14 which contributed to a feeling of insecurity and which contributed to\n\n15 divisions among the people, et cetera?\n\n16 A. In February, I think - I don't know whether it was on the 4th or\n\n17 the 5th of February, but it was one of those two days, that is\n\n18 certain - significant damage was inflicted on the bridge over the River\n\n19 Sava, and that was the only functioning bridge at the time that connected\n\n20 the Republic of Croatia with Bosnia-Herzegovina. And what is very\n\n21 indicative, in my opinion, with regard to the destruction of this bridge\n\n22 is the fact that it was blown up at 8.45 in the morning. And before that\n\n23 time, the chief of the police, of the public security service, stopped\n\n24 traffic on both sides of the bridge. That is when the explosion occurred.\n\n25 Fortunately, no significant casualties, and the media in\n\nPage 19079\n\n1 Bosnia-Herzegovina condemned the behaviour of Chief Dragicevic and those\n\n2 who were guarding that bridge. They characterised this act in very\n\n3 particular terms.\n\n4 MR. LAZAREVIC: Just one small clarification to give sense to what\n\n5 we have here as the answer of Mr. Zaric: \"And before that time, at 8.00.\"\n\n6 There is one part of the sentence missing here. So 45 minutes before it\n\n7 happened, the police stopped traffic to the bridge.\n\n8 JUDGE MUMBA: Yes. Mr. Zaric, maybe you can go over that slowly\n\n9 so that it's correctly recorded.\n\n10 THE ACCUSED ZARIC: [Interpretation] When the explosion occurred on\n\n11 the 5th of February, according to the information I had, the explosion\n\n12 took place at 8.45 in the morning, and at 8.00 in the morning the chief of\n\n13 security ordered that there should no longer be any traffic over the\n\n14 bridge. There is a written report, a communique, about this, because a\n\n15 commission from the Ministry of the Interior of Bosnia-Herzegovina came to\n\n16 carry out an on-site investigation to determine how this occurred. And I\n\n17 was in a position to see that document. And the media provided their own\n\n18 interpretation of the event.\n\n19 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n20 Q. Were there any other events which contributed to rendering the\n\n21 situation in the municipality of Bosanski Samac more complex? Were any\n\n22 buildings damaged at the Orthodox cemetery, were there patrols of any kind\n\n23 in the town of Samac? What happened to the Valentino Cafe? Tell us a\n\n24 little more about these events.\n\n25 A. On the 27th of January, 1992, on one of the most significant\n\nPage 19080\n\n1 religious events for the Orthodox people, St. Sava, the Orthodox chapel\n\n2 was blown up, in the Orthodox cemetery. This chapel was used when someone\n\n3 was brought there to be buried. The people were very much embittered by\n\n4 this event, all the more so in that this occurred on that religious day,\n\n5 and the public didn't fail to comment on this. I mentioned Mr. Safet\n\n6 Besirevic and Ragib Hodzic. According to reliable information that I had\n\n7 when I was involved in these duties, I knew that they were instructors in\n\n8 the Patriotic League of Bosnia and Herzegovina, headed by Sefer Halilovic.\n\n9 They spent more time on the premises of the Party of Democratic Action,\n\n10 more time there than on the premises of the Ministry of the Interior, and\n\n11 they were very often there with Mr. Alija Fitozovic. And from February\n\n12 onwards, they -- from February onwards, Muslim patrols started patrolling\n\n13 the town. Their purpose was allegedly to protect buildings owned by\n\n14 Muslims. This was an issue that was often discussed at the Crisis Staff\n\n15 of the local commune, and I too participated in these discussions on\n\n16 behalf of the 4th Detachment, representatives for all the political\n\n17 parties in the town and at the municipality level also participated,\n\n18 representatives of the police, the ministry of the defence, and I know\n\n19 that Mr. Sulejman Tihic was in favour of the legitimacy of these SDA\n\n20 patrols. And my opinion at these meetings was that this should be done by\n\n21 having recourse to the reserve police force. And those were the\n\n22 differences that we had. I didn't think that it should be done. On a\n\n23 private basis, I thought that there should be mixed patrols of the reserve\n\n24 police force. However --\n\n25 Q. Mr. Zaric, we will address these issues later on, but at the\n\nPage 19081\n\n1 moment we are discussing the events that made the political and security\n\n2 situation in the municipality of Samac more complex, from the 1st of\n\n3 October -- from the 2nd of October until the 16th or 17th of April, 1992.\n\n4 Were there any other events that gave some significance and contributed to\n\n5 endangering the security and political situation and the relations between\n\n6 ethnic groups, not only in the town of Samac but also in the municipality\n\n7 itself?\n\n8 A. Perhaps I went off on a tangent when I wanted to speak of these\n\n9 patrols, but it is because the military police, on one occasion, in March,\n\n10 disarmed one such patrol, one such SDA patrol, not far from the Mebos\n\n11 factory. That was a reason allegedly to erect barricades and to prohibit\n\n12 anyone else entering the town. The Party of Democratic Action was\n\n13 responsible for organising the erection of these barricades and this\n\n14 action was led by Mr. Alija Fitozovic, and he has confirmed this fact in\n\n15 his testimony before this Trial Chamber. But the barricades themselves\n\n16 contributed to a certain security situation which was negative in the\n\n17 town.\n\n18 Q. Tell me: Where were these barricades erected?\n\n19 A. At the two main entrances to the town of Samac, although there\n\n20 was, so to speak, an additional third barricade. But as far as the first\n\n21 two are concerned, one was placed when you enter Bosanski Samac from the\n\n22 direction of Nedrici [phoen]. It was by the Mebos factory, at the\n\n23 entrance to the Mebos factory, by the brick factory. And the second\n\n24 barricade was at the crossroads near Uzarija, which you would approach\n\n25 from Orasje and Obudovac, via the main road. So from that direction, no\n\nPage 19082\n\n1 Serbs or members of other peoples were allowed to enter the town.\n\n2 MR. LAZAREVIC: If I can just have one small clarification. On\n\n3 page 60, line 7, there was an additional third entrance. Mr. Zaric was\n\n4 referring to the entrances to the town of Samac, not to the third\n\n5 barricade. So the barricades were placed on two entrances, and a third\n\n6 one was free.\n\n7 MR. PISAREVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n8 Q. Mr. Zaric, could you tell us about the third entrance to Samac,\n\n9 where there were no barricades.\n\n10 A. That was an entrance that went in the direction of the village of\n\n11 Prud, over the bridge over the River Bosna and towards my place of birth,\n\n12 the village of Trnjak. At the time there were no barricades on the\n\n13 bridge. But the reserve police of the HDZ was on that side and guarded\n\n14 the bridge.\n\n15 Q. Tell me: You said the reserve police, didn't you?\n\n16 A. Yes.\n\n17 Q. Tell me: Who were the people who manned those barricades?\n\n18 A. As far as I know, the people manning the barricades were mainly\n\n19 Muslims, and there was a lower number of Croats.\n\n20 Q. The people manning those barricades, did they have automatic\n\n21 weapons, military weapons?\n\n22 A. Yes. They were armed. In addition to the obstructions they had\n\n23 on the road, they used buses, passenger vehicles, and it wasn't possible\n\n24 to pass by them. Quite a few of them were under the influence of alcohol.\n\n25 And fortunately, there were no serious incidents after the intervention of\n\nPage 19083\n\n1 certain political bodies in the town. And Mr. Nikolic, the commander of\n\n2 the 17th Tactical Group was spoken to about that matter by\n\n3 Mr. Izo Izetbegovic. After these conversations, there were no significant\n\n4 incidents.\n\n5 Q. Do you remember, did you ever hear anything about barricades being\n\n6 established at the entrance to the town of Samac?\n\n7 A. No. That was the first time. What makes this situation more\n\n8 complex with regard to the barricades is the fact and the reliable\n\n9 information that we had, according to which at the time\n\n10 Mr. Alija Fitozovic had linked those barricades to the mobilisation of\n\n11 paramilitary formations which were located in Croatian local communes\n\n12 alone, and that fact, in my opinion, represented a far greater danger than\n\n13 the fact that teams of alcoholised and irresponsible people claimed the\n\n14 right to decide who could enter the town and who could not enter the town.\n\n15 Q. Mr. Zaric, did the 4th Detachment take any action to remove these\n\n16 barricades, and did you inform Commander Stevan Nikolic, the commander of\n\n17 the 17th Tactical Group, of the fact that these barricades had been\n\n18 erected?\n\n19 A. Well, the role of the 4th Detachment was for me to inform\n\n20 Commander Antic, Commander Nikolic, and I had to inform Makso Simeunovic\n\n21 that the town had been -- was under a blockade, and we were immediately\n\n22 informed that the 4th Detachment should not get involved in that, by no\n\n23 means. We were told that this was a matter for the police. It was for\n\n24 them to deal with that, for them and the political organs, and we\n\n25 shouldn't think of doing anything. Commander Antic respected this order,\n\nPage 19084\n\n1 so that the 4th Detachment didn't play any role in removing these\n\n2 barricades, apart from this information, this report I have mentioned.\n\n3 Q. Thank you. Can you remember the names of some of the men who were\n\n4 involved in these barricades?\n\n5 A. Suljic Jadranko was involved in this, Ibrahim Salkic, also known\n\n6 as Ibela, Mesmic Osman [phoen], known as Buca, Dragan"
