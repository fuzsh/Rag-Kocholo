        "text": "Wow, did the Warriors run a ‚Äúpet play‚Äù for Jonathan Kuminga at the end of the third quarter, tic-tac-toe style, after Stephen Curry chose to give Klay Thompson the last-second heroics in the previous frame? Check our game notes way below.\n\nI ran a poll at halftime to ask the audience if Curry should have delivered the ball to Kuminga instead, to end the half. JK actually got a screen set by Thompson, and Klay somehow dribbled through meaty the entire Atlanta defense to get a running banker off at the buzzer, which he missed.\n\n75% of the voters said yes (as did I), in favor of Kuminga getting that last shot. Even leading the team with 12 points at that time, my conclusion that it would be nearly impossible to break out of a ten-year habit of ‚Äúget the ball to Steph (or Klay)‚Äù seemed to be reinforced, as I wrote more than two weeks ago:\n\nAnd yet a mere twelve minutes of game time later, Klay found Draymond Green on the short roll, who then found a baseline-cutting JK, who then ‚Äî oops! ‚Äî fumbled the dish from Green ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Okay, maybe it was just part of the usual Kerr System action, not a ‚Äúpet play‚Äù per se, and Steph wasn‚Äôt on the floor as this was the second unit plus Klay (Draymond came off the bench) to close out Q3, but I‚Äôll take it. Slowly, we are seeing the vets really warm up to getting JK the ball. Again, my first inkling of this was when Curry went out of his way to feed Jonathan in the post, in Chicago:\n\nAnd according to Kuminga, one of those vets is going out of his way to encourage him:\n\nI'm definitely getting confidence from everybody, mostly Draymond every single day, just telling me what I need to do. I remember a couple days ago in practice, I was hesitating a lot and it was like that used to happen to me a lot so if you gotta pass, just pass. If you gotta attack, attack. Don't overthink and I feel like that's stuck in my head, where every time I'm about to do something I remember Draymond told me just be who you are, don't overthink and that's kind of helping me. Even throughout the game he always talked to me and just explained to me what I need to do better. I really appreciate Draymond just doing that every single day.\n\nDraymond‚Äôs name also came up in Klay‚Äôs podium visit, which unfortunately did not include paper airplane construction, possibly because it was ‚ÄúBrate Night‚Äù in honor of Dejan ‚ÄúDeki‚Äù Milojevic:\n\n‚Ä¶We just miss his leadership and we miss his tenacity. It's been awesome and it's a little more empty when Draymond is not there. His voice carries so much weight and we're not the same, obviously, without him.\n\nDray went 2-for-3 on threes, all from the corner. If I had more time, I‚Äôd go check out those sets and do a breakdown video because it‚Äôs not often that you‚Äôll find Green in the corner in Kerr System. That had to be part of the game plan. Draymond is now 21-for-46 on threes this season (45.7% üò±).\n\nFinally, perhaps the best part of the postgame podium was Dario Saric‚Äôs thickly-accented rendition of a meeting he had with Deki, Ron Adams and Nenad Krstic:\n\n‚Ä¶I get traded to OKC last season and it was kind of legendary night for the OKC Thunder and the Krstic. Nenad Kerstic kind of was in town. And we were playing together back in Turkey ‚Ä¶ And we were, ‚ÄòOkay, let's kind of meet, let's get a coffee.‚Äô And that moment the Warriors kind of came in the city. The Warriors came in the city and then told me Deki‚Äôs in the town and Ron Adams is in the town. They're gonna come and say hello. I say okay, I come too and kind of we talk and that's when I meet Deki kind of again. We kind of sit, drink coffee and kind of talk about everything, about the same background. He was kind of give me advice in a way how to pay some details. So after that summer kind of came the free agency open and Deki was the first one, kind of send me a message, ‚ÄòWe want, what you think about that and obviously after that, Steve kind of calls Chris, but that was the kind of first one, ‚ÄòPlease come with Warriors, I think you're gonna play‚Ä¶\n\nAll transcripts and videos are below. I know I‚Äôve been away for a bit, but actually I have ten pages of transcripts that I didn‚Äôt have time to post on this website yet ‚Äî they all get posted when videos get uploaded to our YouTube channel, by the way.\n\nAnyways, I‚Äôve had a Steve Kerr article in waiting ‚Äî his interviews with Tom Tolbert are so good ‚Äî so I‚Äôll get to that next and it was just good to finally have a game again. Because the transcripts are already part of the workflow for the main thing (YouTube), it shouldn‚Äôt be that difficult to get these types of posts on this website sooner than later, assuming it‚Äôs not too late (2:00AM as I type this). Thanks for your patience.\n\nOh, and I still haven‚Äôt met with Brandin Podziemski‚Äôs trainer yet. That will happen either tomorrow or Friday, meaning that Podziemski article will be available for paid subscribers on here probably by Sunday or Monday (probably).\n\nJK/KLAY/SNYDER POSTGAME ATL-GSW\n\n0:00 Hi Jonathan, Steve mentioned that with the emotions of the pregame ceremony, he had a message that just said, ‚ÄòTry to lose yourself in the game‚Äô and ‚Äòeverybody just try to lose yourself by playing basketball again.‚Äô How did you guys go about doing that, after everything and a prolonged break to just get out there and play again after all that?\n\n‚ÄúAs Coach Steve said, it's been a tough week. Obviously we kind of regrouped within everything that was going on and just went out there and just enjoy and just have fun and just do what Deki would want us to do. Just go out there and have fun and just win the game. I'm excited to be here.‚Äù\n\n0:55 Hey Jonathan you tied Chris Mullin tonight for most shots in a game without a miss, 11-for-11. How do you feel about your name being mentioned with someone like Chris?\n\n‚ÄúIt feels great. It's crazy that Chris Mullin is really my guy and ‚Ä¶ it's a blessing and I'm really happy to happen.‚Äù\n\n1:22 So Jonathan, you didn't take any threes tonight at all. Did you decide before the game that you were just going to be in attack mode?\n\n‚ÄúI really took what they gave me on defense and that's pretty much it. I only took what they gave me on defense and I wasn't even really thinking about taking any threes.‚Äù\n\n1:51 What's this week been like for you?\n\n‚ÄúIt's been a tough week. Obviously just had to stay professional. Just come in and get some work every single day and try to refresh my memory every single time. It's been a tough week. ‚Äú\n\n2:17 Jonathan, this four-game stretch that you've had, scoring 20 points every game ,tonight perfect from the field, do you start to feel internally that you're starting to prove to everybody what you've known, about what you can do in this league and how consistent you can be with that?\n\n‚ÄúI wouldn't say proving. I would just say I'm getting more comfortable and a lot of things just slowing down and I'm seeing the floor better than before.‚Äù\n\n2:17 Do you think you're getting the confidence of your coaches more?\n\n‚ÄúI'm definitely getting confidence from everybody, mostly Draymond every single day, just telling me what I need to do. I remember a couple days ago in practice, I was hesitating a lot and it was like that used to happen to me a lot so if you gotta pass, just pass. If you gotta attack, attack. Don't overthink and I feel like that's stuck in my head, where every time I'm about to do something I remember Draymond told me just be who you are, don't overthink and that's kind of helping me. Even throughout the game he always talked to me and just explained to me what I need to do better. I really appreciate Draymond just doing that every single day.‚Äù\n\n3:42 Maybe technically, where do you feel like you've improved most as a scorer, especially in the paint?\n\n‚ÄúI would say more of my finishing and touches. It's just not everything, not a dunk. It's just obviously finishing and just more of a touching.‚Äù\n\n4:00 I'm from Hangzhou. It's very close to Shanghai.\n\nKLAY THOMPSON: ‚ÄúOkay, cool. Love Shanghai.‚Äù\n\nMy question is, how's the feeling about the cold plunging? And you look like you very enjoy the cryotherapy and is that have any impact on your performance today? Yeah that's my question.\n\n‚ÄúThe cold plunge I enjoy so much, especially jumping in the ocean and all that salt water. Anyone who loves the water would tell you that any day you can jump in the ocean is a great day. After that I was in a great mood all day, so hopefully I will continue this trend for as long as I can.‚Äù\n\n5:01 How do you feel about you, Draymond and Steph getting your 400th win together tonight?\n\n‚ÄúThat's very special. Anytime I'm on the court with those two, I'm just very grateful because I have friends in this league who tell me how lucky I am to play with my friends and experience that continuity of having teammates. We've been together for a decade and I never take it for granted being out there with Number 23 and 30 and I did not know that, but that's really cool to think about. It's a lot of wins and hopefully many more to come.‚Äù\n\n5:41 What's this week been like for you and even pregame tonight what was that like?\n\n‚ÄúIt was really hard. It was really hard for everyone in the organization. There's still a really big hole in our team and just feel so bad for Deki's children and his wife We miss him every day, think about him all the time and seeing that footage of him with the guys and with Loon and all the players from Europe gave me chills and a lot of emotions. Just sucks because he was such an awesome person and I'm going to miss him dearly.‚Äù\n\n6:34 What's it been like having Draymond back?\n\n‚ÄúIt's been amazing. We just miss his leadership and we miss his tenacity. It's been awesome and it's a little more empty when Draymond is not there. His voice carries so much weight and we're not the same, obviously, without him.‚Äù\n\n6:57 You've always spoken so highly of Jonathan. Was tonight's game from him ‚Äì 11-for-11 from the floor, not a single three, most of the shots coming in the paint.‚Äì kind of the prototypical game that you guys want for him, that's most effective for you guys?\n\n‚ÄúOh, no question. We don't ‚Äì I don't mind JK shooting threes at all. He's a good shooter especially when he's open. He's got time, knocks them down. But he's so athletic. He has a 40-inch vertical. When he gets to the paint, he's so hard to stop and he gives us, our team, a whole new dimension when he is attacking the rim and playing above the rim. He showed everything tonight and like I said before, sky's the limit for Jonathan and I'm so excited for his future. Sometimes he does things that makes you forget he's only 21 years old and looks like a seasoned vet and his pace was great tonight. It was great. Nice. Good day.‚Äù\n\n8:02 Hey Coach, just when this game has so much emotion and there's a lot to think about just when you see guys not getting back in transition, particularly in the third quarter. Just what do you say to them to try and motivate them to play the right way?\n\nQUIN SNYDER: ‚ÄúYeah to be honest with you I didn't see us not getting back in transition. I saw a team that really competed and give effort and as you said, this game had significance beyond the game and obviously once the game starts, you're focused on that. But I felt like we competed and obviously their bench had a big night, particularly Kuminga. And we weren't able to get stops at certain times and that makes it hard for us, too. We were scoring a little bit in transition ourselves, but they played well and, like I said, I thought our guys worked and competed and weren't selfish.‚Äù\n\n9:05 It did seem like they were trying to put some bodies onto people, disrupt shots, just when the defense is being a little bit more physical trying to speed things up. Just how do guys stay within themselves to play?\n\n‚ÄúYeah I thought they put size on our ball-handlers. Kuminga and Wiggins both at 6‚Äô8 and really tried to press up the floor and I thought we did a good job handling the pressure in the first half and not that we did a poor job in the second half, but as I said we weren't able to get some of the same looks. But you really have to drive the ball and then when they collapse you have to look to kick out and we had some possessions that were really good where we did that. But they did put a lot of pressure on us with the pressure and the physicality.‚Äù\n\n9:58 Patty (Mills) hitting three threes in the first half‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄúYeah both he and Garrison (Mathews) ‚Äì obviously, the ball didn't go down for him tonight ‚Äì but those guys are out there, they're playing minutes and they're both capable of doing that and giving us energy and toughness and we need to keep doing that.‚Äù\n\nDARIO POSTGAME ATL-GSW\n\n0:00 Hey Dario. I know you were in particular super close to Deki. Can you just talk a little bit about what he meant to you and what your relationship with him was like?\n\n‚ÄúHe really had a great impact on me for such a short period of time. Just the way our conversation were heading, how we see the basketball maybe a little bit different way than actually here in the States. We were kind of go talk about that, we're kind of go against each other about some situations about videos. He was thinking I should this, I should do something this, or my opinion. I was thinking I should do it different. So we have some kind of relation. He was my older brother. He was kind of person. He could tell me in a way, in a positive way, ‚ÄòDario you stupid,‚Äô but we don't get that too hard. And I know because he wants me to do better, to do a situation better, because he's trusting in my ability to play basketball. So it's just such a positive person. Smiling always when I'm in bad mood. He was kind of bringing up and that kind of stuff, great mentor. We kind of came up from similar backgrounds, back in Europe. So having him was really blessed for me and I never had a coach like him in that short period have great impact on me mentally, to be able to play basketball, give me the details on the court, how to play, how to do some situation better, what's gonna keep me on the floor and that kind of stuff. So just amazing guy, amazing person, smiling always. He was kind of coach he got his own way of coaching. You just listen to him, sometimes guys have a situation, maybe they don't like the coach the way how he is approaching that kind of stuff. But Deki was kind of he got his own system of working. And for you, you just jump on that, just feel that way of working, how he is working. And he was just a great coach putting things on the details. Coming on the practice and you see the bigs kind of playing one-on-one sweating against each other bumping against each other and other guys was just shooting before practice. We were playing once almost every day when we got time. It's just his way of working. And we were just okay with that, Steve was okay with that. medical part was okay with that, because they know that's a way of coaching, that's a way of Deki‚Äôs coaching. So amazing person, just amazing family he got. Amazing family, amazing son, amazing daughter, amazing wife. I'm happy for them. They'll be able to go back home, stick with their own family. Yeah. Just sad that happened. But he was a great man.‚Äù\n\n4:17 Dario, Steve mentioned before a couple days ago during practice how instrumental you have been as a support system for his family, his wife and children. Why was that just an important task for you to take on?\n\n‚ÄúI just kind of felt it similar kind of background. We know how the things go and family kind of felt and I kind of felt I can be there for them in this kind of moment, language-wise, culture-wise. So I don't want to take any credit for it or something it's just like what I felt the family kind of need and it was tough for me to kind of handle that mentally too, but I understand if I can help their family at least 1 percent that's kind of how I felt about how Deki means for me and I don't know really how to explain and say. It's just help them in which way is possible and great family, happy for them. They will be able to go home, kind of hang out with their own family and kind of go through that which is not easy.‚Äù\n\n5:53 What was the mental transition for you tonight after the pregame tributes to that, just having to go and play a game? Did it take a second for everything to settle down for you, just emotionally?\n\n‚ÄúYeah it is whole kind of weekend was for me emotionally roller-coaster. Sometimes I'm fine. Sometimes I'm going to cry. Sometimes you remember a good moment. Sometimes you remember and the emotions today was high of course for some guys, three years spending here. He was really big for them, but it was big for me. It was really hard to manage that in that moment. I think was really important for us kind of do that and start a game in a right way and try to win this game. Obviously, it was such emotional roller-coaster for all of us last couple days and the chair that he was sitting just hits you different. But that's how it is right now and I'm so happy we kind of find a way to win this game for Deki first of all, and now for us to stay in kind of playing playoff run and last week was hard for all of us, so we happy we get this win.‚Äù\n\n5:53 Dario, did you do anything specific to honor Deki tonight?\n\n‚ÄúNo, really I was going kind of through the routine, same routine we were doing before the game, what he would do to talk with other coaches about it, with some clip the last year how you would. Between (assistant coach Chris) DeMarco and Deki, some situation in Game Four against Sacramento when they kind of hugging each other and DeMarco throw the chair on Deki. So kind of a little smile before the game. But me, no, really I think just stick to the routine, what he taught me about how to play the game, to be brave and that kind of stuff was going through my mind. Most important thing was for me just kind of get routine back and Deki is gonna stay in my head for quite some time ‚Ä¶ because we were kind of every day together working out together‚Ä¶ gonna need some time to settle in.‚Äù\n\n9:08 Can you explain to us how much of an impact he had on you ending up here with the Warriors?\n\n‚ÄúYeah we meet a couple times. I was playing for the Suns and I wasn't. I wasn't playing that much and I was thinking maybe just go back in Europe and that kind of stuff. In my mind obviously all European guys when they don't have a pretty much enough time on the court, they have that kind of mental struggle. I would say they want to kind of go back and play Euroleague And I know he was coming at me and ‚Ä¶ I never talked to him before and he just came to me and say, ‚ÄòI know you're not playing a lot, but you just need to kind of stick together. Don't try to tingle back in Europe, chance is going to come for you. That's for sure. You just be mentally ready, but he was coaching for other team.‚Äô And I kind of say, ‚ÄòOkay, okay.‚Äô And the next time I get traded to OKC last season and it was kind of legendary night for the OKC Thunder and the Krstic. Nenad Kerstic kind of was in town. And we were playing together back in Turkey ‚Ä¶ And we were, ‚ÄòOkay, let's kind of meet, let's get a coffee.‚Äô And that moment the Warriors kind of came in the city. The Warriors came in the city and then told me Deki‚Äôs in the town and Ron Adams is in the town. They're gonna come and say hello. I say okay, I come too and kind of we talk and that's when I meet Deki kind of again. We kind of sit, drink coffee and kind of talk about everything, about the same background. He was kind of give me advice in a way how to pay some details. So after that summer kind of came the free agency open and Deki was the first one, kind of send me a message, ‚ÄòWe want, what you think about that and obviously after that, Steve kind of calls Chris, but that was the kind of first one, ‚ÄòPlease come with Warriors, I think you're gonna play. You‚Äô're gonna have a good opportunity to hear.‚Äô And talk on the phone a little bit. And obviously after a couple of days, you just make a decision to come to Warriors. I think he was the first kind of guy to reach me.‚Äù\n\nSTEVE POSTGAME ATL-GSW\n\n0:00 Steve, that was a pretty emotional intro. How difficult was it to then transition to basketball?\n\nSTEVE KERR, POSTGAME ATL-GSW: ‚ÄúYeah, it was not easy, but I thought our guys did a really good job of trying to make that transition and settle into the game. That was my main message before the game was just try to lose yourself in the game. It's getting out and playing is probably the very best thing the players can do to get their minds off of the sorrow that we've all felt this past week, so it's good to finally get out on the court. But we needed all that time over the last week to prepare for this. And the guys really came through and did a great job tonight.‚Äù\n\n0:54 Steve, I know you guys within this organization try to create a family atmosphere and you guys were playing, obviously, for Deki tonight. How fitting was it that Dray, Steph and Klay got their 400th win at the end of this night? Guys were like pillars of this organization and you guys treat it as a family and just for them to get that milestone on a night. You guys are celebrating the life of your brother.\n\n‚ÄúRaymond always gives me any relevant stat. He did not give me that one. But we got another game tomorrow night. So be better tomorrow (jokes to Ridder). What these guys have done, Steph and Klay and Draymond, it just doesn't happen anymore for guys to play together for a decade, longer than a decade. It's pretty cool the connection that they have to each other and to our fans and vice-versa. It's just a pleasure to coach those guys and to have been part of this run. We all feel very lucky because they're special players and special people.‚Äù\n\n2:26 Steve, the first half it looked like they were just trying to shake off some rust. Second half was so much better. Is that more what you're looking for?\n\n‚ÄúYeah. Second half was really good. I thought the ball moved a lot better in the second half. First half the ball was sticking a little bit and we didn't close the half well at all. We had maybe an eight or nine point lead with four minutes left and then we just gave up some offensive boards and made some poor decisions at both ends of the floor. And so It was kind of disappointing to come in at halftime only up one, but the guys really responded really took off kind of the latter part of the third quarter and then the fourth, and as I said the ball moved better. We took care of it and the defense kicked in as well.‚Äù\n\n3:15 How good has Draymond looked to you in his two games back?\n\n‚ÄúYeah, he‚Äôs looked good. He's looked good. He was at 23 minutes tonight plus-19. You just feel him defensively when he's out in the pick-and-roll and Murray's coming off and Draymond 30 feet out from the hoop is making Murray have to retreat a step, that alone, so that Murray can't get downhill. That's such a huge boost to the defense. And so his aggressiveness at that end and his knowledge, his wisdom it's just huge for us.‚Äù\n\n3:51 I know it's ultimately a Rick (Celebrini) choice, but even back to Memphis he was kind of indicating how good he felt physically. He thought he could kind of crank the minutes up pretty quickly. Are you seeing that? I know he's been in pretty good condition over the last nine days. But are you feeling like that? Maybe he can kind of really ramp it up for you guys quick.\n\n‚ÄúYeah we have a lot of games coming up, obviously two in the next three nights, and so I'm glad nobody had to extend themselves too many minutes tonight. And that was kind of the plan for Draymond to be right in that range. And hopefully by next week we can get those minutes higher. But he looks really good and a lot of guys, JK was tremendous, just really attacking the rim. That's where we want him. We want him in the paint because you can't you can't stop him in there. He's so powerful and athletic and 11-for-11. I'm guessing eight or nine of those buckets were in the paint, and I thought he was fantastic. Nine boards and just was so under control. Just thrilled with JK‚Äôs progression, how much he's maturing and understanding what's going on. And it's beautiful to watch.‚Äù\n\n5:03 Coach, I don't know if you saw it but Klay's emotion, Draymond's emotion... its emotion right before the game start. Perhaps I don't know if it made you wonder, ‚ÄòOkay should we be playing?‚Äô But it also seemed like after Steph hit that jumper, nerves calmed down and everybody just got back to basketball. Would you say that‚Äôs accurate?\n\n‚ÄúYeah it was very emotional and a lot of guys were in tears. As the ball was being tipped and I talked to Igor Kokoskov before the game who's on Atlanta's staff, he and Deki were really close and Bogdanovic came over and said hello and there's such a strong Serbian connection in this league, really the whole region ‚Äì Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro ‚Äì the whole region is such a basketball hotbed. There's so many players from that area and Deki knew them all. Every game part of his routine was he'd go out and he'd rebound for Dario and then he'd go and he's got a lot of them. And so there's just a lot of tears around the league because Deki was beloved by so many.‚Äù\n\n6:34 Steve, you look down down the stat sheet and almost every guy who you played tonight had an assist or multiple assists and the scoring load was really balanced. That's kind of what you've been searching for at times where to get everybody sort of in a groove on the same night and do you look down and say, ‚ÄòOkay we did a lot of things really well tonight‚Äô?\n\n‚ÄúYeah it was a really well played second half in particular, once we settled in and I thought Cory Joseph was fantastic coming off the bench and just getting us settled. We only had 10 turnovers the whole game. And as I said, hopefully we can get some momentum and get the season straightened out.‚Äù\n\n7:23 Steve you went to lineups featuring Draymond several times tonight. What do you see from that group?\n\n‚ÄúGood speed and athleticism. And I think Wiggs and JK both did a really good job of attacking the basket. And I think when they're out there and you feel them defensively like we did tonight, it changes our team and allows us to get stops and get out and run and get to the rim, get fouled. Both Wiggs and JK got fouled several times going to the basket and those points really help us.‚Äù\n\nSTEVE PREGAME ATL-GSW\n\n0:00 Good evening Steve. I wanted to ask you just about the good and the difficulty you have as a USA Basketball coach when you have to tell some of your players they made it and others that they did not. And the challenge of that and the joy of that but also specifically with Chris Paul and his injury if there's an update on him and as secondary and how did he end up what helped him get on the list?\n\nSTEVE KERR PREGAME BEFORE ATL-GSW: ‚ÄúYeah so that's a difficult part of the job. There's so many worthy players throughout the league and obviously only 12 guys are going to make up the team. So Grant Hill and Sean Ford and I have been talking about this for months and putting together a list and the list includes a lot of really great players up and down. But there's part of it too is, there's a USA Basketball bent to it. So all of the guys on the World Cup team last year who've been in the program, we wanted them on that list. And former Olympians, gold medalists, people with FIBA experience, like we've wanted those guys on the list and we knew this as the list was being formed, no matter what we were going to do there were going to be omissions. It's almost impossible ‚Äì it is impossible ‚Äì to not have some people who are upset and we acknowledge that. But it's a difficult process, but it's made difficult because we have so many talented players in this league who are absolutely worthy of being on the national team but only so many spots.‚Äù\n\n2:09 So how'd you tell Draymond and Klay?\n\n‚ÄúYeah. Just conversations, told them about the process and how it was going to play out. And so I've talked to all three of those guys here in the last couple of weeks. And so they were aware of what was transpiring as the list came out.‚Äù\n\n2:33 Steve you're kind of just looking over at the screen with Deki's face on it. And really for the past three days we've been asking ‚Äì it‚Äôs two days ‚Äì we've been asking you about how you expect the emotions to be tonight but now being here seeing the signage wearing the shirts knowing what how you guys are going to pay tribute to him, just what are you telling your guys and what are the emotions right now?\n\n‚ÄúWell, it's very emotional just to walk into the building for the first time on a game night without Deki. And obviously we're all wearing our shirts and there's images of him with his ever present smile. And it's very emotional because it's all still very very raw and surreal in a lot of ways. So we've been practicing the last few days and there's not a whole lot to say to prepare for something like this. You just dive in head first and stick together and go try to win a basketball game and honor our brother.‚Äù\n\n3:44 There was so much going into this season prior to this incident with rotations, your record, playing time, all that. Did this potentially provide perspective within the team as far as the little things not maybe mattering as much as the bigger picture?\n\n‚ÄúYeah we talk about perspective all the time here and you know how lucky we are to do what we do and how our problems aren't real problems. But something like this just hammers that point home. You can't really have perspective until you feel it personally. You can try. You can convince yourself. And we do that. And it's important to try to do that to recognize that people are struggling around the world and there's famine and wars going on. And we acknowledge all of that, but when you have a death in the family, in the group, yeah it definitely has a way of making everything seem miniscule and unimportant. At the same time this is what we do and so you're trying to find that balance, that good perspective. We should still go out and compete and do everything we can to win the game because that's what we do and. But you have the perspective that goes along with it.‚Äù\n\n5:27 Kind of wanting the flip side that it is kind of a big week for you guys. You got four games in the next six nights, trade deadline coming up, standings race. How prepared do you feel like this team is to jump right back into what you know? It's a pretty vital stretch of the schedule.\n\n‚ÄúThe guys are ready to get back on the floor and it's been a week and we would not have been ready those first two games that were postponed. So it's time to get back out there and our guys, they're going to be ready to play and we know we've got half the season left and still time to salvage the season and get things turned around and that's the plan.‚Äù\n\n6:11 We all know this is a hard week. But what are your fondest memories with Coach Deki and any particular moment that when you think about him, that will warm your heart?\n\n‚ÄúA lot of great memories with Deki. He's been here two and a half years and winning that championship with him the first year and celebrating with him. And those are great memories. And when you're on a team, when you're on a staff, it's really an everyday thing where you're just together. You really do feel like family. And so the beauty of Deki, he was just the consistency of his approach. The smile is perfect. He was constantly smiling and laughing. Had a great outlook on life and he loved life. He loved the people around him. He loved his family, loved the team and I looked forward to seeing him every single day.‚Äù\n\n7:18 A big change for you guys this season is that you're toward the very bottom of the league in both opponents turnover rate and then percentage of points scored via fast break. Are you guys looking to improve in those areas going forward or are they just more a reflection of your identity?\n\n‚ÄúYou're talking about our turnovers?‚Äù\n\nOpponents‚Äô turnover rate and then points scored via fast break for you guys.\n\n‚ÄúFor us, yeah. Yeah we have not turned people over. We have not generated easy baskets and that's been a big problem. We haven't been efficient when we are in transition which was also a problem last year. So yeah these are all things that we'd like to do better. And we're constantly trying to improve in a lot of the different areas where we've struggled for sure.‚Äù\n\nATL-GSW GAME NOTES\n\n0:00 Austin Scott of KNBR joins us to give us the vibe from Chase, guys signing autographs more than usual during pregame\n\n7:00 refs: Marc Davis (my top five), Kevin Cutler, Mousa Dagher\n\n10:45 more Steve Kerr interviews with Tom Tolbert\n\nand pregame, just uploaded\n\n14:15 GP2 is wearing a Milojevic jersey No. 0 during Deki tribute\n\n15:00 speech by Kerr (audio) -- That's awesome they are all wearing their jerseys with MILOJEVIC as their names!!!\n\n23:00 crazy coincidence that first game back and tribute to Decky would have Bogdan Bogdanovic -- I truly believe there's some divine intelligence, it was part of the sacrifice that we don't have any toxicity on social media\n\n30:45 tipoff!
