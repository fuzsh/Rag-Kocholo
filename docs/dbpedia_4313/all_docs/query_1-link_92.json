Additional criteria was number of Jury members who give maximum number of points to one of the coaches (3:2 for Sostaric). The second one would be the number of points given by fans (also Sostaric was ahead).\n\nWOMEN’S WORLD HANDBALL COACH 2020\n\nNenad Sostaric (11 jury + 10 fans) 21+1\n\nThorir Hergeirsson (14 jury + 7 fans) 21\n\nJesper Jensen (4 jury + 4 fans) 8\n\nLaurent Bezeau (3 jury + 1 fans) 4"
