        "text": "Although they are all anti-vaxxers, the prime minister is not one of them, because he is simply waiting for him to fall and then get vaccinated, as well as all the Facebook followers of Nebojša Medojević and Steve Bannon, in which I do not include Boris Bogdanović, although he also screams on social media to scold himself betrayal is about to happen - so, they are all convinced that my best reader doesn't exist, that I'm just joking with the audience, so what I can't sign myself, I put in the mouth of my supposed friend.\n\nBut, just as a vaccine is the only cure against corona, the fall of the Government is the only salvation for Zdravko, self-isolation is the safest place for Medojević, and returning to factory settings is the natural path for Bogdanović (SNP from '97), so are the lines that follow the most convincing confirmation that is my best reader harsh reality. For all anti-vaxxers, primitives, populists, chauvinists, cowards and other promoters of conspiracy theories:\n\n\"Regarding the DF platform you write about, I have to make a slightly longer digression, which does not concern the document itself. My mother is a hyperemotional person, a double Cancer in her horoscope. She is affected by things that other people don't even notice. That's probably why he's managed to fight an autoimmune disease for thirty years.\n\nShe is very tolerant of human weaknesses. He forgives everyone, he has no bad memory. He says that we should never judge people in whose shoes we have not walked. Let's say, he has breadth and understanding for people who sell themselves for 50 or 100 euros, so in election cycles he knows how to say: 'Who knows what trouble has befallen them. I know what it's like to look into the eyes of a born child who sits at home without a job and for two years, every week, applies for a job, and knows that he won't get it, because my husband and I have been voting against DPS for a lifetime.' Therefore, she knew how to express understanding for people who vote against their will because of the future of their child, or in order to provide him with bread and fuel.\n\nFortunately, after several years of waiting, her child (Ja) was hired by Dragan Šoć, thanks to him forever, because he had excellent relations with the late Šturanović. Then I had an argument with my father because Dragan told him to go to the then president of the Basic Court in Podgorica and say that I was coming on the recommendation of Minister Šturanović, which I refused to do. Nevertheless, I got the job, without mentioning Šturanović, to whom I am also very grateful.\n\nHowever, there is a phenomenon that my mother is absolutely intolerant of. It's the Grand! For her, the Grand Parade is synonymous with modern Sodom and Gomorrah. For her, Grand is a broad term that includes not only listeners of that hideous music and viewers of the specific show program, but also viewers of various pinks, farms, big brothers, couples, marics, etc. He can't even accept that some people watch it for fun... As soon as he hears that someone is watching these abominations, I have the impression that he permanently changes his opinion about that person and never looks at them with the same eyes again... He thinks that the observers of this primitivism , immorality, bad taste, simpletons, cruelty... they identify with the actors, because they inherit the same or very similar value system!\n\nDescribing them, (both actors and observers) he often paraphrases Gorica Popović, who, as a guest on a show, said that as a girl every summer she went to her grandmother who ran a pig farm and that she had never, never seen pigs mating in a pen. because they hid themselves from the eyes of observers, knowing discretion and shame. Unlike the actors of these scandalous programs.\n\nLet me finally make a point. My mother calls the politicians and activists of Front, DPS, Vučić's SNS, Dodik's supporters, Croatian lunatics and all other Balkan chauvinists by one name - GRAND AUDIENCE!\n\nAnd a different platform could not be expected from the grand audience\".\n\nNow, I hope, I have convinced Zdravko and Meden and Boki, that my best friend exists, because my mother was never so gentle and peaceful as to teach me not to judge people whose shoes we have not walked in. She was more for arguing than for reconciliation. But, on a similar topic (we don't judge people in whose shoes we haven't walked), in May of last year I published an article (May Montenegro be eternal, amen) in which I wondered: would Mandić in 2020 be described as a quisling, Ivica Stanković as a mafia prosecutor, Bidon as a puppet of the Leader and Amfilohije as the devil - that the DPS was different and that they had not, one with terror and the other with money and privileges, shoved them into shoes with which they could not have left a different mark.\n\nTherefore, my brothers and dissidents from DF have nothing to be angry and curse: we are not divided by party, nation, flag, language or religion, we are only divided by values. This is supported by the fact that I am equally far from the platform of Draginja Vuksanović and today's SDP, theirs large Montenegrinism, turbo chauvinism with which they attack the foundations of anti-fascism and citizenship, which, miraculously, they appeal to.\n\nBut back to my best reader's mother and her shoes. She would say - the most difficult thing on the political stage is to be in Dritan Abazović's shoes. After a year and a half of calling Dritan a traitor, DPS & Co. would gladly support him as prime minister today, while those others who for a year and a half were proud of his steadfastness and defense of the first change of government in the history of Montenegro, are now already starting to call him a traitor. But, always being in the minority means almost always being right. Abazović played a decisive role in defeating DPS, and the biggest in defending that victory. If he now succeeds in persuading or forcing Đukanović to withdraw, then he has already done enough to one day receive more than a footnote in history textbooks. Even if they are written by Novak Adžić. Especially if he would be objective like in the big feature about DPS and the leader from the beginning of the 90's that he published not so long ago in News. And who would Adžić give up today? Like some Dejan some Dalila in the fifth season of Cooperative.\n\nFinally, here is the answer to the question in the title: It is. It's a lion."
