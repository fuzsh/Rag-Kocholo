        "text": "I heard about St. Catherine Specialty Hospital through an acquaintance who told me that it is a great hospital concerning the problems and ailments I have and that it has excellent knee surgeons. So that's what made me consider having an operation here. He then sent me all the information via email showing me the hospital, the rehabilitation, etc. That is how I decided, yes, I wanted to come here. Also, the fact that in England, if you for example say you would go to see a consultant, you'd go to see the consultant one day, you'd go off for your X ray, another day you'd go off for your blood work in a different hospital. Here, you have all of that in one place and in one day. Everybody was lovely, I love the building because it looks and is so clean. I saw cleaners when I first came, you know, they come two times every day. Everybody has been so nice and kind. Concerning anybody that's English who comes over here does not have to worry about the language and even if they're going out visiting or going to a restaurant, coming into the hospital, everyone speaks English. That's nice. I was in a lot of pain before I came for the operation and of course, after the operation I knew it was going to be hard, but it's not as hard as I expected, I'm already feeling better. I recommend to anyone who has similar problems as me and is hesitating whether to come to another country for surgery, to definitely come and see for yourself the professionalism, kindness and practicality of the medical team of this hospital. “\n\nThe patient underwent bilateral total knee arthroplasty with “Physica KR” implant. The procedure was performed by Assoc. Prof. Dinko Vidović, M.D., Ph.D., Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgeon..\n\nIn the photo with the head nurse of the department Jasminka Stanić, nurses Irena Skorzit, Jasna Sporiš, Nataša Rinkovec, Maja Kiš and physiotherapists Renato Derković, bacc. physioth. and Domagoj Brkanac, bacc. physioth.\n\n„I found out about the St. Catherine Specialty Hospital when I received a recommendation for Danijela Klarić, M.D., M. Sc., physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist to solve my mother's problems, but also for St. Catherine as an excellent place for physical therapy and also for dermatology, which turned out to be correct. I think that the service in St. Catherine is great, the medical team is really professional, friendly and organized. Dr. Komadina is the first dermatologist who was able to effectively help me with psoriasis. Friendly, approachable and very professional. I would really recommend her to anyone because she is a doctor with a lot of experience and love for what she does. I am very satisfied with the results of the treatment prescribed by dr. Komadina and I will continue to follow her advice for the care of psoriatic skin and nails..\"\n\nIn the photo with our Snježana Komadina, M.D., specialist in dermatology and venereology.\n\n\"After receiving a recommendation for the St. Catherine Specialty Hospital, I decided to do a bit of research on my own, considering the vast array of options available today, and I have not regretted following my inner voice. I must commend absolutely everyone, from the porter to every medical staff member. A big thanks to Prof. Vidović who did an excellent job. It would be a sin to say anything negative about anyone or anything. Once again, thanks to everyone for making my hospital stay so pleasant. Now, I continue here with physical therapy because another institution simply isn't an option for me.\"\n\nThe patient underwent total hip replacement. The procedure was performed by Assoc. Prof. Dinko Vidović, M.D., Ph.D., Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgeon.\n\nIn the photo with the physiotherapist Filip Pancirov during postoperative rehabilitation.\n\n„On the recommendation of a friend, ever since my knee injury last year in the June, I put myself in the hands of the St. Catherine team, until today when the surgery itself was done. The nurses and doctors were extremely kind, approachable and professional, providing me with a sense of security and support during the entire process. All my doubts were solved constructively and I also received useful guidelines for both - the operation and the recovery, which I will continue at the same time in St. Catherine. The organization and arrangements went without any problems and the room I stayed in was spacious, comfortable and impeccably clean. Medical aids were provided to me on time, making the process even easier. Thanks to all the employees of St. Catherine Hospital and another big thanks to doc. Jeleč on his approach and professionalism, both around me and around other patients. We will surely see each other again, already from Monday for physical therapy and in the future also for other examinations and tests.\"\n\nThe patient underwent reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. The procedure was performed by Željko Jeleč, M. D., Ph. D., Assistant Professor, Orthopedic Surgeon.\n\n\"To begin with, I am very happy that I had surgery here at St. Catherine Specialty Hospital. At the same time, I would like to thank my doctor and operator, Assoc. Prof. Damir Hudetz, M.D., Ph.D., Orthopedic Surgeon, who successfully performed my knee surgery, as well as to the entire medical staff who took very good care of me. This individual approach to each patient is immediately visible, which needs to be specifically emphasized. The whole Hospital is wonderful. I didn't have feeling like I was in a hospital at all – that's how nice was for me to have surgery and recovery here in St. Catherine. From beginning to end, everything went great and in the best order. Sincere recommendations to everyone for St. Catherine Specialty Hospital.“\n\nThe patient underwent reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament with suturing of the medial and lateral meniscus. The procedure was performed by Assoc. Prof. Damir Hudetz, M.D., Ph.D., Orthopedic Surgeon.\n\nIn the photo with the head nurse of the department Jasminka Stanić and nurse Mia Kos.\n\n\"This was my first surgery ever, so I was scared at the beginning. However, the medical staff of the St. Catherine Specialty Hospital quickly dispelled all my fears with their approach, warmth and kindness. I would like to give special praise to Assoc. Prof. Damir Hudetz, M.D., Ph.D., Orthopedic Surgeon who did the surgery. I came to St. Catherine on the recommendation of a famous Croatian athlete and I have not regretted it. The doctor is really professional and explained the entire procedure to me in a comprehensible way. That's why I quickly gained trust in him and simply knew that everything would go as it should. During my stay in the hospital I felt like I was at home, that's how comfortable this whole experience was to me. I am really delighted with the complete service and staff of this Hospital. Sincere recommendations to everyone for St. Catherine Specialty Hospital.\"\n\nThe patient underwent knee arthroscopy and medial meniscectomy. The procedure was performed by Assoc. Prof. Damir Hudetz, M.D., Ph.D., Orthopedic Surgeon.\n\nIn the photo with the physiotherapist Renato Derković and nurses Jasna Sporiš and Nataša Rinkovec.\n\n\"I came to St. Catherine Specialty Hospital with full confidence. All the information I was interested in, I found on the website of St. Catherine. I was looking for a place where I can do everything I need in one place. Looking through the website and the experiences of other patients, there was no longer any doubt - St. Catherine Specialty Hospital is the right place for me. My problems were related to the spine. Namely, I had severe pain in my spine, and right away at the first examination with the Assistant Professor Vide Bilić, M.D., Ph.D., General Surgery Specialist, Orthopedics and Traumatology Specialist, Traumatology Subspecialist, I was diagnosed with a fracture. Within 5 days, all pre-operative preparations were arranged, and then I had a surgery, which solved my problem. Despite the fact that it was a major surgical procedure, I came to it as the most beautiful trip, because I had complete trust in the doctor and the entire medical staff, and I felt safe there. The procedure was successful, and I am delighted with absolutely everyone and everything: Assistant Professor Vide Bilić, M.D., Ph.D., and the entire operating team, the medical staff in the department, as well as with the accommodation and food, which even exceeded expectations. Now I feel calm, happy and peaceful. A truly beautiful experience. My sincere recommendations to everyone.\"\n\nThe patient underwent vertebroplasty. The procedure was performed by Assistant Professor Vide Bilić, M.D., Ph.D., General Surgery Specialist, Orthopedics and Traumatology Specialist, Traumatology Subspecialist.\n\nIn the photo with the nurse Irena Skozrit.\n\n\"First of all, a big thanks to the entire team of St. Catherine Hospital. I suffered from terrible back pain, causing me to lose consciousness. The pain was so strong that I couldn't speak or walk. After several examinations, I was told in the another institution that they don't know what to do with me. When I came to St. Catherine Hospital for an examination with Marjan Rožanković, M.D. ,Ph.D., Consultant Neurosurgeon, upon reviewing my medical records, he immediately understood the issue. You instilled in me such confidence and trust, proving your expertise. Above all, I didn't feel just like another patient in line. Now, after the surgery, I have no pain. I cannot thank everyone enough. You set the standard very high and are a true example of how things should be done.\"\n\nThe patient underwent microdiscectomy with a lateral approach. The procedure was performed by Marjan Rožanković, M.D., Ph.D., Consultat Neurosurgeon.\n\nIn the photo with prof. Dragan Primorac, M.D., Ph,D. and the head nurse of the department Jasminka Stanić.\n\n„Due to frequent inflammations (angina) that were treated with antibiotics and the daughter's PFAPA syndrome - the otorhinolaryngologist's recommendation was tonsillectomy. However, due to the long period of waiting for the surgery appointment in the public hospital and due to the fear that the appointment could be prolonged again because of a recurrence of the disease, which has already happened once before, we decided to contact St. Catherine Specialty Hospital. The very next day after the contact, a follow-up examination was scheduled with Mislav Malić, M.D., Ph.D., FEBORL-HNS, otorhinolaryngology specialist, and the tonsillectomy itself was arranged on the eighth day after the examination. Antibiotic protection was also arranged as a preventive measure before the procedure, so that the surgery would not have to be postponed due to illness. During the examination and before the surgery, the doctor and nurses provided us with all the necessary information regarding the procedure itself, the course of the surgery, and treatment and care after the procedure.

Taught by the previous positive experience from those examinations where the employees were always smiling and approachable, I had no doubts in choosing that hospital for the procedure I need. Regarding the overall service, from the first visit to the physiatrist, X-ray imaging, diagnosis, offered treatment options and the operation itself, I can only say praise. The first thing that amazed me was the processing speed. Out of the entire hour and a half I spent in the hospital, I spent a total of 10 minutes in the waiting room itself. The treatment and accommodation itself were impeccable. The feeling of being in a hotel and not a hospital helped calm the nervousness before the surgery, which was on the same day. Big thanks to the anesthesiology staff as well as the nurses who helped me with their relaxed (but still professional) approach even while they were driving me to the operating room. From all of this experience, it was clear to me that all employees do their best to make patients feel as comfortable as possible. My general impression was that I was the only patient in the hospital and that everything revolved around me. Many thanks also to the lady who came 3 times a day to clean my apartment and she was also smiling and assured me that I was in excellent hands! Dr. Starčević was largely responsible for my decision to undergo the procedure at the St. Catherine Specialty Hospital. I was impressed by his directness and the way he explained the problem in a simple and concise way. His attitude and thorough description of potential options and consequences let me know that the entire recovery will take as little time as possible and that the risks are minimal. Also, his professionalism after the surgery only confirmed that impression for me, where he described to me in the simplest possible way how the procedure was performed and that the recovery will be as fast as possible. Today, 2 days after the surgery, even though the bandage is still there, I already feel like the surgery never happened.\"\n\nThe patient underwent Osteosynthesis of the finger.

The whole time I felt like I was getting preferential treatment, like I was a VIP guest to whom everyone was always available, kind and smiling. The treatment in the surgery room was also impeccable, the communication with the anesthesiologists was relaxed and in a good mood, and dr. Vrdoljak performed the procedure superbly. The most important thing was, and I think this is the most important thing in any job, that I was constantly aware of what was being done, what was going to be done next and when it was going to be done.

I have nothing but praise for the ambience of the hospital and the medical team.“\n\nIn the photo with Marin Lozić, M.D., Ph.D., specialist of anesthesiology and subspecialist of intensive care.\n\nI decided on surgery in St. Catherine Hospital for several reasons. The one I would especially single out are the top orthopedic specialists, who have many successful operations on the anterior cruciate ligaments behind them, and I knew I could fully trust them. During the surgery and stay in St. Catherine, medicall team was very helpful. They were at my service whenever I needed them, they would often came to check if I needed anything and how I was feeling. Prim. Eduard Rod, M.D., Ph.D., Orthopedic Surgeon has been there from the very first day for all my questions and concerns, every few weeks we have check-up examinations to see how the recovery is progressing and to get further instructions for my recovery. Currently, 13 weeks have passed since the operation, and the recovery is going more than excellent. I am very satisfied with the results so far and I look forward to returning to the sports halls.\n\nThe patient underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The procedure was performed by Eduard Rod, M.D., orthopedic surgeon.\n\nI have only words of praise for St. Catherine Specialty Hospital. The medical staff is very friendly, and the Hospital is equipped with the most modern technologies, giving patients the opportunity to undergo different examinations and tests, all in one place. All of the above, with the professional and dear Ivana Erceg Ivkošić, M.D., Ph.D., Assistant Professor, OBG Subspecialist in Gynecologic Endocrinology, Human Reproduction and Menopausal Medicine, is the reason why I decided on St. Catherine. Dr. Erceg Ivkošić is a warm, empathetic person extremely professional in her work, and I would recommend her to all women who hesitate to come for a gynecological examination. My partner Den, a proud father-to-be, also has full confidence in the doctor, which means a lot to me since he is currently away from home a lot because he is part of the \"Seven Summits\" mountain challenge in which rare individuals conquer the highest peaks of the seven continents. Not a single Croat has yet succeeded in this. He has conquered five mountain peaks so far and I am really proud of him, the youngest Croatian to climb Mount Everest. Given the above, it is very important to me as a wife and future mother that I have his trust in the doctor while he is away, so at any moment we can both be sure that I am in good hands, even when we are not together.\n\nIn the photo: Patient Marija Opačak and her partner Den Eror with Ivana Erceg Ivkošić, M.D., Ph.D., Assistant Professor, OBG Subspecialist in Gynecologic Endocrinology, Human Reproduction and Menopausal Medicine.\n\nI am very satisfied with the overall service in St. Catherine, which is confirmed by the fact that every time I travel with a smile from Šibenik to Zagreb, where the Hospital is located. The medical staff is extremely kind, helpful and, most importantly, they will always greet you with a smile on their face, and that means a lot to me personally. I would especially like to praise Marin Lozić, M.D., Ph.D., specialist of anesthesiology and subspecialist of intensive care who is very simple and nice, but maximally professional in his work. Finally, I would like to emphasize the individual approach tailored to the specific needs of each patient, which all the employees of St. Catherine have to the patient. I had never experienced such treatment before, so I like this personalized approach the most. In St. Catherine patient really comes first!\n\nIn the photo with Marin Lozić, M.D., Ph.D., specialist of anesthesiology and subspecialist of intensive care\n\n„Since I started to feel big problems with hemorrhoids, I decided to solve this problem so I started asking about possible methods and recovery. After the information about a quite long recovery after the classic surgical procedure, I decided on the laser surgery method. I received a recommendation for St. Catherine Specialty Hospital and after I had watched the video interview with Ana Dimova, M.D., general surgery specialist and digestive surgery specialist, I finally decided to have an examination and surgical procedure in St. Catherine. From the first phone meeting with medical team of St. Catherine Hospital, I realized how organized, fast, professional and friendly the entire team is. This kindness left a special impression on me from the first contact. Doctor Dimova is extremely approachable, professional and always ready to communicate. As she said the course of recovery would be, that's exactly how it was. I can freely say that St. Catherine Specialty Hospital's team and Ana Dimova, M.D. brightened the rest of my life.“\n\nThe patient underwent Hemorrhoid laser surgery. The procedure was performed by Ana Dimova, M.D., general surgery specialist and digestive surgery subspecialist.\n\nIn late 2020, I started to feel pain in my leg. The examination revealed that it was femoral head epiphysiolysis and that I needed surgery. After surgery in one health institution, I was on crutches for as long as two months. Taking into consideration that I walked for a long time with the help of crutches, we decided to go to St. Catherine Specialty Hospital for the second opinion of Darko Antičević, M.D., Ph.D., Orthopedics Surgeon, Pediatric Orthopedic Surgeon. During the examination, Darko Antičević, M.D., Ph.D. concluded that the the fixation implant is too short and placed at the wrong angle, so that I could no longer do sports, which is very important to me. Based on this examination, I decided on another operation in St. Catherine to be able to play sports again. The operation went well, without any problems, and my recovery was very fast, so I returned to my usual activities and trainings with minimal exercise. One month after surgery at the check-up examination, dr. Antičević confirmed to me that there are no more restrictions and that I can play sports again without any problems. I was very happy and I would recommend St. Catherine hospital and Darko Antičević, M.D., Ph.D. to everyone with similar problems.\n\nThe patient underwent extraction of the existing implant and fixation with a longer implant at a more favorable angle for the purpose of epiphyseodesis of the the femoral head growth plate. The surgery was performed by Darko Antičević, M.D., Ph.D., Orthopedics Surgeon, Pediatric Orthopedic Surgeon with the operating team of St. Catherine Specialty Hospital.\n\nI would like to praise and thank all the medical staff of St. Catherine Hospital, but mostly Ana Dimova, M.D., general surgery specialist and digestive surgery subspecialist who has been dealing with my problem which I have had since 2015. Namely, after a long hesitation and fear of the classic invasive surgery for rectovaginal fistula that occurs as a result of a more severe stage of Crohn's disease, surfing the Internet I came across the website of St. Catherine Specialty Hospital which treats fistulas with laser and stem cells. Both methods of treatment attracted me and gave me hope that I would finally, after 7 long years, get rid of the abscess. Big 'thank you' to the wonderful dr. Dimova who already at the first proctological examination freed me from the fear and trauma that has been lingering in me for 7 years. From personal experience, I can confirm that women postpone such examinations just because of discomfort and shame. I give a 5-Star rating to dr. Dimova, as well as to the entire Hospital where I have undergone fistula laser surgery and done the whole preoperative and post-operative process. The service is a world class, so much so that at one point I thought I was dreaming, because after comparing it to a month of treatment at another health institution, it feels like I live in two parallel worlds. I definitely recommend to everyone St. Catherine Specialty Hospital and wonderful dr. Ana Dimova.\n\nThe patient underwent fistula laser surgery. The procedure was performed by Ana Dimova, M.D., general surgery specialist and digestive surgery subspecialist.\n\nAfter many years of knee problems, pain and swelling I decided to consult an orthopedic specialist. A knee examination and an X-ray were performed. Unfortunately, serious damage was found and the only solution was surgery - the implantation of a knee prosthesis. Trpimir Vrdoljak, M.D., Orthopedic Surgeon at St. Catherine Specialty Hospital explained the complete procedure to me and gave me all the necessary information about t recovery pace and treatment after the operation.\n\nThe surgical procedure was performed in April 2022 and after three days I was released for home care. I felt very well and the second day after the procedure, with the help of a therapist and crutches, I took a short walk down the hospital corridor. I couldn’t believe it was all happening so fast. Dr. Vrdoljak gave me instructions and recommended as much walking as possible to the subjective limit of pain, as well as walking with the help of crutches.\n\nPhysical therapy started in an incredibly short time, the fifth day after the operation and very intensively - three times a week for two and a half hours. The therapy itself is one-on-one with the top expertise, patience and kindness of the therapist. The results were visible very quickly and after less than two weeks I stopped using crutches, although I could have done it earlier.\n\nI am now undergoing a second series of physical therapy with ten new exercises of two and a half hours each. I did this at my own request because I felt great and I wanted to get complete personal security and feeling, which is a very important part of recovery.\n\nI want to emphasize the top, professional and human approach of Dr. Vrdoljak and physiotherapist Jelena Kelemen. Although only 5 weeks have passed since the surgery itself, I feel great and my life is getting a whole new quality. Finally, I would like to emphasize the high standard of the St. Catherine Specialty Hospital and the great expertise of the entire team.\n\nThe patient underwent the total knee replacement surgery. The surgery was performed by Trpimir Vrdoljak, M.D., Orthopedic Surgeon.\n\nSt. Catherine Specialty Hospital is known as one of the best health care institutions in Croatia. My experience so far with medical staff, physicians and service provided confirms this. I first came to the Hospital in May last year because of a problem with my right knee (pain, difficulty walking). After MRI and the first diagnosis made by prof. Igor Borić, M.D., Ph.D., Radiologist and Hospital Director, I got in touch with Željko Jeleč, M.D., Ph.D., Orthopedic Surgeon. Dr. Jeleč explained the details of the surgical procedure and the course of recovery to me in a professional and simple way. I would like to point out that dr. Jeleč is very attentive and professional, and he made the whole process in the period before and after that operation much easier with his calmness and humanity.\n\nKnee surgery (anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and partial knee replacement) was performed in January. Thanks to the extremely friendly, approachable and professional medical staff (nurses and doctors) the five-day stay in the Hospital was very pleasant, which I consider extremely important because they made my fear and anxiety disappear quickly.\n\nI started physical therapy and rehabilitation seven days after surgery with Jelena Kelemen, bacc. physioth. Jelena is attentive, calm, patient and professional, and she helped me a lot to start walking without crutches very soon, to return to my daily activities and to recover towards the desired goal. I would also like to praise other physiotherapists, especially Ivana Glavač, bacc. physioth. with whom I was doing physical therapy for a while.\n\nBIG 'THANK YOU' to the medical staff of St. Catherine Specialty Hospital for everything provided!\n\nThe patient underwent the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and partial knee replacement, whereby these two, otherwise standardly separate procedures, were performed for the first time in St. Catherine during the same operation. The surgery was performed by Željko Jeleč, M.D., Ph.D., Orthopedic Surgeon.\n\nA year and a month after surgery I feel, I can freely say, just like a few years before my problems started, which means that I returned to all my previous activities in full capacity, in terms of active life as a former athlete. There are no more limitations that I felt before the operation, there is no pain but, as dr. Vrdoljak said, I have to be careful and I must not forget that I have undergone surgery. Having that in mind, I still follow all the instructions I got, but the essence is that I returned to normal life, to daily activities, moreover, I returned to certain sports activities, so I can definitely say that I am very pleased that I chose St. Catherine Specialty Hospital and the doctor who performed this operation. I made the right choice for my life.\n\nHaving recently moved to Slovenia with an existing spine problem, a new friend recommended St. Catherine Specialty Hospital to me. After a quick check, I found it was only 2 hours drive so I contacted the Hospital and was booked in for a consultation within days. As I am originally from the UK, I had no experience of Hospitals in Croatia. So, on the very first visit any concerns I had were gone as every staff member impressed me so much - everyone was very helpful, efficient and professional and that gave me huge confidence in knowing I was dealing with the right people. I booked in for my surgery with Marjan Rožanković, M.D., Ph.D., Consultant Neurosurgeon only 1 week later where I had amazing care and I really can’t thank everyone enough. If any of my friends or family were unfortunate enough to need a hospital, I would have no hesitation recommending St. Catherine Hospital to them.\n\nThe patient underwent lumbar microdiscectomy surgery. The surgery was performed by Marjan Rožanković, M.D., Ph.D., Consultant Neurosurgeon.\n\nI was admitted to St. Catherine Specialty Hospital for surgery without waiting and with the maximally professional approach of the entire medical staff. Medical staff is very friendly, helpful and educated, and the doctors themselves are outstanding. I came to dr. Vrdoljak for the first examination, who also performed the operation. Trpimir Vrdoljak, M.D., Orthopedic Surgeon is an excellent expert, and the way he communicates with the patient should be especially emphasized - this is extremely important and crucial for developing trust in the doctor. Also, I want to praise all the other doctors of St. Catherine Hospital who did the examinations before my operation, i.e. cardiologist, anesthesiologist, radiologists and employees of the medical-biochemical laboratory. To conclude, the complete service is outstanding, the nurses were at my disposal at all times, and I can’t help but mention the food that is really delicious. I am glad that I chose St. Catherine Hospital, that was my best decision.\n\nThe patient underwent total hip replacement surgery with direct anterior approach (TEP), and the surgery was performed by Trpimir Vrdoljak, M.D., Orthopedic Surgeon.\n\nAfter several months of searching for a clinic where I would operate a hip destroyed by arthrosis, I decided to go to St. Catherine Specialty Hospital and I did not regret it. Expertise, kindness, professional approach and an atmosphere in which full attention is given to patient really made my recovery easier and faster. Since I am a healthcare professional myself, I notice details that someone else might not and I am really thrilled because nothing is left to chance - from preoperative preparations to postoperative treatment, everything is checked to the smallest detail to ensure the best result. Thanks to the skills of Trpimir Vrdoljak, M.D., Orthopedic Surgeon and Ira Đevahira Husedžinović Kliškinjić, M.D., specialist in anesthesiology, reanimatology and intensive care treatment, subspecialist in intensive care treatment, hip replacement surgery with anterior approach allowed me to walk with one crutch after 4-5 days. The wonderful physiotherapist Ivana helped me to walk around the house without crutches after 4-5 treatments wit her. I am also grateful to her for always having a complete, competent and encouraging answer to every one of my questions, and there were many. I warmly recommend everyone who has this or similar problems to contact St. Catherine Specialty Hospital. By chance, I had the opportunity for surgery in one of the best New York hospitals and I responsibly claim that St. Catherine Specialty Hospital is in that rank. Moreover, kindness and communication with the patient is much more pleasant and humane.\n\nIn the photo with Ivana Glavač, bacc. physioth.\n\nI had a sports injury of a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament and now, after surgery, I am feeling much better. After a month I walk without crutches and orthoses, already bending my leg at the knee. Recovery is going in the best possible direction. And I hope to play the basketball again. I would like to recommend the team on the department who prepared me for surgery. During the operation, my mother was informed about the course of the operation. They recognized her concern and fear and they were with her. We cannot describe expertise, humanity, attention of Željko Jeleč, M.D, Ph.D. After the operation, he explained and answered all our questions again and again, and most importantly, he knew everything about my great love - basketball. He treated me like a doughter, which meant a lot to me. The second day after the surgery I was already walking with the help of two crutches and an orthosis and the wonderful, patient physiotherapist Renato.\n\nI started my rehabilitation four days after the operation in Zagreb. Physiotherapist Filip works individually with me. My parents and the whole team of St. Catherine gives me support and help.\n\nOne big THANKS to all the team of the St. Catherine Hospital for all the attention, care, cordiality, care, expertise, humanity that you give us. If I had to have surgery again, I would definitely go to doc. Jeleč and St. Catherine Hospital.\n\nThe patient underwent reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament and the procedure was performed by Željko Jeleč, Orthopedic Surgeon.\n\nAfter many years of knee pain, I decided to have an examination at St. Catherine Hospital because I had good recommendations for a professional team of orthopedists. I had my first examination with Trpimir Vrdoljak, M. D., Orthopedic Surgeon who explained in such simple language and with a lot of patience why my knee hurts and what should I do to be able to walk normally again.\n\nI decided to have surgery by dr. Vrdoljak and I must mention that the second day after the operation I normally stood on my own feet and walked with the help of crutches. Every day my progress was huge and crutches were needed less and less. Most importantly I walk normally and have no pain. I feel reborn at the age of 79.\n\nI would like to thank Dr. Vrdoljak, but also the entire medical team who were always available to me during my stay in the hospital. They were kind, smiling, so they certainly contributed to my faster recovery.\n\nI thank everyone and will definitely recommend your esteemed institution to my friends.\n\nThe patient underwent partial knee arthroplasty and the procedure was performed by Trpimir Vrdoljak, M. D., Orthopedic Surgeon.\n\nA week after the procedure, I went to physical therapy at St. Catherine Hospital. I feel great with no pain and the progress is fantastic. Very quickly I started walking without crutches and feeling safe. I am positively surprised by the approach of Trpimir Vrdoljak, M.D., Orthopedic Surgeon. He explained everything to me in detail so I knew what to expect from the procedure itself. From 1 to 10 I give St. Catherine a rating of 50. They are all fantastic, very kind and the ambiance is pleasant. Thanks also to physiotherapist Marko. Rehabilitation is for every compliment, especially the individual approach. If I had any health problem I would choose St. Catherine. My warm recommendation to everyone who finds themselves in a situation where they need surgery, rehabilitation or a certain examination and diagnosis.\n\nThe patient underwent hip arthroscopy (with suturing of the labrum), and the procedure was performed by Trpimir Vrdoljak, M.D., Orthopedic Surgeon.\n\nI chose St. Catherine Specialty Hospital because of the reputation and affordable offer. I was thrilled and surprised with the approach to me as a patient. I believe that this individual approach cherished by the hospital is what separates her from all private and public health institutions. Before St. Catherine, I was at several other private examinations and received mostly \"modest\" informations. Therefore, in St. Catherine Hospital, I especially want to recommend the first examination and meeting with Željko Jeleč, Prof., Ph. D., MD, orthopedic surgeon, subspecialist in traumatology of the locomotor system, who explained everything to me in detail and I knew what to expect. Confidence in the doctor is the most important, because it gives security in the treatment and reduces fear. The surgery went great and I feel really good and there is no more pain. I also thank the all hospital team who took care of me during the treatment, everything was at a high level. To anyone who has health problems I warmly recommend to arrange an examination in St. Catherine Specialty Hospital.\n\n„Due to the health problems that befell me I decided to undergo surgery, having confidence in the doctors and the hospital in Croatia. Considering that some people suggested that I perform the surgery outside of Croatia, I am glad that I decided on the St. Catherine Specialty Hospital because everything is absolutely at the highest level, from dr.. Jeleč and the entire medical team, which is what the patient needs during such surgery. I also decided to undergo physical rehabilitation in St. Catherine Hospital, I have nothing but praise for the professional team, the progress is visible and I can say that already 10 days after the procedure I am ready to return to my workplace.\"\n\nThe patient underwent Right knee arthroscopy & Application of mesenchymal stem cells from adipose tissue in both knees. The procedure was performed by Željko Jeleč, Ph.D., M.D., Assistant Professor, Orthopedic Surgeon.\n\nI am extremely satisfied with the service and the complete medical team at the St. Catherine Specialty Hospital, from the initial pleasant and fast communication to the examination and procedure. Everything was extremely comfortable, professional and without waiting. Eduard Rod, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon, explained everything to me in detail, showed on MR scan what the condition is and what is the next step. Every question, every detail, everything was answered to me very clearly and understandably. He is always ready to help and is available for any questions, which I greatly appreciate. I expressed a desire to be awake during the procedure and to watch the procedure itself, which was also made possible for me. Coming to the procedure and preparation was also at an extremely high level. I would like to recommend absolutely the entire medical team, from nurses, doctors, physiotherapists. What I always try to emphasize is the value of something. So, this approach to the patient, the procedure, new technologies, state-of-the-art equipment, the knowledge of each member of the team, it's all worth every penny. You have my recommendation always and everywhere.\n\nThe patient underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The procedure was performed by Eduard Rod, M.D., orthopedic surgeon.\n\nI came to Trpimir Vrdoljak, M.D., Orthopedic Surgeon, on the recommendation of a young man from Petrinja who told me about his experience with the doctor and the St. Catherine Hospital and I'm glad that I listened to him. Already at the first meeting I was convinced how much the entire team of St. Catherine Hospital is kind and helpful. I felt comfortable, even though I had to have surgery. I was especially impressed by the kindness of the nurses who constantly visited me after the procedure and took care of me. Now, 2 weeks after the procedure, I feel great and I would really recommend St. Catherine Hospital to everyone who has similar problems, given the kindness, professionalism and really fast service of the Hospital.\n\nI am extremely happy to get a complementary gynecological examination, Pap test and ultrasound at St. Catherine Specialty Hospital by a random pick through Facebook as part of the plan of raising awareness about cervical cancer which the hospital did. I was greeted by the extremely kind personnel, not only via telephone and email, but during my hospital stay in a very clean and comfortable atmosphere all the polyclinic in Trpinjska street in Zagreb. The gynecologist Assist. Prof. Erceg Ivkošić, M.D., Ph.D. positively surprised me with her simple and warm approach. Firstly, we talked a lot about everything and she listened carefully to me and after that we did the Pap test and examination which I didn't feel at all because she was very gentle. She showed me everything on ultrasound and explained it. I found out a lot of new information and was extremely pleased to be a patient at St. Catherine Specialty Hospital and dr. Ivkošić. I was lucky to win this complementary examination! I plan on returning after this great experience because it gives me trust and safety and that very important human factor which is being lost in the world often.”\n\nI underwent surgery of my ankle at the end of May and during the summer I was on rehabilitation in Istria. As I had to return to Zagreb at the end of August, I asked my colleagues in Istria who they can recommend. They recommended St. Catherine. I was pleased because of that because my house is near St Catherine, so I do not have to waste time on travel to the hospital. After the examination at the physiatrist and the conclusion that I was in good condition, I still continued doing physical therapy because I want to get my leg in the best possible state. So, I started doing it with your physical therapist Maja. I liked Maja because she is calm, kind and professional. The equipment is great, the room very clean and all the other personnel kind, happy and professional.\n\nI came to St. Catherine's Specialty Hospital for regular check-up. I am from Moscow and this is my first time to be in one Croatian hospital. I came to Croatia last year in September. I was really afraid before I came. I was lucky to visit gynecologist first, assistant professor Ivana Erceg Ivkosic, MD, PHD and she was great. She took away all my fears. She is so kind and she treated me as her best friend, empathetically and gently. Feeling for us women during the gynecological exam is very important and I am very happy that I came here. Everything is clean and cozy. I would like to recommend dr. Ivana Erceg Ivkosic to every women as well as whole St. Catherine’s hospital and polyclinic. All staff is very kind and friendly. Everything excellent.\n\nService at St. Catherine Hospital is great! Reminds me of Brazil where I was born and raised. Brazil has a very well-regulated health system. My sister and her husband are gynecologists and have their own private practice, which reminded me very much of your gynecology for its high quality and equipment. I have been living in Berlin, Germany for quite some time now, where I am not satisfied with my health service.\n\nThe executive health evaluation I had at St. Catharine's Specialty Hospital really impressed me, and it covered everything I needed. Complete service of St. Catharine's Specialty Hospital is great and the entire medical staff is fantastic. I would like to emphasize my particular satisfaction with the gynecological examination with doctor Ivana Erceg Ivkošić. The doctor informed me in detail about everything I needed to know. She was gentle and kind with fantastic and correct approach. I'll definitely see you again.\n\nI only have a positive experience with St. Catherine specialty hospital. Before coming here, I was on two orthopedic examinations at other institutions. Each of them had different opinions and their explanations were quite confusing. When I arrived to doctor Eduard Rod, I finally got concrete answers and opinions. I especially appreciate that the doctor was honest and open towards me; he said exactly the way things stand with concrete arguments. With his approach, he gained my trust and I made the decision that I wanted to perform surgery in St. Catherine specialty hospital. My surgery was followed by intensive physiotherapy. The service there was great. I worked with physiotherapist Nino who had a completely individual approach towards me. My experiences with therapies are also very positive; I came to therapy with two crutches, and now I can walk without them.\n\nI wanted so much to be treated at St. Catherine Hospital that even from Dubrovnik I came to Zagreb for physical therapy. The reason why I chose St. Catherine Hospital is because of an exceptional reputation and all the positive comments I have heard so far. When I arrived at the hospital, I was particularly impressed by this freshness, cleanliness and attitude towards people. I gained a great deal of confidence in St. Catherine Hospital that exceeded my expectations. I came here after a cramp injury, my legs were shaking, I was in terrible pain. I'm feeling much better now, and the pain has decreased a lot. I'm in great shape, all thanks to my dear Mrs. Maja. I'm actually sad it's over. If I could I would take Mrs. Maja with me to Dubrovnik. All praise for the staff and service. High quality and great kindness.\n\nAfter my injury, I wanted to entrust my health only in the best hands. I do pole dancing and, therefore, the best medical expertise of the St. Catherine specialty hospital was crucial in choosing it, also on the recommendation of my coach who as well performed surgery on his hip in this hospital. My surgery went well and was led by Trpimir Vrdoljak, M.D., Orthopedic Surgeon. Because of the specificity of my injury, physiotherapy was specifically designed for me. I started with the first therapies already three days after the surgery. The approach of the hospital staff is commendable, without any objections. I don’t even really feel as if I am in the hospital, but as if I came to normal training. The atmosphere is very pleasant. I am overjoyed because I can already run, and in September I will be slowly returning to pole dancing. Thank you, I am thrilled!\n\nI entrusted my long-standing spine pain problem to the vertebrology team of St. Catherine Hospital. I was rehabilitated after an individual intervention procedure.\n\nMy husband successfully treated his knee pain at the Orthopedic Center and underwent a detailed diagnostic treatment, and now our quality of life has improved significantly after targeted and personalized treatment.\n\nI look forward to finding many health conditions in one place quickly and accurately in the hands of the best professionals. This is a hospital whose staff has proven that their patients come first. Always ready to help and even if the have to get out of their way, they have an understanding of the patient's issues and many issues that plague us when we see a doctor. So far, we have entrusted every health problem to them and will continue to recommend them with full confidence to everyone, from the bottom of our hearts.\n\nI was diagnosed with osteoarthritis of my right hip and I was supposed to go for a total hip replacement surgery. I was looking for options to avoid this type of surgery. Soon I found out about this method. I was advised that I can always do the total hip replacement surgery and I have nothing to lose if I try the stem cell therapy method. I decided to do it in no time and went for surgery in a week from my first examination. My condition improved really fast, all the pain was gone and now I even exercise a lot. I go swimming four times a week and I do home exercising twice a week.\n\nI had seven knee surgeries. I was in a state that I couldn’t enter my vehicle without problems, I could walk only 50 meters without stopping and I had constant pain. Simply, I couldn’t do my daily dues without a problem anymore. Now, year and a half after my stem cell treatment, I am back to my normal life routine, I do everything I want without pain. I even went skiing. The only thing I don’t do is that I don’t play tennis anymore, but that is because I tend to be cautious. Entering and exiting my vehicle is no longer a problem. I walk normally, even up to 10 kilometers without stopping. I am very active again, all the pain is gone and my life is back to where it was before all problems with my knees.\n\nFor almost seven years I’ve had a huge problems with my spine, which kept me from performing my everyday chores or just live my regular life; I couldn’t sit for a long period of time, drive a car, work at a computer, and when I would want to get up I would be in a lot of unbearable pain. That lead me to seek solution in renowned German and American hospitals, and after almost seven years, my frustration became even greater because I experienced no progress, and I could not live normally and deal with everyday life.\n\nA friend of mine recommended St. Catherine Specialty Hospital to me, and I did my due diligence and found out that the hospital was a center of excellence and had amazing medical experts for spinal issues, which lead me to finally come to Croatia and begin with my treatment.\n\nSt. Catherine Specialty Hospital team, led by Dr. Darko Perović, after initial investigations, opted for the radio frequency ablation procedure, which is a treatment of nerve branches on the joints of my spine. The procedure lasted only 2 hours, under local anesthesia, and I left the hospital the same day.\n\nRight after coming back from the hospital, I felt much better. All of a sudden, all the daily activities seemed effortless and I didn’t feel any pain and struggle that I felt before. Truly, after a very long time, I felt like I was born again. If you can imagine the feeling of not being able to sit, or water the flowers in your garden, or drive a car, etc. Now, I can do all these things thanks to St. Catherine’s team.\n\nI would once again like to thank St. Catherine Specialty Hospital team from the bottom of my heart for being so amazing and professional and for everything they have done for me. I will always gladly share my experience and recommend St. Catherine hospital to my friends in Germany and other countries.\n\nThank you, St. Catherine!\n\nI would like to express my outmost gratitude to the entire St. Catherine Specialty Hospital staff in Zagreb for giving us an amazingly warm welcome. I didn’t even feel like I was in another country. My daughter Aslana was treated amazingly, and all the preoperative procedures were done with great care. The surgery was a success! Aslana now feels really good, and I’m now able to see my child enjoying her everyday life again!\n\nI know true meaning of life now!\n\nI would specially like to thank our surgeon for treating us with such care. Every day after the surgery, he inquired about Aslana’s health, and we stayed in touch with him throughout all that period. After the surgery, our daughter received lots of presents and she was so happy about that. Even to this day, she can’t stop telling everybody about her experiences.\n\nAlso, I’d specially like to thank Natalija Zalović, our coordinator for treating us with such care, all her efforts were priceless!\n\nThanks to her, we were able to come to Croatia for surgery. She dealt with all our visa issues, and was a tremendous support to us in everything! When some issues occurred, she was always there for us to help and console us. She is such a big hearted and warm person!\n\nThank you and good luck with everything!\n\nWe loved your hospital. It’s very comfortable and up to every standard. We were pleasantly surprised by the medical staff. The nurses are very caring, professional and kind.\n\nMy child had two surgeries done in the hospital, and both went really well. We truly trusted your doctors’ great potential from the get go, and found comfort in knowing that we’re putting our child’s care in trust of such professionals.\n\nI’m very happy that all our expectations came true. Your doctors are top quality. Your hospital provided us with an interpreter (Natalija Zalović) who was always available to us, 24/7, during our stay in Croatia, and she was always ready to help. She helped us with all the necessary documentation required for our coming to Croatia.\n\nI would also like to thank your administrative department for doing such a great job.\n\nI give you ten out of ten.\n\nMy time with “family” at Specijalna Bolnica Sv. Katarina has come to an end. I will truly miss the staff and services. Having been in Croatia from the States for about six months, I was a little apprehensive about what to expect when I found myself in need of major medical care. But I’m happy to say that from rotator cuff surgery on a very messed up shoulder by Dr. Rod to about 18 months of rehabilitation, I have nothing but good things to say about my experience. I found the doctors, staff and physical therapists abundantly capable, professional, personable, and caring. They are well informed and believe in on going educational and professional development in order to bring new and innovative experiences to care for the overall health of their clients. Jelana Kelemen, ( to whom I was assigned, and I can’t praise her enough), Ozren Mastisic, Vesna Labar, and Nino Culina, the physical therapy family, work well together giving the center a calm, stress free environment for the rehabilitative “torture” needed to guide clients back to health. As I travel away from Zagreb, I fear I will not find as satisfactory an experience for the work I need on my knees as I have found here. I will forever be indebted to Sv. Katerina rehabilitation of Zagreb.\n\nMy name is Ehorushyna Taisiia, and I’m a mother of a little girl named Sofia. On May 20th, 2017. she went through a surgery in St. Catherine Specialty Hospital. I’d like to thank Dr. Darko Antičević for having such hands of gold, and for performing great miracles. Also, I’d like to thank everyone in your hospital for your support and warmth you showed to us, and for treating all the children like they’re your own. Sofia now has a new shin, and thanks to you she can walk again.\n\nA huge thank you to the anesthesiologist Slobodan Mičić for being so generous with his time and attention he showed to Sofia. The medical staff is very caring and is always ready to help if needed.\n\nAnother special thank you to Natalija Zalović for being so caring and supportive, she has been with us to this day.\n\nFrom the bottom of my heart, thank you!!!\n\nThree years ago I had a drastic change. I started to feel a great amount of pain. All activities I was earlier doing on a regular basis were in question. This includes everyday activities such as walking up or down the stairs or entering to vehicle. I was in a state that I had to take pain medications almost every day. I wanted to do anything to make my condition better. I came across an article in the local newspapers which was about a novel treatment with adipose-derived stem cells. I informed myself on that topic a bit, asked around for experiences from others and decided to go to St. Catherine Hospital. After my examination with Doctor Hudetz and Professor Primorac, I decided to do this kind of treatment. I wanted to postpone a total knee replacement surgery as much as I could. Now I feel a big difference. I feel much better, I don’t take pain medications anymore and I walk normally, but I still avoid extreme physical activity such as skiing."
