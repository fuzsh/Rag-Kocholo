        "text": "We Are Where We Are\n\nIn the depths of sleep,\n\nI dreamt of somebody else’s unspoken words.\n\nI emerged from a tear.\n\nSurfaced from deficiency.\n\nI resided in dearth,\n\nin the general deficit of the world,\n\nin the false firmness of the body.\n\nI peeled the skin but there I was not.\n\nA Dream I Could Not Emerge From\n\nI am completely spellbound within today.\n\nDeath is winnowing. And favor towards the visible,\n\ndeception does weave. I follow the predictable.\n\nI move from a place where I am not.\n\nI pass through fervor, through a wall of disbelief.\n\nHorror howls. I try to collect myself.\n\nI try to occupy closeness,\n\nto determine the measure of the place I am at.\n\nEnvisioning within another feels good.\n\nI measure the perishable through illusion.\n\nOccupation:\n\nLevitation\n\nA fortress is a place\n\nwhere time accelerates.\n\nWhile I was building it, I’d go outside.\n\nI’d descend to the bottom\n\nperchance to recognize and gather splendor.\n\nDelusion hid silence.\n\nI marched under the constraint of confusion.\n\nPut off all logic.\n\nWalked off the faintness.\n\nI saw and forgot reliability.\n\nDoes the Touch of Your Soul Exist?\n\nThe clever cartography of pain\n\nfolds together like an intentional image\n\nof things unsettled. I fiddle with\n\ndiscoveries of the unusual, the futile\n\ntruth of the probable. A certain\n\nhabitude tries on costumes\n\nalready stained, tarnished\n\nin the performance about finally\n\nforgetting eternity.\n\nSpellbound by ensuing insentience,\n\npurposive and submissive, I find myself\n\nwhere I am not. In distress I am,\n\na rowboat is all I have.\n\nThe displaced soul ties\n\nimages of existence to an illusion of the sea.\n\nIllusion is masked by borrowed images.\n\nI sinks into deliberateness, mire\n\nwhich cannot be crossed, where\n\none cannot be and where one is not. The extent\n\nof the invisible follows the trail of sinkage.\n\nCunningness leads even the shadow itself\n\nto the other side of nothing. And I is still bathing\n\nin the illusion of itself.\n\nThrough a block of ice I sail.\n\nWe Disguise Ourselves in Ordinariness\n\nCeremonies of the body are canceled.\n\nWe cover ourselves with summer, fall and winter.\n\nGolden smoke, it’s clearing,\n\nand time accumulates, often as if someone else’s.\n\nOnce we were far, now we are close,\n\nwe were here, and already we are there.\n\nWe were never inside enough,\n\nand allowed our soul to go outside too often.\n\nFrom different sides of time balance,\n\nrecognized in the differences, we observe the same thing.\n\nThe upside-down world is flowing out of us,\n\nwhile we eat away at the remains of the future.\n\nWe persistently search for that place within us\n\nwhere the experience of existence transpires,\n\na notion of presence, but live in a matrix\n\nwhich reveals it outside us.\n\nAnd so, the world expands, then shrinks,\n\nas time marks the spot\n\nwhere our nowhere and nothing\n\nmake perfect contact.\n\nWe are already clothing ourselves\n\nin the hour of deception.\n\nI Slipped into Uneventful Time\n\nIn a secret place, dreamt-up,\n\nin an equation which proves the existence of the world,\n\nI protect you from daily records of change.\n\nAs I stretch presence,\n\nto the point of breaking,\n\nsilence echoes.\n\nOn both sides of the visible,\n\nat the very bottom of my being,\n\nI persistently harbor futility.\n\nExceedingly immeasurable, the fervor subsides,\n\nthe sum disregards arithmetic,\n\ncertainty uncertainty.\n\nDarkness is ringing, smells of decay.\n\nIrreducible faces, from one world,\n\nslide into another.\n\nThe visible and the invisible soul\n\nalternate, in a space of decay.\n\nInfinitely scattered,\n\nin daily routine,\n\nnothing surprises us anymore.\n\nA Flash\n\nOne thing is visible,\n\nthey are invisibly layering our souls.\n\nSome of the layers, form a fortress.\n\nWe are protected by the wound, not the armor.\n\nPredictability of day, melts away the opulence of dream.\n\nWe walk, most often, down the inexpressible.\n\nWe find aid, in breathing through words.\n\nOur beings are floating,\n\nalways slightly above the visible,\n\noutside short shadows,\n\nthe showy and empty.\n\nPresence is the thing, that is merely discerned.\n\nThe surreal warms us, the tangible restrains.\n\nRetribution for meaning,\n\nis revealed in the acceleration of time,\n\nand a flash of awareness is what it is.\n\nfrom the collection SLATKA SMRT (Sweet Death)\n\nNenad Šaponja (Novi Sad, 1964) is a poet, essayist and literary critic.
