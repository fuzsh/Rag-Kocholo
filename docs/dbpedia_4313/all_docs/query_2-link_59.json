        "text": "Jedinstvo Ub\n\nBloody hell, this is annoying. I finally get a game running. Got three seasons out of it. And during it, managing OFK Beograd, managing in Serbia, it just reminded me of a club I'd much rather take on a FM journey.\n\nOFK is fun, little club. Brimming with history, begging for a rebuild. But Jedinstvo, or United, for you English speaking folks, Jedinstvo is home.\n\nAlready had a thread for them, youth only, two or three years back. It has a background info on them, why I like them so I'll just copy/paste that stuff and adjust as necessary.\n\nBold part is the one being edited.\n\nJedinstvo Ub. One of the two clubs from village town where i spent my childhood. Definitively a bigger one since the other, Radnik, is relatively new. I lived 5 minutes away from their stadium. Went on runs there when i was younger, up and down the stairs on their stands. Heck, during their glory days (and i use term glory very loosely here), when Jedinstvo played in Serbia&Montenegro' Second Division, i was a bag boy for Bosko Jankovic and Dusan Basta, former Genoa and Lazio players who were here during their developing years.\n\nUb is where Dragan Dzajic, arguably the best Yugoslavian player was born. Jedinstvo Ub is where he made his first steps into football. If you haven't heard of him, i wouldn't blame you. One of the most underrated players in history. He was ridiculous back in the days. “Džajić is the Balkan miracle – a real wizard, I’m just sorry he’s not Brazilian because I’ve never seen such a natural footballer.” Words said by none other than Pelé, right after the two played against each other in 1968, if i'm not mistaken. Look him up on Youtube, even today he would be among the greatest, his technique, dribbling, crossing, devastating left foot... Out of this world.\n\nBut he wasn't the only one. Dusan (Dule) Savic, another one born in Ub, started his career at Jedinstvo before going to Crvena zvezda and becoming one of their legends and cult hero. And during his elderly days, a raging homophobe, as well as Serbian nationalist and Russian sympathizer. Maybe I should've just deleted this part but alas.\n\nIn recent times, we had Radisav Petrovic, current Almeria Zaragoza player, who went from Jedinstvo to Partizan to Blackburn, before starting his merry-go-round loan spree after signing for Sporting Lisbon.\n\nAnd at last, but not least important. Maybe you've heard of him. Current Manchester United AS Roma player. Nemanja Matic.\n\nHe isn't exactly that much connected to Jedinstvo as some of previously mentioned. At least during his earlier years. We'll get to that soon. Matic was born in tiny village near Ub called Vrelo. He played a bit for their side before going to trial in Partizan and Crvena zvezda. As neither found him talented enough to sign permanently, he went back to Ub, signed his youth contract with Jedinstvo where he spent year or two before turning pro at Kolubara, his stop-gap to Kosice and later Chelsea.\n\nNow, how is he connected this story, how is Matic intertwined in all of this and how he got me to start this save?\n\nBear with me and this wall of text, we're getting there.\n\nJedinstvo went through hard times after their former player Dragan Dzajic, back then president of Crvena zvezda, resigned and Jedinstvo's link with Serbian biggest club was severed. With no talent coming from Belgrade on loans, they dropped like a stone as far as current Serbian Fourth Division. They yo-yoed between 3rd and 4th rank, desperately trying to get back where they were and few business practices/couple wrong transfer decisions away, Jedinstvo were at the brink of extinction. Tale old as time...\n\nIn comes Nemanja Matic. As Manchester United Roma first teamer, he had means and will to help save the club where he spent his formative years. Basically, he took over Jedinstvo, paid their debts, restored our stadium, renamed it from Gradski Stadion to Stadium Dragan Dzajic and since he can't be here full time due to his career, Matic delegated pretty much everything to his brother Darko, now acting chairman of Jedinstvo Ub.\n\nTheir aims: Financial stability, giving local kids a chance to shine and eventually going after promotion to Serbian top flight.\n\nEnd of the copied bit.\n\nI'm currently really high on this club. After coming back home, this season I've missed just one of their home games. It was on my little sister's birthday.\n\nAnd it's nice. Football is mostly **** but everything else around it is nice. Folks gathering are nice. The whole ambient is just... Wholesome.\n\nThey've been promoted to Serbian second tier, Prva liga after some club (I think it was Zarkovo, I'm really not sure) failed to comply with financial regulations. There were few clubs in the mix but Jedinstvo prevailed, thanks to a rebuilt stadium, clean books (the official reason) and some tiny bit of politics involved, as Ub's mayor is really close to our lord and saviour, our despot and eternal ruler Aleksandar Vucic.\n\nSo, yeah, not exactly spotless record but they're here. But in this game, we can do things the right way. Get to the promised land on the pitch. Without shady backroom deals.\n\nSo let's get to work.\n\nJedinstvo Ub\n\nCatching up with the world. Transfer Window. Preseason.\n\nWhat I meant with first, catching up bit is to just show you what happened in the other leagues during first season, which I simulated to get Jedinstvo into Prva liga.\n\nSo here's a quick recap.\n\nEngland. Liverpool won again. Pep had a horrible December and it cost him the title. Still kept his job. Despite not winning anything. Bald Fraud\n\nFulham, Sheff Utd and Hull got promoted.\n\nFrance. PS****ingG. Dijon and Auxerre back in top tier.\n\nGermany. Boring, even more than usual. Schalke and Darmstadt got back in.\n\nItaly. Juve's competent only in FM. Parma, Monza and Benevento this year's arrivals from Serie B.\n\nSerbia. It was close but Red Star came first. Javor and Macva are back in the top tier. Again. It's the same couple of sides each time. Dull.\n\nSpain. I... I have no idea what the hell happened here. I'm speechless. But I love every ****ing bit of this. Almeria, Zaragoza and Rayo Vallecano, welcome to the madhouse.\n\nAs for ourselves... We were busy.\n\nOnly one I wanted to keep was Pirgic. But as soon as TSC came sniffing around, he threw a fit so I threw him out. For a price.\n\nThis might seems bit much but it's pretty on point, considering number of players we signed in real life ahead of this season. Only difference is, RL Jedinstvo signed a striker from Nigeria and midfielder from Ghana. Our ingame scouting reach game isn't that great.\n\nBut I feel we did alright. Couldn't always land our #1 target per position but we're in much better shape than we were few months ago.\n\nNikola Njamculović - Straight up replacement for Pirgic.\n\nArton Zekaj - With a move that couldn't possibly cause any sort of controversy in real life, we've got ourselves (most likely) starting DMC from Kosovo. Having been released from Lille, he's back in Serbia, after spending couple of years in both Partizan and Red Star's affiliates.\n\nNemanja Marković - Prearranged transfer. Not exactly the best player in our club. Great name, though...\n\nĐorđe Jovanović - Zekaj's main competition for a place in the starting lineup.\n\nStefan Mitrović - Considering how limited Vujić is, we needed a player of Stefan's profile.\n\nIlija Miodragović - He's more than capable of filling in when Radojičić needs rest.\n\nDragiša Gudelj - Dragiša used to be one of our greatest talents but Netherlands and Spain hasn't been kind to him.\n\nNikola Jadranin - My third choice but will become our new #1 nonetheless.\n\nDragan Vukotić - Despite some of the obvious flaws in his game, Dragan will start beside Gudelj. We had other targets in mind but Jedinstvo wasn't first pick for either of them.\n\nMilan Janjić - Milan should start often for us. Experienced at this level, having spent years and years at Buducnost Dobanovci, who got relegated just last year.\n\nMihajlo Spasojević - Will lead the line for us. Great talent but without place in stuffed Cukaricki side.\n\nAndi Hoti - Prepare for trouble and make it double. Another Kosovan signed with Jedinstvo. Stumbled upon him after getting Zekaj in, randomly checked Kosovo NT and there he was. He's got pedigree, having spent time at Zurich and Inter. Vukotic got himself a proper rival for a place in the starting XI.\n\nIn the end, our squad looks like this.\n\nAll but Andric ready and raring to go.\n\nWe will line up in 4-3-3 formation. Base of which have been shamelessly stolen inspired by Rashidi's recreation of Mikel Arteta's Arsenal for FM 23. It's not 100%, I've made couple of changes but most of the stuff are picked up from there. Check out his channel, it's treasure trove of information and his latest streams with Aston Villa feature a ridiculous number of tactical instructions, in all kinds and shapes.\n\nAs for preseason fixtures, as is always the case with me, opponents don't matter. It's all for whipping us back up in shape and building morale.\n\nOur season officially starts tomorrow, as we travel up to the mountains, where we'll play against Zlatibor.\n\nJedinstvo Ub\n\nApril and May 2023\n\nAnd Season Review, I guess\n\nNow we're getting to the fun stuff...\n\nPrva liga\n\nNot gonna lie, it was a chore getting through this part. With a win against Mladost in a first match post split, our title was all but guaranteed. So I've had bit of a fun with lineups and played around with setups.\n\nDeductions. That sounds a bit pompous, this is just obvious stuff.\n\nWe need fitter fullbacks. All four of them broke down after January.\n\nOur defense falls apart without Gudelj.\n\nAnd we need to do everything in our power to keep that attacking trio, Djordjevic, Vesic, Spasojevic together. They've been ridiculous.\n\nSquad\n\nI genuinely wouldn't mind keeping all of them for our debut season in Superliga. Step up isn't that great, we've played few sides in the Kup and... Yeah, I think we would survive rather comfortably somewhere around the middle.\n\nVujic is a goner, obviously, since he signed with some Slovakian second league side which name I won't even try to pronounce, but, yeah, I'd keep the rest.\n\nSince we've just turned pro, like, literary, second ago, a bunch of new contracts will be handled.\n\nAnd there's Spasojevic. I'm fearing approaching Cukaricki to ask for another loan. He's been ridiculous for us and I dread that \"we're looking to give him a chance in first team\" pop up.\n\nWe'll see.\n\nFinances are alright. Lots of space to fill in that WB. And TB doesn't matter, in Serbia, as long as you're not called Partizan or Crvena zvezda, you ain't paying transfer fees.\n\nBest Players\n\nObviously subjective list.\n\nAleksandar Janković - Janjic might've scored more but Jankovic has been our main creative force this year despite not exactly looking like a creator.\n\nUroš Vesić - Consistent presence on a matchday chart, whether it is for a goal or assist.\n\nMihajlo Spasojević - This list wouldn't be fair without having our top scorer on it. It wasn't even close.\n\nLast, but not least...\n\nFinally!!\n\nStubborn bastards, took them a while.\n\nBut they did it. So, good bastards.\n\nJedinstvo Ub\n\nJuly and August 2023\n\nTransfers\n\nFirst thing first.\n\nFFS!! I've expected it. Still sucks, though.\n\nOne player out. Well, four, if you count in loanees going back to their parent clubs.\n\nSo four new players came in. I don't like bloated squads, especially without euro comps on the table so we'll keep the squad nice and lean at 22.\n\nDušan Stević - First of the two right back signed this summer. I planned to had them fight it out for the starting role but Bojica picked up an injury just two days after his arrival so Dusan became instant starter.\n\nBojica Nikčević - Unlucky fella. Currently getting back up to fitness after spending entire preseason injured.\n\nStefan Šormaz - Our new striker. Not as fast nor tricky as Spasojevic was but seems to have greater understanding of the game.\n\nDejan Kuzmanović - Released from AS Monaco. Serbian u19 international. He'll be great fit for us.\n\nThis is how our squad currently looks like. Gudelj has been moved to the left to accommodate Kuzmanovic in the starting lineup (league rules, you must have one u21 Serb in the XI at all time) and Sormaz got the leading role up front.\n\nWe're currently having bit of an unrest. Because FM.\n\nJankovic got mad literally the second Vujic and Mitrovic left on July 1st, started moaning how we have no cover or any right backs at all.\n\nWhich was true, if you don't count in the fact that we already had two of them lined up on Bosman.\n\nAnd since transfer window in Serbia opens few days later (6th of July), we've got into this mess that still hasn't been resolved, despite my promise to him about us strengthening been fulfilled couple of days later.\n\nIt was fulfilled. I've got a green circle on Promises tab. It's gone from there. Yet the bastard is still unhappy.\n\nTransfer window's open til late September. If he doesn't come to his senses soon, I'll move him. He's not that good for me to tolerate him that much.\n\nFinances\n\nIt's alright. Renewed almost all player contracts and still kept it under the budget. Got another Junior Coaching upgrade. And we're currently overhauling our staff so expecting further losses down the line but nothing serious.\n\nLinglong Tire Super liga\n\nOur Superliga debut isn't exactly going as planned. But IMO, it looks worse than actually is. We shat the bed vs Surdulica at home and away at Radnicki, we really should've won those. No shame in losing to Spartak, who's leading the pack at the moment, and Cukaricki, they're currently stronger than us. We were never getting anything from Partizan so I've sent out our second string, like lambs to slaughter, just to build up their fitness. We have to build up our fitness levels because we haven't had full preseason to prepare. Only got two weeks for it, because reasons. So I'll give it some time. We have some easier games in the next couple of weeks so we'll see.\n\nI'm not panicking. Yet.\n\nKup Srbije\n\nGot past first hurdle. IMT's next.\n\nEdited November 2, 2022 by Constantine\n\nJedinstvo Ub\n\nJanuary and February 2023\n\nTransfers\n\nOne name to add to the departed list, Djordje Vladisavljevic. My neighbor, we're literally one street apart. Talented kid, was on trial at Real Sociedad last summer. It hurt when he didn't want to sign new contract with us and instead opted to go to Krusevac. It's a lovely city but has crappy people. And my NBA fantasy archenemy lives there, so it adds insult to injury. Dammit, Djordje...\n\nTwo bad boys, an experienced left back to replace Djordje and a talented CD. Maybe I should've got another one but two of my primary targets chose other clubs (Cukaricki and Vojvodina) so I've decided to stay under wage budget and keep at it with old man Rajovic till summer.\n\nNikola Marjanović - Vojvodina academy graduate, third best in the country. Spent last two seasons in Superliga with Proleter. For now, Nikola will get his minutes off the bench.\n\nNikola Ninković - Serbian version of Ravel Morrison. Incredible talent in his formative years but without proper mentality to use it fully. Known more for his antics off the pitch. A cautionary tale.\n\nNemanja Mihajlović - Another great talent back in the days. Went out in the world perhaps a bit too early. Struggled in the Netherlands, wandered around Turkey before coming home looking for redemption. Replacement for Doderovic up in the final third.\n\nStefan Milošević - Brought in as a backup and replacement for Djordje but will have to start for us. Since our first choice left back decided to commit a treason too. Pestered him (Sevic) multiple times to sign new contract with us. His excuse was that he's waiting till we could offer him the money he want. And just after transfer window closed, within one single continue, he negotiated and signed with Radnicki and with that doomed himself with having to spend rest of the season on the bench. I'm petty like that.\n\nPretty happy with that. Kristijan Boskovic and Nikola Radojicic signed new contracts. Two years for Radojicic, because I'm sentimental, like him in RL and I want to see him play in Super liga.\n\nMozzart Bet Prva liga\n\nWe just failed to convert our chances. Our opponents did not. Missed a penalty, had goal disallowed, our front three struggled badly despite scoring in abundance in friendlies.\n\nBad day. It happens.\n\nEdited November 14, 2022 by Constantine\n\nJedinstvo Ub\n\nMarch and April 2023\n\nGood news. And the bad. Let's go with good ones first.\n\nIt's in the bag. It was just a matter of time but now it's official. We're going up.\n\nMozzart Bet Prva liga\n\nHad a bit of a scare in April, with those three losses in a row. Didn't even played that bad, we just failed to slot our chances. I know it's weird complaining about that when we have undoubtedly the best attack in the league (that's what the league table says) but still... Anyhow, coming back from behind against Rad at home sealed our promotion. Four games to go and title seems ours to lose.\n\nAnd now we're coming to the bit with bad news. We're victims of our own success.\n\nWe're being ransacked.\n\nFirst victim was Marko Adamovic. He came home from Cyprus after we got promoted to Prva liga. He became perhaps our most proficient midfielder of the three. Suddenly, a call back from Cyprus arrived. Honestly, can't blame him. Better climate, five times bigger pay. It just suck they picked him up in the middle of our promotion hunt.\n\nAfter him, three more followed.\n\nMarko Vujic and Nikola Ristovski are going to random clubs in Slovakia. Both of them played there before so I guess that why they came for them. Ristovski has the same story as Adamovic, played for us years ago, came back when we got to the second tier and now is going abroad. Again. Those two were irreplaceable parts of our midfield. It'll be hard to replace them.\n\nLast one to go (for now, that is) is Igor Milanovic. In the game, he is definitively better player than Karikari. But he's so useless in RL, so clumsy and bad and I guess my bias got the better of me. Always a backup, despite having decent stats (5 goals, 2 assists in 12) so... Bye. Off to Smederevo he goes. Hopefully they'll treat him better than I did.\n\nJedinstvo Ub\n\nSeason Review - 2023/24\n\nWell, the World Cup and work threw my FM schedule into disarray...\n\nOur debut season in Super liga done and dusted. Here's how we've done.\n\nTransfers\n\nAll transfers, bar the last two were prearranged and there was nothing we could've done about it.\n\nThose last two came to fruition at the end of the season but because of the way this game works, our league wasn't reset at the time so they're counting as last season outgoings.\n\nMarjanovic was part of the rotation in our defense but fell behind as we brought in some youngsters. Aleksa Maric is a striker who haven't exactly set the world on fire for us but did enough to impress TSC to offer us 100k for his services.\n\nAdam Viola - We needed some depth and cover for Milosevic. Not even in top 5 of my targets but... Beggars and choosers...\n\nLukijan Abadžija - I loved this kid in last year's game. One of the most talented youngster in the country at his position.\n\nFilip Jović - Player to build our midfield around.\n\nDragan Bojat - He's got everything I'm looking for in a fullback. It's a shame Partizan won't let us have him for the next season.\n\nDejan Kuzmanović - He came, he saw and he's leaving us for Crvena zvezda or Saint Etienne without conquering Serbia with us. It's a shame, I like him but he isn't as good as he was in previous year's edition.\n\nAleksa Marić - Had a decent, if unspectacular season for us before moving on to greener pastures.\n\nStefan Ilić - Our number 1.\n\nCarles Llario - Carles is one of my favorite players from two years ago. Signed him in my Deportivo save and he was ridiculously good, even in Primera. Here's hoping for a reprisal, despite his underwhelming debut season in Serbia.\n\nBjörn Hardley - Former NAC Breda and Man Utd youngster played most of this season out of necessity as a DMC but he'll be back to his natural position in season to come.\n\nGabriele Gori - We needed goals and while he didn't deliver right away, Gabriele showed encouraging signs in his time with us.\n\nThere's also one other player, that doesn't show in this SS, because he was signed before season reset last year.\n\nÞorsteinn Aron Antonsson - Icelandic giant, fresh off after getting released by Fulham, decided to start anew with us.\n\nThe state of our squad. Season has been reset and I stupidly hadn't kept a save from before so this will have to do. I'm sorry I can't show you their stats from our Super liga debut.\n\nSpeaking of which...\n\nMozzart Bet SuperLiga\n\nWe've had good days, we've had bad days. There were times our survival was in question, especially during that dreadful losing streak in second half of the season (we weren't bad, we were just wasteful and down on luck, missing almost every shot while our opponents scored from pretty much every chance they've had) but we snapped out of it after the league split and ended it on a high note.\n\nAvrić was just ridiculous, the lad scored 24 in 35 league games!!\n\nKup Srbije\n\nFirst round exit. Played pretty much a whole backup side and with that in mind, we did well to put two past Vozdovac.\n\nWe were a bit over half a mill in the black. Until I asked the board to improve our training facilities. The cost was too high, 375k. Bloody hell!! That's one of the reasons we're selling Kuzmanovic. And why we let Maric go. We're considering offers for anyone.\n\nThat's about it for now. Here's hoping for more regular updates in days to come.\n\nCheers.\n\nEdited November 26, 2022 by Constantine"
