        "text": "Introduction\n\nAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is a heterogeneous disorder considering its clinical symptoms, rate of progression, neuropathological profiles and biomarkers.1 The factors accounting for this heterogeneity are multiple, including age-at-onset, apolipoprotein E genotype (APOE) and other risk genes, lifestyle factors and comorbidities. The National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association research framework suggested a biological definition of Alzheimer’s disease that is built on biomarkers of β-amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration aiming for more harmonized cohort studies.2 Development of efficient and personalized treatments relies on an in-depth characterization of Alzheimer’s disease heterogeneity.3 As a complement to β-amyloid and tau markers, studies of additional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers provide information on co-existing, inducing and/or interacting mechanisms in Alzheimer’s disease. Identifying additional fluid biomarkers has, therefore, the potential to build a toolbox to stratify patient groups for mechanism-targeted treatment approaches.\n\nFor this study, in addition to core CSF Alzheimer’s disease pathology markers, 13 biomarkers reflecting different mechanisms relevant to brain health were included. Three of these biomarkers are synaptic proteins: synaptosomal-associated protein 25 kDa (SNAP-25), synaptotagmin 1 (SYT-1) and neurogranin (NG). Both SNAP-25 and SYT-1 are implicated in presynaptic neurotransmitter release, whereas NG is a postsynaptic protein involved in the calcium signalling pathway via calmodulin.4 Increased CSF levels of these proteins indicate synaptic dysfunction or loss and have been observed in Alzheimer’s disease4 and preclinical stages.5 Neurofilament light chain (NFL) is a subunit of the neurofilament protein found in the central and peripheral nervous system.6 Its concentration in CSF increases in Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders and it has been proposed to represent a general biomarker of axonal injury.6 Markers of inflammatory processes, shown to be altered in Alzheimer’s disease, were also included in the study: the heterodimeric interleukin-12/23p40 (IL-12/IL-23p40) produced, e.g. by microglia, which influences pro-inflammatory pathways in the brain,7 astrocytic IL-15 that contributes to tissue damage in both neurodegeneration and acute brain injury8 and calprotectin (S100A8/A9) that is an inflammatory mediator produced by glial cells and implicated in Aβ pathology.9 The antioxidant thioredoxin-1 (TRX-1) and its cleaved form, thioredoxin-80 (TRX-80), were also assessed. Both forms have been found to protect from Aβ-induced toxicity,10,11 whereas TRX-80 is depleted in Alzheimer’s disease brains and CSF.12 There are inconsistent data on whether brain TRX-1 levels are affected.10,13\n\nInsulin resistance has been shown to increase the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.14 We measured ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 2 (ENPP-2) (also known as autotaxin), since it has been proposed that increased CSF levels of ENPP-2 in Alzheimer’s disease reflect aberrant brain glucose homeostasis.15 ENPP-2 mechanism of action is to produce the bioactive lipid lysophosphatidic acid that exerts various functions in many tissues as well as in the central nervous system.16 To assess neurovascular function, we analysed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiotensinogen (AGT). VEGF is mostly known for its involvement in angiogenesis, and besides participating in brain vasculature regulation, it influences neurogenesis and neuronal regeneration.17 In Alzheimer’s disease, upregulation of VEGF might reflect attempts to compensate for a dysfunctional vasculature.17 Conversion of AGT to Angiotensin I by renin is one of the first steps in the renin–angiotensin system (RAS). In the brain, AGT is mainly produced by astrocytes.18 CSF AGT has been shown to be elevated in Alzheimer’s disease, as a result of an upregulated RAS.18 Finally, we measured CSF levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OH), a cholesterol metabolite with negative effects on neurons and inflammation.19 Increased 27-OH has been previously linked to memory deficits, Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative conditions.20\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate CSF levels of markers reflecting brain changes in synaptic integrity, inflammation, oxidative stress, altered glucose homeostasis and cholesterol dysmetabolism in memory clinic patient groups without other neurodegenerative diseases or known Alzheimer’s disease comorbidities such as hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and diabetes. In this population with a priori reduced Alzheimer’s disease risk, we wanted to explore whether these pleiotropic markers, alone or in concert with each other, interact with CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease, synaptic degeneration and memory. Samples from memory clinic patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease were analysed. Linear regression models and cluster analysis were performed. Two key biomarkers of the clusters (TRX-1 and AGT) were further analysed by immunofluorescence staining of human control and Alzheimer’s disease post-mortem hippocampal tissue.\n\nResults\n\nCSF study population characteristics\n\nThe demographical and clinical characteristics of the CSF cohort are presented in , stratified by diagnosis. In brief, Alzheimer’s disease participants were significantly older than subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment individuals (P = 0.005), whereas sex distribution did not differ between the three diagnostic groups (P = 0.68). In addition, MMSE score was lower in Alzheimer’s disease compared with the other two groups after age adjustment (P < 0.0001). CSF Aβ42 levels were significantly lower and t-tau higher in Alzheimer’s disease compared with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment participants (P < 0.0001 for both comparisons), while p-tau levels did not differ after age correction (P = 0.108). APOE e4 carriers tended to be more frequent in Alzheimer’s disease patients (P = 0.077). There were no differences in the presence of other known chronic conditions between the groups.\n\nCSF levels of the biomarkers stratified by diagnostic groups and β-amyloid pathology status\n\nAs shown in , we initially explored CSF levels of the individual biomarkers, all stratified by diagnosis. To eliminate the possible confounding effect of age difference between the groups, all analyses were performed after age adjustment. SNAP-25 and NFL differed significantly among the three diagnostic groups. More specifically, SNAP-25 was higher both in Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment versus subjective cognitive decline (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0001, respectively; ). NFL was higher in Alzheimer’s disease compared with both mild cognitive impairment and subjective cognitive decline participants (P = 0.049 and P < 0.0001) and in mild cognitive impairment versus subjective cognitive decline (P < 0.0001; ). No other group level differences could be observed for the rest of the biomarkers.\n\nTRX-80 and calprotectin were not detectable in a sufficient number of CSF samples and thus excluded from further analysis. From a total of 90 individuals, calprotectin was detected in 34, while TRX-80 in 31. No differences were found in the frequency of detectable/non-detectable cases among the diagnostic groups for both biomarkers (P = 0.231 for calprotectin and P = 0.640 for TRX-80) or in the levels among individuals with quantifiable data (P = 0.466 for calprotectin and P = 0.546 for TRX-80; Supplementary Fig. 1A–D).\n\nWhen comparing biomarker levels by amyloid pathology status (A− for CSF Ab42 levels >550 pg/mL, A+ for CSF Ab42 levels <550 pg/mL), we found that several of the investigated markers were higher in A+ versus A− participants; NG (P = 0.021), SNAP-25 (P < 0.0001), NFL (P < 0.0001), 27-OH (P = 0.027), IL-15 (P < 0.001) and TRX-1 (P = 0.041; Supplementary Fig. 2A, C, D, E, I, K). Basic characteristics of the β-amyloid status groups are shown in Supplementary Table 1.\n\nCSF biomarker correlations to age, sex and one another\n\nWe next explored the relationship of each of the markers with sex, age and one another, as well as with the established Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers (Aβ42, t-tau and p-tau). NG and IL-12/IL-23p40 were higher in women than in men (P = 0.037 and P = 0.048, respectively; Supplementary Table 2). Correlations to age and between markers are presented in a correlation map in . Our results show that SNAP-25, NFL, SYT-1, IL-15, TRX-1, as well as Aβ42, t-tau and p-tau, correlated all with age. Aβ42 levels correlated negatively with t-tau, p-tau, SNAP-25, NFL and 27-OH levels. Higher t-tau and p-tau were associated with higher NFL, synaptic markers, IL-15, TRX-1 and AGT. Additionally, 27-OH and t-tau correlated positively. As shown in the correlation map, IL-15, TRX-1 and AGT had the highest number of significant correlations, after the core Alzheimer’s disease and synaptic biomarkers. All three correlated with NFL, synaptic markers, IL-12/IL-23p40, 27-OH and with one another. Moreover, IL-15 correlated positively with VEGF and TRX-1 negatively with ENPP-2.\n\nAssociations between mechanistic biomarkers and key elements of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis\n\nWe further explored whether the investigated biomarkers of cholesterol dysmetabolism (27-OH) vascular function (AGT, VEGF), inflammation (IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-15), oxidative stress (TRX-1) and glucose homeostasis (ENPP-2) are associated with Alzheimer’s disease pathology, synaptic dysfunction, neurodegeneration and cognition. To this end, we performed separate linear regression models with p-tau/Aβ42, SNAP-25, NFL and MMSE score as outcome variables and each of the different biological mechanism biomarkers as regressors. All models were adjusted for age, sex and diagnosis. p-tau/Aβ42 ratio was preferentially selected as a specific marker for Alzheimer’s disease instead of individual markers, as it has been shown to be superior in assessing β-amyloid pathology.32 SNAP-25 was the only synaptic marker that differed between the clinical groups in our material and it has been shown to possess the best discriminatory power to distinguish Alzheimer’s disease from non-Alzheimer patients compared with other synaptic biomarkers28; therefore, we selected it as a synaptic dysfunction outcome measure. The results of the analysis are summarized in . In agreement with our correlation findings, IL-15, TRX-1 and AGT showed the most significant associations. Specifically, IL-15 and TRX-1 were positively associated with p-tau/Aβ42 ratio (β = 0.300, P < 0.0001 and β = 0.451, P < 0.0001, respectively), with SNAP-25 (β = 0.507, P < 0.0001 and β = 0.593, P < 0.0001, respectively) and with NFL (β = 0.371, P < 0.0001 and β = 0.310, P < 0.0001, respectively). AGT was associated with SNAP-25 (β = 0.354, P < 0.0001) and NFL (β = 0.160, P = 0.047). Furthermore, 27-OH and IL-12/IL-23p40 were associated with NFL (β = 0.223, P = 0.007 and β = 0.260, P = 0.001). ENPP-2 showed a negative association with NFL (β = −0.162, P = 0.047). IL-15 was the only marker that was associated with MMSE score (β = 0.259, P = 0.015). No associations could be observed for VEGF. Adding other chronic medical conditions (cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease or osteoarthritis) into each model separately did not change the results (data not shown).\n\nTable 2\n\np-tau/Aβ42\n\nβ (P-value)SNAP-25\n\nβ (P-value)NFL\n\nβ (P-value)MMSE\n\nβ (P-value) Single biomarkers AGT0.103 (0.202)0.354 (<0.001)0.160 (0.047)0.104 (0.301)27-OH0.150 (0.067)0.168 (0.092)0.223 (0.007)0.172 (0.090)IL-12/IL-23p400.074 (0.369)0.134 (0.173)0.260 (0.001)−0.003 (0.977)IL-150.300 (<0.001)0.507 (<0.0001)0.371 (<0.0001)0.259 (0.015)TRX-10.451 (<0.0001)0.593 (<0.0001)0.310 (<0.001)0.094 (0.391)VEGF0.128 (0.117)0.116 (0.240)0.067 (0.419)0.043 (0.673)ENPP-20.018 (0.829)−0.024 (0.809)−0.162 (0.047)−0.148 (0.136) Composites Vascular/metabolic0.143 (0.080)0.298 (0.002)0.115 (0.164)0.047 (0.641)Inflammatory0.237 (0.004)0.374 (<0.001)0.412 (<0.0001)0.141 (0.180)Survival0.357 (<0.0001)0.448 (<0.0001)0.249 (0.003)0.092 (0.390)\n\nStratification of biomarkers into composite scores\n\nWe next aimed to explore if, by grouping the different biomarkers into biological mechanisms, we could extract additional information and increase our understanding of contributing mechanisms to Alzheimer’s disease. We therefore sorted them based on their association with specific biological functions (for references, see Nitsch et al.,7 Janelidze et al.,8 Akterin et al.,10 Arodin et al.,13 McLimans and Willette,15 Herr et al.,16 Lange et al.,17 Cosarderelioglu et al.18 and Loera-Valencia et al.20), resulting into three hypothetical variables, represented as composite scores: vascular/metabolic, inflammation and survival. The vascular/metabolic composite was calculated as a mean of Z-scores for AGT, 27-OH and ENPP-2, the inflammatory composite was the mean Z-score of IL-12/23p40 and IL-15 and survival was the mean Z-score of TRX-1 and VEGF. The distribution of the composite scores among clinical groups is shown in . There were no significant differences between clinical groups for any of the composites. Stratifying the patients into amyloid positive versus negative showed an increased score for the survival component in subjects with amyloid pathology (Supplementary Fig. 3C).\n\nSubsequently, we explored the relationship of each composite score with Alzheimer’s disease pathology (p-tau/Aβ42), synaptic dysfunction (SNAP-25), neurodegeneration (NFL) and cognition (MMSE) in linear regression models adjusting for age, sex and diagnosis ( ). All composite scores were associated with SNAP-25 (β = 0.298, P = 0.002 for vascular/metabolic, β = 0.374, P < 0.0001 for inflammatory and β = 0.448, P < 0.0001 for survival composite). Inflammatory and survival composites were additionally associated with p-tau/Aβ42 (β = 0.237, P = 0.004 and β = 0.357, P < 0.0001, respectively) and with NFL (β = 0.412, P < 0.0001 and β = 0.249, P = 0.003, respectively). None of them were associated with cognition. Adding other chronic medical conditions into each model separately did not change the results (data not shown).\n\nPatient clustering by biological mechanisms\n\nTo assess distinct biomarker profiles within our cohort, we applied a two-step clustering analysis in the whole data set (n = 86, four samples were not eligible due to missing data). This data-driven unbiased clustering was based on the seven relatively unexplored biomarkers related to pathways conferring increased Alzheimer’s disease risk. Two clusters were identified ( ), and the drivers of this stratification were mainly TRX-1, AGT and IL-15. Individuals assigned in Cluster 1 were characterized by parallel increases of CSF TRX-1 (P < 0.0001), AGT (P < 0.0001), IL-15 (P < 0.0001), 27-OH (P = 0.004) and IL-12/IL-23p40 (P = 0.002; and ) compared with Cluster 2. Cluster 1 (n = 32) contained 37% of the cohort population, including 30% of the subjective cognitive decline, 42% of the mild cognitive impairment and 40% of the Alzheimer’s disease groups ( ). In comparison with Cluster 2, individuals in Cluster 1 were older (P < 0.0001), showed higher levels of SNAP-25 and NFL (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.011, respectively) and a tendency to increased p-tau/Aβ42 ratio (P = 0.080; ). No differences in the levels of ENPP-2 (P = 0.224) and VEGF (P = 0.434) were seen between both clusters. Also, both clusters had similar clinical group distributions (P = 0.590, Pearson’s χ2).\n\nTable 3\n\nCluster 1 (n = 32)Cluster 2 (n = 54) P-valueAge68.4 (7.1)63.2 (5.9)<0.0001Female, %62.5%46.3%0.146MMSE27.4 (2.5)25.8 (4.9)0.016p-tau/Aβ420.12 (0.06)0.10 (0.05)0.080SNAP-25, pM17.5 (2.3)15.3 (2.0)<0.0001NFL, pg/mL1654.8 (848.8)1123.5 (551.8)0.011TRX-1, ng/mL5.9 (0.9)4.3 (0.8)<0.0001AGT, ng/mL1646.1 (373.4)1148.7 (234.3)<0.0001IL-15, pg/mL4.1 (0.8)3.1 (0.6)<0.000127-OH, pg/mL1565.5 (0.630.6)1196.2 (486.1)0.004IL-12/IL-23p40, pg/mL6.0 (1.7)5.1 (1.4)0.002ENPP-2, ng/mL310.1 (40.4)323.3 (34.8)0.224VEGF, pg/mL3.9 (0.6)4.0 (1.1)0.434\n\nDespite individuals in Cluster 1 showing increased CSF levels of synaptic biomarkers (suggesting higher neurodegeneration), their overall cognitive performance in MMSE was found higher than in Cluster 2 (P = 0.016; ).\n\nImmunofluorescence staining of TRX-1 and AGT in the human brain\n\nSince TRX-1 and AGT were two of the CSF markers with the strongest associations to neurodegenerative markers and, at the same time, relatively scarcely studied in human brain tissue, we explored their distribution and levels in hippocampal sections from Alzheimer’s disease and non-demented age-matched subjects (controls). Since p-tau was one of the markers where we found correlations to AGT and TRX-1 in the CSF, we co-stained the sections for p-tau. Supplementary Table 3 displays information about the donor characteristics. TRX-1 had a nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution in Alzheimer’s disease and control cases ( ). We did not observe differences in TRX-1 immunofluorescence intensity between the two groups. In control brains, p-tau appeared to be localized mostly in the nuclei, while in Alzheimer’s disease, it was found mainly in the cytoplasm. TRX-1 co-localized with p-tau at a similar extent in both groups ( ). Immunofluorescence labelling for AGT was more pronounced in Alzheimer’s disease than in control samples ( ). In Alzheimer’s disease sections, there was a prominent co-staining between AGT and p-tau (P = 0.004; ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study, we investigated the relationship of CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease and neurodegeneration with markers reflecting disturbances in cholesterol homeostasis, vascular function, inflammation, redox capacity and glucose homeostasis in a memory clinic cohort. Importantly, we selected individuals free of hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension or Type 2 diabetes, to eliminate as possible the contribution of these comorbidities often found in Alzheimer’s disease patients.\n\nWe found that SNAP-25 and NFL were increased in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease compared with the subjective cognitive decline group and as well as in patients with β-amyloid pathology. Together with SNAP-25, CSF levels of the presynaptic protein SYT-1 and the postsynaptic NG are increased in early stages of the Alzheimer’s disease continuum and correlate with cognitive decline, Aβ and tau pathology.5,28,33,34 In our study, NG levels were increased in A+ individuals and tended to be elevated in Alzheimer’s disease patients (though not significantly, P = 0.084), while SYT-1 did not vary across the three clinical groups. In agreement with our results, NFL has been previously found to be upregulated in the CSF of Alzheimer’s disease patients compared with healthy controls as well as in A+ subjects.4,35\n\nAlthough there were no differences in the concentrations of IL-15 and 27-OH between the diagnostic groups, these biomarkers were elevated in A+ subjects. The role of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer’s disease is pivotal,36 and among other cytokines, IL-15 has been implicated in the disease pathology and found to be elevated in patients with pathologic β-amyloid status,8 as in our cohort.\n\nPrevious data on the relationship of 27-OH with β-amyloid pathology in humans are conflicting. It has been shown that CSF 27-OH correlates with sAPP but not with Ab42 levels.37 The increased concentration of 27-OH in A+ patients found here further suggests the link of cholesterol metabolism with Aβ production; however, the underlying mechanisms are yet to be elucidated.\n\nTRX-1, AGT and IL-15 emerged as the biomarkers that showed the highest number of associations with the other individual biomarkers. TRX-1 is a major component of the oxidative stress response machinery.38 In Alzheimer’s disease, this activity is impaired, leading to an imbalance in redox homeostasis.39 So far, CSF TRX-1 levels have not been extensively explored in the context of Alzheimer’s disease. In an earlier study, Arodin et al.13 suggested that TRX-1 was increased in Alzheimer’s disease and in mild cognitive impairment converters. In the present study, there were no differences between the clinical groups. This could be attributed to a discrepancy of the cohorts or to methodological issues, e.g. different assays used to quantify TRX-1. However, TRX-1 was elevated in A+ individuals and was associated with p-tau/Aβ42 ratio, SNAP-25 and NFL, supporting its implication in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. TRX-1 correlated also with the cytokines IL-12/IL-23p40 and IL-15 in our cohort. In line with the presented data, it has been documented that TRX-1 is involved in inflammation by inducing both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes.40 In this study, TRX-1 correlated with AGT and 27-OH, suggesting that it may be implicated in diverse pathological mechanisms occurring in Alzheimer’s disease through its ubiquitous function. Immunohistochemical analyses of human hippocampal samples confirmed the absence of TRX-1 levels changes in Alzheimer’s disease individuals compared with non-demented controls. A co-localization with p-tau was evident in both groups, suggesting a more general, non-Alzheimer’s disease–specific association. A limited number of studies have explored TRX-1 distribution in the human Alzheimer’s disease brain so far, with contradictory results, as TRX-1 was found to be either decreased10,41 or unchanged between Alzheimer’s disease and control brains.13 The discrepancies between the different studies could be attributed to methodological or cohort differences, such as the selection of antibodies, or a population free of common comorbidities as in our material.\n\nHyperactivation of the brain RAS has been linked to Alzheimer’s disease,42 yet data on the levels of AGT in the human Alzheimer’s disease brain and CSF are very limited. A previous study showed AGT upregulation in Alzheimer’s brains,19 while others reported no alterations.43 However, the presence or not of mixed comorbidities in these cohorts was not evaluated. We report here that AGT was associated with NFL and SNAP-25. The effects of RAS activation in the brain are receptor dependent; activation of Angiotensin II Type 1 receptor has a largely negative impact resulting in, e.g. inflammation and oxidative stress, while activation of Angiotensin II Type 2 receptor has a protective role (as reviewed in Cosarderelioglu et al.18). Thus, the observed positive correlation between TRX-1 and AGT may reflect an interplay in the context of enhanced oxidative stress. Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between AGT and 27-OH. Previous in vitro and in vivo work have shown that 27-OH induces AGT production in the brain, implying a connection between hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension in neurodegeneration.44 In agreement with Mateos et al.,19 we show that AGT is increased in post-mortem hippocampal tissue of Alzheimer’s disease donors compared with controls, suggesting an altered AGT synthesis or cleavage independent of the presence of hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia or diabetes. Moreover, AGT co-localized extensively with p-tau in Alzheimer’s disease brains, further supporting its implication in the disease pathology.\n\nInterestingly, p-tau was predominantly located in the nucleus of control brains. Although it is a cytosol-enriched protein, tau has been shown to localize in the nucleus of the mammal brain.45,46\n\nWe followed two distinct strategies to identify pathophysiological profiles that could reflect different cognitive disorder phenotypes, based on the current clinical diagnostic criteria. In both analyses, we included the less explored markers of Alzheimer’s disease–risk pathologies, as the traditional would have probably overpowered the analyses. In the first approach, biomarkers were grouped based on their function, generating three components, i.e. vascular/metabolic, inflammatory and survival. This categorization was challenging as many of these proteins are pleiotropic and could fit in more than one group, still they were categorized based on a meaningful biological relevance. There was no relationship between the clinical and biomarker-based groups, although a tendency towards a higher vascular/metabolic profile in the Alzheimer’s disease group was observed (albeit not statistically significant, P = 0.078). Thus, the amount of contribution from these biological processes was not necessarily reflected in the diagnostic categories. However, when stratifying the patients based on β-amyloid status, the survival component was increased in A+ subjects, a result possibly driven by TRX-1, which could reflect a rebounded mechanism against β-amyloid pathology. All components were associated with synaptic dysfunction, and inflammatory and survival components were associated with an Alzheimer’s disease CSF profile and axonal damage, suggesting a pathophysiological role over the disease continuum.\n\nUsing a data-driven strategy, individuals were stratified into two distinct biomarker-driven clusters. The proteins that contributed the most in the clustering were TRX-1, AGT and IL-15. Individuals in Cluster 1 were defined by higher levels of TRX-1, AGT, IL-15, 27-OH and IL-12/IL-23p40, thus showing an endophenotype characterized by increased oxidative stress, vascular and cholesterol metabolism pathology and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, Cluster 1 consisted of older participants with increased SNAP-25 and NFL compared with Cluster 2. Hence, this could mirror the contribution of these pathophysiological pathways in Alzheimer’s disease progression through a process potentially independent of β-amyloid and tau pathology. Paradoxically, Cluster 1 individuals had a better MMSE score. Interestingly, none of the two clusters was associated with a particular clinical diagnosis. Similarly, both were equally represented in each clinical group, further highlighting the biological heterogeneity observed in Alzheimer’s disease47 even when reducing the number of confounding comorbidities. In this context, precision medicine is the key towards a more effective treatment than the ‘one drug fits all’ concept.48,49 Our work provides further knowledge to assist in the implementation of a personalized treatment where individuals with specific ‘molecular’ profiles linked to Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis could benefit from certain interventions targeting these altered processes.\n\nThe current study comes with some limitations. First, the sample size is relatively small which may explain the lack of between-group differences in most of the individual and combined markers. This may also be due to the fact that this cohort derives from a real-world memory clinic with more heterogeneity in terms of their AD CSF profiles. It should be noted though that the inclusion criteria limited substantially the number of eligible participants. Second, the study was cross-sectional, and therefore, the directionality of the relationships found here cannot be addressed. Third, a correction for multiple comparisons was not applied due to the explorative nature of this study, and therefore, the conclusions should not be generalized. A strength of the study was the selection of individuals not diagnosed or treated for common comorbidities seen in Alzheimer’s disease. Nevertheless, adding groups of individuals with comorbidities would further enhance this assumption."
