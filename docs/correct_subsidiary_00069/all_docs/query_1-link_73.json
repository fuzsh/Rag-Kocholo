        "text": "PORTSMOUTH — Local IBM employees could find themselves commuting farther each morning, especially if they are software designers.\n\nThe company announced on Tuesday that it will build a software campus in Massachusetts next year, comprised of sites in Westford and Littleton, Mass., according to information released on IBM's website.\n\nA projected 3,400 software-related employees from seven offices in Massachusetts and Portsmouth, N.H., will be moved during a phased transition between 2008 and 2010. The new space is not scheduled to be ready before late 2008.\n\nRoughly 45 Portsmouth employees will be impacted, according to a memo circulated to New England employees. Company officials stressed that they would not be reducing jobs, just moving locations, according to the release.\n\nNo one was available for comment at the Portsmouth IBM office this morning. The company plans to maintain its Waltham and Cambridge, Mass., sites.\n\nAccording to the memo, the Littleton location \"will house IBM's software development community, including functions such as support, testing, technical product management and engineering services,\" while the Westford sites will \"house other critical functions, such as marketing, sales, human resources, legal and finance.\"\n\n\"IBM is committed to nurturing the human talent, and economic strengths of the Massachusetts community,\" said Michael Rhodin, senior state executive and general manager, Lotus Software, IBM. \"The state-of-the-art software campus will become a magnet for new and existing employees to innovate, create software and foster their career growth with IBM.\" The location will also be developed as a \"green\" campus, with attention given to sustainability and energy efficiency, he added.\n\nIBM and its subsidiaries employ roughly 5,000 people in New England, most spread across Massachusetts and N.H. The consolidation was prompted by the company's continued expansion, Rhodin said. Since 1995, IBM's software business has grown to include Lotus Development Corp., Rational Software Corp., Ascential Software Corporation, and most recently Watchfire Corporation, based in Waltham, Mass. Acquisitions have created the need to consolidate staff in one location in order to maximize work flow and development.\n\nThe combined group has, since 1995, been awarded 2,773 patents, according to the release."
