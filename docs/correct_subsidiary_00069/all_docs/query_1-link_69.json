        "text": "IBM is to acquire the software firm Telelogic for 5.2bn Swedish kronor (Â£380m).\n\nMalmo-based Telelogic's board unanimously recommended the offer, said Telelogic's chairman, Bo Dimert, on Monday. \"By combining with IBM, Telelogic will have a greater opportunity to accelerate its growth globally and be able to provide customers [with] a more comprehensive solution for complex software development,\" he said.\n\nTelelogic will be incorporated into IBM's Rational Software division, which came about through IBM's purchase of another supplier of software development tools called Rational. \"Software is becoming ubiquitous, from telephones to cars to airplanes to the expanded use of electronics in the automotive industry to increase safety and performance,\" said Danny Sabah, the general manager of the division. \"The acquisition of Telelogic will help our clients drive efficient and effective software-development processes that are vital to product delivery.\"\n\nAccording to analysts at Ovum, Telelogic's availability for sale had been apparent for some time, with IBM and HP being the strongest potential buyers. Principal analyst Bola Rotibi said Telelogic would fill up some gaps in IBM's software-development portfolio, such as enterprise architecture and testing in the embedded space.\n\n\"In terms of culture and ethos, IBM and Telelogic have probably more in common than most of the others in the purchasing frame, with the possible exception of Compuware,\" said Rotibi. \"But we thought that too of IBM and Rational when the former acquired the latter five years ago and look how long it has taken for those two companies to finally settle into a coherent and workable product roadmap.\"\n\nRotibi suggested that IBM had recognised its \"mistakes in the handling of Rational\" and said it was possible that it would \"handle the integration of Telelogic more sensibly and productively\". Noting that Telelogic's Doors requirements-management tool was a particular strength for the company, Rotibi also pointed out that IBM would now dominate the requirements market despite its Rational RequistePro product having \"languished untouched and with no clear strategy or vision of direction\"."
