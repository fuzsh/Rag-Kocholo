        "text": "Acquisition is the 7th transaction between IBM and UNICOM in 24 months\n\nMISSION HILLS, CA – December 31, 2015 – UNICOM Systems, Inc. (“UNICOM”) today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement with IBM Corporation to acquire the IBM Rational System Architect suite of products. The acquisition was completed on December 31, 2015. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\n“This acquisition, the 7th in 24 months between UNICOM and IBM, builds on several of our previous acquisitions with IBM, including our UNICOM Intelligence and Focal Point solutions,” said Mr. Corry Hong, founder, president and CEO. “With the addition of System Architect, these products collectively provide a framework matrix to master structured and unstructured data collection, business process analysis, business intelligence and portfolio management platform solutions. This proficient architectural component is a critical modular-link to formulate IBM’s Watson “Real-Time” predictive analytics, and is a key focus for UNICOM. IBM and UNICOM have established a strong record of successful transitions with our previous transactions and will continue to build on this foundation as we welcome the IBM Rational System Architect customers.”\n\nIBM Rational System Architect includes a suite of products which was originally developed by Popkin Software and acquired in 2005 by Telelogic AB, an R&D arm of Televerket, the Swedish department of telecom. IBM acquired System Architect as part of the Telelogic acquisition in 2008. IBM Rational System Architect is an enterprise architecture solution for visualizing, analyzing, and communicating enterprise architecture and business process analysis, providing decision support, process optimization, and integration into solution delivery. The SA solutions are in use by customers in over 25 countries, across a wide range of industries including Government, Banking, Insurance, Utility & Energy, Technology, Aerospace and Transportation.\n\nThe new UNICOM System Architect solutions will be part of UNICOM System’s TeamBLUE™ organization. TeamBLUE brings a blend of world-class solutions and global teams together with a unified commitment to technology excellence and a history of customer success. UNICOM formed the TeamBLUE organization following several recent acquisitions with IBM, integrating best practices, customer excellence and technical skills across UNICOM's divisions to deliver greater value to customers throughout the world.\n\nThe acquisition of the IBM Rational System Architect suite of products expands and builds on UNICOM’s strategic IT capabilities and offerings which will benefit UNICOM customers, technology and supply-chain partners. UNICOM continues to grow through leadership, capital, and its global presence thereby strengthening existing relationships with Fortune 500 and Global 2000 commercial customers, as well as with OEM, Support Providing Partners, other strategic partners, the U.S. Federal Government, State, Local and Municipal government entities, and with key healthcare providers."
