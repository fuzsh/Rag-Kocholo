        "text": "ALAMEDA, Calif. — June 6, 2011 — Wind River, a world leader in embedded and mobile software, today announced that it has achieved \"Ready for IBM Rational Software\" technical validation for Wind River Test Management, a test automation system for monitoring, executing and managing embedded device software testing. This validation provides IBM Rational customers with assurance that Wind River Test Management has met IBM Rational's requirements for safety, interoperability, and user experience, and integrates seamlessly with IBM Rational Quality Manager.\n\nThe Wind River integration enables bi-directional traceability between requirements and tests as part of the overall software development lifecycle in the Rational Software and Systems Engineering solution. Wind River Test Management allows users to discover un-tested requirements and automatically identify test suites that are impacted by requirements changes. It then generates an optimized test suite comprised of the minimum set of tests that are required to run based on code changes. By focusing test time and resources on what really needs testing, these features provide optimal balance between cost, time, quality and risk, and increased quality of software embedded in complex devices.\n\n\"We are very pleased to announce this formal validation between Wind River and IBM Rational Quality Manager, which allows us to extend our test automation specialization to Rational customers,\" said Ido Sarig, vice president of product marketing at Wind River. \"A lifecycle quality management solution based on the integration will help companies improve their ROI and collaboration across the development lifecycle, reduce costs by increasing automation, and provide better visibility to project status, leading to higher quality and on-time deliveries.\"\n\n\"The integration of Wind River's patented technology with Rational Quality Manager will help product development teams manage business risks using a lifecycle quality management approach,\" said Michael Loria, vice president, IBM Rational Business Development. \"With this integrated solution, users can provide quality management across the whole development lifecycle through the Rational Software and Systems Engineering solution, as well as execute testing where it matters most.\"\n\nWind River will present and exhibit at IBM's Innovate 2011 Conference in Orlando, FL this week. Please visit Wind River Booth #524 to see a demonstration of Wind River Test Management and the integration with IBM Rational Quality Manager.
