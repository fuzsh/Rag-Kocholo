        "text": "3.0 Innovation\n\n3.1 Definitions\n\n3.2 Examples of Innovation\n\n3.3 Incentives\n\n3.4 Interactions\n\nInnovation should be defined using a bounded-rational model of goal-directed behavior. If we assume that political economic agents are rational, consumers maximize their utility in selecting a preferred bundle of goods subject to their budget constraint and producers maximize their profits. Under rationality, any change an agent makes is an innovation by definition because if political economic agents optimize, they do not make mistakes in a deterministic model or in the expected value sense in a stochastic model. In the past several decades research by behavioral psychologists and some economists have shown that human behavior is suboptimal, a condition for which Simon has coined the phrase bounded rational. We first define innovation using a bounded-rational model of behavior. We do this because in such a model change is not necessarily an innovation because bounded rational economic agents can make mistakes. Next, we discuss examples of innovation in goal-directed behavior. Then, we discuss the incentives for innovation. Finally, we discuss the interactions between discovery, invention, and innovation.\n\n3.1 Definition\n\nA simple definition of innovation is a better way of doing things. Individuals and institutions innovate in all their goal-directed behavior that is defined as an effort of an individual or an institution at achieving performance as measured by a criterion, whether objective or subjective. An example of objective goal-directed behavior is the effort of a firm to maximize profits. Another example would be the striving of a politician to obtain reelection. A third example, based on a subjective criterion, is the effort of a consumer to select a purchase most desirable as defined by his or her tastes. Thus, goal-directed behavior and consequently, innovation encompass a broad range of economic, political and social behavior. With respect to such goal-directed behavior, a formal definition of an innovation is the creation or implementation of a new alternative which achieves higher performance as measured by the respective criterion. In discussions of alternatives we will focus much of our attention on the choice between alternative procedures. Thus defined, innovation is a generalization of Schumpeter's definition of innovation for a firm.\n\nLet us now consider an example of innovation in profit maximization. A manager of an existing product line might consider producing the product line at the firm's current plant, contracting the product line to be produced in the Far East, or constructing a new plant which would implement new automation technology. If the manager implements the new automated plant and achieves higher profits, the implementation of this alternative would constitute an innovation.\n\nSince the decision to develop a successful invention by a firm is the selection of an alternative which improves profit-striving performance, inventive activity by firms can be considered a special category of innovation. A point made throughout the book is that invention is quite different from other categories of innovation. For example, property rights for invention differ markedly from property rights for other types of innovation. To keep the terminology as simple as possible, innovation, in all subsequent discussion, will refer to all categories of innovation other than invention. The media, such as BusinessWeek, should use the term innovative firm to indicate a firm that rapidly advances the technology of its products. Under our terminology such a firm would be called inventive.\n\nA discussion of the factors that promote innovation by individuals or groups requires a more detailed description of innovation. Because innovation has been defined as the selection or creation of a new alternative that leads to improved performance in a goal directed behavior, such a description requires a model of goal-directed behavior. In this book the model of goal-directed behavior will combine aspects from bounded rationality and cognitive decision theories9. Also, the model will be based on the empirical fact that decision-makers expend resources in making decisions.\n\nA basic tenet of these theories of behavior is that humans have limited cognitive skills. Let us for now consider human decision unaided by information technology. Most aspects of purposeful behavior are intuitive. Moreover, intuition, is largely a product of the individual's personal history. Individuals perceive selectively, based on prior experience, and given their limited ability to integrate facts, they are sequential problem solvers. To solve a complex problem, then, they must simplify the problem by using heuristics, that is generalizations which enable them to construct a simple model of behavior. In constructing such a model which accounts for prior experience, individuals must mentally reconstruct prior events.\n\nNumerous factors limit the goal-directed performance. Psychological research has cataloged numerous defects in individuals' intuitive judgment and choice processes11. With respect to innovation, judgment is required in evaluating the alternatives. For most tasks individuals must forecast the future behavioral consequences of selecting an alternative. These forecasts are generally intuitive judgments or estimates. Human judgment, however, is dependent upon the order in which data are presented. Confronted with apparently complete data presentations, humans will tend to overlook critical data omissions. Similarly, too much data can overload human mental capacities, thereby reducing consistency of judgment. Also, humans are poor at making nonlinear forecasts such as predicting the social implications of the advances in computation.\n\nIn any human data acquisition and processing of a large number of alternatives we assume humans are sublinear processors in the sense that human data acquisition and processing is so slow that it is prohibitively expensive for a human to apply even the simplest linear operator such as a single observation per alternative for a large set such as 250,000. The same is true for even a simple operation such as addition on a large amount of data. Prior to the rise of information technology humans developed numerous approaches to process large numbers of alternatives using sublinear processes. We shall call this conjecture the sublinear hypothesis.\n\nConsider, for example, the economic model of a consumer maximizing his utility in purchasing a bundle of goods. First the consumer purchases goods sequentially to reduce the number of alternatives to be considered. For example, suppose a consumer actually considered purchasing goods in bundles and not sequentially. If the bundle had only two goods and there were 10 alternatives for the first good and 10 alternatives for the second good, the sequential approach has 20 alternatives to consider whereas the bundle approach has 100. That is the sequential approach is additive while the bundle approach is multiplicative. If we consider a bundle of ten goods with ten alternatives each, considering all possible bundles involves 1010 = 10,000,000,000 alternatives, whereas the sequential approach involves only 10 x 10 = 100 alternatives. Second, suppose Barnes and Noble Book Store with over 250,000 books simply piled all the books in a big heap so that each customer had to look through the pile to find the book he or she wanted. If the process only took a second per book, on average each customer would expend almost 35 hours to find a desired book. In order to facilitate the customer using a sublinear process, Barnes and Noble organizes the books into categories with a map showing their location. Thus, the customer can immediately select the desired subset and use more complex selection processes on a small number of alternatives. Stores in general facilitate customers using sublinear decision rules to narrow their search to a small number of alternatives.\n\nHumans have considerable ability to recognize patterns that enable them to eliminate sets of alternatives without expending energy. For example, human grand masters in chess have superior skills in recognizing patterns of pieces on the board that enables them to focus on a small number of alternatives for the next move. In contrast computer chess processes all of the extremely large number of moves that can occur when all move possibilities are considered.\n\nAnother approach of decision makers to reduce their effort is to have subordinates prune the list of alternatives such as potential employees or candidates for admission to law school such that they can focus on the subset that requires their attention. In addition, aggregation reduces the amount of effort to evaluate alternatives. In large corporations or government bureaucracies, data is aggregated as it proceeds up the hierarchy. This reduces the effort of senior managers in analyzing performance.\n\nAnother heuristic to reduce a complex task involving a large number of alternatives to a subset is to seek the satisficing rather than the optimal alternative10. Simply put, an individual faced with a large number of alternatives will seek a good, but not necessarily the best, alternative. Once he or she finds the good alternative the individual ignores the alternatives not already processed.\n\nMoreover, most judgment situations involve uncertain phenomena for which man lacks the neurological circuits for optimal intuitive processing. One example is that humans do not always have transitive preferences. Another defect is handling uncertain phenomena, such as man tends to assume erroneously that the characteristics of a small sample are characteristic of the general population. Furthermore, in combining uncertain data, humans tend to favor the concrete over the abstract. Also, in judgment situations where they should combine new data with old data, humans will frequently ignore the old data. When they do combine the two, they are generally more conservative than optimal.\n\nTo illustrate the problems individuals have in combining uncertain data, consider the problem of forming a judgment concerning the reliability of a new automobile. If a friend has recently bought a model which turned out to be a lemon, this concrete data will tend to be given much more weight than a previously conducted study indicating that the model, on average, is reliable. The individual may, in fact, ignore the statistical study altogether. To illustrate the conservative nature of data on judgment consider the forecast that in the 90's US automobiles should become as reliable as the Japanese automobiles. But because Americans are likely to rely more on experience than statistical studies, there will be a time lag before the public acquires the general perception that US automobiles are as reliable as the Japanese.\n\nIn addition to affecting human judgment, cognitive limitations also affect the ability of individuals to make choices. Two aspects of making choices in goal-directed behavior are generating the objective and selecting among alternatives Individuals must constantly adjust the objectives of their tasks to new conditions in a political economy with a rapid rate of discovery, invention, and innovation. The basic assumption underlying these adjustments is that the objectives generated by individuals are, in fact, only estimates of the true objectives. Moreover, experimental evidence demonstrates that individuals do not form consistent objectives12 and tend to confound their beliefs about behavior with their preferences or tastes. In making choices man uses rules of thumb-- simple common sense rules to select alternatives--to reduce the mental effort.\n\nGiven the human limitations, the question becomes whether or not human performance ever approximates the optimal performance suggested by rational man theories of behavior. Tasks which are repeated offer individuals and organizations an opportunity to improve their performance. Competition provides strong incentives to constantly improve one's performance, but competition in the sense of the survival of the fittest only guarantees that a successful firm keep more efficient than its rivals not that it achieves a true optimum. We assume that the higher the rate of change in terms of technological advance and the more variations in prices the further individuals and organizations will be from their optimal solutions.\n\nSecond, we assume that there is a tremendous variation in the complexity of tasks to be solved in goal-directed behavior. For example, consider the problem of scheduling. If a firm makes a single product for a customer with a steady demand, the scheduling problem is simple to solve. But, scheduling in its most general case of multiple products, multiple machines, and multiple variable demands is an NP problem that is not tractable even with computers. The human heuristic solution prior to computers to the problem of scheduling was to produce for inventory. The latest scheduling algorithms that produce good approximations to difficult scheduling problems are genetic algorithms. In the case of difficult scheduling problems, humans without computers will not converge to a good solution in that inventory brings in no return until it is sold, and even with computers humans will only approximate the optimal solution.\n\nAt any particular time human performance can be far from optimal. Consider the consumer. Because it is efficient to purchase goods sequentially, consumers must solve a budget allocation problem over time. Given the number of consumers who have problems with credit card debt, learning to budget over time is a difficult problem to solve. Also, consumers can make major mistakes in individual purchases because determining the attributes of products in the marketplace can be very expensive. Recently, it became public knowledge that some brands of latex paint contain mercury and arsenic and that children in houses and apartments painted with such paint suffered harm. Yet because of the cost involved, individual consumers almost never consider performing chemical analysis of the products they buy, assuming, sometimes erroneously, that they will be protected by government agencies or the product liability laws. Also, humans can make errors with dire consequences in judgment in predicting future behavior involving such factors as reliability and safety. For example, consumers who bought three wheeled recreational vehicles have tragically lost children in accidents when these vehicles turned over.\n\nFirms and governments are also prone to serious errors in goal-directed behavior even though institutions generally expend much greater resources in decision-making than individuals do. For example, in the 80s General Motors tried to automate their plants ahead of the state of the art and were forced to back off with their Saturn plant. Ford and Chrysler were more successful with more modest automation. Firms have, on occasion, introduced duds into the marketplace such as Ford's introduction of the Edsel or IBM's introduction of the PCjr to the home computer market. Government legislation is usually based on some theory of behavior. When theories change, government policies are frequently wrong in relationship to the new theories. For example, much 30s legislation was to prevent competition from bankrupting existing firms. An example is regulation Q that curtailed competition among banks. After WWII the world economy became increasingly competitive making this 30s anticompetitive legislation a drag on the economy because regulation Q was a a factor in each recession until repealed in Reagan's administration in 1980.\n\nBecause both individuals and institutions are prone to making serious errors in decision-making, what constitutes an innovation is far from obvious. Innovation is not synonymous with the selection of a new alternative. To determine what constitutes an innovation requires a procedure for judging whether the selection of a new alternative improves performance. The problem is to determine the objectives for which performance is to be measured. Because individuals, firms and the government face constant technological change, their respective generated objectives are assumed to be only estimates of their true objectives. This creates a problem because innovation should be defined as the selection or creation of a new alternative which improves the performance of a goal-directed task as measured against the true, but unknown objective.\n\nLet us start to solve this problem by considering the properties of the true, but unknown objectives. Because true objectives can not be precisely defined, criteria are needed by which to judge whether the creation and implementation of a new alternative by an individual, firm, or government is an innovation. It is assumed that the true, but unknown objective of a firm should be to maximize profits. While this may appear objective and clearly defined, an obvious issue is to what extent should a firm emphasize short term profits in relationship to long term gains. Also, how the profit motive for the entire firm should be transcribed to the objectives of subordinate units within the firm is not a simple problem. For the firm, the selection of a new alternative can be considered an innovation if the change increases profits. In a competitive market, then changes which persist and are imitated can be considered innovations.\n\nAlso, a long time and a great deal of discovery and invention may be required to make a change an innovation. First let us consider the innovation of replaceable parts. This idea was possibly first employed by Eli Terry in the manufacture of wooden clocks around 1800. Eli Whitney, who is generally credited with the idea, put in a great deal of effort improving the accuracy of machine tools to make this innovation successful. Another innovation is the use of the electric motor which was first introduced in the 19th century. But it was not until the 1920s that the use of electric motors could be observed to improve productivity. A more recent example is the use of desktop computers in the workplace in the 80s. It has taken numerous advances in software and communications to make the use of desktop computers an innovation currently.\n\nThe true, but unknown objective of government will be given the archaic term, ``to promote the common weal'', in order to distinguish the concept from contemporary social welfare theory based on utility theory23. Social welfare theory has provided results of limited usefulness for social system design. Arrow has demonstrated that it is impossible to create a social welfare function from individual preferences that satisfies a small number of reasonable assumptions. Also, the Pareto criterion for evaluating alternative social alternatives is of no practical usefulness in that there are always losers and winners in the move from one social state to another.\n\nWe shall instead focus our attention on a different political problem. The task of government to promote the common weal involves the responsibility to deal with external threats, maintain internal order, promote prosperity and ensure the quality of life. No agreement, however, exists in identifying the basic elements of the common weal or in estimating the tradeoffs between them. What we will focus on is having policies that can be evaluated by measurable criterion. In general, the selection of a new alternative by government can be considered an innovation if the new alternative has the properties of consistency, efficiency, and general benefits. If the interested reader wishes, he or she could consider the impact of alternative criteria on the design. The lower the level of government, the more competition there is among governments competing for resources such as firms investing in new plant and equipment in their domain. In these activities change will be considered an innovation if it is copied and persists.\n\nIn the case of the individual even less can be stipulated. It can only be said, at this point, that the true, but unknown objective of individuals is not considered to be equivalent to the desires of the individual. For example, the desire for drugs by a drug addict is not in the drug addicts long term interests. Change in individual tasks can be considered an innovation if it persists, is imitated and does not diminish the common weal. The final requirement of not diminishing the common weal is needed to eliminate pathological behavior such as drug addiction.\n\nLet us summarize our theory of behavior to emphasize the most important points for subsequent reference:\n\nMan is an approximate optimizer who can make serious errors\n\nPerformance improves in repeated tasks, but does not necessarily converge to optimal performance\n\nPerformance is problem specific to the difficulty of the task\n\nIn dealing with large numbers of alternatives humans use sublinear procedures\n\nChange is not necessarily an innovation\n\nCriteria are needed to distinguish between change and innovation\n\nA great deal of discovery and invention and a considerable effort over a long time may be required to make a change into an innovation.\n\n3.2 Examples of Innovation\n\nNow having defined criteria for determining what is an innovation, let us consider some specific cases. Let us start by considering an example of change that was not an innovation. The creation of an organizational structure with fourteen levels of management at General Motors as compared with five at Toyota was not an innovation13. Currently, General Motors is struggling to achieve a more horizontal organization.\n\nLet us now consider a few examples of innovation by firms in the task of production. Two important innovations in the 19th century were the concept of the assembly line and interchangeable parts. To recent innovations in production have been the reduction in work in progress through just in time and MRP inventory control and the application of statistics to reduce defects in products. Not every change in production is an innovation. General Motors in the 80s tried to advance automation of their assembly plants beyond the state of the art and was forced to back down in the creation of the plant to produce Saturns.\n\nBecause tasks have a hierarchical structure, innovation can also take place in the decision-making process and in the execution of a task. The model of goal-directed behavior implies that each of the steps in a task can, in itself, be considered a subordinate task. Thus, an innovation in the task of production can be a new, superior way to determine alternatives. For example, computer manufactures can now use PCOrder14 to obtain a complete online organization of the components to build PCs, complete with current prices. Using this software is an innovation because it greatly reduces the time and cost of evaluating alternatives and purchasing the desired components. In general, innovations in the first four steps of a task can be classified as innovations in the decision-making process, and innovations in the fifth step can be described as an innovation in the execution of a task.\n\nInnovation in the decision-making process can also occur in estimating the objective. A problem in large firms is creating objectives for subordinate units in the firm so that the performance of the subordinate units best contributes to the profit maximization the firm. One recent example in this regard is total quality management, TQM, which focuses subordinate units is providing good service to customers. Because TQM has been widely imitated in competitive industries, this change qualifies as an innovation.\n\nInnovations which improve all aspects of task performance are frequently new forms of organization and incentive systems. The original form of the manufacturing corporation was called a functional organization. Coordination of the firm took place between the president and the vice presidents in charge of manufacturing, finance and other functions of the firm. Managers below the level of the vice presidents were specialists such as accounting managers. As manufacturing firms increasingly began to manufacture multiple products this form of organization exhibited a growing defect--that managers were more sharply focused on their functional specialties than on the profits of the various products and product lines. The resulting shift from functional organization to profit-oriented divisional organization in the 1920's was a change which more sharply focused managerial attention on the profits of each product by coupling managerial rewards to the profits of their respective products.15. Since profit-oriented divisional organization has persisted and has been widely imitated, this change is an innovation.\n\nIn the realm of government, an example of innovation in the task of distributing social security checks is direct deposit into the bank accounts of the recipients for the sake of convenience and security. A new tax loophole, however, would not be considered an innovation since such a loophole would lack general benefits. Innovation in the decision-making process can also occur generating the governments estimate of the true, but unknown objective. For example, the framers of the constitution incorporated checks and balances into the governmental design in order to achieve a good estimate of the common weal. Subsequently, in the 20th century the political reforms, such as direct election of senators, campaign finance laws, and the principle of one-man one-vote, have sought to make the political process more representative. These changes have had a profound effect of the estimate of the common weal. Many social observers consider these changes innovations26.\n\nAn example of individual innovation in the task of working is telecommuting by professionals, whereby professionals perform their work from their homes or local offices through a computer communications network instead of having to travel to the central workplace25. Another individual innovation in the task of maintaining a financial assets portfolio is the use of personal computers together with information services, such as the Dow Jones Information Service, to identify, evaluate, and buy and sell alternative financial assets. The emergence of a lifestyle based on smoking crack would not be considered an innovation, however, as the common weal is diminished by the loss of productive capability and the increased likelihood of crime and child neglect.\n\n3.3 Incentives\n\nThe incentives for innovation are neither fame nor intellectual property. The incentives for innovation are simply achieving better performance in a goal-directed activity. A firm in a competitive market has strong incentives to constantly innovate to maintain a competitive edge over its rivals.\n\nCurrently, invention is promoted by intellectual property, whereas most aspects of innovation are not. Moreover, it is doubtful that an intellectual property right in the form of a patent could be created for innovation, since innovation is not a precisely defined object but rather the implementation of a concept by an individual, firm, or government. Frequently, each implementation of the concept is specific to the implementer. Moreover, advances in innovation are generally incremental. This means that few innovations would have such clear definition and originality to merit the equivalent of a patent.\n\nThe fact that innovation is not protected by property rights means that the motivation for innovation is to improve the performance of a goal-directed task itself rather than to sell innovation as a product on the market. Because innovation lacks intellectual property rights, any success by an innovator will be rapidly imitated16 in a competitive market. Nevertheless, for some types of innovation, the innovator has positive incentives to promote imitation. For example, innovations by government are imitated by other governments at the same level, and officials responsible for the innovation enhance their reputations by providing the details to interested imitators. A business innovator can obtain financial rewards for promoting imitation of an innovation by establishing a consulting service or by writing a how-to book.\n\nAlso, because innovation lacks intellectual property rights, businessmen have mixed motives concerning the dissemination of innovation. Firms generally prefer to maintain secrecy about innovations which give them an advantage over their rivals, unless, of course, there are considerable profits to be made from creating a consulting service to sell their expertise in creating the innovation. On the other hand, firms have a great incentive to disseminate knowledge about innovations based on inventions they are selling, and the extension of copyrights to software provides similar incentives for software firms to disseminate information about innovations based on their software.\n\nWe shall assume the government officials enjoy the exercise of power and that they generally have strong incentives to get reelected. For lower levels of government that are in fierce competition with other governments to promote growth and prosperity in their domains, reelection incentives generally coincide with innovation. The higher the level of government the less competition among governments is a factor. At the federal level of government we assert it is the design of the system of checks and balances is what couples the desire to get reelected to innovation.\n\nInnovation among individuals is motivated by better performance and the rewards of being an innovator."
