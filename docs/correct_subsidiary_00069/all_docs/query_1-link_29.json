        "text": "My team is new to Rational tools. I am completing a solution design that was started in MS Visio and that may also have a number of technical requirements for the team to implement. I am now getting into RRC (Rational Requirements Composer) and I may be able to get access to our enterprise install of RSA (Rational Software Architect).\n\nMy question is which is more appropriate - use RRC or RSA for the solution diagram? From my reading, RRC diagrams are intended to be more for use cases or process flows. My solution design is not really a flowchart or process flow although I can certainly use a flowchart to document what is needed for the design.\n\nDoes it matter whether I use RRC or RSA? If I use RRC now, how hard is it for me to transfer the diagram to RSA later?"
