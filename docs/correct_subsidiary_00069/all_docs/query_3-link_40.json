        "text": "ARMONK, N.Y., April 22, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced it has acquired UrbanCode Inc. Based in Cleveland, Ohio, UrbanCode automates the delivery of software, helping businesses quickly release and update mobile, social, big data, cloud applications.\n\n(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090416/IBMLOGO )\n\nMobile, social, big data and cloud technologies are driving demand for new, faster and more frequent approaches to software delivery. Waiting days or even months to get an update to clients is no longer acceptable. With UrbanCode's technology, businesses can reduce the cycle time it takes to get updates or new applications into market, from months to minutes. This approach is designed to help reduce cost and risk, while helping address changing client needs by enabling a company to rapidly incorporate feedback into and improve the overall quality of their applications and services.\n\nUrbanCode's software is a natural extension of IBM's DevOps strategy, designed to simplify and speed the entire software development and delivery process for businesses. The new capabilities also enhance IBM SmartCloud and IBM MobileFirst initiatives by making it easier and faster for clients to deliver software through those channels. For example, by combining UrbanCode software with the IBM Worklight technology, businesses can now author and deploy an application for any mobile device in hours, versus a previous multi-day timeline. The UrbanCode solution also works with traditional applications including middleware, databases and business intelligence.\n\nA recent study by the IBM Institute for Business Value uncovered that almost 70 percent of companies using software development for competitive advantage outperform their peers in profitability. As innovation in software becomes more and more critical to success, businesses need a collaborative, intuitive and continual approach to development, testing and delivery.\n\n\"Companies that master effective software development and delivery in rapidly changing environments such as cloud, mobile and social will have a significant competitive advantage,\" said Kristof Kloeckner, general manager, IBM Rational Software. \"With the acquisition of UrbanCode, IBM is uniquely positioned to help businesses from every industry accelerate delivery of their products and services to better meet client demands.\"\n\nTogether UrbanCode and IBM technology will be unmatched in the industry, providing businesses a continuous process for developing, testing, and delivering new and updated software,\" said Maciej Zawadzki, chief executive officer, UrbanCode. \"By removing the bottlenecks that traditionally exist between development teams and production systems, businesses can drive rapid innovation.\"\n\nMore than half of surveyed companies agree effective software development is crucial to competitive advantage. Yet, only a quarter of companies feel they have effective methods. UrbanCode's capabilities will help solve this execution gap with the ability to accelerate software delivery.\n\nIBM plans to continue to support UrbanCode clients and enhance their technologies while allowing these organizations to take advantage of the broader IBM portfolio.\n\nFor more information please visit:http://www.ibm.com/software/rational/.\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nErica Topolski\n\nIBM Media Relations\n\n+1 617 803 7665\n\n[email protected]\n\nSOURCE IBM"
