        "text": "There exists a humongous book edited by Hall and Rosenberg that shares title with this post, counting 1256 pages. I've recently read it, and here I'll provide a summary of it. I will include mostly things that I considered interesting, shocking or illustrative. There is no other way to cover a work that large in a blog post. There are also two more considerations I'm making to ease my work: Concentrating on empirical results (No discussion of modeling here), and avoiding reporting results that are mixed, unless it seemed a priori clear to me that the evidence pointed one way or another. Take into account that hat it seems interesting tome will differ from what seems interesting to you.\n\nNote that the Handbook summarises the state of the art in the field of the economics of innovation as of 2010. So there are five years that are not covered. For example, Boldrin and Levine work against intellectual property. Also, the Handbook is full of 'we don't know', 'there is contradictory evidence', 'we need more research', etc. In general, we don't know as much about innovation as we'd like, and this derives from the time lags involved, the definitional problems of what counts and what doesn't, and so on.\n\nThe Handbook comes in two volumes divided by chapters, here I will just summarise by chapter.\n\nChapter 1: Introduction to the Handbook (Hall and Rosenberg)\n\nAn explanation of what will come in the chapters that follow\n\nChapter 2: the contribution of economic history to the study of innovation and technical change: 1750-1914 (Hall and Rosenberg)\n\nThe progress of technology has been explained by both internalist and externalist theories. Internalists see an autonomous logic, an evolutionary process in which one advance leads to another, in which contingency plays a major role, in which the past largely determines the future. Externalists think of technological change as determined by economic needs, by necessity stimulating invention, by induced innovation being guided by factor prices and resource endowments. In the same camp, but with a different emphasis are social constructionists who regard technology as the result of political processes and cultural transformations, in which certain ideas triumph in the marketplace because they serve certain special class or group interests and powerful lobbies. The history of technology since the Industrial Revolution provides support as well as problems for all of those approaches. A more inclusive approach would separate the process into interactive components. For instance, there is no question that economic needs serve as a “focusing device” in Rosenberg’s (1976) famous simile, but the popular notion that “necessity is the mother of invention” manages to be simultaneously a platitude and a falsehood. Societies tend to be innovative and creative for reasons that have little to do with pressing economic need; our own society is a case in point. Modern Western society is by and large wealthy enough to not feel any pressing “need,” yet it is innovative and creative beyond the wildest dreams of the innovators of the eighteenth century. There was no “necessity” involved in the invention of ipods or botox. The social agenda of technology is often set by market forces or national needs, but there is nothing ever to guarantee that this agenda will be successful and to make sure what it willlead to. [...] This essay will not be an exercise in technological determinism. Technology does not “drive” History. Improvements in technological capabilities will only improve economic performance if and when they are accompanied by complementary changes in institutions, governance, and ideology. It is never enough to have clever ideas to liberate an economy from an equilibrium of poverty. But it is equally true that unless technology is changing, alternative sources of growth such as capital accumula- tion or improved allocations of resources (due, for instance, to improved institutions such as law and order and a more commerce-friendly environment) will ineluctably run into diminishing returns. Only a sustained increase in useful knowledge will in the end allow the economy to grow, and to keep growing without limit as far as the eye can see. I have explored the relation between useful knowledge and technology in Mokyr (2002). The basic proposition of this essay will be that the technological component of economic modernity was created in the century before the Industrial Revolution, not through the growth of foreign trade, the emergence of an urban bourgeoisie, or the growing use of coal (as has often been argued) but by a set of intellectual and ideological changes that profoundly altered the way Europeans interacted with their physical environment. By that I mean both how they related to and studied the physical world in which they lived and the ways they manipulated that knowledge to improve the production of goods and services.\n\nChapter 3: Technical change and industrial dynamics as evolutionary processes (Dosi and Nelson)\n\nAn important part of paradigmatic knowledge takes the form of design concepts which characterize in general the configuration of the particular artifacts or processes that are operative at any time. Shared general design concepts are an important reason why there often is strong similarity among the range of particular products manufactured at any time—as the large passenger aircrafts produced by different aircraft companies, the different television sets available at the electronics stores, etc. Indeed, the establishment of a given technological paradigm is quite often linked with the emergence of some dominant design Together, the foregoing features of technological paradigms both provide a focus for efforts to advance a technology and channel them along distinct technological trajectories, with advances (made by many different agents) proceeding over significant periods of time in certain relatively invariant directions, in the space of techno-economic characteristics of artifacts and production processes. As paradigms embody the identification of the needs and technical requirements of the users, trajectories may be understood in terms of the progressive refinement and improvement in the supply responses to such potential demand requirements. A growing number of examples of technological trajectories include aircrafts, helicopters, various kinds of agricultural equipment, automobiles, semiconductors, and a few other technologies (Dosi, 1984; Gordon and Munson, 1981; Grupp, 1992; Sahal, 1981, 1985; Saviotti, 1996; Saviotti and Trickett, 1992). So, for example, technological advances in aircraft technologies have followed two quite distinct trajectories (one civilian and one military) characterized by log-linear improvements in the tradeoffs between horsepower, gross takeoff weight, cruise speed, wing load, and cruise range (Frenken and Leydesdorff, 2000; Frenken et al., 1999; Giuri et al., 2007; Sahal, 1985; and more specifically on aircraft engines Bonaccorsi et al., 2005). Analogously, in microelectronics, techni- cal advances are accurately represented by an exponential trajectory of improvement in the relationship between density of electronic chips, speed of computation, and cost per bit of information (see Dosi, 1984, but the trajectory has persisted since then). First, as Schumpeter, and Marx before him, argued long ago, competi- tion in industries where innovation is central has little to do with the idea that such process generates results that are economically “efficient” in the standard static sense of that concept in economics. What is driving the process is the striving by some firms to get an economic advantage over their competitors. As discussed in Section 3, both the cross section and the time profiles of modern industrial sectors inevitably show considerable variation across firms in measures of economic efficiency and in rofitability: in short, industries are characterized by considerable and persistent “inefficiency” in the standard allocative sense of that term. Second, in industries marked by continuing innovation, competi- tive conditions may be fragile. This applies particularly to the cases whereby firms who have been successful innovators are able to hold off imitation or other effective competitive responses, and their profitability enables them to stretch their advantage further. Third, this notwithstanding, while the evolutionary notion of “competition” differs from competition of the economic textbooks in fundamen- tal respects, it does serve a related function. To the extent competition is preserved, a significant share of the benefits of technological progress go to the customers/users of the technology. And on the supply side, over industrial evolution, competition tends to roughly keep prices moving in line with costs (including R&D costs). This is the bird eye interpretation of innovation-driven competition and the ensuing industrial evolution. How well does it hold against the evidence? (i) Innovative capabilities appear to be highly asymmetric, with a rather small number of firms in each sector responsible for a good deal of innovatios even among highly developed countries. (ii) Somewhat similar considerations apply to the adoption of innovations, in the form of new pro- duction inputs, machinery, etc. (see Section 3.9 on “diffusion”) revealing asymmetric capabilities of learning and “creative adaptation.” (iii) Differential degrees of innovativeness are generally persistent over time and often reveal a small “core” of systematic innovators (cf. Bottazzi et al., 2001a; Cefis, 2003b; Cefis and Orsenigo, 2001; Malerba and Orsenigo, 1996a among others). (iv) Relatedly, while the arrivals of major innovations are rare events, they are not independently distributed across firms. Rather, recent evidence suggests that they tend to arrive in firm-spe- cific “packets” of different sizes. 55 [...] in several studies, firms that are identified as innovators tend to be more profitable than other firms: see Geroski et al. (1993), Cefis (2003a), Cefis and Ciccarelli (2005), Roberts (1999), and Dosi (2007) among others. Production efficiency also shows a systematic positive influence upon profitability (cf. Bottazzi et al., 2009; Dosi, 2007). [...] Finally, the same evidence appears to run against the conjecture, put forward in the 1960s and 1970s by the “managerial” theories of the firm on a tradeoff between profitability and growth with “manage- rialized” firms trying to maximize growth subject to a minimum profit constraint [...] significant industry-specific differences emerge from the data. The finding that variables like capital intensity, advertising intensity, R&D intensity—along with structural measures like concentration and performance measures like profitability—differ widely across sectors is at the very origin of the birth of industrial economics as a discipline. Longitudinal microdata add further evidence.\n\nChapter 4: Fifty years of empirical studies of innovative activity and performance\n\nA literal reading of Schumpeter’s (1942) classic discussion suggests that he was primarily impressed by the qualitative differences between the innovative activities of small, entrepreneurial enterprises and those of large, modern corporations with formal R&D laboratories. Nonetheless, the empirical literature has interpreted Schumpeter’s claim for a large firm advantage in innovation as a proposition that innovative activity increases more than proportionately than firm size. 2 With some exceptions (e.g., Gellman Research Associates, 1976; Nelson et al., 1967; Pavitt et al., 1987; Scherer, 1965a) the Schumpeterian hypothesis about firm size has been tested by regressing some measure of innovative activity (input or output) on a measure of size. [...] Notwithstanding the various challenges in evaluating the R&D–firm size relationship, the consensus is that either in the majority of industries, or when controlling for industry effects in more aggregate samples, R&D rises proportionately with firm size among R&D performers (e.g., Baldwin and Scott, 1987; Scherer and Ross, 1990). Although the source of this relationship had not been determined, the finding was widely interpreted through the mid-1990s as indicating that, contrary to Schumpeter, large size offered no advantage in the conduct of R&D. The intuition behind this interpretation is that, if the relationship is proportional, then, holding industry sales constant, the same amount of R&D will be conducted whether an industry is comprised of large firms or a greater number of smaller firms. Fisher and Temin (1973) argued, however, that to the extent that Schumpeter’s hypothesis can be given a clear formulation, it must refer to a relationship between innovative output and firm size, not to a relationship between R&D (an innovative input) and firm size, which is the one most commonly tested in the literature. They demonstrated, among other things, that an elasticity of R&D with respect to size in excess of one does not necessarily imply an elasticity of innovative output with respect to size greater than one Both before and subsequent to Fisher and Temin’s critique, however, several studies exploiting measures of innovative output reinforced the earlier consensus of no advantage to size. Scherer (1965a), Gellman Research Associates (1976, 1982), The Futures Group (1984), Pavitt et al. (1987) and Acs and Audretsch (1988, 1990, 1991b) have shown that, in either panel or cross-sectional data spanning a broad range of firm sizes, smaller firms tend to account for a disproportionately large share of innovations relative to their size, and that R&D productivity (e.g., innovations per unit of R&D) tends to decline with firm size. Bound et al.’s (1984) analysis of patenting activity similarly found that patents produced per R&D dollar for smaller firms (i.e., less than 1 million dollars in sales) is considerably higher than that for larger firms. Acs and Audretsch (1990, 1991b) provide evidence that this pattern varies, however, across industries. Also, Pavitt et al.’s (1987) findings, based on the SPRU data set that counts the successful introduction of “significant” new products or processes, suggest that the relationship may be somewhat U-shaped, with the very largest firms displaying relatively high R&D productivity, defined as simply the number of innovations per R&D dollar. Also drawing upon the SPRU data set, Geroski (1994, Chapter 2) highlights the clear negative correlation between firm size and R&D productivity. Using information on financial service innovations drawn from the Wall Street Journal over the period, 1990–2002, Lerner (2006) also observes that smaller firms account for a disproportionate share. Thus, the predominant pattern is that R&D productivity appears to decline with size. [...] Thus, the robust empirical patterns relating to R&D and innovation to firm size are that R&D increases monotonically—and typically proportionately—with firm size among R&D performers within industries, the number of innovations tends to increase less than proportionately than firm size, and the share of R&D effort dedicated to more incremental and process innovation tends to increase with firm size. These patterns, however, raise a number of questions. Why should there be such a close positive, monotonic—no less proportional—relationship between R&D and firm size to begin with? Also, how can this relationship be reconciled with the apparent decline in R&D productivity with firm size, no less with the apparent association between incremental and process innovation with firm size? he apparent decline in R&D productivity with firm size has been explained in a number of ways. For example, some have argued that smaller firms, especially new ventures, are more capable of innovating than larger firms (e.g., Acs and Audretsch, 1990, 1991b; Cooper, 1964), or, similarly, are more capable of spawning more significant or distinctive innovations than larger incumbents (e.g., Baumol, 2002; Henderson, 1993). Bound et al. (1984) and Griliches (1990) suggest two other explanations. One is selection bias; only the most successful small firm innovators tend to be included in the samples that have been examined, perhaps because greater firm size increases the likelihood of survival, and thus surviving smaller firms likely manifest some compensating advantage such as greater innovative capability. Griliches (1990) also suggests the possibility that measurement error may account for the seemingly greater R&D productivity of small firms due to the systematic underestimation of formal R&D for small firms (cf. Kleinknecht, 1987; Schmookler, 1959; Sirilli, 1987). These explanations for a decline in R&D productivity with size leave open, however, the question of why we should also observe a strong positive relationship between firm size and R&D. In Schumpeter’s discussion of the effects of market power on innovation, there are two distinct themes. First, Schumpeter recognized that firms require the expectation of some form of transient market power to have the incentive to invest in R&D. This is, of course, the principle underlying patent law; it associates the incentive to invent with the expectation of ex post (i.e., post-innovation) market power tied to the innovations originating from R&D. Second, Schumpeter argued that the possession of ex ante market power, linked to an ex ante oligopolistic (or monopolistic) market structure, also favored innovation. An oligopolistic market structure, for example, made rival behavior more stable and predictable, he claimed, and thereby reduced the uncertainty associated with excessive rivalry that tended to undermine the incentive to invent. Implicitly assuming that capital markets are imperfect, he also suggested that the profits derived from the possession of ex ante market power provided firms with the internal financial resources necessary to invest in innovative activity. Finally, he also appeared to argue that ex ante market power would tend to confer ex post market power [...] The majority of studies that examine the relationship between market concentration and R&D have found a positive relationship. First among many were Horowitz (1962), Hamberg (1964), Scherer (1967a), and Mansfield (1968). A few have found evidence that concentration has a negative effect on R&D (e.g., Bozeman and Link, 1983; Mukhopadhyay, 1985; Williamson, 1965). Rather than examine the relationship between market structure and R&D—an input, Geroski and Pomroy (1990) and Geroski (1990) consider the relationship between market structure and innovation, the output of innovative activity, which they measure with counts of commercially significant innovations drawn from the SPRU database (cf. Geroski, 1994, Chapter 2; Robson and Townsend, 1984). Geroski (1990) also departs from the prior literature by employing a number of measures of market structure, including market concentration, but also measures of entry, exit, import penetration, and the number of small firms. Geroski (1990) finds a positive relationship between competition and innovation, a qualitative reversal of the majority of prior findings that he attributes to his inclusion of a control for technological opportunity. [...] A finding that long ago captured the imagination of numerous theorists was that of Scherer (1967a), who found evidence of a nonlinear, “inverted-U” relationship between R&D intensity and concentra- tion. Using data from the Census of Population, Scherer found that R&D employment as a share of total employment increased with industry concentration up to a four-firm concentration ratio between 50% and 55%, and declined with concentration thereafter. This inverted-U result, in the context of a simple egression of R&D intensity against market concentration and a quadratic term, has been replicated by Scott (1984) and Levin et al. (1985) using the FTC Line of Business data. Using a 21-year panel, spanning 1973–1994, for 17 two-digit industries, Aghion et al. (2005) observe a similar “inverted-U” between industry-level market power, measured with an averaged Lerner index—an arguably better measure of the intensity of competition than a concentration ratio—and industry innovation, measured with the average number of citation-weighted patents. There have been two central challenges facing empirical studies on the relationship between competition and innovation, as suggested by our discussion of entry and innovation. First, it is likely that competition and innovation are simultaneously determined, either with causality running in both directions, or with both innovation and competition codetermined by other exogenous factors. Second, there is a question of the sensitivity of the relationship to industry-level factors, and what that sensitivity might imply about the nature and importance of the influence of competition on innovation. Phillips (1966) was among the first to propose that causality might run from innovation to market structure, rather than the reverse. Although Schumpeter envisioned that the market power accruing from successful innovation would be transitory, eroding as competitors entered the field, Phillips argued that, to the extent that “success breeds success,” concentrated industrial structure would tend to emerge as a consequence of past innovation. Phillips’ (1971) monograph on the manufacture of civilian aircraft illustrates how market structure can evolve as a consequence of innovation, as well as how it can affect the conditions for subsequent innovation. [...]\n\nChapter 5: The Economics of Science (Stephan)\n\nAs economists, we owe a substantial debt to Robert Merton for establishing the importance of priority in scientific discovery. In a series of articles and essays begun in the late 1950s, Merton (1957, 1961, 1968, 1969) argues convincingly that the goal of scientists is to establish priority of discovery by being first to communicate an advance in knowledge and that the rewards to priority are the recognition awarded by the scientific community for being first. Merton further argues that the interest in priority and the intellectual property rights awarded to the scientist who is first are not a new phenomenon but have been an overriding characteristic of science for at least three centuries Science is sometimes described as a “winner-take-all” contest,” meaning that there are no rewards for being second or third. One characteristic of science that contributes to such a reward structure is the difficulty that occurs in monitoring scientific effort (Dasgupta, 1989; Dasgupta and David, 1987). This class of problem is not unique to science. Lazear and Rosen (1981) have investigated incentive-compatible compensation schemes where monitoring is costly. Another factor that contributes to such a reward structure is the low social value of the contributions made by the runner-up. “There is no value added when the same discovery is made a second, third, or fourth time.” (Dasgupta and Maskin, 1987, p. 583). But it is somewhat extreme to view science as a winner-take-all contest. Even those who describe scientific contests in such ways note that it is a somewhat inaccurate description, given that replication and verification have social value and are common in science. It is also inaccurate to the extent that it suggests that only a handful of contests exist. True, some contests are world class, such as identification of the Higgs particle or the development of high-temperature superconductors. But there are many other contests that have multiple components, and the number of such contests appears to be on the increase. By way of example, while for many years it was thought that there would be “one” cure for cancer, it is now realized that cancer takes multiple forms and that multiple approaches are needed to find a cure. There will not be but one winner; there will be multiple winners. A more realistic metaphor is to see science as following a tournament arrangement, much like tournaments in golf or tennis, where the losers, too, get some rewards. This keeps individuals in the game, raises their skills, and enhances their chances of winning a future tournament. A similar type of competition exists in science. Dr X is passed over for the Lasker Prize, but her work is sufficiently distinguished that she is invited to give an important lecture, consistently receives support for her research and is awarded an honorary degree from her undergraduate institution. Financial remuneration is another component of the reward structure of science. While scientists place great importance on priority and are highly motivated by an interest in puzzle-solving, money clearly plays a role in the reward structure. Rosovsky (1990) recounts how, upon becoming dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard, he asked one of Harvard’s most eminent scientists the source of his scientific inspiration. The reply (which “came without the slightest hesitation”) was “money and flattery.” (p. 242). The other reward often attributed to science is the satisfaction derived from solving the puzzle. Hagstrom (1965, p. 16), an early sociologist of science, noted this when he said “Research is in many ways a kind of game, a puzzle-solving operation in which the solution of the puzzle is its own reward.” The philosopher of science Hull (1988, p. 305) describes scientists as being innately curious and suggests that science is “play behavior carried to adulthood.” Feynman (1999), explaining why he did not have anything to do with the Nobel Prize (which he won in 1965), said: “I don’t see that it makes any point that someone in the Swedish Academy decides that this work is noble enough to receive a prize— I’ve already got the prize. The prize is the pleasure of finding the thing out, the kick in the discovery . . .” This suggests that time spent in discovery is an argument in the utility function of scientists. Pollak and Wachter (1975) demonstrate that maximization problems of this type are generally intractable, because implicit prices depend upon the preferences of the producer. While this provides a rationale for excluding the process of discovery from models of scientific behavior, the failure of economists to acknowledge the puzzle as a motivating force makes economic models of scientific behavior lack credibility. Recent work by Sauermann and Cohen (2007) seeks to address this in part for scientists and engineers working in industry. Although it is popular to characterize scientists as having instant insight, studies suggest that science takes time. Investigators often portray productive scientists—and eminent scientists especially—as strongly motivated, with the “‘stamina’ or the capacity to work hard and persist in the pursuit of long-range goals.” (Fox, 1983). 14 Several dimensions of cognitive resources are associated with discovery. One aspect is ability. It is generally believed that a high level of intelligence is required to do science, and several studies have documented that, as a group, scientists have above average IQs. 15 There is also a general consensus that certain people are particularly good at doing science and that a handful are superb. 16 Another dimension of cognitive inputs is the knowledge base the scientist(s) working on a project possesses. This knowledge is used not only to solve a problem but to choose the problem and the sequence in which the problem is addressed. The importance knowledge plays in discovery leads to several observations. First, it intensifies the race, because the public nature of knowledge means that multiple investigators have access to the knowledge needed to solve a problem. Second, knowledge can either be embodied in the scientist(s) working on the research or disembodied, but available in the literature (or from others). Different types of research rely more heavily on one than the other. The nuclear physicist Leo Szilard, who left physics to work in biology, once told the biologist Sydney Brenner that he could never have a comfortable bath after he left physics. “When he was a physicist he could lie in the bath and think for hours, but in biology he was always having to get up to look up another fact” (Wolpert and Richards, 1988, p. 107). Fourth, there is anecdotal evidence that “too much” knowledge can be a bad thing in discovery in the sense that it “encumbers” the researcher. There is the suggestion, for example, that exceptional research may at times be done by the young because the young “know” less than their elders and hence are less encumbered in their choice of problems and the way they approach a question. 17 Finally, the cognitive resources brought to bear on a problem can be enhanced by assembling a research team or, at a minimum, engaging in a collaborative arrangement with investigators in other labs and countries. Research is rarely done in isolation, especially research of an experimental rather than theoretical bent (Fox, 1991). Scientists work in labs. How these labs are staffed varies across countries. For example, in Europe research labs are often staffed by permanent staff scientists, although increas- ingly these positions are held by temporary employees (Stephan, 2008). In the United States, while positions such as staff scientists and research associates exist, the majority of scientists working in the lab are doctoral students and postdocs. Stephan et al.’s study (2007b) of 415 labs affiliated with a nanotechnology center finds that the average lab has 12 technical staff, excluding the principal investigator (PI). Fifty percent of these are graduate students; 16% are postdocs, and 10% are under- grads. 18 Such patterns mean that labs in the United States are disproportionately staffed by young, temporary workers. The reliance on such a system, with its underlying pyramid scheme, at a time when there has been minimal expansion in faculty positions, has resulted in an increasing supply of scientists trained in the United States (as well as those trained abroad, who come to the United States to take a postdoctoral position) who are less and less likely to find permanent PI positions in the university. The importance of equipment is one reason to stress the nonlinearity of scientific discovery. Scientific research can lead to technological advance, but technology very much affects advances in science. The history of science is the history of how important resources and equipment are to discovery—a theme in the research of Rosenberg and Mokyr, among others. Equipment for research is costly. 27 At the extreme are costs associated with building and running an accelerator. The 27-km-long LHC which is scheduled to come online early in 2008 at CERN will cost $8 billion; the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States cost $1.41 billion (Science, vol. 312, 5 May 2006; p. 675). A microscope used for nanotechnology research can cost $750,000 (http://www.unm.edu/market/cgi-bin/archives/000132.html). A sequencer, such as Applied Biosystems’ 3730 model costs approximately $300,000. Next-generation sequencers cost between $400,000 and $500,000. Mice are not free. An inbred off-the-shelf mouse costs between $17 and $60; mutant strains begin around $40 and can go to $500 plus. Prices are for mice supplied from live breeding colonies. Many strains, however, are only available from cyropreserved material. Such mice cost considerably more: in 2009 the cost to recover any strain from cryopreservation (either from cryopreserved sperm or embryos) was $1900. For this, investigators receive at least two breeding pairs of animals in order to establish their own breeding colony. 28 Custom made mice can cost much more. Johns Hopkins University, for example, estimates that it costs $3500 to engineer a mouse to order. With the large number of mice in use (over 13,000 are already published), the cost of mouse upkeep becomes a significant factor in doing research. US universities, for example, charged from $0.05 to $0.10 per day per mouse (mouse per diem) in 2000 (Malakoff, 2000). This can rapidly add up. Irving Weissman of Stanford University reports that before Stanford changed its cage rates he was paying between $800,000 and $1 million a year to keep the 10,000 to 15,000 mice in his lab. 29 Costs for keeping immune deficient mice are far greater (on the order of $0.65 per day), given their susceptibility to disease. 30 The importance of equipment and research materials in scientific research means that exchange, which has a long tradition in science (Hagstrom, 1965), plays a considerable role in fostering research and in creating incentives for scientists to behave in certain ways. For example, scientists routinely share information and access to research materials and expertise in exchange for citations and coauthorship. 31 But, as research materials have become increasingly important, exchange has arguably taken on more importance. Walsh et al. (2005, 2007) examine the practice of sharing materials (such as cell lines, reagents, and antigens) among academic biomedical researchers and find that 75% of the academic respondents in their sample made at least one request for material in a 2-year period, with an average of 7 requests for materials to other academics and two requests for materials from an industrial lab (Walsh et al., 2005). Serendipity also plays a role in scientific discovery; it is not that uncommon for researchers to find different, sometimes greater, riches than the ones they are seeking. Although serendipity is sometimes referred to as the “happy accident,” this is a bit of a misnomer. True, Pasteur “discovered” bacteria while trying to solve problems that were confronting the French wine industry. But his discovery, although unexpected, was hardly “an accident.” Distinguishing between the unexpected and the “accidental” is especially difficult when research involves exploration of the unknown. The analogy to discovery makes the point: Columbus did not find what he was looking for—but the discovery of the new world was hardly an accident. Einstein once said that “a person who has not made his great contribution to science before the age of thirty will never do so.” (Brodetsky, 1942, p. 299). There is a great deal of anecdotal evidence (Stephan and Levin, 1992) that he was right, that science is the domain of the young. However, investigating the veracity of the statement statistically is fraught with problems: measurement issues abound, as do the confounding of aging effects with cohort effects, as well as the availability of appropriate databases. We examine these issues, prefacing them with a discussion of theoretical reasons that one might expect age to be related to productivity. The presence of a gender differential in publishing outcomes is well established. Fox (2005), for example, finds that women published or had accepted for publication 8.9 papers in the 3-year period beginning in the early 1990s, compared to 11.4 for men. The difference owes to disparities at both extremes of the productivity distribution. Women are almost twice as likely as men to publish zero or one paper during the period (18.8% compared to 10.5%); men are almost twice as likely as women to publish 20 or more papers during the period (15.8% for men compared to 8.4% for women). 53 Gender differentials have also declined over time. Xie and Shauman (1998) find the female-to-male ratio to have been about 0.60 in the late 1960s, and to have increased to 0.82 by 1993. The question as to why research output is related to gender has long interested those studying scientific productivity. In economic terms, the question is often examined in terms of supply versus demand characteristics. Stated in these terms, the question is whether women publish less than men because of specific attributes, such as family characteristics, amount of time spent doing research, etc., or whether women publish less than men because they have fewer opportunities to be productive, due to hiring and funding decisions as well as possible network outcomes. This dichotomy is misleading, of course, to the degree that interactions exist between the two. Differential placement opportunities, for example, may lead women to allocate their time to activities that are rewarded (such as teaching) but diminish publishing activity. One of the most in-depth studies to be done on the subject in recent years is that by the sociologists (Xie and Shauman, 1998, 2003, p. 23). After carefully analyzing four datasets that span a 24-year period, they conclude that “women scientists publish fewer papers than men because women are less likely than men to have personal characteristics, structural positions, and facilitating resources that are conducive to publication.” In other words, both demand and supply play a role. 37). 58 From an economist’s point of view, an exceedingly appealing attribute of a reward system that is rooted in priority is that it offers nonmarket-based incentives for the production of the public good “knowledge.” (Stephan, 2004). Merton noted the functionality of the reward system in the inaugural lecture of the George Sarton Leerstoel that he delivered October 28, 1986 at the University of Ghent. In the lecture, published 2 years later in Isis, Merton spoke of the public nature of science, writing that “. . .a fund of knowledge is not diminished through exceedingly intensive use by members of the scientific collectivity—indeed, it is presumably augmented. . .” (Merton, 1988, p. 620). Merton not only recognized this but stood the public–private distinction on its head, proposing that the reward structure in science of priority functioned to make a public good private. “I propose the seeming paradox that in science, private property is established by having its substance freely given to others who might want to make use of it.” He continues (1988, p. 620) by saying that “only when scientists have published their work and made it generally accessible, preferably in the public print of articles, monographs, and books that enter the archives, does it become legitimately established as more or less securely theirs” or, as he says elsewhere, “one’s private property is established by giving its substance away” (1988, p. 620). Dasgupta and David (1987, p. 531) express the private–public paradox exceedingly well: “Priority creates a privately owned asset—a form of intellectual property—from the very act of relinquishing exclusive possession of the new knowledge.” Arrow (1987, p. 687), commenting on their work, articulates the cleverness of such a system: The recognition that priority is a form of property rights leads to the question of whether there are “too many” contestants in certain scientific contests. Would the social good be served by having fewer? In a speech delivered at the conference commemorating the 400th anniversary of the birth of Francis Bacon, Merton detailed the prevalence of what he called “multiples” in scientific discovery. And Merton was not the first to note their presence. In what Merton calls a “play within a play,” he gives 20 “lists” of multiples that were compiled between 1828 and 1922. Moreover, Merton is quick to point out that the absence of a multiple does not mean that a multiple was not in the making at the time the discovery was made public. This is a classic case of censored data where scooped scientists abandon their research after a winner is recognized. Indeed, Merton argues that “far from being odd or curious or remarkable, the pattern of independent multiple discoveries in science is in principle the dominant pattern rather than a subsidiary one.” (Merton, 1961, p. 356). 68 The presence of multiple discoveries is due in part to the free access scientists have to knowledge and in part to the fact that uncertainty associated with who will make a discovery leads scientists to choose research portfolios that are correlated (Dasgupta and Maskin, 1987). 69 The knowledge that multiples exist keeps scientists from shirking and moves the enterprise of science at a rapid pace. Such observa- tions invite the question of whether science moves at too rapid a pace and whether certain contests attract too many entrants. Dasgupta and David (1987, p. 540) argue that the priority system can create excesses, just as the patent system does, provided the “reward to the discoverer . . . is tempting enough.” They make no effort to define the boundary of temptation, but one wonders if the general knowledge that certain contests deserve the Nobel Prize does not attract an excessive number of scientists. In the mid-1950s, approximately one-third of basic research performed in the United States was done by industry; in 2004, the last year for which data are available, the proportion had declined to approximately 16% (National Science Board, 2006, Table 4-8, vol. 2). Other factors contributing to the decline, in addition to the closure or refocusing of certain large industrial labs, include an increased propensity to “outsource” research to the university sector, as well as possible changes in definition and classification. At the same time that industry’s share of basic research declined, their share of applied research rose from 56.3% to 61.8% (National Science Board, 2006, Table 4-12, vol. 2); the combined share of basic and applied research went from 50.1% to 40.3%. 80 Our knowledge of scientists working in industry comes largely from a number of excellent case studies. These include Gambardella’s (1995) study of the pharmaceutical industry, Hounshell and Smith’s (1988) study of Du Pont, Willard Mueller’s discussion of Du Pont (1962); Nelson’s (1962) study of the development of the transistor, and Sobel’s (1986) study of RCA. For a discussion of specific industries, see Mowery and Rosenberg (1998). Science, perhaps more than any other enterprise, is international in scope. We see this in terms of location of training, location of work and, as we have noted earlier, in coauthorship patterns. In terms of training, a very large percent of degrees, especially in Europe and the United States, are awarded to foreign students. While the percent has fluctuated over time in response to such things as changes in available funding and visa policies, overall the percent of PhDs awarded to international students in the United States has grown considerably during the past 30 years. By 2006, 36.0% of PhDs awarded in science and 58.6% of those awarded in engineering went to candidates on a temporary visa while 6.0% of science PhDs and 4.5% of engineering PhDs were awarded to noncitizens on permanent visas (National Science Foundation, 2006, Table 3). 84 A somewhat similar situation exists in Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, where in 2003 over 50% of engineering PhDs and approximately 45% of math and computer science degrees were awarded to foreign students (National Science Board, 2004, Figure 2-40).\n\nChapter 6: University Research and Public-Private Interaction (Foray and Lissoni)\n\nUniversities also contribute directly to innovation, by providing industry and services with technical solutions or devices, or by getting involved in applied research activities. Such a role is in accordance with a view of the university as a “permeable institution” (Le ́cuyer, 1998), which allocates efforts and attention to problem-solving activities that have immediate relevance for business firms (most often the national or local ones). Such a view is not at all new, as it dates back at least to the nineteenth century, sometimes in coexistence, sometimes in competition, with the emphasis on basic research and teaching (Rothblatt and Wittrock, 1993). More recently, however, governments and large sections of the public opinion have placed more emphasis on demands that universities fulfil this type of task by commercia- lizing their own academic inventions. This requires them to get involved into the creation and management of intellectual property rights (IPRs), and even into entrepreneurial activities such as the foundation of new firms (Martin, 2003; Slaughter and Leslie, 1997; Yusuf and Nabeshima, 2007). A major witness of this change is the wave of legislation aimed at encouraging universities to take patents and license them under profitable conditions, started in the United States with the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 and continued elsewhere with many imitations of this Act and, in several European countries, with the abolition of the “professor’s privilege” typical of the German academic model. This change of perspective has gone hand in hand with the increasing attention paid by industry to universities’ research, as part of a general strategy to move away from a “vertical” model of R&D to a “network strategy” of innovation, based upon the exploitation of external knowledge resources. 4 Since the 1980s, industrial funding of academic science in OECD countries has grown considerably both in real terms and as a percentage of GDP. Public funding has also grown in real terms, but it has not kept up with the growth both of GDP and of industrial funding, so that in 2003 the share of government-funded academic research was down to 72%, from over 80% in 1981. In the meantime, the share of industrial funding had doubled, from 3% to 6%; and universities’ self-financing share has gone up from 13% to 16%, thanks largely to the expansion of new entrepreneurial activities both in the field of education and in technology commercialization (Vincent-Lancrin, 2006). At the present time, the most research-oriented of modern universities look quite like the “multiver- sity” envisaged by Clark Kerr, the prescient president of the University of California of the 1960s: a “knowledge factory . . . to which policy wonks turn for expertise, industrialists turn for research, government agencies turn for funding proposals, and donors turn for leveraging their philanthropy into the greatest impact” (Wagner, 2007); and, one may wish to add, university administrators turn for self-financing. 5 Starting with the 1990s, most econometric attempts to measure the extent of knowledge spillovers from academic research have been coupled with exercises aimed at measuring the geographical scope of those spillovers. 21 Jaffe (1989) is generally acknowledged as the pioneering paper in this field. Aiming to assess the Real effects of academic research, Jaffe estimated a “modified knowledge production function” in which the dependent variable is given by the number of private corporate patents produced in a given technology by each state of the United States, and the explanatory variables include, among others, the research expenditures of universities and a measure of within-state geographic coincidence of corporate R&D labs and university research. Jaffe’s results show that the number of corporate patents is positively affected by the R&D performed by local universities, after controlling for both private R&D inputs and the state size, as measured by population. Many authors have replicated Jaffe’s exercise. Using innovation counts from the Small Business Innovation Data Base (SBDIB), Audretsch and Feldman (1996) and Feldman and Audretsch (1999) show that, even after controlling for the geographic concentration of production, innovative activities present a greater propensity to cluster spatially in those industries in which industry R&D, university research and skilled labor are important inputs. Acs et al. (1994) also find that the elasticity of innovation output with respect to university R&D is greater for small firms than for large ones. This is interpreted as evidence that small firms, while lacking internal knowledge inputs, have a comparative advantage at exploiting spillovers from university laboratories. Along similar lines, Anselin et al. (1997) refine Jaffe’s original methodology to take into account cross-border effects, and show that university research has a positive impact on regional rates of innovation. The literature on science parks is of limited help when it comes to getting a better understanding of university–industry relationship. By and large, in fact, it is a chronicle of repeated failures, and of a sequence of evaluation attempts aimed at elusive targets. As pointed out by Link and Scott (2003, 2007), there is no generally accepted definition of science park, a term which is prevalent in Europe but not as popular in the United States (where “research park” or “university research park” are more common) and in Asia (where “technology park” is more diffused). In general, science parks (and their synonyms) are intended to be real estate developments aimed at hosting hi-tech or science-based firms, which provide for some technology transfer activities and involve a local university, some level of govern- ment, and possibly the private sector. Link and Scott (2003) trace their proliferation in the United States back to the 1980s, a decade when also the UK local governments set up many of them, soon to be followed by many other European and Asian countries (Bakouros et al., 2002; Lee and Yang, 2001; Phillimore, 1999; Vedovello, 1997). Founders of new science parks, inevitably invoked the Stanford Science Park as the model to imitate, but proved to have little knowledge of the unique circumstances that surrounded its creation and made its replication very hard to achieve. 36 Early criticism of the UK experience, especially of the idea that science parks could be useful tools both to revitalize deindus- trialized areas and support local universities, did not deter subsequent imitation (MacDonald, 1987; Massey et al., 1992).\n\nChapter 7: Property Rights and Invention (R0ckett)\n\nArticle 1, Section 8 of the US Constitution is quite explicit that the objective of the intellectual property rights system is the progress of “Science and the Useful Arts.” 36 If one were to take this at its word, one would not necessarily want to use social welfare—or even economic growth—as the standard of optimality in a model of the intellectual property rights system. Instead, one might wish to use the rate of innovation or, less directly, the rate of research and development spending: the more the better. The interpretation one takes is important to the conclusion one reaches about the optimality of any intellectual property protection system. For example, Horowitz and Lai (1996) compare the optimal design of patents when the objective is to maximize the rate of innovation to the optimal design when the objective is to maximize discounted consumers’ surplus. A system that aims to maximize con- sumers’ surplus places more value on frequent innovation than a system that maximizes the rate of innovation since intermediate steps generate surplus gains as each quality step enters consumption. Despite the ambiguity in how one should interpret the goal of establishing a system of intellectual property rights in the first place, however, the bulk of the economics literature has taken social welfare to be the appropriate objective that is maximized by policymakers. While some argue that the patent system is not necessary, others argue that even if it is necessary it is not very effective. Survey evidence of Cohen et al. (2000) has indicated that managers do not view patents as very effective at generating direct rewards to innovation. While certain sectors, such as biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, appear to get great benefit from patents, various first mover advantages (such as learning by doing) are credited with generating greater reward to innovation than intellectual property rights. If firms rely on other “frictions” such as barriers to entry to generate profits from invention, patents may at best be redundant. On the other hand, Farrell (1995) argues that the “honeymoon” period of patent protection may allow these other potentially long lasting first mover advantages to get going. Hence, patents may contribute more to profits than is acknowledged in the survey results. Still, if frictions and not patents are generating the rewards, then perhaps we should consider weakening or eliminating patents, since the patent system is costly to maintain and may generate few benefits.\n\nChapter 8: Stylized Facts in the Geography of Innovation (Feldman and Kogler)\n\nAn extensive literature addresses the topic of geography of innovation and describes the importance of proximity and location to innovative activity. This has been termed the “new economic geography,” an area of research that is less than 20 years old (Clark et al., 2000). This field is now developed sufficiently so that the discussion can be organized around certain stylized and commonly accepted facts: Innovation is spatially concentrated. Geography provides a platform to organize economic activity. All places are not equal: urbanization, localization, and diversity. Knowledge spillovers are geographically localized. Knowledge spillovers are nuanced, subtle, pervasive, and not easily amenable to measurement. Local universities are necessary but not sufficient for innovation. Innovation benefits from local buzz and global pipelines. Places are defined over time by an evolutionary process.\n\nChapter 9: Open User Innovation (von Hippel)\n\nSkipped. Here is the conclusion\n\nI summarize this overview chapter by again saying that users’ ability to innovate is improving radically and rapidly as a result of the steadily improving quality of computer software and hardware, improved access to easy-to-use tools and components for innovation, and access to a steadily richer innovation commons. Today, user firms and even individual hobbyists have access to sophisticated programming tools for software and sophisticated CAD design tools for hardware and electronics. These information- based tools can be run on a personal computer, and they are rapidly coming down in price. As a consequence, innovation by users will continue to grow even if the degree of heterogeneity of need and willingness to invest in obtaining a precisely right product remains constant (Baldwin and von Hippel, 2009). Equivalents of the innovation resources described above have long been available within corporations to a few. Senior designers at firms have long been supplied with engineers and designers under their direct control and with the resources needed to quickly construct and test prototype designs. The same is true in other fields, including automotive design and clothing design: just think of the staffs of engineers and model makers supplied so that top auto designers can quickly realize and test their designs. But if, as we have seen, the information needed to innovate in important ways is widely distributed, the traditional pattern of concentrating innovation-support resources on a few individuals is hugely inefficient. High-cost resources for innovation support cannot efficiently be allocated to “the right people with the right information:” it is very difficult to know who these people may be before they develop an innovation that turns out to have general value. When the cost of high-quality resources for design and prototyping becomes very low (the trend we have described), these resources can be diffused very widely, and the allocation problem diminishes in significance. The net result is a pattern in which development of product and service innovations is increasingly shifting to users—a pattern that will involve significant changes for both users and producers.\n\nChapter 10: Learning by doing (Thompson)\n\nThis chapter has reviewed the theoretical and empirical literature on LBD. Many of the distinctive theoretical implications of LBD have been derived under the assumption that the cost–quantity relation- ships observed in numerous empirical studies are largely the result of passive learning, and some further require that passive learning is unbounded. The empirical literature raises doubts about both assump- tions. When observed cost–quantity relationships indicate sustained productivity growth, factors other than passive learning are generally at work. When passive learning is the dominant factor, productivity growth is invariably bounded. Thus, empirically relevant theories incorporating LBD are hybrid models in which passive learning coexists with other sources of growth. But in such models, many of the distinctive implications of passive learning become unimportant. Moreover, passive learning is often an inessential component of long-run growth; to the contrary, too much learning can lead to stagnation.\n\nChapter 11: Innovative Conduct in Computing and Internet Markets (Greenstein)\n\nSimilarly, the household experience with computing has also undergone significant change: It began from virtually nothing in the 1970s. Later, a 1995 survey found less than 20% of households had a personal computer (PC) (NTIA, 1995). In sharp contrast, an October 2003 survey found that 62% of respondents had a computer at home and an even larger percentage used a computer at work (Mankiw et al., 2005). These events motivate a wide variety of microeconomic questions about innovative conduct in US commercial computing. In the first section of this review, I discuss these questions in light of six propositions commonly found in the themes of many studies: While technical frontiers in computing may stretch due to events reasonably described as “tech- nology push,” a more substantial amount of valuable innovation arises endogenously in response to market incentives and market-oriented events; The diffusion and development of computing resembles diffusion and development of a general- purpose technology (GPT), and as with such a technology, substantial costs arise from creating value by customizing the technology to the unique needs of users; The presence of computing platforms shapes incentives to innovate, and the unification or divi- sion of technical leadership shapes distribution of value within and between platforms; Leading incumbent firms and new entrants face differential incentives to innovate when innovation reinforces or alters market structure; Market-based learning activity plays an essential role in innovative conduct, especially in enabling exploration of multiple approaches for translating the frontier into innovative and valu- able goods and services; The localization of economics activity leads to a concentration of some types of innovative con- duct in a small set of locations. The constant improvement in performance supports the view that many changes in computing arise from “technology push.” That is, the invention pushed out the technical or scientific frontier, leading other commercial actors to search for valuable uses. There is a grain of truth to this view, but it also requires proper qualification. The supporting evidence is well known. Numerous prototypical technologies in computing found their way into products and services long after their invention. These inventions arose in university or commercial laboratories, sometimes as a by-product of basic scientific research goals and sometimes with no direct vision about their application to a valuable commercial activity. Then, these inventions spread through academic papers, by licensing of patents, or the movement of computer scientists and engineers into companies. 7 Of these inventions, many arose from prototypes built with large subsidies from government funding. For example, the original investment by DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Agency) in the funda- mental science of packet switching did not lead to any immediate practical commercial products. Years of sustained funding, however, led to a set of events that broadly subsidized the invention and operation of the basic building blocks of the Internet, such as the experiments that led to the definition of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) stack and its practical implementation in a working communications and computing network. This funding occurred long before the commercial Internet was operational. What became the Internet began in the late 1960s as a research project of the Advanced Research Projects Administration of the United States Department of Defense, the ARPANET. From these origins sprang the building blocks of a new technology for a communications network, one based on sending data where some amount of delay was tolerated. By the mid-1980s, the entire Internet used TCP/IP packet-switching technology to connect most universities and defense contractors. Management for large parts of the Internet was transferred to the NSF in the mid-1980s. Through NSFNET, the NSF was able to provide connections to its supercomputer centers and a high-speed backbone. Since use of NSFNET was limited to academic and research locations, carriers who carried commercial traffic, such as UUNET, PSINET, and Sprint developed their own private backbones for corporations looking to connect their systems with TCP/IP (Kahn, 1995). By the early 1990s, the NSF had developed a plan to transfer ownership of the Internet out of government hands and into the private sector. The plan for privatization was motivated by several factors. For example, it was forecast (correctly) that a privatized Internet would be more efficient than a government operated one, leading to lower costs for all users. There was also a concern that the NSF could not fund indefinitely the operations of the network, and it was thought that privatization would put the network on more stable financial footing. During the transition another issue arose: several of the private providers of data services were chafing under the NSF’s “acceptable use” policy forbidding them to use government-owned assets for commercial purposes. Complete privatization also would remove this issue. The lack of government involvement could also be seen in other aspects of the Internet in the United States. For example, although the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had mandated a standard for digital television (as it had for color television), it refrained from mandating most Internet equipment design decisions. Just as the FCC had not mandated Ethernet design standards, so it let the spectrum become available for experiments by multiple groups who competed for wireless Ethernet standards, which eventually became Wi-Fi. Similarly, the FCC did not mandate a standard for modems other than to impose requirements that limited interference. It also did not mandate interconnection regulatory regime for Internet carriers in the 1990s, explicitly letting the firms innovate in the structure of their business dealings with one another, and evolve those dealings as they saw fit.\n\nChapter 12: Pharmaceutical Innovation\n\nThe discovery and development of new pharmaceutical substances are among the most interesting of innovation processes. Unusually large privately financed expenditures on research and development (R&D) outlays are required to achieve a successful new product, and the pharmaceutical industry’s R&D/sales ratios are extraordinarily high. The links to academic science and basic research performed in government laboratories are rich. The expectation of patent protection plays a more important role than in most other high-technology industries. New products must meet not only the test of market acceptance, but also survive rigorous scrutiny from government regulatory agencies. And the medical services market into which pharmaceuticals sell is itself unusually complex, with a significant fraction of consumers’ purchases, at least in the wealthier nations, covered by insurance and hence subject to diverse moral hazard and adverse selection imperfections. Despite these problems, there is compelling evidence that the introduction of many new pharmaceutical products has yielded substantial net benefits in extending human lives and reducing the burden of disease (Lichtenberg, 2001, 2004, 2007; Long et al., 2006; Murphy and Topel, 2006). Among these various characteristics, we focus preliminarily on one: the high ratio of pharmaceutical companies’ R&D spending in relation to their sales. The clearest indicator of this trait comes from data systematically collected over the years by the US industry trade association, previously called the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PMA) and more recently the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA). The evolution of pharmaceutical discovery away from unguided or at best intuitive random screening toward rational drug design and biological methods has led to increasingly rich linkages between the work of pharmaceutical companies on the one hand and academic science carried out in universities and governmentally supported research institutes on the other, both in the nations where the companies operate and across national boundaries. This has always been the case to some extent. The early work on sulfa drugs was conducted in German industrial laboratories by scientists trained at prominent German universities, which were at the time world leaders in chemical research and teaching. Penicillin moved quickly from the laboratories of Oxford University to numerous companies producing in quantity for the war effort. The first oral contraceptive was introduced by the G.D. Searle Company in 1960, a decade before the earliest date at which the trend toward rational drug design was said to begin. But a study by the IIT Research Institute (1968, pp. 58–72) for the US NSF revealed an intricate “tree” of scientific discoveries extending back to 1849 that laid a foundation for the Searle contraceptive and later improvements. Cockburn and Henderson (2000) studied the histories of the 21 new drugs introduced between 1965 and 1992 with the highest over-all therapeutic impact, as judged by industry experts. Among the 21, only five, or 24%, were developed with essentially no input from public sector research. 14 They contrast their results with an earlier analysis by Maxwell and Eckhardt (1990) concluding that 38% of an older sample of drugs was developed without public support. Academic science is transformed into pharmaceutical innovations through richly interconnected networks. 16 Open science, to be sure, is available to pharmaceutical companies through journal articles and presentations at professional meetings. But in addition, there are tighter links. Pharmaceutical companies provide financial support for academic researchers, and their staffs sometimes perform joint research with academic researchers and coauthor articles with them. They also enter into cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs) with government laboratories such as the US National Institutes of Health, permitting joint research, joint publication, and (under the Stevenson- Wydler Act of 1980, extended through a 1986 amendment), assignment of resulting patents to the companies. In recent years, many pharma companies have opened new laboratories in the vicinity of top academic research institutions in order to facilitate cooperation. Quick absorption of the newest scientific discoveries is facilitated when traditional pharmaceutical companies support their own active programs of basic research. In 1993, for example, drug companies reported that 13.6% of their total company-financed R&D budgets was devoted to basic research, as defined by the NSF—18% of the basic research spending of all industries covered by the NSF survey for that year. For the average research-performing company across all industries except pharmaceuticals, basic research was 6.3% of total company-financed R&D spending. 17 Even closer links between academia and industry are seen in the emergence of hundreds of small new biotech firms, which tend to locate near academic centers, have academic scientists as their founding entrepreneurs, and count distinguished academic researchers as members of their boards of directors and/or scientific advisory councils. Traditional “Big Pharma” companies in turn license molecules discovered in biotech startups for later-stage commercial development or, with increasing frequency, acquire the biotech companies outright, securing full ownership rights in their development “pipeline” molecules and adding staff associated with them to their own R&D staffs (Kettler, 2000). In this way, they augment their inventories of interesting drug development candidates, among other things filling voids created when more traditional drug discovery approaches have yielded disappointing results. An indication of the extent to which firms introducing new drugs to the US market depended upon others for early-stage discoveries is provided through a study undertaken by the author. For the five years 2001–2005, the Food and Drug Administration’s Web site listing new medical entities approved for marketing during those years was searched. From information provided in the approval lists, the patents claimed by the drug developers as impediments to generic competition could be traced by searching the FDA’s so-called “Orange Book.” On the 85 new medical entities for which patent information was disclosed, 18 251 applicable patents were found, or an average of 2.95 patents per molecule. Altogether, 47% of the patents were assigned at the time of their issue to companies with names (abstracting from obvious name changes due to large-company mergers) different from the company authorized by the FDA to begin commercial marketing of the sample drugs. 19 Patents issued in the earlier stages of development, that is, prior to January 2000, were more likely (54%) to be assigned originally to firms other than FDA approval recipients than patents issued in later years (38.4%). The difference is statistically significant. Evidently, the companies carrying out final-stage development and testing relied disproportionately upon outsiders for early-stage discovery. Among the 251 patents, 10.4% went to essentially academic institutions, that is, universities, hospitals, and independent research institutes. Seven percent went to universities, although a handful of the university assignments were joint with other institutions, including US government laboratories. Seven of the 251 patents had multiple organizational assignees and 10 had only individual inventors as assignees. Many of the nonacademic patent assignees were biotech companies, although an exact breakdown was not possible because information on companies that have not yet “gone public” is scarce. It cannot be ruled out that at least some of the assignees with names different from that of the company receiving FDA approval had common stock partially or wholly controlled by larger corporate parents, notably, the companies receiving FDA approvals. Since 1938, when the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 was amended after approximately one hundred persons were killed by sulfanilamide adulterated with poisonous diethylene glycol (used for antifreeze), the interstate sale of new drugs was prohibited in the United States unless the would-be drug provider obtained a safety certification (an NDA) from the Food and Drug Administration. A recurrent theme in this essay has been the presence of uncertainty. As the research and testing process progresses, uncertainties are gradually mitigated. Several sources put the number of alternative molecules subjected to early screening at between 4000 and 10,000 in order to have a single approved drug at the end of the process. 31 According to PhRMA (2006, p. 4), the US industry association, a single approved drug emerges on average from five compounds entering clinical testing, 250 molecules subjected to animal and other laboratory tests, and 5000–10,000 molecules initially screened. As the number of drug candidates is winnowed, the costs of continued testing and hence the stakes in the game escalate. To be sure, pharmaceutical companies have some bases for predicting before marketing begins whether their new drug will enter a market with blockbuster potential or occupy a niche in which quasi-rents will at best be modest. Among other things, first movers typically enjoy larger market shares than latecomers. The expectation of patent protection on new products plays a particularly important role in pharmaceu- tical R&D decision making. Levin et al. (1987) surveyed 650 corporate R&D managers, asking them inter alia to evaluate on a scale of 1 (not at all effective) to 7 (very effective) the effectiveness of patents as a means of protecting the competitive advantages from new products. From 17 pharmaceutical industry respondents, the average score was 6.53, compared to a response-weighted average of 4.33 for all 130 surveyed lines of business. Among the industries with more than one respondent, pharmaceu- ticals ranked second in its patent protection effectiveness score. This result is consistent with the findings of Mansfield (1986), who asked the top R&D executives of 100 US corporations what fraction of the inventions they commercialized between 1981 and 1983 would not have been developed in the absence of patent protection. For pharmaceuticals, the average was 60%; for all industries, 14%. The importance of patents to pharmaceutical R&D decision makers stems not only from the large average investments in a typical new product and the many uncertainties lining the path to a new product approval. The differentiating factor is seen among other things through a comparison with another industry—aircraft—that taps a range of highly sophisticated technologies and spends billions of dollars developing the typical new product. For aircraft (both civilian and military), the average “effectiveness of product patents” score in the Levin et al. survey was 3.79—in the lowest third among 130 industry categories. The key difference lies in the relative ease of imitation, that is, how difficult it would be with versus without patent protection, for new product imitators to launch their own competing products. Even without patents, the firm that would seek to imitate the Boeing 787 would have to build its own scale models, perform wind tunnel tests, compile detailed engineering drawings and specifications for all structural parts, work out electronic system interfaces, construct full-scale test models, test them both on the ground and in flight for structural soundness and aerodynamic performance, and much else, spending very nearly as much as Boeing did to develop its 787. Presumably, it would have observed Boeing’s design before undertaking the project, and by the time the imitator completed its develop- mental work, Boeing would be a decade ahead in sales and have progressed far down its learning curve, enjoying a substantial production cost advantage. But in pharmaceutical discovery and testing, much of the R&D is aimed at securing knowledge: knowledge of which molecules are therapeutically interesting, knowledge of which molecules work in animals, and most costly, knowledge as to whether a target drug is safe and efficacious in human beings. Once that knowledge is accumulated, absent patent protection, it is essentially there as a public good available to any interested party. Achieving it requires by recent US standards an investment measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars. But for most new drugs, and especially small-molecule drugs, 35 a would-be generic imitator could spend a few million dollars on process engineering and enter the market with an exact knock- off copy. Generic entry in turn could quickly erode the quasi-rents anticipated by a pharmaceutical innovator to repay its R&D investment. Hence the importance attributed to patents by drug companies.\n\nChapter 13: Collective Invention and Inventor Networks (Powell and Giannella)\n\nFrom his studies of the disclosure of improvements in manufacturing processes within the iron industry, Allen suggested that the distinctive feature of collective invention is the exchange and circulation of ideas and practices among distributed networks of individuals located in diverse settings, rather than the housing of such efforts within the confines of particular firms. Building upon Allen’s (1983) work, Nuvolari (2004: p. 348), in his study of Cornish steam pumping engines, defines collective invention as a setting in which: “competing firms release information freely to one another on the design and the performance of the technologies they have just introduced.” Historical examples bear out the importance of collective invention in improving a number of notable technologies (Lamoreaux and Sokoloff, 2000; McGaw, 1987; Meyer, 2003; Scranton, 1997). A general lesson from numerous historical studies is that collective invention was an attempt to overcome the limitations of information access that accompanied extant economic and organizational structures. For some organizations, the inability to appropriate many types of technical improvements resulted in a lack of motivation to pursue internal research programs. Why invest in expensive exploratory efforts when the odds of capturing the fruits of research were low? Participation in collective efforts offered one solution. Many instances of collective invention today represent joint efforts at solving problems whose value cannot be appropriated by a single party, but which represent a bottleneck for the interdependent economic activities of participants. On the other side of the fence, some companies that are actively engaged in R&D may want their researchers to be involved in a larger technical community. Collective invention affords the chance for access to more diverse sources of knowledge, even if gaining control over these divergent ideas proves difficult. With time, many knowledge-sharing practices associated with collective invention can become institutionalized as a set of norms or agreements (David, 2008; Merton, 1979; Sabel and Zeitlin, 1985). In the case of the diffusion of the Bessemer steel process, a patent license that nearly all manufacturers signed had a clause that required any subsequent operational improvements to be disclosed. This mandated sharing of knowledge led to the establishment of a small community of practice among engineers from different firms and launched a productivity race between participants from different firms (Allen, 1983: p. 11). A variety of practices—such as mutually respected prices, collective training programs, and technological standards, that spread risks and dampened competition were commonplace across industrial districts. Nuvolari’s (2004) analysis of Cornish steam engines in the nineteenth century finds that the publication of advances in several trade outlets let to dramatic gains in the efficiency of the engines, due to the accumulation of myriad incremental improvements. Despite the variety of vibrant nineteenth century examples of collective invention, these efforts were largely displaced by the rise of the large corporate research and development (R&D) lab in the early twentieth century. For a time it seemed that these community efforts would be relegated to the annals of history. Over the past 30 years, however, the large corporate R&D lab has fallen in prominence. Many of the most notable corporate labs have been shuttered and dismantled. A second wave of collective invention is now shaping the rate and direction of technological change in numerous technologically advanced industries (Freeman and Soete, 2009). These processes of distributed innovation characterize a wide array of contemporary industries, from the early origins of the computer to the development of software to the genesis and evolution of biotechnology. This transformation has been sparked by strategic, technical, and economic factors that influence the organization of innovative labor. Inventors with multiple contacts across organizations are more likely to be exposed to diverse ideas and benefit from them. Consequently, organizations attempt to position themselves in partnerships and alliances that foster connections across organizational boundaries, in hopes that novel ideas in one setting spark fresh approaches in another (Burt, 2004; Granovetter, 1973; Powell et al., 1996). Shared awareness of a technological frontier creates the circumstances for inventors to act in concert, regardless of the perceived tangible benefits for their organizations. The central technical drivers are shifts in technolog- ical opportunity, dictating the potential rate and direction of technological change (Malerba, 2007). The economic factors are demand (on economic demand vs. need, see Mowery and Rosenberg, 1979) and appropriability (Teece, 1986; Winter, 2006), which together represent necessary conditions for firms to invest in R&D. Yet history and social structure also loom large, as many authors have noted (David, 2008; Scranton, 1993). The particularities of industry evolution and the historical organization of technical communities are deeply intertwined with economic and technical calculations. Whether nineteenth century glass making or blast furnaces, or the contemporary life sciences and open-source software, relationships within a community of inventors and researchers are influenced by a confluence of social, political, and economic forces. We summarize these disparate factors as follows: 1. The need to spread the costs of invention across multiple organizations. a. By implication, few participants possess a sufficient theoretical understanding to pursue new ideas without incurring the high costs of unguided trial and error. 2. The inability to appropriate innovations creates a discrepancy between the private value and social value of invention. a. The private value of invention is too low for some firms to pursue a technology individually, but individuals within these firms are able to recognize its potential benefits. b. Despite a lack of knowledge about demand and strong intellectual property rights, collective invention allows for continued improvement of technical performance. 3. The emergence of norms and identification of governance structures that encourage knowledge sharing among legally distinct parties. 4. Uncertainty about the direction a technology will evolve and the kinds of applications that may unfold encourage greater discussion within and across communities and provide an impetus for organizing. Collective invention thus involves the combination of both open innovation and private interests. Participants move in and out of technical communities, and can use their connections for public or private gain. The important point, as Lakhani and Panetta (2007: pp. 104–105) observe in their work on open source, is that: “these systems are not “managed” in the traditional sense of the word, that is, “smart” managers are not recruiting staff, offering incentives for hard work, dividing tasks, integrating activities, and developing career paths. Rather, the locus of control and management lies with the individual participants who decide themselves the terms of interaction with each other.” (See chapter by von Hippel for further discussion). Hughes (1989) describes how the aerospace, computing, and communication industries acquired technological momentum with the injection of cash and the alignment of political and industrial interests behind the systems they produced. For example, in the case of communications, common goals were eventually institutionalized via the ITU’s (International Telecommunications Union) imple- mentation of standards that enabled regional telephone monopolies to interoperate. Systems engineers played the critical role in coordinating the development of various technological systems among dispersed organizations.\n\nChapter 14: The Financing of R&D and Innovation (Hall and Lerner)\n\nt is a widely held view that research and development (R&D) and innovative activities are difficult to finance in a freely competitive market place. Support for this view in the form of economic-theoretic modeling is not difficult to find and probably begins with the classic articles of Nelson (1959) and Arrow (1962), although the idea itself was alluded to by Schumpeter (1942). 1 The main argument goes as follows: the primary output of resources devoted to invention is the knowledge of how to make new goods and services, and this knowledge is nonrival: use by one firm does not preclude its use by another. To the extent that knowledge cannot be kept secret, the returns to the investment in knowledge cannot be appropriated by the firm undertaking the investment, and therefore such firms will be reluctant to invest, leading to the underprovision of R&D investment in the economy. Since the time when this argument was fully articulated by Arrow, it has of course been developed, tested, modified, and extended in many ways. For example, Levin et al. (1987) and Mansfield et al. (1981), using survey evidence, found that imitating a new invention in a manufacturing firm was not free, but could cost as much as 50–75% of the cost of the original invention. This fact will mitigate but not eliminate the underinvestment problem. However, Arrow’s influential paper also contains another reason for underinvestment in R&D, again one which was foreshadowed by Schumpeter and which has been addressed by subsequent researchers in econom- ics and finance: the argument that an additional gap exists between the private rate of return and the cost of capital when the innovation investor and financier are different entities. This chapter concerns itself with this second aspect of the market failure for R&D and other investments in innovation: even if problems associated with incomplete appropriability of the returns to R&D are solved using intellectual property protection, subsidies, or tax incentives, it may still be difficult or costly to finance such investments using capital from sources external to the firm or entrepreneur. That is, there is often a wedge, sometimes large, between the rate of return required by an entrepreneur investing his own funds and that required by external investors. By this argument, unless an inventor is already wealthy, or firms already profitable, some innovations will fail to be provided purely because the cost of external capital is too high, even when they would pass the private returns hurdle if funds were available at a “normal” interest rate. Venture capital can be defined as independently managed, dedicated capital focusing on equity or equity-linked investments in privately held, high-growth companies. Typically, these funds are raised from institutional and wealthy individual investors, through partnerships with a decade-long duration. These funds are invested in young firms, usually in exchange for preferred stock with various special privileges. Ultimately, the venture capitalists sell these firms to corporate acquirers or else liquidate their holdings after taking the firms public. The first venture firm, American Research and Development, was formed in 1946 and invested in companies commercializing technology developed during the Second World War. Because institutions were reluctant to invest, it was structured as a publicly traded closed-end fund and marketed mostly to individuals, a structure emulated by its successors. The subsequent years saw both very good and trying times for venture capitalists. Venture capitalists backed many successful companies, including Apple Computer, Cisco, Genentech, Google, Netscape, Starbucks, and Yahoo! But commitments to the venture capital industry were very uneven, creating a great deal of instability. The annual flow of money into venture funds increased by a factor of 10 during the early 1980s. From 1987 through 1991, however, fund raising steadily declined as returns fell. Between 1996 and 2003, this pattern was repeated. Later in this chapter, we discuss the reasons behind this cyclicality. Venture capital investing can be viewed as a cycle. In this section, we follow the cycle of venture capital activity. We begin with the formation of venture funds. We then consider the process by which such capital is invested in portfolio firms, and the exiting of such investments. We end with a discussion of open research questions, including those relating to internationalization and the real effects of venture activity. Venture capitalists usually make investments with peers. The lead venture firm involves other venture firms. One critical rationale for syndication in the venture industry is that peers provide a second opinion on the investment opportunity and limit the danger of funding bad deals. Lerner (1994a) finds that in the early investment rounds experienced venture capitalists tend to syndicate only with venture firms that have similar experience. He argues that, if a venture capitalist were looking for a second opinion, then he would want to get one from someone of similar or greater ability, certainly not from someone of lesser ability. The advice and support provided by venture capitalists is often embodied in their role on the firm’s board of directors. Lerner (1995) examines whether venture capitalists’ representation on the boards of the private firms in their portfolios is greater when the need for oversight is larger, looking at changes in board membership around the replacement of CEOs. He finds that an average of 1.75 venture capitalists are added to the board between financing rounds when a firm’s CEO is replaced in the interval; between other rounds 0.24 venture directors are added. No differences are found in the addition of other outside directors. Initial research into the exiting of venture investments focused on IPOs, reflecting the fact that the most profitable exit opportunity is usually an IPO. Barry et al. (1990) and Megginson and Weiss (1991) document that venture capitalists hold significant equity stakes and board positions in the firms they take public, which they continue to hold a year after the IPO. They argue that this pattern reflects the certification they provide to investors that the firms they bring to market are not overvalued. Moreover, they show that venture-backed IPOs have less of a positive return on their first trading day, a finding that has been subsequently challenged (Kraus, 2002; Lee and Wahal, 2004). The authors suggest that investors need a smaller discount because the venture capitalist has certified the offering’s quality. Subsequent research has examined the timing of the exit decision. Several potential factors affect when venture capitalists choose to bring firms public. Lerner (1994b) examines how the valuation of public securities affects whether and when venture capitalists choose to finance companies in another private round in preference to taking the firm public. He shows that investors tend to take the firm public when the market value is high, relying on private financings when valuations are lower. Seasoned venture capitalists appear more proficient at timing IPOs. This finding is consistent with the work by Brown, Fazzari, and Petersen on the importance of public equity financing of R&D during the 1990s stock market boom. While the overall level of venture capital returns does not exhibit abnormal returns relative to the market (Brav and Gompers, 1997), there is a distinct rise and fall around the time of the stock distribution. The results are consistent with venture capitalists possessing inside information and with the (partial) adjustment of the market to that information. A related research area is venture-fund performance. Kaplan and Schoar (2005) show substantial performance persistence across consecutive venture funds with the same general partners. General partners that outperform the industry in one fund are likely to outperform in the next fund, while those who underperform in one fund are likely to underperform with the next fund. These results contrast with those of mutual funds, where persistence is difficult to identify. First, Poterba (1987, 1989) notes that the fluctuations could arise from changes in either the supply of or the demand for venture capital. It is very likely, he argues, that decreases in capital gains tax rates increase commitments to venture funds, even though the bulk of the funds are from tax-exempt investors. The drop in the tax rate may spur corporate employees to become entrepreneurs, thereby increasing the need for venture capital. The increase in demand due to greater entrepreneurial activity leads to more venture fund raising. Gompers and Lerner (1998b) find empirical support for Poterba’s claim: lower capital gains taxes have particularly strong effects on venture capital supplied by tax-exempt investors. This suggests that the primary mechanism by which capital gains tax cuts affect venture fund raising is the higher demand of entrepreneurs for capital. The authors also find that a number of other factors influence venture fund raising, such as regulatory changes and the returns of venture funds. A second area is even thornier: the impact of venture capital on the economy. While theorists have suggested a variety of mechanisms by which venture capital may affect innovation, the empirical record is more mixed. It might be thought that establishing a relationship between venture capital and innovation would be straightforward. For instance, one could look in regressions across industries and time whether, controlling for R&D spending, venture capital funding has an impact on various measures of innovation. But even a simple model of the relationship between venture capital, R&D, and innovation suggests that this approach is likely to give misleading estimates. The first of these papers, Hellmann and Puri (2000), examines a sample of 170 recently formed firms in Silicon Valley, including both venture-backed and nonventure firms. Using questionnaire responses, they find empirical evidence that venture capital financing is related to product market strategies and outcomes of startups. They find that firms that are pursuing what they term an innovator strategy (a classification based on the content analysis of survey responses) are significantly more likely to obtain venture capital and also obtain it more quickly. The presence of a venture capitalist is also associated with a significant reduction in the time taken to bring a product to market, especially for innovators. Furthermore, firms are more likely to list obtaining venture capital as a significant milestone in the lifecycle of the company as compared to other financing events. The results suggest significant interrelations between investor type and product market dimensions, and a role of venture capital in encouraging innovative companies. Given the small size of the sample and the limited data, they can only modestly address concerns about causality. Unfortunately, the possibility remains that more innovative firms select venture capital for financing, rather than venture capital causing firms to be more innovative. Kortum and Lerner (2000), by way of contrast, examine whether these patterns can be discerned on an aggregate industry level, rather than on the firm level. They address concerns about causality in two ways. First, they exploit the major discontinuity in the recent history of the venture capital industry: as discussed above, in the late 1970s, the US Department of Labor clarified the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, a policy shift that freed pensions to invest in venture capital. This shift led to a sharp increase in the funds committed to venture capital. This type of exogenous change should identify the role of venture capital, because it is unlikely to be related to the arrival of entrepreneurial opportunities. They exploit this shift in instrumental variable regressions. Second, they use R&D expenditures to control for the arrival of technological opportunities that are anticipated by economic actors at the time, but that are unobserved to econometricians. In the framework of a simple model, they show that the causality problem disappears if they estimate the impact of venture capital on the patent- R&D ratio, rather than on patenting itself. Even after addressing these causality concerns, the results suggest that venture funding does have a strong positive impact on innovation. The estimated coefficients vary according to the techniques employed, but on average a dollar of venture capital appears to be three to four times more potent in stimulating patenting than a dollar of traditional corporate R&D. The estimates therefore suggest that venture capital, even though it averaged less than 3% of corporate R&D from 1983 to 1992, is responsible for a much greater share—perhaps 10%—of US industrial innovations in this decade. These findings have been supported by recent working paper by Mollica and Zingales (2007), who also use an instrumental variable approach based on state pension fund resources to look at the relationship of venture capital and innovation and find a strong relationship. Examples of such programs are the US Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) and Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programs. Together, these programs disbursed $2.4 billion in 1995, more than 60% of the amount from venture capital in that year (Lerner, 1998). In Germany, more than 800 federal and state government financing programs have been established for new firms in the recent past (OECD, 1995). In 1980, the Swedish established the first of a series of investment companies (along with instituting a series of measures such as reduced capital gains taxes to encourage private investments in startups), partly on the US model. By 1987, the government share of venture capital funding was 43% (Karaomerliolu and Jacobsson, 1999). Recently, the United Kingdom has instituted a series of government programs under the Enterprise Fund umbrella which allocate funds to small- and medium-sized firms in high technology and certain regions, as well as guaranteeing some loans to small businesses (Bank of England, 2001). There are also programs at the European level. A limited amount of evidence, most of it US based, exists as to the effectiveness and “additionality” of these programs (see Lerner, 2009 for a review of the key programs and their evaluations). In most cases, evaluating the success of the programs is difficult due to the lack of a “control” group of similar firms that do not receive funding. 13 Therefore, most of the available studies are based on retrospective survey data provided by the recipients; few attempt to address the question of performance under the counterfactual seriously. A notable exception is the study by Lerner (1999), who looks at 1435 SBIR awardees and a matched sample of firms that did not receive awards, over a 10-year postaward period. Because most of the firms are privately held, he is unable to analyze the resulting valuation or profitability of the firms, but he does find that firms receiving SBIR grants grow significantly faster than the others after receipt of the grant. He attributes some of this effect to “quality certification” by the government that enables the firm to raise funds from private sources as well. See Jaffe (2002) for a review of methodologies for evaluation such government programs. For a complete review of the SBIR program, including some case studies, see the National Research Council (2002). 14 Also see Spivack (2001) for further studies of such programs, including European studies, and David et al. (2000) and Klette et al. (2000) for surveys of the evaluation of government R&D programs in general A series of papers by Czarnitzki and coauthors (Aerts and Czarnitzki, 2006; Al"
