I was not happy to hear that IBM had acquired Telelogic. I am\n\nparticularly disappointed in the way IBM has treated its ClearCase\n\nconfiguration management product that it acquired with the purchase of\n\nRational. ClearCase is architecturally brilliant and well implemented.\n\nIts also rather cool to use once you’ve “got it”.\n\nI have seen their plans for Rhapsody for the next few years and honestly\n\nI would not be so worried if I was a user of it. It would be quite a\n\ndifferent thing if i was using Rose or Tau.\n\nRegarding CM tools I'm a synergy user and thats where my concern is.\n\nThere are no clear messages from IBM that I have seen but I can't see\n\nthem keeping two products trying to compete for the same customers. I\n\nthink they will either sell of one product or just kill it by raising\n\nthe support cost closer to inf. or very unlikely sell one off.\n\nI'm not sure if they have any other requirement tool than Doors but as I\n\nunderstand they recently did a \"market adaption\" of the prices. At least\n\nhere in Sweden. That is, they raised them. Alot.\n\n/L"
