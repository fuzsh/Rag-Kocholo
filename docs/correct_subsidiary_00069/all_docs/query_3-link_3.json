        "text": "IBM is one of the few companies existing today with origins that date back to before 1900. Back in 1888, Herman Hollerith, a son of German immigrants, founded the Tabulating Machine Company (TMC) in New York to manufacture machines that automatically recorded and counted punchcardsFootnote 7. After mergers with other firms that produced, inter alia, scales and time recording devices, the Computing Tabulating Recording Company (CTR) was founded in 1911 and renamed International Business Machines in 1924. From 1914 until a year before he died in 1956, Thomas J. Watson, Sr., headed the company and established an extraordinary culture that was characterized in particular by strong sales orientation and a sense of community among the company’s employees. IBM has exercised a decisive influence on the development of ICT and at the same time undergone fundamental changes as a result of this development. The transformation of the past 50 years will be outlined in the following. For simplification, a distinction will be made between three major phase in which the development of ICT gave rise to different forms of business model, organization and corporate culture. Tab. 2 provides an overview of these phases, referred to in the following as the mainframe phase, the service-orientation phase, and the global integration phase.\n\n4.1 The mainframe phase\n\nIn 1956, Thomas Watson, Jr., took over from his father as CEO. That was the period of the development and announcement of the System/360 mainframe family (in 1964) that marked a fundamental innovation in information technology and indirectly ushered in the development of disciplines such as informatics and, later, business and information systems engineering (BISE). What was so impressive about System/360 was the separation of architecture and product, leading to the emergence of a modular, scalable computer system that could be used for both scientific and commercial applications and combined the options of previously different and specialized computer architectures in a uniform architecture (IBM 1964) based on a modular system of integrated circuits with the aid of solid logic technology (Davis et al. 1964, pp. 102 ff). Basing System/360 on this new technology was a very risky strategic decision given the resources invested. At the time, Fortune magazine described the $5B development costs as “IBM’s $5B gamble” (Wise 1966, p. 118). The investment paid dividends, however. Instead of many voluminous special systems, customers were able for the first time to buy a generic computer that could grow with its task by means of modern add-on components without the software for a larger computer system needing to be rewritten each time. Subsequent technological innovations such as CMOS technology or RISC architecture further consolidated IBM’s pioneering role.\n\nIBM built its entire business model around the mainframes. The hardware, software, sales and services, the latter originally being merely system maintenance and not marketed separately, were all geared to System/360. Competitors had a tough time in view of IBM’s research edge and its organization focused on this one system, and many providers vanished from the market. IBM long appeared to be unassailable until, on the one hand, the UNIX open operating environment in the early 1980s offered customers a realistic, high-performance non-proprietary alternative to IBM’s mainframe products, while on the other the emergence of the personal computer, the market effect of which IBM initially underestimated, shifted the market towards decentralized concepts.\n\nIn the late 1980s, IBM’s organization, which was originally focused entirely on System/360, was structured around different IBM product lines, each with its own head of sales. It soon transpired that an integrated view of the customers’ problems was not available because the focus was on each unit’s own solution. In later years, this would even lead to internal competition between mainframe, AIX, AS/400 und PC business units offering customers solutions that sometimes overlapped and were positioned not only against the competition but also against other IBM solutions. While clearly not optimal, this was still bearable in an almost monopolistic market with a limited number of offerings – as IBM held a market share of up to 70 percent (Pugh 1995, pp. 57–58). In an increasingly competitive environment, though, with a large number of alternative products it was posing a serious risk.\n\nIn 1969, IBM’s success even led to the U.S. Department of Justice filing a suit against it for establishing a monopoly position (and thereby breaching the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act), ushering in years of litigation. The case was dropped in 1983, but it nevertheless had far-reaching effects on the company’s business model and organization. In 1969, the previously uncustomary unbundling of software – marketing software separately from hardware – was introduced. This has widely been regarded as the trigger for the establishment of today’s software market (Grad 2002, p. 70; Pugh 2002, p. 58). By the same token, training services were offered for purchase to non-IBM customers for the first time. This marked IBM’s initial step in the direction of a more comprehensive IT service offering. Organizationally, the antitrust suit led to IBM spending years preparing to split into two separate companies. This project was not further pursued, though, once the case was dropped.\n\nThe System/360 innovation also had consequences for IBM’s corporate culture. Watson had deliberately and systematically institutionalized three “basic beliefs” that had made IBM successful under his leadership. They were “excellence in everything we do,” “superior customer service” and “respect for the individual.” These values were firmly incorporated in the remuneration and incentive systems, management training, other training programs, marketing, and customer service, and they enhanced each other. In around 1990, however, the importance and implications of these basic beliefs were entirely different from what they had been in 1960. Rules, values and traditions had not changed with the market and customer environment (Tab. 3):\n\nIn the heyday of System/360, superior customer service mainly meant maintenance of machinery installed at the customer’s premises. Over time, however, the service required became more complex and the customers’ needs changed without IBM’s offerings reflecting this change. Traditional customer service was more of a routine administrative task than a customized activity geared to each customer’s requirements.\n\nOver a period of 30 years in which these values – also driven by the commercial success of the mainframe architecture – were manifested even more strongly in the corporate culture and in IBM’s formal structures, a feeling of unassailability was at times widespread among IBM employees. As IBM’s later CEO, Lou Gerstner, wrote when looking back (Gerstner 2003, p. 189), they seemed to be immune to external influences such as competition, price wars and the like. All of the important developments in IT seemed to originate in IBM research laboratories. Viewed in this light, changes in customer requirements were not a central factor. Excellence in everything we do put the ability to adapt and the speed of change on the back burner. In 1972, for example, former IBM employees founded SAP because they saw no way within IBM to satisfy the growing customer demand for standardized, real-time financial applications.\n\nThe interpretation of respect for the individual changed in much the same way. Given the extent of market success this belief was in some cases interpreted as meaning that every opinion within the company must be heard and “respected,” leading to a lack of readiness to make decisions at IBM (Gerstner 2003, p. 192).\n\n4.2 The service-orientation phase\n\nInnovations in ICT such as the development of personal computers, the establishment of open standards and the concept of client-server architectures – for which IBM was not sufficiently preparedFootnote 8 – led to a progressive decline in the importance of mainframes. Financially, this was intensified by a drastic fall in prices due to the introduction of efficient CMOS technology with which IBM itself was largely associated. The medium-term result was the most serious crisis in the company’s history. After two years with losses of more than $1B, IBM reported losses totaling $4.97B for 1992, at the time the largest-ever corporate loss in U.S. history (Burgess 1993, p. 3).\n\nIt was in this phase that Lou Gerstner took over as CEO in 1993. He realized that the key to restoring the company’s profitability lay in the need to transform its business model. Anticipating that market growth would be mainly in the implementation of technologies, he transformed IBM’s service business from an organization that dealt solely with IBM products (and mainly with their repair and maintenance) into a business unit focused on understanding and satisfying customers’ needs. Whereas previously only IBM solutions were sold, competitors’ services were now included – if they suited the customer’s requirements – and the entire solution was integrated as a service and operated after the sale or developed further if required. At the end of 2002, the $3.5B acquisition of PriceWaterhouseCoopers Consulting (PwCC), one of the largest professional services organizations with around 30,000 employees worldwide, was further evidence for this transformation. Experts saw in it an unexpected change in the market situation: Gartner analyst Ben Pring wrote that “IBM caught everyone unaware with a deal that, although not the largest in revenue terms, is one of the most significant in some time in terms of market dynamics” (Gartner 2002). At the same time IBM stepped up the expansion of its software business, realizing that it must seek to provide total solutions for the customer. This expansion began with the takeover of Lotus in 1995, and its focus was always on middleware as the key to designing integrated total solutions.\n\nIt had decisive consequences for the organization. The commitment to a compact IBM is considered one of Gerstner’s most courageous decisionsFootnote 9. He did not pursue moves called for by the financial markets to break up the company into small, flexible units – in order to promote IBM’s total solution competence and to make the change evidentFootnote 10. At the same time he bundled all of the company’s services in a separate Global Services business unit alongside hardware and software units to make the contribution of services measurable and visible. The new services unit’s organizational structure was no longer geared to products but, consistently, to solutions, such as outsourcing or customer relationship management, and to industries, such as financial services, in order to bundle and develop the corresponding industry skills. The transformation from a manufacturer of capital-intensive products to a company that in the future would be significantly characterized by labor-intensive (“labor-based”) services posed a very special challenge – one of which IBM stayed abreast by means of a fundamental reconception of its business processes.\n\nAt the same time Gerstner had to usher in a change in corporate culture that for one would help to interpret the company’s previously “lived” values correctly and for another would support his strategy. “Until I came to IBM,” he later wrote, “I probably would have told you that culture was just one among several important elements in any organization’s makeup and success – along with vision, strategy, marketing, financials, and the like. I came to see, in my time at IBM, that culture isn’t just one aspect of the game; it is the game. In the end, an organization is nothing more than the collective capacity of its people to create value” (Gerstner 2003, p. 181). He accordingly set IBM three new and simple imperatives:\n\nWin: Since economic activity takes place in competition, with winners and losers, the market should be the decisive criterion for all business activity. This made it clear that the previous values of excellence and superior service were to be measured by the yardstick of commercial success.\n\nExecute: Speed and discipline were to overcome the obsessive perfectionism that had led to market opportunities being missed and had left IBM vulnerable to competitors capitalizing on IBM inventions.\n\nTeam: Every employee must act as a part of one IBM – in full accordance with the basic philosophy of the company’s integrated solution competence.\n\nDuring this phase IBM – while still operating at an undiminished level of high technological competenceFootnote 11 – developed into the world’s largest IT services company: services’ share of IBM sales rose continuously from 27 percent in 1993 via 45 percent in 2002 to 55 percent in 2007.\n\n4.3 The global integration phase\n\nStarting in the late 1990s, a number of ICT innovations led to the emergence of totally new opportunities and risks, first and foremost the commercial use of the Internet and the establishment of open standards. New forms of cooperation across corporate and national borders became possible and many customers’ business models faced fundamental transformations.\n\nUnder Sam Palmisano, who took over as CEO in January 2003, IBM continued in principle the course set under Gerstner while integrating three main aspects into the business model:\n\nBearing in mind that the swift pace of technological change also poses a challenge for the company’s customers, even greater emphasis was put on total solutions for customers that went beyond IT solutions. As an “innovator’s innovator,” IBM stepped up its commitment to providing customers with integrated assistance to gain a competitive edge in their respective industriesFootnote 12. The acquisition of PwCC, with the takeover of a large number of highly qualified consultants with industry-specific experience laid the groundwork for implementation. Global organizational structures were created to make industry-specific know-how available around the world and to provide worldwide support for international customers.\n\nWith the advent of global networks by means of modern ICT, a worldwide integration of processes and value chains within the company became possible, leading to significant economies of scale. Corporate functions were no longer replicated; they were established once only and with global responsibility. For this, Palmisano (2006, p. 131) coined the concept of the globally integrated enterprise.\n\nAs ICT undergoes progressive evolution, the value contributions of individual business segments change as well. IBM consistently focused on premium segments such as integrated management consulting and enlarged them further. Product areas that had become commodities as a result of ICT trends were sold off. After the sale of the hard drive division, IBM also sold its PC business to Lenovo in 2005. At the same time it acquired a number of small and midrange software companies, such as Rational in 2003 and Cognos in 2007, thereby making appropriate additions to the company’s solutions portfolio.\n\nThis was also directly reflected in IBM’s business organization. To make its consulting business both more visible and measurable, the services division was split into two business units, Global Business Services (GBS) and Global Technology Services (GTS). GBS was consistently structured along customer industries and solutions. Central corporate functions such as procurement, supply chain management, and financial management were assigned to a central, worldwide leadership that would be in charge of strategy, processes and systems. Global procurement responsibility, for example, was consolidated in Shenzhen, China, in 2006."
