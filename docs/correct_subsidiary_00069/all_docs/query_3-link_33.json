        "text": "Gridrunner, Chuckie Egg, Jet Set Willy, Halls of the Things, Paradroid... These games clearly date me, but they highlight an overlooked aspect of computing: maximising hardware potential with minimal code. The ZX81 had 1KB of RAM (upgradeable to 16KB with Blu-Tak), followed by the Spectrum 48, Vic-20, and Commodore 64, but despite this these games still rival newer ones for true gameplay. Jeff Minter, aka YAK, was a legend for pushing hardware limits and creating masterpieces. Like modern UX designers, Jeff focused on gameplay, and with such limited resources, he excelled in maximising the value of code when computing power was so limited. With gaming consoles, we met characters like Lara Croft and Nathan Drake, and games such as Call of Duty evolving from Doom. These immersive games feature fantastic cut-scenes and stunning visuals. The gaming industry, worth billions, heavily researches dopamine production to keep players hooked, it's the software equivalent of cocaine for generating dopamine. Dopamine drives us, with anticipation of the task being the reward, not the completion of the task. This leads to technical debt. A game like Tomb Raider, at its core, is similar to Chuckie Egg—moving the main character around the screen. The code required to generate dopamine has increased, as has the amount of code, but have we made beneficial advances? Developers have become complacent, relying on more power, no-code solutions, and old code refactoring. Consider the sustainability impact: significant effort and computing power are driven by profit, with freemium models and DLCs forming key revenue streams. Look into \"chasing the whale\" for insights on in-game currency revenue and the methods used. Dragon City gems anyone?! Sustainable Engineering focuses on reducing costs and computing power, leading to FinOps' growth. However, the focus should be on the application itself, not just resources. FinOps combines Finance and DevOps, aiming to reduce computing power for applications. For example, a pricing tool should check prices only when necessary, not for each product every time. Efficient applications use caching to reduce database queries, improving user satisfaction and NPS while preventing revenue loss. When improving applications, consider: Can data travel distance be reduced? Can eco-modes change application behavior? Are we developing hardware-efficient applications? Next time you use an application or play a game (even Candy Crush), consider the resources behind it. How many applications in your organisation use excessive resources or \"lazy code\" ? Are developers \"gilding the lily\" when simpler solutions suffice? Remember the classic idiom, \"You can't polish a turd, but you can roll it in glitter.\" Whilst this is a crude analogy, consider your approach when modernising, sometimes a sprinkle of glitter is enough. If you'll excuse me, I'm off to create a sales quote using a new tool... #FinOps #SustainableDesign #DevOps\n\nAs I stepped onto my morning train, I noticed two vacant seats at a table. Politely, I inquired, \"Do you mind if I sit here?\" One passenger graciously rose to accommodate me, while the other removed her bag from the seat in front of her. To my surprise, the bag turned out to be a cat carrier, emitting a rather unpleasant odour. When I requested she relocate the carrier so I could utilise the table, it was met with resistance and muttered discontent. Eventually, albeit reluctantly, she complied. Soon after, the ticket inspector approached the table, it was clearly not the first time to be inquiring about her ticket situation. She explained her inability to purchase one at Milton Keynes, the station we had just passed through, although he reminded her their first interaction was a good few stops before Milton Keynes. However, when asked where she had boarded, claiming fatigue, she conveniently couldn't recall. Attempting to purchase a ticket from Bletchley, the next stop, was the final straw for the inspector. He firmly insisted she disembark at Bletchley to resolve the matter; \"You'll be getting off at Bletchley, it's lovely station and you can then sort your ticket out from there\". In response, the passenger, visibly disgruntled, declared herself too fatigued for further debate, staunchly convinced of her innocence. With exaggerated sighs and huffs, she exited the train. The audacity of the ticket inspector suggesting Bletchley as a pleasant station did make me chuckle to myself... What troubled me most was not just her lack of a ticket or her occupation of multiple seats, including one for her pet, but her unwavering belief in her victimhood. What scares me the most though the narrative building in my head, not \"Once upon a time\" but the much more concerning, \"The youth of today...\"\n\nI love detail, a trait well-known to those acquainted with me. A defining moment for me occurred during an chat with Charles N M Lupton. He remarked, 'Derek, the issue you face, you know your products too well...' which isn't always an advantage for a seller. When pressure mounts, we instinctively retreat to our comfort zones, for me, that sanctuary lies in the intricacies of detail. I understand why now, it's my neurodiversity superpower! As it's Neurodiversity Advancement Month, I wanted to share a few personal insights. \"Power Moves\" I assume everyone has the same level of understanding and unfortunately that can lead to a perception I'm being patronising. In Annie Kotowicz's book \"What I Mean When I Say I'm Autistic,\" Chapter 7 delves into Misunderstandings, where 'Power Moves' emerged as an epiphany for me. Kotowicz reflects,\"It was't until my thirties that I learned some people correct factual errors as a power move. That explains why teachers rarely appreciatted it when I pointed out their mistakes...\" This resonates deeply with my experience, the most extreme, when my Chemistry teacher challenged me to explain a concept to the class, I took up the challenge and did the rest of the lesson. In case you were wondering it was about moles (Avogadro, not furry) Back to Annie, \"...For me, showing someone where they're wrong feels like keeping them safe from the consequences of their mistake. It's a collaborative pursuit of truth, not a power move.\" Individuals with autism are often targeted by bullies of all ages, something I've experienced way too many times. It is unfortunate that what I perceive as being helpful can be misinterpreted as implying I don't trust a person's ability. \"Enthusiasm vs. Aggression\" When I get passionate about a subject,my excitement gets the better of me and I can spiral out of control, think Tigger! I have Jayne Hudson to thank for the phrase \"I've been Derek'd\". I'd shared some insight with the level of enthusiasm that belongs only on American Informmercials, \"Hi, I'm Barry Scott....\" \"Skin as Thick as a Rhino\" My lifestory, if transposed into an Eastenders script, would seem too fantastical for the screen, especially the last 10 years. By confronting and transcending adversity this has made me the strong person I am . When sharing experiences with friends facing challenges, it's not about one-upmanship but rather a gesture of solidarity, illustrating that adversity, however daunting, is surmountable. Depression, I've learned, is subjective, devoid of comparative scales; every individual's struggle is valid and worthy of acknowledgment. I've embraced my neurodiversity as a superpower, it's been with me for five decades and it's who I am!\n\nTwo recent experiences highlighted the dangers of relying too much on AI, not looking at the wider picture and using AI as an excuse for poor service. 1 – Ticket to Bristol Having checked train times via the Journey Planner I waited my turn at the ticket office, when I asked for a ticket it was over £200! I questioned this as £89 was my expectation, “It’s the AI” was the rather glib response. “Excuse me” I asked, why is that price much higher? There was a further mention of AI and a look that suggested I do not know immense value and power of AI in helping my day to day life. I declined this offer, said I’d use the machine instead and paid £89 for my ticket… 2 – Part Exchange Having done my research including part exchange values I set off for a test drive. I enjoyed the car and was ready to buy. The salesman went to “work the numbers”, adding extras he couldn’t explain and gave me what was an insulting px value, half the price their site offered before I’d walked in. Partial service history and scratched alloys were the excuse, although this had already been added to the website. I pointed out my point of reference was their website and redid it in front of the seller. I’ll need to speak to my manager was the inevitable comment “You do that, your offer is insulting and I’m off for another test drive” was my response. The look on his face reminded me of Nigel Tufnel, when explaining that “Eleven is One Louder”… In both examples, I’d done my own research, but the human was unable to move away from “what AI was saying”. For the train I made a large saving, but for the car salesman he lost a sale, I bought the other car I test drove and ended up paying 20% more than my intended budget. Had the salesman used common sense, rather than trying to justify what was clearly a poor approach from AI, they would have made a sale. Whilst AI has it’s place, it’s there to support or augment human decision making and not to relied on, without context it leads to lost sales, poor customer service and this post!"
