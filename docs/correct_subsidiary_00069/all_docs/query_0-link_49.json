        "text": "New Orleans—Developers hoping to hear IBM convey definitive plans for its new Rational tool line may have been disappointed at last week’s developerWorks Live conference here.\n\nBut through interviews, IBM executives began to provide more details about its plans for Rational Software Corp., which it acquired for $2.1 billion in February (see story).\n\nSteve Mills, senior vice president of IBM’s Software Group, said his application integration and middleware unit is working with the Rational team on a road map. Customers can expect announcements and possibly some integrated product deliveries beginning later this year, with more expansive product rollouts starting next year, Mills said.\n\nSeveral users said the integration of the companies’ product lines, particularly the Rational XDE modeling tool that some of them already use and IBM’s WebSphere Studio Application Developer, will be of key importance to them.\n\n“We’re pretty happy with WebSphere Studio Application Developer, but if they could add the [Rational] modeling pieces, that’s a plus,” said Ronald Donson, vice president of retail architecture at Wachovia Corp. in Charlotte, N.C. “We’re looking for it to blend. I don’t want to have to buy the wheels, then the seat covers.”\n\n“It’s nice to have the design patterns at your fingertips—or at your mouse—rather than having to look them up in a book,” said Todd Baldwin, an applications engineer at American Family Insurance Group in Madison, Wis. “To see it in a piece of software really opened my eyes up, because it seems like it’s going to be easier to use.”\n\nColleague Paula Waite, a software engineering specialist, said American Family has purchased several copies of Rational XDE, and she hopes the integrated Rational XDE/WebSphere tool will be cheaper than the products are now when purchased separately.\n\nDevelopers can already use Rational XDE within the same interface as WebSphere Application Developer, since Rational did the work to make the XDE tool plug into IBM’s Eclipse open-source platform.\n\nBut IBM executives said the level of integration will be more extensive in the future. IBM can “drive a very deep level of integration” down into the runtime, Mills said.\n\nGrady Booch, chief scientist in the Rational division, said the sweet spot for integration will be a model-driven architecture leveraging the Unified Modeling Language standard, which provides mechanisms for visualizing different aspects of a system, from the deployment architecture to the component architecture and even database schemas. He said business rules could be written in a graphical way.\n\n“We have that deep semantics inside XDE, and so the opportunity is to get that level of deep integration,” he said.\n\nBooch added that “the ultimate would be debugging at the level of graphics.” He said graphical models can be tied to the running system, something Rational already has demonstrated in distributed systems. Booch predicted that that capability will be included in XDE within a year.\n\nEric Schoor, vice president of marketing at Cupertino, Calif.-based Rational, said he can envision other areas of integration between the Rational tool line and other IBM products, such as the DB2 database server, Lotus collaboration products and Tivoli systems management software.\n\nSchoor noted that the majority of Rational’s tools have a relational database as their persistent storage mechanism. “We could use DB2 as the underlying database in many of our tools, which will simplify their management,” he said.\n\nThe Lotus collaboration technology could be used to help developers team on projects, he said.\n\nThere is also an opportunity for Rational to integrate its configuration management wares with Tivoli products to create “a more seamless and automated deployment environment,” Schoor said.\n\n“When an application is running, we can leverage the Tivoli monitoring technology to provide information to developers about what’s going right and wrong,” he said.\n\nBut Schoor was quick to add, “These are concepts, not committed plans.”\n\nJohn Meyer, an analyst at Cambridge, Mass.-based Forrester Research Inc., said he’s waiting for IBM to fully integrate the product line, from XDE for development to Tivoli for deployment, and to provide direction to the developer community when there are duplicative capabilities in tools.\n\nHe noted, for example, that three tools—Rational XDE, a tool that IBM acquired from Holosofx Inc., and a tool that Rational acquired from NeuVis Inc.—all contain differing levels of business process modeling capabilities.\n\n“What they haven’t done is rolled out a road map of which tools will merge in the future,” Meyer said.\n\nRoger Oberg, director of market management in the Rational division, said XDE is aimed at developers building components, the NeuVis tool is for corporate developers assembling components, and the Holosofx technology is aimed at business managers or operations executives, not the software development team.\n\n“We’ve got to refine the story so that people understand there are different types of developers, and we have different products for different types,” Oberg said."
