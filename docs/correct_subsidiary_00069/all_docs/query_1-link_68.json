        "text": "DevOps Means Using The Tools You Already Have Better\n\nWhen modernizing development processes on IBM i, the most efficient thing to do, always, is to make use of enterprise tools already in place within the organization and integrate these into a cohesive IBM i workflow that shepherds code from idea to production all along the way.\n\nTake A Progressive Approach To DevOps\n\nAs Gene Amdahl, the chief architect of the IBM System/360 mainframe, correctly observed and what was subsequently codified as Amdahl’s Law, any kind of system that implements any kind of process is only as fast as its slowest component.\n\nThe First Step In DevOps Is Not Tools, But Culture Change\n\nThe combination and automation of application development and IT operations, commonly known as DevOps, is itself like the processes it automates – it is a process of continual change through iteration and improvement. And so, like most things in life (other than vacation, maybe), it is a journey – not a destination.\n\nVS Code Is The Full Stack IDE For IBM i\n\nIn this article, we want to talk about the new features we are exposing in VS Code for users of the application development tooling available from ARCAD Software.\n\nRealizing The Promise Of Cross Platform Development With VS Code\n\nThe choice of IDE should not hinder developers as they create applications for the IBM i platform, and moreover, the choice of the VS Code IDE commonly used by developers working on Linux, MacOS, and Windows platforms should not stop them from developing code for the IBM i platform.\n\nExpanding Fields Is A Bigger Pain In The Neck Than You Think\n\nRemember the Y2K problem, when companies had two-digit dates for years in their applications and the millennial turn was coming and they suddenly needed a four-digit date so all the math would work out right comparing the present, future, and past?\n\nValue Stream Management (VSM): Bringing Lean Manufacturing Techniques To IBM i Development\n\nWith the evolution of DevOps it is only natural that an important aspect of lean manufacturing, called value stream management (VSM), is being brought to bear in software development in general and now, starting with some new features being added to ARCAD V13.2, for IBM i shops in particular.\n\nArcad Software: Git DevOps Going on IBM I\n\nWith open source technology revolutionizing how DevOps systems work, many businesses running on IBM i find themselves at a crossroads if they want to stay competitive: rebuild their entire codebase from scratch, or modernize their existing application.\n\nArcad Software Explains How to Manage Test Data for Better Testing on IBM i\n\nARCAD software has developed powerful automation tools, such as its i Unit and Verifier that can greatly automate and improve both your unit testing and functional test processes.\n\nIBM i – A legacy of open source\n\nIBM’s legacy in the open world has been well-documented, from their work with Linux, Apache, and Eclipse in the early years of open source to more current work across all layers of the cloud stack, application development, blockchain, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and machine learning...\n\nGit on IBM i: How To Succeed\n\nOne of the main challenges in integrating Git into IBM i is is the ‘technology gap’ between Git and the antiquated change management systems still in use on the platform. To appreciate this statement, we need to take a look back at the recent history of the IBM i itself, and ask ourselves ‘why Git?’\n\nAccording to ARCAD software the future of IBM i depends on open-source tools\n\nThe IBM i (aka iSeries, AS/400) platform has been embedded in the framework of tens of thousands of organizations for over 30 years, creating the systematic bedrock for businesses who rely on the security, dependability and low administration overhead that characterizes the platform.\n\nUnit Testing Automation Hits Shift Left Instead of Ctrl-Alt-Delete Cash\n\nThere is an alternative to a big-bang transformation, a progressive path to a fully automated and modern development toolchain, yielding incremental returns. Start with unit testing automation.\n\nIt’s Time For An Application Healthcheck\n\nIBM i applications have the same issues as people, as does all software running on any platform – although software is a bit different in that it can be replaced, renewed, rewritten, refurbished or simply left to rot in its swamp of technical debt.\n\nARCAD releases Azure DevOps integration for all-in-one CI/CD automation on IBM i\n\nNew ARCAD for DevOps release enables rapid automation of IBM i application build and deploy within any existing Azure DevOps toolstack.\n\nThe New Economy Presents New Opportunities For IBM i\n\nEconomic downturns don’t cause technology shifts, but they do have a habit of accelerating them. The evolution of any technology follows its own path, as inventors and engineers try to meet customer wants and needs, and this transformation is fairly straightforward when the economy is robust and people feel they can invest time and money in something.\n\nDROPS ‘release plans’ reduce risk in multi-technology, multi-cloud application deployment\n\nNew DROPS release secures large-scale application deployments, coordinating the release of both legacy and modern code in an automated workflow.\n\nARCAD Software seals partnership with HCL Software DevOps to Deliver Full-stack DevOps for IBM i (aka iSeries, AS/400)\n\nARCAD Software announces it has partnered with HCL Software DevOps to offer a full stack, enterprise-grade DevOps solution combining an end-to-end CI/CT/CD pipeline for IBM i (aka iSeries, AS/400) with best-in-class value stream management and test automation capabilities.\n\nCreating Web Services APIs Can Be Easy On IBM i\n\nARCAD created ARCAD API, a solution which takes heritage applications using the 5250 green screen protocol and allows portions of code to be accessed, wrapped up, and turned into a Web service that can be called like any other API by programming languages old and new.\n\nJenkins Gets Closer IBM i Hooks, Courtesy Of ARCAD\n\nFor some time, IBM i shops have been behind the curve when it comes to using modern DevOps and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) technologies and techniques.\n\nARCAD automates end-to-end CloudBees CI/CD Pipeline for RPG/COBOL on IBM i\n\nARCAD Software today announced the end-to-end integration of its CI/CD stack for RPG and COBOL application development within CloudBees CI (Core), continuous software delivery system based on Jenkins.\n\nARCAD Hooks Cross-Reference Tool into LPEX Editor\n\nIBM i developers won’t have to leave the comfort of RDi and the LPEX editor to engage in application cross-referencing tasks, thanks to the recent integration between the ARCAD Observer cross-referencing software with LPEX.\n\nARCAD Generates APIs From 5250 Screens\n\nARCAD Software’s latest offering, ARCAD API, takes much of the pain and complexity out of the API generation process.\n\nARCAD Observer LPEX integration brings new levels of development speed & accuracy to IBM i\n\nARCAD Software today announced the V12 TR1 release of ARCAD Observer, introducing a powerful application-wide IBM i cross-referencing capability into the LPEX editor in RDi.\n\nARCAD Software launches ARCAD API, Web service generation solution for IBM i\n\nARCAD Software today announced the launch of ARCAD API, for auto- generation of RESTful Web services directly from any native IBM i 5250 application interface.\n\nUnit Testing Gets A Boost With ARCAD\n\n“If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.” The famous management consultant Peter Drucker said those words to relate his philosophy on achieving business success. He didn’t know it at the time, but they would also apply to software development, including the testing of software, which is an area that ARCAD Software knows a thing or two about.\n\nNew ARCAD Software release prioritizes “Unit Test” automation for IBM i\n\nARCAD iUnit was originally launched in 2018 to complement ARCAD’s functional test automation solution ARCAD Verifier. ARCAD iUnit allows procedures, functions and service programs on IBM i to be tested individually, defining test “success” or “failure” in terms of assertions on resulting parameter values.\n\nThe Gamification Of Good Coding Practices\n\nThere are many things that are important about creating good code, but perhaps the most important is the idea that there are good coding practices and that everyone coding, no matter what the programming language and no matter what the type of application they are creating, should adhere to some standards of quality.\n\nThe All-Knowing, Benevolent Dictator Of Code\n\nNot every software project can have an all-knowing benevolent dictator looking through every line of code, and even all projects could have such a person to oversee the quality of the code, there is no reason to not automate as much of this very important code review job as is possible.\n\nARCAD Software announces ARCAD iNow for UI modernization on IBM i\n\nNew UI modernization tooling completes ARCAD’s integrated offering for Modernization and DevOps on IBM i.\n\nSoftware Change Management Has To Change With The DevOps Times\n\nIt is easier to change a system or a software development stack than it is to change the habits and preferences of people. People are the biggest friction in adopting new technologies – right up until the moment they are not. And then they are easy. So it is with any technology, and the transition from traditional software change management to open source DevOps tools is no different.\n\nARCAD and Skytap announce global partnership to deliver Application Modernization and DevOps for IBM i in the cloud\n\nARCAD announced their partnership with Skytap, global cloud provider delivering an industry-first, multi-tenant public cloud offering for IBM i.\n\nARCAD Software V11 release marries traditional IBM i development with open systems world of Git\n\nARCAD Software announced key V11 release launching a new graphical process manager for IBM i, continuous test automation and deep integration with Git and Jenkins for synchronized development in both traditional and modern development environments.\n\nAttention Synon Users: You Can Automate Your Move To RPG Free Form And DevOps\n\nDepending on who you ask, there are about 1,000 IBM i shops that used the CA 2E (Synon) CASE tool to create their applications and are still using this tool to maintain those applications. This is not an easy task any more, and there is a much better way.\n\nARCAD Software joins the HEXATRUST digital trust alliance\n\nARCAD Software announces today its participation in HEXATRUST, the alliance founded by the French leaders of cloud computing and cybersecurity to promote and build trust in Cloud and Cyber excellence.\n\nOne Repository To Rule The Source – And Object – Code\n\nThe concept of a single repository for source is not necessarily a new one. When I interviewed with ARCAD back in 2011, I did so at the at the Rational conference called Innovate in Orlando.\n\nARCAD Software launches “Pay-per-Use” system for DROPS, their flagship Application Release Orchestration (ARO) solution\n\nARCAD Software, market leader in Enterprise DevOps and Modernization solutions, today announced the launch of a new Pay-per-Use pricing system for DROPS, their flagship Application Release Orchestration solution.\n\nGetting Progressive About Regression Testing\n\nIf you want to employ modern software development and testing techniques, you have to move on from simple unit testing by developers and implement regression testing in your quality assurance (QA) organization. This is perhaps the best way to take the risk out of continuous development – something that companies have to embrace if they are to remain competitive.\n\nARCAD releases new CodeChecker module to guarantee software quality and reduce DevOps risk\n\nARCAD Software, leading vendor in DevOps and Enterprise Modernization solutions for IBM i, today announced the release of a new module in its DevOps suite: ARCAD-CodeChecker, for continuous source code quality analysis.\n\nTransforming The Art Of Code And The Face Of IBM i\n\nARCAD has been in business for 25 years, and we have done a lot of technical innovation over those years. We started our business with traditional software change management, on the software change management at that time, which is the combination of having a set of tools to manage developer work and then to transfer from development to test to production.\n\nGitHub: How Developers Got to Run the World (sic)\n\nOf the world’s most visited websites this month, GitHub rates 59 and climbing. Not bad considering that GitHub’s appeal is limited to software developers, whereas the other popular sites like Google and Amazon have a planetary audience. Is software becoming as important as the written word?\n\nARCAD Secures Funding To Fuel Expansion\n\nThe financial incentives instigating investors to back companies that create software and provide services to the IBM i community continue to raise eyebrows and elicit surprise among those unfamiliar with the innovation taking place in the so-called legacy netherworld.\n\nArcad Software, a world leader in Application Lifecycle Management solutions, announces a € 2.5M fundraising from Alto Invest\n\nCreated 25 years ago and present in Europe, USA and Asia, Arcad Software is among the top 3 global vendors specializing in Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) and Enterprise Modernization for IBM i (aka iSeries, AS/400) environments.\n\nARCAD Software and Meridian Group International form global partnership to launch Release Management as a Service\n\nNew agreement allies leading DevOps solutions vendor with global equipment lessor and top provider of IT solutions, services and support.\n\nIBM i Vendor Breaks Into Gartner Magic Quadrant\n\nFinding an IBM i software vendor in the Gartner Magic Quadrant is sort of like finding a four-leaf clover. It doesn’t happen very often and it feels like a lucky day when you do. Last week, ARCAD Software made it into the coveted quad in the Application Release Automation category.\n\nARCAD Software recognized in the 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Release Automation\n\nChavanod, France — Oct 24, 2017 – ARCAD Software today announced that it has been recognized in Gartner’s 2017 “Magic Quadrant for Application Release Automation” report for its DROPS solution.\n\nARCAD’s DevOps technology for IBM i now distributed by IBM as ARCAD Pack for i\n\nPeterborough, NH, 13 September 2017 – ARCAD Software, leading vendor in DevOps and Enterprise Modernization solutions for IBM i, today announced the inclusion of their DevOps technology within IBM’s product offering, distributed under the name ARCAD Pack for i.\n\nARCAD Magnifies The i In Its Multi-Platform Array\n\nWhile RDi development gets some help from one IBM i vendor, another vendor is enhancing its RDi-specific software. ARCAD Software, makers of ARCAD Pack for i, has enhanced its IBM UrbanCode Deploy and improved support for deployment to IBM i.\n\nARCAD announced its partnership with Apper Systems AB\n\nStockholm, Sweden, 30 May 2017 – ARCAD Software, leading vendor in DevOps and Modernization solutions for IBM i, today announced its partnership with Apper Systems AB, to support major expansion of ARCAD operations in the Nordic region.\n\nARCAD And GitHub Prepare For A Paradigm Shift\n\nOne platform. One island. One epic story of survival. That may be over dramatizing the IBM i environment, but it makes a point about the dangers of single-platform thinking in a world that is multi-platform oriented. That thought occurred to me when I first heard that ARCAD Software, an IBM i vendor specializing in application development and DevOps, was partnering with GitHub, a collaboration-oriented software company focused on code sharing and reducing software delivery schedules.\n\nARCAD Forms Strategic Partnership with GitHub to offer Collaborative Application Development and DevOps on IBM i\n\nPeterborough, NH, 28 April 2017 – ARCAD Software, leading vendor in DevOps and Modernization solutions for IBM i, today announced a strategic partnership with GitHub, builder of a web-based collaboration platform used by more than 21M software developers, to advance code sharing and reuse on IBM i, and shorten software delivery schedules.\n\nARCAD strengthens IBM’s modernization portfolio with ARCAD RPG Converter for IBM i and ARCAD Observer for IBM i\n\nPeterborough, NH, 13 April 2017 – ARCAD Software, leading vendor in Enterprise Modernization and DevOps solutions for IBM i, today announced the inclusion of two key ARCAD modernization solutions within IBM’s Configurator e-config (AAS) ordering system, automating the conversion of RPG source code and the analysis of existing IBM i applications.\n\nIBM announces ARCAD-Observer for IBM i and ARCAD RPG Converter for IBM i\n\nARCAD RPG Converter for IBM i, V1.1 and ARCAD Observer for IBM i, V1.1 strengthen support for developers of business applications\n\nARCAD Upgrades DevOps Software For IBM i\n\nFor IBM i shops that have been using change management software for years, DevOps looks very familiar. Both improve quality and lower risk. And both make use of a framework and collaborative achievements. The major distinction for DevOps is that the collaboration involves a much wider universe of contributors. It takes into account other IT platforms and blows up the individual siloes by integrating tools and processes. And it further integrates IT and business with incremental improvements and enhancements continuously tested and put into production.\n\nDROPS Software sign strategic DevOps deal in Netherlands: BEESD/Volvo\n\nAnnecy, 13th of January 2017 DROPS Software, is a start-up and subsidiary of the ARCAD Software Group, which counts more than 24 years of experience in software Release Management.
