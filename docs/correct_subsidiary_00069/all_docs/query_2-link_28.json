        "text": "In Headline News: Another promising company was sentenced to death late last month for being too good at what IBM said it was already good at -- as IBM acquired FinOps provider Apptio.\n\nCongratulations to the folks at Vista for the excellent value creation work, selling for $4.6 Billion a company they purchased for $1.94 Billion in 2019. Not bad considering 3.5 of those years were impacted by a global pandemic. The deal was just finalized earlier this month.\n\nhttps://www.pehub.com/vista-wraps-up-4-6bn-sale-of-apptio-to-ibm/\n\nCondolences to the folks at Apptio. Be prepared for the onslaught of destruction from runaway bride-eyed middle managers who insist that you must now blue-wash your contracts, slash your R&D budgets, fire all your top innovative (expensive) people, and construct report after report communicating nonsense on top of nonsense for layer beyond layer of middle management oversight. Oh yeah, also, sorry to tell you, but you're a financial company now, no longer a tech company.\n\nSo sorry also for any actual customers out there who used to like working with Apptio as your life is also about to change as well (and not for the better).\n\nJust out of morbid curiosity, how many people today are using:\n\ni2\n\nFileNet\n\nCognos\n\nSoftLayer\n\nGreenplum\n\nLotus Software\n\nRational Software\n\nSterling Commerce\n\nThe genocidal IBM acquisition team has forged the world's best, most amazing 'kiss of death' cultural integration process ever conceived, let alone conjured, and the mere touch of its gangrenous apparatus is enough to eradicate the hip, vibrant, innovative, forward-thinking, trendsetting, influential, and buzz-worthy.\n\nThe avant-garde who believe they are well-established and insulated from this insanity should especially take note because you will be among the first to be targeted for humiliation and destruction.\n\nNET(net) Can Help:\n\nContact us today to learn more about how we can help you save 13-53% on all your technology investments.\n\nCall to Action\n\nSign up Now for a Savings Cloud subscription, and we will get started right away to help you minimize costs and risks and maximize the realization of value and benefit of all your technology agreements, investments, and relationships.\n\nSummary\n\nNET(net) offers you (i) a federated view of the market to understand the art of the possible, (ii) substantial buy-side knowledge and subject matter expertise to develop a plan of action that overlays the potential opportunities for value capture onto your specific environment and use cases, including, but not limited to, your business requirements, your use cases, your user demographics, and your consumption patterns among other considerations, and (iii) deep supply-side commercial expertise to model the various deal permutations to demonstrate what actions offer the highest yield of savings and benefits.
