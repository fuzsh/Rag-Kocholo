The effectiveness of this information depends on your ability to parse, validate, and integrate complex sources, and your ability to understand where it comes from and what happens to it along the way. Organizations are unable to remain competitive without the ability to have complete, trusted information to both drive decisions and interact with customers and business partners. The concept of trusted information necessitates a complete understanding of the lineage and validity of information. Two main aspects of these offerings enhance trust in information:\n\nComplete lineage reporting across tools using IBM Metadata Workbench\n\nValidation of complex source structures and contents using WebSphere Transformation Extender for DataStage\n\n\"DB2® Cube Views creates a unique OLAP platform based on open standards that allows BI application tools to connect easier, deploy faster, and perform better than before. BI client tools, when connected to the DB2 Cube Views platform, can increase the number of BI users throughout an organization by decreasing application deployment time, increasing ease of use and performance of business analysis applications, and decreasing data integrity issues. More types of users will be able to use BI because access to the data warehouse will be simpler, faster, and scale along CPUs.\n\nNumerous vendors have already signed on to support this new, open BI platform from IBM. Ascential Software, Brio, Business Objects, Cognos, IBM OLAP Server, Kalido, Microstrategy, and Rocket Software state they are developing a bridge for DB2 Cube Views.
