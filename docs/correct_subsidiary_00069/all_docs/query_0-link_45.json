This example uses the implemented by link type:\n\nExample 4:\n\nFor queries that are based on a link type that uses the \"in\" modifier. This example uses the implemented by link type:\n\nExample 5:\n\nTo query requirements in a specific folder, use a query similar to:\n\noslc.where=nav:parent=<https://grarrc.ibm.com:9443/rm/folders/_RHCJYN5jEeGb6IIbvOh9Dw>\n\nExample 6:\n\nTo query all collections in a specific project use a query similar to:\n\noslc.where=rdf:type=<http://open-services.net/ns/rm#RequirementCollection>\n\nExample 7:\n\nTo query all artifacts in a collection based on the collection's identifier, use a query similar to:\n\noslc.where=dc:identifier=1\n\nExample 8:\n\nTo query all collections that contain one or several requirements, use a query similar to:\n\nExample 9:\n\nTo query all requirements in a specific project, use a query similar to:\n\noslc.where=rdf:type=<http://open-services.net/ns/rm#Requirement>\n\nExample 10:\n\nTo query all artifacts of a specific type, use a similar query to:\n\noslc.where=rm:ofType=<https://grarrc.ibm.com:9443/rm/types/_SAwm2t5jEeGb6IIbvOh9Dw>\n\nNote\n\n: This code can be used as a workaround when you want to query against \"oslc:instanceShape\". The value that is used in the query can be obtained from either of these locations:\n\nExample 11:\n\nTo query all folders that contain artifacts in a project, use a query similar to:\n\noslc.where=rdf:type=<http://open-services.net/ns/rm#Requirement>\n\nExample 12:\n\nTo query all the artifacts that were modified on August 1, 2012, at 21:50:40.979 or later, use a query similar to:\n\noslc.where=dc:modified>=\"2012-08-01T21:51:40.979Z\"%5E%5Exsd%3AdateTime\n\nNote:\n\nThis query must specify the date in the following format: ^^xsd:dateTime. (Must be encoded)\n\nExample 13:\n\nTo query all the artifacts that have the Status property set to 'Approved', use a similar query like below.\n\nNote\n\n: To run this type of query, you must obtain the value of the Approved state from the instance shape. After you have the value, create a query similar to the following:\n\n&oslc.prefix=rm_property=<https://grarrc.ibm.com:9443/rm/types/>&oslc.where=rm_property:_PfIW0OrtEeGaNr-hWVrMiw=<https://grarrc.ibm.com:9443/rm/types/_PamcJOrtEeGaNr-hWVrMiw#3e9db9f1-3d5c-4716-aae0-f48d49260a8b>"
