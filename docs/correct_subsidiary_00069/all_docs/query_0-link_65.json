This means that you will need a FLEXnet license key to be able to use IBM Rational Logiscope. Depending on your type of license agreement, the license information may already have been delivered to you by e-mail. If you are a new user and this is your first license agreement, that is probably not the case.\n\nDuring installation, it is assumed that you have the license information at hand, at least hostname and port number. You may add the license information later and do not need to install again.\n\nWhat's new in version 6.6\n\nIBM Rational Logiscope RuleChecker\n\nRuleChecker supports rule checking for part of the MISRA C++:2008 coding standard, allowing organizations to comply with this industry standard.\n\nRuleChecker supports rule checking of additional rules of the MISRA C:2004 coding standard.\n\nRuleChecker now manages tool-based generated code (e.g. from IBM Rational Rhapsody), allowing to automatically skip or relax rule violations found in generated code.\n\nRuleChecker now allows to report results from other Logiscope modules as standard rule violations:\n\nOut of range metric values computed by QualityChecker\n\nCode duplications found by CodeReducer\n\nIBM Rational Logiscope QualityChecker\n\nQualityChecker further improves the accuracy of the Quality evaluation model by integrating metrics from other Logiscope modules: e.g.\n\nthe number of rule violations found by RuleChecker\n\nthe volume of similar code estimated by CodeReducer\n\nIBM Rational Logiscope CodeReducer\n\nCodeReducer now enables to keep results from several search configurations.\n\nCodeReducer introduces token highlighting in the display of similarity results.\n\nCodeReducer now provides a new KPI: the compression ratio as the percentage of code that could be removed by factorizing the similar code found.\n\nCodeReducer project creation is now simplified.\n\nCodeReducer now contains additional filters on results.\n\nCodeReducer now allows relaxing similarities found as for RuleChecker.\n\nKnown problems\n\nThe following are known issues at the time of release. Where applicable, remedies and workarounds are provided.\n\nRuleChecker - QualityChecker - CodeReducer\n\nJava\n\nPossible performance issues\n\nSymptom\n\nReduced performance may be observed in certain cases, this is related to the addition of new metrics and the call graph.\n\nRemedy\n\nDe-activating the new features will relieve the problem. This can be done by setting to OFF the callgraph and/or package contexts, and/or the Halstead metrics, in the Metrics.mst and ParserMetrics.cfg files that are in the installation directory under data/audit_java.\n\nOne Java 1.5 construct is not yet supported\n\nSymptom\n\nThe construct allowing to force the Java compiler to use a certain type when using a generic method call (not relying on the compilers type inference) isnt implemented in this release.\n\nExample\n\nidentifier.<A_Type>function_call(a,b)\n\nRemedy\n\nRefrain when possible from using this construct in the code to be analyzed. Using the construct will cause a syntax error, but will not compromise the rest of the analysis.\n\nMultiple reports of syntax errors\n\nSymptom\n\nAn error in a Java source file may result in many syntax errors being reported in the source file.\n\nRemedy\n\nOnly correct supported Java source code should be analyzed. Tracking the errors down with a compiler before submitting it to the Java analyzer should solve the problem.\n\nC\n\n#pragma once\n\nSymptom\n\n#pragma once is not interpreted by the C preprocessor.\n\nC++\n\nPossible performance issues\n\nSymptom\n\nReduced performance may be observed in certain cases, this is related to the addition of new MISRA C++ rules.\n\nRemedy\n\nDe-activating the new rules, or using only a subset will relieve the problem.\n\nAll languages\n\nThe size of the Tcl stack can be too small\n\nSymptom\n\nIn some cases the execution of some Tcl scripts can lead to a stack overflow.\n\nRemedy\n\nThe problem can be worked around by reducing the size of the project being analyzed.\n\nCrashes on Linux systems\n\nSymptom\n\nA few Logiscope crashes have been observed on the Linux platform either during or after a project build. The problem isnt frequent and doesnt entail any data loss.\n\nCodeReducer Compression Ratio is truncated\n\nSymptom\n\nThe Compression ratio in CodeReducer is given as the truncated value of the displayed division: the estimated number of lines that could be factorized over the total number of lines of the application.\n\nRemedy\n\nSpecial attention should be paid to the value when a 1% variation would be important for the project. A more accurate value can be calculated by performing the division displayed with more precision.\n\nPotential Tcl problems with long paths\n\nSymptom\n\nWhen long paths are used for the files of a project, there can be problems in the Tcl scripts used in Logiscope. In particular CodeReducer can fail to complete the analysis in this case.\n\nRemedy\n\nCopying the project to be analyzed to a directory higher up in the file tree. Moving only the Logiscope project files (without moving the source files) may be sufficient to work around the issue.\n\nEclipse integration\n\nJRE installation problem on Linux platforms\n\nSymptom\n\nOn some Linux platforms, it is possible that at plug-in startup the following message should be received:\n\n\"libhpi.so : cannot open shared object file\"\n\nRemedy\n\nThe problem can be corrected by adding to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable the directory where the file libhpi.so is located (it is part of the JRE or JDK used to run Eclipse).\n\nSystems\n\nFile systems\n\nFile rights may cause some problems\n\nSymptom\n\nOn systems writing to NTFS disks, there might be problems when attempting to overwrite files that dont have write permissions.\n\nRemedy\n\nCheck before saving that the files are write-accessible.\n\nInteraction with Clearcase\n\nReport problems can be observed\n\nSymptom\n\nOn systems where Clearcase is installed, there might be problems with report generation, such as different reports from one generation to the next.\n\nRemedy\n\nDisable \"Connect to the Source Control System at startup\" in Tools/Options, General tab.\n\nFixed problems\n\nRuleChecker\n\n4028074 - Diab dialect: sizeof with two args not supported\n\nLogiscope C now supports the Diab dialect specific sizeof operator with two arguments\n\n4023814, 3025254 - Issues with MISRA rules Misra_Rule97, MISRA19_11.

This is now solved.\n\nTestChecker\n\n7021133 - TestChecker for Ada cannot handle arrays of Boolean\n\nAn option can be activated in Ada Testchecker to evaluate whether an expression is a boolean in MCDC instrumentation. This can avoid compilation errors due to the erroneous instrumentation of boolean array expressions.\n\nTo activate this option, the line:\n\nlappend larg b\n\nshould be added in the Scripts/build/test_ada.tcl file in the installation directory, after this line:\n\nset larg [cmn_jac::getArgs $prj {-sep -a -d -t -T -i -l}]\n\nContacting Support\n\nPlease visit our support overview site at: http://www.ibm.com/software/rational/support/telelogic/\n\nYou will find a one-sheet reference guide about how to best contact support in your geography.\n\nNotices\n\nThis information was developed for products and services offered in the U.S.A.
