        "text": "#ThankfulThursday to Grady Booch for generously sharing some advice that helped me become a writer, many many years ago. When IBM acquired Rational Software in 2003, one thing I was excited about was that Grady Booch would be joining IBM. At the time I didn‚Äôt know Grady, but I certainly knew of him, as I‚Äôd intensely studied some of his books on object-oriented programming and had read many interviews with him. One day I got the courage to cold call (well, email) him and ask him if I could set up a meeting to ask for his advice on becoming a good writer. To my happy surprise (since he had no idea who I was), he responded that he‚Äôd be happy to talk to me about this. When we talked, he started by asking me WHY I wanted to write. I said that I aspired to gain a reputation as a thought-leader in the software world, like him. He said that if I wanted to do that, I should do these things well: **Focus, towards deep expertise and novel perspective** - Choose a small number of topics where you gain deep expertise, such that you produce writing with novel insights and perspective. Don‚Äôt be the hundredth person saying the same thing and don‚Äôt be someone spouting shallow/wrong stuff. **Practice, towards cogency and authenticity.** - The only way to become a good writer is by writing. Initially your writing will be less cogent and parrot the style of other writers you like. That‚Äôs a normal growing pain. But if you stick with it, and work through it, eventually you will write more cogently, and you will ‚Äúfind your voice‚Äù that‚Äôs authentically you. I listened to Grady and followed his advice. Now, twenty years later, I believe he was spot on, unsurprisingly. When I compare my present writing (e.g., in bit.ly/higgins-book ) to my early writing, the present writing is more differentiated, more coherent, and more authentic. I‚Äôve even developed a simple methodology to decide about what I should write (https://lnkd.in/evBAj9ay). I‚Äôve also found that beyond my original goal of thought-leadership, being a skilled writer is one of my most valuable tools as an executive leader, whether working with my own organization, customers, partners, or relevant communities. So, thanks Grady for that great advice way back when, but also for simply taking my call when I was a well-intentioned nobody. Since then, Grady became first a critical mentor and then a dear friend, and it all started with that first conversation about how to write well. üåü ----- About #ThankfulThursday: https://lnkd.in/gPR2k2Wu"
