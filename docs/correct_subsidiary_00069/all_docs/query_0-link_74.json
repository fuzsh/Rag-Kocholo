        "text": "Exhibit 10.5\n\nIBM OEM Software Agreement\n\nBase Agreement: 4905S10262\n\nThank you for doing business with IBM. The Agreement is our complete agreement and replaces all prior oral or written communications between us regarding the transactions described in the Transaction Documents.\n\nBy signing below for our companies, each of us agrees to the terms of this Base Agreement. When signed, each Transaction Document and the Base Agreement form a separate agreement between the parties. Once signed, 1) both parties agree any reproduction of the Agreement made by reliable means (for example, photocopy or facsimile) is considered an original and 2) all Programs are subject to it.\n\nAgreed to:\n\nAgreed to:\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation\n\nXxxxxx Software, Inc.\n\nBy:\n\nBy:\n\nName:\n\nXxxxx Xxxxxx\n\nName:\n\nTitle:\n\nContract Administrator\n\nTitle:\n\nDate:\n\nDate:\n\nIBM Address:\n\nXxxxxx Software Address:\n\n00000 Xxxxxx Xxxx\n\n000 Xx Xxxxx Xxxxxx\n\nXxxxxx, XX 00000\n\nXx. Xxxx, XX 00000\n\nAttn:\n\nOEM Software Contracts\n\nInternal Zip 0411E034\n\n1\n\nThis IBM OEM Software Agreement (Agreement) is entered into between International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and Xxxxxx Software, Inc. (you). Under this Agreement, IBM authorizes you to copy certain Programs to include in your Solution which you will market and distribute to Customers in the Territory.\n\n1.0DEFINITIONS\n\n1.1 Customer - An end user authorized to use the Solution for its intended use and not for remarketing. Customers may outsource the Solution to a third party. Customers do not include you, your parent company, subsidiaries, or any company which shares common ownership with you.\n\n1.2 Maintenance Modifications - Revisions that correct errors in Programs.\n\n1.3 Open Source Code - Any computer software program, of which (i) the human-readable program instructions (known as “source-code”) are available to the public for inspection and use by others; and (ii) the terms and conditions of the applicable license agreement permit recipients of the program freely (and without liability to pay any royalty or fee) to copy, modify and distribute the program’s source code.\n\n1.4 Programs - The IBM products listed in the Transaction Document and all whole or partial copies of them. A Program consists of machine-readable instructions, its components, data, audiovisual content (such as images, text, recordings, or pictures), and related licensed materials.\n\n1.5 Solution - The offering that is created when our Programs and your Value-Add Components work together.\n\n1.6 Value-Add Components - Your products listed in the Transaction Document that you must include in your Solution. Your Value-Add Components must add significant new functionality or combine or integrate the Program with one or more other products or services that add significant new functionality.\n\n1.7 ASP Services - The delivery and management of the Solution by Xxxxxx’x Application Service Providers, which may include Xxxxxx, to either one or multiple Customers via the Internet or a private network. ASP Services do not include the downloading or copying of Programs by Customers.\n\n2.0LICENSES AND GRANTS\n\n2.1 The Programs are owned by IBM, one of its subsidiaries, or an IBM supplier, and are copyrighted and licensed, not sold. Each party keeps title to its copyrights, patents and any other intellectual property rights in its materials.\n\n2.2 IBM will provide you one copy of each Program. IBM grants you a nontransferable, nonexclusive right to: (a) copy each Program (including all trademarks contained in the Program) to include in your Solution, (b) market and distribute the Solution to Customers subject to the terms of this Agreement, and (c) use the Programs to provide maintenance and support. You may also provide the Solution via ASP Services. You may only market such Program to Customers as part of your Solution and may not modify the Program or any proprietary notices or trademarks contained in the Program without IBM’s prior written consent.\n\n2.3 A restricted license allows you, your distributors, and your Customers to use the Programs only in conjunction with the Solution. The Transaction Document will specify the Programs to which a restricted license applies. If a restricted license applies to a Program, you must distribute such Program under your license agreement and notify your Customers that they may only use the Program as part of the Solution.\n\n2.4 If a restricted license does not apply to a Program, you may distribute such Program either under the terms of the IBM International Program License Agreement (IPLA) or under your license agreement.\n\n2.5 For both restricted and unrestricted licenses, your license agreement must restrict your Customers to substantially the same terms as\n\n2\n\nthe IPLA. You must include in your Solution any additional licensed materials and Proof of Entitlement Certificates we provide to you.\n\n2.6 You must provide all support for your Value-Add Components. The Transaction Document will specify each party’s respective responsibilities regarding support for the Programs.\n\n2.7 IBM will make available to you Maintenance Modifications released by IBM during the term of the Transaction Document. You agree to incorporate Maintenance Modifications on all Programs as soon as commercially reasonable.\n\n2.8 The territory for this Agreement is worldwide (Territory) except where prohibited by applicable laws. The Territory also excludes the following countries where IBM has exclusive dealing arrangements: Abu Dhabi, Algeria, Bahrain, Belize, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Dubai, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Kuwait, Nicaragua, Oman, Panama, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia. We may change this list on 90 days advance written notice.\n\n2.9 You may use distributors directly or indirectly to distribute the Solution to Customers in the Territory. You will ensure that anyone you authorize to use or distribute the Programs does so only in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.\n\n2.10 You may not reverse assemble, reverse compile, or otherwise translate the Program.\n\n2.11 IBM may withdraw Programs either on a temporary or permanent basis. If the withdrawal is based on an infringement claim, or if IBM no longer has the rights for the Programs, you will suspend further use and distribution of the Programs. For other withdrawals, you may continue to use and distribute the Programs as provided under this Agreement. However, support may not be available for withdrawn Programs. IBM will provide support for the Programs for three years from IBM’s general availability and will provide one years notice prior to withdrawing support from a Program.\n\n3.0PAYMENTS AND TAXES\n\n3.1 You agree to pay IBM as described in the Transaction Document. If a purchase commitment is specified in a Transaction Document, and you have not met such commitment by the end of the term of such Transaction Document, IBM may invoice you for the remaining balance.\n\n3.2 If you accept a returned Solution from your Customer and refund the amount paid, you may relicense it to another Customer without additional fee to IBM.\n\n3.3 If any authority imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee, excluding those based on IBM’s net income, upon the Program supplied by IBM under this Agreement, then you agree to pay that amount or supply exemption documentation.\n\n3.4 For two years, you will maintain relevant records to support payments made to IBM and to show you have otherwise complied with the Agreement. Upon at least five days advance written request from IBM, you will make such records available to IBM or an independent auditor chosen and compensated by IBM. Such audits will be conducted during normal business hours on your premises and will not occur more than once each year. The auditor will sign a confidentiality agreement and will only disclose to IBM any amounts due and payable for the period examined. The auditor will follow such security and other procedures as directed by you. If an audit discovers that you underpaid IBM, you will pay the amount due plus interest from date payment was due. The interest rate is the lower of 2% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law. If you have underpaid IBM by more than 5%, you will also reimburse IBM for all expenses associated with the audit.\n\n3.5 In order for you to perform your responsibilities under this Agreement, you may license the Programs for development, testing, demonstration, and support purposes, at the prices specified in the Transaction Document. At any time during the course of this Agreement, or after its expiration, you may license the Programs for internal use at prices and terms negotiated between the parties. The terms of this Agreement shall not apply to that transaction and IBM will not credit any payments under this Agreement towards such license fees.\n\n4.0WARRANTY AND INDEMNIFICATION\n\n4.1 IBM warrants that when the Program is used in the specified operating environment it will conform to its specifications. IBM does not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Program or that IBM will correct all non-material Program defects. IBM is not responsible for the results obtained from the use of the Program.\n\n4.2 IBM DOES NOT WARRANT TO YOU THAT THE PROGRAMS OR YOUR SOLUTIONS WILL MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF YOU,\n\n3\n\nYOUR DISTRIBUTORS OR CUSTOMERS. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THE AGREEMENT, IBM PROVIDES THE PROGRAMS TO YOU “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY. IBM DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n4.3 If a third party claims that a Program as furnished by IBM infringes a patent or copyright, IBM will indemnify you against that claim at IBM’s expense. If an infringement claim appears likely, or is made about a Program, you will let IBM, a) modify or replace it with similar functionality, or b) obtain the necessary rights for you to continue to exercise your license under this Agreement. If IBM concludes that neither of these alternatives is reasonably available, you will return or destroy the Programs in your possession on IBM’s written request. IBM will have no obligation to indemnify you for any claim based on 1) third-party code, including but not limited to, Open Source Code, or 2) your modification of the Program, or 3) the combination, operation, or use of the Program with any product, data, or apparatus that IBM did not provide.\n\n4.4 If a third party makes a claim against IBM based on your representations not authorized by IBM or based on your breach under this Agreement, you will indemnify IBM against that claim at your expense.\n\n4.5 The indemnifying party will pay any settlement amounts it authorizes and all costs, damages and reasonable attorneys’ fees that a court finally awards if the other party a) promptly provides the indemnifying party with written notice of the claim, and b) allows the indemnifying party to control, and cooperates with it in, the defense of the claim and settlement negotiations. The indemnifying party will not agree to any settlement that materially prejudices the other party. The other party may participate in the proceedings at its option and expense.\n\n5.0LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n\n5.1 Circumstances may arise where, because of a breach or other liability, one party may recover damages from the other. For all claims brought under this Agreement, regardless of the basis on which the claim is made (including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract or tort claim), each party will only be liable for 1) damages for bodily injury (including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property and 2) the amount of any other actual direct damages up to the greater of US $500,000 or the payments made to IBM for the Program that is the subject of the claim. This Limitation of Liability shall not apply to any amounts due IBM under this Agreement, or to any claim based on the Indemnification section, or to any breach of either party’s intellectual property rights.\n\n5.2 Under this Agreement, neither party will be liable for any special, incidental, or indirect damages or for any economic consequential damages (including lost profits or savings), even if it has been advised of the possibility of such damages. IBM is not responsible for damages arising from or related to the use of the Programs outside of the Territory.\n\n6.0TERM AND TERMINATION\n\n6.1 This Agreement and your license rights granted under it remain in effect as long as there is a valid Transaction Document. We may add additional Transaction Documents as mutually agreed. Termination or expiration of the Agreement or any Transaction Document does not affect previously granted paid-up licenses to Customers or any licenses granted to you under any other Agreements.\n\n6.2 IBM may terminate this Agreement and any Transaction Document on written notice if you market Programs not in connection with the Solution or if you violate IBM’s intellectual property rights and fail to cure such breach within seven business days after receipt of written notice from IBM demanding its cure and identifying the breach. If you market Programs separately from the Solution, as IBM’s sole remedy, you agree to pay IBM the difference between the price you paid IBM for the Programs and our suggested retail price for the Programs. IBM may have other remedies under the law and the Agreement.\n\n6.3 Either party may terminate this Agreement or a Transaction Document on 60 days’ written notice if the other party fails to comply with a material term of this Agreement or a Transaction Document, unless such failure is cured within the 60 day notice period.\n\n6.4 You may terminate this Agreement, without cause on 90 days written notice.\n\n6.5 Upon termination or expiration, you must return all copies of the Programs to IBM, except that you may keep one copy for archival, litigation, audit, dispute resolution, and support purposes. Any terms of this\n\n4\n\nAgreement which by their nature extend beyond the Agreement termination or expiration remain in effect until fulfilled.\n\n7.0GENERAL\n\n7.1 Each party is an independent contractor. Neither party is, nor will claim to be, a legal representative, partner, franchisee, agent or employee of the other, except as specifically stated in this Agreement. Neither party will assume or create obligations for the other. Except as provided in the Indemnification Section above, each party shall pay (without reimbursement) its own legal fees and expenses incurred in any dispute.\n\n7.2 Each party may have similar agreements with others and may design, develop, manufacture, acquire or market products and services that are competitive with the other. You will independently establish prices and terms for the Solution, provided your terms include those required by this Agreement.\n\n7.3 Each party agrees to comply with all applicable laws and regulations including export laws.\n\n7.4 Each party will identify coordinators who will represent us for various aspects of this Agreement and will notify the other party if the coordinators change.\n\n7.5 Both parties will act in good faith to resolve disputes. Neither party will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than two years after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its right to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\n\n7.6 Except as expressly stated herein, this Agreement does not grant you any rights in any IBM patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, or service marks.\n\n7.7 Neither party is responsible for failure to fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its control.\n\n7.8 Except to the extent provided herein, you may not assign or transfer the Agreement or your rights under it or delegate or subcontract your obligations without IBM’s prior written approval, except to a parent or subsidiary, or to a successor organization by merger, consolidation or a sale of substantially all the assets or an operating division. Any other attempt to do so is void. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors, assigns and trustees\n\n7.9 You agree to allow International Business Machines Corporation and its subsidiaries to store and use your business contact information, including names, business phone numbers, and business e-mail addresses, anywhere they do business. Such information will be processed and used only in connection with our business relationship, and may be provided to contractors acting on IBM’s behalf, IBM business partners who promote, market and support certain IBM products and services, and assignees of International Business Machines Corporation and its subsidiaries for uses consistent with our business relationship.\n\n7.10 All information exchanged is non-confidential. Where confidential information must be exchanged, it will be done under a signed confidentiality agreement. However, you will not disclose the terms of the Agreement to a third party except a) to your accountants, lawyers or other professional advisors under a confidentiality agreement or b) as required by law, provided you get all available confidential treatment for them.\n\n7.11 The laws of the state of New York govern this Agreement. The “United Nations Convention on International Sale of Goods” does not apply.\n\n7.12 In case of conflict, terms of the Transaction Document prevail over terms of the Base Agreement.\n\n5\n\nIBM OEM Software Agreement: 4905S10262\n\nPercent of Revenue Transaction Document – Number 01\n\nThank you for doing business with IBM.
