        "text": "Partnerships can work. During my time at OpenText, one of my most impressive learnings was genuinely participating in the SAP partnership, a 350M Euro business ( at the time ) of twelve apps sold through SAP. In my many years in this space, the SAP - OpenText Text partnership/alliance is the gold standard. It has weathered the test of time that breaks up many partnerships, and this one is proven and built for the long haul. My challenge then was getting to know the SAP leadership and building credibility so that little old OT could provide more value to them and predictable revenue for us. Next was building our sales ability and delivering as a partner. We couldn‚Äôt sit around and wait for them to do our work for us, and at the same time, we didn‚Äôt want to disrupt their sales force ( they could steamroll us ), but we had to make numbers. It was a tricky balance to sell our stuff directly to prove our value to the customer and the SAP sales force. As a sales force, we wanted to get better and better, but that also required us to share and be transparent as we got better. There were many times when our sales team had proven value and wanted to go solo, but we couldn‚Äôt, and if we truly earned it, we had to talk about it with them and not hide it. We needed to demonstrate improved value to the customers and establish and demonstrate value to our massive partner. We needed to gain the respect of legends like Jennifer Morgan, Adaire Fox-Martin, Robert Enslin, Kevin Ichhpurani, and many other world-class sales leaders. It‚Äôs easy to feel so inferior, so much smaller that you don‚Äôt try, but we knew we needed to improve to be a great partner. We needed to hold our own and push back if we didn‚Äôt feel we were being treated fairly and follow their lead most of the time. The test of this partnership is when you are at risk of missing a quarter or a big deal, and we need the \"Irish kitchen\" (brutal honesty) conversations with your partner to figure it out. üòÖ The moral of the story? Partnerships can work, but with this caveat: select them wisely‚Äîthe fewer, the better. Stay connected, provide value, and commit to the long haul while always being transparent. No one goes through life alone.\n\nThis this quote is ridiculously dysfunctional, this statement is the root of addiction, people pleasing, emptiness, horrible parenting, workaholics, low self-esteem and pure sadness with the constant reminder that we are never ever good enough üòû And I do believe it is rampant in the sales world ‚Ä¶when you ask people how much ? what‚Äôs your number ? I rarely find people with a number üßêWhen I ask when you hit your quota and make that $1 million what are you gonna do with it? Most common answer I don‚Äôt know ? Or more stuff another house golf club membership etc ‚Ä¶ Please have your number and the number can be big, but have your why behind it. Have a plan of what you‚Äôre gonna do with all that money and when you hit it you will know it was enough üòÉ\n\nThis post is part of my Forrest Gump series, which are posts that I have historically assumed everybody knows. Then, through observation, experience, and coaching, I continue to learn ‚Ä¶nope, not everyone knows this; therefore, it must be said repeatedly. Managers, your power lies in praising in public, and then you coach, correct, and give constructive criticism in private. 1. If your entire team is failing, that is on you, your plan design, and your leadership. 2. When you blast everyone, the A players don‚Äôt know you are not talking to them, and you will lose them immediately. ( and telling them privately later doesn't work.) 3. Your job is to increase productivity, and this is achieved by showing respect for people, establishing safety, and getting underachievers to achieve more, not venting. Sincerely Forrest üòä"
