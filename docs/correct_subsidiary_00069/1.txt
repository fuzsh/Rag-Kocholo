2.1 Hardware requirements

There are no additional processor or memory requirements for installing this fix pack. However, there might be additional disk space requirements if you install the fix pack at the same time that you install IBM Rational Developer for System i, Version 7.1, or if you are installing the fix pack as an update:

If you install the fix pack at the same time that you install IBM Rational Developer for System i, Version 7.1, the disk space requirements are essentially the same as for Version 7.1.

If you are installing the fix pack as an update, you might need up to an additional 200 MB of disk space. Your actual disk space requirements depend on the features that you selected when you installed Version 7.1 of the product.

If you choose to download the update as a compressed file for local installation, approximately 300 MB is required to store and extract the compressed file.

2.2 Software requirements

This section describes the additional software requirements for installing IBM Rational Developer for System i, Version 7.1.0.3. For more information about the requirements for installing IBM Rational Developer for System i, Version 7.1, see the Installation Guide.

Before installing this fix pack, you must install IBM Installation Manager, Version 1.2.1.

By default, the update is located and installed by Installation Manager directly from the IBM update repository for IBM Rational Developer for System i, Version 7.1.0.3.

Important: When IBM Rational Developer for System i is installed, the location of its update repository is automatically embedded in Installation Manager. For Installation Manager to search the default update repository, the preference Search the linked repositories during installation and updates must be selected on the Repositories preference page. This preference is selected by default.

To install the fix pack from a different repository location (for example, if the fix pack is available on a shared drive or HTTP or HTTPS server), you must add the repository location in Installation Manager. To add a repository location, perform the following steps:

3.0 Fixes contained in this fix pack

For all IBM Rational Developer for System i, V7.1.0.3 APARs, go to the IBM Rational Developer for System i Support Search page at the following address:

http://www.ibm.com/software/awdtools/rdi/support/search.html

Select the APARs option and enter the desired search terms (such as 7.1.0.3 for APARs related to this fix pack). You can also create a custom search of the Support database.

The following corrections have been included in this fix pack.

SE34362: When a connection is initially offline, and syntax checking is called on a CLLE member, after being prompted to connect, the syntax checking doesn't work (i.e. doesn't display any errors).

SE29469: The cursor is not being positioned where it is expected when the Signature function is turned on.

SE33608: The Show Indent view for RPGLE source does not correctly present the indentation levels when continuation lines of statements start with certain indentation-changing keywords (e.g. a SELECT keywork within an EXEC SQL statement).

SE33925: When editing CLLE source, the cursor misbehaves when moved from a line containing an "END" token (e.g. ENDDO, ENDSELECT) to a different line, using the keyboard arrows or the mouse.

SE33976: If the Source -> Verify function is performed on a DDS source member that references fields from a DDM file which links to a remote file, the function returns with errors.

SE34379: The Java Method Call Wizard fails to generate source code when any source line in the file from the start of the file to the current line the wizard was invoked at is a line which ends at column 10 or 14.

SE34300: If a connection is initially offline, and the command ADDJOBSCDE is prompted in a CLP source member, entering a valid time with a separator (e.g. 11:00) causes an error to be displayed at the bottom of the prompt screen.

SE34539: After the customer adds a compile command extension into the plugin.xml using the extension point "com.ibm.etools.systems.core.compile", the custom compile command can be shown in RSE but not in iSeries Projects.

SE34205: Remote System Explorer won't work with job CCSID 65535.

SE34837: The EVFEVENT file is created with maximum 1 member when FNDSTRPDM is called from RDi, which prevents RDi from compiling because it is unable to add the source member to the EVFEVENT file.

SE32079: When using CCSID 5026, batch compilation of members in the RSE view does not result in a program (or module) being created. Commands Log shows the command as normally completed, and there are no error messages.

SE35686: When a web service wizard is called on RPGLE source that contains data structures with packed decimals (p), the generated java code (using direct program call) uses the class java.math.BigDecimal without the corresponding import statement.

SE35497: OutLine View shows EXTFLD instead of field names in Data Structure with externally defined fields.

SE34090: RDi can not start with the argument -nl de_DE (German) with ORG.OSGI.FRAMEWORK.BUNDLE EXCEPTION

If the Program Call Wizard is launched without selecting a Java project first, and then a program or a pcml file is imported, the OK button and the Next button in the Program call "definitions" page will be disabled.
