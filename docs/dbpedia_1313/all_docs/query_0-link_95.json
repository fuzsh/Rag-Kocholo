        "text": "I could be wrong, but I think Stone Yard Devotional will test the loyalty of some of Charlotte Wood’s more recent fans. I found it compulsive reading, and read on through the night, but though the preoccupation with human frailty in Stone Yard Devotional is there in her earlier work too, this novel is a departure from Wood’s most recent fiction. There are no angry strident feminists as in The Natural Way of Things (2015), and her central character has deliberately jettisoned the succour of female friendship among older women that we saw tested in The Weekend (2019). Stone Yard Devotional (2023) is about a middle-aged woman alone and struggling with existential questions about goodness, forgiveness, hope and despair.\n\nIndeed, this meditation on the life that’s been lived reads more like an extended examination of conscience than anything else.\n\nCatholics define examination of conscience as a process…\n\n…to help call to mind our sins and failings during a period of quiet reflection before approaching the Priest in Confession. (Bulldog Catholic, viewed 3/11/23)\n\nAnd although the central, unnamed narrator asserts her atheism from time to time, and there’s certainly no mention of the Catholic ritual of confession in the novel, the preoccupation with wrongs done to others and the regrets she feels about her sins and failings seem quasi-religious to me.\n\nOf course, that’s not to say that non-believers don’t engage in similar kinds of self-reflection. Most religious rites derive from rituals and ceremonies that humans do anyway.\n\nThis woman takes time out from her failed marriage and her busy life as a some kind of administrator for environmental concerns, to spend a week in solitude in a religious community on the Monaro. This small community of nuns ekes out an income by taking in guests who need a temporary escape to a life of simplicity, routine and peace. This is no ‘wellness centre’ with gourmet healthy meals, massage and luxury accommodation. What appeals to her is the solitude, the silence and the opportunity to reflect on her life without distraction. She decides to make this place her refuge and she joins the community. Not as a nun, but as a secular conventual oblate i.e. a committed volunteer in the service of the community, abiding by its rules but not necessarily sharing its religious beliefs.\n\nThe reader is given little or nothing in the way of a back story. We soon learn that she is grieving the death of her mother from some time ago, but we don’t know why her relationship with Alex has failed, and we assume there are no children. We know very little about her friends except that they are hurt by her abandonment. The activist community from which she has summarily withdrawn is bereft as well. They do not understand, and she makes no attempt to explain, merely unsubscribing from everything.\n\nThe last thing I did on email before coming here for good was scroll and click.

(p.152)\n\nDespite this disconnection from people and causes that she had obviously held dear, her retreat to a spare, monastic life can still be disturbed. The blurb alerts the reader to three visitations — an ambiguous term which can mean an event in which God or another non-human being seems to appear; or it can mean the act of officially visiting someone, often before a funeral where the body can be viewed. The first visitation, as indicated by the blurb, certainly has biblical connotations. Depending on what you find in your Google search, there are seven, or ten, biblical plagues. Time Magazine explains that the ten ancient plagues of Egypt represent the fullness of God’s expression of justice and judgments, upon those who refuse to repent. (Underlining mine).\n\nDisquiet interrupts this secluded life with three visitations. First comes a terrible mouse plague, each day signalling a new battle against the rising infestation.\n\nSecond is the return of the skeletal remains of a sister who left the community decades before to minister to deprived women in Thailand – then disappeared, presumed murdered.\n\nFinally, a troubling visitor to the monastery pulls the narrator further back into her past.\n\nThe second visitation is an allusion to an act of violence against women, and the last, the troubling visitor, turns out to be Helen Parry i.e. the subject of the Helen Parry Legal Defence Fund to which the narrator has been contributing. Alone among that long list of Worthy Causes, it is one that has personal baggage for the narrator.\n\nThe narrator is deeply troubled by her memories of failure, especially by the guilt she feels about the way she and other teenage monsters treated Helen Parry at school. But she is also peeved by the way Helen Parry has intruded on the peace of the community. These events coincide with Covid’s closed borders, and the community has only been able to repatriate Sister Jenny because Helen Parry — by now an activist with a powerful international profile — has escorted the remains back to Australia, but then finds herself marooned with the nuns because of lockdowns. While everyone else has left the world behind, Helen Parry is having zoom conferences on her phone.\n\nNotice in this excerpt how the narrator asserts an unspoken fear as if she is somehow able to discern without anyone else expressing them, resentful attitudes that coalesce with hers. It signals that the narrator is not entirely reliable and not entirely self-aware:\n\nThere is also an unspoken fear that Helen Parry will one day leave her guest cabin and take up space here in our quarters. But for now she sits in the paddock with her phone at her ear and we try not to feel her watching us going into the church and out of it, into it and out of it. (p.153)\n\nThe juxtaposition of the next paragraph conveys the sensitivity that the narrator has for Sister Bonaventure compared to her judgementalism about Helen Parry.\n\n[Sister] Bonaventure spends long hours in the room with the bones, lighting a candle every time. You can tell when she’s been in there because the scent of beeswax and struck match hangs in the corridors. I think she is mourning not only Sister Jenny but something in herself. Some secret, wrestling work is taking place, and I feel pity for her lonely labour. (p.153)\n\nIt turns out that the narrator is not only wrong about Helen Parry’s presence, but that this supposition about Sister Jenny’s feelings is also a misjudgement — one which raises the question of forgiveness. Can one come to terms with moral failings when forgiveness is not forthcoming? It is hard enough when those who’ve been wronged are dead, but what if they are alive and indifferent to this human need to be reconciled?\n\nAfter I had read the book and written most of this review, I read Imogen Dewey’s interview with the author in The Guardian which revealed that Charlotte Wood has had a serious health scare, and that thoughts of mortality had impacted on her view of the world: “It was like I had acid poured on my whole life, and only the essential things remained.”\n\nThe narrator of her new novel is a woman in political retreat, grappling with her own “vision of failure” to affect change. Stone Yard Devotional is Wood’s 10th book, more acutely personal than her previous work. “I’m less and less certain, the older I get, about how to do the right thing,” she says. “I understand the appeal of running away.” […] “I find it easy to fall into despair, to be honest … But I don’t want to be despairing in my work.”\n\nThe Guardian also has Fiona Wright’s review of Stone Yard Devotional but… she characterises it as a book of introspection – and of despair, and I don’t agree with that. I think the novel does interrogate despair, but the concluding words signify acceptance.\n\nMy mother said that anything that had once been alive should go back into the soil. Food scraps went into the compost, of course, including meat and bones, despite the general advice against this. Paper, torn into strips to allow air and microbes to move freely through. She would cut old pure cotton or silk or woollen clothes into small shreds and compost them too. Fish bones and flesh. Linen tea towels. She reluctantly left out larger pieces of wood, but longed for a woodchipper. She left cane furniture to rot and then buried it. She quoted a Buckingham Palace gardener she had once seen on television, who added leather boots to his compost bin. All that was needed was time, and nature. Anything that had lived could make itself useful, become nourishment in death, my mother said.\n\nI never knew anyone else who had her reverence for the earth itself.
