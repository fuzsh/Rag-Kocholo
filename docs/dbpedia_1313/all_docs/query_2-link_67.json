        "text": "I recently did a reel on all my platforms explaining that as a prophet, there is absolutely a place for judgment that includes correction, rebuke, and exposure. This is a portion of the governance that is inextricably connected to the office of the prophet. HOWEVER, if you don’t also have a ministry of reconciliation and restoration along with your “ministry of judgment,” then you DO NOT have the heart of the Father.\n\nAs I’m reading through the Old Testament, I came across a familiar story, the story of Michal. Now you might say, “Who’s Michal? Don’t you mean “Michael, the archangel?” No, I mean Michal, the younger daughter of King Saul. Michal is presented as more of a secondary character in the lives of Saul and David. However, when I read her story recently, I was struck at how so many of us women are also Michal.\n\nJezebel. You think you know her, but you have no idea. We often say “she” is the young woman busy enticing men from their wives. We’re so quick to remember the one verse in all of Scripture detailing that Jezebel painted her eyes in II Kings 9:30, that we forget how she actually operates in full. In fact, most could not even provide a full, accurate description of her “harlotries.”\n\nScripture tells us that it is appointed unto man to die ONCE, and then the judgment (Heb. 9:27). Therefore, no one who passes out of this life into the next may return to us--in any form. (We are not talking here of normal dreams about someone, although if you have a sexual dream about someone you may very well want to examine the root of it and deal with it as Jehovah leads.) I have said before that there is only one example in Scripture of a dead person returning, but I was wrong. There are two: The first, is when God allowed the witch of En Dor, a medium (necromancer), to call up the dead prophet Samuel who was resting in Abraham’s Bosom, where all the Saints went before Paradise (Heaven) was opened to us through Jesus’ power and resurrection.\n\nLast night, I was scrolling through a Christian debate group on I belong to on Facebook when I stumbled across a clip someone shared featuring Pastor Dharius Daniels. I was BLOWN AWAY!!! Generally speaking, I’ve heard and now seen that the man is a BEAST! This clip absolutely proved it. He walks us through the generational “habit” of lying in the family of Abraham reaching the fourth generation, Jacob’s sons (minus Joseph and Benjamin). He mentioned how we so readily focus on generational curses in families, but rarely do we look at this same concept in the context of churches. My Lord! And it’s the truth! Generational curses in the Church are a very real problem, but as Jesus said, the truth shall set you free! Let’s dig in.\n\nWe’ve met Baal and Asherah (the Queen of Heaven), the “parents” of Jezebel. And we’ve met two of Jezebels’ personalities, Delilah and Herod. And now, we will meet this demonic prince’s third, most closely associated personality: Absalom. When blogging about how I fell prey to Jezebel and even in my last post, I shared with you that Jezebel is not born, she’s made. Looking into the story of Absalom gives us a very good idea of just that.\n\nOn this the Feast of Purim, we remember the mighty deliverance of Jehovah against the enemies of Israel in the Medo-Persian Empire during the reign of Ahasuerus/Xerxes I (485–464 b.c.). We remember how Haman, the lead prince (advisor) of the king, schemed because of his hatred of Mordecai the Jew who sat in the king’s gates, to kill not just him, but ALL of the Jewish people throughout the ENTIRE empire. You may read the account here.\n\nYou may be thinking a lot about witches right now. Hocus Pocus, Harry Potter, and all that jazz. I mean, Halloween is less than a week away.\n\nSome of you may not believe in actual witches. (Even though they really do exist.)\n\nSome of you may not believe in the power actual witches utilize. (Even though it’s very real.)\n\nSome of you may believe that the power actual witches utilize can’t affect you because you’re a child of God. (In which case, you are more than likely very arrogantly, ignorantly wrong.)\n\nAnd some of you may actually know the truth of these matters."
