        "text": "James Morgan \"Jimmy\" McGill, better known by his professional alias and business moniker Saul Goodman and later Gene Takavic, is an American criminal defense lawyer, scam artist, and convicted criminal who is serving an 86-year sentence at ADX Montrose. Originally from Cicero, Illinois during his career as a scam artist, Jimmy moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico where he worked as a lawyer, and later resided as a fugitive in Omaha, Nebraska before being caught and apprehended in a federal prison at Montrose, Colorado. During his law career, Jimmy embraced his tendencies as a former scam artist and, after becoming a dedicated and effective criminal lawyer, he began to represent criminals while he himself became increasingly involved in the city's criminal underworld, all the while slowly losing his morality along the way. Despite his flamboyant appearance and mannerisms, Saul was a highly competent lawyer who was able to solve problems and find loopholes in order to protect his clients. His business name, \"Saul Goodman,\" is a play on the phrase \"it's all good, man.\"\n\nDressing in flashy suits, Jimmy is the younger brother of fellow lawyer Chuck McGill and the ex-husband of former attorney Kim Wexler, the latter of whom helped inspire Jimmy to pursue his own law career alongside Chuck, and had dated for several years before their six-month marriage. Jimmy began his law career as an earnest lawyer, starting out practicing public defense and elder law before becoming a criminal defense lawyer. Before this, Jimmy was a low-level reprobate in his home-town of Cicero with no serious ambitions or direction in life, wasting away his days with debauchery, bar tricks and small-time scams with his buddy Marco. Jimmy hit rock bottom when a particularly sordid incident led to his arrest, but a dismayed Chuck was able to get him off the hook for all the charges. Faced with serious consequences for once, this was to be a major turning point for Jimmy, after which he decided to clean up his act and move to Albuquerque to take up honest work at his brother's firm. He originally worked as a mailroom clerk at Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM) alongside Kim. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the partners, Jimmy studied via correspondence courses, gained a law degree from a diploma mill and eventually qualified as a lawyer. Jimmy then immediately applied for but was denied a position as an Associate attorney at the firm by Chuck and his partner Howard Hamlin. As a result, Jimmy quit HHM to set out on his own as a solo practitioner, working from a tiny makeshift office in the back room of a nail salon. After toiling for a long time on thankless public defender work, dead end cases and will-writing, Jimmy got his first big break with a class-action lawsuit against a retirement home chain. Jimmy worked together to build the increasingly complex Sandpiper case with Chuck, who persuaded him to refer the case out to HHM. For a second time Jimmy pushed for the chance to work for HHM and was again blocked by Chuck. Incensed, Jimmy resolved to burn the case to the ground rather than give it to HHM, and considered quitting the law altogether and returning to his old ways. However, after the sudden death of Marco, Jimmy was brought back to the fold by Kim, who persuaded Howard to recommend Jimmy for a job as an associate attorney at Davis & Main, HHM's co-counsel on the Sandpiper case, which Jimmy reluctantly accepts. Jimmy stubbornly rebelled against the corporate culture at the firm, clashing with the partners and was eventually fired by Clifford Main. Jimmy then established his own law firms; first with Kim at Wexler McGill and later establishing Saul Goodman & Associates. Jimmy was devastated by Chuck's revelation that he greatly resented his brother and believed him to be completely unfit to be a lawyer, which led to Chuck preventing Jimmy from being hired by HHM, later proceeding to create a majority of the obstacles Jimmy faces early on in his career, beginning Jimmy's rivalry with Howard, and causing Chuck to become unintentionally largely responsible for turning Jimmy into the criminally-inclined lawyer that he later becomes.\n\nJimmy is successful at exposing Chuck's resentment of him in court along with suggesting that he might have a mental illness, though is suspended from practice law for a year after Jimmy fabricated Mesa Verde Bank and Trust documents. During his suspension from practicing law, Jimmy worked as a cell phone salesman at CC Mobile, where he began to use the nickname \"Saul Goodman\" again. Jimmy initially used it as an alias while performing scams alongside his close friend Marco Pasternak, and later makes use of it as the alternate identity for the high-energy pitchman in television ads he produced with his film crew at Saul Goodman Productions, and when he began a business reselling prepaid cell phones on the street. Jimmy then decided to practice law under this name, believing the McGill name was buried and not wanting to be seen as \"Chuck's loser brother\". During the period of his law license suspension, Jimmy's side business caused him to inadvertently become involved in the Albuquerque drug business as an associate of Mike Ehrmantraut and a legal representative for Lalo Salamanca, with Jimmy subsequently receiving a lot more criminals seeking his services as a result of him being Lalo's lawyer.\n\nJimmy and Kim got married in 2004, with Kim also becoming Jimmy's confidant to gain spousal privilege. Despite Jimmy and Kim's unconditional love for each other, Kim left him and Albuquerque after one of their schemes goes horribly wrong, stating that they are bad for everyone around them, with the couple divorcing later that year. Following Kim's departure, Jimmy began to fully embrace his criminal Saul Goodman persona as a coping mechanism, fully immersing himself in his work and criminal activity. Saul became a local celebrity in Albuquerque through his flamboyant advertisements for his services on television through commercials, and began to maintain extensive connections within the criminal underworld, serving as a go-between connecting drug distributors and other criminals-for-hire. He was also reluctant to be associated with violence or murder unless absolutely necessary. In 2010, after his association with Walter White's drug empire was revealed to the public, Saul was forced to retire from his law career, going into hiding in Omaha for several months, living as a fugitive under the alias of \"Gene Takavic\", a manager of a Cinnabon in Omaha. He was eventually caught by the authorities and imprisoned for 86 years in a federal prison after finally accepting himself as Jimmy McGill, and began enjoying notoriety among his fellow inmates for his past life as Saul.\n\nWarning, the following may contain spoilers.\n\nBorn in Cicero, Illinois, Jimmy is the younger brother of Chuck. While his older brother became a successful lawyer as one of the name partners at HHM, Jimmy stayed in Cicero and made his living as a con artist alongside Marco, with Jimmy earning the nickname \"Slippin' Jimmy\" for staging \"slip and fall\" accidents to make quick cash. He also used the \"Saul Goodman\" alias for the first time during his scams with Marco. After defecting through a guy's sunroof, Jimmy eventually ran into trouble with the police and Chuck returned to help, but only on the condition that Jimmy move to Albuquerque and work a legitimate job in HHM's mailroom. There, Jimmy befriended and later began dating Kim Wexler, an HHM employee who is attending law school. Inspired by her success, Jimmy completed his own college degree and attended a correspondence law school. He passed the bar exam and hoped to be hired at HHM, but at Chuck's secret instigation, he was denied the opportunity by senior partner Howard, who would become Jimmy's nemesis. Jimmy then launched a solo practice in the utility room of a Vietnamese nail salon, often taking low-paying work as a public defender. In 2003, Jimmy was suspended from practicing law for one year due to his older brother Chuck, who frequently thought that Jimmy was completely unfit to be a lawyer, secretly recording a conversation on a tape in which Jimmy admitted to fabricating Mesa Verde documents. Chuck would later commit suicide by setting fire to his house after he was forced to retire from HHM early, and after his bitter resentment towards Jimmy was exposed in court during Jimmy's bar hearing.\n\nIn 2004, following Chuck's death, Jimmy decides to not practice under his own name anymore, believing Jimmy to always be seen as \"Chuck's loser brother\". He begins to use the alias \"Saul Goodman\", a play on the phrase \"(It)'s all good, man\". He initially uses it as the alternate identity for the high-energy pitchman in TV ads, and later when he begins a business reselling prepaid cell phones on the street. Through Nacho Varga and Lalo Salamanca, Jimmy became a \"friend of the Cartel', becoming increasingly involved in the criminal underworld. Jimmy and Kim also begin plotting against Howard, after Kim proposes to Jimmy that they do so so that they obtain Jimmy's share of the multi-million dollar settlement from the Sandpiper Crossing lawsuit sooner by gaslighting Howard at a mediation hearing to force an early settlement. Jimmy and Kim's elaborate sabotage plan succeeds, Howard is humiliated in front of his clients and peers, and the Sandpiper case is settled at a price lower than originally hoped for by the plaintiff's legal counsel. Howard, facing personal ruin as a result of the embarrassing fiasco, pieces together the whole plot and arrives seemingly inebriated at Kim's apartment to confront her and Jimmy. Lalo arrives soon afterwards, intending to interrogate Jimmy and Kim. Howard disregards Jimmy and Kim's panicked entreaties to leave immediately, and Lalo casually kills Howard with a gunshot to the head, to the utter horror of Kim and Jimmy. Lalo gives Jimmy the description of a man and instructs him to drive to his house and shoot him; Jimmy convinces Lalo to send Kim instead, as a ploy to get her away from Lalo. Jimmy is restrained and gagged by Lalo, who leaves the house in Jimmy's car and is later killed by Gustavo Fring during a gunfight with him. Mike and his men arrive at the apartment and free Jimmy. Kim is reunited with him the following morning, and Howard's death is staged as a suicide by Mike and his men.\n\nDespite Jimmy’s want to move past the experience, Kim eventually decides to quit being a lawyer, divorce Jimmy and leave town, believing that as long as they stay together, more and more despair will happen. Because of this, Jimmy decides to fully embrace his “Saul Goodman” identity, believing that he now has nothing left to lose. In 2008, Saul becomes the lawyer and personal advisor for meth cooks Walter White and Jesse Pinkman, getting them out of several difficult situations. He arranges for Walt to launder drug money through Walter Jr.'s website and dispatches Mike to coach Jesse and dispose of any incriminating evidence in his apartment after his girlfriend, Jane Margolis, dies of an overdose. Saul becomes a trusted consigliere in Walt's meth operation, helping launder drug money for Walt and, later, his wife Skyler. Saul expands Walt's profits by arranging for the latter to supply crystal meth in bulk to Albuquerque drug dealers via Mike, who was himself a consigliere to local kingpin Gus. Saul was an indispensable part of Walt's empire, keeping Walt out of jail, helping Walt to launder his money, lying and conspiring with him, and making millions of dollars. However, Walt's secrets are eventually discovered by his brother-in-law, DEA agent Hank Schrader, and despite attempts to protect him from arrest and Jesse's wrath after he discovered Walt's poisoning of Brock Cantillo, Saul is forced to abandon his life as a criminal lawyer.\n\nWith the help of the criminal extractor Ed Galbraith, Saul flees to Omaha, Nebraska, and begins a new life as \"Gene Takavic\", the manager of a Cinnabon restaurant. He spent years afterward living in constant fear of exposure and arrest, as well as regret over losing his past life, while being paranoid that someone from his past might identify him. When Jeff identified Gene as Saul, Gene fixed this problem by getting Jeff to commit a crime in return for Jeff not bothering him again. Energized by the con's success, Gene begins to enjoy his life more than he did before. However, this enjoyment is quickly ruined by the revelation that all of his hidden assets have been seized by the DEA who continue to hunt for him, causing Gene to return to a life of crime in order to make more money with the help of Jeff and Buddy. However, Gene's new life would eventually be exposed when Jeff was arrested while Gene was robbing a mark's house. Jeff's mother Marion ended up deducing Gene's true identity from old Saul Goodman commercials online, and reporting him to the police, forcing Jimmy to abandon his life as Gene and attempt to go on the run once again. Jimmy was quickly caught and charged with numerous felonies. After initally negotiating a plea deal for only seven and a half years in prison, he comes clean about his role in Walt's drug empire and his role in the deaths of his brother and Howard. He was imprisoned for 86 years in a federal prison, but after finally accepting himself as Jimmy McGill and atoning for his role in the deaths of Chuck, Howard, and others.\n\nQuick Answers\n\nWhat is Jimmy McGill's professional alias?\n\nSaul Goodman\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhere is Jimmy McGill serving his sentence?\n\nADX Montrose\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhere is Jimmy McGill originally from?\n\nCicero, Illinois\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhere did Jimmy McGill work as a lawyer?\n\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhere did Jimmy McGill reside as a fugitive?\n\nOmaha, Nebraska\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nHistory\n\nBackground and early life\n\nJames Morgan McGill was born on November 12, 1960, to Ruth and Charles McGill Sr in Cicero, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. He had one older brother, Charles \"Chuck\" McGill Jr. Charles Senior owned a small Corner Store in the town, but was also naive. As a young boy Jimmy worked in the store and watched as scam artists repeatedly exploited his father's good nature and fleeced him for money.\n\nJimmy was working at the counter one day when a scammer entered the store under pretences that his car had broken down, and asked for money by playing on Charles Senior's sympathies. However, Jimmy realised instantly that the man was a con-artist and called him out. Impressed by Jimmy's vigilance, the scammer offered him a few words of advice: \"there are wolves and sheep in this world kid, wolves and sheep. Figure out which one you're going to be\" (\"Inflatable\", \"Slip\"). Immediately after, Jimmy began to embezzle money from the store's cash machine. In addition to stealing bank notes, Jimmy also took rare coins from the register, which he stashed in a box hidden within a ceiling panel. He would eventually use said coins for scams of his own.\n\nTeenage and early adult life in Cicero\n\nYears later, Chuck was working as a legal clerk when his father requested help with the store's accounts. Upon reviewing the books, Chuck discovered that over $14,000 was missing, having been embezzled by Jimmy (\"Rebecca\", \"Chicanery\"). Soon after, the store closed, and six months later Charles Senior was dead. Jimmy blamed the store's failure on his father's excessive generosity and trusting nature (\"Slip\"), but Chuck pinned responsibility on his younger brother. For years, Chuck would secretly loathe Jimmy, seeing him as the cause of their father's death.\n\nIn his teenage years, Jimmy began to run his own scams to earn quick money. At high school, he manufactured and sold fake ID cards to his classmates (\"Nailed\"). His most famous scam was the so-called 'slip-and-fall'. This involved intentionally slipping on patches of ice during Cicero's cold winters and faking injury, thus prompting concerned bystanders to give money. In later years, Jimmy even claimed a single slip and fall had once earned him $8,000 (\"Uno\"). In 1982, Jimmy staged a fall outside the Marshall Field's department store, but broke his knees after hitting the ground too hard (\"Saul Gone\"). He soon became renowned in Cicero for such exploits, earning him the nickname \"Slippin' Jimmy\".\n\nIn adult life, Jimmy teamed up with his close friend Marco Pasternak, and together they performed many elaborate scams. One of the duo's most successful schemes involved convincing others to pay large sums of money for fake Rolex watches. In other scams, they also tricked people into buying regular coins which they claimed to be rare and valuable. Jimmy thus spent much of his early adult in Cicero's bars, drinking and scamming unsuspecting people.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Jimmy divorced his first wife after she had an affair with a man named Chet, who also happened to owe him money. In 1992, a drunken Jimmy encountered Chet at a local Dairy Queen and decided to perform a \"Chicago Sunroof\" (the act of defecating through the sunroof of a person's car) as revenge. Unbeknownst to him, however, Chet's children were in the back seat. Even worse, Chet had ties to local prosecutors. Jimmy was quickly brought in by the police on charges of property damage, assault, and a possible sex offense. He was booked and placed in pre-trial detention (\"Marco\").\n\nBy this time, Chuck had become a successful lawyer in Albuquerque, co-founding the prestigious law firm Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill. At the request of his mother, Chuck flew out to Cicero to visit his younger brother in jail. Jimmy begged Chuck to use his legal acuity to make the charges disappear. Chuck, however, was not entirely amenable to the idea. The two brothers had not seen each other for five years, and being abundantly aware of Jimmy's disreputable life as a con-artist, and the potential damage his brother's antics could cause to his reputation, Chuck was initially reluctant to assist him. He eventually agreed on the condition that Jimmy move to Albuquerque and take up a legitimate job in the mailroom of his law firm. Jimmy agreed to this, realising that without Chuck's intervention, his life would be over. With the charges now quashed, Jimmy wished farewell to Marco and moved to Albuqurque (\"Nacho\"), (\"Marco\").\n\nEarly life in Albuquerque\n\nJimmy and Chuck returned to Cicero seven years later, when their mother Ruth was in failing health (\"Marco\"). When she was hospitalized, the brothers sat for three days at her bedside. Eventually, Jimmy decided to step out for some hoagies, only to be devastated when, upon returning to the hospital, Chuck told him Ruth had died. When Jimmy asked if she had said anything before passing, Chuck lied and said she hadn't; in reality, she had briefly awoken and called for Jimmy, and Jimmy would never know the truth (\"Klick\").\n\nIn Albuquerque, Jimmy befriended many people, including Chuck's then-wife Rebecca Bois and Chuck's law partner, Howard Hamlin. Most importantly, he met and began a semi-romantic relationship with Kim Wexler, a co-worker in the HHM mailroom who was attending law school. In 1993, Jimmy is delivering mail at HHM and talks to his co-workers about a betting pool for the Academy Awards he has organized. He crosses paths with Kim, who is also doing mail rounds. Chuck enters the office to a big round of applause, having just won a big inheritance lawsuit using his knowledge of obscure case law. When Chuck approaches the pair, he answers Kim's questions on case law, but is annoyed by Jimmy. After Howard collects Chuck, Kim continues her rounds, and Jimmy walks past HHM's law library. He turns around and steps inside, deciding to become a lawyer like Chuck and Kim. (\"Piñata\") To do so, he took a correspondence course from the University of American Samoa. After two failed attempts, Jimmy passed the bar exam himself in 1998.\n\nEarly legal career\n\nWhile Jimmy's friends were delighted by his achievement, Chuck was secretly shocked and disgusted at the thought of his ne'er-do-well brother practicing law. Refusing to view Jimmy as a real lawyer and frustrated that he earned a law degree so easily while Chuck himself had to work hard his entire life to build his own career, Chuck pressured Howard to block his brother from working at HHM. When Howard was forced to deliver the news, Jimmy mistakenly blamed him for the decision (\"RICO\", \"Pimento\"). Shortly thereafter, Jimmy quit HHM to become a solo practitioner.\n\nAt some point in 2001, Chuck and Rebecca separated, after which Chuck began developing apparent electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS), essentially an adverse physical reaction to electrical devices, which began to make it challenging for Chuck to lead a normal life. To accommodate this, Chuck had all his electronics removed from his house, with Jimmy often helping his brother by doing tasks such as delivering newspapers to him. When Chuck later invited Rebecca over for dinner in an attempt to reconcile with her, he created an elaborate lie with Jimmy's help to explain the lack of power and hide his condition from her. Though the dinner was initially a success, Chuck's behavior betrayed him when Rebecca answered a call on her cell phone, eventually driving him to smack it out her hand. He compounded his mistake by refusing to be honest about his condition and chastising an irate Rebecca over \"cell phone etiquette,\" prompting her to immediately leave in a cab. Shortly after this, the two officially divorced. (\"Chicanery\") Sometime in Chuck's extended leave, Jimmy delivers groceries to Chuck's house. Chuck expresses interest in hearing about Jimmy's fledgling solo practice; Jimmy clearly finds his clients distasteful, but Chuck tells him that even they deserve a good legal defense. Chuck seemingly wants a genuine conversation with Jimmy, saying that it is not too late for him to change his path, but Jimmy assumes that his brother is criticizing him and rebuffs the attempt. After Jimmy leaves, Chuck, taking his gas lantern and a copy of H.G. Wells' The Time Machine, retreats into his study. (\"Saul Gone\")\n\nBetter Call Saul\n\nSeason 1\n\nIn 2002, Jimmy works hard at his own law practice but enjoys little success. He mostly works for the court as a public defender for $700 a case, struggles with debt, is forced to sleep in a cramped office located in the back of a Vietnamese nail salon. He also takes care of Chuck. While arriving at and departing from court, Jimmy frequently butts heads with Mike Ehrmantraut, a former Philadelphia police officer who was working as the courthouse parking lot attendant at the time. When Jimmy loses potential clients Craig and Betsy Kettleman - who have been accused of embezzling money from the county treasury - to HHM and fends off an attempted injury scam from Cal and Lars Lindholm, Jimmy decides to return to his shady techniques to level the playing field. He enlists the Lindholm brothers in an attempt to win back Craig and Betsy Kettleman.\n\nThe plan backfires, however, when the twins mistakenly target Abuelita, the grandmother of Cartel drug dealer Tuco Salamanca (\"Uno\"), who kidnaps them along with Jimmy, taking them to the desert. Using his powers of persuasion, Jimmy talks Tuco out of killing the twins, but has to convince him to go for the more \"fair\" punishment of breaking one leg from each of the twins, since the Lindholms had falsely claimed Tuco's grandmother had broken one of their legs while driving. After Tuco lets the trio go, Jimmy drives the twins to the hospital, where he takes pride from the fact that he got the twins off from a \"death sentence\" to \"six months probation\", claiming to be the \"best lawyer ever\". (\"Mijo\")\n\nShortly thereafter, Jimmy receives a visit from Ignacio \"Nacho\" Varga, one of Tuco's lieutenants. Nacho, who overheard Jimmy's plan to strongarm Craig and Betsy Kettleman into business, wants to steal the money they embezzled and offers Jimmy a \"finder's fee\" of ten percent in exchange of his help. Jimmy rejects Nacho's offer, claiming he made a mistake and was going to remain straight after his encounter with Tuco. Realizing Nacho is very likely intending violence against Craig and Betsy Kettleman, Jimmy attempts to warn the family. When they disappear, he is brought in by the police—first as a suspect, then as the appointed attorney for Nacho himself, who has been marked as the prime suspect. A furious Nacho threatens Jimmy to correct the situation. Stressed by the encounter, Jimmy inadvertently escalates the matter by getting into a confrontation with Mike over a parking validation dispute, but in the process figures out Craig and Betsy Kettleman staged their own abduction to evade further scrutiny. (\"Nacho\")\n\nJimmy tracks down Craig and Betsy Kettleman and persuades them to return home, but accepts a $30,000 payment from them as both a \"retainer\" and a bribe for keeping quiet about their stolen money. Using this payoff, he stages a publicity stunt by creating a deliberately plagiarized version of HHM's billboard featuring himself made up to resemble Howard. When Howard files an injunction for copyright infringement, Jimmy allows himself to lose, using the incident to garner public support through the media as the \"little guy\" being pushed around by the corporate HHM. While filming a video about his billboard being forcibly taken down, a worker falls off the platform and dangles by a rope. While cameras are rolling, Jimmy climbs up to the platform and \"rescues\" the worker, who is revealed to be in on Jimmy's stunt. Jimmy appears heroic and gets the media exposure that he was aiming for. (\"Hero\").\n\nAfter several abortive consultations, Jimmy enjoys some small successes with some elderly clients, leading Kim to suggest he consider practicing elder law. However, Jimmy receives an urgent call from Howard, informing him that Chuck had an altercation with the police and has been hospitalized. Rushing to the hospital, Jimmy fends off doctors, security, and Howard himself in order to bring his brother home. At Chuck's house, Jimmy sees a copy of the Albuquerque Journal he had hid from Chuck, which included an article about the billboard stunt on the front page. Realizing his culpability in Chuck's mental collapse, Jimmy explains his actions as a \"little bit of razzmatazz\" and reassures Chuck that as he now has clients, the incident will not be repeated. (\"Alpine Shepherd Boy\").\n\nDeciding to go into elder law, Jimmy redesigns his image and dons a suit similar to Andy Griffith's on Matlock. He begins volunteering at retirement homes, where he helps pass out meals (which are stamped with his contact information and ads), hosts bingo games, and slowly builds a growing client base (\"Bingo\"). When he visits the Sandpiper Crossing retirement home, he learns that the workers are grossly overcharging the residents. He searches Sandpiper's dumpsters and collects shredded documents as evidence, which he painstakingly puts back together with the help of Chuck, who was at first reluctant to help Jimmy after the latter's underhanded tactics. Chuck soon becomes more invested in the case, staying up all night reconstructing the documents and finding evidence against Sandpiper. After waking up and seeing his brother hard at work Jimmy asks if they are officially working together on the case as lawyers which Chuck offers to do. The joyful Jimmy hugs Chuck, feeling professionally respected by him. While researching old cases for relevant information, Chuck even lets Jimmy use his old code to authorize Kim to print the cases. (\"RICO\"). Chuck agrees that Jimmy has built a strong case against Sandpiper but tells him to take the case to HHM, since they have more resources; Jimmy reluctantly agrees. On the night before the brothers are to head to deliver the case to HHM, Chuck secretly goes outside and uses Jimmy's phone to call Howard.\n\nDuring the meeting, Howard agrees to take the case and pay Jimmy 20% of the common fund share of the final settlement, plus twenty thousand dollars as a \"consulting fee\" for the work he has already spent building the case against Sandpiper, which Jimmy happily agrees too. However, when Jimmy suggests working for HMM on the case Howard flatly refuses to hire Jimmy. Not even given a reason as too why he was not hired for a multi-million dollar case he brought to HHM in a silver plater, Jimmy angrily turns down the deal and leaves. After seeing Kim, who urges him to take the deal, Jimmy confronts Chuck after realizing that his cell phone's battery had been drained when his brother used it to call Howard. Chuck confesses that it was he, not Howard, who blocked his career at HHM, telling Jimmy that he never considered him a real lawyer. Heartbroken, Jimmy storms out of the house, telling Chuck that he will not provide for him anymore. (\"Pimento\") Jimmy accepts HHM's previous deal and hands over the Sandpiper case, apologizing to Howard and giving him the responsibility for caring for Chuck.\n\nWhile hosting a bingo game at a nursing home, Jimmy suffers an emotional breakdown and recollects the \"Chicago Sunroof\" incident before walking away in disgust. He travels back to Cicero and reconnects with Marco. Together, they start doing scams again. After a whole week, Jimmy says that he has to return to his clients, but Marco insists that they do one last scam together. Sadly, Marco dies of a heart attack in Jimmy's arms. At his funeral, Jimmy is given Marco's old ring by his mother.\n\nJimmy receives a phone call from Kim telling him that Davis & Main, a law firm in Santa Fe, wants to hire him as a representative in the Sandpiper case. Back in Albuquerque, he goes to the meeting but declines the position. He then talks to Mike at his booth, wondering why they gave back Craig and Betsy Kettleman' money. As Mike states that he was hired to do a job and simply did it, Jimmy declares that he knows what stopped him and swears that \"it's never stopping me again.\" He drives off while humming \"Smoke on the Water,\" as Marco did during their scam sprees together. (\"Marco\", \"Switch\")\n\nSeason 2\n\nJimmy openly agitates his landlady, Mrs. Nguyen, and tears down his door sign. He rents a room at a luxury hotel and begins running scams on the other guests. When confronted by Kim over his new lifestyle, Jimmy persuades her to try it out. Stunned at first, she is amused when Jimmy successfully puts the move on Ken, a loudmouthed broker. One thing leads to another, and the two spend the night together. The morning after, however, Kim admonishes Jimmy to return to reality, refusing to participate in further scams. Eventually, Jimmy decides to follow her advice, and returns to Davis & Main to accept their job offer. (\"Switch\")\n\nJimmy adjusts quickly to his new status and perks at D&M, including a private office (with a cocobolo desk), company car, and personal assistant named Omar. He also hits it off well with his new boss, Clifford Main, and considers establishing a live-in relationship with Kim. However, Chuck, having returned to work at HHM, attends the Sandpiper briefings— officially in his capacity as senior partner, but in reality to intimidate Jimmy. A further complication arises when Mike enlists Jimmy to represent his employer Daniel Wormald, who has implicated himself in a drug deal. Jimmy successfully gets Daniel off, but is forced to fabricate evidence of a pie fetish video to do so. When he lets the story slip to Kim, she furiously chastises him. (\"Cobbler\")\n\nJimmy embarks on a dubious recruitment campaign for the Sandpiper suit, convinced that the company is blocking traditional methods of contact with his prospects. His plan to engage a busload of Sandpiper residents is largely successful, but attracts undue attention from Chuck, Kim, and the other partners. Jimmy then proposes a TV commercial; specially timed to reach prospects during daytime hours—a point of access Sandpiper cannot block. While Cliff is open to the idea, seeing a previous ad run by D&M convinces Jimmy that the firm will never agree to the style or time of broadcast he needs.\n\nTaking what he feels is the initiative, Jimmy compiles a video crew comprised of UNM students to film and air his own commercial advertising the Sandpiper suit. While a major windfall for the firm, the act immediately draws the ire of Cliff and his partners. (\"Amarillo\") Jimmy tries to soothe the waters with them, but is reprimanded for his actions. To his shock and disgust, he learns that Kim has also come under fire at HHM for allegedly approving of the tape, but in truth, for her association with him. She becomes furious with Jimmy, and refuses any offers of help in restoring her good graces with HHM. Jimmy confronts Chuck over Kim's demerit, only for Chuck to rebuff him, refusing even his offer of full responsibility for the incident. (\"Gloves Off\")\n\nJimmy's frustrations continue to mount at D&M after he is \"paired\" with legal assistant Erin Brill for help in the Sandpiper case— in truth, she has been assigned to monitor Jimmy and force him to adhere to D&M policy. Immediately chafing under Erin's constant prodding and corrections, Jimmy dodges her as soon as he can so that he can present Kim his latest offer: a letter of legal action against HHM for mistreatment. Kim steadfastly refuses, resolving to save herself. Jimmy begins to question his decision to take his position at D&M, as Erin continues to hamper his progress in court and at the clerk's office. Seeing his old colleagues talking about the recent changes only serve to fuel the dilemma. (\"Rebecca\")\n\nD&M replaces Jimmy's original ad for a more sanitized one to be played during ineffective air times. Beginning to become fed up with D&M's enslavement to policy over productivity, he begins preparations for departure and begins sleeping in his old office at the nail salon, which he still has kept under lease. Jimmy mends fences with Kim after she is tempted into another con game at the hotel. (\"Bali Ha'i\")\n\nAt the courthouse, Jimmy accompanies Mike as the latter gives an amended statement to the D.A. regarding his scuffle with Tuco Salamanca. Later, as Jimmy prepares his letter of resignation for D&M, Omar informs him that resigning or being fired for cause will result in a forfeit of his bonus. Thus, Jimmy decides to go for the outlandish track by dressing in gaudy suits, making horrible messes in the office, and becoming such a general nuisance to his co-workers that Cliff proceeds to fire him without cause, thus allowing Jimmy to keep his bonus. (\"Inflatable\")\n\nNow that he's no longer with D&M, Jimmy proposes Wexler McGill - a joint partnership with Kim, sharing all expenses and costs, as well as profits. Kim is intrigued, but initially disagrees— she is not prepared to risk her career with Jimmy being the kind of lawyer he is. She does, however, offer a counter proposal: she will start a solo practice for herself and share an office with him. Jimmy is intrigued, but advises Kim to hang on to her new client, Mesa Verde Bank and Trust, knowing that HHM will attempt to keep them as soon as they realize Kim is resigning. Kim is hesitant at first, but upon overhearing Howard contacting Mesa Verde after delivering her resignation letter, quickly takes steps to retain Mesa Verde's services for herself. Meanwhile, Jimmy procures an old dentist's office for renovation into the joint venture. He begins producing his own personal ad, enlisting the aid of his former college video crew and some of his elder clients.\n\nWhen Chuck and Howard outmaneuver Kim to retain Mesa Verde for themselves, an outraged Jimmy springs into action. Sneaking into Chuck's house under the cover of family ties, Jimmy carefully removes documents containing the address of Mesa Verde's proposed site for a new branch: 1261 Rosella Drive, Scottsdale, Arizona. He takes the records to a nearby copy shop, where he creates doctored copies with the street number transposed into 1216. He then substitutes the altered papers into in the Mesa Verde case work. Patiently waiting for Chuck to wake up, Jimmy confronts and chastises him over stealing Kim's laurels. Chuck brushes Jimmy off, not wanting to fight again, but in so doing, fails to truly question Jimmy's presence in his home. (\"Fifi\")\n\nAfter waiting for Chuck to complete his legal preparation prior to the Mesa Verde hearing, Jimmy quietly restores the original documents after his brother departs to present the permit request. Jimmy's plan works perfectly—Chuck and HHM are caught in a massive clerical fiasco at the hearing, and Mesa Verde returns to Kim. However, Chuck deduces exactly what Jimmy has done and openly accuses him when Jimmy and Kim come to pick up the files. Kim defends Jimmy, criticizing Chuck for his cold and judgmental treatment of his brother. Once out of the house, however, Kim makes it clear that she knows Chuck was telling the truth. Later that evening, Kim strongly hints to Jimmy that he had best thoroughly cover his tracks. Quickly proceeding to the copy shop, Jimmy cuts a deal with the clerk to eliminate all evidence of his presence there from the other night— but not before Ernesto has questioned the clerk on Chuck's behalf. Hoping the clerk is capable of carrying out the cover-up, Jimmy watches as Chuck himself arrives and begins grilling the clerk about Jimmy's activities at the copy shop. Jimmy watches with pride as the clerk lives up to his word and adamantly denies having seen Jimmy, even in the face of Ernesto's statements. To his horror, however, Jimmy watches as Chuck has another spell, passing out and cracking his skull on the counter in the process. (\"Nailed\")\n\nChoosing his brother's safety over his deniability, Jimmy rushes Chuck back to the hospital, where he anxiously sits in the waiting room, awaiting word. Once he hears that Chuck has stabilized, Jimmy goes to see his brother, who immediately calls Jimmy out on his proximity to the shop during his accident. However, Ernesto comes to Jimmy's aid, claiming that he called Jimmy before Chuck left the house to question the store clerk. A furious Chuck tells them both to get out. In the hall, Jimmy asks Ernesto why he lied on his behalf. Ernesto replies that Jimmy is his friend, and Chuck's vendetta against him is upsetting. Jimmy thanks his friend, who only will say that he simply misses being back in the mail room, before walking away.\n\nConvinced against his better judgement to submit Chuck to a temporary emergency guardianship order, followed by a CAT scan and workup, Jimmy sits with Kim, worried about the obvious chilling effect the Mesa Verde incident is having on their relationship. When Jimmy's new ad airs on the television, he barely notices. Kim, however, is amazed that he was able to film such a professional-looking ad on a shoestring budget. With some of his confidence back, Jimmy turns to face the newly arrived results: Chuck is not permanently injured but is in a state of self-induced catatonia from the perceived \"trauma\" of the CAT scan. In frustration, Jimmy sits down by Chuck's bedside and angrily pronounces he is not moving until Chuck wakes up. When Chuck eventually does so, and mockingly asks Jimmy if his next move is to the asylum, Jimmy simply tells Chuck he is taking him back home. After doing just that, Jimmy is assured by Chuck that he will be fine.\n\nLater on, Jimmy begins his first consultations at the new Wexler McGill office, now finished and ready for business. Without warning, he is called by an irate Howard, who tells him Chuck has quit HHM and demands an explanation. Returning to Chuck's house, Jimmy is shocked to see his brother covering the walls in \"space blanket\" linings and insulation, and when he questions Chuck about it, Chuck calmly explains that he believes his \"sensitivity\" has become unmanageable and he cannot even remain indoors without protection. When Chuck breaks down and begins crying over his \"failure\" with Mesa Verde, Jimmy has a crisis of conscience, and he confesses his complicity in the incident. Chuck is stunned and tells Jimmy he has just admitted to a felony. Jimmy retorts that it was to make Chuck feel better, and it would be merely one's word against the other. Jimmy leaves to phone Howard and reassure him that Chuck will not be quitting HHM, not seeing the tape recorder Chuck has concealed under a stack of foil. (\"Klick\")\n\nSeason 3\n\nConfident that he has restored his brother's confidence, Jimmy begins helping Chuck to take down the space blanket wallpaper. He reminisces upon finding an old book he and his brother used to read, and Chuck seems to respond jokingly enough, but eventually, he stops Jimmy in mid-sentence and delivers an ominous warning: he will not forget what Jimmy has done, and he will see that Jimmy pays a price. Further hints of trouble await Jimmy at his office upon his return: Captain Bauer from the airbase has learned of Jimmy's ad and is furious. Trying to defuse a heated argument, Jimmy attempts to reason with Bauer, until his own anger builds, and he coldly advises the captain to let the matter go, resulting in Bauer storming out while making a violent public scene. (\"Mabel\")\n\nWhile Jimmy and Kim work on hiring a new paralegal, Mike calls Jimmy and has him watch the man Mike tailed as he has breakfast in the restaurant. Jimmy notices nothing unusual and reports back to Mike as Gus Fring watches the two from a distance. Ernesto approaches Wexler-McGill but decides against entering and speaks to Kim in the parking lot about the tape. Kim relays this information to Jimmy, and she takes Jimmy on as her legal client, advising him that the tape is no legal threat to him. Jimmy suppresses his feelings of anger and betrayal in front of Kim, but later drives to Chuck's house, breaks in, berates him, and destroys the tape. However, this more or less happens all according to Chuck's plan, as he only used the tape as bait, and Howard and the private investigator are present to witness Jimmy's break-in. (\"Witness\")\n\nJimmy is arrested and jailed following a few harsh but hesitant words with Chuck and chooses to represent himself in court (against Kim's wishes), pleads not guilty and posts bail. Jimmy later explains what happened during his break-in and tells Kim to focus on Mesa Verde while he works his own legal battle, to which she flatly agrees. The prosecutor in Jimmy's case, Assistant District Attorney Hay, meets with Chuck and tells him that she doesn't plan to let Jimmy off easy. Chuck wishes to seek a \"better solution for everyone.\" Jimmy talks with Kim outside of Wexler-McGill and informs her that he can avoid jail time but will have to confess to his felony break-in and submit his confession to the New Mexico Bar Association, which will likely result in disbarment. Kim convinces Jimmy to let her help him fight Chuck's plot. (\"Sunk Costs\")\n\nJimmy hires Mike to pose as a handyman, and Mike uses the repair of Chuck's door as cover to photograph the interior of Chuck's house in order to document the bizarre living conditions. Jimmy, Kim, Hamlin, Chuck, and ADA Hay meet in order to finalize Jimmy's confession, with Jimmy agreeing to have his confession reviewed by the New Mexico Bar Association. After the meeting, Kim confronts Chuck, telling him that she suspects he has a copy of the tape. Chuck confirms her suspicions and states that he plans to submit the tape as evidence in Jimmy's disciplinary hearing. Kim then relays the information to Jimmy, revealing that having Chuck admit the existence of the second tape was all according to their plan. (\"Sabrosito\")\n\nBoth sides gear up for Jimmy’s hearing in front of the New Mexico Bar Association after Jimmy meets with veterinarian Caldera to acquire the services of \"someone with a light touch.\" At the hearing, things do not seem to go well for Jimmy as the tape is played before the committee. Rebecca enters the courtroom, much to Chuck’s surprise, though he believes it's some ploy by Jimmy to throw him off balance. Later, Jimmy cross-examines Chuck about the circumstances of the recording, Rebecca’s presence, and his illness. Though Chuck remains calm throughout most of it, Jimmy reveals that Chuck had been carrying a fully charged cell phone battery planted by Huell for the entire hearing, contradicting the EHS symptoms Chuck claimed to have and suggesting he has a mental illness. This triggers a sudden and acidic tirade from Chuck as he vents all of his frustrations about Jimmy and how he never should have tried to help him. Chuck realizes, too late, that his outburst has shocked the entire courtroom, including the committee. (\"Chicanery\")\n\nJimmy is given only a year's suspension in the aftermath of his legal battle with Chuck. Afterwards, while he and Kim celebrate, Rebecca asks Jimmy to help with Chuck, who has shuttered himself in his home, but Jimmy refuses, no longer calling Chuck his brother. Jimmy must figure out how to recoup money spent on his remaining television commercial slots. With the help of his college film crew, he uses a loophole in his contract to sell the slots via a new series of commercials, in which Jimmy poses as a character named Saul Goodman. (\"Off Brand\")\n\nJimmy tries to fulfill his court-mandated community service while also trying to sell his commercials, but can't convince anybody to sign on for more than one or two spots, and more often, none at all. Cash in hand from the few spots Jimmy does secure rapidly nets deeper and deeper losses, but Jimmy papers over this careening towards poverty by bravely giving his film crew and Kim Wexler the very last of his money and insisting he is not maxing out his credit cards or emptying out his personal bank account. Finally, in a parking lot after yet another net-loss, Jimmy collapses on the ground and stays there, clearly exhausted, nearly penniless, and extremely depressed. While Kim was having a dinner with Jimmy, she wonders whether they did the right thing, and Jimmy replies what happened to Chuck was his own fault and that she should forget about him. Jimmy meets with an insurance agent to try and get a refund on his malpractice insurance policy. However, the agent is unable to grant the refund and mentions that due to his suspension, Jimmy's future premiums will rise by 150%. Jimmy is visibly shaken by this news and starts to cry. When the agent reacts sympathetically to his emotional breakdown, Jimmy seizes the opportunity to \"accidentally\" mention Chuck's mental illness before leaving, knowing that the insurance company will be forced to act on the information. (\"Expenses\")\n\nJimmy's guitar store clients become suspicious of his motives and refuse to pay him for their commercial spot. Jimmy stages a \"slip and fall\" con, intentionally slipping on a drumstick and injuring himself in the process. Kim returns to the office to find Jimmy lying on the floor, with his half of the rent, indicating he used the \"slip and fall\" to coerce the guitar shop into paying him off. Despite Jimmy's assurances, Kim still expresses doubts about Jimmy's ability to pay and considers taking on another client. Jimmy later is able to make $700 during his community service, helping a drug dealer \"see his sick child\" by threatening the supervisor with legal action. (\"Slip\")\n\nJimmy talks with the Sandpiper class action representative Irene to get an update on the Sandpiper case and realizes that Sandpiper has already offered a settlement deal which if D&M and HHM accept, would give Jimmy over $1 million as his share of the settlement. Jimmy tries to convince Howard to accept the settlement, but Howard sees through Jimmy's motivations and refuses. In order to secure the Sandpiper settlement, Jimmy pulls a series of cons and social manipulations to trick Irene into thinking that holding out on the Sandpiper settlement is against the interests of her fellow elderly clients and she moves to accept it, giving Jimmy his much-needed fee. He returns to the office to give the good news to Kim. (\"Fall\")\n\nJimmy, feeling partly responsible for Kim's exhaustion and resulting car accident, finally agrees to break their office lease and have Kim work out of her own home to save costs. Jimmy meanwhile tries to make amends with Chuck, but Chuck coldly cuts ties. Jimmy then tries to mend relations between Irene and her friends but is unable to since Irene's friends remain suspicious of her. He finally outs himself as crooked in front of his elderly clients, which both vindicates Irene and cancels the Sandpiper settlement. After insulting Jimmy and forcing him away, Chuck commits suicide by pushing a gas lantern off a table and onto a pile of newspapers, leaving Jimmy as the sole living member of his family. (\"Lantern\")\n\nSeason 4\n\nJimmy learns about Chuck's death, racing to the house with Kim in time to see the coroners removing his brother's body from the fire-gutted house. Chuck's death sends Jimmy into a depressive mood, unable to even approve the obituary written by Howard. At the funeral, Jimmy is given condolences by Chuck's partners and co-workers. Arriving home with Kim, they find Howard outside who reveals that he believed Chuck committed suicide. Howard blames himself for trying to force Chuck out of Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill. Even though he is responsible for revealing his brother's mental illness to the insurance company and igniting the feud between Chuck and Howard, Jimmy is satisfied that no one knows of his role and with someone else to take the blame, he happily tells Howard that it is his \"cross to bear,\" stunning Howard and Kim. (\"Smoke\")\n\nJimmy approaches Mike with an offer to break into Neff Copiers to replace Mr. Neff's valuable Hummel figurine with a copy and then split the proceeds. Mike turns him down and offers condolences over Chuck's death. Jimmy then goes to see Caldera and is told that their contact is also not interested in the job. Angrily, Jimmy takes the phone and breaks protocol but manages to set up a meeting. His contact, Ira, breaks into Neff Copiers to steal the figure, but finds Mr. Neff living in the office. Hiding under the desk, Jimmy creates a distraction outside the store in order for Ira to complete the theft. At home the next morning, Kim gives Jimmy documents from a meeting with Howard, including a release stating that he will not contest the $5,000 inheritance, and a letter from Chuck. Jimmy reads the letter, in which Chuck expresses his approval about Jimmy turning his life around. Jimmy is apparently unaffected by the contents of the letter. (\"Something Beautiful\")\n\nJimmy is offered a job as a shift supervisor at CC Mobile, but he turns it down. After Kim gives him the contact information of a therapist, Jimmy lies that he took the job. When she leaves, Jimmy calls CC Mobile back to accept the position. Jimmy's new job is boring because of a lack of customers and is told that he can't transfer to another store because of a lack of positions. Jimmy goes to meet Ira to collect his proceeds from the Hummel figurine sale and is surprised that it is more than he expected. Ira tells him to contact him again using a new phone if he has another job. Jimmy becomes inspired and returns to CC Mobile where he starts an advertising campaign by painting \"IS THE MAN LISTENING? PRIVACY SOLD HERE\" on the store windows. (\"Talk\")\n\nDespite his new business idea, Jimmy struggles to increase trade at CC Mobile until the owner of a contracting business arrives. Asking if what Jimmy is offering will protect him from the IRS, the customer buys a large amount of drop phones to communicate without being eavesdropped on or even tracked. After trying to spend time with Kim that evening, Jimmy goes back to CC Mobile and takes a stack of phones with him. After trying to sell to three youths who call him a \"narc,\" Jimmy then manages to sell the stack of phones to unsavory characters at the Dog House. Heading home, he is mugged and beaten by the three youths who steal all the money he made. Kim helps him tend to his wounds at home, and Jimmy finally agrees to see a therapist. The next day, Jimmy removes the advertising sign from the front of CC Mobile. At the courthouse during his PPD check-in, Jimmy lies about associating with criminals and then decides that he will get his law license back and be a damn good lawyer. (\"Quite a Ride\")\n\nJimmy begins dreaming about reviving Wexler McGill, and admits to Kim that he is not going to see a therapist because he wants to move forward. Kim reluctantly accepts the decision. Jimmy heads to the Forque Kitchen and Bar for dinner with Kim, where she tells him that she has been hired at the head of Schweikart & Cokely's banking division. Jimmy wants to practice criminal law and reform Wexler McGill, but Kim's plans do not coincide with Jimmy's. Although Jimmy realizes his dreams have been dashed, he wishes Kim well with her career. Jimmy goes to HHM to collect the $5,000 inheritance. Jimmy learns HHM is going through a bad spell and admonishes Howard for wallowing and not fighting. Howard retorts with a \"fuck you,\" and Jimmy tells him to use that rage to his advantage. Later, Jimmy takes deliver of a new set of phones at Day Spa and Nail, and has to bribe Mrs. Nguyen with one so he can keep them in the back room. At night, Jimmy finds the three youths who mugged him and offers to cut them in on his business in return for leaving him alone. Instead, they threaten him with a switchblade, causing Jimmy to run. The youths give chase but find themselves in a trap where they are captured and hung up in a piñata store. Two masked men, one of whom is Huell Babineaux, bust the piñatas while Jimmy warns them about ripping him off again. Suitably terrified, Jimmy tells them they have had their warning and leaves them hanging. (\"Piñata\")\n\nOver the course of several months, Jimmy continues to use his \"Saul Goodman\" alias to sell burner phones to Albuquerque's criminals while at the same time continuing his PPD. Jimmy tours a potential office site with Huell, laying out how each room would be used when his law license is reinstated. Jimmy is invited to a party with Kim at S&C where he takes over and becomes the life of the party. Kim and Richard appear to be uncomfortable, and it causes tension between Jimmy and Kim on the drive home. While selling phones, Jimmy is approached by a plainclothes cop, Platt. Platt has a Saul Goodman card he took from a drug dealer he busted and tells Jimmy to sell is phones to a different clientele elsewhere. Jimmy refuses, and the argument is broken up by Huell who knocks Platt over with a shopping bag. Huell is arrested and Jimmy tries to bargain his freedom for moving his business elsewhere. Platt refuses and arrests Huell. Charged with assault, Huell is facing two and half years in prison and threatens to skip bail. Jimmy talks him out of it and finds out that Platt is an alcoholic. He asks Jimmy to engineer Platt's drunken breakdown in court in order to get the case dismissed. Kim is disturbed that Jimmy has been selling phones to criminals and agrees to look into Huell's case although he refuses to ruin Platt. (\"Something Stupid\")\n\nJimmy heads to Huell's hometown of Coushatta by bus, writing postcards in different handwriting and pens and even getting other other passengers to write messages. In Coushatta, Jimmy posts the messages and then gets on the bus back home. The letters are part of a plan to help Huell, since they all demand his release. Judge Munsinger demands the case be settled without a circus. When the prosecutor starts calling the letter writers, Jimmy sets up an elaborate con where he and members of a film crew pose as people Huell knew which convinces her that the letter-writing campaign is genuine. She begins negotiating with Kim. Jimmy and Kim reconcile and the next morning Kim compliments him on his genius idea with the phones, while Jimmy tells her that it was her idea in the first place. Their plan ends with Huell serving only four months' probation. Jimmy is surprised when Kim tells him that she wants to undertake similar schemes. (\"Coushatta\")\n\nIn Lubbock, Texas, Jimmy and Kim work a scam on the Department of Building Safety that results in them tricking the state into giving Mesa Verde a larger branch. Jimmy is planning for the future reinstatement of his law license, and intends to use the customers from his burner phone business as his new clients. The committee ultimately decides not to reinstate his license due to a lack of sincerity, causing Jimmy to fly into a rage. Talking with Kim, she realizes that the reason the committee ruled against him was because he did not mention Chuck – the victim of the crime that led to his suspension – once during the hearing. Jimmy is angry that he is expected to be sympathetic. Jimmy and Kim argue, with Jimmy later apologizing and admitting he messed up. Kim asks him if he still wants to be a lawyer. When Jimmy answers yes, she says they will start with that. (\"Wiedersehen\")\n\nAs part of a scheme to seem sincere about Chuck's death, Jimmy makes a point of openly grieving at Chuck's grave on the one-year anniversary of his death. Howard dedicates a new law library at HHM in Chuck's name; the film crew hired by Jimmy and Kim spreads the rumor that Jimmy anonymously donated the money for the library. Jimmy is given an appeal hearing to reinstate his law license, and at Kim's suggestion reads the letter that Chuck left him. However, Jimmy senses that it will not work and tells a story about how Chuck influenced him to become a lawyer. Jimmy's speech moves Kim and some of the committee members to tears. Jimmy's law license is returned, but Kim is shocked to learn that Jimmy did not mean one word from the speech and meant it to sway the members of the committee into reinstating his license. Jimmy also reveals that he has no intention to practice law under his own name, and requests legal accreditation for a new identity to the clerk who asks him to sign some paperwork. When Kim asks what he is trying to do, Jimmy replies, \"S'all good, man!\" (\"Winner\")\n\nSeason 5\n\nJimmy officially changes his name to Saul Goodman and holds an event to advertise his new business. However, Kim is less than pleased when Jimmy offers her advice to scam one of her clients into accepting a deal, though she eventually goes through with it. (\"Magic Man\")\n\nNacho and Blingy drive Jimmy to a garage where Lalo is repairing his car. Lalo warmly greets a fearful Jimmy and states that he is impressed with how Jimmy used his communication skills to talk Tuco out of killing the skateboarders a few years previously. Lalo tells Jimmy that he wants him to carry a message to Domigo \"Krazy-8\" Molina inside the Metropolitan Detention Center, which would be protected under attorney-client privilege. Jimmy tries to talk himself out of the imposed job by mentioning increased rates, but Lalo hands him over the demanded fee in cash on the spot.\n\nAt the MDC, Jimmy is in an interview room when a shackled Krazy-8 is brought before him. Krazy-8 is initially perplexed as he never hired Jimmy, though his demeanor changes when Jimmy reveals that Lalo hired him. Krazy-8 insists he hasn't said anything incriminating to the police about the origin of the drugs. Jimmy asks if he's good at memorizing information and hands him a notepad with a written script. As Jimmy sits across the street from the MDC, an unmarked police car arrives carrying DEA agents Hank Schrader and Steven Gomez. As they enter the jail and leave their weapons in a holding room, Hank and Gomez engage in conversation about expired food. They walk into the interview room and meet with Krazy-8, who has expressed a willingness to talk. Following Jimmy and Lalo's script, Krazy-8 gives the agents details about drug dealing procedures and where hidden drug money can be found. Playing his part in the charade, Jimmy loudly enters the room and pretends to have a disagreement with his client about sharing information with the police. Hank immediately sees through Jimmy's \"Saul Goodman\" persona, and he and Gomez are suspicious of the overblown performance. When the agents attempt to leave the room, Jimmy tells them that Krazy-8's information will lead to results; Hank insists that it has to lead to further arrests. Jimmy demands protection for his client as a confidential informant. Agreeing on that, Krazy-8 continues by sharing the exact locations of three dead drops. (\"The Guy For This\")\n\nJimmy and Kim get married in a small civil ceremony with Huell as a witness. At the same time, after Lalo gets arrested for the murder of Fred Whalen, Jimmy is called in to represent him. Jimmy is eventually given information by Mike allows him to get Lalo bail at seven million dollars. Lalo promises that he can come up with the money, but will need Jimmy to collect it. However, Jimmy becomes visibly conflicted at seeing how upset Fred's parents are and has an explosive confrontation with Howard over his behavior in the courthouse. (\"JMM\")\n\nLalo gives Jimmy instructions on where to collect the money, but Jimmy refuses until Lalo agrees to pay him $100,000 in exchange. Jimmy informs Kim who is less than pleased by the danger Jimmy will put himself in, but reluctantly agrees. In the desert, Jimmy meets with the Cousins who silently hand over the money in two large duffle bags before taking off. However, on his way home, Jimmy is ambushed by a gang who are after the money. As they prepare to execute him, Jimmy is rescued by Mike who was tracking Jimmy and kills five of the six gangsters. However, one escapes and in the process, destroys Mike's truck and damages Jimmy's car, forcing the two men to strip it and push the car over a cliff.\n\nDue to the danger of Tiburón returning, Jimmy and Mike are forced to trek through the desert with Jimmy carrying the heavy bags of money. Jimmy has a hard time adapting to the situation, only reluctantly filling his old Davis & Main water bottle with his own urine in lieu of water and resorting to dragging the bags when he gets tired, resulting in one ripping slightly and Jimmy injuring his foot on a cactus when he retrieves the lost money. Hunted relentlessly, exhausted and sunburned, Jimmy decides to give up, but Mike gives him a speech about how he is driven by protecting those he loves and ensuring they have a better life. With the Tiburón searching nearby, Jimmy is filled with renewed purpose, dons one of Mike's space blankets and begins walking down the road to draw the man out for Mike. Jimmy succeeds in drawing Tiburón's attention, allowing Mike to kill him with a sniper rifle. However, Tiburón's truck crashes and is wrecked in the process, leaving Jimmy and Mike without a car again and without water as Tiburón's water supply was also destroyed. Jimmy finally drinks his own urine as Mike had earlier attempted to get him to do and begins walking down the road with Mike back to civilization, the threat to them now gone. (\"Bagman\")\n\nContinuing their arduous journey through the desert, Jimmy eventually gets a signal and calls a worried Kim. The two eventually make their way to a truck stop where Victor and Tyrus Kitt pick up Jimmy and Mike. The two reveal that Gus' men have recovered all of the bodies except for Tiburón who died out in the middle of nowhere and can't be found. Mike is satisfied and tells Jimmy that he must prepare his story for what took him so long. Arriving at the jail, Jimmy hands over the bags of money, drawing the suspicions of the DA and authorities that Lalo would have so much cash on hand for his bail. As he waits, Jimmy discovers that the Cousins included an extra $100,000 in the bags at Lalo's request to pay Jimmy for his services. Lalo is released and makes it clear that he intends to jump bail and flee to Mexico while Jimmy lies that it took him so long as his car broke down six or seven miles from the pickup spot and he had to walk back. Before departing with Nacho, Lalo reveals Kim's visit to a concerned Jimmy and compliments him on his wife.\n\nReturning home, Jimmy's sunburn is treated by Kim and he continually refuses to go to the hospital. Jimmy lies to Kim about his experiences and directs her to the money, but she discovers the truth after finding his coffee mug in the bag with a bullet hole through it. Jimmy chastises Kim for talking to Lalo and they both take the next day off with Jimmy displaying signs of PTSD from his experience. Jimmy is eventually called in on an easy case, but his trauma causes him to botch the case. Jimmy subsequently seeks Mike's advice and is told that he will eventually get through it, but he has started down a road with his choices. Jimmy expresses anger at the idea that Lalo will get away with Fred's senseless murder, but Mike implies that there is a plan in play to deal with Lalo.\n\nThat night, Jimmy is shocked to learn that Kim has quit Schweikart & Cokely to focus solely on her public defender work and chastises her for her actions, ignoring multiple phone calls. As Kim answers a knock on the door, Jimmy finally answers his phone, only to have a frantic Mike order him to leave the line open and hide the phone so Mike can listen in. The visitor proves to be Lalo who refuses to let Kim leave and demands to know again what happened in the desert while Mike covers Jimmy and Kim with his sniper rifle from across the street. Jimmy continues telling variations of the same story before Lalo reveals that he found Jimmy's wrecked and shot-up car. Kim finally intervenes, claiming that a passerby must've found the broken-down car and wrecked it for fun. Kim berates Lalo for his lack of trust, in both Jimmy and his own people and Lalo leaves, apparently satisfied. (\"Bad Choice Road\")\n\nAfter the confrontation, Lalo leaves Kim's apartment and drives away in Nacho's car. Jimmy picks up the phone and asks Mike what happens next. Mike just replies, \"We'll see\" and remarks that Kim saved his life. When he ends the call and Kim asks him who he was talking to, Jimmy tells her the truth about his desert trek with Mike. Jimmy and Kim feel the apartment isn't safe and immediately go to a hotel to wait out the situation for a few days. Kim later ignores Jimmy's request to remain at the hotel and visits the courthouse. She meets with a public defender named Grant and accepts twenty pending felony cases pro bono. While in an elevator, she unexpectedly encounters Howard and his associates from HHM. On her way out, Kim tells Howard she quit Schweikart and Cokely.\n\nThis intrigues Howard, and he attempts to find out what exactly happened. Kim tries to leave but Howard beckons her into an empty courtroom for privacy. Howard warns her about Jimmy's recent harassment and suggests Kim should stop following his lead. Kim laughs at Howard and says she is insulted by the notion that she cannot decide for herself. As she leaves, Howard tells her that Chuck best understood Jimmy.\n\nJimmy goes to Mike's house to question him about who he works for and about the situation with Lalo. Mike tells him he's not allowed to know this information, but still reveals that Lalo will be assassinated that night. Jimmy goes back to the hotel, packs their possessions, and informs Kim when he gets back. Kim, still angered by Howard's comments, proposes a forced resolution of the Sandpiper case by sabotaging Howard, which would enable Jimmy to receive his seven-figure share of the settlement. Jimmy counsels against it, but Kim makes use of a similar finger-pointing gesture Jimmy previously used after he was reinstated, indicating she is serious about undermining Howard, which stuns Jimmy. (\"Something Unforgivable\")\n\nSeason 6\n\nJimmy and Kim begin plotting against Howard. Prosecutor Suzanne Ericsen informs Jimmy that his client Jorge de Guzman used an alias and asks if he knows his client's real identity. Jimmy denies it but accidentally uses Lalo's real name.\n\nKim surveils Cliff Main and Howard Hamlin at the golf course while Jimmy sneaks into the locker room to plant a bag resembling cocaine in Howard's locker. Howard and Cliff find it, but Howard dismisses it as an employee's mistake or a prank.\n\nAt Kim's instigation, Jimmy cons Craig and Betsy Kettleman into believing they have grounds for a lawsuit against Howard. They attempt to hire Cliff to represent them, claiming Howard provided ineffective counsel because he used cocaine during his representation of Craig Kettleman. Cliff declines, as do several other lawyers, but Jimmy and Kim succeed in spreading the rumor that Howard uses drugs. Jimmy later attempts to bribe Craig and Betsy Kettleman into remaining silent about their role in smearing Howard. When they refuse the cash, Kim coerces them by threatening to reveal their shady tax return scam to the IRS. Jimmy disappoints Kim by giving Craig and Betsy Kettleman the cash before he leaves.\n\nSuzanne approaches Kim to say she has identified de Guzman as Lalo Salamanca, and that Lalo is dead. Suzanne has also connected Jimmy to the Salamanca drug family and asks Kim to approach him about becoming an informant. Kim informs Jimmy about the conversation and asks if he intends to be a \"friend of the cartel\" or a \"rat\".\n\nJimmy and Kim work with Huell and Huell's associate to copy Howard's car key and remote unlock button. Huell asks Jimmy why legitimate lawyers would commit crimes and Jimmy makes an unconvincing argument about committing a wrong to accomplish a greater good.\n\nJimmy discovers his representation of Lalo Salamanca has made him a pariah with courthouse staff, but a highly sought after defense attorney among Albuquerque's criminals. The influx of new clients causes Mrs. Nguyen to evict him from the nail salon, so he begins searching for an office. He identifies a vacancy in a strip mall, which he decides to rent because of its proximity to the courthouse, the county jail, and the city's bail bonds offices. His business starts to grow, and Jimmy succeeds at persuading Francesca Liddy to work as his administrative assistant.\n\nAs Kim meets with Cliff Main at an outdoor café, Jimmy disguises himself as Howard and takes Howard's car while Howard is visiting his therapist. Jimmy pushes Wendy out of the car in front of Cliff and Kim, further suggesting to Cliff that Howard is using cocaine and has prostitutes.\n\nCliff confronts Howard about his supposed cocaine use. When Howard hears Cliff mention that he was in a meeting with Kim at the time, Howard puts the pieces together and recognizes that Jimmy is continuing to harass him, so he tricks Jimmy into meeting him at a boxing gym. Howard challenges Jimmy to a bout, and Jimmy declines, but then changes his mind and enters the ring. Howard defeats him and says he hopes this ends Jimmy's harassment, but afterwards Howard directs his private investigator to begin surveilling Jimmy.\n\nDuring a meeting with Viola Goto, her former paralegal, Kim obtains the name of the retired judge who will mediate an upcoming settlement conference for the Sandpiper case. Jimmy and his film crew fabricate photos that include an actor made up to resemble the mediator. Jimmy later sees the mediator at a store and tells Kim he has a broken arm in a cast, which is not depicted in the photos. Kim abandons her plan to meet in Santa Fe with Cliff Main and representatives of a foundation interested in funding her pro bono criminal defense work and returns to Albuquerque to help Jimmy hastily re-shoot the photos.\n\nHoward's investigator delivers the photos to Howard shortly before the mediation session begins. They depict the mediator accepting money from Jimmy and are coated in a drug that causes Howard's pupils to dilate. He angrily accuses the mediator of accepting a bribe, and when he attempts to retrieve the photos as proof, he discovers they have been switched for innocuous pictures of Jimmy giving a passerby (his sound guy from his film crew in disguise) a frisbee. As Jimmy and Kim listen in on the conference call, Howard is humiliated in front of his clients and peers, and HHM and Davis & Main agree to settle the Sandpiper case. Cliff announces through the conference call that a settlement agreement has been reached as Jimmy and Kim have sex on Jimmy's office couch.\n\nAfter the mediation concludes, Howard pieces together the whole plot, including Jimmy and Kim's success at causing him to rely on a fake private investigator. That night, he arrives at Kim's apartment to confront her and Jimmy. Lalo Salamanca arrives soon afterwards, intending to interrogate Jimmy and Kim about the assassination attempt on Lalo's life, and get Jimmy to kill Gus. Jimmy and Kim are absolutely horrified by Lalo's appearance while Kim tries to get Howard to leave. When Howard asks Lalo who he is, Lalo states nonchalantly he is nobody and that he merely wishes to “speak to my lawyers” (much to Jimmy and Kim's alarm). They both nervously implore Howard to leave immediately, but Howard remains oblivious to his danger, sarcastically telling Lalo to find himself better lawyers. Lalo affixes a silencer to a pistol and, once Howard finally realizes his peril, suddenly shoots Howard in the head, instantly killing him. Jimmy and Kim both scream in horror at what has just occurred before them, as Lalo shushes them to calm down, saying, \"Okay...Let's talk.\"\n\nLalo orders a terrified Jimmy and Kim to calm down and sit on the couch. Handing them a written address and a map, he tells the couple that he wants Jimmy to take Lalo's station wagon to the address, use a revolver in the car's glove compartment to shoot the occupant when he answers the door, and take a photo of the body. Eager to prevent her from becoming Lalo's hostage, Jimmy suggests that Kim be sent to perform the task, over her horrified objections. Lalo agrees. Left with no choice, Kim leaves the apartment and drives away in Lalo's car. With Kim gone, Lalo binds Jimmy's hands and ties him to a chair, telling him of the assassination attempt at his compound which left his staff dead. Because he was introduced Jimmy through Ignacio \"Nacho\" Varga, Jimmy's former client, he suspects that he may have been in on the plan. Jimmy denies betraying Lalo and insists he had nothing to do with Nacho's actions. Lalo leaves the apartment, telling Jimmy that he expects to be told \"the whole story\" when he gets back. In his absence, Jimmy struggles to escape his restraints and falls over on the floor next to Howard's body.\n\nKim drives to the address, agonizing over what she is about to do. At a stoplight, a police car pulls up next to her; she rolls down the window and considers alerting the officers inside, but is unable to do so. Kim finally drives into a residential neighborhood and finds the house -- Gus's residence—and reluctantly walks up to the front door, ringing the bell. Just as she raises the revolver and is about the shoot the person answering the door, Mike appears from behind and disarms her, forcing her into the house. Gus watches through the surveillance monitors at the Ryman residence while Mike questions Kim. Mike is shocked to learn that Lalo is at her apartment and has taken Jimmy hostage, and sends an order for Tyrus to get there immediately. He takes the underground passage to the Ryman residence, tells Gus to stay there with two of Mike's men, then enlists two others to come with him. Watching Kim through the surveillance monitors, Gus calls Victor, who is standing in the room with Kim, and asks to speak with her directly. Kim tells Gus that Lalo had originally wanted to send Jimmy to kill him, but that Jimmy had talked Lalo out of it by sending her on the mission instead. Gus is perturbed by the fact that Jimmy had talked Lalo out of his original plan, and tells the two men guarding him to follow him somewhere.\n\nAfter Lalo is killed by Gus during a gunfight, Jimmy watches Mike's henchman, Arthur, emptying the refrigerator. Kim returns home with Mike; the couple tearfully embrace. Mike sits them down and tells them what is going to happen next: Howard's car is going to be driven several states away and abandoned next to the ocean, staged as a suicide; since the car was likely seen at the apartment before his disappearance, Jimmy and Kim are to tell the police that he showed up in a drug-addled stupor and left uneventfully. Mike stresses to them that they are to act casually for the rest of the day and pretend the events of the previous night did not happen. Jimmy sees Howard's body being stuffed in the old refrigerator while Mike's men wheel a new one into the apartment.\n\nShortly after, Jimmy began making renovations at his business, completely changing it from a nail salon to a full on law firm and he and Kim work the day while Mike and his team do damage control from their apartment and erase all traces of Howard’s murder. When Jimmy and Kim return to the cleaned up apartment one night, they are too uncomfortable to stay there and spend the night at a motel where Jimmy tells Kim that they will go on with their lives as if nothing happened, but Kim stays silent.\n\nJimmy and Kim visit HHM where a memorial service for Howard is taking place. They talk with Richard, who tells them that due to Howard’s death, the law firm is downsizing, switching locations and is changing the name. Jimmy and Kim go to meet Howard’s widow, Cheryl. As they pay their respects, Cheryl firmly asks them if what Howard has been saying before he died is the truth, that Jimmy and Kim have been harassing him and making him look foolish. Jimmy, not wanting to tell her of their hand in Howard’s fate, tries to say that Howard came to their house all drugged up and Kim helps him by fabricating a story of how she witnessed Howard snorting cocaine. After Cheryl leaves in tears, Jimmy and Kim excuse themselves from the law firm and go to the parking garage where Jimmy tries to tell Kim that their troubles are over and they can put this mess behind them. An unresponsive Kim just kisses Jimmy and drives away, leaving Jimmy confused.\n\nJimmy soon finds out that Kim has resigned from her career as an attorney and comes to her in their apartment late at tonight to desperately make her change her mind and throughout this ordeal, he finds out that Kim is leaving him. Kim tearfully tells Jimmy that she just can’t be with him anymore due to the amount of turmoil that has happened. Jimmy at first writes off Howard’s death as Lalo’s doing, but Kim confesses that she was aware that he was alive for a while now and she chose to keep it secret because she knew Jimmy would make them hide and abandon their campaign against Howard if he knew the truth, and also tells him that they are bad for each other due to how much misery they cause for everyone else around them. Kim resumes packing her bags while Jimmy is left sadly standing in place. With Kim's departure, Jimmy had lost everything that kept him grounded; his family, his elder practice, the McGill name, and now Kim. All that was left is Saul Goodman. (\"Fun and Games\")\n\nImmediately following Kim's departure, Jimmy began to fully embrace his criminal Saul Goodman persona as a coping mechanism, fully immersing himself in his work and eventual criminal activity. From the time he wakes up to the time he sleeps, Saul is working an angle or case. In late 2004, months after Kim's departure, Saul treats Kim dismissively as she briefly returns to Albuquerque to sign the divorce papers in his office. She is disturbed at how callous her ex-husband has become, and by the hardened criminals that he is now taking on as his regular clientele. Saul tells Kim that he thinks she'll come to regret not taking her share of the Sandpiper money, telling her it would buy \"a shitload of swampland\". When both Saul and Kim sign the divorce papers, Saul nonchalantly tells Kim to \"have a nice life\" as she leaves, and she later notices that one of Saul's criminal clients, Emilio Koyama, is his next appointment. Outside Saul's office, when asked by Emilio's friend Jesse Pinkman if Saul is a good lawyer, Kim tells him that \"he was when I knew him\" before leaving. (\"Waterworks\")\n\nBy the next year, in 2005, Saul has become very wealthy after he received his share of the Sandpiper money in addition to Kim's share too, as she had chosen not to take her share of the money. He used the money from the Sandpiper settlement to purchase a huge mansion and filled it with extravagant luxuries, and stored several keepsakes of his old life within. Continuing to embrace his alter ego of Saul completely, he is first seen waking up with a prostitute in his bed, which he promptly dismisses, and spends a majority of the morning debating with a contact regarding a potential client who is accused of public masturbation, before going to his law firm. (\"Fun and Games\")\n\nBreaking Bad\n\nBy 2005, Saul eventually coined “Better Call Saul!” as his famous catchphrase and begins an aggressive marketing strategy, filming several low-budget, late night TV ads, recording radio ads, and putting ads featuring his likeness on benches and billboards all over Albuquerque. This caused Saul to become a local celebrity, recognized by a wide range of Albuquerque citizens, including criminal civilians (some of which would become his clients), as well as regular civilians (e.g. Walter White Jr.). Saul regularly sleeps with sex workers and begins sexually harassing his secretary Francesca, whom he has made complicit in his crimes. (\"Wine and Roses\", \"Fun and Games\")\n\nSaul eventually acquires Caldera’s black book, giving him access to a vast criminal network and introducing him to later associates such as Patrick Kuby. He becomes heavily involved with money laundering, purchasing several nail salons to hide his criminal revenue, as well as working with Daniel “Danny” Wormald, a former client and former associate of Mike and Nacho who runs Lazer Base, a local laser tag business that works as a money laundering front. He establishes a loan-out corporation, Ice Station Zebra Associates (a formerly fictional company he and Kim had created for several bar scams they pulled), in addition to an offshore business called Tigerfish Corporation.\n\nMike continues working as a private investigator for Saul, who has become a useful source of information on the criminal landscape of Albuquerque for Gustavo Fring, albeit one kept at an arms length. Saul remains unaware of Gus' true identity, only knowing him as a major drug kingpin and distributor who is extremely competent and careful, only meeting Gus once previously though being unaware that he was a drug kingpin.\n\nBy 2008, Saul has developed a widely known reputation as a criminal lawyer, who successfully helped Emilio avoid criminal charges on two different occasions, causing Jesse to think Kim was right about him being an effective lawyer. (\"Waterworks\")\n\nSeason 2\n\nWhen Brandon \"Badger\" Mayhew is arrested for selling Walt and Jesse's \"Blue Sky\" meth, Saul decides to represent him. As the undercover cop Getz tries to convince Badger to give up his supplier, Saul enters the interview room and dismisses Getz before looking over Badger's case and discussing his retainer fee. When he spots Hank and Gomez, Saul becomes convinced that the DEA must be interested in Badger only if they think he can lead them to bigger fish.\n\nJesse takes Walt to Saul's law office at a strip mall. At Jesse's request, having previously been convinced by Kim to trust Saul as a lawyer, Walt and Jesse decide to hire him as their lawyer, with Jesse explaining to a hesitant Walt that they do not need a criminal lawyer (a lawyer who defends criminals), but a criminal lawyer (a lawyer who is also a criminal). Walt loses a coin toss to determine who will go into Saul's office and pay his retainer fee. Upon entering the office, Walt introduces himself as Badger's uncle \"Mr. Mayhew\". Saul reports that the DEA wants Badger to lead them to a mystery man named Heisenberg. Saul initially insists on making Badger give up Heisenberg, but seems to reconsider when Walt offers him $10,000. Walt has another coughing fit. Upon returning to Jesse's car, Walt reports that Saul kicked him out of the office for trying to bribe him.\n\nLater that night, Jesse and Walt don their ski masks, kidnap Saul, and haul him to a freshly dug shallow grave in a desert wasteland. A terrified Saul presumes that the situation has to do with Lalo's promise that he will be back for answers about what Jimmy knows of Nacho's actions, Saul desperately shouts at the two men that \"it wasn't me it was Ignacio, he's the one!\" and asks if Lalo sent them. However, when Jesse demands that he speak English, a relieved Saul realizes that they have nothing to do with Lalo, with Jesse being confused as to who Saul is talking about. Jesse tells him he should've taken Badger's offer. Saul informs them that he doesn't take bribes from strangers. Jesse, gun aimed at Saul, instructs him to give Badger \"the best legal representation ever,\" but says that Saul is dead if anyone snitches to the DEA. Saul suggests killing Badger, but Jesse insists that's not an option.\n\nAfter recognizing Walt as the \"Mr. Mayhew\" from his office, Saul instructs Walt and Jesse to remove their masks and for each of them to put a dollar in his pocket. Now protected by attorney-client privilege, they hear Saul's assessment of their situation: \"Somebody's going to prison. It's just a matter of who.\" (\"Better Call Saul\") After they pay him for his services, Saul steps back into the RV with Walt and Jesse. Saul takes note of the duo's chemistry equipment, realizing that they make the \"blue stuff\" and that Walt is the man known as \"Heisenberg\". Walt doesn't want to divulge too many details about their operation to Saul, but Jesse doesn't see the point as he is already inside their meth lab. Walt tries to turn the RV's ignition, but it won't start; to avoid overheating the engine, they switch the vehicle off. After an uneasy moment of silence, Jesse asks who the \"Lalo\" that Saul mentioned was; he brushes off the question by saying he's \"nobody\". Walt successfully restarts the RV and the trio drive off into the night. (\"Breaking Bad\") Under questioning from Hank, Badger describes Heisenberg as a middle-aged bald man. Meanwhile, Saul hands Walt the dossier for James Kilkelly, a bald ex-convict known as \"Jimmy In-'N-Out,\" who will willingly allow himself to be put in jail as Heisenberg for a fee. Saul outlines the cost: $80,000 plus a pound of Walt and Jesse's meth. The next day, the DEA and APD stake out the bus stop. Walt and Jesse watch from a distance in Walt's Aztek. Badger arrives on time, but Jimmy is late. Eventually a different bald man sits next to Badger, who doesn't know this isn't Jimmy. When the real Jimmy sits down on a nearby bench, Badger is busy soliciting the wrong man, trying to make the deal. Walt speeds around the block to the bench and makes Jesse intervene. After Jesse exits the car, Walt zips over to the stakeout vehicle to talk to Hank, thereby blocking their view and buy time for Jesse to redirect Badger. Jesse directs Badger to the correct bench and Jimmy's arrest goes down as planned. (\"Better Call Saul\")\n\nSaul lies on his office floor with the Swing Master and takes a call from Francesca about his upcoming schedule. Mike, now Saul's private investigator, steps into the office to update him on several ongoing cases the two are handling. Upon Saul's query, Mike divulges the full names and occupations of Walt and Jesse, and the fact that Walt has terminal lung cancer. Knowing about the chemical purity of Walt's product, Saul is eager to go into business with him. Mike advises against it, telling him that Walt is an amateur who will get himself either caught or killed if the cancer doesn't get him first. Mike continues talking about an unrelated matter, but Saul zones out of the conversation. (\"Breaking Bad\") Saul walks into Walt's classroom at J. P. Wynne High School, chiding him for being easy for Mike to locate. Walt asks if Saul is blackmailing him, but Saul says that he isn't. Saul offers to act as Walt's consigliere in his meth operation, providing him with the right connections and strategy to succeed in the drug trade, ending the conversation with \"If you want to make more money, and keep the money that you make, Better Call Saul!\" (\"Better Call Saul\")\n\nLater on, Saul gives Walt a tutorial on money laundering. After all the costs associated with Badger’s arrest, he only has $16,000 left. Walt lets on that he might not have much longer to live, but he intends to cook a lot more. (\"4 Days Out\"). After one of Walt and Jesse's dealers, Jesse's friend Christian \"Combo\" Ortega, is murdered by an eleven-year old boy under orders from rival dealers from a rival gang, Saul proposes new distribution method for Walt and Jesse's product. Under stress, Jesse tells Jane that he is a drug dealer, though she had already deduced as much. Saul puts Walt in touch with a meth distributor named Gus, a cautious yet successful businessman who is skeptical of Jesse's dependability but agrees to purchase Walt's product. However, Gus expresses concern about Jesse's drug problem, which has escalated into heroin use due to Jane's relapse. Walt receives a large offer for the short-notice delivery of the remainder of their inventory, but at the same time receives a call from Skyler, notifying him of her imminent labor. (\"Mandala\")\n\nAfter successfully selling the thirty-eight pounds to Saul's contact, Walt complains that he cannot make use of the money. Luckily, Saul knows of a hacker in Belarus who could launder Walt's money through his son's \"SaveWalterWhite.com\" website. (\"Phoenix\"). When Jesse's girlfriend, Jane Margolis, dies, Saul sends Mike to clean up her apartment from any evidence linking her and Jesse with the use of drugs. Saul also informs Walt about Jesse living in a crack house nicknamed \"The Shooting Gallery,\" and sends Mike to give Walt a lift to visit Jesse. (\"ABQ\")\n\nSeason 3\n\nIn the wake of the Wayfarer Flight 515 aerial disaster, Saul began organizing a class-action lawsuit for victims of the crash. At one point, Saul says, \"Victims' families would be great, but I'll take anyone on the ground who suffered emotionally.\" Saul also began wearing the Wayfarer 515 blue ribbon to show his support for the air crash victims.\n\nFollowing the success of the large sale to Gus – which leads to Saul buying better suits – Saul pushes Walt to take Gus’s lucrative offer to continue cooking. He also accepts a job from Jesse, using Jesse’s half of the earnings to purchase his aunt’s house at a dramatically lowered price – strong-arming Jesse’s parents and attorney with a potential lawsuit over the undisclosed meth lab Jesse was running out of the basement.\n\nAfter Walt reveals Skyler White has threatened to expose him, Saul hires Mike to bug the White house as insurance. Forced to leave early when Walt comes home, Mike witnesses the Cousins entering with an axe, and quickly places a call to Gus to call them off. Per Gus’s direction, Saul is not informed of this threat to Walt. (\"Caballo Sin Nombre\")\n\nSaul visits Jesse's house later on, asking Jesse to try to convince Walt into going back to cooking meth. (\"I.F.T.\")\n\nMike later brings Walt to Saul after Walt creates a disturbance at Skyler’s office and attempts to talk Walt into cooking meth again. Admitting that he bugged Walt’s house and making an off-color comment about Skyler, Saul is attacked and subsequently fired by Walt. Furious, Saul shuts down the laundering of Walt’s drug money.\n\nJesse then approaches Saul with two bags of meth he has cooked himself using Walt’s procedure and asks to set up a deal. He meets Victor under a bridge to make the exchange, only to see he has been given half of the money – the other half went to Walt. (\"Green Light\")\n\nSaul sets up an intervention between Walt and Jesse, offering to give Walt a percentage of Jesse’s future deals. Walt returns Jesse’s half of the deal's money, coldly informing both of them that he has now accepted Gus’s offer and will be cutting Jesse out of the business. Quickly dumping Jesse in favor of the much higher profits Walt can produce, Saul is once again hired to launder money for Walt – this time for a dramatically-reduced fee of five percent. (\"Más\")\n\nWhen Hank successfully deduces the existence of the RV, Walt calls Saul in a panic. Saul is at a loss, and scolds him for not having a \"self-destruct\" mechanism like the Starship Enterprise. After Hank locates the RV with Walt and Jesse trapped inside, Walt calls Saul for assistance. Saul has his secretary Francesca masquerade as a law enforcement official to make Hank believe his wife has been severely injured in a car accident. Saul appears regretful of his part in the cruel ruse and discards the phone used to make the call, while Francesca tells him she should be paid more for this sort of work. (\"Sunset\")\n\nSaul visits Jesse at the hospital after the latter is brutally attacked by Hank in retaliation of their ruse to lure Hank away from the junkyard. Saul takes pictures of Jesse's injured face and jokes that Walt is now the \"cute one of the group.\" Jesse plans to ruin Hank's life and maybe even give up Heisenberg's identity if he gets caught cooking again. Out of the hospital room, Walt tells Saul that Jesse will eventually calm down, to which Saul replies, \"If he doesn't, there may come a time to talk options\". (\"One Minute\")\n\nSaul later tries to convince Jesse into buying a property to launder his money earned selling drugs, but Jesse declines the offer. (\"Kafkaesque\")\n\nWalt later introduces Skyler to Saul as they have a meeting in Saul's office trying to think in a scheme to launder their money. Saul suggests that they buy a laser tag franchise, but Skyler comments that Walt buying a laser tag arcade wouldn't make any sense. They later drive to a car wash where Walt worked for four years. Skyler comments that since Walt has history with this car wash, it would make even more sense for him to buy it. Saul thinks otherwise, since they don't have an inside man, and it will be difficult to use the car wash for money laundering (\"Abiquiú\"). Later, Walter comes to Saul to inform him that Jesse found out that the men who killed his dealer and friend some weeks earlier are actually working for Gus, and Jesse is intent on killing them. They plan to get Jesse arrested, but Mike finds out about the plan and intervenes on Gus' orders. (\"Half Measures\")\n\nJesse eventually attacks the dealers against Gus' orders, and Walt saves Jesse's life by killing both dealers. Mike starts a manhunt for Jesse, but Saul helps Walt by hiding Jesse in the laser tag arcade. Mike forces Saul to give him information on Jesse's whereabouts, even threatening to severely injure Saul in case he doesn't collaborate. Saul gives Mike a fake address to keep him away for some hours and then drives Walt to meet Jesse at the arcade. He warns them that it's just a matter of time before Mike realizes that the address is fake, but he is dismissed by Walt. (\"Full Measure\")\n\nSeason 4\n\nFollowing Gale Boetticher's murder, Walt and Jesse are taken to the superlab and held there by Mike and Victor until Gus Fring arrives to deal with the situation. Meanwhile, Saul searches his office for bugs, believing that Walt and Jesse were murdered by Gus and he would be next. He receives a call from Skyler asking where Walt is. Returning her call by payphone, Saul lies and assures her Walt is fine. He then tells Huell that they might need to leave town. (\"Box Cutter\")\n\nLater, after Skyler's unsuccessful attempt to buy the car wash from Bogdan for money laundering purposes, Saul touts a nail salon as the best way to launder money as he meets with Walt and Skyler at the condo.\n\nWhile watching the draining soap suds from washing Holly's baby bottles, Skyler is struck by an idea and calls Saul. Outside the car wash, a man wearing a Bluetooth headset who appears to be some kind of environmental inspector, who is actually a conman, Saul's associate Patrick Kuby, shows water samples to Bogdan and declares they're full of contaminants. He tells Bogdan that he must replace his entire wastewater treatment system, and the state requires he cease operations until it's back up to code. Skyler, feeding lines to Kuby, is eventually successful and purchases the car wash (\"Open House\"). Meanwhile, Walt tells Saul he fears that Hank will connect Jesse to Gale's murder. Saul says there's nothing to worry about, but Walt catalogs his woes: Gus wants to kill him, Jesse is out of control, and Gus will eventually perceive Jesse as too big a risk. There's also the car wash he's buying with Skyler, who naively thinks Walt can walk away after his contract with Gus expires. Saul mentions that as a last resort, Walt can pay to have a \"disappearer\" vanish his family off the grid and set them up with new identities. Walt rejects the idea, and they're stuck at an impasse. (\"Bullet Points\")\n\nLater, when Walter learns Jesse is off somewhere with Mike, Walt races through Albuquerque, dodging traffic while shouting instructions to Saul on his cell phone. If Walt doesn't return within 24 hours, Saul is to deliver all of Walt's money to Skyler (\"Shotgun\"). On a later date, Walt slumps in a chair at Saul's office while Saul handles the fallout from his client's \"little joy ride\" (racing around recklessly, doing doughnuts with, and ultimately setting on fire the Dodge Challenger Skyler made him return). Walt admits that the pressure of knowing Gus wants to kill him is getting to him, and then inquires about hit men. \"Wrong answer!\" blurts Saul, pointing out that any for hire assailant would likely know Mike, and have to outmaneuver him. Walt tells Saul that he tried to kill Gus himself but couldn't get near him (\"Problem Dog\"). Saul visits Andrea Cantillo at a house she's just rented in a nice neighborhood and delivers cash from Jesse. Afterward, in Saul's car, a concerned Jesse asks about the house and Andrea's son, Brock Cantillo. Saul then prods Jesse to check on them himself. (\"Hermanos\")\n\nTed enters Saul's office, and Saul informs him that his long-lost \"Great Aunt Birgit\" from Luxembourg has left him $621,552.33—almost precisely the amount of his debt to the I.R.S., ostensibly a coincidence that Ted seemingly doesn't realize. Saul visits the car wash and shows Skyler a credit report indicating that Ted leased a Mercedes three hours after receiving Walt's money. He won't be able to pay the income tax bill in full—and clearly wasn't going to do so anyway. (\"Salud\")\n\nAt his home, Ted returns Skyler's money to her because paying off the IRS with Walt's gambling winnings \"feels wrong\" and in any case won't solve Ted's other money woes. Skyler accuses Ted of blackmailing her for more cash. Stung by the charge, Ted emphatically denies it but still refuses to pay the IRS. After leaving Ted's house, Skyler calls Saul.\n\nBy phone, Saul informs Skyler that Ted doesn't own a gun or have a panic button on his alarm system. Skyler replies that she doesn't want anyone hurt, just for Ted to write the IRS a check. Saul tells Skyler that he'll assign his \"A-team\" to deal with Ted and sends Kuby and Huell. The two visit Ted at home, order him to write the check, and tell him they'll be staying until it clears. After signing the check, Ted tries to make a run for it but ends up tripping on a throw rug and knocking himself out on the island in his kitchen. (\"Crawl Space\")\n\nIn Saul's office, Huell is describing the mishap with Ted when Walt storms in, saying that he needs to contact Saul's connection who can \"disappear\" the White family and give them new identities. It'll cost at least half a million dollars, says Saul, and everyone must be packed and ready before Walt makes the call (\"Crawl Space\"). Walt asks Saul to inform the DEA that Gus has a hit out on Hank. Saul reluctantly agrees to alert the DEA about the hit but refuse"
