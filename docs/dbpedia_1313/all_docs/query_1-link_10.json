        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning, And History Of Saul\n\nSaul is a male given name of Hebrew origin, which means “ask/question”. The name means “asked, loaned, grave” in the Bible and the Hebrew language.\n\nThe first book of Samuel contains the Chronicle of Saul, the first king of Israel. Before his rule concluded, he fell out of God’s good graces, and David took his place as king following a Philistine victory. His relationship with David was rocky. In addition to attempting to assassinate him, Saul also made his daughters Merab and Michal available as wives for David. This could be why the personal name was unpopular throughout the Middle Ages. The apostle Paul was also known by the Hebrew name Saul in the New Testament.\n\nThe name is well-known among Christians since it was used by St. Paul when he persecuted Christians and later renounced by him when he became a Christian. It could have developed in part as a moniker for someone who had performed as the Biblical monarch in a religious performance. Nonetheless, Saul had an important place among the Israelites.\n\nFamous variations of this name include Saoul (Biblical Greek), Sha’ul (Biblical Hebrew), Sauli (Finnish), Shaul (Hebrew), and Saulius (Lithuanian). The name has been used since 1880 when the US government started keeping track of naming patterns. The Jewish community favors this name, although Christians also appreciate it. Saul is a rather uncommon name because it has never ranked higher than 270 on the US popularity lists.\n\nJimmy McGill, often known as Saul Goodman, is a fictional character played by Bob Odenkirk in the Breaking Bad television series. Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould developed the character. In the Breaking Bad spinoff Better Call Saul, he plays the antihero protagonist and a vital role.\n\nHow To Pronounce Saul?\n\n‘Saul’ In QR Code\n\nNotable People Named Saul\n\nThis section covers people who have made the name Saul famous with their contributions in various fields.
