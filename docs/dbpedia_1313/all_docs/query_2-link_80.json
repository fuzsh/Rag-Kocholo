        "text": "To receive this weekly devotional and other content for your spiritual renewal, subscribe to our new Renew Newsletter.\n\nMemory Verse: Ecclesiastes 9:5\n\nFurther Study: 1 Samuel 25-30; Patriarchs and Prophets, 664-694; The Bible Story, vol. 4, pp. 41-60\n\nI’ve worked for the corporate church for most of my career. Each day when I walk into the Seventh-day Adventist World Headquarters, I feel privileged to be there. It’s satisfying to work with people from around the world committed to sharing God’s message.\n\nYet working for the church comes with consequences. There are some who think that everyone in the building is perfect—one step away from heaven. Obviously this isn’t true. Church employees are human like everyone else, making them sinners too. Just because you’re tasked with accomplishing spiritual things doesn’t mean that all is good and bright. Sometimes it isn’t.\n\nJust because you’re tasked with accomplishing spiritual things doesn’t mean that all is good and bright. Sometimes it isn’t.\n\nThe chapters from 1 Samuel this week are about leadership—David’s compared to Saul’s. We discover David made all the right decisions, while Saul relentlessly pursued David. Eventually Saul chose to consult a spirit medium. But the central point of this narrative comes when David recognized it was not his task to remove Saul. He remembered whom he served.\n\nSaul, God’s anointed, wasn’t acting like the king he was called to be.\n\nSaul, God’s anointed, wasn’t acting like the king he was called to be. It would come as no surprise then if when David was given the opportunity he would remove Saul from office. Likewise, when one works for the church, it often isn’t long before there is an encounter with someone who isn’t well-suited for the job. We certainly don’t think about killing them, but we might take the opportunity to use words in the same way. This isn’t restricted to corporate offices; it happens in churches too. Yet David offers a new perspective—it isn’t ours to touch the Lord’s anointed. They belong to God.\n\nGod is in charge—His timing, His plans, His way.\n\nGod is in charge—His timing, His plans, His way. Saul certainly deserved to be dethroned. It would have solved David’s problem. But David was right. This wasn’t his task or God’s timing. Even when spiritual leaders seem unqualified, unsuited, incompetent, or overbearing—they belong to God. And it’s God’s timing that will preserve His church.\n\nAre you currently in a situation with a pastor or spiritual leader who seems less than effective? Pray. Watch. Listen. Then pray some more. Be patient. Trust in God to show the way, and, like David, discover that the wait will be worth it.\n\nAs we face a new year, discover ways to work with God, not against Him.\n\nAs we face a new year, discover ways to work with God, not against Him. Make it your New Year’s resolution to partner with God and be renewed.\n\nDigging Deeper\n\nOne commentator suggests you can learn a lot about a person in how they react in a crisis.* What do they do? Where do they turn? Notice what we learn about David. And then Saul.\n\nDavid turned to his childhood experiences of God’s protection (1 Samuel 17:34-37)\n\nDavid turned to Samuel (while he was still alive) (19:18-24)\n\nDavid turned to Jonathan (20:1-42)\n\nDavid turned to Ahimelech, the priest at Nob (21:1-9)\n\nWe have no instance of Saul seeking out Samuel, a priest, or any other counsel, until the end when he turned, not to God, but to a spirit medium to seek counsel from a dead prophet.\n\n*Bill T. Arnold, 1 and 2 Samuel, The NIV Application Commentary, p. 376\n\nMaking it Real\n\nTake time to write a letter or email to your pastor this week. Send them words of encouragement. Offer to pray for them (or with them). Often when the pastor needs a place to turn, there are few options. Think of how you can be supportive of their ministry.\n\nNote: If you are the pastor or the pastor is your spouse, how might you practice what to do when found in the midst of a crisis? Practice these so they become second nature. Find your encouragement in the Word of God because you may not be able to rely on your parishioners to do this for you.\n\n_________\n\nMerle Poirier writes from Silver Spring, Maryland, where she works as the operation manager for Adventist Review and Adventist World magazines as well as the designer for KidsView, a magazine for 8-12-year-olds.
