        "text": "The decades-long rise of the nones â a diverse, hard-to-summarize group â is one of the most talked about phenomena in U.S. religion. They are reshaping America's religious landscape as we know it.\n\nIn U.S. religion today, âthe most important story without a shadow of a doubt is the unbelievable rise in the share of Americans who are nonreligious,â said Ryan Burge, a political science professor at Eastern Illinois University and author of âThe Nones,â a book on the phenomenon.\n\nThe nones account for a large portion of Americans, as shown by the 30% of U.S. adults who claim no religious affiliation in a survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nOther major surveys say the nones have been steadily increasing for as long as three decades.\n\nSo who are they?\n\nTheyâre the atheists, the agnostics, the ânothing in particular.â Theyâre the âspiritual but not religious,â and those who are neither or both. They span class, gender, age, race and ethnicity.\n\nWhile the nonesâ vast diversity splinters them into myriad subgroups, most of them have this in common:\n\nThey. Really. Donât. Like. Organized. Religion.\n\nNor its leaders. Nor its politics and social stances. Thatâs according to a large majority of nones responding to the survey.\n\nBut theyâre not just a statistic. They're real people with unique relationships to belief and nonbelief, and the meaning of life.\n\nTheyâre secular homeschoolers in the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas, Pittsburghers working to overcome addiction. Theyâre a mandolin maker in a small Missouri River town, a former evangelical disillusioned with that particular strain of American Christianity. Theyâre college students who found their childhood churches unpersuasive or unwelcoming.\n\nChurch âwas not very good for me,â said Emma Komoroski, a University of Missouri freshman who left her childhood Catholic religion in her mid-teens. âIâm a lesbian. So that was kind of like, oh, I didnât really fit, and people donât like me.â\n\nThe nones also are people like Alric Jones, who could cite bad experiences with organized religion that ranged from the intolerant churches of his hometown to the ministry that kept soliciting money from his devout late wife â even after Jones lost his job and income after an injury. Â\n\nâIf it was such a Christian organization, and she was unable to send money, they should have come to us and said, âIs there something we can do to help you?ââ said Jones, 71, of central Michigan. âThey kept sending us letters saying, âWhy arenât you sending us money?ââ\n\nAlthough he doesnât believe in organized religion, he believes in God and basic ethical precepts. âPeople should be treated equally as long as they treat other people equally. Thatâs my spirituality if you want to call it that.â Â\n\nThese days, if a visiting relative wants to attend church, heâll go along, âbut Iâm not prone to listening to anybody telling me this is the way it should be,â Jones said. Â\n\nAbout 1 in 6 U.S. adults surveyed, including Jones and Dulak, is a ânothing in particular.â There areÂ as manyÂ of them as atheists and agnostics combined (7% each).\n\nâAll the media attention is on atheists and agnostics, when most nones are not atheist or agnostic,â Burge said.\n\nAbout half of nothings in particular say theyâre âspiritual but not religious,â and some say theyâre both.\n\nMany embrace a range of spiritual beliefs â from God, prayer and heaven to karma, reincarnation, astrology or energy in crystals.\n\nâThey are definitely not as turned off to religion as atheists and agnostics are,â Burge said. âThey practice their own type of spirituality, many of them.â\n\nDulak still draws inspiration from nature.\n\nâIt just feels so good to be next to something so timeless,â he said, sitting in his yard beneath a rustling hackberry tree in the Missouri River town he now calls home.\n\nHe finds similar fulfillment in his two-story workshop, where he makes the latest of thousands of mandolins he has created over the decades, enabling people to âshare the joy of music.â Â\n\nâIt feels spiritually good,â Dulak said. âItâs not a religion.â\n\nBurge said the nones are rising as the Christian population declines, particularly the âmainlineâ or moderate to liberal Protestants.\n\nâThis is not just some academic exercise for me,â said Burge, who pastors a dwindling American Baptist church in Mt. Vernon, Illinois. Itâs âwhat Iâve seen every single Sunday of my life the last 16 years.â\n\nThe statistics showÂ the nones are well-represented in every age group, but especially among young adults. About four in 10 ofÂ those under 30Â are nones â nearly as many as say they're Christians.\n\nThe trend was evident in interviews on the University of Missouri campus. Several students said they didnât identify with a religion.\n\nMia Vogel said she likes âthe foundations of a lot of religions â just love everybody, accept everybody.â But she considers herself more spiritual.\n\nâIâm pretty into astrology. Iâve got my crystals charging up in my window right now. Honestly, Iâll bet half of it is a total placebo. But I just like the idea that things in life can be explained by greater forces.â\n\nÂ - Mia Vogel, a student at the UniversityÂ of Missouri.\n\nOne movement that exemplifies the âspiritual but not religiousâ ethos is the Twelve Step sobriety program, pioneered by Alcoholics Anonymous and adopted by other recovery groups. Participants turn to a âpower greater than ourselvesâ â the God of each personâs own understanding â but they donât share any creed.\n\nâIf you look at the religions, they have been wracked by scandals, it doesnât matter the denomination,â said the Rev. Jay Geisler, an Episcopal priest who is spiritual advisor at the Pittsburgh Recovery Center, an addiction treatment site. Â\n\nIn contrast, âthereâs actually a spiritual revival in the basement of many of the churches,â where recovery groups often meet, he said.\n\nFor some, Geisler said, the God of their understanding is âGUS,â for Guy Up Stairs. Or âSAM,â for Sure Ainât Me. Â\n\nâNobodyâs fighting in those rooms, theyâre not saying, âYouâre wrong about God,ââ Geisler said. The focus is on âhow your life is changed.â\n\nParticipants echoed those thoughts recently at the center. In keeping with the Twelve Step tradition of anonymity, they shared their experiences on condition only their first names be used.\n\nâI grew up Methodist, but I donât follow any religion,â said John, 32. âI donât believe in a big, bearded dude in the sky.â But after surviving overdoses, he knows that âsomething has been watching over me.â Â\n\nSome identified as Christian, but skip evangelizing in favor of supporting each othersâ individual paths.\n\nâI donât push my belief on anybody,â said Linda, 57. âThe pain bonds us.â\n\nAll those interviewed said their new found community is essential to their recovery â and the lack of community contributed to their initial fall into addiction.\n\nScholars worry that, as people pull away from congregations and other social groups,Â they are losing sources of communal support.Â\n\nBut nones said in interviews they were happy to leave religion behind, particularly inÂ toxic situations, and find community elsewhere.Â\n\nJones agreed that church connections can have benefits â but not for him.\n\nâWhen you need references and you need other things, those people are there to support you,â he said. âBut again, what are you willing to sacrifice of your own beliefs to develop that kind of relationship?â\n\nMarjorie Logman, 75, of Aurora, Illinois, now finds community among other residents in her multigenerational apartment complex, and in her advocacy for nursing home residents. She doesnât miss the evangelical circles she was long active in.\n\nâThe farther away I get, the freer I feel,â she said, criticizing churches for prioritizing money over caring for people. Â\n\nShe said sheâs seen church leaders tell people with depression their problem was sin or demonic possession â piling guilt upon unaddressed mental illness. She has been dismayed by churches suppressing cases of sexual misconduct.\n\nLogman said when she was recovering from an injury at a nursing home in 2010, her husband was âhome by himself in despairâ and died before she could return home. She said her pastor refused her request to visit him because he hadnât been involved in church.\n\nShe now identifies as agnostic. âIâm not throwing in the towel on everything,â she said. âI still believe in a higher consciousness.â\n\nNones are finding community even in places far from the urban centers.\n\nAdria Cays and Ashley Miller, who live in nearby towns in northwest Arkansas, helped found a group for parents homeschooling according to secular principles. The group has organized mutual support and regular activities. Â\n\nEven in a predominately Christian region of the Ozarks, they found âpeople like us who were approaching education and just raising their children from a more secular view,â said Miller, 35.\n\nCays and Miller also regularly share their familiesâ hiking adventures throughout the Ozarks on Instagram. While they donât describe their explorations as spiritual, they aim to inspire wonder and purpose in their children.\n\nâWe really want them to have a deep connection to nature and be connected with the changes of the seasons and all of the tiny things that make up an ecosystem,â said Cays, 43.\n\nâWe are part of something bigger, and that is the Earth. There is meaning just in being.â\n\nÂ - Â Ashley Miller, aÂ mother from northwest Arkansas who helped found a group for parents homeschooling according to secular principles.\n\nThe poll of 1,680 adults was conducted May 11-15 using a sample drawn from NORCâsÂ probability-basedÂ Amerispeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.Â Â\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through theÂ APâsÂ collaborationÂ with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.
