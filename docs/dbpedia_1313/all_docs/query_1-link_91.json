        "text": "MANY, if not most, of the major American Realist novelists in the first half of the 20th century were, by birth or breeding, Midwesterners: Theodore Dreiser, Sinclair Lewis, Willa Cather, Ernest Hemingway, F.Scott Fitzgerald. In the second half, a large number of the nation's important writers -- literary critics, journalists and sociologists, as well as novelists -- were Jews. It was Saul Bellow's good fortune -- and the source, perhaps, of a portion of his greatness -- to have been both Midwestern (bred if not born, that happened in Canada) and Jewish.\n\nNot that he put much stock in the determining power of origins or traditions. One of his first literary acts was to alter his name, from Solomon Bellow. But the act of creating a new identity is equally a prerogative of the sons of the heartland and the children of immigrants, and Bellow was almost unique among writers in claiming this double birthright. Recall the first lines of \"The Adventures of Augie March,\" one of the boldest and most memorable beginnings in literature:\n\n\"I am an American, Chicago born -- Chicago, that somber city -- and go at things as I have taught myself, free-style, and will make the record in my own way: first to knock, first admitted; sometimes an innocent knock, sometimes a not so innocent. But a man's character is his fate, says Heraclitus, and in the end there isn't any way to disguise the nature of the knocks by acoustical work on the door or gloving the knuckles.\"\n\nA bit later, Augie says, \"My own parents were not much to me,\" making clear that this will be his story, a story of self making rather than of inheritance. The freedom and self-confidence blowing through these sentences -- the bluster, the slightly show-offy diction, the chutzpah -- marked the beginning of something new for Bellow and also for the American novel. \"Augie March\" was his third book but his first fully to deserve the adjective Bellovian, a word able to encompass both the vulgarity of big cities and the wisdom of Greek philosophers. In \"The Victim\" and \"Dangling Man,\" composed under the influence of European existentialism and in the shadow of World War II, the protagonists are hemmed in and hung up, anxious and abused, anything but the masters of their own fates.\n\nAugie and the men (and they were always men) who followed were not case studies or allegories but vital, unmistakable individual characters in both the literary and the vernacular senses of the word. They could be annoying, self-deluded, neurotic, impossible in a hundred different ways, but they were always real, and the novels that sustained Bellow's reputation bore their names: \"Herzog,\" \"Henderson,\" \"Mosby,\" \"Sammler,\" \"Humboldt,\" \"Ravelstein.\""
