Thatâs well over three thousand services.\n\nI'm grateful for my heritage. My mother was a church organist for twenty-five years in a small Presbyterian church. Her grandfather was a Presbyterian pastor, her mother spent seventy-nine years in great-grandfather McGrath's church, and her sister has worshiped there for ninety-two years â ever since she was born.\n\nNonetheless, such long term religiosity has its risks. Boredom. Cliches. Jargon. Cynicism. Merely going through the motions, however well intended. Plus, anyone who has gone to church for sixty years and has paid attention has honest questions about complex issues. For his part, my father quit church when I was in high school. I have my own critical questions, but Iâve decided to do my doubting within the community of faith, and my believing within the broader cultural conversation.\n\nAt about this same time, I began to notice something brazen, even bizarre, at the church that I attend every Sunday. Itâs always been there, and in some form has a history as old as the gospel itself. So, it was nothing new, but for some reason it suddenly grabbed my attention, and ever since then has not let go.\n\nMy Episcopal church is in many ways quite old school. The building has a steeple and stained glass. The priests wear robes. We even have a paid organist. And week after week we do what churches have done for two millennia. We sing a few hymns, we pray for each other and the world, we listen to a sermon, we celebrate communion, at the end come the announcements, and then we go drink coffee on the patio. A sort of standard operating procedure for a churchy church.\n\nBut thereâs one part of our religious routine that now feels like a gut punch. Itâs something akin to street theater, or performance art, and strategically placed at the centerpoint of the service.\n\nThe service begins at the back of the church with a processional down the center aisle. First comes whatâs called a verger, who leads our little line of clergy. Then thereâs a teenage acolyte who carries our local church banner, complete with red ribbons and tinkling bells. The last person in line, very much in a conspicuous pride of place, is a priest who holds high overhead a large and bright red book. These are the four gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.\n\nWhen they reach the front of the church, they place the red book on the altar, they bow to this book, and then sit down. After a few prayers and a hymn, thereâs a reading from the Jewish âoldâ testament, a psalm that our choir sings a capella, and a reading from one of the epistles. Thereâs a lot of reading the Bible out loud in my churchâa lost art in our culture, and ironically counter-intuitive when you consider that weâre very much a âliberalâ church. Then, during the middle of the next hymn, we repeat the processional in reverse.\n\nOnce again the acolyte holds the gospel aloft, walks back down the center aisle, and stops in the physical center of the church. The congregation turns toward the text. As the acolyte opens the book in front of her, the priest makes a tiny sign of the cross on her forehead, lips, and chestâcommending her mind, her speech, and her heart to the reading of this text. She then proclaims, âthe holy gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.â The congregation responds, âGlory to you, Lord Christ.â Â\n\nAfter reading the gospel passage thatâs assigned for that Sunday, she takes the book from the acolyte and again holds it high overhead, and then concludes, âthe gospel of the Lord!â The congregation responds, âPraise to you, Lord Christ.â The priest and the acolyte then retrace their steps to the front, place the gospel back on the altar, and again genuflect before it.\n\nIf I really want to feel the liturgical fire, I sit in a seat thatâs right on the center aisle, positioned perfectly so that I could touch the priest and that text, physically closer than a comfortable psychological space between two people, and in so doing try to fathom exactly whatâs going on. Except for the reading, which ricochets off the hard surfaces of the interior of the church, you could hear a pin drop.\n\nWhen I watch this liturgical drama about a book, so full of symbolism both verbal and physical, I want to shout, âStop! Wait! Whatâs going on here? What are we saying and doing and meaning with this huge, bright red book? And why? We wouldnât bow down to a volume of Sappho or Shakespeare, would we, however venerated?â\n\nÂ\n\nThe public reading of the gospel invites us to reconsider, each and every Sunday, and with as much brutal honesty as we can muster, exactly what the âgood newsâ of âour Lord Jesus Christâ means, and why we donât just salute or honor him but offer to him our praise and worship. Weâre exploring over and over again the heart of the gospel and the core of our faith. In addition, weâre imagining our own selves into his ancient story, and trying to understand and shape our contemporary lives in light of it.\n\nAfter the Jesuit priest John Dear met Daniel Berrigan in 1984, he asked him for a piece of advice. âMake your story fit into the story of Jesus,â said Berrigan. âAsk yourself: does your life make sense in light of the life of Jesus? All we have to do is close our eyes to the culture and open them to our friends. We have enough to go on. We canât afford the luxury of despair.â\n\nThis book is an invitation to a conversation. Itâs an ancient conversation about the story of Jesus that has been contested from its beginnings, and always will be contested. Itâs about how our contemporary stories might make sense in light of his ancient story thatâs read aloud every single day in churches all over the world.\n\nTwo thousand years ago in Palestine, a Jewish sect of downwardly mobile people made a preposterous claim. Although they were at first incredulous disbelievers themselves, they later insisted that a dead man named Jesus had been raised to life, and that in him God had destroyed death and reconciled the cosmos to himself.\n\nOnly thirty years later, his movement had so many followers in Rome, 1500 miles northwest of Jerusalem, that secular historians at the time recorded how the emperor Nero scapegoated them. A generation after Nero, the emperor Trajan received a letter from his governor in Turkey, who was fretting about public policies. Was torturing Christians acceptable? What about tracking down adherents based upon anonymously circulated lists of names? What constituted a reliable renunciation of faith? Governor Pliny wrote to Trajan that he was worried about the âcontagious superstitionâ because it was spreading like wildfire and included people of every rank and age.\n\nToday Christianity is the worldâs largest religion, with over two billion adherents. And two thousand years later it still has many detractors. Moreover, itâs only one voice in a much larger global conversation that those first Christians could not have imagined. Our contemporary conversation includes 150 mega-religions that have at least a million adherents each, plus another four thousand distinct faiths.\n\nThere are also non-religious narratives with powerful voices in todayâs conversation. Science tells a most compelling but strictly limited story. Many atheists co-opt the story of science in an effort to burnish the credentials of their own worldview. Having lived in the Silicon Valley since 1995, I can say with confidence that technology promises a gospel of salvation, even a utopia. American exceptionalism, Russian nationalism, and Islamic terrorism are only a few of our many political narratives today.\n\nHuman beings have always been meaning-makers. We need stories, explanatory narratives, or what Joseph Campbell called myths. They define an essential part of what it means to be human, so much so that itâs impossible for us to live without them. Stories help us to consider the most important questions that anyone can ask, like the search for significance, the meaning of the material world, the nature of good and evil, the responsibility of community, and the struggle for life in a world of death. Stories help us to make sense of a complex world.\n\nThe Christian story has shaped my life since I was baptized as a baby in 1955 by my motherâs grandfather, that Presbyterian pastor in Ohio. In the sixty years since then, Iâve worked and worshiped from different perspectives within my Christian tradition.\n\nAfter finishing graduate school in 1985 with a dissertation on the French sociologist Jacques Ellul (1912-1994),[1]Â I spent six years as a professor at a tiny Christian college in Michigan, where I was very much a âliberal.â I then spent four years as a visiting professor at the massive Moscow State University, where I was very much a âconservativeâ âan American Protestant in the land of Russian Orthodoxy, teaching in the Department of Scientific Atheism, in what was still the communist Soviet Union.[2]\n\nAfter ten years as a professor, I spent eight years as a campus minister at Stanford University with a Christian organization called InterVarsity. My colleague and I worked with graduate students, and then in the fall of 1997 I started three faculty fellowships that met on a weekly basisâone in the faculty club, another one in the Bing Dining Room of the hospital, and a third one for physicists at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.\n\nAfter that, on June 23, 2004, with the help of many friends, I launched a âweekly webzine for the global churchâ called Journey with Jesus, and so I began to write full time for a digital audience. That was fifteen years and over seven million pageviews ago.\n\nThe centerpiece of JwJÂ has always been a weekly essay based upon the Revised Common Lectionary, weekly book and film reviews, and some poetry. I didnât know it when I started, but JwJÂ forced me into a weekly discipline of reading, writing, and thinking in conversation with a broad diversity of global voices. For example, Iâve reviewed over seven hundred books in over a dozen subject categories, and films from 106 countries.[3]Â London has always been the city with the most JwJ readers, followed by New York City. In an average month we serve readers in 140 countries (Google Analytics).\n\nMy church life has likewise been varied. I grew up as a Presbyterian. In Russia we attended the Moscow Protestant Chaplaincy, a church of expatriates from thirty countries that was about 30% African. In Palo Alto we have spent fourteen years in a Presbyterian megachurch, and ten years in an Episcopal church. Along the way Iâve traveled in forty countries, and backpacked three pilgrimages with my wifeâthe Camino SantiagoÂ in Spain (2012), LeÂ Chemin du PuyÂ in southern France (2014), and La Via di FrancescoÂ (2016) from Florence to Assisi to Rome.\n\nIn this book I tell the Christian story in conversation with important alternative narratives. In the first chapter I explore the decline of Christian belief in the modern west, and suggest five prerequisites for a meaningful conversation between its defenders and detractors. I then devote successive chapters to the claims of atheism, science, technology, and pluralism. After that, I consider the Christian story from a trinitarian perspectiveâGod as the Father of us all, Jesus as the Son of Adam, and the Holy Spirit as the Breath of all Life.[4]Â I end with an epilogue on the words of Jesus about the renewal of all things. Each chapter concludes with a poem for further reflection, for some things are best and perhaps only said with poetry.\n\nIn this conversation I include voices from Scripture, history, theology, literature, film, poetry, and personal experiences. Sometimes there are points of overlapping agreement with alternate stories, and at other times irreconcilable differences. At Stanford Iâve also been surprised at the profound ignorance of some otherwise very smart people about basic questions. Tired stereotypes and stale cliches are a chronic threat to clarity. Some people are so hostile to the Christian story, sometimes for good reasons, that thereâs no conversation to be had with them.\n\nDavid Foster Wallace once observed that we live in an environment of Total Noise. To borrow language from our engineering friends, in this book Iâm searching for the gospel signal amidst the cultural noise. I offer what the apostle Paul called a defense and confirmation of the story of Jesus amidst the marketplace of many other alternatives.[5]\n\nFor further reflection\n\nEmily Dickinson (1830â1886)\n\nTell it Slant\n\nTell all the Truth but tell it slant â\n\nSuccess in Circuit lies;\n\nToo bright for mind's infirm intent,\n\nThe Truth's superb surprise.\n\nAs Lightning to the Children eased,\n\nWith explanation kind;\n\nThe Truth must dazzle gradually,\n\nOr every man be blind.\n\nFamous as an eccentric recluse who lived much of her life in isolation in Amherst, the American poet Emily Dickinson wrote some 1800 poems, only a handful of which were published during her lifetime. For 1100 of Dickinsonâs poems, see Cristanne Miller, editor, Emily Dickinsonâs Poems as She Preserved ThemÂ (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2016), 845pp. The 2017 film âA Quiet Passionâ is a biographical take on Dickinson.\n\nChapter One\n\nA Contested Story\n\nFaith Interrupted\n\nFor many people in the west today, Christian faith has become problematic, if not impossible. This observation isnât true for most of the world, which is and always has been robustly religious, but itâs true for people who live in Europe and North America. Itâs certainly true where I live, about a mile from Stanford University in California, where itâs a commonplace to believe that elite science and authentic faith are incompatible. What used to be a common narrative shared by most people has become a contested story.\n\nIn the (post) modern and secular west, many people wonder if religion still matters, and, in the off chance that it does, what shape it might take today compared to its past traditional forms. Scholars debate the extent to which society has been secularized, but many ordinary people nonetheless sense that our culture is increasingly characterized by unbelief. They resonate with the cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett of Tufts University, who twenty years ago compared religious faith to a childish fable like believing in Santa Claus, something that an âundeluded adultâ could never believe. Dennett called himself an enlightened âbright,â and for two decades now has forcefully argued for a strictly materialist view of the world and even human consciousness.[6]Â Â\n\nMany important opinion-makers in our universities, science, technology, media, and entertainment are what the German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768â1834) called the âcultured despisers of religion.â Sometimes their unbelief is characterized by the benign neglect of something thatâs considered harmless. At other times, thereâs an active hostility toward religion that is construed as an obstacle to human progress. In this view, religion is the domain of the uneducated, downwardly mobile, and culturally marginal people who donât know any better.\n\nFor about two hundred years, since the time of the French Revolution and the earliest beginnings of the United States, there has been an active âde-Christianizationâ of western culture. In France, this was a horribly violent process, both physically and mentally, in the cause of a secular âliberation.â In the former Soviet Union, where I lived for four years from 1991 to 1995, and which had been a deeply Christian country for a thousand years, atheist communism closed 98% of the Orthodox churches, 1,000 monasteries, and 60 seminaries. Between 1917 and the start of World War II, 50,000 Orthodox priests were slaughtered. Historians cite similar figures for the aggressive and comprehensive persecution of the church during the French Revolution or in Nazi Germany.\n\nToday, Europeâs magnificent cathedrals are mostly empty on Sunday mornings. When I was at Oxford University in October of 2003, I attended the Evensong service at Magdalen College Chapel (founded in 1458) every night for two straight weeks. Except for the priest, the boys choir, and a handful of tourists, there was almost no one there. Anyone who has traveled in places like Scandinavia, Germany, or France could tell similar stories.[7]\n\nCompared to the long history of Europe, the United States is still a young and religious country, with about seventy percent of its people identifying themselves as Christian. Â But that also means that about 100 million Americans are non-Christian, including rising numbers of people of other faiths. More Americans are becoming less religious in their beliefs and practices than ever before. This is especially true among the Millennial generation of young adults. Consider these three trends from the social sciences.\n\nSince their peak in the 1950âs, thereâs been a dramatic decline in membership among the âmainlineâ Protestant denominations, which, since the founding of the United States, have been home for the majority of American Christians.[8]Â A sad and symbolic reminder of this demise is the former home office of the National Council of Churches, the ecumenical organization that represents about forty mainly mainline denominations. The NCC was a founding, anchor tenant at the 19-story Interchurch Center that was built in 1958 at 475 Riverside Drive in Manhattan, overlooking the Hudson River. After occupying multiple floors with a massive bureaucracy for over fifty years, in 2013 the NCC vacated the building and consolidated its drastically downsized organization to its Washington, DC office.\n\nRoman Catholics, who make up about twenty percent of the American population, face similar demographic losses. They are declining in absolute numbers and as a percentage of the population. In its 2014 study called âAmericaâs Changing Religious Landscape,â the Pew Research Center reported significant decreases among American Catholics. About six Catholics leave the church for every one convert who joins, which means that itâs losing more members at a faster rate than any other denomination.[9]Â\n\nAccording to Georgetown University's Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, American Catholicism has experienced dramatic losses since 1965. The number of priests has dropped about 36%, from 58,600 to 37,200. In 1965, 549 parishes did not have a resident priest; in 2016 that number was 3,499. During the same fifty-year period, the number of âgraduate level seminariansâ dropped from 8,325 to 3,520. There were 179,954 âReligious Sistersâ (nuns) in 1965. Today there are 47,170, a decline of over 70%.[10]Â\n\nNor does it help when of the countryâs most prominent intellectuals, who is also one of Catholicismâs most fierce critics and devoted members, refers to popes and priests as a âfailed traditionâ and a much later addition to the original Jesus story that Catholics could do without.[11]\n\nThird, and more broadly still, Pew reported that the percentage of Americans who say that they are âabsolutely certainâ that God exists has dropped from 71% in 2007 to 63% in 2014. Of special interest are a relatively new demographic group called the ânonesââreligiously unaffiliated people who donât identify with any group, including but not limited to atheists and agnostics. The vast majority of nones (78%) were raised in religious homes. They now account for 23% of adult Americans, up from 16% in 2007. That makes them larger than Catholics, significantly larger than mainline Christians, and almost as large as Protestant evangelicals.[12]\n\nRobert Jones of the Public Religion Research Institute has documented similar demographic losses. Most notable is his research that shows that these declines now include white evangelical Protestants, a group that was once thought to be an exception to the trends. In 2008 they comprised about 21% of the population, whereas by 2015 that figure had dropped to 17%. The conservative Southern Baptist Convention, the largest evangelical Protestant denomination in the country, has reported nine straight years of declining growth rates.[13]Â\n\nIn addition to these observations from history and social science, thereâs also anecdotal evidence for Â an erosion of Christianity in the west. In the fall of 1997, when I started three faculty fellowships at Stanford University as a campus minister for InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, one professor expressed his amazement at our first meeting: âI never knew there were this many Christian professors at Stanford!â he exclaimed. Â âMany,â in this context, was still a tiny minority of the entire university, but even that tiny minority was more than he expected.\n\nHarvey Cox might have discovered the Nones before demographers coined that term. His course at Harvard called Jesus and the Moral LifeÂ was so successful that the president took him to lunch to discover why. Cox described his students as \"dissatisfied seekers\" who had a genuine interest in spirituality if not religion. He says that they despaired of conservative, self-assured, and smug literalists on the one hand, and \"wimpy 'well whatever' laxity\" on the other. Most of his students were \"benevolent but uncomfortable relativists\" who longed for a better alternative.[14]\n\nSimilarly, Marcus Borg of Oregon State University described how his university students had a uniformly negative image of Christianity. When he asked them to write a short essay about their impressions of Christianity, Borgâs students consistently used five adjectives. They viewed Christians as literalistic, anti-intellectual, self-righteous, judgmental, and bigoted. David Kinnaman and Gabe Lyons reached similar conclusions in their own book, that âit would be hard to overestimate how firmly people reject â and feel rejected byâChristians.\"[15]\n\nHonest QuestionsÂ\n\nPeople lose faith for all sorts of reasons, some of them quite understandable.[16]Â My own father never said why he left the church. The appalling carnage of two world wars in âChristianâ Europe made many people question religionâover 100 million deaths from war, disease, and famine.\n\nDuring his last two years of college at Princeton, the American political philosopher John Rawls (1921â2002) considered studying for the Episcopal priesthood. That was before he fought in World War II as an infantryman, and saw Hiroshima after it had been bombed. A friend died in the war. After the war, Rawls was deeply shaken to learn about the Holocaust.\n\nThe war made Rawls doubt any connection between human prayer and divine providence: \"How could I pray and ask God to help me, or my family, or my country, or any other cherished thing I care about, when God would not save millions of Jews from Hitler?\" In the end, Rawls lost his Christian faith. He found it impossible to reconcile some ostensible perfect will of God with the brutal realities of human history.[17]Â\n\nIn the name of God's love Christians have slaughtered Muslims, Jews, and Native Americans. We have humiliated and exploited slaves, women, and gays. Clerical pedophilia has devastated thousands of families. And whether Orthodox, Catholic or Protestant, Christians have persecuted each other with cruelty. Itâs understandable that many people want nothing to do with such religious hypocrisy.\n\nHypocrisy has in turn caused some people to reject organized religion and its bureaucratic institutions. Some of the ânonesâ in the Pew survey described their interest in religion as personal but not institutional. âI no longer believe in organized religion,â said one respondent. âI donât attend services anymore. I just believe that religion is a very personal conversation with me and my creator, and I donât need church for that.â The Episcopal priest and professor Barbara Brown Taylor says that she left the institutional church in order to save her faith.[18]\n\nFor many people, the church hasnât dealt honestly or credibly with important questions. Instead, some Christians have defended the dubious, like the theory of a young earth, or that being gay is a choice rather than a neurobiological inheritance. The distinguished professor Bart Ehrman of UNC Chapel Hill made a radical break with his religious past due in part to superficial responses to his intellectual doubtsâ in his case, from growing up as a conservative evangelical to what he now calls agnostic atheism.[19]As we shall see, these intellectual doubters often appeal to science as incompatible with religion.\n\nStill others leave church because they find it mediocre or boring. Annie Dillard once described her ambivalent church experience in a memorable passage: \"Week after week I was moved by the pitiableness of the bare linoleum-floored sacristy which no flowers could cheer or soften, by the terrible singing I so loved, by the fatigued Bible readings, the lagging emptiness and dilution of the liturgy, the horrifying vacuity of the sermon, and by the fog of dreary senselessness pervading the whole, which existed alongside, and probably caused, the wonder of the fact that we came; we returned; we showed up; week after week, we went through it.\"[20]Â Dillard stayed in church, but many people today consider it a culturally irrelevant institution thatâs living only in its own echo chamber, and as portrayed in movies like Babetteâs FeastÂ (1987), ChocolatÂ (2000), and Paul Schraderâs First ReformedÂ (2017).\n\nSecularization has been so effective that some people have never had any faith to lose. The English novelist Julian Barnes says that he has never attended a church service in his life, and that he was raised in a family that didnât want any of that âreligious mumbo jumbo.â I found this lifelong lack of religion to be true among my students at Moscow State University in the former Soviet Union, where I taught in the âDepartment of Scientific Atheismâ from 1991 to 1995. People often told me that they had never experienced any religious faith, never felt any need for it, and didnât have any interest in it.\n\nAny church that wants to survive today will have to address reasons like these for why people leave institutional Christianity. Having said that, we need to consider the contested story of Christian faith within a broader historical context.\n\nDetractors\n\nCriticisms of Christianity didnât begin with Voltaire and the Enlightenment philosophesÂ two hundred years ago, much less today. Dennettâs sarcasm is nothing new. From the earliest beginnings of the Christian story, there have always been doubters and detractors, including some of the closest followers of Jesus. The Christian story has always and everywhere been a contested story.\n\nOnly our modern hubris, what the British historian EP Thompson called \"the enormous condescension of posterity,\" could believe that not until today â finally! â have we advanced to a level of critical inquiry like no one before us. C.S. Lewis similarly called our self-congratulatory fixation on the most modern a form of âchronological snobbery.â Critical questions about the gospel, and thoughtful responses to them, are as old as the faith itself.\n\nJesus was a cause for controversy beginning with his birth. Simeon prophesied to Mary that her baby would be \"a sign to be opposed.\" Jesus was rejected by his hometown of Nazareth, the people of Capernaum ran him out of town, and a Samaritan village wouldn't even let him enter their town. In Johnâs gospel, we repeatedly read how \"the people were divided because of Jesus.\" His detractors said that he was demon-possessed and \"raving mad.â His own family tried to apprehend him as insane. His brothers didn't believe in him. \"Many\" of his closest disciples quit following him. The religious elite \"opposed him fiercely.\"\n\nIn the end, Rome executed Jesus as a politically subversive criminal. Lukeâs passion narrative is revealing. Luke says that Jesus was executed for three reasons: âWe found this fellow subverting our nation, opposing payment of taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a King.â In Johnâs gospel, the angry mob warned Pilate, âIf you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be king opposes Caesar.â[21]Â Herein are the origins of the charges that the first Christians were politically seditious. Twenty years after Jesus died, critics complained that his followers undermined the values of Roman society.\n\nIn Philippi, a mob dragged Paul and Silas before the city magistrates, then had them stripped, beaten, flogged, and imprisoned: \"These men are throwing our city into an uproar by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice.â In Thessalonica, \"some bad characters from the marketplace\" dragged Jason and some fellow believers before the city officials, shouting, âThese men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come hereâ¦ They are all defying Caesar's decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.â\"[22]\n\nThis harsh opposition to a divisive Jesus reverberates throughout the New Testament. Peter called Jesus \"the stone of stumbling and the rock of offense.â Writing to the Corinthians, Paul called Jesus the foolishness of God, a stumbling block to Jews, and a laughingstock to Gentiles. When Paul made his defense (apologia) before Festus, Luke says that the king scoffed that he was mad.\n\nIn the decades after these original events, we find more derisive dismissals of Christians, questions about public policy, and even whether Christians could be good Roman citizens. After a period of invisibility because of their insignificance, it wasnât long before believers had made such a social impact that they provoked scorn from the highest levels of society. Here are four examples from our earliest sources.\n\nIn his biography of the emperor Nero, the Roman historian Suetonius (75â160) mentions with contempt how âpunishment was inflicted on the Christians, a set of people adhering to a novel and mischievous superstition.â Nero seems to have blamed the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD on the Christians.[23]\n\nThe Roman senator and historian Tacitus, writing around the year 116, refers to the crucifixion of Jesus by Pontius Pilate, the sizeable number of Christians who were already living in Rome, and their torture by Nero. Tacitus sneered at the \"pernicious superstitions\" of the believersâwhat he calls âa class hated for their abominations.â He believed that they deserved their punishment. He also admits that they were a convenient scapegoat for the ârefined crueltyâ of the sadistic Neroâlike being sewn into animal skins and thrown to ravenous dogs, or burned as human torches at night. Â Ironically, this hatred toward the nascent movement turned to pity, says Tacitus, because it was clear that the persecutions were ânot for the welfare of the state, but due to the savagery of a single man.â[24]Â\n\nPliny the Younger ruled Pontus-Bithynia (modern Turkey) as governor from 111â113. In a brief exchange of two letters with the emperor Trajan back in Rome, he expressed frustration about how to prosecute Christians, especially because they comprised a considerable portion of his populace from every walk of life. He described to Trajan his ad hoc policy, and one case in particular. \"I judged it so much the more necessary to extract the real truth, with the assistance of torture, from two female slaves, who were styled deaconesses, but I could discover nothing more than depraved and excessive superstition. I therefore adjourned the proceedings, and sought immediately your counsel. For the matter seemed to me well worth referring to you especially considering the numbers endangered. Persons of all ranks and ages, of both sexes, are and will be involved in the prosecution. For this contagious superstition is not confined to the cities only, but has spread through the villages and rural districts; it seems possible, however, to check and cure it.\"[25]Â\n\nPliny doesnât specify the crimes of the Christians. Heâs less concerned about what he considers a harmless fable than that it is spreading far and wide, and disrupting Roman ways. He also expresses his discomfort with an âanonymous document containing the names of many persons.â Nonetheless, after three interrogations, and the opportunity to recant, he executed those Christians who maintained their faith. And so, he asks Trajan whether his practices constituted sufficient due process.\n\nIn his own short letter, Trajan supported Plinyâs âproper procedure,â then clarified four matters. Pliny should not actively hunt down believers, but if a person admitted to being a Christian, that was enough to warrant punishment. Christians could be pardoned if they convincingly renounced their faith, by worshipping Romeâs gods and the image of the emperor with wine and incense. Finally, Trajan insisted that anonymous accusations âhave no place,â for they were âboth a dangerous kind of precedent and out of keeping with the spirit of our age.â So, the believers were not tracked down, and accusations couldnât be anonymous, but, on the other hand, merely confessing oneâs Christian faith in a public way was crime enough to be executed.\n\nA generation later, in the most comprehensive attack on Christianity until then, a Greek philosopher from Alexandria named Celsus (fl.175) combined socioeconomic snobbery with intellectual elitism to deride Christians: \"In some private homes we find people who work with wool and rags, and cobblers, that is, the least cultured and most ignorant kind. Before the head of the household they dare not utter a word. But as soon as they can take the children aside or some women who are as ignorant as they are, they speak wonders...If you really wish to know the truth, leave your teachers and your father, and go with the women and the children to the women's quarters, or to the cobbler's shop, or to the tannery, and there you will learn the perfect life. It is thus that these Christians find those who will believe them.\"[26]Â This sounds like some contemporary critics, only two millennia earlierâthe Christian story is a childish fable for the ignorant and the downwardly mobile masses.\n\nDefenders\n\nJust as there were detractors from the very beginning, there were also defenders of the faith. Whether on the margins or in the mainstream of culture, Christians have always engaged their critics over their contested story. As one might expect, Peter and Paul led the way in this defense of the good news.\n\nThe epistle of 1 Peter was written about sixty years after Jesus, so the recipients of the letter were second generation Christians. The first verse of the letter indicates that itâs a circular letter written to Gentile believers who lived in five Roman provinces a thousand miles east of Rome, in what is now north-central Turkey.\n\nThe author writes from Rome, but he doesn't use the word \"Rome.\" Rather, he uses the politically provocative code word \"Babylon.\" It's hard to imagine a more derogatory epithet than the ancient empire that conquered and subjugated God's people back in 586 BCE. John similarly disparages Rome as \"the Great Babylon, the mother of whores, and of the abominations of the earth who is drunk with the blood of the saints.\"[27]\n\nLike the author of the epistle, the recipients lived on the fringes of their culture. Three times the letter characterizes them as \"strangers and aliens\" to Rome's polytheistic paganism. He calls them a \"scattered\" people, a diaspora that lived a life of exile. They belonged not to Rome but to their own âpeculiar people and nation.\" These believers didn't conform to the social conventions of the day. The author describes them as \"maligned\" and \"reviled.\" Even \"the name\" Christian was offensive to their detractors (cf. Pliny above). The letter is thus addressed to âfolks who do not belong, who eke out their lives on the periphery of acceptable society, whose deepest loyalties and inclinations do not line up very well with what matters most in the world in which they live.\"[28]\n\nDespite their disenfranchisement, Peter is insistent. He rejects the charge that the earliest believers followed âcleverly invented tales.â He calls his readers to engage their critics. In fact, he says that itâs incumbent upon every believer âalways to be ready to make a defense (apologia) to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence.â[29]Â Those words echo down to believers today.\n\nThen there is Paul, who logged some 10,000 miles spreading the good news of Godâs love. At least ten times in Acts and the epistles, we read how Paul made his âdefenseâ or apologiaÂ before the Jews, Gentiles, public audiences of all sorts, and civil magistrates. Writing from a Roman prison where he was awaiting trial, he told the Philippians that he was appointed by God âfor the defense (apologia) and confirmation of the gospel.â\n\nWhen Paul landed at the ancient city of Athens, he followed a set pattern. \"As usual,â writes Luke, he went to the synagogues and âreasonedâ with the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks.\n\nAfter that, he went to the agoraÂ or the marketplace. Five hundred years before Paul, the Athenian agoraÂ was the center of civic life. It contained residences, religious temples, law courts, government magistrates, the city council, and economic commerce. In Paul's day it included small shopkeepers. \"Day by day\" in the agora, writes Luke, he defended his gospel to those who happened to be there.\n\nIn the agora,Â Paul engaged a group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers who ridiculed him as a spermologos or seed-pickerâthe only occurrence of this word in the Greek New Testament. Translators struggle with this slang word, but whatever the exact meaning, they derided Paul as a babbler, a plagiarist, or a poser. His audience was unimpressed when he spoke about the resurrection of Jesus, and for a specific reason: âHe seemed to be advocating foreign gods.\"\n\nFrom the agora, Paul moved to the Areopagus, which was both a place and a group. It's a small rocky hill northwest of the Acropolis in Athens. The Areopagus was also the most prestigious council of elders in the history of Athens, so-named because it met on that site. Dating back to the 5th-6th centuries BCE, by Paul's day it was a place where matters of the criminal courts, law, philosophy and politics were adjudicated. The intelligentsia there invited Paul to present his \"new teaching\" and \"strange ideas.\"\n\nTheir robust polytheism agitated the Jewish and monotheistic Paul, for it even included an altar with the inscription âTo An Unknown God.â But he met them on their own intellectual ground. He quoted two poets: the Cretan Epimenides (600 BCE), that \"in him we live and move and have our being,\" and then the opening lines of the PhaenomenaÂ by Aratus (315â240 BCE), a Greek poet and Stoic of Cilicia, that \"we are all Godâs children.â As we shall see, a fundamental part of Paulâs message was that God is the father of every person and family.\n\nAs in the agora, so too at the AreopagusâPaulâs apologiaÂ for the resurrection among the intelligentsia elicited a tepid response. Some people \"sneered,\" while others said, \"We want to hear you again on this subject.â Luke ends this story by saying that \"a few people believed,\" including Dionysius, a \"member of the Areopagus,\" a woman named Damaris, who is otherwise unmentioned in the New Testament, \"and a number of other\" women.[30]\n\nThe age of the apostles was followed by the period of the apologists, This tradition of engaging critics of the gospel, in the marketplace with ordinary citizens and among the intelligentsia on their own ground, took root early, and has continued down to our own day. Itâs indicative of how far, how fast, and of how deeply the Christian story spread. Just as the critiques started early and have never stopped, there have always been corresponding apologiasÂ for the contested gospel story.\n\nTrajan wasnât the only Roman emperor to get an earful about the troublesome Christians. Justin the Martyr wrote an ApologiaÂ to Trajanâs successor (after Hadrian), the emperor Antoninus Pius, who ruled from 138 to 161. Justin addressed his defense to Antoninus, the emperorâs sons, the âsacred senate,â and even to âthe whole people of the Romans.â Justin was from a pagan family in Palestine, in what today is Nablus on the West Bank. He came to Rome after his conversion, where he founded his own school.\n\nJustin petitioned Antoninus to investigate the unfair treatment of Christians. Believers, he said, were âunjustly hated and wantonly abused.â Like both Pliny and 1 Peter, he describes how the very ânameâ of being a Christian was cause enough for persecution. He admits that from Romeâs perspective the believers were âatheists,â albeit with his own twist on that word. Justinâs defense seems to have fallen on deaf ears. Around the year 165, at the age of sixty-five, he was beheaded with six of his students by an urban prefect named Junius Rusticus.\n\nA generation after Justin, Clement of Alexandria (150-215) and Tertullian (155-230) of Carthage (modern Tunisia) wrote their own apologiasÂ from the north coast of Africa. Â At the same time, 2500 miles to the northwest in what is now contemporary Lyon, a bishop named Irenaeus (130â202) wrote his book Against Heresies. His work repudiated the gnostics who claimed to have a secret sort of wisdom, as opposed to the gospel that was a public story available to all. Â And a thousand years after that, Aquinas in the thirteenth century wrote his defense of the gospel called Summa contra Gentiles, or \"book on the truth of the Catholic faith against the errors of the unbelievers.\"\n\nBack and forth they went. These attacks and apologies have continued down to our own day. The Christian story has been contested and defended for two millennia. These criticisms of the faith, along with competition between different religions, have pushed and pulled Christians in two directions at the same time.\n\nInternal Tradition, External Boundaries\n\nCriticisms of Christianity have forced its followers to define their own faith, to clarify and develop their own internal tradition. \"Telling, retelling, and refashioning sacred narratives,\" writes Robert Gregg, \"were intentional efforts at reinforcing each community's core beliefs, codes of behavior, and modes of worship.\"[31]Â\n\nTo defend the gospel, to offer an apologia, begs an important questionâwhat is the gospel? That is, what is the indispensable core or essence of Christianity to defend, and what other beliefs might be considered peripheral and of lesser significance? The gospels of Mark and John, for example, include nothing at all about the birth of Jesus. Itâs fascinating to contemplate being part of a Christian community that, in effect, had no Christmas story, but thatâs the legacy of the earliest and latest of the four gospels.\n\nWhat is the internal core or sine qua nonÂ (literally, âwithout which notâ) of the Jesus story, the essential distillation without which it would no longer be what it is? As with the first apologias, we find efforts to identify an âessenceâ of the gospel in the earliest beginnings of the movement.[32]\n\nOne of the earliest summaries of faith was just three words: âJesus is Lord,â which occurs at least three times in the New Testament.[33]Â Today this sounds like a pious and utterly inocuous cliche, but in those earliest days it wasnât just a religious confession, it was also a political subversion: if Jesus was the only sovereign âlord,â then Romeâs caesar was decidedly not lord. As we saw above, the emperors and his defenders clearly understood this.\n\nWhen Paul wrote to the Corinthians, he made a careful distinction. He says that he passed on to them what he himself had received, an oral tradition, or âthe gospel that I preached.â Of âfirst importanceâ in this oral tradition was the affirmation that Christ died for our sins, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day, and that he appeared to Peter, then to the Twelve, and later to many other witnesses. Paul addressed other important matters in his letter to the Corinthians, but compared to this core tradition of âfirst importanceâ they were of a âsecondaryâ nature.[34]\n\nLater still there developed formal creeds, confessions, and catechisms that summarized the core tradition into a precise formula, rule, or canon. The Apostles Creed and the Nicene Creed are good examples that are still recited today by the vast majority of Christians, but these are only two of hundreds of creeds that developed across many and diverse times and places.[35]Â Although creeds can feel like the worst sort of rote repetition, some confessions have saved the very soul of the church, like the Barmen DeclarationÂ (1934) during Nazi Germany and the Kairos DocumentÂ (1985) during apartheid in South Africa. These creeds served as a ârule of faithâ with which to distinguish between the essential and the peripheral matters of faith inside the church community.\n\nCriticisms of the faith also functioned in an externalÂ way, to differentiate and draw boundaries, to oppose and repudiate, to confront one's non-religious and religious competitors. In defending their core beliefs against attacks, in clarifying boundaries and borders, Christians have tried to âscore victories over their opponents' arguments.\"[36]Â\n\nToday this sounds off-putting, and in the worst case scenarios it has led to horrible violence against oneâs religious competitors. But clarifying the differences between other faiths and those of no faith has an important benefitâit belies the contemporary claim that all religions âreally teach the same thing.â To argue that all religions teach the same thing is historically and demonstrably false; that's precisely what they don't do. It might be a âlovely sentiment,â but it is also âdangerous, disrespectful, and untrue.\"[37]Â Â Â\n\nAt the end of his book on five sacred stories that are shared in the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Qur'an, Gregg concludes by flipping our contemporary script with a provocative suggestion: \"Perhaps interreligious conversations in our era would more honestly proceed by taking up difficult and irreconcilable variances in belief and practices, working toward understandingâeven appreciationâof these. Notions of an essential and unbreakable familial closeness and concord that enwraps Jews, Christians, and Muslims are romantic, and also historically false.â[38]\n\nA Way for Today\n\nOur issues in the third millennium are different from those in the third century. Today we wonder about things like gene-editing, not whether we should eat meat that had been offered to pagan idols and later sold in the marketplace.[39]Â In our own day, definitions and defenses of the faith have come from and responded to every sort of intellectual endeavor, and from the highest levels of scholarship.[40]Â Today we must find our own way forward in defining and defending the story of Jesus.\n\nThis book joins the 2,000-year-old conversation about the contested story of Jesus. Itâs a conversation inside the churchâs own communities as it defines and develops the core essence of âmere Christianity.â Itâs also a dialogue outside the churchâs own narrow boundariesâthat dreaded echo chamber where people only talk to themselves. This book thus attempts to be both a reasoned apology to the world and a faithful essence for the church.\n\nA way forward for today, a way to live among our critics and in fidelity to our own tradition, will require five virtues or commitments.\n\nChristians have benefitted from their critics, and should be open to them. When at our best, we have been grateful for them instead of defensive. Contrary to a popular misconception, and despite the headline-grabbing zealotry from all sides, across the centuries there has been a genuine dialogue and not just a monologue between the detractors and the defenders. A healthy conversation among people who differ about important matters begins withÂ gratitude for your partner.\n\nIn addition to openness and gratitude, good conversation requires a spirit of theological modesty. Sanctified common sense dictates such. Who in their right mind, asks Paul, would ever consider himself adequate for the task?[41]Â To speak the unspeakable. To name the Unnameable. The presumption. The audacity. The futility.\n\nIn Exodus 3 God called Moses to return to Egypt, the land of Israel's genocide, to mediate between God and his people, and between God and pharaoh. He appeared to Moses \"in flames of fire from within a bush.\" Mosesâs call was an impossible burden, fraught with ambiguities. At first he responded: \"Here am I!\" But later he wondered, \"Who am I?\" God assured him that \"the people will listen.\" But Moses worried, \"they won't listen.â\n\nSo, he was full of ambivalence, inhibitions, fears, and doubts, and rightly so. As Zornberg puts it, \"there's a certain kind of reticence, or circumspection, that halts the true prophet, faced with the inscrutable God, whose revelation must be narrowed into what can be said.\" And so Moses removed his sandals on that \"holy ground,â and instinctively \"hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.\" Such is the paradox and burden of prophecy, observed Martin Buber: \"It is laid upon the stammering to bring the voice of Heaven to Earth.\"[42]\n\nI honor the wisdom of Peter of Damaskos in the 12th century, that \"St. John Chrysostom says that we do not know wholly even what is given in part, but know only a part of a part.\" Â The apostle Paul wasnât a person lacking in zeal or conviction, but he nonetheless reminded us that on this side of heaven we see through a glass darkly. As one who recently had cataract surgery, I appreciate the power of his metaphor.\n\nBlasphemy and idolatry are the besetting sins of religion, and so in theological modesty I invoke the spirit of CS Lewisâs \"Footnote to All Prayers\":\n\nHe whom I bow to only knows to whom I bow\n\nWhen I attempt the ineffable Name, murmuring Thou,\n\nAnd dream of Pheidian fancies and embrace in heart\n\nSymbols (I know) which cannot be the thing Thou art.\n\nThus always, taken at their word, all prayers blaspheme\n\nWorshiping with frail images a folk-lore dream,\n\nAnd all men in their praying, self-deceived, address\n\nThe coinage of their own unquiet thoughts, unless\n\nThou in magnetic mercy to Thyself divert\n\nOur arrows, aimed unskillfully, beyond desert;\n\nAnd all men are idolaters, crying unheard\n\nTo a deaf idol, if Thou take them at their word.\n\nTake not, O Lord, our literal sense. Lord, in thy great\n\nUnbroken speech our limping metaphor translate.\n\nThird, this book is written in a spirit of ecumenical generosity,Â or what my friend W. David Buschart calls theological hospitality. In the second verse of the Bible, we read that God's Spirit hovers, broods, or flutters over the entire cosmos like a tender mother. Â There is literally no time or place that is void of the Spiritâs presence. He is always and everywhere among us. The wind or breath of God, said Jesus, blows when and where he wills.\n\nThe Jesus movement fragmented into competing cliques early on. Paul's letter to the Corinthians, written about 55 AD, describes deep divisions in the church there. This Christian superiority complex is endemic in the church. Eastern Orthodox believers confess that they alone are \"the one true church of Christ on earth.\" Catholics have claimed that \"outside the church there is no salvation.\" On November 18, 1302, Pope Boniface VIII left no ambiguity when in Unum SanctumÂ he wrote, \"We declare, say, define, and pronounce that it is absolutely necessary for the salvation of every human creature to be subject to the Roman Pontiff.\" The Protestant Reformation fragmented the global church into thousands of denominations, each one claiming to have more magic than the next.\n\nWe should be vigilant about our propensity to exclude people who are different from us. Â When Jesusâ closest followers saw a man casting out demons, they âtold him to stop, because he was not one of us.\"[43]Â That attitude earned a rebuke. Instead of defaulting to our insecurities about those whom we find strange or fringe, to ignorance, fear, and what Buschart describes as \"sincere yet uninformed stereotypes\" of others, we do well to celebrate the considerable diversity that exists among our traditions. After all, he observes, one mark of a cult is \"enforced conformity,\" In theological hospitality we welcome traditions different from our own into our lives with the express intent of learning from them.[44]\n\nThe Yale theologian Hans Frei (1922â1988) thus advocated a âgenerous orthodoxyâ as he urged the church to move beyond the binary liberal-conservative impasse. \"Generosity without orthodoxy is nothing,\" wrote Frei, \"but orthodoxy without generosity is worse than nothing.\"[45]\n\nFourth, this book places itself within a broad, consensual tradition thatâs sometimes calledÂ the via media. That Latin term has historic roots in the Anglican tradition that has tried to navigate a middle ground between partisan Catholics and radical Protestants. Â There are two historical examples from very different times and places that both appeal to a consensual middle ground that deserve mention.\n\nWriting in an abbey off the southeast coast of France near Cannes, Vincent of Lerins (d. 445) wanted âto secure a kind of fixed and, as it were, general and guiding principle for distinguishing the true Christian faith from the degraded falsehoods of heresy.â Yes, he said, Christians agree that the Scriptures are âcomplete and abundantly sufficient,â but Vincent also observed that people interpret the same Scriptures in different ways, and that even heretics quote the Bible.\n\nIn his Commonitorium, Vincent proposed a way to determine the essence of true faith: âWe take the greatest care to hold that which has been believed everywhere, always, by all.â Thus, his three criteria to identify the core of Christianity: universality, antiquity, and consent.\n\nUniversality implies geographical breadth, that a belief has been held throughout the church the world over. Antiquity deals with time and asks whether a teaching can claim support from our earliest forebears in the faith. Then there is ecumenicity, or the consent of all or nearly all the fathers, creeds and councils. In sum, says Vincent, we should follow that faith that has been âheld, approved and taught, not by one or two only but by all equally and with one consent, openly, frequently and persistently.â\n\nIn the 17th century, the Lutheran pastor and theologian Peter Meiderlin had grown tired of the rancor, doctrinal disputes, and fragmentation caused by the Protestant Reformation. In the early 1620s he wrote a book under the pen name of Rupert Meldenius, all but forgotten until it was re-published in 1850 by Friedrich Luecke with the title A Prayerful Admonition for Peace to the Theologians of the Augsburg Confession.\n\nMeiderlin coined a phrase that has since become justly memorable: âin essentials unity, in non-essentials liberty, and in all things charity.â German theologians called this the FriedensspruchÂ or âPeace Saying.â In following Meiderlin's dictum, said the Puritan Richard Baxter (1615â1691), Christians âtolerate tolerable differences,â and otherwise try to keep the main thing the main thing.\n\nThere has never been a golden age in church history that fulfilled the three criteria of the Vincentian Canon, nor have believers fully followed Meiderlinâs plea. But that doesnât mean that we shouldnât aim for a broad consensual middle and avoid sectarian extremes. Itâs not uncommon for careful thinkers to appeal to a consensual tradition. Despite his many public criticisms of Catholicism, the historian Garry Wills, for example, says that he believes in those things which are central and essential, like the Apostles Creed, rather than incidental and peripheral. \"That seems a fair amount to believe,\" he says tongue in cheek.[46]\n\nFinally, even when we have done our best to define the faith for the church and defend it before the world, the story of Jesus will remain a contested story. There are three reasons why we will always have unfinished business, and will have to ârest patiently in unknowing.â[47]\n\nJesus himself will always be âthe stone of stumbling and rock of offense,â what the novelist Mary Gordon calls the â\"irresistible incomprehensible,\" and Michael McClymond âthe familiar stranger.â What Jesus signified is always âmore challenging than we expect, more outrageous, more egregious.\" The search for the original âhistorical Jesusâ behind the later âChrist of faithâ has strict limits, and even if we identified the \"true\" Jesus behind the Biblical texts, he would become moreÂ and not less incomprehensible to us.[48]\n\nIn addition, our own stories will always remain unfinished. In his class at Harvard, Harvey Cox said that he never felt like he had to answer every question that his students raised, or eliminate all their (or his) gnawing uncertainties: \"They were in the process of growing up, as we all are, as long as we live. And growing up means learning to live with unsatisfying and incomplete endings, with people whose lives are cut off before they should be, or spin out in unexpected directions and sometimes crash in flames. No matter how ordinary they are, all our lives end with a kind of question mark as we reach the threshold of the final mystery.\"[49]Â Questions without answers are a part of every life.\n\nAcross the years 1902 to 1908, a young military cadet and amateur poet named Franz Kappus corresponded with the famous poet Rainer Maria Rilke, asking the latter for his advice. Rilke wrote ten letters to Kappus, who later published them in 1929 as a book, three years after Rilkeâs death from leukemia. The book is called Letters to a Young Poet. In one letter Rilke gives Kappus advice that still rings true today: âBe patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer.â\n\nThe Christian conversation with the world will also remain contested because of the non-falsifiable nature of disciplines like history, poetry, philosophy, and religion. Although not unproblematic, this distinction is the genius and strict limitation of the basic criterion of science, that its results areÂ repeatable, falsifiable, testable, and refutable. But as we shall see, many of lifeâs most important questions, like love and compassion, or guilt and regret, are inherently non-falsifiable. Unfalsifiable and unscientific hardly mean that something is unimportant.\n\nDefenders and detractors of religion are both on contested ground here. To repudiate the faith because of the problem of evil, for example, doesnât mean that the problem disappears for an atheist. There are no knock-out punches or intellectual slam dunks in this book, only a defense of the idea that a Christian view of the universe makes enough sense, or even more sense, that it explains more, and is more satisfying, than a non-Christian view.\n\nWeâre in the realm here of personal persuasion rather than of mathematical proofs. Â Weâre looking for what the physicist John Polkinghorne calls verisimilitude or \"the ring of truth,\" or the Yale historian Jaroslav Pelikan called âpublic evidence for a mystery.â In the book of Acts, Luke writes that the Jesus story is an open book and available for all to consider, for âthese things were not done in a corner.â But he also admits that the resurrected Jesus âdid not appear to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen beforehand by God.â[50]\n\nIn this book, I seek a meaningful articulation of faith in a world of honest doubts, a personal confession that engages a larger public conversation. I want to move beyond sentimentality, tired cliches, and pious platitudes in order to struggle with the strange story of Jesus. And so I resonate with the Yale poet Christian Wiman: \"What I crave now is some speech that is true to the transcendent nature of grace yet equal to the hard reality in which daily faith operates.\" I seek that elusive balance between \"active devotion and honest modern consciousness.\"[51]\n\nÂ\n\nFor further reflection\n\nDenise Levertov (1923â1997)\n\nThe Beginning of Wisdom\n\nYou have brought me so far.\n\nI know so much. Names, verbs, images. My mind\n\noverflows, a drawer that can't close.\n\nUnscathed among the tortured. Ignorant parchment\n\nuninscribed, light strokes only, where a scribe\n\ntried out a pen.\n\nI am so small, a speck of dust\n\nmoving across the huge world. The world\n\na speck of dust in the universe.\n\nAre you holding\n\nthe universe? You hold\n\nonto my smallness. How do you grasp it,\n\nhow does it not\n\nslip away?\n\nI know so little.\n\nYou have brought me so far.\n\nDenise Levertov (1923â1997) was born in England to a Welsh mother and a Russian Hasidic father, who converted to Christianity and became an Anglican priest. After moving to the United States in 1948, Levertov taught at a number of places, including eleven years at Stanford (1982â1993). It was at Stanford, where her papers are now housed, that Levertov converted to Christianity at the age of sixty. Her little book The Stream and the SapphireÂ collects thirty-eight poems that trace her \"slow movement from agnosticism to Christian faith.\" See Denise Levertov, Collected Poems, edited and annotated by Paul A. Lacey and Anne Dewey, with an Introduction by Eavan Boland (New York: New Directions, 2013), 1063pp.\n\nChapter Two\n\nSecular Faiths\n\nThe Witness of History\n\nThe philosopher John Hick once observed that if you collected all the images of God that have been created by religion, they'd form a book the size of a telephone directory. Â I thought of Hick when I walked through the Egyptian section of the British Museum in 2004. There I saw the god Sobek, portrayed as a man with the head of a crocodile. Or consider the Hindu fire god Agni. He has two faces smeared with butter, seven tongues, gold teeth, seven arms, and three legs.\n\nSobek and Agni are relatively recent gods, dating back about 5,000 years. In fact, for as far back as we can peer into the mists of history, our human ancestors have always been religious. We have always and everywhere been in search of the sacred. We have sought the transcendent. Who are we? What is our place in the cosmos, and the meaning of our existence?[52]\n\nIn our rites and rituals, in our art, music, and morality, we have been meaning-makers who bear the burdens of transcendence. This witness of human history recalls the very first paragraph of Augustineâs Confessions: âThou hast made us for Thyself, and our hearts are restless until they find their rest in Thee.â But as we shall see in this chapter, not everyone reads this witness of history in the same way.\n\nSigns of the Sacred\n\nThe earliest undisputed evidence for our religiosity are the funeral rites and burial customs that were discovered in Israel and Africa from 130,000 years ago. People painted the bodies of the dead with red ochre pigment, and then laid them to rest in special places, with special objects, and in special ways. Death, these rituals seemed to say, was more than just the end of life; it was a door to another place rather than to nothingness.[53]Â To put these rites in chronological perspective, the invention of writing that ended our âpre-historicalâ period occurred a little over 5,000 years ago.\n\nOr consider humanityâs artistic impulse. In 1994, Jean-Marie Chauvet and two friends stumbled upon a 1300-foot long cave in southern France that contains some of the earliest human art ever foundâ400 animal representations, palm prints, and stencils made of red ochre, black charcoal, and etchings into the rock walls. There are also foot and paw prints, smoke stains, and charcoal remains.\n\nRadiocarbon dating confirms that the artwork is 30,000 years old. In one case, a more recent painting was superimposed on an original one five thousand years later. Hundreds of bones and skulls from at least thirteen species, but not a single human bone, litter the floor of the cave. Clearly, this was a sacred place for art, community, rites, and rituals.[54]Â\n\nWell over 300 caves with prehistoric art have been found in France and Spain alone. There is similar cave art found all over the world with comparatively ancient datingâin Indonesia, Namibia, Australia, South America, and the American southwest.\n\nThe earliest known musical instruments were found in caves in the Swabian region of southern Germany. Flutes, perforated with five finger holes, had been carved out of bird bones and ivory tusks over 40,000 years ago. Other caves near the GeissenkloesterleÂ Cave contained the figurative art, personal ornaments, and mythical images that indicate symbolic thought and behavior. These instruments were likely used for both religious and recreational purposes.\n\nInstrumental music is especially instructive because it is abstract, and has no representational meaning through words or images. Nonetheless, it bears an emotional power that has always spoken deeply to us. Instrumental music, observed the neurologist Oliver Sacks, âcan have wonderful, formal, quasi-mathematical perfection, and it can have heartbreaking tenderness, poignancy, and beauty.â[55]\n\nWe also seem to have a moral grammar thatâs embedded into us, and into the nature of reality, a sense of right and wrong thatâs more than mere social convention or neurobiological hardwiring. The Babylonian Code of Hammurabi, the Hebrew Ten Commandments, or a Dostoyevsky novel are just three examples from our literary legacy that elucidate the most important questions that people can ask about human life, like the mystery of good and evil, the nature of integrity, the meaning of fidelity, or the necessity of honesty.\n\nIn nurturing our moral sense, we honor the sanctity of life, the meaning of love, and their power to bind us together in community. When we flaunt or ignore the moral grammar of the universe, we risk spiritual, emotional, and psychological death. In the Terrence Malick trilogy of films that considers the hedonistic excess of our contemporary hipster culture, one character admits, âI revolted against goodness.â Another one laments, âI spent thirty years ruining my life instead of living it. Where did I go wrong?â[56]Â However superficially enviable, and however hard to admit, a life dedicated to wanton pleasure is a spiritual train wreck waiting to happen. Itâs just not how we humans are hardwired.\n\nThis witness of history regarding our rituals, art, music and morality suggests that human beings have never been mere âDarwinian survivalistsâ who exist only at a material level, and who only need to master âadaptive fitness.â Rather, we have always been âmaximalistsâ who need meaningful narratives in order to flourish. Food, for example, is about community and sharing, and not just nourishment. Sex is more than the means to natural selection. People need a spiritual life in addition to their biological existence.[57]\n\nThese are important observations from history, but theyâre not the empirical conclusions of science. To state the obviousâlongevity, even 130,000 years, is no test for truth. Many tragic errors and falsehoods have persisted for millennia. Nonetheless, these clues from our human history arenât for that reason any less important. Wilfred Cantwell Smith, former professor of comparative religion at Harvard, thus flips our cultural script. Heâs worth quoting at length:\n\nâRather than feeling called upon to defend the awareness of what some of us call the divine before the bar of modern scepticsâ peculiar logic and exceptional worldview, I am at least equally inclined to call them before the bar of world history to defend their curious insensitivity to this dimension of human life. Seen in global perspective, current anti-transcendent thinking is an aberration. Intellectuals are challenged, indeed, to understand it: how it is arisen that for the first time on this earth a significant group has failed to discern the larger context of being human, and has even tried (with results none too encouraging thus far) to modify its inherited civilization so. After all, the overwhelming majority of intelligent persons at most times and places, and all cultures other than in part the recent west, have recognized the transcendent quality of man and the world. To be secularist in the negative sense is oddly parochial in both space and time, and to opt for what may be a dying culture. It is important that we keep in conversation with this group, but important also that we do not fall victim to, nor treat with anything but compassion, its incapacity to see.â[58]\n\nIn the overall context of world history and human cultures, religion has not only mattered for virtually all people and places, it has been our defining modus. All human history, says Smith, has been a religious history or Heilsgeschichte. Itâs astonishing that anyone would ever believe something so wrongheaded like the idea that religion will or should wither away, or that itâs nothing more than the unconscious psychological projections of our own insecurities (Feuerbach, Marx, and Freud[59]).\n\nNonetheless, there are important voices in our cultural conversation who believe exactly that, although some of them deserve more of our attention than others. We don't live in all of human history, or 40,000 years ago, we live in the (post) modern west. Here and now we rightly ask whether religion matters. We live in what Yale law professor Stephen Carter calls a âculture of disbelief,â where religion has been marginalized and trivialized despite its long heritage in our history.\n\nCarnival Barkers\n\nThe most notable exception to the witness of history about our human religiosity has been the very white and western atheism that began roughly around the time of the French Revolution that âde-christianizedâ Europe. This atheism has often been linked with the progress and prestige of science, in both the popular imagination and by some of its most important proponents.[60]\n\nToday an aggressively secularist viewpoint finds expression in the so-called new atheism of people like Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris, and Chris Hitchens. For thinkers like them, religion is a dangerous superstition, an intellectual cop-out, a political disaster, and a possible mental illness. This sounds exaggerated, but in their case itâs not. Their zeal and rhetoric have honored few boundaries.\n\nThereâs a large and burgeoning literature thatâs quite critical of the new atheism, including important denunciations by fellow atheists. The atheist critiques of the new atheism offer no support for religion, but they do intend to change the tone and misleading generalizations of the conversation.[61]\n\nMy own thinking about atheism has been shaped by my personal experience of living in an officially atheist country. Just as there is a history of human religiosity, there is a history of atheismâs crimes against humanity.\n\nAs I mentioned in the Introduction, in September of 1991, my family moved to Moscow State University, where I took a position as a visiting professor in the Department of Scientific Atheism. Just three months later, on December 24, 1991, we were in the American Embassy celebrating Christmas Eve when Mikhail Gorbachev went on national television and resigned.\n\nThe Soviet experiment, in which a nation where Russian Orthodoxy had flourished since the baptism of Prince Vladimir of Kiev in the year 988 had became one of the most violent purveyors of atheism, had lasted just seventy-four years (1917â1991). One week later, at the turn of the New Year, our family was in Red Square when the red and yellow Soviet flag with its hammer and sickle came down at the Kremlin, and the new tricolor flag of the Russian Republic was raised.\n\nI was paid a full professorâs salary in cash (rubles), the equivalent of about $20 a month. My appointment was for two years, but since I couldnât get a job back home, we stayed for four years, coming home on June 19, 1995. I will always be grateful for the generous hospitality of my Russian hosts who afforded me such an intellectually and spiritually rich experience.[62]\n\nThe atheist regimes of the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, Maoâs Cultural Revolution, Pol Potâs Khmer Rouge in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979,[63]Â and North Korea[64]Â have had catastrophic consequencesâthe mass murder of over 100 million people in less than a century, the starvation, exile and imprisonment of many millions more, and the decimation of their economies, science, art, education, religion, and even or especially their histories. Muslims have a long way to go before they catch up with the colossal scale and scope of this slaughter that was carried out in the name of a western secular âliberation.â[65]Â And ironically enough, as Michael Walzer of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton has shown, secular revolutions of national liberation are often followed in short order by fundamentalist religious counter revolutions.[66]\n\nGiven this historical record of annihilationism, and my personal experience of living in the former Soviet Union, the new atheism of Dawkins, Dennett, Harris, and Hitchens feels like an irresponsible parlor game played out in the comfortable confines of Oxford and Boston, if not a cavalier and grotesque mockery.\n\nIn many ways, these zealots are the reverse image of the religious fundamentalists that they mock. The Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and now Presbyterian pastor Chris Hedges describes them as âcarnival barkersâ whose stock in trade includes gross intolerance for any âotherâ who is different from them, facile analysis, the abuse of evolutionary biology as a âsurrogate religion,â the confusion of scientific progress with moral progress, racist and crude generalizations (especially about Muslims), and what he calls âa staggering historical and cultural illiteracy.â\n\nWhat really angers Hedges about the new atheists is their uncritical belief in the utopia promised by the Enlightenment, thanks to the inevitable progress of science and the innate goodness and rationality of humanity. He objects to their evangelistic efforts to remake the world in the image of an ostensibly âenlightenedâ west.\n\nMy experience with the Stanford faculty fellowships that I mentioned in the Introduction, which has similar iterations on campuses around the country with my InterVarsity colleagues, also belies the popular myth that elite intellectuals canât be earnest believers. There are many respectful and substantive interactions between believers and nonbelievers taking place all around the country. Â\n\nThe Veritas Forum deserves special mention. Since their founding at Harvard in 1992, Veritas has hosted more than 2,000 forums at 200 universities in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia. Their mission is âto help students and faculty ask lifeâs hardest questionsâ¦ The Veritas Forum is committed to courageous conversations. We place the historic Christian faith in dialogue with other beliefs to invite participants from all backgrounds to pursue Truth together.â[67]\n\nJust as some people lose their religious faith, there are others who have lost their faith in atheism, like the novelist Mary Karr, the journalist Peter Hitchens (younger brother of Chris Hitchens), the philosopher Anthony Flew, and the computer scientist Rosalind Picard of MIT. One of the more noteworthy conversions was by the literary critic A.N. Wilson.\n\nWhen Wilson (b. 1950) entered St. Stephen's House at Oxford University, he planned to become an ordained priest in the Church of England. That lasted just a year, until he renounced his faith and focused on a career in writing â which, having published nearly fifty books in a prolific and award-winning career, seems to have been a good vocational choice.\n\nAfter attending church all his life, Wilson became what he calls a \"born again atheist.\" For thirty years he was a well known and outspoken sceptic: \"I had become like one of the Billy Grahamites, only in reverse.\" In 1991, he published a pamphlet called Against Religion: Why We Should Live Without It.\n\nThen came his re-conversion. In 2009, Wilson published an essay in the New StatesmanÂ and the Daily Mail called \"Why I Believe Again.\" Religious belief, he came to understand, isn't primarily about who has the best intellectual arguments, pro or con. Â Religion concerns the whole person, and in particular those deeply mysterious and meaningful aspects of being fully humanâlike music, love, language, and ethics, that a strictly materialist point of view fails to capture.[68]\n\nConversation Partners\n\nThereâs a more modest, interesting, and important version of atheism that deserves our respect as a genuine conversation partner. Because of the acknowledged constraints on all human knowledge, this atheism is often closer to agnosticism. This form of unbelief recognizes that no appeal to science can prove the truth of atheism or the falsehood of religion. You canât prove a negative, that God doesnât exist, as my agnostic friend and Stanford law professor Hank Greely likes to say with a shrug and a smile. In addition, atheists of this sort, like the poet Philip Larkin, often acknowledge the moral implications of the nihilism that seems inherent in their position.[69]Â Here are four examples.\n\nFor some atheists, the âbook of natureâ doesnât declare the glory of God, it invokes dread. Consider the cell biologist Ursula Goodenough and her description of a camping trip when she was about twenty years old.[70]\n\nShe writes, âI found myself in a sleeping bag looking up into the crisp Colorado night. Before I could look around for Orion or the Big Dipper, I was overwhelmed with terror. The panic became so acute that I had to roll over and bury my face in my pillowâ¦ When I later encountered the famous quote from the physicist Steven WeinbergââThe more the universe seems comprehensible, the more it seems pointlessââI wallowed in its pointless nihilism. A bleak emptiness overtook me whenever I thought about what was really going on out in the cosmos or deep in the atom.â\n\nA worldview thatâs limited to the scientific method alone might be intellectually coherent, but for many people it is not emotionally satisfying. Itâs very hard to begin with nothing more than a reductionistic, empirical âisâ and discover a robust, moral âought.â And so elsewhere in her book, Goodenough tries to âsweeten the sour appleâ by embracing what she calls a non-theistic religious naturalism.\n\nThis sounds similar to the position of Einstein (1879â1955), who appealed to Cosmic Awe. Einstein spurned all religious institutions, never attended worship services or prayed, rejected all dogmatic theology (eg, miracles, the afterlife, or prayer), did not believe that God was in any sense personal, and was a strict determinist.\n\nNevertheless, he thought of himself as religious in the broad sense of humility and awe at the mystery, rationality and complexity of the cosmos. \"The eternal mystery of the world,\" he said, \"is its comprehensibility.\" For Einstein, the mysterious book of nature betokened some superior intelligence: \"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings.\"\n\nEinstein also repudiated what he called \"the fanatical atheists\" who tried to claim him for their cause. About a year before he died, he wrote in a letter to Hans Muehsam that he thought of himself as a \"deeply religious unbeliever\" (March 30, 1954). For Einstein, science and religion were complementary rather than antagonistic, seen in his aphorism that \"science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.\" Science cannot determine ethics or inform us of ultimate purpose or meaning, and so it could never displace or supercede religion.[71]Â\n\nAnother atheist who favors cooperation over conflict is the biologist Edward Wilson (b. 1929). Since 1996 he's been an emeritus professor at Harvard, where he's spent some forty years. He's written over thirty books, two of which won Pulitzer Prizes.\n\nWilson was born in Alabama and raised in the evangelical faith of the Southern Baptists, a faith that he rejected long ago in favor of scientific humanism. He was one of the authors of the 1973 Humanist Manifesto. He's described himself as more of an agnostic than an atheist, and in one place called himself a \"provisional deist.\"\n\nWilson is hard on religion. He considers it the main source of violence and tribalism, an \"irrational\" obstacle to progress that we must outgrow. The grand narrative of science, \"not the archaic version soaked in religion and ideology,\" is \"clear and massive.\" To wit: \"We were created not by a supernatural intelligence but by chance and necessity as one species out of millions of species in Earth's biosphere. Hope and wish for otherwise as we will, there is no evidence of an external grace shining down upon us, no demonstrable destiny or purpose assigned us, no second life vouchsafed us for the end of the present one. We are, it seems, completely alone. And that in my opinion is a very good thing. It means we are completely free.\" As an \"accident of evolution,\" and with no God to save us, we must save ourselves.\n\nTo the extent that religion neglects the earthly present in order to emphasize a heavenly future, and as a consequence abuses creation, Wilson blames religion for many of our environmental woes. His history of humankind reads like a long, slow march from superstition due to religion to liberation thanks to science. But Wilson is also as wary of scientific and technical optimism as he is of religious pessimism.\n\nDespite these harsh criticisms, Wilson has argued for the unification, convergence, synthesis, or \"consilience\" of science and the humanities. His book The CreationÂ is written as a letter to a fictional pastor. He says that scientists ought to \"offer the hand of friendship\" to religious leaders and build an alliance with them, for \"science and religion are two of the most potent forces on Earth and they should come together to save the creation.\" Thus the last sentence of his book The Meaning of Human Existence: \"If the heuristic and analytic power of science can be joined with the introspective creativity of the humanities, human existence will rise to an infinitely more productive and interesting meaning.\"[72]\n\nMy favorite atheist is the English novelist Julian Barnes (b. 1946). Barnes was never baptized and says that he has never attended a church service in his life, and so he's never had any faith to lose. He came by this unbelief honestly; his father was an agnostic and his mother said that she didn't want \"any of that [religious] mumbo jumbo.\"\n\nBut the prospect of total extinction, both personal and cosmic, and the terror which absolute annihilation provokes in him, causes Barnes to admit in the first sentence of his book that while he doesn't believe in God, he misses him. In effect, Barnes is obsessed with the question first posed by our human ancestors 130,000 years ago about what happens at death.[73]\n\nThe title for his disquisition on death comes from one of his journal entries over twenty years ago: \"People say of death, 'There's nothing to be frightened of.' They say it quickly, casually. Now let's say it again, slowly, with re-emphasis. 'There's NOTHING to be frightened of.' Jules Renard: 'The word that is most true, most exact, most filled with meaning, is nothing.'\"\n\nExactly where the emphasis on nothingness rightly falls is what occupies Barnes' considerable talents. The result is a book characterized by deeply personal candor and broad-ranging critical inquiry that encompasses art, music, philosophy, science, literature, and family memories.\n\nThe Christian story claims that Jesus \"conquered death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.\"[74]Â This story succeeded, says Barnes, not because people were gullible, because it was violently imposed by throne and altar, because it was a means of social control, or because there were no other alternatives.\n\nNo, the Christian story succeeded because it was a \"beautiful lie\" or \"supreme fiction.\" It's the stuff of a great novel, \"a tragedy with a happy ending.\" And good novelists, says Barnes, tell the truth with lies and tell lies with the truth. For Barnes there's always a \"haunting hypothetical\": what if this Grand Story is true?\n\nThe strictly secular-materialist option is simple enough. When your heart and brain cease to function, your self ceases to exist. But in this view, the \"self\" is nothing more than random neural events.[75]Â There's no ghost in the machine to begin with, so there's no \"self\" that ceases to exist. In post-modern parlance, personal identity is only a social construction.\n\nBut Barnes has nagging suspicions about this secular scenario. Even if they are hard to define or describe, a common sense outlook, endorsed by the vast majority of humanity that has ever lived, is that intelligence, aesthetic imagination, our moral impulse, consciousness, love, gratitude, guilt, regret, and the longing for immortality â all of these seem to point beyond themselves. They have the ring of truth that make them hard to reduce to mere biology.\n\nAnd so Barnes wonders, given his genuine lack of religious faith, is it proper to assign any meaning to his personal story? Does his life enjoy a genuine narrative? Or is it only a random sequence of events that ends with total extinction, such that any and all meaning-making is pure \"confabulation?\" One thing you can be sure of, Barnes reminds us â in the end, it doesn't matter what you think. The divine reality, or lack thereof, is what it is, and so \"the notion of redefining the deity into something that works for you is grotesque.\"\n\nWhen the atheist Christopher Hitchens died of esophageal cancer in December 2011, the world lost one of its most colorful and controversial public intellectuals. I'll always remember attending one of his readings at a bookstore. In a short posthumous volume, Hitchens described his last days with the grim reaper.[76]\n\nAmong other things, he meditated on the poetry of TS Eliot: \"I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker, / And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker; / and I am afraid.\" As for Philip Larkin's famous poem \"Aubade,\" with its terrifying description of fear in the face of death, Hitchens described it as an implied reproof of stoicism, and then concluded: \"atheists ought not to be offering consolation either.\"\n\nIn a last chapter of unfinished, random jottings, thereâs this enigmatic remark: \"If I convert it's because it's better that a believer dies than that an atheist does.\" This is left unexplained, and otherwise Hitchens remained an atheist to the end. His \"chief consolation\" was in friends, including very kind words for the Christian geneticist and Director of the National Institutes of Health Francis Collins. I like to imagine that his trademark sarcasm had finally given way to an appropriate sort of intellectual and spiritual modesty.\n\nScientism\n\nClosely related to atheism is what I would call âscientismâ (to be distinguished from science proper). In fact, itâs revealing to play with the words. âAtheistic scienceâ implies that science demands disbelief. âScientific atheismâ suggests that unbelief enjoys the support and prestige of science. I believe that both of these claims are false.[77]\n\nThere are two broad types of scientism. A \"soft\" version appears in popular culture, the media, entertainment, and everyday conversations with friends, and is illustrated in assumptions like, \"How can you be both a scientist and a believer?\" A \"hard\" version argues a sophisticated position in intellectual treatments of the subject.[78]\n\nScientism makes two separate but related claims, sometimes implicitly but at times also explicitly: (1) positivism, the belief that the scientific method is the only or most reliable way of gaining valid knowledge (an epistemological claim about how we know); or (2) materialism, that the physical world of nature is all there is to know (an ontological claim about the nature of reality). Science so conceived has moved far from its rightful but limited purview. In her four Terry Lectures on science and religion at Yale, Marilynne Robinson coined the word âparascienceâ to describe this sort of worldview.[79]\n\nIn his book River Out of EdenÂ (1995), Richard Dawkins writes that \"all my books have been devoted to expounding and exploring the almost limitless power of the Darwinian principle.\" But many of life's most important questions cannot be answered by the scientific method: What is love? Should I get married? Is it sensible to bear children? We rightly do not expect science to answer these or many other important questions.\n\nThere are important aspects of everyday life that science cannot explain by itselfâmorality, aesthetics, the rational intelligibility of the world, and the stubborn religiosity of human beings from all times and places as previously observed by Cantwell Smith. In fact, as the theoretical physicist, former president of Queens College, Cambridge, and Anglican priest John Polkinghorne (b. 1930) once observed, science has been so successful precisely because of âthe modesty of its ambitions, by its self-limitationsâ to describe only the physical world.\n\nScience limits itself to empirical evidence, which makes much of it so compelling, but empirical evidence alone yields only limited information. Further, even such an ostensibly objective act as \"empirical observation\" is both theory laden and \"tainted\" by the subjective knower. All scientific facts are interpreted facts, and rely on a circular interplay between theory and experiment. In addition, like all disciplines, science operates with its own unprovable assumptions (eg, that the world is rational).\n\nScience deals with what Aristotle called \"efficient causes\"âa description of howÂ something happens, but not with \"final causes\"âan explanation of whyÂ something happens. At its best, science adopts a methodological naturalism as a research strategy, and thus remains neutral about metaphysical or philosophical claims outside of its narrow purview. \"It is just as wrong,\" writes Gingerich, \"to present evolution in high school classrooms as a finalÂ cause as it is to fob off Intelligent Design as a substitute for an efficacious efficientÂ cause.\"[80]\n\nThe ontological claim that the material universe is all that exists is exemplified in the claim of the astrophysicist Carl Sagan (1934â1996), famous for his grave intonation on his show CosmosÂ that the universe is all there ever has been, is, or ever will be. That's a fascinating myth, in the best and robust sense of the word, one that deserves genuine debate, but it's neither scientifically verifiable nor religiously satisfying. Itâs a philosophical article of faith.[81]\n\nYou would never know it from the viewpoint of scientism, but many scientists are people of deep religious faith. My favorite is Polkinghorne. Others come to mind, like Gingerich, professor of astronomy and the history of science at Harvard, or Ian Hutchinson, a plasma physicist who heads MIT's Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering. High up there in my pantheon of saints is the neurobiologist Bill Newsome of Stanford.[82]Â I have already mentioned Francis Collins, head of the National Institutes of Health.[83]\n\nWe should also let the best of science speak for itself. The prestigious National Academy of Sciences has issued two booklets on themes relating to the relationship between science and religion. They make six important caveats, concessions or qualifications regarding the scientific enterprise that I think would surprise many people, and that repudiate the ideas of scientism.\n\nFirst, the NAS acknowledges that science is not the only way of knowing. A worldview without broader knowledge beyond science would be deeply impoverished. Second, it affirms that many scientists are deeply religious and \"hold that God created the universe and the various processes driving physical and biological evolution,\" a simple statement of fact that often goes unnoticed. Third, it reminds us that many religious people see no conflict with evolution. In fact, the report concedes that theistic evolution \"is not in disagreement with scientific explanations of evolution.\" That would imply, for example, that science need not be materialistic or atheistic, even though its purview is the merely material.\n\nFourth, because its scope is so very narrow, science \"cannot comment on the role that supernatural forces might play in human affairs.\" That is, it must remain agnostic about areas outside of its empirical method.\n\nFifth, the report seems to embrace a view similar to Stephen Gould's \"non-overlapping magisteria,\" when it advocates that \"science and religion occupy two separate realms.\" Thus, questions of morality, aesthetics, philosophy, politics, economics, social policy, and the like \"extend beyond science's realm.\"\n\nIn practice this is hardly ever true; scientists can and do comment on these issues, and when they do, the mantle of prestige and authority that often attaches itself to science accompanies their opinions that, strictly speaking, lie outside of the scientific method.\n\nDo scientists really remain silent on the social, medical, economic, or moral implications of stem cell research, CRISPR gene editing (already the subject of billion dollar lawsuits over the commercial implications), or whether or when we might use the nuclear weapons that science created? Or consider the political ramifications of scientific conclusions about the heritability of intelligence, crime, sexuality, and aging. If scientists discover a genetic marker for aggression, should society do anything about it? Recall the movie Minority ReportÂ (2002) in which police arrested murderers before they committed their crimes.\n\nFinally, in several places, the report notes that in science no truth is ever final, in the sense that scientific conclusions always remain open to correction and revision.[84]Â I like to imagine how our best s"
