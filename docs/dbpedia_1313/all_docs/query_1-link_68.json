        "text": "Research Fields: Modern Jewish literatures, Yiddish literature, Hebrew literature, Jewish American literature, popular literature, theories of world literature, translation, digital scholarship.\n\nEducation: BA 2004, University of Chicago; MA 2009, Hebrew University; PhD 2015, The Jewish Theological Seminary, New York\n\nSelected Publications: His first book, Jewish American Writing and World Literature: Maybe to Millions, Maybe to Nobody was published in 2020 with Oxford University Press. The book is a study of how Jewish American writers confront the idea of world literature, investigating how writers, in English and in Yiddish, place themselves within world literature’s institutional confines, outside its purview, or, most often, in constant motion across its maps and networks.\n\nMy second book, A Taytsh Manifesto: Yiddish, Translation, and the Making of Modern Jewish Culture, is forthcoming in 2024 with Fordham University Press. The book calls for a translational paradigm for Yiddish studies and for the study of modern Jewish culture, proposing a shift in vocabulary, from Yiddish to taytsh, in order to promote reading strategies that account for the ways texts named as Jewish move between languages and cultures. Drawing on examples from Yiddish pulp fiction, Sholem Aleichem’s monologue, popular US culture, and more, A Taytsh Manifesto develops a model for identifying, in Yiddish and beyond, how cultures intertwine, how they become implicated in world systems and empire, and how they might escape such limiting and oppressive structures.\n\nOther publications include include: an article on the popular novels of Sarah B. Smith; a reading of Avrom Sutzkever’s late style and the politics of Holocaust Literature; book reviews examining the state of Jewish and Yiddish Studies and the future of Jewish American literary study; and a tribute to my late mentor Alan Mintz. More of my writing can be found at In geveb: A Journal of Yiddish Studies."
