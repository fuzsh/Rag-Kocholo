        "text": "Saul: \"No one else. You can't ask Langley for help either. You are on your own.\n\nCarrie: Story of my life.\n\nSaul: Sometimes I think you prefer to be alone.\n\nCarrie: I was always an outsider.\n\nSaul: All of us. This is a profession for outsiders.\n\nCarrie: You too?\n\nSaul: Are you kidding? Jesus. We're all outsiders, Carrie. We are in this profession because it is the only one that would let us in.\" (Carrie's Run)\n\nSaul Michael Berenson is Carrie Mathison's mentor and to some extent, protector at the CIA. He recruited, trained, and placed Carrie in the field, and continues to have a close working relationship with her, despite not being her immediate boss anymore.\n\nNovels[]\n\nSaul is a character, who appears in the book written by Andrew Kaplan:\n\nNovel Homeland: Carrie's Run\n\nNovel Homeland: Saul's Game\n\nAbout Him[]\n\nSaul Berenson is Carrie's mentor as a Middle East expert and retired CIA division chief. Saul has already put her hand in the fire for Carrie with her superior David Estes several times, because he still has a lot of influence within the agency. Carrie convinces him to use his connections and help her with the Brody case. But Carrie's questionable investigative methods, which could land the two of them in the devil's kitchen, soon give rise to Saul's doubts.\n\nGrew up… feeling like an outsider, even in his own community. Saul was one of the only Jewish residents of Calliope, Ind., for which he faced discrimination. He spent his early life trying to fit in with his community. Now he’s doing all he can to stay under the radar.\n\nLiving… in the direct center of a political and diplomatic hurricane. Saul resides in Washington D.C., but he spend most of his time trying to solve international quarrels at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.\n\nProfession… CIA officer. Saul knows the ins and outs of international politics like no one else at the agency. He’s been at the heart of conflicts in the Middle East since the beginning of his career. As a result, Saul is a reasonable realist who’s willing to sacrifice himself for his country.\n\nInterests... none, aside from his job. Saul’s entire life revolves around the CIA. The job eats him up, even though he knows that it’s toxic for his personal life. “Everyone lies in this business,” he says. “I accept that.”\n\nRelationship Status… precarious. Saul is married, but it seems that he’s only holding onto his wife by a thin thread.\n\nChallenge… saving the United States and his marriage. Thwarting terrorist attacks on U.S. soil is one thing, but preventing “the love of my life walking out my door” may prove to be even tougher.\n\nPersonality... reserved, sober, and determined. The ever-patient Saul is willing to play the “long game” when it comes to diplomacy and spycraft. He is the most reasoned and grounded member of his elite CIA team. Without Saul, the agency might well implode.\n\nBiography[]\n\nSaul has worked for the CIA for 35 years. He recruited and trained Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes), and continues to mentor and have a close working relationship with her, despite not being her immediate supervisor anymore. Saul is also a long time friend of Dar Adal (F. Murray Abraham), a black ops specialist, and the men help and advise each other over the course of the series. Saul is married to Mira Berenson (Sarita Choudhury), but his work takes a toll on their marriage.\n\nHe is a veteran intelligence officer at the CIA, initially introduced as the agency's Middle East Division Chief. His measured approach to his job often clashes with Carrie's drastic, impulsive methods. Saul is doggedly committed to his job, often at the expense of his personal life: he has a wife, Mira, who resents his absence at home (which ultimately results in their divorce), and a sister, Dorit, who lives in the West Bank and has not seen him in years.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nLittle is known about early Saul's life yet, it has been established he majored in political science in college. He was also one of the few Jewish children to grow up in a town in rural Indiana. Saul Michael Berenson, \"The Bear\", is a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer who has worked for the agency for 35 years and is the mentor and former boss of Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes). He was responsible for catching Osama Bin Laden.\n\nWhile Carrie likes Jazz in the Thelonious Sphere Monk style, Saul prefers John Coltrane's jazz, which is not so demanding. Michael grows up as the only Jewish kid — and Orthodox — in a small town in Indiana, the child of Holocaust survivors. He couldn’t possibly be more an outsider (The Weekend).\n\nThe book gets into areas the TV series never did. He is constantly looked upon as “Talmudic”. In season 4, Martha Boyd reveals to Carrie that she almost married Saul once.\n\nSaul won't give up his asset. It’s this one commandment, his only principle in life/work.\n\nBackground[]\n\nNick Brody's return[]\n\nTen months later, Carrie told Saul about the intel Hasan Ibrahim supplied regarding a turned American POW and requested permission to place surveillance on Sgt. Nick Brody, a POW who was recently rescued after long captivity. Saul denied the request, suggesting that her idea that Abu Nazir tipped off the military to the location where Brody was found was fanciful, and would need real evidence to justify action against Brody. After Saul doesn't approve of placing surveillance on Brody, Carrie illegally starts surveilling him anyway with the help of Virgil Piotrowski.\n\nHe did however place her in Brody's debriefing on the condition that she behave herself (which she didn't). Saul defends her against her boss, David Estes, who complained about her behavior in the debriefing, however he was warned not to let things get personal with Carrie. Saul discovered Carrie's illegal surveillance of Brody and became angry with her when she later to seduce Brody. Saul does feel that Carrie justified herself when she found a rhythmic pattern in the way Brody tapped his fingers during televised appearances.\n\nSaul is instrumental in getting cooperation from captured terrorist Aileen Morgan, which leads to information that implicates Tom Walker. Saul later runs afoul of CIA Director Estes when he discovers that Estes and then-CIA director William Walden ordered a drone strike that hit a school in Iraq and have been taking measures to cover up the incident. After an operation with Carrie in Beirut, Saul finds a copy of the confession tape that Brody recorded. This leads to Saul, Carrie, and Estes forming a task force attempting to use Brody as a re-doubled agent against al-Qaeda. Saul discovers that Estes' plan is to have Brody killed once the operation is finished and tries to put a stop to it which leads to further friction with Estes, almost losing his job. However, Peter Quinn, the black ops operative hired by Estes to kill Brody, decides not to go through with the plan once Abu Nazir is killed. When Estes is killed at the bombing of the memorial service for William Walden at Langley on December 12, Saul becomes the acting director of the CIA.\n\nOnce he is director, Saul and Carrie almost immediately put into action a plan to lure out the mastermind behind the 12/12 attacks, in which Carrie is outed to the press as having bipolar disorder and having had an affair with Brody. Appearing vulnerable, Carrie is contacted by representatives of an international bank with ties to the middle east, as Saul predicted, who ask her to inform on CIA operations to their client, Majid Javadi, Iran's deputy intelligence Chief and the orchestrator of the 12/12 attack with whom Saul has a troubled history. When they were both getting their starts in their respective nations, Saul and Javadi worked together during the Iranian hostage crisis, but Javadi betrayed Saul by having several hostages who Saul was going to extradite back to the states killed. In response, Saul helped Javadi's wife and son escape to America. Saul, with the help of Fara Sherazi, finds that Javadi embezzled millions from his own nation to fund the attack, making him an enemy of the Iranian state should this ever be revealed. Using this as leverage to make Javadi a CIA asset, Saul sends Javadi back to Iran. At the same time, Saul clashes with Senator Andrew Lockhart, who is soon to replace him as director, and he discovers that his wife is having an affair with a man named Alain Bernard.\n\nSaul manages to bring Brody, now a heroin addict after his captivity in Caracas, back to the United States to help carry out the second phase of his plans for the Middle East. Saul intends to send Brody to Iran under the guise of seeking political asylum so that he can kill Danesh Akbari, leader of the Revolutionary Guard, who will then be replaced by Javadi - ushering in a regime change in the nation. A special ops unit works to rehabilitate and retrain Brody back to peak condition. Meanwhile, Saul finds that Alain is an Israeli intelligence agent hired by Lockhart to spy on him, and uses this info to give himself more time in office to see through the mission to the plan. Brody manages to make it into Tehran, where he eventually succeeds in killing Akbari. Carrie implores Saul to get Brody extracted; Saul agrees, but Lockhart and Dar Adal overstep him and leak Brody's location to Iranian authorities, who apprehend and execute Brody. Despite this, Saul's plan is a success, with Iran agreeing to disarm its nuclear sites four months later. Saul is fired from the CIA once Lockhart takes office, and then begins work in the private sector.\n\nIslamabad[]\n\nSaul travels to the U.S. embassy in Islamabad where Carrie has since been posted as station chief, and reconnects with U.S. ambassador Martha Boyd, an old friend and former romantic partner. On his way back, Saul is kidnapped and brought to Taliban leader Haissam Haqqani, who uses him as a human shield to travel freely through Pakistan without fear of a drone strike. Haqqani holds Saul captive as a bargaining chip to get several Taliban prisoners released in an exchange. Some time after the Taliban's assault on the U.S. embassy, Saul learns from Dar Adal that Haqqani agreed not to harbor terrorists in Afghanistan in exchange for being removed from the CIA's kill list. Dar also informs Saul that video evidence of his capture by the Taliban will not be publicized, preserving Saul's chances of becoming CIA director. Saul agrees to this deal, deeply disappointing Carrie when eventually finds out. Carrie subsequently helps derail Saul's bid for the directorship, forming a rift between them that lasts over two years.\n\nBerlin[]\n\nTwo years later, Saul is called to Berlin to attend to a scandal involving leaked documents attesting to widespread privacy violations by the American and German governments as part of a counterterrorism probe. Saul formally agrees to end the program but continues it independently, enlisting Peter Quinn to assassinate known targets. In the two-year interim, Mira filed for divorce from Saul after he rejoined the CIA, and Saul began a relationship with Berlin station chief Allison Carr. Carrie later finds out that Allison is a longtime mole for the Russians and is using Saul as a patsy to obtain classified intelligence. Carrie and Saul team up with German intelligence to thwart the Russians' operation; though Allison escapes, Saul makes a deal with Ivan Krupin, her handler, for details about her extraction plan, and leads a team to intercept and assassinate Allison at the German border.\n\nNew York[]\n\nMonths later, Saul and Dar Adal advise President-elect Elizabeth Keane in New York during her transition into office. Dar, distrustful of Keane's antiwar platform and anticipated overhauls of the intelligence community, plots behind Saul's back to undermine the Keane administration. Saul investigates Iran's possible violations of their nuclear treaty (based on a false lead planted by Dar), visiting his sister Dorit in the West Bank as cover to secretly meet with Majid Javadi. Saul has Javadi confirm whether Iran is running a parallel nuclear program; Javadi eventually comes to the U.S. himself, seeking political asylum after he is outed as a CIA asset in Iran, and confirms to Saul that Iran is complying with the nuclear pact. However, Javadi reverses course, telling the opposite to Keane after making a deal with Dar Adal. Saul and Carrie prove to Keane that Dar is conspiring against her. After a faction within Dar's group attempts to assassinate Keane, she retaliates during the first month of her presidency by arresting over 200 federal employees including Saul.\n\nKeane's presidency[]\n\nSome months later, Keane agrees to release her 200 political prisoners including Saul, who accepts the position of National Security Advisor. Saul is first placed in charge of the manhunt for provocateur Brett O'Keefe, and unsuccessfully attempts to deescalate a standoff between the FBI and O'Keefe's supporters (which ultimately ends in a deadly shootout). Saul finds evidence that the situation escalated due to disinformation deployed by the Russians, and enlists a task force to uncover a widespread Russian conspiracy to undermine President Keane's administration. He and Carrie work to exfiltrate a key witness in the case from Russia so that she can testify about the conspiracy before Congress. Carrie allows herself to be captured by the GRU in order to ensure the operation's success, and Saul is forced to leave her behind. Seven months later, Saul negotiates Carrie's release in a prisoner exchange and finds her in severe delirium due to her being denied medication for her bipolar disorder while in captivity.\n\nKabul[]\n\nAfter Keane resigns, Saul stays on as National Security Advisor for Ralph Warner, who inherits the office after serving as Vice President to Keane.\n\nSaul, now the US National Security Advisor, is leading the US effort to end the war in Afghanistan. Negotiations between Afghanistan and the Taliban fall apart when Afghanistan's vice president, Abdul Qadir G'ulom (Mohammad Bakri), announces he will refuse to honor the proposed terms. Saul recruits Carrie, who is still recovering from her imprisonment in Russia, to join him in Kabul to help salvage the peace talks, despite warnings from Carrie's caretakers at a military hospital in Germany that she is not ready. Saul arranges a secret meeting in Pakistan with Haissam Haqqani (Numan Acar), who is now the leader of the Taliban, but the ISI learn of it and hit Haqqani's convoy with an RPG. In the aftermath, Saul is captured and delivered to Haqqani, who was not in the convoy but sent it as a decoy. Haqqani suspects Saul planned the attack, but soon learns that his son Jalal (Elham Ehsas) betrayed him to the ISI. Saul and Haqqani eventually agree to terms on a peace deal, which includes an immediate cease fire. Their plans fall apart when the helicopter carrying the US president and the Afghan president goes down in Taliban-controlled territory.\n\nCarrie, already suspected to be working with the Russians, lies about her clandestine meetings with GRU agent Yevgeny Gromov (Costa Ronin), and Saul is compelled to send her back to Germany. Carrie goes on the run with Yevgeny in search of both a missing Max and the flight recorder from the helicopter crash. She remains in contact with Saul, who tries to help her despite the CIA's pursuit. With Haqqani about to be put on trial and executed, Saul seeks aid from his Pakistani nemesis Tasneem Qureishi (Nimrat Kaur), who is now Director-General of the ISI. Though her stepfather Bunran Latif (Art Malik), Saul's old friend, refuses Saul, Tasneem agrees to help him stall the trial. They believe they are successful, but Haqqani is immediately sentenced to death. Jalal claims responsibility for the crash, and Saul tries to prevent the new US president from escalating the situation further by threatening to invade Pakistan. Saul wires Carrie $1 million to acquire the flight recorder, which is subsequently stolen by Yevgeny. Knowing that the recorder proves that mechanical failure caused the crash, Saul goes to the Russian ambassador, who denies any knowledge of it. Yevgeny tells Carrie that she can have the recorder in exchange for the identity of Saul's highly-placed spy in the Kremlin. She turns herself in to the CIA and is released into Saul's custody, but he denies the existence of any such double agent. Carrie's subsequent investigation proves to her that Saul is lying, and Yevgeny tells her to find the spy's identity or kill Saul.\n\nTasneem helps Saul diffuse the US's threats against Pakistan by providing him with a believable location for Jalal that will distract US intelligence. When Saul refuses to identify his Russian asset, Carrie drugs him, and threatens to kill him if he does not comply. Saul calls Carrie's bluff, so she leaves him as the captive of two GRU agents while she visits his sister Dorit (Jacqueline Antaramian) in Israel. By pretending Saul has died, Carrie collects a video left for her with Dorit that identifies Saul's asset as Russian translator Anna Pomerantseva (Tatyana Mukha). Carrie informs Yevgeny, but Saul manages to warn Anna, who kills herself before the Russians take her into custody. The cockpit recording is released by the Russians, ending the threat of nuclear war. Two years later, Carrie has fled to Russia and is in a \"relationship\" with Yevgeny, and Saul has retired after suffering a heart attack. Saul receives a message from Carrie in the same manner he communicated with Anna, establishing herself as his new asset in Russia.\n\nCharacter profile[]\n\nHomeland, one of the most acclaimed television series of the past decade, has captivated audiences with its intriguing plotlines, complex characters, and intense performances.\n\nAt the heart of this thrilling drama is Saul Berenson, a seasoned veteran of the CIA who serves as a mentor to the protagonist, Carrie Mathison. Known for his calm demeanor and strategic mind, Saul Berenson is a character who exemplifies the quintessential spy archetype and adds depth and nuance to the narrative.

By viewing him through high-minded concepts, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities that lie beneath his calm exterior. Saul embodies the archetype of the wise mentor, drawing upon the theory of the Hero's Journey, as described by Joseph Campbell.

It’s happening right now in front of your faces. We have O’Keefe. We have a disinformation campaign designed to discredit the president elect. As of today, we have boots on the ground, like the protesters I had to wade through to get here. Does that seem familiar to any of you? Because it does to me. It’s what we did in Nicaragua, Chile, Congo, a dozen other places, all the way back to Iran in the 50s. And it does not end well for the elected regime.\n\nSAUL: I’m in trouble. I have to disappear.\n\nMIRA: This is about the president-elect, isn’t it? The intelligence community hates her.

Like every other schmuck in this building. So when you say you understand, is that what you mean?\"- Saul for Carrie\n\nQuinn: Where have you been?
