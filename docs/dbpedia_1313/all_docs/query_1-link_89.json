        "text": "I discovered hard-to-find good Jewish food in the Bay Area.\n\nSaul Sugarman\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\nPublished in\n\nThe Bold Italic\n\n·\n\n5 min read\n\n·\n\nApr 11, 2023\n\n--\n\nMy name is Saul, which if no one told you is an old Jewish man’s name.\n\nSaul is the sort of man who — to me — you’d expect to find retired in Miami wearing Birkenstocks and a Hawaiian shirt, holding a lox bagel while simultaneously complaining about the quality of the salmon. Trust me. Try being Saul at age 11 on a playground at a Northern California public school; my name was pretty much unknown except among a few Christian kids who knew the difference between King Saul versus Solomon. And I only have “Better Call Saul” to thank for anyone pronouncing it right nowadays.\n\nRecently I heard the name “Saul’s Restaurant & Delicatessen” in Berkeley, and knew I had to visit because I thought, “This must be an old Jewish man’s restaurant, he’ll know good salmon.” It turns out I was right: Saul Lichtenstein, who the restaurant was named after, is so old that he is no longer with us.\n\nHis daughter Andra named it after her father in 1986 when she acquired the deli through a partnership, and the namesake remains even though ownership changed hands just last year. Andra still visits, and I needed to go; I wandered in one day after the millionth person recommended Wise Sons, which I’ll explain in a bit why this is somewhat ill-advised.\n\nOn a rainy day not long ago at Saul’s, I found a respectable corned beef sandwich, lox bagel and matzo ball soup, along with an amazing grape soda. “Respectable” for me resembles American Ashkenazi fare found in the Midwest (Corky & Lenny’s in Cleveland) and East Coast (Carnegie Deli, naturally).\n\nQ&A: All About Jewish American Deli - Taste of Jewish Culture\n\nI love answering questions about Jewish Food history, and some time ago, in my newsletter, I asked people to email me…\n\nwww.tasteofjew.com\n\nBasically: it’s a sandwich you can’t fit in your mouth that’s served on rye, with a jar of pickles on the side, and a huge, salty matzo ball that almost defies physics with how fluffy and soft it is.\n\nNothing at Saul’s was quite the right size — I’m looking for a heart attack on a plate — but it all tasted great. I’ve never had toasted bread on my corned beef sandwich, and I felt robbed that it didn’t come with pickles. (Apparently you can order them individually for $1.50.) Other notable orders included a latke with applesauce and sour cream, a chocolate macaroon, and rugelach:\n\nMy boyfriend — who like me, is a Reform Jew — described most offerings here as “a bagel that’s been cinnamoned” or “beef that has been corned,” which is to say: bland.\n\nI expect some sort of telegram from Wise Sons for badmouthing them without notice, so rest assured that at least I gave them a college try with half a dozen visits, one catered event, and a recent outing just for this story. I tried nearly the same menu items as Saul’s, including the same sandwiches, soup, and dessert.\n\nThey describe various preparation methods to make the food great at Wise Sons; unfortunately, it just didn’t taste that way. I was surprised to learn this chain has only operated since 2011, back when people lined around the block for its creations. Maybe this is just a bad chapter for a relatively new business."
