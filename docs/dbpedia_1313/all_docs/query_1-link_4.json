        "text": "Saul Origin and Meaning\n\nThe name Saul is a boy's name of Hebrew origin meaning \"prayed for\".\n\nJewish parents in particular may be drawn to this quiet, composed name of the first king of Israel and the name of Saint Paul before his conversion. In modern times, it has been associated with Nobel Prize-winning novelist Saul Bellow. Its meaning makes it appropriate for a long-awaited child.\n\nSaul is a character in a John Dryden poem, and heard in the Handel oratorio, \"Saul.\"\n\nSome other Sauls of note: Saul Steinberg, known for his iconic New Yorker covers, and graphic artist/movie credit designer Saul Bass. The birth name of Guns n Roses's Slash is Saul Hudson. On recent TV, there have been Sauls on Breaking Bad and Homeland."
