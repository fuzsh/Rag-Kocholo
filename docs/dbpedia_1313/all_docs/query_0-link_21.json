        "text": "As of 1.00pm Irish time today, the National Library of Ireland has placed its microfilm records of the Irish Catholic parish registers online. This is a HUGE step forward in making genealogical resources available to people who cannot visit Ireland or who don’t have the time to visit the NLI in Dublin. And all this despite the savage cutbacks in government funding for the NLI in recent years! It’s a truly heroic achievement, so well done to all the people involved. Now all they need is a sponsor to do with the microfilm what the National Archives did with the 1901/1911 census records – make them more interactive and more readily searchable!\n\nI’ll post more on this later, but before you dive in please remember – read the FAQs carefully!\n\nHappy hunting – and it IS a hunt!"
