        "text": "Subject Area: Gender Studies\n\nCoyne, Patrick\n\n2010 0-7734-3756-8 352 pages\n\nThis work is the first comprehensive, full-length work on Alice Duer Miller and her contributions to American letters and cultural history. This original research will be of practical use to researchers and scholars in the areas of American literature, American studies, film history, Broadway history, and gender studies.\n\nPrice: $239.95\n\nCraven, Florence E.V.\n\n2010 0-7734-3787-8 364 pages\n\nThis study is unique in that it analyzes the attitudes of a female sample stratified according to religious tradition (Catholic/Protestant). The sample was also stratified by age (21-45/46-70 years) and location (rural/urban). Irish sociological, social psychological and feminist scholarship has produced diverse work concerning many facets of Irish women’s lives, but little research has specifically focused on the attitudes of Irish Protestant and Catholic women as distinct groups.\n\nPrice: $239.95\n\nHarris, Whitney G.\n\n1999 0-7734-7884-1 180 pages\n\nThis book differs from most of the available literature focused on African-American males, in that it is based on a collection of studies conducted on African-American males and data gathered from them, allowing them to ‘speak for themselves’. A few of the essays deal with the topic of being a gay African-American male.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nDavidson, Phebe\n\n2001 0-7734-7342-4 156 pages\n\nSix wide-ranging essays which track the evolving representation and understanding of stories and themes, an exercise in seeing where a particular idea, image, or sequence of events will lead. For example, Chapter One traces the evolution of the black/white masculine friendship pair from James Fenimore Cooper through Die Hard to The Green Mile. Chapter four discusses Thelma and Louise and Leaving Normal as complementary cultural texts which serve to extend gender definitions found in earlier American literature and which continue actively to engage men and women in American culture today. “There’s nothing ordinary about Davidson’s always interesting insights throughout these six essays. . . . An engrossing, original look at film, energetic and lively. As a cultural observer, Davidson is sensitive and conscientious, and she reveals the American myths that both imprison and liberate.” – Book Reader\n\nPrice: $139.95\n\nMillington, Mark I.\n\n1993 0-7734-9340-9 220 pages\n\nPresents a comprehensive analysis drawing on concepts from psychoanalytical theory and paying particular attention to the representation of gender. After an exploration of the main theoretical concepts deployed, the emerging thematic and textual features in the early stories are defined. The study then concentrates on the stories of the 1950s and 1960s. A repeating pattern in the analyses is the elaboration of a reading and then the discovery of how the coherence of that reading unravels as the stories' textuality disrupts any simple desire to `make sense'. The reading process itself is problematized via concepts drawn from psychoanalysis which help to elucidate the non-transparency of the texts and transferential effects in reading. The final chapter considers the nature of repetition in Onetti: the fact that the stories return again and again to certain ideas is viewed as disabling of a final resolution of the gender problems which are implicit in the stories. Conversely, the fact that these problems are not resolved is also enabling of further writing and invention.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nBratton, Angela\n\n2010 0-7734-3597-2 232 pages\n\nThis study explores the formation of gender identity and the sexual practices of teens in Kumasi, Ghana within the context of the growing emphasis on formal schooling. Direct interviews with students, teachers and members of the community offer a rich variety of data that allows for important conclusions about shifting conceptions of family, education, production and reproduction.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nYoung, Thomas\n\n2001 0-7734-7442-0 152 pages\n\n“It is hard to imagine any other editor who could situate Young’s book so clearly in the thought, culture and politics of his day, and perceive so many links with previous ethical thought and the subsequent developments that were to occur over the next two centuries. The combination of Young and Preece reminds us that the relationship of humans to other species is one of our most persistent moral problems, one which we revisit century after century, and, fortunately, one which has consistently attracted thoughtful and compassionate commentators.” – David Fraser “Thomas Young’s Essay on Humanity to Animals, along with Rod Preece’s Introduction and Notes, will be a valuable addition to the Mellen Animal Rights Library. The Essay’s historical importance is equaled, if not surpassed, by its analytical merits. . . . In his footnotes, he cites the leading modern proponents of various positions along the scale of animal rights. All of this information will be very useful to those seeking an overview of the territory. . . his exposition of Young’s argument is helpful, perceptive, and eminently clear. . . Dr. Preece has done a terrific job of editing the text. Those who are exploring the issue of human relations with nonhuman animals will appreciate having Young’s Essay readily available. They will also appreciate the intelligence of Dr. Preece’s additions and the leads he provides for further investigation.” – Marian Scholtmeijer\n\nPrice: $139.95\n\nWhelehan, Patricia\n\n2001 0-7734-7604-0 248 pages\n\nThis work is essentially an ethnography, written and researched by an anthropologist. As such, the use of participant observation, in-depth interviews and a holistic, relativistic, culture-based approach provide a perspective not usually found in the literature on prostitution. The daily, nonwork lives of prostitutes are explored, showing their commonness, humanity and connections with the ‘straight’ world as ordinary people. By getting deep, rich data through the use of participant observation and ethnographic approach, it serves to address myths, and challenge stereotypes about sexuality, women, and prostitution.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nCox, Darrin\n\n2012 0-7734-2927-1 368 pages\n\nLooks at how masculinity is depicted in knightly memoirs in 15th century France. The meaning of male and female sexuality was constructed on a hierarchical scale of one single gender, and not a binary opposition of two biologically distinct bodies. The author shows numerous examples of this trend in the knightly memoirs that support this understanding. By the end of the sixteenth century, it is evident that a gender crisis did not occur among noble warriors, since men who styled themselves knights merely adopted many of the outward forms of the courtier while retaining a right to violence as both a mark of nobility and signifier of manhood.\n\nPrice: $239.95\n\nSarr, Akua\n\n2003 0-7734-6933-8 168 pages\n\nThe Anita Hill – Clarence Thomas hearings serve as a point of departure to examine how six texts by black women novelists contribute to contemporary black feminist discourse. The manuscript is a comparative study of novels by both anglophone and francophone women: Mariama Ba’s Une Si Longue Lettre; ; Sapphire’s Push; Buchi Emecheta’s Head Above Water; Ken Bugul’s Le Baobab Fou; Tsitsi Dangarembga’s Nervous Conditions; and Myriam Warner-Vieyra’s Juletane. The text challenges the assumption that African American women’s writing is synonymous with black women’s writing, and it approaches issues facing black women globally: lesbianism, incest, rape, prostitution, polygamy, battering, and mental illness.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nKérchy, Anna\n\n2008 0-7734-4892-6 372 pages\n\nThis study fills a major gap of Carter’s reception and enters into dialogue with current post-semiotical theories of the embodied subject by virtue of focusing on the dynamics of the meaning-in-process concomitant with the subject-in-process (Kristeva 1985) and the body-in-process. Through a corporeal narratological method—a close-reading interfacing of semioticized bodies in the text and of the somatized text on the body—the author deciphers how the ideologically disciplined, normativized-neutralized, ‘cultural’ body and its repressed yet haunting transgressive, corporeal, material ‘reality’ (are) (de)compose(d by) the Carterian fiction’s destabilizing discursive subversions and vibrations surfacing in narrative blind-spots, overwritings, textual ruptures or rhetorical manoeuvres.\n\nPrice: $239.95\n\nKirby, David\n\n1991 0-88946-793-5 212 pages\n\nExamines the charms and, more closely, the dangers of boyishness in American culture. Argues the paradox of American culture by drawing from the allied disciplines of literature, history, and psychology, from sources as venerable as the classic texts of our civilization and as current as today's headlines. In the words of one journalist, \"our dreamy, drifting culture throws off dangerous, drifting dreamers,\" the kind of men who shoot our presidents, of course, yet also the kind of men who sometimes become president.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nNauman, Ann K.\n\n2000 0-7734-7739-X 220 pages\n\nPrice: $199.95\n\nPerry, Donna J.\n\n2009 0-7734-4854-3 584 pages\n\nThis work presents the emerging theory of transcendent pluralism and its application in a study of Catholic supporters of same-gender marriage. Transcendent pluralism is an emerging knowledge and values-based theory of human dignity for addressing contemporary social issues rooted in human devaluation such as group bias, social injustice, health disparities, human rights violations, violent conflict and genocide. Transcendent pluralism is grounded in a philosophical explication of human dignity and has been influenced by the writings of twentieth-century philosopher and theologian, Bernard Lonergan. The legalization of same-gender marriage in Massachusetts brought the issue of bias against gays and lesbians into public discourse. During this controversial time, many of the theoretical constructs of transcendent pluralism were manifested, particularly among Catholics who support same-gender marriage. In order to investigate and refine the theory, a study was conducted of Catholic same-gender marriage supporters, using a qualitative research method adapted from Lonergan’s transcendental method. This work will appeal to people who are interested in cultural pluralism, group relations, philosophy, Lonergan studies, humanities, social justice, human rights, gay and lesbian studies, Catholicism, ethics, research methods, nursing and health disparities.\n\nPrice: $319.95\n\nCorr, Helen\n\n2009 0-7734-4913-2 304 pages\n\nHistorically, education in Scotland lies at the heart of national pride and has been widely acclaimed as a more democratic and meritocratic system in terms of wider access to schools and universities when compared with England. One of the main paradoxes which this book unpacks is the that under the Scottish public co-education structure, schoolmasters did overall benefit more favorably within this distinctive tradition whereas the treatment of women teachers as an occupational group in relative terms was more ideologically undemocratic and patriarchal in relation to their female counterparts under the English system. This book sets out on a historical journey and embarks on the reconstruction of policy formation on gender and occupational segregation in the elementary (now called primary) school teaching and it shows that there was nothing ‘natural’ about that process.\n\nPrice: $219.95\n\nTian, Min\n\n2010 0-7734-3777-0 436 pages\n\nThis is the first English language book to systematically examine the life and art of Mei Lanfang (1894-1961). Mei, who specialized in female roles in classical Chinese theatre, especially jingju, is widely considered the greatest actor of twentieth-century China. This text includes analyses of his work from Chinese, Western, Russian,and intercultural perspectives.\n\nPrice: $259.95\n\nCarey, John J.\n\n1993 0-7734-9315-8 58 pages\n\nPrice: $59.95\n\nHouse-Midamba, Bessie\n\n1991 0-7734-9754-4 168 pages\n\nProvides insight into the issue of women in third world development processes. Examines the role of women in Kenyan society, focusing particular attention on the participation of women in economic activities and key political institutions in the society.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nMurray, Gene\n\n2003 0-7734-6548-0 182 pages\n\nPresents studies concerning press coverage of sensitive equal opportunity issues in the American military services during the close of the 20th century. After discussing the role of the mass media, the book deals with press coverage of sexual harassment, media coverage of reports on equal opportunity issues and race relations, and the press’s handling of gender-integrated training in the military services. The final chapter includes discussion of embedded reporters, coverage of Private First Class Jessica Lynch, and media credibility and responsibility.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nWilley, Nicole L.\n\n2008 0-7734-5204-4 324 pages\n\nThis work examines the male characters presented in each of the following works: Susan Warner’s The Wide, Wide World (1850), Fanny Fern’s Ruth Hall (1855), Harriet E. Wilson’s Our Nig (1859), and Harriet Jacobs’ Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl (1861). These sentimental women authors presented masculine ideals in their literature and have played an important role in the construction of gender in America.\n\nPrice: $219.95\n\nScheuerle, William H.\n\n2012 0-7734-4516-1 140 pages\n\nThe work argues that the ascendency of croquet as a popular sport in England during the middle to late nineteenth century was a direct result of class. He traces the history of the sport and finds that it was one of if not the first sport that men and women could enjoy together. The game initially had an elite social status attached to it: it was first seen as a game suitable for the British gentry, especially for those families whose estates had extensive lawns, or for families wealthy enough to join croquet clubs. It attracted many people because it had a certain ‘snob’ appeal and formed as an upper class leisure time activity, and developed with the middle class due to their rising number at that time.\n\nPrice: $139.95\n\nLessen, Laurie Suzanne\n\n1995 0-7734-2723-6\n\nA journey about life and love on both the personal and universal level, dealing with a woman's experience of sexual abuse as a child; the death of the father who abused her; the ultimate abandonment of her remaining family, her survival.\n\nPrice: $99.95\n\nFurlong-Clancy, Sinéad\n\n2014 0-7734-1451-7 560 pages\n\nOUT OF PRINT :\n\nThis book is a groundbreaking and illuminating study of nineteenth-century Paris, its art, culture, and the history of gender and urban space. Sinéad Furlong-Clancy’s choice of the public park as frame for the analysis of images of women in the city is a departure from existing art, cultural-material and literary histories and connects the disciplines of art history, literature, fashion history, urban history, garden history, nineteenth-century French studies, and gender studies.\n\nPrice: $349.95\n\nSuwaed, Mohammad\n\n2016 1-4955-0505-7 304 pages\n\nA remarkable book examining the feminist discourse in the Middle East by analyzing selected philosophical texts by both female and male Arab thinkers. It explores the changes that have taken place in the Arab feminist discourse over the years by addressing the social, cultural, and ideological backgrounds of the region’s feminist over two centuries.\n\nPrice: $219.95\n\nWebster, Kate L.\n\n2010 0-7734-3801-7 244 pages\n\nThis book examines socio-cultural and gender-based barriers Kenyan secondary school girls face. Currently, research has focused on increasing girls’ enrollment rates to ameliorate the gender gap in African education. This research demonstrates that while it is important to have more girls attend school, girls today are disproportionately placed in inferior schools and confronted with gender-based attitudes that negatively impact their educational opportunities.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nHall, Ronald E.\n\n2003 0-7734-6817-X 328 pages\n\nThis study will give readers new insight into skin color as a crux of Western discrimination including America and its non-white citizenry. That insight will characterize a seldom-discussed aspect of discrimination by analyzing its perpetration between and among African, Asian, Hispanic, native, feminist, and gay/lesbian Americans. It goes beyond the usual black/white dichotomy to examine the secret taboos of previously oppressed populations, and address the aftermath of colonization in the ways in which dark-skinned American – regardless of race – are perceived.\n\nPrice: $219.95\n\nLiddy, Brenda J.\n\n2010 0-7734-3791-6 136 pages\n\nThe book is about the representation of war in the plays of Anne Devlin, Marie Jones and Christina Reid. Cumulatively, the plays demonstrate a symbiotic relationship between war and gender, showing women’s response to war as complex and diverse. The work of these three playwrights suggests that women played a much bigger part in the conflict and in the post-conflict environment than has been acknowledged.\n\nPrice: $139.95\n\nWhaley, Annemarie Koning\n\n2015 1-4955-0341-0 44 pages\n\nPrice: $59.95\n\nMartin Armas, Dolores\n\n2013 0-7734-4478-5 172 pages\n\nThis book examines the classic struggle between daughters seeking their mother’s affection and how these behavioral patterns in young girls lead them to seek maternal love in other women. Four Spanish novels, with lesbian characters, provide the backdrop for this psychoanalytic exploration of Spanish literature.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nFrankforter, A. Daniel\n\n1989 0-88946-303-4 248 pages\n\nPoullain expounds a remarkably modern feminist position: that sexual inequality is not rooted in nature, but is the historical result of custom, ignorance, and prejudice. The first English text printed since 1677, with the original French text of 1673 included.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nOsnes, Beth\n\n2010 0-7734-3779-7 348 pages\n\nThis collection examines the nexus of mothering, feminism, and theatre. The work examines the portrayals of mothers in literature and on the performance stage, and makes a contribution to studies in dramatic literature, women’s studies, feminist theory, and theatre history.\n\nPrice: $219.95\n\nQuinn, Deirdre\n\n2008 0-7734-4830-6 284 pages\n\nThe only collection of its kind to be produced with a single, cutting edge theme, and to gather recent and upcoming scholarship in the area of gender and sexuality. Literary analyses feature prominently in the collection but essays from the disciplines of English, Film and Media Studies and Women’s and Gender Studies help to widen the scope of the topic as well as provide genuinely interdisciplinary dialogue.\n\nPrice: $199.95\n\nJohnston, Georgia\n\n1997 0-7734-8577-5 280 pages\n\nThese essays examine texts from the Renaissance to the Postmodern, analyzing transgression's formation as a product of textual interdependence with audience, showing that subverted gender politics, unexpected genre combinations, and revised cultural histories result from textual transgression. The anthology emphasizes that transgression is not a transcendent transparent act that breaks cultural norms. Instead, western conceptions of text and audience construct the definitions and effects of transgression.\n\nPrice: $199.95\n\nBirnbaum, Paula\n\n2009 0-7734-4807-1 316 pages\n\nThis work examines the social, cultural and political contexts in which women artists from Europe, Asia, and North America had the opportunity to contribute to their nations’ cultural production. This book contains twenty-nine black and white photographs.\n\nPrice: $219.95\n\nScirghi, Thomas J.\n\n2000 0-7734-7883-3 280 pages\n\nThe recent attempts to change the traditional Trinitarian formula in baptism in order to rid it of masculine language raises questions concerning the nature of revelation and tradition. The study also examines the work of feminist theology which has provided a means for a radical rethinking of religious experience.\n\nPrice: $199.95\n\nTatum, Karen E.\n\n2005 0-7734-5989-8 212 pages\n\nExamines the causes of the abject response in canonical novels such as Charles Dickens’ Oliver Twist, Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre, and Mary Elizabeth Braddon’s Aurora Floyd and Lady Audley’s Secret. In Powers of Horror, Julia Kristeva outlines her theory of abjection as a simultaneous fascination and horror stemming from sensorial reminders of the subject’s primal, psychological relation to the mother. The author suggests that these psychological perspectives can potentially result in acts of physical violence, which are called “abject response”. By developing Julia Kristeva’s theory of abjection as a model for reading physical acts of violence against women, the book yields specific answers to its overriding questions: Why was a female body so threatening in nineteenth-century fiction? The answer lies in social constructions of women as powers of horror, which the male subject imbibes and which lead to domestic violence if improperly balanced.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nMorris, John L.\n\n1993 0-7734-9325-5 304 pages\n\nThese essays explore the nature and effect of differing categories of stereotype: racial, social, sexual, class media, cultural, etc. Essays examine how best-selling novels gain their effect from the use of stereotyping of the Negro and Jew; the way in which women in Victorian England were expected to be seen; the use of working-class stereotypes; how literature and other cultural productions portray people and situations in terms of the media even to the extent of their being reduced to electronically projected images representative of the accelerating standardization and mechanization of mass society.\n\nPrice: $219.95\n\nMathew, Mary T.\n\n1996 0-7734-4236-7 242 pages\n\nThis book analyses the development of Tagore's heroines within the framework of the Bildungsroman, and also explores the ways in which the 'female Bildung' can be facilitated within a Hindu ideology. It examines gender development in Tagore in terms of both its privatized cultural context Western critical ideology.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nBurris-Kitchen, Deborah\n\n1997 0-7734-8617-8 224 pages\n\nThis is the only study that looks at female gang members in a small to medium size urban area, noting the lack of all-female gangs, conflicting views on the equal status of females in gender-mixed groups, continuing to investigate the level at which Black females are involved in the informal economy, and the possible time dimension aspects of Merton's innovator.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nScott, Hannah\n\n2005 0-7734-6000-4 216 pages\n\nFocus on gender bias in perceptions of criminal women, using the extreme example of serial murder. Often, an examination of the extreme can show cultural biases with greater clarity. This book shows that men and women, as with more common homicide trends, carry out serial murdering in different patterns. Lastly, this book will explore another possible definition of serial murder as well as some alternative theoretical approaches to the problem. While there have been numerous studies of male serial killers, studies of female serial killers are lacking, even though, as the statistics of this book document, there have been many over time.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nWorley, Sharon\n\n2012 0-7734-2583-7 364 pages\n\nIn the tradition of Virginia Woolf’s “In Search of a Room of One’s Own,” this study traces the origins of French feminism to Neoclassical theatre and the court of Louis XIV. Through feminist revisionist histories of French literature, the Neoclassical plots and female archetypes from Racine’s Phedre and Andromache, Voltaire’s Brutus (Catherine Bernard) and Marmontel’s Belisarius (Stephanie Genlis) were transposed by women writers and patrons onto actresses and the queens, empresses and mistresses of the French ruling dynasties from Louis XIV- to Napoleon at a time when women were denied the rights of citizenship. Women authors include Bernard, Genlis, Olympe de Gouges and Germaine de Staël, among others. Arguing that emerging feminism is a function of historicism that defines female identity through parallel constructs between regency and theatre, Neoclassicism and modernity, authors of an emerging body of French feminist writings ineluctably reconcile sadist and pacifist incongruities between gendered roles in tragedy.\n\nPrice: $239.95\n\nFendler, Susanne\n\n1997 0-7734-8667-4 188 pages\n\nEssays include: \"The Conflict Betwixt Love and Honor\" - The Autobiography of Anne, Lady Halkett (Gabriele Rippl) Intertwining Literary Histories: Women's Contributions to the Rise of the Novel (Susanne Fendler) Charlotte Smith and the Romantic Sonnet Revival (Sylvia Mergenthal) The Transformation of a Genre - the Feminist Mystery Novel (Marion Frank) Journey and Gender - Diversity in Travel Writing (Karin Veit) Cyberpunk, Cyborgs and Feminist Science Fiction (Jenny Wolmark)\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nCondé, Lisa Pauline\n\n1991 0-7734-9440-5 216 pages\n\nThese essays are a contribution to the ongoing debate on the interaction between feminism and hispanism. Writers examined include Calderón, Galdós, Valle-Inclán, Unamuno, Pardo Bazán, Rosa Chacel, Alfonsina Storni, Bombal, Luisa Valenzuela, and others.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nGrace, Nancy McCampbell\n\n1995 0-7734-8998-3 312 pages\n\nThis study explores a character type who is neither androgynous nor feminine, presenting a critique of the way in which the term \"androgynous\" has been misapplied to the feminized male, and through the use of reader response theory, argues that this type of figure appeals to female readers because he reflects parts of themselves often ignored or outrightly ridiculed through male literary representation. The book presents new arguments about characters created by James Joyce (Ulysses), Ernest Hemingway (The Sun Also Rises, The Garden of Eden), Jack Kerouac (On the Road), and Saul Bellow (Humboldt's Gift), advancing a growing body of research rejecting the majority view of these four writers as antifeminine artists. The feminized male, whose male creator has intentionally endowed him with feminine as well as masculine qualities in an effort to explore the complexities of gender in a dialectically social (via literary) realm, presents a powerful technique to explore, challenge, and redefine gender, not only in fiction but in our everyday lives as well.\n\nPrice: $219.95\n\nChishty-Mujahid, Nadya Q.\n\n2021 1-4955-0927-3 116 pages\n\nIn this book Dr. Chishty-Mujahid expands her earlier works to focus on fraternal male twinship. She offers a helpful biobliography in the area of twin studies and a discussion about theories concerning twin relations.\n\nPrice: $119.95\n\nMayer, Martin P.\n\n1993 0-7734-2236-6 196 pages\n\nThis empirical study describes the relationship between discrimination against gay teachers, the way teachers manage their identity, and their self-esteem, including acceptance of self and acceptance of others. It describes the need for this research in its historical context, reviews the related literature, presents the methodology and findings, and recommendations for future research. It documents the lack of substantive differences in personality characteristics, and offers useful data that can foster insight and knowledge too often missing in emotionally-charged debates about gays in the professions.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nHoward-Byrd, Sherlynn Teas'La'Nea\n\n2008 0-7734-5144-7 164 pages\n\nThis study explores the age and gender discrimination faced by female newscasters and the legal remedies they can employ to rectify illegal termination. The study also evaluates other non-industry cases of unlawful employment practices concerning grooming, dress codes and appearance standards.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nNavarro-Tejero, Antonia\n\n2005 0-7734-5995-2 188 pages\n\nThis book analyzes the intersections of gender, caste and the (re)telling of history in the narratives by two contemporary South-Asian women writers in English of Malayalam descent, Arundhati Roy and Githa Hariharan. The authors have chosen two novels: The Thousand Faces of Night (1992)– winner of the Commonwealth Prize for Best First Book– by Githa Hariharan; and The God of Small Things– winner of the Booker Prize in 1997– by Arundhati Roy. Githa Hariharan represents the reality for a considerable section of Indian womanhood inserted in a brahminical, high class environment, and Arundhati Roy depicts the fatal consequences of the inter-caste sexual relations in a supposedly caste-less Christian and at the same time communist community. The overall purpose of this study is to unravel, expose and analyze how these authors create new possibilities, using two main strategies: first, re-defining female subjectivity in the critical juncture of caste and gender, and second, by reinterpreting history. Telling stories, that is, creating history, is in itself a way of producing new entities, new identities. Consequently, from this angle, plotting family and lineage is very relevant. Roy’s and Hariharan’s stories call for a re-vision and transformation in the three main power structures–State, Religion and Family–subverting, thus, the canon and claiming the subalterns’ space in History.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nMigiel, Marilyn\n\n1993 0-7734-9392-1 204 pages\n\nUsing feminist, psychoanalytic, and deconstructionist approaches to Torquato Tasso's 1581 Gerusalemme Liberata (Jerusalem Delivered), this book argues that Tasso explored alternate modes of writing and reading by reflecting on the genealogical tales of his non-Christian women characters, Clorinda, Erminia, and Armida. They permit Tasso to explore what it might mean to ask an alternate series of questions about one's relation to the father. By examining the interpretive and ethical questions that rise from the problematic genealogies of Tasso's orphan daughters, we arrive at a better understanding of the relation between the poem's dominant ideology, on one hand, and the stories that it seeks to suspend and displace on the other.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nDerayeh, Minoo\n\n2006 0-7734-5813-1 260 pages\n\nThe changes that affected Iranian women’s lives after the coming of Islam in the seventh century were similar to the changes that occurred in their lives after the Islamic Revolution of 1979. In both cases these changes were largely wrought by men.\n\nIranian women have been actively involved and have participated fully in diverse religious, political, and social contexts since the eighteenth century, but frequently without recognition. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the belief that education was a pillar of freedom began to gain popularity among Iranian women. Their efforts to secure an equal place with men in the nation’s educational institutions received support from a number of women writers and poets in the form of protests and petitions. The twentieth century, however, witnessed the destruction of most of Iranian women’s hopes and quests. Different Iranian governments enacted a series of important laws and regulations touching on “women’s issues” without allowing any input from women.\n\nIn the last two decades, under the Islamic Republic, laws and regulations affecting the status of Iranian women came in the form of different religious decrees that were justified by the argument that they all complied with the Quran and the shariah. Iranian women have refused to abandon their quests for an equal status. This is their story.\n\nPrice: $199.95\n\nTerryberry, Karl J.\n\n2002 0-7734-7309-2 164 pages\n\nMary E. Wilkins Freeman’s tales for and about children arose out of cultural constrictions formulated by a strict adherence and obedience to the Puritan values embedded in New England history. At the time she wrote these stories, New England was experiencing a population decline fueled by massive changes in industry and farming, and the effects of war. With young, industrious men pouring out of rural New England, Freeman concentrated on the women and the weak men who were left behind. Role models for boys were hard to find, and respectable mates for girls were few. Consequently, the lines dividing gender roles got blurred in Freeman’s world, and she set out to redraw the lines by redefining the roles of men and women for children. This text not only discusses the impact of such cultural and historical forces on gender in her writing, but it also categorizes both collected and uncollected tales by grouping together the products of Freeman’s gender instruction.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nOwen, Hilary\n\n1996 0-7734-8849-9 240 pages\n\nThese readings of modern Portuguese, Brazilian, and Portuguese African texts articulate a challenge by drawing on different theories of how gender, ethnicity and class relate to the production and reception of culture.

It identifies key elements for a working definition of such complex violence, and highlights the pervasiveness and seriousness of the violence with quantitative data. For the Catholic believer the violence is graver still because a Catholic component can often be identified in the violence. This component is illustrated in the book by qualitative data about Catholic women who suffered incest. Employing the foundational and methodological framework of the praxis of authenticity in consciousness that Bernard Lonergan has identified, and that everyone can verify in their own experience, as well as its specifically Christian conversion component, the book provides grounds for making the situation of violence a theological matter. The book’s argument progresses by following Lonergan’s definition that theology functions to mediate between a religion and a culture and that the function of ‘systematics’ in method in theology is to construct contextualised understandings for the sake of ‘doing the truth in love.’ Theological meanings transformative of the situation of violence are elaborated in the book in terms of how to conceive salvation in Jesus Christ. Such an understanding of salvation is constructed by drawing firstly on meanings for salvation in scripture that are dialectically opposed to destructive meanings that the Catholic women, who suffered incest, referred to above received and believed concerning salvation. Insight into these biblical meanings is deepened by drawing on the theologies of salvation of Karl Rahner, Gustavo Gutierrez, and feminist responses to Gutierrez’s theology. The transformative meaning for salvation is developed further by addressing the issues of the male Jesus as saviour and his violent death of redemption in ways that can serve the struggle to stop male violence against women. The book ends by drawing attention to recent documents on male violence against women by Church leaders that make specific reference to a transformative role for theologians and by calling for third level theology colleges to take account of the pertinent violence as a theological imperative and to collaborate with others in the field of concern as part of the function of theology.\n\nPrice: $259.95\n\nTurpin, Cherie Ann\n\n2010 0-7734-3839-4 128 pages\n\nThis is a study of women writers of the African Diaspora and their articulation of the erotic as an important aspect of human experience beyond the limits and expectations of society.

Sidney's revealing correspondence with his tutor Hubert Languet displays a friendship that seems to have developed into a homoerotic attachment or Greek love and thereby problematized Sidney's own gender. That personal gender problematic explains, as this book demonstrates, why Sidney's early masque The Lady of May can be read simultaneously as a textualisation of the instability of gender difference and of Sidney's relationship to his Virgin Queen, Elizabeth I. After tracing the same themes through Sidney's Old Arcadia, it focuses on his sonnet sequence Astrophil and Stella. There it returns to his problematic homoerotic attachment to Languet, finding in it a new answer to the age-old riddle of those famous love poems.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nDixon, Henry O.\n\n2007 0-7734-5571-X 124 pages\n\nThis book examines the way in which major male characters, through their violent, abusive, sadistic or reformed behavior, contribute to either the destruction of development of female protagonists in four of Alice Walker’s early novels: The Third life of Grange Copeland, Meridian, The Color Purple, and The Temple of My Familiar. These men are capable of both good and evil, and in all four novels the major male characters experience enlightenment and eventually contribute to the development of the female protagonists in the novels. Further, the book examines some reasons why African-American men may be abusive to women of similar racial descent, also showing how African-American men, like those in these novels, may be able to transcend these negative causes and contribute to wholesome and profitable relationships with both women and other males.\n\nPrice: $139.95\n\nWill, Frederic\n\n2006 0-7734-5773-9 432 pages\n\nDramatizes the well-known rite of passage in anthropology, while addressing this famous male transition as it occurs in three midlife western intellectuals.\n\nPrice: $259.95\n\nNangia, Shonu\n\n2011 0-7734-1488-6 204 pages\n\nThis book is a study of male-female relations in two acclaimed novels by contemporary Maghrebi Francophone author and French intellectual, Tahar Ben Jelloun.

Utilizing themes of both the occult and magic as well exposing previously undiscovered parallels between the three writers, this book identifies how the advent of the feminine divine enabled men to confront their woman centered rage through embracing a modern form of goddess worship in order to soothe their psychological wounds.\n\nThis book locates a literary study of the goddess in Lawrence, Fortune and Hughes within a narrative in which some modern men try to confront their yearning anger toward women by embracing goddess religion. The author argues that his chosen writers each helped this narrative to emerge, The book (a) offers Lawrence readers a new angle on his preoccupation with the goddess; (b) introduces Dion Fortune (virtually unknown outside her cult following) as an important twentieth century writer on marginality and sexuality; and (c) shows how Ted Hughes’ narratives of the suffering goddess (in Gaudete and Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete Being especially) relate forwards to his own Birthday Letters and backwards to Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover. The author also takes magic and the occult as a theme linking the three writers. In doing so he aspires to place his book in the company of other texts which have also taken the occult in modern literature for their subject.\n\nPrice: $199.95\n\nDavies, Ann\n\n2004 0-7734-6343-7 304 pages\n\nWhile many scholars have approached Don Juan in terms of myth, this study argues for the understanding of Don Juan as a discourse of gender relations, changing over time. Using examples from the plays by Tirso de Molina, Molière, Mozart, Zorrila, Shaw and Frisch, it argues that Don Juan’s entire identity as a male individual is constructed around women, but that over time – reflecting a growing sense of crisis in the male individual – the women appear more and more pathological in their desire for Don Juan. In contrast with early modern works where women fend for themselves in a positive manner, the heroines of later Don Juan works actively prey on the individual male. This book argues that these changes in approach to the female characters, and, in tandem, the developing identity of the male protagonist, suggest Don Juan as dischronic discourse rather than myth. Don Juan is not the eternal seducer, but one of a variety of discourses through which gender relations are negotiated. This book will interest not only Don Juan scholars but also scholars and students of European literature, theatre and gender discourses in literature and culture.\n\nPrice: $219.95\n\nJok, Madut Jok\n\n1998 0-7734-2235-8 360 pages\n\nThis volume examines two aspects of reproductive health among the Dinka of South Sudan: first, sexual and reproductive roles expected of women as their contribution to the national liberation struggle; second , their acknowledgement of the role and their simultaneous strategies to maintain their health.\n\nPrice: $239.95\n\nUrban, Misty\n\n2010 0-7734-3776-2 300 pages\n\nThis study treats the appearance of the monstrous woman in Middle English romance narratives as a self-conscious literary trope that reflects on, and often criticizes, the grounds of philosophical, cultural, and narrative discourse that place women both inside and outside medieval culture, constructing them as Other by biological and social difference yet relying on them for the reproduction and healthy maintenance of the male-governed social order.\n\nBuilding on current monster theory and adding to research on medieval women in literature, this study reclaims the Middle English romance as a sophisticated literary strategy that, in its narrative reflexivity—and its use of a fictionalized thirdspace—reveals how medieval rhetoric essentially makes women into monsters.\n\nPrice: $199.95\n\nMalt, Carol\n\n2012 0-7734-3080-6 272 pages\n\nThis book documents the development of museums as agents for women’s empowerment in Morocco and how the existing programming and physical facilities of museums can be effectively used to benefit women culturally, politically, economically, and personally.

Zola’s texts demonstrate a continual preoccupation with women as they become mothers, specifically, how their status as reproductive and sexual beings creates a conflict that cannot be reconciled. The author employs theories of determinism and naturalism to shape the mother figure, relying on tainted heredity to place her in situations in which she is bound to fail, either as a mother or as a woman. Motherhood in Les Rougon-Macquart entails an alienation of the woman as she loses her autonomy and her voice. The ideal mother portrayed in the series is a woman who will sacrifice her sexuality and even herself to fit the mold established by Zola. This work will appeal to Zola scholars as well as to scholars of nineteenth-century fiction and women’s studies.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nMartin, Laura\n\n2000 0-7734-7809-4 224 pages\n\nThis study shows how the works in question (Goethe’s “Die pilgernde Törin”; Kleist’s “Die Marquise von O. . .”, Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter, and James’s Daisy Miller) can appeal to the reader who identifies a message friendly towards woman and her plight, whether this ‘message’ can be considered a part of the author’s intention or not. These works, through mere description of the impossibility of women characters’ situations without any prescription for change, can often be found to carry meanings more critical of the status quo than at first may seem the case. Such an interpretation often goes against the tradition of criticism that has built up around the works, but it is based on concrete evidence in the text.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nDavison, Kevin G.\n\n2007 0-7734-5354-7 248 pages\n\nThis book explores gender and the body in relation to the postmodern condition, challenging the stability of modernist understandings of gender and making a case for viewing gender as a pedagogical tool rather than as a threat. The research was conducted online among female-to-male transgender and gay men participants, presenting a complex methodological analysis to further question the stability of subjective gender identities. Historical moments when technology and gender have collided are considered as illustrations of the possibilities inherent in technology for renegotiating gendered identities. Further, contemporary debates about boys and academic underachievement are critically examined to illustrate how the resistance to a gender analysis may perpetuate educational inequities. This text offers the potential for building new theories to address gender gravity as a force that can be actively resisted and renegotiated as a part of everyday educational practices.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nLowenthal, Kristi\n\n2015 1-4955-0372-0 140 pages\n\n“Lowenthal’s monograph on the rivalry between Mabel Lee and Louise Pound at the University of Nebraska, fills an important void in the current scholarship on the history of women in intercollegiate athletics and physical education.

It is the first research of its kind that explores the role development of the firstborn American Indian daughter within the context of her family of origin that was conducted by, for, and on behalf of, American Indian women. While there is a dearth of literature written about American Indian women, what has been written has been by Anglo men, based on studies of men, and whose findings are generally superimposed on women. This research is groundbreaking in that it gives voice to the middle-aged firstborn American Indian daughters studied within the context of ecological theory and in combination with self-in-relation and feminist theoretical perspectives.\n\nThis ethnographic study illuminates the everyday lives of the firstborn daughters whose role development was shaped and influenced by the experiences of their parents and grandparents, steeped in forced assimilation by U.S. government policies, who were removed from their own parents and sent to boarding schools. These ethnographic presentations of the women’s lives and families are moving the study of American Indians in new directions of viewing cultural history from an intimate feminist point of view. This book contributes to the historic writings of the American Indian cultural experience in America, as well as provides a new foundational insight into the role development of firstborn American Indian daughters within the context of their families, for deeper understanding by scholars and practice interventions for helping professionals across disciplines.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nGoldsmith, Netta Murray\n\n2016 1-4955-0474-3 412 pages\n\nFor about a hundred years after Charles II reclaimed the throne in 1660 more women than ever before strove to live as independently as men did…the most spectacular bid for freedom was made by girls who became soldiers and sailors…another factor which enabled a women to earn money and gain a measure of liberty and independence was the growth of London…The Restoration saw the beginning of the movement to establish sexual equality.

The emphasis of the study is on cultural poetics and feminism, establishing a critique of how late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century critics decontextualized Holme’s work which resulted in their inability to recognize the cultural work that her fiction performed for both the middle-class and mass readership of her day. In contrast to such readings, this study constitutes an argument for the relational value of Holmes’s narratives. By focusing on the work of such critics as Jane Tompkins, Nancy Chodorow, Stephan Greenblatt, Mary Louise Kete, Joanne Dobson and Carol Gilligan, a new and much needed theory is established for examining the texts that appeal to Holmes’s audience, while uncovering the cultural value of popular sentimental works such as those that Holmes creates. The theory developed is then utilized to examine various aspects of relational capacity that women writers present and that their works are based on, enabling them to relate to their culture and readers. The theory provides a means of analyzing popular women writers who have been undervalued by the academy, which has been founded on masculine doctrine.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nReed, Brian D.\n\n2014 0-7734-4353-3 144 pages\n\nA new scholarly contribution to eighteenth century British literature and studies reflecting changing gender roles through examination of the behavior of male characters and their social evolution in British Society before and during the Age of Reason.\n\nPrice: $139.95\n\nFasick, Laura\n\n2003 0-7734-6716-5 216 pages\n\nExamines the ethos of intellectual work for men in a set of novels strongly influenced by Thomas Carlyle, the Victorian Age’s prime proponent of work. It questions the longstanding tradition of regarding the 19th century as a time when a stern work ethic flourished in successful opposition to gentler, female-identified values of domesticity and nurture. This book argues that an over-emphasis on domesticity as the source of virtue and happiness led to a devaluation of the satisfactions to be found in intellectual and vocational arenas separate from domestic life.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nMcClennen, Joan C.\n\n1999 0-7734-7892-2 356 pages\n\nWork far exceeds any published work in breadth and depth on issues related to both gay and lesbian domestic violence.

It examines Alfred Döblin’s Berlin Alexanderplatz; Robert Musil’s The Man without Qualities, and Hans Henny Jahnn’s Perrudja. Together, these novels illustrate how notions of masculinity had become problematic even by the 1920s; and suggest how increased self-awareness can improve men’s lives. “Dr. Kingerlee’s level-headed and well-informed reading of these notorious complex texts not only makes them accessible to the apprehensive reader, it also convincingly rescues at least one of them from crass accusations of extreme male chauvinism. . . . one of the major virtues of this highly original book is that it provokes one to ask questions about maleness and selfhood and to test out one’s answers against those which are explored in the literary texts under discussion.” – Richard Sheppard\n\nPrice: $259.95\n\nSkiffer, La Tanya\n\n2011 0-7734-3938-2 88 pages\n\nThis book critically evaluates the media for manifest and latent content of its rhetoric, particularly, as it pertains to California’s “Three Strikes and You’re Out” legislation.

The book asserts that feminist intertextuality revises one coercive intertext in particular: that of intertextuality theory itself. Rewritings of the fairy tale accordingly can be seen to privilege either the embedded narrative or the escape from it, subscribing either to monologic or dialogic intertextuality. The work examines the original Bluebeard tale group (Perrault, Grimm, variants); historical and modern Bluebeards; and then other writers, including Jane Austen, William Godwin, Margaret Atwood, John Fowles, Peter Ackroyd, Kurt Vonnegut, Angela Carter, Gloria Naylor, Emma Cave, Max Frisch, Stephen King, Méira Cook, and Donald Barthelme.\n\nPrice: $219.95\n\nPagliaro, Harold\n\n2004 0-7734-6365-8 231 pages\n\nExamines the many heterosexual configurations in the plays and to demonstrate by the accumulation of evidence that the actions of Shaw’s chief characters are typically the result of their sexual concerns, often coupled with issues of principle.

Taking four key case study films which can be said to typify areas of British film production during the 1960’s, this book opens out how widely difference methodologies can be used to analyse the British film as text in contrast to the primarily contextual analyses of British cinema of the period found elsewhere. In addition, she argues that the dominant mode of analyzing masculinity, via a “crisis” needs to be re-examined and the terminology returned to its original sense rather than the pop psychological comprehension which places the blames for any problem with masculinity upon feminism. As such, she seeks to reframe a “crisis” of masculinity (the psycho-sexual) as a crisis of masculinism (the socio-political) whilst concurrently examining individual masculinities as an abjected relationship based upon the social and the Other rather than the feminist and the emasculated.\n\nPrice: $219.95\n\nBehr, Kate E.\n\n2003 0-7734-7016-6 272 pages\n\nExamines the male figures in Gothic novels, establishing first a common representation or role for each stock character, and considering the source and effect of these male stereotypes.

However, the death toll associated with this pandemic shifted the course of scientific research and programs from family planning to sexual health as scholars struggled to understand the implications of different forms of sexual behaviors on populations. Still, in the two decades that followed, the tendency has been to search selectively for evidence that confirms held beliefs. This book provides a perspective on adolescent sexual behavior in Africa that is based on the state-of-art research methodologies. Written by an international and interdisciplinary group of scientists and covering all sub-Saharan regions, this book is a truly pan-African volume on new research on adolescent sexual behavior. The papers in this volume show that Africa is a mosaic of cultures where local norms and values must be considered in order to successfully understand and manage the emerging sexual and reproductive health issues. With its ten chapters and various methodological approaches that include sample survey research, focus-groups, meta- analysis, and actual HIV testing, this book is certainly a very strong and timely reference book to students, researchers, policy- makers, and all those interested in sexual science in contemporary Africa.\n\nPrice: $219.95\n\nCarey, John J.\n\n1995 0-7734-9111-2 324 pages\n\nThis book grew out of the author's four years of involvement as chair of the Presbyterian National Committee on Human Sexuality and two subsequent years of traveling and speaking to diverse audiences about these themes.

An elaborated model of the total institution is used to analyze the educational organizations in which children were educated. The study also uses literary texts such as novels and short stories, diaries, memoirs, and (fictionalized) autobiographies to describe and compare the personal lives, social worlds, and structures of boys and girls in these two types of institutions. A theory of structural ritualization is employed to explain how these groups were influenced by the institutional milieus they were nested within. Underlying this study is the fundamental assumption that literature and sociological concepts can be used together to better understand social historical processes and structures.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nMeckel, Mary V.\n\n1995 0-7734-9039-6 168 pages\n\nThis study examines the social factors contributing to taxi-dancing, from a participant-observer perspective. Unlike others who have dealt with this topic, the author was herself employed as a taxi-dancer, a factor that provided first-hand information (from her employment in that capacity between 1969-1970), and field research during 1986-1987, where a mutual sense of identification with her respondents enabled her to acquire their trust, resulting in far more definitive data. The work endeavors to bring the taxi-dancers front stage to voice the contexts defining the personal and professional spheres of their everyday lives. The range of topics introduced as evidence of the \"semi-deviant\" status some experience includes wage competition, alcohol and drug abuse, prostitution and ageism. Also included are a theoretical chapter on symbolic interactionism and determinism, and an integrated review of the literature.

Butterfly, and Kiss of the Spider Woman. These plays and their Broadway productions contain mythic narratives and dreams that Jung described as visionary drama. Peter Brooks’s production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream stages Jungian archetypes that bridge modern and postmodern production sensibilities and aesthetics. David Henry Hwang’s M. Butterfly deconstructs patriarchal personae and stages projection and introjection. Terrence McNally’s Kiss of the Spider Woman, an adaptation of Manuel Puig’s novel, demonstrates the fluidity of meaning in postmodern archetypes. This book will engage theatre scholars and practitioners as well as scholars of popular culture and interdisciplinary studies.

This work is founded on perceptions of African American men in their native country of Africa. Historical writers such as Cheikh Anta Diop, John G. Jackson write of the thriving, robust civilizations and kingdoms of Africa before European colonization. They chronicle the African man in his native country of Africa, successfully and spiritually caring for himself, his family, and his community; letting his voice be heard with dignity and integrity. These are the same types of men that Moore’s research explores in an effort to examine the factors that have been the cornerstone for their success as they function in an oftentimes racist, Eurocentric society. This book details the participatory research approach in which the author engages five successful African-American men in dialogue to explore their reflections on those factors that have contributed to their present success. Moore’s participatory research study chronicles 5 African American men who have successfully and spiritually cared for themselves, their family, and their community; letting their voice be heard with dignity and integrity. These men are but the tip of a social and cultural iceberg, exemplifying the majority of African American men. Their stories, not the mass media stereotypes of the African American man, are the true story of African American men. Moore’s critical work is additional research that adds to the body of knowledge that presents an authentic and realistic view of the African American man.\n\nPrice: $139.95\n\nBryant, Dr. Geraldine J.\n\n2015 1-4955-0288-0 136 pages\n\nThis research was an opportunity to explore the personal stories of a group of young African American males that may be seen as an indication of the conditions that have affected our larger society.

It is exceedingly rare to have a comparative analysis of politics in Japan and the Republic of Korea, which gives this book a special status. At the same time these are countries with remarkably low levels of political participation by women, so it is very important to have an analysis of the reasons for this outcome. In the 1970s women accounted for less than two percent of legislative representatives in Japan, and less than one percent in Korea; today women constitute about seven percent of the members in each legislature, but these levels are still comparatively low in the developed world: about forty-three percent of Sweden’s legislators are women, and women constitute more than 30 percent of Germany’s Bundestag; the level in the U.S. Congress is about thirteen per cent.\n\nThe explanation for this phenomenon is by no means simple, and the author traverses a complex argument beginning with the “late” industrialization of both countries, followed by long periods of military rule and excesses of nationalism in both that until relatively recently subordinated women to state-sponsored goals of rapid development and national unity, to the situation today where, at least in Korea, the role of women in politics is growing rapidly. Her account is based on numerous interviews in Korea and Japan, a deft use of public opinion polls, and a wide comparative reading in the literature on the history and politics of both countries. After examining a host of theoretical and conceptual approaches to understanding the role of women in politics, she combines an historical analysis with an examination of patriarchal culture in Japan and Korea, and then scrutinizes the way in which the two respective political systems have both formal and informal mechanisms that militate against women’s participation. Furthermore at many points in the text she makes comparative judgments concerning women’s participation in Europe and the United States.\n\nBoth Korean and Japanese history in the early 20th century were marked by women who fought multiple battles on several fronts: to get any recognition at all outside the demands of the home, to fight discrimination against any woman who would dare challenge the suffocating society-wide support for family-based patriarchy, to suffer ostracism for joining socialist groups (which tended to more open to women) or for living lives independent of men (for which they were labeled promiscuous and even a threat to national unity). Ichikawa Fusae, the founder of Japan’s Women’s Suffrage League in 1924, suffered much ridicule from the society for decades, only to be forced into supporting Japan’s wars in Asia. Korea was then a colony, not a nation, but from the early point of the massive March First Movement in 1919 right down to the present, when thousands of civic groups and NGOs co-exist in Korea’s strong civil society, women have often been the leaders of protests. This sharp contrast with Japan makes for one of the most interesting aspects of this book.\n\nHer discussion of how the postwar Japanese political system excludes women (without necessarily intending to do so) is also particularly illuminating. The Liberal Democratic Party, in power continuously since 1955 (with one brief interruption in 1993), is made up of factions which resemble one-man political machines or groups, with strong ties of patronage and favoritism in the local areas. These virtually all-male informal networks of patron-client ties, reinforced by male bonding rituals in drinking houses all over Japan, represent a formidable barrier to the entry of women into political careers. Even civic and grass-roots organizations seeking progressive goals tend to be run by men in Japan.\n\nOn the other hand, the largest number of women representatives in the history of the Republic of Korea is seen under the system of the Revitalization Congress. However, given the nature of the Congress at the time, one can hardly say their representation had much to do with the peoples’ will. Ironically though, the long history of the dictatorial military regimes gave Korean women the opportunity to hear their own political voices, and through their participations in anti-dictatorial protest movements they gained political experiences necessary to engage in politics in the future. She interviewed and observed many women involved in grassroots political organizing; their future seems to be a comparatively bright one compared to women in Japan, who still have not found a route to significant participation in the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nWright, Rosemary\n\n1997 0-7734-2244-7 264 pages\n\nThis research evaluates women's relative progress in the occupation of computer work, focusing on mobility and turnover, segregation, and earnings. The evaluation is made in the context of theories of human capital and gender socialization, resegregation and ghettoization, Blalock's male resistance, Kanter's strength in numbers, Jacobs's revolving doors and social control, and a hybrid theory of controlled progress combining the last two. By trend analysis and regression, this work contrasts the career moves, locations, and rewards of men and women in computer programming, systems analysis, computer and systems engineering, and other computer specialties. This study bridges both sociological and management literatures.\n\nPrice: $199.95\n\nThompson, Jack George\n\n1996 0-7734-8760-3 352 pages\n\nThis study presents a global view on the early Celtic experiment in gender equality, focusing on pre-Roman Celtic groups (Celtiberi, British, Gaulish) as well as the six major Celtic societies which survived into the Middle Ages (Breton, Cornish, Irish, Manx, Scottish, and Welsh). Employing an interdisciplinary approach, it avoids parochialism by cross-referencing, where possible, Pagan, secular Christian, and Christian Church authors. In the cases of conflicts in dates, all sides of the conflicts, and types of evidence from such varied disciplines as archaeology, history, women's studies, anthropology, classical studies, comparative law, economics, linguistics, political science, and psychology are cited.\n\nPrice: $239.95\n\nGuisso, Richard\n\n1981 0-88946-151-1 248 pages\n\nThirteen essays on foot binding, female infanticide, widow remarriage, the Taoist androgynous ideal, anti-westernization, etc., discussing the cultural, economic, political, and historical factors which contributed to the emergence of Chinese womanhood of today.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nForbes, Shannon\n\n2006 0-7734-5823-9 188 pages\n\nThis book explores the modern novel’s reflection upon women’s enactment of the stable, whole, unified Victorian identity and anticipation of the successes that will result when women in the modern era find the means to embrace their dynamic, fluid, modern identity.

A network of women authors connected with Germaine de Staël in Paris, Coppet, Berlin, and Florence maintained salons and addressed political conflicts in their novels, correspondence and theory. Nationalist histories, also written by salon members, reinforced their unified political agenda by emphasizing the heroic acts that guaranteed national freedom. Semiotics became the primary means of political propaganda and persuasion in the absence of legislative debate and women’s suffrage.\n\nPrice: $319.95\n\nDuffy, Jennifer O'Connor\n\n2008 0-7734-5098-X 232 pages\n\nThis book explores the experiences of working-class students in higher education at Radcliffe College during the years 1940-1970.
