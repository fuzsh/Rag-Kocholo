        "text": "[name_u]Sol[/name_u] made it onto my boy’s name list followed closely by [name_m]Saul[/name_m]. Like my other kids, it’s a Hebrew name that works in Spanish and [name_f]English[/name_f]. I like [name_u]Sol[/name_u] a lot. It seems modern and fresh, but it seems like an established name. The traditional nickname is [name_m]Solly[/name_m] which I also love.\n\nI also like [name_m]Saul[/name_m]. It feels like it could hit the sweet spot of old man names with a modern sound. However, [name_u]Sol[/name_u] means peace and that is really resonating for me.\n\nIf I went with [name_u]Sol[/name_u], especially for a boy, would it be forever assumed that the child’s name is [name_m]Saul[/name_m]? Traditionally, [name_u]Sol[/name_u] (like Solomon) and [name_m]Saul[/name_m] are pronounced the same [name_f]English[/name_f].\n\n(It’s also on my list for a girl now. In which case I would pronounce it like “soul”. I like the double meaning of sun in Spanish and peace in Hebrew).\n\nI think both names are lovely\n\nHowever I have a softer spot for [name_u]Sol[/name_u] and honestly [name_u]Sol[/name_u] feels very recognisable therefore I do not feel that [name_u]Sol[/name_u] would be mistaken for [name_m]Saul[/name_m]. Similarly I think [name_m]Saul[/name_m] is recognisable that he will not be mistaken for [name_u]Sol[/name_u]. In a nutshell I do not think this should be a major concern. I really love [name_u]Sol[/name_u] and if you love him I would go for it.\n\nI would assume a boy named [name_u]Sol[/name_u] is pronounced like “Soul”, which I love!\n\nI don’t say either name like “sawl” in [name_f]English[/name_f], but due to the popular show, perhaps [name_m]Saul[/name_m] would be the most straightforward choice if you do want to achieve that pronunciation.\n\n[name_u]Sol[/name_u] could also work, but I do think it would get mixed up more often.\n\n[name_u]Love[/name_u] [name_u]Sol[/name_u]! As well as the “peace” meaning from [name_m]Solomon[/name_m], the “sun” meaning in several languages has always really appealed to me – such gorgeous imagery and really matches the warm, laid-back feel of this name to me.\n\n[name_m]Saul[/name_m] is a completely different name with a different sound (in my accent) and vibe. I do quite like it, but it feels less fresh than [name_u]Sol[/name_u], but still cool in an old-school revival kind of way.\n\nI’d put [name_m]Saul[/name_m] in a category with names like [name_m]Joel[/name_m] and [name_u]Moses[/name_u] and [name_u]Amos[/name_u], and [name_u]Sol[/name_u] in a category with names like [name_u]Kit[/name_u] and [name_u]Jem[/name_u] and [name_m]Cas[/name_m]."
