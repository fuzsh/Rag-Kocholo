Though Samuel's words contained the promise of supreme power, - for to whom less than a king could all that was desirable in Israel belong? - yet Saul probably regarded them as a high-flown compliment, such as Orientals love to use, and gave a modest and proper answer. Benjamin, already the smallest tribe, had been so crushed that its power must have been very small, and Soul's house, though opulent, was not a leading one; how then could one of its members expect so high a dignity? For families of the tribe of Benjamin the Hebrew has \"tribes,\" probably owing to some confusion with the words \"tribes of Israel\" just before.
