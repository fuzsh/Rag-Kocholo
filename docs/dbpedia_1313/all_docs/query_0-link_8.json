Fisher\n\nHistorians have—until recently—followed a rather standard chronology when recounting the story of Catholicism in the United States. The narrative began by retracing the trail of Franciscan missionaries in the sixteenth-century Southwest—which was blazed prior to the arrival of Anglo-Protestants along the Eastern Seaboard— and moved on to Jesuits in New France (Canada) early in the following century. These historical accounts drew on primary sources originally intended to record the Catholic encounter with Native American peoples and their environment, including the astounding reports filed by Jesuits in Canada to their religious superiors in France, which constitute some of the earliest works of American literature, anthropology, and theology and offer an alternative New World “creation narrative,” with the Upper Midwest and Mississippi Valley playing the role the Atlantic Coast colonies later fulfilled for British Protestants.1 The forcibly diminished French and Spanish presences within the future United States of America consigned their legacies to the shadow side of the new nation’s history, but Catholicism itself became a visible presence in the new nation, often serving as a live object of ambivalence among nineteenth-century Protestants. By 1850 Catholicism was the largest religious denomination in the United States; so it remains to this day. American Protestant Christianity has always boasted a substantial aggregate majority of religious adherents, but Protestantism was broken into so many movements by the mid-nineteenth century that no single Protestant group equaled in size the nation’s Catholic populace. Roughly 12 percent of the U.S. total by 1850, Catholicism’s “market share” of the nation’s believers would double by 1900. 1\n\n2\n\nMargaret M. McGuinness and James T. Fisher\n\nMany mid- to late nineteenth-century Protestants who cherished their deep spiritual roots in the nation’s soil fretted that the growing Catholic presence in America was disproportionate to the church’s status as an ancient religion in a new country. The U.S. church was orga nized into dioceses—territorial jurisdictions led by bishops—linked in turn to often-unwieldy structures of authority administered by the Holy See in Rome. Protestants worried about this “Roman connection,” which would indeed strengthen throughout the nineteenth century, but American Catholics were generally much less interested in Rome than in Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, and dozens of other burgeoning communities where spiritual and material ser vices provided by the church filled pressing needs and opened vast frontiers of opportunity. In the half-century that followed the Civil War, U.S. Catholics built the largest network of private elementary schools in world history; took possession of the Democratic Party’s political machinery, which operated most of the nation’s largest cities; raised hundreds of orphanages and hospitals staffed largely by members of booming Catholic women’s religious communities; and opened scores of colleges and universities for women and men. The rapid growth of American Catholicism, along with the schools, hospitals, and orphanages built to serve the needs of the Catholic population, often led to the development of an American anti-Catholic—or “nativist”—impulse that sometimes targeted not just the church as an institution, but those vestigial Catholic forces and institutions bedeviling Protestants. In August 1834, for example, the Ursuline convent at Charlestown, Massachusetts, was burned to the ground by a nativist mob, but the girls’ school destroyed in the conflagration (staffed by Ursuline nuns from the convent) enrolled daughters of the locally unpopular Unitarian [Protestant] elite in greater numbers than it did Catholic schoolgirls. Hostility to Catholicism was one thing; in practice this impulse was often refracted through struggles between Protestant Americans divided by social class, political outlook, or geography. The enduring complexity of American Protestants’ “Catholic problem” was one good reason, as historian R. Laurence Moore astutely noted in Religious Outsiders and the Making of Americans (1986), that “after the Civil War virulent anti-Catholicism was a weaker force in American life than Catholicism.” This relative degree of security enabled late nineteenth-century Catholic leaders to expansively debate the proper role for their church in the United States or, as Moore put it, “to imagine more than one way to press their collective fortunes in America.”2 The literature of U.S. Catholic history has both recorded and reflected that debate; at times historical works have even shaped the dialogue. While it is true that U.S. Catholic historiography from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century ritually extolled heroic explorers and church hierarchs while eschewing potentially divisive issues, at least one biographical study of a prominent Catholic triggered a late nineteenth century intrachurch controversy that resulted in a harsh, ill-informed, but momentous response from the Holy See. In 1891 Walter Elliott, an American priest of a religious community known as the Paulists, authored a hagiography of the congregation’s founder, Isaac Hecker, a German American from a Protestant immigrant family and a one-time Transcendentalist who in 1844 communed for six months with fellow nature mystics and utopians at Brook Farm in Massachu setts. Hecker converted to Catholicism shortly after leaving the\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\ncommune, and as subsequent leader of the Paulists his ardent cultivation of the Holy Spirit’s stirrings fostered a uniquely openhearted, optimistic, and distinctly American Catholic spirituality.3 A French translation of Hecker’s biography led to Leo XIII issuing a condemnation of what came to be called “Americanism.” The church was neither a democracy nor an instrument for cultural and political adaptation, the pontiff scolded James Gibbons—the highly influential cardinal archbishop of Baltimore—in the 1899 “apostolic letter” Testem Benevolentiae.4 During the first six decades of the twentieth century, American Catholic historians, whose work was shaped by the Americanist controversy, chose to move away from the nineteenth-century debate over the place of the church in the United States and focus on the more genteel elements of their community’s past. As William M. Halsey explained in The Survival of American Innocence (1980), accounts of the putatively orderly lives of notable and less-notable bishops and priests affirmed “the American Catholic labor of mind to maintain a sense of control over experience” just at that moment when “the American scene drifted into the unpredictable.” In Halsey’s persuasive argument, early and mid-century American Catholic intellectuals of the twentieth century sought to uphold that serene quality of “innocence” long forsaken by others in the light of personal experience, scientific revelation, and the newfound existential frisson of religious doubt.5 Only in the decade following the Second World War did Catholic historians acknowledge their own complacency, most notably in a ringing jeremiad leveled by the church’s leading professional historian, Msgr. John Tracy Ellis of the Catholic University of America. In “American Catholics and the Intellectual Life” (1955), Ellis blasted Catholic educators for aping the least attractive features of American life while spurning its more desirable traditions of intellectual and creative freedom. Surmounting these obstacles proved a tall order: Ellis was himself given to a somewhat mannered, courtly style of historical scholarship. The deeply engrained “labors of mind” identified by William M. Halsey proved difficult to break.6 Beginning in the late 1960s and across the long scholarly generation that followed, Catholic and secular historians alike systematically dismantled historic claims to American “exceptionalism.” Although the militant legacy of Catholic anti-Communism often continued to contribute to the structure of the narrative— some Catholic and ex-Catholic historians helped expose the U.S. church’s role in promoting holy-war interventions in Southeast Asia— other historians deftly sidestepped the dominant anti-Communist paradigm by reconstructing alternative histories of Catholic pacifism and “countercultural” or “prophetic” movements of resistance to militant nationalism.7 The unsavory tone of U.S. Catholic anti- Communism chronicled by these scholars helped account for the rebirth of the Catholic Worker movement as a staple of historical inquiry during and after the Vietnam War era. The Catholic Worker is rooted primarily in the United States, but studies of less well-known movements such as the Grail, an enduring rural communitarian experiment for Catholic laywomen poised somewhere between a vocation to religious life and more worldly callings, the Young Christian Workers, and the Young Christian Students reminded readers that other groups were European born and adapted themselves to American soil.8\n\n4\n\nMargaret M. McGuinness and James T. Fisher\n\nHistorians of U.S. Catholicism trained far less attention on issues demanding a comparative perspective linking Catholic action to secular American social movements, especially labor activism and its encounter with Catholic forces strategically deployed far outside the church’s traditional confines. In secular accounts focusing on the “age of the CIO”— in historian Michael Denning’s phrase— Catholics were largely absent beyond an oftengrudging admission that they dominated the rank and file in most major industries orga nized by the fledgling, industrial union– oriented Congress of Industrial Organizations. (One most revealing episode from that fugitive history, the fervid struggle waged during the interwar decades between Catholics and Communists for the allegiance of African Americans, is treated herein for the first time in all its revealing particulars.)9 The confluence of political, religious, and intellectual tumult in the 1960s and 1970s finally yielded a “post-Americanist” Catholic historiography signaling the most dramatic paradigm shift in the tradition’s history. Several distinct strains gradually emerged in the spirit of the Second Vatican Council (1962–65), whose invitation to a renewed Catholic intellectual life engaged forms of secular thought customarily off-limits to Catholics. The first phase can be identified as a vigorously interdisciplinary mode of historical scholarship that began in the early 1980s and overlapped with a small but influential American Catholic Studies movement that emerged during that same decade. Popu lar devotions, Catholic material culture, and the meanings of sacred space were among topics explored in scholarly depth for the first time during these years by historians of U.S. Catholicism. These studies were often methodologically innovative and even daring; they drew on approaches fostered by secular fields of cultural and literary studies and engaged issues of gender, sexuality, and social class more forthrightly than earlier scholarship in the field. The cultural-studies turn within U.S. Catholic historiography yielded rich material for incorporation within broader narratives of U.S. social and cultural history, though its influence was more deeply witnessed in the field of religious studies than in U.S. history proper.10 A second wave of post-Americanist historical scholarship highlighted the “prophetic” dimension of Christian thought and practice championed by moral theologians and ethicists. These scholars were located most often in religious studies and theology programs, where growing numbers of U.S. Catholic historians experienced some of their intellectual and spiritual formation. From this perspective, devotees of the prophetic turn viewed Americanist historiography as not simply outdated but nearly idolatrous in its desire to reconfirm the enduring compatibility of American and Catholic traditions. At the same time, a newly minted “radical orthodoxy” movement found favor among substantial numbers of younger Catholics attracted to the uncompromising zeal of these prophetically inclined scholars, whose quest for a purified Catholicism pointed away from the comparative, boundary-crossing scholarship of the 1980s and early 1990s in favor of rediscovered classic Christian sources, most notably the tradition of natural law, that buttressed many works of contemporary apologetics.11 A third stream of post-Americanist historiography found some younger scholars exploring themes like natural law and the historic Catholic quest for moral order not as advocates of these traditions’ prescriptive or normative value, but simply because such forces—generally downplayed by the Americanist school—may be discerned empirically,\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nat work throughout much of U.S. Catholic history. These historians reexamined the relationships between Catholic authority and the conditions in which it operated, from colonial Maryland to nineteenth-century frontier missions to the twentieth-century national mission against Communism and moral disorder.12 Contemporary chroniclers of U.S. Catholicism—like most historians generally— are driven less by methodological or ideological concerns than by the desire to tell a good and meaningful story. Contributors to Roman Catholicism in the United States: A Thematic History vary in outlook and approach, but all share herein with readers compelling stories of women and men bearing witness to intimately held convictions in ecclesial, political, and social-historical settings. Many of these essays are linked by a common desire to enrich narratives of United States history via attentiveness to the engagement of American Catholics with the public and communal dimensions of American life. All of the essays blend materials from religious and historical studies in illuminating the U.S. Catholic experience. The essays in this volume represent ways of looking at the history of U.S. Catholicism that move beyond hierarchical organization and parish structure. They are loosely grouped into three categories: “Beyond the Parish,” “Engaging the World,” and “Prophetic Catholicism.” The essays in Part I, entitled, “Beyond the Parish,” focus on aspects of Catholic history that are not connected to the “traditional” urban immigrant parish. Part II, “Engaging the World,” offers readers some examples of how Catholics and Catholic culture interacted with the larger society from a variety of perspectives. In Part III, entitled “Prophetic Catholicism,” readers will find examples of how prophetic and creative aspects of Catholicism have played important roles in both church and society. The scholars represented in this volume explore ways the faithful practiced their beliefs while engaging Americans holding dif ferent faith convictions or none; applied their faith to political issues; created art and literature; and prayed and worked for social change. These studies all convey a vivid sense of Catholic presence, the recognition of which by readers and scholars can only enhance prospects for narrative wholeness in subsequent works of U.S. social and religious history.\n\nPart I: Beyond the Parish The “immigrant church” (roughly covering the period 1830s–1940s) motif is so integral to American Catholic historical identity that alternative models are rarely proffered. Yet long before the advent of that immigrant church there was a Southwest borderlands Hispanic church, an Upper Midwest French church, and a California mission church. There was also a European Catholic Church of history and myth that— despite its remoteness in time and space—inhabited a large region in the imaginations of American Protestants who likely never encountered an actual Catholic person. The essays in Part I identify and treat formative locations of American Catholicism found in places other than the urbanimmigrant parish neighborhood. These works affirm a much broader foundation of Catholic presences than found in canonical versions of United States history.13\n\n6\n\nMargaret M. McGuinness and James T. Fisher\n\nThe opening essay, “Ambiguous Welcome,” by Patrick Allitt, examines aspects of American Catholic history that lay outside the commonly told story of parishes and immigrants by surveying the efforts of American Protestants—from the colonial era to the present—to properly map that Catholic place in the life of their nation and their own religious sensibilities. Allitt shows how the ambivalent greeting initially extended to Catholic immigrants by U.S. Protestants was shelved for outright hostility during the nativist era prior to the Civil War, when the mass emigration of impoverished, famine-stricken Irish Catholics greatly aggravated preexisting fears of “popish superstition.” At the same time a number of Protestants— often from elite backgrounds—found themselves powerfully drawn to Catholic art and ritual, and more than a few took the plunge into religious conversion. If mass immigration largely shaped the social contours of American Catholicism, Catholic converts proved extraordinarily influential in the spiritual and intellectual life of the church, from Elizabeth Ann Bayley Seton—who founded a women’s religious community in the early nineteenth century and was canonized in 1975 as the first native-born American saint—to Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton, surely the two most influential spiritual leaders in twentieth-century U.S. Catholic life. Allitt also shows that beyond the mixed feelings many Protestants harbored toward the Catholic Church lay a host of substantive and genuinely divisive issues, responses to which not only shaped Protestant-Catholic relations but eventually prompted American Catholics to assert their convictions when the church deliberated on matters of social justice, religious liberty, and theologies of pluralism. In the 1970s public controversies linking religion and politics saw some Catholics forge extra-ecclesial alliances as oppositional blocs against Catholic-led groups holding divergent views. The clerical sex abuse scandal that broke out in 2002 (nearly a decade after this catastrophic phenomenon first received widespread attention) revived some ancient hostilities toward the church; much more importantly, it prompted Catholics to demand accountability from their appointed leaders and to assume greater responsibility for the church’s direction. Regionally focused essays by Timothy Matovina and Jeffrey Burns invite the repositioning of American Catholicism’s early and expansive Western presence at the heart of U.S. historical narratives. The Catholic prehistory of America rarely garners detailed treatment in standard accounts of the nation’s origins. Yet, as Timothy Matovina explains in “Latino Catholics in the Southwest,” the Catholic presence in that borderlands region is nearly twice as old as the United States itself. Colonial-era Latinos were not immigrants; a new and ever-expanding American nation-state migrated during the nineteenth century into terrains called home by Latinos for centuries. Later many Latinos did migrate to the American Southwest: first from Mexico, and later from all precincts of Latin America. The multifaceted Latino Catholic communities they created gave birth to forms of Christian witness and worship integral to contemporary American Catholic life— especially in parishes where changing demographics meant a tradition from congregations traditionally composed of Catholics of European descent to those that primarily identify as Hispanic— notwithstanding the habit of scholars to equate the origins of devotional Catholicism largely with European immigrant peoples.\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nTimothy Matovina reaffirms that many Native Americans dreaded the notorious Spanish missions— -the original Catholic institutions founded in the future United States—as “alien and coercive,” but in recovering the early nineteenth-century leadership role at southern California’s San Gabriel Mission of Eulalia Perez, Matovina begins to highlight “an element of Latino Catholicism that has been significant throughout the history of the region: the faith and leadership of women.” Latinas not only took the lead in community rituals and annual Guadalupe feast-day celebrations, he explains, but later pioneered in advocacy for social justice via such organizations as Las Hermanas (“the sisters”) founded in 1971 by members of women’s religious communities in Texas. In “Left Coast Catholicism,” Jeffrey Burns argues that independence, innovation, bold action, and openness to change—traditions uniquely nurtured in California from its beginnings— shaped Catholic experience in the Golden State. Burns’s treatment of the formative California missions focuses on the “first dissenter,” Fray José Maria Fernandez, a critic of the exploitation of Indians in the late 1790s who was persecuted by enemies (and later by many historians) as mad or brain-damaged yet endured in his advocacy work. Burns’s essay is replete with vivid, often stubborn Californians alternately viewed in their time as visionaries, troublemakers, or dissidents, yet nearly all found spaces in which to operate as Catholics. In California, Burns explains, dissent was understood as an integral component of local Catholic tradition. In the twentieth century, California Catholics engaged issues of great importance for the whole church; the local church engaged in vigorous dialogue that transcended parish boundaries. Archbishops, labor priests, and rank-and-file union members, for example, addressed questions of work and social justice with a directness and intensity rarely witnessed in eastern cities, where ethnic tribalism so often undermined concerted action, especially action that called the church to account for failures to practice its own social teachings. The independent spirit demonstrated by women’s religious communities in the postwar Golden State similarly presaged national developments and set high standards for integrity and commitment. The urbanization of California Catholicism was one development that lagged behind the national trend. By the time San Francisco—and much later Los Angeles—became major Catholic centers, the image of American Catholicism as an overwhelmingly urbanimmigrant phenomenon was already well established. U.S. Catholicism’s primal urban character is so familiar that the story told by Jeffrey Marlett in “Strangers in Our Midst” will jar even some practitioners of American religious history. Marlett recovers the distinctive spirituality and culture of agrarian Catholicism across an array of geographic locales. Church officials actively promoted rural colonization schemes for immigrants throughout the nineteenth century; once relocated, these pioneers shaped an agrarian spirituality blending Catholic tradition with communal folkways rooted in the JeffersonianAmerican legacy. By the time the church authorized an official “Catholic Rural Life Movement” in the early twentieth century, an eclectic Catholic rural culture was already well established and thriving. Though agrarian Catholicism varied by region, boundary-crossing innovation was a pervasive element, as was the adaptation of Catholic social thought to local\n\n8\n\nMargaret M. McGuinness and James T. Fisher\n\nconditions. The very remoteness of rural Catholics from an ever-centralizing church authority structure demonstrates a kind of American church not tied to urban parishes with well-defined geographic boundaries and allows agrarian Catholicism to be viewed as a site of authentic, enduring creativity. Roy Domenico’s essay entitled, “An Embassy to a Golf Course?” treats the most conspicuously Catholic location on earth; here the Eternal City doubles as a political capitol engaged in shifting patterns of diplomacy with an emerging North American nation. Conducted as an amiably low-key, informal relationship in the post-revolutionary period (“Unlike the French,” as Domenico explains, “the Americans never invaded the Papal States, nor did they kidnap and kill the pope”), the growth of American power— and an even more rapidly growing Catholic population—intrigued the Vatican, which in turn infuriated many non-Catholic U.S. citizens whenever the prospect of formal diplomatic recognition loomed. Protestants and other Americans questioned why the nation’s lone church beholden to a foreign potentate should be thus rewarded. When the Lateran Treaty of 1929 guaranteed Italy’s recognition of Vatican City’s sovereignty, the U.S government was faced with the delicate task of reckoning with— and sometimes abetting—the church’s global diplomatic initiatives. The Holy See was implicated in the enigmatically transatlantic political outlook of U.S. Catholics: while fully one-quarter of the nation’s populace was at least nominally allied with the universal church, these numbers never yielded anything like a unified bloc in support of an increasingly imperial papacy. Yet there remained an undeniably if elusively transnational component to American Catholic identity: critics of diplomatic recognition observed not unfairly that this Catholic “difference” factored into U.S. diplomatic calculations often favorable to the Holy See’s interests. By relocating Rome in the American religious and political landscape, Domenico’s comparative transnational perspective illuminates the complex triangular relationship among the American faithful, their national government, and the Holy See.14\n\nPart II: Engaging the World As individuals, Catholics helped to shape American culture from its origins. As the Catholic Church grew stronger by the mid-nineteenth century it generated a vast network of agencies and apostolates (initiatives inspired by the devotion of Jesus Christ’s apostles) serving the faithful. Increasingly self-confident displays of the church’s organizational prowess enshrined a robust version of “public Catholicism” difficult for fellow citizens to miss. Yet Catholics operating as Catholics in the public arena often plied two fronts, engaging the broader public while subtly dismantling the mutually imposed quarantine estranging their church from non-Catholic America.15 In “American and Catholic and Literature,” literary historian Una Cadegan notes that sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century European Catholic explorers and missionaries invented “American literature” (in the form of diaries, journals, and descriptive accounts\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nof their work intended for European sponsors). With the development of a print culture in the early national period, an American literature designed for a domestic audience began to emerge. The U.S. Catholic Church soon grew sufficiently well orga nized to generate its own separate literary apparatus meeting the varied needs of immigrants and acculturated readers alike. Catholics were melded into a parallel reading public by their common faith, largely insulated from a national literary industry supplying Protestant readers with tales of moral uplift and sentimental piety not so very different from the Catholic versions. In the early twentieth century, when a canon of classic American literary artistry fi nally emerged—immortalizing the likes of Hawthorne, Melville, Emerson, and Margaret Fuller— Catholic authors were excluded; erased too was the persistent engagement of these Protestant writers with Catholic themes in their major works, including perhaps the most canonical work of all: Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter. For decades, as Cadegan explains, American literary studies ignored the “complicated and ambivalent reactions” of these authors to Catholicism. A separate Catholic print culture continued to thrive, beyond whose parochial boundaries a small cohort of American Catholic authors crafted notable works “defined not just by their relationship to the church but individual encounters, with the transcendent reality the church embodies and mediates, with the time and place in which they live, and with their own personal history and circumstances.” A Catholic subculture steeped in the idea that one ought to be at least partially identified by parish membership was able to simultaneously orchestrate an astoundingly global network of missionary enterprises. Although the U.S. church inhabited “mission territory” in the Holy See’s estimation until 1908— despite being the richest and most generous national branch of the universal church— American Catholic overseas missionary work commenced in earnest before the turn of the century. In “Gospel Zeal,” Robert E. Carbonneau treats the dramatic multifront campaign pursued by American Catholic missionaries to China. These zealots negotiated relationships with the Chinese people, Protestant missionaries, U.S. government representatives, and with the Vatican, whose Asian interests rarely converged with American ambitions. Carbonneau also details the most vital missionary relationship of all: that between members of religious orders conducting expensive overseas apostolates and the “armchair missionaries” who supported them materially and followed the real missionaries’ exploits in popu lar magazines like The Sign, a publication of a missionary religious community of priests and brothers, the Congregation of the Passion (or “Passionists”). Few non-Catholic Americans ever encountered a Roman Catholic missionary, but nearly all were familiar with “the sisters,” members of women’s religious communities (“nuns,” strictly speaking, were members of cloistered communities; most U.S. sisters pursued active vocations outside monastic settings). These “women religious” were surely the most conspicuous signs of Catholic presence in the Unites States from the Civil War era (so many served as nurses in the war that for many ser vicemen of all faiths “sister” and “nurse” became virtual synonyms) through the 1960s. Members of women’s religious communities taught millions of parochial school students; others provided social ser vices to\n\n10\n\nMargaret M. McGuinness and James T. Fisher\n\nimmigrants and the poor. As Margaret M. McGuinness demonstrates in “Northern Settlement Houses and Southern Welfare Centers,” the Sisters of Our Lady of Christian Doctrine— among dozens of communities responding to the needs of immigrants— adapted the settlement house tradition founded by secular reformers with whom they shared many concerns with one fundamental difference: a sacramental worldview inspiriting apostolic work for personal rebirth and social renewal. Religious communities like the Sisters of Our Lady of Christian Doctrine provided women with opportunities for lives in leadership and ser vice, sometimes in daunting locales. Having established a successful neighborhood program on New York’s Lower East Side, the sisters were invited in 1940—with Al Smith himself as broker—to open a community welfare center in an impoverished, overwhelmingly Protestant corner of South Carolina. The women fostered handicrafts and cultural programs, adapting again a borrowed form—in this case the New Deal’s culture-based regional uplift strategy—with creativity and passion. Soon the local community “embraced the sisters as both neighbors and friends.” But by the 1960s the sisters were compelled to close both their northern and southern centers amid a precipitous decline in sisterly vocations and a growing shift toward state-sponsored social ser vices. The demise of such innovative ministries marked the end of an era that saw women religious forge enduring relationships with the immigrant and rural poor and with elite non-Catholic reformers. Sisters enhanced the public image of U.S. Catholicism and the self-appraisal of their coreligionists. An analogous process was on display at the movies in the twentieth century. In “Pulp Catholicism,” Anthony Burke Smith assays some of the roles Catholics played in the art form/industry that shared with jazz music a distinction as the most influential American cultural product of the twentieth century. Smith uncovers a rich, nearly lost history of apostolic film production—launched prior to 1920!—under the auspices of the Catholic Art Association. Catholic tastemakers’ relatively sophisticated embrace of visual mass culture stood in marked contrast to the later heavy-handed censorship motive that was often ascribed to the church. As Smith shows in this nuanced account, the film industry’s original production code was written in 1930 by the prominent film-friendly Jesuit and theatrical impresario Daniel Lord; in later incarnations a harsher code was enforced with gusto by a small group of highly influential laymen. Smart-talking Irish Catholics were virtually synonymous with the archetypal urban American ubiquitous in popular films of the 1930s. The two decades that followed witnessed a spate of transethnic Catholic films in several genres: favorite themes ranged from the sentimental piety of beloved nuns and clerics to hard-boiled urban adventure. Catholic directors like John Ford made classic movies (Westerns, in Ford’s case) expeditiously in ser vice of a studio system faintly analogous at least to the hierarchical church (with Ford as on-set hierarch, especially in his dealings with actors). When that system finally cracked in the 1960s, gifted cinematic insurgents like Martin Scorsese—bearing a pedigree in classic cinema studies and mean city streets—potently blended ethnic Catholic experience and Hollywood convention into “sacraments of genre,” in film scholar Leo Braudy’s memorable phrase.16\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nPart III: Prophetic Catholicism Dismay over the clergy sex abuse crisis helped revive a movement among younger Catholic intellectuals in the new century: an impulse that had first surfaced a decade earlier. The brand of prophetic Catholicism sought by these scholars and activists was itself a reinvention of a 1930s movement—at once radical and anti-modernist—blending liturgical innovation and social action. For prophetic Catholics of that earlier era, communal worship performed vital apostolic work in and for the mystical body of Christ. Six decades later historians found this tradition attractive both as research subject and source of an uncompromising scholarly vocation. This prophetically Catholic impulse animates Christopher Shannon’s “American Catholic Social Thought in the Twentieth Century.” Shannon argues that the best early twentieth-century Catholic social thinkers engaged the broader culture but were never assimilated by it. Their sacramental imaginations and openness to supernatural intervention represented a sign of contradiction against the faith-free academic social science in rapid ascent at the time. This prophetic option was especially appealing to converts, antimodernists, and ex-radicals, but in the 1930s and 1940s it slowly found favor among a cohort of young ethnic Catholics, particularly those exposed to the Catholic Worker movement. Shannon advances the highly provocative argument that sporadic attempts by prophetic Catholics to influence secular culture undermined the movement’s spiritual foundation. John A. Ryan is the pivotal figure here: Shannon privileges Ryan’s uncompromising Catholic militancy—as he sees it— over against the pragmatic coalition-building “Right Rev. New Dealer” evident in Ryan’s ardent minimum-wage advocacy. That Ryan could fill both roles indicates just why debates within the tradition of Catholic social thought/action confound recourse to the facile binaries of liberal vs. conservative, radical vs. traditionalist, or modernist vs. reactionary. The creative and prophetic dimension of Catholic social thought often disclosed itself in times of moral and political crisis. As Cecilia Moore demonstrates in “Catholics, Communism, and African Americans,” the integrity of “integral Catholics” was put to a stern test by the American church’s willingness to countenance racism in the early and middle decades of the twentieth century. Although white ethnic communities had been provided with national parishes of their own since the late nineteenth century, expressions of African American ethnic/racial solidarity were widely viewed as an affront to the all-encompassing theology of the mystical body of Christ. Moore shows how this patronizing racial ideology was shaken only after the Communist Party won substantial numbers of black converts in the 1930s and beyond. This unprecedented challenge from the Left mobilized a Catholic interracial apostolate led by patrician clerics in collaboration with such black leaders as Dr. Thomas Wyatt Turner, head of the Federated Colored Catholics, an advocacy group that worked with the prominent Jesuit John LaFarge and others to highlight the church’s more progressive racial teachings. Goaded from within the church by Catholic radicals like the\n\n12\n\nMargaret M. McGuinness and James T. Fisher\n\npriest-sociologist Paul Hanly Furfey and from without by Communists, the interracial movement sought the “prudent” integration of Catholic institutions in the late 1930s and 1940s. Collegian-activists were mobilized (especially on Catholic women’s campuses), and a racial justice ideology slowly developed. “Catholics, Communism, and African Americans” shows how the issue of race was refracted through the church’s balky political and ideological apparatus, even as racism itself posed an enduring challenge to U.S. Catholicism’s moral standing. Rivalry with Communists on the ground—whether in black urban enclaves like Harlem or in the Jim Crow South— exerted a transformative effect on many Catholics, even if their initial motive was to shore up the church’s left flank against ideologically motivated attack. Some Catholics succeeded in recasting racial segregation from an unfortunate vestige of “original sin” to a social and personal sin committed by confirmed Christians in the present moment. In 1944 the Jesuits’ Saint Louis University became the first institution of higher learning in a former slave state to admit black students, but only after a Jesuit preacher implored students attending a Mass to stand up and acknowledge the sinfulness of racial exclusion (that Jesuit, Claude Heithaus, was quickly banished from his campus post). When the young Milwaukee priest James Groppi was asked in 1965 why he marched alongside local African American children boycotting public schools to protest racial inequality, he replied, “I didn’t think I had a choice.” Groppi is profiled in James P. McCartin’s “Praying in the Public Square.” McCartin reaffirms that deep into the postwar era “integralism—the integration of Christian practice into all activities of one’s everyday life—provided the spiritual foundation for Catholic activism.” Integral Catholics heeded the call of American Jesuit Gerald Ellard to “live . . . with the life of Christ living within us.” As McCartin demonstrates, this practice of piety changed politics, and then piety itself was changed via personal experiences of prophetic Catholicism in action. This prophetic mode became Dorothy Day’s “radical” daily witness beginning in the 1930s; three decades later it approached normative status among a wide swath of Catholics from all walks of life. Widespread Catholic discontent with U.S. foreign policy during the Vietnam War era swelled the prophetic ranks; that same war exposed deep and ominous fissures within the church itself. Growing political divisions among Catholics always overshadowed doctrinal dissent; as McCartin explains, the battle over legalized abortion in the post-Roe years did not polarize Catholic opinion as dramatically as it introduced a wholly new national political dynamic that wrecked the historic alliance of urban Catholics and the Democratic Party. Before the abortion issue was largely reduced to a culture war between the religious right and secular liberals, some Catholics activists applied the same kind of prophetic witness to the pro-life cause as they had to the peace movement of the 1960s. But the realignment of national political culture resulted in a pro-life movement dominated by conservative evangelicals and a segment of the Catholic community opposed to abortion as part of a wider neo-traditionalist reaction against modern culture. The collapse of the putatively insular American Catholic subculture in the decade after the Second Vatican Council is a familiar trope pending exhaustive historical inquiry. The stirring opening of the church to the world proclaimed at the Council was surely welcome\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nnews to American Catholics transfixed by the epochal event, whose four successive autumnal sessions were held in Rome’s St. Peter’s Basilica between 1962 and 1965. The Council’s inspiriting metaphor of aggiornamento (“bringing up to date”) resonated globally but was celebrated in a special way by Americans, who saw their unique if undervalued traditions vindicated in several key documents from Vatican II. In her essay “The Resurrection Project of Mexican Catholic Chicago,” Karen Mary Davalos offers a historical ethnography of community building in Chicago’s historic Pilsen neighborhood on that city’s Near West Side. Davalos’s narrative focuses on the Resurrection Project, a post–Vatican II interparish coalition of solidarity coordinated by Mexican Catholic women who create from their work “a Catholicism that unites the mundane and the sacred through a precondition that envisions salvation on Earth.” Though Davalos intentionally locates her subjects outside “the historiography of American Catholicism in its description of clergy, ministry, and devotional practices inside the church,” this essay bears a strikingly prophetic quality not only for where the U.S. church is heading but also for where it has been— a story that may stand outside canonical historiography but surely not the lived experience of Catholic people. There is a tantalizingly unique dimension of Davalos’s narrative, likely due to the special conditions of Mexican Catholic history in Chicago— a story that begins in 1916 with the arrival of railroad workers (and sometime strikebreakers) on the city’s Near West Side. Chicago’s first Mexican Catholics were immediately subject to Americanization schemes sponsored by the local archdiocese; just as quickly they found themselves agents of ethnic succession when a historically Italian parish (originally German) was converted to a Mexican church. St. Francis Assisi parish soon sponsored carnivals and Guadalupana devotions, the primal stuff of urban Catholic myth and memory. In later years support from the church for reconstituted Mexican Chicago communities ebbed and flowed: sometimes the community was blessed by the presence of a remarkable worker-priest; at others Mexicans were viewed with indifference by church officials, leaving the community to draw deeply from its own resources. Women took the lead, but laity and their clergy alike, Davalos suggests, learned to “use their social experiences as the starting point for theological discourse.” That social experience included racism in the form of a commonplace belief that Chicago’s Mexicans are all illegal aliens and structural economic disadvantage rooted in the now-ancient post-industrial character of Pilsen and surrounding areas. The Resurrection Project “responds to the materiality of Mexican Chicago,” as Davalos explains. The reversal of conventional Catholic expectation in this unabashed grounding of the spiritual in the material generated modes of theological reflection that in turn changed a community’s social and religious experience. In the concluding essay, “The People of God,” Chester Gillis shows that the Second Vatican Council called the whole church to engage the world in a spirit of joy and hope. The U.S. Catholic bishops—following an unprecedented process of consultation with other citizens—gradually adopted a prophetic stance as world citizens rather than imperial monarchs. In the 1980s, the U.S. bishops attracted global notice via their pastoral letters on nuclear weaponry and economic justice. As Gillis explains, there were no more bars to the church’s wholehearted participation in the public arena, but the bishops’ intended\n\n14\n\nMargaret M. McGuinness and James T. Fisher\n\naudience— especially including many Catholics—now ascribed an advisory role at best to these shepherds’ teachings. Church leaders operated within a competitive marketplace of ideas—ideas warily assessed by consumers regardless of their source. Chester Gillis’s essay reflects historian James P. McCartin’s contention earlier in this volume that the political realignment of abortion foes in the 1980s and 1990s cast many bishops as transparently partisan operatives whose dictates were widely viewed as strictly advisory. And all this came before the scandal of sex abuse and its cover-up was reignited in 2002, which Gillis rightly calls the “most painful, disturbing and publicly embarrassing chapter” in U.S. Catholic history. In light of the challenges facing historians of U.S. Catholicism—including the sexualabuse scandal that rocked the church during the first decade of the twenty-first century and the growing divide between traditionalist and progressive bishops and laypeople, the essays in this volume are exemplary for the good will and generosity that complement the originality of their scholarship. The communal spirit underlying these works is palpable, as though to reaffirm the vitality and the sense of solidarity that has marked U.S. Catholic historical scholarship for decades and now extends to the next generation of scholars as they embrace the joys and challenges of this enduring tradition.17 NOTES\n\n1.

The Catholic Church and Catholic immigrants, at times, were among the victims. The nation also has a long tradition of civility and tolerance, of which at other times Catholics were the beneficiaries. The story of America’s attempts to persecute, exclude, or reject Catholics should be balanced against its welcome for and inclusion of them. Otherwise the development of an immense, thriving, fully acculturated U.S. Catholic population by the mid-twentieth century would be incomprehensible. This chapter surveys the history of Protestant reactions to Catholics and their church from the colonial era to the present. It demonstrates that verbal and physical attacks on Catholics were, in many eras, offset by some Protestants’ attraction to Catholicism and that the phenomenon of public anti-Catholicism, potent in the nineteenth century, disappeared almost completely after the 1960s. The three or four thousand Catholics in the pre-revolutionary American colonies came mainly from England. About four million Irish and German Catholic immigrants swelled their ranks between that era and the Civil War and transformed the character of U.S. Catholicism. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, eight or ten million more at least nominally Catholic immigrants arrived from Italy, Poland, and Southeastern Europe. In the twentieth century as many again arrived from Central and South America, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Most of these immigrants, in each generation, overcame initial difficulties, found work, intermarried, sent their children to American 21\n\n22\n\nPatrick Allitt\n\nschools, enjoyed upward social mobility, and benefited from the First Amendment’s guarantee of religious freedom. Other Americans, the vast majority of whom were always Protestants, rarely welcomed them. Why? The historian Barbara Welter once imagined a typical American Protestant’s objections to Catholicism as going something like this: “[W]e dislike [your] arrogance and elitism of claiming to be the ‘one, holy, catholic and apostolic’ church; we dislike [your] reliance on authority rather than on individual judgment; we dislike [your] substitution of a parochial for a public school system; we find celibacy unwholesome and perverse for the clergy . . . we oppose inflexible social rules masquerading as immutable natural laws; we oppose censorship in books; we prefer to read the Bible for ourselves and scorn official interpretation; we deplore the level of taste in architecture, statuary and hymns; [and] we shudder at the superstition surrounding the Virgin and the saints.”1 All the themes she noted in this hy pothet ical tirade have indeed played a role in U.S. Protestant-Catholic relations, and many of them persisted from the colonial era well into the twentieth century. Nevertheless, the Catholic way of life, which revolted some Protestants, attracted others. Many admired the Catholic Church from outside, especially its artistic, architectural, and literary achievements. Others modified their own religious practices and ideas under the influence of Catholic examples. A few even became convinced by its theological claims and converted to Catholicism. Attitudes were rarely religious alone, however; questions of religion were nearly always intermixed with questions of politics, race, ethnicity, and social class.\n\nThe Colonial Era The first English migrants to the New World in the 1600s, nearly all of them Protestants, brought with them a vivid set of convictions about Catholics. They understood the Reformation of the 1520s and 1530s as the moment when Christendom had emerged from the dark night of Catholic cruelty, superstition, and infamy and thought of it as part of the great cosmic drama being fought out between God and the Devil. They recalled that several leading English Protestants, notably, bishops Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer (“the Oxford Martyrs”), had been burned at the stake by Catholic Queen Mary I during her attempt to undo the English Reformation in the 1550s. They read lurid accounts of these executions in John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs (1559), one of the most popular Protestant books to make the crossing to the colonies, and one that would stay in print from the 1560s right into the twentieth century. Catholics, according to Protestants nurtured on Foxe and his successors, were tyrannical, immoral, cruel, and idolatrous. They were also active or latent traitors to England. Protestant settlers recalled Queen Elizabeth I’s defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 not merely as a naval victory over a rival power, but as a manifestation of divine providence. Their narratives emphasized that a “Protestant wind” had blown in the English Channel to aid Francis Drake’s ships and confound those of Spain. Catholicism, under the leadership of a sinister pope in alliance with foreign tyrants like Philip II of Spain, seemed to Protestants a constant threat to England and its colonies.\n\nAmbiguous Welcome\n\n23\n\nThe Puritan colonies founded in the 1600s—Plymouth (1620), Massachusetts Bay (1629), Rhode Island (1636), Connecticut (1636), and New Haven (1638)—were accordingly zealously anti-Catholic right from the beginning. Cotton Mather (1663–1728), the most prolific Puritan writer of the colonial era, echoed a common view when he argued that one of the principal reasons for the Protestant settlement of America was “to carry the Gospel into those parts of the world, and to raise a bulwark against the kingdom of Antichrist, which the Jesuits labor to rear up in all parts of the world.” By “Antichrist” he meant the pope. “[I]n the Pope of Rome, all the characteristics of that Antichrist are so marvelously answered that if any who read the Scriptures do not see it, there is a marvelous blindness upon them.”2 Anti-Catholic woodcuts, playing cards, and cartoons featuring lecherous priests could be found throughout colonial New England. A popular children’s schoolbook, the New England Primer (1683), blended lessons in the alphabet with a vigorous anti- Catholicism in passages like this: “Abhor the whore of Rome and all her blasphemies, and drink not of her cursed cup; obey not her decrees.”3 Not all seventeenth-century settlers in the American colonies were as fanatically opposed to Catholics as the New England preachers, to be sure. King Charles I granted a colonial charter to a Catholic convert, Cecilius Calvert, the Second Baron Baltimore, in 1632. The settlers who crossed the Atlantic to this new colony, Maryland, celebrated Mass on American soil for the first time in the spring of 1634. Maryland’s population was religiously mixed from the outset; its Toleration Act of 1649 imposed fines on anyone who tried to stir up intra-Christian conflict. Even in New England, moreover, the pattern was mixed. The chance arrival of individual Catholics (after a shipwreck, for example) was often taken calmly, so long as they carried no ecclesiastical authority. Gayle Brown, a historian of colonial-era anti-Catholicism, writes that “individual lay Catholics confronted on a face-to-face basis were less threatening to ordinary Protestants, and hence less likely to be the target of verbal or physical attack.” 4 The succession of colonial wars fought between Britain and France in the eighteenth century, culminating in the French and Indian War (1754–60), strengthened the idea that Catholicism meant, potentially, loyalty to the enemy. Indian tribes allied to the French had sometimes become at least nominally Catholic under Jesuit instruction; colonial commentators linked their ferocity in war to the idea of Catholic brutality. Narratives written by colonists taken captive in these wars often blended criticism of the Indians with criticism of their French Catholic allies. At the same time their Protestant authors expressed an uneasy awareness that the Jesuits had done a far better job at converting the Indians than they themselves. One captive wrote, “Oh, may not the zeal of Papists, in propagating Superstition and Idolatry, make Protestants ashamed of their lukewarmness, in promoting the religion of the Bible?”5\n\nThe Revolution Among the acts of Parliament that galvanized American revolutionary opposition to Britain was the Quebec Act of 1774, which offered religious toleration to the Catholic\n\n24\n\nPatrick Allitt\n\nmajority in Canada, the land Britain had recently won from France in the French and Indian Wars, and permitted tithing for the support of Catholic clergy in French Canadian districts. Bostonians were almost as incensed by this last concession as by the closing of their port, viewing it as a foot in the door for religious tyranny. They had been agitated, since 1763, by the rising possibility that an Anglican bishop might be sent to their colony. Bishops, in their view, were a vestige of Catholicism, a symbol of England’s incomplete Reformation, and an augury of tyrannical royal power. The Continental Congress replied to the Quebec Act by sending an address to the people of Britain listing a lengthy history of Catholic persecutions and atrocities. When the fighting began in 1775, nevertheless, most American Catholics sided with those advocating revolution. In recognition of the need for Catholic support, General George Washington suppressed Boston’s “Pope’s Day,” the annual anti- Catholic festival held every November 5 (to commemorate a failed Catholic attempt to blow up the Houses of Parliament in 1605). Over the years it had become a riotous apprentices’ parade, in which drunken workmen paraded an effigy of the pope through the streets before burning it on the town common. Aware that the success of the revolutionary cause depended in part on forming an alliance with Catholic France, and recognizing that the allegiance of colonial Catholics would also be useful, Washington urged a new interreligious discretion. An American army marched to Quebec and Montreal in the hope of enlisting Canadian aid to the revolutionary cause. General Washington reminded its commanders that they and their soldiers must treat Catholics and their institutions with respect and restraint. The army’s failure to do so— and some soldiers’ provocative insults and plundering of Canadian Catholics— contributed to the inability to win the Canadians’ allegiance. Charles Carroll, the richest and most prominent Catholic in Maryland, joined Benjamin Franklin in a delegation to Canada but found the Canadians resolute against joining the patriot cause. Carroll was a popu lar figure among pro-independence Marylanders for his outspoken criticism of the colony’s proprietors. In 1776 he became the one and only Catholic signatory of the Declaration of Independence. His dedication to the cause made a favorable impression on other revolutionary leaders. John Adams, for instance, wrote that Carroll “continues to hazard his all, his immense fortune . . . and his life,” while Benjamin Rush described him as “an inflexible patriot, and an honest independent friend to his country.”6 His enthusiasm for the revolution outweighed old suspicions of his faith, as he was well aware, and contributed to the muting of anti- Catholic sentiment. His home state, like Virginia, introduced the principle of complete religious liberty in its new constitution. Despite Carroll’s example, popular anti-Catholicism persisted on both sides of the revolutionary divide. An alliance with Catholic France from 1778 made some of the revolutionary leaders, such as Samuel Adams, uneasy, but most of them held their noses and accepted it for reasons of political convenience. It offered a propaganda opportunity to loyalists, however, who were quick to point out the hy pocrisy and the hazards of such an alliance. A New York Anglican rector, Charles Inglis, reproached the revolutionaries: “Is popery then changed? Is it purged from error and become less persecuting? No—it is now the very same as formerly. Its Inquisition still reeks with the blood of Protestants.”7\n\nAmbiguous Welcome\n\n25\n\nIronically, many of America’s most zealous Protestants had now decided to ignore Inglis’s warning and risk their future in an alliance with one of the great Catholic powers.\n\nAntebellum Tensions American Catholics’ support for the Revolution won the enthusiastic gratitude of Washington, Adams, Franklin, and Jefferson, but these revolutionary leaders had a more pragmatic, this-worldly outlook than most of their contemporaries. Militant Protestants throughout the new republic continued to believe that Catholicism was not merely another branch of Christianity but was, in effect, its antithesis, the religion of Antichrist. As the Second Great Awakening, a vast Protestant revival, gathered power after 1800, its Methodist and Baptist champions worked to disseminate the King James Bible and to “missionize” settlers on the rapidly expanding frontier. They worked in sharp rivalry not merely against each other, but against the imagined threat of Catholic infiltrators. Nativist newspapers like The Protestant and the American Protestant Vindicator (both published in New York during the 1830s) warned that Jesuits, the pope’s shock troops, were disguising themselves as “puppet show men, dancing masters, Music teachers, peddlers of images and ornaments [and] barrel organ players” in frontier territories, imperiling Protestant souls.8 Rumors spread in the old Northwest that Catholics might try to take over the Ohio Valley and close off a vast area from Protestant settlement. The Leopoldine Foundation, according to this theory, had been founded by Prince Klemens von Metternich, a diplomat of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to achieve this goal. If the theory were true, the arrival of German Catholic migrants in the Ohio country became a sinister fulfillment of the plot rather than a poor immigrant group’s simple search for economic opportunity. Lyman Beecher, one of the most famous Protestant preachers of his day (and father of Harriet Beecher Stowe), followed the Ohio migration and became president of Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati. He took seriously some of these nativist rumors, imagined that papal armies might actually seize Cincinnati, and told parishioners that the Catholic Church was “the most skillful, powerful, dreadful system of corruption to those who wield it, and of slavery and debasement to those who live under it.”9 His tract, A Plea for the West (1835), urged Protestants to rescue “the west” from the devious plans of Eu rope’s Catholic reactionaries, men like Metternich. Samuel Morse, an art professor at New York University who is best remembered today for his invention of telegraphy and Morse code, was even more zealous in his attacks. “We are the dupes of our hospitality,” he warned in Foreign Conspiracy against the Liberties of the United States (1834). “The evil of immigration brings to these shores illiterate Roman Catholics, the tools of reckless and unprincipled politicians, the obedient instruments of their more knowing priestly leaders.”10 Morse here linked anti-Catholicism with opposition to immigration. The two issues would be closely connected from then on for at least a century, especially when the immigrants in question were Irish. Prior to 1800 the nearly half million Irish immigrants in the United States were Protestants (the Scotch-Irish), but after 1800 growing numbers of\n\n26\n\nPatrick Allitt\n\nIrish Catholics also crossed the Atlantic, about 250,000 of them between 1820 and 1840. Many of them settled in East Coast cities, notably New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Boston. They originated in rural Ireland, but poverty forced most to become city dwellers in the United States. The Catholic stream became a flood during the mid- and late 1840s when famine in Ireland prompted emergency emigration on a huge scale— over a million in the five years after 1846, and three and a half million more between then and the end of the century. Malnourished immigrants were vulnerable to typhus, cholera, and other infectious diseases, with the result that many immigrant ships arrived off America bearing corpses and travelers on the brink of death. Horrified U.S. onlookers regarded them, not surprisingly, as a health menace. New York and Boston sent away many fever ships without letting them land; at least 30,000 immigrants who were permitted to come ashore in Montreal died within a year of their arrival. Charitable impulses led some Americans to help the suffering, but the famine created such an enduring impression among Protestants that the terms “Catholic,” “Irish,” “destitute,” and “diseased” became virtually interchangeable. A large-scale immigration of German Catholics further increased tensions. The establishment of Catholic churches, schools, and convents to help the new immigrants in East Coast and midwestern cities that had previously been predominantly Protestant provoked a strong negative reaction. Older American groups (who, confusingly, referred to themselves as “Native Americans”) not only feared the Catholics’ religion but resented them as competitors for jobs. Growing friction between Protestant and Catholic groups culminated in pitched street battles between teenage gangs and Protestant attacks on Catholic institutions. In August 1834, for example, a working-class Protestant mob burned to the ground a convent school in Boston run by Ursuline sisters, alleging that it held girls against their will and permitted priests to abuse them sexually. Although upper-class Protestants expressed disapproval at this act of vandalism, their eventual reaction suggests a less than wholehearted condemnation. Thirteen men, arrested red-handed at the scene of the crime and tried for setting the fire, were acquitted by sympathetic juries amid Protestant rejoicing. Street fighting in Philadelphia between Irish Catholics and anti-immigrant nativists lasted for three days in 1844 and ended with the destruction of the Irish Kensington neighborhood and the burning of several churches. Conflicts flared up again later that year and featured nativists firing scrap metal out of cannons into Catholic churches. Thirteen men died in the fighting, with hundreds more injured. At least twenty more were killed in Louisville, Kentucky, on August 6, 1855, “Bloody Monday,” when anti- Catholic politicians prevented naturalized Irish and German citizens from voting. Fights broke out at the polls, and a drunken Protestant mob rioted, vandalizing Catholic districts and beating residents. The mob set fire to an entire block of houses in one area and gunned down the residents as they fled from the flames.11 Contributing to the interreligious tension from the 1830s to the 1850s was a lurid body of anti-Catholic literature. Much of it purported to describe the horrible and perverted lives of nuns in convents. The most famous example was the Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk, or The Hidden Secrets of a Nun’s Life in a Convent Exposed (1836). Ostensibly the autobiography of a young Protestant girl who had converted to Catholicism and entered a\n\nAmbiguous Welcome\n\n27\n\nreligious community as a novice, it was in fact a fake, probably written by a Protestant minister named J. J. Slocum. It described her life in a Montreal convent as a form of torture, in which every aspect of liberty was denied and every opportunity to think for herself was taken away. Monk alleged that, after taking her vows, she and the other women became the sex slaves of lecherous local priests. She added that to avoid scandal in the outside world, they gave birth to babies in secret, baptized them, but then had to strangle them for burial in a mass grave underneath the convent. Those who did not cooperate were tortured, sometimes to death. William Leete Stone (1792–1844), a skeptical New York newspaper editor, investigated the convent in question with the local bishop’s permission and demonstrated the book’s falsity. The real Maria Monk (1816–49), a mentally retarded prostitute and pickpocket, died in prison a few years later. Nevertheless, the book itself remained in print throughout the nineteenth century and far into the twentieth, widely believed, despite its fraudulence having been proved repeatedly by Catholic (and fairminded Protestant) investigators. Protestant activists thought of Catholics not only as poverty-stricken peasants or sexually predatory priests, but also as the tyrants of old Europe, natural opponents of enlightened political change. They drew on U.S. political idealism to condemn the Catholic Church’s role in the European politics of the 1840s and 1850s. The papacy in those years opposed Hungarian independence from the Austro-Hungarian Empire as well as the movement for Italian unification, which threatened the Papal States in central Italy. This reaction to the era’s great political changes confirmed old Protestant fears that the church loved tyranny and dreaded liberty. A defrocked Italian monk, Alessandro Gavazzi (1809–89), now an Italian nationalist, toured the United States in the early 1850s preaching against the Catholic Church. He asserted that the pope’s representative, Archbishop Gaetano Bedini, who was visiting the country at the same time, had led papal troops in a massacre of Italian nationalists during the siege of Bologna in 1849. Worst of all, said Gavazzi, Bedini had killed the patriotic priest and nationalist hero Ugo Bassi that same year.12 Vast Protestant crowds turned out to hear Gavazzi confirm their worst fears. Meanwhile, the United States’ easy military victory over Mexico in the war of 1846–48 gave Protestants a sense of superiority over a decadent Catholic foe. The victors forced the vanquished to end the war by signing a humiliating treaty at Guadelupe-Hidalgo, scene of an apparition of the Virgin Mary, one of the holiest Catholic sites in Mexico, and a symbolic center of Mexican nationalism. Anti-Catholic sentiments took political shape in the creation of the American or “KnowNothing” Party, an ostensibly secret political organization founded in 1854, whose sworn Protestant members were supposed to disavow all knowledge of its activities. It grew out of the Order of the Star-Spangled Banner (founded 1850), whose members took an oath to work against all Catholic officeholders, never to hire Catholics, and never to vote for Catholic political candidates. The members were no good at keeping secrets, but they did influence the politics of the 1850s, as the Whig Party was breaking up. They even adopted as their own presidential candidate the ex-Whig president Millard Fillmore in 1856. Among the party’s proposed policies was an attempt to minimize immigrants’ growing political significance by changing the naturalization laws; immigrants would\n\n28\n\nPatrick Allitt\n\nhave to wait twenty-one years, instead of a mere five, before being allowed to vote. At street level, their heroes, like the New Yorker “Bill the Butcher” Poole (1821–55), led Protestant gangs against rival Catholic gangs affiliated with Democratic Tammany Hall. The Know-Nothings thrived on pseudo-ancient rituals, special forms of communication, secret handshakes, and conspiracy theories. When, as a gesture of good will to the United States, the pope sent an ancient carved stone from the Roman Temple of Concord to be built into the Washington Monument (then under construction on the Washington Mall), the Know-Nothings suspected the worst. Alleging that the stone’s incorporation into the completed monument would be the signal for a Catholic coup d’état, which would give the pope political power over the country, they stole it. It never reappeared. To make doubly sure of forestalling the coup, Know-Nothings seized control of the Monument Society, which oversaw construction of the monument, to prevent it from being finished. So it remained, a half-finished stump, until twenty years after the Civil War. If prejudice against Irish and German Catholics dominated the pre– Civil War story, however, it is offset in part by an undeniable attraction that some Americans felt for Catholicism. Among the American elite, in particular, the opportunity to visit Rome and see Catholicism “at home” fascinated a generation of travelers. The invention of transatlantic steamships made the journey much safer and faster after about 1840 than it had been in sailing ships. For some of these visitors, admittedly, the sights of Rome confirmed their belief that Catholicism was a gaudy fabric of superstition and idolatry. Others, by contrast, admired the city’s immense artistic heritage, its beautiful old churches, and the sense it gave of an ancient faith practiced the same way through the generations. Protestantism suddenly seemed to them, by contrast, to be rootless and callow. Struck by the romantic possibilities of Catholicism after a visit to Rome, the poet James Russell Lowell (1819–91) described the church as a “loving mother” and as “the only church that has been loyal to the heart and soul of man.” In the same vein Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–82) wrote in a letter to Margaret Fuller, in 1843, “It is a dear old church, the Roman I mean, and today I detest the Unitarians and Martin Luther.” Shrewd Catholic observers became aware of the attraction Protestants felt to the Catholic way of life and their tendency to romanticize it. One wrote that “our everyday life is the romance of their dreams.”13 Similarly, some American historians began to think about aspects of Catholic tradition in more positive ways. The nationalist historian George Bancroft, writing in the late 1830s, made heroes, not villains, out of the Jesuit priests who had pioneered the exploration of the American interior. “Their cloisters became the best schools in the world,” he wrote. “Their missionaries, kindling with a heroism that defied every danger and endured every toil, made their way to the ends of the earth. . . . The history of their labors is connected with the origin of every celebrated town in the annals of French America; not a cape was turned, not a river discovered without a Jesuit’s having shown the way.”14 This kind of celebratory rhetoric made a jarring contrast to that of preachers like Beecher and Morse, who depicted the Jesuits as sinister, devious, and corrupt. While the majority of these observers drew a line between admiring the Catholic heritage on the one hand and despising the Irish immigrants on the other, a few, both men and women, took the next step and converted to Catholicism, often rising to leadership\n\nAmbiguous Welcome\n\n29\n\nroles among their new brethren. Among the earliest was Elizabeth Ann Seton (1774–1821), who converted in 1805, founded a community of women religious known as the Sisters of Charity of St. Joseph, and was eventually named a saint. Another was Isaac Hecker (1819– 88), a friend of the Transcendentalist philosophers, who had become fascinated by Catholicism and underwent a succession of mystical experiences. Converting in 1844, he entered the priesthood and founded the Missionary Society of St. Paul the Apostle (Paulists), whose special mission was to convert Protestants. Sophia Ripley (1803–61), wife of the founder of the Transcendentalist commune Brook Farm, was another convert. A fourth was Orestes Brownson (1803–76), a restless religious seeker and religious controversialist who had made his way through most of the Protestant denominations before coming to rest in the embrace of Catholicism. Brownson’s Quarterly Review, nearly all of whose four thick annual issues he wrote himself, became the principal intellectual journal of U.S. Catholicism for the next quarter century. Even after his conversion, however, Brownson was not shy about writing critically about the Irish and lamenting that many Americans confused “Irish” with “Catholic.” The impact of conversion to Catholicism, usually the result of intense theological study, was far more profound than the impact of conversion to one of the rising Protestant denominations. It required converts to abandon many of the fundamental ideas they had grown up with and to endure the dismay— sometimes the hostility—of friends, neighbors, and family. As one historian observed, “For Catholic converts, the process entailed a series of radical ideological inversions, in which the Whore of Babylon became the Mother Church and the Antichrist became the venerated Pope.”15 Conversions sometimes occurred among groups of religious friends for whom theological exactitude was important, especially groups of Episcopalians. They were impressed not only by the venerable qualities of Catholicism, but also by news from England about the Oxford Movement then sweeping through the Anglican Church and the conversion to Catholicism of such Anglican leaders as John Henry Newman (1801–90). Most Protestants, however, kept their distance. Conversion to Catholicism was exceptional, and anti-Catholicism was still far more common than admiration. During the Civil War a series of street riots even more violent than those of the foregoing decades broke out, led by Irish immigrant protestors against the military draft. Some Irish immigrants fought for the Union but others, avoiding military ser vice, attacked free blacks, whose competition for jobs they feared. They also attacked prominent Republicans, who symbolized class bias in the draft (according to which wealthy young men could buy an exemption). The riots caused more than one hundred deaths and intensified anti-Catholic revulsion throughout the urban North.\n\nThe Era of Mass Immigration Europeans’ migration to America increased from year to year through the late nineteenth century, and more than a million immigrants were arriving each year by the early years of the twentieth. Most of them were Catholics and Jews from Southern and Eastern\n\n30\n\nPatrick Allitt\n\nEu rope, and they provided a dramatic contrast to older immigrants and old-stock Americans. Among the Catholics, settlers from Germany and Ireland continued to arrive in large numbers. In addition almost four million Italians came between 1899 and 1924 (though around half of them later reemigrated), along with two million Poles, nearly one million French Canadians, half a million Slovaks, and hundreds of thousands more Ruthenians, Lithuanians, Slovenians, and Hungarians. Numerous American writers and politicians declared that Slavs, Russians, Italians, Poles, Greeks, and Bohemians could never be assimilated and claimed that they threatened the integrity of the nation. Tom Watson of Georgia, sometime governor, senator, and presidential candidate, wrote in 1912, “The scum of creation has been dumped on us. . . . The most dangerous and corrupting hordes of the Old World have invaded us. The vice and crime which they have planted in our midst is terrifying.”16 Were they scum? Even Emma Lazarus, the Statue of Liberty’s poetess, herself a Jewish immigrant, referred to the immigrants as the “wretched refuse” of Europe’s “teeming shores.” Part of the criticism directed against the New Immigrants was similar to what had been used earlier against the Irish; it took the form of ethnic or cultural slurs, alleging that Southern and Eastern Europeans were naturally “slavish” and lacked Northern Europeans’ capacity for freedom and democracy. Madison Grant, a writer who favored banning immigration from Southern Eu rope, belonged to a generation of eugenicists, pseudo-scientists who believed that inferior peoples would contaminate America’s exceptional population and cause a decline in the quality of its racial stock. Immigration commissioner Francis Amasa Walker, meanwhile, had noticed that native-born populations had much lower birth rates than immigrant Catholics, which he saw as further evidence that the good old American type would soon be swamped. By one of the great ironies of history, most of the states passed their first anti-abortion laws in the 1870–1900 period as anti-Catholic measures, in the hope that the Protestant birth rate might rise to keep pace. A century later, Catholics would become the most passionate supporters of these laws because of their church’s teaching that life begins at the moment of conception. Protestant observers disagreed about how to react to the new immigration. Some sought ways to prevent any more Catholics from emigrating, picking up elements of the KnowNothing tradition. An Iowa lawyer, Henry Bowers, founded the American Protective Association in 1887 as an anti-immigrant and explicitly anti-Catholic society. It grew rapidly in the following years, recruited half a million members, blamed Catholics for “stealing” jobs that should have gone to “real Americans,” and held the church responsible for deliberately causing the business crash of 1893. Its journal, the Patriotic American, printed forged papal documents, one of which alleged that the papacy planned a massacre of all American Protestants. Contributors even found a way to blend anti-Semitism with their antiCatholicism, arguing that Jewish immigrants were working on behalf of the pope. One APA member wrote, “The Jews have been brought in to wage war with Rome against America and America"
