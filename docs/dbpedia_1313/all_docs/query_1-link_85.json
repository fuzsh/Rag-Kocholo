        "text": "Season 1 2 3 4 5 6 | Main\n\nBetter Call Saul (2015–2022) is an American AMC drama about the life of a small-time lawyer Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) seven years before his appearance on Breaking Bad, though events during and after the original series are also explored.\n\nSeasons\n\n[edit]\n\nSeason 1\n\nSeason 2\n\nSeason 3\n\nSeason 4\n\nSeason 5\n\nSeason 6\n\nAbout Better Call Saul\n\n[edit]\n\nI know people think, “How dare they not call her the lead of Better Call Saul?” or think it’s sexist or it’s politics. It’s nothing of the sort. I chose—and so did all the male supporting actors—from the very beginning to identify as supporting of the Jimmy McGill/Saul Goodman/Gene Takovic story. I understand that in the end, I ended up being the woman who had the most screen time of any other woman on the show, and I often had A stories when supporting actors usually have B stories. I could sit there and do the math on the number of hours and say I should be in the lead, or I could say I’m the female lead, but I chose to identify in support of what is ultimately a Saul Goodman origin story. For me, it doesn’t belittle or diminish the work I was doing in any way. I didn’t want to shift it when I started getting more screen time. I’m not ancillary to his story, but I never was, even when I had much less screen time. As we just said, Kim has her own agency. They wrote a character who isn’t just reactionary to Jimmy’s life. People are mistaken if they think that’s what supporting actors mean.\n\nRhea Seehorn in “Rhea Seehorn on becoming the beating heart of Better Call Saul” by Saloni Gajjar, AV Club, (August 18, 2022)\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nBob Odenkirk - Saul Goodman/Jimmy McGill\n\nJonathan Banks - Mike Ehrmantraut\n\nRhea Seehorn - Kim Wexler\n\nPatrick Fabian - Howard Hamlin\n\nMichael Mando - Nacho Varga\n\nMichael McKean - Charles \"Chuck\" McGill\n\nTony Dalton - Lalo Salamanca\n\nWikipedia has an article about:"
