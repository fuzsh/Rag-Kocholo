        "text": "History of National Saul Day\n\nThe forename Saul (in Hebrew ‘Shaul,’ meaning “asked-for”) was the name of an Israelite king whose story is told in the first book of Samuel. Saul’s rule was tumultuous, despite his achievement in unifying Israel and his military capabilities. His downfall was a result of his prolonged feud with the youthful David, who finally succeeded him.\n\nPerhaps because of this, the forename wasn’t quite as popular in ancient times as it is today. Its popularity as a Christian name was further hampered by the fact that it was St. Paul’s former name, which he bore while persecuting Christians and then renounced following his conversion to Christianity.\n\nBetween 1840 and 1920, the Saul surname was used in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Scotland. In 1880, the United States had the highest number of Saul families. There were also about 378 Saul families in Lancashire in 1891. This accounted for almost 26% of all documented Sauls in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe life expectancy for Sauls in the United States fluctuated between 1946 and 2004, with the lowest point recorded in 1953 and the highest in 1999. The average life expectancy was 69 in 1946 but rose to 76 in 2004.\n\nBy today’s naming standards, the name Saul is so vintage and rare that it’s become stylish. Saul can be the right choice for you if you want an uncommon name with some edge to it. It’s also important to note that some Sauls who have been born since the infamous Hebrew King have done an admirable job redeeming their predecessor’s wrongs."
