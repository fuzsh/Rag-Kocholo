Amy KERNS - Author

Being a mama of boys – two human and one fur – has inspired my literary journey and pushed me to become an author. My debut children’s book ‘Harlow Learn He’s Loved’, published in February 2022, was based on the real-life interaction between my first born and 8-year-old German Shepherd. And now with another baby boy at home, the Harlow the Hedgehog series continues with other adorable dynamics to share.

Being a mom of two also means I am constantly surrounded by an explosion of socks, which inspired my second children’s book very fittingly named ‘Mismatched Socks’. The moral is that it is ok to have on socks that don’t match as long as your feet are warm!

I write these adorable stories where I live in New Jersey with my husband, two boys and dog. In my free time, I love to watch cooking shows and swim in my pool. I graduated from UMass Amherst with a major in Marketing & a minor in Psychology.
