Let’s go!\n\nWHY IT’S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT MAKES A GOOD CHILDREN’S BOOK\n\n10 CHARACTERISTICS OF A GOOD CHILDREN’S BOOK\n\nWHERE PARENTS GO TO FIND GOOD CHILDREN’S BOOKS\n\nWhy It’s Important to Know What Makes a Good Children’s Book\n\nYou might be asking yourself – why are quality children’s books important?\n\nWhen you provide your child with quality reading materials, you aid their cognitive development, encourage independent thought, and help them learn about the world in a fun and interesting way. Good books also help young readers gain confidence. As a result of this confidence, children often discover joy and excitement in reading. Thus, a self-motivated reader emerges.\n\nYou can promote all of these developmental benefits (and more) simply by knowing what makes a good children’s book. So, let’s take a look at the most important characteristics that you should look for.\n\n10 Characteristics of a Good Children’s Book\n\nWhen searching for a good book for your child, keep these 10 important characteristics in mind.\n\n1. The Book Reflects Your Child’s Interests\n\nThe interests of a child are key to what makes a good children’s book. By choosing a book that your child will find interesting, you can help promote a love of reading. A captivating book will also increase your child’s engagement, helping to develop their reading skills further.\n\nWhat makes a book appealing to children? Children often enjoy books that reflect the world around them. This includes books that tell a story they can connect to. When children can relate to a story, they are more likely to remember it and comprehend what they are reading.\n\nWant to find books your child will love? Check out Booka! The Booka App allows you and your child to select books based on interests. For example, explore books about nature, animals, shapes and colors, professions, places, science, sports and outdoors, and more!\n\n2. A Good Children’s Book Has Meaningful Illustrations\n\nIllustrations are an important aspect of what makes a good children’s book – especially for young readers. Illustrations help to draw a child in and capture their attention. In addition to helping engage young readers, illustrations can also support the development of reading comprehension.\n\nLook for books that include illustrations that are detailed, colorful, and connect to the story. You might ask yourself, do the illustrations tell the story? If the answer is yes, the book will help your young reader improve their reading comprehension and vocabulary.\n\nSome great examples of children’s books with beautiful and meaningful illustrations include:\n\nLula’s Brew by Elizabeth Dulemba\n\nSlumber My Darling by Stephen Foster\n\nThe Fable of the Bully Dragon by Jeff Dinardo\n\nHow To Hug A Cactus by Emily S Smith\n\n3. Interesting and Varied Language is Used Throughout\n\nA good children’s book uses rich and interesting vocabulary. Providing your child with books that offer varied language is essential because these books help to capture their attention. Exposure to new, increasingly sophisticated words and grammatical structures is also beneficial, as it provides an opportunity for valuable learning.\n\nWhat makes a good children’s book in terms of language and vocabulary? Most importantly, the language in a book should support the flow of the story. In other words, the language should make the storyline easy to follow. It is also important that the language is relatable for your child, but with an element of challenge.\n\nLooking for books for your child that use interesting and varied language? Check out these books written by Ellliot Kreloff:\n\nWorth the Wait\n\nPlease Don’t Make Me Fly\n\n4. The Story Includes Relatable Characters\n\nGood children’s books have relatable characters. When a child reads a book with relatable characters, they become more invested and engaged. This leads to greater enjoyment and promotes a love of reading. In addition, relatable characters promote feelings of empowerment and encourage children to create change in the world around them.\n\nWhen assessing a book for your child, look for characters who encounter real world problems and emotions. For example, loss, failure, success, sadness, fear, joy, and anger.\n\nHere are some examples of great children’s books that include relatable characters:\n\nStella…Almost by Wiley Blevins\n\nThe On-Again, Off-Again Friend by Wiley Blevins\n\nThe Sad Sad Monster by Dolores Costello\n\n5. A Good Children’s Book is Developmentally Appropriate\n\nDevelopmentally appropriate books are important because they allow your child to succeed when reading. These feelings of success will further motivate them to read, creating a positive learning cycle. Therefore, like knowing what makes a good children’s book, it is important to understand what makes a book a “good fit” for your child.\n\nSo, what makes a book developmentally appropriate? To find a suitable book, there are several elements to consider.\n\nFirst, evaluate the story’s content. That is, what is the story about, and what message is the author portraying? As mentioned earlier, children are drawn to books that they can relate to and that provide a window into the world around them.\n\nSecond, consider the difficulty of the language and vocabulary used in the book. It is important that your child can read most of the words in the story so that they can experience feelings of accomplishment. That said, some challenging language is also important to support your child’s continued development as a reader.\n\nFinally, you want to ensure that your child is comprehending what they are reading. Evaluate comprehension by checking in with your child and asking them questions about the story as they (or you) are reading it.\n\nDiscover thousands of developmentally appropriate children’s books on the Booka app, including:\n\nMiddle Me by Jeff Dinardo\n\nThe Not-So-Right Day by Wiley Blevins\n\n6. Important and Teachable Lessons Are Presented\n\nBooks provide an opportunity for children to learn and expand their understanding of the world around them. Through books, parents can expose children to life lessons that help them engage with other people, develop ideas, and build new skills. Best of all, presenting these lessons through fun and engaging stories has a much more significant impact than discussing them directly.\n\nWhat makes a good children’s book lesson? Here are some common and essential lessons to look for.\n\nSocial Emotional Learning such as kindness, teamwork, problem-solving, acceptance, inclusion, and friendship.\n\nExploring one’s identity, including interests, talents, passions, and family.\n\nExploring academic topics such as mathematics, literacy, art, music, history, and other subjects.\n\nLooking for stories that include important and teachable lessons? Check out these top children’s books:\n\nMy Shadow Is Pink by Scott Stuart\n\nIce Queen by Jamie Tablason\n\nSheep in the Closet by Mattia Cerato\n\n7. The Plot is Captivating\n\nLike any great book, a good children’s book should have a captivating plot that grabs the reader’s attention. An engaging plot will increase a young reader’s interest in the story. As a result, they will be more likely to learn a lesson from the book and develop their skills as a reader.\n\nNot sure how to identify a captivating plot? Look for books that will make your child laugh or have them on the edge of their seat. For example, stories with comical situations, unexpected problems that must be solved, and/or surprising reactions from characters.\n\n\"Ick and Crud\" is one of the very best children’s book series that includes captivating and engaging plots. Check out the Ick and Crud series on Booka.\n\n8. The Story Has a Beginning, Middle, and End\n\nBooks that are structured with a clear beginning, middle, and end allow children to follow and engage with a story more easily. This type of structure also helps children develop the ability to retell stories and build on their reading comprehension skills.\n\nTypically, a good children’s book begins with an introduction to the characters and setting. Then, in the middle, a problem develops that the characters must solve. Finally, the end shares how the characters overcame the problem they were facing.\n\nBy exposing children to this easy-to-follow structure, parents can also provide an example of how they can be authors too!\n\nCheck out the Problem Solved! series on the Booka app for great stories with clear, easy-to-follow structures.\n\n9. The Setting is Intriguing\n\nA story’s setting, or where it takes place, is an important part of what makes a good children’s book. Using descriptive language, an author can bring young readers into the world of the characters. A story that provides a detailed description of the setting, through both pictures and words, helps a child visualize the story as it takes place. This is an important skill and will help your child develop an understanding of what they are reading.\n\nWhen selecting a book for or with your child, look for a familiar setting. Alternatively, look for books that use descriptive language to provide a window into the setting with the help of a little imagination!\n\nLooking for books with a captivating setting?
