The protagonists’ natural chemistry as they learn to collaborate and trust one another helps to ground the epic story, especially once it leans more heavily into fantasy elements, while Callan’s narrative voice adds just the right amount of self-aware humor.”\n\n—Publishers Weekly (starred review)\n\n“Kevin Sands brings mystery, magic and a pretty major con-job to his first fantasy novel, a story where things are never quite as they seem. It’s not easy to create an entirely new mythology, but Sands does a fine job with this first installment in his new series. Be prepared for an exciting read.”\n\n—NPR\n\n“This high-energy thriller is perfect for younger fans of Six of Crows, the movie Ocean’s Eleven, and other inside-job narratives. Readers will be sure to delight in narrator Callan’s sharp wit and snappy voice as they are introduced to the rest of the crew and their unusual skills. Cryptic messages, creepy characters, and unexpected but endearing friendships abound.”\n\n—Booklist\n\n“Sands has created a rip-roaring story full of frantic twists and turns that leave readers questioning what is real and what is not. The magic is believable, and the world is easy to imagine. And one cannot help but root for these young protagonists whose lives have been so difficult and yet who manage to hope for a better future. A fabulous choice.” —School Library Journal\n\n“In a world of Spellweavers and airships, a team comes together for a legendary heist…Callan is an excellent narrator, constantly observing body language for tells that reveal secrets as the kids plan an elaborate, multistage operation to break into a seemingly unbreakable location, all with a life-changing financial prize on the line.”\n\n—Kirkus Reviews"
