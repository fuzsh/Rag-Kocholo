        "text": "I stepped forward, my mind screaming at me to run, run, run. I began to move down the hall. I saw now that it didn’t go on forever; there was a door at the end, far in the distance, though it wasn’t the door to the lift. I went faster running toward …\n\n“Cal! Stop!”\n\nMeriel’s cry shattered the vision. I felt the tile shift under my boot, heard a click. Then a chain rattled, and there was a terrible slam of iron behind me.\n\nI blinked. The angled corridors had vanished. The door to the lift was back in place.\n\nBut I’d moved. Now I stood between Artha and the deer. And when I looked down, I saw I’d stepped on one the tiles Padraig had warned me about.\n\nThe trap.\n\nI’d triggered the trap.\n\nFive kids with unusual talents are brought together to commit an impossible crime. Failure is unacceptable … but success could be deadly. Best-selling author Kevin Sands’ Children of the Fox, a “Thieves of Shadow” novel, is a delightfully fun heist story filled to the brim with magic, mystery, and thrills. Offering a mash-up of magical fantasy, action-adventure, and a little drop of steampunk, this promising start to a new middle-grade series is certain to be a hit with young readers.\n\nEnticed by the mysterious Mr. Solomon with a promise of mounds of money, a group of notorious young criminals are hired to steal a guarded treasure from the most powerful sorcerer in the city. Each kid possesses a talent required to collectively pull off the biggest con of their lives. There's Callan the con artist, Meriel the acrobat/weapons expert, Gareth the researcher, Lachlan who can obtain anything, and Foxtail, whose eyeless mask never seems to limit her ability to climb walls like a spider. Despite living with a collective “don’t trust anyone” mantra, the chosen five must quickly learn to rely on each other in order to face unimaginable odds and magic to get the job done.\n\nAlthough all aspects of this creatively plotted novel are well done with a great Victorian-esque setting, the true gems amongst the pages are author Kevin Sands’ characters. Each one is unique and charming in their own way with redeeming aspects of their personality offered in balance with hardened edges and mysterious backstories. Without question, the most is revealed about Cal who acts as the honorary leader of thieves and the novel’s main protagonist. As a result, readers will connect most with Cal and may be left wishing they knew more about Meriel, Gareth, Lachlan and Foxtail. It will be interesting to see if this Cal focus continues in future novels or if the author switches perspectives and allows each character to be the lead in their own part of the story.\n\nComplete with its own mythology, magic and creative world-building, Children of the Fox delivers a fantastical heist story from start to finish. Inclusive of all the action-adventure plot elements a middle-grade reader could hope for (daring escapes, an unexpected twist, and a resolution to the initial plot) this initial “Thieves of Shadow” novel does not disappoint and includes a cliffhanger that assures young readers will be salivating for more."
