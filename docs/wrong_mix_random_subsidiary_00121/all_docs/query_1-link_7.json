        "text": "(born 1946). Australian writer Mem Fox wrote more than 40 children’s books during her long career. She also wrote nonfiction books for adults.\n\nFox was born Merrion Frances Partridge on March 5, 1946, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Her parents were missionaries, and they moved to Africa when she was six months old. Partridge lived at a mission near Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), and attended the mission school. At the time, however, Southern Rhodesia was a British colony. Government authorities told her parents that it was illegal for Partridge, who was white, to go to a Black school. Her parents thus enrolled her in an all-white school. During high school Partridge enjoyed public speaking and acting. About that time she began using the name Mem. In 1965 she attended drama school in London, England.\n\nIn 1969 Partridge married Malcolm Fox, and they moved to Rwanda, where she taught English. By the next year the couple had moved to Adelaide, South Australia. In the late 1970s Fox studied children’s literature at Flinders University in South Australia. While there she wrote a rough draft of Possum Magic, which became her first published children’s book in 1983. The book tells the story of a grandmother and grandchild opossum that travel throughout the Australian bush. With more than three million books in print, Possum Magic became the best-selling picture book in Australia.\n\nFox often incorporated Australian culture and history and incidents from her own life in her books. Some of the other children’s books that she wrote early in her career include Hattie and the Fox (1986), Koala Lou (1988), Time for Bed (1993), and Boo to a Goose (1996). Books that she wrote in the early 21st century include Where Is the Green Sheep? (2004), Where the Giant Sleeps (2007), A Giraffe in the Bath (2010), Nellie Belle (2015), and Bonnie and Ben Rhyme Again (2018).\n\nIn addition to her writing career, Fox began teaching literacy studies at Flinders University in the early 1970s. She stayed there until her retirement in 1996. Her books for adults on literacy and education include Radical Reflections: Passionate Opinions on Teaching, Learning, and Living (1993), English Essentials: The Wouldn’t-Be-Without-It Guide to Writing Well (1993), and Reading Magic (2001). Mem’s the Word (1990) is an autobiography. It was published in the United States as Dear Mem Fox, I Have Read All Your Books Even the Pathetic Ones (1992).\n\nThroughout her career Fox won many awards. She received the Dromkeen Medal in 1990 for literary achievement. In 2003 the Australian government honored her with the Centenary Medal for her contributions to society. That same year she was named Australian of the Year for South Australia and in 2004 was a finalist for Australian of the Year."
