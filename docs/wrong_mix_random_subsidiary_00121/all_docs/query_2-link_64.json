        "text": "New Jersey said goodbye to its homegrown department store chain, Bamberger’s, 30 years ago, but its impact on how North Jersey shops, and how retailers sell, are very much present today.\n\nBamberger’s shaped the suburbs of North Jersey and the rest of the state by proving, starting in the 1950s, that the giant department stores found in cities could play in places such as Paramus. It also taught the company that now operates America’ leading national department store chain, Macy’s, important lessons about how to sell in the suburbs.\n\n“Bamberger’s was able to learn how to merchandise in the suburbs in a big way, and they first learned how to do that in Paramus,” said Michael Lisicky, author of “Bamberger’s: New Jersey’s Greatest Store” by History Press. “Bamberger’s became the incubator for stores all over the country,” he said.\n\nStar performer\n\nDuring an era when Macy’s owned many independent department store divisions around the country, all of them the leading chains in their cities, Bamberger’s was the star of the Macy’s family, retail analyst Howard Davidowitz said.\n\n“Bamberger’s stores were known as great merchants and they outperformed all of the others,” said Davidowitz, chairman of Davidowitz & Associates, a national retail consulting and investment banking firm based in New York.Macy's frequently cited Bamberger's as its most profitable division, Davidowitz recalled.\n\nThe Bamberger's unit was considered more upscale at one point than Macy's, which was seen as more of a discounter. Certain luxury brands, such as Estee Lauder and Rolex, would sell with Bamberger's, but not Macy's.\n\nBamberger’s became part of the R.H. Macy’s company in 1929, but it remained an independent operation, keeping its own merchandising and executive leadership, and the Bamberger’s name, until the fall of 1986, when the Bamberger’s stores in Paramus, Morristown, Newark, and everywhere else were renamed Macy’s.\n\nSuburban growth, downtown decline\n\nLisicky, who has written nine books about landmark department stores, said he chose the Bamberger’s story for his most recent book, published this month, because he was fascinated by how its history parallels the conflict between suburban growth and downtown decline that played out across New Jersey over the last 50 years.\n\nThat conflict pitted Bamberger’s future – a sprawling store constructed on a former celery field in Paramus – against its past – the massive Bamberger’s store in downtown Newark.\n\nThe Bamberger’s retail chain was born in Newark in 1893, after founder Louis Bamberger took over a bankrupt store in the city. He renamed the store L. Bamberger & Co. and, Lisicky notes, set himself apart from other stores in the city by adopting modern practices such as fixed pricing, guaranteed returns and wide assortments of merchandise. In 1912 the company moved into a 500,000-square-foot, eight-story store at the corner of Market and Halsey streets in Newark.\n\nLisicky cites a Bamberger’s announcement for the new store that called it “a store for both masses and classes” and “a monument to all the people – rich and poor.”\n\nThe store, in its earliest years, was something of an Amazon of its day, pioneering innovative and sometimes offbeat home-delivery options. It began with a home-delivery service via horse-drawn carriage and sleds, and in 1919, according to Lisicky, purchased a small plane for deliveries to the Jersey Shore. Also that year, it delivered a bag of silverware by parachute, and allowed a plane to land on the roof of the Newark store to drop off a New York City resident for a day of shopping,\n\nAs automobiles became more common in the 1920s, the Newark store was among the first retailers to offer valet parking.\n\nMedia savvy marketing\n\nBamberger’s also launched media companies as a way to boost sales. An in-store radio station, WOR, went on the air in 1922 to promote sales of radio receiver sets at the store, and continues today as the WOR radio and TV stations. In 1924 it began publishing its own fashion magazine, Charm, “to reach the well-off northern New Jersey market,” the company said the time.\n\nR.H. Macy and Co. bought the store in 1929, just before the stock market crashed, for an undisclosed amount, believed to be between $25 million and $50 million, Lisicky said. The store, and the suburban divisions that opened in later decades, remained an independent operation under the Macy’s umbrella.\n\nBamberger’s began testing small locations outside of Newark in the 1930s, including a women’s store on the Asbury Park boardwalk, and opened its first suburban location in Morristown in 1949. However, the suburban move that shaped Bamberger’s future was the decision by Macy's in 1951 to buy a 30-acre parcel in Paramus, at the intersection of routes 4 and 17.\n\nMacy's announced plans to build a shopping center on the site, with the main attraction to be a large Macy’s department store. Macy's saw the center, Garden State Plaza, as likely to attract more New York shoppers, with its proximity to the George Washington Bridge, than New Jersey shoppers, and decided one of its New York nameplate stores belonged there. As Lisicky outlines in his book, Bamberger’s executives insisted that Paramus was their territory, and won.\n\n\"How to do it bigger\"\n\n“Their goal was to outshine New York. They wanted to prove to New York that they knew what to do, they knew how to do it better,” Lisicky said. And in Paramus, he said, they were able to show Macy’s “how to do it bigger. Nobody did it in such a large scale almost nationally than what Bamberger’s did in Paramus,” he said.\n\nThe Bamberger’s store that opened in Paramus in 1957 was the foundation around which grew what is now New Jersey’s largest mall, Westfield Garden State Plaza. The success of the store established Paramus and North Jersey as a retail powerhouse, and a place where every retail executive wanted to have a store.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, as the entire industry was experiencing mergers and consolidations, Macy’s had brought many of its formerly independent department store chains in other parts of the country into the corporate structure and renamed them as Macy’s stores. In 1986, Macy’s made the decision to remove the Bamberger’s name from the stores, replace it with Macy’s and make other changes.\n\nSteven Packles of Teaneck was accounting manager of Macy’s New York at the time and worked on the merger of Bamberger’s finance operations with Macy’s. Previously, Bamberger’s and the other divisions operated relatively independently, he said, with separate executive teams, buyers, marketing and merchandising offices. Merging Bamberger’s in Macy’s, he said, was all about “economies of scale.”\n\n“You got overhead savings in terms of payroll and you also got savings in terms of common advertising,” Packles said. “Now you could advertise Macy’s across the metro New York area.”\n\nPackles later worked at the former Bamberger’s headquarters in Newark. He led the loss prevention, inventory control and credit card fraud divisions of Macy’s that were based there, and saw reminders of the glory days of Bamberger’s, including the ornate, wood-paneled office of Louis Bamberger, as well as an impressive corporate dining room.\n\nThe Newark store, then called Macy’s, closed in 1992.\n\nBamberger’s showed department stores how to grow as suburban America was growing. Now, Davidowitz said, the future of department stores may lie in cities, but he doesn’t foresee a return to the massive retail palaces like Newark Bamberger’s.\n\n“The future department stores are going to be physically smaller, they’re going to be more urban than suburban, and they’re going to be high-tech and specialized,” he said."
