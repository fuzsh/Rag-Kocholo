        "text": "Newark’s 11th annual 24 Hours of Peace celebration starting Friday night will be cohosted by Queen Latifah and Faith Evans will be headlining the performance sector of the event.\n\nThe 24 Hours of Peace celebration takes place from 6 p.m. Friday (Sept. 2) to 6 p.m. Saturday (Sept. 3), on Springfield Avenue between Bergen and Blum streets. Queen Latifah will be cohosting the event alongside Mayor Ras Baraka. In addition to Evans, Friday’s performers include Fabolous and CL Smooth, the co-founder of 24 Hours of Peace, Hakim Green, and local talent. Saturday’s lineup includes Rowdy Rebel, Fivio Foreign, G Herbo, and 2Rare.\n\nThe event, launched by Baraka, began 10 years ago in Newark’s South Ward when he was a city councilman. He later expanded the event two years ago to be hosted city-wide when he was elected mayor.\n\n“The 24 Hours of Peace event is more than an occasion to enjoy entertainment, food, poetry, and movies,” Baraka stated in an announcement of this year’s event. “It is a time for our residents to unify, to get access to important resources and information, to share ideas and solutions at a town hall meeting, and join together to end violence and move a peaceful Newark forward.”\n\nBoth Queen Latifah and Faith Evans have ties to Newark. Queen Latifah was born in Newark and throughout her career has given back. Most recently, the rapper and actress participated in the development of building affordable housing for Newark residents. Due to Queen Latifah’s philanthropy, 60 two- and three-bedroom market-rate apartments in four townhouse clusters, plus 16 affordable units in a separate building in a neighborhood near the borders of the Central and South wards will be built. During the groundbreaking ceremony, the entertainer said at the time, “I’m proud to be from here.”\n\nFaith Evans began singing gospel music at Emmanuel Missionary Baptist Church on Chancellor Avenue when she was a young girl. She later graduated from Newark’s University High School where she also performed jazz and other genres. Back in 2016 for Newark’s Founder’s Day, she said to the crowd, “There’s no love like hometown love. Brick City, I love you.”\n\nTake a look at last year’s event below:\n\n9 Travel Essentials Everyone Needs\n\nPlease note that items are in stock and prices are accurate at the time we published this list.
