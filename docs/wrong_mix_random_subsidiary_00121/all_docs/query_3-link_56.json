        "text": "How do you write children's books and get them published? You write a children’s book by choosing a target audience, incorporating captivating elements, and beautifully illustrating it. Children’s books may either be self-published or submitted to traditional publishers.\n\nAnd this article can give you the other tools you need to write the next great children’s book that you may have been thinking about for years, but never thought you'd be able to write and share it with little ones.\n\nWhat’s your reason for writing children’s books? For me, it’s that smile.\n\nMany authors or aspiring writers dream of publishing a children’s book. Maybe you have an incredible idea that you can’t stop thinking about. Or perhaps you want to put to paper your little one’s favorite bedtime short story — the one you made up while snuggling together.\n\nWhatever the reason, now is the time to check this dream off your bucket list.\n\nAnd I'm here to help you do that.\n\nI'm a multi-award winning & bestselling children’s book author and ghostwriter of more than 50 children’s books. And I founded a little thing called Children’s Book University®, which helps other authors create books like I have.\n\nWhat follows is as much information as I could condense into a single article on how to write a children's book. Enjoy!\n\nWriting and publishing your own children’s book is no longer super challenging to achieve, nor does it take all your life savings (like it might have 20 years ago).\n\nUnless you’re a celebrity or have a large following already, self-publishing your children’s book is a great way to get your foot in the door, even if your ultimate goal is to eventually explore traditional publishing.\n\nIf you present a well-performing book and an established author platform, your chances of landing a publishing deal are much higher than if you simply submit a query or manuscript.\n\nHow much money can be made from writing a children's book? The answer to this question greatly depends on the subject of the children's book. That's why doing our research is so important, even before we start writing our children's book.\n\nEven for children’s books, we need to validate our book idea.\n\nAdditionally, book series are generally doing very well with kids. Once little ones come to love a character, they often can't get enough of them and their parents continue buying the books. The Magic Tree House series by Mary Pope Osborne and The Little Blue Truck by Alice Schertle are wonderful examples.\n\nThe roadmap below outlines what steps we’ll take to write and publish a children’s book:\n\nQuestions to Consider Before Writing a Children’s Book\n\nWill parents want to buy this book?\n\nFor books marketed to younger audiences, you need to know that parents will want to buy this book. Children usually don’t spend the money to buy your story. Yes, make something entertaining for kids — but you need parents to buy your book first.\n\nThe primary purchaser of children’s books is between 30 and 44 years old. Females make up more than 70% of these buyers.\n\nA few ways you could really get to better know your audience are:\n\nSpend time with age groups you’re targeting and their parents/guardians (whether in real life or on social media)\n\nTalk to parents and teachers\n\nGive a survey to women within the target age range from your own social circles\n\nMarket research is also a huge tool to see what books parents are looking to buy their children. You'd be surprised at how much interest some themes get when compared to others. Take a look at this example here, showing the search volume for common children's book themes on Amazon:\n\nData provided by Publisher Rocket\n\nRight away, you should see that some topics get way more interest than others- and depending on your personal goals, you might want to avoid writing a book about a topic with low searches.\n\nSide Note: We recently reviewed another great course on publishing children's books, read our review here.\n\nDo you know the [basic] structure of a children’s book?\n\nWhen writing a children’s storybook, it’s really important to know the basic structure of a children’s book. There are lots of templates for writing a children’s book!\n\nTo learn more about children’s books and how to structure your writing for a younger audience, you could:\n\nStudy books that fall into your targeted age group. What is the general layout? What vocabulary is used?\n\nVisit a bookstore or library and browse through the kids’ section to get a feel for this genre.\n\nSearch for age group trends and consumer trends in general via sites like Slideshare\n\nTalk to experts in child psychology and learning to understand the unique needs of children at each age level.\n\nIs there a template for writing a children’s book? Yes, there are many templates for writing a children’s book. Here are some of my favorites:\n\nMy own How to Write a Children’s Book Template (it’s free with lots of added resources)\n\nTemplate.net’s Illustrated Children’s Book Template (not all are free, but very professionally done with lots of different choices)\n\nWrite Kids’ Books Free Microsoft Word children’s book template (for chapter books for slightly older kids )\n\nClaire O’Brien’s Free Picture Book Scrivener Template (for everyone’s favorite book-writing software, Scrivener)\n\nUsed to Tech’s Free Editable Book Templates in Word (for Microsoft Word)\n\nCan you explain your book concept before writing?\n\nYou should be able to explain your book concept to anyone in a single sentence and in fewer than 30 seconds.\n\nTo best explain your book concept to potential readers or traditional publishers, you should develop a logline that encapsulates the plot and the hook.\n\nIf you’re not concisely explaining your book’s concept, you might lose potential readers and publishers because it’s too confusing.\n\nWriting a Children’s Book: Things to Avoid\n\nThese 7 writing tips may help you avoid common issues when writing a children’s book:\n\nDon’t confuse age categories. I will talk more about the different age ranges shortly, but in essence, board Books for 0- to 2-year-olds should not have long words or long sentences. Middle Grade books should not feature profanities, and Young Adult fiction should not contain many illustrations (if at all).\n\nAvoid too many words in younger children’s literature. Picture books should never contain more than 800 words, including the front matter and back matter.\n\nDon’t make the moral of your story too obvious. Kids can smell a lesson being taught, and they don’t like it. Instead, subtly weave lessons into the story and characters.\n\nAvoid a bland title. Your title should interest potential buyers, clearly show what your story is about, and be easily searchable on Google and Amazon. Also, always use a subtitle to up your marketing game. Subtitles mean more keywords associated with your book.\n\nDon’t write bland characters. Your main character should take an active role in the plot, making bold decisions that move the story forward. Also, colorful personalities play well with younger kids.\n\nAvoid a slow start. Start your children’s book off with something exciting and suspenseful. Kids can lose interest if your story is slow, so be sure to hook your little reader from the very beginning.\n\nDon’t skimp on an illustrator. This is where many aspiring children’s authors struggle a bit. You don’t have to spend a fortune, but because illustrations play such a big part in children’s books, it’s important to use high-quality work. l While Young Adult books won’t need illustrations any longer, they are a must for books up until Middle Grade books. Especially those for younger kids will need vibrant illustrations on nearly every page. Picture Books should emphasize images just as much as the text.\n\nBest Book Marketing Software\n\nOver 47,000+ authors, NYT bestsellers, and publishing companies use Publisher Rocket to gain key insight to the market.

Below is every resource you’re going to need.\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide on how to write a children’s book:\n\nChoose the format\n\nKnow your target category\n\nChoose a title\n\nFind a writing style\n\nIncorporate important elements\n\nUse solid characters\n\nMake the story engaging\n\nProofread and edit\n\nIllustrate your book\n\nSTEP 1. Choose the Format\n\nShould you publish an ebook or paperback? You should consider publishing your children’s book in both ebook format and paperback format.\n\nPaperback is still the most popular format for children’s books. If you’re looking to sell your children’s book on Amazon or in brick-and-mortar stores, you should invest in a high-quality paperback format.\n\nEbooks are not a very popular medium for children’s books. However, children’s ebook usage is continuously increasing.\n\nMost parents still prefer their kids to read print books, but the number of parents who prefer ebooks or who have no preference is growing.\n\nEbooks also come in handy during promotions and review requests. Giving away an ebook for review is a lot easier and more cost-effective.\n\nWith a little research, you can determine how well books are selling in your desired format. Here's an example of five competing paperback books on Amazon showing for the keyword “Children's Books About Puppies”, which should give you an idea of how well that format is performing. You can even see how many pages these books are, so you can calculate your estimated costs!\n\nPrice, Earnings, and Pages Data provided by Publisher Rocket\n\nIt’s worth noting that a study out of the University of Michigan found that storytime with ebooks is not as effective. Compared with physical book storytime, parents spent more time talking about the technology, instead of the book’s content, during ebook storytime.\n\nSo physical children’s books won’t go away anytime soon.\n\nSTEP 2. Know Your Target Category\n\nTo write a children’s book, you need to know your target category — that is, the age of your target audience.\n\nWhen publishing on Amazon, you will be asked to list what ages your book is for. So it’s important to add the most appropriate age range. Otherwise you may receive lots of negative reviews from parents and other caregivers that thought your book to be unsuitable for their little ones.\n\nDepending on the kids’ age reading your book, you will want to adjust the number of illustrations, word count, writing style, and more.\n\nMost children’s books fall into one of these 5 categories:\n\nBoard books\n\nPicture books\n\nChapter books\n\nMiddle grade chapter books\n\nYoung Adult books\n\nBelow is a table to show average statistics for the most common types of children’s books:\n\nShort words and short sentences are critical for the youngest children, so readers don’t feel overwhelmed. Colorful illustrations and fun characters are more necessary in children’s books than in adult fiction. Where adults can mentally grapple with ambiguity, kids prefer resolved stories and answered questions.\n\nEach stage of development in a child’s life requires a different story structure and book setup. Adapting to each stage and its cognitive ability is essential if we want our book to be meaningful, educational, and fun.\n\nBoard Books\n\nBoard Books are considered the youngest category — including on Amazon’s marketplace. They are for kids aged 0 to 2.\n\nA Board Book is printed on thick paperboard. Often, it contains all pictures or fewer than 100 words.\n\nIn most of these categories, but especially these Board Books, marketing to parents is probably more important than appealing to kids. Of course, you want your book to be fun and intriguing to children. But make sure you give parents what they’re looking for: a good message and subtle, effective education.\n\nPicture Books\n\nPicture Books are the next category of children’s books. They are for 3- to 5-year-olds.\n\nChildren’s picture books contain up to 400 words, but there should still be vibrant illustrations on every page.\n\nChapter Books\n\nAlso called the “Early Readers” category, Chapter Books are just what they sound like — the first books that children will read with the story split up into chapters.\n\nThough some children will be excited to start reading chapter books, others will be reluctant. The broad age range for basic Chapter Books is 6 to 10.\n\nMiddle Grade\n\nMiddle Grade books are for children 8 to 12 — a step up from Chapter Books.\n\nThese books typically feature a protagonist aged 10 to 13, slightly older than the reader. They should contain no profane language, no violence, and no romance outside of a first kiss or an innocent crush.\n\nCommon themes include friendship, acceptance, good conquering evil, and the importance of family.\n\nA Middle Grade book is longer than a Chapter Book but shorter than a YA book. It usually contains between 30,000 and 45,000 words.\n\nYoung Adult\n\nYoung Adult books are targeted towards readers aged 13 to 18. Abbreviated as YA, Young Adult is meant to appeal to teenagers, although it’s important to note that more than half of YA books sold are read by adults older than 18.\n\nSome people also use “Young Adult” to mean a genre where the protagonist doesn’t fit in, the parents are absent, they live in a post-apocalyptic world, and a coming-of-age story takes center stage. These are tropes and don’t necessarily apply to every YA story, but you get the picture.\n\nYA books won’t always be considered children’s books. But some traditional publishers may classify “Young Adult” as a children’s book category.\n\nSTEP 3. Choose a Title\n\nYou need to choose a winning title for your children’s book. You could do this after it’s written, but having a title in mind may guide you in your writing. You can always improve and change the title after the story is written.\n\nA creative title lets your story’s personality shine through. But you also want readers to actually find your book. This could be difficult if you don’t name your children’s book correctly.\n\nFortunately, Dave at Kindlepreneur wrote excellent articles on How to Title a Book and Book Title Generators. They will definitely help you craft that perfect title.\n\nTo title a children’s book, you need:\n\nTo grab a reader’s attention (or a parent’s attention)\n\nTo clearly tell what the story is about\n\nAn easily searchable title, hard to confuse for something else\n\nKeywords that match what your audience is searching for\n\nThe book The Color Monster: A Story About Emotions is a great example:\n\nIt grabs your attention because kids usually don’t associate monsters with different moods.\n\nIt tells parents and kids that this story is about different monsters with different emotions.\n\nIt is one of the first results when you search “monster book for kids.”\n\nIt has the word “monster,” a very common search term for boy’s books.\n\nThe subtitle reads “A Story About Emotions,” and includes “emotions,” which is another common keyword parents look for in their children’s books.\n\nSpeaking of subtitles: It’s important to include a subtitle underneath your title. This helps the marketing of your book by including additional keywords that parents can search for.\n\nAs you can see, some kids book genres have decent money coming into them, with less competition. So, make sure you do your research beforehand and see what possible types of kids books you can create. One way you can quickly see the competition of a genre is checking out your book's Amazon categories, and seeing how many sales it takes per day to become a bestseller. That should give you a good idea of the competition in that genre.\n\nFor example, take a look at the competition difference here for several children's categories about specific animals. Many young children have a favorite, and making a high quality book in a lower competition category can help your book be discovered by readers.\n\nData provided by Publisher Rocket\n\nBy writing a quality book for a category with low competition, but significant interest, your children's book will stand out from the crowd. If you decide to target a high competition category, just know there are publishers and authors with high experience already in that space, and you will have to work harder to capture a customer's attention.\n\nSTEP 4. Find a Writing Style\n\nYou need to find a writing style that fits the age group you are writing for, the associated word count, the story you’re telling, and your own preferences.\n\nYou may be an excellent writer, an engaging blogger, maybe even an already accomplished author of adult fiction or nonfiction. But when it comes to writing style for children, you have to adopt a new mindset and an appropriate writing style.\n\nHere are some writing styles you should consider:\n\nRhyme: If you decide to write your book in rhyme, you need to make the rhyme very, very good. Make sure lines have the same syllable counts and rhythms. Don’t force bad rhymes or skip rhyming. Be consistent. (The Little Blue Truck and Llama Llama books are excellent examples.)\n\nPast or Present Tense: Kids prefer books in the present tense, actively engaging them in the story. They’re experiencing it as it happens, rather than being removed from something that happened in the past. (Maisy books are a great present-tense example.).\n\nFirst or Third Person: A third-person narrator’s voice may give you more freedom and flexibility. Children tend to prefer it to the first person. However, if it works with your theme to tell the story through a first-person narrator’s eyes, then make that choice.\n\nThere is no right or wrong approach; it’s merely a question of style. Once you have chosen your style, you will need to stick to it throughout the book.\n\nSTEP 5. Incorporate Important Elements\n\nWhen you write a children’s book, there are important elements that you need to incorporate, such as an appropriate theme, memorable characters, and relatable dialogue.\n\nYour inspired story idea is only as strong as how you tell it. There’s a beginning, a middle, and an end. There are actions, scenes, and emotions. Be sure to be clear about your core message.\n\nThe 5 most important elements in a good children’s book:\n\nUnforgettable characters: The best characters have strong personalities, make bold moves, and go after their dreams against all odds. Children fall in love with them and want to be like them. Children want to relate to the main character in some way. They also relate to kids that are just a bit older than them. Characters who remind kids of themselves are the most unforgettable.\n\nSuspenseful action/hook: Beginning a children’s book with a suspenseful action or hook is an effective way to draw in young readers. Consistent action throughout your story is vital, as it will hold the reader’s attention. Chapter books, for example, usually end each chapter with a cliffhanger to ensure the reader keeps turning the pages.\n\nRealistic dialogue: Children like to read stories that sound like they talk. Listen to conversations you hear around you; none of them will sound like the nicely flowing, full sentences you learned to write in school. Make sure you’re using age-appropriate language that kids will understand and relate to.\n\nGood storyline: A good storyline means there are always obstacles and challenges for your characters, ever-escalating the action. Note that little ones like happy endings and answered questions. If your storyline lacks a happy ending, you risk upsetting the reader or leaving them dissatisfied.\n\nThe instant recall factor: You want your book’s character to remain in the minds of your little readers long after they’ve read your book. If kids ask to read it over and over again, you can consider your story a success.\n\nWhile the sequence and rhythm of events are significant, keep in mind that not all stories have the same structure. There is no one formula because following a formula would rob stories of their true potential.\n\nYes, it’s crucial to have an intentional structure. But if it doesn’t fit perfectly, don’t force it.\n\nSTEP 6. Use Solid Characters\n\nYou have to use solid characters in your children’s book. Interesting, unforgettable characters are a must, especially when helping kids recall your story and core message.\n\nThe best characters in children’s books…\n\nare around the age of the child, if not a few years older\n\nhave colorful personalities\n\nmake bold choices that move the story along\n\nspeak as the readers speak (dialogue style)\n\nhave relatable wants and dreams\n\nIt's also important to research a character's surface level attributes before starting to write your book. Children will often ask their parents for a specific type of character such as a train, or a pig, or any other current interest they may have. For example, take a look at how much bestselling books earn for these character types, as well as the level of competition become a bestseller:\n\nData provided by Publisher Rocket\n\nSTEP 7. Make the Story Engaging\n\nYou need to make the story engaging in your children’s book.\n\nFirst, you need a good ending. Younger kids need a happy ending that satisfies them. You don’t want to make a kid cry because your story ended sadly. That doesn’t mean slightly more realistic conclusions are pointless, but your audience may struggle to understand complex topics.\n\nNext, make sure your main character is making deliberate choices to move the story forward. If they aren’t making any decisions, they probably shouldn’t be the main character.\n\nAny good story needs suspense, no matter your age category. Cliffhangers are a great way to engage your reader. In a younger book, a cliffhanger may be as simple as writing “Peek-a-” on one page, then “BOO!” on the next.\n\nHere are some examples of suspenseful questions that different age ranges should ask throughout the story:\n\nIn your picture book, is the caterpillar going to achieve its dream of becoming a butterfly? Is the mama cow going to find its baby calf?\n\nIn middle grade books, is the girl going to get her first kiss? Is the boy going to convince his parents to let him get the big Nerf water gun?\n\nIn YA books, is the protagonist going to realize she’s beautiful and save the world?\n\nSTEP 8. Proofread & Edit\n\nWhen you finish your first draft, you need to proofread and edit your children’s books.\n\nCheck out Kindlepreneur’s useful article on the Best Proofreading Services You'll Ever Find.\n\nYou should wait to hire a professional editor until you have self-edited your book. But you need a pro to look at your work before publishing.\n\nEditing is a valuable and necessary investment, particularly for anything longer than 600 words. A professional proofreader or a line editor can help with spelling and grammar. For chapter books and beyond, you may want to hire a developmental editor to look at the big picture.\n\nA good editor is instrumental in making your book a success because poor spelling, grammar, and book structure will reflect poorly on you as a children’s book writer, leading to negative reviews and fewer sales.\n\nYour book and its message might be fantastic, but too many errors will be noticed by your readers. They may voice their opinion in a review like this, which ultimately lowers your overall rating.\n\nSo if your book is more than 600-800 words long, you should send it off to a professional editor for proofing.\n\nYes, you can go over it yourself and let your significant other read through it. But letting an unbiased, independent professional look over it will make your manuscript as good as it can be.\n\nTo find a great editor, read Kindlepreneur’s handy article Selecting The Best Book Editor.\n\nSTEP 9. Illustrate Your Book\n\nWhen it comes to adding illustrations to your children’s book, there are three options you can choose from:\n\nDo it yourself\n\nHire someone\n\nCombination of both\n\nThe best option for you will depend on your budget, time, skill level, and trust you’re willing to put into someone else's interpretation of your story.\n\nIllustrating your book may take almost as much time as — if not more time than — actually writing the words of your children’s book.\n\nI’ve broken up the illustration process into 7 steps:\n\nChoose your orientation\n\nPlan your image sizing\n\nCreate a storyboard/book dummy\n\nCombine text & illustration\n\nChoose an illustrator\n\nPay for illustrations\n\nObtain your illustrations\n\n1. Choose Your Orientation\n\nWhen it comes to picture books, there are 3 orientations to choose from:\n\nVertical\n\nHorizontal\n\nSquare\n\n(This doesn’t apply to chapter books or books for older children. Those usually feature the classic 5½” x 8” format.)\n\nYou should choose your book’s orientation early on since it will inform virtually every decision about illustrations down the road.\n\nThis is not a hard and fast rule, but here are general reasons to choose each:\n\nVertical images are great for character-based books\n\nHorizontal images are best for a journey-like story\n\nSquare images are excellent for instructional books\n\n2. Plan Your Image Sizing\n\nWhether you hire an illustrator or create the illustrations yourself, you’ll want to make sure you plan your image sizing correctly. This way, once you upload your artwork, everything runs smoothly.\n\nBelow are the most common sizes for children’s book images:\n\n5.5” x 8.5”\n\n6” x 9”\n\n6.14 x 9.21”\n\n7” x 10”\n\n8” x 10”\n\n8.5” x 8.5”\n\n8.5” x 11”\n\nIf you plan on having your images cover the entire page, make sure to add 0.125” to the top and bottom, as well as one side. This accounts for trimming (sections to be removed in printing).\n\nAmazon offers handy templates to plan your image sizing. But remember that you’ll still have to add the bleed allowance yourself.\n\nHere are great inches-to-pixels and pixels-to-inches converters. These help you know how large your image should be, depending on your selected trim size. Be sure to choose a DPI (dots per inch) of 300 when using the mentioned converter.\n\n3. Create a Storyboard/Book Dummy\n\nA storyboard or book dummy helps you decide what to include in each illustration and how the text will match up with the images.\n\nThis is meant to help you determine which illustrations you want to include, better informing your quest to find and hire an illustrator. This step is extra helpful if you are planning to create your illustrations yourself.\n\nThe storyboard creation process doesn’t have to be perfect. Be expressive, and have fun. In the end, you’ll probably create a few different versions, each being an improvement over the previous one.\n\nHow to create a storyboard or book dummy:\n\nFold enough blank sheets of paper and staple the stack down the middle.\n\nPrint out your manuscript on a separate paper.\n\nCut and paste each block of text into the book dummy (folded paper).\n\nFlip through each page, read your pasted text, and think of an illustration that would go nicely with that particular text.\n\nStart sketching on the page of pasted text — or on the opposite page if that’s more helpful. Then you can visualize everything before you give your work to an illustrator.\n\n4. Combine Text & Illustration\n\nHow you combine your text and illustrations is entirely up to you.\n\nHowever, it's a crucial element on how to write a children's book. Whatever you choose, be consistent throughout.\n\nThere are two ways of combining text and illustrations:\n\nText as part of the image\n\nText and image separate\n\nText as Part of the Image\n\nHaving the text as part of the image makes your book format much more straightforward,, and looks consistent across all devices.\n\nHowever, you decide to include the text in the image itself, this will have to be done by your illustrator. This method makes editing the text a bit harder — any changes or corrections have to be made within the image itself.\n\nBelow (left) is a page from my book The Garbage Trucks Are Here, and on the right is a page from my book A Gemstone Adventure.\n\nText and Image Separate\n\nThe other option is to have the text and image separate. The text sits below or above the illustration or on a separate page.\n\nBelow is a double-page spread from my chapter book series, The Amulet Of Amser. It has an image on the left-hand page and the text on the right-hand page.\n\nYou can arrange this layout by yourself. You don't have to involve your illustrator.\n\n5. Choose an Illustrator\n\nI've started gathering individual authors and agencies into one big list to help with your search. Check them and their sites out below. Keep in mind that I haven't used these services myself.\n\nHere’s a list of outsourcing sites and social media sites where you can choose an illustrator for your children’s book:\n\nUpwork\n\nFiverr\n\nGuru\n\nFreelancer\n\nLinkedIn — artist and illustrator groups\n\nFacebook — artist and illustrator groups\n\nGoodreads groups\n\nDeviantArt\n\nChildren's Illustrators\n\nThese outsourcing sites provide you with reviews from the artist’s previous clients and may even include information about previous completion rates. Most importantly, these sites are cost-effective.\n\nOn most outsourcing sites, you’ll post your project (similar to a job offering), and children’s book illustrators will bid on it.\n\nTo get an idea of how much you should be offering, browse some of the platform’s current projects. Know that your bid sets a baseline only, as each illustrator will bid individually on your project if he or she is interested in working with you.\n\nFREE BONUS DOWNLOAD: To get you started with your illustrator search, I’ve created swipe files that you can use to post your Illustrator Project Description into any of the previously suggested sites. You can download it here\n\nAfter the initial bidding process (usually a couple of days), you will have to go through each illustrator’s profile and portfolio to decide who would — or wouldn’t — be a great fit.\n\nHere’s a helpful vetting process to see if an illustrator is a good fit:\n\nLook at their profile and read through previous reviews.\n\nView their portfolio to get a feel for their style.\n\nRequest a sample of their work to see how effectively they can turn your writing into illustrations and how well they follow instructions. View an example of such a request with this link.\n\n6. Pay for Illustrations\n\nYou’ll need to pay for illustrations. An illustrator is more critical than an editor for picture books — the illustrations are what the reader will be most focused on.\n\nTo get a feel for acceptable prices for a project, browse websites to find postings for similar projects. Actual prices differ significantly from service provider to service provider and change drastically over time.\n\nPayments are generally released based on milestones that you set, such as the completion of the storyboard. The milestone setup will depend on the scope of your project and the platform you are using to hire your illustrator.\n\nThe cost of your illustrator depends on multiple things:\n\nNumber of illustrations\n\nComplexity of the artwork\n\nIllustrator’s skill level and experience\n\nLocation of the illustrator\n\nDelivery speed\n\n7. Obtain the Illustrations\n\nOnce you choose the best-fitting illustrator for your project and they’ve completed their work, you need to obtain the illustrations.\n\nYou want high-resolution images (300 dpi) with the proper sizing and the raw files of all images. This will enable you to make changes directly to your illustrations if need be.\n\nA signed art release form is relevant if you decide to hire an illustrator directly. Any art attained via outsourcing sites should automatically make the illustrations your intellectual property.\n\nNeed Help with Your Keywords?\n\nTake my full featured video course on how to select the best keywords and categories for your book.\n\nTake the Course\n\nFAQs for Writing a Children’s Book\n\n1. Should I copyright my children’s book?\n\nThe answer to whether or not you should copyright your children’s book is entirely up to you. Just know that under U.S. copyright law, you already own your work the instant you write it down. However, you can protect your copyright by registering it with the US Copyright Office.\n\nRead Kindlepreneur’s handy article written by a lawyer: How to Copyright a Book in the US\n\nWhat should I not do when writing a children’s book?\n\n2. What should I not do when writing a children’s book?\n\nYou should try not to sound too preachy or instructional about your themes and morals. Kids are very perceptive. They smell an agenda miles away.\n\nYou should not leave a story unresolved or a question unanswered. Depending on the age group you’re writing your children’s book for, you need to provide a satisfying ending — particularly for smaller kids.\n\nYou should not break patterns. Children love a routine. The key to routines or patterns is to not break them. In your children's book, once we’ve established a pattern (rhyme, repeating phrase, character behavior, etc.), try your best to stick to it.\n\n3. How do I convert my children’s book into an ebook?\n\nOne of the easiest ways to convert your children’s book into an ebook is Amazon’s Kindle Kids’ Book Creator.\n\nWhile I use other methods, I love working with and recommending this simple yet powerful tool. It’s FREE and helps you create an ebook version for your illustrated children’s book. You can import artwork, add text, and create Kindle Text Pop-Ups.\n\nAnd the best part is that there’s no HTML/CSS knowledge required!\n\n4. Should my children’s book have a subtitle?\n\nYes, your children’s book should have a subtitle, mainly for marketing purposes.\n\nAs I share in my book How To Self-Publish A Children’s Book, making use of a subtitle can be very beneficial for connecting with potential readers.\n\nGiving your children’s book a subtitle provides you with an additional opportunity to use keywords, key phrases, or synonyms that potential readers might be using when searching for a children’s book like yours.\n\nUsing a subtitle also allows for more creative freedom than with your actual title. So if your title itself doesn't fully communicate the topic of the book, you’ll have the subtitle as a backup.\n\nFigure out what is trending in children's books using Publisher Rocket. Use this info to develop an effective subtitle.\n\nJust type in a children's book idea, and you can quickly see how many people are searching for those books on Amazon, the average amount of money made by the top books, and even the competition:\n\nAs you can see, some kids’ book genres have decent money coming into them with less competition. Make sure you do your research beforehand and title/subtitle your children’s book accordingly.\n\n5. How do I write a children’s book description?\n\nYou write a children’s book description (blurb) by looking at similar books’ descriptions. Pay special attention to length, word choice, and the style they are written in. That’s usually a great way to see what your audience expects and is used to.\n\nLike books of other genres, your book description is fundamental to your children’s book’s success.\n\nWhile your book cover and title help with your book’s discoverability and grabbing a potential buyer’s attention, your description is often the reason a reader decides to buy (or not to buy) your book.\n\nTo help you with your blurb format, be sure to check out Dave’s amazing Book Description Generator that takes care of all the text formatting for you.\n\n6. What category should my children's book be in?\n\nAmazon has over 450 paperback and 260 eBook categories for children’s books. Your children’s book should be in the category that best describes your audience:\n\nBoard Book — 0-3 years old\n\nPicture Book — 2-5 years old\n\nEarly Reader/Chapter Book — 6-10 years old\n\nMiddle Grade Chapter Book — 8-12 years old\n\nYoung Adult (Teen) Chapter Book — 12-18 years old\n\n(These categories are how Amazon’s marketplace categorizes children’s books.)\n\nDuring your children’s book setup, you may have noticed that not all children’s book categories are offered as an option. That’s because some of Amazon’s categories need to be unlocked before being selected.\n\nHowever, if you set up your children’s book correctly by adding age ranges, you will be able to add your book quickly and easily to any of these hidden categories by following Dave’s steps in his article How To Choose the Best Book Categories. This is a game-changer for you and your children's book.\n\n7.
