        "text": "Newark\n\nNew Jersey, United States\n\nRecent News\n\nJuly 19, 2024, 12:17 AM ET (ABC News (U.S.))\n\nNew Jersey environmental justice law won't block power plant hotly fought by Newark residents\n\nJuly 17, 2024, 2:06 AM ET (The Hill)\n\nNewark official wins special primary to fill late New Jersey congressman’s seat\n\nJuly 4, 2024, 6:59 AM ET (The Hindu)\n\nAir India cancels flight to bring back cricketers; DGCA seeks report\n\nNewark, city and port, Essex county, northeastern New Jersey, U.S. It lies on the west bank of the Passaic River and on Newark Bay, 8 miles (13 km) west of lower Manhattan Island, New York City. Newark was incorporated as a city in 1836. Pop. (2010) 277,140; Newark-Union Metro Division, 2,147,727; (2020) 311,549; Newark Metro Division, 2,280,061.\n\nHistory\n\nPuritans migrating from Connecticut founded Newark in 1666 on land purchased from Delaware Indians. The settlement, first named Pesayak Towne and later New Milford, was probably renamed for the home of the Reverend Abraham Pierson, who went there from Newark-on-Trent, England. Another version holds that the name was of biblical significance (New Ark). Newark became the seat of Essex county (1682) and was chartered as a township in 1693.\n\nAfter the American Revolution, Newark became (c. 1790) noted for leather tanning, jewelry, and shoe manufacturing. The shoe industry profited greatly from the inventiveness of Seth Boyden, who, regarded by Thomas Edison as one of the greatest American inventors, came to Newark from Massachusetts in 1815 and developed a process for making patent leather (1818). He is credited as the first producer of malleable cast iron (1826) and as a developer of an improved, larger strawberry. There is a statue of him in Washington Park. Newark’s other industrial pioneers included the Reverend Hannibal Goodwin, who patented a flexible film for motion pictures (1887), and Edward Weston, who invented electrical measuring instruments (1888).\n\nFrom the 1950s through the ’70s there was an outward movement of population from Newark that fundamentally altered its ethnic composition, a change that accelerated after the city was wracked by rioting in 1967. The movement of whites to the suburbs raised the proportion of African Americans in the city from less than one-fifth in 1950 to about three-fifths by the 1990s. African Americans obtained some political power in Newark in 1970, when the city elected its first Black mayor, Kenneth A. Gibson. Newark has faced increasing rates of poverty, infant mortality, and citizens infected by the AIDS virus.\n\nThe contemporary city\n\nNewark’s proximity to New York City places it within the country’s most highly industrialized and populous area. The city is the largest in New Jersey and is a leading industrial centre. Its manufactures are highly diversified and include electronic equipment, leather goods, chemicals, rubber, jewelry, furniture and fixtures, textiles, industrial machinery, and foodstuffs. Printing, publishing, and the insurance business are also significant. Newark is a transportation centre and a major East Coast distributing point. Newark International Airport is one of the world’s busiest, since it serves both Newark and the New York City area. The Port of Newark, started in 1915, is now leased and operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\n\nLocated in Newark are the New Jersey Institute of Technology (1881), the Newark campus of Rutgers University, a branch of Seton Hall University (1856; Roman Catholic), Essex County College (1968), and the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (1956). Near the city centre is Military Park, used as a drill ground in colonial times and now the site of a bronze group of figures, The Wars of America, by Gutzon Borglum. Branch Brook, a county park, is noted for its Japanese cherry trees. In front of the county courthouse, designed by Cass Gilbert, is a seated statue of Abraham Lincoln, also by Borglum. Historic buildings include Trinity Cathedral (1733), used as a hospital during the Revolution; House of Prayer (1850), with its older stone rectory, Plume House (1710); and the First Presbyterian Church (1790). Adjacent to and part of the Newark Museum of Art (which has a variety of exhibits) is the Ballantine House (1880s), a restored Victorian mansion. The New Jersey Performing Arts Center (NJPAC; 1997), across from Military Park, is a multipurpose venue with fine acoustics and a mix of small and large performance spaces; it is home to the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra. Several blocks away, near City Hall (1908) and the Depression-era Newark Penn Station (which serves Amtrak, subway, and commuter trains), is the Prudential Center (2007), venue for the New Jersey Devils ice-hockey team and host to other sports and entertainment events.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.
