        "text": "At McCarter, Lauren Keating’s rewrite of Charles Dickens “A Christmas Carol” relates Scrooge’s obsession with money to Dickens’ life story. Of the two children in the play who have symbolic names, “Want” and “Ignorance,” Dickens was a child of want.\n\nWhile previous productions delighted audiences with spectacle and magic deployed by the spirits who scare Ebenezer Scrooge into generosity, Keating’s version is much more generous with psychological insights. For instance, it opens with a peddler who introduces all the characters, including Ebenezer’s obnoxious father. Ebenezer, played by Dee Pellettier, skillfully reveals his gradual change.\n\nAs a collector of antique buttons, and a member of the New Jersey State Button Society, I have been doing research on the history of button making and ran across what I believe to be a significant insight into Dickens’ childhood. In 1852, in his ”Household Words,” he described the Birmingham button factories: ‘range beyond range of machines—the punching, drilling, stamping machines, the polishing wheels, and all the bright and compact, and never-tiring apparatus which is so familiar a spectacle in Birmingham work-rooms. We see hundreds of women, scores of children, and a few men… Very young children gather up the cut circles. Little boys, ‘just out of the cradle,’ range the pasteboard circles, and pack them close, on edge, in boxes or trays; and girls, as young, arrange on a table the linen circles…”\n\nFar from being outraged at this child labor, Dickens wholeheartedly approved. Compared to his own experience, the button making tots had it easy. After all, they were with their parents and worked only 10-12 hours a day.\n\nIn contrast, when Dickens was 12, his job (pictured above) was to paste labels on bootblack jars in vermin-infested smelly factory with long hours. Meanwhile his father was in debtors’ prison, accompanied by his mother, along with the younger children.\n\nIf naysayers object to Ebenezer being played by a woman, oh well. As Keating points out, gender differences were more accepted in Dickens time than in Victorian times. Dickens refers to “the cook and the cook’s special friend.”\n\nIf this version more openly preaches the moral of the story, so be it. That’s in the true spirit of Charles Dickens.\n\nCorrection: earlier I listed the Dickens publication as “Household Matters.” Apparently it was “Household Words.”\n\nOceans, rivers, fish and whales — see them pictured on buttons at the New Jersey State Button Society (NJSBS) Show and Competition, set for Saturday, May 12, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Button collectors will also enter competitions featuring baskets and buttons made from celluloid and black glass.\n\nThe show will be held at the Union Fire Company fire hall, 1396 River Road (Route 29), Titusville, NJ 08560, and there is plenty of free parking. Admission is $2 for adults, free for juniors to age 17.\n\nThis show and sale of collectible clothes buttons attracts antique enthusiasts, quilters, crafters, re-enactors, and those seeking special buttons to wear. The day’s activities include a button raffle and a forum on how to put together a winning entry for the state competitions.\n\nMembers of the NJSBS share an interest in studying, collecting, and preserving clothing buttons, both old and new. The NJSBS was founded in 1941, at a time when a nationwide interest in button collecting was surging. Many authors of classic books on button collecting come from New Jersey.\n\nThe Union Fire Company & Rescue Squad building is located at the intersection of Route 29 and Park Lake Avenue in Titusville, opposite the Delaware River and D&R Canal State Park (with easy access to the canal park), a half mile north of Washington Crossing State Park in Hopewell Township, and some five miles south of Lambertville and New Hope, PA. Contact 732-356-4132. email, buttonsinnewjersey@gmail.com, or visit http://newjerseystatebuttonsociety.org.\n\nOn Saturday, September 10, at 2 p.m. at the New Jersey State Button Society Show and Sale, I will give an illustrated talk “Button Pioneers of New Jersey,” looking at how devoted button collectors operated in the 2oth century, aiming to inspire collectors in the 21st century.\n\nEveryone is invited! The show is amazing — a dozen dealers, thousands of buttons to admire and/or buy and there’s even a raffle. It costs just $2 and is at the Union Fire Company Banquet Hall in Titusville.\n\nIt’s a case of the shoemaker’s child. You’d think I’d have posted on my own blog before now, but I am having too much fun putting together at talk with adorable pictures like the one below.\n\nJoin me at the New Jersey State Button Society (NJSBS) for its 75th Anniversary on Saturday, May 7, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. The Spring Show and Sale is at the Union Fire Company hall, 1396 River Road (Route 29), Titusville, NJ 08560, where there is plenty of free parking. All are welcome; admission is $2 for adults, free for juniors to age 17.\n\nAt 1:30 an historic costume will be auctioned. Covered with old mother of pearl buttons, it is fashioned after the English Pearly outfits, dating from the 19th century, which are still being worn today by Pearly Kings and Queens in London to raise money for charities. Ruth Berry, a pioneer in button collecting since the 1940s, wore it with matching pearly shoes, for special button shows and events.\n\nThanks to Laura Pollack and Vincent Xu of Hopewell Express for this article quoting Carol Meszaros and Sara Mulford about the joys of collecting buttons. Thanks to Yanis Careto of Hopeless Nostalgic for the photo of Carol Meszaros taken at an NJSBS program at the Lawrence Library.\n\nFor Women’s History Month — and for National Button Week – here is a button that covers both. It is of the Brooklyn Bridge. This article credits its construction to Emily Roebling who took her father-in-law’s drawings and advice from her bedridden husband to direct the workers.\n\nTo honor National Button Week and also the 75th anniversary of the New Jersey State Button Society, I will give a talk on how buttons can illuminate local history. This button will be on prominent display — in fact it is in the case at the Lawrence Branch of the Mercer County Library now. Set for Saturday, March 19, at 2 p.m. at the library, the free talk will focus on Theresa Doelger Kuser, doyenne of Kuser Farm Mansion, and I will be joined by Sally Lane, her great granddaughter.\n\nPerhaps I’ll see you there — or at the Women’s College Club of Princeton on Monday, March 21, at 1 p.m. at All Saint’s Church. Guests are welcome, and it will be a different subject, “Every Button has a Story: What story do your buttons tell?” The 133-year-old Brooklyn Bridge is billed as “the most well built bridge in the city” and surely it has stories to tell.\n\nOr perhaps I’ll inspire you to come to the NJSBS Show and Sale on Saturday, May 7 in Titusville.\n\nIf “diamonds are a girl’s best friend,” as Marilyn Monroe liked to sing, a very big cake and a diamond anniversary button will help members and guests of New Jersey State Button Society (NJSBS) celebrate its 75th Anniversary on Saturday, May 7, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. The NJSBS will hold its Spring Show and Sale at the Union Fire Company hall, 1396 River Road (Route 29), Titusville, NJ 08560, where there is plenty of free parking. All are welcome; admission is $2 for adults, free for juniors to age 17.\n\nMore than a dozen dealers and artists will offer buttons made from enamel, china, metal, and ivory — plus modern and vintage buttons made from fruit pits, rubber, and glass. The anniversary button, made by New Jersey studio artist Nancy DuBois, will be distributed. At an information table, guests can learn about buttons and the collecting hobby. After the anniversary cake is cut at 1 p.m., there will be a button raffle, an NJSBS business meeting, and Annie Frazier, past president of the National Button Society, will lead a forum on how entries are judged for state competitions.\n\n“This show of collectible clothing buttons attracts antique enthusiasts, quilters, crafters, re-enactors, and those seeking special buttons to wear,” says Sara Mulford, president of the NJSBS. “Whether you are fascinated with their artistic quality, want to examine their material and construction, or seek to delve into their history, there will be buttons for everyone in all price ranges.”\n\nMembers of the NJSBS share an interest in studying, collecting, and preserving clothing buttons, both old and new. The group was founded on March 27, 1941, at a time when a nationwide interest in button collecting was surging. Many authors of classic books on button collecting come from New Jersey.\n\nThe anniversary celebration will continue on Saturday, September 10, at the Fall Show and Sale, same times and place. The Union Fire Company & Rescue Squad building is located at the intersection of Route 29 and Park Lake Avenue in Titusville, opposite the Delaware River and D&R Canal State Park (within easy access to the canal park), a half mile north of Washington Crossing State Park in Hopewell Township, and some five miles south of Lambertville and New Hope, PA.\n\nFor questions contact Sara Mulford, president, slmulford@verizon.net or 856-275-6945 or see http://newjerseystatebuttonsociety.org\n\n-30-\n\nSaturday, May 7, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., New Jersey State Button Society Fall Show and Competition, Union Fire Company fire hall, 1396 River Road (Route 29), Titusville, NJ 08560. Diamond Anniversary Celebration. Admission: $2 for adults at the door. http://newjerseystatebuttonsociety.org\n\nSaturday, September 10, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., New Jersey State Button Society Fall Show and Competition, Union Fire Company fire hall, 1396 River Road (Route 29), Titusville, NJ 08560. Admission: $2 for adults at the door. http://newjerseystatebuttonsociety.org\n\nThe New Jersey State Button Society (NJSBS) will celebrate the start of its 75th anniversary year with a free program, “The Button Sampler,” on Saturday, January 9, at 2 p.m. at the Lawrence headquarters of the Mercer County Library System, 2751 Brunswick Pike. If you are curious about buttons you own and want to attend, call the library at 609-989-6920, email me, or email lawprogs@mcl.org — or just show up. A similar program will be Saturday, March 19.\n\nThe program honors the book “The Button Sampler,” co-written by the late Lillian Smith Albert. A Hightstown resident, she founded the NJSBS in 1941, when interest in button collecting began to surge. Through her research and study Albert helped to make button collecting the important hobby which it is today. The members of the state society share an interest in studying, collecting, and preserving clothing buttons, both old and new.\n\nTo share their enthusiasm and knowledge, my fellow NJSBS members will tell about favorite buttons and offer help to new collectors. Bring up to a dozen clothing buttons and learn about buttons made from a selection of the dozens of different materials, including black and colored glass, china, plastic, metal, shell, and wood.\n\nThere will be another button meeting during National Button Week, on Saturday, March 19, at 2 p.m., so mark your calendars. And the NJSBS will celebrate its Diamond Anniversary at its Show and Competition on Saturday, May 7, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Union Fire Company, 1396 River Road (Route 29), Titusville, NJ.\n\nGetting ready for the New Jersey State Button Society show on Saturday, I’m putting together a tray of “a dozen pretty ladies,” and one of them is a button with the head of Sarah Bernhardt (pictured), another of St. Cecelia. Another category that’s fun is “buttons representing New Jersey — sports, famous people, harness racing, and the shore etc, The only famous person from my collection that I could put on that tray is — Lafayette. I did find one showing harness racing, and one with a Princeton tiger.\n\nThe show is Saturday, September 12, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Union Fire Company in Titusville, New Jersey. The Union Fire Company, is at 1396 River Road (at the intersection of Route 29 and Park Lake Avenue in Titusville), opposite the Delaware River and D&R Canal State Park (with easy access to the canal park), a half mile north of Washington Crossing State Park in Hopewell Township, and some five miles south of Lambertville and New Hope, PA. There is plenty of free parking. Admission is $2 for adults, free for juniors to age 17. For questions about the show or the club, email me or see http://newjerseystatebuttonsociety.org.\n\nVisitors may vote for their favorite entries in each of the competitions, including the Pretty Ladies category that asks for 12 buttons with pictures of women. Buttons showing various aspects of New Jersey — sports, famous people, harness racing, and the shore — will also be on display.\n\nDealers from all over the East Coast sell vintage, antique, and modern buttons, and the activities also include educational displays and a button raffle. At 1:30 p.m. on September 12, Annie Frazier, former president of the National Button Society, will give a competition and judging workshop. .\n\nSometimes competitions are strictly judged, but for this show it’s “popular vote.” Every attendee gets to vote. It will be fun! Look for me in the kitchen serving coffee…."
