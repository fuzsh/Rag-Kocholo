        "text": "HELLO\n\nI’m Jenny. I was born, raised, and educated in southeastern Virginia—that’s the bottom corner of the state that looks like a half-eaten tortilla chip. After college, I moved to New York City. It was a big city and a big change, but I’d wanted to work in children’s books since I was nine, and New York was the place.\n\nSince then, I’ve worked as a children’s book editor, freelance writer, and author, and met tons of creative people along the way. As an editor, I loved working with other authors and illustrators to hone their ideas and craft their stories and art into finished books. After becoming a mom, I decided focus on raising my two sons and working on my own writing.\n\nAs a writer, my passion is creating books with a funny, slightly nerdy bent. I love humor, history, introverts, and underdogs, as well as stories for boys that speak to their interests without ignoring their emotions. I also enjoy working with my sons’ school to spread reading joy—organizing author visits, read-a-thons, and used book sales. Most recently I’ve become an advocate for certified school librarians, which are sadly shrinking in numbers. I live with my husband and two sons in Brooklyn and upstate New York."
