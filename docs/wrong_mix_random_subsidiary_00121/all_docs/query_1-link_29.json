        "text": "Michael J. Fox and his wife Tracy Pollan have four children.\n\nThey have a son named Sam and three daughters named Aquinnah, Schuyler, and Esmé.\n\nMichael J. Fox's family is his biggest support system.\n\nThe \"Back to the Future\" star has four children with Tracy Pollan, his wife of 35 years. Fox, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1991 when he was 29 years old, has been outspoken about his family's support. His wife and kids appeared in his 2023 documentary \"Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie\" and have attended red carpet events with the actor.\n\nIn a 2009 interview with Good Housekeeping, the star said that his kids have learned \"empathy, resilience, and also sorting out what's important from what's not\" as he lives with Parkinson's.\n\n\"They're all smarter than me and all better looking than me, they're all taller than me,\" Fox said of his children in an interview for \"Sunday Today With Willie Geist\" in 2020. \"And so I look up to them.\"\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Fox's four kids.\n\nSam Michael Fox, 34, is the eldest child\n\nMichael and Tracy's first kid, Sam, was born on May 30, 1989.\n\nSam works in film production and development. He's credited as a producer on the 2020 short film \"Good Grief\" and the 2011 music video for actor and singer Ben Barnes' song \"11:11.\"\n\nIn a 2020 interview with The Guardian, Michael said that his daughters \"would roll their eyes\" when the actor mentioned being on the covers of magazines decades prior, but his son was more understanding.\n\n\"Sam, he gets it,\" Michael said. \"He knows all about filmmakers and films, so he really understands my career.\"\n\nFox's twin daughters, Aquinnah Kathleen Fox, and Schuyler Frances Fox, are 29\n\nThey were born on February 15, 1995.\n\nSchuyler received a master's in education from the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 2022, according to her LinkedIn profile. She was also involved in The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, working as a research cohorts officer for almost a year. She's now a children's media producer.\n\nAquinnah graduated from Duke University in 2018 with a bachelor's degree in psychology, visual and media studies, and art history. During her time at Duke, she also cofounded Pancakes for Parkinson's, a student-run organization that hosts fundraising events on campus to raise money for The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research.\n\nNowadays, Aquinnah is involved in the behind-the-scenes side of Hollywood, working in TV development at Annapurna Pictures.\n\nEsmé Annabelle Fox, 22, is the youngest sibling\n\nEsmé was born on November 3, 2001, and is a student at Duke University. She's pursuing a bachelor's degree in global cultural studies and literature with minors in journalism and visual media, per her LinkedIn.\n\nEsmé is also involved in Pancakes for Parkinson's and currently works part-time as a reporter at the North Carolina-based publication The 9th Street Journal.\n\nMichael celebrated Esmé's 22nd birthday on Instagram in November, writing: \"Happy Birthday magical Ezzie!
