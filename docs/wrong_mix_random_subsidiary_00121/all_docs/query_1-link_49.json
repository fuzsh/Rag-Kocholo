        "text": "Inspiration can come from the most unlikely of sources. For Emily Jane Fox— the 29-year-old author of Born Trump: Inside America’s First Family—that source was Michael Cohen, whose insight into the Trump progeny became the backbone of her bestselling book. “[He gave] me the structure where Donald had five kids hoping that one would turn out just like him,” Fox says. “But the reality is that he had five kids, and each one has a very distinct personality trait of his.”\n\nEnter:\n\nIvanka, the media mastermind. Don Jr., the attack dog. Eric, the builder. Tiffany, the outsider. The characters of Born Trump are immediately, notoriously familiar, yet Fox’s depictions are revelatory. (Barron, the youngest, is omitted for a number of reasons, but “mostly there's not much interesting to say about a twelve-year-old.”)\n\nA staff writer for Vanity Fair, Fox began covering Ivanka back in 2015, when many considered the Trump campaign a novelty and its triumph an impossibility. The future first daughter “was—and is—very glamorous. And she was famous. And she is from the Upper East side and she was now starting to go around the country… with this crazy lunatic who happened to be a father,” Fox says. “She sort of straddled the two worlds. It was politics, but she was also in business, and she was also in the one percent.”\n\nIn October 2016, Fox’s reporting on Ivanka and company attracted the attention of a literary agent, who pressed her to write a book. “These people are going to lose the election. No one's going to care about them,” Fox remembers thinking. Plus, she adds, “I never saw myself really writing a book.”\n\nShe ghosted the agent.\n\nFox, who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2011, always knew she wanted to be a journalist. She describes herself as “super nosy by nature” and recalls staying home on Friday nights as a child to watch Dateline.\n\nThe summer before her senior year of college, Fox interned for the White House. “I thought I wanted to be a political reporter, until I didn't,” she says. “I was like, ‘You know what? This is not necessarily what I want to cover. I don't know what I want to cover, but politics feels like a horse race.’”\n\nAt the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, she began to explore other beats. “[I realized] every story is a business story—you can make anything a business story,” she says. “It was also 2011, and people were still very consumed with the economic crisis. Business news was the news.”\n\nFive days after graduating from J-school, she started as a business reporter for CNN, where she would call Wall Street analysts from a spreadsheet to ask about fluctuations in the stock market. “I wouldn't understand their explanations for it, but I'd write their explanations for it, and eventually you kind of get the hang of it,” she says.\n\nFox’s dogged work ethic didn’t hurt either. “I just think being thought of as someone who will work as hard as they need to work and be a member of a team, even if it doesn't serve them, it just is always a good thing to do,” she says.\n\nThen, came a turning point: November 8, 2016. With Trump careening towards the Oval Office, Fox realized that if she didn't write the book on the newly minted first family, someone else would. She emailed the agent back, the pair put together a proposal, and the book sold quickly. To ensure she wouldn’t be scooping herself, she decided to end the book at the inauguration. In total, she interviewed around 150 people.\n\n“I set out to understand this very unusual, very powerful family so that we could perhaps understand some of the things that happened and what may happen,” she says. In the process, she learned a lot about writing, about herself. And about the Trumps? “Everyone can relate to, in some way, how shaped they are by their parents' flaws, their parents' failures, and these kids happen to have a very flawed, very difficult father. He didn't know how to parent,” she says.\n\nWhen asked whether she would write another book in the future, Fox groans. “Right now, I don’t want to think about it. Ever. Again.” But she relents, laughing. “I hear it’s like childbirth, where you get amnesia about it.”\n\nBesides, taking a break seems outside of Fox's DNA. “We're living in a time where you have to work incredibly hard and it's nonstop. It's 24 hours a day. But if you love what you're doing, it feels okay, and it's a hard ride to want to get off of.\""
