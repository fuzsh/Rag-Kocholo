        "text": "Michael J. Fox is celebrating his son Sam Fox's 35th birthday.\n\nThe \"Back to the Future\" franchise star, who turns 63 on June 9, honored his \"best friend\" in a special birthday post May 30 on Instagram.\n\n\"Sam, what a trip it’s been. From the boy who had questions about everything to the man who has so many answers and still more questions. I love you.\n\n\"Oh yeah, thanks for all the laughs. You are my best friend and only son. Happy birthday!\" the elder Fox wrote alongside a pic of his son blowing out candles on a birthday cake.\n\nIf the image looks familiar, that's because it's the same one the actor posted last year when he jokingly wished his \"big bouncing baby boy\" a happy 34th.\n\n\"Proud to be your pops,\" he wrote at the time. He also included another shot of him kissing his son on the cheek as the pair posed in front of a waterfall.\n\nMichael J. Fox shares Sam Fox with his wife, Tracy Pollan. The longtime couple, who tied the knot in 1988, are also parents to twin daughters Aquinnah and Schuyler Fox, 29, and a younger daughter, Esmé Fox, 22.\n\nPollan also paid a special birthday tribute to Sam Fox on May 30. “Happy birthday to my absolute favorite partner in crime! I love you so much — Have the best birthday,” she wrote alongside an adorable throwback of him as a little boy and a second, more recent shot of the mother and son.\n\nMichael J. Fox cited his wife's love and nurturing as the reason why the couple's children have grown into caring and well-rounded adults.\n\n\"Our children are beautiful, sensitive, intelligent, empathetic, independent, compassionate, adventurous, lovely people. That’s your fault. We all love you so much,\" he wrote in a Mother's Day tribute on Instagram in May 2022.\n\nPollan returned the compliment in a heartfelt Father's Day post in June 2023. \"What do you get when you combine kindness, generosity, hilarity and thoughtfulness? Best dad ever! Thank you @realmikejfox for being all of that and more. Happy Fathers Day all!\" she wrote.\n\nThe tight-knit family have attended events together, including stepping out to the Michael J. Fox Foundation's annual gala to support research for Parkinson's disease.\n\nPollan and her twin daughters were also on hand to cheer on Michael J. Fox when he was honored with a lifetime achievement award during the Moving Image Awards at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York City in June 2023.\n\nRead on to learn more about Michael J. Fox and Tracy Pollan's kids.\n\nSam Fox\n\nMichael J. Fox and Pollan's oldest child, son Sam Fox, has followed in his parents' footsteps to work in the entertainment industry.\n\nThe 35-year-old Sam Fox's credits include serving as a producer on Ben Barnes’ \"11:11\" music video and on the short film \"Good Grief,\" as well as working on the production staff for the Netflix series \"Dead Boy Detectives,\" according to IMDb.\n\nThe younger Fox also inherited his parents' love for family, posting photos of his parents and his siblings on his official Instagram account.\n\nAquinnah Fox\n\nThe couple welcomed twin daughters Aquinnah and Schuyler Fox in February 1995.\n\nPollan shared several pics of the sisters on Instagram in honor of their 29th birthday earlier this year.\n\n\"Happy birthday @aquinnah_fox and @schuyler_fox. You are the gifts that keep on giving and I am so grateful I get to be your mom. Love you love you love you!!!!\" she wrote in her caption.\n\nSchuyler Fox\n\nMichael J. Fox also celebrated the twins' 29th birthday with his own gallery of pics on Instagram. \"Double the love. Happy birthday. You’re crushing it. I love you, Doods,\" he wrote in his caption.\n\nIn May 2024, Pollan shared a pic on Instagram showing Schuyler Fox and her younger sister, Esmé Fox, celebrating after they finished running the Brooklyn Half marathon in New York.\n\nMichael J. Fox also shared a pic of his daughters and his wife at the event. \"Amazing women. I love you three. So proud,\" he wrote.\n\nEsmé Fox\n\nThe couple's youngest daughter, Esmé, has studied at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. Pollan visited her daughter at the university in October 2021, captioning a photo on Instagram, \"Visiting this beauty, Go Duke!\"\n\nWhile still a student at Duke, Esmé Fox spent a summer working as a trending reporter for the Tampa Bay Times in Florida, according to a bio on the publication's website.\n\nWhen her youngest child turned 22 in November 2023, Pollan shared a gallery on Instagram filled with travel pics from the pair's trips together.\n\n\"Happy birthday to this most beautiful human, you touch everyone you meet, and make the world a better place. I love traveling the world with you, I love you so,\" the proud mom wrote."
