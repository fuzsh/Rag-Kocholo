        "text": "American author\n\nPaula Fox (April 22, 1923 – March 1, 2017) was an American author of novels for adults and children and of two memoirs. For her contributions as a children's writer she won the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Award in 1978, the highest international recognition for a creator of children's books.[1][2] She also won several awards for particular children's books including the 1974 Newbery Medal for her novel The Slave Dancer;[3][b] a 1983 National Book Award in category Children's Fiction (paperback) for A Place Apart;[4][c] and the 2008 Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis for A Portrait of Ivan (1969) in its German-language edition Ein Bild von Ivan.[5][d]\n\nIn 2011, she was inducted into the New York State Writers Hall of Fame.[6] The NYSW Hall of Fame is a project of the Empire State Center for the Book.[7] Her adult novels went out of print in 1992. In the mid nineties she enjoyed a revival as her adult fiction was championed by a new generation of American writers.[8]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nPaula Fox was born in New York City on April 22, 1923. Her mother, Elsie De Sola, was Cuban and a screenwriter.[9] Her father, Paul Hervey Fox, wrote screenplays[9] and taught English. After he divorced Elsie, he had 3 sons and a daughter with his second wife, Mary.[citation needed]\n\nElsie De Sola Fox rejected her daughter Paula at birth and she and Paul left her in a foundling home. Her maternal grandmother, Candelaria de Sola, temporarily visiting New York City, rescued her and she was moved around Florida, Cuba and the US. Unable at the time to provide a home herself, Candelaria gave the infant to Reverend Elwood Corning and his bedridden mother in Balmville, New York.[10]\n\nCorning treated Fox kindly and taught her important lessons. When she first visited her parents at age five, her mother openly scorned her. As she wrote in her memoir Borrowed Finery, the reunion was so traumatic that \"I sensed that if she could have hidden the act she would have killed me.\"[11]\n\nIn 1943, Fox was living in the household of famed acting coach Stella Adler and became friendly with Marlon Brando, another of Adler's students who was living there.[12][13] She became pregnant and gave the child, Linda Carroll, up for adoption.[9][14] There have been persistent rumors that Brando was in fact Carroll's father,[15] although neither Brando nor Fox ever commented on the matter.[16][17] Carroll, who became an author and psychotherapist, is the mother of musician Courtney Love. Visual artist Frances Bean Cobain is Fox's great-granddaughter.[18]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nFox attended the Columbia University School of General Studies from 1955-58 and married Richard Sigerson, by whom she had two sons. She later married literary critic and translator Martin Greenberg, and worked for years as a teacher and tutor for troubled children. Only in her 40s did she begin her first novel, Poor George, about a cynical schoolteacher who finds purpose—and ruin—in mentoring a vagrant teenager.[19] The novel was received well (Bernard Bergonzi in the New York Review of Books calling it \"the best novel I've read in a long time\") but sold poorly, a pattern that all her adult novels would follow. Desperate Characters came next with Alfred Kazin calling it a \"brilliant performance\" and \"quite devastating\" while Lionel Trilling described it as \"a reserved and beautifully realized novel\". By 1992 all six of her novels were out of print.[11]\n\nIn 2011 she was inducted into the New York State Writers Hall of Fame.[20] The Writers Hall of Fame is a project of the Empire State Center for the Book.[7] She was championed by the author Jonathan Franzen, who saw that some of her books were re-issued.[9]\n\nFox died at age 93 in Brooklyn on March 1, 2017.[21]\n\nAdaptations\n\n[edit]\n\nA Portuguese Feature Film[22] Coitado do Jorge[23] based on Poor George was directed by Jorge Silva Melo in 1993. Desperate Characters was made into a movie starring Shirley MacLaine in 1971.\n\nWorks\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nChildren's literature portal\n\nNovels portal\n\nList of Cuban American writers\n\nList of Famous Cuban-Americans\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nPaula Fox at Boyds Mills Press\n\nPaula Fox at Library of Congress, with 57 library catalog records\n\nInterviews"
