        "text": "Born and raised in Jackson, Michigan, I've always loved to read. When I decided at age 12 that I wanted to be a writer, my first stories reflected my interest in science fiction (though somehow they always managed a romance as well). I devoured all of Robert Heinlein's books for teens and lived for Star Trek, Lost in Space, Time Tunnel, and the Invaders. As I went through school, I contributed to a creative writing booklet in junior high school and worked on the newspaper staff in high school, acting as editor during my senior year. Following graduation from Parkside High School in 1974, I attended the local junior college in pursuit of a journalism degree. However, before I completed my degree, I fell in love and married. My husband, John Fox, joined the Air Force soon after we married and we spent the next twenty years living in various places around the U.S. and in Europe, such as Tacoma, WA; Charleston, SC; Mons, Belgium; Colorado Springs, CO and Biloxi, MS. During that time, we had three children--two boys and girl, who are now grown and have provided me with three wonderful grandchildren. During these years I discovered romance, which replaced SF as my favorite reading material. I loved to read how these amazing take-charge women survived their adventures and earned the love of the one man perfectly suited for them. My stories reflected this new interest, though I never lost my appreciation for the world of science fiction. When futuristic romances arrived on the market, it was the best of both worlds. There I found the adventure of visiting new worlds and cultures while still sharing in the emotional journey made by the hero and heroine. I was hooked. I continued writing as we moved from place to place, though the pace slowed as I raised my three children and managed to pick up five cats. It wasn't until I reached Colorado Springs and learned about a local Romance Writers of America chapter that I went from writing for fun to writing as a career. I joined the chapter and learned the business. I became part of a critique group, the Wyrd Sisters, and grew as a writer. After five years, four completed books, and a move to Biloxi, I finally sold my first book to Leisure Love Spell. My first book, Sword of MacLeod, made the Ingram's Bestseller List as did my second book, Somewhere My Love. In fact, I was thrilled when I learned that Somewhere My Love was a RITA finalist in 1998 for Best Paranormal. This book was also a finalist in Affaire de Coeur's Reader Awards, The Award of Excellence from Colorado Romance Writers, and FF&P's PRISM Award. After losing my editor, I had a brief dry spell until I sold a book of my heart--a contemporary fantasy entitled Prince of Charming --to Berkley/Jove. Since then, I sold three more contemporary fantasies to Berkley/Jove and wrote two books in series done with some of my Wyrd Sisters. My second contemporary fantasy, Buttercup Baby, was a 2002 winner of the Booksellers' Best Award. I'm currently a member of Pikes Peak Writers and Novelist Inc. and I work on the annual Pikes Peak Writers Conference and Novelist Inc conference.. Now that my husband has retired from the Air Force, we're making our home in the Rocky Mountains outside Colorado Springs, CO. Now retired from my job at The MITRE Corporation as a Technical Support Specialist, I spend my time at home writing, surrounded by deer, turkeys and the occasional bear, I love writing books with that little twist from the ordinary. I hope you enjoy reading them as well. You can visit my website at http://karenafox.com or email me at karen@karenafox.com.\n\nRead full bio"
