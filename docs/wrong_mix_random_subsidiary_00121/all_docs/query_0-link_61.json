        "text": "2-min read\n\nIt's a good day in Jersey food news as our state officially has two fewer struggling restaurants.\n\nWell, theoretically.\n\nGordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares season 10 premiered Monday on FOX, and two North Jersey restaurants — Bask 46, a bar and grill in Woodland Park, and Da Mimmo, an Italian restaurant in Dumont — will be featured in upcoming episodes. Back in June, Ramsay was spotted filming an undisclosed television show at the aforementioned locations, but formal confirmation of the specific series was not revealed until now.\n\n(Though, let's be real; we totally called this in a previous article).\n\nGordon Ramsay visits Woodland Park\n\nEarlier this year in May, Bask46 announced a temporary closing on Instagram.\n\n\"We are already making improvements,\" the team wrote, and thanked patrons for their patience.\n\nThough the public already had a good idea of what was going on (one Instagram user asked \"@_bask46, did Ramsay tear you a new a**hole?\"), the purpose of the shutdown wasn't verified until earlier this week when showrunner David DeAngelis stated that the restaurant would be featured in the second episode.\n\n\"We have a chef in Bask 46, which is going to air as the second episode,\" he told Variety, \"Who calls himself the 'the culinary gangster'.\"\n\nMeanwhile, an ongoing zoning board application to demolish the small strip mall that houses the Bask Bar & Grill and replacing it with a Dunkin' drive-thru has been postponed until Oct. 30.\n\nThe application has a number of objectors, including Steve Baskinger, who is Bask's owner.\n\nGordon Ramsay visits Dumont\n\nDeAngelis also confirmed Da Mimmo's upcoming feature.\n\n\"Da Mimmo is a restaurant we shot in Dumont, New Jersey\" he told Variety. \"It was opened just under a year ago via Melissa Gigante (and her) three sons who are all in their 20s. They’re all huge social media stars, the Gigante brothers.\"\n\nDespite the fact that the boys have millions of TikTok followers, he explains, \"They absolutely do not have any clue on how to run a restaurant.\"\n\nBask46's Kitchen Nightmares episode is scheduled to air this Monday, October 2 at 8pm EST. Da Mimmo's will air at the same time on October 16.\n\nThe return of 'Kitchen Nightmares,' one of TV's favorite food series\n\nSeason 10 of Kitchen Nightmares marks the return of the show after a 10-year hiatus. The catalyst behind the decision to bring it back, Ramsay told Variety, was the timing.\n\n\"It means a lot for me personally to bring this show back,\" he said. \"The time felt right. After the pandemic...the industry has seen some of the most difficult times in the history across the food and drink hospitality sector. So, it really upsets me when I travel the world and see so many restaurants that have closed through no fault of their own.”\n\nComing from TV's loudest, most red-faced chef, that sentimental quote almost led us to think that Ramsay might be softening up a bit.\n\nAccording to DeAngelis, though, the TikTok boys of Dumont \"shriveled and turned into little children\" when he confronted them.\n\nFor the sake of television — and Jersey's restaurant scene — here's hoping he's right."
