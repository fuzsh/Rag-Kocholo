It’s easy enough that he wants to read it to me too. I can feel his sincerity when he reads the words and pauses for me to say something. Such a wonderful idea that I haven’t found in any other book. Can’t wait to get home and get the guitar out like normal before bed and incorporate this book into our routine. Thank you to the author for sharing your passion to connect With my child.”\n\nTyler\n\n5-Star Amazon Review\n\n”Another beautiful, thoughtful book by Regina! After reading, \"Give A Little Snuggle\", I was thrilled to learn that another book was in the works. This book has children and adults alike eager to turn the pages and engage with the story. The illustrations are stunning, and it's lovely to have another \"tool\" in our kit to encourage family bonding!”\n\n5-Star Amazon Review\n\n“I love this book! It's beautiful, colorful, and has a wonderful message. My grandkids love it and we read it over and over.”\n\n5-Star Amazon Review\n\n”We love this book (and others) by this particular author. It’s well written, the pictures and colors are great. I know my kids love them too. I highly recommend over and over again.”\n\nCarlos\n\n5-Star Amazon Review"
