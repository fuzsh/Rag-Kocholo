        "text": "What is a celebrity? Someone who frequently appears in the tabloids and has millions of Twitter followers?\n\nPerhaps celebrities live up to that name because they are celebrated, meaning they are followed by journalists and pundits, they appear frequently on television, and they have fans. In comparison, someone is famous because they are well known within a particular community for some achievement.\n\nThe following is a look at 20 of Central Jersey’s biggest living celebrities and most famous people, many of whom still live in Union, Middlesex, Somerset and Hunterdon counties. Some were raised in one or more of those four counties or were born in Central Jersey and grew up elsewhere in the state.\n\nThey are presented by county and then alphabetically by name.
