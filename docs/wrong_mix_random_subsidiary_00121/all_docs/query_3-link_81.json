        "text": "Reading Rockets provides free resources about teaching children to read and helping kids who struggle. On this website, you’ll find a hundreds of articles on teaching reading, classroom strategies, in-classroom video, parent tips in multiple languages, video interviews with top children’s book authors, a daily news service, and more. We also have a robust community on Twitter (opens in a new window), Facebook (opens in a new window), and YouTube (opens in a new window).\n\nReading 101: A Guide to Teaching Reading and Writing — our self-paced course for pre-K to grade 3 teachers — presents the most vital information and strategies that teachers need to help students become skilled readers and writers.\n\nWe use the power of public TV to show how parents and educators can help children become better readers. Our Launching Young Readers series explores the stages of reading that every child goes through. Hosts like Fred Rogers, Henry Winkler, Vivica A. Fox, Reba McEntire, and Rita Moreno bring it all to life.\n\nThe project has been guided by an advisory panel made up of leading researchers and experts in the field of reading.\n\nDownload the Reading Rockets flyer ›\n\nOur mission\n\nThe National Institutes of Health estimates that one in five children has serious difficulties learning to read. These children are potentially among the most troubled kids in society. With early identification and a lot of help, however, children who struggle to read can flourish; without it they are at risk for failure in school and in life.\n\nTop 10 Things You Should Know About Reading\n\nSince 1965, the federal government has invested more than $100 million to find out why so many children have problems learning to read and what can be done. Thanks to that research, we now know how to identify children at risk and how to help them before they fail. Reading Rockets’ mission is to take that research-based and best-practice information and make it available to as many people as possible through the power and reach of television and the Internet.\n\nLaunched in 2001, Reading Rockets is an education initiative of WETA (opens in a new window), the flagship public television and radio station in the nation’s capital.\n\nTogether, we can help all children become strong, confident readers! Consider donating to Reading Rockets (opens in a new window) to help us to continue providing the best literacy resources for parents and educators.\n\nMore about Reading Rockets\n\nPartners\n\nAwards\n\nEditorial Calendar\n\nNoel Gunther\n\nNoel Gunther, executive director of WETA Learning Media and Reading Rockets, has overseen the project since its inception.
