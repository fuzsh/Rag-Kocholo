        "text": "Merrion Frances Partridge was born in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, on March 5, 1946. Her family moved to Africa when she was 6 months old. Both her parents were missionaries and went to Africa to do religious work. Her father was also the director of a teacher training school.\n\nAfter high school Mem went to drama school in London, England. She met Malcolm Fox there and in 1969 married him. After a short stay in Africa, the couple returned to England. Soon after they moved to Adelaide, South Australia.\n\nFox’s first picture book, Possum Magic, was published in 1983. Possum Magic is about a grandmother possum who uses magic to make her granddaughter, Hush, invisible. When Hush wants to become visible again, the two search for magic food across Australia. Fox wrote Possum Magic as an assignment while studying at Flinders University in Adelaide.\n\nIn addition to writing children’s books, Fox was a professor of literacy studies at Flinders University. She has also written for parents and teachers about reading and writing instruction."
