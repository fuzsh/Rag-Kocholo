        "text": "My Writing\n\nOne lazy Saturday afternoon, I went through all the old boxes of childhood memories we keep stored in the garage. Flipping through my wrinkled and yellowed school work, I was transported back to a time when I had bangs, collected Lisa Frank stickers, and wore bright mismatched colors. In those boxes I found stories I had written in elementary school, each with accompanying drawings. I discovered old newspaper articles I wrote for the middle school newspaper. I also found old copies of the newspaper I started at my Christian high school. Buried underneath it all, I found the plaque I won for a poem I wrote in a state fine arts competition. The more I dug through the past, the more I realized that I’ve always loved to express myself through words.\n\nWriting for me is partly a form of creative expression, partly the way I think and process things, and partly a way I serve the church. It's also one of the ways I praise and worship my Savior. I started blogging after my oldest son was born to share with family and friends across the country what was happening in our lives. I shared photos and anecdotes of his growth and development. Periodically I would share a reflection on motherhood or a few thoughts on what I was studying in Scripture or how the Spirit had convicted me of a sin. Readers responded to these posts and encouraged me to write more. I started sharing about my battle with postpartum depression, my fears as a mother, and how the gospel spoke to all areas of my daily life. More and more friends and readers urged me to send my work to other websites and publications and with great hesitation, I did so. Gradually, I became a regular contributor to various ministries and publications such as Desiring God, Revive Our Hearts, Tabletalk Magazine, and The Gospel Coalition, among others. (If you’d like to see some of the old articles I’ve written or find out more about my books, visit my writing page).\n\nWhat You’ll Find Here\n\nAs a writer, I often reflect here about the ways God is working in and through me. I share my thoughts, struggles, and reflections on living in this sin-stained world, the battles against my own sin, and above all, how much I need Jesus. Because the truth is, life isn’t easy. None of us has it all together. Our homes, children, marriages, and relationships aren’t always pretty. My goal here is to seek and savor the grace and mercy of Christ in the midst of all the sorrows, struggles, and challenges of life. I want to focus my heart on Christ, who he is, and what he has done. So you won’t find “how to” posts on ten steps to follow to make your life easier. You won’t find a list of solutions on how to have the best behaved kid on the block or how to make all your dreams come true. Rather, you will find posts on how what Jesus did for you in his life, death, and resurrection, changes everything in your life—from the inside out.\n\nPractically speaking, what you’ll find here are posts about applying the gospel to all things: friendships, marriage, parenting, emotions, ministry, and more. You’ll find book reviews on favorite gospel centered reads. You’ll also find devotional reflections on passages I’ve read, honest stories of my own struggles with sin, and God’s redemptive work in my life.\n\nIf you were to visit my home, I’d offer you a cup of coffee (only from the French Press!). Since you are visiting my online home, why don’t you grab a cup and stay awhile. And thanks for visiting!\n\nBecause of Grace,\n\nChristina"
