        "text": "Over a span of thirty years, her books have been part of every home and bedtime story generation. She created a world of magic, fun and adventure in the imaginative world of every child. Starting from her first book, POSSUM MAGIC to her latest release THE TINY STAR, she has surprised the literary world with her creativity in writing Children’s book. As dedicated by Penguin publication, she is Australia’s number one picture book author and also infectious storyteller of reading aloud to children, none other than MEM FOX.\n\nMore than half of her book has been the bestseller and every child in Australia knows the story of ‘Possum Magic’.\n\nWas it that easy for the author to reach such heights in her life? Let’s find out.\n\nMem Fox was born in 1946, in Melbourne Australia. She was born to a family where her grandmother and mother graduated from the same university, Sydney University. She admits that it was a blessing for her to be born in a family were back in the days, women were graduating from reputed universities. However, she did not spend much time in Australia. She moved to Africa at the age of six as her parents were missionaries. Her first introduction to writing was to drawing letters in the red earth with her hand and then on the slates.\n\nImagine for a second, how our worlds so different to hers?\n\nThe author was very much closed to her African friends but back in the time, English people being friends with Africans was against the law. Hence, she moved to an English school where she was teased for her Africa English accent. This was the first incident that she felt as a child which she tried to incorporate in her book, ‘I AM AN IMMIGRANT TOO’.\n\nThe author did a lot of drama and public speaking during her school and college time which she gives the credit to her mother. And in her blog, she mentioned that ‘it is a valuable asset which has reformed my process of writing’.\n\nBut what inspired her to write children’s book and not an adult story?\n\nAuthor’s daughter, Chloe was born in the year 1971 and by this time she had moved to Australia and settled in Adelaide with her family at her grandfather’s house. Chloe was an avid reader and she loved listening to her mother reading stories. She couldn’t cope up with Chloe about her passion for books. After looking for many books and stories, she realized there was very little that has been written especially for children. So, at the middle age, Mem Fox joined Flinders University to study Children literature.\n\nWhat is the journey of Possum Magic?\n\nShe met the guru of Children book of that time, Felicity Hughes who asked Mem to writer her first assignment of children book.\n\nMem Fox reacted that, ‘it was challenging and difficult to write for children. Without Flinders University and Felicity Hughes, it would not have been possible’.\n\nA very little-known fact that before Possum Magic, the author wrote a four-and-a-half-page story named as, ‘HUSH THE INVISIBLE MOUSE’ which was fascinating for her professor at the University. And she encouraged Mem Fox to write further and publish it. She wrote and made it into a book by submitting to 10 publishers. It was rejected nine times over five years. The author replied in an interview to Adventure baby, ‘it was extraordinarily discouraging. I understand for many struggling authors what they go through but believe that there will be one person that loves your story. I had my husband and librarians who encouraged me with their love’.\n\nThe book was finally considered by Omnibus books but was asked to change the tone of the book and use lovable Australian animals instead of a mouse. That’s how the name Possum Magic came into the picture. And it was sold over 5 million copies.\n\nWriting is her passion and writing for Children is her inspiration. She feels the best and contented when she writes for a child. She believes that a Child’s future depends on us and how we shape it. What can be better than stories and picture books to give them wings to fly and imagine a world that one day they can build by themselves. ‘If a child’s heart is not changed from the first page to the last page then the book won’t grab them’.\n\nHer advice to aspiring children book’s authors, ‘become familiar with the nature of rhythm by reading aloud and write from your heart to hear a child say I really love your books, Mem Fox’."
