        "text": "MEM FOX is a household name in Australia and a favourite author of anyone with little ones in their life. Her books have entertained and comforted six generations – from the Baby Boomers who originally read Possum Magic to their Generation-Xers when it was first published in 1983, through to the Millennials, then Gen-Z, and now Generation Alpha, born after 2010.\n\nIn her 40-year publishing career Mem has written 50 children’s books and more than half-a-dozen non-fiction books for adults, including Reading Magic. Her books have sold millions of copies, won multiple awards and are still regularly featured in Top Ten Australian picture book bestseller lists.\n\nCritically and popularly acclaimed for their rhythm, rhyme, and often humour, Mem’s books feature great artwork by talented local and international illustrators including Kerry Argent, Terry Denton, Judy Horacek, Pamela Lofts, Helen Oxenbury and Julie Vivas.\n\nMem’s books are sought after gifts for newborns (even thrust into the hands of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle by a Mem Fox fan), and perennial storytime favourites in pre-schools, libraries and at other events (even read by Ellen DeGeneres's mother as part of Easter at the White House).\n\nMem has also taught literacy studies for 24 years and is globally renowned as a fierce proponent of the myriad benefits of reading books aloud to children – as enthusiastically and often as possible – to help them develop the key foundations of early literacy and foster a lifelong love of reading. Mem has travelled the world speaking to educators, teachers, librarians, policy makers, politicians, parents and caregivers about the social and economic importance of early childhood literacy.\n\nAmong her numerous accolades, Mem has been made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for services to children’s literature. She has also been awarded a Centenary Medal, the prestigious Dromkeen Medal, and three honorary doctorates.\n\nMem’s passion for telling entertaining stories continues, and in 2023 her 50th children’s picture book, Our Dragon illustrated by Linda Davick, will be published by Penguin Australia.\n\nMem lives in Adelaide where she can occasionally be seen in her favourite bookshop or walking on the beach, reciting aloud new lines for her next bestselling picture book."
