        "text": "26 Jul 2016 / Comments ( 8 )\n\nKaranpal Singh\n\nKya baat a sir ji .. jio !!\n\nBobby Sing\n\nGlad that you enjoyed the articles Karanpal.\n\nKeep visiting and writing in,\n\nCheers!\n\nJai Shah\n\nWaheeda Rehman\\'s roles in JYOTI BANE JWALA & JWALAMUKHI were the same. Both films released in 1980; both had the same theme. Vinod Mehra played her second son in both films. Jeetendra who produced the former film actually sabotaged Prakash Mehra\\'s latter film by making a quickie on the same subject & took the same actors.\n\nBobby Sing\n\nThanks a lot Jai Shah for a new probable entry.\n\nI will surely look into both as in another mail too I have received the info that there was indeed a controversy between these films in the years of their making.\n\nCheers!\n\nKennyG\n\nI have a few actors doing similar roles.\n\n1.Dharmendra playing a CID/Under cover officer in3 movies:\n\nAankhen(1968), Charas (1976) and Shalimar.\n\n2.Sunny Deol playing similar role of Police Officer who is Suspended.\n\nTridev and Viswatma. Both were directed by Rajiv Rai.\n\nVardi\n\nIndian and Maa Tujhe Salaam(Patriotic with a similar theme)\n\n3.Pran playing Informer/Eye Witness who helps the Hero in the Clilmax.\n\nMajboor, Don And Dostana.\n\nall three movies had Amitabh Bachchan as the hero and 2 had Zeenat Aman as the heroine.\n\n4.Raaj Kumar playing Mentor/Guardian in 2 movies\n\nMarte Dam Tak and Jungbaaz. Both movies he mentored Govinda.\n\n5.Rajesh Khanna playing similar roles of Old man whose children leave the parents.\n\nAvtaar and Amrit\n\n6.Jeetendra played similar roles in movies produced by South Indian Movies industry primarily family oriented movies. Can\\'t name all.\n\n7.Amitabh Bachchan acted in 2 movies both directed by Yash Chopra.\n\nKabhi Kabhie and Silsila. Both movies he plays similar role. Poet in KK and Writer in Silsila. Both movies he does not get the heroine and she marries someone else.\n\n8.Dilip Kumar- Dil Diya Dard Liya and Ram aur Shyam. Sagina Mahto and Sagina.Dastaan and Bairaag.Duniya and Mashaal (released in same year).\n\n9.Randhir Kapoor-Raampur ka Lakshman,Ponga Pandit and Ram Bharose,\n\nJawani Diwani and Dil Diwana.\n\nI am sure I missed a few. Will write again.\n\nBobby Sing\n\nDear Kenny,\n\nThanks for your detailed comment, but you are actually thinking in two vague terms as many other mails I receive.\n\nSo please think and let me know keeping in mind the following points.\n\nFirstly please note that apart from JAADUGAR and TOOFAN, that were mainly quoted due to the controversy, this is not just looking for the general similarities of playing a cop or witness or poet or else. So we have to see more exact similarities in storyline and theme of the movie too to be included as SUPRISING examples.\n\nSecondly the article is not considering the same directors repeating the same character in their other films, as that again has a logical relation of being written/directed by the same mind. Here we are talking the cases when the same actor is doing almost identical roles in two different films made by two different directors. For instance majority Manoj Kumar films can be called patriotic but they are not similar.\n\nThirdly, Dharmendra, Mithun and to some extent Govinda too in 80s or 90s gave us the feeling of DEJA VU in too many films that have vague similarities but not exact. So please let me know about the EXACT if any.\n\nAnd lastly please keep in mind the LEAD ACTS only and not supporting cast as in our films the supporting cast is typecast in a usual manner like Iftekhar and Jagdish Raj almost same roles of a Police officer many times.\n\nSO as per the criteria, please see if you have any more films in mind as these cannot be included for the reasons mentioned above, with only one I need to check again ie DUNIYA and MASHAAL.\n\nTILL NOW the two new entries I have got are of :\n\nDev Anand's MAYA & ASLI NAKLI\n\nand\n\n80s JWALAMUKHI and JYOTI BANE JWALA.\n\nCheers!\n\nChris\n\nVery good article. Some points and more examples.\n\n1. Mahaan also had Amitabh playing a funny \\'nautankiwala\\' character which was similar to those 2 magician characters.\n\n2. Ajooba is also similar to Shahenshah. Isn\\'t it? Also the character and the backstory of Shahenshah/Vijay is blatantly like Batman!\n\n3. How did you miss the most hilarious example of Rishi Kapoor doing the same role in Daraar and Yaarana around the same time in the late 90s! Both remakes of \\'sleeping with the enemy\\'.\n\n4. Raj Babbar also did the same stalking the heroine which drives the plot in Yaarana and Itihaas. again in the late 90s.\n\n5. Rishi Kapoor also did eerily similar reincarnation movies in the late 80s - Janam Janam and Banjaran.\n\n6. Rishi Kapoor repeated his role from \\'Deewana\\' in a film called \\'Inteha pyar ki\\'. SRK was replaced by newcomer Imran Khan. Not exact but similar. You can also compare it to Daraar where the heroine has a past he doesn\\'t know about.\n\n7. Madhuri Dixit in a very similar love triangle in Saajan , Mohabbat and Aarzoo. Her lover fakes his own demise in the latter 2 films. Saajan and Aarzoo was by same director. not Mohabbat.\n\nDo confirm the similarities before writing them off.\n\nBobby Sing\n\nHi Chris,\n\nThanks for your kind appreciation and submissions too.\n\nThough they all not exactly fit into the format but I would soon update the article with many new additions and reference of Mahaan, Ajooba, Rishi Kapoor for sure.\n\nSo thanks a lot for writing in.\n\nKeep Visiting.\n\nCheers!\n\nLeave A Comment\n\nName\n\nE-mail (will not be published)\n\nWebsite (Optional)\n\n(www.example.com)\n\nMessage\n\nEnter shown code"
