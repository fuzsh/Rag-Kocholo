        "text": "Comedians are the source of laughter. They also make people cry. Comedy shows are therefore, so popular. Those doing comedy who do so much to bring out laughter do not get their due. Literature is the source of comedy. So are the films, shows, theatres made out them so popular. In literature, however, we refer to a story or drama as a comedy. When the main to characters come together beating all the sweat the particular story or drama is referred to as a comedy. When the hero and heroine do not come together at the end of the story or drama it called a tragedy. Shakespearean dramas which lived for centuries were either a comedy or tragedy. Generally we all like to see a comedy drama. Tragedy often brings tears to the eyes.\n\nIndian classics include both comedy and tragedy. While. `Pareeneta' written by Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay is comedy, `Devdas' popular with the cinema viewers is a tragedy. Comedy and tragedy here is meant differently.\n\nComedy is usually referred in ordinary parlance as actions or words as a source of laughter. One who performs a comedy is known as a comedian. A lady who engage themselves to source laughter is called a comedienne. Why I thought I should speak out on comedy is the death of Chinmoy Roy of Bengali Cinema. Roy is MA in English from Calcutta University. He chose to play comic roles in Bengali movies. For over four decades he entertained the viewers. He starred in cinema directed non other than Satyajit Ray ( Gopi Bain Bagha Bain) , Tapan Sinha ( `Akhoni'), Dinen Gupta ( `Banato Bilap'), Tarun Majumdar (` Ganodebota') and a host of others. As a comedian he played the role of a hero in the film on `Tenida' a character created by Narayan Gangopadhyay in his novel `Charmurti' in Bengali.Chinmoy also featured in the Hindi version of the film, `Sagina Mahato' which had a song sung by Saira Bano with him in the picturisation. All accepted that he always did justice to comedy. Chinmoy Roy never changed to other formats of acting. He considered Jahar Roy as his `Guru'. Chinmoy Roy will be remembered by all for his comic roles that rolled out our laughter from within. Bengali Cinema will miss him so will viewers of cinema. His roles made life different for all and are remebered though small even to-day. I remember him distinctly as an intellectual in the film, `Akhonee' ( Tapan Sinha directed).\n\nBengali has presented to the audience comedians of the stature of Tulsi Chakraborti, Bhanu Bandopadhyay, Jahar Roy, Robi Ghosh, Nabadwip Halder, Shyam Laha, Nriputi Chatterjee, Chinmoy Roy, Santosh Dutta amongst others. Anup Kumar the versatile actor did comic roles.The comedians were given small roles but their acting lingers in memory even to-day. `Mashima Mal Poa Khabo' is a dialogue that keeps Bhanu Bandopadhyay relevant even to-day. Bhanu Bandopadhyay the versatile comedian was a brilliant student who studied Science in Dacca. He was a freedom fighter who escaped from Dacca to Kolkata in `dicky' of a car during the British rule. Satyan Bose the famous scientist considered Bhanu Bandopadhyay as a brilliant student who could have persued an illustrious career in Science. I personally saw Jahar Roy was a voracious reader. Tulsi Chakraborty was never given his due. He was recognised by Satyajit Roy who gave him the lead role in `Parosh Pathor' the immortalised comedy. It is said that if he would have been born in UK then he would have been knighted. After his death his wife depended on alms of others . Actor Mithun Chakraborty of Mumbai came to the rescue. He supported her financially for some time. Those make us enjoy life through laughter are left to live to tears.\n\nComedians are given small roles to lighten seriousness in a story, drama or film. Comedians us words, action and other means to make people laugh. Comedy helps to release tension charged atmosphere. Jockers are made to lighten the show in a circus. `Jina Yaha, Marna Yeha.......' the song in `Mere Naam Joker' the film produced by Raj Kapoor show cases the tragic life of Jokers in circus. It is tragedy that those who make people laugh are those that lead sorrowful lives.\n\nComedians are considered character actors and are usually given small roles. Though small their performance lingers in the memory of the public. Stories, theatre, cinema are dependent on comedians for success but they are always kept in the sidelines. People do not give their to comedians. Every one is interested to become a hero but very few want to by comedians. But we cannot do without them. It is hard to forget a comedian. Lead character in a film might be forgotten but a moment of comedy is hardly forgotten. In my twilight years I keep seeing the films of Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy and the host of others.\n\nWhat I have realised from seeing comedy created by the stalwart comedians of the earlier times that comedy does not die. It continues. That is why my eyes remain glued to the films shown in U Tube of Laurel Hardy made in as early as 1915, more than a century old. Chinmoy Roy has passed away but the comedy he has left behind will continue lighten life of people.\n\nLong live comedy and comedians . Comedians should be given their due in society. They are no less than the film heroes. Their impact is even more."
