In each of these cases it is the fundamentally good man or woman who dies, a victim of cruel, unrelenting circumstances.”\n\nSince tragedy, fate, death are the leitmotif of many of his early films one might be forgiven for thinking that these words are about Dilip Kumar. But these trenchant lines by Khwaja Ahmed Abbas, dating from 1939, are actually about Paramthesh Chandra Barua, or Prince Barua, the founder of naturalism in Indian Cinema, and one of the stalwarts of the Calcutta based studio New Theatres. Why, you might wonder, begin a piece on Dilip Kumar with Barua. For many reasons. Barua belonged to New Theatre, the closest rival to Bombay Talkies, where Dilip Kumar began his career. Barua was the scion of a princely estate from Assam, who went abroad after studying at Presidency College and even briefly sat in the Assam assembly before drifting to films. It was he who first made Devdas a cinematic paradigm, with himself in the Bangla and Saigal in the Hindi version. He specialised in serious, even morbid films, and was a flamboyant, if eccentric man, who sometimes travelled with his pet Cheetah in an open jeep. He was a voracious reader and also a pessimist who despaired at the fate of his releases. Bimal Roy, who collaborated with Dilip Kumar on Devdas and two other highly successful films, was the cameraman for Barua’s Devdas, and an important member of Naya Theatre. Barua also represented a new ethos in Indian film making which reigned for about 15 years beginning in 1930 when the studios, especially the big three of Prabhat, New Theatres and Bombay Talkies, consciously worked hard to produce meaningful national cinema that could rival Hollywood. Without the demise of the studio system after the second world war, it would have been impossible for Dilip Kumar to emerge as a star, and without his stardom where would he be as a mere serious actor?\n\nAs the late theatre doyen Habib Tanvir, who acted opposite Dilip Kumar in Footpath, recalls in his memoirs, the studios each had their trademark style and orientation and their releases were eagerly anticipated. Working as self-contained production units the studios had writers, art directors, cameraman and editors on its payrolls who worked simultaneously on many films. Foreign technicians and actors abounded and cinema, aided by the newly founded Radio stations, came to dominate popular culture.\n\nOne can see glimpses of this widespread fascination for cinema of the 1930s in the works of Urdu writers such as Qurratul Ain Hyder and Intizar Husain who feature many characters who run away to Bombay to become film actors or because they have fallen hopelessly in love with a heroine. This was the decade too, of course, of the Progressives who heralded a new rebellion in literature, and of Indian People’s Theatre Association which ushered in a new aesthetics and orientation in theatre. Writers, poets, and singers were celebrities in their own right, and often, crucially, no less than film actors. The world was changing, what the true intellectual-artists now demanded was more than freedom, they wanted a new order and they commanded huge audiences.\n\nThese new Indian audiences, for literature, cinema, radio and politics, had been made possible by the phenomenal upsurge in higher education and in urbanization in the first three decades of the 20th century. Bombay was already overcrowded and fast. One encounters this pulsating, teeming Bombay in the writings of Sa’adat Hasan Manto, another Bombay Talkies man, who celebrated the city and its multifarious characters. The Radio station in Bombay, one of Manto’s favorite haunts, under Zulfikar Shah Bukhari, himself a writer and performer of no mean talent, competed with films for national attention. Habib Tanvir, who lived in Bukhari’s house, and worked in the Radio, while doing other jobs, brings this Bombay truly alive in his memoirs too. Habib Tanvir was to name his theatre group Naya Theatre, in homage to the Calcutta studio. There were of course, then and now, many Bombay, but it was the most exciting city in India, at the best of times.\n\nHimanshu Rai, the founder of Bombay Talkies, who hailed from an aristocratic Bengali family was training to be a barrister in London, before he was drawn to filmmaking. Light of Asia, his filmic adaptation of Edwin Arnold’s famous poem on the Budhha had created a sensation when it was released in 1925, and had enjoyed a rapturous premiere in Weimar Germany. It was followed by Shiraz and The Throw of the Dice, all of which he made in collaboration with the German director Franz Osten. Rai fell in love with Devika Rani, herself the daughter of the Surgeon General of Madras and the grand-niece of Rabindra Nath Tagore, and together with Osten they formed Bombay Talkies to produce, to use an anachronism, ‘world class films.’ Their first talkie Karma featured a four minute kissing scene between Rai and Devika Rani. They organised their studio on highly professional lines where posts were advertised in newspapers, salaries were paid according to grades, where everybody ate from a common canteen but paid according to means, and where call sheets, bound scripts, and ‘ideation’ were the norm. Everyone connected with a particular film was given the script and call sheet which listed all the shots for the day, including costumes, props and artistes for the day. They had a large library containing 5000 books. Foreign technicians and actors were omnipresent, but Calcutta and Lahore competed with Bombay as filmmaking centres.\n\nThe most popular actor of Bombay Talkies was Ashok Kumar who began his stint as a lab assistant. He got his acting break because Devika Rani eloped with Najmul Hasan, an actor from a noble Lucknow family while filming Jeevan Naiyya, after she had done a film with him called Jawani Ki Hawa in which a woman elopes with her lover on the day of her marriage, causing a murder on a train. Sashadhar Mukherjee, Rai’s trusted lieutenant, traced the couple to Grant Hotel Calcutta and persuaded Devika Rani to return to her husband. Najmul Hasan was sacked and Shashadhar, who became known to posterity as the famous director S. Mukherjee, helped his brother in law Ashok Kumar land the leading role. Ashok Kumar and Devika Rani became a hit pair and their Achhut Kanya, about an untouchable girl and her plight was one of the greatest hits of the decade.\n\nBombay Talkies was famous for the high technical quality of its films since many of its technicians were either German or trained there, including under Fritz Lang. It specialised in producing urban dramas. New Theatres on the other hand preferred musicals, or films based on literary works. It was founded by B. N. Sirkar, the son of an the Advocate General of Bengal who had studied engineering in London and got into filmmaking after he was asked to build a theatre upon his return, which, incidentally, was inaugurated by Subhash Chandra Bose. His studio produced over a 150 films but he kept himself out of the everyday tasks of production, even out of the credits, and preferred to give his directors a free hand. The works of Tagore and Saratchandra Chatterjee inspired many of their early films. Devaki Bose, Nitin Bose, Barua, Pahari Sanyal, Kidar Sharma and other directors initiated a Bengali school of naturalism in Indian cinema, one which had a deep influence on Dilip Kumar’s career. Nitin Bose, Bimal Roy, Amiya Chakravarti, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Ritwik Ghatak, who majorly determined his career were all Bengalis and most had some affiliation with New Theatres. Kedar Sharma, one of Raj Kapur’s teachers and an outstanding poet-writer-director of the early talkie era has left wonderful descriptions of New Theatre in his memoir, and of its legendary directors such as Devki Bose. Sharma describes Devki Bose as a philosopher and a highly well read man. New Theatre’s singing stars such as Saigal, Pankaj Mullick, Pahari Sanyal and Kanan Devi were sensations. They were, of course, following on the heels of such established singing theatre stars as Jahan Ara Kajjan, Master Nisar, and Mahjabeen, pan-India stars who were important enough socially to be members of the Calcutta club. Again, Hyder has vividly drawn this world in her fiction.\n\nThe third big studio of the time was the Pune based Prabhat, where Dev Anand and Guru Dutt began their careers, which specialised in films with social causes. It was possible still to come from nowhere and rise up the ladder of success, as Mehboob Khan, who started as a projection boy, did. The arrival of the talkies had inveigled most successful theatre writers and actors to swiftly transition to film. The talkies also put a premium on dialogues, and thus on diction, which cemented the pre-eminence of Urdu, a lingua franca which also carried association of refinement. Once play back was invented actors only needed to speak well, and Parsi theatre actors such as Sohrab Modi spoke outstandingly and boomingly well. Soon enough, Urdu poets and writers began to dominate the industry. We must remember that among the four questions that Devika Rani supposedly asked the young Yusuf Khan at their first encounter the third was, ‘do you speak Urdu?’ One is naturally correct in presuming that this conversation, like many in the film circles then and now, took place in English.\n\nHimanshu Rai’s death in 1940 coincided with the onset of the Second world war which fundamentally altered the world of Indian films. Censorship became much more strict, raw stock became expensive due to the curb on imports and filmmaking became expensive. Ashok Kumar, S. Mukherjee and others left Bombay Talkies to launch their own studio Filmistan. They returned to the helm after Devika Rani’s retirement but by then the studios were disintegrating. The war created millionaires overnight, many of whom wanted to invest in films. In their classic study Indian Films, published in 1962, Barnow and Krishnaswamy vividly capture the transition of cinema after the War.\n\nHundreds of new producers arrived on the scene, film production came to be seen as a route to make a quick buck, and a star system was born. Leading men, and women, were no longer contract bound with particular studios, and since they were the one stable brand in a fast changing market, they began to charge a premium on their appearance, and worked in several projects at the same time. The partition of India in 1947 produced another transformation, not only because of the exodus of talent but also because Lahore and Calcutta declined as film production centres. All the talent from Naya Theatre and even Prabhat moved to Bombay.\n\nNot just Guru Dutt and Dev Anand from Pune, but also Prithviraj Kapur and Bimal Roy from Calcutta, and hundreds of others. Henceforth, one would have to move to Bombay to make it in cinema. Even Barua, who hated Bombay because he thought it was a ‘bloody bazar’ was forced to move there, where he died by alcoholism and suicide in 1948.\n\nBefore he came to meet Devika Rani Yusuf Khan already had a few feathers in his cap, mostly via his sporting achievements. Sikh taxi drivers sometimes came to cheer their favorite Lalle, as he showed his prowess in the football team for the Khalsa college. His football coach in Anjuman Islamia school Syed Ghiasuddin, who went on to achieve national eminence as a coach, predicted a great future for him as a footballer. It was his passion for the game, which he always described as his first love, that made Yusuf shift from Wilson College, where the Anglo-Indians didn’t allow him to play in the team, to Khalsa. His friend Raj would sometimes land up there in a car with girls but Yusuf was too shy to enjoy their company. He had fought with his fruit seller father and moved to Pune, where he became highly popular with British officers and their wives, as the Chico in the army canteen, and had saved enough to return to Bombay with honor. He was already a charmer. His elder brother Ayub Khan, the reader and intellectual in the family had instilled in him the love of books, especially literature. Ayub was sometimes called to lecture and debate, even on the Quran which he was deeply familiar with.\n\nHis father Sarwar Khan, as we know, had moved his family from Peshawar, at around the same time as the theatre director Ebrahim Alkazi’s family was moving from Calcutta to Pune. Almost exactly when Dilip Kumar made his debut Akbar Padamsee was creating a sensation, and shockwaves, with his groundbreaking theatre productions in South Bombay, while IPTA was revolutionising theatre by performing at factories and street corners. But young Yusuf was not so au courant then. What he had was earnestness, deference and sophistication.\n\nAs is well known, his father was good friends with Bishesharnath Kapur, Prithviraj’s father, whom he sometimes ribbed for allowing his son to work in the film line which he looked down upon. The story goes that Bishesharnath took his revenge when Shabnam came out by pointing out Yusuf’s face to Sarwar on the giant, handmade, billboard outside Crawford market where his shop lay. Sarwar did not see any of Yusuf’s films, or any films for that matter for many years until he came to see Mela.\n\nAfterwards when Yusuf reached home he found his Uncle and his father were very agitated. His father bade him sit down next to him and told him that if you love that girl so much then please marry her, I will support you, but don’t kill yourself over her. He was referring to Nargis, Yusuf’s beloved in the film!\n\nAt Bombay Talkies, Yusuf came into contact with many luminaries. Ashok Kumar and Nitin Bose, were there of course, but also Manto, Ismat Chughtai, Shahid Lateef, Kamal Amrohvi, Shyam, Raja Mehdi Ali Khan and others. Manto, who reminisced his Bombay Talkies days movingly did not mention Dilip Kumar even once, presumably because he was not yet prominent enough, although in his autobiography Yusuf claims that Manto used to visit his house. Manto has also described the kind of intense story sessions and narrations that would take place before a story was finalised. Once that was done there would be everyday discussions about production, shot taking, design, dialogues and music. Yusuf sat through many of these discussions and quickly understood that filmmaking involved teamwork and one had to be familiar with all aspects of it to make an impact. Yusuf was a keen learner, and spoke English and Urdu well. At Bombay Talkies he quickly learnt Bengali. In time he would learn to speak fluent Marathi, Gujarati, Parsi Gujarati, a smattering of Tamil and Telugu, some French, apart from Pashto, Persian, and Punjabi which he knew from before. Play back singing and orchestral background music was just beginning to take shape as musicians such as Anil Biswas, Salil Chaudhury and Naushad, drew upon the melange that Parsi theatre had already created. But almost everybody that Yusuf Khan interacted with was either highly well versed with Urdu literature (K Asif, Naushad), or was highly educated (Devika Rani) or represented the more suave tradition of filmmaking (Nitin Bose, Ashok Kumar). Ashok Kumar, the leading star of the era had already introduced a newer style of acting, and alongside Moti Lal and Pahari Sanyal, he now provided a road off the beaten path which new actors could tread. It was this road that Yusuf Khan was more suited to take, given his temperament and aptitude.\n\nYusuf went to Devika Rani for a job, not for acting. Even after he began acting he wasn’t sure of his profession and had applied for a license to run a railway stall. One can hardly think of any other great actor who so unintentionally walked into films, which even then was the dream of thousands. He had the gab, and the gift of the gab, but it was destiny which turned him into an Actor, to begin with. He brought it to dedication and hard work. Presumably, it was this which allowed him to learn the medium so quickly. He began to take his work and his performance seriously. Since he had no theatre experience before, camera was his first and natural stage and therefore he perhaps understood its significance and subtleties better than most. He understood that he didn’t need to speak loudly, or gesticulate, or even to face the camera. He could say important lines with his back to the camera. And he could keep silent or use a pause. This was taught to him by Nitin Bose, which the latter had presumably picked up from his training at Naya Theatre.\n\nWhen Yusuf was shooting Milan with Nitin Bose, based on a Tagore short story Nauka Doobi, there was a scene where he had to carry his mother’s ashes for immersion into the Ganga at Banaras. Nitin Bose asked him some probing questions about the character’s inner world. As he recounts in his autobiography,\n\n“I told Nitinda frankly that I had not thought so deeply because such depth was not in the script. Nitinda of course understood but he gave me a valuable lesson that has stood me in good stead. He made me write four to five pages expressing my feelings as Ramesh during the journey. I sat up half the night and wrote and rewrote until I was overcome by sleep. The next day the scene was to be shot at a location in Ghodbunder in Bombay. When the camera started to roll I was into the scene emotionally and the experience was satisfying for me and Nitinda.”\n\nMilan was Yusuf’s first big hit, before which he faced some decided insults. The acerbic film critic of that time Babu Rao Patel, who comes alive in Manto’s remembrance, was also Habib Tanvir’s boss for a short while. Tanvir says he used to keep a knife in his drawer to intimidate the film people whom he regularly alienated with his reviews.\n\nBabu Rao Patel had this to say about Yusuf’s debut in Jwar Bhata :\n\n“Dilip Kumar the new hero of the Bombay Talkies is an anaemic addition to our film artistes. He needs to lot of vitamins and a prolonged treatment of proteins before another picture can be risked with him. He looks gaunt and famished and strikes one as a long ill-treated convict who has escaped from a jail. His appearance on the screen creates both laughter and disappointment. His acting effort in this picture amounts to nil.”\n\nWith time though, Baburao Patel came to be more positive. Here is his review of Shaheed,\n\n“So far as acting is concerned, Dilip Kumar steals the picture with his deeply felt and yet perfectly natural delineation of the main role. Sensitivity and intelligent under-statement are the outstanding characteristics of his acting. Kamini Kaushal is somewhat overshadowed by Dilip and while giving a fairly balanced performance, fails to rise to any histrionic heights. But the two of them act some of the most tender, most intimate and most moving love scenes that have ever been seen on the Indian screen.”\n\nThe hard to please Baburao Patel could cavil with Yusuf’s preferred political party even when praising his film as he did in his review of Daag:\n\n“Daag is the story of a drunkard, a story which should make power drunk Congress rulers dance with joy. Though the producer does not directly seek to justify prohibition by the state, he has portrayed the deleterious effects of alcoholism so vividly that Daag automatically provides an argument for prohibition.”\n\nYusuf signed Mela after he heard a song by Mukesh. But already, within four years of his debut he had begun to take an overweening interest in the stories in which he acted. As he recounts about Mela,\n\n“The storyline of Mela was a sketchy one and, having had the good fortune of getting involved in stimulating discussions with such thought-provoking writers as Bhagwaticharan Verma, Narendra Sharma, Gyan Mukherjee and Nabendu Ghosh, I was able to sense the absence of meat in it for the actors and I felt it had to be brought to the director’s attention at the very outset. He agreed with me, which was very good not only for me but for the other artistes as well. We had some healthy brainstorming sessions, which helped us to add depth and intensity to the story besides logic. We also managed to give the characters more emotional sensitivity and depth.”\n\nThereafter there was no film he did in which he did not first work on the script, sometimes for months.\n\nYash Chopra recalls how Yusuf Saheb spent two months working on the script of Naya Daur, in his favored Juhu shack. He would enact scenes, coin dialogues, improvise and elaborate on a given structure. When Manoj Kumar narrated the idea of Kranti to him, which became the biggest hit of 1980, all he said was that zameen zarkhez hai i.e. the land is fertile, and then worked on the story for months. He was also keenly involved with other technical aspects of filmmaking.\n\nWhile shooting Mehboob Khan’s Aan, a film in technicolor, he first suggested to the cameraman Faridoon Irani to shoot the entire film on 16 mm and have it blown up to 25 mm, the standard size of the film. It required some daring to shoot a big budget film on what was then becoming an obsolete camera, but they managed to pull it off eliciting much praise from the technicians at the London studio where it was developed. While shooting the train and horse chase sequence in Ganga Jamna, an obvious precursor to Sholay (also Deewar and Lagan) he made the cameraman tie the camera to the floor of the train and had the cameraman tied up in straps to ensure the shot was executed as he wanted it.\n\nHe had worked out the speed of the train, of the horses and the lay of the terrain in complicated diagrams. Dev Anand recalled that when they were doing Insaniyat, the only film they did together, Dilip Kumar would reach Madras a week before schedule to work on costumes, set design, props, curtains et al. He was a total filmmaker in that sense: every film that he acted in, except for a handful of ventures such as Mughal-e Azam, were his films as much as they were the Director’s. One can question his choice of films, but never his commitment to them, nor his absorption. He always remained honest to his work.\n\nShaheed: ‘Dilip Kumar is perfectly at ease as the rebel hero and should go far if he keeps up his good work. He has a great screen future before him. He has learnt much since his gauche appearance in Milan.’ (14,15 August 1948)\n\nJugnu: ‘Dilip Kumar improves with every picture. He plays his role with an unconscious art which creates an impression of naturalness that is great acting.’ (16 October 1948)\n\nMela: ‘Dilip Kumar puts over a really fine performance, natural as he is permitted to be in a role so greatly misconceived, Dilip Kumar is convincingly realistic as the country lad. He should counter the tendency to keep his mouth half open. With his facial configuration, it gives him an adenoidal look which sits ill in heroes. And for a word of personal advice, he should resist all directorial blandishment in future and decline to commit suicide for all the tea in China— for some time at any rate.’ (23 October 1948).\n\nNadiya Ke Paar: ‘Dilip Kumar as the young zamindar’s brother meanders casually through a role which has no meat for an actor of his calibre.’ (25 December 1948)\n\nGhar Ki Izzat: ‘Dilip, who gets better with each performance, acts more naturally as the hero, and is completely convincing.’ (5 February 1949)\n\nAndaz: ‘Dilip Kumar runs away with acting honours in the central role, which he portrays with an inimitable grace of which his entire naturalness and spontaneity are the chief ingredients. He does not act but lives the role, displaying the rare genius of the born actor, who is unaware that he is acting. He will go far, this young man if he retains this priceless gift of spontaneity which characterizes him today.’ (26 March 1948)\n\nShabnam: ‘Dilip who is just good in the first half, sharing honours with Kamini, falls away hopelessly in the latter portion, giving a performance that is tame and as unrecognizable as he is himself in his painted gypsy face and strange attire.’ (30 July 1949)\n\nArzoo: ‘Dilip proves an excellent foil rather than a teammate for (Kamini Kaushal) for with all his naturalness, his greatest asset, which he brings to the role, his studied, typed mannerisms rob his performance of all freshness and spontaneity, even in the earlier village sequence. He is getting to dramatize himself too much and he does it too consciously. He is more himself than the hero of this film.’ (11 February 1950)\n\nJogan: ‘Nargis who appears here in a role utterly different from anything she has done before, gives a wonderful performance which marks her (as a) dramatic actress of the highest merit. The same goes for Dilip Kumar, who, also in a different role than any of his before, acts with a true sympathy and a dignity which lifts the character to a high level of the heroine and the story.’ (6 May 1950)\n\nBabul: ‘Dilip Kumar also acts extremely well as the Dak Babu, kindly, honest, blunt and dignified even in moments of his keenest pain and sorrow. He has shed most of his irritating mannerisms, and if he would only enunciate clearly—a primary consideration in any actor—he would be near perfect.’ (14 October 1950)\n\nHulchul: ‘Dilip Kumar, despite touches of stolidity, gives a remarkably good performance which is deeply stirring in its expression of pathos, grief, gratitude and despair.’ (17 February 1951)\n\nAmong these early films Jogan, Milan and Andaz stood out for different reasons.\n\nAndaz was a bold love triangle which dared to probe the complex feelings of a man who first feels encouraged and is then rudely crushed in love. By the time he came to make it Mehboob Khan was already one of India’s leading directors and that he could afford to take risks is reflected in the three different kinds of films that he did with Dilip Kumar. Andaz, Aan and Amar were all written by his trusted writer S. Ali Raza, who went on to marry Nimmi, and who also wrote Mother India for him. Dilip Kumar’s performance in Andaz is magnificent, and the tightly edited film remains watchable because it is a taut and relatable drama. The film is all Dilip Kumar as Raj Kapur only makes an appearance close to the interval, and the film focuses on Dilip Kumar’s transition from a breezy suitor to a dark and jilted lover.\n\nWhen he next cast Dilip Kumar in his action adventure Aan the distributors apparently laughed in his face saying ‘Mehboob Khan pagal ho gaya hai, tragedy king ke hath mein talwar pakra di! Mehboob Khan has gone mad handing a sword to the tragedy king.’\n\nBut Mehboob Khan, as Dilip Kumar recalls, loved to take bold, unconventional decisions and then, once he had proved his critics wrong, strut about in his glory. He was very keen to cast Dilip Kumar as Nargis’s son in Mother India, but the latter put his foot down on that. Post Mother India’s outstanding success Mehboob Khan made Son of India with his adopted son Sajid, who was born in a Bombay slum but was adopted by Mehboob Khan and his wife Sardar Akhtar after he acted as the young Birju in Mother India. The film was a huge flop but gave us the evergreen patriotic number called Nanha Munna Rahi Hoon.\n\nBut Mehboob Khan was also not one to shy away from admitting his mistake. When B. R. Chopra narrated Naya Daur to him he dismissed it by saying that it was a weak subject and that Dilip Kumar will be wasted in it. When the film turned out to be a super hit B. R. Chopra invited him as the chief guest for the 100th day celebration party and Mehboob Khan admitted his mistake from the stage. Mehboob Khan died in debt, a fact which haunted Dilip Kumar for long. He often brought this fact up to illustrate his need for always securing himself financially, and also perhaps to explain why he didn’t do more off beat or experimental films. Another fact which deeply troubled him was the financial bankruptcy that Bimal Roy faced when he was dying, where even his house had to be sold off. However, the studio that Mehboob Khan built, in Bandra, a stone’s throw away from Salman Khan’s house, still thrives, a rare instance in Bombay of a legacy surviving a legend’s time.\n\nMany regard Dilip Kumar’s performance in Jogan as one of his finest simply because he had so little to do in the film. The film revolved around Nargis, who plays the central character of a female ascetic. He had few dialogues and there was little action in the film. Kidar Sharma narrates an interesting story about how it got to be made. He was working then with Seth Chandulal Shah of Ranjit Movietone, one of the bigger studios which had survived the War.\n\nThe studio employed over 300 people, produced nearly six films a year, and Chandulal Shah was legion for his fleet of cars, his eccentricities and his wealth. Sethji, as he was called, was regarded as the grand old man of the industry, and was instrumental in organising the Silver Jubilee and Golden Jubilee celebrations of Indian cinema and was the first President of the Producer’s Federation of India. But by the end, in the 1970s he was so broke, and unemployed, that he had to travel in buses.\n\nKidar Sharma says that one day, he was sitting with the Seth and his paramour Gauhar Jaan, whom Sharma describes as a keen and ready wit who once said, “Kidar, you have Tarzan eyes that jump from limb to limb”, after pack up. Nitin Bose was also present there, when Shah narrated an idea that had been germinating in his mind about a woman who has taken sannyas and an atheist who falls madly in love with her. But Seth wasn’t able to complete the story. He was unable to complete the story.\n\nAt this point Kidar Sharma apparently said ‘huzoor beera utha lun,’ an old phrase which indicates a situation where a person picks up a roll of pan to indicate his/her willingness to undertake a trying job. Kidar Sharma was not an unknown name but reportedly Nitin Bose quipped that ‘fools rush in where angels fear to tread.‘ Kidar Sharma went on to take up the challenge. Panditji, as Sharma was popularly called, had written the dialogues and songs for the original Barua helmed Hindi Devdas, all in the purabia dialect. They remained such a benchmark that when the famous Urdu writer Rajinder Singh Bedi came to write the dialogues for Bimal Roy’s Devdas he was forced to turn to Panditji for help, even borrowing some of his dialogues from the original Devdas. Kidar Sharma’s Jogan was lyrically shot, with little dialogue and a lot of silent emoting and Dilip Kumar was able to immerse himself into a difficult role. The sexually charged tension between two chaste lovers who can never meet or be together left a deep impact on the audiences. By the standards of the time it was an experimental film, but it did well. It was a testament to Dilip Kumar’s ability bring out the psychological interiority of a character with expressions and body language, without using dialogues or gestures, and his confidence in using silences to reinforce his eloquence.\n\nBy the time he was 28, Dilip Kumar had already done 16 films, most of which were hits. This was an outstanding achievement from a man who was uncertain about his career plans and had hardly watched any Indian films before he became an actor. Even the few Hollywood films he had seen were adventure capers which he had caught in the Army cantonment cinema at Deolali. His family had shifted to this small hill station once his brother Ayub became bedridden and to help his mother with her asthma. Later he tried to make up for it by watching as many Hollywood films as he could and sometimes watched consecutive shows of a film if he liked it, analysing its shots, editing, performances, dialogues. He once watched Ingrid Bergman’s For Whom The Bell Tolls for seven days, all three shows, in a row. In time he was able to discern a genuine performer from a star. His idols were Paul Muni and Charles Laughton and Spenser Tracy, whom he tried to emulate. He distinguished them from the stars of his time and maintained that,\n\n“There are people who have their own individual personality, and they project that. Even great stars like Gregory peck and Cary Grant projected their own personality and capitalized on it. But they cannot be compared with men like Spencer Tracy, Paul Muni or Charles Laughton. They were great actors – and none of us in this country is anywhere near that caliber.”\n\nHe admired how Paul Muni and Laughton allowed their character to take primacy over their personality and how they got into character. He was able to do the same thing in his films, at least up to a certain point in his career. There were no acting institutes when he began his career, no drama schools, no professional teachers so one had to learn on the job, from one’s peers and from Hollywood, and there were few peers then to learn from. Ashok Kumar, another accidental actor-star, was ‘natural’ as was Motilal, but neither of them were ‘real’ in the sense of preparing for and getting into a role in the way that modern actors do it. Dilip Kumar was already preparing for his roles, by looking for real life models–closely studying a blind beggar for his role in Deedar, for instance– as well as by reaching deep within himself to bring out the right emotion, and to perform it subtly. By all accounts, he was emotional and sensitive, as well as an introvert, shy with women, personality traits which must have aided his emotionally intense performances. He was already becoming a method actor, even before the term came to dominate film acting.\n\nMethod acting, a term invented by the Russian director Konstantin Stanislavsky exhorted actors to mine emotions from experiences in their own life, but it is unlikely that Dilip Kumar would have known of him then. Its most famous modern adherent was Lee Strasberg who insisted on actors internalizing the process of acting. Strasberg stressed that in order to develop an emotional and cognitive understanding of their roles, actors should use techniques to reproduce the character’s emotional state by recalling emotions or sensations from the actor’s own life. Dustin Hoffman, AL Pacino, Harvey Keitel, the list of actor-stars produced by Strasberg, or influenced by Method Acting, is legion. Dilip Kumar has gone on record to express his deep admiration for the work of modern day greats as Hoffman, Pacino and De Niro, but he classed them differently from himself. I will come to that later. The point here is that he was anticipating and executing modern methods of acting without having any coach or instructor. His instinct and seriousness of intent was leading him in the direction of creating a method of his own, one which resembled practices much more modern than him.\n\nThe most famous rebuttal to method acting, however, came from Sir Lawrence Olivier, the great Shakespearean actor who certainly knew how to play it. This famous story involves Dustin Hoffman’s collaboration with Laurence Olivier on the 1976 film Marathon Man. Upon being asked by Sir Lawrence how a previous scene had gone, one in which Hoffmann’s character had supposedly stayed up for three days, Hoffmann admitted that he too had not slept for 72 hours to achieve emotional verisimilitude. “My dear boy,” replied Olivier smoothly, “why don’t you just try acting?”\n\nHowever, the last word on the subject belongs to the famous American performer and actor George Burns who once said that “Sincerity is everything,” and then added, “Fake that, and you’ve got it made.”\n\nDilip Kumar didn’t need to fake his sincerity because he was always sincere, even sometimes when he did ridiculous roles such as in Kranti or Dharma Adhikari late in his career. But it is possible to be both real, and natural and to produce that effect without too much method. Balraj Sahni in India was one such actor. He could dazzle by underplaying, and by playing it true, without necessarily becoming the character. However, Balraj Sahni, a great actor himself, and resolutely an actor, not a star, was himself amazed to witness Dilip Kumar’s preparation for a role when he watched him on a set. Even Satyajit Ray admired Dilip Kumar’s method acting and was very keen to work with him. I will explain later why this did not happen. But while we are on point here it is perhaps not irrelevant to point out that both Dilip Kumar and Balraj Sahni were great readers, well versed in literature and poetry including Shakespeare, Dickens, Hardy, the Brontes etc. Balraj Sahni, as we know, had worked with the BBC in England, just when Soviet cinema was taking Europe by storm, and had taught in Tagore’s Shanti Niketan before joining films. Perhaps there is something to be said about an actor’s immersion in literature, such as Olivier and Pacino’s obsession with Shakespeare. In 1950, barely six years into his career Dilip Kumar told Mendonca that ‘From now on I am going to be choosy in the roles I accept because I can afford to do so.’ (The Illustrated Weekly, 24 December 1950). After that he never did more than one film at a time. This career practice has since become the benchmark for the industry, and is now back in vogue once Aamir Khan re-adopted the practice, a full fifty years after Dilip Kumar.\n\nDilip Kumar’s rise to success had coincided with some deep emotional losses. His brother Ayub had become bedridden after an accident in Kashmir and died very young due to infections in his kidney, despite the best treatment Dilip Kumar could provide for him. Ayub was his intellectual hero, and his confidante. He also lost his parents in quick succession, soon after he had bought his famous bungalow at Pali Hill.\n\nHe deeply idolised his mother and respected his simple God fearing father. These losses, and his natural disposition towards introversion, made him a loner. But he had a large family to support. And at least for his younger siblings he inherited his father’s dreams, of them joining the civil service or distinguishing themselves in academics. He had to not only provide for them, and for their children, but also to ensure their best education, even in America where at least three of them went to study at his behest. Given these financial demands it is remarkable that he was so choosy in work. He describes an incident early in his career, where he badly needed money and a producer kept a briefcase full of notes by the table as he narrated the story. He desperately wanted the money but in the end he said no because the subject was not good enough.\n\nHe was quite distraught when he was forced to break up with Kamini Kaushal, with whom he formed a hit on-screen pair too, after her husband put his foot down. He wasn’t her husband by choice. He was married to her elder sister and when she died young leaving behind two young children the family thought it wise that she should marry him and raise the children herself. Sitara Devi, the Kathak dancer who was married to K Asif, recalls how disconsolate he was and how he cried at their house after his break up.\n\nKamini Kaushal, born Uma Kashyap, was the daughter of Professor Shiv Ram Kashyap, who is regarded as the father of modern Indian botany. She studied English honours at Government College, Lahore, (Dev Anand’s alma mater too) where she was spotted by Chetan Anand, Dev Anand’s elder brother who cast her in his 1946 classic Neecha Nagar. In her own words, she ‘had no time to fool. I didn’t have any crush, I was busy swimming, riding, skating and doing radio plays on Akashwani, for which I was paid Rupees 10,’ when her elder sister died in a car accident and she was forced to marry her brother in law. An adaptation of Maxim Gorky’s famous play ‘The Lower Depths’, Neecha Nagar won the Palme D’or at Cannes, one of the few Indian films to have done so in the history of that festival. She was educated, polished, self-assured, and their love affair was the stuff of gossip in and outside the industry, especially after they became a hit pair with Shaheed. They were intellectually and socially well matched. Ismat Chughtai, whose husband Shahid Lateef directed them in Arzu told Dev Anand how the two used to hold hands on the sly, trying to cover it with a magazine. Soon after his break up he met and fell in love with Madhubala, who couldn’t have been more different to her, or him.\n\nHe fell deeply in love with the 18 year old Madhubala who was bubbly, vivacious and fun loving when they did the underrated Tarana together. You can see their love and chemistry, especially in the song Nain mile nain huwe bawre. But Madhubala’s father wanted to use their relationship to propel his film company by casting the hit pair, but Dilip Kumar was, rightly, loath to surrender his career choice to her father’s whims. He asked Madhubala to marry him more than once, even went so far as to arrange a Qazi for the Nikah on one occasion, but she backed out. Besides, there were also rumours of her link ups with other stars, including Premnath. The matter came to a head during the filming of Naya Daur when her father refused to let her off for the long outdoor shoot near Bhopal, after signing the contract and accepting her fees. He even threatened a court case. B. R. Chopra preempted him and filed a criminal complaint of fraud and cheating. The matter went to court, and Dilip Kumar deposed in his producer’s favor and against Madhubala, while Naya Daur was being shot with Vaijayanti Mala. He confessed his love for her in open court, while defending Chopra, and Madhubala and her father lost the case. Dilip Kumar then persuaded B. R. Chopra to drop the charges. After he got married to Saira Banu Madhubala, who was quite unwell by then, would often call him in Chennai, and oft spoke to Saira too.\n\nShe said she was really happy that ‘mere shahzade ko uski shahzadi mil gayi I am so glad that my Prince has found his princess.’ At Saira’s urging, he finally visited the dying Madhubala before she passed away in 1969.\n\nHe deeply loved his younger siblings and wished to groom them. If he couldn’t find time to be with them he would wake them early morning and take them for long drives. En route if they stopped at a dhaba he himself turned cook and rustled up his famous omelettes for everyone. He took them for holidays. His family doctor Shrikant Gokhale remembers that his first visit to the house was occasioned by one of Dilip Kumar’s younger sisters falling sick. He sat up and tended to her all night. Thereafter, Dr Gokhale became not just the family Doctor but also a close friend who sometimes travelled with him too.\n\nNot just his immediate siblings, and there were ten of them, the house was often also full of other cousins, and relatives, and endless funds were required just to run the household. One has read about Dostoevsy and Chekhov having to do the same, as well as the latter day qawwal Nusrat Fateh Ali, who had to feed almost a hundred family members daily, many of whom travelled with him wherever he went. The house was always overflowing with nephews and nieces and grand nieces, to whom he was always the most affectionate Uncle that he could be. He would fly kites, play cricket or football, put on shows, hear them tell stories, or perform their dances and he endlessly regaled them with stories from his life. Many of them recall the inordinate amount of time he spent helping them with their homework, or presentations or counselling them about life. He was, in that sense, a real life hero to them.\n\nHe was of course very close to Raj Kapur, and later Pran, and had other friends in the industry, as well as outside it, many of which lasted his entire life. But as they got busy, he saw less of his industry friends. But he was immensely popular, and in demand, and he often obliged people with different kinds of social appearances. He showered love and generosity on most people he met, whether socially or professionally. The popular 60s star Nanda recalls her first meeting with him, at a party, where she couldn’t summon up the courage to go up to him. He himself came to her after a while and recognised her as Master Vinayak’s daughter and proceeded to recite many a line from the Marathi actor’s films. He was known to always be respectful to the elders, long after he had become a legend. He would always remember and greet old colleagues with respect.\n\nAnil Kapoor, whose father worked with Dilip Kumar recalls,\n\n“One thing my father always told me about Dilip Sahab was that he never forgot his old colleagues and associates and it gave him great pleasure to meet them no matter what their status in life may have become in the intervening years.”\n\nHe was deeply solicitous about his mother when she was alive, tending to her or pressing her feet even after he had become a famous star. He insisted on taking care of Saira’s grandmother after he began to live with them and Dr Gokhale remembers him sitting by her side and pressing her head when she was ill on one occasion. When Saira was afflicted with ulcerative colitis soon after their marriage, he spent days and nights tending to her in the London hospital she was admitted to. Through the 50s and 60s he, along with Raj Kapur, led the film industry’s efforts to provide relief for drought, for floods, for junior artistes and for other charitable causes. As Chairman of the Blind Association he used to travel by a special train for more than a decade, making himself available to everyone. If he visited a film unit, as Yash Chopra recalls, he would greet every member of the unit, often preferring to eat with the unit hands. What he displayed was more than courtesy, he displayed a deep humanism, a sense of equality, some of which he obviously noticed in Nehru whom he hero-worshipped. Many remember the consummate ease with which he interacted with people from different backgrounds and walks in life, whether it was the driver or the gardener or the dhobi. This was one reason why his staff remained unchanged, or served him generation after generation. Manto has written a poignant account of his dhobi Ram Khilavan and his transformation in the madness of 1947. Dilip Kumar’s dhobi Pyarelal though remained with him through his life and as did his descendants. The same was also true for his valet Anwar, and his driver Abdul and his descendants. In that sense, he was a real life hero in more ways than one.\n\nIn real life too he spoke slowly, with deliberation, as he did in his films. He was a measured man, but not without a wicked sense of humour, including playing ghosts to Saira on many an occasion. Nobody who met him remained untouched by him. He certainly was the most loved and respected man in the industry, as Jaya Bhaduri asserts, and remained so for decades. For all who worked with him or aspired to work with him a visit to his house, or a meeting with him was almost an act of pilgrimage.\n\nHe was a generous host and once he moved out to live with Saira Banu and her mother Naseem Bano, immortalised by Manto in his famous sketch called Pari Chehra Naseem Bano, they always had two well stocked freezers in the house because he could invite any number of guests, including visiting cricket teams, singers, performers, at very short notice, day or night and insisted on serving everyone by his own hands.\n\nSince he was the mainstay of almost all films that he did after 1950, the main creative and organisational force, and often the most heavyweight figure on set, he acted as a true team leader, especially when shooting outdoors. He organised sports, activities, books, food, picnics for everyone, going out of his way to keep everyone entertained and in good humour. This, while also supervising almost all other creative departments of the film. The grand old Shashadhar Mukherjee, from the old Bombay Talkies produced ‘Leader’ for Dilip Kumar and told his son, who was assisting him to stay with Dilip Kumar as much as he could,\n\n“Stay with him if you must; spend your waking hours with him and develop the script and screenplay along with him. He is a genius when he crafts a screenplay and it is your good fortune that you are getting to work with him”\n\nRam recalled that, he worked on the script and screenplay with untiring zeal, writing, rewriting,\n\n“reviewing the scenes with me; discussing the sets, costumes, make-up, backdrops, outdoors and indoors in detail. There were nights when I stayed up with him at his house when he would be writing continuously. When he would fall asleep in the wee hours, I would drive back home and catch up with my sleep. It was then I understood why Mukherjee Sahab had instructed me to be with him all the time; it was to be my education – exposure to the dedication and passion of a man who worked relentlessly to achieve perfection in his work.”\n\nLeader was one of the few films where he received official credit for the story. Ram asserts, as others have echoed too, that he never asked for any preferential treatment for himself while on a shoot, even giving up his make up room, or his van when necessary, and that with his infectious cheer working with him outdoors was like having a picnic.\n\n“What makes Yousuf Bhai different from other stars is his unaffected humility and the sense of belonging he gives to each individual in his own way. The apnapan [sense of belonging] he radiates is so genuine and from the bottom of his heart. The courtesy, etiquette, tehzeeb [culture] and warmth you see in him are hard to find in anyone these days and even in the times gone by.”\n\nHe did not need to make these social investments, his creative control of the film was enough of a guarantee for its success, but for him the process was as important as the end. He could have just focused on his role, or on directing the film, which he virtually did all the time, but he enjoyed the human investment.\n\nIt was for the same reason that he never wore sunglasses, he wanted people to look into his eyes, to see into his soul.\n\nHe always enjoyed holding hands with people, or hugging them. In that sense he was an outstanding people’s person, which is curious because he was such an introvert, even a loner, pretty much all his life. Farida Jalal, his co-star and the beneficiary of his affection for many years, rightly says that he is a man who likes to give more than he receives. This was true of his personal as well as professional relations.\n\nHe had some of these qualities at the very beginning of his career too. When he first went to meet K. Asif, who was married to the famous kathak dancer Sitara Devi, memorialised, again, by Manto. Asif had then begun to plan Mughal e Azam but he said that while Dilip Kumar exhibited many princely qualities he thought he looked too scrawny and thin. Sitara Devi found him very urbane and polished. Asif told him that may be if I make this film ten years later I would cast you. As fate would have it, the film kept getting delayed and eventually Dilip Kumar was cast in the film. But Asif could not satisfy his desire to learn more about the character. He told him to just be a prince. But that wasn’t enough, especially since Dilip Kumar was going to get third billing in the credits, the first time this had happened since the start of his career. His friend Mukri brought him what books he could from the Anjuman Islamia, but they proved insufficient. In fact he later said that some of the famous despondency shown by Prince Salim in the film is the despondency felt by Dilip Kumar the actor at his inability to figure out how to play Salim. In the end his very restrain lifted the film and his confrontations with Akbar to another level. As many know Dilip Kumar and Madhubala had had a bitter break up by then. During the immortal romantic scene when Prince Salim caresses Anarkali with a feather, they were not even speaking to each other, yet they were professional enough to play their parts well. It is also obvious that Mughal-e Azam was a Nehruvian film through and through. Akbar as the benevolent monarch, Kumar who played the sculptor as the communist revolutionary, the ideal of love versus duty and the ecumenical unity in diversity in the film is very much the India of Nehru’s dreams, more than being a true depiction of Akbar’s times. Books have been written about Mughal-e Azam, and rightly so, because it can justifiably be said to be the greatest Hindi film ever made. It was the apotheosis and the harbinger of many different kinds of tropes employed by Hindi films. Father and son conflict, duty versus love, Hindu-Muslim unity, apart from being a technical tour de force with its shot taking, scale, dialogues and editing.\n\nAsif and Dilip Kumar were great friends. Asif, though not an educated man, had a great ear for Urdu poetry, as is evident in his films. By the time Mughal-e Azam began to be reshot he had divorced Sitara Devi (who was married to his Uncle before he eloped with her) and had married Nigar Sultana (one time hearthrob to Manto’s friend Shyam) who played Bahar in Mughal-e Azam. Asif and Dilip Kumar were temperamentally and intellectually poles apart but they had a roaring friendship. Asif, obviously, had a roving eye. One of Dilip Kumar’s younger sisters Akhtar, the brightest in the family, had just returned from America after finishing her studies. Dilip Kumar had high hopes from her but she was interested in Urdu poetry and somehow she fell in love with Asif and they eloped and got married. Dilip Kumar was totally crushed by this double betrayal and broke all contacts with them. It was only when they had a fatal accident and Asif was on his deathbed that he visited him in hospital. But even after Akhtar’s divorce, it took many years, and another family tragedy for him to be reunited with Akhtar.\n\nIt was not just Akhtar. Most of his siblings broke his heart, one way or another. He was not on talking terms with his elder brother Noor and did not even visit him when he was dying. His elder sister Sakina or Aapaji, the matriarch of the family after his parents passed away, was quite acerbic and authoritarian. His other sisters and brothers too ended up pursuing careers or causes that he disapproved of and so he became distant from them. These tensions were aggravated when he married Saira. Used to lording over him, or using his clout to lord over everyone else in the industry, they found it difficult to adjust to Saira, or to give up their immense claim on Dilip Kumar. When he made his second marriage with Asma, about which more below, the family further split into two sections and after his rapprochement with Saira it became difficult for her to overlook those who had not supported her.\n\nHe was the most famous filmy scion, in Mughal-e Azam, a son born after many tribulations and prayers, but ironically, he himself did not ever get the son that he once deeply longed for. He hardly spoke about Saira’s miscarriage, which happened soon after their wedding. He loved children, and spent much time with and on them. He also loved playing sports and played football till the age of 57, and cricket, and continued to play badminton for as long as he was able. Saira had a busy career after their marriage, just when his career was going into a slump. He kept himself busy with reading, and with social causes, and other commitments, but there was a void in his life. It was in those circumstances that he met and got secretly married to a Hyderabadi called Asma Rehman, a married woman with three grown up children, with tacit support, some might say scheming, of her husband. Dilip Kumar kept this a secret from the world, but also from Saira. Long after the news broke, and the full story, complete with wedding photos and the Nikahnama was published, he still continued to deny it. Asma was living with his family, in his house, a stone throw’s away from Saira Banu’s house where he had shifted soon after his marriage, while he was issuing these red-faced denials. He was shooting for Shakti then, and for Duniya with Ashok Kumar and nobody on the sets could dare ask him about it of course and he carried on as usual. Ashok bhaiyya, as he called him, could take liberties though. Once during a particularly intense and complicated shot for Duniya, after the director had called for Action, Ashok Kumar suddenly shouted, ‘Yusuf tune dusri shadi kar li, logon se ek nahi sambhalti tune do do kar li. Yusuf you have re-married, arre we find it difficult to manage one wife’ Everyone was stunned at this impertinence but Dilip Kumar kept his cool, smiled and politely shouted back, ‘Ashok Bhaiyya, can we discuss the critical issue you are referring to after I finish the scene? I agree it is a debatable issue but I am sure it can wait!’\n\nIt was his implausible denials which probably caused the scandal to spiral out of control. Khalid Mohammed recalls that when he went to interview Saira for her version of the story DIlip Kumar was descending the staircase of their house and said to him, ‘oh so you have come to shame me too!’ No doubt he hurt Saira deeply with this act, and no doubt somewhere he must have felt neglected, even possibly hurt, by her during their then brief marriage, but they closed the incident with dignity. It is a tribute to what they managed to build thereafter that few have remembered that incident after his passing. The dedication and singlemindedness with which Saira took care of him after he developed Alzheimer’s was exemplary. Dilip Kumar was immensely lucky to have someone who never allowed his dignity to be ever compromised. And dignity was very important to Dilip Kumar.\n\nHe was of course a great reader, who had also memorised thousands of Urdu, English and Persian, verses by heart. He read a lot and widely, especially when they were travelling for which he preferred places that were off the beaten track. An old dak bungalow, an undiscovered nook in the Coorg valley, the hills of Bhutan, with his own cooks and staff to look after. Cicero’s famous saying that ‘if you have a book and a garden than you don’t need anything else’ truly applied to him. And he could sometimes surprise people with his erudition. His cardiologist recalls him speaking once at an annual conference of Doctors where he amazed everyone by his knowledge of some of the latest aspects of medical research. Sharmila Tagore, no ignoramus herself, described him as highly learned man, the kohinoor of hindi cinema and recalled an event where he was invited as a chief guest at a Suigetsu event.\n\n“He gave such a wonderful speech. Full of knowledge and humour. The audience couldn’t get enough of him. He didn’t speak about himself, but he had made an effort to know all about the Japanese art of flower arrangement.”\n\nAgain, the effort required to do so speaks volumes for his professionalism, and generosity. Shobha De, who first met him in the 1980s, long after he had become, as Naseeruddin Shah put it, the ‘resident legend,’ remembers interviewing him at the Cricket Club of India, one of his favorite haunts, where he was,\n\n“polite, lofty, distant and unbothered by the circumstances and my discomfort. He was Dilip Kumar – in full legend mode. Erudite, profound and articulate, he was quoting Urdu couplets and Shakespeare, English poets and German scholars (his reputation as a linguist and well-read man was on full and unabashed display).”\n\nApart from films and literature and poetry, he was also deeply knowledgeable about music, especially Hindustani classical music. Many of us have heard the only song he sang for his films, his duet with Lata Mangeshkar in Hrishikesh Mukherji’s debut film Musafir, which would never have been made had he not goaded Hrishi Da to take up the gauntlet.\n\nHe played many instruments himself, and often organised soirees, or mehfils at home where he sang Ghazal, when he wasn’t listening to Ustads such as Bade Ghulam Ali Khan and Vilayat Khan. He was close friends with most Urdu poets of his era, many of whom worked with him. Faiz Ahmed Faiz recalled how his wife had insisted that he bring Dilip Kumar’s autograph when he first visited India. But he turned up empty handed and told his wife that it was impossible for him to take Dilip Kumar’s autograph after he himself had asked for Faiz’ autograph!\n\nThe writer Sharad Dutt, who compiled the monumental five volume Dastavez, the collected works of Manto in Hindi along with Balraj Mainra (a story which I have recounted in my book on Intizar Husain) remembers first meeting and interviewing him for Doordarshan in Delhi in the 1970s. After he had spoken for a few hours, on a long drawn out shoot, he called up Dutt at night and said he wanted to re-record the interview. Dutt was flabbergasted but when he learnt the reason he was even more shocked. Dilip Kumar said he had mispronounced two words and didn’t want the audience to think that Yusuf couldn’t speak Urdu properly! He visited the Press Club in Delhi with Sharad Dutt more than once as he enjoyed the mutton jalfrezi they offered him there. He was gregarious, fun loving, outgoing even, and loved to spend time with his close friends such as Pran and Raj Kapur but over the years his meetings with his old friends became infrequent. Particularly after his marriage to Saira Banu his life became more circumscribed. He had many friends from outside the film industry too and while he kept up with them it was not often possible for him to meet people who matched his intellectual calibre. Since he didn’t drink much, or did not at least do so compulsively, like, say, Raj Kapur, he did not need hangers on as they tend to collect around such figures. He did smoke, but kept that as clandestine as he could, even throwing away a cigarette when he spotted Mahesh Bhatt coming towards him on a street in New York. But withal, there was a certain loneliness, and an increasing loneliness, which could not be fulfilled, for all the adulation that he continued to receive from the younger stars, to the end of his life. His Alzehimer’s and the obliviousness that it generated for him in the last 20 years of his life did well to inoculate him from what would have been his certain irrelevance. It also protected him from witnessing the country’s descent into a political space which he could not but despise. He was saved by his madness then.\n\nHe hero-worshipped Nehru as we know. And Nehru adored him too. There are numerous pictures of them together. Some say that he even spoke like Nehru. But even before his adoration of Nehru his family was father and grandfather were avid supporters of the Congress party which began to hold a sway over the Pathans of the frontier once Badshah Khan or Frontier Gandhi decided to cast his lot with Gandhi and with the Congress party before being abandoned by both in 1947. There is no doubt that Nehru, along with Subhash Chandra Bose and Bhagat SIngh, more than Mahatma Gandhi, was the hero of the generation that came of age in the 1930s and 40s, and even the decade after independence. But with Dilip Kumar, a Pathan who had made Bombay his home, the adulation went a step further. He interacted with Nehru many times, even shared the stage many times, and Nehru, making a nation on the march, always had instructions to give about various aspects of nation building. Already, in the 1950s Dilip was much more than an actor, as a Muslim superstar he was also an embodiment of the hopes and aspirations of an independent India which was expected to confute the logic of Partition. The Congress leaders, Nehru downwards, who leaned on him or used him or were friendly with him could not have been unmindful of the fact that he was a Muslim. As a Muslim he was undoubtedly a useful asset for the Indian state. He was not just the most popular film star in Pakistan, and Bangladesh, but also, arguably, the greatest cultural icon. The adulation that he received in India was a solid proof of the fact that his religious creed would not hamper his heartfelt acceptance by the Indians. India needed to conquer religious strife to emerge as a world leader and therefore Nehru often enlisted Dilip Kumar for social welfare programmes or for appearing in patriotic short films. He also used his presence at events designed to promote national integration or to raise funds for the armed forces. One can even match Nehru’s pauses (who thought in English and therefore used pauses in his speech to translate his words into Urdu) to Dilip Kumar’s pauses during his dialogue delivery.\n\nRaj Thapar, the founder of Seminar who, with her partner Ramesh Thapar, led the capital’s intellectual vanguard for more than two decades, worked on the film Footpath with Dilip Kumar. Zia Sarhady who made the film was a fellow traveller and Footpath was as close to being an IPTA film as was possible. In her fine memoir All These Years she recalled that Dilip Kumar was\n\n‘urbane, screen hero of the time, every inch of him, in word or gesture, expressing a culture which is a pride of India, a special manifestation of Islam as it sought its home amidst the bewildering profusion of ritual and custom and speech in this country. It exists nowhere outside the subcontinent, neither does the language which crystallized, Urdu. But along with it goes a manner which makes everything else appear clumsy and shuffling and uncouth. And the film industry was full of Muslims holding the screen, carrying this culture within themselves amidst a sea of vulgarity which was also of their own making.’\n\nLord Meghnad Desai has written a fine book on Dilip Kumar where he posits him as Nehru’s hero, par excellence, as the book is titled. He has seen and analysed most of his films, as also his many interviews and had even met and interviewed Dilip Kumar himself. Desai finds that Nehru’s ideals of socialism and secularism were also the ideals that Dilip Kumar held. He also wanted to rebuild an India which practiced equality and where one’s religion ceased to matter as far as one’s public role was concerned. Dilip Kumar took part in many rallies for Nehru, he campaigned actively for the Congress party, right up to the end of his days, and supported Krishna Menon’s election campaign from North Bombay, more than once, to the hilt. Some of those ideals are reflected in the film Leader, which he virtually wrote and directed. For this film he observed a firebrand socialist trade union leader and heard his many speeches whose name was George Fernandes! Desai states that,\n\n“Dilip Kumar’s career is a reflection of the course of India since Independence. To me, in many of the roles he played, he embodied certain heroic ideals of Indian manhood. I use the plural ‘ideals’ deliberately for Dilip Kumar has played many characters—rural and urban, tragic and comic, passive and active, rich and poor. These roles form a pattern but a deliberate, consciously chosen pattern by which Dilip Kumar took his status as a role model seriously. As the mood in independent India changed, the screen characters he played also changed. Dilip Kumar’s career took off and rose to its peak during the time (1947-64) when Jawaharlal Nehru was India’s Prime Minister: 36 of his 57 films were made in this period. And it was at this time that Dilip Kumar developed a range of highly popular characters that reflected the idealism and optimism of that period, characters that inspired Indian youth and were often imitated by them.”\n\nDilip Kumar was a Nehruvian hero not necessarily because he made films that censured society and harkened towards a socialist future. In many of his films, Dilip Kumar played an obsessive or tragic lover, who was condemned by fate, or misunderstanding, to tragic death. Compared to him, Raj Kapoor and K.A. Abbas and even Guru Dutt made more films which (sentimentally)condemned contemporary society and/or hailed a socialist future. But even apart from films such as Naya Daur and Footpath, which explicitly posit a kind of a championing of the underdog and question extant social mores, most of his other films also exhibit some sensitivity towards the poor and their plight. In other films we also get a stand against the injustices of the caste system and religious superstition. In Raj Kapur or Bimal Roy’s films the rich as well as the Zamindars often appear as exploitative agents, but in Dilip Kumar’s films there are some well-meaning and paternalistic zamindars (Naya Daur, Ganga Jamuna) or kindly Kings (Aan) but their progeny turn out to be villainous. Footpath, where he played an anti-hero was closer to Awara and Shri 420 than the other films Dilip Kumar made. He only played a negative character once, in Amar, but in his later films he played an avenger many times. Most of his other films, says Desai, were more\n\n“in the popular reformist vein if they were about politics at all. In these films, good and evil are personalized and while the point is made it is made softly not harshly. This again is a middle path, a very Nehruvian way of dealing with conflict.”\n\nHe was a Nehruvian hero also in the sense that he played characters or acted in films which upheld an idea of sacrifice, or glorified idealism and nobility. His ‘weepies,’ which many of us are today unable to relate to are deeply connected to a poetic tradition where the protagonist, say in the world of Ghazal as shown by the late and great S. R. Faruqi, must suffer and suffer in love till his heart is softened enough by pain and grief to receive divine light. Lovers who cry in pain, as they do in most Urdu poetry, are lamenting not always out of self-pity, but also because they are inviting pain so as to become purer, nobler. As Faruqi has observed,\n\n“many qualities which are generally identified in Indian society with women—steadfastness against the (male) beloved’s fickleness, being given to copious weeping, growing thin and wasting away, being patient and self-surrendering—came more and more to be the mark of the lover-protagonist in the eighteenth-century ghazal”\n\nAnd Dilip Kumar the lover, whether in Devdas, Dagh, Deedar, Babul or Jugnu is a lover from the world of Urdu poetry and in this universe there is no conception of being successful in love. These hapless lovers sometimes frustrated Babu Rao Patel who wrote in his review of Babul,\n\n“The role of his life, Dilip Kumar, a master in portraying morbid characterizations of a spineless frustrated lover, lives the role of Ashok, the postmaster. Even his natural humour takes the hue of his helpless sex and soul starvation starvation and he strides through the picture with a pathetic poverty of a licked spineless lover who has neither the courage to love nor the guts to ask and take what he wants. It is a great work and the ease with which Dilip Kumar portrays the role makes one wonder whether the man himself has lived through similar moments of pathos and frustration in his private life!”\n\nThe hapless, lachrymose lover of Urdu poetry, like Dilip Kumar’s early characters, has made many others cringe too. We always want our heroes to be more manly, to be more action, even solution-oriented. But the fact is that the classical lover is not supposed to be successful. In fact success in love is to be abhorred. As Faruqi states,\n\n“Yet success in terms of this universe is unsuccess—the greatest success is therefore death. This poetry is thus quite naturally more occupied with dying than most love poetry that one is likely to encounter in other cultures. It reverberates throughout with the terror, and the ecstasy, of dying. Death, in spite of all its uncertainty and unfamiliarity, is an achievement, a respite, a transition: I hacked through life in every way, Dying, and having to live again Is doomsday (Abru)”\n\nThe world of the Ghazal was important to him, not just because he appreciated the Sufistic strains of Urdu and Persian poetry, which he knew well. It was important because he also professed the kind of ecumenical religion that those poets espouse.\n\nHe was a practicing Muslim who offered regular Namaz and observed fasts during Ramzan, besides fulfilling other obligations. But the Islam he practiced was not narrow or exclusionary. Unlike many other practicing Mulims he did not feel that Islam had a monopoly of truth, or righteousness. He was in that sense broadminded and ecumenical, and represented a strain of Islam that was deeply accommodating. His Islam was confessedly the Islam of Al Beruni and Maulana Azad and Bismillah Khan. He had a deep knowledge of the Quran which he studied regularly, and his copy of it was marked in red, green and blue notations. Perhaps because he was quite well versed in religious and historical literature he could take a benevolent view of other religions. As a Muslim his cultural practices, such as poetry, was as important to his identity as religious scriptures. One of the more important recent books on Islam was by the Harvard based brilliant polyglot scholar Shahab Ahmed who died young at 46. In What is Islam Shahab makes the important point that its adherents and critics often reduce Islam to the Sharia, whereas for its practitioners it has always historically been about their cultural practices such as poetry, and wining! This is certainly true for South Asia and was amply proven during the recent anti-CAA/NRC agitation at Jamia, where poetry became the key mode of protest. As an aside, I have to say that had he been active Dilip Kumar would certainly have lent his support to this agitation in whatever way he could.\n\nBut being the apple of Nehru’s eyes, or being a different kind of Muslim, was evidently not enough for Dilip Kumar. On more than one occasion in his life he had to face controversies which were wholly avoidable. One of his early films Jugnu faced problems with the censors because it apparently showed students in a poor light, a light which was not liked by the then Premiere of Bombay Morarji Desai and it was only after he had given his approval that the film was released. When he was making Ganga Jamna he faced inordinate delays with the censor board, as well as difficulties with financiers which embittered him, and possibly turned him away from film production forever. In the film his character Ganga dies to the chanting of Shlokas at the feet of Lord Rama and his last words are ‘Hey Ram,’ words with which Mahatma Gandhi also breathed his last. The censor board did not like a [Muslim] dacoit using the same words as the father of the nation. His close association with Nehru did not offer much help, and it was eventually the threat of a law suit along with Morarji Desai’s intervention which helped him clear the censors.\n\nA couple of years later he was embroiled in an wholly degrading controversy where he was charged with spying for Pakistan, a year before the 1965 war with Pakistan, when a large section of Indian Muslims suffered under the same suspicion. He was even accused of hiding a transmitter in his house for that purpose. All this on the basis of some clumsy, or contorted confession of an East Bengali refugee who was apprehended by the Calcutta police, and who had supposedly also named Mehboob Khan. The Calcutta police made a splash and even searched his house in Bombay. The case went on for more than a decade although it became quickly clear that so called confession was merely a diary of the accused where he had listed all the places and people that he had worked for in Bombay. But the fact that someone of his stature could be accused of such a thing, and that it made a huge national splash would have been a highly traumatic experience.\n\nNot long after he did Dil Diya Dard Liya, an adaptation of Emily Bronte’s Wuthering Heights. Incidentally he was quite fascinated by this novel and more than one of his films was adapted from the novel or influenced by its central character Heathcliff. K. Asif’s Hulchul, Ismat and Shahid Lateef’s Arzu, even Mela, to an extent, were all inspired by aspects of that novel. But Dil Diya, where he was paired with Waheeda Rahman, flopped badly and after the disgruntled producer announced that he had paid Dilip Kumar ten lakhs he was promptly charged with tax evasion. The case rested on a mere entry in a diary but it troubled him for a long time. The intricacies of the proceedings and their flimsy basis were well captured in his autobiography, by his lawyer N. K. P. Salve’s son who is today quite famous as Harish Salve.\n\nDilip Kumar remained a loyal campaigner for the Congress party until 1992. He was instrumental, along with his close friend Rajni Patel, in setting up the famous Nehru Centre for the Arts near Worli in Bombay, as a cultural hub, which still remains active. But the Indian state did not see it fit to confer any awards for him. He was also close friends with many powerful people, including Sharad Pawar, Rajni Patel and Bal Thackeray, before it all went downhill with the last. And yet, he won no National awards for his films, and not even a Padamshri. This despite the fact that many in the industry, including Nargis and Raj Kapur had long been awarded Padma Bhushans. He only received one in the Nineteen nineties, after even Talat Mahmood had been honoured, and also then, at last, the Dada Saheb Phalke Award. He was the fifth or sixth from Bombay film industry to get the Dada Saheb Phalkle award, long after Lata Mangeshkar, Prithviraj Kapur, Raj Kapur and even Majrooh Sultanpuri had been honoured. There was never any clamour for him to be awarded the Bharat Ratna, which he should have long got, although in popular imagination he had long been anointed as a Bharat Ratna. The outspoken Jaya Bhaduri strongly makes this point in her tribute to him in his book.\n\nThe demolition of the Babri Masjid and the riots, or the pogrom, which followed it in Bombay was a heartbreaking experience for him. We all know how anguished he was, and how active in the relief work. His relief work in fact earned him the ire of Thackeray who publicly accused him in his paper Samna which accused him of favoring Muslims for relief. Dilip said in an interview then,\n\n‘Bombay has never seen such an awesome scene. People in their quest for power are taking to inhuman thoughts and engineering brutalities unprecedented in history. In the name of religion, religion itself is abused and defiled. All religions promote thoughts of fellowship, kindness, consideration. But what is taking place is irreligious and ungodly bestiality let loose on the innocent people. The poor people. They are spread in thousands all over the city with no adequate shelter, no provision for food, for themselves or their children. Bas, period. No more talk about this. It makes me sick.’\n\nBut the Shiv Sena launched unruly demonstrations outside his house yet he remained undaunted. In his keenness to intervene and create bonhomie he even approached some parallel cinema directors such as Sudhir Mishra and Ketan Mehta to urge them to make short films on national integration. His main occupation during that last active decade of his life was to promote communal harmony for which he travelled and lectured in far flung places. It was also after this that he stopped exclusively supporting the Congress party. And in spite of Shiv Sena’s ire he remained committed to his ideals. Mahesh Bhatt recalls how in 1998 Dilip Kumar prevailed upon Javed Akhtar and him to to approach the Supreme Court of India with a public interest litigation [PIL] on the protests against the film Fire [directed by Deepa Mehta], which was pulled out of the theatres by the right wingers. This had created such a furore in the Rajya Sabha, that the business of the House was adjourned because the thespian was called ‘a Pakistani’ by a member of the right wing party. Bhatt recalls that ‘when we were being advised by some apprehensive film folks not to take on the establishment’ Dilip Kumar impressed upon them that,\n\n‘the freedom of speech is the very breath of the artists’ community. We are film makers, actors, writers. How can we remain silent and pretend to be blind when that ideal is being strangulated?’\n\nHe was, of course, a great symbol of subcontinental unity, and a great votary, as well as a component, of Indo-Pak friendship. Mahmood Qasuri, one time foreign minister of Pakistan even hinted at his role in creating a thaw during the Kargil war. He visited Pakistan quite late in his life, when he was nearly 75 years old and he was treated like Royalty, as he was pretty much everywhere he went. He had even been received by the Queen when he went to London soon after his wedding. He accepted the Nishan-e Imtiyaz, Pakistan government’s highest civilian award after, it has been suggested, getting the then Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s tacit approval. But Bal Thackeray would have none of it, he asked Dilip Kumar to return the award which he refused to do. The ugly demonstrations, when Shiv Sainiks stripped outside his house, was perturbing for the entire country. But he didn’t flinch, as he didn’t want to bend to Thackeray. He came to Delhi to meet and consult the Prime Minister and waited many days for an audience. Many had then asked him to speak to Thackeray, his old friend, but he refused to so. The award, he correctly maintained, was a recognition for the Indian film industry as well as for India. But he did say in an interview then that,\n\n‘I miss my friend Raj today more than on any occasion. He would not have let this agitation against me or any other artiste go unanswered. He would not have let this happen to me.’ [Raj Kapoor passed away on 2 June 1988.]\n\nEventually he stayed the course and didn’t return the award.\n\nThe 2002 Gujarat pogroms had an excruciating effect on him, as they did on many of us. He spoke up bluntly not as a Muslim, but also as an Indian. Just as Naseeruddin Shah, who has been outspoken the last few years, Dilip Kumar too was forced to bare his heart out because of the anguish he felt. The Indian he had lived and taken pride in was disappearing. On his 80th birthday, in December 2002, he told Subhash Jha\n\n‘Where can I go to escape the barbarism of my own people? … The Muslims will soon become a part of history. Every civilization is cyclic and must end. My personal view is that the Indian Muslim population may eventually be annihilated.’ Where could he go indeed? The answer today might come pat from his critics. It was good that his illness prevented him from hearing the war cry that is now used to shut all Muslim critics of the government. Besides he had long ago left Pakistan to come to India, why would he go back there!\n\nDilip Kumar was not unique among his contemporaries to be wholly consumed by the films he was making. Guru Dutt too immersed himself fully in his projects, as did Raj Kapur. As we all know Gurudutt had offered him Pyasa which he turned down because he was then doing Devdas and both characters were, as he put it, drunkards who railed against society. There was of course, a crucial difference between the two characters.\n\nDevdas’ tragedy is a personal tragedy because of his failure to stand up to his family, in other words to confront his own impotency, albeit the underlying cause may have been the social values which shaped him. But Vijay’s Pyasa condemns a society which refuses to value genuine talent and worships hypocrisy. Raj Kapur’s sentimental socialism was farther to the left than the films that Dilip Kumar was then making. Raj Kapur’s heroes were rebels or anti-heroes who tugged at our hearts. They protest against and reject a system which nurtures inequality, where privileges accrued at birth shape an individual’ destiny. His poverty stricken orphans who become criminals, or criminal like by circumstances end up showing the injustices of society. Raj Kapur even allowed Shombhu Mitra, one of the greatest actor-directors of Indian theatre and a major IPTA figure, to make an experimental film like Jagte Raho. Dev Anand, on the other hand, often played rogues, who worked on the shady grey areas between right and wrong but his characters were always charming, and stylish. But if Raj Kapoor’s pickpocket in Awara is an indictment of society, Dev Anand in House No. 44 intends no such message.\n\nThere is no doubt that Pyasa might have been a different, even superior film, had Dilip Kumar acted in it. But then, as many have observed, Guru Dutt the actor was born only to act in the films he made, especially Pyasa and Kaghaz Ke Phool. Guru Dutt was making films of despair at the height of his success. He began Kaghaz Ke Phool, a study in failure, after the heady success of Pyasa. He even named the protagonist Devdas.\n\nWaheeda Rahman’s introduction scene, an audition, in Kaghaz Ke Phool was a homage to a scene from Devdas where Paro goes to fetch water from the river. Like Devdas itself, Kaghaz Ke Phool’s central character is unable to stand up to his family, in this case his in laws. It was also a study in the fickleness of success, of the industry and audiences, who could crown you one day and dump you the next. Its failure and the financial losses he suffered after it, hit Guru Dutt hard, as he had already depicted in the film, and he never recovered from that blow psychologically. There is no doubt that Guru Dutt’s person and his films represent a stand of angst against society. One fails to notice any of that angst in Dilip Kumar’s films or his life, except perhaps the angst of Prince Salim. In fact he had a simplistic explanation for Guru Dutt’s tragedy as he said an in an interview many years later,\n\n“If you allow fame to get the better of you, you become nuisance, a public nuisance, a nuisance as a friend, as a member of the family, a nuisance to yourself. Why did Marilyn Monroe or Guru Dutt commit suicide? Because they were not able to strike a balance. A man’s popularity when he steps into this field is immeasurable… within a couple of years he becomes a celebrity. Then to control his own reaction to this fact is a very important problem. Some become alcoholics, some regard themselves as heroic off-the-screen as they are on-the-screen, some of them acquire strong mannerisms.”\n\nThis may have been true for Rajesh Khanna, say, but this explanation is not enough for Guru Dutt, who himself was minutely examining what fame or success meant. Bimal Mitra, whose novel Saheb Beebi Aur Ghulam proved to be Gurudut’s last artistic success, spent many years with the filmmaker and observed him in many different states. There is no doubt that in the last years of his life Guru Dutt was drinking heavily and his symptoms show him to be suffering very probably from severe bipolar disorder. He was also using sedatives heavily. His personal life, the separation and break ups with Geeta Dutt, and the unhappiness it all generated, created a deep sense of disillusionment in him.\n\nAs his other co-workers have also observed, he was sometimes lost, or detached or moody, unable to fathom his life or his lot. He would go into spirals of drinking, or lock himself in a little chamber in his office and writhe in pain. He would adopt a street dog one day and order it to be shot the next. He would try to make up with Geeta Dutt and spurn her the next day. Some of the letters he wrote to his sons, collected and published by Nasreen Munni Kabir, are revealing because they show how driven he was, in spite of his traumas. He continuously exhorted his sons, who were then no more than 7 or 8 years old, to work, not so much to love or to be tender or to show kindness, but to work and work. He is definitely a filmmaker of disenchantment, but there is something more to his unhappiness than his professional setback or his ruinous married life. Mitra describes him as a Maneeshi Purush, an exalted being, both learned and spiritually wise. The major revival of Guru Dutt in the last three decades owes something to his life too, since we now like to romanticise the suffering and self-destructive artist.\n\nGuru Dutt was an auteur in the full sense of the term. His films and his life were sometimes enmeshed with each other and he was driven to create, to author, stories, often of disappointment or failure. In his case life imitated Art imitated life was a true circle. He wanted to have his say, sometimes desperately so, and could inflict heavy damage on himself in the process of doing so. But in the end it was his deep hunger to continue to say things that took its toll on him. Here was an artistic life as we know them in the second half of the 20th century. The early or violent or untimely deaths of James Dean, Jack Kerouac, Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix, Robin Williams and many others sometimes ends up exalting their life. It is easy then to romanticise Guru Dutt, whose life and career offers many parallels with that of P. C. Barua. The list of Urdu writer-poet-actor who are consumed by alcohol is long indeed. Saigal, Manto, Akhtar Sheerani, Majaz, Guru Dutt are only some of the more famous names, from mid-20th century India alone. It is quite possible that Majaz, who even appeared in a scene in the film, may have provided some kind of a role model for Pyasa.\n\nDilip Kumar does not seem to possess that burning, consuming desire to say something, nor is his life marked by that kind of suffering. His films came to him. There is no doubt that he was always looking out for good ‘subjects’ as he called it, but one does not see him digging deep down within himself to find a subject or to spend desperate hours and days looking for one. He could afford to be choosy because he was in a sense, spoilt for choice. Everybody who wanted to make an unusual, or intense, or romantic film came to him, which included Guru Dutt, who had also offered him Kaghaz Ke Phool. So in that sense he did not have to strive hard. He also didn’t have to struggle hard for his success. In fact his very success created a problem. The tragedies he did in the first phase of his career took a heavy toll on him and, as is well known, he had to take psychiatric help and much counselling from drama teaches to change track in his career. But even then he had ample offers.\n\nIn comparison Raj Kapur was oozing with the larger than life joi-de-vivre which rightly defines him. Open hearted, warm, gregarious, fun loving, bon-vivant, gourmet, Raj Kapur’s zest for life was only stalled by his intense desire to succeed at the box office. It was the failure of his magnum opus Mera Naam Joker, released finally in 1970, that hit him very hard and after that he focused exclusively on the box office. Again, there is no comparable big failure in Dilip Kumar’s career. One can’t find something in which he put his heart and soul, and his utmost resources, to come up cropper. In comparison, Amitabh Bachhan, who really has had nine lives, met a debacle when he launched his event management and production company ABCL. Within a span of a few years he incurred a debt of 90 crores and much humiliation, after an outstanding career. Dev Anand too would not have found it easy to continue to make films year after year, long after he had ceased to be commercially important in the industry’s eyes. But there was a defining passion for filmmaking, or for work, that bade him go on and on.\n\nIn comparison Dilip Kumar’s life and career seem easier. One can argue that he worked so hard on the films that he did, with such dedication, that he did not leave much room for failure. He always said that he never took the persona of Dilip Kumar seriously and preferred to detach himself from the image of the star. He regarded the mid-career course correction, turning from tragedies to comedies, as also a step in personality correction and said that\n\n“personality correction is necessary for successful men, like Prime ministers, businessmen, politicians… It’s essential that one should keep an eye on one’s own personality. You must have seen people in politics who become chief ministers and then pass into oblivion – how egotistical they became and how pathetic they look.”\n\nBut for all the deliberation and level-headedness it is difficult to detach Dilip Kumar from Yusuf Khan, at least after Ganga Jamna in 1961. He worked hard on his performances after that too and many think that even in his second innings in the 1980s, in films like Shakti and Karma too he was outstanding as an actor. Shakti had generated a huge buzz because it brought Amitabh and Dilip Kumar together, and by all accounts Dilip Kumar, who had the author-backed role, stole the show there. But it is difficult to deny that we begin to see typical Dilip Kumar mannerisms and poses in his later films. In his style of speaking and in his performances one begins to see more of him than the characters that he plays. It didn’t help that the characters that he plays after Ganga Jamna, and even the films that he does, are more stock than real. Even his wishlist for roles—to play a Don, a school teacher, a lawyer—represents types, rather than actual human beings. He didn’t say that he wanted to play a tyrannical father or abusive cop. When he spoke about the dearth of subjects what he probably meant was the lack of characters where he could outplay himself.\n\nEven in real life he was unable to leave Dilip Kumar behind, no matter how easygoing he tried to be. After about 1960, the Ganga Jamna date again, almost nobody who met him was unconscious of his status as a demigod, as the thespian par excellence. And it is difficult to conclude that, for all his cultivated down-to-earthness, he himself was unconscious of his stature. Shobha De noticed how aloof, how lofty he was, when she interviewed him,\n\n“All this, while looking dreamily into the distance, like he was ensconced on a gilded throne in his own kingdom with a humble court historian obediently chronicling his utterances for future generations. His sense of personal ‘legacy’ was intact.”\n\nHe was a bon vivant, he moved in elite circles, he was treated as Royalty wherever he went. He showered his love on people all right but the people he was most comfortable were often people like himself: stars from the industry. He was known to always have a mot juste, and indeed he was incredibly articulate, even learned, but unlike say, a Chetan Anand, or a Shyam Benegal, his social circle was not known for its intellectual brilliance. The distinguished Marathi playwright Satish Alekar remembers that Pune’s famed Theatre Academy had invited Dilip Kumar and Shashi Kapoor as guests to celebrate the 100th show of their production of Vijay Tendulkar’s Ghasiram Kotwal. What happened afterwards was interesting,\n\n“In 1975 to celebrate 100th show of our Theatre Academy, Pune’s original Marathi Production Vijay Tendulkar’s: Ghashiram Kotwal, we invited Dilip Kumar and Shashi Kapoor as the chief guests. Thereafter not many know that Dilip Kumar became our friend. There were many occasions where Jabbar Patel, Anil Joglekar and me were invited to his home on the Pali Hill. Several story ideas were discussed to make film. Story drafts were discussed but never materialised. But we became friends. Dilip Kumar used to speak Marathi fluently. He had seen many popular Marathi Sangeet Natak’s. Sometime at his home he will take out harmonium and sing old Marathi theatre song made popular by Bal Gandharva. Dilip Kumarji and Saira ji used to visit Pune during weekends. They used to stay at famous Turf Club and used to invite Ghashiram actors Gang for a high tea and chat.”\n\nIt is not surprising that he quickly befriended Alekar and his friends. But did his interactions with Jabbar Patel and Satish Alekar extend to a deeper investment in the considerably exciting work then being produced by Marathi playwrights such as Vijay Tendulkar and with stalwarts such as Satyadev Dubey? Was he meaningful to the great experimental wave that began in Indian theatre and films in the late 60s and 70s? He was certainly relevant enough to Satish Alekar and Jabbar Patel. He admired the work they produced, but was the feeling mutual? I will return to this in the last section.\n\nIt is difficult to entirely deny the truth of Waheeda Rahman’s complaint that after Ganga Jamna he began to play it safe. Satyajit Ray was keen to work with him but he didn’t show much enthusiasm once he learnt that the film required him to take off his shirt, something which he was loathe to do because he was hyper-conscious of his hirsute physique. He said he refused David Leans’s Lawrence of Arabia because he was not happy with the script and also because they were demanding too many dates in bulk. Afterwards he always justified his decision to back out by pointing at Omar Sharif’s excellent performance in the film. But had Dilip Kumar done that role, and had he also done Dr Zhivago after that, who knows where his career may have gone. It was exactly the kind of fillip and challenge that could have forced him to reboot and re-find himself.\n\nPerhaps by then he didn’t need to do so because he was already so successful and satisfied with the adulation that he was receiving. But there are few notable films in his oeuvre after Ganga Jamna. He did experiment with unusual subjects such as Aadmi, or Sagina Mahato, but their execution left something to be desired. He did not lack for big hits such as Ram and Shyam and others such as Kranti and Karma which he did in his second innings. But he preferred to work with set ups which he could mould to his preferences, including the heroines he approved of. Many directors and producers wanted to work with Dilip Kumar, but few could. He was a monarch, but he chose his co-workers for reasons other than their submissiveness. He worked in three films with Waheeda Rahman and almost seven of them with Vaijayanti Mala, neither of whom were known to be docile.\n\nYet, his search for subjects, and his dissatisfaction with what was on offer never became debilitating. Unlike many other serious actors who were forced to do films they didn’t want to, he never disdained what he was doing. He gave his all to his projects, right to the end. In that sense he was absent from his present, whatever he was doing. That is a gift, even a blessing. It is not that he was not aware of the work that the new wave was producing in Hollywood or in Bollywood. It is not that he wasn’t desirous of doing better films but he felt it was not possible for him, that late in his career, to go to the new directors and seek work. Perhaps he was also hesitant to do so because he had doubts whether his wishes would prevail over some of those redoubtable directors. Although he did work with Subhash Ghai and Ramesh Sippy who were successful in their era and certainly Sippy was renowned for his technical wizardry.\n\nHe acknowledged that the present day actor is,\n\n“far more skillful. And they may have learnt from what they have seen over the years and from other films done by other people within our country. The levels of rendering are more accomplished…but it helps to have [the systemic training at the]the institute and experience on the stage, I wish I had the benefit of this experience.”\n\nI think he was very clear about the fact that he was a popular actor, as opposed to a niche one, and that his films were meant to be seen by the masses. The consideration that a film should run, i.e. should be a hit, is uppermost in the minds of most commercial actors, otherwise known as stars. The numbers matter, not just for money, but because aesthetically and emotionally they are more oriented towards giving pleasure to the largest number of people possible. As he explains in answer to a question as to why he never went in for small films, he said,\n\n“No, I did selective scripts like “Jogan”, “Footpath”, “Sangdil” and “Shikast”. In those times they were deemed to be a little different but when they don’t do well, the project becomes a disaster and your name becomes taboo. I could have afforded it if I was by myself, but I had a large family to look after. I couldn’t afford those lofty ideals and attitudes. Things have to be met at the end of the month. So I thought discretion was the better part of valor. Nevertheless, I tried within the given circumstances, to pick up relatively better scrip"
