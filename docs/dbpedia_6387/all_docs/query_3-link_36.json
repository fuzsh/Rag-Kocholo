        "text": "Luckily I was able to read the NYTimes article since my family has a subscription. As usual, well written BR!\n\nRIP Mohammed Yusuf Khan aka Dilip Kumar, a towering institution of acting as Madan rightly pointed out. Like MANK said, Ashok Kumar, Motilal and Balraj Sahni may have been the first to popularize natural acting in Hindi cinema, but Dilip took it to another level entirely and remained probably the first actor-star who was at the top for a long time. He made method acting his own and was also a great song actor. Whatever films I watched him, whether it was Mehboob Khan’s Andaz with Nargis and Raj Kapoor (yes my fellow millennials, I am one of the very few who watches older films), Madhumati, Aan or his latter films like Shakti, Mashaal and Saudagar, his magnetic presence and acting was the first thing would grab my attention and I would be hooked. I echo MANK and Madan that his greatest legacy is that he inspired multiple generations of actors like Amitabh, Kamal, SRK and perhaps Manoj Bajpai. Yet, he still to this day towers over all of them.\n\nEveryone will have their top 5 or top 10 lists of great Indian actors and Dilip will definitely be part of those lists. Even though Kamini Kaushal (his first love) is still around, he was the main link to the “Golden Era” and now he’s departed. Of course, many of his fans would have wished for him to hit 100, but 98 is a solid innings.\n\nMy dear condolences to Saira Banu for being his constant companion for 5 decades and his caretaker during his last years.\n\nIf you want to honor his legacy, most of his movies are on YouTube and please do take advantage to watch them.\n\nAlso RIP Richard Donner. Thank you for Superman, Lethal Weapon, the Goonies, Scrooged and The Donner Cut of Superman II (I have not and will not watch the Lester version). And most importantly thank you for giving us Christopher Reeve, RIP.\n\nRIP Dilip Kumar.\n\nDilip Kumar and Amitabh Bachan have made me cry tonnes of tears in the movie Shakthi. It was one of the first movies that I ever watched. My dad had it in his movie collection and I remember watching it quite often in my childhood.\n\nDilip Kumar saying “mein bhi tumse mohabbat kartha hoon, bete” and hugging Amitabh in the movie’s climax is how I remember him.\n\nSad to see all these great actors who have entertained and made my life colorful through their movies pass away one by one.\n\nHe was way more talented in comparison to his contemporaries. From whatever little I saw of his work, he didn’t resort to making faces in the name of acting. His performances were always very internalized and pitch-perfect. When he cried, I cried with him.\n\nIt might sound silly….. but actors passing away hurts, bcoz I always feel like they are a part of one’s life/childhood. Actors and movies evoke emotionally charged memories.\n\nDilip Kumar and Shakthi takes me back to the comfort of my childhood home, the safety & comfort of my parents’ presence, and carefree days.\n\n“He wrote “History of Indian cinema”, he did not write “Indian movie industry”. History will of course include movie personalities from all over India, and so it will include Dilip Kumar.” – The problem isn’t just with the words history of Indian cinema but what he said further – that it will always be before Dilip Kumar and after Dilip Kumar. I think it’s an extreme stretch to assume the impact of DK was uniformly as strong on all regional cinema as on Hindi cinema to make that statement valid. Yes, he influenced actors from all over to some degree but would it necessarily be a before/after effect in say Tamil or Bengali cinema? Don’t think so. AB’s statement is perfectly valid for Hindi cinema – as BR said – but an exaggeration when it comes to INDIAN cinema. The larger issue is those immersed in ONLY Hindi cinema culture make the unconscious assumption that Hindi and Indian cinema are equivalent. I don’t think most down South would agree. Or, for that matter, South Indian language speakers living ‘up North’ (to the extent you could call Mumbai north which nobody other than South Indians would do) like me.\n\nThis is sort of what Rahul has also addressed:\n\n” a case may be made for Dilip Kumar being a national icon if either he was well known in the south (like Amitabh) or if a sizable number of well known actors had acknowledged a debt to him while he was alive ( like many in the Hindi film industry have). I think that none of the two is true, but I could be wrong.” – Exactly. Kamal acknowledged DK in the obits but Kamal is ulaganayagan, he is very well informed about cinema in Hindi as well as abroad. I wouldn’t be surprised if some young South actors actually heard about DK only now that he is dead. Your example is perfect. DK was a colossus beyond doubt but for all India influence, he was no match for AB.\n\n@kaveri hats off to you for being brave and mentioning the fact …\n\nThere is HARDLY any doubt that the NYT panders to a certain section of readers who are quite happy with… you know what…\n\nWhile I take great offense to the the term ‘Hindu Nationalists’, I didn’t expect BR Saab to fall into that trap because he is someone who UNDERSTANDS the nuances of making such statements. If BR Saab is trying to say that even GREAT artists like Dilip Kumar aren’t spared the dirt of politics, I would agree; in the same vein as when Chaplin was pulled up during McCarthysim. While this is a left-leaning blog, BR Saab has been kind enough to let folks like us write and comment upon what we feel differently. It is not his ‘left-leaning’ tendency, but it it his humanity that is letting folks like us comment. [That is what I think; if BR Saab thinks differently and that he believes in left-leaning ideology, that is his personal choice.]\n\nAnd here’s my take; there’s NO GLORY left writing for the NYT: Least of all, BR Saab has written better pieces here than on that newspaper. To be honest with you BR Saab, a very disappointing piece pandering to the needs of newspapers like NYT and WP whose star-writers are Aatish Taseer and Rana Ayuub.\n\nThis is the SAME NYT that put out the racist cartoon … here I am referring to another left-leaning ‘print’…\n\nhttps://www.firstpost.com/world/nyts-mangalyaan-cartoon-yes-its-racism-no-its-not-about-modis-us-visit-1739185.html\n\nAnd finally, that you for hearing folks like us out …\n\nAnJo: Firstpost was right leaning in those days as I believe R Jagannathan was still in charge then. But that hardly matters as the NYT cartoon is self explanatory. To be frank, I don’t mind it as it’s a cartoon and a cartoon should be allowed to give offence. But NYT has been at the forefront of not applying those standards anymore and devoting copious column inches to arguing why cartoons, in fact ANY words, can be more lethal than an AK47 round. If that is so, why the f is that cartoon still up there? And yes it is, I opened the NYT link. I knew before I learnt of this cartoon that their much vaunted wokeness is entirely performative and devoid of substance and this only confirms my view. The only reason they even pretend to be woke is US millennials and zoomers are very vocal against racism and this outlet like others will sink if they depend on the subscription of boomers alone.\n\nStill a sinking ship. Had a subscription until I found out how hollow their columnist Bari Weiss was. Yuck. And even before then, I had noticed that their op-ed was literally just that – reams of polemic and not much commentary. They do have or used to have three conservative columnists for balance but balance wasn’t the problem, the content was.\n\nAll right then, didn’t quite expect to see such depth of hate for the NYT in this space ….. not that there aren’t plenty of things to criticize about the paper. I’ve been dismayed by the strangling of all “non-woke” voices in its opinion pages. Whether one agrees with Bari Weiss or not or for that matter with Sen.Tom Cotton, for that point of view to be silenced rather than rebutted and for the opinion page editor to be pushed out in the latter case is troubling. That said the news features, investigative reporting, long form deep dives, pandemic reporting are of a high quality and it is still the US’s preeminent newspaper. I admit I don’t get my India news from the NYT simply because it’s not a focus and is a minuscule part of its coverage. For every perceived “hit job” on India, I think there are also positive pieces though it’s the negative stuff that sticks in memory. I can recall at least a few positive opinion pieces on India by Tom Friedman in the past. At any rate, this is not a sponsored post 😉 and my goal is not to change any minds but merely to present an alternative view even if mine is the only one!\n\nApologies brangan for digressing from what is a tribute to Dilip Kumar rather than a critique of the NYT. I was taken aback by the vitriolic dismissal of the entirety of the NYT’s work as a yellow rag and trash. I’m mostly a silent reader and don’t comment a whole lot so this kind of derailment isn’t likely to be a regular thing 😉 Also, I hope you get to contribute to the NYT again, I’ll be cheering! 😀\n\n“not that there aren’t plenty of things to criticize about the paper. ” – In that case, why do you feel the need to classify negative comments about it as ‘vitriol’? If a newspaper is unjustifiably hyped living on its past glory even as its current content goes down the drain, the reaction to that is bound to be strong.\n\nMy concern is not with how they cover India. I agree with you that it is a miniscule part of their reporting and that goes for most newspapers and outlets abroad, something that Indians with delusional ideas about our international influence cannot seem to digest. Actually a tribute to DK on the NYT pages is a minor miracle in that regard.\n\nWhat I cannot condone is their neocon turn in the 21st century much like CNN which too had previously had enjoyed a stellar reputation in the TV news world. It is very hard to believe anymore that this paper too, like WaPo, had published the Pentagon Papers back in the 70s. That truly ‘liberal’ side of the paper like other mainstream outlets is dead (underscored by their perfunctory obituaries for Mike Gravel himself) while a make believe wokeness is plastered over its content to conceal the fact that they are now essentially in the business of manufacturing consent for the establishment.\n\nIt is not a completely unexpected outcome as newspaper readership has caved in across the world. You see that in TV news too that everyone is either a former Democrat or Republican operative or, well, a CIA intern whether officially disclosed or not. But in that case, it becomes difficult to axiomatically accept the content of a newspaper or TV channel as great or reliable merely because of its past reputation (after all, how do I know when Joe Scarborough isn’t trying to insert a Republican talking point and when he is). The one outlet I might still give that benefit of doubt to some extent is BBC but it too is increasingly embattled. In other words, it’s not a singling out of NYT – WaPo, WSJ are all pale shadows of their former selves. I have an Atlantic subscription…for now. Not without their flaws either but they publish the kind of political pieces that I never got from NYT during the 2-3 years I had the subscription (which is a long enough time especially in the Trump era). Like this one…\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/07/george-packer-four-americas/619012/\n\n@Madan: There are negative comments and then there’s outright trashing of everything the paper stands for. To me it seems like the collective criticism reflects the latter and perhaps to you it’s not shrug\n\nI agree that the paper is not the liberal bastion of the past but as you acknowledged the environment politically, socially and economically has changed and with it the paper has too. Aspects of the coverage (for me in particular the opinion pages) are troubling but I find plenty of solid, hard reporting, tracking and information. I like the Atlantic too – Ed Yong had in my book the best coverage of the pandemic. I’ve always loved reading George Packer from his days with the New Yorker. But then there are journalists I like reading in the New Yorker too. I often pick and choose based on the journalists whose work I like much as I read/watch brangan and perhaps not others on FC. In general I find dismissing all of something out of hand somewhat problematic – but that’s me, others clearly disagree and that’s fine.\n\n@krishikari – laughed out loud at your second comment! Thanks. 🙂\n\nBR – I agree with you – even today, writing for the NYT is a huge thing for any journalist. And the grand old lady still has decent investigative reporters and decent coverage.\n\nThat said, I found your piece sadly lacking in your usual brilliant prose. I don’t know what went wrong, or even if you think it did at all, but it was the most pedantic piece of writing I’ve ever seen from you. Honestly, if I hadn’t gone back and looked at the by-line, I would have thought that ‘Mujib Mashal’ (whoever he is, god bless him!) was the writer. DK deserved more, surely?\n\nYour success on FC is well-earned. You don’t need to prove your writing credentials to anyone. And video reviews are definitely taking the place of print/written reviews. All that is true.\n\nBut do allow me to mourn – a little – the demise of a great writer, someone whose reviews, quips, analyses, critiques, have given me hours and hours of reading pleasure. I miss it. I wager I’m not the only one.\n\nC’est la vie! Onwards…\n\n“That said, I found your piece sadly lacking in your usual brilliant prose.

DK deserved more, surely?” Absolutely, I am feeling bad to echo this. It reminded me of once BR writing for Malayalam Manorama. The piece had the makings to enter the generic world of Malayalam Manorama. But, we don’t read BR for that. Do we? All through the piece, I kept searching for the old BR who would show us through his brilliant prose how the tugs of his heartstrings were stirred by a particular moment from a movie that you can only expect BR to remember. I remember Manoram’s terrific “Mistress of Arts” obituary now as I write this, and man, that is the gold BR standard. BR has promised something big for his August piece. Eagerly awaiting for it:)\n\nEvery big Western publication has a house style, and I had to conform to it (which was not an issue to me at all).\n\nThis is how my original draft began.\n\nDilip Kumar, who passed away at the age of xx, was the last survivor of the triumvirate of actors that ruled Hindi cinema in the 1950s-60s, each of them fashioning a distinct screen persona. Raj Kapoor‘s signature role was that of the Chaplinesque naïf constantly negotiating a world that’s lost its innocence. Dev Anand, known as the Gregory Peck of India, became a stylish matinee idol. Dilip Kumar’s reputation as a Method Actor would suggest an affinity with Marlon Brando, but in his autobiography titled The Substance and the Shadow, Kumar said, “The epithet was used for me much before it was used for Brando. The truth is that I am an actor who evolved a method… I learned the importance of studying the script and characters deeply and building upon my own gut observations and sensations about my own and other characters.”\n\nKumar wasn’t the first actor to break free from the semaphoric, silent movie-style acting popularised by stars like Sohrab Modi and Prithviraj Kapoor. There were actors like Motilal and Ashok Kumar. The latter, a huge star much before Kumar entered films, was the one who planted the seed in Kumar’s mind: “It’s very simple. You just do what you would do in the situation if you were really in it. If you act it will be acting and it will look very silly.” Kumar took this advice so seriously that his preparation for scenes became the stuff of legend.\n\nBut the criticism that Dilip Kumar declined after Ganga Jamuna is valid. One reason for this was that after GJ- which he had officially written and produced (and unofficially directed) was a big critical and commercial success- he started becoming the ghost writer and ghost director on all his films. He was just not cut out for this , but he was too egotistical to realize this. Hence the string of disasters like Leader, Aadmi, Dil diya dard liya etc, where DK’s performances became more and more labored and self-indulgent. Reportedly on Bairaag, in which he played a triple role, DK shot close to 100 hrs. or so of footage, with his constant retakes and improvisations driving up the budget and schedule to herculean proportions. The film turned out to be one of his worst, and he went into exile for 5 years after this disaster. On his return, he did stick only to acting, and when he did attempt an official directorial debut with “Kalinga”, the results were so bad that the producer refused to release the film. Subhash Ghai, who saw the film at a trial show at the thespian’s request, was so embarrassed by what he saw that he escaped during the intermission without speaking to DK -whom he admired a lot. No wonder that DK did not speak about this film in his autobiography, the whole exercise turned out to be a nightmare for him, with the producer threatening to burn the film’s negatives.\n\nAnd I don’t think DK did any sort of reinvention as an actor, he only stagnated and became outdated. His performances in films like Footpath, Madhumati and Mughal -e – Azam looks more modern than the ones in Kranti or Qila. Also, what Naseer says about DK limiting his film appearances and driving up demand may not be intentional on DK’s part, but it was affective in maintaining at least a perception of his stardom and importance across decades. He remained a bigger star for the industry rather than for the audiences. This is very Unlike Bachchan, who is very much a great modern (and traditional) actor who could seamlessly move from masala film lead roles to character parts and still remain prolific.\n\nI agree to some extent with Naseer’s critique.\n\nThe parts I don’t agree with are:\n\na) That DK ushered in the dreaded star system – No, the South already had it and/or would have had it with or without him. And Shammi was on his way to becoming a star anyway in the 60s even as DK entered his indulgent phase.\n\nb) That DK should have mentored and nurtured actors – Very few do it worldwide. I would like to know how many actors has Naseer mentored.\n\nc) Speaking of which, Nas himself has fared much worse than DK in the movies he did for money, like Krishh or Dirty Picture. I know he will find a way to blame that too on DK and AB leaving so space for pure character actors like him but he could have found other ways to satisfy himself and also make a better living, like emulating Saeed Jaffrey.\n\nNow the part I agree with is that in essence, DK became a brand to be repeated over and over and his later innings soured memories of his talent (where AB, notwithstanding the odd misstep, largely furthered his legacy in his second innings). I agree with what MANK said that DK was the actor that the industry romanced over but AB was the all round master (of course AnJo is hardly going to disagree with this anyway 🙂 ).\n\nI sort of see it this way. Hollywood evolved from the straight delivery-smoothness of Grant/Peck/Burton/Harrison to the introduction of stylized method acting via Marlon Brando to which Pacino and DeNiro added much needed grit and muscle. I obviously don’t mean muscle in a macho way as neither Pacino nor DeNiro were renowned for their physique. But they conveyed a rawer, rougher aesthetic and reveled in it. They moved acting from the uber nuance of Brando to high octane intensity that the masses too could connect with. You can only move on to appreciating the great Brits like Alec Guinness, Gary Oldman or DDL AFTER Pacino and DeNiro have shown you the potential of acting in more commercial films. This is what AB achieved too with DK being the Brando parallel and the previous Prithviraj/Ashok Kumar generation being the parallel of Grant/Peck.\n\nBR Saab please delete the above comment and paste this – I believe the links are working here …\n\nThere’s a history behind Naseer’s jealousy, anger, and frustration in that order. He realized too soon, and wisely so, that he just wasn’t cut out for the ‘navarasa’ type of acting so easily achievable for Amit and then Dilip, again, in that order. To his credit, he learnt it, but he never forgot it. In his memoir, ‘And then One Day’, he acknowledges that ONLY Amit and Dilip could fulfill the requirements of Hindi cinema in totality. [Goddamn, the man uses 2.5 pages of his autobiography to diss ‘SHOLAY.’ This is the equivalent of a hatred timeline as maintained by Rakhee as in ‘MERE KARAN ARJUN AAYENGE!’] His main grouse is against directors like Benegal, Nihalani who went ahead with main-stream stars after the art-house films fizzled out in the late ’80s. He was always of the opinion that where would Benegal and Nihalani find actors who would herald pigs across a river in PAAR or play a disturbed MOHAN JOSHI in ‘Mohan Joshi Haazir Ho!\n\nIn the meantime, Smita went on to ‘NAMAK HALAL’ and ‘SHAKTI’. Basically,, it is his complete failure in understanding that an artiste can survive wherever if he is talented enough. And Goddam, Naseer is talented as one can get. If a Kamal Haasan can take the bold step of venturing into commercial ventures inspite of his short stature and bad voice — [I recently watched a clip of the DOSTANA Tamil remake; I forget the name; the scene where Zeenat lodges a complaint regarding eve-teasing and Bachchan, oh so cool that he is — chewing a gum and chides Zeenat — Hassan looks so bad, so weak in the Tamil movie compared to Amit; and Amit keeps oozing out style and charisma thanks to his height and voice and his mastery over this form of commercial acting.] Naseer simply forgets and fails to acknowledge this form of acting! By that logic, almost ALL Marathi films, including Lagoo’s and Patekar’s NATASAMRAT, need to be considered the embodiment of bad acting!!\n\nAmit was the first choice for ARDH SATYA. But by that time, Amit had exhausted all the cop roles and with the breaK-through ‘ZANJEER’, there was hardly anything he could add to Dilip Chitre’s all-encompassing poem on ‘Ardh Satya’ and Pancake’s story ‘SURYA.’ And then he had ‘INQUILAAB’ coming next! So it turned out to be a gift that Amit didn’t act in that one with Om and the brilliant performance of Amrapurkar as ‘Rama Shetty’ locking horns!\n\nThe one thing that pricks Naseer to this date is why the ‘champions’ of parallel cinema movement moved on to commercial starts like Karishma, Bajpayee, and of course, Nihalani with ‘Dev.’ [Nihalani had a life-long desire to with Amit; and he even surrogately worked with the family when he cast Jaya in ‘HAZAAR CHAURASI KI MAA.’\n\nNaseer got really pissed off when Nihalani chose Amit for ‘DEV.’ It was a life-long desire of Nihalani to work with Amit and it bore fruition in ‘DEV.’ So Naseer went on a tirade to down-play Amit’s acting skills and over-praising Om’s skills: The tragedy is, being such a wonderful actor – who was called out by the great NYT as the ‘blind’ actor – he forgot that in the context of the movie, Om is a hard-liner and he acts with a tenor and pitch in line with his thinking: ‘Sab Choohe hai Saale’ Bil Mein Ghuske Maarna Chahiye’ to Amit’s soft-spoken, low-pitch voice: ‘Kya Kar Rahe Ho tum? Tum in bhatke hue naujawaano ko aur, aur door bhagaa rahe ho…!\n\nI prefer stars over franchises any day, so god bless the star system.\n\nDitto 🙂 . I think i have seen the Hindi version of Sagina, and i don’t remember all that much about it. i have not seen the Bengali version which DK is so proud of.\n\nGoddamn, the man uses 2.5 pages of his autobiography to diss ‘SHOLAY.’ This is the equivalent of a hatred timeline as maintained by Rakhee as in ‘MERE KARAN ARJUN AAYENGE!’\n\nAn Jo that was lol 🙂 . Naseer was also angry with Ketan Mehta when he cast Amitabh as Mangal Pandey in Kartoos, of course that film didn’t get made at the time and it was later made with Aamir. Naseer and Aamir fought bitterly while shooting for Sarfarosh, as Aamir felt that Naseer wasn’t taking his work seriously, but that was just Naseer’s usual attitude towards mainstream films. But Naseer had great respect for Aamir as the only producer in Bollywood who gave importance to the quality of his films rather than making money. Naseer had also disowned all his parallel films including Paar, when he saw art film directors working in the mainstream with big stars.\n\nBtw the remake of Dostana was called “Sattam” in Tamil\n\nNaseer and Aamir fought bitterly while shooting for Sarfarosh,\n\nI don’t know about them fighting ‘bitterly’ because neither man is prone to behaving that way, but yes, they didn’t shoot together. Not even for one scene. Every scene of theirs was shot separately and spliced together at editing stage.\n\n@Madan, I thought Sarfarosh was the one film which didn’t fall into the jingoism trap. Sure, they named Pakistan outright for fomenting terror in India – which films didn’t until then, preferring to euphemistically call it ‘hamaare padosi mulk – but there was an acknowledgement that Indians who helped them out of greed (or whatever) were equally culpable. I also liked the attention paid to how Muslims are treated – Mukesh Rishi’s character was extremely nuanced, not the token Muslim at all. It was interesting to see the subject treated seriously but without the usual ‘Blame Pakistan for all our ills’ and chest-thumping that you usually see in films.\n\nNasir has been extremely honest in his autobiography – he had said that a lot of his ire towards AB is because he wanted to be him, but couldn’t master the beats of mainstream cinema. He’s – to use a phrase popular on social media – ‘complicated’.\n\nAnu Warrier: Well, Sarfarosh was definitely a lot better than the median Bollywood level of jingoism which is why I said it was in there here and there. I didn’t like bits like the mulk scene where the Aamir character says in a very tone deaf way that the mulk needs more like Mukesh Rishi at which point Mukesh schools him. And the crux of the plot itself was an uncomfortable insinuation that Mehdi Hassan curried favour for Pakistan because there are too many similarities between him and Ghulfam Hassan (the name itself is a clumsy composite of Ghulam Ali and Mehdi Hassan). Nothing ever came up, not even in the form of rumours, to suggests Mehdi did so and he had his admirers in India for many years after the film, still does. So I didn’t get what that angle of a ghazal singer being a spy in disguise was all about. Maybe had the makers not left such blatant references to real Pak ghazal singers, I would have accepted that premise as simply fiction. But the way it was done, they made it look like they had some hot take that they had had to disguise to avoid defamation when it was more likely based on just a run-of-the-mill conspiracy theory.\n\n@Madan: where the Aamir character says in a very tone deaf way that the mulk needs more like Mukesh Rishi at which point Mukesh schools him.\n\nBut I think the point was to emphasise what Mukesh tells him – most people are like Aamir in the movie, tarring every single Muslim with the same brush. That scene was set up so Mukesh could make a very pertinent point.\n\nI didn’t know – and have never read – about Ghulam Hassan being a stand-in for Mehdi Hassan. Ever. And the fact that Mehdi Hassan continued to be beloved on both sides of the border is testimony that no one made that connection either. So where/when did this conspiracy theory come from, I wonder.\n\nThe only singer I know who was accused of spying for the Pakistani government was Adnan Sami in recent times, though strangely enough Dilip Kumar was accused of working for the Pakistanis, poor guy!\n\n@MANK – Nasir said so in an interview. In fact, he stated that he didn’t know what the problem was that Aamir had (“You should ask him.”) but they didn’t shot a single scene together.\n\nI don’t usually pay attention to the stars’ personal lives but whatever the reason for the divorce, I wouldn’t say ‘Poor Kiran’. They seem to be a very sorted couple and given that even Reena is still a part of the family, I think they have their own reasons for their decision. If infidelity was the issue, I doubt Kiran would still be holding hands with him and holidaying together or whatever it is they are doing. Infidelity was not the reason for the Aamir-Reena breakup either.\n\n[On a tangent (and NOT directed at MANK, though I’m riffing off his comment), it’s ironic how a divorce means someone’s ‘personal life is a mess’ but staying in a marriage that has outlived its use is heralded as a great achievement, and never mind if the couple don’t have anything to say to each other in private or have serious dysfunction.]\n\nNever knew that Nasser had problem working with Aamir as well!!!! Man, if you have problems working with an intelligent, sincere guy like Aamir, then surely the fault lies with you. There cannot be a person as dedicated, sincere, and simple and earthy as Aamir in the Bombay film industry, after Amit of course — sometimes Amit loses his brains over some twitter followers’ count LOL … but at his age, he can be forgiven for that. BTW, off-topic, Shatru never liked working with Amit. His bombastic ego mentions that it was Amit getting jealous of Shatru getting more seetis and claps LOL. The actual reason was that Amit, being the punctuality-machine that he is, hated the fact that Shatru came to to the sets as late as by 6 hours! For a 6 AM shoot, he used to come by 2 pm; for the 2nd shift – and everybody had to wait!! There was once an article in THE ILLUSTRATED WEEKLY as to how spot-boys, the camera-men, and folks behind the scenes used to LOVE working with Amit; because he respected everyone’s time! They had to catch the local back to Kurla or wherever; with Amit, it was possible but with people like Rajesh Khanna and Shatru, they had to sleep overnight in the studios with mosquitoes for company rather than their wives!\n\nAamir had problems with Kajol. She was also considered highly undisciplined though folks considered her spontaneous and what not. Hence the pairing of Aamir and Kajol worked big time in an otherwise avoidable film FANAA and it went on to be a block-buster.\n\nAamir is fantastic in the way he single-handedly changed the thought-process of the industry. I do not like his style of approach – working in 1 movie at a time. That, to me, indicates a limitation on his part in terms of talent. But as an artiste, he is a genius. Inspite of fiascos like MELA, D3 [which made close to 250 crores though he was horrifically unfit for that role] and the much hated TOH [I still don’t get the extreme criticism it received.]\n\nThe other mistake that Aamir did was not working for 4 years after the HIGHS of Lagaan and DCH. Now those 2 films were as different as chalk and cheese and Aamir excelled in both. [He was initially given the role of Akshay”s since Aamir looked the ‘thinking’ part but Aamir convinced Farhan that he wanted to work against the type.] And those 4 years when Aamir was drinking a lot thanks to his divorce was where Sallu helped him and stopped him from turning into an alcoholic. In the mean-time, SRK made hay for those 4 years. Except for a mild threat from HR in 2000, SRK was ruling the kingdom alone. I cannot guess how, but I think it would have been a different story if Aamir was active at that time with SRK.\n\nit’s ironic how a divorce means someone’s ‘personal life is a mess’ but staying in a marriage that has outlived its use is heralded as a great achievement, and never mind if the couple don’t have anything to say to each other in private or have serious dysfunction.\n\nI know , and not denying what you said, i think both situations are messy or painful or whatever term you use to put it. A divorce, however cordial, does messes up ones life and it is hard to get over, even if it is putting behind a marriage that has outlived its utility IMHO . About Aamir’s infidelity or adultery, one does get to hear a lot of stories on the grapevine as well as friends in the media and so on. Of course, i don’t know Aamir or Kiran personally to know what led to the divorce, only they know for sure.\n\n“I didn’t know – and have never read – about Ghulam Hassan being a stand-in for Mehdi Hassan. ” – I haven’t read about the connection anywhere. But as I said, the way the character is named and the similarities between him and Mehdi – both were forced to leave India during partition for a life of poverty made the connection undeniable. So it seemed like just carelessly naming the character to make it possible to associate him with a real life ghazal singer without there necessarily being anything behind it, which is what I found annoying.\n\nRe Shabana, I wouldn’t call any of them art films but I would also only call Tehzeeb and Mrityudand commercial. The rest were middle cinema. And all these films also came when she was much older and was cast in elderly character actor roles. In the 80s, when she was eligible for lead roles (sorry to have to put it that way), she stayed more on the parallel beat.\n\nI think she was very uncomfortable doing ‘masala’ films. In that sense, Shabana, who cut her eye teeth in ‘middle cinema’ became more comfortable within the masala universe. She seemed to be having a lot of fun in Parvarish, for instance.\n\nYes, exactly what i wanted to say too: she and Neetu were great as the conning sisters in Parvarish, Also, Amar Akbar Anthony and Brangan’s favorite Fakira with that catfight for all ages with Aruna Irani 🙂 . Hell she was even one third of the Indian Charlie’s angels with Parveen and Zeenat in Ashanti. She was also Rajesh Khanna’s lucky heroine for a while there in his second coming with movies like Avatar, Thodisi Bewafai, Amrit and so on. She understood masala cinema better than any of her parallel cinema colleagues IMO.\n\nAlso, Shabana was really funny in films like Mandi, Namkeen and so on , i don’t think Smita ever became comfortable with comedy. Though Smita is terrific in delivering power packed intensity as in Bhumika, etc, For me Shabana Azmi was always the all round great actress and i would place her above Smita Patil .\n\nAnJo – I’ve never understood the hype around Kaajol. I find her performances very, very loud. And yes, she’s (or was, at least; I can’t speak for the present) very, very badly behaved. Personally witnessed that so I can vouch for it.\n\nPerformance wise, I prefer the other Mukherjee – Rani.\n\nRe: Aamir – I disagree that doing only one film a year is a limitation of his talent. For someone of his stature to not make hay while the sun shines (another AK comes to mind, who reminds me why Raj Kapoor called his brother ‘Taxi Kapoor’), is amazing. I’d much rather see Aamir in one good movie a year (and whatever issues you may have with his films, they are still rather decent ones) than in four or five indifferent ones.\n\nRe: Thugs of Hindostan – you, MANK and I are the only ones who seem to have liked that film. 😀 I do wish they had left Aamir’s character as the morally ambivalent one he is at the beginning. He was good!\n\n@Madan – knowing how the film industry works, I doubt there was any such deeper meaning there. 😀 The script writer must have thought – “Ghazal singer = Muslim” and then picked the two ‘Muslim’ singers he knew about. 😀\n\nYour point about Shabana – I agree and disagree at the same time. 🙂 (How’s that for fence-straddling?) You’re right that at her peak she acted mostly in middle and art-house cinema. But as MANK points out, Ashanti was not an anomaly. She made the transition way more easily than Smita did.\n\nOriginally when I watched Parvarish long ago, I felt Shabana was a misfit. But I recently watched the movie and I have warmed up to her. You’re right, MANK and Anu, she and Neetu were great as the con-sisters and seemed to be having fun. Did you notice during the scene where she’s chased by cops, she jumps in the air and runs away like one of those silent film actors/vintage cartoon characters? I read somewhere she said she was open to trying new things and didn’t want to be confined to just parallel cinema, so she did films like Fakira, AAA, Parvarish and Ashanti to name a few. She definitely understood and fit in better in the masala cinema than the other parallel cinema colleagues with the exception of Amrish Puri who transitioned better than all of them.\n\nSpeaking of Amrish Puri, I was watching some of his films where he played positive roles and he was magnificent. I won’t compare his role in Virasat to Sivaji in Thevar Magan, but as a standalone performance, he was heartbreaking especially during the panchayat scene where he’s humiliated and the scene where he is practically begging Anil Kapoor to stay. Perhaps had DK played Raja Thakur, it would have made a different impact or could have become a long drawn out self-indulgent monologue? I heard after Dilip rejected the role, it was offered to Raaj Kumar, Rajesh Khanna (I can never see him in that role) and Naseer (who hated the script), before Amrish took it. Had he been alive, my choice for the role would have been Sanjeev Kumar. Also, I wonder how Amitabh would have played Raja Thakur if it was offered to him.\n\nWRT Naseer, he’s a washed-up has been. I don’t take any of what he says seriously. He is very predictable nowadays in his acting; I know exactly how he’s going to approach a role/what gesture he’s going to use/etc. I don’t care if he hates everyone in the film industry spouting the same old shit over and over again and believing he belongs to an acting universe Gary Oldman and others can’t reach (sorry for stealing that line, Madan); to me he has not given any great performance for a long time. He can learn a thing or two (which of course he won’t) from Anant Nag, his fellow parallel cinema colleague who is still able to give excellent performances today without being repetitive or predictable. And the latter has handled his career better than any of the parallel cinema guys with all the new gen directors/actors giving him meaty roles today! I for one am looking forward to Rishab Shetty’s Rudraprayag where Anant plays the title role!\n\nAman, I think Smita is stunning to look at. But honestly, her work in the ‘art’ cinema always felt more ‘authentic’ (for want of a better term) than any of her outings in mainstream cinema. She was woefully miscast in Namak Halal, and I can definitely see her cringing at the role. It is very visible in her performance. It’s funny how two of her three ‘bold’ scenes were with Big B – the unbridled sexuality of Aaj rapat jaaye and the love-making scene in Shakti, where, for a change, I thought AB looked uncomfortable.\n\nYou’re also right about AAA – but that’s because, as Shabana said, MD called her at the last minute and asked if she would step in as Vinod Khanna’s pair. He told her quite frankly that she had no role in the film, but that ‘Vinod will eat my brains if he doesn’t have a heroine.” So she happily signed on, because she and Vinod were friends. (She’s often remarked how comfortable he made her when she first came in to films, and how solicitous he was about not doing anything that would make her uncomfortable.)\n\nJayaram, indeed. 🙂 I loved the both the girls in Parvarish. They seemed to be enjoying themselves and that enjoyment translated on screen. And you are very right about her understanding the medium of ‘masala’ cinema. I think she and Om were the ones who caught the sur of the ‘masalaverse’ the best (apart from Amrish Puri, that is).\n\nWith Naseer, I think it was always a case of standing out, looking in. He desperately wanted to be part of that universe, but he never did quite fit in. And he was very angry that others could/did. He admitted as much in his memoirs. I love his theatre work, but you’re right that he hasn’t given a really great performance in a long time – but I loved him in Ishqiya and even in the small cameos in Jaane Tu.., Ya Jaane Na and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. And recently, loved him in both Mee Raqsam and Bandish Bandits.\n\n@MANK – sharing your love for Sanjeev Kumar. Though I disagree about your summation of Sunghursh. 🙂 I do agree that SK was rather decent in one of his initial roles – and a negative one, at that, but the film itself was a slog, and it was only DK who kept me awake. Balraj Sahni probably signed on for the pay cheque because he sleepwalked through the film; indeed, I think he had his first speaking line well into the last third of the film.\n\nVyjayanthimala, by then, was ready to quit films – the failure of Amrapali in 1966 had hit her hard. It was her dream project and when it flopped (it shouldn’t have – it’s a fabulous film!), she completed her remaining assignments and got out of the industry. The handful of films she appeared in after ’66 were all signed beforehand. In fact, Dharmendra said she didn’t exchange a word with him during the shooting of Pyar Hi Pyar. and Vijay Anand complained about her total detachment during the shooting of Jewel Thief as well.\n\nAnu, I didn’t like Naseer in Bandish Bandits. I felt he was sleepwalking throughout the series and only gave a few glimpses of the great actor he once was. Vikram Gokhale would have been a better fit. Plus BB was a huge let down given the hype and I couldn’t connect to any of the characters.\n\nYet, there is a 2015 Marathi movie, Katyar Kaljat Ghusali starring Sachin and Shankar Mahadevan which BB is based off of and SEL are the music composers. I have heard some of the songs from the soundtrack and they’re much better than BB. I would like to watch the movie when I get a chance.\n\nFrom what little I have seen of Vyjayanthimala’s Amrapali, she was gorgeous and it’s a shame it flopped.\n\nGetting to Sanjeev, he’s my favorite Hindi cinema actor and not a “one trick pony”. Whenever I watch his movies, I am transfixed. I have loved his collaborations with Gulzar; Angoor is my personal favorite out of all of them. He was one of those great artists who always had the audience in mind; he made us part of the journey and he could just mesmerize us. I just wish that he didn’t pass away so early, but due to his genetic heart condition, he knew he wouldn’t live long.\n\nI’ve come up with a small list of roles I would have loved to see SK portray had he lived today:\n\nRajeshwar Singh in Saudagar (where he’d own DK once more). He could play Mandaari and even Chuniya (if Ghai decided to go for broke and cast him as the villain instead of Amrish Puri)\n\nRaja Thakur in Virasat (see the above comments)\n\nDibyanath Chatterjee in Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa (he would reunite with Jaya)\n\nGhulam Hussan in Sarfarosh\n\nRaja in Lagaan\n\nTabu’s father in Cheeni Kum\n\nA small, but impactful role in Rang De Basanti or Delhi-6\n\nAnanth Iyengar in Mission Mangal (that’s a bit of stretch and no disrespect to HG Dattatreya)\n\nAnyway this is just imagination and many of the regulars here will snap me back to reality. Having said that, does anyone want to add to the list?\n\nJayaram, I love SK and I too, wish he hadn’t left us so soon. I’m not really sure he would have fit Gulfam Hassan in Sarfarosh. I just can’t visualise him in that role.\n\nCheeni Kum is a film that makes me want to dig my eyeballs out with a blunt fork. R Balki makes me want to commit harakiri. On the face of it, such ‘progressive’ themes. They are all underlined by such regressive undertones that I want to really meet Balki and ask him what his problem is. (And don’t get me started on the little girl called ‘Sexy’ or AB’s problematic dialogue towards the end where he tells Tabu that his ‘Sexy’ has come back to him.)\n\nI agree that SK would have done a great job as the father. But I wonder why he would have done it – it was a ridiculous role.\n\n@AnJo, I saw that tweet. 🙂"
