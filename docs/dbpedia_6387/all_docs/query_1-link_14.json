The film is based on the real story of the labour movement in india of 1942-43. Dilip kumar recalls fond memories of how the film came about - I first came across Tapan Sinha in the early 60s. He was the proverbial bhadralok (gentleman) Bengali, who spoke less and believed in working silently. Though he possessed thorough knowledge of cinema, he was the last person to show off.",
