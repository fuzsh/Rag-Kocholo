        "text": "Legendary actor Sharmila Tagore recalled her experiences of working with filmmaker Tapan Sinha at a discussion with author and Silhouette editor Amitava Nag and editor Shantanu Ray Chaudhuri\n\nLegendary actor Sharmila Tagore recalled her experiences of working with master filmmaker Tapan Sinha, whom she fondly addressed as ‘Tapan Kaku’ and her costars of Bengali cinema, at a discussion with author and Silhouette editor Amitava Nag and editor Shantanu Ray Chaudhuri today at an evening dedicated to celebrating the cinema of Tapan Sinha and the golden era of Bengali cinema.\n\nThe event was organised jointly by Om Books International, Kunzum Books, Blue Pencil and New Delhi Film Foundation at Kunzum, GK-2, New Delhi. A commemorative poster on Tapan Sinha was released on the occasion and Nirjan Saikate, the Tapan Sinha masterpiece starring Sharmila Tagore was screened.\n\nTapan Sinha was a very learned person, recalled Sharmila Tagore, “very soft spoken, you had to strain your ears to hear him.” Elaborating that Sinha was highly respected for his work across the film industry, Sharmila Tagore mentioned it is not easy to convince someone like Dilip Kumar to go and work in a Bengali-Hindi bilingual film (Sagina Mahato). “He never got angry or raised his voice,” she said.\n\nSharmila Tagore recalled how Tapan Sinha’s films celebrated humanism and relationships. Giving the example of Nirjan Saikate, Sharmila Tagore said that in this film Sinha shows how the 4 Bengali widows, who have been deprived from all joys of living, suddenly experience liberation when they meet the sea. Amitava Nag added that although it is said no two films of Tapan Sinha are same, the common thread that runs through all of them is the celebration of the human spirit – the refusal of the protagonist to die defeated such as Banchharam (Manoj Mitra) in Banchharamer Bagan and the teacher (Soumitra Chatterjee) in Aatanka.\n\nSharmila Tagore also recalled her fond memories of working with Soumitra Chatterjee, Shubhendu Chatterjee and Rabi Ghosh among others. Films nowadays are not made the way they were made then, money is the benchmark now, she said.\n\nRecalling Soumitra’s portrayal of Mayurbahan in Jhinder Bandi, Shantanu talked about how Soumitra could get under the skin of the character to leave an indelible mark. Sharmila Tagore added that Soumitra would slide into the character when he would start applying the makeup for the shoot. “He always supported me and stood up for me whenever there was any criticism against me,” she said.\n\nSharmila Tagore and Amitava emphasized that Tapan Sinha, like Ray, was a director who was structured and organized in the way he worked on his projects, keeping within budget and paying his crew in time.\n\nBlue Pencil’s books on cinema and other genres were displayed at the event by Kunzum books.\n\nWatch this space for more reports on the event.\n\nMedia Coverage of the Event\n\nMore Must Read on Silhouette\n\nTapan Sinha and the Triumvirate of Bengali Cinema\n\nNever Have I Made the Same Kind of Film: An Interview With Tapan Sinha (Part-I)\n\nI’d Never Allow My Mind To Gather The Moss Of Stagnation: An Interview With Tapan Sinha (Part-II)\n\nI Cherish A Thrill For Adventure: An Interview With Tapan Sinha (Part-III)\n\nI Am A Worshipper Of All Things Beautiful: An Interview With Tapan Sinha (Part-IV)\n\nIt is the centenary year of renowned filmmaker Tapan Sinha, “an underrated and often-neglected auteur”, and it is time to revisit his films and their indelible impact. Om Books International, Blue Pencil, Kunzum Books , and New Delhi Film Foundation, have joined hands to host an enlightening evening with legendary actress Sharmila Tagore, who will be discussing the films of Tapan Sinha and the golden era of Bengali cinema with author and film critic Amitava Nag and noted editor Shantanu Ray Chaudhuri. The event will be held in Kunzum, M-Block Market, Greater Kailash-2, New Delhi on 13th March 2024 at 4 pm.\n\nAmitava Nag’s The Cinema of Tapan Sinha, An Introduction book provides a succinct introduction to the cinema of Tapan Sinha and the significant place he holds in Bengali and, indeed, Indian cinema. With characteristic erudition, Nag explores Sinha’s deep roots in the Bengali cultural climate, mainly music and literature, and how they shaped his cinematic storytelling. Read an excerpt from a chapter in the book on Silhouette.\n\nSharmila Tagore worked with Tapan Sinha in the master’s award-winning film Nirjan Saikate, which will be screened on the occasion.\n\nIf one were to wonder what makes cine maestro Tapan Sinha’s films a cut above the rest, it is their sheer simplicity and innocuous manner of storytelling – a straight, uncomplicated narrative structure that slowly grows on you, excellent use of background score that create moods and an unobtrusive technique that stays carefully away from over-dramatisation, relying instead on subtle symbols and immaculate characterisation. His films not only received both critical and popular acclaim, they did well financially and went on to inspire other filmmakers.\n\nSinha largely drew his story ideas from celebrated literary works or real-life incidents, which is why his characters were so very identifiable. They reacted to situations as any of us would and yet went on to meet challenges in a way that set inspiring examples for others.\n\nAmitava Nag’s books on cinema have chronicled, critiqued and curated various aspects of Bengali cinema. His trilogy on Soumitra Chatterjee comprising Beyond Apu – 20 Favourite Film Roles of Soumitra Chatterjee (HarperCollins India), Murmurs: Silent Steals with Soumitra Chatterjee (Blue Pencil) and Soumitra Chatterjee: His Life in Cinema and Beyond (Speaking Tiger) gives cine lovers rare and deep insights into the life, works and thought processes of the iconic actor. One of his latest books is The Cinema of Mrinal Sen: A Quest for the Unresolved (Blue Pencil).\n\nAmitava Nag has authored several other books on cinema and poetry.

The popular belief was that if an Indian or international publication is not available in this bookstore, then it is unlikely to be available anywhere else in India! From the National Library to the top university and college libraries are Dagupta’s customers apart from regular book lovers.\n\nIn the picture: the genial, helpful Arabinda Dasgupta, son of Amulya Chandra, at the counter of this 137-year-old 3-storey bookstore which stores some 70,000 odd books!\n\n(Info courtesy: Dasgupta & Co. Private Ltd. College Street, College Square (Phone: 033-22414609 ), Kolkata.\n\n(Pic courtesy: Blue Pencil team)\n\nBlue Pencil’s publications available at Dasgupta and Company include\n\n* Murmurs: Silent Steals with Soumitra Chatterjee\n\n* Incomparable Sachin Dev Burman\n\n* The Unforgettable Music of Hemant Kumar\n\n* Majrooh Sultanpuri: The Poet For All Reasons\n\n* Reflections & Stray Thoughts\n\nHave you got your copy yet? 😊🙏\n\nIt is not an easy task to hook the reader with stream of consciousness words, phrases, sentences through 90 pages and 19 chapters. Amitava Nag’s book Murmurs: Moments with Soumitra Chatterjee succeeds in keeping his reader hooked as he weaves an abstract tapestry with fragments of memory around the author’s numerous engagements with Soumitra Chatterjee.\n\nHe succeeds in capturing unspoken thoughts, suppressed sighs, internalized monologues of the ageing actor, thespian, poet and painter as he sits in his ‘garage turned into a study – low roof and basic’. Shifting lights and changing season outside blend with the swirling coffee in slow motion as unspoken words hang heavy in the still air inside the room. As Soumitra copes with his failing health and aching body, he articulates his unfulfilled aspiration, ‘But Amitava, I still would have loved to be a Sir Garfield Sobers’.\n\nAmitava Nag’s impressionistic recounts in Murmurs are intimate and bereft of eulogy. He is neither overwhelmed, nor judgmental. His observant eye catches every fleeting shadow on the actor’s countenance and reads into every turn of his head and torso. Through the nineteen chapters, each of which is a well crafted work of art, Soumitra Chatterjee’s soul is revealed to the readers. A must read not only for the admirers of the thespian, but also for admirers of experimental literary work.\n\n—————\n\nSubha Das Mollick is a media teacher and a documentary filmmaker.
