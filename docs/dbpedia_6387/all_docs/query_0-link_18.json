        "text": "Born in 1924, a Science graduate from University of Calcutta, Sinha began his film career as a sound engineer in Calcutta's New Theatre in 1946. In his youth, Tapan Sinha was greatly influenced by contemporary American and British Cinema. It is primarily Charles Dicken's novel \"A Tale of Two Cities\" and the cinematic version of this novel featuring Ronald Colman prompted Sinha to join films. He went to London in 1950s to learn filmmaking. On reaching London, he contacted Mr. Cry Hearsth, Manager of Pinewood Studios. Through his help, he managed to bag his first assignment. He worked under Director Charles Cryton's unit as Sound Engineer.\n\nRabindranath Tagore's work had been a great source of inspiration to him. He made three films on Tagore's stories : Kabuliwala, Hungry Stones (Khudito Pashan) , Atithi. On returning to India, he turned his attentions to film directing. Rabindranath Tagore's work had been a great source of inspiration to him. He made three films on Tagore's stories : Kabuliwala, Hungry Stones (Khudito Pashan) , Atithi. On returning to India, he turned his attentions to film directing.\n\nTapan Sinha's first film 'Ankush' was based on Narayan Gangopadhyay's story 'Sainik' having an elephant in the central character. His next films were 'Uphaar' and 'Aadhar Periye'. Tapan Sinha's 'Hatey Bazare' was based on an autobiographical story of Banophool, featuring a selfless doctor and his patients and peoples of a remote village. His 'Ek Je Chilo Desh' was a fine fantasy film based on a story by Sankar. It was about a mad scientist who discovered a drug that could reveal the past dishonest life of an individual. Tapan Sinha's 'Louho Kopat' deales with the prisonlife while his 'Sabuj Deeper Raja' was a ditective childrens' film. Tapan Sinha's 'Hansuli Banker Upakatha' was another significant film. In 1957, his film 'Kabuliwala' was shown in Berlin Film festival and received Music Award there. He was honoured with National award many times. He was a person with a child's heart is reflected in films like 'Galpo Holeo Satti, a fine satirical film, Harmonium and Safed Hathi.\n\nThough Sinha's 'Zindagi Zindagi' fared badly before the mass audience, his 'Atithe' (possibly based on the life of Rabindranath Tagore), Tonsil (a fine comedy film) or 'Jhinder Bandi (a desi PRISONER OF ZENDA) were altime favourites. Tapan Sinha's 'Khoniker Atithi', again a story of Tagore and 'Arohi' tells the story of an elderly person who had a tremendous zest for learning were remarkable films. Tapan Sinha's 'Sagina Mahato' was a coolie who couldn't see the oppressed being done injustices, and later rises to be their leader. Tapan Sinha's 'Kalamati' was the first film to deal with life in cr√®ches in coalmine areas. Made in 1957, it was a film made much ahead of its times. Sinha's 'Raja' was the story of an unemployed youth who sees so much of evil, injustice and poverty around him. His 'Apanjan' was a beautiful story of young unemployed youths focused on a movement similar to Naxalism in later days.\n\nTapan Sinha's 'Nirjan Saikate' reflects his belief that widows have a right to get married. Tapan Sinha's 'Bancharamer Bagan' is Chaplinesque in its approach. The film depicts the tragedy of a small man in this big world. Sinha's 'Khudito Pasan' was once again a story by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore. His 'Jatugriho' deals the subject of marital discord with more finesse that has rarely been dealt in Indian films.\n\nTapan Sinha's 'Atanka', based on true facts of crime as its storyline. His 'Aadmi Aur Aurat' or 'Ek Doctor Ki Maut' were two of his sensitive works. The later won the Rajat Kamal for the second best feature film of the year, besides earning him the Best Directors Award. Tapan Sinha's 'Wheel Chair' was inspired by the life of a crusading doctor. Tapan Sinha's 'Adalat O Ekti Mey' and 'Antardhan' dealt with the subject of crime against women. Tapan Sinha's 'Boydurya Rahasya' was a detective film.\n\nTapan Sinha's 'Aaj Ka Robinhood', a children's film funded partly by the Govt. and a producer Mr Jalan, has been screened at the maximum number of International film festivals at Tashkent, Berlin, Sofia and others. This is a 1987 film where Tapan Sinha has returned to his favorite world of children with this Hindi film. Simplistic it may sound, but the concern over social evils is brought out in a vibrant way in Sinha's films. Tapan Sinha made a few documentaries, and one such was a biographical film on scientist Jagadish Bose.\n\nTapan Sinha has shifted his attention to the small screen for the first time in 1996. He made a film called 'Daughter of the Century' based on a Tagore story besides stories of notable Bengali writers whose writings have always been the backbone of his other films. Tapan Sinha made a TV Serial (detective genre) 'Hutumer Naksa' . 'Aajab Gayer Aajab Katha' is a semi-fantasy designed for all, including children. Tapan Sinha's latest venture, 'Anokha Moti', is being made by the Director in the new millennium is a film made for children."
