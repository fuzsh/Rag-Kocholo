        "text": "Oregon Voter Magazine December 27, 1930\n\nState Representative Lee McAllister\n\nRather an enigma in capacity, capabilities; pleasant, inclined toward the opinionated type. We can't figure out whether he was originally elected due to similarity of his name with name of a former representative of Marion county, now a state appointive officer, or whether in his campaigning there was an outcropping of personality that may have been moderately submerged in the 1929, his first, legislature. Contributed little to House debates, since his talents had been directed along engineering (later, insurance) lines, not public speaking. Gave consistent but not highly influential service on three important committees, Forestry, Autos & Roads, Insurance. Probably a member in whom seasoning will bring to surface more positive traits. Native of Salem, born Feb. 22, 1895; Willamette and OSC, graduating in CE; overseas veteran; married, three sons; Elk, Mason, Legion.\n\nPortland Oregonian June 30, 1963\n\nPolk Property Owners OK Irrigation District - McAllister Honored\n\nSALEM (Special) - Polk County property owners approved the multi-million dollar Monmouth-Dallas Irrigation District 194 to 15 Friday in an all-day election held at Polk County Fairgrounds at Rickreall. Results of the election came in time to honor Lee McAllister, area engineer for the Bureau of Reclamation, who planned the district. McAllister was being honored at a retirement party at Marion Motor Hotel when election results were telephoned to John Hansen, Polk County extension agent at the party. Friend and fellow workers from Washington, D.C., from Washington State, the regional office at Boise, Idaho and from throughout Oregon came to the party to pay tribute to McAllister following his 41 years in public service. Included in the group was W.I. Palmer, assistant commissioner from Washington, D.C. who in his brief talk announced that McAllister will probably before long be asked to assist as a consulting engineer in one of the foreign projects over which Palmer has supervision. McAllister will stay with the bureau as part time consulting engineer, it was also announced. In speaking of the Polk County district, Hansen said 277 farms comprising 17,234 acres will be served by additional irrigation water if the project received final approval from Washington officials.\n\nThe Death of Lee Anthony McAllister Jr.\n\nOn 10 Dec 1944, Nell and Lee's son, Lt. Lee Anthony McAllister Jr., had his B-25 hit by anti-aircraft fire while trying to bomb a railroad bridge at Dolce, Italy. He bailed out of his plane and was cared for by local families until he was captured by the Germans and executed on 9 January 1945. These two articles by Maurizio Dal Lago and Giuseppe Versolato tell the story of that tragic event.\n\nThe McAllister Case\n\nMissing in Action: The McAllister Case"
