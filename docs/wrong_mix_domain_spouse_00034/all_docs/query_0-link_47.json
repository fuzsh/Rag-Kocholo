        "text": "ENGLAND\n\nGeographical locations in England have unique, interesting terms in county sub-divisions, according to Shirley Irvine. Three mention dioceses, and Yorkshire has its 'ridings' --- North, East, and West. Some counties are divided into Hun-dreds.\n\nHundreds were subdivisions of shires and counties, each with its own court. They were judicial, military, and taxation units that emerged before William the Conqueror. Domesday Book is arranged by counties and hundreds.\n\nSize of the hundreds varied, but the basis for drawing up the hundreds of a county was pretty much the same everywhere. It was an area that was comprised of one hundred families, or one hundred 'hides.' A hide [also known as a carucate] was a measure of land--the amount required by one free family and its dependents. This amount of land was defined in turn as that which could be tilled by one plough and a team of oxen in one year.\n\nThe hundred was a practical division of local administration for a very long time. Genealogists encounter hundreds in directories; they are listed in the county sections within Samuel Lewis' Topographical Dictionary of England; they appear on maps. Among the records arranged this way are hearth taxes in the late 1600s and militia records of the 1700s.\n\nThis ancient division is not found in every county. The four extreme northern counties of Cumberland, Westmorland, Durham, and Northumberland, were broken up into wards. On the eastern side of England, the equivalent of a hundred is the wapentake, a term which the Danes brought with them. Wap-entakes are found in Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Rutland, and Yorkshire.\n\nIn several counties the hundred [or the wapentake] is a sub-division of a unit that falls between it and the county. York-shire has its ridings, Lincolnshire has three divisions [Lindsey, Kestevan and Holland]; in the southeast, Kent has 62 hundreds within 5 'lathes' and Sussex has 66 hundreds within 6 'rapes.'\n\nLancashire had six hundreds. Cornwall had nine hundreds, Essex had twenty, and Norfolk had thirty-three. The smaller divisions reflect the larger number of people per square mile and the greater fertility of the land.\n\nThe Parish records--primarily births, baptisms, marriages, and burials--provide the best source of vital record information in the centuries before civil registration.\n\nSherry Irvine, CGRS, FSA has written an informative book on effectively using the census returns of Great Britain. She wrote:\n\nApart from minor differences in supplementary details, the census returns for 1851 through 1891 provide the following:\n\n~ Address or location\n\n~ Name of each person in the household\n\n~ Marital status\n\n~ Sex\n\n~ Relationship to the head of the household\n\n~ Age\n\n~ Occupation\n\n~ Birthplace\n\nHowever, the first nominal census [1841] is different and less informative. Missing from these returns are relationships, accurate ages, and precise birthplace details. What they record is:\n\n~ Address or location\n\n~ Name of each person in the household\n\n~ Age rounded down to the nearest five years for adults\n\n[this confused people and compounded fibs]\n\n~ Exact age for children under 15\n\n~ Occupation\n\n~ A vague answer to the question \"were you born in the\n\ncounty?\" which in England meant noting Y [yes], N\n\n[no], S [Scotland], I [Ireland), Pts [foreign parts;\n\npoints]\n\nSeveral clues distinguish one household from another: hash marks made by the enumerators [when at the left edge of a name, a double backslash is a new building and a single one separates family units in the same building]; 1851 and after, a new number in the extreme left column [No. of Householder's Schedule]; 1851 and after, the appearance of the word \"Head\" in the Relationship column.\n\n==O==\n\nCapt. George Thomas Gowen, commanding officer of the 27th Native Infantry Regiment of the East India Company Service was killed in the Indian revolt that occurred in the fall of 1857.\n\nHis name, along with a list of killed and wounded, was published in the October 10, 1857 edition of the Bombay Gazette:\n\nThe War in India,\n\nList of Killed and Wounded\n\nThe following is the list of persons connected with the East India Company's Service who were killed during the re-volt.\n\nThe East India Company had the unusual distinction of ruling an entire country. Its origins were much humbler. On December 31, 1600, a group of merchants who had incorporated themselves into the East India Company were given monopoly privileges on all trade with the East Indies.\n\nThe Company's ships first arrived in India, at the port of Surat, in 1608. Sir Thomas Roe reached the court of the Mughal Emperor, Jahangir, as the emissary of King James I in 1615, and gained for the British the right to establish a factory at Surat. Gradually the British eclipsed the Portugese and over the years they saw a massive expansion of their trading operations in India.\n\nNumerous trading posts were established along the east and west coasts of India, and considerable English communities developed around the three presidency towns of Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras. In 1717, the Company achieved its hitherto most notable success when it received a firman or royal dictat from the Mughal Emperor exempting the Company from the payment of custom duties in Bengal.\n\nThe Company saw the rise of its fortunes, and its transformation from a trading venture to a ruling enterprise, when one of its military officials, Robert Clive, defeated the forces of the Nawab of Bengal, Siraj-ud-daulah, at the Battle of Plassey in 1757. A few years later the Company acquired the right to collect revenues on behalf of the Mughal Emperor, but the initial years of its administration were calamitous for the people of Bengal. The Company's servants were largely a rapacious and self-aggrandizing lot, and the plunder of Bengal left the formerly rich province in a state of utter destitution.\n\nThe famine of 1769-70, which the Company's policies did nothing to alleviate, may have taken the lives of as many as a third of the population. The Company, despite the increase in trade and the revenues coming in from other sources, found itself burdened with massive military expenditures, and its destruction seemed imminent. State intervention put the ailing Company back on its feet, and Lord North's India Bill, also known as the Regulating Act of 1773, provided for greater parliamentary control over the affairs of the Company, besides placing India under the rule of a Governor-General.\n\n==O==\n\nG. Gowan, a 32-year-old waiter on the S.S. Lusitania, was among the 1,198 people who lost their lives when the British liner was torpedoed and sunk May 7, 1915. Many Americans were aboard the Lusitania when it was attacked by a German submarine, and the incident contributed to the entry into World War I by the United States.\n\nThe 32,000-ton ship was sailing on her regular run from New York to Liverpool, despite the war, with a full load of 1,959 passengers and a cargo containing some munitions. Her speed, 18 knots, was considered speedy at that time and was so much faster than the submarines of that era that a considerable amount of luck was required for the U-boat to get into torpedo range. Though she was only a few miles off the Irish coast, the Lusitania sank so quickly that lifeboats and liferafts could not be fully loaded and lowered.\n\n==O==\n\nJames Robert Gowen, secretary of the Royal Horticultural Society from 1845 to 1850, had a plant named for him. The Gowen Cypress, Goveniana Gord, a shrub or small tree, can be found in Europe, Asia and North America, according Dr. E. Clair \"Cal\" Calavan, University of California, Riverside.\n\n==O==\n\nJohn Goyne and Richard Goyne, \"born in the parts of the land of Luque,\" received denization [naturalization] by the king, 1st month, 17th day, 1452, according to an early record found in Westminster. Luque is located in southern Spain..\n\n==O==\n\nSir William Goyen, a knight, was buried \"8th month, 7th day, 1597.\"\n\nBERKSHIRE\n\nJohn Gowing of Berkshire was convicted of a crime and sentenced to transportation. In 1686 he was \"reprieved for transportation for Jamaica, Barbados or Bermuda.\"\n\n==O==\n\nChristopher d'Olier Gowan was born in 1910 in India, according to his obituary published August 13, 1996 in the London Daily Telegraph. He taught for 38 years at Eton College, the largest public school of England. It was founded by King Henry VI in 1440 for 70 highly qualified scholarship students and up to 20 boys in addition to the scholars. The 70 scholarships has remained fixed for the past 560 years.\n\nHis father was Governor of the Central Provinces. Gowan won a scholarship to Rugby and left as Head of School.\n\nHis obituary read:\n\nChristopher Gowan, who has died aged 85, spent most of his working life as a master at Eton. He taught there for 38 years and served as head of modern languages and as a housemaster. Although Gowan had taken a First in History at Oxford, he found there were no vacancies to teach his subject when in 1932 he wrote to Dr Cyril Alington, then the headmaster of Eton. None the less, Alington invited Gowan to lunch, and the result was that he was appointed to teach French for the time being, and told to spend the summer vacation in France brushing up the language.\n\nAs it turned out Gowan, though for a number of years the only man on the Eton staff with a First in History, never taught the subject. This may have saved his life. When the Second World War came, several of the young historians joined the infantry and were killed in the Western Desert. Gowan, being a linguist, became an intelligence officer and spent the war in headquarters in several countries.\n\nAfter Staff College training, initially under John Marsden, a former Eton pupil of his, Gowan was sent to the Middle East and in 1942 to GHQ Cairo. He later joined the \"Map Caravan\" with Bill Williams, Montgomery's Chief of Intelligence. He worked on the forward liaison units \"J\" and Phantom, responsible for reconnoitering and reporting forward troop and tank movement on both sides. For this work he was mentioned in despatches.\n\nAfter D-Day, Gowan went through Northern Europe with Montgomery at HQ 21st Army Group, ending the war in Berlin as a lieutenant-colonel. He always said how grateful he was for his war-time experience, feeling that it made him a much better schoolmaster.\n\nAt Hertford College, Oxford, he played most games and won a half-blue as a three-miler. On moving to Eton he had planned to marry Margaret McNair, the first New Zealand girl to graduate at Oxford. But Alington persuaded him to delay the marriage for a year to learn the ropes of schoolmastering.\n\nGowan's vigour of intellect and buccaneering personality soon brought him notice. In those days Eton masters wore silk hats and tailcoats on Sundays, and Gowan was unusual in sporting his hat at a jaunty angle.\n\nHe once surprised an insolent boy by offering to meet him in the ring, only to discover that the boy was soon to become Captain of Boxing. They fought three rounds and parted friends. Gowan was soon put in charge of school boxing. He was active also in modernising the coaching of athletics. At the time of his appointment, the School Mile was still run on a public road, which was closed to all traffic for the occasion.\n\nSoon after his return from the war, he took over as a housemaster in Cotton Hall House, and for 17 years Gowan's boys were a force to be reckoned with. On the games field they successfully reflected his intensely competitive spirit, and in the house they appreciated the family atmosphere. They were also impressed by the number of dinner-party guests invited to the Gowans' table, though they could not help wondering how the food compared with that served up to them.\n\nIn 1964 Tony Chenevix-Trench, the new headmaster, gave Gowan the chance to make his greatest contribution to Eton. He was invited to chair a new curriculum committee, which transformed the academic structure of the school. It led to a wider range of subjects, as well as the establishment of Geography, Economics and English departments.\n\nGowan's clarity of mind and grasp of detail were a great help to Chenevix-Trench, as well as being powerful assets in what he saw as a strategic campaign. He was not averse to challenging the traditional power of Classical masters, by as he put it, mining, sapping, diversions and flank attacks. Much of what his committee put in place still endures. Gowan was perhaps disappointed that no headmastership came his way.\n\nIn 1970 he retired to Windermere. He continued to be very active there, serving for 22 years on the committee of the YMCA camp at Lakeside. His diversions included fly-fishing and hill-walking. He was a notable grower of irises.\n\nGowan could be unsparing in criticism, but he was always gregarious and ebullient. His wife died shortly before they could celebrate their golden wedding; they had three daughters.\n\nCAMBRIDGESHIRE\n\nLt. John Gowan of the 30th Regiment [Cambridgeshire] of Foot served in the Battle of Waterloo against Napoleon Bonaparte under the command of Lt. Col. Alexander Hamilton, according to Tim Chadwick of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.\n\nCHESHIRE\n\nThe will of Gowen Duncalf of Adlington, Yeoman, was proved in 1737, according to the Cheshire Record Office. His beneficiary was Mary Wilson Wright, wife of Richard Wright and daughter of Joseph Wilson, a cousin.\n\nCORNWALL\n\nMentioned in \"Cornwall Muster Roll of 1569\" by H. L. Douch were \"Richard Gyan, St. Erne Parish, powder; Udy Gyen, St. Cullomb Parish; John Gyen, St. Cullomb Parish; Henry Gyen, St. Cullomb Parish; John Gyon, Penrybor Parish; Nyclis Gyon, Penybor Parish; Harry Geyne, Unylelant Parish, Perwith, George Gyne, Unylelant Parish, Perwith and Fraunces Gyne, Camborne Parish, Penwiyh.\n\n==O==\n\nFrancis Goyan was born in St. Agnes,Cornwall and came to the United States in 1840 with brothers John Goyan, James Goyan and William Goyan, according to Pamela Goyan Kitt-ler a descendant. John Goyne and Mary Ann Mitchell Goyne are regarded as their parents.\n\nFrancis Goyan became known as Frank Goyan and was a founder of of Placerville, California, arriving there about 1855.\n\n==O==\n\nPeter Goyen, son of Peter Goyen, a tin miner and Mary Ann Bawden Goyen, was born at St. Agnes, Cornwall in 1846. In 1853, his father left his family in Cornwall and emigrated to Australia, hoping to find better mining opportunities. After a six-month voyage, he arrived at his destination, and six years later he was able to send for his family.\n\nMary Ann Bawden Goyen, Peter, 13; Elizabeth, 11; John, 7 and Mary Jane, 6 arrived in Melbourne on the \"Red Jacket,\" 140 days out of Liverpool in August 1853. Peter Goyen was carried on the ship's passenger list as a \"laborer,\" indicating that child labor was an accepted practice in those early days.\n\nPeter Goyen was enrolled in St. James Church of England School on Flinders Street in Melbourne. Following gradua­tion, he went to Ballarat and entered teacher training while earning his living as an engine driver in the tin mines. He was married about 1868 to Mary Ann Skinner.\n\nHe first taught at Pigoreet School and then Talbot and Cam­brian Hill and Ballan. Tragically, Mary Ann Skinner Goyen died December 12, 1875, at age 21. Their six-year-old daughter, Elsie Helen Phillips Goyen died in the following spring, April 25, 1875, compounding his grief.\n\nPeter Goyen was remarried in Melbourne to Emilie Harriette Leete Smith, daughter of John Halcon Smith and Jane Bennetts Smith. Fortune then began to smile on the couple, and Peter Goyen was selected from a large group of appli­cants for the position of Inspector of Schools in New Zealand. They sailed immediately in the \"Albion\" for Dunedin where in 1882 he began his inspectoral duties.\n\nHe became well known as the author of a number of education works, among them being \"The Principles of English Composition,\" \"Higher Arithmetic and Mensuration\" and \"Companion to Higher Arithmetic.\" He also wrote some small useful education works and several papers on arachnida of New Zealand.\n\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London in 1888 and was an enthusiastic botanist and arachnologist. He died at age 81 in 1927 in Dunedin.\n\nI am enclosing [below] a copy of a newspaper account of a collision at sea involving my g-g-grandmother and her chil­dren while they were coming out in 1859 to join my g-g-grandfather already here. Robert J. Goyen, 523 Sutton St, Sebastopol, 3357, Victoria, Australia.\n\n==O==\n\nCollision at Sea--Loss of the Elizabeth Walker\n\nThe White Star ship Red Jacket arrived at Port Phillip Heads at sundown on Saturday and reached Hobson's Bay late yesterday evening. Her passage to the Equator occupied 28 days; thence to the Cape light and baffling winds. Capt. Kirby reports the loss of the Elizabeth Walker from collision with the Red Jacket. The following particulars were extracted from the log:\n\n\"June 13, lat. 30.40 S, long. 36.40 W at 1 a.m, clear moonlight, ship's course SE 1/2 S, rate of sailing 9 knots, all plain sail set and the port foretopmast stud­ding-sail, the man on the look-out reported a ship on the port bow. Orders were given by Mr. Robertson, officer of the watch, to show the port light. On as­certaining the tack and position of the ship the officer of the watch gave orders for the helm to be put to port, as the strange vessel was nearly on a parallel on the opposite tack to ourselves. The strange vessel then showed a flaming torchlight. At the same time, it was discovered that she had put her helm to starboard, and was keeping off the same as ourselves. The offi­cer of the watch seeing, by the two vessels continuing on the same course, that a collision would be in­evitable, ordered the helm of the Red Star to be put to starboard, with the view of passing under the stern of the strange vessel, and almost simultlaneously, the helm on board of the strange vessel was put to port, which luffed her across our bows, and a collision took place. Orders were immediately given to throw all aback. To describe the confusion among the passengers at the first shock is unnecessary; suffice it to say that the Red Jacket had cut into the main-hatch combings of the other vessel, carrying away her mainmast, mizen topmast, yards, etc, the Red Jacket losing foretopmast-studsail-boom, and some of the head gear being carried away. On looking over the bows of our own vessel, I immediately saw the dan­gerous position of the other one, as she was evidently filling very rapidly with water, and called out to them on board to leave her at once. With much difficulty the crew got on board the Red Jacket, and in less that eight minutes from the first shock the strange vessel went down under the bottom of the Red Jacket. At the earliest opportunity the crew of the strange vessel was mustered. They were all on board, and with the exception of the man that was at the wheel, they were all uninjured. The ship proved to be the Elizabeth Walker, of Glasgow, from Buenos Ayres, with a general cargo. When repair was completed, sail was made with the intention to procede on the voyage and to put the crew on board the first ship we found homeward bound.\"\n\n==O==\n\nJohn Goyne Instant Success\n\nIn Australian Goldfields\n\nBy Nola Aickin\n\nJohn Goyne was born in 1826 at Rosemundy, St. Agnes, Cornwall, the son of James and Elizabeth Goyne. He grew up in a world of mining and miners and gained much practical experience in that field, becoming a miner himself at a young age. The 1841 census shows John Goyne as a miner at age 15. In 1847, he was married to Catherine Letcher in Truro, Cornwall. Five years later, he sailed with his brother on the ship \"Graham\" from the West Indian docks of London for Victoria, arriving in Australia in early 1854. Catherine was to follow in 1866, some 13 years later on the \"Great Britain,\" and their children, Louisa, 18; Emily, 16; Kate, 15 and John, 13 travelled on the \"White Star\" the following year.\n\nOn his arrival in Victoria, John Goyne made his way to the Creswick and Ballarat goldfields and followed the rush of gold fever for four years. In the goldfields he had observed that much of the gold ore was lost in its processing. He saw some deficiencies in the stamper grating equipment then in use and had some ideas for improvements. By 1858, he had raised sufficient capital to launch his stamper grating factory at Epsom. The Goyne factory was immediately successful, gaining large sales volume and much publicity. He was soon receiving large orders from mining companies in Western Australia, Queensland, New Zealand, South Africa, the Straits settlements and Batavia. Two more children were born, Minnie and Frank.\n\nWith success, John Goyne began to plan a new home, a show­ place in the community. It was to be called \"Rosemundy House\" after his birthplace. By, 1880, he was a very wealthy and influential man. Shipments of sheet iron and steel were constantly arriving from England, and finished products were continually being shipped out. The factory was wired with electric lights, enabling it to operate day and night. By the mid 1800's he was exporting world wide and was able to employ seven men during 1902.\n\nOpposite the factory was \"Rosemundy\" surrounded by 20 acres of grounds, six of which were orchards. The area sur­rounding the mansion was like a park, landscaped with trees and shrubs, and the house was almost hidden with gardens. The outhouses were many--scullery, laundry, maidsquarters, stables and a gold office. The main house was glorious--an exceptional Victorian solid brick residence.\n\nJohn Goyne also owned 1800 acres of land at Kamarooka where he carried out his pastoral and agricultural interests. John Goyne was elected to the Huntly Shire Council in 1881 and served with this institution for over 20 years, he was also gazetted as a Justice of the Peace.\n\nCatherine Goyne died October 12, 1905 at the age of 76, and John Goyne designed the family vault which was erected in White Hills Cemetery. Two years later, he died at the age of 81 and was buried beside his wife. So ended the life of a man who contributed greatly to the gold industry of Bendigo and to the communities of Epsom and White Hills. He was a man who embarked on an enterprise which was destined to play an important role in mining operations worldwide--a pioneer and a genius in his own right.\n\n==O==\n\n[Nola Aickin and her husband are the present owners of \"Rosemundy\" and have maintained the mansion in keeping with its original grandeur and heritage.

Goyne, 66 Woodruff Avenue, Hove, Sussex, England wrote January 4, 1996:\n\n\"I have been in touch with several of the \"Goyne\" families over a period of many years. These include Robert Goyen of Victoria, Australia and most of the Goynes of Delaware, Lan­caster, Maryland and Virginia. Recently I visited the various American families with whom we have been exchanging visits for many years. I have now collected data both from my own research and from that of others and completed the enclosed family tree for the Foundation Library. You will recognise the extensive data which I received from Robert Goyen which I have used to aid my research and to build upon.\n\nAlso I collected data from others either directly or via fellow researchers. I hope that you find some new data in my work and find it usefull. I am of course interested in further data and lines of research. I am at present spreading my findings around in order to encourage the \"Rolling Snowball Effect\".\n\nI, from time to time visit St. Agnes in Cornwall, the source of my Goyne family, and find it rather pleasant to worship in the parish church where it all happened so many years ago.\n\nDuring the research it became obvious that the name Goyne [I will use this spelling although I mean to include the surname spelt in other ways also] was often given in church and other records with various spellings. This occurred in many records especially in early ones, in many cases to the extent that the record of the birth christening and marriage of a man could have his name given in different forms and even his Christian name might vary, ie. Rod and Richard]. I also found that in records of baptisms the surname of the children could be given with different spellings [Goyne, Goyen, Goine, Goynes and Gowen, etc.] I feel that this was to be expected for more than one reason including the fact that Cornwall had its own lan-guage as has Scotland, Wales and Ireland.\n\nI remember a relative who spoke, wrote and taught the Cornish language. Also the fact that the parish clerk was often not an accomplished scholar and might well write what he felt was the spelling of the name spoken to him at the time. Like my-self, most of the Goynes I have contacted were of the opinion that the family were descended from Huguenots who of course came to England mainly at the time of the Edict of Nantes in 1685.\n\nI suppose that Huguenots came to England from France before that time and who is to say that the original name was not changed to Gowen from a different one in a similar way to the Gowen/Goyne one. However the name Gowen is a Celtic one, and it appears in Scotland, Wales and Ireland as well as in Cornwall, so probably is the correct one. In my opinion most of people of Cornish descent will have Huguenot ances-tors so we are all probably Huguenots anyhow. I am certain that I have at least one. There are few records around for the period 1550 and earlier. Below is a copy of the ones used to begin this Family Tree.\n\nRaymond L. Goyne\"\n\nJohn Gawen was born about 1556 and was baptized January 8, 1556. He was married October 17, 1591 to Dorothy Skinner.\n\nChildren born to John Gawen and Dorothy Skinner Gawen include:\n\nRobert Gawen baptized January 11, 1591\n\nMargery Gawen baptized October 12, 1597\n\nPeter Gawen baptized September 30, 1598\n\nPeter Gawen was born about 1598 and baptized September 30, 1598, He was married November 22, 1629 to Joanna Warne.

In the Close Rolls of 1397 were mentioned John Gowyn the elder and John Goyen the younger of Fovent. He made Quit claim of all lands etc. in Westmerton and Wodhouse within the parish of Eblesborne Wake. Margaret Jove was mentioned as \"late his wife.\" The deed was dated at West Merton 12 April, in the 20th year of the reign of Richard II.\n\nSimon Gowen married Elizabeth Powglass in 1709 at St.Cleer.\n\nTheir children were:\n\nMary Gowen christened 4/ 1/1710\n\nSamuel Gowen christened 20/ 5/1712\n\nJohn Goyne christened 18/ 4/1713\n\nJohn Gowen christened 18/ 4/1715\n\nElizabeth Goine christened 22/ 3/1720\n\nWilliam Goyn christened 24/ 6/1724\n\nThomas Goyne christened 21/ 7/1727\n\nMary Gowen christened 23/ 6/1730\n\nHenry Goyne christened 31/ 7/1732\n\nAll of the children were christened at St. Cleer. Samuel christened Gowen above then appears as Simon Goyn when he married Mary Stout at Jacobstown in May 1736. His children were christened at St. Cleer.\n\nFurther back, Francis Gowen who married Elizabeth James in 1703 interestingly christened all of the 11 children Gowen except the last child who was christened Philipa Goyen in 1729. From then on the names were often spelt Goyne in the various ways found later but not always consistently. Prior to that no \"Goyne\" spellings were found in this research, but they have been sighted as isolated findings earlier.\n\nWe have not used all the male members of the line in the Family tree but have reserved some of them them for future research. The ones used link up with the later research undertaken and link up with Goynes in the U.S.A. and Australia.\n\n==O==\n\nSamuel Goynes was married February 2, 1834 at St. Neot, Cornwall to Elizabeth Saunders, according to Wes Richards, a descendant.

Thomas.\n\n\n\nThe Isle of Wight is located off the south coast of England and is a part of Hampshire, although it is separated from the mainland by the Solent and the Spithead.\n\nPeter Gawn of Canada wrote May 27, 2002:\n\nThere is an interesting article The Isle of Wight and the East India Company, 1700-1840 by James H. Thomas, well-known Portsmouth local historian, in The Local Historian, February 2000.\n\nThe Company established a Depot for Recruits at Park-hurst which operated from 1801 to 1815 when the de-pot was transferred to Chatham, Kent. Carisbrooke Castle was considered, but judged too costly to im-prove. Thomas cites fifty sources, including, for the depot specifically, East India Registry and Direct-ory 1803-1815 although I can't see any other informa-tion about this publication.\n\nOfficers of the depot shown in Thomas's article were:\n\nMaj. James Akerman, Capt. John Gillespie, Capt. Solo-mon Earle, Capt. Edward Hay, George Gowan, pay-master and Thomas Ogle, surgeon.\n\nIn a quick skim through the article I didn't notice any mention of the total number of recruits on the Island although Thomas does say that in 1786 the Company was licensed to recruit and train in the Isle of Wight, provided numbers were kept below 2,000.\n\nAn interesting quote: As a result that community [Newport] was to be affected by the presence of troops belonging to what, at the time, was one of the world's largest private armies.

It appeared that during a turn-out among the colliers between Bolton and Manchester the pris-oner was stationed, with two other men, to watch Fogg's colliery, in the township of Darcy Lever, and that on the night in question the deceased, her husband, and another person, were passing along the road near the colliery; they were rather intoxicated, and were talking loudly about getting some more brandy and water. The prisoner cried out, \"I'll give you brandy and water if you are not silent.\" He approached, and after a few angry words had passed between them the prisoner deliberately fired a pistol at the deceased. The ball entered her head, and caused instant death. The prisoner was ordered for execution, which took place accordingly. \n\n==O==\n\nMary MGowen and her accomplice, Catherine Thomas were sentenced to be tranfported for feven years by the General Quarter Sessions of the Peace for the Borough of Liverpool January 15, 1805, according to Gores General Advertiser published January 31, 1805.\n\nThey were tried and convicted for ftealing a pocket book containing bank notes to the amount of 191 pounds in the Liverpool Epiphany Sessions of 1805. The judges who sentenced them to deportation were the worfhipful William Harper, Esquire, Mayor and Alderman Thomas Golightly, John Shaw, Peter Whitfield Brancker, Jonas Bold and John Bridge Aspinall, Esquires, His Majeftys Juftices of he Peace for the faid Borough, affifted by Henry Brown, Esquire, as Assessor.\n\nLiverpool in 1805 was full of wealthy merchants and their equally succesful agents and bankers. In contrast the working poor of the city were held down by grinding pov-erty.\n\nThe merchants of Liverpool in that year were operating 185 ships out of their port in the very profitable three-way slave trade. Five-sixths of the West African slave trade was controlled by Liverpool. Slave ships left Liverpool weekly with cargoes of tools and supplies for Angola. At Luanda these were traded for slaves which were taken to Jamaica, the West Indies and the American colonies. There the slaves were traded for rum, cotton and items in high demand in England. Back in their home port, the masters and the merchants divided up their triple profits.\n\nThe poor people living in the slums of Liverpool had very little participation in the wealth of the city. Many turned to crime to pay for their pitiable living expenses. Despite the severity of the punishment, many took the chance and paid severely when they were convicted.\n\nFollowing their defeat in the American Revolutionary War, the British transported their convicts and undesirables to Aus-tralia. A letter dated February 28, 1805 to the Mayor of Liver-pool from the Home Office instructed him to send the pri-soners to the Laurel, a convict hulk lying in Portsmouth harbor. Another letter of February 27, 1805 instructed the captain of the Laurel to prepare to receive the prisoners who eventually arrived there on March 28.\n\nIt was in January 1806 before an Australia-bound convoy was assembled. Capt. William Bligh, captain of the ill-fated HMS Bounty, who was to take up his new post as Captain General and Governor of New South Wales, was one of the passen-gers. Blight wrote letters to the Admiralty during the six-month journey, and his dispatches have been preserved.\n\nAgain he proved to be a survivor, while many of the convicts died on the voyage. The tyrannical Bligh was severely tested when he and 18 seamen were placed aboard the Bountys launch and set adrift. The famous mutiny occurred in 1789 when his First Mate Fletcher Christian and his fellow muti-neers took over the Bounty and took her to Pitcairn Island.\n\nBreadfruit Bligh and most of his companions survived the ordeal and arrived in Timor, East Indies after drifting 4,000 miles in an open boat. Bligh returned to England and was re-stored to his command. In 1801 Adm. Bligh commanded the HMS Glatton in the Battle of Copenhagen for which he re-ceived a commendation from Lord Nelson.\n\nIn Australia, true to form, Bligh made himself intensely un-popular by his harsh exercise of authority. Again he had a mutiny on his hands. He was deposed in January 1808 by Maj. George Johnston of the 102nd Regiment of Foot and was imprisoned by the mutineers until 1810. When released, Bligh was returned to England and promoted to Rear Admiral. Johnston was court martialed and cashiered. Bligh was made a Vice Admiral in 1814 and died in London in 1817 at the age of 63.\n\nOther convicts who accompanied Mary MGowen on the very difficult journey to Australia included some who were con-victed in the same court session with her. [Researchers who attempt to copy the list will find their spell-checkers going crazy when they encounter the English habit of substituting f for s in their documents during that period.]\n\nThe offenses tabulated by the court included:\n\nRobert Williams, and Thomas Lewis, ftealing a fmall quantity of tobacco out of the King's Tobacco Ware-oufe. To be imprifoned in the Houfe of Correction at Prefton for the fpace of 8 calendar months.\n\nPeter M'Avoy, ftealing a quantity of dimity [fine cotton fabric] out of a package, being part of the cargo on board a fhip where he was employed as a porter.

When he was four, his father removed to Seattle. In 1913 while working in the Seattle Public Library he came down with smallpox. While spectators gathered, he was carted off to the \"pesthouse\" on Beacon Hill, according to an article about his life that appeared in the July 20, 1975 edition of \"The Seattle Times.\"\n\nHe was graduated from the University of Washington, began teaching in China, then went to New York to study for the ministry, then back to the Orient.\n\nHe lived in China from 1913 until 1927, when the first Com­munist threat arose. In that year he removed to the Philip­pines where he lived when his book \"Sun and Moon\" was published. For 15 years he taught the Ig­orot people who lived in the mountains north of Manila. In 1939 he wrote \"Philippine Kaleidoscope,\" an illustrated story of the Protestant Episcopal Church's mission. His family was in­terned in a prison camp when the Japanese invaded the Philippines during World War II. Upon be­ing released in 1945, he and his family returned to Seattle.\n\nIn 1975, at age 82, Vincent Herbert Gowen saw his novel, \"Village by the Yangtze\" published. It, too, was based on his experiences in China from 1913 to 1927.\n\nA reporter who interviewed him in July 1975 wrote:\n\n\"Now Vincent Gowen lives a more leisurely, but still very busy life for one his age. He begins each day with a cup of tea, a meditative pipe, a look back in the diary he has been keeping since he was 15, a walk with his black dog and red cat. Occasionally he goes rowing in the 'Fog,' (named for his wife, Frances Olin Gowen) on the bay at Port Blakely on Bainbridge Island where he has spent most of his life.\n\nHe also conducts a weekly class in classical literature for island women and is an associate clergyman at the island's St. Barnabas Episcopal Church which he organized in 1945. He served as the rector there until his retirement in 1961. He also conducts services in other Protestant churches and presides over weddings and funerals.\n\nHe tutors a bit, spends a good part of every day with two godsons or some of his grandchildren (he has 10), writes nightly in his diary and keeps up his memoirs which he hopes to publish some day. As intellectual a man as you will ever meet, he is fluent in Greek, Latin and Mandarin Chinese and is familiar with his clas­sics front to back.\n\nHe rose before dawn recently to go up to Green Mountain near Hurricane Ridge to renew a young couple's wedding vows for them at exactly the hour of sunrise. He likes to change from the clerical black into colorful sports outfits, and he buzzes around the island in a little red sports car.\n\nMr. Gowen is a great collector. His studio house, next door to the big Gowen house that had been owned by his parents, is filled with books and Igorot art and other momentos of his life in the Orient. Many of his possessions--books, manuscripts, art--were lost in the war, and as much as he mourned their loss, he found it a relief to land in Seattle with his family in 1945 with everything they owned in two duffle bags.\n\nIn 1942, when World War II closed his Igorot school and he and his wife and their children Ann [Mrs. Joseph R. Combs of Bainbridge] and Geoffrey (in the banking business in Ethiopia) were imprisoned, he found living under such conditions a challenge rather than a tragedy. He became principal of the prison camp high school and graduated two classes. He had to scrounge for books and is still economical with writing paper, recalling how his students had to use one sheet for four subjects. He and Frances and another couple had a perpetual bridge game going until the very end of their internment.\n\nThe Gowen house, circa 1890, is at the site of the old Port Blakely Mill. When Vincent was a boy the family summered at Crystal Springs, but in 1935, Dr. Gowen bought the Blakely place, and it was available and furnished when Vincent Gowen's family arrived in 1945.\n\nAbout \"Village by the Yangtze\"--it couldn't have come at a more appropriate time. It was written shortly after his first book, but the manuscript was put aside, then lost, then found, and in the past few years rewritten twice. The setting is a village mission school in the late 1920s, caught in change and espionage for it was in the path of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang forces. The first copies of the book were off the press shortly after Chaing Kai-shek's death.\n\nA man of prodigious memory at an age when most people have trouble remembering the simplest facts, Vincent Gowen goes about writing in a way that amazes the modern writer. He does the whole book [this one has 373 pages] in longhand, once or twice. Then carefully, accurately, he types his manuscript with four fingers, two on each hand.\n\nHe is indeed a man of contradictions, which makes him one of the most interesting men you could hope to know.\"\n\nChildren born to Vincent Herbert Gowen and Frances Olin Gowen include:\n\nAnn Gowen born about 1920\n\nGeoffrey Gowen born about 1924\n\nAnn Gowen, daughter of Vincent Herbert Gowen and Frances Olin Gowen, was born about 1920, probably in China.
