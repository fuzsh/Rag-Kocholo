        "text": "A lasting love! Witney Carson married her high school sweetheart, Carson McAllister, and the pair have been making fans swoon ever since.\n\nThe Dancing With the Stars pro announced in October 2015 that her beau popped the question. ‚ÄúMy love of four years @carson.mcallister proposed last night & I feel like the luckiest, happiest woman in the world.üíçüíïüòç‚ù§Ô∏è,‚Äù she gushed via Instagram. ‚ÄúIt was perfect, he‚Äôs perfect #engaged.‚Äù\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt long before the twosome walked down the aisle. Carson and McAllister exchanged vows on New Year‚Äôs Day in 2016. Lindsay Arnold, Jenna Johnson, Emma Slater and more DWTS pros were bridesmaids on their costar‚Äôs big day. Several of Carson‚Äôs former famous partners ‚Äî including Chris Soules and Alfonso Ribeiro ‚Äî also celebrated the happy couple.\n\nBefore tying the knot, the So You Think You Can Dance alum exclusively opened up about her wedding planning experience. ‚ÄúI thought it would be more stressful with everything going on, but it‚Äôs actually been really fun,‚Äù she told Us Weekly in November 2015. ‚ÄúAnd we finally have a venue and that was the most stressful part. So it‚Äôs going to be in Utah and it‚Äôs just going to be really beautiful.‚Äù\n\nFour years after getting married, the couple announced they were expanding their family. ‚ÄúBaby McAllister coming Jan 2021!!!!! We can‚Äôt even contain our excitement and joy right nowüôèüèºüò≠‚ù§Ô∏è,‚Äù the then-pregnant star gushed via Instagram in July 2020, adding that she and McAllister already loved their ‚Äúlittle bean so much.‚Äù\n\nThe pair later revealed they were having a son, and Leo arrived in January 2021. ‚ÄúI pushed for two and a half hours,‚Äù Carson exclusively told Us the following month. ‚ÄúI was fully dilated and the baby just did not want to come out. He just was, like, stuck underneath my pelvis for so long. His heart rate started going really high. So we had to do an emergency C-section and obviously, we did whatever was right for the baby.‚Äù\n\nLeo‚Äôs delivery was ‚Äútraumatic,‚Äù and the Utah native wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúprepared‚Äù for such complications. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just really happy that he‚Äôs healthy. That‚Äôs the most important thing,‚Äù she added.\n\nThe proud parents frequently documented their baby boy‚Äôs milestones via social media before Carson announced her second pregnancy in November 2022. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so excited to finally announce that Carson, Leo and myself are expecting baby No. 2,‚Äù she said during a live episode of DWTS. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so blessed and this just felt like a really, really good time to share it. And I can finally share it! Which is great!‚Äù\n\nCarson and McAllister welcomed their second child, son Jet, in May 2023.\n\nScroll down for a closer look at the duo‚Äôs romance:"
