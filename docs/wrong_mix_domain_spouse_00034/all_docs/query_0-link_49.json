        "text": "Dublin Marathon\n\nOctober 30, 2016 10:48 pm Comments Off on Dublin Marathon\n\nOn Sunday 30th October, a record 19,500 runners took to the streets of Dublin to compete in the SSE Airtricity Dublin Marathon. Of this vast number, 11 wore the orange vest for OAC, a huge mark up on last year’s single runner. The race had been moved to a Sunday for the first time which could have partially accounted for its early sell out.\n\nThe course starts in Fitzwilliam Square making its way North-West of the city through Phoenix Park. It then loops back down to cross the Grand Canal at just under half way where there’s one of the many official cheer points and then on through Bushy Park. The route then travels towards University College and the killer Heartbreak Hill at mile 22 before a bit of a downhill and then the home straight towards Merrion Square.\n\nFirst OAC runner in was Robin Montgomery with a speedy 3.09.39. Sile Brennan was in next and first OAC lady with a new PB for her 21st marathon 3.22.16. Well done Sile (when she passed me at half-way she looked as though she was thoroughly enjoying it)! PBs were also on the agenda for Michael O’Donoghue (3.31.07), Ian Millgate, who smashed his previous marathon by 27 minutes with a time of 3.49.46 and Lisa Fleming ran superbly with a new PB of 4.21.01.\n\nJill Holland ran a very impressive first marathon although was also clear that this could be her last. I guess time, and perhaps no memory of the pain of the first, may make her do it again. Nevertheless, with an excellent time of 4.29.05 she should feel very pleased with her achievement.\n\nOther Orangegrovers that ran were Ian Grant (3.46.39), Rodney Corrigan (3.56.45), Pauline Bayliss (3.44.19) and David Doey (4.36.39). Well done to all on what was a challenging course. Stephen Anderson ran 20+ miles but due to injury made the wise decision to pull out. We wish him a speedy recovery and hope to see him back on the roads soon.\n\nBobby Rea XC – Kilbroney\n\n10:49 am Comments Off on Bobby Rea XC – Kilbroney\n\nSeason of mists and mellow fruitfulness and all that. When the crimson leaves begin to fall and the turf becomes a little softer underfoot it can only mean one thing to the club runner, cross country. We always tend to look forward to cross country, but when it suddenly arrives on the doorstep the inevitable self doubt sets in. The problem is that you can never decide what to wear! Base layer or no base layer? In the minutes before the start of any cross country race you are usually suffering the ill effects of a stern wind from the east and the base layer option appears the right one. However, by the end of the opening lap you are inevitably left cursing your over cautious decision to cover up….and it is a lesson we never seem to be able to learn!\n\nI think for us men there is something just a little primeval about cross country running,….sprinting across the grass, through the trees and up slippery slopes as if your life depended on it, choosing the best possible route to give you some kind of an advantage in your hunting and gathering over that old stager beside you. Then there is the pungent but satisfying smell of damp turf and fermenting leaves and the pleasant crunch of twigs and branches under foot. Add to this the undoubted sensation of splattering mud on your calves and legs to remind you of your youth or perhaps a more basic existence a millennium or two ago.\n\nNo man who is honest with himself will deny that he secretly enjoys cutting a furrow through the squelching mud, the more sticky the better. Maybe it is all about displaying prowess to the ladies (if they haven’t already departed for the gazebo or the tea room). Male cross country running could almost emulate a human form of the reindeer rutting season, survival of the fittest for first choice of the aforementioned ladies. The strange thing is that the older you get as a male runner you become excluded from the main rut and get thrown in with the ladies anyway, presumably because you are perceived to be of little use to them and certainly no threat whatsoever. Inevitably they are younger and fitter and very fast and you have absolutely no chance of catching any of them anyway, even if you were so inclined. The only thing the old stager is left with is a rear view which, if you think about it, is probably the best view anyway.\n\nSo, all is well. By the way it all started last week at the Dub with the Northern Ireland Masters’ Athletic Association cross country races around the pitches at the Queen’s University playing fields. This weekend will see a fair sprinkling of Orangegrove adults, and perhaps juniors too, make their way to Kilbroney Forest Park, near Rostrevor, for the Northern Ireland and Ulster Even Age Group Cross Country Championships, including the Bobby Rea Memorial races. The Bobby Rea races, for adults, constitute a round of the Athletics NI Cross Country League. The ladies and men over 60 go at 2.40pm (5k) and the senior men below at 3.10pm (8k).\n\nSo, how did the cross country go? Well, always expect the unexpected! Conditions were just about perfect at Kilbroney and base layers were never an issue! The expected mud did not materialise and the majority of us who made the trip crossed the finish line as clean as we had crossed the start line! There was no better place in Ulster to have been last Saturday afternoon. The park was a picture with a low sun accentuating the autumnal colours. It was almost a pleasure to be running cross country and that significant hill was manageable for most of us in the absence of the usual gale force wind.\n\nFor Orangegrove it was a successful day with at least a dozen members turning out. We thank our captains for organising us so well and, in particular, Robin Montgomery for arriving early and setting up headquarters for us. We also appreciated the presence of Stephen Anderson to cheer us on and Gerald Harvey too who made the journey to add to the photographic collection! Much appreciated. Points were earned towards the Athletic NI Cross Country League from the following:\n\nLadies & Veteran Male (5k)\n\nBrian Todd (M65) 22.26 Julie McKimm 23.17 Jacqueline Maxwell 26.05 Alison Hall-Thompson 26.24 Catherine Fearon 30.45\n\nMen (8k)\n\nAndy McIntyre 31.24 Thomas Leitch 32.07 Robin Montgomery 34.13 Tim Robinson 34.27 Eric Fairfield 34.27 Michael Broadhead 34.43 Darren Houston 37.06\n\nWe offer a warm welcome to new member Michael Broadhead who turned out for us at Kilbroney. May he continue to enjoy his running in an orange vest.\n\nThe ladies 5k race was won by Rebecca Henderson (Dromore AC) in 19.06 and the men’s 8k race was won by Conor Duffy (Glaslough Harriers) in 26.46.\n\nGiant’s Trail Race – Club Championship Round 9\n\nJuly 29, 2016 11:59 pm Comments Off on Giant’s Trail Race – Club Championship Round 9\n\nFriday evening brought the second running of the Giant’s Ring Trail Race, courtesy of our friends at the Dub Runners. Last year the start of this great 6 mile trail race was affected by a torrential downpour. This year we are hoping that the elements will be a little more kind.\n\nThe race itself is a superb one. It starts close to where the old Dub pavilion used to be. Following a charge across the rugby pitches the runner joins part of the Queen’s parkrun route in reverse before a steep descent to Shaw’s Bridge via the meadows below Malone House. From Shaw’s Bridge it is then on towards Minnowburn before a very steep climb up to the Terrace Hill Garden, the highest point of the route. It is then on towards the Giant’s Ring itself (a magnificent Neolithic tomb in the middle of a circular enclosure over 600 feet wide) via the Sandpit Field and Ballynahatty.\n\nFrom the Giant’s Ring the route is then towards the once industrial Edenderry and across the Gilchrist Bridge to the main towpath before taking the trails back to Shaw’s Bridge and the meadows to the finish. There is a sting in the tail, however. Those meadows which helped the runner at the start of the race will now conspire to sap his or her strength as the end approaches. If you are going to be reduced to a walk at any point, it may well be here!\n\nAs was the case last year the race will constitute a round of the Orangegrove Club Championship, the ninth round. So, there will inevitably be many orange vests on the start line. However, even if this race was not a round of our championship we would still be there in our droves. Not only is it a great six mile race, but Nessa Agnew and Roisin Byrne have done a spectacular job in selling it to us. Most of us would rather run up a mountain than face the wrath of Nessa!\n\nSo, how did it go? Well, conditions were all but perfect. It was dry, not too warm, not too sunny and there was a gentle breeze. The green area adjacent to the start at the Dub was awash with orange, most of it ours. My count suggests forty-nine OAC members, fifty if we count Colin Simpson (43.22) as one of ours on the day. There was music, encouragement and a sense of pleasurable anticipation. Even though this was for us a Club Championship round all of us were glad to be there and ready for the challenge. I would say this particular 6 mile trail route must be one of the best anywhere in the world. Where else would you get such a variety of scenery, terrain and history in one six mile stretch? Off we went at precisely 7.30pm and by 8.45pm most of us were back and contemplating the next bit (the important bit), the tea, the craic and the sandwiches, of which there were plenty. The following are the times achieved by Orangegrove runners:\n\nMen\n\nAndy McIntyre 39.19 Thomas Leitch 39.58 1st M45 Robin Montgomery 41.32 Tim Robinson 43.24 Michael O’Donoghue 43.51 Brian Todd 44.09 Andrew Tees 44.41 Stephen Hamilton 44.42 Stephen Anderson 45.00 Martin O’Brien 45.11 Ian Millgate 46.01 Paul Tyro 46.54 David Fletcher 46.58 Andrew Allen 47.11 Ian Grant 47.53 Rodney Corrigan 51.16 John Neill 52.39 Martin Doherty 52.57 Fintan Hurl 53.06 Gerald Harvey 53.12 Reg Sanlon 53.37 Brian McFarland 55.13 Ian Wilson 56.00 Martin Walker 56.17 Alan Montgomery 1.00.43 Ian Reid 1.10.19 Neal Killen 1.11.02\n\nLadies\n\nTrudy Brown 45.30 Lyndsey Tyro 46.55 Julie McKimm 48.29 Emma McWilliams 52.29 Kerris Hamilton 53.13 Lisa Fleming 53.21 Jacqueline Maxwell 53.23 1st F55 Heather Shanks-Miller 53.24 Alison Hall-Thompson 53.28 Jill Holland 53.36 Elizabeth Watt 55.03 Sharon Corken 55.04 Helen Charlton 56.08 Judith McCann… 57.36 Sarah Malcolmson 57.49 Chantal Hemphill 57.55 Hilary Bradshaw 57.56 Catherine Fearon 58.14 Anna Rankin 58.32 Linda Craig 1.03.00 Sharon McFarland 1.06.17 Deborah Killen 1.27.15\n\nGreat running from all concerned. Eventually the above times will be age graded and entered on the spreadsheet. Well done to Jacqui Maxwell (F55) and Thomas Leitch (M45) on their age category wins.\n\nAll of us at OAC are very grateful to our friends at Dub Runners for hosting us so well and for laying on such a challenging yet thoroughly enjoyable trail race.\n\nThe Giant’s Ring Trail Race was won by Zak Hanna (Newcastle AC) in the remarkable time of 33.53, and Martsje Hell (North Belfast Harriers) was first lady in 42.15. What a way to start the weekend! So, until next year!\n\nWeekly Report – June 13-19 2016\n\nJune 19, 2016 11:54 pm Comments Off on Weekly Report – June 13-19 2016\n\nBy recent standards this wasn’t a particularly busy week (lucky me!), but it was busy enough!\n\nIt all started on the Tuesday evening with Round 3 of the North Down Athletic Club’s Open track and field series at Bangor. Early indications are that Alan Martin’s sprinters will partake and certainly Stephen Orr (800m), Chris Downey (3000m), George Gribben (200m) and Antra Balcuna (400m) may well turn up.\n\nThe action begins at 7pm at the Bangor Sportsplex on the Old Belfast Road. Wednesday evening was big, very big! The Lisburn Half Marathon, 10k Road Race and Fun Run are favoured by many and I would expect a fairly substantial Orangegrove participation in both the Half and 10k. Thursday’s Hill and Dale Race is the tenth in the series and is the one known as ‘The Meels’, presumably encompassing Slieves Meelmore and Meelbeg. Meet at the Happy Valley Car Park for a 7.30pm start.\n\nThere is also unconfirmed intelligence that both Jenny Powell and Karen Russell will take part in the Hell4Leather 10k race at Moneyglass near Toomebridge on Saturday.\n\nNorth Down Athletic Club’s Open track and field series\n\nThe North Down Open has male and female races at 200m, 400m, 800m and 3000m. Sometimes the genders are combined. The field events are hammer, high jump, long jump, javelin and shot. This is a very slickly run, no nonsense series of meetings which welcome athletes of all abilities. There is very little waiting around. Valerie McDonough and the host club ensure that their meetings run to schedule and that everything possible is done to facilitate the participants. It all starts at 7pm and is usually done and dusted well before 9pm.\n\nOrangegrove results were as follows:\n\n200m F40 Emma Smith 31.97 (5th) 200m F55 Beverley Martin 35.33 (7th) 200m M60 George Gribben 30.04 (6th) 400m FO Antra Balcuna 1.08.86 (4th) 800m M40 Stephen Orr 2.12.10 (6th) 3000m M40 Chris Downey (9th)\n\nVery well done indeed to the speedy ones from the sprint group who participated and who represented Orangegrove so well.\n\n2016 Coca-Cola Lisburn Half Marathon, 10K & Fun Run\n\nThe combined Lisburn Half Marathon and 10k road race (sponsored by Coca Cola) is one of the premier events of the running year and literally thousands are entered. There is a carnival atmosphere about the town and the local inhabitants embrace the occasion not only with their enthusiasm but with their presence too along the route.\n\nRead the full race report here\n\nHill and Dale Race 10 – The Meels\n\nThis week’s Hill and Dale race in the Mournes, courtesy of Newcastle AC, is the tenth in the series and the one known as ‘The Meels’, after Slieve Meelmore (2237 feet) and Slieve Meelbeg (2210 feet). Only in Ireland could the ‘beg’ be higher than the ‘more’! The race length is only 3.5 miles but it will involve over 1800 feet of climbing and is not for the faint hearted. Orangegrove has been a consistent supporter of the series in recent years and this year has been no exception.\n\nThe afternoon was dull and wet and the order went out that full body cover would be mandatory. However, as the off approached I gather that things improved and that the runners enjoyed an excellent jaunt over the hills, albeit a bit soft under foot. The following from Orangegrove were in the race: Thomas Leitch, Sharon Dickenson, Eoghan Rainey, Stephen Craig, Darren Marshall and, of course, Michael O’Donoghue who was still a bit battered and bruised from his last outing. The following times were recorded by our Hill and Dalers, although in reality times are not really that important in this kind of running:\n\nThomas Leitch 35.01 (11th/148) Darren Marshall 44.05 Eoghan Rainey 51.40 Michael O’Donoghue 56.41 Sharon Dickenson 1.00.38 Stephen Craig\n\nThe Meels was won by Zak Hanna (Newcastle AC) in 30.44 and Shileen O’Kane (Lagan Valley AC) was first lady in 39.17.\n\nI must make the effort to get back to Hill and Dale next year. However, the thought has also struck me that at my age if I am going to die suddenly I would prefer to do so in my bed rather than on the side of Slieve Binnian!\n\nAntrim Summer Festival 10k Run\n\nFriday evening brought the Antrim Summer Festival 10k Run on a course in and around the Junction One shopping complex. Whether the elegant Lyndsey Tyro’s real motive was to run the race or to use it as an excuse for some impromptu shopping, only she knows. Whether she had a good night in the aisles is unknown, but she certainly had a good night out on the course finishing the race as first lady in 42.15 (7th).\n\nHusband Paul was also in great form scorching around the course, which took the runners close to the shores of Lough Neagh on Castle Road and Randalstown Road, in 40.30 (4th). Indeed Paul might have won the race had he not had to complete it carrying Lyndsey’s purchases. In the end it was won by Eoin Hughes in 36.51. Lyndsey was last seen spending her winnings in the Adidas and Asics stores! Well done Lyndsey and Paul Tyro!\n\nHell4Leather 10k\n\nMoneyglass in Co. Antrim, near Toomebridge, has a population of 103 on a normal day. However, that figure is likely to be exceeded on Saturday 18th June when the village will run its annual Hell4Leather 10k and 5k road races in support of the local Gaelic Athletic Club. Moneyglass is not a place to be sniffed at! It has one or two notable alumni. The village has connections with Frank McCourt, writer of the Pulitzer Prize winning novel, Angela’s Ashes. It was also former home to national hunt jockey Tony McCoy and to Irish rugby great Willie John McBride. The singer Audrey Gallagher also hails from the village. Now Orangegrove’s Jenny Powell and Karen Russell can be added to that august list! The village is also home to an enormous Game of Thrones medieval set. So, definitely not a village to be trifled with!\n\nIn the end it was only Jenny Powell who made it to Moneyglass and there is no doubt that her long trip was worthwhile. She ran hell for leather to complete the picturesque but challenging 10k course in a personal best time of 52.31. Very well done indeed Jenny Powell! The village now has a new alumna and Ms. Powell has had her glass of rioja!\n\nEAMS ‘Knockathon’ Half Marathon\n\nGillian Logan has been at it again. Not content with running a half marathon on Wednesday evening in Lisburn she was pounding the roads again on Saturday afternoon in the backwoods of Co. Antrim. Gillian is determined to complete ten half marathons in 100 days in her worthy efforts to support the Cancer Focus NI charity. Saturday’s East Antrim Marathon Series half was half marathon number 2 of the sequence. Today’s run was not a straightforward one either.\n\nStarting near Greenisland Presbyterian Church the route took the runner on a considerable uphill journey on the picturesque but challenging roads in and around the Knockagh Monument at near enough 300m and then beyond to Woodburn. However, there was also a flatter section along the Shore Road from Greenisland Road to Glenville Road. Gillian is running very well at the moment and was pleased to finish the half as first lady home in the very respectable time of 1.50.32. Well done, Gillian. Your Club is proud of you!\n\nNorth Down Cycle Club’s Coastal Challenge\n\nVery well done to Michael O’Donoghue, Eoin Woodman, Jacqui Maxwell and Mark Williamson who took part in Sunday’s North Down Cycle Club’s Coastal Challenge, a 60 mile ride from Bangor to Portaferry via the east side of the Strangford peninsula and then home on the Strangford Lough side. Conditions were benign as the riders set off at 10am but deteriorated during the course of the day. I am glad to report that the four Orangegrover’s reached the end intact, if a little soggy!\n\nEAH Trail series\n\nAnd just a reminder to the trail runners. Next Tuesday evening’s scheduled East Antrim Harriers’ trail race at Woodburn, the last in the series, has been postponed until the following Tuesday (Tuesday 28th June) because of the more important business of Northern Ireland’s European Championship match against Germany. #GAWA!\n\nParkrun\n\nThe parkrun bandwagon goes from strength to strength in Northern Ireland and, indeed, throughout the United Kingdom and beyond. At our own Victoria Park there is never a Saturday morning that we are not blessed with new faces, and old ones too who have been away for a while. This week was no exception and the mild weather brought them out in their hundreds.\n\nAt Victoria Park the following OAC Club members deserve our recognition and applause for personal best times: Anna Rankin (24.58), Nicola Downey (26.55), Judith McCann (26.58). Anna Rankin was first OAC lady to finish (92nd) and Thomas Leitch was first OAC male to finish (11th).\n\nAt Stormont Martin O’Brien finished in a personal best time of 21.34 (13th) as did Ian Grant (22.36) and Reg Sanlon (24.38). At Ormeau the increasingly speedy Des Fahy had a personal best of 18.52 (12th). At Comber, Alfie Houston (JM10) had a personal best of 34.07. Martin Walker was a first timer at Portrush in 25.57 as was Sile Brennan in 27.50.\n\nPaul and Lyndsey Tyro, always on the move, were in Letterkenny where Paul finished in second place in 19.51 and Lyndsey was in third place (first lady) in 20.36 which was also a new course record! Paul was still carrying parcels!\n\nNo volunteers, no parkrun! Familiar but very true words. To keep it going from strength to strength your Club needs you for the odd Saturday morning at the business end. To volunteer, email Gerry Ward at belfastvictoriahelpers@parkrun.com. Do it now!\n\n2016 Coca-Cola Lisburn Half Marathon & 10K\n\nJune 15, 2016 11:12 pm Comments Off on 2016 Coca-Cola Lisburn Half Marathon & 10K\n\nThe combined Lisburn Half Marathon and 10k road race (sponsored by Coca Cola) is one of the premier events of the running year and literally thousands are entered. There is a carnival atmosphere about the town and the local inhabitants embrace the occasion not only with their enthusiasm but with their presence too along the route. Both races are important. The Half Marathon is the final race of the ‘first half’ of the Pure Running/Championchip Ireland Half Marathon Series. Those who have not completed three out of the four events on offer to date will have to run this one if they are to satisfy the regulations of the series. However, Lisburn is also important on the 10k front. The 10k race is the seventh round of the Novosco 10k Grand Prix Series. There is honour to be maintained and money to be won, but only if you complete at least six of the thirteen races on the calendar and we are beginning to run out of races! Lisburn has the reputation of providing fairly speedy routes for both the half and 10k and so will provide an opportunity for many to improve their existing positions.\n\nThe half marathon follows a mainly rural route including Moira Road, Lurganure Road, Halfpenny Road, Derrynahone Road, Cockhill Road Danygarton Road, Down Royal Racecourse, Culcavy, Halftown Road, Blaris Road and the A1. The 10k route follows the Moira Road to Halftown Road and then back to the finish via Blaris Road and the main A1. Over 6000 runners are expected, so it will be busy! I would expect the orange of Orangegrove to be both visible and in contention at both distances. The 10k runners set off at 6.50pm with the longer distance runners going at 7pm.\n\nA warm and sultry evening welcomed the thousands of runners who gathered at Lisburn Leisureplex for the beginning of the 10k and half marathon races. In retrospect, Lisburn has the reputation of providing fairly fast courses for both distances. Whether this claim is justified is open to conjecture. My experience of the half last year and of the 10k this year is that while there are no serious hills there are numerous steady inclines which seem to go on forever and which never seem to reward you with a corresponding easy decline. This and the high temperature made it tough going. In the results published below I have only included those members who indicated that they were running or who were spotted in the results. With so many running in each race and with no club designations being included in the results it was very difficult to spot others who may have been running. If I have left you out please message me and I will include your result in the report before it is uplifted to the main website. Congratulations to the following for their endeavour (10k time):\n\n10k\n\nDes Fahy 38.49 (45th/1840) Brian Todd 42.51 Martin O’Brien 44.38 Gerald Harvey 48.10 Emma McWilliams 49.44 John Neill 50.52 David Doey 54.45 Sarah Malcolmson 55.02 Brian McFarland 57.12 Catherine Lavery 1.04.09 Neal Killen 1.07.06 Deborah Killen 1.21.29\n\nThe Coca Cola Lisburn 10k Race was won by Chris Madden on 31.51 and Heather Foley was first lady on 37.43.\n\nHalf Marathon\n\nEric Fairfield 1.29.00 (51st/1141) Darren Houston 1.37.31 Anne Moore 1.44.53 Gillian Logan 1.46.15 Carolyn Beattie 1.47.21 Zdzislaw Malkinski 1.47.59 Chantal Hemphill 1.59.51 Jenny Cochrane 1.59.51 Trish Magill 2.02.03\n\nThe Coca Cola Lisburn Half Marathon was won by Stephen Duncan in 1.12.21 and Laura Graham was first lady in 1.19.51.\n\nParticular congratulations to Des Fahy and Emma McWilliams who were first OAC male and female home in the 10k and also to Eric Fairfield and Anne Moore first OAC male and female in the Half. Great to see Catherine Lavery back running after her recent injury. Well done to Gillian Logan too as she sets out on her challenge to complete ten half marathons in one hundred days for the Cancer Focus NI charity.\n\nGreat to see Zdzislaw Malkinski (M65) still registering respectable times and finishing first in his age category. Chantal Hemphill and Jenny Cochrane were also running well in what may have been their first half marathon. Well done to all who took part and who were proud to represent Orangegrove Athletic Club in the heat of the evening.\n\nWeekly Report – May 16-22 2016\n\nMay 22, 2016 11:55 pm Comments Off on Weekly Report – May 16-22 2016\n\nUlster Schools Championships\n\nOur 3 County Down medallists travelled to the Antrim Forum on Saturday for the Ulster Schools’ Finals. Aaron McCord was 8th in the Minor Boy’s Long jump with a superb jump of 4.75m, a new PB and an OAC club record. Well done Aaron.\n\nUnfortunately Lucy Armstrong sustained a painful hip flexor injury during her 200m final. We hope this settles soon Lucy.\n\nAdam Sykes qualified for the 4x100m final relay and with a younger athlete stepping in to cover an injury they secured 6th position.\n\nWell done to all 3 for their achievement in getting to the finals. The future is bright!\n\nAlbertville 4 Mile Road Race\n\nThis year the traditionally fast flat course was changed to a 4 mile race because of course restrictions, as most people won’t have raced at this distance they were guaranteed a PB. Des Fahy was our first finisher in a time of 24.08, followed by Jonny Weston in 27.15. The ever smiling Carolyn Beattie was next in 29.20. All runners were treated to a burger afterwards in the nearby Portside Inn.\n\nBallybeen 5k\n\nIn what is only the 2nd year of this event, nearly 100 runners turned up to race this quite hilly 5k on Tuesday night. First home for OAC was Paul Tyro, he was 16th finisher in a time of 19.18. Next home was Lyndesy Tyro (5th lady) in 20.33, she was closely followed by Graeme Bennett in 20.56. The race was won by Willowfield’s Gary Morrow, First Lady Cathy McCourt.\n\nAnnaghamore 10k\n\nOur only representative at this was Paul Gruhn, he completed the 10k in 53.12. Well done Paul. This was a scenic hilly route and as expected the post run spread comes highly recommended.\n\nHill and Dale 6 – Loughshannagh\n\nAt 5 miles and with 1,700 feet of ascent this is one of the toughest races in the series organised by Newcastle AC. It’s also one of the most scenic with views of the lough. Thomas Leitch was the first of the OAC mountain goats to finish, 50.08 , in 22nd place. Next was Darren Marshall in 63.50, followed by Eoghan Rainey in 82.21 and then Sharon Dickenson in 89.37. Judith Dalzell toed the line but fell foul of the race organisers’ insistence on newly introduced time penalties for this year’s series. Despite this Judith made it to the top of the final climb to cheer on her club mates. The race was won by Newcastle’s Ian Bailey and Dromore’s Diane Wilson. Next stop Donard!\n\nMiles for Matty\n\nAnne Moore and family travelled to her beloved County Tyrone today for the Miles for Matty event, which was organised by the family of Omagh man Matthew Drumm (Matty). Matty died on Christmas Eve 2013, aged 22, and gave the gift of life to seven other people through organ donation.\n\nToday wasn’t about times, distances or PBs, it was about raising money for the NI transplant association and other local charities, and for the local community to come together in honour of this young man. Rory Moore ran his first ever 5k in 34 minutes and I hear he out sprinted his dad to the finish. Mum Anne ran the 10k. Well done Anne, Rory and Steve, I am sure that this was a very emotional occasion for all involved.\n\nKirkistown Duathlon\n\n(written by Brian Todd)\n\nBrian Todd and Emma McWilliams were Orangegrove’s only representatives at Sunday’s Sprint Duathlon at Kirkistown Motor Racing Circuit. Sprint Duathlon involves a two mile run followed by a ten mile bike ride and then a final two mile run. Conditions were almost perfect, dry and sunny but there was a fairly noticeable breeze which affected the bike ride in particular. Emma had a great day. Following a strong opening run she exited transition on the bike near the front of the female competitors.\n\nEmma, who clearly possesses some of the McWilliam’s two wheel genes so evident in her speedy brother, had a faultless ride to place her in a strong position for the final run. In the end she was amongst the prize winners, second lady. No times are available yet, but both Brian and Emma finished in just over the hour. If Orangegrove could field one or two more participants we could easily win a team prize! Anybody interested?\n\nRunher\n\nThis year’s ladies only 5th Runher Coastal Challenge took place on Friday evening. Over 1,300 runners crossed the finish line for the 5k and 10k events. Despite the bad weather the OAC ladies enjoyed the scenic and undulating trail which began at Seapark and concluded with a brutal final hill and enthusiastic marshalling at Crawfordsburn Country Park. Lynsey Pronger had a fantastic run to get a podium place of 3rd with a time of 40.15. Well done Lynsey! Other Orangegrove ladies taking on the 10k were Alison Hall-Thompson 51.24, Sarah Malcolmson 54.49, Judith McCann 55.00, Karen Russell 57.12 and Hilary Bradshaw closely behind on 57.17. Flying the flag for OAC in the 5k was Nicola Downey with a superb finish of 28.31 and Elaine McAllister with 32.46.\n\nOne World Run\n\nThis year was the 30th Anniversary of the run whose entry fees are given to a variety of local charities that help developing countries. Last year this race was one of our Club Championship events and it was still popular with a number of OAC members despite the action packed weekend of racing available. This is a multi-lap course of Ormeau Park and Embankment with OAC’s first finisher, Eric Fairfield, coming in 7th with an impressive 40.12. Martin O’Brien was next home with 44.36 followed by Keith Patterson, 52.44, Anna Rankin, 54.43 (possible PB), George Gribben, 56.42 and Ian Reid, 1.15.19. Highlights included the mamba music and the ice-cream van at the end.\n\nParkrun\n\nOur weekly timed run was as popular as ever this week with a few second finishers noted at Ormeau (Andy McIntrye, 17.49), Stormont (Thomas Leitch, 19.38) and Colin Glenn (Michael O’Donaghue, 21.24). Friend of OAC, Cathy Fraser, completed her 250th timed run at Victoria Park this weekend. Congratulations Cathy who is now the first lady throughout Ireland to achieve this! Finally, thanks to our amazing volunteers who not only help us stay motivated but also fed and watered and without whom Parkrun wouldn’t be possible."
