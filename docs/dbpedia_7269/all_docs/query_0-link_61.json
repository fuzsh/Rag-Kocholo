        "text": "Modern Egypt map (www.map-of-egypt.org). The country of Hawwara extended from Asyut to Farshout, in Qina [Qena. Farshout is at the beginning of the Qena Nile bend, on the western bank, opposite Naj Hammadi\n\nOf all nations and countries, none has seen the amount of injustice and oppression that the poor Copts and their patrie, Egypt, have seen. Invaded by foreigners since the Arab occupation of Egypt in AD 640, they have been ruled by cruel, rapacious, voracious, ravenous, bloodthirsty aliens who had no mercy or the fear of God in their hearts: Arabs, Persians, Turks, Berber, Kurds, Circassians, Arnauts (Albanians), etc.. They were all basically the same in the evil they apportioned the Egyptians (the Copts). The difference between one and the other is like the difference between wolf and hyena. And the Berber tribes, of which the Hawwara confederation is the most important, is not least in that league of leeches and parasites. Their inequity and cruelty towards the Copts are legendary. Their attacks on the Copts to this day exist.\n\nThe Hawwara’s original homeland is Tripolitania, which occupied the north-western part of Present Libya, around Tripoli, its capital. When the Fatimids seized Egypt in 969 AD some of the Hawwara came with them and settled in the north-western part of Egypt, mainly in Buhaira Province. They multiplied during the Ayyubid (1171 – 1250) and Bahri Mamluk (1250 – 1380) dynasties, raiding villages and harassing the farmers, and causing a lot of trouble to the prevailing rulers. When Barquq established his Burgi dynasty in 1382, he sent them to Upper Egypt, allowing them to control the produce of Girga Province, which was massive. His intention was to get rid of them in Lower Egypt, close to his headquarters in Cairo, and to compete with the Arab tribes in Upper Egypt and reduce their power. Their influence increased gradually as they defeated the Arabs and obtained control of almost all Upper Egypt, with their control extending from Asyut in the north to Qena in the south. There, their menace was felt by all, particularly the Copts, who at that stage were still a great portion of the population. The influence of the Hawwara was at greatest under Sheikh Hammam (1709 – 1769) under whom he was the ruler de facto of Upper Egypt with the Ottoman authorities in Cairo having little control.\n\nIt is not until the eighteenth century that their influence and power was significantly reduced when Egypt’s then Mamluk Ali Bey al-Kabir (r. 1770 – 1775) defeated Hammam and ended his reign. But the Howarra continued to be a power to reckon with until the early nineteenth century when Ibrahim Pasha, son of Muhammad Ali (1805 – 1848) killed many of them and confiscated their possessions in 1812. Even though the Hawwara lost their political power, they still remain the dominant tribe all over Upper Egypt.\n\nWitnesses to the Hawwara’s evils are available. Such witness was the great Swiss Orientalist Jean Louis Burckhardt (1784 – 1817) who visited Egypt in the early nineteenth century. He arrived in Cairo on 4 September 1812 and travelled to Upper Egypt riding a donkey in January 2013. He then went to Nubia up to Tinareh in the Mahass country just below the 3rd cataract. He then returned back to Egypt and spent the summer of 1813 and winter of 1813/4 in Esna before in March 1814 he went again to Sudan up to Shendi from which he then moved to Hijaz, visiting Mecca and Medina, before he returned to Egypt where he died in 1817. During his long stay in Esna, he visited Asyut. His meticulous notes, in which he described the political and social conditions of Egypt and Sudan, were publishe posthumously in 1818 by the Association for Promoting the Discovery of the Interior Parts of Africa under the title Travels in Nubia.\n\nThe book contains notes by himself about his two journeys to Sudan but also much about Egypt, its tribes and socio-political conditions at the times. Ibrahim Pasha had just crushed the Hawwara and Muhammad Ali had extended his hegemony all over Upper Egypt. In the book are attached three appendices, with Appendix III being Translation of the Notices on Nubia contained in Makrizi’s[1] History and Description of Egypt, called El Khetat, & c.; with Notes.[2]\n\nBurckhardt’s Notes include an important note, Note 80.[3] He wrote in relation to Maqrizi’s The Town of Assouan (Aswan)[4] included in Khetat. Maqrizi writes about the attack of the Arabs Hawwara on Moharram 815 AH (April 1412 AD) on the Arab tribe of Beni Kanz[5] who were occupying Aswan then. Me says that Hawwara forced Beni Kenz to flee Aswan, and they “killed many of them, and reduced to slavery all the women and children whom they took prisoners.”[6] The Hawwara destroyed the walls of Aswan, departed with their captives and left the city in ruins, without inhabitants.[7] Burckhardt notes that it is probably at that epoch the Beni Kenz fled above the cataract [the first cataract], where they reside now.[8]\n\nBurckhardt comments: “The Howara are still settled in the villages from Siout [Asyut] to Farshyout [Farshut][9]. They state their origin to be from a Moggrebyn [Maghareb] tribe.”[10] And he then dedicates the lengthy Note 80 to speak about the Hawwara.\n\nNote 80. In this note, Burckhardt writes about the history of Hawwara and in the conext he writes about their evils the practised towards the Copts, remarking, “None had more to suffer from the Howara than the Copts.”[11] Below, I will reproduce what Burckhardt had to write about that vulturous tribe.\n\n“The Arab tribe of Howara (هوارة) occupy all the villages on both sides of the Nile from near Siout up to Farshiout and Haou on the west, and to near Kenne on the east; at least the principal and most wealthy peasants of these villages belong to that tribe. Until the time of Mohammed Aly they were very powerful, and a branch of them, the Oulad Yahya (أولاد يحيي), settled on the east banks from Badjoura to Kenne (comprising the large villages of Salmye, Kaszer e’Seyad, Faoun, and Disher), were very conspicuous for their rebellious behaviour. The province of the Howara is of all Egypt the richest in horses, and the best breed of Egyptian horses is reared there. Every wealthy peasant kept his horse, and a large corps of cavalry could thus be collected at a moment’s notice. [In a footnote, Burckhardt adds: Their province is at the same time one of the most populous and well cultivated; from the hill of the small town of Tahta I counted 35 villages within reach of the eye]. The Hamam, the principal family of the Howara, had within the last century assumed the whole government of Upper Egypt, south of Siout, and the Mamelouks had been obliged to cede it to them by treaty. Their government was certainly more just than that of the Osmanlis, and although Mamelouks, far from being entitled to praise. The soil was moderately taxed: one Fedhan at Esne, which now pays 14 Patacks to Mohammed Aly, then paid only two Patacks; but extortions were practised upon all merchants, especially at Kenne, and Farshiout, and Girge; and the numerous relations of the Hamam governed in their own districts with great oppression and pride.”[12]\n\nBurckhardt then talks about the practices of the Hawwara towards the Copts, which he describes as enslavement and serfdom, and describes how even Coptic girls were considered their property that they could not get married without the Sheikh’s permission. A practice which took place, and which Burckhardt himself witnessed, was performed before Coptic wedding in which the Sheikh would put an iron chain round the ankles of the bridegroom which he would secure with a padlock and would not open the padlock until the groom made him a present. Only then would the Shiekh restore the freedom of the Coptic girl.\n\n“None had more to suffer from the Howara than the Copts. Such of these people as were not in the service of the Shikhs Hamam, as financiers or writers, but who were employed, as many of them still are, in agriculture or in crafts, especially weaving, were so much exposed to the extortions of the Hamams and the Howara in general, who appear to have been very fanatic, that they found no other means for ensuring repose and protection than by offering themselves in slavery to their oppressors. It thus happened that in every village of southern Egypt, where Copts were settled, the latter chose one of the Howara Shikhs as his master; whom he called “my Bedouin,” (بدويّ), and was called by the Shikh “my Christian,” (نصرانيّ). He became now like a member of his master’s family; if he was poor, the latter sent to his house provisions of corn and butter, and gave him a dress every year; but in return, he was obliged to be constantly attending to his master’s orders; assisting him in his field labours, doing all kind of work for him, and accompanying him on an ass like a servant, whenever the Shikh rode out to meet his equals or superiors. If the Copt happened to be in good circumstances, he was obliged to make occasional presents to his master, who exempted him on that account from hard work, and protected him from the oppressions of any other Shikh. If the daughter of the serf was to be married, the master entered her house on the wedding night, and put an iron chain round her ankles, which he secured with a padlock, and the bridegroom was obliged to make him a present in order to have the padlock opened, and the girl restored to liberty. The possession of these Christians was transmitted by the Shikhs to their descendants, who seldom parted with them, unless they were themselves reduced to poverty, when they sometimes sold them to the protection of other Shikhs. In 1812 a Christian family residing on the east bank, opposite to Siout, was thus sold for two Erdeybs of corn. I am ignorant of the exact time in which this custom took its origin, but I believe it has subsisted only since the establishment of the Hamam. It is still in usage in Upper Egypt, in many parts of the open country, and especially in the most southern districts, where the peasants, although quite in subjection to the Pasha, are left in their own villages to act at pleasure, the government caring little for the impositions practised by the village Shikh upon poor individuals, provided the land tax be regularly paid. During my stay at Esne, I was well acquainted with several Christians who were thus the hereditary slaves or servants of great Shikhs, and I have myself assisted at the ceremony of tying the chain at the wedding.”[13]\n\nBurckhardt then finishes off his history of the hawwara:\n\n“The Hamams were not quiet possessors of Upper Egypt even after the Mamelouks had made peace with them. They were exposed on the northern side to continual attacks from the Libyan Bedouin tribes of Tarhoun, Amaym, Djahame, Rabaya, and others, who dwell in the desert west of Siout and in the plain towards Beni Ady, and many accounts of battles fought between them and the Howara are still related. On the south, the tribe of Kaszas (قصاص) who people the country on the west banks from Thebes to near Esne, and to whom belong the inhabitants of Gourne, Orment, and Reheygat (all celebrated for their bold plundering enterprises) were their determined enemies; although both these and the Howara report that they have the same origin from Barbary. When, after Aly Beg, the Mamelouk power had increased in Egypt, the Hamams were attacked by them, and defeated in several bloody encounters, and the chief Hamam being wounded, fled to Esne, where he died. He was buried at Nagady opposite Kous. The treasure, in cash, which he had accumulated was in vain searched for; his people put to the torture, confessed that he had buried it in the mountains behind Haou; but nothing could be found, although to this day many a ruined peasant or pedlar, or necromancer wanders in that direction in the hopes of finding it. The power of the Hamams was thus destroyed, but that of the Howara remained, and the Mamelouk Begs, though often at war with them, could never break their strength. A part of them, the Oulad Yahya, for instance, were often entirely independent, and the village Shikhs themselves received the land tax from the peasants.\n\nWhen Mohammed Aly had succeeded in driving away the Mamelouks, he was several years before he could reduce the Howara. His governors in Upper Egypt, Abdim Beg, Saleh Aga, Hassan Pasha, sacked many of their villages, but it was his own son, Ibrahim Pasha, who firmly settled his authority by acts of great rigour and severity, having killed by the sword or the executioner at least 2000 Howara. He changed the Shikhs of villages, in the same manner as the Wahabi chief had changed the Shikhs of the Arabian tribes; he disunited the villages among themselves, and punished with celerity and without any mercy all those who opposed the smallest obstacles to his authority. The last village sacked by Ibrahim Pasha in Upper Egypt was Orment, the chief place of the Kaszas, who had withheld their tribute. In the autumn of 1 813, he fell by night upon that village, killed about 80 of the principal people and plundered all. Since that time Upper Egypt is completely reduced to submission. The Howara have now been obliged to abandon their horses, none but the Shikhs of villages dare keep any, and their dreaded cavalry is thus completely reduced. The descendants of Hamam, the chief, still remain; I knew a nephew of his at Farshiout and another at Esne; the latter had several Christians belonging to his family as serfs.”[14]\n\nIn a footnote to “and the village Shikhs themselves received the land tax from the peasants” above, Burckhardt writes: “In every part of the province of the Howara the land was assessed not by the Fedhan or acre, as it is now; but every district had to pay an annual round sum, and the Shikhs of villages were at liberty to partition it out according to their pleasure, by which they accumulated great wealth. The Howara Shikhs were renowned for their hospitality. I alighted one night in the house of one of them in a village near the site of Abydus, where I found upwards of sixty people sitting down to supper in the court-yard of the house.”\n\n____________________________\n\n[1] The Egyptian historian during the Burji Mamluk dynasty, Al-Maqrizi (1364 – 1442).
