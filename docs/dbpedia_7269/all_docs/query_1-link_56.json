        "text": "himself the higher title of Khedive (Viceroy), as did his successors, Ibrahim Pasha, Abbas I, and Sa'id I. This however was not granted until 1866 when Ismael Pasha was promoted to the rank of Khedive by Imperial Firman.\n\nAs a result of the British interests after the opening of the Suez canal in 1869, Egypt gravitated into the British sphere of interest in the region and after 1882 the khedive was but a British puppet ruler. In 1914, at the outbreak of WW I, the British secured their position by declaring Egypt a protectorate, and promoted the Ottoman vilayet to an autonomous sultanate. In 1922 the protectorate was abolished and Egypt became a sovereign kingdom. This was overthrown by revolting generals who proclaimed a republic in 1953.\n\nUnderlining his military independence within the Ottoman Empire, Muhammad Ali created a system of distinguishing flags for the navy that was different from the Ottoman system. Probably it dates back to the naval campaigns in the twenties of the 19th century. The flags were the flags for the rear admial, the vice-admiral and the admiral, showing on a red field a crescent with one, two and three six-pointed stars respectively. A personal flag for Mohammed Ali himself showed three crescents-and-stars on a red field and this corresponds with the rank of Grand admiral or the admiral of the (Egyptian) fleet.\n\nDistinguishing Flags of the Egyptian and Ottoman Navy, 1841 ca\n\nð Note that the flag of Muhammad Ali corresponds with the flag of the Grand-admiral of the Porte.\n\nIt is possible that these flags were also the distinguishing flags of the corresponding ranks of the army but nothing is known about such flags.\n\nThe flag of Muhammad Ali himself, the six-pointed stars replaced by five-pointed ones was also flown as the personal flags of later rulers of Egypt, bearing the title of khedive and sultan. We may assume that in fact not these titles were symbolized, but the rank of grand-admiral or admiral of the (Egyptian) fleet. It was only abandoned in 1922 with the establishment of the kingdom when it was replaced by a blue flag with the royal arms between four royal crowns in the corners.\n\nThe coat of arms of the ruler of Egypt showed a crescent and three stars from about the second half of the reign of Muhammad Ali until 1952. The only exception of this rule are the arms of Abbas Hilmi II (1879-1914) who introduced a coat of arms with three crescents and stars in about 1907 and the arms of his successors, sultans of Egypt until 1922.\n\nThe arms of Muhammad Ali and his son Ibrahim (r. 1848) showed the crescent and stars on a red background, corresponding with the rank of admiral (at the Morea campaign 1825-28). Such arms, the horns of the crescent to the sinister for difference, were also borne by the tenth son of Muhammad Ali, Said, who was also an admiral and ruled 1854-63.\n\nThe colours were changed by Ismael who was a son of Ibrahim, and was born when his father was the Commander in Chief of the Army (from July 1829). His arms were blue, the crescent in the same position as on the arms of his predecessor. Since then the arms of the khedives, sultans and kings of Egypt have always been blue, probably symbolizing the rank of Field Marshal or Commander in Chief (of the army) [1]. He also introduced six (2 Í3) tughs or horse-tails as supporters of the arms, symbolizing the rank of (a turkish) vizier which was as much as a vice-roy or, in the Egyptian case, akhedive.\n\nA third innovation were the national arms which consisted of a red shield with three crescents and stars (as on the princely flag). These were depicted horns to the sinister. In the time of the Sultanate they were turned horns upwards.\n\nPhoto courtesy Ahmed Kamel\n\nVault in the Shubra Palace in Cairo, about 1820 [4]\n\nThe emblems and names of Muhammad Ali and his son Ibrahim\n\nThe vault shows the badges of distinction of an admiral of the Egyptian Navy being red charged with a crescent an three stars. The name of Muhammad Ali is on the right and written on a blue background, the name of his son is written on a green background. These colors are the colors of administrative authority and of the commander in chief, red being the color of armed authority. Indeed Ibrahim was promoted Chief Commander of the Army (and Grand Admiral) in July 1829. His father had been recognized a Vali (Governor) in 1805. [5]\n\nThe Muhammad Ali Dynastys use of the title Khedive was not sanctioned by the Ottoman Empire until 1867 when Sultan Abdülaziz confirmed Ismail Pasha in the title of Khedive (Viceroy) of Egypt and the Sudan, together with the style of Sa'adat Sahib al-Tal'a al-vaiqa al-Khedivi al-Afkham wa'l-duari al-Akram, and the establishment of male primogeniture in the direct line of the reigning Khedive as the rule of succession by Imperial Ottoman Firman 17th May 1866 (confirmed 8th June 1873) Moreover, the Porte accepted Ismail's alteration of the royal line of succession to go from father to son, rather than brother to brother, as was the tradition in the Ottoman Empire, and Arab dynasties. In May 1879, the British Empire, and France began pressuring the Ottoman Sultan Abdülhamid II to depose Ismail Pasha, and this was done on June 26, 1879. The more pliable Tawfik Pasha, Ismail's son, was made his successor as the new Khedive. Ismail Pasha left Egypt and initially went into exile to Naples, but was eventually permitted by Sultan Abdülhamid II to retire to his Palace of Emirgan on the Bosporus in Constantinople. There he remained, more or less a state prisoner, until his death. He was later buried in Cairo.\n\nWith the outbreak of the First World War, Abbas Hilmi Pasha sided with the Ottoman Empire, which had joined the war on the side of the Central Powers, and was subsequently deposed by the British, who declared Egypt a protectorate, which means formally adding a territory to British sovereignty under a subordinate ruler, while he was on a visit to Vienna. His uncle Hussein Kamel was declared Sultan of Egypt by the British, who declared severance of the nominal ties of Egypt and Sudan to the Ottoman Empire (at least arguably invalid under international law, which did/does not allow acquisition of title to territory unless the existing sovereign, i.e., the Ottoman Empire, cedes it), and brought an end to the use of the title of Khedive.\n\nBy a telegram of 28 February 1922 from the British government Sultan Ahmad Fuad was informed that the United Kingdom had terminated the Protectorate over Egypt and that it recognised her as an independent sovereign state, with certain reservations pertaining to territorial defence and communications. On 15 March 1922 he assumed the title of King of Egypt and of Sudan, Sovereign of Nubia, of Kordofan and of Darfur, together with the style of Hazrat Sahib al-Jalala (His Majesty). On 16 March 1922 the independence of Egypt was proclaimed.\n\nWith Article 17 of the Treaty of Lausanne of 14 July 1923, Turkey formally ceded (retroactive to 5 November 1914) all remaining claims and rights in Egypt and Sudan\n\nShortly afterwards a new achievement was adopted. It is:\n\nArms: Azure, a crescent in base and three mullets one and two Argent.\n\nCrown: The Egyptian Royal Crown.\n\nOrder: The collar and jewel of the Order of Muhammad Ali. (1915)\n\nMantle: Purpure, fringed and tasseled Or, lined Ermine and crowned with the crown of the arms.\n\nAdopted 10.12.1923\n\nð See illustration in the head of this essay.\n\nThe national flag of Egypt was, in the time of Ottoman rule, the flag of the Government of the Ottoman Empire consisting of a white decrescent-and-star on a red cloth. This was the official flag until 1914/1923.\n\nIt was replaced in 1914 by the flag of the Commander of the Fleet of Egypt, consisting of three white decrescents-and-stars on a red cloth.\n\nIn 1923 this flag was replaced by a white decrescent-and-three stars on a green field.\n\n! Usually the Muslim flags were flowing to the left (like arab and hebrew script is written from the right to the left) and, as the crescents turn their horns to the left also, they have to be called crescents increscents. In most European sources however, the flags are usually drawn flowing from left to right (the mast end at the left) and so, in that case, the crescents have to be called decrescents.!\n\nThe crescent made a decrescent on a red field, the arms supported by army standards showing three crescents-and-stars on a red cloth.\n\nProbably from the time of Ismael who, in some other instances, decorated his cypher with several European Orders.\n\nHe received:\n\n- The Orders of Glory (Atiq Nishan-i-Iftikhar), of the Osmans (Nishan-i-Osmanieh) special class in brilliants, and Nobility (Nishan-i-Majidieh) special class in brilliants (11.4.1863) of Turkey, Knt. of the Orders of the Anunziata of Italy, and Black Eagle of Prussia (30.12.1868), GC of the Orders of SS Maurice & Lazarus, and the Crown of Italy (25.5.1869), Leopold of Belgium (1862), Sword of Sweden (27.7.1866), the Netherlands Lion (27.10.1866), Legion of Honour of France (1867), Red Eagle of Prussia (30.12.1868), Redeemer of Greece (29.5.1869), and Leopold of Austria (29.5.1869), the Order of the Brilliant Star of Zanzibar 1st class (1875).
