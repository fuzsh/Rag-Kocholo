He met Lord and Lady Blessington in 1822 and was romantically interested in Lady Blessington. Perhaps to divert D’Orsay’s attention from his wife, Lord Blessington wrote a will leaving his Irish property to one of his daughters, should either marry Count D’Orsay. D’Orsay chose 15 year old Lady Harriet Anne Gardiner and the couple married in Naples in 1827. It was not a happy union. Following the death of Lord Blessington and the breakdown of the Count’s marriage, D’Orsay and Lady Blessington became a prominent couple in fashionable society. D’Orsay died in Paris in 1852, having fled there with Lady Blessington to escape his debts.\n\nExplore\n\nDetails\n\nTitle\n\nIbrahim Pasha (1789-1848) Egyptian General\n\nDate\n\nMedium\n\nPencil and watercolour on paper\n\nDimensions\n\nheight: 26.80 cm, width: 18.80 cm\n\nAcquisition\n\nPurchased from Colnaghi, February 1955\n\nInscription\n\nbelow image: [centre] Ibrahim Pasha\n\nGAC number\n\n3050"
