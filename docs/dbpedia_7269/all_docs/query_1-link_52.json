        "text": "DEATH OF MEHEMLT ALI.\n\nThe celebrated ex-Pasha of Egypt,\n\nMehemet Ali, died at Alexandria,\n\nand on the following day his\n\nbody was taken up to Cairo, where\n\nhe was buried in the new\n\nalabaster mosque built by himself in\n\nthe citadel. The funeral procession\n\nfrom the palace at Ras-el-teen to the\n\ncanal was attended by a great concourse\n\nof people, the European consuls in\n\nuniform, with many of the European\n\nresidents, and a great number of troops\n\nwith arms reversed On emerging from\n\nthe palace the coffin was laid at the\n\nfoot of the grand marble staircase, the\n\nattendants gathered round, and the chief\n\nmufti, a venerable old man, advanced,\n\nraised his hands, and amidst profound\n\nsilence, repeated three times, with a\n\npause for mental reflection between\n\neach, \"Allah hoo akbar\" (God is\n\ngreat) ; after which he twice repeated\n\n\" Salem aleykoun \" (Peace be with\n\nyou) ; and then the procession started,\n\nthe principal officers and grandees\n\nemulating each other for the honour of\n\ncarrying the coffin on their shoulders.\n\nOn passing the harem, a separate\n\nbuilding a little to the north of the\n\npalace, the shrieks and lamentations\n\nof the women were most piercing.\n\nTwenty-six buffaloes were killed and\n\ndistributed among the poor, with twenty-\n\nsix camel loads of bread and dates, and\n\na considerable sum of money.\n\nAt Cairo there was no ceremony\n\nattending the conveyance of the Pasha's\n\nbody from the Nile to its final resting\n\nplace, and even Abbas Pasha, the\n\npresent Viceroy, joined the funeral\n\nonly at the mosque.\n\nMehemet Ali's first severe illness\n\noccurred in January, 1848, when he\n\nproceeded to Malta and Naples, where\n\nhaving rallied a little, he returned to\n\nEgypt in April, improved in bodily\n\nhealth, but with his constitution shat-\n\ntered and his mental faculties totally\n\nprostrated. The cares of the govern-\n\nment were, therefore, transferred to his\n\nson Ibrahim Pasha, who was succeeded\n\nat his death by Abbas Pasha.\n\nMehemet Ali is sincerely regretted\n\nboth by the European residents and the\n\nnatives of Egypt.\n\nThe following details respecting the\n\ncareer of, certainly, one of the most\n\nremarkable men of the age, will prove\n\ninteresting at this moment:—\n\nMehemet Ali was born in the town\n\nof Cavalla in Roumelia, the ancient\n\nMacedonia. In Mohammedan coun-\n\ntries the natives keep no reckoning of\n\ntheir age, but it was commonly said he\n\nwas born in 1769, thus making him at\n\nhis death of the age of 80 years, which\n\nmay be considered correct within a year\n\nor two.\n\nMehemet Ali first commenced life as\n\na tobacconist in his native town, but he\n\nafterwards volunteered into the army,\n\nto which his taste was more congenial.\n\nIn his new career he soon obtained\n\nhigh favour with the Governor of\n\nCavalla by his efficient assistance in\n\nquelling and dispersing a band of\n\npirates, and on the death of his com-\n\nmanding officer he was appointed to\n\nsucceed him, and married his widow.\n\nIn 1792 the town of Cavalla having\n\nbeen called upon by the Sultan to pro-\n\nvide its contingent of 300 men for the\n\nexpulsion of the French from Egypt,\n\nthe Governor sent the required number,\n\nheaded by his son, with Mehemet Ali\n\nunder his orders; but shortly after\n\nlanding at Aboukir the son returned to\n\nRoumelia and left Mehemet Ali in\n\ncommand. In all the engagements\n\nwith the French Mehemet Ali distin-\n\nguished himself by his conduct and\n\nvalour. He rapidly rose in rank, and\n\nhis lofty spirit gained him a strong\n\nascendancy over the minds of his\n\nsoldiers.\n\nAfter the evacuation of Egypt by the\n\nFrench in September, 1801, the Sultan\n\nappointed Mohammed Khosrew Viceroy\n\nof Egypt, who has since been several\n\ntimes Prime Minister at Constantinople,\n\nand between whom and Mehemet Ali\n\nthere always existed an inveterate\n\nhatred.\n\nThe Mamelukes were, at that time,\n\nactively engaged in endeavouring to re-\n\ncover their ascendency, which had been\n\noverthrown by the French. Mehemet\n\nAli joined their faction, and after various\n\nchanges of fortune, under successive\n\ngovernors of the province, the inhabi-\n\ntants of Cairo, suffering from the disor-\n\nders of a military insurrection, deposed\n\nKhourshid Pasha—addressed themselves\n\nto Mehemet Ali for protection, and\n\nmade him viceroy. He was subsequently\n\ninstalled in the Pashalic of Egypt in\n\n1806, on condition that he would send\n\nto the Sultan 4000 purses, which repre-\n\nsented, at that time, the sum of\n\nabout £240,000 sterling. The\n\nPashalic of Egypt was then commonly\n\ncalled the Pashalic of Cairo, and it ex-\n\ntended only to Middle Egypt and the\n\nDelta ; Upper Egypt being divided into\n\nseveral districts, administered by the\n\nMameluke Beys; and Alexandria, with\n\na part of the western province, by a\n\nPasha independent of the Pasha of Cairo.\n\nA few months after the installation of\n\nMehemet Ali, in the Pashalic of Egypt.\n\nthe Porte consented to give him, also,\n\nthe Pashalic of Alexandria, as a reward\n\nfor the services he had rendered to the\n\nOttoman Empire, in 1807, on the occa-\n\nsion of the evacuation of Lower Egypt\n\nand the city of Alexandria, by the\n\nEnglish.\n\nIn 1808 Mehemet Ali received orders\n\nfrom the Porte, to attack and disperse\n\nthe Wahabees, a fanatical sect of the\n\nMohammedan religion, who had pillaged\n\nthe holy cities of Mecca and Medina.\n\nBefore engaging in this war, and draw-\n\ning his troops out of Egypt, the Viceroy\n\ndetermined upon putting a final end to\n\nthe power of his old allies, the Mame-\n\nlukes. Accordingly, on the 1st of\n\nMarch, 1811, the Mamelukes were in-\n\nvited, in a body, to the citadel at Cairo,\n\nto attend at the investure of the Viceroy 's\n\nson Toussoon, as chief of the expedition\n\nagainst the Wahabees. When the cere-\n\nmony was over, the Mamelukes mounted\n\ntheir horses, but on reaching the citadel\n\ngates, they found them closed, and a\n\nsudden discharge of musketry, fronm\n\nsoldiers placed on the walls, completely\n\nannihilated them. A great many Mame-\n\nlukes were put to death, at the same\n\ntime, in the provinces. It has been\n\ncomputed that 470, with their chief\n\nIbrahim Bey, perished in the citadel;\n\nand in the city and throughout the\n\ncountry, no less than 1200 were killed.\n\nThus ended the power of these formida-\n\nble chiefs, who had kept Egypt in a\n\nstate of anarchy and warfare, ever since\n\nthe year 1382.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Mame-\n\nlukes, Mehemet Ali made himself master\n\nof Upper Egypt. He obtained from the\n\nSublime Porte the government of that\n\npart of the country, and, at the same\n\ntime considerably increased the land-tax\n\nand the duties of customs on the internal\n\ntrade.\n\nIn the Autumn of 1811, Mehemet Ali\n\nsent his army into Arabia, against the\n\nWahabees. This war lasted six years,\n\ncost the Viceroy immense sums of\n\nmoney and a great number of men, and\n\nwas finally brought to a close by Ibra-\n\nhim Pasha. In 1813 Mehemet Ali\n\nhimself went to the Hedjaz for a time,\n\nto hasten the result of the expedition.\n\nDuring his absence the Porte, jealous of\n\nhis power secretly appointed Lateef\n\nPasha Viceroy of Egypt, but Mahom-\n\nmed Bey, Mehemet Allis Minister of\n\nWar, pretending to enter into the views\n\nof Lateef Pasha, engaged him to declare\n\nhimself publicly Viceroy of Egypt, and\n\nthen decapitated him.\n\nIn 1815, Mehemet Ali, convinced of\n\nthe great advantages of discipline and\n\nmilitary tactics in the art of warfare,\n\nresolved upon having his army properly\n\ndrilled, but his soldiers were very ad-\n\nverse to this measure, and threatened an\n\ninsurrection. He therefore sent his\n\nmutinous troops into Ethiopia under\n\nhis third son, Ismael Pasha, who, on\n\nthat occasion, conquered the provinces\n\nof Dongola, Berber, Shendy, Sennaar,\n\nand Cordofan, whilst he raised a new\n\narmy, which was drilled by French and\n\nItalian officers. He then offered the\n\nSultan to assist in quelling the Greek\n\ninsurrection against the Porte, and on\n\nthe 16th of July, 1824, Mehemet Ali's\n\nfleet, consisting of 163 vessels, sailed for\n\nthe Mores, under the command of\n\nIbrahim Pasha, who for three years\n\nkept the country m subjection, but was\n\nobliged to retire after the battle of Na-\n\nvarino on the 20th of October, 1827.\n\nMehemet Ali then turned his thoughts\n\nto obtaining possession of Syria, and six\n\nthousand Egyptians having emigrated\n\nto that country, he demanded the resti-\n\ntution of them from Abdallah Pasha,\n\nthen Governor of Acre. The reply he\n\nobtained was, that the emigrants were\n\nsubjects of the Sublime Porte, and that\n\nthey were in the Sultan's dominions as\n\nwell in Syria as in Egypt. The Vice-\n\nroy sent him word that he himself would\n\ncome and tax his six thousand subjects\n\n\"and one man more.\" Accordingly,\n\non the 2nd of November, 1831, Mehe-\n\nmet Ali sent into Syria a powerful army\n\nunder the command of his son, Ibrahim\n\nPasha, who in a few months reduced the\n\nwhole country to submission. On this,\n\nthe Porte declared Mehemet Ali a rebel,\n\nand sent a strong army into Syria; but\n\nIbrahim Pasha's troops invariably over-\n\ncame the Sultan's, and several important\n\nbattles were fought, which insured to\n\nthe Egyptians the possession of the\n\ncountry. The European powers inter-\n\nfered, and under their guarantee, peace\n\nwas signed on the 14th of May, 1833.\n\nSyria and the district of Adana were\n\ncened to Mehemet Ali, in conjunction\n\nwith the Pashalic of Egypt, on his\n\nacknowledging himself a vassal of the\n\nSultan, and engaging to remit to the\n\nPorte the same tribute as the former\n\nPashas of Syria. According to this\n\narrangement Mehenet Ali paid for\n\nEgypt 12,000 purses; Syria and Adana\n\n18,000 purses; and Candia 2,000 purses;\n\nmaking together 32,000 purses, or\n\n£160,000 sterling per annum.\n\nMehemet Ali continued in the quiet\n\npossession of Syria until 1849, but the\n\nPorte disliked very much the occupa-\n\ntion of that country by the Viceroy of\n\nEgypt, so that after organising an army\n\nand a strong fleet in the beginning of\n\n1820, the Sultan Mahmoud sent his\n\ntroops into Syria under the command of\n\nHafiz Pasha to expel the Egyptians,\n\nbut Ibrahim Pasha proved too powerful\n\nfor bim, and the Turkish army had to"
