        "text": "16th February 2023 marks 100 years since the opening of the burial chamber of King Tutankhamen. We’ve been doing some digging and it’s amazing what you can find buried in the archives.\n\nSurviving in our collections is a curious deposit of 3 small photographs of the interior of Tutankhamun’s tomb, Egypt, taken by an anonymous photographer on active service with the RAF in the 1930s.\n\nThe widely documented discovery of King Tut’s tomb in the Valley of the Kings was in 1922. The excavation team, led by Howard Carter, went on to open the final burial chamber in February the following year. Meaningful exploration of the Valley of the Kings began as early as the 18th century. The first modern map of the area was published in 1743, and an expedition by Napoleon in 1799 recorded tombs in the Western Valley. European explorations continued throughout the 19th century, despite Giovanni Belzoni reportedly declaring around 1817 that all the tombs had been found.\n\nContinue reading “Excavation in the Archives” →\n\nIn this blog post I will be introducing the Black History Collection. I will explain what it is, my endeavour to allow greater access to the collection, and describe a few choice items from the collection that caught my attention.\n\nAs the name suggests, this collection does indeed contain material relating to Black history but it also includes other topics including Asian history, culture, arts, the Black and Asian experience in the UK, and other diverse topics such as the climate and topography of the Indian sub-continent.\n\nThe collection currently contains over 9000 books and is continually being expanded with new additions to the collection. The Black History Collection has grown from collections held within previous departments of Birmingham Central Library including Central Lending, Information Services and Archives and Heritage, with the Library of Birmingham continually adding material to the collection. This collection is currently housed within the Archives and Collections Department of the Library of Birmingham.\n\nThe Library of Birmingham’s Black History collection contains many fascinating glimpses into the history and culture of diverse ethnic and cultural groups around the world.\n\nI am currently in the process of re-cataloguing these items, so they will be visible on the public version of the Library catalogue, I have been working on material concerning Egyptian history and culture (962.00 Dewey reference).\n\nWhilst I continue to modify items on the catalogue, some interesting items have come to light.\n\nThis book is called “A Sketch of Egyptian History” by Lady Amherst of Hackney (962.00) which I particularly like because of its delightful cover and illustrations, some of which are shown below.\n\nThis reproduction of a watercolour from “A Sketch of Egyptian History” is a particularly nice illustration of a traditional Egyptian sailing vessel called a felucca, typically used in the eastern Mediterranean, and especially along the Nile and the Red Sea.\n\nThe image below is a reproduction of another watercolour painting showing the Mahdi’s tomb. The Mahdi, Muhammad Ahmad, was born and raised in the Sudan in the mid-19th century, when most of north-east Africa was under the foreign rule of the Ottoman and British empires. In 1881 he began to organize an uprising against foreign rule, and his followers began to refer to him as Mahdi (Saviour).\n\nLady Amherst (1857-1919), the author of this book and otherwise known as Mary Rothes Margaret Cecil, 2nd Baroness Amherst (nee Tyssen-Amherst) was, among other things, an amateur archaeologist, and her excavations at the archaeological site of Aswan uncovered thirty two of the ‘Tombs of the Nobles’. For a number of years, these were known as the ‘Cecil Tombs’.\n\nAnother book that caught my eye was called “Akhenaten: King of Egypt” [962.01 AKH] by the English egyptologist, art historian and author, Cyril Aldred (1914-1991). I like this one for the images of a people who lived approximately 1353–1336 BCE. The plain cover might not look very exciting, but if you look inside and you will see some fascinating images taken from artefacts dating from 3370 years ago including a statue of Akhenaten and a limestone relief of Akhenaten and his Queen.\n\nMy work on the Black history collection has primarily focused on providing the public with greater access to the contents of the collection by uploading updated catalogue entries to the online catalogue. Before my contribution, relatively few catalogue entries could be viewed on the online catalogue by the public.\n\nYou can read more about the Black History Collection here. There are also source guides available on Birmingham Black heritage resources and Birmingham Asian heritage resources via the links.\n\nCultural exchange programmes are not new and it turns out Birmingham was involved in an example of one in the early nineteenth century.\n\nMuhammad Ali Pasha (1769-1849) was ruler of Egypt from 1805 to 1848 and is known as “the Father of Modern Egypt”. His reign was not without controversy as he sought to shape Egypt along more “European” lines in a move to compete with European industrialisation.\n\nOne of his projects was to send students to Europe to both learn about science and industry in European countries and to promote Islamic and Egyptian culture in the various Western European countries where they were based.\n\nFour students came to England: Ali Effendi, Mohammed Effendi, Omar Effendi and Selim Aga.\n\nIn 1833 Selim visited Birmingham which was reported in a letter between James Watt junior and Matthew Robinson Boulton:\n\n“My dear Sir\n\nYesterday I shewed your Mint to Selim Aga and Mr. Sanderson. The former is a young military officer, who has been compleating his education at Woolwich, and is quite unacquainted with the subject of Coinage. He is however a very intelligent, civil person… Selim is about to return to Egypt, and I have no doubt that… he should report personally to the Pacha what he had seen; which I have little doubt he will do favourably, as well as our progress with his Engines.”\n\n[MS 3782/13/56/104]\n\nAs the letter suggests the firm of Boulton and Watt in turn benefited by building a steam boat for the Pasha (either Muhammad Ali Pasha himself or possibly his son Ibrahim Pasha) which was called “The Nile” and learning about Islamic culture.\n\nRachel MacGregor"
