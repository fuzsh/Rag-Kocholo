        "text": "Africa, has memorable father -. but to carry on\n\nhis principles, to substantiate his bold sp -cula\n\ntions, and to follow the example of his genius\n\nan success, were the works of no ordinary\n\nmind. We must regard the death of such a\n\nman, after a reign so brief as two months, at a\n\ncalamity to Egypt.\n\nIbrahim Pasha died at the age of fifty-nine,\n\nhaving been for a considerable period declining\n\nin health. About two years ago he took a\n\nvoyage to Europe, apparently with the object of\n\nconsulting physician ; but the motives of men\n\nin his rank are seldom the acknowledged ones,\n\nand it appears much more likely that his real\n\nmotive was to visit the two, great naval courts\n\nof Europe, and ascertain for himself what was\n\nthe actual policy of England and France with\n\nrespect to Egypt. Certainly, while in this\n\ncountry he seemed to have but little to do with\n\nplay sciatica. He Went everywhere, was perpetually\n\non foot, saw everything, and had near the\n\nslightest look of an invalid. He was a strong,\n\n' firm-set figure, with a stern and intelligent\n\n. countenance, a firm step, and a lofty air.\n\nI Though his stature was not above the middle\n\nj size, it was dignified, and gave the impression\n\nI of a man accustomed to lead in the great con-\n\nj cerns of mankind. He evinced great curiosity\n\nI with respect to all our establishments. The\n\ni military and naval, of course, naturally occupied\n\nhis first attention ; but he made a tour of the\n\nmanufacturing districts, and, we believe, carried\n\nback with him specimens of that manufacturing\n\ningenuity which forms one of the real wonders\n\nof our country and our time.\n\nOn his return home he found his memorable\n\nfather sinking into mental decay, and was forced\n\nto undertake the responsibilities of a government\n\nwhich, though small, is probably among\n\nthe most complicated and anxious in the world.\n\nHe had returned for the purpose of retirement,\n\nand of attending to his health, which had probably\n\nbeen shaken by the fatigues of his\n\ncampaigns.\"\n\nThe incapacity of Mehemet Ali, however,\n\nmade it necessary that he should undertake the\n\ngovernment land in September last he was appointed\n\nViceroy by the firman of the Sultan.\n\nThe reports of his dying in consequence of his\n\nearly excesses seem to have no foundation\n\nbeyond the gossipping which discovers a profli-\n\ngate reason for every event in the career of\n\ndistinguished men. The frame which could\n\nhave endured the fatigues of war for forty years\n\nin Arabia, Greece, and Syria, could not have\n\nbeen habitually infirm and the disease of which\n\nhe died, bronchitis and inflammation of the\n\nlungs, might have occurred to the most temperate\n\nand moral of mankind.\n\nIbrahim, though a Turk \" thy blood, was a\n\nGreek by birth. All his father's family were of\n\nSalonica, and Mehemet Ali himself is\" said to\n\nhave been, in boyhood, the last survivor of\n\nthirteen children The pedigrees of Turkish\n\nfamilies are, perhaps, not very accurately kept;\n\nbut, if this statement be true, the success and\n\nrenown of this thirteenth child of the oil-seller\n\nof Salonica is among the most singular freaks of\n\nfortune. We believe that Ali was a conscript and\n\nthis, too, is another curious instance of\n\nfortune. The service into which he was forced\n\nwas the path to a throne, and to more than a\n\nthrone-to a name-which the history of the\n\nmost brilliant and characteristic period of\n\nEurope will never suffer to be forgotten.\n\nAll's talent and daring raised him in the\n\nTurkish ranks; he soon commanded a battalion,\n\nand long before he was sent into Egypt he had\n\ngiven evidence that he was an extraordinary\n\nman His massacre of the Mamelukes. was an\n\nact of blood, but it was Turkish, and was probably\n\nthe result of a direct command from\n\nConstantinople. Yet great offences against\n\npublic faith are seldom unpunished, and it is not\n\nimprobable, that the subsequent loss of Egypt,\n\nand its possession by the very instrument commissioned\n\nby Elie Sultan for this massacre, may\n\nhave been the visitation on Turkey for the\n\nblood of the Mamelukes, dangerous, and\n\neven guilty, as they were. From that time to\n\nhis latest hour of government Mehemet Ali was\n\nthe scourge of the Ottoman Porte.\n\nThe first command of Ibrahim Pasha was at\n\nthe head of an army to recover Mecca and\n\nMedina from the Wahabees. The wax was one\n\nof discipline against fanaticism. It was harassing\n\nand hazardous. But the exchequer of\n\nMehemet Ali was too powerful for the rude\n\ncourage of the Arabs. They were finally driven\n\ninto the wilderness, to recruit their valour and\n\ntheir vengeance. But the restorer of Mecca\n\nand Medina had entitled himself to the gratitude\n\nof all Islamism. Ibrahim was received in Cane\n\nwith an African triumph ; Egypt resounded\n\nwith acclamations and even the sultan felt the\n\nnecessity of honouring the Egyptian champion\n\nof the faith, and gave him the title of Pasha of\n\nthe Holy Cities.\n\nIbrahim had now established his character as\n\nan intelligent and enterprising general and\n\nwhen the Sultan (in 1824) made his last effort\n\nto recover Greece, he was put in command of a\n\nforce of 20,000 men and sent to the Morea.\n\nThe Greeks were inveterately hostile ; but their\n\ndeficiency in combination, their habitual faction,\n\nand their national poverty, made them feeble\n\nantagonists to the disciplined, paid, and actively\n\ncommanded troops of the Egyptian general.\n\nThe Mores was conquered in a three years'\n\nwar of skirmishes. The allied powers then in-\n\nterposed, and commanded Ibrahim to retire.\n\nHis gallant answer was that, \" if a single soldier\n\nlanded, he would never retire but with his\n\nfeet foremost.\" But he was unprepared for\n\nthe guns of the allied fleets. The battle of\n\nNavarino (October 20, 1827) was fought, and\n\nthe Egyptian army was sent home. This battle,\n\nwhich the first of all military authorities pronounced\n\n\"untoward,\" and which had the immediate\n\neffect of enfeebling Turkey, was the\n\nwork of that Whig propagandists which, short-sighted\n\nin everything, has constantly employed\n\nitself in contradicting every maxim of the policy\n\nof our ancestors.\n\nThe Turkish declaration of war against\n\nEgypt produced, in 1834, the invasion of Syria by\n\nthe army under the command of Ibrahim. He\n\noverran the country with the rapidity, and\n\nmore than the success, of Napoleon, swept the\n\ncoast, captured Acre and finished, the campaign\n\nby the battle of Koniah, in which he totally\n\ndefeated the Turkish army of 60,000 men, and\n\ntook its general prisoner.\n\nA more brilliant prize now seemed within his\n\ngrasp. He rushed across the chain of the\n\nTaurus, poured down through Asia Minor, and\n\nhad arrived within a few marches of Con-\n\nstantinople when it was announced to him that a\n\nRussian army was already between him and the\n\ncapital !\n\nHe had now no alternative but to retire. He\n\nretreated on Syria. The Turks at length\n\nfollowed him, with a new army. He turned\n\non them, and in the battle of sexes he broke\n\ndown the last hope of the Sultan.\n\nConstantinople was again before him but\n\nthe allied powers again rescued it, and resolved\n\nto confine Mehemet Ali to Egypt. His army,\n\ntaken by surprise, was forced from the field\n\nAcre, the commanding point of the coast, which had\n\ncost Napoleon sixty days of fruitless siege,\n\nand Ibrahim six months for its capture, was\n\ncrushed by a four hours' fire of the British\n\nfleet, on the memorable 3d of November, 1839.\n\nThis exploit, which transcended all that\n\nhad been known of the power of batteries on\n\nsea, instantly finished the war. The Egyptian\n\narmy gave up Syria, to the Turk, and peace with\n\nEgypt has since been unbroken.\n\nIbrahim has left three sons, but the succession,\n\nby the Turkish law, goes to Abbas Pasha,\n\nhis eldest nephew. The present Viceroy is\n\nsaid to he a retired but intelligent person,\n\naccomplished in Oriental literature, and acquainted\n\nwith the value of peace and of English\n\nconnection.\n\nThe New Elfi fric Lioht -A\" s pond experimental\n\nexhibition of the new idea free light\n\ntook place on Tuesday night upon the steps\n\nforming the entrance to the National Gallery\n\nand the Royal Academy. There was a large\n\nattendance of scientific gentlemen and noble-\n\nmen. Upon the summit of the steps a kind of\n\nvessel was raised, The death which were placed the\n\nbattery and a small lamp. About a foot above\n\nthe battery was the light produced burning\n\niiiKjii two pieces of charcoal, backed by a single\n\ntin reflector, and the light enclosed within a\n\nglass case. The light produced was of a most\n\npowerful character. The cases on which the\n\nmachinery was suspended admitted of being\n\nturned about, and as its position was altered\n\nobjects within several hundred yards' distance\n\nwere rendered us clearly visible as in the light\n\nof day, and persons at a considerable distance\n\nbeyond the Nelson column were enabled to read\n\na newspaper distinctly. The patentee stated\n\nthat the light would be particularly applicable\n\nfor lighthouses, and added that the light then exhibiting\n\n(the expense of which would not exceed a\n\nhut penny an muir), if placed at an, altitude\n\nwith the reflector above it, would perfectly illuminate\n\nan area of ten miles in circumference,\n\nand that it would be\" possible to produce a\n\nlight which should illuminate an area of 100\n\nmiles. The experiments were repeated on Thursday\n\nnight with equal success from the balcony\n\non the summit of the York column, in Waterloo\n\nplace.- it has, December 9.\n\nCompensation for the Loss of a Wife and\n\nMothER. Am o. NuOKr.-This was an action\n\nIn on lit in the Court of Common Pleas, under\n\nthe provisions of 9 and 10 Vict., c. 92, commonly\n\nknown as Lord Campbell's Act, passed for\n\nsecuring compensation to families in cases of\n\ndeath by accident, in which the plaintiff, the\n\nhusband of the late Mary Ann, deceased, sought\n\nto recover damages on his own behalf, and on >\n\nbehalf of four young children, girls of the ages of\n\nthirteen, ten, eight, and 65 years respectively\n\nfor the loss he and they had sustained by\n\nher death, which was alleged to have been occasioned\n\nthrough the negligence of the defendant\n\nin the pulling down of a building adjoining the\n\ndwelling of the plaintiff!'. The plaintiff was a\n\ncarpenter and undertaker, at No. 27, High\n\nstreet, St. Giles's, and the defendant was a retired\n\ntailor, living in Harley-street, Cavendish\n\nsquare, and the owner of some property adjoining\n\nplaintiff's abode in St. Giles's, on which he\n\nwas recently engaged in making alterations and\n\npulling down the houses. A high stack of\n\nchimneys stood a few feet from the shop and\n\nparlour dwelt in by the plaintiffs family, the\n\npatient being on the ground floor and lit by a\n\nskylight in the roof. On the 14th of last April\n\nthe workmen employed by the defendant, himself\n\nbeing there at the time, were engaged in\n\npulling down the chimneys; and instead of\n\nerecting a scaffolding, or removing course by\n\ncourse the bricks of the chimney, they placed\n\ncoils of rope round about it, and several men\n\nhaving hold of the coil in the opposite direction\n\nto that of the plaintiff's abode, proceeded to pull\n\nit down by force. A large portion of it tell,\n\nhowever, in the reverse direction to that in\n\nwhich the men were pulling. At that moment\n\nthe wife of the plaintiff stood over her parlour\n\nfire, preparing dinner, surrounded by three of\n\nher children, when down came the roof, the sky -\n\nlight, and the bricks of the chimney, felling\n\neverything in their way. The poor woman was\n\nknocked down across the fire-place, and received\n\na bruise on the back. The children prov identically\n\nescaped : Mrs. Ants was severely hurt. After a\n\nmonth's illness she began to recover a little, but\n\nshe never walked upright again, and, relapsing,\n\ndied the following December. The jury found\n\nfor the plaintiff, damages £100, and for each of\n\nthe children £50. Atlas, Dec. 9.\n\nDisagreeable but Diverting Blunder.\n\nA short time ago a lady and gentleman were\n\nmarried in the neighbourhood of Nottingham,\n\nand proceeded in their carriage to spend the\n\nhoneymoon by the Cumberland Lakes, the gentleman\n\ngiving strict orders to Murphy, his\n\nIrish footman, on no account to state to in-\n\nquirers that they were newly married. When\n\nleaving the first inn on the road the happy\n\ncouple were much astonished and annoyed to\n\nfind the servants all assembled, and, pointing to\n\nthe gentleman, mysteriously exclaiming, \" That's\n\nhim ! that's the man !\" On reaching the next\n\nstage, the indignant master told Murphy he\n\nmust certainly discharge him, as he had divulged\n\nwhat he had impressed upon him as a secret.\n\n\" And pray yer honour,\" inquired Murphy,\n\n\" what is it yet comp lins ov ?\" That you told\n\nthe servants at the last inn we were a new\n\nmarried couple.\" \" By-, an it's not three,\n\nyer honour,\" replied Murphy ; \" I told the whole\n\nkit that yer honour and yer honour's lady\n\nGod bless her I wouldn't be married yet for a\n\nfortnight !\"- Liverpool Albion, Dec. 25.\n\nA Floating Railroad. Our railways have\n\nbeen laid in cuttings and on embankments,\n\nthrough tunnels and over viaducts, and by the\n\ngenius of a Stephenson they are actually being\n\ncarried over arms of the sea, where ships in full\n\nsail can pass beneath them. While this daring\n\nwork, however, can be effected where the w width,\n\nas at the Menai Straits, is only some 500 feet,\n\nsuch great tidal estuaries as the Forth and Tay\n\nwill not admit of it. As these Friths lie across\n\nthe route of the great east coast line of railways,\n\nwhich will shortly extend from London to\n\nAberdeen, it became extremely desirable that\n\nsome means should be devised by which those\n\nseas might be crossed without the troublesome\n\nnecessity of passengers and goods changing\n\ncarriages. We are happy to say that a plan\n\nhas been devised for earning the trains bodily\n\nacross the Tay at Brough tv Ferry, where it is\n\nabout a mile and a half broad. Mr. Robert\n\nNapier is at present building, in his yard at\n\nGovan, a floating railway for the Edinburgh\n\nand Northern Railway Company. It is being\n\nbuilt of iron, 180 feet in length, and 35 in\n\nbreadth. It is to have three lines of rails on\n\ndeck, so as to enable it to take on a railway\n\ntrain of 500 feet in length, and is to be pro-\n\npelled by engines of 250 horse power. As the\n\nmain line of railway on each side of the Tay is\n\nconsiderably above the level of the sea, stationary\n\nengines on either side of the Frith ore\n\nto be employed to draw up or lower the trains.\n\nThis railroad steam-boat is expected to be\n\nlaunched in a few weeks. In the meantime,\n\nand before the above improvement is completed,\n\nthe Edinburgh and Northern Company have\n\nmade arrangements for having their cattle and\n\nheavy goods for the English markets carried by\n\nthe Dundee and Perth line, and thence through\n\nFife, and by the east coast' lines to England, on\n\nvery moderate terms. Perthshire Courier.\n\nBaiting the, Candidate This is a new game,\n\nvery much played in Yorkshire, and is considered\n\nvery great fun for the bakers, if not for\n\nthe battle. in order to play it, you must first\n\ncatch your candidate-it you can get two at\n\nonce it is still better-and shut him up in a\n\nhustings, open in front, or in a large room with\n\na balcony, or you may let him run loose on a\n\nIihitfurm. You then send in the bakers up a\n\nunions at a time, if you wish to give him\n\nfair play, though, we regret to say, several are\n\noften turned in on him at of as The ballets\n\nare then allowed to throw all sorts of questions\n\nat him, and to poke him up with interrogatories,\n\nwhile he wards them off as well as he can, or\n\ndodges them. He is not allowed any books of\n\nreference, and must encounter the bakers without\n\nany defensive armour of facts and figures ,\n\nAll questions are fair-, and the more they defy\n\na short answer the better. The candidate is\n\nnot prevented from carrying with nonsense or\n\nhumbug, and is expected to keep his temper.\n\nHe may be halted as long as the electors like,\n\nor until his wind is completely gone. When two\n\nare baited at once, addition. 1, fun may be produced\n\nby encouraging them to worry each other.\n\n-Punch."
