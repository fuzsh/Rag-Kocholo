Ibrahim Pasha, the son of Muhammad Ali Pasha, was the ruler of Egypt and Sudan from March 1848 to November 1848. He took over as ruler on behalf of his father and led a military campaign in central Arabia, defeating the first Saudi state. He was then appointed as the leader of the army against the Greek revolution, suppressing their uprising from 1825 to 1828. However, he had to retreat from Greece when French soldiers intervened.

When Muhammad Ali became greedy for the possessions of the Ottoman Empire in Syria, he sent a strong army to conquer Palestine and Syria, crossing the Taurus Mountains to reach "Kutahya" in 1832 and 1833. In 1839, there was renewed fighting between the Egyptians and the Turks, and Muhammad Ali emerged victorious in the decisive battle of Nisib, capturing many weapons from the Ottomans. However, European countries prevented him from expanding further and forced him to retreat from the territories he had conquered.

Ibrahim Pasha was born in Nusratli, Turkey. He was his father's strong arm and his most trusted helper in all his projects. He was brave and fearless in war, a skilled leader who excelled in all aspects of warfare. In 1816, he built the Egyptian Consulate.

In 1848, he was appointed as a deputy ruler of Egypt in place of his father, who was still alive but not fit to rule due to his mental weakness. However, he passed away before his father in November of the same year. There are two dates for his appointment as governor of Egypt.
