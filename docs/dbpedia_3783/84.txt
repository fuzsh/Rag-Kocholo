Victor Sjostrom was one of the most influential forces in Swedish cinema, from his directorial effort (The Gardener) in 1912, to his most memorable role, at the age of 78, as Professor Isak Borg in Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries.

In following the career of Victor Sjostrom, author Bengt Forslund traces the growth of Swedish cinema from its very beginnings. His observations include parallel developments in the U.S. movie industry and how the contrasting--and often contradicting--economic and artistic forces shaped them both. The two are brought together in Sjostrom's triumphant emigration to the United States where, with the support of legendary producer Irving Thalberg, he directed such stars as Lilian Gish, Lon Chaney, and Greta Garbo in some of their greatest films.
