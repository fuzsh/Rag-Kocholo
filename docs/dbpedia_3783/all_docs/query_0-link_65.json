        "text": "Bibi Andersson's second film for Ingmar Bergman was Max von Sydow’s first for the director. In THE SEVENTH SEAL, a knight (von Sydow) and his squire (Gunnar Bjornstrand) are returning home from the Crusades. Exhausted, they decide to spend the night on a desolated beach. On the morning after, the knight encounters Death (Bengt Ekerot), who tells him that his time is up.\n\nThe knight challenges Death to a game of chess. If he wins, Death will have to let him live. If he loses, Death can have his soul. Death quickly agrees and the two begin playing. As they continue their journey back home, the knight and his squire encounter a group of actors. They also befriend \"Jof/Joseph\" (Nils Poppe) and \"Mia/Mary\" (Bibi Andersson), a young couple with a beautiful child, who choose to join them.\n\nBergman began writing the screenplay for THE SEVENTH SEAL while he was in Stockholm's Karolinska Hospital, recovering from a stomach complaint. The script was initially rejected. Bergman would end up rewriting it five times. It was only after the success of SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT at Cannes that it started to be considered more seriously. Erik Nordgren scored the 1957 film.\n\nBibi Andersson co-starred with silent cinema actor/director Victor Sjöström in Ingmar Bergman's 1957 romantic drama WILD STRAWBERRIES. In the film, \"Professor Isak Borg\" (Sjöström) is a 78-year-old widower. He embarks on a car journey from Stockholm to Lund, where he is to receive a honorary degree from his old university.\n\nThe egotistical scientist is accompanied by his daughter-in-law \"Marianne\" (Ingrid Thulin). Although pregnant, she is planning to separate from her husband. En-route she and Isak meet a squabbling married couple and a trio of hitch-hikers. One of them, \"Sara\" (Bibi Andersson), reminds the old man of his long-lost childhood love. Max von Sydow has a featured role as “Henrik Åkerman,” a gas-station owner grateful to Professor Borg for services rendered in the past.\n\nIngmar Bergman came up with the idea for the film while driving from Stockholm to Dalarna, stopping in Uppsala where he had been born and raised, and driving by outside his grandmother's old house, when he suddenly began to think about how it would be if he could open the door and inside it would be just as it had been during his childhood. \"So it struck me - what if you could make a film about this; that you just walk up in a realistic way and open a door, and then you walk into your childhood, and then you open another door and come back to reality, and then you make a turn around a street corner and arrive in some other period of your existence, and everything goes on, lives. That was actually the idea behind WILD STRAWBERRIES.\"\n\nEight minutes of Erik Nordgren's score was re-recorded by Adriano and the Slovak Radio Symphony Orchestra for a 1998 Marco Polo CD, \"The Bergman Suites.\"\n\nIn Ingmar Bergman's BRINK OF LIFE, three women (Eva Dahlbeck, Ingrid Thulin, and Bibi Andersson) reveal their lives and intimate thoughts to each other while in a maternity ward together, where they face the choice of keeping their babies or offering them for adoption. All three actresses, along with Barbro Hiort af Ornäs, who played the hospital nurse, shared the Best Actress Award at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival, where Bergman won the Best Director prize, and the film won the Palme d'Or. Max von Sydow has a supporting role as “Harry Andersson,” the husband of Eva Dahlbeck’s character “Stina Andersson.”\n\nYears later, Bergman said: \"BRINK OF LIFE is a modest and somewhat effeminate ragout, which probably was considered good in its time. Today, it is quite impossible and completely outdated. After all, the compact femininity that I lived with for seven weeks, I decided never again to have women do, whether in art or life.\"\n\nThe film has no musical score, just a few bars from a radio at 10:55 PM in the film. The tune played is Sweden's national anthem indicating the end of the broadcast that day.\n\nProducer Walter Mirisch hired veteran Fred Zinnemann to produce and direct the film in 1960. Zinnemann brought with him screenwriter Daniel Taradash, as they had already successfully partnered in bringing FROM HERE TO ETERNITY (1953) to the screen. But after two years, Taradash was not able to condense the epic book by James A. Michener into a filmable screenplay. When, after two more years' development, Mirisch hired Dalton Trumbo to take over the script, Zinnemann left the project after United Artists rejected his concept of a four-hour movie to be shown in two parts. In the end, much of James Michener's novel was left out of this adaptation. The sequel used additional material from the book.\n\nGeorge Roy Hill took over as director before shooting began and, after being temporarily replaced by Arthur Hiller, finished the picture. Both Trumbo and Taradash ultimately received screenwriting credit. Location scenes were filmed in Norway, New England, Tahiti, and Hawaii. Elmer Bernstein’s re-recorded score was released on a United Artists LP. The LP was re-issued, along with the original soundtrack (in mono), by Varese Sarabande in 2003. HAWAII was the top grossing film of 1966, pulling in nearly $39 million.\n\nMADE IN SWEDEN, not to be confused with “Maid In Sweden,” is a 1969 Swedish drama directed by Johan Bergenstråhle, who also wrote the script based on Sven Fagerberg 's novel The White-Painted Heart (Det Vitmålade Hjärtat). The film is about journalists “Kristina” (Lena Granhagen) and “Jörgen” (Per Myrberg) who travel to Thailand to investigate rumors that a Swedish company is engaged in illegal arms sales there. This story is interspersed with scenes that serve as a political or moral lessons. It also directs criticism at how the West economically exploits developing countries. For example, wealthy Swedish industrialist “Magnus Rud” (Max von Sydow), whom the main characters meet in Thailand, notes that no company directors are Thais.\n\nWriter-director Johan Bergenstråhle began his career as a film critic in 1958, and became fascinated by the French New Wave films of Truffaut and Chabrol. He became popular as a stage director and had a long stretch at Stockholm City Theatre. Beginning in 1965, he began directing films for Swedish television. MADE IN SWEDEN was his first feature film. Producer Bengt Forslund had been producing since 1966, and had three features under his belt at the time of MADE IN SWEDEN. Lena Granhagen was a Swedish actress and singer who began her film career as a decorative blonde in supporting roles. Per Myrberg was also an actor/singer. Myrberg had worked steadily in Swedish television, films, and theater since 1957.\n\nThe 94-minute color film, produced by Svensk Filmindustri, had a lengthy shoot. It was filmed from 2 January 1968 to 3 July 1968 in Stockholm and Faro, Sweden; Bangkok, Thailand; and in India and Pakistan. The film’s score was by Bengt Ernryd, and the film also included several tracked songs, among them The Beatles’ “In My Life” sung by Judy Collins, and “Billy the Kid” sung by Burl Ives. MADE IN SWEDEN opened in Sweden on 17 March 1969. The film was shown in competition at the 1969 Berlin International Film Festival, which was held from June 25 to July 6, 1969. There it won a Silver Bear award and was reviewed by Variety’s ”Hawk” in a review published on 9 July 1969. Over the next year it played in much of Europe, but it never had a U.S. theatrical release.\n\nFollowing MADE IN SWEDEN, Johan Bergenstråhle would continue directing Swedish television and features through most of the 1970s, but only sporadically after that. In all, he directed 14 films between 1965 and 1994. He died in 1995 at the age of 60. Bengt Forslund would go on to produce and co-write two of director Jan Troell’s most famous films--THE EMIGRANTS and THE NEW LAND. Forslund would receive two Oscar nominations for THE EMIGRANTS. Lena Franhagen did not act again in films for 8 years, instead concentrating on theater and recordings. Per Myrberg continued film acting, and supplied voiceovers for the Swedish versions of Disney’s THE ARISTOCATS (1970) and THE LITTLE MERMAID (1989), in which he voiced “Sebastian” the crab. A more recent appearance was in THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO.\n\nAlthough an English-language version was created for MADE IN SWEDEN, no English-language or English-subtitled video has been released in the U.S.\n\nAn American intelligence officer signs an agreement with the Soviet Union stating that both countries will attack China, and the U.S. government hastily assembles a group of espionage agents to recover the unauthorized treaty, called THE KREMLIN LETTER. The team, under the leadership of \"The Highwayman\" (Dean Jagger) consists of \"Rone\" (Patrick O'Neal), a retired U.S. Navy officer;\" B.A.\" (Barbara Parkins), a safe-cracker's daughter who replaces her ailing father on the mission; \"Janis\" (Nigel Green), a small-time pimp from a Mexican brothel; \"The Warlock\" (George Sanders) a transvestite found in a San Francisco gay bar; and \"Ward\" (Richard Boone), the Highwayman's top assistant. In New York, the Americans have a lesbian seduce the daughter of U.S.-based Russian spy \"Potkin\" (Ronald Radd) in order to blackmail him into turning over his Moscow apartment as a base for their operations. In Moscow, they bug the residence of Secret Police Chief \"Kosnov\" (Max von Sydow), who is married to \"Erika\" (Bibi Andersson), the widow of an enemy spy.\n\nProducer Carter De Haven, III re-teamed with director John Huston on THE KREMLIN LETTER, after their recent collaboration on A WALK WITH LOVE AND DEATH (1969). De Haven was quoted as saying that the $6-$7 million project would not be filmed in Romania as initially planned because Romanian officials feared “Soviet displeasure” about the film’s content. Instead, Huston and De Haven planned to visit the U.S.S.R. for research only. It was later rumored that they had smuggled footage of the Bolshoi Ballet out of the country, to be used in the film.\n\nPrincipal photography began on 17 February 1969 in Helsinki, Finland, which doubled as Moscow. The reproduction of Moscow Square, including a full-size Vladimir Lenin statue, angered the U.S.S.R., which responded by putting diplomatic pressure on the Finns and denying visas to people associated with the film. The following month, production moved to Rome, where some shooting took place at Dino De Laurentiis Studios. From Rome, cast and crew moved to New York City. Additional shooting was completed in Mexico City.\n\nThe film utilizes an innovative technique: scenes spoken in Russian begin in Russian and after a couple of interchanges segue into being spoken in English by the same actors, avoiding either usual extreme of subtitling or dubbing into English.\n\nAlthough De Haven referred to THE KREMLIN LETTER as a “borderline X” film due to its nudity, drugs, and perversion, it ultimately received an [M] rating (for mature audiences) from the Motion Picture Association of America. Theatrical release took place in New York City on 1 February 1970. The picture went on to become a critical and commercial failure. It was referred to as a “bomb” in the 5 April 1970 Los Angels Times, and the 13 January 1971 Variety called it a “wrecker” for Fox, whose negative expenditure was said to have approached $6 million, while the movie’s domestic box-office gross was still shy of $1 million.\n\nIn his autobiography, John Huston said of the film: \"I thought THE KREMLIN LETTER had all the makings of a success... The book by Noel Behn had been a best-seller. It had, moreover, all those qualities that were just coming into fashion in 1970 - violence, lurid sex, drugs. The cast was exceptionally strong... and the performances couldn't have been bettered. It was extremely well photographed [by Edward Scaife] - there was a virtuosity, a shine to it. Gladys Hill and I wrote the script, which I considered quite good, though in retrospect it was perhaps overcomplicated.\"\n\nRobert Drasnin's score was released by Intrada in 2011.\n\nTHE TOUCH concerns “Karin” (Andersson), a seemingly happy Swedish housewife and mother who begins an adulterous affair with “David” (Gould) a foreign archaeologist after Karin’s husband “Andreas” (von Sydow), a physician, invites David to dinner after having become friendly with him while treating him as a patient. THE TOUCH was von Sydow’s last film with Ingmar Bergman.\n\nProduction on the film began on 15 September 1970 and continued through mid-December 1970. Location scenes were shot on the Swedish island of Gotland, in Stockholm, and in London. Interiors were filmed at Film-Teknik, in the Stockholm suburb of Solna. The movie was shot in two versions - one where English was spoken by those who were English-speaking and Swedish by those who were Swedes, and one where only English was spoken. The full English version was the one released in the U.S. Gould was dubbed into Swedish for the film's release outside of the U.S. The two-language version has been infrequently seen.\n\nThe picture was a co-production of ABC Pictures (New York) and Cinematograph A.B. (Stockholm). The Swedish title of the film was “Beroringen.” It premiered at the Berlin Film Festival on 26 June 1971. THE TOUCH was released in the U.S. by Cinerama Releasing Corp., opening in New York on 14 July 1971. The film’s Swedish premiere was on 30 August 1971.\n\nThe opening title card for 1973's THE EXORCIST reads \"William Peter Blatty's The Exorcist.\" Blatty is also credited on a later title card, which reads: \"Written for the screen and produced by William Peter Blatty based on his novel.\"\n\nAlthough \"The Exorcist\" was a book of fiction, author Blatty based his international best seller on an actual exorcism of a fourteen-year-old boy that took place in Silver Spring, MD in 1949. According to various sources, Blatty learned of the exorcism while attending nearby Georgetown University, where the film adaptation would later be shot. The character of “Father Merrin” (played by Max von Sydow) was loosely based on Roman Catholic priest Teilhard de Chardin, a theologian who possibly performed an exorcism in Africa.\n\nStanley Kubrick wanted to direct the film, but only if he could produce it himself. As the studio was worried that he would go over budget and over schedule, it eventually settled on Mark Rydell, but Blatty insisted on William Friedkin instead. After a standoff with the studio, which initially refused to budge over Rydell, Blatty urged Warner Bros. executives to watch the just released THE FRENCH CONNECTION. This helped seal the deal, and Blatty eventually got his way.\n\nStacy Keach had originally been hired by Blatty to play the role of \"Father Karras\" until Friedkin spotted Jason Miller in a Broadway play. Despite Miller never having acted in a movie before, Keach's contract was bought out by Warner Bros. and Miller was cast in the role. The Prospect Avenue apartment where the story takes place was once inhabited by Blatty, while he was a student at Georgetown University.\n\nMax von Sydow was always William Friedkin's first choice to play Father Merrin. When von Sydow was given the book by William Peter Blatty to read. with a note that they wanted him to play a priest, he assumed he was up for the role of Father Karras. He was surprised to finally learn that they wanted him as the Exorcist, stating in a 2013 interview: \"I still don't really know why\".\n\nAlthough playing an elderly priest, von Sydow was only 44 years old. In order to make him appear much older, make-up maestro Dick Smith applied generous amounts of stipple to von Sydow's forehead, eyes and neck. His facial skin was then manually stretched as liquid latex was applied. When the latex dried, his taut skin was then released causing the film of rubber to corrugate. This daily make-up procedure lasted three hours and was apparently the cause of much anguish for von Sydow.\n\nThe two priests - Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) and Father Karras (Jason Miller) - do not meet until 1 hour and 41 minutes into the film (in the director's cut). Father Merrin's arrival was filmed on Max von Sydow's first day of work. On the first day of filming the exorcism sequence, Linda Blair's delivery of her foul-mouthed dialogue so disturbed the gentlemanly von Sydow that he actually forgot his lines. Despite playing the title role, von Sydow had less screen time than the rest of the main cast.\n\nThe production encountered a number of problems. Both Ellen Burstyn and Max von Sydow were out for weeks, Jason Miller's young son was critically injured during filming, and shooting in Iraq was so hot that some crew members grew ill and had to be replaced. In his interview at the 2006 AMPAS screening, Friedkin said that the two-story house set burned to the ground, causing a three-week delay as well.\n\nAccording to Blatty, Warner Bros. wanted to change the title of the film after taking a survey, which found none of the participants knew what an exorcist was. A studio executive advised Friedkin to make several cuts to the movie prior to the release, citing that the scenes were unnecessary. Friedkin complied, which offended Blatty, who thought these scenes formed the heart of the movie. Blatty even refused to speak to Friedkin for some time, but they eventually made amends. Many years later, when the immense popularity of the movie warranted a re-release, Friedkin agreed to re-evaluate some of the deleted scenes and put several of them back as a favor to Blatty, creating an extended \"Version You've Never Seen\". By his own admission, Friedkin tends to see this extended version as his favorite.\n\nAlthough composer Lalo Schifrin was originally chosen to score the picture, Friedkin rejected his early efforts in favor of existing compositions. Mike Oldfield’s “Tubular Bells,” from his debut album by the same title, became an international hit after the film’s release and has become synonymous with the film’s haunting mood. Warner Bros. Records released an LP of \"Musical Excerpts\" from the film, which they later reissued on CD. A CD that was included with some video releases of the film included a suite from Schifrin's unused score.\n\nTHE EXORCIST was the biggest box office hit of 1973, grossing nearly $196 million.\n\nGerman Nobel-prize winner Hermann Hesse died in 1962, but his 1927 novel, Steppenwolf, became a cult classic during the anti-establishment youth movement of the late-1960s and sold over 1.5 million copies in the U.S. alone. Producer Melvin Fishman picked up on the commercial potential of the novel and pursued the rights to STEPPENWOLF after his work as associate producer on director Satyajit Ray’s THE ALIEN ended abruptly in 1967 when the project was cancelled. Despite warnings that Hesse’s publisher and estate were notoriously reluctant to negotiate a deal, Fishman spent months working to gain their approval. In May 1969, Fishman, who partnered with producer Richard Herland to form a new company for the film, United Screen Arts, paid a $5,000 advance for a $165,000 option of the novel. It took Fishman five years to raise enough funds to complete payment of the option, and Herland eventually invested $300,000 of his personal wealth into the film in exchange for fifty percent of its profits.\n\nWhile Fishman was unable to interest major studios in the project, he secured the promise of $35,000 from “an unidentified miniconglomerate” to hire writer-director Fred Haines, who had received an Academy Award nomination for co-scripting an adaptation of ULYSSES for Joseph Strick’s 1967 production. STEPPENWOLF marked Haines’s directorial debut of a feature film. Although the unnamed backer ultimately failed to procure funding, the film rights were finally sold to Fishman and Herland for $175,000 after Hesse’s publishing house, Suhrkamp Verlag, approved Haines’s screenplay. The company also negotiated for a collaborative role “in the shaping of the picture artistically.” Fishman then convinced entrepreneur Peter J. Sprague, who is credited as the film’s presenter and executive producer, to finance the picture for $2 million.\n\nThe film is set in the bourgeois circles of Europe after the Great War. All his life, “Harry Haller” (Max von Sydow), a solitary intellectual, has feared his dual nature of being human and being a beast. He's decided to die on his 50th birthday, which is soon. He's rescued from his solipsism by the mysterious “Hermine” (Dominique Sanda), who takes him dancing, introduces him to jazz and to the beautiful and whimsical “Maria” (Carla Romanelli), and guides him into the hallucinations of the Magic Theater, which seem to take him into Hell.\n\nFilming took place in Basel, the location of the novel, but the surrealistic “Magic Theater” sequence, which included an innovative combination of video effects and animation, was created at Hamburg Studio in Germany. Hamburg Studio had agreed to trade goods and services for a stake in the film’s profits. The film’s effects marked “one of the most advanced examples of transferring television images to film” to the time. The film was shot in six languages and Variety complained of its “erratic dubbing.”\n\nSprague distributed the picture under the banner of his mid-century home furnishings chain store, Design Research. However, the company is not credited as a distributor in the film. Using a “four-wall arrangement” with exhibitors, which required distributors to pay theaters a rental fee, Sprague opened the film on ten screens in the Bay Area of Northern California in November 1974 after a 17 October 1974 premiere at the San Francisco Film Festival. Despite its generally negative reviews, STEPPENWOLF fared well among Hesse enthusiasts and intellectuals, and the Los Angeles Times reported that it grossed $10,000 weekly at a local theater.\n\nA young Samoan chief, “Matangi” (Dayton Ka'ne), and an American painter, “Charlotte Bruckner” (Mia Farrow), embark upon a desperate love affair, against the will of her father, “Captain Bruckner” (Jason Robards). Amid this man-made tension comes a HURRICANE so devastating, the lives of the lovers and the entire island are imperiled. Max von Sydow is “Dr. Danielson”, a physician, who has been restoring an 1887 house on the island of Samoa.\n\nThis film was screenwriter Lorenzo Semple's second film for producer Dino De Laurentiis. The screenplay was based upon the 1936 novel by James Norman Hall and Charles Nordhoff (\"Mutiny On the Bounty\"). Semple was also an Executive Producer on the film.\n\nThe 1979 film had a troubled production. Roman Polanski was set to direct the film until he was charged with statutory rape. After he fled the country, director John Huston was approached about the job, but due to health concerns and the remote location, he turned down the project. Peter Bogdanovich stated that he declined a one million dollar offer to direct. Swedish director Jan Troell was ultimately hired. Semple felt that Troell, the director of THE EMIGRANTS (1971) and THE NEW LAND (1972) with von Sydow, was wrong for the film.\n\nThe entire picture was shot on Bora Bora, which was an island of approximately 2000 inhabitants at the time. De Laurentiis undertook extensive preparations to convert the remote location, with no electricity, into a filming site and a temporary home for cast and crew. To import equipment, props and provisions, the producer bought a freighter that ferried across the Pacific between Los Angeles and French Polynesia. Two hotels existed on Bora Bora, but they were deemed too costly or impractical for housing and feeding the 150-member film company. Therefore, De Laurentiis built a hotel with sixty-six bungalows named the “Marara,” investing approximately $4.2 million. After filming completed, the accommodations were transformed into a tourist resort.\n\nPreliminary crew arrived on the island in October 1977 to construct sets, with a budget calculated at over $7.5 million. A $1.5 million, 160-foot tank was also built on site to create the hurricane special effects. A real hurricane hit the island in February 1978 destroying bungalows at the hotel and several sets while leaving the special effects preparations months behind schedule. De Laurentiis arranged for the French Navy to assist with last minute construction, and principal photography was able to begin 15 May 1978.\n\nNino Rota’s score was released on an Elektra LP. It was re-issued on CD by Legend in 1995 and Varese Sarabande in 2018.\n\nIn a dystopian future, JUDGE DREDD, a police officer with instant field judiciary powers, assists “Judge Hershey” (Diane Lane) in ending a chaotic block war. He apprehends computer hacker “Herman Ferguson” (Rob Schneider) and sentences him to five years imprisonment for tampering with a food dispensing robot. A psychopathic murderer and former judge named “Rico” (Armand Assante) escapes from prison and seeks vengeance on Dredd since he's the one who brought down the former judge and put him in prison. Rico frames his old friend for the brutal murder of a news reporter (Mitchell Ryan) who always criticized Dredd's extreme methods of law enforcement. Dredd is found guilty of the crime based on DNA evidence (the bullets in every Judge's \"Lawgiver\" gun are encoded with their DNA) and gets sentenced to life in prison. His mentor, “Chief Judge Fargo” (Max von Sydow), prevents Dredd from being executed by retiring and making that his last request (all Chief Judges get a final request before retiring). Now Dredd must act to clear his name.\n\nIn RING OF THE NIBELUNGS, “Siegfried” (Benno Fürmann), the orphaned son of a king, is raised by a blacksmith, “Eyvind” (Max von Sydow), and taught to make great swords. He meets and defeats “Brunhild,” the queen of Iceland (Kristanna Løken), who proclaims her love for him. While she waits for him, he journeys to Burgund, where he slays a dragon, takes its cursed gold, befriends “King Gunther” (Samuel West), and swallows a magic potion that causes him to fall in love with “Princess Kriemhild” (Alicia Witt). With Gunther seeking Brunhild for his wife, and the king’s half-dwarf advisor, “Hagen” (Julian Sands), secretly obsessed with the gold, tragedy seems inevitable.\n\nUli Edel directed this 2004 three-hour made-for-television European co-production. Ilan Eshkeri provided the unreleased score. In some countries, the film played in its original length on television, in others it played theatrically (sometimes broken into two parts), in Britain it played in an edited 132-minute cut, and in the U.S. that shortened version went straight to DVD.\n\nThe film also went under different titles. It was THE SWORD OF XANTEN in Britain, THE CURSE OF THE RING in South Africa, and DARK KINGDOM: THE DRAGON KING on the U.S. DVD.\n\nIn a career that spanned seven decades, Max von Sydow become one of Sweden's most admired and professional actors and is the only male Swedish actor to receive an Oscar nomination. Von Sydow was nominated twice: for Best Actor in PELLE THE CONQUEROR (1987) and for Best Supporting Actor in EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE (2011).\n\nSydow received two Emmy nominations: Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Special for RED KING, WHITE KNIGHT (1989) and Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for “Game of Thrones” (2016).\n\nHis two Golden Globe nominations were for Best Actor - Drama in HAWAII (1966) and Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture in THE EXORCIST.\n\nThe Los Angeles Film Critics Association gave Max von Sydow its Career Achievement Award in 2018, and the Stockholm Film Festival gave him its Lifetime Achievement Award in 2019.\n\nSydow once said: “Many persons believe that an actor must identify himself with his role. I do not do that, although I do become involved with my parts while I play them. But I find it a virtue to do things which are not of myself. This is the Swedish concept of an actor.”\n\n“Acting is such a weird profession. It's such a futile thing. Even when it's there on film, there's nothing really to it. It is not like making a piece of furniture or writing a book.”\n\nIntangible though they may be, Max von Sydow’s performances have kept audiences in their seats for generations, and will continue to do so long into the future."
