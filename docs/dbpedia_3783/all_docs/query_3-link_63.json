        "text": "General Suggestions\n\n1. If you need basic facts about a person, e.g., \"When was Napoleon born?\", check general encyclopedias, such as the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and Canadian Encyclopedia.\n\n2. If you are unable to find simple biographical information in general encyclopedias, or you need more information than provided, check one of the specialized biographical reference books listed on this page.\n\n3. For highly detailed information, search OMNI on the library's homepage for books on the person. Here are some suggested searches:\n\nBiography AND canada\n\nAlbert Einstein AND biography\n\nEconomists AND biography\n\nArtists AND biography\n\nWomen AND biography\n\n4. It is important to remember that biographical information may not be available for all individuals. In these cases, information about an author can sometimes be found by checking the preface or introduction of an author's work for scholarly background and academic achievements. Perform an author search in OMNI by typing in the last name followed by the first name.\n\nDatabases | General and International Biography | Canadian Biography | Historical | Women | Arts and Humanities | Social Sciences | Science and Engineering | Obituaries | Autobiography, Nicknames, Eponyms, Pseudonyms | eBooks | Quotations | Websites\n\nDatabases\n\nCPI.Q (Canadian)\n\nCanadian Business and Current Affairs (Canadian)\n\nGale Literature\n\nGale Virtual Reference Library\n\nOxford Dictionary of National Biography - for British subjects\n\nNexis Uni - Includes the Who's Who books.\n\nSpecialized Biographical Reference Books\n\nGeneral and International Biography\n\nDictionary of World Biography (2020)\n\nReturn to top\n\nCanadian Biography\n\nDictionary of Canadian Biography\n\nCanadian Who's Who Online\n\nReturn to top\n\nHistorical Biography\n\nThe Ancient World: Dictionary of World Biography, Vol 1\n\nBiography and the Black Atlantic\n\nDictionary of Contemporary World History From 1900 to the Present Day\n\nWho's Who in the Classical World\n\nRise of the Medieval World, 500-1300: A Biographical Dictionary\n\nRenaissance and Reformation, 1500-1620: A Biographical Dictionary\n\nThe Routledge encyclopedia of Civil War era biographies\n\nWho's who in contemporary gay and lesbian history from World War II to the present day\n\nReturn to top\n\nWomen\n\nConcise Dictionary of Women Artists\n\nA Historical Dictionary of British Women\n\nNative American Women a Biographical Dictionary\n\nPalgrave Macmillan Dictionary of Women's Biography\n\nWomen, a Modern Political Dictionary\n\nReturn to top\n\nArts and Humanities\n\nDictionary of Literary Biography Complete Online\n\nOxford Art Online\n\nLiterary Biography: An Introduction\n\nWriting lives : biography and textuality, identity and representation in early modern England\n\nOxford Music Online\n\nThe Concise Encyclopedia of Western Philosophy and Philosophers\n\nReturn to top\n\nSocial Sciences\n\nEconomic Thinkers: A Biographical Encyclopedia\n\nFifty Key Thinkers in Psychology\n\nGovernment Leaders, Military Rulers, and Political Activists\n\nInternational Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\nOxford Dictionary of Political Biography Who's Who in Twentieth-Century World Politics\n\nHutchinson Encyclopedia of Modern Political Biography\n\nReturn to top\n\nScience and Engineering\n\nHutchinson Dictionary of Scientific Biography\n\nScientists, mathematicians, and inventors lives and legacies : an encyclopedia of people who changed the world\n\nInternational Biographies\n\nAustralian Dictionary of Biography\n\nDictionary of African Biography\n\nReturn to top\n\nObituaries\n\nCanadian Newsstream\n\nNote: When a famous person dies, newspapers treat the event as a news story and you can find these by searching in our full-text newspaper databases.
