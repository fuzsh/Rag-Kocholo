        "text": "Jan Troell’s The Emigrants (Utvandrarna), the first half of a six-and-a-half-hour cinematic diptych that chronicles the epic hardships endured and joys attained by a group of 19th-century Swedish pilgrims who journey to the promises of North America, is an impressive achievement and testament to Troell’s immense ambitions as a filmmaker. Together with The New Land (Nybyggarna, 1972), which was shot and edited simultaneously, The Emigrants marked Troell’s third directorial effort, following his much celebrated debut Here is Your Life (Här har du ditt liv, 1966) and Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe (Ole dole doff, 1968), which won the top prize at the Berlin Film Festival. Like Here is Your Life, The Emigrants and The New Land are based on a monumental work of Swedish literature, in this case novelist and historian Vilhelm Moberg’s four-novel series published between 1949 and 1959.\n\nThe sheer scope of the project—with its attendant historical detail, large cast of characters, and traversal of world geography—suggests that Troell was not content to work in the shadow of his country’s reigning cinematic master, Ingmar Bergman. He did tap two of Bergman’s favorite actors, Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann, to star as Karl Oskar and Kristina Nilsson, a married couple in rural Småland whose dreams of upward mobility—specifically owning their own land—is limited by Sweden’s staunch traditions and rigid class boundaries. For Karl Oskar, whose young family is constantly growing, the difficulty of surviving as a farmer is compounded by the rocky land he must work, which breaks both plows and the men who came before him (he takes over the management of the farm when the work very nearly kills his father).\n\nEffectively mired forever in a life of working for someone else and barely making ends meet, Karl Oskar is drawn to North America as a means of starting over under his own terms, a dream that is followed by several others who live near them. These include Karl Oskar’s idealistic younger brother Robert (Eddie Axberg) and his best friend Arvid (Pierre Lindstedt), who is as simple as Robert is fueled by dreams of the plentitude across the ocean; Danjel (Allan Edwall), Kristina’s brother who leads a Christian sect that is at odds with the powerful Lutheran church, and his wife (Ulla Smidje); and Ulrika (Monica Zetterlund), a reformed prostitute who has joined Danjel’s sect. Thus, the emigration to North American is driven by different desires: the dreams of freedom and wealth for Robert and Arvid, the hope of self-sufficiency and control over their own destiny for Karl Oskar and Kristina, and religious freedom for Danjel and his followers.\n\nThe Emigrants is roughly divided into three parts, each of which flows into the next, creating a sense of narrative rhythm that keeps the film moving steadily forward. The first hour or so of the film—which is, not incidentally, the most trying portion—is devoted primarily to introducing and developing the main characters while also depicting in closely observed, naturalistic detail the difficulties of life in rural Sweden in the mid-1800s. The majority of the narrative is focused on Karl Oskar and Kristina, who balance each other well (while he is temperamental and at times dangerously self-determined, she is devout in the best sense of the word and incredibly patient). The blood and sweat that are shed on the farm are out of balance with the relatively meager reward of barely surviving, especially during the harsh winters that make the rocky, unforgiving landscape seem even more merciless.\n\nThe second part of the film details the months-long voyage across the ocean, which entails its own hardships involving acute seasickness, a plague of lice, and the general boredom inherent in being in a confined space in the middle of the ocean for so long. There are flare-ups among the travelers, whose close quarters are bound to cause friction at some point (the most memorable moment of interpersonal hostility comes from the most unlikely of characters when the otherwise even-keeled Kristina lights into Ulrika, blaming her for the lice infestation, a rare moment in which she completely loses her patience and her temper).\n\nThe voyage is harrowing, and it even proves lethal for some poor souls who are not hearty enough to survive it. However, once they arrive in North America, the promise of the new land they will call home provides the light at the end of the tunnel, although they still must make the arduous journey across much of the country to their final home in the Minnesota territory, where fertile land is plentiful and cheap. The sequence in which Karl Oskar trudges through forests and marshlands until he alights upon the perfect spot to establish his new home is a thoroughly satisfying moment in which all the difficulties he and the others have endured seems to have paid off. Sitting beneath a tree into which he has carved his name, his moment of rest is profoundly earned.\n\nTroell, who cowrote the script with producer Bengt Forslund and acted as his own cinematographer and editor, establishes the tone and rhythm of The Emigrants early on and maintains it with remarkable consistency. He clearly wants us to become fully engrossed not just in the drama of the characters, but the worlds they inhabit, which is why he pays such close attention to seemingly unimportant details and holds shots for long periods of time (for some viewers, this will be maddening, while for others it will be hypnotic). Not surprisingly, when Warner Bros. distributed The Emigrants theatrically in the U.S. in 1972, they demanded that nearly an hour be cut out of it (even in this truncated form it was still nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar that year and then for four more Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director, the following year).\n\nThe roughness of wood, the cold damp of the snow, the weight of rocks, the pains of pregnancy, the jangly imbalance of hand-crafted plows and carts—all are essential physical and sensory components of the film’s dramatic effectiveness, and Troell weaves them quiet masterfully into the fabric of his characters’ lives (writing in the journal Film & History back in 1972, historian Michael Ebner called it “a standard for future historically-minded motion pictures”). Troell’s cinematography is constantly striking, and he conveys the hardships and the hopes of life with his color palette, painting the Swedish countryside in drab, faded tones that are sharply contrasted with the verdant greens and intense blue skies of North America. This is no simplistic tale of freedom and wealth won by moving from one land to another, and the note of hope on which The Emigrants ends is but a set-up for the trials and tribulations awaiting the characters in The New Land, further proof that Troell was not making two separate films, but rather, in the spirit of Moberg’s novels, a singular epic work.\n\nThe Emigrants / The New Land Criterion Collection Director-Approved Blu-ray 2-Disc Set Aspect Ratio1.66:1AudioSwedish Linear PCM monauralSubtitles EnglishSupplements\n\nIntroduction by theater and film critic John Simon\n\nTo Paint With Pictures (2005) making-of documentary\n\nVideo conversation between film scholar Peter Cowie and director Jan Troell\n\nVideo interview with actress Liv Ullmann\n\nTrailers\n\nEssay by critic Terrence Rafferty\n\nDistributorThe Criterion CollectionSRP$39.95Release DateFebruary 9, 2016VIDEO & AUDIOBoth films look absolutely stunning in their new high-definition transfers. This is the first time The Emigrants and The New Land have been made available on home video in the U.S. in their original uncut, Swedish-language versions since their laserdisc releases by Image Entertainment in the 1990s (1994 Warner Home Video VHS releases had the shortened 151-minute and 161-minute versions, respectively, both of which were dubbed into English). Each film is housed on its own Blu-ray disc, thus maximizing bitrate for each. The films were transferred and restored from the original 35mm camera negatives by AB Svensk Filmindustri, which did an amazing job maintaining the films’ celluloid feel. There is a good presence of natural grain in both transfers, and the detail throughout is wonderful in conveying the rough textures of the clothes, the brittle surface of ice, and the roughness of working hands. The films’ widely varying color palettes are beautifully rendered, from the slightly desaturated look of the Swedish countryside at the beginning of The Emigrants, to the intense, lush greens of the Minnesota wilds, to the electric blue sky over the western deserts in The New Land. There are no signs of dirt or damage or wear. The original monaural soundtracks were transferred at 24-bit from the 17.5mm print masters and digitally restored, which has left them clean and very pleasant. Troell doesn’t use a lot of music, but when he does, it’s for good reason, and the Linear PCM lossless soundtrack is quite good in reproducing the film’s numerous musical styles, which vary from full orchestral music, to asynchronous jazz drumming, to Native American singing. Dialogue and sound effects all sound clear and are free of aural artifacts and ambient hiss.SUPPLEMENTSThe supplements are spread evenly across the two discs. On The Emigrants Blu-ray there is a short introduction by theater and film critic John Simon, who was an major champion of the films when they were originally released in the U.S.; a trailer; and To Paint With Pictures, an excellent 57-minute documentary produced by Svensk Filmindusti in 2005 about the making of the films. It features some behind-the-scenes footage and photos shot during the production, as well as interviews with director Jan Troell, actors Liv Ullmann, Pierre Lindstedt, Hans Alfredson, and Eddie Axberg, producer/co-screenwriter Bengt Forslund, script supervisor Katinka Faragó, and composer Georg Oddner, among others. On The New Land Blu-ray we have a trailer and two newly recorded interviews: one with Troell conducted by film scholar and Criterion mainstay Peter Cowie (35 min.) and one with Ullmann (24 min.).\n\nCopyright ©2016 James Kendrick\n\nThoughts?
