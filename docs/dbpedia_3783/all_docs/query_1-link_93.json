        "text": "Shooting began on 9 July 1962, and took place entirely at the Råsunda Film Studios.\n\nThe film, as Bergman explained it to Sven Nykvist, was certainly meant to be dream-like, but there were to be no hackneyed dream effects such as soft focus images or fades. The challenge lay in the fact that the film itself must have the character of a dream. The director and cinematographer decided to use Eastman Double-X negative, developed to a higher gamma than usual. Coming after the ascetic imagery of Through a Glass Darkly and Winter Light, they decided to be far less restrained. Bergman describes it as 'a cinematic sensuality that I still experience with delight. To put it simply: we had an enormous amount of fun making The Silence.'\n\nNykvist also recall the shooting as being 'child's play' compared to the rigours of Winter Light. Yet it gave rise to the only real quarrel that Bergman and Nykvist ever had. Nykvist's mother was dying, and shooting the scene in the train compartment he received a telephone call from the hospital telling him that the end was near:\n\nNaturally I was upset, and I went up and interrupted Ingmar as he was rehearsing the actors, something that nobody was allowed to do. Ingmar was furious. I explained the situation.\n\n'Don't you dare leave now  right in the middle of a shoot! If you go now, you bastard, you can stay at home for good,' shouted Ingmar.\n\n'If you call me a bastard when my mother's dying, then I really won't come back,' I said as I left.\n\nYet during the afternoon Nykvist did come back, and Bergman apologised. But he added: 'Listen, Sven, the most important thing is still what's left. What's up there on the screen. There's nothing else for you.'\n\nAs it turned out, The Silence is one of Bergman and Nykvist's most outstanding cinematographic achievements: not, perhaps, as striking as the Oscar-winning camera work of Cries and Whispers and Fanny and Alexander, yet scenes such as those in the train compartment, or those between Anna and Ester by the hotel window must have been very difficult to shoot, despite what their creators might claim.\n\nThe leading roles were played by Ingrid Thulin and Gunnel Lindblom, the latter in her greatest ever performance for Bergman. She had been a key player in his band of actors since Don Juan at the Malmö City Theatre in 1955, and had played minor parts in The Seventh Seal, The Virgin Spring and Winter Light. This, however, was her first lead.\n\nThulin was one of Bergman's most regular actresses, with major roles in most of his films since Wild Strawberries. One interesting aside is that the characters she played became less and less attractive: from the elegant Marianne in Wild Strawberries, she played a hermaphrodite in The Magician, the snivelling and wretched school teacher in Winter Light, and now a bitter, compulsively masturbating invalid. Later, she would play other unpleasant roles, such as the corpse in Hour of the Wolf, the self-harming Anna in Cries and Whispers or the fading actress in After the Rehearsal. Bergman has occasionally expressed a certain jealousy over the fact that the beautiful Thulin was married to Harry Schein, but it is hard to determine whether or not this had any bearing on the matter.\n\nBergman was, in any case, delighted with their efforts: 'Furthermore, the actresses were talented, well-disciplined, and almost always in a good mood. That The Silence in some ways became their undoing is another story. The film made them all internationally known. And other countries chose, as usual, to misunderstand the uniqueness of their respective talents.'\n\nAnna's son Johan was played by Jörgen Lindström. He would also take part in Bergman's next film Persona, and in Mai Zetterling's Night Games. Some twenty years after the première of The Silence he was interviewed in the newspaper Aftonbladet to coincide with a TV broadcast of the film. Thirty-three years old at the time, he was working in a film laboratory in Stockholm. He said that he could not recall much about the shooting, other than that Bergman was 'quite avuncular' and that Gunnel Lindblom 'had such an amazing car – a black Cadillac. It was the car that made her exciting.'\n\nThe old room service waiter was played by the veteran Håkan Jahnberg, formerly the leading actor at the Gothenburg City Theatre. He had a problem remembering his lines in Bergman's made-up language, and struck a deal with the director that he could revive his childhood ability to speak backwards. Attentive Swedish-speaking listeners might notice that some of Jahnberg's lines are well-known Swedish nursery rhymes recited backwards!"
