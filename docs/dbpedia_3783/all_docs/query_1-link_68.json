Spending part of it on getting a photo with Judge Dredd, (on a stage with robots/ large props from the 1995 film,that actually looked really cool) I looked round the various other traders tables, and for the first time saw a book that I had to buy right on the spot. Years before before YouTube, tor, ease to find Region 1 DVDs to import, the extensive detailed reviews/episode guides opened my eyes to a world of Disney which I had not known existed.\n\nMurderous Passions: and Flowers of Perversion: The Delirious Cinema of Jesus Franco by Stephen Thrower and Julian Grainger.\n\nWeighing 4.1 pounds and 5.5 pounds each and taking a decade to write, Thrower and Grainger present a heavyweight tribute to \"Uncle\" Jess Franco. Covering over 200 movies, the passion that the writers have for JF comes across even when searching for highlights in his low points, with the writers also going into detail on his lost and never produced works.\n\nSin in Soft Focus: Pre-Code Hollywood by Mark A. Vieira.\n\nFilled with alluring stills, Vieira offers a breathless tour to the mad-cap antics that went on behind and in front of the camera in this sadly short-lived era of Hollywood.\n\nNightmare Movies by Kim Newman.\n\nExtensively updating his original book, Newman digs into themes and the continued evolving of Horror sub-genres from the late 1950's-to now, with new, detailed analysis on Horror auteurs from De Palma and Argento to GDT and Tim Burton.\n\nPost by Prime etc. on\n\nA Pictorial History of Horror Movies by Denis Gifford was one of the first books I got and I still have it.\n\nAlso Classics of the Horror Film and More Classics of the Horror Film.\n\nThe Master of the Majicks books on Ray Harryhausen I got a while ago (although they updated it after he died).\n\nVampire Cinema by David Pirie\n\nBeating the Devil: The Making of Night of the Demon (glad I got it when I did since it goes for a lot now)\n\nI wanted to ask someone who has the \"Insert Studio\" Story books which do they like best?\n\nI have:\n\nThe Warner Bros. Story\n\nThe RKO Story\n\nThe Hammer Story (I assume it is the same series but its pretty thin compared to the others).\n\nPost by mikef6 on\n\nI dipped into my copy of \"Sin In Soft Focus\" earlier this week.\n\nSome Great Biographies That Give A Lot Of Background About Film Production. I refer often to these titles\n\nRobert Mitchum: “Baby, I Don’t Care” by Lee Server\n\nStan And Ollie: The Roots Of Comedy: The Double Life Of Laurel And Hardy by Simon Louvish\n\nBogart by A.M. Sperber and Eric Lax\n\nAlfred Hitchcock: A Life In Darkness And Light by Patrick McGilligan\n\nGroucho: The Life And Times Of Julius Henry Marx by Stefan Kanfer\n\nOn Sunset Boulevard: The Life And Times Of Billy Wilder by Ed Sikov\n\nThe Beatles: The Biography by Bob Spitz\n\nOthers I frequently use:\n\nAgee on Film by James Agee. (Also in a Library of America collection). Contemporary reviews of now classic films. Agee is considered by many to be the first true movie reviewer.\n\nYou Ain’t Heard Nothing Yet: The American Talking Film: History and Memory: 1927-1949 by Andrew Sarris. I’ve never read this all the way through - it is divided up into many individual topic chapters for browsing - but whenever I have dipped into it, I have been educated.\n\nSaturday Night At The Bijou by David Zinman. A look at some of the most popular of the movie series of the classic era. Production histories of the likes of Charlie Chan, Mr. Moto, Andy Hardy, Crime Doctor, Nancy Drew and about two dozen others.\n\nPost by hi224 on\n\nI dipped into my copy of \"Sin In Soft Focus\" earlier this week.\n\nSome Great Biographies That Give A Lot Of Background About Film Production.

What was the main thing you learnt on the making of Night of the Demon (which recently came out on a Blu Ray Region Free special edition from Indicator,which I recommend) from the book?\n\nPost by Prime etc. on\n\nHi Prime, from the Amazon outline Beating the Devil: The Making of Night of the Demon (well done getting it at a good price!) sounds like a really interesting read. What was the main thing you learnt on the making of Night of the Demon (which recently came out on a Blu Ray Region Free special edition from Indicator,which I recommend) from the book?\n\nThe main thing is that the demon, contrary to frequent claims, was always intended to be shown as real, and not suggested as being ambiguous or possibly a figment of his imagination--which has been repeated numerous times, even by the director.\n\nThe demon had to be shown as real in order to build suspense from the fact that Holden is a skeptic, but the curse is real and he needs to learn this. Whether they showed the demon too much is another thing, but in the script it is not meant to be ambiguous.\n\nPost by morrisondylanfan on\n\nI dipped into my copy of \"Sin In Soft Focus\" earlier this week.\n\nSome Great Biographies That Give A Lot Of Background About Film Production.

After all, \"Sin in Soft Focus\" will be 20 years old this year. I looked at Vieira's web site for info and saw the book cover picture (Gable and Harlow) plus a photo from \"Footlight Parade.\" Neither of those illustrations appear in Sin/Soft Focus. Still, I would want to have a look at the book before making a purchase. As Vieira's site says, \"Coming to stores...April 2, 2019!\"\n\nPost by teleadm on\n\nSome of my favorites over the years:\n\nDennis Gifford's A Pictoral History of Horror Movies\n\nHoward B.

A favourite annual is the English publication Picture Show Annual sold to the colonies, the first hardback annual was released in 1926 and ran until the early 1961. I have collected all except for three volumes from the war years 44, 45 & 46 which do not seem to exist ?. The annuals were released at the end of each year for the holiday xmas season, the 1926 annual is actually 1925 in film.\n\nAn outstanding highlight within the 160 pages is three sections of full page magnificent beautifully toned photographic portraits signed by the stars.\n\nPost by morrisondylanfan on\n\nSome of my favorites over the years:\n\nDennis Gifford's A Pictoral History of Horror Movies\n\nHoward B.
