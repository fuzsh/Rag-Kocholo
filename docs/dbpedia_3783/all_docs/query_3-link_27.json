You can usually find this information on the article's first page, either listed at the top with the author names, or in a footnote.\n\nSometimes authors are listed with their advanced degrees (for example, they may be listed with a \"PhD\" next to their name).\n\nWhere are the author's credentials listed in a book?\n\nScholarly books will typically list the research institution that each author is affiliated with on the title page, in an author's note or an \"about the author\" page, or (if the book is a collection of submitted chapters) at the beginning of each chapter.\n\nWhere can I find more information about an author?\n\nTry these sources:\n\nUniversities/research institutions usually have biography pages or CVs posted for their faculty. Run a Google search for the author's name, and the name of their institution (for example: Mary Beard AND Oxford University).\n\nResearchers often set up a Google Scholar author profile, where others can find links to their work.\n\nWhere can I find information about a well-known author/theorist?\n\nTry looking for scholarly encyclopedia entries about your subject in these databases:\n\nCredo Reference\n\nGale"
