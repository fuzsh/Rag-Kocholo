        "text": "Tom Waits went to her wedding. David Bowie recorded her work — music so significant it was credited with helping to erode support for the Berlin Wall — but eventually found her odious. Like any interdisciplinary provocateur in the 1980s, she was an “occasional friend and occasional enemy” of Susan Sontag.\n\nAnd, crucially, she never existed.\n\nThis controversial, identity-eschewing artist is the subject of Catherine Lacey’s new novel, “Biography of X,” a sneaky book that purports to be a work of investigative nonfiction written by X’s widow, C.M.\n\nThe story opens after X’s death in 1996, when C.M., incensed by an unauthorized book about her wife, sets out to write a corrective. A reporter by trade, she digs into X’s archives and legacy, compelled to understand the woman who had fascinated and terrified her. C.M. knew X was willing to trample on others in service of her art, but was not prepared for the extent of X’s deception and violence, leaving her to reconcile her love for an evasive monster.\n\nLacey once harbored the idea of being a journalist — she received an M.F.A. in creative nonfiction at Columbia — though over her career has found herself turning to fiction when she gets stuck. “Biography of X” began when Lacey tried to write a real biography. When that project stalled, she swerved back to familiar ground: fiction.\n\nLacey realized that many of the biographies that interested her were written by someone who was compromised in some way. In setting out to write her book, she explored the idea: Who would be the worst possible person to write a biography? Her answer was C.M., a widow torn apart by grief over the loss of a partner she revered.\n\nA few things about the novel clicked right away: Lacey wasn’t interested in writing about a world where the internet or even cellphones existed. She didn’t want to grapple with the power dynamics inherent to a heterosexual couple. And she knew the subject had to be dead.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
