        "text": "There is increasing pressure on researchers to show the societal impact of their research.\n\nOpen access can help your work reach new readers, beyond those with easy access to a research library.\n\nCo-authors must agree on who will take on the role of corresponding author. It is then the responsibility of the corresponding author to reach consensus with all co-authors regarding all aspects of the article, prior to submission. This includes the authorship list and order, and list of correct affiliations.\n\nThe corresponding author is also responsible for liaising with co-authors regarding any editorial queries. And, they act on behalf of all co-authors in any communication about the article throughout: submission, peer review, production, and after publication. The corresponding author signs the publishing agreement on behalf of all the listed authors.\n\nAuthors must be aware that using AI-based tools and technologies for article content generation, e.g. large language models (LLMs), generative AI, and chatbots (e.g. ChatGPT), is not in line with our authorship criteria.\n\nAll authors are wholly responsible for the originality, validity and integrity of the content of their submissions. Therefore, LLMs and other similar types of tools do not meet the criteria for authorship.\n\nWhere AI tools are used in content generation, they must be acknowledged and documented appropriately in the authored work.\n\nContributions made by professional scientific, medical or technical writers, translators or anyone who has assisted with the manuscript content, must be acknowledged. Their source of funding must also be declared.\n\nThey should be included in an ‘Acknowledgments’ section with an explanation of their role, or they should be included in the author list if appropriate.\n\nAuthors are advised to consult the joint position statement from American Medical Writers Association (AMWA), European Medical Writers Association (EMWA), and International Society of Medical Publication Professionals (ISMPP).\n\nAny significant contribution to the research reported, should be appropriately credited according to our authorship criteria.\n\nIf any parts of the research were outsourced to professional laboratories or to data analysts, this should be clearly stated within the manuscript, alongside an explanation of their role. Or, they should be included in the author list if appropriate.\n\nAuthors are responsible for retaining all of the original data related to their work, and should be prepared to share it with the journal editorial office if requested.\n\nAny individuals who have contributed to the article (for example, technical assistance, formatting-related writing assistance, translators, scholarly discussions which significantly contributed to developing the article), but who do not meet the criteria for authorship, should be listed by name and affiliation in an ‘Acknowledgments’ section.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the authors to notify and obtain permission from those they wish to identify in this section. The process of obtaining permission should include sharing the article, so that those being identified can verify the context in which their contribution is being acknowledged.\n\nAny assistance from AI tools for content generation (e.g. large language models) and other similar types of technical tools which generate article content, must be clearly acknowledged within the article. It is the responsibility of authors to ensure the validity, originality and integrity of their article content. Authors are expected to use these types of tools responsibly and in accordance with our editorial policies on authorship and principles of publishing ethics.\n\nIf an author wishes for a correction notice to be published alongside their name change, Taylor & Francis will accommodate this on request. But, it is not required for an author name change to be made.\n\nTo request a name change, please contact your Journal’s Production Editor or contact us.\n\nTaylor & Francis consider it a breach of publication ethics to request a name change for an individual without their explicit consent."
