        "text": "During HAEDES' last Soul Event, we took the time to unfold some regenerative principles. We opened our mind, our heart and our will to discover the potential of some frameworks and how they can shape our thinking. It was by engaging with the Levels of Energy framework that we shifted our thinking. When your energy goes to vital activities or is needed to survive, you are focussed on yourself. While you evolve towards automatic, you start to interact with your environment, but when you are acting from potential and being sensitive and conscious you open up for the world around you while holding your own perspective in mind. Regenerative thinking helps us to unfold essence, potential and develop with the bio-cultural-uniqueness of a place... while it also helps us to discover our own uniqueness and role... #regenerativeleadership #regenerativedevelopment #openheart\n\nHave you set your New Year's resolutions yet? üò≥ It can be hard to set (and stick to!) goals this time of year. So, we thought we'd give you a helping hand. ü§ù In our latest blog, we delve into the power of effective goal-setting and how to apply this to set specific goals that support your personal development and our planet, too. üåè Because, after all, they're entirely connected. Let's create a better life for ourselves in 2024. ‚úä Dive in here: https://lnkd.in/ddvba8Jx Tell us what personal sustainable goals you're setting this year in the comments below! üí¨üëá #CarbonLiteracy #NewYearsResolutions #GoalSetting #SustainableGoals #LowCarbonCulture\n\nAn estimated 118 Billion people have lived till todate. Yet many more millions of times the human race will live in future. There is a strong moral reason to consider how the actions and decisions we take today affect the lives of huge numbers of future people. Some of the decisions, we make this century will impact the entire course of humanity's future. One major way is by improving the values that guide society. AI systems may surpass human capabilities in a matter of decades, and it is far from clear that the transition to such a transformative, general-purpose technology will go well. There have been many ways to positively shape the future throughout history from small acts like planting forests and recording information, to far-sighted moral advocacy whose effects have lasted through the present day. Organizations, too, are orienting towards the long term across a range of areas. But we should think about such things. After all, the future is just as real as the present or the past. We overlook it merely because it‚Äôs out of sight, and therefore out of mind. It means thinking about the challenges we might face in our lifetimes that could impact civilisation‚Äôs whole trajectory, and taking action to benefit not just the present generation, but all generations to come. Look at vehicle emissions, industrial pollution, fossil-fuel-fired power stations, waste-burning, and coal burned by thousands of brick kilns, plastic waste and many more. Life will continue but I am of the opinion, our actions must benefit the future generations in Human Development Index. Let these be principles of good governance, Green initiatives, Clean energy and peaceful coexistence with nature and neighborhoods. By next 100 years, world population would increase by several billions and apparently most of our fields and forests would disappear and become cities.\n\nGet Out of DOCUMENTS. . Sun is a reality, Moon is a reality. We don't need to document these. We don't need to document that sun rose today, sun set today. Why? Because we can just simply observe it. We can see it happening. Same applies for Sustainability Efforts. Don't mere document for the sake of regulatory compliance, instead live your way into it. Adapt it into routine operations. But, a new question arises that how to do it? How to cultivate the culture of sustainability in our way of living? It's simple, Aware, Act, Improve. Talk about it with everyone; Leave no one behind. Then Act on it. You know the next thing, measure, analyze, and Improve. #sustainabilityconsulting"
