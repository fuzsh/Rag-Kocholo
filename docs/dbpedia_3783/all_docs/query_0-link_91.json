        "text": "Running is not my cup of tea. But neither is brushing my teeth. For 28 days in a row, we've run. Not far, not fast, not fun, but frequent. Brushing, just like running through, have very nice effects. Or rather, I don't want the consequences of not doing it. I had hoped that it would feel easier and funnier by now. I had hopes that I would feel strong and fierce. It did not happen. It's still quite boring. But the threshold to do it is zero now. I just put my shoes on at 7.30 every morning and bring the dog. Like with any habit. Like with the teeth. I guess with some continuity, we could apply this to anything boring but needed in our lives, starting small and frequent. The fact that it's short, only some 15 minutes, and that I don't allow excuses because who can't find 15 minutes (just put the phone down). Agree? #runstreak #habits #thepowerofhabits\n\nIt's here! Full of #pollinators! Beautiful and low-maintenance. My/our #biodiversity garden. When we moved to this old house I wanted our garden to be an oasis of the city (being located very centrally with lots of asphalt around) . If the values of garden design are; 1. good looking 2. low maintenance 3. biodiversity I've probably split it evenly between the three, not gone wild on native etc. Gardening is like interior decoration but less harmful for the environment. You can essentially bring value to nature, instead of the opposite which we normally do. It also depends on so many aspects you can't predict easily. Shade, soil, weather. That's why I like it.\n\nüç∞ It would be like bringing cake to the Weight watchers, flying to a course on net-zero in the UK. So I am here in the rain, after two days on the train. Ready for a three day training on net-zero supported by IEMA. Did you know that the train ride from Brussels to London is only two hours? I'm still in shock. The whole trip took one book, two naps, a few A4s of text for my book, some e-mails, and an outline of a sustainability training and a climate transition plan. Business travels by #train take more time from me right now, but not so much from future generations, later. I also got to see Europe's most overrated tourist trap in Belgium, and go for a run on the fields along the brick houses around Staverton Park Hotel & Golf Club. #trainfluencer #train #dbb #db #sj #eurostar\n\nüöÑ My 5 best tips for a smooth train ride in Europe after 25 years of train-ing and 25 000 kilometers on railways over the last year. I get many questions on how to get around by train in Europe. Where does one book? Is it hard? Is it expensive? Below is my best advice. 1. Find the best way to get out of your country. You do this by downloading the Rail planner app. If you are in Sweden, you will typically want to go to Hamburg ‚Äì the port to the rest of Europe. You can get there in less than 10 hours from Stockholm. Night train or day train. If you are in the DACH region it is even easier ‚Äì ridiculously close to everything. 2. Buy seat reservations in advance ‚Äì you will find most of them on www.eurorail.com, but a tip can also be to buy German seat reservations from www.db.de since it is cheaper (less than 7 euros). In Sweden seat reservations can be bought from www.sj.se. 3. No spontaneity in France (at least during the busier periods of the year)! The number of seats available for interrail passes on the fast trains is typically very low. I have been stranded in the middle of France for days in 40 degrees! 4. Have a buffer for delays. I usually stay one night in Hamburg so I have some margin if the train is late before going further south. It is then usually less than a workday to most destinations in central Europe such as Brussels, Paris, Zurich, etc. 5. Practice patience. One train at the time. Sometimes you arrive late, miss trains and get pissed off. Do count on this in Germany and Sweden, not so much in Spain and Switzerland. Make sure you eat regularly. Bring food and water (especially on Danish trains). There are usually more trains available if you ask at the train station than you find in the app. Don't panic! #trainfluent #trainfluencer #dbb #sj #db #renfe #sncf business travel #train"
