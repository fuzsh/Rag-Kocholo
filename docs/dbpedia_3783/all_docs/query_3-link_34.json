        "text": "Pat Zietlow Miller knew she wanted to be a writer ever since her seventh-grade English teacher read her paper about square-dancing skirts out loud in class and said: “This is the first time anything a student has written has given me chills.” (Mrs. Mueller rocks! That's why I dedicated my picture book BE STRONG to her.)\n\nPat started out as a newspaper reporter and wrote about everything from dartball and deer-hunting to diets and decoupage. Then, she joined an insurance company -- and then another -- and edited their newsletters and magazines.\n\nNow, Pat focuses on her favorite thing -- writing picture books. She's sold 25 books and is always working on more.\n\nPat has one wonderful husband, two delightful daughters and two pampered cats. If she's not at home, you likely can find her in a bookstore or library.\n\nShe doesn’t watch much TV, but she does love “Chopped,\" \"Tournament of Champions\" and \"The Great Britisth Baking Show.\"\n\nPat lives in Wisconsin.\n\nWant to know how to pronounce her name?\n\nVisit the Author Name Pronunciation Guide from Teaching Books.net. It features her name and those of lots of other authors.\n\nWhy did you decide to write picture books?\n\nI’ve always loved picture books. Even when I was reading more grown-up books, I always read picture books too. There’s a lot of truth and beauty in a well-done picture book, and truth and beauty are something you never outgrow.\n\nPlus, I really like the challenge of creating a complete, fully realized story in such a small space. It’s like verbal Sudoku. And when you achieve it, it is incredibly satisfying.\n\nDo you draw your own pictures?\n\nAbsolutely not. My artistic expertise is limited to doodling. I am so happy to leave the illustrations to professional artists. In fact, seeing the artwork come back for my books is one of my favorite parts in the process. It’s thrilling to see how someone else interprets my stories and sees my characters.\n\nDo you get to pick the artist?\n\nNope. That’s up to the book’s publisher. This answer surprises a lot of people, but there’s a reason for it. Book publishers have people who work as art directors. They know so much more than I do about which artists would do the best job.\n\nSometimes, they ask for my opinion, which is nice, but I wouldn’t want the responsibility of having to choose. There are so many talented illustrators. And every time I sell another book, I get paired with a wonderfully talented person.\n\nWhat books do you like to read?\n\nI read a ton of picture books – partly because I love them and partly to see what wonderful things other authors are doing. I always have a stack on reserve at the library. Here's my list of favorites.\n\nBut I also read middle grade, young adult and adult books. And, I love contemporary memoirs and warm and fuzzy romances. Recent favorite grown-up reads are:\n\nTHIS IS HOW IT ALWAYS IS by Laurie Frankel.\n\nI'LL HAVE WHAT SHE'S HAVING by Erin Carlson.\n\nPARTY OF TWO by Jasmine Guillory.\n\nRAPTURE PRACTICE by Aaron Hartzler.\n\nTHE END OF YOUR LIFE BOOK CLUB by Will Schwalbe.\n\nSISTER, MOTHER, HUSBAND, DOG and LEFT ON TENTH both by Delia Ephron.\n\nVANESSA YU'S MAGICAL PARIS TEA SHOP by Roselle Lim.\n\nWho are your favorite authors?\n\nThere are so many that making a list could get me into trouble, but I adore picture book writers Kari Best, Sandra Boynton, Tameka Fryer Brown, Dori Chaconas, Carolyn Crimi, Kelly DiPucchio, Ame Dyckman, Jill Esbaum, Julie Fogliano, Mem Fox, Vashti Harrison, Kevin Henkes, Debbie Ridpath Ohi, Mary Lyn Ray, Jacqui Robbins, Dan Santat, Liz Garton Scanlon, Laurie Wallmark, Joyce Wan, Andrea Wang and Carole Boston Weatherford.\n\nFor MG and YA, I like anything by Becky Albertalli, Anne Brashares, Sharon Creech, Barbara Dee, Kate DiCamillo, Donna Gephart, John Green, David Levithan, Ellen Raskin, Gary Schmidt, Jacqueline Woodson and Lisa Yee. And, full disclosure, I’ve read each book in the Hunger Games trilogy at least eight times. Go, Suzanne Collins!\n\nWhat books did you read growing up?\n\nI was monstrously addicted to the ANNE OF GREEN GABLES series. I also loved THE WESTING GAME, BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA, the ENCYCLOPEDIA BROWN series and THE BOXCAR CHILDREN series. And, I loved WHEN I HAVE A LITTLE GIRL by Charlotte Zolotow.\n\nWhat are your favorite things?\n\nColors – Purple and blue.\n\nAnimals – Cats and kittens.\n\nFood – Potatoes, served almost any way. And dark chocolate. (But separately, not mixed in with the potatoes.) And, a really good omelet.\n\nFlowers – Tulips and pansies.\n\nActivities – Reading. Walking around exploring new places. Singing along to the radio. Learning new things.\n\nWhat do you wish you could do?\n\nJuggle, act, dance and parallel park. There’s hope for the juggling. The other three? Not so much."
