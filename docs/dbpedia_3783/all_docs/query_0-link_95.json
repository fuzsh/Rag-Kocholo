Benvenuto Cellini says in his wonderfully demented autobiography that you should not write such a work before you are forty, but five years short I want to give an account of some fabrications that have taken place in my life, lies that were uttered by me or others and left undenied long enough that they obtained a measure of being, if not truth. Truth itself may be more brightly arranged around the shadow of its adventurous twin. But for a lie I might not have even been born. During my parents’ courtship back in Bosnia, Dad shaved a year or two…\n\nThe seventeen photographs in this issue, all done by Hiroshi Sugimoto, are copyrighted in the name of the artist and reproduced with his generous permission, courtesy of Fraenkel Gallery.

Saw a street in hell and one in paradise.Saw a room with a light in it so ailingIt could’ve been leaning on a cane. Saw an old man in a tailor shop Kneel before a bride with pins between his lips.Saw the President swear on the Biblewhile snow fell around him.Saw a pair of lovers kiss in an empty churchAnd a naked man run out of a buildingwaving a gun and sobbing. Saw kids wearing Halloween masksJump from one roof to another at sunset.Saw a van full of stray dogs look back at me.Saw a homeless woman berating GodAnd a blind man with a guitar singing:“Oh Lord remember me, When these chains are broken set my body free.”…\n\nThe Threepenny Review is supported by Hunter College, the Bernard Osher Foundation, the Campizondo Foundation, the Rosenthal Family Foundation, the Gerald Oppenheimer Family Foundation, the George Lichter Family Fund, and the Mad Rose Foundation.

In these photos, whether of historical figures (Oscar Wilde, Anne of Cleves, William Shakespeare, Salvador Dali) or of landscapes containing mountain lions, antelopes, and elk, Sugimoto manages to convey both a sense of immediacy and a sense of falseness. The latter is revealed by the extremely high technical quality of the photographs; the former is created by cutting out the frame,…"
