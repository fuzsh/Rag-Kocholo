        "text": "You must include the four documents outlined on this page for each of the senior/key personnel involved in your proposal to the U.S. National Science Foundation.\n\nThis page provides an overview of requirements for senior/key personnel documents. See the full requirements for these documents in the Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide (PAPPG) II.2.D.h.\n\nOn this page\n\nBiographical Sketch\n\nNSF requires a biographical sketch for each individual identified as senior/key personnel. See PAPPG Chapter II.D.2.h(i) for complete coverage on the content and formatting requirements for the biographical sketch.\n\nThis document outlines an individual's education and training, their appointments and positions, and other information that helps NSF assess how well qualified the individual is to conduct the proposed activities.\n\nWhat to include in your biographical sketch\n\nRefer to PAPPG II.D.2.h(i) for the full biographical sketch requirements. A brief outline of the information you will need to include is provided below.\n\nIdentifying information.\n\nOrganization and location.\n\nProfessional preparation.\n\nAppointments and positions.\n\nProducts.\n\nNote: Starting May 20, 2024, biographical sketches should no longer include information on synergistic activities. These activities must instead be listed in the new Synergistic Activities document.\n\nSenior/key personnel are required to certify that the information is current, accurate and complete. This includes, but is not limited to, information related to domestic and foreign appointments and positions. The certification language is included in the SciENcv template.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nDisclosures required in your biographical sketch\n\nThis table provides helpful reference information regarding pre-award and post-award disclosure information in the biographical sketch and current and pending support proposal sections. It identifies where these disclosures must be provided in proposals and in project reports.\n\nHow to format your biographical sketch\n\nNSF has partnered with the National Institutes of Health to use SciENcv: Science Experts Network Curriculum Vitae as the NSF-approved format for use in preparation of the biographical sketch section of an NSF proposal. Adoption of a single, common researcher profile system for federal grants reduces administrative burden for researchers.\n\nProposers must use SciENcv to prepare their biographical sketches for proposals to NSF.\n\nSciENcv will produce an NSF-compliant PDF version of the biographical sketch. Proposers must save this document and submit it as part of their proposal via Research.gov or Grants.gov.\n\nFrequently asked questions on using SciENcv\n\nCurrent and Pending (Other) Support\n\nNSF requires information on all current and pending support for ongoing projects and proposals. This document contains a list of an individual's proposed and active projects and sources of support. It is used by NSF to assess:\n\nThe capacity of the individual to carry out the proposed research.\n\nAny potential scientific and budgetary overlap or duplication across projects.\n\nThe potential the individual is overcommitting themselves with the proposed project.\n\nRefer to PAPPG II.D.2.h(ii) for the full Current and Pending (Other) Support requirements.\n\nWhat to include in your Current and Pending (Other) Support document\n\nA brief outline of the information you will need to include is provided below. Detailed information about the required content is available in PAPPG Chapter II.D.2.h(ii).\n\nIdentifying information.\n\nOrganization and location.\n\nProjects/proposals, including the following:\n\nProject/proposal title.\n\nStatus of support.\n\nSource of support.\n\nPrimary place of performance.\n\nStart date.\n\nEnd date.\n\nTotal award amount.\n\nPerson-months (or partial person-months) per year committed to the project/proposed project.\n\nOverall objectives.\n\nStatement of potential overlap.\n\nIn-kind contributions.\n\nCertification that the information you've provided is current, accurate and complete.\n\nSenior/key personnel are required to certify that the information is current, accurate and complete. This includes, but is not limited to, information related to current, pending and other support (both foreign and domestic).\n\nAdditional information:\n\nDisclosures required in your Current and Pending (Other) Support:\n\nThis table provides helpful reference information regarding pre-award and post-award disclosure information in the biographical sketch and current and pending support proposal sections. It identifies where these disclosures must be provided in proposals and in project reports.\n\nHow to format your Current and Pending (Other) Support information\n\nNSF has partnered with the National Institutes of Health to use SciENcv: Science Experts Network Curriculum Vitae as the NSF-approved format for use in preparation of the current and pending support section of an NSF proposal. Adoption of a single, common researcher profile system for federal grants reduces administrative burden for researchers.\n\nProposers must use SciENcv to prepare their Current and Pending (Other) Support information for proposals to NSF.\n\nSciENcv will produce NSF-compliant PDF versions of the current and pending support format. Proposers must save this document and submit it as part of their proposal via Research.gov or Grants.gov.\n\nFrequently asked questions on using SciENcv\n\nCollaborators and Other Affiliations\n\nThis document contains a table of an individual's collaborators, such as their advisors, co-authors and students. NSF requires the use of the Collaborators and Other Affiliations Excel Template for identifying this information. NSF uses Collaborators and Other Affiliations information during the merit review process to help manage reviewer selection. To expedite identification of potential reviewers, having a standard, searchable format for this information is essential.\n\nNOTE: Some information requested in prior versions of the PAPPG is no longer requested. This is purposeful and we no longer require you to report this information.\n\nIn the past, the submission of collaborators and other affiliations information was often in formats that resulted in unsearchable text because of the variety of software and document formats used.\n\nBy having each principal investigator, co-PI and other senior project personnel individually upload an .xlsx document, and having Research.gov perform all of the conversions, we preserve searchable text in the resulting PDFs to the greatest extent practicable. This will help reduce the burden on NSF program staff who currently must spend time to manipulate files that are non-searchable.\n\nIn addition to the benefits to the merit review process, it is hoped that this template will provide a compliant and reusable format for PIs to maintain and update their collaborators and other affiliations information for use in subsequent proposal submissions to NSF.\n\nWhat to include in your Collaborators and Other Affiliations information\n\nRefer to PAPPG II.D.2.h(iii) for the full Collaborators and Other Affiliations information requirements. A brief outline of the information you will need to include is provided below.\n\nYour name and organizational affiliation.\n\nThe names of anyone whose relationship to you precludes their service as a reviewer — including personal, family or business relationships — and what type of relationship you have with them.\n\nNames and organizational affiliations of your Ph.D. advisor and Ph.D. thesis advisees.\n\nNames and organizational affiliations of any co-authors or project collaborators in the last 48 months.\n\nNames of editorial boards, editors-in-chief and co-editors you have interacted with in the last 24 months. Do not list editors or reviewers you have interacted with because of a paper submission.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nFrequently asked questions: Collaborators and Other Affiliations\n\nHow to format your Collaborators and Other Affiliations information\n\nYou must use NSF's Collaborators and Other Affiliations Excel Template to prepare your information. The template has been developed to be fillable, however, the content and format requirements must not be altered as this will create printing and viewing errors.\n\nThe way you upload your completed information will depend on whether you are submitting your proposal via Research.gov or Grants.gov.\n\nResearch.gov users: This template must be saved in .xlsx format and directly uploaded into Research.gov as a Collaborators and Other Affiliations Single Copy Document. Research.gov will convert the uploaded .xlsx file to a PDF. Using the .xlsx format will enable preservation of searchable text that otherwise would be lost. It is imperative that this document be uploaded in .xlsx format only; uploading a document in any format other than .xlsx may delay the timely processing and review of your proposal.\n\nGrants.gov users: The collaborators and other affiliations information must be provided through use of the template and uploaded as a PDF attachment.\n\nSynergistic Activities\n\nNSF requires this one-page document for each individual identified as senior/key personnel.\n\nWhat to include in your Synergistic Activities information\n\nA list of up to five distinct examples that demonstrate the broader impact of your professional and scholarly activities, focusing on the creation, integration and transfer of knowledge.\n\nRefer to PAPPG II.D.2.h(iv) for additional information.\n\nHow to format your Synergistic Activities information\n\nOnce you have prepared your Synergistic Activities information, save it as a PDF and submit it as part of your proposal via Research.gov or Grants.gov.\n\nQuestions?\n\nFor submission system-related questions, please contact the NSF Help Desk at 1-800-381-1532 or rgov@nsf.gov.\n\nPolicy-related questions regarding the content of the senior/key personnel documents should be directed to policy@nsf.gov."
