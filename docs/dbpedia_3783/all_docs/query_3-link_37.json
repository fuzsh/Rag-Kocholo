        "text": "And now for a bit more detail...\n\n​\n\nYou may have heard that I used to write history textbooks for a living.\n\nIt's true, and I'm really sorry (full confession on file here).\n\n​\n\nNow, let’s move on to more pleasant topics of conversation.\n\nI was born in Brooklyn, NY. My family lived in Mississippi and Colorado before moving back to New York and settling in the suburbs of New York City. As a kid my favorite books were action stories and outdoor adventures: sea stories, searches for buried treasure, sharks eating people… that kind of thing. Another thing I loved to do was make movies with my younger brother, Ari. Our plan was to be famous filmmakers one day.\n\nI went to Syracuse University and studied communications and international relations. The highlight of those years was a summer I spent in Central America, where I worked on a documentary on the streets of Managua, Nicaragua.\n\nAfter college I moved to Washington, D.C., and worked for an environmental group, The National Audubon Society. Then, when Ari graduated from college a few years later, we decided to move to Austin, Texas, and make movies together. We lived like paupers in a house with a hole in the floor where bugs crawled in. We wrote some screenplays, and in 1995 made our own feature film, a comedy called A More Perfect Union (trailer here). We were sure it was going to be a huge hit!\n\nActually, it bombed. We wound up deep in debt.\n\nBut I was still determined to make it as a writer - somehow. I moved to\n\nBrooklyn and (while working a series of crummy jobs) wrote short stories, screenplays, and worked on a comic called The Adventures of Rabbi Harvey. In 2006, after literally hundreds of rejections, my first Rabbi Harvey graphic novel was finally published.\n\nMeanwhile, I started working for an educational publishing company, just for the money. We’d hire people to write history textbooks, and they’d send in their writing, and it was my job to check facts and make little edits to clarify the text. Once in a while I was given the chance to write little pieces of textbooks, like one-page biographies or skills lessons (“Understanding Bar Graphs” was one of my early works). The editors noticed that my writing was pretty good and they started giving me less editing to do, and more writing. Gradually, I began writing chapters for textbooks, and that turned into my full-time job. All the while, I kept working on my own writing projects.\n\nIn 2008 I wrote my last textbook. I walked away, and shall never return! My first non-textbook history book was King George: What Was His Problem? – full of all the stories about the American Revolution that I was never allowed to put into textbooks. Looking back, I actually feel pretty lucky to have spent all those years writing textbooks. It forced me to write every day, which is great practice. And I collected hundreds of amazing true stories - many of which I've used in books like Bomb and Undefeated.\n\n​​"
