        "text": "Princess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway (born 21 January 2004) is the eldest child of Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway and Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway, and the grandchild of King Harald V and Queen Sonja of Norway. She is second in line of succession to the Norwegian throne after her father. She is expected to become the country’s second female monarch, after the 15th-century Queen Margaret.\n\nShe represents the fifth generation of the sitting Norwegian royal family of the House of Glucksburg.\n\nShe has a younger brother, Prince Sverre Magnus, whom she ranks above in the line of succession after the implementation of absolute primogeniture in 1990.\n\nBirth and Baptism\n\nBorn on 21 January 2004 at 9:13 am in The National Hospital, part of the Oslo University Hospital in Oslo, Princess Ingrid Alexandra is the first child and only daughter Crown Prince Haakon, heir apparent to the throne, and the second granddaughter of King Harald V and Queen Sonja. Her mother, Crown Princess Mette-Marit, has a son named Marius Borg Hoiby, born in 1997 from a previous relationship. Following Ingrid Alexandra’s birth, the already well-regarded royal family experienced an upsurge of popularity.\n\nIngrid Alexandra was baptized by Bishop Gunnar Stalsett in the chapel of the Royal Palace on 17 April 2004. Her grandfather the King, her aunt Princess Martha Louise, King Frederik X of Denmark, the Crown Princess of Sweden, King Felipe VI of Spain, and her maternal grandmother Marit Tjessem were her godparents. The then-Crown Prince of Denmark and then-Prince of Asturias were unable to attend the christening due to their respective weddings scheduled to occur within a month of the christening.\n\nOn 31 August 2019, Ingrid Alexandra was confirmed in the Palace Chapel in Oslo with all her godparents present.\n\nEducation\n\nIngrid Alexandra started her first day of school on 19 August 2010 at Janslokka elementary school, a local state school attended by her half-brother. Her parents chose the school because they wanted her to have as ordinary a childhood as possible. Newspaper reports said Princes Ingrid Alexandra would walk to school with her half-brother, and local citizens could expect to see her occasionally out in the community with her classmates on school outings. School officials hoped to make the school a place where the princess could make friends and enjoy some relief from public scrutiny.\n\nOn 17 June 2014, the Norwegian royal family announced that from the start of the 2014-2015 school year, Ingrid Alexandra would transfer to the private English-language Oslo International School, reportedly because her parents wanted her to be fluent in English. Ingrid Alexandra was transferred to Oslo's Uranienborg School to complete her lower secondary education. She was part of the student council at Uranienborg School. In the fall of 2020, she began further schooling at Elvebakken Upper Secondary School in Oslo. She graduated in April 2023. In June 2023, Norwegian Royal Court announced that the Princess will work as a school assistant and environmental worker at Uranienborg School. In 2024, she will undertake military training for 12 months at the Engineer Battalion in Brigade Nord.\n\nActivities\n\nOn 19 June 2010, Ingrid Alexandra served as a bridesmaid at the wedding of Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Daniel Westling. In December 2012, the Princess attended an interview with her father by a Norwegian television program in aid of Environmental Agents, the children's environmental organization. Her mother was supposed to attend, but the Crown Princess attended instead as the Crown Princess was ill. She has taken part in traditional celebrations of the Constitution Day, as well as the traditional ski jumping tournament at Holmenkollen in Oslo.\n\nOn 4 May 2015, Ingrid Alexandra christened the Norwegian Rescue Company's new lifeboat, Elias, in her first royal assignment. Accompanied by her grandfather the King, she was made godmother of the boat. On 19 May 2016, the Princess Ingrid Alexandra Sculpture Park opened in the Palace Park, as part of the celebration of the King and Queen's 25th anniversary. It features sculptures made for children and by children. She takes active part in choosing the designs from the contributions to the sculpture park from school children all over Norway. In 2018, she gave a guided tour of the park to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, on the occasion of their official visit to Norway.\n\non 12 February 2016, Ingrid Alexandra and her grandfather participated in the opening ceremony of the II Winter Youth Olympics in Lillehammer: the King, as he previously did in 1994 Winter Olympics, declared the Games opened, while the Princess, like her father Crown Prince Haakon did 22 years before, lit the cauldron.\n\nOn 17 November 2018, Princess Ingrid Alexandra christened the research vessel Kronprins Haakon, which was named after her father. The vessel was christened at its home port of Tromso. The princess spoke of her interest in the ocean and climate change, which motivated her in christening the ship. She stated that the ship will bring \"new and crucial knowledge about the polar areas, about the oceans and about climate change.\"\n\nIngrid Alexandra won a gold medal in the Norwegian surfing championship for juniors in October 2020. She is known as an avid surfer, and she also trains at skiing and kickboxing.\n\nOn 20 January 2022, Ingrid Alexandra visited the three branches of the Norwegian government; the Storting, the Supreme Court and the office of the prime minister. These visits were part of a series of activities Princess Ingrid Alexandra undertook ahead of her 18th birthday the next day. Her father, Crown Prince Haakon, did the same on his own 18th birthday in 1991. On the day of her birthday on 21 January, she attended a meeting of the Council of State alongside Crown Prince Haakon and King Harald. This was followed by a series of congratulatory deputations from Norwegian officials at the Royal Palace. The Princess received congratulations from representatives of the governmental branches as well as the Sami Parliament, county governors, the diplomatic corps, the Norwegian Armed Forces and the Church of Norway. Cannon salutes were fired at noon to mark Ingrid Alexandra's birthday. On 16 June, the government held a dinner to mark her 18th birthday at the Oslo Public Library. On 17 June, a gala dinner was hosted by her grandparents, the King and Queen, at the Royal Palace. Guests from many European royal houses attended.\n\nIn October 2022, Ingrid Alexandra visited Norwegian Army's Setermoen camp in Indre Troms.\n\nConstitutional Status\n\nThe Constitution of Norway was altered in 1990 to introduce absolute primogeniture, ensuring that the crown would pass to the eldest child regardless of sex but keeping the Crown Prince ahead of his elder sister, Princess Martha Louise; the change was to apply for the first time to their children. Princess Ingrid Alexandra has thus been second in the line of succession since birth, preceded only by her father. Because of the reform, her status was not affected by the subsequent birth of her brother, Prince Sverre Magnus, in 2005.\n\nThe Princess is expected to become Norway's first female monarch since Queen Margaret, who reigned over Norway, Denmark and Sweden from the late 1380s until her death in 1412.\n\nAlong with her parents and grandparents-but unlike her younger Sverre, her older maternal half-brother Marius, and other relatives-Princess Ingrid Alexandra is a member of the Norwegian Royal House.\n\nThe family belongs to the House of Glucksburg.\n\nTitles, Styles and Honors\n\n21 January 2004-present Her Royal Highness Princess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway\n\n21 January 2004-present Her Royal Highness The Princess\n\nNational Honors\n\nNorway: Recipient of the Royal House Centennial Medal (25 November 2005)\n\nNorway: Recipient of King Harald V's Jubilee Medal (17 January 2016)\n\nNorway: Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav (21 January 2022)\n\nNorway Dame of the Royal Family Decoration of King Harald V (21 January 2022)\n\nForeign Honor\n\nDenmark: Knight of the Order of the Elephant (21 January 2022)\n\nHouse: Glucksburg"
