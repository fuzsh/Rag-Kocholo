        "text": "Prince Frederik's early life and education\n\nBorn at Copenhagen's Rigshospitalet on May 26, 1968, Frederik Andre Henrik Christian is the oldest son of Queen Margrethe of Denmark and Henri de Laborde de Monpezat. The young prince was thrust into the limelight early; when he was just three years old his grandfather, King Frederik IX died. His mother's subsequent accession to the throne meant he took on the title of crown prince.\n\nAfter finishing private school, Frederik studied foreign languages at a Copenhagen high school. Along with his younger brother Joachim, he later spent a year from 1982 to 1983 studying in his father's native country, at the Ecole des Roches in Verneuil-sur-Avre in Normandy. Upon turning 18 Frederik was given a seat on the Council of State, and from that time was empowered to assume the duties of Head of State whenever his mother was abroad.\n\nThe same year, he started his military education in the Queenâ€™s Life Guard Regiment and two years later was appointed as a lieutenant of the reserve. After obtaining that rank, Frederick became a platoon commander in the Royal Danish Hussar Guard Regiment and the following year earned the title of first lieutenant of the reserve.\n\nIn 1995, the Crown Prince graduated from the University of Aarhus with a MSc in Political Science, which included a year at Harvard University in the US.\n\nAfter graduation, Frederik returned to the military, this time in the Navy and completed training with the Royal Danish Navy Frogman Corps. He went on to be appointed the first lieutenant of the reserve (navy), and two years later in 1997 was appointed as a lieutenant commander of the reserve (navy) and as a captain of the reserve (army).\n\nIn 2000, he trained at The Flight School and became a captain of the reserve (air force).\n\nThe Crown Prince has been appointed to various positions over his military career, including commander in the navy and colonel in the army and the air force in 2010.\n\nPrince Frederik's family life\n\nIn the autumn of 2003, Frederik's engagement to Miss Mary Elizabeth Donaldson was announced. The couple, who met at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, were wed in Copenhagen Cathedral on May 14, 2004, with the wedding festivities being held at Fredensborg Palace. Through her marriage, Miss Mary became HRH Crown Princess Mary Elizabeth of Denmark.\n\nThe couple went on to welcome four children. Their first child, HRH Prince Christian Valdemar Henri Jean, was born on 15 October 2005, while their second, HRH Princess Isabella Henrietta Ingrid Margrethe, was welcomed on 21 April 2007.\n\nAlmost four years later, the royal pair welcomed twins, HRH Prince Vincent Frederik Minik Alexander and HRH Princess Josephine Sophia Ivalo Mathilda, who were born on 8 January 2011."
