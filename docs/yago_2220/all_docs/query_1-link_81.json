        "text": "Saint of the day online, Saturday, September 2, 2017\n\n26-08-2017\n\nSaint Name: St Ingrid of Sweden\n\nPlace: Stockholm, Sweden\n\nBirth: 28 March 1910\n\nDeath:7 November 2000\n\nFeast: September 2\n\nSt Ingrid of Sweden was Queen of Denmark from 1947 until 1972 as the wife of King Frederick IX.\n\nBorn into the House of Bernadotte, she was the daughter of King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden and his first wife Princess Margaret of Connaught. In 1935 she married Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark and they had three daughters, Margrethe, the present Queen of Denmark, Benedikte, now a Princess of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, and Anne-Marie, the former Greek queen.\n\nIn 1947, her husband became king on his father's death. As queen, Ingrid reformed the traditions of Danish court life, abolished many old-fashioned customs at court and created a more relaxed atmosphere at official receptions. King Frederick IX died in 1972, and Ingrid was widowed at the age of 61. Her eldest daughter, Margrethe aged 31, became the new Queen, and Ingrid now assumed a position as family matriarch.\n\nMiracles obtained through her intercession followed and led to a popular cult of this saint. In 1405, a canonization process was begun and the Swedish Bishops introduced her cause at the Council of Constance. An inquest was held in Sweden in 1416-1417 and the results were inconclusive. In 1497, the cause was reactivated and in 1507 her relics were solemnly translated, and a Mass and Office were composed - but formal canonization seems never to have occurred. During the Reformation, her cult came to an end and her convent and relics were destroyed.\n\nSt Ingrid of Sweden feast day is 2nd September."
