        "text": "Princess Benedikte of Denmark was born on 29 April 1944 at the Frederik VIII Palace of Amalienborg in central Copenhagen. She was the second child of the then Crown Prince Frederik and his Swedish-born wife, Crown Princess Ingrid, who had close links with the British Royal Family (her British-born mother Margaret was a granddaughter of Queen Victoria of Great Britain and Ireland). The Princess was baptized on 24 May in Holmens Church. Ingrid’s older sibling (born in 1940) was Margaretha who, in 1972, would ascend the throne of Denmark as Queen Margrethe II.\n\nThe Princess’ birth came at a difficult time for Denmark which was under German occupation. Civil unrest, especially among younger Danes, was on the increase and in the summer of 1944 sabotage operations were carried out in the Copenhagen area, with strikes breaking out throughout Denmark. There were serious food shortages too and a feeling of apprehension as to what the future held. Yet, within the year, Denmark was liberated from the Nazi terror. In 1946, Crown Princess Ingrid gave birth to a third daughter, Anne-Marie. The Crown Princely family were now complete.\n\nIn 1947, Benedikte’s paternal grandfather King Christian X died and her father ascended the throne as King Frederik IX of Denmark. The Princess was a shy child and only spoke when she was sure of what she wanted to say. Yet, she certainly knew how to make a point: when an English nanny called Mary was employed by Queen Ingrid, Benedikte complained repeatedly that she could not understand a word the woman said. As Margaretha was four years older-quite a gap at that age-Benedikte would, during these pre-teen years, be closer to Anne-Marie. The younger princesses tended to be referred to en famille as ‘the little ones’, right up until Benedikte was on the cusp of entering her teens. Queen Margrethe herself has acknowledged that ‘even though we grew up in a home where we saw each other daily… there was actually a lot of distance.’ She also recalls that ‘I probably wasn’t nice to Benedikte all the time. I teased her and she would get very upset.’ Although Bendedikte adored her ‘humorous’ father, he too had a teasing nature. The King also instilled in his reticent middle child that people ‘wave and they want to see you, so you have to wave [back].’ Frederik would often call out to her as they drove along in the car to remind her to acknowledge the onlookers and even instructed her on which side to wave. Margarethe has opined that her ‘reluctant’ sister had ‘a harder time adjusting to that regime’ than perhaps she had. Princess Benedikte has also mentioned that there was some sibling rivalry-hardly surprising-especially when it came to deciding who was to sit next to their mother. It must be remembered too that Queen Ingrid and King Frederik were kept busy with official engagements, so were invariably occupied. Furthermore, the children did not normally eat meals with their parents, except at weekends when they enjoyed Sunday lunch together. So this added another element of “distance”. Nonetheless, all the sisters were close to their parents and to the outside world they were seen as forming a tight family circle. Ingrid was undoubtedly a loving, but at times exacting, mother. Benedikte would remember, somewhat ruefully, that when she attended the N Zahle school, which was quite a distance away from the palace, ‘we had to walk to and from school because my mother thought it was healthy for us to have fresh air.’\n\nAt the time of Benedikte’s birth, woman were not permitted to succeed to the Danish throne, so there was no expectation that any of King Frederik’s daughters would ascend the throne. However, all this changed with the passing of the 1953 Act of Succession which permitted female succession to the throne following the principle of male-preference primogeniture. Benedikte’s elder sister Margrethe now became heir presumptive, while Benedikte and Anne-Marie became second and third in the line of succession respectively.\n\nAs the girls matured, Queen Ingrid, who retained some of the English customs of her late mother, loved nothing better than sitting down with her family each day at 4 p.m. to have “afternoon tea”. This fostered an atmosphere of ‘great cosiness’ especially in the winter months when the fire was lit in the sitting room. Summers were spent en famille at Gråsten Palace in Jutland; while Fredensborg Castle was the family’s home in spring and autumn. There was great fun too onboard the royal yacht Dannebrog, which visited ports all over Denmark each spring and summer in an orderly rotation. It was an ideal way for young Benedikte to become familiar with her homeland and the Danish people. On occasion, the yacht also made excursions to the Faroe Islands and Greenland, which were at that time Danish dependencies.\n\nInitially, Princess Benedikte was educated at N Zahle’s school in Copenhagen. At that time it was a girls-only establishment. She subsequently studied at Benenden School in England, followed by a spell at a Swiss finishing school in Lausanne. This ensured that she had a good grounding in English (which was widely spoken in royal circles in northern Europe) and in French. By this time, Benedikte was becoming more self-assured and sociable. She also developed an awareness of the opposite sex and of fashion. As was typical in Scandinavian royal circles, she completed her education on a practical note with a course in fashion and design at Margretheskolen in 1965.\n\nIn March 1967, at the age of 22, Princess Benedikte became engaged to His Highness Prince Richard zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg. The couple had met at the nuptials of Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands to Claus von Amsberg in Amsterdam the previous year. Their marriage was celebrated in Fredensborg Palace Church on 3 February 1968. After the wedding, the couple lived in a house in the grounds of the impressive Schloss Berleburg in the north-western German town of Bad Berleburg, some six hundred kilometres south of the Danish/German border. The Schloss has been described as the ‘jewel in the crown of Germany’s most forested region.’ Wildlife, including deer, abound in the surrounding 13,000 hectare estate. It was all so different from Denmark. Unlike her sister, Anne-Marie, who resigned her right to succeed to the throne on her marriage to King Constantine of the Hellenes in 1964, Princess Benedikte remained in the line of succession. This was ‘a great wish’ of both King Frederik and Crown Princess Margrethe. As Benedikte recalled it, ‘I knew from the start that I would have these two lives.’\n\nThe birth of Crown Princess Margrethe’s children, Frederik (now King Frederik X) in 1968 and Joachim in 1969, underlined the fact that Benedikte’s role would now be to support the sovereign. An ideal niche was her ability to act as a Counsellor of State if both the King and the Crown Princess happened to be out of the country or were otherwise indisposed. This was not a particularly demanding role (and included signing documents and holding audiences) but it provided Benedikte with a link with her homeland which might otherwise not have been there. It was fortunate that the Princess-like her mother Queen Ingrid-was disciplined in her way of living and working, as this enabled her to juggle her role as a wife and (later) mother at Berleburg, whilst also travelling once a month to Copenhagen (where she maintained an apartment at the Amalienborg) to undertake her official duties. Over the years, these visits would increase both in terms of frequency and duration.\n\nNevertheless, during the early years of her marriage to Richard, Benedikte’s primary role was very much that of a wife and a mother. In January 1969 , the Princess gave birth to a son Gustav in Frankfurt. The following year she gave birth to a daughter Alexandra and, in May 1975, to a second daughter Nathalie (both girls were born in Copenhagen and they would become Danish citizens in 1998). Benedikte’s relationship with Prince Richard was excellent. They were in many ways opposites and the perfect foil to each other. He tended to be outgoing and outspoken and was not adverse to raising his voice. Conversely, as Queen Margrethe has reflected, ‘My sister never raises her voice.’ Benedikte was also more tactful. Prince Richard was also very proud of his capable wife, who put her wonderful organisational skills to work as hostess at the many large shooting parties which were held at Berleburg. She socialised with the many guests, devised the dinner menus, arranged the table decorations and coordinated the seating plan. The Prince understood too, from the outset, that Bendikte would lead a sort of “double-life” and never resented her royal duties or periods spent in Copenhagen. In turn, Richard would teach his wife all about antiques (for he was an enthusiastic and knowledgeable collector) and like any other married couple they would attend auctions together and browse antique shops.\n\nThe death of King Frederik in January 1972 was a sad blow for Benedikte. He had been visibly frail for some time. With Margrethe’s children still toddlers and Queen Ingrid adjusting to a new life without her husband, Benedikte was a great support to the new Queen Margrethe II and was able to carry on with her duties as a Counsellor of State.\n\nWith the passage of time and other commitments permitting, the Princess has undertaken a plethora of engagements throughout Denmark. These increased following the death of her beloved mother, Queen Ingrid, in November 2000, as Benedikte would now assume many of her patronages. As she has previously revealed, ‘I was brought up to believe duties are not a burden but a joy.’ One can sense the influence of Queen Ingrid in that comment. The Princess is currently Patron or Chairman or Honorary Member of nearly fifty organisations in her homeland, and describing each of these in detail is beyond the limits of this article but it includes social, cultural, health and sport issues. However, here is a flavour of her involvement:\n\nThe Princess has always displayed a strong commitment to equestrian sports for she both owns and breeds throughbred horses. She is Patron of the Danish Equestrian Federation; Danish Warmblood Association (which is responsible for the breeding, selecting and sales of young horses) as well as Hestens Vaern (which deals with the wellbeing and welfare of horses). She is also involved with the World Breeding Federation for Sport Horses. 2022 was to prove a spectacular year for Danish equestrian sport: At the World Equestrian Championships which took place in Herning in August, the Princess, who was Patron of the event, was overjoyed when the Danish team won a total of ten medals, five of which were gold. Princess Benedikte was also able to proudly present the Lis Hartel’s Memorial Award to her daughter Princess Nathalie, who coached the Danish dressage team. To celebrate the medal wins, Benedikte held a party at the Amalienborg’s Christian VII Palace the following month for organisers, volunteers, and riders including the Danish dressage star and gold medallist, Cathrine Laudrup-Dufour.\n\nPrincess Benedikte is a long-time patron of the Alzheimer’s Association in Denmark and invariably presents the association’s annual Research Prize. The event is often serenaded by a “Dementia Choir.” The Association is involved in providing advice to sufferers, their families and carers. It also undertakes research into why dementia occurs, as well as examining new methods of treatment and care. On-line forums have also been introduced. In recent years, the Princess has opened a dementia-friendly garden and participated in a “dance-to- remember” event in Roskilde.\n\nHer Royal Highness is also interested in work among the young and vulnerable. Four years ago she took a role as Patron of Hellebro which provides accommodation, welfare facilities, residential training and work experience opportunities for the homeless. On one occasion, the Princess visited the organisation at Christmastime and kindly arranged for the St. Annæ Girls’ Choir (of which she is also Patron) to provide a choral selection as part of the Saint Lucia celebrations which features a procession of candle-bearing young women dressed in white, all of whom are led by a young “Lucia bride” wearing a crown or garland of candles. Non-alcoholic mulled wine and nibbles were served and by the time Her Royal Highness departed, everyone seemed uplifted.\n\nThe Princess also has a long association with the Scout movement, as did her late mother Queen Ingrid, whom she succeeds. A keen girl scout in her youth, she is patron of the Girl Scouts, as well as of the Danish Scout Corps. Benedikte is also involved with the World [Girl] Guide Foundation and has, since 1984, been a board member of the Olive Baden-Powell Society (named after the wife of the founder of scouting, Lord Baden Powell) which oversees strategies for the advancement of Girl Scouting and Girl Guiding worldwide. In 1993 the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts presented Princess Benedikte with their prestigious Silver Medal for outstanding service. Furthermore, on her 70th birthday she was featured on a Danish stamp wearing her scout uniform. Her Royal Highness tries to attend local camps and the Princess Benedikte Award is given out annually, in her honour, to generous benefactors.\n\nIn recent years, the Princess, as Patron of the Association for Eating Disorders and Self Harm (a patronage she has held since 2001) has become greatly concerned by ‘the prevalence’ of eating disorders and attempts at self-harm. She puts this down to us being a ‘more self-centred society’ and feels that there has developed too ‘a culture of perfection’ which a lot of people find difficult to handle. She herself has participated in ‘workshops’ held in such places as a girls’ boarding school at Herlufsholm. Benedikte has also visited the Associations offices in Copenhagen’s Dronningens Tværgade and is a keen fundraiser for the organisation. Indeed, in 2020, she received a donation of DK200,000 from Danish Freemasons as they celebrated their 275th anniversary.\n\nHowever, Benedikte’s official work is not limited to the shores of Denmark. She has no less than ten overseas patronages. For instance, since 2001, she has been Patron of the Danish YMCA [Dansk KFUK] in London. Again, this role is especially poignant as Queen Ingrid previously held the position of Patron. The Princess has visited regularly, be it to open the Queen Ingrid’s Student Residence or to attend the annual Christmas Fayre or preside at the Centenary Celebrations. On the other side of the globe, Her Royal Highness is also Patron of The Princess Benedikte Institute (IPB), a non-profit civil association in Brazil which works with vulnerable children. In October 2019 she travelled to Curitiba, a city of around two million in the south, to inspect the organisations new headquarters which, in addition to administrative offices, also provides care and accommodation for around twenty children, up to the age of ten, who are awaiting court decisions on guardianship or adoption. These youngsters are often victims of mistreatment, sexual violence and or have serious impairments. The Institute also champions the rights of children and adolescents.\n\nFollowing the death of Prince Richard in March 2017, at the age of 82 (he was said to have been suffering from skin cancer), Benedikte’s son Prince Gustav took over the running of Berleburg Castle and the estate. Gustav was in a long-term relationship with Carina Axelsson and the couple would go on to marry in June 2022. A son, Gustav Albrecht was born in May 2023 in the United States to a surrogate mother with both parents present during the birth. He is Benedikte’s fifth grandchild.\n\nBenedikte was the first of the three Danish royal sisters to be widowed (Margrethe lost her husband Henrik the following year; while Anne-Marie’s husband, King Constantine died in January 2023). When not in Denmark, she again occupied the house in the grounds of Berleburg Castle where she had first lived following upon her marriage to Richard. The Princess has reflected on the fact that she had ‘a nice and happy marriage’ but has also conceded that for all her love of married life at beautiful Berleburg ‘if I had not also had Denmark and Copenhagen, it would have been more difficult for me, I think.’ It had certainly given her experience of living for spells on her own. Nonetheless, she naturally misses her husband greatly, especially being able to share some ‘fun experiences’ and to discuss things with.\n\nFor a period the Princess had been involved in breeding horses with her daughter Nathalie at Berleburg. The latter is a professional dressage rider and trainer who, until her divorce in 2022 was married to horse breeder Alexander Johannsmann. She has competed for Denmark in the Olympics, winning two bronze medals. Nathalie lives in the West Wing of Berleburg Castle with her children, Konstantin (born in 2010) and Louisa (2015). Benedikte has often dropped by for meals and to catch up with her grandchildren. She is particularly amused that Louisa has recently become interested in football; while Konstantin is a devotee of handball.\n\nMeanwhile, Princess Alexandra currently lives with her second husband Count Michael Ahlefeldt-Laurvig-Bille on his family estate at Egeskov Castle on the Danish island of Funen. The couple married in 2019. She has two children (by her first marriage to a German nobleman, Count Jefferson von Pfeil und Klein-Ellguth) Richard (born in 1999) and Ingrid (2003). Princess Benedikte is a frequent visitor to Egeskov and has spent Christmas there in recent times.\n\nAlthough the Princess intends to celebrate her birthday privately with family and friends, her diary has been busy over the past few weeks, as many of the organisations with which she is involved have sought to commemorate this milestone 80th birthday. On 19 April a birthday dinner was held at Sølyst in Klampenborg. Seventy guests attended and the event was organised by Friends of Dressage and the other equestrian organisations of which Benedikte is Patron. Then, a few days later, Her Royal Highness was guest-of-honour at a concert by the Saint Annæ Girls’ Choir who were celebrating their 50th anniversary. The Princess has a long-standing connection with the choir and was a treated to a selection of well-known Danish songs. However, the event which literally moved her to tears, was the opening of an exhibition, “Princess’ Dresses” at the Koldinghus Museum in Kolding, Jutland. Twenty of the Princess’ dresses were placed on show (including Benedikte’s wedding dress [over which she lingered for some time] and a maternity dress). Most of the costumes were designed by the Danish designer Jørgen Bender, who also counted Queen Ingrid and Queen Margrethe as esteemed clients. Her Royal Highness is the Honorary Custodian of Royal Danish Collection Koldinghus. Also attending the opening with her were Princess Benedikte’s cousin Count Ingolf of Rosenborg and his wife Countess Sussie.\n\nOn 2 May, Princess Benedikte will hold a reception in the Great Hall of Rosenborg Castle for representatives of the many Danish (and overseas) organisations with which she is affiliated. There is no sense of an easing of the pace and the Princess has recently appointed a new lady-in-waiting Countess Mette Ahlefeldt-Laurvig to help assist her as she undertakes official engagements. They both share a love for all things equestrian. This appointment is also a sure sign that the Princess intends to carry on with her royal duties. Indeed, in a recent interview with newspaper Billed Bladett, Benedikte indicates that she hopes that there is still a need for her to still participate in the royal round. Certainly, there is no indication that her nephew, King Frederik X, has any intentions of not allowing his beloved aunt to continue in her current role. Why would he? The Princess also revealed that she now lives permanently in Denmark in her apartment at Christian VIII Palace at Amalienborg. Benedikte’s Copenhagen home is filled ‘entirely of things that have been in my parents’ home’ and the Princess makes use of her late mother’s desk when undertaking her administrative tasks relating to her official life. She firmly believes that ‘You have a duty to take care of the furniture you have inherited.’ Of course, she will still return to Berleburg from time to time and she currently spends a month there in the summer, when there is a three-day festival on the estate. Up to 7,000 people attend and they can participate in clay pigeon shooting, dancing, listening to music and beer drinking.\n\nOn almost the eve of her 80th birthday, Princess Benedikte has been thrilled to learn that her daughter Nathalie has lately been ‘overwhelmingly’ elected to the board of the Danish Equestrian Federation. When making her representations for the post, Nathalie admitted that ‘I can get a little angry sometimes, it comes from my dad. But my diplomacy – I got that from my mother.’ Diplomatic skills are certainly useful for the daughter, sister and aunt of reigning Danish monarchs, past and present.\n\nAs she reflects on a long life well-lived, Princess Benedikte will draw strength from her Christian faith which she regards ‘as a firm ground to stand on.’ Although not a regular church goer, she admits to enjoying the services and ‘our lovely Danish hymns.’ She praises too the role of women priests and bishops today. They now make up the majority of the ordained priests in Denmark.\n\nAs one assesses the Princess long life, one is conscious of a life of devotion to family and to her homeland. Her sense of duty remains as strong as ever, as does her determination to undertake her duties to the best of her ability with a speech well-researched and written, the facts and the faces of the organisations she is visiting at her fingertips. Of the three sisters, it is in Benedikte that one sees so much of her highly-organised, well-dressed and demure mother Queen Ingrid. Certainly, Queen Margrethe has openly stated in an interview with Kristeligt Dagblad in 2019. that ‘Benedikte is really the most royal of us all.’ Happy Birthday Princess Benedikt and many more of them.\n\nIn late July 1941, Prince George, the Duke of Kent and youngest brother of King George VI commenced a six-week visit to Canada primarily, but not exclusively, to visit airfields which formed part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP). The scheme which drew personnel from Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand-and was expanded following the fall of France in June 1940-would ultimately be responsible for the training of an estimated 131,553 Allied aircrew. Most of the training was undertaken in Canada and required the building of new air bases or the upgrading of existing facilities throughout the Dominion. The scheme was administered by the Canadian government and Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) with input from the Royal Air Force (RAF). His Royal Highness was accompanied for much of the trip by his Private Secretary, Lieutenant John Lowther, as well as Flight Lieutenant P.J. Ferguson and Group Captain Sir Louis Greig. The latter was a courtier of many years standing, as well as a friend of King George VI. Greig was currently assigned to the Air Ministry. Also in the party were the Duke’s valet and a Scotland Yard detective, Inspector Evans. Wartime restrictions meant that Prince George was permitted to take only two suitcases and a haversack with him for the long trip. The Prince was no stranger to Canada having visited the Dominion with his eldest brother, the Prince of Wales in 1927 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of the Confederation of Canada. In addition, he had visited Canada alone (including Ottawa) in 1926 and is said to have paid another (private) visit in 1928.\n\nAccording to the diaries of the Canadian Premier, William Mackenzie-King, George VI himself was the driving force behind the visit, His Majesty being ‘quite decided’ on the matter. Indeed, the Canadian Prime Minister’s diary entry of 11 July states that the Governor-General of Canada, Lord Athlone, informed Mackenzie-King that ‘he thought the King himself had put it forward to give the boy something to do.’ Athlone opined too that ‘the British had approved the project but [he] thought that the suggestion should come from Canada.’ Mackenzie-King demurred and told Athlone (the youngest brother of Queen Mary and uncle of Prince George), that ‘if the Duke of Kent came we would, of course, welcome him cordially.’ Yet, he ‘did not feel, however, [that] I should make a suggestion..’ Ever the politician, Mackenzie-King ruminated that he would be bound to be asked questions as to ‘why I had invited him’ in the Canadian Parliament ‘and [he] did not feel’ that he ‘would be in a position to answer the question satisfactorily.’ More specifically, the reason for his lukewarm attitude towards the proposed visit was subsequently confided by Mackenzie-King to his diary on 17 July: ‘It looks to me like something cooked up between [the Canadian High Commissioner in London, Vincent] Massey and the Palace, something about which the Brit[ish] Govt. nor my own are particularly keen about.’ It must be mentioned that the Canadian Prime Minister was a complex character and his nose was undoubtedly put out-of-joint as a result of what he regarded as a lack of consultation with the government in Ottawa on the part of Buckingham Palace and of Vincent Massey. Even if such soundings had taken place, it is doubtful if Mackenzie-King would have been keen. Furthermore, there was another major factor in the equation, something which indubitably upset Mackenzie-King’s equilibrium: the Duke of Windsor (the former King Edward VIII, eldest brother of Prince George and now Governor of the Bahamas) had also recently made a request to visit Canada, where he owned a ranch in Alberta. The Canadian Prime Minister informed the British High Commissioner in Ottawa, Malcolm MacDonald, that he rather wished that the Duke of Windsor should not come at all but, if he did, Mackenzie-King reasoned that ‘they [the two royal dukes] certainly should not be here at the same time’ as ‘this would give rise to many questionings and might give rise to serious embarrassment.’ Fortunately, the visits of both royalties were scheduled so that they did not overlap. After meeting and entertaining the Duke of Kent following his arrival, the Canadian Prime Minister then planned to take himself off to England for a visit with Winston Churchill and to pay his respects to Queen Mary at Badminton.\n\nMeanwhile, when the tour was announced to the public around 23 July, the British press were casting all such political and court machinations to the side and wrote that His Royal Highness had ‘volunteered’ to make the trip. Prince George and his party flew overnight from Prestwick Airport in Scotland to Rockcliffe Airport, Ottawa in an eighteen-ton Consolidated Liberator Mark I bomber, AM261, of Royal Air Force Ferry Command, arriving at around 10am on 29 July (after a brief stopover in Montreal for breakfast). The flight had taken over fifteen hours and there was little room to lie down or even to stretch one’s legs. The royal visitor was welcomed at Rockcliffe by the Governor-General and the Prime Minister. During a conversation over lunch at the Governor-General’s residence, His Royal Highness admitted to Mackenzie-King that the air journey had been cold and uncomfortable. The Duke joked that although he had been given an electrically heated flying suit, there had been no where to plug it in! The Canadian premier, meanwhile, thought Prince George appeared, ‘pretty tired and nervous.’ For their part, the Canadian press were impressed that the Duke was the first member of the British Royal Family to make a transatlantic flight. They did question him on the possibility of a visit to the United States but Prince George admitted, ‘I am not sure..’ but left the possibility open. The British press, meanwhile, also unhelpfully mentioned that the former King Edward VIII and his youngest surviving brother might meet in Canada.\n\nWhilst in Ottawa, Prince George stayed with his “Uncle Alge” [the family name for Lord Athlone] and his wife “Aunt Alice” [Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, the redoubtable granddaughter of the late Queen/Empress Victoria] at Rideau Hall, the Governor-General’s official residence. Also present in the happy family group were the Athlone’s daughter (and the Prince’s first cousin) Lady May Abel Smith accompanied by her children who were also currently living in Ottawa.\n\nOn the evening of 30 July, an official dinner (described by the British press as a ‘State Dinner’) of welcome, attended by seventy guests, was held by the Canadian government in Prince George’s honour at the Country Club in Ottawa. Mackenzie-King was seated between His Royal Highness and the Earl of Athlone and complained that neither was ‘easy to talk to.’ Earlier that day, the Duke had visited the Headquarters of the Royal Canadian Air Force, travelling through the crowd-lined streets of the Canadian capital in his official Buick with police outriders in attendance. Prince George ensured that he waved to the onlookers and this drew sporadic cheers from the “side walks”.\n\nThe following day, Prince George was also able to watch a group of Australian and Canadian pilots as they trained at The Royal Canadian Air Force [RCAF] No.2 Service Flying Training School at nearby Uplands. The visit lasted nearly four hours and the Chief of the Air Staff personally greeted the royal visitor, as did a Royal Canadian Air Force Band who provided the Royal Salute, followed by a rendition of “The Thin Red Line”, during which His Royal Highness inspected the Guard of Honour. The Duke then toured the Motor Transport Section, the NCO’s quarters and mess, the swimming pool, the hospital, the airmen’s mess and a barrack’s block. He later had drinks in the officer’s mess before lunching in the dining room. Prince George was placed at the centre of the top table. His Royal Highness subsequently toured the Ground School, the aircraft hangers and the control tower. Each of the airman or ground staff with whom the royal visitor spoke was asked their name, how long they had been in the services, and if they were enjoying their work. Some of the airmen were also questioned about night flying. While earlier reviewing the Guard of Honour, His Royal Highness’ sympathy went out the men who were clad in the heavy regulation uniforms. He paused by Aircraftsman J.E.R. Nadon and asked, “Are those uniforms hot?” Nadon is reported to have replied, “Not too bad sir.” On departing, Prince George mentioned to his Canadian hosts that he had, been ‘impressed by the efficiency of the [Uplands] Maintenance Squadron’. That same day, he also made a tour of RCAF Rockcliffe, going through much the same schedule as at the Uplands airbase. The combined tour of both of these bases amounted to seven hours in total. In the evening, an official dinner was hosted by Lord Athlone at Rideau Hall.\n\nOn 1 August, after touring the Gatineau Hills, the Duke was able to watch summer air manoeuvres by some of the many trainee pilots he had previously met at Uplands and Rockcliffe. The trainee pilots were apparently ‘picking up flying time lost during last two weeks’. The latter may have been partly due to the shooting of a Hollywood “movie” by Warner Brothers at nearby Pendleton Relief Field. This included several flying sequences, including one involving an impressive thirty-six aircraft. In the evening, the Duke enjoyed a picnic supper, with Mackenzie-King as host, during a visit to the Prime Minister’s private estate at Kingsmere Lake.\n\nOn 2 August, Prince George flew southwards to inspect RCAF Trenton, the largest air facility in eastern Canada and home to No. 1 Composite Training School [No. 1 KTS]. He was introduced to participants of the Aircrew Squadron and Disciplinarians Course. Thereafter, the Duke flew on to make an afternoon inspection of the No.1 Service Flying Training School [SFTS] at Camp Borden, said to be ‘the birthplace’ of the Royal Canadian Air Force. Scores of training planes were on the tarmac as he arrived. He ‘toured the various units’ before enduring yet another “meet and greet” session in the officer’s mess. But it was not only air force personnel: His Royal Highness also met men of the Canadian Armored Division, most of whom had given up there weekend leave to meet the royal visitor. On 3 August, after attending a Sunday morning church service with the Athlone’s, the Duke of Kent flew out from Ottawa to Winnipeg ‘on the first lap of the western section of his tour’. Mackenzie-King, confided to his diary that ‘I think the Duke’s visit, as far as Ottawa is concerned, has gone off very well.’ Praise indeed! The Prince landed at Stevenson Airport, Winnipeg and proceeded to Government House to spend the night. ‘Several hundred spectators’ lined the route of the motorcade. His Royal Highness was entertained to dinner by the Lieutenant-Governor and Mrs McWilliams. It was also at this juncture that it was announced that His Royal Highness would travel to the United States on 23 August to visit President Roosevelt at his private country estate.\n\nOn 4 August, a day of high winds which curtailed many training flights, the Duke flew from Winnipeg to Regina, Saskatchewan to pay what the press described as ‘an unexpected visit’ to No.15 Elementary Flying Training School [EFTS]. The stopover was brief, lasting merely 45 minutes. Nevertheless, a guard of honour was hastily arranged (and duly inspected) and the Duke also found time meet ‘civil leaders’ and talk with a group of Americans who had enrolled in the Royal Canadian Air Force. That same day, the Duke and his party flew into RCAF Calgary (Lincoln Park) home of No. 3 Service Flying Training School, where the local Mayor was introduced to His Royal Highness. One hundred and four men stood to attention as the Royal Salute was played and the Duke made time to speak to many as he passed down the line. Prince George later visited the nearby No. 2 Wireless School [WS], travelling through the city centre in a sedan car. At the School he was greeted by a guard of honour and two Royal Canadian Mounted Police astride their horses. The station diary notes that the Duke made a thorough visit of the station hospital where he insisted on speaking to each of the patients about their ailments. He also toured the classrooms and seemed keen to listen in as the students received instruction and later questioned many of them about their experiences. As was often his custom throughout the tour, Prince George then ventured up to the third floor canteen to meet briefly with some of the diners, for he was concerned about the variety of the daily fare on offer and as to whether the portions were sufficient. He asked for copy of the menu and inspected a large walk-in refrigerator filled with fresh meat. The Duke also had an interesting encounter with a Welshman, Harry Jones. While serving as a driver in the army, he had chauffeured Prince George’s great-uncle, the Duke of Connaught and the Duke of Windsor (when Prince of Wales) during their trips to Canada. After a visit to the officers’ mess, the royal party departed Calgary by car for a few days rest at Banff.\n\nEach morning in the mountain resort of Banff, the Duke rose early to enjoy a ten-minute swim before breakfasting with his entourage in the Royal Suite of the Banff Springs Hotel. Whenever he had a spare moment, he would enjoying cantering on a bay horse along the local mountain trails (some press reports state he rode for a distance of around ten miles). On 5 August, Prince George spent many hours ascending nearby 8,000-foot Sulphur Mountain. He took with him a simple picnic lunch of hard boiled eggs and cold meats. The following day he climbed the more demanding 9000-foot Rundle Mountain, in just over six hours, in the company of his detective, Inspector Evans. One of the Duke’s drivers, AC J.S. Botterill, commented on his ‘vitality-I never saw anything like it in my life, so help me.’ Whilst staying at Banff he was also introduced to two members of the indigenous First Nation community, Chief Charlie Bear Paw and Chef Waving Feather. Before leaving the resort at 8am on the morning of 7 August, Prince George thanked Charlie Lambe, who had been his personal waiter and gave him a gift of cufflinks bearing his cipher. Mr Lambe knew the Duke from his time working at Ciro’s night club in London. It was at this juncture that His Royal Highness learned that his friend and ADC, Wing Commander Whitney Straight had been shot down over France. He would later end up in prisoner-of-war camp from which he escaped in June 1942. Meanwhile, the British press commented that there was ‘no plan’ for a meeting between the Duke of Kent and his eldest brother.\n\nThe royal trip was by now attracting attention back home in Britain and the London Illustrated News ran a special pictorial feature; while the Newcastle Journal headlined ‘the Duke of Kent in Canada in Colour’ in large capital letters. Meanwhile, the Duke drove himself in a large Lincoln automobile from Banff back to Calgary, from where he subsequently flew to Vancouver and spent an hour inspecting facilities at the airport. Thereafter, it was onwards to Vancouver Island where he toured the RCAF base at Patricia Bay (home to 32 Operational Training Unit). The OTU, as it was referred to, was the ‘last stop’ for aircraft crew in their training protocol. The Duke was greeted by the Lieutenant-Governor, Mr Eric Hamber and a crowd of onlookers, estimated at 3,500. A guard of honour of one hundred airmen were drawn up on the runway for inspection. Prince George and the Lieutenant-Governor would later motor down Vancouver Island to the city of Victoria, a distance of some eighteen miles, where the Duke dined and spent the night at Government House.\n\nNaturally, Prince George could not make a visit to Vancouver Island’s historical capital without a tour of the imposing Parliament House, so next morning he drove there and was met by the State Premier, T.D. Patullo and other local politicians. Later, His Royal Highness had a meeting with Major General Ronald Alexander, General Officer Commanding, Pacific Command at his headquarters at Esquimalt Fortress. His Royal Highness also visited Western Air Command (RCAF) and subsequently lunched with the Commander, Air Commodore A. E. Godfrey at the Union Club. The Lieutenant-Governor and the heads of other branches of the military were also present. Prince George then toured a barracks of the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) at the naval base at Esquimalt and later watched an army ‘formation’ display by ‘young militiamen’ at Work Point military camp. In the evening, after dining at Government House, the Duke returned to RCAF Patricia Bay and flew over to Vancouver where he and his entourage stayed privately at “Shannon” the home of Major and Mrs Austin Taylor.\n\nOn 9 August, the Duke drove to Richmond, just south of the city of Vancouver, to tour the Boeing aircraft plant, as well as to visit RCAF Station Sea Island, the location for No. 8 Elementary Flying Training School which made use of Tiger Moth aircraft. According to the station diary, “Air Commodore Kent”, inspected both trainees and flying instructors, before ‘thoroughly’ touring the air station.\n\nThereafter, Prince George and his party undertook an afternoon tour of Burrard Dry Dock where Bangor Class Minesweepers were being built for the Royal Canadian Navy. His Royal Highness also toured the neighbouring North Van Ship Repairs Yard, which had just been re-tooled so as to construct minesweepers, at the behest of the Canadian government. Three new launch ways had recently been built at this site and the Duke was given ample opportunity to inspect the facilities. It is clear from local photo archives that His Royal Highness made time to speak to many of the shipyard workers, as well as some war veterans from World War I. It so happened that the Prince was keen on naval history (having previously served in the Royal Navy as a midshipman) and he was Patron of the Society for Nautical Research. Prince George also met with patients at the Shaughnessy Military Hospital in Oak Street. He was particularly moved to speak to Percy Hart (described as an ‘old timer’ in the Vancouver Sun), who had been hospitalised there with arthritis since 1923. Indeed, he had been a patient when Prince George last visited the hospital with the then Prince of Wales in 1927. News of his visit soon reached locals and as he prepared to depart in his open-topped official limousine, he was surrounded by a large crowd.\n\nThe Prince then commenced his journey towards Edmonton by train that evening. En route he again enjoyed at stopover for a couple of days, this time at Jasper National Park, where he dined privately in his private mountain lodge with Charles E Hughes, a retired Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court. The Duke also swam regularly in Lake Beauvert and indulged in some climbing. On finally reaching Edmonton by rail on 13 August, the Duke was cheered by thousands as the royal motorcade advanced through the streets of Alberta’s capital city. The welcome was described in the station diary of RCAF Edmonton as the ‘ the most spontaneous and enthusiastic greeting yet received on the tour.’ The Duke first visited the No. 2 Air Observer Corps [AOS] where he toured classrooms at the Radio Technical School. He then inspected No. 16 Elementary Flying Training School where, after signing the register in the Administration Building, he spent a considerable time watching the trainee pilots taking off and landing. Prince George also asked questions of officers, trainee pilots, mechanics and other ground staff during a subsequent tour of the radio room, the hangars and the officers’ mess. His Royal Highness was then introduced to Mr Thomas Bull, a veteran of the Great War. Interestingly, Mr Bull had at one time helped with the construction of a summer house in the garden at Windsor Castle and he was keen to know if the building was still standing. The Duke was pleased to confirm that this was indeed the case, it currently being used by the King and Queen. On departing, His Royal Highness praised the ‘speedy expansion’ of the Air Training Plan.\n\nOn the morning of 14 August, the Duke paid a visit to RCAF Medicine Hat, Alberta (home of No. 34 Service Flying Training School). Many of the men at this air station came from Britain. Somewhat unusually, he first attended a Civic Reception in the Town Hall before making a ‘thorough’ inspection of the guard of honour of one hundred airmen. The station diary keeper notes that His Royal Highness made time to speak to around twenty-five of the Guard. Starting his tour in the “Station Sick Quarters”, Prince George’s tour of inspection encompassed ‘practically every building.’ Prior to taking lunch in the Officer’s Mess, the Prince was happy to pose with many of the airmen to have pictures taken. Lieutenant Lowther later wrote a letter of thanks to the Commanding Officer, Group Captain Ellis, stating that ‘His Royal Highness was greatly impressed with all he saw..’ and sent ‘his warmest congratulations on the efficiency of No. 34 Service Flying Training School.’ It was just the sort of morale boost that was needed.\n\nIn the afternoon, His Royal Highness flew in his Lockheed-Hudson aircraft to No. 32 Service Flying Training School at Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. The facility had recently been expanded to enable the Allied airmen to spend around sixteen weeks learning to fly Harvard and Oxford aircraft. Once again a large proportion of the trainees hailed from Britain and the local Leader-Post newspaper described the air station as ‘a little bit of Britain transplanted to the broad Canadian prairies.’ There was also a contingent of trainee pilots from Norway. The Duke was entranced by all he saw and spent a ‘considerable’ time up in the ‘watch tower’ watching planes as they landed and took off. This was also the perfect viewpoint to watch the excavation work currently being undertaken to further extend the runways. Prince George later visited the No. I Aircraft Hangar, the Ground Instructional Block, a barracks, drill hall and the station hospital, where he spoke to many of the patients. Word of the royal visit had clearly reached the local population and His Royal Highness went over to speak to a crowd of two hundred onlookers who had gathered outside the air station boundary fence. The Prince subsequently took tea in the officer’s mess where he was formally introduced to the Mayor of Moose Jaw, Mr Corman and the Town Clerk, Mr Craven. The party then left for RCAF Regina (his second visit) where he landed at 7.30pm and spent the night at Government House. During this brief stopover, His Royal Highness was able to meet up with Flight Lieutenant Robert Leavitt, who had spent a week, in May 1940, piloting the Duke in his Hudson aircraft over the north of France. Leavitt had only recently been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for undertaking dangerous reconnaissance work over Norway.\n\nOn 15 August, the Duke left RCAF Regina at 9.30am to fly to the No. 12 Service Flying Training School located at RCAF Brandon. The royal party arrived in good weather at 11am prompt. No guard of honour was deemed necessary. Nonetheless, the diary of the air station shows His Royal Highness was still expected to inspect fifty ‘Security Guards’. He subsequently toured the maintenance hangar and the hospital (stopping to ask each patient the reason for their stay and what post they were training for). The Duke then paid a visit to the officer’s mess to to enjoy an ‘informal’ lunch. By 13.30 he had departed to inspect the No. 2 Manning Depot for new recruits located nearby. The royal visitor was determined to be thorough and spent an hour touring the barracks, the athletic grounds and watching a demonstration of the different stages in the training of raw recruits, be it in rifle drill, foot drill, marching or saluting. The royal visitors then returned to the main Brandon airfield to fly eastwards to RCAF Carberry, home of No. 33 Service Flying Training School to make a ‘surprise’ visit and participate in the ‘great event’ of the day, the “Wings Parade” at which the sixty-three Graduate-Pilots of the out-going course received their flying badges. Although this visit was a brief one, Prince George insisted on pinning the Emblem on each of the graduates.\n\nThe Prince next progressed to RCAF Winnipeg (less than two weeks after his previous visit to the airfield) the home of No. 5 Observer Corps (OC) and temporary home to No. 14 Elementary Flying Training School. The Duke was asked to present the Starratt Memorial Trophy to the most outstanding trainee of air observers, LAC E.K. Campbell. The latter was also presented with a ‘navigational watch.’ In addition, Prince George met with the other trainees, instructors and officers. The royal party then progressed to No. 8 Repair Depot to view a group of mechanics and engineers at work. Thereafter, the Duke was introduced to civilian pilots attached to the Winnipeg Air Observer School Ltd. His Royal Highness also made a brief speech which was mentioned in the British newspapers, ‘I did not expect the [air training] scheme to be so impressive.’ Apparently, it was already ‘twenty-per-cent more advanced than those in charge hoped for.’ He added enthusiastically, ‘I shall have much to tell them in England.’ Finally, His Royal Highness visited MacDonald Brothers Aircraft factory. MacDonald’s built many of the training aircraft used by the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, including the Avro Avian. The company also undertook airplane repairs on other wartime models such as the Tiger Moth. At the end of what had been a very busy day, the Duke met with members of the Polish Community at Government House, Winnipeg. He was also introduced to a delegation from the Czech-Slovak Military Mission to Canada, who were on a recruiting mission on behalf of the RAF. Many Czechoslovak airmen would subsequently fly for the Allies.\n\nThereafter, the Duke enjoyed a few days free of duties at the summer home of the late E W Kneeland, a wealthy Winnipeg grain merchant, at Lake of the Woods Island near Kenora, Northern Ontario. He then travelled, early on the morning of 19th August, to pay a visit to the RCAF Fort William, home of No. 2 Elementary Flying School, where he inspected the new barracks block, viewed the recreation room and even toured several storage buildings. Subsequently, Prince George visited the production line of Canadian Car & Foundry which was situated close-by. The plant built Hawker Hurricane aircraft including the Sea Hurricane, which the press described as a ‘navalised version’ of the Hurricane. The royal visitor was pictured for posterity talking to both men and women on the assembly line. This sent out an important message to the world, as women were now increasingly in war production in Canada, the United States and in Britain too. Thereafter, the royal party made a tour of the shipbuilding yard in the neighbouring town of Port Arthur.\n\nThe Duke of Kent travelled to Timmins by air on the morning of 20 August (where he was greeted by crowds estimated to be in the thousands and spent an hour 4,000 feet down a gold mine). He subsequently flew four hundred miles southwards to Toronto, where he made a visit to the original “Little Norway”, a training camp and school for expatriate Norwegian airmen then situated at Toronto’s small island airport on Lake Ontario. Prince George later dined with the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario and Mrs Matthews in the Vice-Regal Chambers of Parliament House. Next morning, His Royal Highness paid a ninety-minute visit to the John Inglis munitions plant where he was pictured inspecting a Bren gun (the plant was one of the main producers of this item). He also paid a visit to No. 1 Initial Training School of the RCAF at Eglinton in nearby Scarborough where, in addition to speaking to flying officers, the Prince inspected the kitchen and spoke to the chef about culinary matters, once again demonstrating his concern for the welfare of those serving in the military. There was also rumoured to be a secret RCAF research facility at this site, though whether Prince George visited that establishment remains unclear. In addition, the Duke made a visit to the De Havilland aircraft factory at Downsview Park, Toronto where the legendary Tiger Moth training plane was constructed, as was the twin-engine Mosquito combat aircraft. Both these aeroplanes were vital to the success of the Allied cause and this morale-boosting visit was just what was required.\n\nOn 22 August, the Duke of Kent was present at the opening of the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto. He made a speech to those attending in which he stated that ‘We are determined and confident that these temporary clouds shall pass and that much better days are to come for all classes of people. The knowledge that Canada is producing an ever-increasing volume of necessary weapons of war is a constant inspiration to the never-flagging courage of our people.’ At this time, Prince George also visited No.1 Manning Depot for RCAF trainees which was located on the National Exhibition site: He spoke to one of the workers in the YMCA canteen, a Mrs J. H. Domine about her work and conditions.\n\nThe following day, the royal entourage visited RCAF Oshawa, to open the No. 20 Elementary Flying Training School. The Duke, according to the station diary, was taken to a reviewing stand at the Parade Square and after speaking to officials, he was asked to declare the flying school ‘open’ which he duly did in a ‘short but well-delivered speech.’ Thereafter, he inspected the ‘pupil-pilots’ and their instructors, expressing his ‘admiration for the appearance of all ranks.’ Prince George then viewed motorised military equipment currently being produced at the General Motors Company plant nearby. Whilst there, he again had the chance to meet a group of military veterans. He later returned to RCAF Oshawa to change into civilian dress for his flight to La Guardia Airport in New York. Before departing, the Duke presented his chauffeur for the last few days in Toronto area, Sergeant Earl Baxter, with a pair of cufflinks bearing his distinctive royal cypher. Kind touches such as these did not go unnoticed.\n\nAfter a brief stopover in New York, where no less than two hundred patrolmen, detectives and traffic police had been assigned to secure the royal party’s route through the city, the royal motorcade proceeded ‘upstate’ towards President and Mrs Roosevelt private Springwood estate, at Hyde Park, situated on the eastern shore of the Hudson River, some four miles north of Poughkeepsie. The Duke arrived just in time for dinner that evening. As the Duke confided to waiting reporters at La Guardia, this was the first time he had met the President since a previous encounter in the Bahamas in 1934 when he and his wife, Princess Marina, were on their honeymoon. On Sunday, the Prince’s host took his guest on a tour-the press described it as a ‘preview’-of the newly-completed Franklyn Roosevelt Library. The President was keen to ensure that his royal visitor viewed an eclectic selection of the items on display-mostly statues and art work-for this inaugural exhibition at the Library. Further ‘highlights’ included the chance for a royal dip in the Roosevelt’s private swimming pool up and being driven by Roosevelt in his specially-adapted car on a tour around the two-hundred-acre estate. In the evening, the Duke and the President travelled by ‘special train’ overnight to Washington D.C., arriving at Union Station the morning of Monday, 25 August. The Duke and his party then flew immediately down to Virginia from Anacosta air station, visiting an operational unit at Langley Air Force Base, as well as touring the Navy Yard at Norfolk (‘the most important naval centre on the Atlantic seaboard’) which was currently being expanded to better supply the combat ships that were required. At the latter the Duke was greeted in person by Admiral Manley H. Simons, District Commander of the 5th Naval District and cheered by workmen as he progressed through the yard. There was a visit too to Newport News Shipyard which specialised in the construction of aircraft carriers. His Royal Highness returned to Washington to spend an overnight at the White House. A dinner was held in Prince George’s honour (attended by eighteen guests who included his kinsman, Dickie Mountbatten, his wife Edwina and Harry Hopkins, who frequently travelled to Britain as Roosevelt’s “envoy”). That the President and the Duke of Kent had managed to spend some “quality” time together was seen as advantageous to the British cause, for with the United States not yet having entered the Second World War, the King and Churchill had been particularly anxious to sustain the “special relationship” between Britain and its long-time ally.\n\nMeanwhile, Mrs Roosevelt had confided to the press that the Prince, like his brother King George VI, ‘was very shy and thoughtful.’ Nevertheless, His Royal Highness remained determined to raise Britain’s profile in wartime in the States: The following morning he was given the ideal opportunity: After a brief tour of the Presidential mansion and West Wing, the Duke paid a visit to the National Press Club where he made an upbeat speech underlining his confidence in an Allied victory. He emphasised that ‘the more material aid the United States furnishes, the quicker Britain will win’ adding that morale in his homeland ‘was good’. On a lighter note, His Royal Highness teased his American hosts that he had not seen an orange or a banana for months until his recent arrival in Canada.\n\nPrince George subsequently visited Baltimore, on 26 August, the home town of the Duke’s sister-in-law, Wallis Warfield (whom the local Mayor insisted on calling “Our Wally”). His Royal Highness inspected bombers being built for the Royal Air Force at the Glenn L. Martin Aircraft Plant. Again, this factory had recently been enlarged due to the Allies desperate need of combat aircraft, such as the A-22 Maryland Bomber. During the visit, the Duke addressed some of the 13,000 workers at the plant and imparted another rousing, patriotic message, ‘You are playing a vital part in our fight. Every hour you work not only saves the lives of our men, women, and children, but brings victory nearer.’ Before leaving, His Royal Highness was introduced to one hundred and fifty officers of the British Merchant Navy. He also inspected Canadian troops at nearby Camp Holabird. Tom Hanes, an American journalist was allowed to accompany the Duke throughout the Baltimore visit and described him as ‘just another good guy…who is trying his level best to handle a tough job.’ Hanes asked Prince George for his views on the current American defence effort: ‘Marvellous. The spirit is wonderful. Please say for me that we deeply appreciate the tremendous accomplishments of American industry.’ The journalist noted that the royal visitor was drinking bourbon and the Prince admitted he did not care for “Scotch”. However, he had praise indeed for American journalists, feeling that they ‘ have given me quite friendly treatment…They’re fine fellows.’ A deft public relations treat on the part of the Duke!\n\nOn 27 August, Prince George returned to Canada to visit Hamilton, Ontario, where he was greeted by cheering crowds as he visited Westinghouse’s Electric Plant. Originally a small appliance factory, the facility had been re-tooled and expanded to produce anti-aircraft guns and other components, including many for the Mosquito Bomber. In the afternoon, he paid a visit to RCAF Hamilton (Mount Hope) and spent an hour reviewing No. 10 Elementary Flying Training School. He ended the day by inspecting and subsequently spending an overnight at RCAF Jarvis, the Ontario home of No.1 Bombing and Gunnery School, close-by the north shore of Lake Erie. Meanwhile, at Badminton in Gloucestershire, the home of the Duke of Beaufort, and temporary wartime residence of Queen Mary, Mackenzie-King was quizzed by the Dowager Queen about the Duke’s visit. Her Majesty had been following her youngest surviving son’s trip with great interest and showed the Canadian Prime Minister a selection of newspaper clippings, including one of Prince George at Rideau Hall with the Athlone’s. Mackenzie-King enthused that ‘some very fine movies’ had been made of the royal tour, although he also divulged that the Duke of Kent had informed him ‘that he never liked to see himself in a movie.’\n\nOn 28 August Prince George was photographed with John Mack from Britain as he toured a No. 1 Technical Training School at RCAF St Thomas, near London, south-eastern Ontario. The site had a capacity to train up to 2,000 men at a time to work as skilled ground crew. The following day, His Royal Highness made an ‘unexpected visit’ to RCAF Cap de la Madeleine, the home of No. 11 Elementary Flying School. The Duke’s plane hade been forced to land here due to poor visibility. The air station diary notes: ‘Unfortunately for us the royal visitor had to be rushed to the [train] station at Three Rivers to catch the Quebec train [for onward travel by air to St Hubert aerodrome, Montreal]. Consequently he didn’t have time to visit our school.’\n\nWhen the Duke landed at St Hubert aerodrome it was already twilight. So began his forty-hour visit to Canada’s (then) largest city. A motorcycle escort accompanied his official car, flying the Ducal standard, to Montreal’s City Hall where His Royal Highness signed the city’s famous Golden Book and was guest of honour at an evening reception (presided over by the Mayor, Monsieur Adhemar Raynault and attended by ‘high military and civic dignitaries’.) Monsieur Raynault praised the royal visitor to the local press on his ‘very fluent French’, as well as on his interest in matters pertaining to French Canada. That evening, Prince George spent the night at the aptly-named Windsor Hotel, where five hundred people crowded the hotel lobby in order to try and catch a glimpse of the royal visitor as he entered (a further 2,500 were also waiting outside so the Duke waved from a window of his suite to acknowledge their cheers). Meanwhile, the Montreal Gazette revealed that traffic around the hotel had been ‘rerouted lest it rouse Duke’. The following day, 29 August, was packed with engagements including a visit to No. 1 Wireless School at RCAF Montreal (currently housed in what had been the Nazareth School for the Blind) where the Duke was introduced to a large group of Australian and New Zealand airmen. Prince George also toured the classrooms and later lunched in the officers’ mess. During a tour of the canteen, he asked a member of staff how much beer and ale was being sold. The royal visitor then moved on to visit the huge Canadian Pacific Railway manufacturing and repair facility, known as Angus Shops. This depot-which was set over 1200 acres-was also now used to produce Valentine tanks for the war effort. His Royal Highness also paid a visit to Ferry Command: this Montreal-based organisation, operating out of RCAF Lachine (Dorval), made use of civilian pilots to deliver thousands of bombers built in Canada and the United States, fresh off the production line, to Britain during its darkest hour. Many of the transatlantic routes used by the crews (who also included trained navigators and radio operators) were new and experimental as the airmen learned to cope with dangerous conditions such as fog, blinding rain and heavy turbulence. His Royal Highness also visited the Fairchild Aviation aircraft at Longueuil, Quebec (where the Fairchild PT-19 training aircraft were being built). A selection of eleven different types of plane built in Canada were available for His Royal Highness to inspect. The Duke then made time to visit the look-out at the top of Mount Royal, where he viewed a monument erected to commemorate the visit of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in May 1939. A tea was held in the nearby “chalet” which was attended by city councillors and Mayor’s of some of the neighbouring municipalities adjoining the City of Montreal. Indeed, the Duke shook hands with ‘scores of the cities leading citizens’ during the one-hour reception. Prior to departing, the royal visitor reviewed a large contingent of air cadets and complimented them on their ‘smart appearance.’ The Ottawa Citizen newspaper revealed that as a kindness to His Royal Highness, a Montreal department store, Henry Morgan and Company, opened specially ‘after hours’ to allow the Duke to do some shopping which included the purchasing of some fountain pens. Not surprising given that the press described this day in Montreal as ‘the busiest day of his Canadian tour.’\n\nThe Prince departed St Hubert airport at 11am prompt on 30 August in a Grumman Goose amphibian aircraft for the town of Sorel, in south-western Quebec, where he toured Sorel Industries. This company was currently ‘turning out 25-pound field guns’ for the British Army. This was followed by a visit to the town’s Marine Industries which was involved in the construction of small warships (Corvettes) as well as the building of the largest all-welded vessel ever built in Canada. The New York Times revealed that Prince George was thereafter enjoying a brief sojourn at the fashionable Quebec holiday resort of Murray Bay, east of Quebec city. He was actually staying at Saint-Irénée-Les-Bains at the turreted chateau of Mr Pierre Francois Casgrain, a former Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons. For some of his time here, the went for a ‘canter’ along the Hotel Manoir Richelieu’s bridal path. On another occasion, he enjoyed a post-prandial four-hour, fifteen mile hike through local woodlands with the faithful Inspector Evans at his side. Nor was the Duke’s downtime carefree as back in London, his wife, Princess Marina, was undergoing ‘minor eye surgery’ and had cancelled her engagements for the next two-weeks.\n\nOn 2 September the Prince had resumed his tour, departing Lake St Agnes in his sea-plane for a tour of the Maritimes and an examination of eastern seaboard defences. The royal party first travelled to New Brunswick for a two-hour visit to No 8 Service Flying Training School, Moncton. This included a reception, a lunch with the officers, followed by ‘an Inspection of the Station.’ Later that afternoon, Prince George and his party flew over the Northumberland Strait to RCAF Summerside, on Prince Edward Island. This was the home base of the No. 9 Service Flying Training School. The Duke was there to inspect the new No. 2 runway. However, 70mph winds led to his Grumman aircraft having to land on a field of grass in the centre of the aerodrome, rather than on the new runway. Subsequently, His Royal Highness took tea in the officer’s mess and met members of the ‘permanent staff.’ Then, as the winds remained fierce, it was decided that Prince George would travel by car, rather than by plane, to his next engagement at RCAF Charlottetown (also on Prince Edward Island). This change in mode of transport meant that he was one-and-a-half hours late for his next engagement. This was somewhat unfortunate as Members of the Provincial government were kept waiting, as was the Lieutenant-Governor, Mr Le Page and the Commanding Officer Eastern Air Command, Air Commodore Anderson. Charlottetown was the home of No. 32 (Royal Air Force) Air Navigation School (ANS), as well as the No. 31 School of General Reconnaissance. The Duke was particularly interested in the work being undertaken there and in the equipment being used.\n\nOn 3 and 4 September, the Duke of Kent visited Halifax, Nova Scotia where he toured the RCAF facilities at Eastern Passage (east of Dartmouth), the headquarters of Eastern Air Command. He met a group of Canadian air force pilots who had recently returned from manoeuvres in England, as well as airmen who served in the Royal Air Force and the Fleet Air Arm. Most of these individuals had been involved in recent the Battle of Britain. The Prince also took the salute during a flypast and presented a new insignia to the No. 5 Squadron (featuring a gannet) at its base, RCAF Dartmouth. This squadron specialised in anti-submarine activities. In the evening, the royal party were entertained to dinner by the government of Nova Scotia. Next day, His Royal Highness inspected the “Stad”, as the local naval barracks were often referred to (official name HMCS Stadacona) and he also toured the naval dockyard. In the afternoon, Prince George departed Halifax and flew to the city of Quebec, landing in the harbour in his amphibious plane. He then drove to The Citadel, the Governor-General’s residence in Quebec City, where he was again entertained by his Uncle Alge and Aunt Alice. After attending yet another official dinner, the Duke rose early the following day to a packed schedule with six hours of engagements during which His Royal Highness visited an arsenal, before moving on to the No. 4 Manning Depot [RCAF] where he chatted to an aircraftsman in the barber shop. He also toured the depot medical clinic and spoke around a dozen patients. After lunching with the Depot Commander, the royal party made a a tour of the Valcartier Camp-some twenty miles distant-home of the Canadian Infantry Training Centre. The Duke also caught up with correspondence and wrote a letter of thanks from the Citadel in his own hand to Mrs Roosevelt ‘for all your kindness and hospitality during my visit to the USA.’ The Prince had ‘enjoyed my visit to Washington so much, I only wish it could have been longer.’ He was returning home ‘next week full of wonderful impressions of what is being done over here to help our cause.’ Thereafter, on 7 September His Royal Highness enjoyed an afternoon of culture when he accompanied his Uncle Alge and Aunt Alice on a visit to the Museum of the Province of Quebec. In the evening, the trio were guests at a dinner given by the Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec, Major-General Sir Eugene Fiset at his official residence, Spencerwood.\n\nThe Duke subsequently broadcast over the radio, mostly in English, but with a portion in French, on the evening of 9 September, prior to leaving Quebec City en route to Newfoundland the following morning. Prince George said that ‘the inspiration I have received from these few weeks among you gives me additional confidence in leaving your shores..’ He also praised the ‘remarkable achievements of the Commonwealth Air Training Scheme in Canada.’ His Royal Highness also mentioned his brief visit to the United States and opined that out of the war would surely be ‘born a closer friendship and unanimity among people who spoke a common tongue.’\n\nOn 12 September the Duke of Kent flew into Newfoundland’s Bay Bulls Big Pond from Sydney, Nova Scotia in a flying boat accompanied by two escort planes. He was due to have arrived on 10 September but was delayed, yet again, by the inclement weather. During his unscheduled time in Nova Scotia, Prince George toured a steel plant in Sydney which was involved in the production of war materials. He was also able to learn of the anti-submarine operations being conducted out of RCAF Sydney. In Newfoundland, His Royal Highness was greeted by a Guard of Honour from the Newfoundland Militia and lunched with the Governor (Newfoundland was at this stage not part of the Dominion of Canada and was proud to describe itself as the “Old Colony”), Vice-Admiral Sir Humphrey Walwyn at Government House, in the capital St John’s. In the afternoon the Duke proceeded to the Feildian Athletic Grounds and took the salute at a parade of Royal Navy, United States and Canadian military forces, as well as a contingent of Newfoundland Great War Veterans and of the Newfoundland Militia. Later, His Royal Highness visited the Grenfell Institute to meet more Allied servicemen and Newfoundland naval recruits. He spoke to many and was again particularly concerned about arrangements for their welfare and comfort. Then-in the company of the Governor- he motored to Bay Bulls Big Pond and departed for the journey back home to Britain. The Duke, it was said, had ‘encouraged…by word and deed [others] to carry on in their endeavours…’ in wartime.\n\nOn the return journey to England, following his 15,000 mile tour, the Duke took the controls of the Liberator bomber he was travelling in ‘for a short time’. The press were also keen to note that His Royal Highness ‘insisted’ in observing the usual travel etiquette such as showing his passport. The Prince also remembered his family from whom he had been separated for so long. His wife Marina received the gift of twelve pair of silk stockings, whilst his eldest child, Edward received the present of the model of an American bomber. Asked by the British press, on his return home on 13 September, about his return flight from Newfoundland, Prince George observed that “It was like flying back from Paris in peacetime. There wasn’t an incident.” Meanwhile, there were calls by some newspapers for the Duke to be sent out to Canberra as Governor-General, his previous appointment having been ‘postponed’ in 1939 due to the outbreak of war. A political commentator of one journal reasoned that ‘as he recently crossed in safety to Canada’ then ‘the risk of his now going to Australia could not be much greater.’ However, these comments were largely overlooked when the Duke spoke movingly in a BBC radio address on 17 September of the success of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan: ‘this great air training organisation…which is not surpassed anywhere in the world’. He also enthused that ‘I found everywhere…an admirable spirit of comradeship, a deep consciousness of the gravity of the crisis which confronts us, and an eagerness to get on with the job, and see it through, no matter what personal circumstances it might entail.’ His Royal Highness added that ‘I was glad to be able to tell the King what I had seen and what I had heard in Canada.’ Prince George ended his address by noting, ‘the magnificent spirit and resolution of the whole Canadian population impressed me deeply.’ The Dominion Office in London stated the Duke’s tour was ‘most successful and widely appreciated.’\n\nAt around 14:13 hours Danish time on 14 January, a Tasmanian-born girl became Queen of Denmark, the first ‘Aussie’ to hold this title. But who is the new Queen Mary of Denmark? How did she meet Crown Prince Frederik? What are her interests in her official life? What hobbies does she enjoy? How has she coped with the limelight? What do the Danes think?\n\nMary was born on a late summer’s day, 5 February 1972, in the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Hobart, the state capital of the Australian island of Tasmania. She was the fourth child and third daughter of John and Henrietta (‘Etta’) Donaldson, who both originally hailed from Port Seton in Scotland (just down the coast from Edinburgh). While John Donaldson studied at Edinburgh University, his father, Peter (a trawler skipper) was offered a job with the Flinders Island Trading Company in Tasmania. Mary is named after Peter’s wife, her paternal grandmother, Mary Elizabeth Donaldson. When John Donaldson finished his studies in Edinburgh, he married Etta in 1963. The newlyweds both then joined the rest of the Donaldson family in Tasmania. John was fortunate to be offered a scholarship at the University of Tasmania, where he would eventually earn a PhD degree. Both of Queen Mary’s parents spoke with Scottish accents and the family was and is proud of their Scottish heritage.\n\nHowever, when Mary was barely two, John Donaldson and his family relocated temporarily to the United States where he had been offered a position as a visiting professor at the University of Texas in Houston. During this time, Mary briefly attended the kindergarten of the Clear Lake City Elementary School. The Donaldson’s returned to Tasmania in 1975 (where John found an academic position in the science faculty of which he would later become Dean) and settled in Taroona, a suburb of Hobart, where the family purchased a house on Morris Avenue. This environment provided Mary with a secure childhood in a loving household, although Mary’s father was sufficiently strict to ensure that school homework was done (from 1978 she attended Waimea Heights Primary School, and in 1983 Mary enrolled at Taroona High School) and not too much time was spent at the beach. One pastime that Mary enjoyed was horse riding. She would later join the Southern Tasmania Adult Riding Club and purchase her own horse Bold Interest. Mary also won awards for show jumping. Meanwhile, at high school she played hockey and was elected to the school council. The future queen finished off her secondary education at Hobart Matriculation College where she achieved her Higher School Certificate in 1988.\n\nIn 1989, Mary enrolled at the University of Tasmania to study commerce and law. She is remembered for being a diligent student, but also very sociable. She graduated in 1995 with a bachelor’s degree in commerce and law ( B. Comm. LLB). Like many Tasmanians Mary moved to Melbourne, where she found work as accounts executive with an international advertising agency DDB Needham. She then moved on to MOJO Partners as an Account Manager. Mary’s remit included working with Hard Rock Café and an offshoot, Melbourne’s famous Windsor Hotel. Mary Donaldson is remembered by work colleagues of that time as open and outgoing with a well-developed sense of humour.\n\nHowever, in November 1997, Mary’s 55-year-old mother, who had also worked for the University of Tasmania (as an Executive Secretary), underwent heart surgery. Sadly, she died on 20 November following complications. This left the close knit family devastated. Perhaps this life-changing event made Mary Donaldson want to familiarise herself with her Scottish roots, as the following year, she made a visit to Scotland where she worked as an Account Manager for three months at the Rapp Collins, an advertising agency in Edinburgh. This extended visit gave her a chance to get to know her many relations in the area including her maternal Aunt, Catherine Murray.\n\nOn her return to Australia, in the early months of 1999, Mary settled in Sydney where she enjoyed all the delights this wonderful city had to offer including sailing, swimming and cycling. She also kept her riding skills honed with frequent forays around Centennial Park. But the main purpose of her relocation was to advance her career and Mary found a post as an Accounts Manager at the respected international advertising agency, Young and Rubicon, where she was regarded as a safe pair of hands and a hard worker. Mary built on her time there to progress to brand team leader at Love Communications. One of her campaigns was for Tourism Tasmania who wished to promote the island’s potential as a tourist destination.\n\nIn 1999, widower John Donaldson met the British crime writer, Susan Moody who had a position as a visiting fellow at a local college in Tasmania, Franklin Hall. The couple married in 2001. Mr Donaldson began to spend more time in Europe (his wife had a home in Oxford) with a spell, in 2004, as a visiting professor of applied mathematics at Denmark’s Aarhus University followed by a period at the University of Copenhagen in 2006 . The Donaldson’s also purchased a new home together in Sandy Bay, a respectable Hobart suburb.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary had rented a terraced house with two friends on Porter Street in Bondi Junction. However, soon this young woman’s life was about to enter a new phase. Crown Prince Frederik and his brother Joachim arrived in Sydney in September 2000 to attend the Olympic Games. They were accommodated at the Quay West hotel in the fashionable Rocks area and spent their first Saturday evening out on the town with Prince Nicholas of Greece and Norway’s Princess Martha-Louise. The royal group had arranged to meet with Beatrice Tarnawski, whose sister Katya was a good friend of Bruno Gomez-Acebo (a nephew of King Juan Carlos) at the Slip Inn. Beatrice had arranged for some others to make up the numbers and they included Mary Donaldson. Soon Mary and Frederik were in deep conversation as the group moved on to another venue, Establishment. Beatrice quickly came to the view that ‘something was afoot’ between Mary and Frederik. They saw each other a few times during his visit, but invariably Frederik had many engagements to attend.\n\nOn his return to Denmark, the Crown Prince phoned Mary frequently (some say daily). However, perhaps not wishing to leave anything to chance, Frederik decided to fly back to Australia for a prolonged visit of around five weeks. This time, with no official engagements to attend and little chance of the Crown Prince being recognised in suburban Sydney, he and Mary would go on long walks together, enjoy a barbecue or indulge in Frederik’s favourite pastime of sailing with Australian Chris Meehan and his then Danish girlfriend (and later wife), Lise Michaëla Ward, who had been a member of the Danish Olympic Sailing Team in Sydney. Subsequently, Mary Donaldson was to join the management team of Chris’s company, Belle Property in Sydney as Sales Manager. Her new boss thought her ‘deeply professional.’ Meanwhile, Frederik was also introduced to other friends simply as Frederik who came from Denmark. Many of the laid-back Australians even took to calling him ‘Fred’.\n\nHowever, on 6 November, the Crown Prince had suddenly to break off his trip to return to Denmark, as his beloved grandmother, Queen Ingrid, had taken a turn for the worse. He reached home in time to spend some quality time with this Swedish-born princess, who was a great-granddaughter of Britain’s Queen Empress Victoria and thus a staunch Anglophile. Ingrid died the day following his return. Nevertheless, the Crown Prince would return again and again to Australia over the next year to cement his relationship with Mary. And still the cat was never out of the bag! The couple had now know each other for around a year, when in September 2001, Se og Hør [See and Hear] the Danish celebrity news magazine mistakenly revealed that Frederik was romancing an Australian Olympic Gold Medallist called Belinda Stowell, who had competed in the 2000 Olympics (and had indeed met the Crown Prince on several occasions as a friend). However, it was now only a question of time before the truth came out over the reason for his frequent visits to Australia and when it did, it was thanks to a scoop, in November 2001, by Anna Johannesen of Billed-Bladet, a magazine focused on royals. Anna encountered Mary Donaldson as she left her Sydney office and asked her straight-out if she was Crown Prince Frederik’s girlfriend. Miss Donaldson kept her cool and simply answered, ‘No comment.’ Ms Johannesen had the presence of mind to have a photographer on standby who quickly snapped Mary for posterity. Mary later admitted that, ‘I was so shocked that I couldn’t think of anything to say.’ Within days, this picture accompanied Ms Johannsen’s story on the front page of Billed-Bladet.\n\nSuddenly, Mary Donaldson’s life was to change forever. The press were now omnipresent with photographers even chasing her while she was driving in the car. At one stage, Chris Meehan recalled that bodyguards had to be employed to protect Mary, who could not even leave her apartment to go for a walk. This period must also have given her a chance to reflect on the future, for only now was the reality beginning to dawn as to what a relationship with Frederik would entail. Perhaps this helped influence her decision to move to Paris in early 2002, where she taught English at a business language school, TRANSFER Etoile.\n\nImmediately prior to this, Mary had made a brief foray to Denmark in the new year arriving via Hamburg from England (where she had been spending Christmas of 2001 in Oxford). The Crown Prince’s good friend Jeppe Handwerk and his future wife, Birgitte were waiting to pick Mary up in Germany and they all motored together up to Denmark. Frederik met them at a roadside rest stop in Jutland. He and Mary then travelled to Birkelse Estate in North Jutland, where the Crown Prince’s friend, landowner Jørgen Skeel, was hosting a new year party attended by many friends. As 2002 was about to dawn, one of the guests taught Mary to count down from ten and shout out “Happy New Year” in Danish, while jumping from a chair!\n\nLater that same year, Mary relocated to Copenhagen where she joined Microsoft Business Solutions as a project consultant for business development, communication and marketing. She found a flat in Langelinie, which was only a few minutes walk from the Amalienborg. Little by little, she built up a small group of Danish girlfriends. The press was increasingly interested in her presence with a reward offered by Se og Hør for a picture of Mary and Frederik together on Danish soil.\n\nDuring the late spring and summer of 2002, photographers snatched pictures of the couple together at a café in Aarhus and Mary was also spotted cheering on Frederik as he participated in the Dragon [Sailing] Race of Juland at Kalø. However, the most exciting encounter, from the press viewpoint, was when she and Frederik were pictured during the Christmas holidays with Queen Margrethe attending the Palads Cinema in Aarhus to watch the film The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. This was interpreted by the press as a sign of approval of Mary and her relationship with Frederik. A Crown-Princess-in-waiting? Certainly, Mary must have impressed her mother-in-law-to-be when they first met over afternoon tea, an English tradition brought to Copenhagen by the late Queen Ingrid.\n\nWith such media attention, Mary was therefore pleased during this early period of her life in Denmark to receive visits from her father and his second wife, as well as friends such as Chris Meehan and Lise Michaëla Ward. Other family members and friends back in Australia were only an e-mail or telephone call away. To them she could openly discuss the difficulties of learning Danish, for behind the scenes she was receiving an intensive course of lessons (this would subsequently increase to up to three hours a day as her relationship with Crown Frederik progressed). In addition to lessons in speaking the language, this instruction would also include writing essays in Danish, as well as reading informative books (including Palle Lauring’s The History of the Kingdom of Denmark) and local newspapers. For recreation, and a chance to de-stress, Mary turned to her favourite pastime of horse riding at a farm at Birkerød.\n\nIn January 2003, she and Frederik visited Tasmania as the Crown Prince was competing in the Dragon Class World Championship biennial sailing regatta with his boat Nanoq. The couple met the press at a photo call in Hobart’s harbour area during which Frederik was photographed giving Mary a kiss on the cheek. It was yet another signal that an engagement between the two was surely not far off. Thereafter, it was back to work at Microsoft and a summer holiday spent at Skagen on the Jutland peninsula. Mary was also photographed with Frederik at the wedding of some of his friends.\n\nOn a warm summer’s day in August 2003, the Danish press were invited to Queen Margrethe and her husband, Prince Henrik’s summer home, the Château de Caïx in southern France. The subject of Mary Donaldson came up and the Danish queen deftly commented, ‘We have met her, as you well know, and appreciate her.’ When asked if Mary would make a suitable daughter-in-law she replied candidly, ‘I think it will be fine.’ This seemed to give the green light to a true media frenzy.\n\nMary became engaged to Crown Prince Frederik on 8 October. This came as no surprise as on 24 September, the Danish court had already announced that Queen Margrethe intended to give her consent to the marriage at the State Council meeting scheduled for that date. Just prior to this, Mary handed in her notice at Microsoft. It transpired that Frederik had asked her to marry him in the traditional way during a romantic visit to Rome. On 8 October, following the 10am State Council meeting at Christiansborg Palace, the betrothed couple appeared at noon with their respective parents on the balcony of the Christian IX Palace at Amalienborg to acknowledge the greeting of a crowd estimated at 20,000. She and Frederik then faced the press at 3.30pm in the Garden Room at Fredensborg during which the future Crown Princess spoke briefly in Danish and admitted to being ‘a little bit nervous.’ At times she seemed almost overwhelmed by the rapid questions in Danish in such a pressurised environment but Frederik did most of the talking. All the assembled photographers scrambled to obtain an image of the engagement ring: an emerald-cut diamond flanked by two rubies designed by the Brazilian jeweller Mauricio Monteiro. Mary did however subsequently manage to articulate her feelings about Frederik: ‘He makes me happy. He is smart, brave and caring, and he is quite funny and charming. He is warm and he has a big heart.’ Shortly thereafter, Mary travelled home to Tasmania to attend the wedding of her older sister, Patricia.\n\nFollowing the engagement, Mary received further briefings which were aimed at familiarising her with the life ahead. This included a tour of the Foreign Ministry which was useful as this government ministry would be involved in planning royal visits overseas in conjunction with the Royal House. There was also a visit to the National Bank (Danmarks Nationalbank). Following his marriage, Frederik was to receive a DKK 9,000,000 increase in his appanage payment, to cover the expenses of setting up a new home (the Frederik VIII Palace at Amalienborg was eventually allocated to the couple but required upgrading), added staff and housekeeping costs, an anticipated increase in public duties and for paying an allowance to his wife (it was estimated the latter would make up around 10% of the total). The future crown princess was also introduced to some young politicians from various Danish political parties. They discussed the world situation and what it feels like to be in the public spotlight.\n\nInterestingly, a few days before the nuptials, there was a pre-wedding banquet at Christianborg Palace at which Mary wore the magnificent antique Danish Ruby Tiara which has its origins at the court of Napoleon. This had been a firm favourite of the late Queen Ingrid’s, having been originally brought from Sweden by Princess Louise (as a gift from her grandmother, Queen Josephine), at the time of her wedding to Danish Crown Prince Frederik in 1869. Mary would later recall that, ‘The first time I had to wear the diadem, I felt it was a great honour, but there was also a bit of pressure. It had last been worn by Queen Ingrid, who was much loved and admired by the Danes, so it came with some expectations’. She found herself questioning ‘Can I live up to them?’\n\nThe couple married in Copenhagen’s Lutheran Cathedral (sometimes referred to as the Church of Our Lady) on 14 May 2004 before an television audience estimated at 2.5 million. Guests in the Cathedral included a plethora of royals, Scandinavian presidents and the Governor-General of Australia, Michael Jeffery, who officially represented Mary’s homeland. The bride wore a wedding dress created by Danish fashion designer Uffe Frank with a veil of Irish lace first used by Crown Princess Margareta of Sweden (nee Princess Margaret of Connaught), the British-born mother of the late Queen Ingrid. She also wore a diamond tiara featuring a sophisticated fleur-de-lis design which was a wedding gift from her future in-laws. Mary’s older sisters Jane Stephens and Patricia Bailey, and her friend Amber Petty served as bridesmaids, while Frederik’s brother Prince Joachim (who was already married [in 1995] to Alexandra Manley) was the best man. The wedding reception was held at Fredensborg Castle. Queen Margrethe made an impressive speech of welcome to the new bride and, addressing Mary’s father in English, Her Majesty enthused, ‘The way we, her in-laws, have come to know Mary, we have come to love her and admire her. She possesses a great inner strength, and she radiates a calmness and a warmth that creates trust. She is now showing that courage to lay down her future in Denmark. May we always be worthy of her trust.’\n\nMary-who had previously held joint British and Australian nationality-became a Danish citizen on the day she married and swapped her Presbyterian worship for that of the Lutheran church. The latter step had been taken very seriously and Mary had received instruction on the Lutheran faith from Christian Thodberg, the Royal Chaplain. Mary also signed a prenuptial agreement which was not unusual in the Danish Royal Family as both Prince Henrik and Alexandra Manley were required to do so. Interestingly, there was soon a timely reminder to Mary that marrying a Prince might not always result in a fairy-tale ending, when it was announced in September that Prince Joachim and Alexandra were to divorce.\n\nIn the beginning, the royal couple settled at the Chancellery House, the late Queen Ingrid’s final home, close-by Fredensborg Palace. This would be their main base for many years, while the Frederik VIII Palace underwent extensive renovations. Thereafter, the Chancellery House would serve as the Crown Princely family’s weekend home and a swimming pool would be added to the facilities already available there. The Crown Princess’ office was quickly besieged by requests numerous public bodies, clubs and charities requesting that Mary become their Patron. These took some time to review. Yet, Mary appeared determined from day one to succeed in her role. Initially, the Crown Princess threw herself into the Danish fashion world and was named as Patron of Copenhagen International Fashion Fair. Another early patronage was the Danish Association for Mental Health. Unsurprisingly given the circumstances of her late mother’s death, so too was the Danish Heart Foundation. She took over this role from Frederik. The Crown Prince and Princess also focused on making several visits overseas in an official capacity in the spring of 2005. The first was to Mary’s homeland at the end of February. Although there was a chance to see family, the tour was packed with official engagements including four charity fund-raising dinners. It was around this time that Mary discovered she was pregnant. This was followed by a visit to Japan in April to attend the World Expo 2005 at Nagakute, with a brief visit to Thailand also included in the itinerary.\n\nOver the coming years, Mary acquired over thirty patronages ranging from the Danish Refugee Council to the World Wildlife Fund (Denmark) to the Odense Flower Festival. Furthermore, in 2007, the Crown Princess established The Mary Foundation using a wedding gift of 1.1 million kroner which she and Frederik had received from the people of Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Greenland. The Foundation works to foster a feeling of belonging, that no one should feel left out or alone (“People Need Love”). This is achieved by bringing together the right people including professionals, financial institutions, and other organizations to form partnerships and target help to those in need, whether it be preventing loneliness or bullying or reaching out to those suffering as a result of domestic violence. According to Mary, the driving force for her undertaking this endeavour is a strong sense of justice, allied to her difficulty of seeing a person standing alone. She is totally committed and has no difficulty in donning a football kit to play with youngsters to highlight the work undertaken by the Foundation.\n\nIn the past Mary has said that she writes most of her speeches herself, measuring each word she writes carefully. She then goes through it, practicing again and again, until she feels confident in the final outcome. This was particularly important during the earlier years as she acquired total fluency in Danish. However, there has long been a professional assurance in her delivery, such that she had become-according to Danish journalist Hanne Juul, a ‘top professional queen candidate’. This was certainly evident when she spoke with great assurance at her husband’s 50th birthday party in 2018 in a speech addressed to her husband which was a mixture of humour (tales of Frederik dressed in Lycra, as well as alluding to his bad jokes) and seriousness (when talking of their first meeting: ‘We hit the spot without aiming’). Movingly, she mentioned too that it was in the shared family moments with Frederik and their children, that she felt most grateful, most connected and most in love. Unsurprisingly, she won the award for speech of the year by the speechmaking association Danske Taler. Furthermore, when Crown Princess Mary attended an official engagement, she made sure to pay close attention to the photographers, so as to ensure that they were able to capture some interesting photos which would help to promote the cause or event she was attending. If there is a criticism it is that sometimes she could appear a little too controlled. However, this could also be viewed more charitably as professionalism.\n\nWomens’ rights have also been close to the new Queen’s heart. As Patron of the UN Population Fund, she spoke out, in April 2014, at an Amnesty International seminar at the Hotel Nyborg Strand dealing with the theme “My Body My Rights”, during which the right of women and girls to decide on matters of sexual and reproductive matters was placed under the spotlight and debated. Mary emphasised that ‘It is a human right to decide over one’s body’ and mentioned some frightening statistics on forced marriages, female circumcision and women’s deaths due to complications while giving birth (“maternal mortality”). The investigative work she had undertaken was a ‘shocking journey.’ In 2016, the then Crown Princess was appointed Patron of the world’s largest conference on women’s and girl’s rights, Women Deliver, held in Copenhagen. This examined gender equality, education, economic empowerment, sexual health etc. Six thousand delegates from 169 countries attended. Mary now described herself as ‘ dedicated to continuing the work to ensure that girls and women are at the centre of development work.’ Last year, in connection with International Women’s Day, she attended a Gender Diversity Roundtable in Copenhagen’s UN City. This discussed diversity, equality and inclusion in times of change and digitalisation in Danish companies and organizations. Among those attending were leaders from business, academia and civil society.\n\nIn 2018, Crown Princess Mary spoke at a conference at the UN General Assembly on “Protecting Health Rights of Women and Girls Affected by Conflict”. Indeed, health promotion in general is an area in which the Crown Princess has been involved over the years. As Patron of the WHO [World Health Organisation] Office for the European Region, she regularly met with members of the WHO for updates at the Frederik VIII Palace. Most recently, Mary was involved in addressing the problem of AMR (antimicrobial resistance) which is a growing global problem that affects both human and animal health . She made a keynote speech on the subject during an international conference held last spring in Copenhagen. The aim of the conference was to foster new partnerships – across sectors and national borders – for the prevention and treatment of AMR.\n\nMary has often undertaken duties to do with the promotion of Danish exports. Last spring, she and her husband visited the Indian cities of New Delhi and Chennai as part of a major Danish business campaign involving thirty-eight Danish companies who were looking to penetrate this large international market. Denmark is already making a significant contribution to India’s green transition by offering sustainable solutions in terms of water and energy. Then, in mid-April, the Crown Princess visited Milan at the head of a delegation promoting sustainable urban development products. Seventeen Danish companies were represented at the event “This is Denmark “at the Alcova Exhibition Centre under the auspices of Creative Denmark, the Confederation of Danish Industry and the Danish Embassy in Rome. This promotional trip took place during Milan Design Week 2023. The Crown Princess undertook a hectic schedule of duties over two days in Milan, which included a meeting with the Mayor and a roundtable event where experts held discussions to find solutions aimed at making up to one hundred European cities climate neutral by 2030. Mary also presided over an official dinner attended by Danish and Italian guests.\n\nThe results of climate change are to be seen everywhere and in late April 2023 the Crown Princess made a four-day trip to the island states of Vanuatu and Fiji, accompanied by the Danish Minister for Development Cooperation and Global Climate Policy Dan Jørgensen. The island of Vanuatu had recently been hit by two earthquakes and two cyclones. Fiji too was increasingly experiencing the consequences of global climate change. There was also a one-day stopover in Sydney where Mary took the chance to meet Danish business representatives involved in the green transition in Australia. This included visits to a number of Danish-led projects in the construction and transport sectors.\n\nThe Crown Princess Mary Centre "
