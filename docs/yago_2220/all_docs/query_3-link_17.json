        "text": "Queen Margrethe has two siblings: HRH Princess Benedikte (b. 1944) and HM Queen Anne-Marie (b. 1946)\n\nChristening and confirmation\n\nQueen Margrethe was christened on 14 May 1940 in Holmens Kirke (the Naval Church) and confirmed on 1 April 1955 in Fredensborg Palace Chapel.\n\nThe Act of Succession\n\nThe Act of Succession of 27 March 1953 gave women the right of succession to the Danish Throne but only secondarily. On the occasion of her accession to the Throne on 14 January 1972, HM Queen Margrethe II became the first Danish Sovereign under the new Act of Succession.\n\nThe Act of Succession has since been amended in 2009, when full equality in the succession to the Throne was introduced. That means the regent’s oldest child – regardless of gender – inherits the Throne (so-called primogeniture). Similar rules are found in several other European monarchies, including Norway and Sweden.\n\nA seat on the State Council\n\nOn 16 April 1958, Queen Margrethe (at the time the Heir Apparent) was given a seat on the State Council and subsequently chaired the meetings of the State Council in the absence of the king.\n\nAbdication\n\nHer Majesty Queen Margrethe announced in the New Year's Adress on 31st December 2023, that Her Majesty would step down as Queen of Denmark on 14th January 2024 and hand over the throne to her son, King Frederik X.\n\nWedding\n\nOn 10 June 1967, Queen Margrethe (at the time the Heir Apparent) married Henri Marie Jean André, Count of Laborde de Monpezat, who in connection with the marriage became Prince Henrik of Denmark. The engagement was announced on 5 October 1966. The wedding ceremony took place in Holmens Kirke, and the wedding festivities were held at Fredensborg Palace. Prince Henrik passed away on 13 February 2018.\n\nChildren\n\nHM King Frederik X (Frederik André Henrik Christian), born 26 May 1968, and HRH Prince Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian, born 7 June 1969.\n\nQueen Margrethe attended Zahles Skole between 1946 and 1955 and was a private pupil at Amalienborg from 1946 to 1949. In the school year 1955-1956, Queen Margrethe was a boarder at North Foreland Lodge in Hampshire, England. Having received private lessons, Queen Margrethe graduated from Zahles Skole with the upper secondary examination certificate (language line) in 1959. Between 1960 and 1965, Queen Margrethe studied at universities in Denmark and other European countries.\n\nAfter having passed the examination in philosophy at Copenhagen University in 1960, Queen Margrethe studied archaeology at the University of Cambridge, England in 1960-1961 and earned a Diploma in Prehistoric Archaeology. Subsequently, Queen Margrethe studied political science at Aarhus University in 1961-1962, at the Sorbonne, Paris in 1963 and at the London School of Economics in 1965.\n\nRelation to the Defence\n\nQueen Margrethe performed voluntary service with Women’s Flying Corps from 1958 to 1970 and received comprehensive training in the corps as corporal in the Women’s Air Force, sergeant in the Women’s Air Force and lieutenant in the Women’s Air Force.\n\nIn addition to her relationship with the Danish Defence, Queen Margrethe has special connections to particular units of the British Defence. In 1972, Queen Margrethe was appointed Colonel-in-Chief of The Queen's Regiment, and in 1992, she was appointed Colonel-in-Chief of The Princess of Wales' Royal Regiment.\n\nLanguage\n\nQueen Margrethe’s mother tongue is Danish. In addition, Her Majesty speaks French, Swedish, English and German."
