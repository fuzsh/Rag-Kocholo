        "text": "Frederik IX\n\nKing of Denmark, 1947-1972\n\nChristian Frederik Franz Michael Carl Valdemar Georg was born at Sorgenfri Palace in Kongens Lyngby on Zealand on March 11, 1899, the son of Prince Christian and Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin; brother Knud was born about a year later.\n\nKing Christian IX, died on January 29, 1906, and Frederik's grandfather, Crown Prince Frederik, succeeded him as King Frederik VIII. Frederik's father became crown prince, and Frederik moved up to second in line to the throne. On May 14, 1912, King Frederik VIII died, and Frederik's father ascended the throne as King Christian X. Frederick himself now became Crown Prince.\n\nAfter completing his basic education, Frederik entered the Royal Danish Naval Academy. By the time he ascended to the throne, he had had several senior commands on active service and had attained the rank of Rear Admiral.\n\nOn May 24, 1935, Crown Prince Frederik married Princess Ingrid of Sweden. The couple ultimately had three daughters -- Princess Margrethe Alexandrine Þórhildur Ingrid (born 1940), later Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, who married French Count Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, who was created Prince Henrik of Denmark, in 1967; Princess Benedikte Astrid Ingeborg Ingrid (born 1944), who married Prince Richard of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg in 1968; and Princess Anne-Marie Dagmar Ingrid (born 1946), who married King Constantine II of the Hellenes in 1964.\n\nFrom 1942 until 1943, Frederik acted as regent on behalf of his father, who was temporarily incapacitated after a fall from his horse in October 1942. On April 20, 1947, Christian X died, and Frederik succeeded to the throne. He was proclaimed king from the balcony of Christiansborg Palace by Prime Minister Knud Kristensen.\n\nKing Frederik IX's reign was fairly uneventful, with the only major event being enactment of a new Constitution in 1953 that allowed women to succeed to the throne. The King and Queen were very popular, due in large part to being the first Danish Royal Family to allow the press into their home.\n\nKing Frederik died on January 14, 1972, and was buried at Roskilde Cathedral. He was succeeded by his eldest daughter, who became Queen Margrethe II.\n\nSee Also\n\nKing Christian X\n\nQueen Margrethe II"
