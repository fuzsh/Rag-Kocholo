        "text": "1935 royal wedding in Stockholm Cathedral\n\nWedding of Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark, and Princess Ingrid of SwedenDate24 May 1935VenueStockholm CathedralLocationStockholm, SwedenParticipantsFrederik, Crown Prince of Denmark\n\nPrincess Ingrid of Sweden\n\nThe wedding of Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark (later King Frederik IX), and Princess Ingrid of Sweden took place on Friday, 24 May 1935 in Storkyrkan.\n\nCrown Prince Frederik was the heir apparent to the Danish throne and Princess Ingrid was the granddaughter of King of Gustaf V of Sweden.\n\nEngagement\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore their engagement, the marriages of Crown Prince Frederik and Princess Ingrid had been the topic of much conversation in their respective countries. False rumours of an engagement between the pair were spread on numerous occasions, including in 1918, 1929 and 1934.[citation needed] The pair had also both been previously linked to other royal persons.\n\nFrederik's mother, Queen Alexandrine, had originally considered the two youngest daughters of her cousin, Nicholas II of Russia, Grand Duchesses Maria and Anastasia, as possible wives for Frederik, prior to their execution oin 1918. Later, Frederik met his second cousin, Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark, in Cannes and their engagement was announced on 5 March 1922 before being called off two months later.[1][2][3]\n\nThe question of Ingrid's future marriage was the topic of much conversation in the 1920s. Among others, she was seen by some as a possible wife for the heir apparent to the British throne, Edward, Prince of Wales, who was her second cousin.[4] Her mother, Princess Margaret of Connaught, and the Prince's father, King George V, were first cousins, both being grandchildren of Queen Victoria. She was also considered a match for his younger brother, Prince George. Neither of these matches came to fruition.\n\nDespite court officials denying an engagement in January 1935, their engagement was announced on 15 March 1935.[citation needed] In a 1969 interview, Frederik revealed the couple had gotten engaged in private in the beginning of February.[5] The couple were double third cousins through mutual descent from Oscar I of Sweden and Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden and fourth cousins once removed through Paul I of Russia. It was described as a love match.\n\nPre-wedding celebrations\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the week leading up to the wedding, numerous events were held in Stockholm to celebrate. The bride and groom's mutual cousin, Queen Astrid of Belgium, and her husband, King Leopold III, hosted a reception at the Belgian Embassy. On the evening of 22 May, the bride's grandfather, King Gustav V, held a dinner and concert for 800 guests at the Royal Palace and a second reception was held on the evening of 23 May followed by a gala performance at the Royal Swedish Opera.[citation needed]\n\nWedding\n\n[edit]\n\nThe wedding took place in Stockholm Cathedral on 24 May 1935 and was officiated by the Archbishop of Uppsala, Erling Eidem.\n\nAttire\n\n[edit]\n\nIngrid wore the veil of Irish lace that her late mother, Princess Margaret of Connaught, had worn at her wedding 30 years prior. The veil has since been worn by all of Ingrid's female descendants – as well as Mary Donaldson, the present Queen consort of Denmark. She wore a crown of myrtle from a shrub her mother had brought with her from Osborne House in England to Sofiero Palace in Sweden. Carrying a sprig of myrtle in your wedding bouquet is a tradition that is maintained to this day in the Swedish royal family and, with Ingrid, has continued into the Danish royal family when she brought cuttings from the shrub at Sofiero to be planted at Fredensborg Palace.\n\nAttendants\n\n[edit]\n\nIngrid's second cousins Princess Ragnhild and Princess Astrid of Norway served as bridesmaids while Count Gustaf Bernadotte of Wisborg, son of Folke Bernadotte, was a ring bearer.\n\nGuests\n\n[edit]\n\nRelatives of the bride\n\n[edit]\n\nThe King of Sweden, the bride's paternal grandfather\n\nThe Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Sweden, the bride's father and stepmother\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Västerbotten, the bride's brother and sister-in-law\n\nThe Duke of Halland, the bride's brother\n\nThe Duke of Dalarna, the bride's brother\n\nThe Duke of Södermanland, the bride's paternal uncle\n\nThe Duke of Närke, the bridge's paternal granduncle\n\nCount and Countess Folke Bernadotte of Wisborg, the bride's paternal first cousin once removed and his wife\n\nCount Gustaf Bernadotte of Wisborg, the bride's paternal second cousin\n\nPrince and Princess Arthur of Connaught, the bride's maternal uncle and aunt\n\nLady Patricia Ramsay, the bride's maternal aunt\n\nPrincess Helena Victoria, the bride's maternal first cousin once removed\n\nRelatives of the groom\n\n[edit]\n\nThe King and Queen of Denmark and Iceland, the groom's parents\n\nPrince Harald of Denmark, the groom's paternal uncle\n\nPrincess Feodora of Denmark, the groom's paternal first cousin\n\nPrincess Alexandrine-Louise of Denmark, the groom's paternal first cousin\n\nThe Duchess and Duke of Västergötland, the groom's paternal aunt and uncle (also the bride's paternal granduncle and grandaunt)\n\nPrincess Margaretha and Prince Axel of Denmark, the groom's paternal first cousin (also the bride's first cousin once removed) and the groom's paternal first cousin once removed\n\nThe Crown Princess and Crown Prince of Norway, the groom's paternal first cousins (also the bride's paternal first cousin once removed and the bride's paternal second cousin) (representing the King of Norway)\n\nPrincess Ragnhild of Norway, the groom's double first cousin once removed (also the bride's paternal second cousin)\n\nPrincess Astrid of Norway, the groom's double first cousin once removed (also the bride's paternal second cousin)\n\nThe Queen and King of the Belgians, the groom's paternal first cousin (also the bride's paternal first cousin once removed) and her husband\n\nThe Duke of Östergötland, the groom's paternal first cousin (also the bride's paternal first cousin once removed)\n\nPrincess Thyra of Denmark, the groom's paternal aunt\n\nPrince Gustav of Denmark, the groom's paternal uncle\n\nPrincess Friedrich Sigismund of Prussia, the groom's paternal first cousin\n\nPrince Christian of Schaumburg-Lippe, the groom's paternal first cousin\n\nPrince George of Greece and Denmark, the groom's paternal first cousin once removed\n\nPrincess Eugénie of Greece and Denmark, the groom's paternal second cousin\n\nThe Margrave and Margravine of Baden the groom's paternal second cousins (also the bride's step cousin and her husband)\n\nPrince Valdemar of Denmark, the groom's paternal granduncle\n\nPrince Erik, Count of Rosenborg, the groom's paternal first cousin once removed\n\nPrince Viggo, Count of Rosenborg, and Princess Viggo, Countess of Rosenborg, the groom's paternal first cousin once removed and his wife\n\nPrincess and Prince René of Bourbon-Parma, the groom's paternal first cousin once removed and her husband\n\nThe Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the groom's maternal uncle and aunt\n\nThe Hereditary Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the groom's maternal first cousin\n\nDuke Christian of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the groom's maternal first cousin\n\nDuchess Thyra of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the groom's maternal first cousin\n\nDuchess Anastasia of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the groom's maternal first cousin\n\nThe German Crown Princess and Crown Prince, the groom's maternal aunt and uncle\n\nPrince Hubertus of Prussia, the groom's maternal first cousin\n\nPrince Friedrich of Prussia, the groom's maternal first cousin\n\nPrincess Alexandrine of Prussia, the groom's maternal first cousin\n\nPrincess Cecilie of Prussia, the groom's maternal first cousin\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
