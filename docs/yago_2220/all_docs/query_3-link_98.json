        "text": "Quavo & Lenny Kravitz Dropping New Track Friday Sampling ‘Fly Away’\n\nEarlier this summer, Quavo entered his collaboration era, recently releasing tracks with Lana Del Rey and Peso Pluma. The rapper took to Instagram to preview his upcoming single featuring Lenny Kravitz, which includes a sample of Kravitz’s iconic “Fly Away.”\n\n“When u reach for new heights Sky is the limit! #FLY,” Huncho captioned the clip teasing the song.\n\nPresumably titled “FLY,” based on Quavo’s Instagram captions, the rapper confirmed that the track is set to drop this Friday (August 9). The final clip shows Kravitz and Quavo walking toward the camera, with the longest snippet of the song revealed so far.\n\n“I’m feelin’ the wave / I wanna fly (I wanna fly) / Let’s get geeked, let’s get drunk, let’s get high (Let’s get high),” Quavo raps. “Don’t go on a plane (Phew) / I’m sittin’ in jet way / You already no which way we goin’ (Go), that way (Top).”\n\nThe Migos rapper first shared a black-and-white preview of the track last week, writing, “Flyest in the room u jus passed the moon … Fly’n Soon!!!” He has since posted new snippets from the music video shoot, captioning one, “This Is Not a VS!!!,” as the video zoomed in on Kravitz playing guitar.\n\nProducer Southside and artist Chance the Rapper showed their support, with Chance gushing, “This was my favorite song in the world when I was a kid.” However, fan reactions to Quavo’s Lenny Kravitz rework were mixed.\n\nOne disappointed fan commented, “What in the high school music is this my n—-?!” Another added, “Boi I outta report yo ahh for this weak shxt.”\n\nOn the other hand, another fan appreciated Quavo’s effort to keep his music fresh “Old Lenny Kravitz sample. I love it… The game need more then the same trap beats.”\n\n“Fly Away” originally appeared as a late addition to Lenny Kravitz’s 5 album in 1998. Today, younger fans might recognize the song from a commercial promoting tourism in the Bahamas, featuring Kravitz.\n\nMany people expressed their love for Kravitz in the comments, with one person writing, “His voice carries me away!!!” Another commented, “Love Lenny Kravitz, I’d fly away with him.”\n\nFittingly, Quavo covered “Fly Away” earlier this year alongside George Clinton at a Los Angeles Grammys party for The Recording Academy Honors, presented by The Black Music Collective (BMC).\n\nIn July, Quavo and Lana Del Rey teamed up for a country-rap collaboration titled “Tough.” In the music video, the duo enjoys a leisurely life at a countryside mansion, taking turns shooting guns and cruising in a beat-up Chevy truck. The lyrics capture the perspective of a couple reflecting on life’s hardships after reaching a better place.\n\nCheck out the music video here.\n\nKayla is the midday host on Detroit’s 105.1 The Bounce.
