        "text": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark, Jan. 14—King Frederik IX of Denmark died tonight at the Copenhagen municipal hospital. He was 72 years old.\n\nThe King, who had been taken ill with influenza soon after speaking to the Danish people on television on New Year's Eve, died of pneumonia complicated by a heart attack.\n\nHe will be succeeded by his eldest daughter, 31‐year‐old Princess Margrethe, who will be Denmark's first reigning queen.\n\nQueen Ingrid, the King's Swedish‐born wife, was at his side when he died. Also present were their three daughters and their husbands—Princess Mar grethe and Prince Henrik, Prin cess Benedikte and Prince Rich ard, and Queen Anne‐Marie and the exiled King Constantine of Greece—and other members of the royal family.\n\nKing Frederik will be buried in the 12th‐century cathedral of Roskilde, the burial place of Danish monarchs for the last 600 years.\n\nPremier Jens Otto Krag to morrow will proclaim Princess Margrethe queen from the bal cony of Christiansborg Palace, the seat of government and Parliament, in a simple cere mony that replaced the coro nation more than a century ago.\n\nCourt officials were unsure whether the new monarch would be known as Queen Margrethe I or II. An earlier Queen Margrethe united Den mark, Norway and Sweden under the Danish crown from 1387 to 1412, but she was never crowned queen.\n\nThe constitution was amend ed in 1953 to allow Margrethe to succeed her father, who had no male heir.\n\nHer elder son, Frederik, born in 1968, will become Crown Prince.\n\nAn Informal Monarch\n\nBy ALDEN WHITMAN\n\nAlthough Frederik IX was a monarch with an impeccable lineage and enjoyed many spe cial privileges that went with his royal status, he was the very model of a bourgeois king, who answered the tele phone himself and was handy with the vacuum cleaner. He owned a crown or two, but never wore them. His ceremo nial attire was an admiral's uniform, which signified his lifelong interest in the Danish Navy, through whose ranks he had progressed as a young man.\n\nAs a sailor, Frederik devel oped a fondness for tattoos and physical fitness. This combina tion led him later to utilize the services of a professional bodybuilder, from whom he took a correspondence course that expanded his chest meas urement to 45 inches and that of his biceps to 15 inches. His arms had long been decorated with dragons and birds, and when his chest had reached its ultimate proportions he per suaded a British tattooer to needle a magnificent ruby red dragon on it.\n\nSomehow, candid snapshots of Frederik displaying his mus cularity and his tattoos got into the British press and were picked up in the Copenhagen newspapers. Rather than out rage over a King in the buff, there was chortling about “Skipper Skraek” —Danish for “Popeye the Sailor.”\n\nNot a Remote Figure\n\nThe episode illustrated the ?? relationship to his peo le and theirs to him. He was constitutional symbol re moved from the commonalty by his state functions, but not re mote from them in his person ality and life‐style. The 4.9 mil lion people over whom he reigned made their living most ly from food and agricultural products—butter, pigs, cheese and beer. There were neither marked extremes of wealth nor poverty in the tiny, low‐lying country of 17,000 square miles, where most people lived in one‐ family houses and where social welfare legislation had long been accepted. Similar condi tions obtained in the 840000‐ square‐mile island province of Greenland, where fishing and hunting dominated the econo my of its 47,000 inhabitants.\n\nThus it was that Frederik was on the parliamentary pay ?? like any other civil servant this salary was adjusted from time to time to the cost of living index), and he had to watch his kroner. He sent his three daughters to public school instead of to private tutors. And before lumbago and age enfeebled his legs, he pedaled his bicycle around Copenhagen and dropped casually into book shops and stores. He was dis tinguished chiefly by his height of 6 feet 33¾ inches.\n\nHis informality was further accentuated by semimonthly public audiences at Christians borg Palace in Copenhagen. There, in a vast anteroom, he received any subject who cared to chat or submit a grievance or had a problem. Among his duties in what he called “the shop” were to sign appoint ments and laws adopted by Parliament, to meet ceremonial ly with the Cabinet once a month and to be briefed weekly on matters of state. Otherwise, he was regally occupied by such ceremonies as dedicating build ings, opening exhibitions and launching ships. He was occa sionally bored, and his face showed it.\n\nTo relieve the ennui, Fred erik drank heartily with his friends. When foreign journal ists were in town, he was known to slip out of his pal ace for an evening with them. One correspondent, who was invited to the palace, reported afterward that he had passed the time in strenuous wine bibbing.\n\nThe King's fondness for spi rits was an ill‐kept secret. He fell off his chair at a state banquet in London on one oc casion. On another, he had him self tattooed with the dragon. His wife, who was related to Queen Victoria, was not amused. She demanded that Frederik keep sober, and he took to chain‐smoking ciga rettes for the sake of domes tic harmony. He was also par tial to a pipe.\n\nFrederik liked his job best when he could get away from etiquette on the royal yacht Dannebrog and cruise Den mark's coast and islands. His people learned not to be aston ished when the ship hoved to in some small cove. Another diversion was trains. He liked to be at the locomotive throttle on test runs, and at one time he was said to have memo rized the timetables for all the trains in the kingdom. He also liked to hunt—mostly deer— at his lodge in North Jutland, to which he often invited rep resentative subjects.\n\nHis greatest passion, how ever, was music. He learned to play the piano as a child and developed a serious inter est in scores and conducting. He often entered the royal box at the opera with a bouncy step, greeted the audience with a grin and a wave and settled down to follow the per formance, score in hand. As a conductor, he was more than an amateur, according to musi cians who played under his baton.\n\nThey said he was quite cred itable in works by Beethoven, Wagner, Sibelius, Grieg, Rossi ni, Franck and various Danish composers. It was his custom to be on the podium when the State Radio Symphony Orches tra broadcast the opening con cert of Denmark's music week.\n\nFor the most part Frederik lived a routinized life. In the winter he and his family lived in Amalienborg Palace in cen tral Copenhagen. In the spring they moved to Fredensborg un til summer and cruise time, after which they took up resi dence in Graasten Castle in South Jutland. Autumn found them in Fredensborg again. Christmas, and often Easter, were passed at the hunting ?? in Trend.\n\nFrederik was a descendant of Gorm the Old, a 10th‐centu ry absolute monarch. The head of the House of (Glucksburg) was born March 11, 1899, and was christened Christian Fred erik Franz Michael Carl Valde mar Georg. In the family he was called Ricco.\n\nThe boy and his younger brother, Knud, were educated privately. At the age of 13 he expressed a desire to join the Navy, which he did in 1917, five years after becoming Crown Prince. He spent four years in the Cadet School, served as a junior officer and by 1935 attained the rank of commander after having skip pered a torpedo boat for two years.\n\nIn 1935 he married the Swedish Princess Ingrid, daugh ter of the then Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf. Tall and at tractive, with ash‐blonde hair, Ingrid was taken to heart by her middle‐class subjects. And she, in turn, proved as unaf fected as her husband. She did her own marketing and was known to push the royal baby carriage around the streets near the palace.\n\nDuring the five‐year occu pation of Denmark by the Nazis, Frederik and Ingrid were un der virtual house arrest. After his father's illness in 1942 he was Regent and is said to have discreetly encouraged the re sistance movement. His father, Christian X, died in 1947, two years after the German occu pation had ended, and his son was proclaimed in his place."
