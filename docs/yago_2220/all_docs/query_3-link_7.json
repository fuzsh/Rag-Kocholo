        "text": "by Susan Flantzer © Unofficial Royalty 2015\n\nPrincess Ingrid of Sweden was born on March 28, 1910, at the Royal Palace in Stockholm, Sweden. At the time of her birth her parents, the future King Gustav VI Adolf of Sweden and Princess Margaret of Connaught, were the Crown Prince and Princess of Sweden. Ingrid’s mother was the daughter of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, and therefore a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Ingrid was the only daughter and the third of her parents’ five children. Ingrid had four brothers:\n\nPrince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten (1906 – 1947), married Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha; had five children including King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden\n\nPrince Sigvard, Duke of Uppland (1907 – 2002) later Count Sigvard Bernadotte af Wisborg, married (1) Erica Patzek, no children, divorced (2) Sonja Robbert, had one son, divorced (3) married Marianne Lindberg, no children\n\nPrince Bertil, Duke of Halland (1912 – 1997), married Lillian Davies, no issue\n\nPrince Carl Johan, Duke of Dalarna (1916 – 2012) later Count Carl Johan, Bernadotte af Wisborg, (1) Kerstin Wijkmark, two adopted children; (2) Countess Gunilla Wachtmeister af Johannishus, no issue; was the last surviving great-grandchild of Queen Victoria\n\nThe infant princess was christened Ingrid Victoria Sofia Louise Margareta on May 5, 1910, at the Royal Chapel in the Royal Palace of Stockholm. Her godparents were:\n\nKing Gustav V of Sweden (her paternal grandfather)\n\nQueen Victoria of Sweden (her paternal grandmother, born Victoria of Baden)\n\nDowager Queen Sofia of Sweden (her paternal great-grandmother, born Sofia of Nassau)\n\nPrince Arthur, Duke of Connaught (her maternal grandfather)\n\nDuchess of Connaught (her maternal grandmother, born Louise Margaret of Prussia)\n\nDowager Grand Duchess of Baden (her paternal great-grandmother, born Princess Louise of Prussia)\n\nGrand Duchess of Baden (born Hilda of Luxembourg)\n\nDowager Duchess of Dalarna (born Therese of Saxe-Altenburg, widow of the youngest son of King Oscar I of Sweden)\n\nAlexandra Feodorovna, Empress of Russia (first cousin of her mother, born Alix of Hesse and by Rhine)\n\nPrincess Alexander of Teck (her mother’s first cousin Princess Alice of Albany)\n\nPrince Adalbert of Prussia (her mother’s first cousin once removed)\n\nThe Prince of Wales (her mother’s first cousin, who became King George V of the United Kingdom the next day)\n\nIn 1920, when Ingrid’s mother was eight months pregnant with her sixth child, she underwent mastoid surgery. An infection developed which killed Crown Princess Margaret, at the age of 38, and her unborn child on May 1, 1920. Ten-year-old Ingrid and four brothers ranging in age from three to fourteen years old were left motherless. In 1923, Ingrid’s father married Lady Louise Mountbatten, daughter of Prince Louis of Battenberg (later Louis Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Milford Haven) and Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. The couple remained childless and became King and Queen of Sweden in 1950.\n\nIngrid was well educated and studied history, art history, and political science, and learned several languages. Her knowledge of art and culture was enhanced by long stays in Paris and Rome. Along with her father, stepmother, and brother Prince Bertil, Ingrid took a five-month journey through the Middle East in 1934-35.\n\nOn March 15, 1935, Ingrid became engaged to Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, her third cousin. The couple was married at Stockholm Cathedral (Storkyrkan) in Stockholm, Sweden on May 24, 1935.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Wedding of Frederik IX and Ingrid of Sweden\n\nIngrid and Frederik had three daughters:\n\nQueen Margrethe II of Denmark (born 1940), married Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, had two sons\n\nPrincess Benedikte (born 1944), married Richard, 6th Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, had one son and two daughters\n\nPrincess Anne-Marie (born 1946), married King Constantine II of Greece, had three sons and two daughters\n\nCrown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Ingrid lived at Frederik VIII’s Palace at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen. Ingrid quickly learned Danish and came especially to love Jutland, where Gråsten Palace became their summer home. During World War II, Ingrid took a very critical attitude towards Nazism. The popularity of the Danish royal family increased because they remained in Denmark despite the German occupation and stayed visible to the Danish people. Unaccompanied by a groom, Ingrid’s father-in-law King Christian X took a daily ride on his horse through Copenhagen, and Ingrid was often seen riding her bicycle or pushing her eldest daughter Margrethe in her carriage through the streets of Copenhagen.\n\nOn April 20, 1947, King Christian X died and Ingrid’s husband acceded to the throne as King Frederik IX. Queen Ingrid reformed some outdated practices at court and created a more relaxed atmosphere. She was interested in gardening and art, and, after researching the original appearance of Gråsten Palace, she oversaw the renovations there.\n\nKing Frederik IX died on January 14, 1972, and his eldest daughter became Queen Margrethe II, the first female monarch of Denmark since Queen Margrethe I, ruler of the Scandinavian countries in 1375–1412 during the Kalmar Union. That same year Ingrid was appointed Regent, the representative of her daughter when she was absent from the country. Since the Constitution of 1871, only the Crown Prince had been allowed to act as Regent in the absence of the Monarch. Ingrid had long been a patron of many social organizations, positions which she eventually left to her middle daughter Princess Benedikte as the years passed.\n\nAbove photo: Queen Ingrid kissing the bride at the 1999 wedding of her granddaughter Princess Alexia of Greece\n\nOn November 7, 2000, at Fredensborg Palace, Queen Ingrid died at the age of 90, surrounded by her three daughters and her ten grandchildren. She was buried beside her husband outside of Roskilde Cathedral.\n\nYouTube: Queen Ingrid’s Funeral\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
