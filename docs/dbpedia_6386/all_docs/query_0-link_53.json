The choice was between the steam engine and the diesel engine, the former costs almost double. I walked up to the ticket counter to buy my ticket and was transported back to the old days of Indian Railways. I was handed over a form where I had to fill in all possible details and then a hand-written ticket was handed over to me. I almost asked—don’t you have the punch marked cardboard square ticket? But, the railway official was not in a mood to answer.\n\nThere was still time for the joy ride, so I walked around the railway station—one of the very few stations that service narrow gauge locomotive. The UNESCO World Heritage Site signboard never let me forget that I was at a world heritage spot. They presented the well-preserved photographs of the old version of Darjeeling station, which looked far grander than the present version. It spoke about the loops and zigzag technology used to negotiate the steep Himalayan slopes. It gave a glimpse of the life in Darjeeling in late 19th century. Across the road was the loco shed, where the steam engines were being prepared for the journey. They were a beauty to watch. When it rolled into the station, everyone had their mouths open in awe. It was like watching a piece of history walking in. It came in slowly, allowed the railway operators to fill its belly with coal, left a lot of steam and was ready to pull the three coaches attached to it. Diesel engine had fewer tantrums; it walked like a well-behaved child and was ready to take us on a joy ride.\n\nThe narrow gauge track on which the joy ride train goes from Darjeeling to Ghum is a part of the road that connects the two cities just about 7 km apart. The road is shared by the heritage train, cars, trucks, bikes and of course, pedestrians. As my train pulled out of the station, my heart skipped a beat as I was about live one of my dreams—journey on the Toy Train. As the train took to the tracks on the road, we saw people making way for the train. People moved back into their houses or shops, cars and pedestrians stopped to let the train pass at some places while moved along with the train at other places.\n\nThere’s a valley on the right, which was hardly visible due to the presence of various structures. Only at some places did the valley make an appearance. The left side of the train runs closer to the hill-slope or the buildings that exist on the face of the hill. At places, it is so close that no part of your body would dare to step even an inch out of the train. You see people stepping inside their homes or pushing their wares inside to clear the train's path. Children, as always, waved at us; they were the only ones who did not see us as an interruption in their routine activities. It is like the whole town was adjusting to let you enjoy your joy ride.\n\nMy thoughts wandered to the days when the track was laid and with engineers innovating to make a track on steep Himalayan slopes, and when local labour laid these narrow tracks that would eventually change the fate of Darjeeling for a long time to come. A few minutes later, I was to reach Ghum station, where I read about the socio-cultural changes that the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway brought when it connected the plains of Siliguri to hills of Darjeeling. I thought about the urge or will to live in the hills that led to the creation of this rail link. Way back in 1881, it wouldn’t have been an easy task to conceive it or execute it.\n\nWhile I was still thinking, the train made a stop at Batasia Loop—a railway track loop created to manage the steep gradient of the hill. There exists a war memorial here in the midst of manicured gardens. A railway board proudly announces the association of Darjeeling Rail with Bollywood with a display of posters of films that have been filmed here. On a clear day, you can see the mighty Kangchenjunga. On the edge, the telescope-wallahs (vendors) line up to give you a closer view of the Himalayan range. I later saw the railway tracks on Batasia Loop where a morning bazaar is held with vendors selling everything, from hand-woven gloves to sweaters.\n\nAfter a 10 minute photo-op—yes, we were all busy clicking pictures and more importantly selfies with the train—we headed to Ghum where a colourful station awaited us. We roamed around the station, read another set of information for this UNESCO World Heritage Site before exploring the museum on the first floor of the station. The museum is housed in a single hall, displaying a collection of old railway mementos such as old tickets, logos of the railways over the years, paintings depicting the Darjeeling Rail and old equipment. The corridor outside the hall was covered with information stating what UNESCO listing means. I could not leave this iconic station without having a cup of railway station chai (tea). The cloud around the station provided a perfect companionship for the garam chai (hot tea).\n\nThe steam engine chugged out of Ghum station followed by the diesel engine. As soon as we were back on the road, I realised I am on the same side of the track as I was on the upward journey. It was time to sit back and enjoy the last leg of the joy ride, living a long-standing dream. Considering the fun and excitement that one encounters during the Toy Train ride, I seriously think that Darjeeling Himalayan Railway or for that matter, the mountain railways of India, including the Kalka-Shimla Railway and the Nilgiri Mountain Railway, should be on every traveller’s to-do list.\n\nHere is a list of some of the coolest things to do in Darjeeling.\n\nend of article\n\nAlso Read"
