        "text": "Jhargram royal palace\n\nKolkata has traditionally been known as a ‘City of Palaces’. While the sobriquet is undoubtedly justified, it runs the risk of ignoring the hundreds of other palaces that West Bengal boasts of. Truth to tell, this is a ‘state of palaces’, many of which Kolkatans know next to nothing about. What’s more, many of them have been converted into beautiful heritage hotels and resorts, where you can spend an absolutely splendid weekend. This is part of the ‘Rajbari Hotel’ phenomenon, which has rapidly gained ground in West Bengal.\n\nOne of the foremost on the list has to be Jhargram royal palace, the ancestral seat of the Malla Deb dynasty, about 160 km from Kolkata. Part of the property is now a heritage hotel run by West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd, called the Jhargram Rajbari Tourism Project. About three km from the railway station, the palace continues to house descendants of the Malla Deb kings, but some parts of it are open to visitors, with prior permission. The main building is an extravagant Italianate structure, set amidst carefully designed lawns and gardens. The palace as a whole evokes several memories of the past, and the complex is also instantly recognizable from several popular Bengali films, such as ‘Sannyasi Raja’ and ‘Durgeshgorer Guptadhan’.\n\nAmadpur Rajbari\n\nAmadpur Rajbari is a nearly 375-year-old heritage property in the village of Amadpur in Purba Bardhaman, about two hours or 90 km from Kolkata by car along the Durgapur Expressway. The nearest railway station is the busy town of Memari, about four km away, though Amadpur itself is a typically beautiful and serene Bengali village.\n\nThe palace is the property of the Chaudhuri family, whose ancestors lived in Malda or Murshidabad, from where Krishna Ram Sen Sharma, who was conferred the title of ‘Chaudhuri’, came to Amadpur after he was granted the zamindari of Amadpur along with other areas of Bardhaman and Hooghly districts by the Mughal Emperor in the mid-17th century.\n\nThe renovated structure boasts high ceilings, elegant verandahs and ancient furniture, all of which make your stay a memorable one, alongside the lovely traditional Bengali food.\n\nBari Kothi Heritage hotel\n\nThen you have the Bari Kothi Heritage hotel in Azimganj, Murshidabad, an approximately six-hour drive from Kolkata, on the banks of the stunning river Bhagirathi. The mansion was owned by the Dudhoria Raj family of Azimganj in the late 1700s, and is a magnificent mix of Greek, Roman and French architecture. The luxury heritage hotel promises not just a super comfortable stay in its Heritage Suites, Royal Heritage Suites and Maharaja Heritage Suites, but a complete experience of the vibrant culture of Murshidabad and its little known ‘Sheherwali Heritage’, a traditionally Jain way of life.\n\nMahisadal Rajbari\n\nMahishadal Rajbari is less than a three-hour drive from Kolkata, a distance of about 100 km. Mahishadal actually has more than one ‘rajbari’, though only the one known as Phool Bagh has been converted into a hotel. The history of Mahishadal’s zamindari families date back to the reign of Akbar, when Kalyan Roy Chowdhury was the first to be bestowed the title of ‘Raja’ with Mahishadal and its adjoining areas under his jurisdiction. In the mid-16th century, when the Roy Chowdhurys defaulted on taxes, the zamindari was handed over to Janardan Upadhyay, who had arrived in Bengal from Uttar Pradesh as an official of the Mughal court.\n\nEven later, the zamindari went to the Garg family, when the male lineage of the Upadhyay family ended. The Phool Bagh palace, constructed in 1926, has long been a favourite with Bengal’s filmmakers, and its rooms offer a glimpse into the grand lifestyle of Mahishadal’s former rulers. The accommodation is fairly limited, with two rooms capable of accommodating about eight people, but the experience is a unique one nonetheless.\n\nBawali Rajbari\n\nRajbari Bawali is already a fairly well known property located around two hours from Kolkata in the small village of Bawali in South 24 Parganas, now a sprawling heritage resort on a zamindari which once belonged to the Mondal family. No longer inhabited by the family, the huge, magnificent palace with extensive lawns was converted into a heritage hotel with all modern amenities by Kolkata-based businessman Ajay Rawla.\n\nItachuna Rajbari\n\nSimilarly,Itachuna Rajbari is also located barely two-and-a-half hours from Kolkata in Chinsurah subdivision of Hooghly district, and is also called the Bargi Danga. The mansion was built by the Kundan family, originally from Maharashtra, in 1766. The Kundans are descended from the Bargi, the Maratha soldiers who conducted regular attacks on the Bengal countryside. Having settled in Bengal, the Kundans became Kundus.\n\nIn the modern era, the palace has become familiar as the shooting location for several Hindi and Bengali films such as Lootera, Poran Jaye Jolia Re, and Rajmahal. The red and yellow of the main building, and the adjoining mud huts, make for an interesting ambience. The 200-year-old palace has five courtyards, and its rooms boast antique caskets, ornate wooden décor and many other artefacts from the past. The rooms have quaint Bengali names like Boro Boudi, Chhoto Boudi, Thakuma, Boro Pishi, Kaka Babu and Jyatha Moshai.\n\nFor details of all these locations and their principal attractions, contact\n\nWest Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd\n\nDG Block, Sector-II, Salt Lake\n\nKolkata 700091\n\nPhone: (033) 2358 5189, Fax: 2359 8292\n\nEmail: visitwestbengal@yahoo.co.in, mdwbtdc@gmail.com, dgmrwbtdc@gmail.com\n\nFor a nature buff, the mere opportunity to spend time among rare species of flora and fauna co-existing in their natural habitat is a dream come true. One’s appreciation for ‘God’s hand’ tends to grow profoundly when one spends time away from all the chaos, in the midst of the unbridled natural beauty and wonders of our planet.\n\nLocated in Jalpaiguri district of West Bengal, Bhutanghat is situated in the mountainous terrain along the river Raidak near the Indo-Bhutan border and is around 45 km from Alipurduar. Known for its pristine evergreen forests, rolling tea gardens and mesmerizing natural beauty, this picturesque little hamlet is home to many rare animals, including the one-horned Asiatic rhino, leopards and spotted deer, making it a must-visit offbeat destination for all wildlife aficionados.\n\nThe Aranya Tourism Property (earlier Jaldapara Tourist Lodge) provides an excellent base from where you can take in all the surrounding attractions, including Chilapata forest. Located just about an hour’s drive from Buxa (approximately 50 km), the splendid property offers plentiful accommodation at extremely reasonable rates.\n\nAn extension of the Buxa Tiger Reserve, Bhutanghat serves as an elephant corridor and has earned the popular sobriquet of ‘Elephant Country’. But that is not all that you will find in terms of exotic wildlife. Watch out for a glimpse of the rhinoceros, different types of deer such as chital, reptiles like the Royal python, bison, dhole (Indian wild dogs), civets, giant squirrels, bears, clouded leopard, and antelopes.\n\nAlso located close to Bhutanghat is the Narathali Lake, which is every bird watcher’s paradise, serving as the natural habitat for many migratory and endemic bird species like the pied hornbill, black stork, ibis bills, red star, migratory teal and minivet.\n\nImage Courtesy : North Bengal Tourism\n\nBhutanghat can be visited all year, but is mostly preferred during the monsoon season or just thereafter by tourists (mid-June to mid-September) when nature is at its finest. If you wish to spend the night in Bhutanghat, you can opt for the Jayanti or Hatiphota forest bungalows, which offer a fantastic view of the valley and mountain peaks, while their watchtowers provide a panoramic glimpse of the rich biodiversity of the region.\n\nFor further information on Bhutanghat and surrounding areas, do contact:\n\nWest Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd.\n\nUdayachal Tourist Lodge\n\nDG Block (1st floor), Sec II, Salt Lake, Kolkata – 700091\n\nPhone: 033 2358 5189\n\nEmail: visitwestbengal@yahoo.co.in, mdwbtdc@gmail.com, dgmrwbtdc@gmail.com\n\nWebsite: https://www.wbtdcl.com/\n\nFor those who don’t know this already, at an altitude of 3,636 m (roughly 11,000 ft) above sea level, Sandakphu is the highest peak in West Bengal, located in Darjeeling’s Singalila Ridge, on the West Bengal-Nepal border. Sandakphu is on the edge of the Singalila National Park and has a small village near its summit. But the real magic of Sandakphu is that four of the world’s five highest mountain peaks, namely Everest, Kangchenjunga, Lhotse and Maka-lu, can be seen once you have gained its peak.\n\nThink about that for a minute – a view of four 8,000 m-plus peaks, along with their ranges. Not for nothing is the Phalut-Sandakphu trek among the most popular in the world. Indeed, it is one of the few treks on earth to offer you a view of so many spectacular mountain ranges. It is also one of India’s oldest trekking trails.\n\nOnce again for the benefit of those who are unaware, the best possible way to gain this peak is to trek there, which most people begin from Maneybhanjan, the base of Singalila range where the trek actually begins for Sandakphu, and then onward to Phalut. Maneybhanjan is a small village, about 26 km from Darjeeling and roughly 90 km from Siliguri. Adequate local transport is available from both places.\n\nIncidentally, Phalut is the second highest peak in West Bengal, and is also located inside the Singalila National Park. The indigenous tribes who live near Phalut are called ‘Phalutians’. For centuries, they have worshipped the peak as a deity, calling it ‘Omna Re Ay’.\n\nThe Sandakphu trek is open for about eight months of the year, except the monsoon months of May to August. Depending on your weather preferences, you can do the trek in spring-summer, autumn, or winter. Should you choose winter, you must prepare for sub-zero tem-peratures, though the snowfall is usually very mild. And in spring-summer, your view of the mountains may not always be crystal clear owing to cloud cover, but the glorious infestation of rhododendrons, silver firs, and magnolias along the trail provide more than adequate com-pensation. In fact, every season offers its own unique landscape and views, so you are faced with a problem of plenty.\n\nThere are quite a few options when it comes to the route you take, but the average time taken for the entire stretch is five to six days, though you can always shorten this according to your convenience. The good thing here is that since there are no technically difficult sections on the Sandakphu-Phalut trek, it is equally suitable for beginners and seasoned trekkers alike.\n\nBefore we forget, an added attraction of Sandakphu is the magnificent River Teesta, which flows by at a roaring pace. The Teesta offers great options for adventure sports, especially river rafting.\n\nHow to get there\n\nBy air: Daily flights are available to Bagdogra, which is the nearest airport. From Bagdogra, you can take a bus or cab direct to Sandakphu. Or you could stop at Darjeeling, and then go on when you are ready.\n\nBy train: The nearest train station is New Jalpaiguri, with links to several routes. From NJP, a cab will take you to Sandakphu.\n\nBy road: You could take a bus from Kolkata to Siliguri, from where another bus will take you to Maneybhanjan, via Sukhiapokhri. SUVs are also available from Darjeeling to Maneybhan-jan.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nYou can stay at MEGHBALIKA TOURISM PROPERTY earlier Darjeeling Tourist Lodge, where one can have a spectacular view of the mountain from this vantage point.\n\nSeveral tour operators run the Sandakphu trek, and they have tents or camps situated along the trail. But even without a tent, you can stop at multiple tea houses along the way, which offer food and lodging for the night.\n\nFor further details, contact\n\nWest Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd.\n\nUdayachal Tourist Lodge\n\nDG Block (1st floor), Sec II, Salt Lake,Kolkata700091\n\nPhone: 033 2358 5189\n\nEmail: visitwestbengal@yahoo.co.in, mdwbtdc@gmail.com, dgmrwbtdc@gmail.com\n\nDepartment of Tourism,\n\nGovernment of West Bengal\n\nNew Secretariat Building\n\n1, K.

When we say ‘a river’, however, we actually mean three. Because three rivers – Hooghly, Rupnarayan, and Damodar – meet here, at two different points, and then flow on toward the sea as the Hooghly.\n\nA fisherman’s tale\n\nGadiara is fairly close to Kolkata, as you can imagine, a mere 85 km or so. And a very fine destination it is, too. The river is broad and brimming with clean, flowing water. The riverbank is lined with beautiful trees which offer ample shade should you wish to merely sit beneath them and stare at the churning waters. For the activity-oriented tourist, there’s always a boat ride down the Hooghly. And you can actually see three differently coloured streams as the three rivers meet and merge. Before you get into that boat, however, you should know that owing to the confluence of the three rivers, the currents here are particularly strong. Moreover, the occasional waves created by larger vessels will quite literally rock the boat, so your boat ride could well turn into an adventure.\n\nSailing through\n\nFor history enthusiasts, a visit to the old fort built by Robert Clive is a must visit, as is the old lighthouse. To be fair, however, almost nothing remains of Clive’s Fort Mornington apart from a few brick walls, thanks to riverine erosion.\n\nA ferry will take you across the river to Geonkhali, once again a charming destination which granta you access to Mahishadal Rajbari, and the ancient city of Tamralipta (Tamluk), though the palace, too, is more or less in ruins. One other attraction is the ancient Bargabheema Temple.\n\nThe solitary sailor\n\nHow to get there\n\nPlenty of options from Kolkata. Once train services resume post the Covid-19 lockdown, you can catch a train to Bagnan, and travel onward by bus. Or you could take a bus from Kolkata itself. And if you have your own conveyance, nothing like a road trip all the way to Nurpur, from where a launch will take you around Gadiara and Geonkhali.\n\nRoopmanjari Tourism Property, Gadiara\n\nWhere to stay\n\nShould you wish to spend more than a day, and we would heartily recommend a weekend trip, there’s the riverside Roopmanjari Tourism Property (earlier Rupnarayan Tourist Lodge) run by the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd. For bookings and other details, contact\n\nWest Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd\n\nDG Block, Sector-II, Salt Lake\n\nKolkata 700091\n\nPhone: (033) 2358 5189, Fax: 2359 8292\n\nEmail: visitwestbengal@yahoo.co.in, mdwbtdc@gmail.com, dgmrwbtdc@gmail.com\n\nAradhana (1969)\n\nIn November 2019, actors Dev and Paoli Dam were in Darjeeling, shooting for their Bengali film ‘Sanjhbati’, which eventually had a world television premiere in October 2020, amidst the Covid pandemic. As delighted locals and tourists thronged the shooting spot at Darjeeling Chowrasta, it was heard that actors Rajat Kapoor and Mumtaz Sorcar were also shooting at nearby Takdah Cantonment, in Rangli Rangliot CD block of Darjeeling Sadar subdivision. Incidentally, Takdah (sometimes spelt as Tukda or Tukdah) is rapidly gaining in popularity as a tourist destination. What’s more, Takdah also hosted a shoot with actors Taapsee Pannu and Ravi Mohan in November 2019.\n\nKanchenjungha (1962)\n\nOur point is that Darjeeling, a highly popular shooting destination for Bollywood and Tollywood alike for decades, seems to be making a comeback on the silver screen. ‘Comeback’, because the political agitation in the hills had been keeping film crews away, a fear that the West Bengal Tourism Department has been working hard to alleviate. Thankfully, the department’s efforts seem to be paying off, as more and more film crews scout in and around Darjeeling for suitable locations.\n\nSagina Mahato (1970)\n\nWith the return of the tinsel town brigade, Darjeeling could once again become popular on the film tourism map, too. As many who have been to Darjeeling over the years will testify, it used to be customary for tourist guides to take their charges around the various popular shooting locations in town. And there were many of these on display, considering that among the earliest Bollywood productions to be shot in Darjeeling was Barsaat (1949). After a brief lull, there was a positive deluge in the 1960s, with Jab Pyar Kisise Hota Hai (1961), Kanchenjungha (1962), Professor (1962), Hariyali Aur Raasta (1962), China Town (1962), Aye Din Bahaar Ke (1966), Hamraaz (1967), Baharon Ki Manzil (1968), Jhuk Gaya Asmaan (1968), Mahal (1969), and Aradhana (1969).\n\nSanjhbati (2019)\n\nAlso read : Kagey, the village with a view\n\nIn the 1970s, the most notable Hindi film to be shot in Darjeeling was Tapan Sinha’s Sagina Mahato (1970), remade in Hindi as Sagina (1974), though a major part of both films was shot in Kurseong, near Darjeeling. Then there was Amitabh Bachchan’s Do Anjaane (1976), and Shakti Samanta’s Anurodh (1979), an adaptation of the Bengali hit Deya Neya. Lahu Ke Do Rang (1979) was entirely shot in Darjeeling.\n\nKahaani 2 (2016)\n\nThe 1980s and 90s were relatively idle, with the occasional Barsaat Ki Ek Raat/ Anusandhan (1982) and Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman (1992). But the 2000s and 2010s saw a revival, with such large-scale productions as Mr and Mrs Iyer (2002), Main Hoon Na (2004), Parineeta (2005), Via Darjeeling (2008), Barfi (2012), Kahaani 2 (2016), and Jagga Jasoos (2016). And that’s just Bollywood. We haven’t touched Tollywood simply because the list is too long! Had the Covid pandemic not thrown a spanner in the works, it is quite possible that 2020 would have seen quite a bit of shooting in Darjeeling, too.\n\nBarfi (2012)\n\nNow that we have put all this in a nutshell for you, all that you have to do is make that trip and see it all for yourselves. By air, you can fly from Kolkata to Bagdogra and complete the rest of the journey by road. By train, the easiest way to get to Darjeeling is to board a train at Howrah or Sealdah, alight at New Jalpaiguri, and go on by road. Or you could simply drive all the way from Kolkata, covering a distance of 617 km, which would take approximately 20 hours, with adequate stops along the way.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation runs the beautiful Meghbalika Tourism Property (formerly Darjeeling Tourist Lodge) which offers excellent accommodation at extremely reasonable rates. You need to get in touch with WBTDCL for reservations and clarifications, and here’s how you can do that:\n\nWest Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd.\n\nUdayachal Tourist Lodge\n\nDG Block (1st floor), Sec II, Salt Lake, Kolkata – 700091\n\nPhone: 033 2358 5189\n\nEmail: visitwestbengal@yahoo.co.in, mdwbtdc@gmail.com, dgmrwbtdc@gmail.com\n\nWebsite: https://www.wbtdcl.com/\n\nDighali Tourism Property I is a mere five-minute walk from the beach\n\nOne of West Bengal’s most popular tourist destinations, Digha in Purba Medinipur is indeed the Brighton of the east, for those who have heard of the famed English beach resort. There are several reasons behind the enduring popularity of Digha, but the principal factor is probably its accessibility from Kolkata, mostly by road, but also by rail.\n\nThe invigorating sea breeze, a walk along the beach at New Digha, browsing around the shops at old Digha, and snacking on fried fish on the promenade… all of it while staying at Dighali Tourism Property I (formerly Digha Tourist Lodge) run by the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation, along with its sister property, Dighali Tourism Property II.\n\nThose with first hand experience will know that the seaside is particularly beautiful in the monsoons, and Dighali Tourism Property I is a mere five-minute walk from the beach. So, provided it isn’t raining too hard, you can slip out for a walk any time.\n\nOriginally known as Beerkul during the time of Governor-General Warren Hastings (1772-85), Digha was ‘discovered’ by the British in the late 18th century, and Hastings himself described it as the ‘Brighton of the East’ in one of his letters to his wife.\n\nEnglish businessman John Frank Smith reportedly began living here in 1923, and his writings provided further exposure to what was originally a seaside village. In the 1950s, Smith convinced West Bengal Chief Minister Bidhan Chandra Roy to develop Digha as a beach resort. Today, an old church can still be seen near the Old Digha Main gate.\n\nDighali Tourism Property I is located close to most of Digha’s other principal attractions too, and offers 28 AC rooms, ranging from standard double rooms to second-floor suites. These suites offer a fantastic view of the sea, though the ground-floor rooms look out onto the casuarina plantations which line the beach, impeding a direct view of the sea. All rooms have private balconies, as well as all modern amenities. There is also an expansive green lawn decorated with lovely flowers and seasonal plants, with a play area for children. The property’s multi-cuisine restaurant looks out onto the beachfront.\n\nTake in the beach at New Digha (2 km), and its Science Centre set up by the National Council of Science Museums. Also nearby is the fascinating Marine Aquarium and Research Centre, established in 1989 with the objective of displaying the marine biodiversity of the region and making people aware of its importance, as well as conducting research activities.\n\nYet another popular destination is the Chandaneswar Shiva Temple about 8 km away, close to the border with Odisha, and the Jagannath Deul at Dihibahiri about an hour and 15 minutes by road, where you can see the beautiful 16th-century shrine to the deity built by king Bhimsen Mahapatra of Odisha.\n\nDigha can also be your base for day trips to nearby seaside locations like Shankarpur (15 km), Tajpur (19 km), and Mandarmani (30 km).\n\nDighali Tourism Property I is 182 km southwest of Kolkata by road, with the journey taking about five hours. There are government and private buses leaving at frequent intervals from various points in Kolkata, including the Dharmatala bus terminus. You may also drive down in your own or a hired vehicle.\n\nFor those wishing to make a train journey, there are a number of options from Howrah, including the Digha Duronto Express. The journey takes about three hours, and Dighali Tourism Property I is literally just 15 minutes from Digha railway station.\n\nKurseong is one of the oldest municipalities in West Bengal\n\nKurseong, whether in the sun or in the rains, is an experience worth writing a book about, as anyone who has been there will tell you. And your visit will only be made more memorable by a stay at the poetically named Roudra Chhaya Tourism Property (formerly Kurseong Tourist Lodge), run by the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation (WBTDCL). The already beautiful property is made even more attractive by its restaurant, which offers a clear view of the world’s third highest peak, Mount Kanchenjunga. As a bonus, the restaurant serves the gorgeously flavoured and world renowned Makaibari tea along with another of its specialties, mouthwatering momos.\n\nNot many perhaps know this, but Kurseong is one of the oldest municipalities in West Bengal. It became an independent municipality in 1879, and did not become a subdivision until 1890, when Darjeeling was formed as a separate district. Today, Kurseong town and municipality remain part of Darjeeling district, and the town also functions as the headquarters of Kurseong subdivision.\n\nBlessed with pleasant weather throughout the year, Kurseong is 34 km from Siliguri, connected both by road and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, or the famous toy train. The nearest airport is Bagdogra and the nearest major railway station is New Jalpaiguri. Nestled among the lower Himalayas and famed for schools such as Goethals, Kurseong offers plenty of natural beauty, particularly its waterfalls or ‘kholas’. That apart, it is close to such world renowned tea gardens as Makaibari and Castleton, which are important names on West Bengal’s tea tourism trail.\n\nFor Bengalis, Kurseong is also memorable as the town where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was interned by the British in the late 1930s. The Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Museum and NSC Bose Institute of Asiatic Studies were later set up in a house belonging to Netaji’s elder brother Sarat Chandra Bose in the Giddhapahar area. The museum displays priceless artefacts related to Netaji’s life, including photocopies of letters between Netaji and his future wife, Emilie Schenkel, rare photographs of the Indian National Army (INA), and other memorabilia.\n\nIn order to truly enjoy all of this, you must stay at Roudra Chhaya Tourism Property for a few days, if only to enhance your Kurseong experience with the Makaibari tea and momos. In fact, so popular has the wooden-floored restaurant become that its 40 seats are quite often occupied by guests not even staying at the property. With a floor area of 57 sq m, it is open for service from 8.00 am to 8.00 pm, and at a per head cost of only Rs 300, offers delicious fare at extremely reasonable rates.\n\nKurseong is 53 km from New Jalpaiguri junction, from where plenty of cars/jeeps are available. You can also travel from Darjeeling on the toy train, available twice a day. For those wishing to fly, the nearest airport to Kurseong is Bagdogra, about 40 km away.\n\nFor bookings and more details, do contact:\n\nWest Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd.\n\nUdayachal Tourist Lodge\n\nDG Block (1st floor), Sec II, Salt Lake, Kolkata – 700091\n\nPhone: 033 2358 5189 Email: visitwestbengal@yahoo.co.in, mdwbtdc@gmail.com, dgmrwbtdc@gmail.com\n\nDiamond Harbour is a mere 50 km from Kolkata\n\nWhat exactly does one do in Diamond Harbour? You may well ask if you have never been there. As is fairly common with people in general, we often end up ignoring attractions to which we have easy access. And since Diamond Harbour is a mere 50 km from Kolkata, many of us have probably never taken it seriously as a destination. However, take our advice and spend a weekend at this old riverside town. You will come away refreshed and charmed.\n\nLocated on the eastern bank of the River Hooghly at the confluence of the river and the Bay of Bengal, Diamond Harbour is a popular weekend destination, and the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation’s Sagarika Tourism Property boasts of the best location of all the accommodation options in the area, with all 36 of its rooms offering a panoramic view of the river.\n\nIf you choose to stay at Sagarika, you will have the luxury of lazing around in the spacious balcony attached to your room and gazing at the ships, trawlers and boats entering Kolkata and Haldia ports. The sunset too is spectacular from the rooms.\n\nLocated close to the Gangasagar delta, Diamond Harbour was formerly known as Hajipur, and given its present name by the British. It is here that the River Hooghly bends southward on its way to the sea. On the other side of the river is Haldia, to which you can take a ferry, and the road along the huge expanse of sparkling water is worth driving down any day.\n\nDiamond Harbour was an important area for 16th and 17th-century Portuguese river pirates, the ‘harmad’ as they were called in Bengal. Even today, the ruins of Chingrikhali Fort, reportedly built in the 16th century by said pirates, are a must visit whenever you are in the area. Tourists also visit the Sarisha Ramakrishna Mission Ashram. Not to be missed is an old lighthouse, which offers a panoramic view of the entire area. Or you could simply sit on the riverbank and watch the boats. Or have a picnic if you wish, because a more ideal spot for a picnic would be hard to find.\n\nThe fully air-conditioned Sagarika has standard and deluxe rooms as well as suites, and the rooms provide absolute calmness and tranquillity, though they are equipped with all modern amenities including free wifi, intercom, TV, electric kettles, and geysers. Sagarika also has a wonderful tavern and an AC restaurant, which serves delicious meals, especially fish.\n\nIf you are there for the weekend, you could take in the township of Joynagar, about 15 km away. Joynagar is primarily famous for housing ancient manuscripts and stone idols linked to Lord Mahavira, Lord Buddha and Lord Vishnu. You may also make trips to nearby destinations such as Bakkhali, Raidighi, Gangasagar and Kakdwip.\n\nHow to get there\n\nSagarika Tourism Property is 46 km from Kolkata by road, and about 1.5 hours from Sealdah station by train. Once you get off at Diamond Harbour station, the property is just a three-minute drive away.\n\nKnown for its panoramic beauty and lush green tea gardens, North Bengal’s mystical ‘Chamurchi’, located on the Indo-Bhutan border, is every nature lover’s paradise. Situated 60 km from Jalpaiguri, this quaint little hamlet is a relatively less frequented tourist destination, perfect for those wanting to enjoy some quality time surrounded by hills, rivers, charming tropical forests, and pleasantly chilly weather.\n\nOften described as the Gateway to Bhutan, Chamurchi is filled with awe-inspiring biodiversity, picturesque sites, and easy trekking trails. The ‘Musical Stone Cave’, located 3 km from Chamurchi along the banks of the river Diana, is one of the prime attractions of the area. As the name suggests, the cave generates musical tunes when a stone is tossed on the ground.\n\nBound by dense forests like Garuchira, Kalapani and Rohiti, Chamurchi is teeming with rich flora and fauna, and the fortunate tourist can sometimes stumble upon animals like leopards, elephants and gaur (Indian bison). The lush green sprawling tea gardens of Chamurchi are not only picture perfect but also enlightens one about the environment and conservation of nature. Tourists can make a day trip to the Bhutan gate which is one of the eighteen gates that mark the end of the Indian border and the beginning of the Kingdom of Bhutan.\n\nThose wishing to stay in Chamurchi can opt for the lovely eco-houses and camps that provide a breathtaking view of the serene and pristine beauty all around. Although there are multiple options to choose from, the Jalpaiguri Eco Resort is the most sought after for its stunning view of the hills and surrounding forests.\n\nAt around 650 km from Kolkata, Chamurchi can be visited during any time of the year but the best time is November to January, when the skies are clear and offer a stunning view of the spectacular Mt. Kanchenjunga.\n\nIndian one horned rhino\n\nFor most of its lifetime, Gorumara National Park was actually called Gorumara Wildlife Sanctuary. Properly speaking, it ought to have celebrated 70 years as a wildlife sanctuary, and 25 years as a national park, in 2020. Owing to the Covid pandemic, of course, any celebration that may have been planned has obviously been kept on hold.\n\nThe entrance of the Gorumara National Park\n\nBut this provides an excellent excuse to the ordinary tourist to visit this most interesting national park, which began life as a reserve forest in 1895. And which was granted the status of a wildlife sanctuary in 1949, owing to its breeding population of the Indian one-horned rhinoceros. By the mid-1990s, it had become a full-fledged national park, though its area was a mere seven sq km. Since then, it has grown to 80 sq km, which makes it a modest sized national park at best, compared to some others in India.\n\nAnd yet, within this medium-sized radius, Gorumara is home to some of the richest and most di-verse forms of animal and plant life in the country. The park is the habitat of at least 50 species of mammals, more than 190 species of birds, more than 20 species of reptiles, seven species of turtles, more than 25 species of fish, and several other fauna. The only thing lacking, perhaps, are large carnivores, since the only big cat in the park is the leopard. However, the occasional Royal Bengal tiger has been known to stray into its radius.\n\nOther than the rhinoceros which has given the park its fame, the other large herbivores at Gorumara are the gaur (the magnificent Indian bison), Asian elephant, sloth bear, chital (spotted deer), and sambar deer, the last being among the largest of the world’s deer species. That apart, there are smaller herbivores such as the barking deer (Muntjac), hog deer and wild boar. And among the smaller carnivores are various species of civets (called ‘bhaam’ in Bengali), mongooses and small cats. Among reptiles, two of the world’s largest non-venomous and venomous snakes – the Indian python and the King Cobra respectively – are to be found in Gorumara.\n\nGorumara jeep safari\n\nYet another unique feature of Gorumara is its status as a home to rare species, such as the critically endangered pygmy hog and the rare hispid hare. Moreover, there are numerous bird species to brighten up your trip, such as the scarlet minivet, sunbird, Asian paradise flycatcher, spangled drongo, and Indian hornbill, not to mention numerous woodpeckers and pheasants. And living up to its reputation as a sanctuary for rarely seen creatures, Gorumara is on the flight path of the rare brahminy duck, along with other migratory bird species.\n\nOne other remarkable aspect of Gorumara is that it has been largely successful so far in enabling humans and wildlife to cohabit peacefully, without encroaching on each other’s territories. More than 10,000 resident forest villagers belonging mostly to North Bengal’s various ethnic communities earn a livelihood from assisting the Forest Department in its activities, and ecotourism.\n\nThe roadway to the forest\n\nGeographically speaking, the park is located on the floodplains of the Moorti and Raidak rivers, though the major river running through the park is the Jaldhaka, a tributary of the Brahmaputra river system. This makes Gorumara a significant watershed area between the Ganges and Brahmaputra river systems.\n\nHow to get there\n\nThe nearest airport is Bagdogra in Darjeeling district, about 80 km away. The nearest broad gauge train stations are New Maynaguri, New Mal and Chalsa, all in Jalpaiguri. The most Important nearby railway station is New Jalpaiguri, about 42 km to the south of the park. Driving or bussing it all the way from Kolkata is also an option, though the journey will take you nearly 16 hours if not a little more.\n\nMoorti Tourism Property, Murti\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe beautiful Moorti Tourism Property, run by the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd, is just 11 km from Gorumara, offering fully air-conditioned accommodation.
