There are several advantages for plant-derived therapeutics, including wide availability, diverse and synergetic pharmacological actions, and a generally good profile of safety and tolerability. Over the recent years, there have been numerous reports from clinical studies testifying the efficacy and safety of medicinal plants and phytochemicals in ameliorating several human diseases. A plethora of basic studies has also unravelled molecular mechanisms underlying the health benefits of herbal medicines. Nevertheless, issues such as identification of bioactive ingredients, standardization of the products, and drug interactions remain to be further studied. The book Bioprospecting of Tropical Medicinal Plants mainly focuses on the medicinal properties and pharmacological action of natural products, the medicinal plants, and phytochemicals, in different settings ranging from in vitro models to clinical trials. The goal is to present the reader a comprehensive collection on most of the therapeutic aspects of plant-derived natural products and molecular mechanisms thereof. This book will be valuable to biodiversity and conservation researchers, ethnopharmacologist, ethnobiologists, ethnoecologists, naturalists, phytochemists, pharmacists, policymakers, and anybody who cares about the environment. It covers all areas of plant-based medicine evaluation and development, including cultivation, collection, phytochemical and phytopharmacological analysis, and therapeutic potential analysis in clinical trials. The focus is on describing the whole range of evidence-based complementary medicine and bio-analytical techniques used to define botanical products, such as therapeutic traditional knowledge of herbs, phytochemical analysis, pharmacological studies, and hyphenated techniques, among others. The book explains how medicinal plants are used for phytotherapy in world countries. Moreover, this book will aid the bio-prospection of herbal products as well as medication discovery and development based on traditional medicine.

The medicinal potential of plant products’ can be traced back over 5000 years, as the evidence of their use in the treatment of ailments and for body system revitalization are found in India, Egypt, China, Greek and Roman civilizations [2]. In many regions of the world, indigenous peoples’ usage of ethnomedicine as an intrinsic part of their culture has a close relationship with local ecosystems and cultural landscapes. In India, plants with therapeutic potential are widely used as folk remedies in various indigenous medical systems such as Siddha, Ayurveda and Unani as processed pharmaceutical products [3]. Ethnomedicine and traditional knowledge are good examples of disadvantaged populations living in rural places combating even terminal diseases with ancient methods and using herbal treatments [4]. The collection of original data from traditional custodians of such knowledge is necessary in order to acquire a full compilation of medicinal plants that can be employed in disease prevention [5]. Various medicinal weed plants are a serious problem in agriculture and tremendously reduce the productivity of agricultural lands by competing with crop plants for water, mineral nutrients, space and light. Keeping this in view such losses can be compensated by exploring the medicinal utility of weeds. Thus, making use of every medicinal plants widely These authors contributed equally to this work. K.

Furthermore, the extraction and development of various medicines and chemotherapeutics from these plants, as well as from traditionally used rural herbal remedies, has been linked to an increased reliance on medicinal plants in industrialized countries. Northeast Indian states are some of the richest repositories of medicinal and aromatic plants in the world [6]. This region has high medicinal plant diversity due to variance in topography and physiognomy [7]. Nagaland is a part of the Indo-­ Burma mega biodiversity hotspot, which includes an immense variety of plant species and is one of the wealthiest in terms of biological wealth and endemism in the Indian subcontinent [8]. Naga’s are part of the mongoloid race and since time immemorial, forest products have aided in the socio-economic life of the Naga tribes in their ever-growing demands for medicines, food and shelter. They have an inextricable link with their forest and regard it as a provider, guide, healer and protector like most of the North-eastern tribal communities of India. Naga villages encompass parts of the hilly Eastern Himalayas and are secluded from other cities, and hence the local inhabitants developed a sense to rely on indigenous healing knowledge using medicinal plants. However, tribal’s knowledge on therapeutic herbs of northeast India and in particular Nagaland, when compared to the rest of the country is still understudied. Meanwhile, the traditional knowledge is rapidly degrading with the advancement of technology and modernization. During the earlier years, many researchers have contributed to the studies on medicinal plants from in and around Northeast India, Assam [9–11], Manipur [12, 13], Arunachal Pradesh [14–17] and Nagaland [18–24]. However, in contrast to those documented plants focused on the three plant forms (herb, shrub and trees), the present investigation has been chiefly focused on the medicinal herbs prevalent in Nagaland. In concern with the growing awareness and need for medicinal herbs, documentation of plants is of vital importance. As a result, the current study was conducted in the region with the following aims: (1) To document medicinal uses of plants, their relative importance and information for future investigation in novel drug applications and (2) to educate locals about the area’s declining wealth on traditional and medicinal flora.\n\n2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Study Area Nagaland lies in the North-eastern part of India between the latitude of 250 06´ N and 270 04´ N and longitude of 930 20′ E and 950 15′ E. The state covers a geographical area of 16,579 km2 and is bordered by Assam in the northwest, Myanmar and Arunachal Pradesh in the east and Manipur in the south. The state experience a sub-tropical to warm temperate monsoonal climate with four seasons, viz., winter, spring, summer and autumn. Annually, rainfall ranges between 1800 and 2500 mm\n\nEthnobotanical Study of Medicinal Herbs Used by the Naga Tribes of Eastern Himalayas\n\n3\n\nwith July and August receiving the highest rainfall. Temperature may rise from 21 to 36 °C in summer and drops from 21 to 4 °C during winter months. Frost is common at high elevations with snowfall in certain places and strong northwest wind blows across the state with the onset of spring season. About 70% of the state’s economy is dependent on agriculture along with other prominent economic activities including forestry, tourism and miscellaneous cottage industries. The recorded forest cover of the state in 2021 is 8629.30 km2 which is about 52% of its geographical area. Tropical and sub-tropical evergreen forests accounts to one-sixth of the forest area including palms, bamboo and timber and mahogany forests.\n\n2.2 Collection and Identification The phyto-documentation on herbaceous plants and their uses in traditional healing customs by the Naga tribes was conducted in various districts across Nagaland. Random weed samples were collected, and the representative taxa sampled during the field survey were processed for herbarium following Jain and Rao [25] and later identified with the help of standard literature on regional floras [26–28]. Group discussion was held with native herbalist, village elders, old folks, street vendors, farmers and council members to identify the local names, uses and other required descriptions on their medicinal values. Special attention was paid to record information from traditional healers and practitioners having immense knowledge of plants in local dialect and well versed with their therapeutic uses.\n\n3 Results and Discussion The history of medicinal plants is as long as the history of humans. Nagas have been practicing the use of medicinal plants since time immemorial which has been passed down from generation to generation through traditional practices and oral lore. Before Christianity, Nagas practiced Totemism and Animism, which are primarily indulged with worshipping nature. The core principle of this devotion is abided in respecting and preserving nature through rituals and sustainable norms laid down by the village priest. Supplementing such traditions, the practices of therapeutic healing is also associated with the principles and beliefs of the tribes. In the present study, a total of 161 herbaceous plant species belonging to 58 families and 127 genera were documented during the survey. All the recorded herbs have certain medicinal values and have been extensively used by the tribes for treating several diseases and ailments. The collected plant samples arranged in alphabetical order along with their botanical and vernacular names, plant parts used, preparation and purpose/ mode of administration are enumerated in Table 1. The family Asteraceae (24) was reported with the largest number of species followed by Lamiaceae (11), Poaeaea (9), Solanaceae (7), Leguminosae, Polygonaceae, Malvaceae and Rubiaceae (6\n\nAdiantum caudatum L.\n\nAgeratina riparia (Regel) R.M.King & H.Rob.

Most plants were found to grow in wild conditions and very few cultivated. Some weed plants like Bidens pilosa, Cannabis sativa and Datura innoxia have often been used as antiseptics for treating cuts and wounds, burns and skin infections. Some of the common plants like Ageratum conyzoides, A. houstonianum and Spilanthes acmella found in this region are traditionally used as decoction with other therapeutic herbs for treating diarrhoea and as an effective pain reliever against toothache. Invasive plants such as Lantana camara, Chromoleana odorata and Ageratina riparia growing abundantly in kitchen gardens are frequently considered a threat to the native flora but at the same time highly efficient and useful in treating numerous diseases. Rare and endangered species like Paris polyphylla, Panax pseudoginseng and Curculigo orchiodes are known for their ample benefits in treating various diseases and their anticancer properties. The most common plant parts used are the leaves followed by shoots, roots, rhizomes, seeds, flowers and fruits. Many plants were found to possess multiple therapeutic properties in treating different ailments. Leaves of Acacia pinnata, Amphineuron opulatum, Cannabis sativa, Catharanthus roseus, Chloris barbata, Hydrocotyle javanica, Ipomoea quaolit, Rungia pectinata, Centella asiatica, Clerodendrum glandulosum, C. serratum, Commelina benghalensis, Hibiscus syriacus, Phyllanthus fraternus, Pilea microphylla, Polygonum molle and Rumex patientia are used for treating skin infections (cuts, wounds, ringworm, skin ulcers and skin rashes) and insect bites. Leaves of Ricinus communis, Rubus niveus, Tithonia diversifolia and Typha angusta are used for treating menstrual cramps. The tender shoots or aerial parts of Asparagus officinalis, Adiantum caudatum, Asclepias curassavica, Euphorbia hirta and Imperata cylindrica are used for dysentery, de-­ worming, chronic lung diseases. Tender shoots of Cuscuta chinensis and C. reflexa are used in the treatment of urinary tract infection, urinary bladder problems and chronic liver ailments. Rhizome of Acorus calamus, Alpinia malaccensis, Costus spesiocus, Curcuma angustifolia, C. aromatic and Kaemferia rotunda is extensively used as a remedy for treating fever, indigestion and cough. Seeds of Amaranthus spinosus, A. viridis, Entada pursaetha, Hodgsonia macrocarpa, Perilla frutescens and Sesamum orientale are used for constipation, appetizer, skin hydration and hair growth. Flowers of Curculigo capitula and C. orchioides are used for the treatment of conjunctivitis and earache. Fruits(berries) of Psophocarpus tetragonolobus, Solanum gilo, S. nigrum, S. torvum, S. viarum, Zanthoxylum oxyphyllum and Z. rhetsa are used as liver tonic, aids in digestion, maintains blood pressure, reduce fever, appendicitis including warts. Extracts of Eclipta prostrate, Amaranthus spinosus, Persicaria chinensis, Paris polyphylla, Leucas aspera and Impatiens latiflora are used as antidotes against snake and insect bites. Traditionally, the mode of preparation is by using either fresh or dried plant materials depending on the types of ailments the herbs are employed for treatment.\n\nEthnobotanical Study of Medicinal Herbs Used by the Naga Tribes of Eastern Himalayas\n\n21\n\nMost of the plants are processed in different ways like grinding, macerating, paste, juice extracts and decoction in combination with other herbs or ingredients like sorghum oil, pond salt, honey, milk and aromatic local rice. A warm poultice of various medicinal herbs with sorghum oil is also applied to get relief from muscle cramp, soreness, joint pain, body inflammation, body ache, fever and stomach congestion. The gastronomic culture of Nagas involves in the intake of spicy and fermented foods (bamboo shoots, soyabeans, mustard leaves, pickles, king chilies, etc.) including smoked meat (pork, beef, mutton and wild animals). These habits could have been a key reason for various health issues such as stomach pain, intestinal disorders, asthma, chronic liver disease and lungs infection prevalent within the tribal population. However, with these problems, the Nagas have developed a sense to find sources in treating the associated ailments and thus majority of the plants documented are known to be utilized for treating such gastrointestinal and other associated ailments. In total, 34 herbs were recorded for treating gastrointestinal problems (Acorus calamus, Alpinia malaccensis, Amaranthus spinosus, Asparagus officinalis, Cannabis sativa, Catharanthus roseus, Curcuma aromatic, Colocasia esculenta, Cyperus iria, Datura innoxia, Dicranopteris linearis, Dioscorea alata, Diplazium esculentum, Elatostema sessile, Fagopyrum esculentum, Gomphrena celosioides, Gynura bicolor, Hibiscus syriacus, Hydrocotyle javanica, Kaempferia rotunda, Kalanchoe pinnata, Ocimum sanctum, Imperata cylindrica, Mussaenda macrophylla, Paederia foetida, Polygonum plebium, Pouzolzia hirta, P. zeylanica, Tagetes erecta, Tinospora sinensis, Tithonia diversifolia, Triumfetta pilosa, T. rhomboidea and Typha angusta). From the present study, it is evident that medicinal plants play a vital role in aiding to the health of indigenous people in this region. Many of the tribes in the studied area still depend on the medicinal plants for their daily healthcare routine over the modern system of medicines. But over the years, this system may deteriorate due to the absence of interest among the younger generations as most are influenced by modern technology and their cultural importance are put aside. Moreover, the traditional healing systems are passed down orally and hence detailed information is lost in the process. Therefore, necessary steps should be taken up to encourage the upcoming generations as well as penned down the necessities in proper text for future references. With the help of the government or village councils, robust regulations and management plans should be laid to protect and educate the tribes about the benefits, medicinal purposes and conservation of these valuable herbs.\n\n4 Conclusion The study elucidated a very high number of therapeutic herbs accounting for 161 plants, which is one of the highest recorded data from Northeast India. According to the current research, medicinal herbs will continue to play an essential role as a health aid to the tribal communities of Eastern Himalayas. Traditional healing treatments employing medicinal plants are widely used on a normative basis by the\n\n22\n\nK. Semy and R. Kuotsu\n\nNagas. Furthermore, due to the rising costs of personal health maintenance, herbal therapies have grown more popular in these regions for treating various disorders. However, as a result of developmental activities, deforestation, population growth and indiscriminate exploitation, native medicinal plants are rapidly depleting and have even lead to some plant species being endangered. Therefore, efforts must be geared towards preserving them through sustainable management and enhance the effectiveness, efficacy and rational use of medicinal plants, especially through the integration into national, regional and local health policies and programmes. In situ conservation techniques in home gardens and on-farm cultivation should be encouraged for socio-economic and sustainable growth. Also, these plants can fill the void in the medical sector and become a new trend for upcoming research.

Patil\n\n1 Introduction The word ‘Ethnobotany’ was almost unheard in India in the middle of last century. ‘Society of Ethnobotanists’ is a premier society in India established in 1980, which filliped ethnobotanical studies particularly in India. This activity has well mushroomed and extended over nearly all Indian states and geographical regions inclusive of majority of tribes and rural folks. It is needless to state that, throughout the history of mankind, plants have been a major source of medicine. This central function still is continued worldwide particularly in the regions dominated by the tribal communities and rural folks. The chief value of medicine in commerce in India was stressed by Drury [1]. Prospects on ethnomedicinal studies in India are still bright on account of remarkable phytodiversity and multiethnic culture inhabiting various phytogeographical regions. Such investigations offer tremendous scope for bioprospecting in view of the sustainable development. Even today, medicinal sources are sold in public places by herbal vendors in India. However, their traditional knowledge is hardly documented yet. Probably, Sinha (1996) [2] is the first investigator to tap their wisdom as an exclusive topic of research particularly in and around Delhi. The present authors, therefore, extended inventory to document this much neglected area of research in India, the results of which are being published [3–7]. This communication presents hitherto unprojected source of seeds sold by vendors in northern part of Maharashtra (India).\n\nY. A. Ahirrao S.S.V.P.

The herbal vendors conduct their traditional family business of selling botanicals of medicinal importance. They carry on their business in public places such as railway stations, bus stands, courts, Government offices, highways, crossroads, chowks of cities, pilgrim centres, temples and places of weekly bazar\n\nMap 1 Maharashtra, India\n\nEthnomedicinal Use Reports of Seeds as Tapped from Herbal Vendors in North…\n\n27\n\nMap 2 Nasik, Dhule, Nandurbar, Jalgaon and Buldhana districts in Maharashtra\n\ndays. The vendors were interviewed and their medicinal wisdom like common plant name, part or product used, diseases treated, doses, recipes and their administration, age and sex of the patients to be treated, etc., were recorded. The samples were also purchased and photographed. Botanical identities deciphered consulting various floras like Hooker, 1872–1897; Cooke, 1958; Naik, 1998; Lakshminarsimhan and Sharma, 1951; Patil, 2003; Kshirsagar and Patil, 2008; Diwakar and Sharma, 2002, etc. [8–14] The information obtained is presented in Table 1 with necessary details.\n\n3 Results The present inventory on medicinal use reports of seeds from herbal vendors in some districts of North Maharashtra. It revealed 101 species pertaining to 101 genera and 48 angiospermic families. Majority of them are dicotyledons (94 species, 94 genera and 42 families), whereas monocotyledons contributed for a lesser share (07 species, 07 genera and 06 families). Out of total 101 taxa, 38 species are found to be exclusively under cultivation, whereas 51 species are exclusively wild. Few others (12 species) are either wild or cultivated as well. Of these, 27 species exhibited tree habit, others being shrubs, herbs or climbers. Cultigens are also traditionally useful\n\nAlbizia chinensis (Osb.) Merr. Mimosaceae Alcea rosea L.

A. Ahirrao et al.\n\nfor various miscellaneous purposes, e.g. food, spice, ornamental, oil, shade tree, beauty care, etc. in this region. The 101 species yielding seeds are employed for various 74 human diseases (Table 1). They are administered in various forms of medicinal recipes: (i) powder (72), (ii) paste (25), (iii) decoction (20), (iv) slurry (03), (v) pellates (03), (vi) extract (03), (vii) ash (02), (viii) infusion (02), (ix) pulp (01) and (x) seeds (01). Thus powder is the most common recipes advised by the herbal vendors. Others are important in descending order presented here. The figures in parenthesis denote number of use-reports.\n\n4 Discussion Plants form the basis for most life on earth; however, the field of ‘Botany’ has declined worldwide, while the field of ‘Ethnobotany’ keeps emerging. In this latter missionary activity, India stands at the forefront of nations devoting sustained scientific attention to this discipline of natural science. India has also recognized the danger of the loss of precious traditional knowledge for the benefit of all humanity. Some neglected areas of research in ethnobotany and ethnomedicine are being paid serious attention [15]. One such study is tapping wisdom of herbal vendors who conduct traditional business of selling botanicals of medicinal significance in public places. The review of literature indicated that exclusive ethnomedicinal use reports on specific plant parts are rare in India [7, 15–18]. Mahekar and Yadav [19–22] informed about their ethnomedicinal utilities in Maharashtra as obtained from herbal vendors. Recently, there are also few exclusive reports on ethnomedicine by Patel and Parekh [23] and Kalim et al [24]. The present authors worked on this line of research, the results of which are being published [3–7]. This communication is an attempt to shed more light particularly on ethnomedicinal importance of seeds. The Indian researchers do not want to ignore the contribution of native bioresources. The vast role played by seeds as cereals, millets, pseudo-cereals, oils, spices and condiments is obvious for sustenance of human life since the appearance of mankind on the Blue Planet. The panorama of ‘Ethnobotany’ has now been quite widened in India [25]. However, its role in medicine is hardly emphasized [26–28]. Although the importance of newer subjects such as biotechnology and molecular biology is being emphasized, there is equal necessity to nurture traditional subjects like ‘Ethnobotany’"
