        "text": "Just about 1 km from Jor Bangla Temple and 2 km from Bishnupur bus station stands an extraordinary building – the Bishnupur Museum. The official address is Dalmadal Para, and the museum is officially known as Acharya Jogesh Chandra Purakriti Bhawan, but whichever name you call it by, it is an absolute must visit when you go to Bishnupur, not least because it is the only museum in the district of Bankura on art and archaeology. And it is a ‘living’ museum too, the latest sculpture having been discovered as recently as March 5, adjacent to an old temple in Nalicha village in the Patrasayer police station area, alongside the Dwarakeswar river.\n\nThe entrance of the museum\n\nToday, the museum houses nearly 5,000 old manuscripts such as the ‘Chaitanya Charitamrita’, ‘Madanmohan Bandana’, and various ayurvedic texts, more than 100 sculptures dating primarily from the 10th-12th century AD, remnants of British history, and several priceless specimens of textiles, various photographs, and tribal art and craft.\n\nIn fact, the Dwarakeswar, which rises in Purulia and enters Bankura near Chhatna, has been a rich source of many of the sculptures housed in the museum. In 2006, for instance, a statue of the first Jain tirthankara Rishabhnath or Adinath was recovered from the river near Ajodhya village. It has also yielded up Hindu and Buddhist sculptures. As an aside, the Dwarakeswar, having flown through Bankura, East Bardhaman, and Hooghly, eventually joins up with the Silai near Ghatal in West Medinipur to form the Rupnarayan, which in turn flows into the Hooghly at Gadiara in Howrah.\n\nTushar Sarkar, the current curator of Bishnupur Museum, says that when it was established in 1951, the museum was a private effort, led largely by such local luminaries as former Bishnupur High School teacher Maniklal Singha, and a few of his colleagues such as Chittaranjan Dasgupta. These founders sourced artefacts from various sources, including private collections, and the museum’s sizable collection was eventually taken over by the West Bengal government’s Directorate of Archaeology and Museums.\n\nToday, the museum houses nearly 5,000 old manuscripts such as the ‘Chaitanya Charitamrita’, ‘Madanmohan Bandana’, and various ayurvedic texts, more than 100 sculptures dating primarily from the 10th-12th century AD, remnants of British history, and several priceless specimens of textiles, various photographs, and tribal art and craft. That apart, there are microliths from the Mesolithic and Chalcolithic eras, coins and artefacts from various historical eras such as the Pushana, Sunga, Gupta, and Pala, establishing a history of continuous human habitation in Bankura from prehistoric times.\n\nThere is also an entire gallery dedicated to the Bishnupur gharana (loosely translated as tradition), the only Indian classical music tradition from Bengal, including the musical instruments used by such stalwarts as Gopeswar Bandyopadhyay and his peers, many of them now extinct.\n\nThe other remarkable collection in the museum comes from the Dihar archaeological site, 8 km north of Bishnupur by the banks of the Kana river, a tributary of the Dwarakeswar. The oldest discoveries at Dihar date back roughly 3,200 years, making it one of the earliest sites of human habitation discovered in Bengal, showing successive layers of prehistory, proto-history and history. According to Sarkar, the founding fathers of the Bishnupur Museum initially sourced many of the site’s artefacts, before the Archaeology department of Calcutta University led a series of organised digs in the area. Much of the ‘explored material’ from the site now rests in the Bishnupur Museum, while the ‘excavated material’ was collected by the university’s Archaeology department.\n\nThe land of Terracotta temples\n\n“The museum offers glimpses of the entire history of Bankura district, including the prehistoric artefacts from Susunia Hill,” says Sarkar. “There are also important cultural markers from various ages. For example, when (24th Jain tirthankara) Mahavira visited this region in the 6th century BC, suspicious locals set their dogs on him, but the sheer number of Jain statues that we have discovered shows that this was the beginning of ‘Aryanisation’ in the region.”\n\nGetting there\n\nBishnupur is a roughly 4.5-hour drive from Kolkata, but you can also take a train, which will take you about three hours, or a bus from Esplanade in Kolkata, a drive of around four hours. In these pandemic times, however, make sure you avail public transport only if all Covid protocol is strictly followed.\n\nBishnupur Tourism Property\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe Bishnupur Tourism Property (formerly Bishnupur Tourist Lodge) run by the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation provides ample and comfortable accommodation. For bookings and other details, you could wither contact the property directly at +91 97321 00950 or bishnupurtl@gmail.com, or contact\n\nWest Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd\n\nDG Block, Sector-II, Salt Lake\n\nKolkata 700091\n\nPhone: (033) 2358 5189, Fax: 2359 8292\n\nWebsite: https://www.wbtdcl.com/\n\nEmail: visitwestbengal@yahoo.co.in, mdwbtdc@gmail.com, dgmrwbtdc@gmail.com\n\nThe word ‘terracotta’ means baked earth. Simply put, it is what you get when clay is hard-baked, producing a strong, durable construction material that is also naturally resistant to mould and bacteria. And terracotta architecture is something you see in abundance in West Bengal, particularly in the Bishnupur region, which is justifiably famed for its historic and magnificent terracotta temples. A major reason for the use of terracotta, of course, was the relative inaccessibility of other more traditional construction materials such as stone or marble.\n\nHowever, the use of terracotta in Bengal’s architecture dates further back – to the terracotta mosques scattered across modern day Murshidabad, Birbhum, and Bardhaman, as well as parts of Bangladesh. Not having garnered as much of the limelight as the temples, these mosques are nonetheless excellent examples of Bengal’s terracotta craftsmanship, with their beautifully symmetrical layouts and ornate engravings.\n\nA prime example of such a mosque is the Kherur Masjid in Murshidabad, though the district is also home to bigger, perhaps more famous mosques. Located almost 50 km from Berhampore, Kherur Mosque is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India, and should be a must visit for those interested in the architectural and social history of Bengal.\n\nTwo inscriptions within the premises declare that the mosque was built by Rafat Khan in 1494-95, during the reign of Alauddin Hussain Shah, sultan of Bengal from 1494-1519. Ap-proximately three metres (18 feet) high, and occupying about two acres of land, the mosque is not particularly lavish, and yet it is a perfect example of the terracotta craftsmanship unique to Bengal. It is also an important representative of mosque architecture of the pre-Mughal period, with a frontal corridor, which was typical of the later Ilyas Shahi erain Bengal.\n\nEssentially a rectangular structure, the mosque comprises a domed prayer chamber and a tri-ple-domed corridor with four minarets. While almost the entire structure is made of baked earth bricks, there are smatterings of stone in the pillars and prayer chamber, which were probably borrowed from older, rundown structures. Incidentally, the principal dome was al-most entirely destroyed in the huge earthquake of 1897, but the domes atop the corridor re-main to this day. Similarly, the north-western minaret no longer exists, but the remaining three are still standing.\n\nHow to get there\n\nEasily accessible from Berhampore town, which is about 230 km from Kolkata by road. You can also take a train from Kolkata, of which there are several.\n\nFor details contact\n\nWest Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd.\n\nUdayachal Tourist Lodge\n\nDG Block (1st floor), Sec II, Salt Lake,Kolkata700091\n\nPhone: 033 2358 5189\n\nEmail: visitwestbengal@yahoo.co.in, mdwbtdc@gmail.com, dgmrwbtdc@gmail.com\n\nDepartment of Tourism,\n\nGovernment of West Bengal\n\nNew Secretariat Building\n\n1, K.

As promised, we begin this weekend’s walk from one of the city’s oldest quarters, one that even predates the arrival of the British in some cases. The easiest starting point is the General Post Office or GPO, from where you can walk down India Exchange Place and turn left onto Radhabazar Street, which in turn emerges into Old China Bazar Street. This bazar was once called Radhabazar too, and belonged to an old Armenian family called Apcar. The name Radhabazar comes from Radhanath Tagore, whose family were the original owners of the land.\n\nAccording to some accounts, the bazar dates back to as early as 1757, and the name ‘China Bazar’ came from the fact that it dealt primarily in several kinds of China crockery and other Chinese goods. Today, of course, there is almost nothing that this bazar doesn’t sell, and we mean that literally. Of course, a lot of the business here is done wholesale, and not all shops sell to individual small buyers.\n\nPoint A – Armenian Church\n\nThe Armenians arrived in Calcutta almost at the same time as Job Charnock, that is, at the end of the 17th century. Most of them came not from the relatively modern nation of Armenia, but from West Asia. Of course, they were by no means the first foreigners to land on these shores. The Portuguese had superseded both the Armenians and the British, entering Bengal in the 16th century, while the Dutch had settled in Chinsurah around 1610.\n\nBefore the British grew roots here, the Armenians were easily the most prosperous community in Calcutta, thanks to their superb business sense and financial acumen. Even today, if you trace the history of some of the city’s oldest and most magnificent mansions, chances are that you will discover they once belonged to an Armenian family by the name of Chater, Apcar, Galstaun, and the like.\n\nTheir Church of the Holy Nazareth is approached from Old China Bazar Street, which crosses Canning Street and turns right into Armenian Street. More commonly known as the Armenian Church, it was originally built of wood in 1707, but destroyed in a fire just a few years later. Rebuilt from scratch with brick and mortar in 1724, it predates St John’s Church by several decades. Some of the most interesting things about the church are its old gravestones, many of them with Cyrillic (the alphabet used in Russian and a few other languages) inscriptions.\n\nStanding among these is the famous – or controversial, depending on your point of view – gravestone of Rezabeebeh, wife of ‘the late Charitable Sookias’, who died on July 11, 1630. If the date on the gravestone is to be believed, then this is the oldest Christian grave in Kolkata. Which begs the question, if the church itself was built in 1707, from where did this tombstone come? And why is the inscription in English and not Cyrillic?\n\nPoint B – Maghen David Synagogue\n\nRetrace your steps back to Canning Street (or Biplabi Rashbehari Basu Road), and walk to the corner where it meets Brabourne Road to the east. Right on the intersection of the two roads stands the Maghen David Synagogue. This is a splendid representation of Calcutta’s once thriving Jewish community, who arrived in India many centuries ago, though their settlements were confined primarily to western India. Arriving in Calcutta around 1790, they quickly established themselves as astute business people and their prosperity grew in leaps in bounds. Post-Independence, most of them migrated to Israel, and their numbers in the city have now declined to just a handful.\n\nThe site where Maghen David now stands was the location for the Neveh Shalom synagogue, built in 1826. Parts of it can still be seen, though it made way for Maghen David in 1884, coinciding with the time when Calcutta got its first Jewish sheriff, the redoubtable Elias David Joseph Ezra. The building has been taken over by the Archaeological Survey of India, but you can photograph it from the outside, and it is open on Saturdays, the Jeiwsh sabbath.\n\nPoint C – Portuguese Church\n\nCross Brabourne Road from Maghen David, and you come upon the Portuguese Church, formerly known as the Cathedral of the Holy Rosary. Set up in 1747, this was Calcutta’s first Catholic place of worship, though some accounts state that it stands on land originally occupied by a chapel of the Order of St Augustine in 1700. The Catholic church had to suspend services for some time in the 18th century owing to tensions with the Anglican British administration, but today serves a fairly large congregation.\n\nPoint D – Saifee Mosque\n\nWalk back past the Canning Street crossing and you will come upon the mosque, belonging to the Bohra Muslim community. Apparently named after one Saifuddin, the mosque is just about 130 years old, which makes it younger than the buildings we have visited so far. However, it is interesting for its architecture and colouring.\n\nDuring our short walk, we have already visited a couple of churches, a synagogue, and a mosque, indicating the fascinating cultural melting pot that was old Calcutta. Next week, we will continue on this route, taking in a few more places of worship.\n\nIn a clearing amidst mango orchards and fields stands a golden coloured statue. The subject of the statue is the last autonomous nawab of Bengal, Siraj-ud-Daulah, whose defeat in 1757 at the hands of the British set in motion a chain of events that would eventually lead to the colonisation of the whole of India. Today, the battle in which Siraj was defeated is still known as the Battle of ‘Plassey’, the anglicised version of the original Palashi, the small village on the east bank of the Bhagirathi river, about 50 km from Krishnanagar, in what is Nadia district today.\n\nAt first glance, the renowned battlefield seems fairly nondescript. Indeed, it looks like little more than a field and a modest sized mango orchard, rather than the theatre of war which changed the course of Indian history. However, as you walk around the field, it is easy to imagine the thundering of cannons, the screams of the dying and injured, the tumultuous confusion of battle between the British East India Company’s private army and the nawab’s forces\n\nFor many, it comes as a surprise to know that Plassey is not in Murshidabad district, considering the latter was the capital of Bengal before Calcutta was accorded the honour. Roughly 155 km from Kolkata and 50 km from Murshidabad, this is an excellent location from which to begin a larger tour of Bengal’s former capital.\n\nThe name Palashi derives from the Bengali word ‘palash’, for a distinctive, red-flowered tree. The village has a total population of approximately 20,000 and is connected to Kolkata by both train and bus. Parts of the original battlefield have been swept away as the Bhagirathi has changed course over the centuries, but the Palashi Memorial is still very much worth a visit, comprising shrines, obelisks and memorials to the fallen generals and soldiers of Siraj-ud-Daulah, apart from the statue of Siraj mentioned at the very beginning.\n\nThree obelisks mark the spots where Mir Madan (chief of artillery), Bahadur Ali Khan (commander of musketeers) and Nauwe Singh Hazari (captain of artillery) were killed in the battle. An inscription on a plaque states that they fell during an artillery charge led by Mir Madan, at around 2.00 p.m. on June 23. The general was eventually buried at the tomb of Farid Shah, about 5 km from Plassey.\n\nHow deep the Battle of Plassey is embedded in both the Indian and British psyches is evident from the fact that in Ireland’s County Clare, an estate owned by Robert Clive – the architect of the British victory – was renamed ‘Plassey’ in order to commemorate the famous win. Also, at the nearby University of Limerick, the original office of the president was named Plassey House in the late 18th century, and the building continues to serve the university today.\n\nWhy not visit such an important location for yourself? Once you’re done here, travel onward to Murshidabad and stay at the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation’s Bohor Tourism Property (earlier Baharampur Tourist Lodge), which will serve as an excellent base for your tour of Murshidabad, which bore the brunt of the aftermath of Plassey. But that tour is another story.\n\nWest Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd.\n\nUdayachal Tourist Lodge\n\nDG Block (1st floor), Sec II, Salt Lake, Kolkata – 700091\n\nPhone: 033 2358 5189\n\nEmail: visitwestbengal@yahoo.co.in, mdwbtdc@gmail.com, dgmrwbtdc@gmail.com\n\nWebsite: https://www.wbtdcl.com/\n\nJhargram royal palace\n\nKolkata has traditionally been known as a ‘City of Palaces’. While the sobriquet is undoubtedly justified, it runs the risk of ignoring the hundreds of other palaces that West Bengal boasts of. Truth to tell, this is a ‘state of palaces’, many of which Kolkatans know next to nothing about. What’s more, many of them have been converted into beautiful heritage hotels and resorts, where you can spend an absolutely splendid weekend. This is part of the ‘Rajbari Hotel’ phenomenon, which has rapidly gained ground in West Bengal.\n\nOne of the foremost on the list has to be Jhargram royal palace, the ancestral seat of the Malla Deb dynasty, about 160 km from Kolkata. Part of the property is now a heritage hotel run by West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd, called the Jhargram Rajbari Tourism Project. About three km from the railway station, the palace continues to house descendants of the Malla Deb kings, but some parts of it are open to visitors, with prior permission. The main building is an extravagant Italianate structure, set amidst carefully designed lawns and gardens. The palace as a whole evokes several memories of the past, and the complex is also instantly recognizable from several popular Bengali films, such as ‘Sannyasi Raja’ and ‘Durgeshgorer Guptadhan’.\n\nAmadpur Rajbari\n\nAmadpur Rajbari is a nearly 375-year-old heritage property in the village of Amadpur in Purba Bardhaman, about two hours or 90 km from Kolkata by car along the Durgapur Expressway. The nearest railway station is the busy town of Memari, about four km away, though Amadpur itself is a typically beautiful and serene Bengali village.\n\nThe palace is the property of the Chaudhuri family, whose ancestors lived in Malda or Murshidabad, from where Krishna Ram Sen Sharma, who was conferred the title of ‘Chaudhuri’, came to Amadpur after he was granted the zamindari of Amadpur along with other areas of Bardhaman and Hooghly districts by the Mughal Emperor in the mid-17th century.\n\nThe renovated structure boasts high ceilings, elegant verandahs and ancient furniture, all of which make your stay a memorable one, alongside the lovely traditional Bengali food.\n\nBari Kothi Heritage hotel\n\nThen you have the Bari Kothi Heritage hotel in Azimganj, Murshidabad, an approximately six-hour drive from Kolkata, on the banks of the stunning river Bhagirathi. The mansion was owned by the Dudhoria Raj family of Azimganj in the late 1700s, and is a magnificent mix of Greek, Roman and French architecture. The luxury heritage hotel promises not just a super comfortable stay in its Heritage Suites, Royal Heritage Suites and Maharaja Heritage Suites, but a complete experience of the vibrant culture of Murshidabad and its little known ‘Sheherwali Heritage’, a traditionally Jain way of life.\n\nMahisadal Rajbari\n\nMahishadal Rajbari is less than a three-hour drive from Kolkata, a distance of about 100 km. Mahishadal actually has more than one ‘rajbari’, though only the one known as Phool Bagh has been converted into a hotel. The history of Mahishadal’s zamindari families date back to the reign of Akbar, when Kalyan Roy Chowdhury was the first to be bestowed the title of ‘Raja’ with Mahishadal and its adjoining areas under his jurisdiction. In the mid-16th century, when the Roy Chowdhurys defaulted on taxes, the zamindari was handed over to Janardan Upadhyay, who had arrived in Bengal from Uttar Pradesh as an official of the Mughal court.\n\nEven later, the zamindari went to the Garg family, when the male lineage of the Upadhyay family ended. The Phool Bagh palace, constructed in 1926, has long been a favourite with Bengal’s filmmakers, and its rooms offer a glimpse into the grand lifestyle of Mahishadal’s former rulers. The accommodation is fairly limited, with two rooms capable of accommodating about eight people, but the experience is a unique one nonetheless.\n\nBawali Rajbari\n\nRajbari Bawali is already a fairly well known property located around two hours from Kolkata in the small village of Bawali in South 24 Parganas, now a sprawling heritage resort on a zamindari which once belonged to the Mondal family. No longer inhabited by the family, the huge, magnificent palace with extensive lawns was converted into a heritage hotel with all modern amenities by Kolkata-based businessman Ajay Rawla.\n\nItachuna Rajbari\n\nSimilarly,Itachuna Rajbari is also located barely two-and-a-half hours from Kolkata in Chinsurah subdivision of Hooghly district, and is also called the Bargi Danga. The mansion was built by the Kundan family, originally from Maharashtra, in 1766. The Kundans are descended from the Bargi, the Maratha soldiers who conducted regular attacks on the Bengal countryside. Having settled in Bengal, the Kundans became Kundus.\n\nIn the modern era, the palace has become familiar as the shooting location for several Hindi and Bengali films such as Lootera, Poran Jaye Jolia Re, and Rajmahal. The red and yellow of the main building, and the adjoining mud huts, make for an interesting ambience. The 200-year-old palace has five courtyards, and its rooms boast antique caskets, ornate wooden décor and many other artefacts from the past. The rooms have quaint Bengali names like Boro Boudi, Chhoto Boudi, Thakuma, Boro Pishi, Kaka Babu and Jyatha Moshai.\n\nFor details of all these locations and their principal attractions, contact\n\nWest Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd\n\nDG Block, Sector-II, Salt Lake\n\nKolkata 700091\n\nPhone: (033) 2358 5189, Fax: 2359 8292\n\nEmail: visitwestbengal@yahoo.co.in, mdwbtdc@gmail.com, dgmrwbtdc@gmail.com\n\nFor a nature buff, the mere opportunity to spend time among rare species of flora and fauna co-existing in their natural habitat is a dream come true. One’s appreciation for ‘God’s hand’ tends to grow profoundly when one spends time away from all the chaos, in the midst of the unbridled natural beauty and wonders of our planet.\n\nLocated in Jalpaiguri district of West Bengal, Bhutanghat is situated in the mountainous terrain along the river Raidak near the Indo-Bhutan border and is around 45 km from Alipurduar. Known for its pristine evergreen forests, rolling tea gardens and mesmerizing natural beauty, this picturesque little hamlet is home to many rare animals, including the one-horned Asiatic rhino, leopards and spotted deer, making it a must-visit offbeat destination for all wildlife aficionados.\n\nThe Aranya Tourism Property (earlier Jaldapara Tourist Lodge) provides an excellent base from where you can take in all the surrounding attractions, including Chilapata forest. Located just about an hour’s drive from Buxa (approximately 50 km), the splendid property offers plentiful accommodation at extremely reasonable rates.\n\nAn extension of the Buxa Tiger Reserve, Bhutanghat serves as an elephant corridor and has earned the popular sobriquet of ‘Elephant Country’. But that is not all that you will find in terms of exotic wildlife. Watch out for a glimpse of the rhinoceros, different types of deer such as chital, reptiles like the Royal python, bison, dhole (Indian wild dogs), civets, giant squirrels, bears, clouded leopard, and antelopes.\n\nAlso located close to Bhutanghat is the Narathali Lake, which is every bird watcher’s paradise, serving as the natural habitat for many migratory and endemic bird species like the pied hornbill, black stork, ibis bills, red star, migratory teal and minivet.\n\nImage Courtesy : North Bengal Tourism\n\nBhutanghat can be visited all year, but is mostly preferred during the monsoon season or just thereafter by tourists (mid-June to mid-September) when nature is at its finest. If you wish to spend the night in Bhutanghat, you can opt for the Jayanti or Hatiphota forest bungalows, which offer a fantastic view of the valley and mountain peaks, while their watchtowers provide a panoramic glimpse of the rich biodiversity of the region.\n\nFor further information on Bhutanghat and surrounding areas, do contact:\n\nWest Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd.\n\nUdayachal Tourist Lodge\n\nDG Block (1st floor), Sec II, Salt Lake, Kolkata – 700091\n\nPhone: 033 2358 5189\n\nEmail: visitwestbengal@yahoo.co.in, mdwbtdc@gmail.com, dgmrwbtdc@gmail.com\n\nWebsite: https://www.wbtdcl.com/\n\nFor those who don’t know this already, at an altitude of 3,636 m (roughly 11,000 ft) above sea level, Sandakphu is the highest peak in West Bengal, located in Darjeeling’s Singalila Ridge, on the West Bengal-Nepal border. Sandakphu is on the edge of the Singalila National Park and has a small village near its summit. But the real magic of Sandakphu is that four of the world’s five highest mountain peaks, namely Everest, Kangchenjunga, Lhotse and Maka-lu, can be seen once you have gained its peak.\n\nThink about that for a minute – a view of four 8,000 m-plus peaks, along with their ranges. Not for nothing is the Phalut-Sandakphu trek among the most popular in the world. Indeed, it is one of the few treks on earth to offer you a view of so many spectacular mountain ranges. It is also one of India’s oldest trekking trails.\n\nOnce again for the benefit of those who are unaware, the best possible way to gain this peak is to trek there, which most people begin from Maneybhanjan, the base of Singalila range where the trek actually begins for Sandakphu, and then onward to Phalut. Maneybhanjan is a small village, about 26 km from Darjeeling and roughly 90 km from Siliguri. Adequate local transport is available from both places.\n\nIncidentally, Phalut is the second highest peak in West Bengal, and is also located inside the Singalila National Park. The indigenous tribes who live near Phalut are called ‘Phalutians’. For centuries, they have worshipped the peak as a deity, calling it ‘Omna Re Ay’.\n\nThe Sandakphu trek is open for about eight months of the year, except the monsoon months of May to August. Depending on your weather preferences, you can do the trek in spring-summer, autumn, or winter. Should you choose winter, you must prepare for sub-zero tem-peratures, though the snowfall is usually very mild. And in spring-summer, your view of the mountains may not always be crystal clear owing to cloud cover, but the glorious infestation of rhododendrons, silver firs, and magnolias along the trail provide more than adequate com-pensation. In fact, every season offers its own unique landscape and views, so you are faced with a problem of plenty.\n\nThere are quite a few options when it comes to the route you take, but the average time taken for the entire stretch is five to six days, though you can always shorten this according to your convenience. The good thing here is that since there are no technically difficult sections on the Sandakphu-Phalut trek, it is equally suitable for beginners and seasoned trekkers alike.\n\nBefore we forget, an added attraction of Sandakphu is the magnificent River Teesta, which flows by at a roaring pace. The Teesta offers great options for adventure sports, especially river rafting.\n\nHow to get there\n\nBy air: Daily flights are available to Bagdogra, which is the nearest airport. From Bagdogra, you can take a bus or cab direct to Sandakphu. Or you could stop at Darjeeling, and then go on when you are ready.\n\nBy train: The nearest train station is New Jalpaiguri, with links to several routes. From NJP, a cab will take you to Sandakphu.\n\nBy road: You could take a bus from Kolkata to Siliguri, from where another bus will take you to Maneybhanjan, via Sukhiapokhri. SUVs are also available from Darjeeling to Maneybhan-jan.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nYou can stay at MEGHBALIKA TOURISM PROPERTY earlier Darjeeling Tourist Lodge, where one can have a spectacular view of the mountain from this vantage point.\n\nSeveral tour operators run the Sandakphu trek, and they have tents or camps situated along the trail. But even without a tent, you can stop at multiple tea houses along the way, which offer food and lodging for the night.\n\nFor further details, contact\n\nWest Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd.\n\nUdayachal Tourist Lodge\n\nDG Block (1st floor), Sec II, Salt Lake,Kolkata700091\n\nPhone: 033 2358 5189\n\nEmail: visitwestbengal@yahoo.co.in, mdwbtdc@gmail.com, dgmrwbtdc@gmail.com\n\nDepartment of Tourism,\n\nGovernment of West Bengal\n\nNew Secretariat Building\n\n1, K.

When we say ‘a river’, however, we actually mean three. Because three rivers – Hooghly, Rupnarayan, and Damodar – meet here, at two different points, and then flow on toward the sea as the Hooghly.\n\nA fisherman’s tale\n\nGadiara is fairly close to Kolkata, as you can imagine, a mere 85 km or so. And a very fine destination it is, too. The river is broad and brimming with clean, flowing water. The riverbank is lined with beautiful trees which offer ample shade should you wish to merely sit beneath them and stare at the churning waters. For the activity-oriented tourist, there’s always a boat ride down the Hooghly. And you can actually see three differently coloured streams as the three rivers meet and merge. Before you get into that boat, however, you should know that owing to the confluence of the three rivers, the currents here are particularly strong. Moreover, the occasional waves created by larger vessels will quite literally rock the boat, so your boat ride could well turn into an adventure.\n\nSailing through\n\nFor history enthusiasts, a visit to the old fort built by Robert Clive is a must visit, as is the old lighthouse. To be fair, however, almost nothing remains of Clive’s Fort Mornington apart from a few brick walls, thanks to riverine erosion.\n\nA ferry will take you across the river to Geonkhali, once again a charming destination which granta you access to Mahishadal Rajbari, and the ancient city of Tamralipta (Tamluk), though the palace, too, is more or less in ruins. One other attraction is the ancient Bargabheema Temple.\n\nThe solitary sailor\n\nHow to get there\n\nPlenty of options from Kolkata. Once train services resume post the Covid-19 lockdown, you can catch a train to Bagnan, and travel onward by bus. Or you could take a bus from Kolkata itself. And if you have your own conveyance, nothing like a road trip all the way to Nurpur, from where a launch will take you around Gadiara and Geonkhali.\n\nRoopmanjari Tourism Property, Gadiara\n\nWhere to stay\n\nShould you wish to spend more than a day, and we would heartily recommend a weekend trip, there’s the riverside Roopmanjari Tourism Property (earlier Rupnarayan Tourist Lodge) run by the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd.

As delighted locals and tourists thronged the shooting spot at Darjeeling Chowrasta, it was heard that actors Rajat Kapoor and Mumtaz Sorcar were also shooting at nearby Takdah Cantonment, in Rangli Rangliot CD block of Darjeeling Sadar subdivision. Incidentally, Takdah (sometimes spelt as Tukda or Tukdah) is rapidly gaining in popularity as a tourist destination. What’s more, Takdah also hosted a shoot with actors Taapsee Pannu and Ravi Mohan in November 2019.\n\nKanchenjungha (1962)\n\nOur point is that Darjeeling, a highly popular shooting destination for Bollywood and Tollywood alike for decades, seems to be making a comeback on the silver screen. ‘Comeback’, because the political agitation in the hills had been keeping film crews away, a fear that the West Bengal Tourism Department has been working hard to alleviate. Thankfully, the department’s efforts seem to be paying off, as more and more film crews scout in and around Darjeeling for suitable locations.\n\nSagina Mahato (1970)\n\nWith the return of the tinsel town brigade, Darjeeling could once again become popular on the film tourism map, too. As many who have been to Darjeeling over the years will testify, it used to be customary for tourist guides to take their charges around the various popular shooting locations in town. And there were many of these on display, considering that among the earliest Bollywood productions to be shot in Darjeeling was Barsaat (1949). After a brief lull, there was a positive deluge in the 1960s, with Jab Pyar Kisise Hota Hai (1961), Kanchenjungha (1962), Professor (1962), Hariyali Aur Raasta (1962), China Town (1962), Aye Din Bahaar Ke (1966), Hamraaz (1967), Baharon Ki Manzil (1968), Jhuk Gaya Asmaan (1968), Mahal (1969), and Aradhana (1969).\n\nSanjhbati (2019)\n\nAlso read : Kagey, the village with a view\n\nIn the 1970s, the most notable Hindi film to be shot in Darjeeling was Tapan Sinha’s Sagina Mahato (1970), remade in Hindi as Sagina (1974), though a major part of both films was shot in Kurseong, near Darjeeling. Then there was Amitabh Bachchan’s Do Anjaane (1976), and Shakti Samanta’s Anurodh (1979), an adaptation of the Bengali hit Deya Neya. Lahu Ke Do Rang (1979) was entirely shot in Darjeeling.\n\nKahaani 2 (2016)\n\nThe 1980s and 90s were relatively idle, with the occasional Barsaat Ki Ek Raat/ Anusandhan (1982) and Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman (1992). But the 2000s and 2010s saw a revival, with such large-scale productions as Mr and Mrs Iyer (2002), Main Hoon Na (2004), Parineeta (2005), Via Darjeeling (2008), Barfi (2012), Kahaani 2 (2016), and Jagga Jasoos (2016). And that’s just Bollywood. We haven’t touched Tollywood simply because the list is too long! Had the Covid pandemic not thrown a spanner in the works, it is quite possible that 2020 would have seen quite a bit of shooting in Darjeeling, too.\n\nBarfi (2012)\n\nNow that we have put all this in a nutshell for you, all that you have to do is make that trip and see it all for yourselves. By air, you can fly from Kolkata to Bagdogra and complete the rest of the journey by road. By train, the easiest way to get to Darjeeling is to board a train at Howrah or Sealdah, alight at New Jalpaiguri, and go on by road. Or you could simply drive all the way from Kolkata, covering a distance of 617 km, which would take approximately 20 hours, with adequate stops along the way.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation runs the beautiful Meghbalika Tourism Property (formerly Darjeeling Tourist Lodge) which offers excellent accommodation at extremely reasonable rates. You need to get in touch with WBTDCL for reservations and clarifications, and here’s how you can do that:\n\nWest Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd.\n\nUdayachal Tourist Lodge\n\nDG Block (1st floor), Sec II, Salt Lake, Kolkata – 700091\n\nPhone: 033 2358 5189\n\nEmail: visitwestbengal@yahoo.co.in, mdwbtdc@gmail.com, dgmrwbtdc@gmail.com\n\nWebsite: https://www.wbtdcl.com/\n\nDighali Tourism Property I is a mere five-minute walk from the beach\n\nOne of West Bengal’s most popular tourist destinations, Digha in Purba Medinipur is indeed the Brighton of the east, for those who have heard of the famed English beach resort. There are several reasons behind the enduring popularity of Digha, but the principal factor is probably its accessibility from Kolkata, mostly by road, but also by rail.\n\nThe invigorating sea breeze, a walk along the beach at New Digha, browsing around the shops at old Digha, and snacking on fried fish on the promenade… all of it while staying at Dighali Tourism Property I (formerly Digha Tourist Lodge) run by the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation, along with its sister property, Dighali Tourism Property II.\n\nThose with first hand experience will know that the seaside is particularly beautiful in the monsoons, and Dighali Tourism Property I is a mere five-minute walk from the beach. So, provided it isn’t raining too hard, you can slip out for a walk any time.\n\nOriginally known as Beerkul during the time of Governor-General Warren Hastings (1772-85), Digha was ‘discovered’ by the British in the late 18th century, and Hastings himself described it as the ‘Brighton of the East’ in one of his letters to his wife.\n\nEnglish businessman John Frank Smith reportedly began living here in 1923, and his writings provided further exposure to what was originally a seaside village. In the 1950s, Smith convinced West Bengal Chief Minister Bidhan Chandra Roy to develop Digha as a beach resort. Today, an old church can still be seen near the Old Digha Main gate.\n\nDighali Tourism Property I is located close to most of Digha’s other principal attractions too, and offers 28 AC rooms, ranging from standard double rooms to second-floor suites. These suites offer a fantastic view of the sea, though the ground-floor rooms look out onto the casuarina plantations which line the beach, impeding a direct view of the sea. All rooms have private balconies, as well as all modern amenities. There is also an expansive green lawn decorated with lovely flowers and seasonal plants, with a play area for children. The property’s multi-cuisine restaurant looks out onto the beachfront.\n\nTake in the beach at New Digha (2 km), and its Science Centre set up by the National Council of Science Museums. Also nearby is the fascinating Marine Aquarium and Research Centre, established in 1989 with the objective of displaying the marine biodiversity of the region and making people aware of its importance, as well as conducting research activities.\n\nYet another popular destination is the Chandaneswar Shiva Temple about 8 km away, close to the border with Odisha, and the Jagannath Deul at Dihibahiri about an hour and 15 minutes by road, where you can see the beautiful 16th-century shrine to the deity built by king Bhimsen Mahapatra of Odisha.\n\nDigha can also be your base for day trips to nearby seaside locations like Shankarpur (15 km), Tajpur (19 km), and Mandarmani (30 km).\n\nDighali Tourism Property I is 182 km southwest of Kolkata by road, with the journey taking about five hours. There are government and private buses leaving at frequent intervals from various points in Kolkata, including the Dharmatala bus terminus. You may also drive down in your own or a hired vehicle.\n\nFor those wishing to make a train journey, there are a number of options from Howrah, including the Digha Duronto Express. The journey takes about three hours, and Dighali Tourism Property I is literally just 15 minutes from Digha railway station."
