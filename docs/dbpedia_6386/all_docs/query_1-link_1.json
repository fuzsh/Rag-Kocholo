        "text": "In 1945-46 while India was on the verge of getting independence, a trade union leader Sagina Mahato started a movement in Darjeeling hills demanding rights for garden workers in line with what a Scottish surgeon first introduced in India. Mahato was eventually able to convince all planters that Darjeeling tea was the best in the world and were hand produced by the workers, and therefore workers' rights must be protected. All agreed to the demand.\n\nThe story of Darjeeling tea started some 150 years ago when Dr. Campbell (civil surgeon), as an experiment planted tea seeds in his garden at Beechwood, Darjeeling, 7000ft above sea level. He was reasonably successful in raising the plant, so the government, in 1847, elected to put out tea nurseries in this area.\n\nBUT\n\nEveryone knows tea originally came from China. And that was literally millennia ago--Chinese tea cultivation goes back thousands of years. Tea drinking later reached Japan, and in the West from the 1600s on.\n\nPeople in England particularly liked tea. So much that by the early 1800s it was the principal export of the British East India Company. That company enjoyed a monopoly on tea importation to the West, based on a production monopoly, that of China.\n\nAll tea at that time came from China. Its production was quite a bit more than its consumption. It had used tea as currency for some time. Tea was used in trade for war horses from Tibet as early as the 1100s.\n\nChina's currency of tea was part of its state security, things considered central to the power of the Chinese government. This meant tea cultivation was a closely held secret. It was forbidden to take seed or slips from a tea plant, or for a tea worker to show anyone outside of the country how tea was made.\n\nThe problem of Britain was that while folks loved tea, the country really didn't have anything the Chinese wanted to trade for it. Apparently British war horses didn't measure up. Silver was good, but Britain was running short of silver to trade for tea.\n\nThe British government did allow a growing opium market from India to replace silver as something the Chinese might like instead of silver, as trade for tea. But that led to more disagreements, and after the 1839 Opium War, the British realized they needed to find another source for tea.\n\nBritish-controlled India might be a good location to cultivate tea. But the British had no idea how to grow it. Some early plant breeders did notice an indigenous plant in the Assam region of East India called Camillia sinensis. Was it the same as Chinese tea? Many doubted it. In any case, who knew how to make tea from the plant?\n\nThe Dutch more than a century before had succeeded in smuggling tea plants from China to Java, as ornamentals. But nobody there knew how to make tea from the plants either.\n\nIn the 1830s, a Dutch trader named Jacobus Isidorus Longevijk Levien make six trips to China. He attempted to sneak away with both seeds and workmen for tea planting, despite his status as a wanted criminal in China.\n\nMeanwhile, in Britain George James Gordon went to China on the same risky hunt. He did manage to bring back some seedlings. These were planted next to the indigenous plant in Assam--folks then didn't believe they were the same plant. Chinese laborers who managed to defect from China contributed the expertise to oversee the operation. So the first tea outside of China came to Britain from Assam.\n\nSubsequent trips to China gave British workers more expertise to allow them to produce tea.\n\nIn 1841 a British civil servant, Dr. Arthur Campbell, decided to try some Camillia sinensis in the hills surrounding the mountain town of Darjeeling. West Bengal surrounds some of the world's highest mountains, and was British colonial territory. It attracted a summer crowd of vacationers. It also proved to be a good place to cultivate tea. In fact, tea from Darjeeling became so successful that it replaced China tea in world trade to become the world's highest quality black tea.\n\nTea bushes require about three years before they are ready to pluck. They need to grow in Zone Eight, and like acid soil, with at least 50 inches of rainfall a year. Most high-quality teas are grown at an elevation of up to 5,000 feet. The tea of Darjeeling actually are not grown in that city, as at 6,710 feet, it's too high. Most of it is grown downhill from Darjeeling, closer to the city of Ghum (or Ghoom). So really we should call it Ghum tea!\n\nToday the area around Ghum and Darjeeling is carpeted with tea bushes. Some of these are very old--the Happy Valley \"tea garden\", as the plantations are sometimes called, dates from the 1850s, and the bushes are between 80 and 120 years old. Happy Valley brags that they are suppliers of tea to Harrod's in London. : Happy Valley, Glenburn and Makaibari. The last one is most famous as having the world's most expensive tea, called silver tips. These are supposedly buds--immature leaves just opening--plucked under moonbeams, described as \"ideally sipped at bed time to cull one to celestial slumber.\" That said, tea prices are not like wine; $20 buys 50 grams, enough to make quite a few cups.\n\nThe monsoon flush is darker and more earthy, and autumnal is darkest and most full bodied. They are stronger in flavor and so considered of lower quality, and less popular than first and second flush. Monsoon tea usually stays in India and is sold for the sweet spicy drink called masali chai. It's in the cup you usually get free for haggling at a carpet or jewelry dealer in Mumbai. \"Chai\" is just the word for \"tea\" in Hindi and many other languages.\n\nMost Darjeeling tea is black tea. This means it's \"fermented.\" Not exactly--more like it's oxidized. The tea leaves are first dried on long wire racks overnight, with blowers, cool in the daytime, warm at night. They are then scooped up and curled--usually by machine. This bruises the leaves. The curling machine in the Happy Valley plantation dated from the 1850s, from London. The fermentation is actually a second drying process. The curled leaf produces moisture that oxidizes. How long to ferment is dependent on the nose and judgment of the tea planter. Black tea is 90 percent oxidized, after which it is dried to stop the process and preserve the tea leaves from spoilage.\n\nGraded tea is poured into sacks, and shipped to the tea auction in Kolkata--Calcutta, south of Darjeeling. There the price is set, and it is shipped around the world.\n\nGrading of tea as indicated\n\nT, \"Tippy\" means tea with many buds, indicating a higher-quality product.\n\nFOP, \"Flowery Orange Pekoe.\" This means nothing but a leaf size, based on the grading process.\n\nBOP, \"Broken Orange Pekoe,\" is the smaller size of broken tea leaves based on the screening and grading process. Smaller leaves steep faster, and generally are considered of lower quality.\n\nClonal means teas produced from cuttings of superior tea plants.\n\nSFTGFOP--Super Fine Tippy Golden Flowery Orange Pekoe or FTGBOP--Fine Tippy Golden Broken Orange Pekoe. These generally don't really give you an idea of tea taste. Golden Flowery suggests more gold-colored young tips produced earlier in the growing season.\n\nThe process of harvesting by machine produces a broken CTC leaf, that is, \"Crush-Tear-Curl.\" Machine harvest is rare in Darjeeling, Sharma said, but more common in Assam teas, in East India. The Assam harvester also will often pluck more than just two leaves and the bud. These processes produce more tea, but a stronger, more bitter product considered of lower quality. Assam teas are consequently cheaper than Darjeeling teas, and look like small pellets often used in teabags. The fannings and CTC tea certainly represent what most people expect when they think of \"tea,\" and so it's not surprising in Britain that the usual method of preparation is to add milk to tame the strong bitter flavor. Good Darjeeling properly steeped is slightly astringent, but not bitter, and offers a slightly floral taste.\n\nMost tea grown outside of Darjeeling is sold in the West as blends, and the cheaper Darjeeling also often is a blend."
