All information used will be gratefully acknowledged in your name. *\n\nFrom roughly 1947 or 1948 (certainly from the early 1950s) to 1964 Dilip Kumar was the no.1 star of Hindi-Urdu films: in terms of the hits that he delivered, in terms of the fee that he commanded and in terms of the awards and critical acclaim that he won.\n\nTamil Dubbed 1080p Movies Dastaan-e-Tarannum\n\nDownload File ðŸ”¥ https://bytlly.com/2yyWrM ðŸ”¥\n\nToday Indpaedia is the only place--online or in print--where you will find lists of the biggest Hindi-Urdu film hits of each year, from Hindi-Urdu films: 1931 to the present. Films have been ranked according to their box office success in the year of their release. For the 20th century we obtained our information from the archives of BoxOfficeIndia.com and IbosNetwork.com. Wherever there was a difference of opinion between these two authorities we have mentioned the higher rank first.\n\nMilan (Nauka dubi) was Dilip Kumar's first success (no.3 according to one authority) and the film had an impact on audiences. Dilip Kumar had arrived with his very third film. Some very respected authorities claim that the film was released in 1947. Harmandir Singh 'Hamraaz,' who is the most meticulous chronicler of Filmistan's songs, gets his facts from the most primary of sources: first edition record labels. He has filed Milan's songs under 1946, therefore, Indpaedia believes that there is no room for further debate.\n\n1955 Devdas No.4, but one of the most influential Hindi-Urdu films of all times. Till at least the 1980s every time Devdas was re-released it would do reasonably well at the box office, a distinction that only one other film, by a coincidence also starring Dilip Kumar, can claim: Mughal e Azam. 1957Filmfare AwardBest Actor Devdas (1955)\n\nVidhaata, on the other hand, gave Dilip Kumar the kind of role his fans wanted to see him in. he was the head of a middle-order starcast, had the title role and drove the film to the top of the charts.\n\n1986 Dilip Kumar was back at the top with Karma, a 70mm opus with a tailor-made role as a brave and incorruptible police officer. Dharm Adhikari had him in the title role of an honest justice of the law. However, the film was a non-starter at the box office.\n\nThere is something enthralling about him, his mutterings, his pauses, meaningful shifting of eyes, furrowed forehead, gesturing hands, short chuckles, smiling lips, inspiring speeches, tragic monologues, Heathcliffian determination, rustic innocence, romantic disposition, and the face that expresses tragedy of the mind and happiness of the heart.\n\nIn 1942, Yusuf Khan (Dilip Kumar) was in jail overnight. He refused to have his breakfast of eggs, toast and tea, which was offered to him the next morning because that day Mahatma Gandhi was on fast. The nation was busy with the Quit India Movement of 1942, for driving out the British Raj. During the next two years life was to take unexpected turn for Yusuf Khan when Devika Rani, the lady boss of Bombay Talkies, offered him a contract to act in her films.\n\nAfter a three-year hiatus, Dilip Kumar accepted the role of Leader (1964) for Sashadhar Mukherjee. He also wrote the film-story which is as relevant today as it was then. His comedy role fetched him another Filmfare Award in the Best Actor Category.\n\nHe was nominated in the Best Actor Category in all the four films. In Ram Aur Shyam Dilip Kumar played the full-fledged double role for the first time and his impact in the movie was such that it won many acclaims, including the prestigious Filmfare Award for his diverse, sensitive and powerful performance. His adverse critics, who thought he was finished, were deservingly dealt a serious blow.\n\nPortrayed as a brooding tragic hero, Dilip Kumar was actually quite athletic. In Sagina Mahato, one of his later critically acclaimed films, there is a sequence where the character feeling claustrophobic in an office takes off on a sprint alongside a speeding train. \"When I suggested the scene to Tapan da, he liked the idea very much. He looked at me and asked me in his quiet manner if I could wait for a double to be arranged for the run. He stared at me in disbelief when I told him I would do the sprint myself.\" The shot was done in one take.\n\nIn Bairaag, Dilip Kumar had triple roles, that of a father and his two sons. Bairaag additionally had the beautiful Leena Chandavarkar also as his heroine. This was the last movie of Dilip Kumar where he was the romantic hero. Thus from 1944 to 1976 he played the roles of a film hero for 32 long years.\n\nWhen Dilip Kumar came back to the silver screen after five years in Kranti (1980) it was his second innings but a successful one too. Stories were written for him, contemplating him in a central role. Thus we have Shakti and Vidhata (1982), Mazdoor (1983), Duniya and Mashaal (both 1984), Karma and Dharam Adhikari (Both 1986), and Kanoon Apna Apna (1989), Izzatdaar (1990)) and Saudagar (1991) and Qila (1998). In Shakti Dilip Kumar had Amitabh Bachchan, the super-star of the time, pitted against him. However Dilip Kumar came out with such a brilliant performance that it won him yet another Filmfare Award in the Best Actor category. He was also nominated for the said Award in Mashal and Saudagar.\n\nAi Bhai! Dilip Kumar's performance in Mashal was again a trend-setter and his AY BHAI....scene has been emulated in many Bollywood movies. In Yash Chopra's Mashaal (1984), there is a heart-wrenching scene in which Dilip Kumar's character is shown standing on a road desperately looking for some help to take his very ill wife (Waheeda Rehman) to a hospital. But she dies in his arms, no vehicle willing to stop on the quiet night street. Dilip Kumar says the scene was a straight replay of his father's panic when his mother had a near fatal asthma attack.\n\nThe director of the film, VS Rajender Babu, told BBC that the film did not get released initially because of a financial dispute and the original print of the film was badly damaged in the intervening years.\n\nDilip Kumar refused Guru Dutt's Pyaasa (1957) feeling that the character of the poet Vijay in the film was just an extension of his role in Devdas. He also turned down 20th Century Fox's offer of The Rains Came and David Lean's offer of the role which ultimately went to Omar Sharif in Lawrence of Arabia (1962) and which made a major Hollywood star out of Omar Sharif. To quote Dilip Kumar,\n\nOmar Sharif burned his way into Hol lywood with Lawrence of Arabia. But what most people don't know is that the actor who was originally supposed to play Omar Sharif 's role in the film was Dilip Kumar.\n\nDirector David Lean was an Indophile thanks, partly, to the fact that his fourth wife was Leela Welingkar, a legendary Hyderabadi beauty. Lean had recently made The Bridge on the River Kwai, which had won seven Oscars, and he was now looking to make his next great blockbuster.\n\nThe question was who to cast as Sherif Ali, a character based on various tribal chieftains who had fought alongside Lawrence. Lean did not want to use a European star; he wanted a more authentic actor. That's when he got in touch with Dilip Kumar, whose work he knew because of his personal experience of India.\n\nA meeting was arranged with Dilip Kumar, where the charming and persuasive Lean pitched the role to him. But Dilip Kumar turned him down, and the role went to Omar Sharif who had originally been cast to play Tafas, Lawrence's desert guide who, ironically, is shot dead by Sherif Ali in his iconic introductory sequence. Thus, what was intended as Omar Sharif 's end in the film, turned out, instead, to be the beginning of a famous Hollywood career.\n\nBut the big mystery, of course, is: why did Dilip Kumar turn down a part that any actor would kill for? It seems an inexplicable career decision, especially given the fact that David Lean was at his prime as a director, having won seven Oscars with his last film.\n\nStrangely, Dilip Kumar's autobiography, The Shadow and the Substance, doesn't shed much light on the matter, so one can only speculate. Was it was because he was then busy with his ambitious Ganga Jamuna project? Or be cause he believed his loyalty was to his Indian audiences? Or simply because he found David Lean too domineering a personality and was worried that the chemistry wouldn't work? All that Dilip Kumar has said on the subject is that he thought Omar Sharif had played the role far better than he himself could have.\n\nWhatever the reason, it may well rank as one of the worst career moves in cinema history.Dilip Kumar lost the opportunity to take his talent onto a whole new, international level, right at the prime of his career. A big loss, especially for an actor noted for his ability to take risks, to learn, and evolve with every new role.\n\nOne cannot help wonder: What if Dilip Kumar had, indeed, played the part? He was, unquestionably, a better actor than Omar Sharif (although, he might not have quite had Sharif 's homme fatale quality). He would have done a great job of Sherif Ali's role, quite likely even better than Omar Sharif did. He might have thus become one of Lean's pool of chosen talent, like Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins and Omar Sharif himself, whom the great director called upon to act in his subsequent productions.And then who knows what might have happened? Maybe, for one thing, Lean might have decided to make his critically acclaimed A Passage to India a couple of decades earlier, with Dilip Kumar playing a brilliant Dr Aziz.\n\nBut, that apart, Lawrence of Arabia would have opened other Hollywood doors for Dilip Kumar.And those experiences would have, in turn, helped enrich his future Hindi movie roles. He would have thus surely avoided the bad patch he went through in the 1970s, starting with Gopi and Sagina Mahato, which wiped out ten of the best years of his life.But one thing is for sure: Dilip Kumar would not, unlike Omar Sharif, have left Indian cinema and moved to Hollywood; he was too rooted, and modest, a person for that. 18c6514909\n\nPop Shove It This Wild Life Zip\n\navira antivirus free download full version with key 2012 16\n\nbbc news homework causes family arguments"
