        "text": "Historically in the Middle East, lamb has been the meat of choice. Evidence shows that it has been consumed since 3000 BC. Indeed, in many ancient literatures of the Middle East, “meat” meant lamb – when other animals were consumed they were specifically named. The most prized meat came from fat-tailed sheep and was the preserve of the rich and wealthy. About the only others could enjoy this luxury were the nomadic pastors, who fried their meat in the delicately flavored tail fat (or less desirably, just in any lamb fat). Such nomads may have been the inventors of some forms of the shallow-fried kabob (for my American friends: these do exist) , as the word kabab in Arabic itself means “to fry” or “to burn” which is almost equivalent to the modern-day technique of either grilling the meat on open flame or shallow frying them.\n\nWhen talking about kabab, it is impossible not to think of Turkey. Istanbul, the capital of Turkey might also be the capital of kababs. Constantinople, as Istanbul was known before modern times, was a city of the Byzantine Empire and was conquered by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmet II in 1453. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the Ottoman Empire was among the largest in the world. Founded by Turkish tribes in Anatolia, it reached its peak during the ruling of Suleiman the Magnificent (1520-66), when its influence was felt from Southeastern Europe to the Middle East. During this imperial expansion, the Ottoman army was treated ruthlessly and was forced to live in camp for months at a stretch. One theory holds that the soldiers hunted local animals as a way of adding to their diet and grilled their meat on open flame using their swords as skewers, giving birth to the modern-day concept of skewered kababs.\n\nAlthough India was not a part of the Ottoman Empire, we inherited the kabab culture probably from the Afghan invaders of north India in the 13th and 14th centuries. In India, the specialized cooks for kababs are called kababiyas. There are numerous kinds of kababs starting from lightly seasoned to heavy on spice, from chunks of chewy meat grilled to seared perfection to melt-in-the-mouth galauti kababs made with meat paste for a toothless old nawab. Indian kababs have a very distinct taste compared to their Middle Eastern or Central Asian cousins as they are infused with spices native to India and are made following specialized recipes perfected in the royal kitchens of the Mughal Empire by legendary families of kababiyas.\n\nMurgh malai tikka kabab is one such kabab which is an Indian kabab with a very distinct taste. Murgh is chicken and malai is cream. The name can be interpreted in two different ways, one being that the chicken cubes are marinated with cream along with other ingredients; alternatively, that the kabab itself is soft and creamy when eaten immediately after cooking. I have adapted the recipe from here and made slight changes. These kababs are best eaten by themselves with a dash of chat masala (or black salt and lemon juice) and an onion- cucumber salad on the side. You can also tuck them in pita bread and make a wrap, or just eat them with any green salad too.\n\nRecipe:\n\nIngredients:\n\nChicken breast: 1 lb.\n\nCardamom powder: 1 pinch\n\nGrated sharp cheddar cheese: 2-3 tbsp.\n\nCilantro: loosely a handful copped\n\nCorn flour: 1 tbsp.\n\nSour cream: 2 tbsp.\n\nGinger garlic paste: 1 tsp.\n\nGreen chilies: 1-2 nos.\n\nMeat tenderizer or raw papaya paste: 1/4 – tsp. (if you do not have ready-made meat tenderizer, use papaya paste as mentioned or mash up half (or even less) a kiwi and add it to the meat. Just like the papain in papaya, actinidin in kiwi acts as a natural enzyme and breaks down the meat tendons/fibers. Do not tempt to use more of any of the meat tenderizer, it will make your meat a mush and the kababs will not hold its shape)\n\nOil: 1 tbsp.\n\nBlack/white pepper powder: 1 pinch\n\nSalt: to taste\n\nCut the chicken breast into bite sized pieces and wash them well. Drain them and then pat them very well to get rid of excess moisture.\n\nGrind the green chilies and cilantro together with little to no water.\n\nMarinate the chicken with all the ingredients and keep it in the fridge overnight.\n\nTake them out of the fridge well ahead of their cooking and let them come to room temperature.\n\nSet the oven to broil or the highest possible setting in your oven. If you can fire a charcoal grill, nothing like it.\n\nPut the meat in the skewers leaving a little bit of space in between. (If you are using wooden skewers, soak them in water for half-n-hour to an hour. Take them out of the water and let them dry out before putting the meat in. Otherwise the skewers will burn. If using metal skewers, brush oil on the skewers before putting the meat in).\n\nBrush oil over the meat and arrange the skewers on a cooling rack or a baking tray.\n\nPlace the rack/tray around six inches below the hot wire or six inches above if using a charcoal fire. (I place the skewers on a perforated sheet/cooling rack to allow the marinade to drip)\n\nGrill the meat for approximately 8-10 minutes each side (I go 8 minutes on one side and then 5-6 minutes the other). The cooking time will greatly vary depending on the size of the meat cubes, oven setting and quality of the meat. So, keep an eye on them, do NOT overcook them. They will become dry.\n\nServe them immediately.\n\nIf you are using organic free range chicken, you can skip the meat tenderizer or papaya paste.\n\nAlmost around the time when the sun is preparing to call it a day, fires will be lit up and gigantic aluminum cauldrons will be placed on the flame. It’s an all-male business on the sidewalks of Park Circus, Calcutta during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Soon, the cauldrons will be filled with soaked wheat and three to four different kinds of lentils, to be cooked together for hours. Men of different ages with their sleeves rolled up will be seen for the next several hours engaging in variety of cooking acts that resemble workouts, from stirring the pots with huge ladles as tall as themselves to cutting up mountains of meat into bite-sized pieces. Every time I passed by those simmering cauldrons, my nostrils were filled with mixed aroma of meat, aromatic spices and lentils. In separate cauldrons, at least ten different spices could be seen being thrown in to cook a korma which would later that evening be mixed with the simmering wheat and lentil stew and then simmered overnight to prepare the final product called haleem.\n\nAlthough Hyderabad is the most famous place for its haleem, Calcutta haleem has its own fan followers too (including my husband who traveled all over the city hunting down the best vendors). Different versions of haleem are eaten in Pakistan, the Middle East and in Bangladesh. The Bohras of Gujarat call it khichda, which although very similar version to haleem is less spicy. Another haleem derivative is harees, a meat-and-wheat stew cooked with aromatic spices eaten in Middle eastern countries. The Arabic word halem/halim means gentle, forbearing, patient and slow to anger. I have never seen a food named so correctly. It requires lots and lots of patience to cook. You cannot even pound the meat like an angry person; you have to be slow and patient.\n\nHaleem was traditionally eaten during the month of Ramadan (ninth month of Islamic calendar when Muslims meticulously fast from sunrise to sunset), but now you can buy it all winter long in many of the Muslim restaurants In Calcutta. It is believed that during the rule of the Nizams in Hyderabad, it was mainly a food for royals and their nobles. But over the centuries, haleem became a food for everybody and a symbol of sharing and community togetherness during the time of hardship and sacrifice. In hindsight, this trend towards culinary egalitarianism is not surprising, as even ordinary families could afford to buy the small amount of meat needed to cook haleem, compared to the extravagance of, say for example, sikandari raan.\n\nAs this was the first time I made haleem, I took the traditional approach of mashing the wheat and lentil mixture with a ‘daal ghotni’(wooden stirrer) but if you have a hand blender, go right ahead and use it. But remember, preparing haleem needs time and patience (although the results are well worth the effort). It can be eaten both as a main meal or as breakfast; an added bonus is that it freezes very well.\n\nRecipe:\n\nIngredients:\n\nGoat meat or mutton: 1 lb/500grms. cut into bite sized pieces (with bones)\n\nHaleem wheat (sold in the Indian/Pakistani groceries): ¾ cup\n\n¼ cup each of mung (yellow lentils), masoor (orange/red lentils), chana (split Bengal gram lentil) and urad (split black gram lentil) daal.\n\nTomato: One medium, chopped\n\nOnion: one medium, finely chopped\n\nGinger: 2 inch piece, grated\n\nGarlic: 3 big clove, mashed\n\nOr,\n\nGinger-garlic paste: 2 tbsp.\n\nRed chili powder: one tbsp.. or more if you like your haleem to be spicy\n\nGreen chilies: 3-5 nos.\n\nTurmeric: 3 tsp.\n\nOil: 2 tbsp.\n\nGaram masala: 2 tsp.\n\nCumin powder: 1 tbsp.\n\nCoriander powder: 1 tbsp.\n\nCumin seeds: ½ tbsp..\n\nClarified butter or ghee: 2 tbsp.\n\nWater: 8 cups (more or less depending on the consistency you want)\n\nSalt to taste\n\nTo garnish:\n\nHandful of cilantro finely chopped\n\nGreen chilies: few, finely chopped\n\nRoasted cumin and coriander powder: few tbsp.\n\nBeresta/fried onions: around a cup\n\nLemon wedges: one per person minimum\n\n· Wash the haleem wheat and soak them the previous night in ample water.\n\n· Soak the daal separately in enough water for 3-4 hours the next day.\n\n· Put a big stock pot on the stove top and fill it with around 4 cups of water. Cover it with a lid and let it come to a boil.\n\n· Add the haleem wheat (drain them before) and let it come to a boil again. Once it comes to a boil, put the flame on medium, add one teaspoon of turmeric and let the wheat get cooked.\n\n· Put a separate container with another 4 cups of water and let it come to a boil. Once boiling, add all the daal (drain them before adding). Let it come to a boil again. Once it comes to a boil, add one teaspoon of turmeric and put the flame on medium and let the daals get cooked.\n\nOR,\n\n· Put the wheat and the daals with two tea spoons of turmeric and 6-8 cups of water in a pressure cooker and cook for two whistles. Let the pressure release naturally.\n\n· Heat up oil in a separate deep bottom kadai or wok. Once hot, add the onions and sauté them until translucent. Do not brown the onions.\n\n· Add the meat to the kadai and keep stirring them to get rid of the moisture in the meat.\n\n· Add the ginger-garlic, green chili, red chili powder, one teaspoon of turmeric and tomato and keep cooking. The entire thing will come together and the spice will coat the meat very well. Keep cooking until oil leaves the spice paste.\n\n· Add salt, garam masala and cumin coriander powder. Cook for 5-10 more minutes and then add around a cup of boiling water to the meat. If you know that your meat releases a lot of water, add ½ cup water.\n\n· Transfer the meat to a pressure cooker and cook it to one whistle. Let the steam come off naturally.\n\n· Open the lid and taste for seasoning and see if the meat is properly cooked or not.\n\n· Take the meats out of the gravy and let them cool down so that you can handle it. Pull the meat out of the bones and separate the muscles/threads with your fingers.\n\n· Discard the bones and put the meat back to the gravy.\n\n· If you do not have a pressure cooker, you can use the same pot and cook it covered until the meat is cooked. It will take longer.\n\n· Keep stirring the daals and the wheat with the wooden stirrer or a regular ladle. Keep mashing the daals. It will reach a creamy thick consistency.\n\n· Once the daal and the meat is ready, mix everything together. Let it cool down a little bit so that it’s safe to handle and then with a hand held blender (or any blender you have), blend everything in small batches.\n\nTadka (optional):\n\n· Once everything is nicely mixed and comes to a consistency you want, turn the heat to low and let it cook for 5-10 more minutes.\n\n· Heat up the ghee in a separate pot/pan and add the whole cumin seeds. Let it come to a shade darker and then add the ghee and the cumin seeds on the haleem and cover immediately with a lid. Let the spices infuse the haleem for few more minutes.\n\nServing suggestion:\n\nThe haleem tastes incomplete without the garnish, so please don’t skip them.\n\nWhile serving, add a little bit of the garnishing ingredients on the top of the haleem except the lemon. Sprinkle a generous amount of lemon and eat. Or, you can put the haleem with the garnishing ingredients on the side. People can add it according to their taste.\n\nBeresta or fried onions:\n\nSlice a red onion very finely in semi circles.\n\nHeat up enough oil in a deep bottom pot to deep fry the onions.\n\nOnce the oil is hot, put the flame to medium high. Do not keep it smoking hot, the onions will burn immediately.\n\nSeparate the rings and put a small batch on onion in the hot oil.\n\nStir continuously and cook it until they are brown. Do not wait until they are deep brown. The onions will reach a shade darker after you pull them out of the oil.\n\nPut them on an absorbent paper to soak the excess oil.\n\nFry the whole onion like this.\n\nThe fried onion stays well in an airtight container for several days to weeks.\n\nIf you are feeling lazy to fry them, buy them pre-fried or just add raw onions.\n\nEvery so often I learn about a “new” community in the melting pot that is India. My newest fascination is with the Bohra Muslims. The Bohra community is something of an outlier, not fitting any of the standard uneducated Indian’s stereotypes of Muslims being underprivileged, poor, sexist and uneducated. I’ll elaborate on other aspects that make them unique further into the article. At least at first sight, they appear to be liberal and progressive compared to many other Muslim sects. Significantly, in the face of widespread resentment against “regular” Muslims, they have managed to maintain an amicable relationship with the Hindu majority in Gujarat. From wearing colorful rida rather than the austere black burkha to educating their kids in secular institutions, the Bohras of India have subtly but firmly managed to keep themselves separate from other Muslim sects.\n\nThe Bohra community also has a unique ancestry, being a sub-sect of Ismaili Shias who emigrated from Yemen. The Muslim communities in Gujarat have different origins, histories, dialects, cultures and even religious beliefs. Some came for trade; some accompanied invading armies, some sought employment. Even others, like the Bohra Muslims came to India fleeing religious persecution in their native land for their acceptance of At-Tayyeb Abul-Qasim as Imam instead of his uncle Al-Hafiz. Supporters of Tayyeb came to be known as Tayyibi Ismailis. Later, Tayyibi Muslims came to be known as Bohras which is believed to originate from the Gujarati word for ‘trader’.\n\nThe original Ismailis Bohras went through several splits forming smaller sub-groups. The Dawoodi Bohras are the largest of these, composed of those who supported Dawood Burhanuddin ibn Qutb Shah during a power struggle in the sixteenth century. They are a tightly knit community and are governed solely by their Dai, who is the absolute supreme leader of the community. Indeed, each and every action from a marriage to owning a business is subject to his personal permission. Bohras believe that this strict enforcement keeps them united, helps them to live a ‘pure Bohra life’ and helps the community to thrive even under the threatened circumstances of being a minority Muslim community in a predominantly Hindu nation.\n\nAnyway, like some other minority communities in India (such as the Jews, Persians, African and Armenians), Bohras too have an invisible fence drawn around them. They have acquired some intermixed cultural traits, yet retain their strong community structure. There cuisine is very unique with Persian, Middle Eastern and Guajarati influences. Although there is no restriction on its consumption, beef is not a popular meat; instead they prefer chicken and lamb. Arooq is a specialty of the Dawoodi Bohras. These can be eaten as a snack with a cilantro and mint chutney/ketchup/hot n sour tomato sauce or with plain rice and daal. Or they can be tucked into a roti with some greens (just like the traditional falafel wraps).\n\nArooq recipe (adapted from Madhur Jaffrey)\n\nIngredients:\n\nMinced/ground chicken breast, boneless: 1 lb.\n\nTurmeric: 1/8 tsp.\n\nRed chili powder/cayenne powder: ¼ tsp (add more if you like)\n\nHot green chili/habanero: ½ tsp. (again, if you like more, feel free to add it)\n\nBlack pepper, freshly ground:\n\nAll purpose flour: 2 tbsp.\n\nEggs: 2 beaten\n\nGinger: one inch sized, very finely minced.\n\nCilantro: as per your taste (finely chopped)\n\nScallion/green onion: 2 sprigs, finely chopped (only the green part)\n\nSalt to taste\n\nVegetable oil for deep frying\n\nAdd everything together except the oil and the eggs. Mix well.\n\nAdd the eggs and mix again.\n\nRefrigerate the mix covered for at least an hour (more will not hurt).\n\nTake it out of the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature.\n\nHeat up the oil in a deep bottom wok/kadai.\n\nBring the heat to medium and add around 1 tbsp. of the mixture to the oil. Add more and let them get cooked and turn into golden brown in color.\n\nKeep stirring while they are sizzling in the oil for even cooking and browning.\n\nRain them on an absorbent paper and serve immediately.\n\nIn between sessions of intense research, my nerdy husband often takes a break (from the experiments, not from the nerdiness) and Googles random stuff. Some of these things are so random that he comes up with results even more inconclusive than his scientific data. For example, he knew the words Sagina Mahato but had no clue about what they might mean (it’s a Bengali movie made in the 70s). Then he realized that he knows the word khagina but again had no clue about it. Isn’t it random? He will always say “Google is your friend” or sometimes if I ask him something and he is not in a mood to answer, he’ll say “GIYF”, which infuriates me. Anyway, from “sagina” his neurotic brain went to “khagina”, which he Googled and for a change came up with something beautiful, which was a recipe for anda/egg-bhurji aka khagina on Shayma Saadat’s blog spicespoon.com. He liked the recipe (and was blown away by the looks of the blogger) and sent the link to me.\n\nIt was love at first sight. I loved her blog and after reading couple of her stories and recipes, I loved it even more. A very funny thing happened when I saw the khagina recipe on her blog. A few months ago I had almost nothing at home to eat, only leftover daal in the fridge. Usually I fry an egg to eat with the daal, but this time I made a bhurji instead, and threw in a few random things to mix with the egg. To my surprise, it was almost the exact same recipe written on her blog. How could it be possible? I didn’t even know the name khagina, never Googled it and nor had I seen the egg-bhurji recipe on the internet. I am very surprised and have no clue how to explain it. Maybe it’s a true coincidence. The day I made the bhurji, my husband liked it very much and found it very unusual. I never made it again and had no plan to make it in near future. It was a makeshift recipe for no-food-in-the-fridge days. I didn’t anticipate that my husband’s random Google searches would link me to back to my haphazardly constructed anda-bhurji in this strange way. Life is full of surprises.\n\nI was browsing around trying to find something easy and quick to try from her blog. Finally I found this daal and decided to try it. I love daal and try to cook it every possible way. I liked the recipe soon after I read it. I liked the story behind it even more. It’s beautiful and I can literally visualize the story. If you read the recipe, please read the story….it will make the daal taste even better.\n\nRecipe: (adapted from Shayma Saadat of Spicespoon and my mother’s recipe)\n\nI have used both cumin and Bengali five spice as seasoning and both of them taste equally good. So, feel free to use any of them.\n\nIngredients:\n\nMushur daal/masoor daal//red lentils: ½ cup\n\nMug daal/yellow lentils: ½ cup\n\nOnion: 2 tbsp. finely chopped\n\nTurmeric: ½ tsp.\n\nGarlic: 2 cloves\n\nTomato: One medium, ripe and juicy, finely chopped\n\nCilantro: a handful, finely chopped\n\nJeera/whole cumin seeds/panchphoron/Bengali five spice: 11/2 tsp.\n\nButternut squash/pumpkin: 8-10 nos. cut into ¾-1 inch cubes (optional)\n\nGreen chilis: 2-3 nos., slit length wise (optional)\n\nDried red chilies: 2 nos.\n\nMustard or any other oil: 1 tbsp.\n\nSalt to taste\n\nWash the lentils with several changes of water and then drain.\n\nStart boiling enough water to cook the lentils in a deep bottom pot.\n\nOnce the water starts boiling, add the lentils. Let the whole thing come to a boil again.\n\nTurn the heat to medium.\n\nWhile boiling the daal, spoon off any scum arising on the top of the lentils.\n\nAdd turmeric and let the lentils get almost cooked.\n\nMix the lentils with a whisk until they form a uniform consistency.\n\nAdd the chopped tomatoes. Let the tomatoes get cooked.\n\nAdd the butternut squash (if using) and boil for several more minutes until the squash is completely cooked and the soup reaches its desired consistency. Add water if the soup looks too thick by now. Add the green chillies too.\n\nAdd salt and mix well.\n\nIn a separate pan, heat up the oil. Once hot, turn the heat to low and add the garlic. Let the garlic infuse the oil.\n\nTurn the heat to medium and then add the jeera/cumin/Bengali five spice next and let them sizzle a bit.\n\nFollow with the dried chilies and let it go one shade darker.\n\nAdd the chopped onion and sauté it for few minutes. Once you get a nice aroma of all the sautéed spices, add the whole thing to the boiling daal.\n\nQuickly cover the pot and turn the heat to low. Let it be like this for 5-10 more minutes.\n\nAdd lots of chopped cilantro and serve with plain rice.\n\nDefinitely sprinkle a generous amount of lemon juice while eating.\n\nGoes well with a side salad.\n\nLike an emerald pendant on a pearl-studded necklace, the green valley of Kashmir is surrounded by the snow-covered mighty Himalayas. Apart from its breathtakingly pretty landscapes, Kashmir has many other remarkable attractions such as friendly people, excellent pashmina shawls, the world’s best saffron and a mouthwateringly unique cuisine. Unfortunately, except for Kashmiri dum aloo (stuffed potatoes coked in gravy) or rogan josh (meat cooked with aromatic spices), the treasures of Kashmiri cuisine are largely unknown in the rest of India – I have no clue why though.\n\nMaybe through a combination of its topographical detachment (a valley surrounded on all sides by very high mountains) and demography (two different religions with contrasting food habits), the Valley of Kashmir developed its own and very distinctive cuisine. Hindu Kashmiris are primarily Brahmins (the priestly class, also known as Kashmiri Pandits) and do not eat onions and garlic (as these tamasic ingredients are supposed to awaken the baser emotions of lust, anger and passion). Although meat and fish is abhorred by Brahmins in most parts of India (in keeping with the age-old tradition of vegetarianism in Hinduism), Kashmiri (and Bengali Brahmins) found their way to keep meat and fish as part of their diet.\n\nHowever, unlike the other chicken-loving non-vegetarians of North India, Kashmiri Pandits prefer lamb as their primary meat source (beef of course is strictly prohibited). Two distinct styles of cooking meat have evolved in Kashmir, one being a richly colored red gravy flavored with fennel and Kashmiri chilies (among other spices) while the other is yakhni, a thin, lightly spiced, whitish yogurt-based gravy. Contrary to the Muslim cooking style where onions and garlic are used in abundance, Kashmiri Pandits use hing/asafetida as a substitute for adding that extra layer of flavor to their non-vegetarian dishes that cannot come from the meat alone. Indeed, this constitutes the hallmark difference between the cuisines of Hindu and Muslim Kashmir.\n\nMarzwangan korma is a dish which is cooked with very few ingredients, but all of them are very aromatic. My husband says it smells like a subtle perfume (in a good way, unlike some foods which smell overpoweringly of rosewater or cinnamon). The moment you start cooking this dish, the kitchen will fill with a complex and enticing mix of smells. This is one of my favorite meat recipes as it doesn’t require any long marinades or grinding of ginger and garlic. Don’t be fooled by the fiery red color, it’s not half as spicy as it looks. The beautiful color comes from the bright red Kashmiri chili powder. Like the part of our planet that it comes from, it may appear violent but it is actually quite peace-loving 😉\n\nRecipe: (Adapted from Madhur Jaffrey)\n\nFind a similar Bengali meat curry here.\n\nIngredients:\n\nBone in lamb/goat meat, cut into 11/2 inch cubes: 3 lbs.\n\nRed chili/Cayenne powder: ½-1 tsp.\n\nKashmiri chili powder/paprika: 1-3 tbsp.\n\nAsafetida: 1/3 tsp. (optional)\n\nGround fennel seeds: 1 tsp.\n\nTurmeric powder: ½ tsp.\n\nTamarind: one small walnut sized ball\n\nGround ginger/ginger powder: ½ tsp.\n\nVegetable/mustard oil: 4-5 tbsp.\n\nCinnamon sticks (preferably the Indian variety): 11/2 inches\n\nCardamom pods (green): 3 whole\n\nCloves: 3-4 nos.\n\nSalt to taste\n\nSoak the tamarind ball in warm water for 15-20 minutes. Longer won’t hurt.\n\nHeat up half the oil and once hot, add the cinnamons, cardamoms and the cloves.\n\nOnce you get the nice aroma, add the meat pieces. Sauté the meat pieces well (until few brown spots appear)\n\nAdd three cups warm water to the meat and bring it to a boil.\n\nCover the pot and let the meat cook on medium heat.\n\nOnce the meat is 2/3 cooked, strain the meat and reserve the stock.\n\nIn a small bowl mix the red chili powder, Kashmiri chili powder, turmeric, ginger powder and fennel powder with a little bit of water to make a smooth paste.\n\nHeat up rest of the oil on medium heat and add the asafetida.\n\nFew seconds later add the spice paste to the oil as well.\n\nSqueeze the tamarind ball to make a paste. Discard any pulp or seed. Add the tamarind paste to the spice paste.\n\nSauté the spice mix until oil starts leaving the pan.\n\nAdd the meat and mix everything very well. .\n\nCook for another five minutes or so and then add the stock to the meat.\n\nBring to a boil and cook it until the meat is completely cooked and the gravy reaches its desired consistency.\n\nServe with plain rice and with a simple green vegetable."
