The staff at the Museum of Cinema in Moscow was enormously helpful in locating individuals and placing strategic phone calls to help me circumvent unforeseen obstacles during fieldwork. Elena and Leonid of Praxis International made the logistical planning involved in doing fieldwork in Russia eminently easy. In addition to providing me a home in Moscow, my friends Elena and Volodia assisted in distributing questionnaires in various locations and in fmding project participants. My friend Dasha was kind enough to transcribe and type the interviews I recorded on tape during fieldwork. I am grateful to all of them for their hospitality and unstinting help. This project has benefited greatly from the observations and sensitive insights of\n\nmy adviser Prof. Alexander Rabinowitch, Prof. Ben Eklof and Prof. Maria Bucur in the Department of History, and Prof. Dodona Kiziria in the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures at Indiana University. They read numerous drafts patiently and offered constructive commentary on each occasion. Finally, I could not thank my family enough for their implicit faith in my ideas and unflagging support during the research and writing process.\n\nv Preface The idea for this project has had a long gestation period and has stemmed primarily from personal experiences and 'popular knowledge' in India about the Soviet Union. Twelve years ago in a Moscow metro, a group of musicians approached me and asked if I would sing for them. Their request was a song from a classic Indian popular film of the fifties. I was happy to oblige, and the result was an impromptu song session in the Moscow underground. The incident was unexpected but the request lor an Indian film song came as no surprise to me. Growing up in India, one of the first things I had ever learned about the Soviet Union was that moviegoers there admired Indian popular films or melodramas. Indians have always found the Soviet interest in Indian melodramas most curious. At home in India, we watch Indian melodramas with enthusiasm, great indulgence and some self-mockery, but the passion of Soviet audiences for these films never ceased to puzzle us. The success of the Indian melodrama with its seeming 'flights of fantasy' seemed to be a paradox in a society where arts were meant to be edifYing, and where entertainment from abroad was tightly controlled. My parents' generation remembers movie fans in Moscow turning up in thousands on the streets of Moscow and Leningrad to greet Indian stars in the fifties and sixties, and I recall the great delight with which I heard that Raisa Gorbacheva's favourite actor was an Indian film star. Film magazines in India would report that Soviet fans camped outside the hotels where Indian film stars stayed in Moscow and other cities. Sight seeing tours planned for visiting Soviet delegations in India would even include stops outside film stars' homes and film studios in Bombay.\n\nVI\n\nMy interest in this dimension of Soviet popular culture has been consistently stimulated by personal experiences in that country. These experiences were a product of the friendly ties and bilateral cultural relationship, which spawned events, festivals, and language centers in India. During my stint at the Russian language center in Bombay and on my fITst visit to Moscow twelve years ago, many people from the region demonstrated a deep interest in India, which they attributed to their familiarity with Indian popular films. The identification of many with films from my country and their own view that our cultures were 'related' was a source of endless fascination and the subject of much discussion with people in the region for the next several years. The outpouring of admiration for Indian films and their stars seemed undiminished even in the late-nineties, as demonstrated by new magazines for Indian melodrama fans in Russia. Indian fllms were now available on video in Russia and other CIS states soon after their theatre release in India. I met with the secretary of a new film club 'New India' in Moscow, and browsed with delight through the hundreds of application forms the club had received between 1993 and 1998. 1 During early field trips, I also received two enthusiastic letters from Indian film fans in Russia - one from Dagestan and the other from Volgograd province. Natal'ia Chernikova in Verkhniaia Dobrinka in Volgograd province has always watched Indian films appreciatively and has a large collection of videos at home, which she offered to put at my disposal for my research. Zuhra Ramasanova in Makhachkala likes to dress up like her favourite Indian film star and dreams of going to India one day; in the meantime, she would like us to be friends, given our shared interest in Indian melodramas.\n\nI I cite some of these application foons in the conclusion to this dissertation.\n\nVll\n\nI was encouraged by the spontaneity with which people I met talked to me about the subject. Often, the conversation needed no preamble; in fact, people assumed because I am Indian that I would want to talk to them about melodramas from Bombay. I grew up on a diet of Indian popular films, loved and knew them well, and was happy to discuss film gossip with the people I met. Between their enthusiasm and my partiality for these films, it seemed research into audience reception of Indian popular cinema in the Soviet Union would be a logical consequence of these interactions.\n\nviii\n\nSudha Rajagopalan\n\nA TASTE FOR INDIAN FILMS NEGOTIATING CULTURAL BOUNDARIES IN POST-STALINIST SOVIET SOCIETY\n\nBetween 1954 and 1991, Soviet moviegoers had access to and relished popular\n\nfilms imported from India. These melodramas, where social commentary was embedded in a predominantly romantic story-line, were at variance with prevalent Soviet canonical assumptions about cinema and its purpose.\n\nThis dissertation examines the success of Indian melodramas among moviegoers in post-Stalinist society. It also explores the processes of import, cultural mediation and audience engagement that emerged around this cultural product. Using interviews, surveys, policy documents, press / academic articles and audience letters, this dissertation explores why moviegoers appreciated Indian melodramas and whether this audience enjoyed a legitimate and public presence in the post-Stalinist era.\n\nInterviews and questionnaire fIDdings reveal that Soviet spectators delighted in Indian popular cinema primarily because it was otherworldly and offered 'escape' from their mundane realities and/or from other cinemas, even while: it demonstrated cultural prescriptions and historical features akin to those of Soviet society. Research indicates that policy makers imported these films to ensure the reciprocal export of Soviet films to India for geo-political interests and to satisfy domestic demand for entertainment. Furthermore, despite the body of critical opinion that often challenged the audiences' penchant for such light 'escapist' fare, fans' letters that\n\nIX\n\ndefended their interest in Indian films and criticized domestic productions were accommodated and entertained in public forums.\n\nState patronage of Indian melodranlas and the public space that the melodranla audience was allowed demonstrate that audience enjoyment of these 'otherworldly' films and their indulgence in 'escape' occurred within the parameters of officially prescribed culture. Furthermore, audience reception of Indian melodramas exhibits the influence ofa global actor other than America in shaping cultural preferences in post-Stalinist Soviet society.\n\nx\n\nCONTENTS\n\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\nChapter 1.

The occasion was an Indian film festival in Moscow and other cities, and its success provided impetus for the regular importation of films from India until 1991. During these years, Indian popular films or melodramas' drew large audiences in Soviet theaters, often surpassing both domestic and other foreign cinema in viewer turnout. 2 Admirers wrote lively letters to Sovetsldi Ekran, the popular Soviet fIlmjoumal, explaining their preference for Indian melodramas:\n\nIt is simply offensive. My brother returned from his work shift at the factory. Weary and wishing to relax, he turned on the television, only to see his second work shift begin - a fJ.lm about a factory. It makes me want to smash the\n\ntelevision set to smithereens. Seriously, one is able to see beauty only in Indian fJ.lms. Life is grey, boring, murky, but in Indian films one can see so much beauty, love, music! Indian films are incomparable among the cinemas! (unsigned).3 Describing the experience of an Indian film show in a letter to the same journal, some Indian film enthusiasts had this to say:\n\nWhile watching an Indian ft1m, the heart fIUs withjoy. Everything is beautiful and so colorful, that you have no desire to leave the theater, especially when reminded of what awaits you outside it. 4 The Indian popular films purchased for Soviet theaters combined several genre characteristics, emphasized emotion and spectacle, and portrayed issues of societal 1 In the Soviet Union, Indian popular films were commonly referred to as Indian melodramas. 2 See Appendix I, Tables 1.1 and 1.2 for audience statistics. 3 Aleksandr Lipkov, Indiiskoe Kino: sekret uspekha: razmyshleniia, interv'iu, vstrechi (Kiev: Mystetstvo, 1990), 7, quoting from fans' letters.

These fIlms were generically and ideologically at variance with prevalent Soviet canonical assumptions about cinema and its purpose. This dissertation explores Soviet audience reception of Indian melodramas in the context ofpolicymaking and cultural mediative practices between 1954 and 1991. Here reception refers to audience readings of these fIlms and the state and media's role in determining and molding moviegoers' fIlm preferences. First, I seek to understand the appeal that Indian melodramas had for their admirers in the Soviet audience. What attracted moviegoers to Indian melodramas? Was it the fIlms' generic features, the viewing context, or a combination of both that facilitated audience enjoyment of these fIlms? Second, I intend to explore the context in which audience reception of Indian melodramas took shape. Why did the state tolerate or encourage the screening of Indian popular fIlms? Did cultural mediators consider admirers of Indian melodramas to be a legitimate audience and did movie enthusiasts have opportunities to express their appreciation for these fllms publicly? This dissertation proposes to examine Soviet cultural practices through the prism of the Indian melodrama. An examination of audience preferences for Indian melodramas and official policy in that regard tests rigid conceptualizations of official and popular culture, which assume that these realms are invariably shaped by mutually exclusive interests in authoritarian societies. Instead, the Indian melodrama experience in postStalinist Soviet society suggests a culture of negotiation, engagement, consonance and accommodation among various interest groups involved in the reception of Indian cinema.\n\n3 Furthermore, Indian films offered their Soviet admirers socio-cultural scenarios and realities that inspired comparisons and provoked viewers to question their own social experiences. Therefore, an exploration of the significance Indian films came to acquire in post-Stalinist society situates Soviet moviegoers in a transnational context and interrogates prevalent paradigms of Soviet experiences with foreign, 'bourgeois' cultural forms of expression. Looking at the Soviet experience with globality from the vantage point of Indian cinema, rather than American or western cultural media, demonstrates the pragmatism and flexibility that characterized Soviet cultural policy with regard to the 'bourgeois' world. It also indicates that Indian films caused viewers to compare 'our lives' and 'their lives' and to critique domestic socio-cultural realities. This introduction first offers the reader an overview of Indian cinema, both its characteristic forms and its global significance. It proceeds to an explanation of the disciplinary meta-narratives that this study engages, and the theoretical concepts that underpin the central questions. It then describes the chapter organization and concludes with an explanation of the sources and parameters of the dissertation.\n\nIndian cinema\n\nAt the outset it is essential to present, however briefly, the history of postindependence Indian cinema. 5 India is now home to the world's largest f11m industry, which produces films in more than 15 Indian languages. The two main streams of filmmaking in India are popular cinema and art cinema. Indian popular films are the dominant cinema in India; popular films produced in Bombay in the Hindi-language have acquired a larger audience than other Indian cinemas\n\n5 The Indian film industry dates back to the I 89Os; the first Indian to make a film did so in 1899. The first all-Indian full length feature film was made in 1913.\n\n4\n\nboth at home and abroad. 6 These ftlms are characterized by drama, spectacle, fantasy (within culturally defmed bounds), songs and dances, pronounced good and evil characters, and the invariable happy end. Film authorities retained the older colonial censorship that forbade kissing and nudity on screen, as essential to \"preserving\" Indian culture. However, the song picturizations border on the erotic to compensate for the lack of explicitly sexual scenes, and recently, kissing has been permitted on occasion. In essence, it is a \"cinema of interruptions,\" owing to the strategic placing of song and dance sequences in the narrative, the intermission during the show, and the frequent flashbacks in these ftlms' narratives. 7 Indian popular ftlms combine elements of the melodrama, the western, the thriller, drama, and comedy with characteristics of Indian folk theater and local epic story-telling traditions. Some attnbute this eclectic quality in popular films to the evolution of Indian cinema during the anti-colonial movement; filmmakers used cinema to create an independent cultural form that would incorporate local artistic traditions and indigenize western filmmaking techniques. 8 In India, these films are often called mainstream, popular films or 'masala' films. Masala is a Hindi word that describes a particular combination of spices; hence, this nomenclature for a kind of cinema that defies standard western classifications. As stated earlier, these ftlms are primarily referred to as Indian melodramas or commercial films in the former Soviet Union. In the words of an Indian scholar, studying Indian popular ftlms is studying \"Indian modernity at its rawest.\" 9 These ftlms grapple with issues of modernization and 6 Henceforth, this dissertation uses 'Indian popular films'/ 'Indian melodramas' to refer to Hindi-language popular films produced in Bombay. The film industry in Bombay is popularly known as 'Bollywood' (the Bombay Hollywood), especially outside India. 7 Lalitha Gopalan, Cinema ofInterruptions. Action genres in contemporary Indian cinema (London: British Film Institute, 2002), 16-24. 8 Gopalan, Cinema ofInterruptions, 17. 9 Ashis Nandy, \"Indian cinema as a slum's eye view of politics,\" in The Secret Politics ofOur Desires: Innocence,\n\nculpability and Indian popular cinema, ed. Ashish Nandy (New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1998).7-10.\n\n5 the changes this process has wrought in Indian society. This is particularly true of the popular films made in Bombay in the immediate aftermath of independence in 1947, a period otherwise known as the Golden Age of Indian popular cinema. These early postindependence popular films, often described as 'social films,' reflected the social and political consciousness of their makers. The characters in their films were socially engaged young men and women, troubled by the colonial legacies with which India was left to grapple. A decade later, a shift occurred in the social and political ethos of popular films. The new hero was a swashbuckling, urbane and wealthy young man, free of the\n\nsocial guilt that had plagued the heroes of the popular films of the fifties. Subsequently, the seventies also saw the emergence of a new popular ftlm hero - 'the angry young man.' This hero-prototype flourished in a period when the underclass in India was becoming marginalized, and the establishment seemed incapable of solving fundamental social problems. This film hero of the seventies and eighties functioned as vigilante, righting social injustices and winning his love-interest in the denouement of the film. Popular films contain social commentaries that are interwoven into melodramatic narratives. These ftlms valorize \"respect for kinship and friendship obligations, destiny, patriotism and religion (and religious tolerance) as well as controlled sexuality.\"I<>m general, at the center of the film there is a romance, often a love triangle where class, religious, or ethnic distinctions are played out. In these films, social problems manifest themselves and find their resolution in the realm of human relationships and personal trials. As these films are produced in a democratic society, it is common to see pronouncements about the importance of government accountability. Protagonists are often journalists, lawyers, activists, or social outcasts charged with holding the political authorities responsible for their acts. These formal traits and narrative tendencies\n\n10 Rosie Thomas, \"Indian Cinema: Pleasures and Popularity,\" Screen 26, no. 3-4 (1985): 116-117, 127-128.\n\n6\n\naccentuate the incongruity of these films' presence in Soviet society and the paradox of their promotion by the Soviet state. The second stream of filmmaking in India is that of art cinema, which differs from the mainstream popular cinematic tradition. A pioneering figure in this nonmainstream cinema was Satyajit Ray, whose films achieved international renown in the fifties. In the sixties, the Indian state actively began to finance and provide facilities for 'progressive' filmmakers whose films diverged from popular cinematic fare; these films came to be called 'art,' 'new,' and 'parallel' cinema. In the former Soviet Union, these films are also known as India's 'progressive cinema.' Although their projects are funded by the state, art filmmakers pride themselves in being critical observers of the political and social milieu in India. Indian art cinema proposes to draw attention to India's social ills with missionary zeal, and its filmmakers consider this medium to be a means to raise awareness and provoke thought among the audiences about what ails India. Generally, its middle-class directors have been preoccupied with rural India, where they consider the 'authentic' or 'real' India to reside. Together, art filmmakers have practiced different formal approaches to filmmaking, from Italian neo-realism to militant art aesthetics. Their films also draw upon traditions of Indian folk theater. Ultimately, these directors' claim to being distinctive is their \"integrity\" and ''vision,'' juxtaposed against \"imitative\" mainstream ftlmmakers. 11 The two cinemas, art/parallel and mainstream! popular/ commercial/melodrama, initially took opposing positions and claimed differing agendas. However, since the eighties, films have been made that straddle both categories of filmmaking. The popular films that were imported and screened in theaters across the Soviet Union were Hindi-language films produced in Bombay. The Indian art films, to which II Sumita S. Cbakravarty offers an interesting discussion of the self-definitions of those making parallel films in her\n\nNational Ideology in Indian Popular Cinema, 1947-87 (Austin: University ofTexas Press. 1993).235-248.\n\n7\n\nsmaller Soviet circles were privy at fIlm weeks, festivals and retrospectives over the decades, were sent from all the fIlm producing centers of India. Between 1949 and 1991, the Soviet Union screened 206 films from India. A mere thirty-one of these were art fIlms (including two 'progressive' realist fIlms screened in Soviet theaters in 1949 and 1951). The majority of the fIlms imported from India beginning with the 1954 festival, approximately 175, were Indian popular films or melodramas.\n\nThe global face of Indian popular cinema\n\nThe assertion that Indian popular films are a global cultural force and that their audiences are important enough to investigate situates this dissertation in the tradition of post-colonial scholarship in India that seeks to place Indian melodramas and their millions of admirers in the academic spotlight. Indian popular films became a critical subject of academic scholarship in India in the late eighties. Due primarily to the regular analyses of popular fIlm texts in the prominent Indian journal 'The Economic and Political Weekly,' a substantial volume of work has emerged since the eighties that analyzes Indian popular fIlm texts as sites where discourses of nation, linguistic communities and gender have been constructed. Yet, these films still have their critics in the West, who often measure Indian cinema against\n\n'universal' cinematic conventions. Indian art cinema, which conforms to most of those conventions, passes muster with the western media but Indian popular films are subjected to condescending value judgments. The problem with British and American film studies has been that British and American melodramatic fllms are presented as the prototypical form, and all other fIlm melodramas (whether made in India or other Asian countries such\n\n8\n\nas Indonesia and Japan) are found wanting in comparisonY In a lively defense ofIndian melodramas, Rosie Thomas rued the \"arrogant silence\" of \"First World discourse\" with regard to this dominant form of Indian cinema. Thomas was gratified to see that this was changing in Britain in the eighties; television channels had run successive seasons of Indian popular films. Yet, critics in British media continued to write about the \"lack of realism\" in Indian melodramas and failed to engage in an analysis of conventions of 'realism' in Indian literature and mythology that might explain the concept of verisimilitude in Indian popular filinS.13 The result is that Indian melodramas, until recently, suffered \"near-chronic omission\" from global histories of cinema. 14 Notwithstanding this discursive marginalization in the west, Indian popular films have become widely successful among diasporic and foreign audiences, while Indian art filmmakers have acquired a relatively minor foreign audience. Indian popular films' implicit treatment of problems of modernization and the industry's vast distribution network have made Indian popular cinema, in many non-western societies, a form pitted against the \"cultural imperialism\" of Hollywood. 15 The linguistic and cultural affinities of people on the Indian sub-continent have facilitated the success of Indian melodramas among India's neighbors. In the context of ambivalent Indo-Pakistani inter-state relations, it is Indian popular cinema that has unfailingly built bridges on the sub-continent. Afghanistan was one of the largest markets for Indian popular films until the Taliban banned Indian cinema. In post-Taliban Afghanistan, the first movie-hall that opened\n\n12 Paul Wiliemen, \"Negotiating the Transition to Capitalism: The case of Andaz,\" in Melodrama and Asian Cinema, ed.

The popularity of these fIlms has also been established by audiences in countries further from the subcontinent, in Central and Latin America, the Middle East, East Asia and Africa. At a recent international fIlm festival in Morocco, fans thronged to see Indian fIlm superstar Amitabh Bachchan and publicly expressed their preference for Indian cinema over Hollywood fIlms. In Burkina Faso, only Indian popular fIlms ensure high theater revenues, and some classics are endlessly re-run in local theaters. Hausa audiences in Nigeria even have local names for the fIlm stars they enjoy watching in Indian melodramas. In many parts of the west, Indian popular fIlms are no longer ghettoized as 'Asian immigrant culture' and are increasingly co-opted into mainstream cultural forms. One of the most successful London West-End musicals recently has been Andrew Lloyd Webber's 'Bombay Dreams,' a take-off on the world of Bombay cinema. It boasts the fIrst ever completely South Asian cast in a West-End production and the musical score is by one of India's most prominent composers of fIlm music. The musical had its Broadway premiere in late spring, 2004. In the Netherlands, the main Dutch television channels have regularly broadcast Indian popular ftlms, and the Amsterdam Film Museum has frequently screened ftlms from Bombay. In America, the director of the successful \"Moulin Rouge\" (2000), Baz Luhrmann, declared that the inspiration to make this Hollywood musical came from Indian popular ftlms, with their legendary combination of comedy, tragedy, heroism and their abundance of music. These are only some recent examples of the far-reaching sway of Indian popular ftlms.\n\n10 Among supporters of Indian melodramas abroad, the Soviet and post-Soviet audience for Indian melodramas is one of the earliest and most enduring. The popularity of Indian melodramas in the Soviet Union has hitherto been the subject of fleeting references in Indian fIlm studies. This project offers the Soviet audience its rightful place in the global history of the Indian melodrama and, simultaneously, gives Indian fIlms their just importance in the history of Soviet popular culture.\n\nNew cultural paradigms This dissertation engages two signifIcant disciplinary meta-narratives in its analysis of the practices of fI.lm import policy, fI.lm discourse and audience reception that evolved around Indian melodramas in post-Stalinist Soviet society. The argument pursued in this discussion represents a paradigm shift in the study of Soviet society in that it examines Soviet culture as a site of negotiation between official and popular cultural preferences, and a site of engagement between local imagination and foreign media.\n\nThe complexity ofSoviet cultural practices In this project, Soviet reception of Indian melodramas is examined as an interface at which official interests, the discourses of mediators, and audiences' movie preferences\n\nintersected. This dissertation analyzes how cultural policy, public discourse and audience reception related to each other as they took shape around fIlms imported from India. These entities' (importers, critics, sociologists and moviegoers) divergent and compatible views of Indian fIlms' value as cinema indicate the ways in which they 'negotiated boundaries' between officially propagated aesthetic standards and alternative moviegoing preferences.\n\n11 This analysis of views and preferences of audience members and their relation to policy seeks to further the idea that the realms of official and popular culture, even in authoritarian societies, are susceptible to negotiation and/or mutual influence. The neoMarxist categories of 'dominant' and 'alternative' cultural systems, used to refer to official and non-official cultural processes, are particularly useful in pursuing this argument. This paradigm is significant because it acknowledges as possible the continued presence within the same context of preferences and practices at variance with officially propagated values. According to this paradigm, every society has a \"central system of practices, meanings and values, which we can properly call dominant and effective.,,]6 The dominant cultural paradigm is not imposed on a society from above; rather, these values and ideas are hegemonic as they \"saturate\" social experience to a greater extent than the term 'ideology' suggests. Dominant ideas are experienced as 'normative' because of forces of persuasion that act through media and educational institutions, and through other social and cultural practices. However, these preferred ideas are not immune to change and influence. They are tested by time and fluid historical circumstances and are continuously \"modified,\" \"renewed, recreated and defended.,,]7 In the process of creating a dominant set of values, certain meanings and practices are excluded. In any society, these excluded values and practices continue to be present, and sometimes are reinterpreted in a manner that does not contradict or oppose the dominant paradigm. Otherwise, they continue to function within the dominant culture as alternative forces. It is also possible for these alternative cultural practices and values to overcome the pressures and limits of the hegemonic culture and exhibit independence. 16 Raymond Williams, \"Base and Superstructure in Marxist Cultural Theory,\" in Rethinking Popular Culture.

In this interaction between dominant and alternative or oppositional cultural preferences, the cultural process bears witness to negotiation. Because ideologies work through persuasion or through hegemony, there is always room for negotiation. The dominant paradigm 'reinvents' itself to adapt to changing contexts; similarly, alternative cultural practices constantly negotiate the dominant paradigm. Using this model, this project considers the negotiation between dominant and alternative ideas about the function of cinema and the needs of the audience, in the context of Indian cinema's reception in the post-Stalinist years. First, in order to achieve this holistic approach, this project examines both policy\n\nand reception, deviating from prevalent works on Soviet popular culture. Euro-American historical studies that treat Soviet film have lacked a discussion of audience reception and the 'practice' of culture. The paucity of published and archival sources and the earlier impossibility of conducting ethnographic research in the Soviet Union meant that the preferences and opLnions of the movie audience have been subsumed in the emphasis on production and policymaking. Richard Stites, in his work on Russian popular culture, deals briefly with the popUlarity offoreign and domestic films in post-war Soviet society. However, his work is concerned with the broad realm of popular culture, and does not pretend to be an in-depth analysis of audience reception. 18 References to audience turnout are scattered in works on cinema in the Soviet Union, and these occasional observations\n\n18 Richard Stites, Russian popular culture: entertainment and society since 190() (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992).\n\n13 rely exclusively on quantitative data. 19 Moreover, this data is chiefly concerned with the reception of domestic cinema,z° The thrust and concern of scholarship on cinema in the Soviet Union has been film production and its inextricability from the political vicissitudes of each stage in Soviet history. Looking at policy alone reinforces the state-centered perspective of Soviet history and gives us only a partial account of the cultural sphere in Soviet society. Studying reception is essential in order to understand cultural practices in their entirety. By considering how viewers read Indian films and how they responded to official ideas in that regard, this project focuses on the audience in its historical context. It is important in the study of Soviet history that we understand the real effectiveness of official cultural prescriptions and the attitudes of other groups in relating to those prescriptions. We can accomplish this only by examining both production and consumption/reception practices as they related to each other or negotiated each other. Second, this view of the cultural process as a site of negotiation and interaction between dominant and alternative views is at variance with those implied or pronounced by prevalent studies of Soviet popular culture. Commentators generally based such analyses on the assumption that official culture was one that sustained the cultural canons and acted out the purely ideological agenda of the state, while popular cultural expressions rejected that agenda. Richard Stites on Russian popular culture, Denise Youngblood on movies in the Soviet Union in the twenties, and Frederick Starr on Americanjazz in the Soviet Union furthered our understanding of the limited reach of the\n\n19 Maia Turovskaia, \"Tastes of Soviet Moviegoers during the 19308,\" in Late Soviet Culture: From Perestroika to\n\nNovostroika, ed T.

During the Khrushchev and Brezhnev eras, for instance, the sway of official culture could not prevent the rise of autonomous cultural practices. Undoubtedly, these scholars have made important contributions to our understanding of the resilience of popular tastes and preferences in the face of official cultural propaganda. Such an approach assumes, however, that official interests were necessarily at odds with popular cultural practices, where the latter evolved despite the presence of the former. To see popular culture as invariably steeped in the politics of resistance is to romanticize it. This impulse to locate resistance in expressions of popular culture can take us from one extreme (seeing cultural policy in the Soviet Union as totalizing), to the other (associating all autonomous cultural practices with opposition or rejection of official culture). The shift of emphasis only replaces one monolithic perception with another. This dissertation interrogates such strict demarcations between official and popular culture and the credibility of the prevalent Manichean view of Soviet culture. The following analysis of Soviet cultural practices rejects common associations of popular culture with resistance and instead emphasizes the interaction, the publicly expressed plurality of views and the commonality of interests between various groups with regard to Indian melodramas. Indian melodramas' reception in the Soviet Union did not signify dissent, but the presence of a heterogeneous culture in post-Stalinist society where\n\n21 Richard Stites, Russian popular culture: entertainment and society since 1900; Fredrick Starr, Red and Hot.

The goal here is to understand the ways in which Indian melodramas may have shaped practices and ideas among moviegoers and the associations India came to acquire in the local imagination. Exploring the global dimension is essential to scholarship on Soviet popular culture and practices because it helps us understand how Soviet moviegoers/citizens 'negotiated boundaries' between local, 'normative' values and the different material and socio-cultural realities projected in foreign media such as Indian popular cinema. This exploration of the interaction between the local and the foreign draws on recent scholarship on 'transnational cultures.' An essential feature of the study of transnational culture is to acknowledge that ideas and media stem from multiple points of origin. This approach disrupts traditional binary oppositions of the West and non-west that project the fonner as a source of all cultural flows and the latter in a reactive and resistant, rather than pro-active role (This tendency has been referred to as an 'inverted narcissism' that \"reduces non-western life to a pathological response to Western domination,,22). The concept of transnational cultures, thus, rejects the predominant association of cultural globalization with westernization, and particularly\n\n22 Brian Larkin, \"Indian films and Nigerian lovers: media and the creation of parallel modernities,\" Africa 67, no. 3 (1997): 408-409, quoting Ella Shohat and Robert Starn, Unthinking Eurocentrism (New YOlK: Routledge, 1994), 3.\n\n16 Americanization. The fact is that America is but \"one node of a complex transnational construction of imaginary landscapes.,,23 The second contribution of transnational studies is to help explain what happens to foreign cultural imports once 'received' into local communities. In order to conceptualize the intermingling of different cultural forms of expression and influences within a society, the chief theorist of transnational culture Arjun Appadurai first articulated the concept of 'public culture.' Public culture is that arena where folk, rural, urban, and transnational cultural forms mingle and shape each other. It is a \"zone of debate\" that eschews distinctions ofhigh/low, official/popular, urban/rural, and national/foreign cultures. 24 Studying public culture, thus, also involves examining the function of foreign cultural media in a local community. In this public cultural space, Appadurai posited a new kind of cosmopolitanism, where people now see their own reality \"through the prisms of possible lives offered by the mass media.\" This means that even in the most oppressive circumstances people observe and measure their realities with relation to images of lives lived elsewhere. They \"no longer see their lives as mere outcomes of the givenness of things, but often as the iconic compromise between what they could imagine and what social life will permit.\" One cannot underestimate the role of transnational media, whether cinema or television networks, in the creation of a new 'social imagination' that extends to include, as participants, social groups otherwise geographically scattered. Global ethnography must be concerned with not only the lived \"particularities\" ofpeople's lives, but also the imagined worlds to which the 'local' has\n\n23 AIjun Appadorai.

Breckenridge, \"Why Public Culture?,\" Public Culture (Bulletin of the Project for Transnational Studies) 1, no.l(I988): 5-9,\n\n17\n\naccess, for this plays an important role in how people think about their lives and live them.25 The call to undertake global ethnographies and study transnational cultural practices has generated engaging research, among which Brian Larkin's project on audiences of Indian melodrama in Nigeria deserves mention. Larkin demonstrated that Rausa viewers identify with the world portrayed in the Indian melodramas that they enjoy. That world is different enough for the Rausa audience to contemplate it as an alternative reality; simultaneously, it seems sufficiently similar for them to identify with. For instance, portrayals of love and sexuality in Indian melodramas have allowed Rausa viewers to contemplate such issues in their own lives, where Islamic law prescribes social mores. These audiences feel comfortable engaging with Indian fIlms, where they are not confronted with the ideological baggage of western cinema. Larkin underscores the importance of studying Indian popular cinema as integral to everyday Rausa reality, since Rausa audiences participate \"in the imagined realities\" of Indian culture in their everyday lives. 26 This project's quest to understand what Indian melodramas meant for their Soviet admirers is a preliminary attempt at undertaking an analogous transnational ethnography. It does this by considering the reception of a non-western cultural medium in Soviet\n\nsociety and by endeavoring to understand the impact of that foreign medium on Soviet admirers' perceptions of their own lives. First, breaking out of the cold war model and examining the role of media from India, which was neither of the socialist nor the capitalist bloc, offers a more nuanced picture of the Soviet Union's experience with globality. Hitherto, Euro-American studies 25 Arjun Appadurai, Modernity at Large. Cultural Dimensions o/Globalization, 53-56. 26 Brian Larkin, \"Indian films and Nigerian lovers: media and the creation ofpara11el modernities,\" 406-440.\n\n18 of Soviet society have been characterized by a lack of attention to cultural influences from places other than America. It is important to study the place of American and other western media in Soviet society in order to understand the limits of official Soviet cultural policy. However, these analyses of American and other western cultural media in Soviet society perpetuate the cold war view of Soviet official culture as inflexible, isolated and hostile to 'bourgeois' cultural forms. In his work on popular culture, Stites acknowledged that the cultural scene under Khrushchev and Brezhnev was increasingly heterogeneous. But he contended that it was only the collapse of the Soviet system that caused Soviet society to be \"deluged by the world cultural system, called in some quarters \"Americanization.\",,27 However, if we study Soviet society by examining foreign imports from places other than the west, the image we are left with is of a society that was already a part of the global cultural system in a significant way during the post-Stalinist period. India was the largest non-communist state with which the Soviet Union had close cultural and trade relations, and it was a meaningful player in Soviet cultural reality. Moreover, Indian cinema's global significance was already growing at the time that Soviet audiences were exposed to it; by the sixties, it had begun to rival Hollywood in its worldwide sphere of influence. Studying post-Stalinist Soviet society in relation to non-western global media and 'non-aligned' foreign cultural actors who were encouraged to playa role in it provides us a different measure for assessing the 'openness' or 'isolation' of Soviet society. The second aspect of transnational ethnography this project makes a preliminary attempt at unraveling is understanding what, if any, political/cultural/social associations Indian films came to acquire for their Soviet audiences. Did Indian melodramas offer\n\n27 Stites, Russian Popular Culture, 206.\n\n19\n\nSoviet moviegoers other possible 'vistas' to imagine and covet; vistas that made them question their own reality? Indian melodramas of the seventies and eighties, for instance, had stock villains and heroes; the heroes were vigilantes while the villains were certain corrupt members of the police force, inefficient bureaucrats, or untrustworthy politicians. I assumed that interviewees in Moscow would narrate to me the impact these characterizations had on their views of their political reality. Surely, they watched with interest the scenes offree elections and popular voting. Surely, they could not have missed such potent symbols of freethinking and democracy as portrayed in these films. However, despite my pre-fieldwork presumptions, I soon discovered that viewers did not give much thought to scenes that demonstrated India's democratic political culture. How did Soviet viewers negotiate the world of Indian popular films? This dissertation demonstrates, through viewers' memories of Indian films and contemporary audience letters, that many moviegoers found in their exposure to this cinema a way to contemplate alternative socio-cultural scenarios. They used their readings of Indian films to challenge several Soviet cultural prescriptions, compared their own reality to that displayed in these films, and often coveted that which was shown on screen. In postStalinist Soviet society, these admirers made such observations and comparisons public, in their letters to film journals and newspapers. Audience reception of Indian films indicates that the Soviet public, under state patronage, was exposed to social landscapes that diverged from its own; it also demonstrates the impact of that exposure on Soviet moviegoers' assessments of their own milieu.\n\n20 The central questions and theoretical underpinnings\n\nHaving considered the historical meta-narratives this dissertation engages, the introduction will now articulate those theories in media reception studies that shaped this analysis of Indian films' reception. The central questions in this project concern moviegoers' penchant for Indian films and the context in which their reception of these films took shape. A$ stated earlier, 'reception' of Indian popular films indicates not only viewers' reading of the films, but also the institutional and discursive context in which that reception took place. Here, I consider the theoretical constructs that have proved\n\nuseful in the discussion of these two core questions.\n\nHow did Soviet admirers read Indian melodramas?\n\nIn examining the ways in which Soviet viewers 'received' Indian melodramas (as evident in viewers' recollections and in letters of the contemporary audience), this work draws on a wealth of research on audience reception. Of central importance is the scholarship that concerns reading strategies, the significance of the emotional pleasures inherent in the act of viewing and the 'productivity' of active moviegoers.\n\nReading strategies and context\n\nIt is now widely acknowledged in film and cultural studies that the reader of a\n\nbook or the spectator of a film has agency and is an active, not a passive reader; but this was not always an accepted notion. Early Marxist cultural critics, whose influence prevailed in film studies until the sixties, had little faith in the capacity of the movie audience to reflect and think critically when confronted with a film text. According to Theodor Adorno and the Frankfurt School, the commodification of culture in the modem era stifled the individual's capacity to be critical and diminished the individual's\n\n21 revolutionary potential. This view translated into a denigration of cinema, a massproduced commodity. In this analysis, mass media such as the cinema were artifacts of capitalist production that deluded audiences into accepting the status quo uncritically. Concomitantly, these critics perceived spectators to be passive and unreflective 'subjects' of the bourgeois ideology that was considered inherent in cinema and the culture industry.28 Other theorists on the fringes of the Frankfurt School distanced themselves from this dismissal of mass culture and instead stated that modernity brought in its wake revolutionary ways of looking. For Walter Benjamin, cinema and its reception were inextricably linked to the spectrum of changes that modernization had wrought in the early twentieth century. In his contributions to thinking about reception, Benjamin (like Siegfried Kracauer) posited a 'neurological modernity,' where the development of sensory perception corresponded with transformations in modern life. He drew a parallel between the radical changes in the urban social and environmental landscape and cinematic techniques such as montage, close-ups, and fast and slow motion. 29 Benjamin was among the ftrst to articulate the revolutionary potential of rum and the mode of reception it facilitates. Earlier, an art form's aura of authenticity sustained its distance from the viewing public. Now, the diminishing of the distance between new reproducible art forms such as the ftlm and the audience transformed spectators into experts. Thus, in contrast to Adorno and the Frankfurt school theorists, Benjamin emphasized the audience's critical sensibility as being fundamental to the democratizing potential of mass culture. Moreover, because of the reproducibility of modern artistic forms, the audience had an opportunity to become participants in the making of the art product In fact, 28 John B. Thompson, Ideology and Modem Culture. Critical Social theory in the Era ofMass Communication (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1990),97.101. 29 Ben Singer, \"Modernity, Hyperstimulus, and Popular Sensationalism,\" in Cinema and the Invention ofModem Life, ed. Leo Charney and Vanessa R. Schwartz (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995), 91·93.\n\n22 Benjamin considered this potential of cinema to have been realized in the Soviet cinema of the twenties. 3o The Soviet Union was itself no stranger to theories that posited the critical role of the reader or viewer in reception. Before the Soviet aesthetic of reception crystallized in the thirties into one that was intent on forging the ideal reader or spectator, some Russian scholars had proposed considerations of the reader in literary studies (the basis for corresponding theories about the movie audience both here and in the west). A pioneering figure in theorizing the critical reader was Alexander Beletskii, a literary scholar who wrote in the twenties. Beletskii proposed that no work of art was inherently artistic or mediocre. Instead, it was the reader who had to evaluate the work of art, give it meaning or articulate its 'idea;' the idea could be unknown even to its author. Beletskii posited the heterogeneity of a readership, claiming that a history of literature must be prepared to unearth a readership that was not \"single-storied,\" but \"several-storied,\" with perhaps \"additional annexes.\" Thus, he emphasized that reception was critical, differentiated, and essential to studying art forms. 3! Until the seventies, the field of film studies in the west was mainly concerned with how the structures of cinema or film texts created subjects; the audience, in much of the work at that time, was still homogeneous and textually derived, rather than empirical. By this yardstick, the audience's reaction to a film was read off the text and the audience's readings were predetermined on the basis of the perceived characteristics of the film text. Critics called this presumption that texts are self-contained in their meaning,\n\n30 Walter Benjamin, \"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.\" in Illuminations. ed. Hannah Arendt (New York: Schocken Books, 1969),217-251.\n\n31 Alexander Beietskii, \"~b odnoi iz ocherednykh zadach istorilw-literaturnoi nauki (izuchenie istorii chitatelia}.\" Nauka na Ukraine (Khar'kov) 2 (1922): 97, quoted in Evgenii Dobrenko.

Savage (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997), 8-9.\n\n23 the 'fallacy of intemalism. ,32 This speculative approach fmany changed when the Birmingham Center for Cultural Studies began to conduct research that considered the 'real spectator.' This center undertook ethnographic research and engaged real viewers, who were observed and interviewed in actual viewing situations. A pioneer among these scholars was David Morley, who published his fmdings based on observations of a television audience. Morley reiterated the polysemy of the language of a book or a film; a text was capable of carrying mUltiple meanings. Although he emphasized viewers' individual readings, he considered the overriding influential factor in audience readings to be class. Since then, other researchers have studied audience readings as also shaped by gender, ethnicity, and other factors and have challenged Morley's exclusively class-based analysis of audiences. 33 However, Morley was one of the first scholars to credit the viewer with agency and acknowledge the multiple potential meanings of texts. This signified a breakthrough in cultural analyses of readers and spectators and led to a surge of interest in studying audience reception. The emphasis in reception research since has been on the 'agency' of viewers, who 'use' cinema and contribute to the making of its meaning. This research also suggests the possibility of several potential readings or the multiplicity of interpretations a viewer brings to the film. Spectators are 'real people,' who respond to the screen in ways that are determined by both the unconscious and contextual circumstances of the viewing experience. Their readings of a film occur within a particular socio-historical context and they bring to each reading their understanding of the world, of morality, social codes and, of course, perceptions of their own immediate reality. Janice Radway's work on readers of romantic novels was innovative in this regard because she worked\n\n32 John B. Thompson, Ideology and Modern Culture, 104-105.\n\n33 Janet Staiger, Interpreting Films: Studies in the Historical Reception ofAmerican Cinema (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992),71-72.\n\n24 with 'actual' readers in order to understand their interpretive strategies. Radway interviewed a group of women, who borrowed romances from the same bookstore in a town called Smithton. Her work was concerned with how readers' interpretations contested or reaffIrmed the patriarchal ideology inherent in the romance novel. While the readers did not subvert that ideology in their interpretations of the stories, the very act of reading romances and marking out leisure time for themselves in the domestic space of the house was an act of resistance. 34 These readers informed Radway that they juxtaposed both the act of reading the novel and the lives of its protagonists against their perceptions of their own domestic realities. Like books, f11ms are not a priori repositories of meaning that determine reception; the meanings of fIlm texts are constructed by the spectator in a 'context-dependant' manner. This will become evident in viewers' own narratives on the appeal of Indian fIlms, as they relate the attraction of these f11ms to various contextual factors at the time of reception.\n\nEmotional pleasures: escape and identification Our understanding of spectators' reading strategies is enriched by an\n\nacknowledgement of the emotional dimensions ofa spectator's viewing experience. The Russian Nikolai Rubakin, a 'biblio-psychologist,' made one of the earliest pleas for understanding the psychological dimensions of reading texts. For Rubakin, a book was not its author or creator, but the sum total of a reader's emotional experiences, stimulated in the reading process. As he articulated, \"The content of a book we have read, and the qualities we ascribe to its author - this is our own selves.,,3s\n\n34 Janice Radway, Reading the Romance: Women, Patriarclry, and Popular Literature (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1984). 35 Nikolai A.

Sbornik statei (Khar'kov, 1925), 46-49, quoted in Evgenii\n\n25 Rubakin's ideas anticipated the interest of many contemporary western film scholars in the emotional aspects of audience reception. These scholars argued that studies of audiences all too often marginalized the element of 'pleasure' . Entertainment was dismissed as 'mere' pleasure or escape, an assumption based on many moviegoers' lack of 'rational' explanation for their enjoyment of a film.36 In her study of viewers in Holland who enjoyed watching 'Dallas,' Ian Aug proposed that pleasure was neither 'automatic' nor 'natural.' Instead, one had to \"investigate which mechanisms lie at the basis of that pleasure, how that pleasure is produced and how it works ....,,37 Many research participants, when asked to explain their interest in Indian films, said cryptically, \"I don't know; I simply enjoyed them, that is all!\" (''Ne znaiu; prosto liubil/a, i vsio!). This hardly meant that they did not know why they enjoyed these films. On the contrary, their emotional pleasures were 'constructed,' in that they related specifically to features of films and to the viewing context that rendered this entertainment 'pleasurable.' Many film theorists now draw attention to the pleasures of desire and daydreaming that films induce; that is, in other words, the capacity of classical cinema to provide 'escape.' In this regard, Ernst Bloch's concept of hope-landscapes to explain the escapist appeal of Hollywood cinema is of particular importance. Here, hope referred to a vision of a better world and life and represented the utopian aspect of classical cinema. Bloch described cinema's utopian effects as \"the world offairytale, brightened distance in travel, the dance, the dream-factory of film, the example of theater.\" Thus, while classical cinema of the melodramatic or science fiction kind was not inherently utopian, its\n\nDobrenko, The Making oj the State Reader.

Richard Dyer used Bloch's theory of hope-landscapes to articulate further the escapist functions of classical cinema and entertainment, and to highlight the emotional dimension of the movies. However, the significance of Dyer's contribution was his emphasis on the historical and cultural settings in which that utopian element of entertainment acquired its meaning for the spectator. He wrote: \"It is important to grasp that modes of experiential art and entertainment correspond to different culturally and historically determined sensibilities.\" Dyer constructed a model to understand escape, by juxtaposing the emotional appeal of cinema against the social inadequacies it helped mitigate. According to him, the utopian element in cinema offered the audience abundance, energy, intensity, transparency, and community, as respite from scarcity, exhaustion, dreariness, manipulation and fragmentation in society.39 Entertainment's ability to compensate for shortcomings (real or perceived) in social or personal lives was at the heart of its escapist appeal, according to Dyer. Therefore, escape was only possible if the elements of a film addressed and offered respite from viewers' real problems.\n\nIf escape is defined in this manner, then it becomes equally important to consider what viewers recognize as familiar in the films they watch. A spectator's enjoyment of what she/he sees on the screen can be fuelled by herlhis identification with the cinema. Andrew Tudor offered a model of identification that concerned not only the viewing experience, but also cinematic pursuits outside the movie-hall. He posited the existence of context-specific and diffuse manifestations of identification. Within context-specific\n\n38 Jane M. Gaines, \"DreamlFactol)',\" in Reinventing Film Studies, ed. Christine Gledhill and Linda Williams (London: Arnold Publishers, 2000),107-110. 39 Jackie Stacey, Star Gazing, Hollywood Cinema and Female Spectatorship (New York.: Routledge, 1994),92-93\n\n27 identification, Tudor further singled out high identification, where the spectator becomes one with the character portrayed and feels personally involved in the unfolding of the plot. Low identification is emotional affinity with a character, whose ideas and views of morality, as well as other features, the audience member shares. Tudor defmed the second form of identification as 'diffuse,' occurring once the viewing process is over, outside the cinema. Here, high diffuse identification is a more intensive process of projection; the spectator begins to live and act as he/she imagines the star to live. Low diffuse identification refers to imitation, which is very common among young audiences. 40 Jackie Stacey referred to these categories of identification as cinematic and extra-cinematic identification in her work on British movie fans' memories of Hollywood f1lms in the fifties and sixties. Here, extra-cinematic identification also encompasses the activities some viewers indulge in as a result of their identification with the films. These models are a useful point of departure; but ultimately, it is each individual viewer who must suggest to us the specific combination of socio-historical, cultural and personal circumstances that render the emotional pleasures of escape and identification so important for him or her.\n\nAudience productivitylpublic participation\n\nRecent research into audience productivity suggests ways to classify various types of audience activity and film reception. In displaying extra-cinematic identification and publicly expressing their love for films, some members of the audience invest even more energy in reception than do others in the audience and qualify to be called movie fans. Kathryn Fuller's work on movie fan culture in early twentieth century America, for\n\n40 Jackie Stacey, SUlr Gazing, 136.\n\n28 instance, drew attention to the productivity of fans who wrote scenarios and fan mail. Fuller concluded that such activities, encouraged by movie magazines even as critics looked askance at movie fan behaviour, increased film enthusiasts' sense of participation in the movies. 41 The ways in which avid moviegoers invest in the movies are fundamental to our understanding of audience reception. In his attempt to defme audience productivity and fandom, John Fiske outlined three types of audience productivity. According to him, the fITst type of audience productivity is 'semiotic' productivity, which encompasses the ways in which all audience members read films and try to make sense of their lives. These spectators are productive, but are not necessarily fans. Moviefans demonstrate 'enunciative' and/or 'textual' productivity. Spectators\n\ndemonstrating 'enunciative productivity' engage in fan-talk or ''the generation and circulation of certain meanings of the object offandom within a local community.\" Those who style their hair or dress in a way that identifies them with the stars they love also participate in 'fan-talk. ,42 On the other hand, fans who write screenplays based on fllms they love, or Madonna fans who make their own videos of her songs exemplifY textual productivity. Finally, fans also attempt to collect cultural knowledge that might bridge the distance between themselves and the cultural form they enjoy. Fiske called this 'cultural capital,' as fans try to gain a 'full' understanding of the making offllms, the off-screen personas of stars, and the culture that produced the fllms. 43 For Fiske, this was 'capital'\n\n41 Kathryn Fuller, At the Picture Show. Sma/I-Town Audiences and the Creation ofMovie Fan Culture (Washington: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1996), 115-168. 42 John Fiske, \"The Cultural Economy ofFandom,\" In The Adoring Audience: Fan Culture and Popular Media, ed.

Lewis (London and New York: Routledge, 1992),37-39.\n\n43 Fiske, \"The Cultural Economy of Fandom,\" 42-45.\n\n29 because these moviegoers acquire a sense of ownership and, possibly, empowerment from the possession of fIlm-related knowledge or 'things.' Such an understanding of audience productivity is helpful as I discuss Soviet viewers' film-related activities with regard to Indian melodramas and the entrenchment of these fIlms in Soviet popular culture.44\n\nDid Soviet enthusiasts for Indian melodramas have a public and legitimate presence\n\nin post-Stalinist society?\n\nIn order to address the second central question, this project also considers policy issues, the nature of media discourse on Indian cinema, perceptions about admirers of melodrama, and those admirers' public participation. The purpose of this question is to understand the context that shaped the audience's behaviour, as well as the legitimacy and visibility of its presence. While this analysis does not directly draw on theory, it has been buttressed by concepts of intertextuality and interpretive communities in media studies.\n\nInter-textuality, interpretive communities Reception occurs in a discursive context, a context where other interpretations and 'knowledge' or information about individual fIlms, cinema and stars circulate. AngloAmerican research on audience reception now takes into consideration how non-filmic texts may affect the reading of a film; these non-filmic texts may be advertisements, reviews, and/or fIlm gossip. These texts are circulated outside the film-viewing space 44 Sociologists in the Soviet Union seldom used the word 'fanatiki' or 'fans.' Instead, they preferred the term 'ki1Wliubiteli' or 'film enthusiasts' to refer to those who related 'seriously' to cinema, and 'poklonniki' or 'admirers' to refer to Indian melodramas' loyal fans. By this definition. 'admirers' were those who were unthinking, unreflective in their appreciation of films, while ki1W-liubiteli had the advantage of education, critical faculty and taste in their appreciation of cinema. The near absence of the term 'fan' in Soviet discourse on the audience, however, does not signity the absence of moviegoers who displayed fan-like behaviour.\n\n30 with the intention of holding audience interest. In this regard, a useful tenn is intertextuality, which refers to the totality of texts and discourses that defme and shape\n\nspectatorship. Movie spectatorship is not only a product of the viewing experience, but also of these 'texts' or knowledges that contribute to the ways in which a fIlm is read or enjoyed. 45 These discourses may exercise varying degrees of influence on moviegoers' expectations before they enter the cinema. In her work, Fuller demonstrated that the burgeoning American fIlm press of the twenties contributed to the shaping of audience preferences by building star images and disseminating just enough information about their personal lives to pique the interest of movie fans. The rise of the movie fan in early twentieth century America had as much to do with ftlm-related promotion and publicity, as it had with the screen stars. 46 Other scholars have also suggested the importance of foreknowledge or previous exposure to ftlms in shaping viewers' readings. Richard Dyer indicated four external factors that may shape audience reactions to fIlms or audience foreknowledge. These are knowledge of a story (especially when fIlms are based on books), familiar characters that recur in a series of ftlms, promotion or publicity, expectations of a star or genre based on past exposure to both, and criticism and reviews. 47 It is impossible to evaluate the 'exact' measure of influence these texts may exercise on audiences. As Robert Allen suggests in his discussion of developments in fl.lm research, it is only possible to \"attempt to contextualize historical activations of fIlmic texts by taking a stab (and that's all it is) at the cultural repertoires audiences might have brought with them to the theater.'.48 This approach to studying movie spectatorship involves looking beyond the ftlm show and 45 Robert Allen, \"From Exhibition to Reception: Reflections on the audience in film history,\" Screen 31, no. 4 (1990): 354; Janet Staiger,Interpreting Films, 45-48. 46 Kathryn Fuller, At the Picture Show, 115-168. 47 Richard Dyer, Stars (London: British Film Institute, 1998), 107-108. 48 Robert Allen, \"From Exhibition to Reception,\" 354.\n\n31 viewing context to the various know ledges and cultural assumptions outside the theater, which operate along with moviegoers' expectations and criteria to determine a film's reception. Moreover, policy makers, cultural mediators (critics and sociologists) and moviegoers act as interpretive communities in that they bring to the movies certain shared ideas about cinema and its purpose. Stanley Fish used the phrase 'interpretive community' to refer to literary scholars who share assumptions about literature, its goals and literary criticism. 49 As a concept, however, it is flexible enough to be used in other cultural analyses. The phrase 'interpretive' community' does not imply conformity or unanimity in spectators' or readers' interpretations of a text. Members of such a community may differ in their selection of favorite characters or plots but share basic expectations of a book or a film. The commonalities are in the criteria by which they assign value and interpret the film or book.\n\nTo form an understanding of the reception Indian melodramas received in Soviet society, I propose to bring to its analysis these understandings of agency, of the emotional dimensions of the spectators' world, and of the types of productivity in which they engaged, as they enjoyed and sustained a popular culture of Indian movies. Additionally, concepts of inter-textuality and interpretive communities can be of help as I consider the ideas and evaluative criteria that various groups brought to these films and to their interaction with each other in post-Stalinist Soviet society.\n\n49 Stanley Fish.

As articulated in the Preface, I undertook this project with 'foreknowledge' of the many reasons for Indian films' popularity among Soviet audiences, and this provoked my intellectual quest to understand the historical significance of this phenomenon. In contemplating the organization of this dissertation, I thought it important that the reader also be aware from the very beginning of the wealth of ways in which Indian films appealed to their admirers in the Soviet Union. Once the reader is armed with knowledge about the needs these films met for their admirers, it becomes more relevant to understand how other actors related both to the films and their avid audience. Thus, the dissertation begins with audience memories as the fundament; the reader then proceeds to consider the historical context of that reception using these viewers' recollections as a constant point of reference. This structure draws immediate attention to the spectatorship, which is at the heart of cultural practices surrounding any cinema. The variety of research methods and diversity of sources also shaped this organization. I structured the chapters so that the narrative begins with retrospective accounts and then proceeds to analyze contemporary historical records. The first chapter is an introduction to the recollections of the melodrama audience, while the subsequent chapters concern policy considerations with regard to Indian melodramas, cultural mediators' perspectives on melodramas and their audience, and the contemporary audience's own vocal participation in the discussion on Indian popular films.\n\n33 In Chapter 1, I place Indian melodrama admirers center-stage and examine the pleasures they derived from watching these films. The purpose of this chapter is to unravel the reasons why many moviegoers were drawn to Indian melodramas. Viewers were asked how they recalled the appeal of Indian films in the past, why they enjoyed Indian melodramas and how the viewing context shaped their movie going experiences. Furthermore, I was interested to know how admirers extended the pleasures of viewing these films into activities outside the cinema. These viewers' responses and narratives represent a valuable source for understanding audience preferences and the manifestation of these choices in viewers' film-related activities. Having examined the ways in which these films are remembered by their supporters, the subsequent chapters explore the trajectory of these films from import to reception. Chapters 2, 3 and 4 examine the historical context that determined audience reception of these films. Chapter 2 discusses how Indian films were selected in Bombay and made their way to Soviet theaters. In this chapter, I am interested in understanding why the state met the audience's need for entertainment by importing melodramas, and how this policy goal could be reconciled with its ideological objection to 'bourgeois' melodramas. Here, the endeavor is to understand whose needs the import policy eventually meet. The import and release of these films in Soviet theaters was inevitably followed by press reviews and other forms of public discussions. I proceed in Chapter 3 to consider the discourse on Indian cinema, which took shape in the press, filmjoumals, and academia. Critics andlor scholars functioned at the interface of state and society and it is important to understand their position on Indian melodramas, vis-a-vis policy makers and the melodrama audience. This chapter explores press and academic articles/reviews on Indian\n\n34 cinema and seeks to understand the extent to which this body of writing took cognizance of the desires and interests of the audience. In the final chapter, I return to the leading protagonists in this dissertation - the movie audience. The audience takes center-stage again as I examine the letters that movie enthusiasts (both admirers and debunkers of Indian melodramas) wrote to the film press and to Goskino between the fifties and the end of the Soviet period. This chapter begins with prevalent sociological concerns about many spectators' partiality to entertaining cinematic genres, and proceeds to examine audience participation in forums meant for the purpose of their involvement. It intends to assess the public opportunities available for the melodrama audience to speak plainly about their favorite films. This chapter also proposes to examine how film officials and cultural mediators responded to the expressed views of Indian melodrama admirers. Thus, the four chapters that follow chart the acquisition, discussion, and reception of the films, processes that shaped the meaning of Indian popular cinema in post-Stalinist Soviet society.\n\nSources This dissertation is a product of both archival and ethnographic investigations in\n\nMoscow and its suburbs. Research was conducted at the State Archive ofthe Russian\n\nFederation (GARF), the Russian State Archive for Contemporary History (RGANI), the Russian State Archive for Literature and Art (RGALI), Rusexportfil'm (formerly Soveksportfil'm) archives, the Goskino archives, the Russian State Library, and the libraries of Rosinformkino, the Film Center, the State Institute of Cinematography (VGJK), the Institute for Scientific Research on Cinema (NIJK) and the Institute for\n\nScientific Information in the Social Sciences (INION). Some crucial archival holdings\n\n35 regarding foreign cinema and movie audiences were still classified when I conducted my research. These challenges presented me with an opportunity to be eclectic in my selection of source materials. The dissertation has benefited from a diverse range of sources that includes personal interviews, policy documents, newspaper and journal articles, sociological surveys, and the audience's own correspondence with the authorities. Above all, it was important to me to understand why many moviegoers enjoyed Indian melodramas. In order to address this question, I distributed questionnaires to reach a broad group of respondents who remembered and appreciated the early Indian films of the fifties and sixties. I built on these fmdings by conducting interviews with those who watched Indian films with interest between 1954 and 1991. Thirty-three surveys and 53 interviews reveal the attraction of Indian melodramas in the past and demonstrate the associations these films acquired for many viewers in the Soviet movie audience. Our understanding of movie going in the past can be enhanced by examining viewer statistics, although quantitative data do not reveal what moviegoers thought of the films they watched. The only compilation of Soviet viewership statistics used in this project was provided by Rosinformkino (formerly Sovinformkino), the center for film information in Moscow. The extensive Goskino records of audience turnout for domestic and foreign films in each Soviet republic continue to be for the 'use of staff' only. I was initially granted access to the records, but denied permission within a day. I continue to be in contact with Goskino archives, in the hope of a change in policy. For insights into how Soviet moviegoers participated in the public space that cinema provided in the past, I consider viewers' letters sent to policy makers and the film press between the fifties and the eighties. Audience members with divergent views on Indian popular cinema wrote letters to Goskino between the sixties and the eighties.\n\n36 Many of these letters have been preserved; only the files for the years from 1981 to 1986 are reportedly missing. The filmjoumal, Iskusstvo Kino (The Art of Film) archived readers/moviegoers' letters for the years from 1952 until 1958. Sovetskii Ekran (Soviet Screen) was the self-proclaimed 'mass journal,' and naturally received letters from readers/moviegoers. The archives of this journal were destroyed in 1991 due to lack of space and funding. However, this loss is partially mitigated by the fact that Sovetskii Ekran published letters regularly in its forum pages. Thus, viewers' letters written\n\nbetween the early fifties and the end of the Soviet period, both published and unpublished, augment the interviews and questionnaires conducted for this dissertation. The study of Soviet import policy draws on the records ofSoveksportfil'm, the organization charged with film import and export in the Soviet Union. The documents concerning the final selection offihns from capitalist countries (as India was categorized) are still classified and inaccessible. Nevertheless, Soveksportfil'm's annual reports and plans and correspondence between regional offices in India, Goskino, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are available for research. These documents on importation are supplemented by early records of cultural relations between India and the Soviet Union before the institutionalization of the film trade. The analysis of critical writing on Indian cinema considers a spectrum of sources, including articles and reviews that appeared in filmjoumals and a vast array of central and regional newspapers in the Soviet Union between the fifties and the eighties. These writings range from film analyses to general articles on Indian cinema, and include examples of promotional coverage of Indian films. For the exploration of sociological surveys, this dissertation relies on published sociological research in the form of monographs and articles. Monographs and edited volumes of articles are only to be found in specialist libraries; often they are the only\n\n37 remaining copies in circulation. The sarveys that inform these publications are not available for public access. Finally, archival and ethnographic fmdings are supplemented by numerous conversations with film specialists and film professionals in Russia. This project is enriched by formal interviews with Naum Kleiman (film scholar; currently director at the Museum of Cinema in Moscow), Kirill Razlogov, (film scholar, former member of the selection committee for films from capitalist countries and festival selection committee; currently director of the Institute of Culturology), Aleksandr Lipkov (film scholar and Indian film specialist) and Natal' ia Sosina (employee in the editorial department and readers' letters department of the film journal Sovetskii Ekran). Also of benefit were the informal conversations or exchanges with Vera Gribanova (former employee at the Department ofCinematization and Film Release), Maia Turovskaia (film scholar and critic), Mikhail Brashinsky (film scholar, critic, filmmaker) and Iurii Kolosov (former Soveksportfil'm official; currently director of the international cinema department of the Union of Cinematographers). These specialists confirmed that Indian melodramas were exceptionally popular with Soviet audiences, that they \"consistently surpassed other foreign films in viewing figures,\"so and that they played a \"unique and exciting role in Soviet popular culture until the end of the Soviet period.\"S! These interviews and exchanges were at'\"1 indispensable asset as they inspired new research questions and underscored the importance of my topic.\n\nParameters It is also essential to explain the rationale for this project's temporal parameters-\n\n1954-1991. I knew from contacts in the field and relevant literature that the first Indian 50 Kirill Razlogov. interview by author. tape-recording, Moscow, October 2002. 5] Mikhail BraBhinsky, email correspondence with author. February 2003.\n\n38 popular films had great significance for the early post-Stalinist audience. In the contemporary Russian press this period is remembered with nostalgia, as illustrated below:\n\nForty years ago, Indian cinema conquered the Soviet Union ... the 1954 festival of Indian films was a real sensation. Bypassing the iron curtain from the east, these films, with their songs, dances and unusual stars, were a colossal success here and ran in house-full auditoriums (ftogi, 1997).52 Similar fond recollections appeared in another article in the late nineties:\n\nThe older generation remembers ... the triumphant success of the film 'The Vagabond,'53 which opened the rich and colorful world of Indian cinema to Soviet viewers. Everywhere people hummed the melodies of the films, and the lead actors Raj Kapoor and Nargis54 became so popular that parents named their children after them (Trudovaia gazeta, 1998).55 Clearly, the fITSt films were extremely significant given the particular historical context in which they were released in Soviet theaters. However, I was persuaded to reconsider the period demarcations of my project when confronted with the conventions of popular memory. Pre-dissertation field interviews demonstrated that many viewers did not recollect specific plots or scenes that moved them; they remembered the general 'emotions' associated with the film viewing. These recollections were based on not only the fITSt ftlms in the fifties, but also the viewing of subsequent Indian ft1ms between the sixties and nineties. Considering that viewers' narratives would encompass a greater period than any academic classification can presume to prescribe, I chose also to consider 52 Evgenii Gol'ianov, \"Sud'ba brodiagi,\" itogi, 11 February 1997, 70-71. 53 'The Vagabond' was the most popular film among domestic and foreign movies in Soviet theaters; its 63.7 million viewers were the largest audience of the decade. See Appendix II for a description of popular films cited in the text of this dissertation. 54 Raj Kapoor and Nargis were the lead stars in 'The Vagabond.' See Appendix II for brief bios of the Indian melodrarns stars most frequently mentioned in this dissertation. 55 Israil' Kogan, \"Vozvrashenie 'Brodiagi,' Torgovaia Gazeta, 16 September 1998.\n\n39 the reception of later day Indian films. Moreover, contacts in the region constantly brought to my attention the extent of Indian films' popularity in the seventies and eighties. I met several younger viewers, whose delight at being taken seriously and having their interests considered legitimate was infectious. Thus, the temporal framework of this dissertation also expanded to accommodate the enthusiastic participation of those I met in the field. Furthermore, the choice of period was guided by the availability of archival and other sources. Documents regarding policymaking were sparse for the fifties, but substantial for the seventies. Press coverage of Indian cinema was extensive in the fifties and even more abundant in the seventies and eighties. Goskino preserved viewers' letters sent between the mid-sixties and mid-eighties, and viewer mail appeared most frequently in filmjoumals after the late sixties. Clearly, the late sixties, the seventies, and the eighties were best represented in policy papers, film criticism, sociological research and audience letters. However, no study of Indian melodramas in the Soviet Union can afford to exclude the reception of the first films of the fifties. In view of an these circumstances, I chose the solution that would optimally employ the available sources; I elected to cover the entire period. The analysis of preferences and expectations that movie enthusiasts, importers, and cultural mediators brought to Indian melodramas favored a thematic organization. Within each theme - viewers' memories, policy making, critical writing and audience participation - , I have taken into consideration other historical factors in the Soviet Union and India that contributed to changes in the reception of Indian cinema in the Soviet Union.\n\n40\n\nThe use of policy documents, critical writing, sociological surveys and audience letters, combined with questionnaires and personal interviews, constitutes a holistic approach to studying the place ofIndian melodramas in Soviet society. The ensuing chapters propose to examine why the audience for Indian melodramas came to exist and how public and acceptable its presence was in post-Stalinist society.\n\n41\n\nChapter 1\n\nVIEWERS REMEMBER INDIAN MELODRAMAS\n\n\"I liked watching Indian films. 1 I would go for several shows in a day sometimes ... I was never satisfied with one show.\" (Leontina Boiarshchina,2 on watching Indian films in the fifties and sixties)\n\n\"The postman went from door to door announcing 'Today! Indian film show!' The people on the kolkhoz tried finishing their work early in the fields and at home, and then rushed to watch the film . They waited all night in the cold . .. for the film to arrive . .. .\" (Igor Belotserkovskii, on the popularity of Indian films in Western Ukraine in the fifties and sixties).\n\n\"We enjoyed Indian films . .. how we cried during these shows. I wept so much. The young men in our neighborhood would accompany us and say \"Oh god, why do you spend 40 kopecks to shed so many tears?\" We cried enough tears to make the Indian Ocean.\" (Valentina Kireeva, on the films of the fifties and sixties).\n\n\"There was such a crowd to see 'Disco Dancer,3 ... , it is very hot in Tadjikistan and people jostled each other for tickets. One man was killed in the rush for tickets.\" (Asmatbek Shakarbekov, on the popularity of Indian films in the eighties)\n\n\"Once I had children, I did not go out much. However, I went once a week to the Indian film club . .. This time was sacrosanct, non-negotiable. A friend was in love with Mithun4 ••. she recently traveled to India, looked for his home and waited outside to meet him. It was only her return ticket home that forced her to abandon her wait.\" (Irina Fazlova, on the popularity of Indian films in the eighties and nineties).\n\nI Viewers who are aware of the many film schools in India distinguish between melodramas and the 'more serious' cinema; otherwise, Soviet moviegoers used 'indiiskiejil'my' to refer exclusively to Indian popular films because of the latter's predominance in Soviet theaters. 2 Interviewees are referred to by name. See Appendix V for interviewee profile. Names in the appendix are listed in order of first appearance in the text. 3 See Appendix II for a listing and brief description of the Indian melodramas cited in this text and I or generally mentioned in conversations about Indian cinema in the Soviet Union. 4 See Appendix II for descriptions of Indian melodrama stars most frequently mentioned by viewers.\n\n42\n\nMelodramas from India were consistently wen-received in Soviet theaters, 5 and public demand for them was legendary. A verse submitted by a reader to the ftlmjoumal\n\nSovetskii Ekran in 1971 suggested that only an Indian yogi could withstand the wait in the serpentine queues for tickets to Indian popular films. 6 The first Indian ftlm shown in the Soviet Union in 1949 was a realist ftlm about the partition of the Indian subcontinent, but it went largely unnoticed by Soviet movie audiences. 7 Indian melodramas made their\n\ngrand entry in the Soviet Union in 1954, when a ftlm festival was held in Moscow and the rest of the country. These films and their actors charmed Soviet moviegoers instantaneously and continued to evoke audience appreciation until the late perestroika years. This chapter engages Indian melodrama enthusiasts in a discussion of the\n\npleasures of viewing Indian popular films in the past. How do viewers recan the role of Indian melodramas in their lives, and the enjoyment of the viewing experience at an Indian ftlm show? What did Soviet moviegoers seek and fmd in Indian melodramas? How did these films shape admirers' perceptions of their own realities and lives? Section I presents the findings of my questionnaire on the importance of the cinema in the fifties and sixties, and on viewers' enthusiasm for Indian melodramas in these initial decades. Section II discusses and analyzes the appeal of Indian melodramas as articulated by viewers in interviews conducted for this project; it also considers some moviegoers' disillusionment with these films over the years.\n\n5 See Appendix I, Table 1.1 and 1.2, for a compilation of audience statistics. The original, extensive data on audience turnout are still classified. However, Kirill Razlogov has worked with the comprehensive statistical data on audience turnout (for other research purposes), and confinned that the data consistently showed that Indian films drew larger audiences than any other foreign films until the end of the Soviet period. Razlogov, interview, October 2002.\n\n6 \"Mini retsenzii,\" Sovetskii Ekran 15 (1971): 21. 7 None of the respondents or interviewees remembered seeing these films and believed that the first Indian fiJms to be screened in the Soviet Union were those of the 1954 festival.\n\n43\n\nStudying historical reception\n\nBefore discussing the questionnaire and interview fmdings, it would be helpful to consider the methodology employed in this research. Cultural history and mm history have seen very few works on audiences because the sources available to understand how viewers interpreted films in the past are few. In any society, contemporary ftlmjournals are the obvious place to begin since they published readers/ viewers' letters that expressed interest in cinema. However, published letters always undergo a process of selection and only fragments make it to the journal pages. Additionally, writing letters to journals represents only one form of reception and these letters cannot indicate the range of ways in which films were appreciated. Therefore, such letters cannot be the exclusive source for studying historical reception. Undaunted by the paucity of data on audience reception in history, some scholars have persisted in the effort to understand spectators' interpretations offllms in the past. For instance, Jackie Stacey sought to study historical audience reception by inviting responses from readers of popular film magazines in Great Britain. 8 She asked readers to write about their memories of watching Hollywood fIlms in the forties and fifties, and used their letters to discuss textual interpretations, as well as memories of the context of that reception. The work of such scholars has inspired the methodology and line of questioning employed in this research. Faced with constraints such as the absence of extensive archives of viewers' letters, and given the fragmented nature of published letters, interviews and questionnaires were the best means to uncover an area of Soviet history that has suffered neglect in scholarship. 8 Jackie Stacey, Star Gazing: Hollywood Cinema and Female Spectatorship (New York: Routledge, 1994).\n\n44\n\nIn studying historical movie spectatorship, it is imperative that we also understand the role memory plays in reconstructing a picture of past audience reception. Unlike anthropology, which uses the participant-observation method to study audiences at a movie show or engages movie audiences about contemporary films, historical analyses of audience reception have to rely on spectators' memory. As indicated in the Introduction, viewers who participated in this project mainly remembered the emotional experience of watching an Indian f11m, or the generic elements of the films that appealed to them. Their narratives and responses rarely evoked specific scenes; only a fraction of these viewers recalled particular scenes in various films that have remained memorable. Subsequent information garnered about the stars and familiarity with later-day Indian popular films also shaped participants' accounts of why this cinema appealed in the past. Moreover, memories of going to an Indian film show in the past were usually nostalgic recollections of childhood or university years and the corresponding 'innocence' of that phase of life. The act of recollecting films in the Soviet period provoked spontaneous comparisons with contemporary film repertoires and viewers' movie going habits today. Therefore, retrospective accounts of reception are much more than specific readings of film texts; they are statements about the socio-historical context of past reception and\n\ncontemplative observations about the present. Participants in the questionnaires and interviews conducted for this project enjoyed watching Indian melodramas between 1954 and 1991. Their recollections indicate the many expectations these viewers brought to the movies and the needs that the viewing of Indian melodramas met. Although not statistically representative of the larger\n\n45\n\nmovie audience, these participants' observations are representative of the views generally offered by Soviet admirers of Indian melodramas. 9\n\nSECTION I:\n\nREMEMBERING INDIAN FILMS: QUESTIONNAIRE FINDINGS\n\nMy questionnaire was intended to elicit information about the early Indian films and the importance of the cinema as a leisure activity in the Soviet Union of the fifties and sixties. 10 As indicated in the Introduction to this dissertation, in Soviet and postSoviet writing this first phase of Indian films is remembered as a significant event in the lives of domestic audiences. Therefore, it seemed crucial to focus on audience reception of these initial melodramas; interviews would subsequently expand the period of the project to include later-day viewers. The sampling strategy was 'purposive' or 'theoretical.' I sought respondents who had been active moviegoers in the fifties and sixties and were part of the early enthusiastic audience for Indian films in the fifties. It was essential that respondents had been avid viewers of Indian melodramas because I was keen to understand the attraction of these films and the needs they met in the post-Stalinist context. Respondents born in the early 19408 or earlier would qualiry, as they would remember conscious reception of the first films in 1954. Since the research subject was Indian films' reception in the fifties and sixties, respondents born in the 1950s were also eligible to complete the 9 I was gratified to observe convergences between the reasonings of respondentslinterviewees and tlJose offered by many Indian melodrama viewers in their own letters to the film press and the state between the fifties and the eighties.
