        "text": "The explanation for the BJP's success lies elsewhere—in the post-Mandal churning process begun in the summer of 1990—and the sharp caste polarisation that took place in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. In this scenario, the traditional upper caste support for the Congress defected to the BJP which, in months prior to the elections, was violently opposed to reservations for the backward castes in government jobs. This is the single most important factor which helped the BJP, though its appeal was still limited to only some urban constituencies.\n\nLet us now turn to the Samata party's disengagement from the Janata Dal and its eventual attachment to the BJP. For one, the combination is engaged in an electoral combat for the first time so that they convey mixed and often confusing signals to their potential supporters. Second, in Bihar's exclusively caste-ridden parties, this entente cordiale does not reflect the complex social currents coming together. It represents, at best, simple caste arithmetic. Finally, the Samata Party leaders, chiefly Nitish Kumar and George Fernandes, have pinned their hopes on the Kurmis, the progressive and prosperous agricultural caste in central Bihar, notably in Patna, Nalanda and adjoining districts. They may find an important ally amongst the dominant Bhumihars who, in the absence of any organised caste formation of their own and the diminishing appeal of the Congress, may willy-nilly rally around the Samata Party to break Laloo Yadav's caste coalition. Yet, the strategy may not work. The party may pick up a few seats without being able to disturb the status quo. The Yadav-Muslim alliance, masterminded by the chief minister, has come to stay for some time and is most likely to erode the Samata-BJP combination. Laloo Yadav has, moreover, mobilised the Rajputs, many of whom are still tied to the Janata Dal and are loyal to V.P. Singh. In many constituencies Rajputs are pitted against the Samata Party candidates.\n\nBoth in Patna and Ranchi there are mixed reactions to the BJP's electoral fortunes. One thing is clear. The RSS and the BJP have enlarged their support base in south Bihar since 1967 when their cadres earned much goodwill among the famine-stricken people of the region. Since then they have gained a foothold on the strength of their newly-created non-Christian Dalit constituencies. At the same time, they have incur red the wrath of the Christians and the Muslims.\n\nIn 1991, the BJP returned five candidates from the south Bihar constituencies. Three years later, Samata Party legislators broke away from the Janata Dal, and only eight of them returned to the Vidhan Sabha in the 1995 elections. In brief, the Samata-BJP combination is an untested one and their gains, jointly, are unlikely to exceed beyond four seats. So, if the BJP could win five seats, the alliance would not be able to send more than seven to nine MPs to Delhi.\n\nIn Uttar Pradesh, on the other hand, there were serious fissures in the Congress movement. A section was no doubt wedded to Nehru's vision of a secular and socialist society, but the Brahmin-dominated Congress leadership had different ideas. Thus, the consolidation of the Hindu vote started with Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant, its first chief minister. The Hindi agitation, as also the cow slaughter movement, was conducted under the aegis of the Congress. It is no coincidence that the Ram idol was placed in the Babri Masjid in 1949, with Pant still at the helm of affairs. Years later the shilanyas was performed under Congress auspices. In other words, the Congress on its own offered suffi-cient space to the BJP to organise its mobilisation campaign.\n\nSCHOLARS and administrators alike dwell on the absence of land reforms in Bihar. This fact alone has enabled the Left movement, though weak and fragmented, to act as a bulwark against communal and revisionist trends. In Uttar Pradesh, by contrast, the CPI or CPI(M) have not made much headway. This is because their agenda was, to some extent, appropriated by the Congress (abolition of zamindari in 1954) and by non-Congress governments led by, notably, Charan Singh, The SVD and the Lok Dal forged cross-communal alliances, especially in western Uttar Pradesh, but it was not easy to either stem the communal tide or to erode the base of the Jan Sangh/BJP.\n\nIf the contrast between Uttar Pradesh and Bihar is real, how does one explain the recurrence of communal riots in Bihar? Clearly, one must not put the blame squarely on the BJP. After all, the Bhagalpur riots of 1984 took place with the Congress in power. An inept administration watched helplessly as 2,000 Muslims were murdered, their property looted or burnt down. Everyone we spoke to argued that the Bhagalpur riots constitute a watershed insofar as the Muslims, regardless of caste and class, abandoned the Congress. It symbolised said, Qazi Mujahidul Islam Qasimi, head of the Imarat-e-Shariah in Phulwari Sharif, the \"parting of ways\".\n\nTo understand Laloo's appeal, one has to follow him on the campaign trail. There are no promises of major projects, what Nehru called the new temples of India, no unwrapping of a spectacular economic package. He comes across as a man-next-door from the village, who has cast himself as a wandering mendicant, one who beckons the poorest of the poor, the wretched of the earth to join hands and \"march on Delhi\" to \"capture the Red Fort\". He adds: \"We have had enough tea at the Islampur street corner; let us now have tea in New Delhi's Connaught Place.\" In this conversational manner, without promising anything of substance, Laloo conjures up a vision of Bihar's poor inclusion in the governance of Delhi. The surprise is that this huge promise does not ring hollow when it comes from Laloo because he rattles off the list of communities who in the past had to keep their heads bowed in the village and who are now represented in the assembly, the legislative council and Parliament. His recent list of nominees to the council includes a Bind (earth digger), Tauti (weaver), Kumhar (potter), Lohar (blacksmith), Amat (landless labourer) and so on.\n\nIN the past five years of Laloo's reign,\" comments Dr Saibal Gupta, \"the most oppressed and suppressed have been imparted a new consciousness, confidence and social identity.\" A comparison with Mulayam Singh Yadav would be misplaced. The Samajwadi Party leader, insists Gupta, operates within the parameters set by Charan Singh's agrarian politics and is thus part of the \"vernacular elite\". Laloo starts from a base similar to Mulayam but reaches out to new, sometimes obscure groups at the lower extremity of the caste ladder—rat catchers, scavengers and worse off castes.\n\nBy reaching out to an ever-increasing constituency beyond the pale, Laloo has invested his personality with a charisma of inexhaustible potential. His larger-than-life image has been able to cushion the animal husbandry scam. \"It is an upper-caste plan to tarnish his image,\" murmurs Charan Das, a tea-stall owner in Jehanabad. \"He is appealing to those on the fringes of the market or those outside the market,\" says Gupta. \"This is a gigantic coalition of the dispossessed.\"\n\n\"What Laloo Prasadji has been able to ensure for us is the security of our lives and property,\" says Qazi M.O. Siddiqui, a minister in Laloo's cabinet. \"Traditionally, secular Hindu leaders visited Muslims to console them or give them protection. Laloo is the first Hindu leader who reached out to the Hindu masses to convince them that the communal divide would weaken the cause of the poor,\" he adds.\n\nLaloo was always on the spot to control the riots that broke out after the fall of the Babri Masjid. And the self-respect he has given to the poor is something no Indian leader has been able to give the country's oppressed.\" Laloo travels either by a privately hired helicopter or by his \"garib chetna rath\". The consequent 'awakening' is a source of considerable anxiety even to the two communist parties. An influential communist leader said: \"Just look at the leadership of the CPI and CPI(M) in the state. It is packed with the upper castes. If we do not mend our ways and the Laloo juggernaut is not checked, our cadres will desert us and join the Janata Dal.\"\n\nFor the BJP-Samata alliance Laloo's unorthodox methods of lower caste mobilisation present a frightful prospect. \"He is the most corrupt politician the country has even known,\" bellows George Fernandes. Fernandes will probably win because the caste arithmetic in Nalanda—Kurmi, Koeri and Bhumihar—may be able to neutralise the Janata Dal caste alliance backed by Yadav militancy. This militancy is a very real factor in these elections. The Yadavs have been made to feel that their man is about to go to Delhi as prime minister (this is the refrain in all of Laloo's election meetings). Says Professor Sachidanand: \"They feel that their caste pride is at stake.\""
