The Army launched the operation to flush out rebels of the IK Songbijit faction of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB-IKS) after the militants gunned down over 69 Adivasis on December 23, 2014. The operation, which completed a year, is still on. The security situation in the state in 2015 was grim in the aftermath of the mass killings of Adivasis. The scars of the May 2014 killings of 46 Muslims were yet to be healed. Relentless operations resulted in significant improvement of the security situation in the state, with the seizure of more than 443 firearms and many arrests, said Defence Public Relations Officer (PRO), Lieutenant Colonel Suneet Newton. The Army also claimed that most terrorist groups, including NDFB-IKS and Karbi People's Liberation Tigers (KPLT) had gone on the back foot with their activities severely curtailed. \"This was achieved through synergistic intelligence-based joint operations of the Army, Assam Police, Central Armed Police Forces and coordination with the state administration,\" the defence statement added. The Army made sure of community development initiatives to meet the aspirations of Bodoland Territorial Autonomous Districts (BTAD) by organizing events such as the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) Army Goodwill Football Premier League to provide a platform to local youth to showcase their talent. The Army said it will facilitate the success of upcoming events in the state, including the SAF Games and the assembly election.

The overall efforts by the Security Forces have brought insurgency within manageable levels and enabled civil administration to function effectively. The level of violence is at alltime low,” Newton said. He said security situation in Assam had entered 2015 under the most trying circumstances in the aftermath of the massacre of 69 Adivasis, while the scars of May 2014 killings of 46 Muslims had not yet been healed and ‘Operation All Out was launched. Newton further said the successful conduct of military operations had a debilitating effect on the major militant groups in Assam. “Resultantly, most rebel groups such as National Democratic Front of Bodoland (Songbijit) and Karbi People Liberation Tigers (KPLT) have gone on a back foot, with their activities having been severely curtailed, said the spokesperson. This was achieved through synergised intelligence based joint operations of Indian Army with State Police, Central Armed Police Forces and good coordination with State Administration. The operations have resulted in effective conduct of counter terrorism operations, maintaining dominance within the counter terrorism grid and denying space to insurgents.

Seven weapons, including a 303 rifle, were recovered,” said Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar Range, S.R.P. Kalluri. “Keeping in mind the TCOC (Tactical Counter Offensive Campaign) of the Maoists which would be starting from January 2016, the Police forces of all Districts made a plan to hit the Maoists before they can strike at the Security Force. In this context, combined parties of different forces were launched in Abujhmarh area to intercept and neutralise the Maoists. The forces were given the target of Kutul that is in the heart of Abujhmarh area and considered the capital of the Maoists,” he added. The IGP also informed that the Police parties were attacked by the Maoists near Kutul. “Our men retaliated the fire and the encounter lasted for about two hours. Finally, the Maoists tried to flee away from the area taking the cover of heavy forests. But because of an excellent cordon of the Police, three Maoists were nabbed, he claimed.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has started 30 cases of FICN smuggling in which the agency found links with terror modules and money laundering networks. In 2015, the Border Security Force (BSF) seized INR 2,60,82,000 of FICN from the Malda border alone and apprehended 24 couriers.\"Every day they are changing their modus operandi. The most serious issue is not being able to reach the kingpin of these rackets. In no case, we could arrest the handlers. The couriers are arrested and the links get disconnected. At least five agencies are now working together on FICN. However, the seized amount is only 10 per cent of the total flow,\" said a senior official of the committee. The couriers make 2 to 5 per cent on each consignment; profits are huge for those who run the trade. The kingpins get 50 per cent of the amount smuggled into India. Moreover, the racketeers often have links to the terror modules. Mobile phones have reduced the risk, giving smuggling a boost and attracting more people into the racket. The network of Grameenphone, a leading telecom operator in Bangladesh, spills over into the Indian side, making it easier for the smugglers to coordinate their act.

A joint probe by Kolkata Police's Special Task Force (STF), the Delhi Police Crime Branch and special cell, UP STF, and Rajasthan Police, under the guidance of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), arrested 14 ISI operatives across the country since November 14, 2015.The details given by the arrested people also reveal how ISI is keen to access confidential information about India's military. Though the moles had limited access to sensitive information, they could provide a lot of names, and details of procedures and logistics. The penetration of Indian Air Force's (IAF) TACDE (tactical and combat deployment establishment) at Gwalior, the IAF's version of Topgun that develops air combat strategies — was a serious security breach. Elements of Army battle plan 'ORBAT' (order of battle) were compromised as well, said investigators. Spies are increasing with an alarming frequency.

Security agencies suspect that the terrorists crossed the International Border in Punjab through a \"controlled operation\" by a gang involved in the smuggling of narcotics, Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) and arms.The possibility of the involvement of some security personnel with the smuggling gang cannot be ruled out as there have been inputs in the past about some elements being linked to the establishment of the drugs racket, the sources said. A detailed probe and questioning of some people involved in the racket could unearth the conspiracy, they added.Speculation is rife that the heavy arms and ammunition used by the terrorists in the attack were sent over from Pakistan much before the terrorists crossed the International Border. There is a high probability that the arms were sent through the drugs racket and dumped at a designated spot from where the terrorists collected these after crossing the border through a route used by the smugglers, sources said.

Jaisalmer Police have alerted the defence officials to take measures and ask officials to be cautious in the wake of the recent attempts made by Pakistan Intelligence agencies to extract contact details of the defence establishments through internet calls.InterServices Intelligence (ISI), through internet calls, had tried to get landline telephone numbers of officers and troopers of the Indian Army from employees of the BSNL office in Jaisalmer. Such calls were received from Pakistan at the BSNL office here, during the war exercise at Phalsoond area of Pokaran between September to December 2015. According to district telecom officer Yogesh Bhaskar during the war exercise at Pokaran sub division, the Army unit here was allotted new numbers. It was then that the BSNL's accounts division got calls from Pakistan seeking information of telephone bills of unit officers and troopers. The caller also sought numbers of various Army locations. The calls though are made from Pakistan but are identified as those made from New Delhi. \"The callers tried to hide their location through internet calling but we managed to identify their exact location and sounded alert,\" said the BSNL official. He said at that time they could not know that calls were being made from Pakistan and the call attendant gave one or two numbers to Pakistan. \"Later the intelligence agency alerted us that phone call was from Pakistan,\" he said.Defence spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Manish Ojha said Pakistan calls to Army at the border areas is a serious problem. Army forces and their family members get calls and they have been told not to fall in the trap of these calls and not to share any information about the army. \"We have advised defence officials to be careful and also impose restrictions on their own personnel,\" said Superintendent of Police Jaisalmer, Rajiv Pachar. He said that he has written letters to Army, IAF and BSF HQ advising them to keep watch on officers and troopers carrying phones and cameras in sensitive areas.

Praising Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina-led Bangladesh Government for taking action against terrorism, Sarkar said: “Security forces in Bangladesh with the instructions from their government are always pro-active to flush-out militants belonging to Tripura and other Northeastern States and their camps in that country.” “However, there were terrorist camps in Bangladesh territory. There are 16 to 19 camps of Tripura militants in that country. The present government in Bangladesh is always trying to flush out the Indian militants in their territory.”The Chief Minister said Indian militants, taking advantage of the absence of Bangladeshi Security Forces (SFs) in some of the mountainous and bordering areas, have been using remote areas, particularly in the hilly Chittagong Hill Tracts. They continue their activities, including arms training of their cadres. He added that, “We cannot claim that we are successful in curbing militancy entirely in our State because there are still a few hideouts within our State too.” “Occasionally due to pressure of the Bangladesh security forces the militants temporarily shift from their camps but return to their original place once the security forces have moved away. Such hide-and-seek activities are going on and we are aware of them.” He further said, “Even today in our State there are youths who are being misled to join into terrorism and we have to be vigilant on these acts. We have to ensure that the terrorist outfits do not disrupt peace, development and unity in our State and for that the security forces have to increase their vigil.” Read less...\n\nJanuary - 4&nbsp\n\nProtesters pelted stones on Security Forces (SFs), which left seven of them, injured in Srinagar District on January 4, during clashes that triggered when the Shias’ Protested against the execution of top Shia cleric, Sheikh NimralNimr by Saudi Read more...\n\nProtesters pelted stones on Security Forces (SFs), which left seven of them, injured in Srinagar District on January 4, during clashes that triggered when the Shias’ Protested against the execution of top Shia cleric, Sheikh NimralNimr by Saudi Government last week, reports Daily Excelsior.

The Minister visited the Dhubri sector of the border with All Assam Students Union (AASU) leaders and assured that two pilot projects on how to stop infiltration in riverine areas are going on and depending on the success of these two projects, steps will be taken. \"It is a 263 km long border. But gaps are there and these need to be filled up. Covering the riverine stretch is a problem. We hope measures can be worked out depending on the findings of these two pilot projects, which are likely to be completed soon,\" the Minister said addressing a press conference.
