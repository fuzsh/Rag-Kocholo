Films have been ranked according to their box office success in the year of their release. For the 20th century we obtained our information from the archives of BoxOfficeIndia.com and IbosNetwork.com. Wherever there was a difference of opinion between these two authorities we have mentioned the higher rank first.\n\nFilmography: As an actor...\n\n1944-49\n\n1944 Dilip Kumar’s career got off to a good start with his debut film doing fairly well at the box office.\n\n1944 Jwar Bhata No. 6. Not at all bad for a debut film. Quite good, in fact.\n\n1945 An average year for him.\n\n1945 Pratima Not in the Top 7.\n\n1946\n\nMilan (Nauka dubi) was Dilip Kumar's first success (no.3 according to one authority) and the film had an impact on audiences. Dilip Kumar had arrived with his very third film. Some very respected authorities claim that the film was released in 1947. Harmandir Singh 'Hamraaz,' who is the most meticulous chronicler of Filmistan's songs, gets his facts from the most primary of sources: first edition record labels. He has filed Milan's songs under 1946, therefore, Indpaedia believes that there is no room for further debate.\n\n1947 Dilip Kumar had a very good year.\n\n1947 Jugnu No. 1 (BoxOfficeIndia.com) or no. 5 (IbosNetwork.com). Either way, it was Dilip Kumar’s first major hit.\n\n1948 probably was the year in which Dilip Kumar drew close to superstardom. He starred in the no.1 hit, which stirred the nation, and had another two films in the Top 6.\n\n1948 Shaheed was no.1 on some charts (and Raj Kapoor’s Aag on others)\n\n1948 Mela No. 4\n\n1948 Nadiya Ke Paar No. 6\n\n1948 Anokha Pyar\n\n1948 Ghar Ki Izzat\n\n1949 was another year in which Dilip Kumar and Raj Kapoor shared the no.1 slot: this time in the same film.\n\n1949 Andaz No.1\n\n1949 Shabnam No.5\n\n1950- 54\n\n1950 Three films in the Top 9.\n\n1950 Babul No. 2 or 4.\n\n1950 Jogan No. 4 or 5.\n\n1950 Arzoo No.9\n\n1951\n\n1951 Deedar No. 4\n\n1951 Tarana No.7\n\n1951 Hulchul\n\n1952\n\n1952 Aan No.1 There is a debate about the year in which Aan was released. 1952 is the most likely year.\n\n1952 Daag No.4 <> Filmfare’s ‘Main Award’ of 1954 Best Actor Daag (for the year 1952) {If Dilip Kumar did not win major awards before 1952 it was because Filmfare awards were instituted in only in 1954 and there were no major awards before that.)\n\n1952 Sangdil no.5\n\n1953\n\n1953 Foot Path No.5\n\n1953 Shikast No.7\n\n1954\n\n1954 Amar No.9\n\n1955-59\n\n1955\n\n1955 Azaad No.2 <> 1956 Filmfare Award Best Actor Azaad (1955)\n\n1955 Devdas No.4, but one of the most influential Hindi-Urdu films of all times. Till at least the 1980s every time Devdas was re-released it would do reasonably well at the box office, a distinction that only one other film, by a coincidence also starring Dilip Kumar, can claim: Mughal e Azam. <> 1957 Filmfare Award Best Actor Devdas (1955)\n\n1955 Insaniyat No.6\n\n1955 Uran Khatola No.10\n\n1956 No Dilip Kumar release\n\n1957\n\n1957 Naya Daur No.2 (behind only the unbeatable colossus, Mother India) <> 1958 Filmfare Award Best Actor Naya Daur (1957)\n\n1957 Musafir No.10\n\n1958\n\n1958 Madhumati No.1 <> 1959 Nominated Filmfare Award Best Actor Madhumati (1958)\n\n1958 Yahudi No.3\n\n1959\n\n1959 Paigham No.2\n\n1960-69\n\n1960\n\n1960 Mughal-e-Azam No.1: adjusted for population and inflation, by some calculations, the biggest hit in the history of Hindi-Urdu cinema\n\n1960 Kohinoor No.3 <> 1961 Filmfare Award Best Actor Kohinoor (1960)\n\n1961\n\n1961 Gunga Jumna No.1 <> 1962 Nominated Filmfare Award Best Actor Gunga Jumna (1961)\n\n1962 and 1963 No Dilip Kumar releases. With hindsight, his bad period had begun.\n\n1964\n\n1964 Leader No. 11 or 15. The first major flop of Dilip Kumar’s career <> 1965 Filmfare Award Best Actor Leader (1964)\n\n1965 No Dilip Kumar release\n\n1966\n\n1966 Dil Diya Dard Liya No. 13. Dilip Kumar’s second major flop <> 1967 Nominated Filmfare Award Best Actor Dil Diya Dard Liya (1966)\n\n1967 Dilip Kumar had not had a hit in six years. 1967 gave him a brief respite.\n\n1967 Ram aur Shyam No.2 or 4 <> 1968 Filmfare Award Best Actor Ram Aur Shyam (1967)\n\n1968\n\n1968 Aadmi No.7 At the time it was seen as a flop. However, ultimately, the film did average business.\n\n1968 Sunghursh No. 12 or 18. A highly regarded film that did badly at the box office.\n\n1968 Sadhu aur Shaitaan No.13 or 21. Cameo.\n\n1970-74\n\n1969-71 There were no Dilip Kumar releases.\n\n1972 Dilip Kumar fans got to see their idol in a lead role again—two in fact.\n\n1972 Dastaan No.20. Despite Dilip Kumar’s double role this remake of Afsana did not do well.\n\n1972 Anokha Milan (Guest appearance) Not in the Top 22.\n\n1972 Koshish Cameo. Not in the Top 22.\n\n1973 Gopi No.12. Not a hit. However, given Dilip Kumar’s lately lowered box office standing, it had decent earnings.\n\n1974 Dilip Kumar was back in the romantic lead (opposite his real life wife, the beautiful Saira Banu, 22 years his junior) in Sagina.\n\n1974 Sagina No.18. It was a sincere film about the working class but the Hindi-Urdu version did not do well at the box office.\n\n1974 Naya Din Nai Raat Voice only. Not in the Top 23.\n\n1974 Phir Kab Milogi Cameo. Not in the Top 23.\n\n1975-84\n\n1975 No Dilip Kumar film was released.\n\n1976 At age 54 Dilip Kumar played his last role in the romantic lead.\n\n1976 Bairaag No.16. It was a triple role and his leading ladies included not only Saira Banu but also the twenty-something Leena Chandravarkar. The film did average business.\n\n1977-1980 No Dilip Kumar film was released.\n\n1981 Manoj Kumar, north India’s best-known actor director of patriotic films had never made a secret of his adulation of his childhood hero, the patriotic Dilip Kumar of Shaheed. It was he who gave the 59-year-old Dilip Kumar his second coming and top billing in the 70mm period opus Kranti. It was a mature role but was one of the causes of the film’s success.\n\n1981 Kranti No. 1 or 2 film of the year (rivalled only by Naseeb).\n\n1982 There was a huge demand among Hindi-Urdu audiences for a histrionic clash between the reigning no.1 Amitabh Bachchan and the greatest living actor of commercial Hindi-Urdu cinema. Shakti, in which they played son and father, did well but was not the superhit that it was expected to be, because the script was not the world’s best.\n\nVidhaata, on the other hand, gave Dilip Kumar the kind of role his fans wanted to see him in. he was the head of a middle-order starcast, had the title role and drove the film to the top of the charts.\n\n1982 Vidhaata No.1 or no.4.\n\n1982 Shakti No.3 or 8. <> 1983 Filmfare Award Best Actor Shakti (1982)\n\n1983 Though Dilip Kumar played a mature role in Mazdoor, he was the focus of the film, which did not do well.\n\n1983 Mazdoor No. 23.\n\n1984 saw Dilip Kumar in two author-backed roles, both written by Javed Akhtar. Mashaal was the strongest script that Javed had written after his split with Salim. It has acquired a cult status and its Ai bhai scene is affectionately parodied even in the second decade of the 21st century. Once again Dilip Kumar played not someone’s father but an idealist who is driven to crime.\n\nWhile Duniya did below average business, Mashaal was a washout at the box office.\n\n1984 Duniya No.17.\n\n1984 Mashaal No.30\n\n1985-98\n\n1985 No Dilip Kumar release.\n\n1986 Dilip Kumar was back at the top with Karma, a 70mm opus with a tailor-made role as a brave and incorruptible police officer. Dharm Adhikari had him in the title role of an honest justice of the law. However, the film was a non-starter at the box office.\n\n1986 Karma No. 1 or 2 (tying with the formidable Aakhree Raasta)\n\n1986 Dharm Adhikari Not in the Top 42.\n\n1987-88 No Dilip Kumar film was released.\n\n1989\n\n1989 Kanoon Apna Apna No.21. Below average.\n\n1990\n\n1990 Izzatdaar No.18. Below average.\n\n1990 Aag Ka Dariya Not in the Top 50. A non-starter.\n\n1991 Once again Dilip Kumar was back in the top rungs in an author-backed role in a film in which the young romantic couple was a mere decoration and the focus was on Dilip Kumar and veteran Raaj Kumar. Saudagar was Dilip Kumar’s last hit.\n\n1991 Saudagar No.3\n\n1992-97 Despite Saudagar’s success Dilip Kumar did not star in another film for the next six years.\n\n1998 saw the swansong of one of the greatest actors and superstars of Hindi-Urdu cinema\n\n1998 Qila was a washout. It was not in the Top 50.\n\nFilmography: As a writer\n\n1961 Gunga Jumna\n\n1964 Leader\n\nAs a producer\n\n1961 Gunga Jumna <> 1962 Filmfare award for Best Film Gunga Jumna (1961)\n\nDK's career in brief\n\nDK’s body of work\n\nDilip Kumar movies have gone on to become great classics of Indian Cinema. In his early films, Dilip Kumar mirrored the frustration of youth in upholding life’s values and ideals. For him, it was not the case of “Everything is fair in love and war.” For him, being noble was more important than winning love by aggression or deception or crossing the limits of civility. His romantic losses and longings endeared him greatly to his generation and the next, which did not want any shades of grey in the roles he played as in Amar (1954) and Qila (1998). His swashbuckling roles in Aan and Azaad sent the message of fighting evil with will and determination, taking pains in strides. When he came on the screen hearts missed their beat and the entire audience-filled hall lighted up at the very sight of him.\n\nThere is something enthralling about him, his mutterings, his pauses, meaningful shifting of eyes, furrowed forehead, gesturing hands, short chuckles, smiling lips, inspiring speeches, tragic monologues, Heathcliffian determination, rustic innocence, romantic disposition, and the face that expresses tragedy of the mind and happiness of the heart.\n\n1942-47\n\nDilip Kumar began his film career with the film Jwâr Bhâtâ (\"Tides\"); however, the film was not successful. His first hit was Jugnu (\"Fireflies\"). The film was released in 1947 and placed Dilip Kumar in the category of Filmistan’s successful film-stars.\n\nIn 1942, Yusuf Khan (Dilip Kumar) was in jail overnight. He refused to have his breakfast of eggs, toast and tea, which was offered to him the next morning because that day Mahatma Gandhi was on fast. The nation was busy with the Quit India Movement of 1942, for driving out the British Raj. During the next two years life was to take unexpected turn for Yusuf Khan when Devika Rani, the lady boss of Bombay Talkies, offered him a contract to act in her films.\n\nAfter initial hiccups Yusuf Khan accepted the offer and thus landed a role in Jwar Bhata (1944) under the name that the First Lady of the Indian Screen selected for him – Dilip Kumar - the name that was to cast a spell on generations of filmgoers for the next six decades. Thus he made his debut as an actor opposite Mridula and Shamim under the direction of Amiya Chakarborty. Dilip Kumar did two more films, Pratima (1945) and Milan (1946) after Jwar Bhata.\n\n1947-53\n\nJugnu (1947), Ghar Ki Izzat, Mela, Shaheed, Anokha Pyaar and Nadiya Ke Paar (all 1948); Shabnam and Andaz (1949); Jogan, Babul and Arzoo (all 1950); Hulchal, Tarana and Deedar in 1951; Aan, Sangdil, and Daag (1952).\n\nIn 1949, Dilip Kumar and Raj Kapoor, the other rising star of the era, worked together with for the first time in the film Andâz . The film was a hit. Serious roles in films such as Deedâr (1951) and Devdas (1955) earned him the title King of Tragedy.\n\nDaag which was inspired by the 1950 Marathi movie, Mee Daaru Sodli, won for Dilip Kumar his first Filmfare Award for his stellar performance of an alcoholic who having set out to purchase medicines for his dying mother, instead succumbs to his temptation and buys liquor for himself, and who finally manages to give up his drinking habits for good. In 1953, Dilip Kumar featured in Shikast and his favourite Foot-Path “where stark reality was mingled with thought-provoking romanticism.”\n\n1954-59\n\nAround 1954, Bimal Roy was busy shooting with Dilip Kumar his prestigious Devdas which was based on the Bengali novel of Sharatchandra Chattopadhyay.\n\nIn 1954, Mehboob Khan released his Amar, starring Dilip Kumar, Madhubala and Nimmi. From 1955 till 1959 Dilip Kumar starred in such films as Devdas and Udan Khatola, (1955); Insaniyat, and Azaad (1956); Naya Daur and Musafir (1957), Madhumati and Yahudi (both Bimal Roy’s – 1958). During these years, Dilip Kumar won the Filmfare Best Actor Awards for his roles in Devdas, Azaad and Naya Daur! He also got the nomination for the said Award in Madhumati. Dilip Kumar did Paigham (1959) along with Raj Kumar, Vyjayantimala and B. Saroja Devi. He was cited for the Filmfare Best Actor Award nomination [not confirmed].\n\n1960-69\n\nDilip Kumar, in 1960 he had two releases: Kohinoor and Mughal-e-Azam. He again won the Filmfare Best Actor Award for Kohinoor.\n\nIn the all-time blockbuster Mughal-e-Azam (1960), he played the role of the Mughal prince Jahangir.\n\nIn 1961 he wrote, produced and acted in Ganga Jamuna which was a trend-setting movie in many respect. This mile-stone of a movie elicited a very powerful performance from Dilip Kumar.\n\nSophia Loren, the two times Oscar Winner, was influenced profoundly by his acting. Astonishingly, Dilip Kumar did not win the Filmfare Award. He was of course nominated under that category.\n\nAfter a three-year hiatus, Dilip Kumar accepted the role of Leader (1964) for Sashadhar Mukherjee. He also wrote the film-story which is as relevant today as it was then. His comedy role fetched him another Filmfare Award in the Best Actor Category.\n\nHis second coming\n\nDilip Kumar played a double role in Ram aur Shyam. The film was a superhit after a lean period that saw Leader and Dil diya dard liya flop.\n\nHis movies in the second half of the Sixties are: Dil Diya Dard Liya (1966); Ram Aur Shyam (1967), Sungharsh, and Aadmi (both 1968).\n\nHe was nominated in the Best Actor Category in all the four films. In Ram Aur Shyam Dilip Kumar played the full-fledged double role for the first time and his impact in the movie was such that it won many acclaims, including the prestigious Filmfare Award for his diverse, sensitive and powerful performance. His adverse critics, who thought he was finished, were deservingly dealt a serious blow.\n\nHowever, his next few films, notably the critically acclaimed Sunghursh and Dastân did not do well either.\n\nThe 1970s\n\nIn Nineteen Seventies we have four Dilip Kumar movies: Gopi (1970), Dastaan (1972), Sagina (1974) and Bairaag (1976). All three movies, excluding Dastaan, had his better-half, Saira Banu, as his heroine, while B.R. Chopra’s Dastaan which was a remake of Afsaana (1951) had Sharmila Tagore and Bindu. In the Seventies he also had a guest appearance Phir Kab Milogi (1974) – a Mala Sinha-Biswajeet starrer.\n\nSagina Mahato (1970) was his diamond-jubilee hit Bengali film which was directed by Tapan Sinha. It created box-office records in Bengal.\n\nPortrayed as a brooding tragic hero, Dilip Kumar was actually quite athletic. In Sagina Mahato, one of his later critically acclaimed films, there is a sequence where the character feeling claustrophobic in an office takes off on a sprint alongside a speeding train. \"When I suggested the scene to Tapan da, he liked the idea very much. He looked at me and asked me in his quiet manner if I could wait for a double to be arranged for the run. He stared at me in disbelief when I told him I would do the sprint myself.\" The shot was done in one take.\n\nAnokha Milan (1972) had Dharmendra along with him.\n\nIn Bairaag, Dilip Kumar had triple roles, that of a father and his two sons. Bairaag additionally had the beautiful Leena Chandavarkar also as his heroine. This was the last movie of Dilip Kumar where he was the romantic hero. Thus from 1944 to 1976 he played the roles of a film hero for 32 long years.\n\nThe 1980s and ’90s\n\nHis third coming\n\nWhen Dilip Kumar came back to the silver screen after five years in Kranti (1980) it was his second innings but a successful one too. Stories were written for him, contemplating him in a central role. Thus we have Shakti and Vidhata (1982), Mazdoor (1983), Duniya and Mashaal (both 1984), Karma and Dharam Adhikari (Both 1986), and Kanoon Apna Apna (1989), Izzatdaar (1990)) and Saudagar (1991) and Qila (1998). In Shakti Dilip Kumar had Amitabh Bachchan, the super-star of the time, pitted against him. However Dilip Kumar came out with such a brilliant performance that it won him yet another Filmfare Award in the Best Actor category. He was also nominated for the said Award in Mashal and Saudagar.\n\nAi Bhai! Dilip Kumar's performance in Mashal was again a trend-setter and his AY BHAI....scene has been emulated in many Bollywood movies. In Yash Chopra's Mashaal (1984), there is a heart-wrenching scene in which Dilip Kumar's character is shown standing on a road desperately looking for some help to take his very ill wife (Waheeda Rehman) to a hospital. But she dies in his arms, no vehicle willing to stop on the quiet night street. Dilip Kumar says the scene was a straight replay of his father's panic when his mother had a near fatal asthma attack.\n\nIn the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s he worked in relatively few films. However, such was the respect and fan following that he continued to enjoy that most of the films that he acted in in his 60s were major hits: Krânti (1981), Vidhâtâ (1982), Karmâ (1986).\n\nDuniyâ (The world; 1984), Izzatdâr (The respectable one) (1990) and Saudâgar (Merchant) (1991) were big-budget films, if not as successful. His last film was Qilâ (\"Castle\"/ 1998).\n\n2014: His last film to be released: Aag ka dariya\n\nDilip Kumar-starrer 1990 film set to hit theatres soon\n\nANI | Dec 25, 2013\n\n'Aag Ka Dariya,' made in 1990, also starred actress Rekha. In thew film he plays a father in search of his missing daughter.\n\nThe director of the film, VS Rajender Babu, told BBC that the film did not get released initially because of a financial dispute and the original print of the film was badly damaged in the intervening years.\n\nBut in 2013 Babu found a \"perfect print\" of the film with a distributor in Singapore.\n\nThe film was to have finally been released in 2014. However, there is no reason to believe that it was ever released. It does not figure in Indpaedia’s list of the 150 most successful Hindi-Urdu films: 2014\n\nOther unreleased films\n\nFilms starring Dilip Kumar that never got exhibited include: Chanakya, Kalinga, Raasta and Shikasta.\n\nIconic roles that Kumar refused\n\nUpperStall writes:\n\nDilip Kumar refused Guru Dutt's Pyaasa (1957) feeling that the character of the poet Vijay in the film was just an extension of his role in Devdas. He also turned down 20th Century Fox's offer of The Rains Came and David Lean's offer of the role which ultimately went to Omar Sharif in Lawrence of Arabia (1962) and which made a major Hollywood star out of Omar Sharif. To quote Dilip Kumar,\n\n\"In your own bazaar you enjoy a certain status. What's the point of venturing out into fields unknown where you have no say? No contact with the subject matter.\"\n\nDilip of Arabia?\n\nAnvar Alikhan, The Times of India\n\nHow Omar Sharif owed his Hollywood career to Dilip Kumar\n\nOmar Sharif burned his way into Hol lywood with Lawrence of Arabia. But what most people don't know is that the actor who was originally supposed to play Omar Sharif 's role in the film was Dilip Kumar.\n\nDirector David Lean was an Indophile thanks, partly, to the fact that his fourth wife was Leela Welingkar, a legendary Hyderabadi beauty. Lean had recently made The Bridge on the River Kwai, which had won seven Oscars, and he was now looking to make his next great blockbuster.\n\nThe question was who to cast as Sherif Ali, a character based on various tribal chieftains who had fought alongside Lawrence. Lean did not want to use a European star; he wanted a more authentic actor. That's when he got in touch with Dilip Kumar, whose work he knew because of his personal experience of India.\n\nA meeting was arranged with Dilip Kumar, where the charming and persuasive Lean pitched the role to him. But Dilip Kumar turned him down, and the role went to Omar Sharif who had originally been cast to play Tafas, Lawrence's desert guide who, ironically, is shot dead by Sherif Ali in his iconic introductory sequence. Thus, what was intended as Omar Sharif 's end in the film, turned out, instead, to be the beginning of a famous Hollywood career.\n\nBut the big mystery, of course, is: why did Dilip Kumar turn down a part that any actor would kill for? It seems an inexplicable career decision, especially given the fact that David Lean was at his prime as a director, having won seven Oscars with his last film.\n\nStrangely, Dilip Kumar's autobiography, The Shadow and the Substance, doesn't shed much light on the matter, so one can only speculate. Was it was because he was then busy with his ambitious Ganga Jamuna project? Or be cause he believed his loyalty was to his Indian audiences? Or simply because he found David Lean too domineering a personality and was worried that the chemistry wouldn't work? All that Dilip Kumar has said on the subject is that he thought Omar Sharif had played the role far better than he himself could have.\n\nWhatever the reason, it may well rank as one of the worst career moves in cinema history.Dilip Kumar lost the opportunity to take his talent onto a whole new, international level, right at the prime of his career. A big loss, especially for an actor noted for his ability to take risks, to learn, and evolve with every new role.\n\nOne cannot help wonder: What if Dilip Kumar had, indeed, played the part? He was, unquestionably, a better actor than Omar Sharif (although, he might not have quite had Sharif 's homme fatale quality). He would have done a great job of Sherif Ali's role, quite likely even better than Omar Sharif did. He might have thus become one of Lean's pool of chosen talent, like Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins and Omar Sharif himself, whom the great director called upon to act in his subsequent productions.And then who knows what might have happened? Maybe, for one thing, Lean might have decided to make his critically acclaimed A Passage to India a couple of decades earlier, with Dilip Kumar playing a brilliant Dr Aziz.\n\nBut, that apart, Lawrence of Arabia would have opened other Hollywood doors for Dilip Kumar.And those experiences would have, in turn, helped enrich his future Hindi movie roles. He would have thus surely avoided the bad patch he went through in the 1970s, starting with Gopi and Sagina Mahato, which wiped out ten of the best years of his life.But one thing is for sure: Dilip Kumar would not, unlike Omar Sharif, have left Indian cinema and moved to Hollywood; he was too rooted, and modest, a person for that.\n\nWhile Dilip Kumar did not act in Lawrence of Arabia, there was another Indian actor who did. And that was I S Johar, who played the minor role of Gasim, a Bedouin tribesman who Lawrence finally executes. The role got I S Johar his hour of glory back home in India, and [for] many Indians his two minutes on screen [were an added attraction of the film].\n\nQuality, not quantity\n\nIn spite of being the highest paid and most successful star of the 1950s and early ’60s, Dilip Kumar acted in just 54 films. This indicated that he wanted to give only high quality performances.\n\nIn the 1950s and ’60s, Filmistan was ruled by a trinity of matinee idols: Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor (the most successful director of his time, though his acting was questionable) and Dev Anand.\n\nAwards and recognition\n\nIn 1993, Dilip Kumar was given the Filmfare Award for Lifetime Achievement. The Government of India awarded him the Dadasaheb Phalke Award which is given for a lifetime of cinematic excellence in India. In 1997 the Pakistan Government awarded him the Nishan-e-Imtiaz which left him traumatized [because he was widely criticised for receiving a Pakistani award] though this highest civilian award of Pakistan was also awarded to Morarji Desai much earlier.\n\nThe NTR National Award was given to him in 1997. He was also awarded the Phalke Ratna Award in 2007 and the CNN-IBN Indian of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award in 2009, along with hosts of many other awards.\n\nIn 2015 Dilip Kumar was awarded the nation's second highest honour, the Padma Vibhushan. The Home Minister of India, Mr Rajnath Singh, flew from Delhi to Mumbai to confer the award, since Mr Kumar's health did not permit his flying to Delhi to receive the award. Earlier, in 1991 he had been given the nation’s third highest honour the Padma Bhushan.\n\nIn 1994 he was given the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, the highest national award for cinema.\n\nIn 1980 Dilip Kumar was made the Sheriff of Mumbai, a title in recognition of his eminence.\n\nTragedy King Dilip Kumar has also been a member of the Rajya Sabha.\n\nIn 1997, the Government of Pakistan awarded him the (Nishan-e-Imtiaz), Pakistan's highest civilian honor.\n\nAccording to the Guinness Book of Records Dilip Kumar is the most award-winning actor. Filmfare Best Actor Award: A total of eight times during his lifetime. This record has not yet broken, and this could be a record, Jagran Junction wrote in 2011.\n\nIn 1953-54 when major awards (Filmfare) were first instituted , the film 'Daag' was awarded the prize for Best Actor. In addition Azad (1955), Devdas (1956), Naya Daur (1957), Kohinoor (1960), Leader (1964), and Ram aur Shyam (1967) and Shakti (1982) got him Filmfare Awards for Best Actor.\n\nIn 1993, the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award was awarded.\n\nFilmfare Awards\n\n1954 ‘Main Award’ Best Actor Daag (1952)\n\n1956 Filmfare Award Best Actor Azaad (1955)\n\n1957 Filmfare Award Best Actor Devdas (1955)\n\n1958 Filmfare Award Best Actor Naya Daur (1957)\n\n1959 Nominated Filmfare Award Best Actor Madhumati (1958)\n\n1961 Filmfare Award Best Actor Kohinoor (1960)\n\n1962 Best Film Gunga Jumna (1961)\n\n1962 Nominated Filmfare Award Best Actor Gunga Jumna (1961)\n\n1965 Filmfare Award Best Actor Leader (1964)\n\n1967 Nominated Filmfare Award Best Actor Dil Diya Dard Liya (1966)\n\n1968 Filmfare Award Best Actor Ram Aur Shyam (1967)\n\n1983 Filmfare Award Best Actor Shakti (1982)\n\nSee also\n\nDilip Kumar: a biography\n\nDilip Kumar: his films, their box office performance, awards, career\n\nMadhubala, actress\n\nMadhubala and Dilip Kumar\n\nAsha Parekh\n\nMughal-e-Azam"
