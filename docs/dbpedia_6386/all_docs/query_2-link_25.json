        "text": "Bandhs in Bengal provoke derisive laughter in the rest of the country. It is a tool which has been flogged to flippancy by our political animals and devoured with lazy hunger by a state which has continuously slipped steadily in its work culture.\n\nIt is a sad thing actually; almost like the hunger strike which Gandhiji used to maximum effect and Rakhi Sawant now chooses as a publicity option when she calls from, of all places, a restaurant to tell an FM radio jockey that she would like to announce a fast because the Hyderabad cops had refused her permission to stage a show on grounds of obscenity.\n\nSignificantly, this month happens to mark the centenary of the hunger strike in the world though we do have citations in the Ramayana that Bharata threatened a hungerstrike if Lord Rama did not return to Ayodhya with him.\n\nFor those interested in history, it was a Scottish suffragate, Marion Dunlop, who refused to eat in jail after which scores of other women activists followed her, forcing the jail doctors to forcefeed them. That was on July 9, 1909. I do not remember when, and at which appointed historic hour, Ms Sawant chose to make that call to the FM radio jockey. Her swayamvar or dumb charade on television interests me more.\n\nBack to bandhs though. I remember the seriousness of bandhs when we were kids. When all of you outside Bengal think that bandhs are just our way of getting that extra day off, I would like to point out that the hartal, as it was then called, was sparingly used before the seventies and when they were actually announced, the state shook with nervousness and not with the delight of a summer fling.\n\nThe hartal activists were summarily arrested hours before bandh day, government workers were publicly told that they just had to make it to office or else face grievous penalty and bus and tram drivers took dips in the Ganges and sought blessings from elders before boarding the government vehicles.\n\nBandhs in those days were not called on the spot, so to say, as they are now, and the run-up to a hartal could be made out everywhere; the teashops, the bazaars, the theatres, actually, wherever there were people with a right to vote. Hartals were serious business carried out by serious people.\n\nOf course, cricket and football continued to be played on the empty roads but they were competitive games between localities and announced days in advance; you never got too many chances of playing on car-less roads because hartals did not happen every second day.\n\nI remember trophies being handed out for para matches and sometimes, three or four teams slugged it out to win a round-robin throughout the day even as comrades burnt buses and trams at the far end of the other neighbourhood.\n\nThat was Calcutta, a city of unbelievable contrasts and a culture which somehow managed to rejoice in whatever was left of life in the violence-ridden dark days of the 60s and 70s. But one thing remained paramount. A bandh meant serious business and not just a grudge game. And invariably, after a successful bandh, there were political parleys and decisions were arrived at.\n\nNot like our times now when a bandh comes and goes with file pictures being used optimally by discerning news editors. How can you manufacture new pictures for the same occasion every other month?\n\nThey are like astrological columns in newspapers. I remember writing one for my magazine editor years back when the astrologer had failed to deliver his handwritten piece on time. It was not difficult, let me assure you. You just had to take the first line of each sun sign of the previous week and then add them up to make a readable whole with pluses and minuses in place.\n\nBandh pictures are difficult stuff for newspaper desks though. Only the hair of the constable sleeping on his job may have grown over the previous week. Apart from that, everything, including the empty Howrah Bridge which must have been the first photographer's first major assignment on the day of the very first bandh in Bengal, remains constant. So you have to be very, indeed very, inventive.\n\nBut Friday's bandh was somehow slightly different. I went out on the streets and tried to find out why there was this uncanny silence all around. Which is usually not the case because during an Opposition-sponsored bandh in Bengal almost everything plies as usual with the slight difference of a few buses being stoned or cars stopped. But that is routine and taken as part of the game.\n\nBut here, we had a only a 12-hour-bandh and the silence was almost phantom-like in its presence. It was everywhere but could not be felt. There were no gully football matches, the nukkads were not milling with no-gooders doing small talk, shops were closed as if they wouldn't reopen ever, and government buses and trams were nowhere to be seen. The CPI(M) government had taken the hint. It was not taking any chances. For the first time in many, many years, the government had surrendered. Yes, capitulated.\n\nAnd strangely, though there was lumpen violence the previous day, nothing happened during the 12 hours on Friday. The city was peaceful. The silence of the lambs spoke of impending slaughter, I felt.\n\nBut slaughter of whom? And by whom? That is the big question. Because there is no sacrifice here. The CPI(M) has got its just desserts and is now facing the music. The Opposition, as if manna from heaven, has found a cause to beat the government with on every front. And the people, who usually lead any slaughter in the absence of an annointed priest, are now silent.\n\nFriday's bandh should be an eye-opener. Change may not always be welcome but if it has to come, then the signals were clear on Friday. I have no clue as to who will usher in the change or whether the leaders of that change are competent to govern us. But I am clear about one thing.\n\nBengal is set for change. And we are waiting with silence. Because before any slaughter, it is always sympathy and silent prayers for the lamb which are uttered before the mob rises in orgasmic violent cries when the chopper falls with a deft swish."
