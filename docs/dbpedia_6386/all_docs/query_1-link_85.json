        "text": "India is a federative republic (a union of states). The acting constitution went into effect Jan. 26, 1950. The head of state is the president, who is elected for a term of five years by an electoral college consisting of all the elected members of parliament and of the legislatures of the states. The president is given broad powers. He appoints the prime minister and, upon the recommendation of the latter, other members of the government and the supreme court. The president has the right to dissolve the House of the People (the lower house of parliament), to issue emergency decrees between sessions of parliament, and to declare states of emergency. He is also the Supreme Commander in Chief of the armed forces.\n\nThe highest organ of legislative authority is the parliament, consisting of the president and two chambers—the House of the People and the Council of States. The House of the People (1972) has 521 deputies, 518 of whom were elected for terms of five years through direct and universal suffrage by secret ballot based on a relative majority system; three deputies are appointed by the president. The Council of States has 240 members, 228 of whom are elected by the elected members of the state legislatures on the basis of proportional representation; 12 members are appointed by the president. Each member of the Council of States serves for six years. Every two years there are elections for one-third of the council’s seats. The right to vote belongs to all citizens who have reached the age of 21.\n\nThe government of India—that is, the Council of Ministers—is formed by the parliamentary faction of the party that wins in the elections to the House of the People.\n\nAlthough according to the constitution of India (art. 74) the government is purely a deliberative body, in fact the prime minister and the government have considerable authority.\n\nIn the states the chief of executive power is the governor, appointed by the president to a term of five years. The greater part of the governor’s authority is carried out in practice by the Council of Ministers, which consists of a chief minister and subordinate ministers. Each state has a legislature consisting of a governor and one or two chambers elected by the population to terms of five years.\n\nUnion territories are governed directly by the president or by chief commissars who are subordinate to the president.\n\nOfficials (commissars or collectors) are designated as chief authorities in districts, as are village elders in villages. There are also elected bodies (panchayats) in the villages that control public property, forests, and field areas and are responsible for sanitation, water supply, and so forth. District councils consisting of not less than six members are elected to three-year terms in districts. In cities municipal councils are elected.\n\nThe judicial system includes a supreme court, which is also an organ of constitutional supervision, state higher courts, and a number of lower-level district courts.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nKrishnan, M.

The president is commander in chief, and immediate direction of the armed forces is implemented through the minister of defense. The army, air force, and navy are manned through recruitment of volunteers. There is no military draft. Officers are trained in military schools as well as in the national cadet corps. Some of the officers of special forces receive training abroad. There are four military districts: western, central, eastern, and southern. The strength of the armed forces stood at about 980,000 men in 1971. In addition, there are territorial forces, security forces, and the Jammu-Kashmir militia (totaling more than 100,000 men). The army (approximately 860,000 men) consists of 23 infantry and mountain-infantry divisions, one armored division, ten separate brigades, and separate units and subdivisions of special forces (signal, engineer, and so forth).\n\nThe air force (about 80,000 men) consists of air force command headquarters, which include aviation wings. There are approximately 625 combat aircraft. The navy (about 40,000 men) is divided into western and eastern commands. The navy includes one aircraft carrier, two cruisers, three destroyers, 14 patrol vessels, four submarines, and auxiliary vessels. The naval air force has more than 60 planes and helicopters. The major naval bases are Calcutta, Cochin, and Madras. Armaments and combat equipment are mainly of foreign manufacture; certain types of artillery, small arms, and ammunition are produced by India’s own military industry.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nShcherbatskii, F.

Bombay [1959].\n\nPopular theatrical presentations originated in early antiquity in the form of diverse tribal ceremonies, games, and dances. Many forms of popular theater have lasted to the present (perhaps almost unaltered).\n\nStage performances of the ancient epic poems Ramayana and Mahabharata are a basic element of most popular theatrical presentations. Indian plays, in which many thematic peripetia are not only acted out but narrated as well, do not require special stage areas, scenery, or a large number of props. The major attention is focused on the performer. His repertoire consists of declamation, dance, pantomime, singing, and frequently the talents of a circus professional. Numerous styles and local varieties of dance that developed into classical schools of national choreography are some of the most powerful and expressive resources of traditional theater (bharata natya, kathakali, kathak, and manipuri). The choreography of the majority of theatrical presentations in the south of India is based on bharata natya (one of the oldest forms, structured on a literary theme associated with the cult of the god Siva) and kathakali. In the north of India, leading forms are kathak and manipuri. Despite differences in the specifics of structure, internal organization, and style, each of the classical schools, as well as Indian choreography as a whole, is characterized by combined forms of dance and song, sophisticated pantomime, and skilled dramatics. Many forms and variations maintain their synthetic nature, which remains unchanged.\n\nThe most celebrated forms of popular presentations in the north of India are the Ram Lila and the Krishna Lila, which are performed on national and religious holidays for periods of 14 days (and sometimes more than a month). They are staged by amateurs in urban or village areas. The performance, as a rule, is directed by an individual who is experienced and professionally trained. Themes of the Ram Lila and Krishna Lila are based on episodes from the lives of the epic heroes Rama and Krishna. Interludes using everyday themes (somas) not directly linked with the subject of the play are performed between scenes.\n\nThe jatra presentation is well known in the western areas of Bengal and in Orissa. The performance begins with an address to the audience by the main singer (bibek), who then comments on the stage action. A choir and a small orchestra accompany the performance. The yaksagana, a theatrical presentation of South India, involves a highly developed system of gestures and strictly prescribed makeup and costumes for each performer.\n\nPopular theater is presented in other regions of India: for example, the tamasha in Maharashtra, the jashei in Kashmir, and the swang in Rajasthan.\n\nPopular theatrical forms have had a profound effect on classical Indian theater, which developed in India between the fifth and first centuries B.C. Questions of dramatic composition, the art of acting, and the architecture of theater buildings are treated in detail in the ancient Indian work Natyasastra. Aesthetics of classical theater are based on teachings about emotion (bhava ) and its stage representation (rasa). The rules of acting are strictly canonized; a criterion of theatrical mastery is perfect execution of these rules. The content of classical drama is associated with a rich treasure trove of popular mythology.\n\nLeading dramatis personae are gods, saints, sages, rulers, and court officials. Ancient treatises on theater art prohibit the stage representation of social conflicts and tragic situations, such as popular revolts, the siege of a city, the overthrow of a ruler, or the death of a hero.\n\nThe flourishing of classical Indian drama and theater is associated with the creative work of Bhasa, Kalidasa, and Sudraka between the fourth and sixth centuries. Proceeding from traditional structures, plays by India’s greatest dramatists showed the life of ancient India in all its diversity.\n\nA profound social crisis coupled with a seizure of power by Muslim dynasties, which essentially prohibited theater on religious grounds, resulted in the decline of classical drama. During the 12th and 13th centuries it completely disappeared. However, Indian theater art and its original national traditions continued to develop in the form of popular creative works.\n\nDuring the second half of the 19th century the stormy growth of the national liberation movement and national consciousness brought to life a theater of the European type—dramatic composition in the new Indian languages of Bengali, Hindi, Marathi, and others. One of the first troupes was a group of Bengali actors, established in 1795 in Calcutta by the Russian scholar G. S. Lebedev. In 1872 the Bengali playwright G. Ghosh founded the National Theater, which had a significant effect on broad circles of Indian society. Social drama was developed in Hindi, Marathi, and other languages. Appeals to struggle for liberation from colonial oppression, sharp criticism of systems established in the country by the British colonial administration, and a tremendous public response to the activities of the Ghosh theater impelled the British in 1876 to issue a law on dramatic presentations, which introduced rigid police censorship.\n\nIn the 1940’s, Indian theater life became considerably more active. Professional and amateur theatrical groups emerged to call for a liberation struggle against colonial oppression. The Association of Popular Theaters (founded in 1943) united many progressive Indian theater groups and organizations. In the early 1950’s the Little Ballet, the troupe of the dancer and choreographer U. Shankar (organized in 1952 by S. Bardhan), gained fame, as did other troupes.\n\nAfter independence was won, national culture, including theater art, was reborn. The founding of the Academy of Dance, Drama, and Music in 1953 was of great importance. The academy has seven branches, as well as organizations in all of the states. The best-known theaters are found in Calcutta— Bahurupi, Minerva, Star, Rangmahal, and the Theatrical Center. Permanent theaters also operate in Delhi, Allahabad, Madras, Bombay, Varanasi, and Poona. In the 1960’s there were more than 30 professional theater companies. The first state theater school was founded in Delhi in 1959 as part of the Academy of Dance, Drama, and Music. The Indian Art Center (opened in 1958) is also part of the academy.\n\nTheater life of the early 1970’s has been characterized by an attempt to synthesize traditional national theater with forms and methods of Western European drama, as well as by the creation of new professional troupes. In 1971 in Bombay alone, 22 professional groups were performing. Some of the most popular newly formed troupes are the New Theater (Delhi), Tarun Opera (Calcutta), and Dramatic Wint (Bombay). The repertoire of the Tarun Opera includes the play Lenin-jatra, based on J. Reed’s book Ten Days That Shook the World.\n\nPuppet theater is one of the oldest forms of drama. In present-day India greatest popularity is enjoyed by marionette theater in Rajasthan and Orissa; shadow theater in Andhra, Kerala, and Orissa; and hand puppet theater in Orissa and Uttar Pradesh."
