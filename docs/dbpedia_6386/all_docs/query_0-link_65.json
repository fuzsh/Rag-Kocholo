The author of this paper has dealt with only two Ls: Language and Labour taking his cues from Raghunatha Siromoni and Karl Marx. My-dentity as a category does not depend on the exchange value as ascribed by the market economy, therefore the author has paraphrased “fit for use” (viniyogayogyata) as “use value” and it eradicates the self-other differences in the context of my-ness. The author is not talking about I-dentity or I-ness, but on my-dentity or my-ness, i.e., what “I” possesses or what belongs to “me”—my ownership, endowment, possessed-ness or rather entitlement . Thus this paper is a psychoanalytic shift from the individual ego to the possession of ego as imagined and symbolized. This paper starts with some problematic questions: Do “I” possesses something or something is imposed upon my I-dentity or as my “own” following certain rules of socio-cultural or politico-economic legitimacy? As a homo sapiens, except my supposed genetic endowment, do I have something as my “own”? Do I have my ownership of four Ls in the context or locus of this planet or universe? Then what is about the legal and market entitlement as proposed by Amartya Sen? Without questioning the stipulated value ascribed to a currency note, Sen puts “etc.” at the beginning of the exchange process .This is the paradox of his framework as it leads to fallacy of infinite regress. The author elaborates his arguments by following age old dialogic forms. He concludes his paper by following Derrida and by introducing the concepts of Anti-Grammar, n-glossia, Bhasa-samavaya.\n\n(S)talker had anticipated the incidence of the secret moments of eco-enemy primitive accumulation and thus he acted with his theoretical tools before Singur-Nandigram incidence. He started with these two quotations from Karl Marx:\n\n“From the standpoint of higher economic form of society, private ownership of the globe by single individuals will appear quite absurd as private ownership of one man by another. Even a whole society, a nation, or simultaneously existing societies taken together, are not the owners of the globe, its usufractuaries, and like bona partes familias, they must hand it down to succeeding generations in an improved condition.”–Karl Marx, 1894/1959: 776\n\n“The person, who by virtue of the title of portion of the globe has become the proprietor of these natural objects will wrest these surplus-profit from functioning capital in the form of rent.” –Karl Marx, 1894/1959: 773\n\nThen he switched over to the concept of svatva (possessedness) as proposed by Kana Raghunatha. He argued in his padarthatatvanirupanam—\n\n“ Another new category is possessedness (svatva).\n\nObjection: That is nothing but being fit for use as one wishes.\n\nAnswer: Not precisely, for one may use food belonging to others.\n\nObjector: One is not enjoined not to eat food belonging to others.\n\nRaghunatha: You see, you must already understand possessedness in order understand such an injunction. Possessedness is a property that belongs to people when they receive gifts and that they lose when they give things away.”\n\nTo summarize, svatva as a category does not depend on the exchange value as ascribed by the market economy, therefore (s)talker was paraphrasing “fit for use” (viniyogayogyata) as “use value” and it eradicates the self-other differences in the context of my-ness.\n\nHe was then not talking about I-dentity or I-ness, but on my-dentity or my-ness, i.e., what “I” possesses or what are (being) belonged to me—my ownership, endowment, possessed-ness or rather entitlement or in other word, private property. Following navyanaiyayika term, one may call this category as svatva. Thus this project was a psychoanalytic shift from the individual ego to the possession of ego as imagined and symbolized within certain domain of order.\n\nThis project starts with some problematic questions:\n\nDoes “I” possess something or something is imposed upon my I-dentity or as my “own” by following certain rules of socio-cultural or politico-economic legitimacy?\n\nAs a homo sapiens, except my supposed genetic endowment, do I have something as my “own”? Do I have my ownership of four Ls: Land, Language, labour and Love in the context or locus of this planet or universe ?\n\nThen what is about legal entitlement as proposed by Amartya Sen (1981: 1-2)? An entitlement relation applied to ownership connects one set of ownerships to another through certain rules of legitimacy. It is a recursive relation and process of connecting is repeated.”\n\nAmartya Sen then cited an example of private ownership from the market economy and elaborated an exchange of commodity by using money-sign, which is mere a signifier that metaphysically makes unequal as equal and I really do not know the sufficient and necessary conditions behind such equation of exchange. Without questioning the stipulated value ascribed to a currency note, Sen put “etc.” at the beginning of the exchange process. The origin of entitlement starts with “etc.”, i.e. “ityadi” (iti+adi, iti means the “end of a process or state or an event”, on the other hand adi means the “origin”) is put at the “adi” or origin. This is the paradox of his framework as it leads to fallacy of infinite regress.\n\nNEOLOGISMS: my-dentity or my-ness, Anti-Grammar, n-glossia, Bhasa-samavaya\n\nFor detailed discussion, kindly follow hyperlinks (blue-colored titles):\n\n“Language: From I- Dentity to My-Dentity”.

The author emphasized on the following points:\n\na) Tagore thought that he was a parasite as he was not capable of doing necessary labor and he was depending on surplus labor of the other.\n\nb) According to Tagore, city is also a parasite as it is sucking the blood of the villages.\n\nc) Tagore reinterpreted the concept of necessary labor by introducing a new category: voluntary labor with pleasure/toiling with full of joissance and of course without alienation.\n\nd) He condemned the extraction of others’ labor-time/ surplus labor and critrisized usaries .\n\ne) He had given the different semantics of private property, which was not merely property in the material sense of the term, but it is a possesion of creative mind.\n\nf) Tagore interpreted money-sign as /taka-rupak/ “money-simile”, by means of which unequals have become equals by some necessary and sufficient conditions. In the “rupaka” figure of speech the identitity and difference between the object compared and comparable are blurred.\n\ng) The “body-politic” of democracy is the joy-ride of the super-rich. Here “opinions are manufactured” (1924). Tagore anticipated the concept of dollar-vote and entered into the domain of political economy.\n\nh) Tagore introduced a novel concept of surplus freedom provided by the cessation of activities (karmavirati) / leisure (udbritto ObokaS) that could be executed if and only if the voluntary labor with pleasure might be performed.\n\ni) He introduced ecology as a variable as a part of his economics. This is one of the unprecedented contributions of Tagore. He was against the extraction of wealth of earth by the violent anthropogenic intervention.\n\nj) He emphasized on the passion of greed as a part of his epistemology. It can be reinterpreted in psychoanalytic terms.\n\nk) Tagore introduced “samavaya” (Co-operative) through the activities of a society called “Sriniketan”, though the semantics of this term is totally different. The author of this paper explained the difference between the detachable (samjoga) and non-detachable (samavaya)relations. As for example, suppose that we are connected by some non-eco-friendly electronic gadgets like CPU, satellites etc. , i.e. we are connected in the web—we have some definite relations. These relations can easily be disconnected according to our whims or by some catastrophic situation. However, may you detach the quivering and leaves when you are perceiving quivering leaves? This is another type of non-detachable relation, which is de-sign-ated as “samavaya”. The small-big i and I non-detachable relationship/communication without any instruments is something different from the anti-green techno-centric communication network between you and me.\n\nIn the paper, বুনো রবি ঠাকুর ( Wild Rabindranath Tagore), the author extended the previous paper and described Tagore’s inclination towards ideal forest, hermitage, though the author pointed out some problems in Tagore’s agenda. However, the discontents of modern civilization was emphasized by referring to the problems of anthropogenic global heating. (see also: o King, Stop Killing Deer Of Our Hermitage: Environmental consciousness in Indian science and technology)\n\nOn the other hand, in the book, তর্জমার তর্জনী বা একলব্যের বুড়ো আঙ্গুল (The Governance of Translation and Ekalavya’s Thumb), the author dealt with a different issue related to translation studies. The first part of the monograph deals with the Dronacarya-Ekalavya relationship in case of translation by simply summarizing the propositions made in the paper “তর্জমার তর্জনী বা একলব্যের বুড়ো আঙ্গুল [The Ekalavya Relation: Modernist Locals’ Anti-Modernist Response(s)]”, which elaborates the association of translation enterprise with colonialism, violence and pedagogy . The second part of the monograph subscribes those propositions with an ad hoc hypothesis: Rabindranath Tagore translated Eliot’s ‘(The)Journey of the Magi’ without reading ‘Journey of the Magi.’ (see also: the PowerPoint presentation: Impossibility Of Translation: A Case Study)\n\nThis peculiar as well as surprising hypothesis is subscribed by the chronology of events occurred within the pretext of confronting derivative modernity by Tagore. The Bengali young ‘modern’ thinkers, writers poets, viz. Dhurjatiprasad Mukhopadhyay (better known as D.P. Mukherji), Sudhindranath Dutta, Buddhadev Basu, Bishnu De et al., were debating with Tagore on the norms of newly introduced concept of ‘modernity’ and particularly on Eliot’s contribution on the modern ‘international’(?) literature. This polemic is elaborated by the investigator with the citation of four different Ekalavya texts of the same poem, ‘Journey of the Magi’ to reveal the emission of surplus meanings by deploying ankanta (theory of many perspectives) method.\n\nThe paper, “বাংলার খোয়াবনামা (Bangla: A Genealogical Fantasy)”, is a Bangla translation/elaborated version of the two English papers: Language Planner Rabindranath Tagore and Colony’s Burden: a Case of Extending Bangla. The Indian census reports since 1871 were put here to show the lacunas of statistical survey techniques that helped to construct genealogical fantasy and nation statist boundary. Secondly, the tensed relationship between Laksminath BejBarua, an Asamiya writer, and Rabindranth Tagore was shown to understand the impact of extra-linguistic variables at the moment of a birth of nation in the context of colonialism. Thirdly, the role of print capitalism was depicted through the endeavor of Fakirmohan Senapati, an Odia writer, by analyzing the discourse of his biography.\n\nAll the linguistic movements in colonial India lead to the demand/desire for autonomy in different spheres and were linked with anti-imperialistic nationalist movement, though, on the contrary, all these movements had become the mirror image of dominant others’ nation statist mimic imagination. In this way, there was a demand for “autonomous” and “pure” tool indigenous grammar (free from “adulteration”) of a well-defined enumerated and “pure” language which is selected centrally as a standard language. Therefore, language-managers of a given community did two things: a) they, as a member of imagined community, defined the language boundary (i.e. selection of standard and extension of the standard language from centre to periphery) and b) managed that language with the help of a tool called grammar.\n\nThe author also tried to show the Bengali intellectuals’ (language judge/-police/-managers) perspectives (19th. C. and the first three decades of the 20th C) on the issue of autonomy of two neighboring languages, viz. Oriya and Asamiya, two neighboring languages of Bangla. The paper shows a classical centre-periphery relation, where Bengal as a centre, wanted to subsume the periphery through hegemonic selving in course of standardizing and extending the political geography of Bangla with the supposed language module. The situation shows dialectic of hegemonic inclusion, which creates internal colonization, and thus captive languages with a feeling of derivative nationalism were trying to combat external colonization as well. These cases in the colonial period and at the time of the birth of a new nation states might help us to apprehend the post-colonial withdrawal syndrome from the other defeated varieties (i.e., so called “dialects”).\n\nIn the paper, “দোস্ত আইয়ুব সাহচর্যে একটি সাহিত্যতাত্ত্বিক পরিভ্রমণ”, Anekantavada is introduced in the context of Tagore’s philosophy through the analysis of Abu S. Ayyub.\n\nFor detailed discussion, kindly follow hyperlinks (blue-colored titles):\n\n“মা-রে-গা: মার্কস, রবীন্দ্রনাথ, গান্ধী[Marx-Rabindranath-Gandhi: Ma-Re-Ga] (Article along with a review of the collection “Debating Gandhi” (Oxford, 2006), edited by A.

We forget, at the moment of speaking about it that\n\n(a) “India” is a socio-political construct that was born out of (mainly) 19 C. Industrial as well as print capitalist imagination of nation state.\n\n(b) and that imagination was also appropriated by the different modes of colonialism.\n\n(C) “Philosophy” is equated with the “darsana” as a part of political translation. Apart from their obvious similarities, there are also differences as Bankimchandra pointed out that “Philosophy” is sadhya (is to be mediated) and darsana is sadhaniya (ought to be mediated. Chattopadhyay, B. ,1879/1974:217-18)\n\n(d) What are categorized under the umbrella of homogenized “lP” is a purely “good orient”-al project that excludes “other” non-Sanskritized way of thought and methods of proving truth. This had a precedence in Sayana Madhava’s “savrvadarsansamgraha (14th. C A.D.), which was taken, at the moment of constructing “IP” as an appropriate paradigm for setting up order of things.\n\n(e) This order of things are approximated and appropriated by the western knowledge-base. Thus what is called as “IP” is also a derivative discourse.\n\n(f) “vijnana” in the Indian tradition means “consciousness” (as translated by Dasgupta, 1936:86). Nothing was classified separately as “science’ in the so-called Indian tradition, though some elements of so-called “Indian culture” obviously may be categorized as “science” from the European point of view.\n\n(g) What, as a whole, may be called and perceived as “lP of Science” today is merely a result of retrospective perceptual effect ( pratyavbhijna) , i.e. appropriating past knowledge by deploying today’s knowledge-base and techniques, which may be called “epistemological recurrence” following Bachelard.\n\n(h) Due to this recurrence and appropriation by the western epistemology, the de-sign of modem “lP” has emerged as a result of “epistemological amalgamation”.\n\nAll these problems must be seriously explained and elaborated before going to venture into the realm of “IP of Science” as all these statements should be “proved” (i.e. need pramana) according to the need of “global”(?) Philosophy of science.\n\nFor detailed discussion, kindly follow hyperlinks (blue-colored titles)\n\nMAIN PAPERS:\n\n“The Making of the Indian Philosophy of Science”. From the Margins.

Nirmal kumar Bose (1926, 1932) interpreted the outer body of this temple and Stella Kramrisch (1946) was searching the inner body. The main point of their disagreement might be posed as : Were the bodies of the Hindu temples constructed on the basis of physiological corporeal or meta- physiological conjecture of body? Bose reviewed Kramrisch’s book (1947) and alleged that Stella was too metaphysical and illiterate artisans are ignorant about the intricacies of the inner body as they did not have the access to the scriptures. However, Mira Mukherjee(1993) showed the path when she introduced so-called illiterate sons of Visvakarma. The author of this paper showed the evidences of inner corporeal of the temple-architecture by re-surveying the temple and taking cue from sub-altern artisans’ world-views as well as from Mandukyoponisad, Vakyapadiya and Tantraloka.\n\nThe so-called metaphysical body is evident in the so-called “Hindu” architecture. The bisuddha-baikhari-jagrat (falsest), anahata-madhyama (speaking when dreaming) -svapna (falser), manipura-pasyanti-susupti (falsest) association might be established with many sadhaniya margas. Kavir, Dadu, Lalon, Rabindranath (though they were not writers of papers in academic journals) and other sahajiyas with the authors of Mandukyoponisad, Vakyapadiya and Tantraloka can be consulted to attain the level of paravak. Why then was I fragmenting brittle baikhari, when I was waking up?\n\nII\n\n“কালকুটের কায়াসাধনা (Kalkut’s Corporeal Studies)”\n\nThis dialogic paper on kalkut’s (Samaresh Basu) two novels was related to Konark ‘ s sun temple . These two novels ( nirjan saikate, “lonely seashore”, 1961 revised version,1972 and Samba, “Son of Krishna, a mythical character”, 1977/78, Academy –winner novel) were two types of travelogues—first one was a physical travel from Puri Jagannath temple to Konark with five widows and the second one was a mental travel to the Sun temple. In the first one, Kalkut as a narrator highly criticized the position of Nirmal kumar Basu (Anthropologist) in describing the intricacies of the temple architecture and in the second one was on the mental journey to the distant past through retrospection, that was for the cure/care of self within the ambit of act-pleasure-desire. Not only that, indigenous leprosy-treatment or healing system within the area of the Konark-site was also elaborated, thus the relationship between human –corporeal and the nature (including celestial sphere, flora and fauna etc. ) was also depicted.\n\nThe author of this paper was concerned with the ambivalence (schizophrenic Kalkut? Samaresh Basu with divided selves?) of Samaresh Basu, the vulgar “Marxist” (cf. Godelier’s Marxist Anthropology), who was retrenched from the vulgar communist party for his allegedly “vulgar”(?) novels and short stories another one was “Kalkut”, his penname, a vagabond, who was searching the indigenous tradition through tedious journey—a type of either physical or mental/imagined vagabondage. Like Stella Kramrisch (1946), he was interested in tantra, but he tried his best to hide this fact for the sake of so-called vulgar materialism (which was a fashion in those days) as it was practiced by the corporate-controlled “official” communist party, who were using jargons, which were not used (historical/dialectical materialism etc.) by Marx himself; secondly, the secrets of such practices (sadhana) were not to be revealed to everyone. Therefore, Kankut consciously hided secrets of tantrasadhana. However, the author of this paper, by deploying discourse analysis (Foucalidian) found the cleavages within the texts of Kalkut—he repeatedly used the word “breathing”( a key-term in Tantra) and its synonyms for the care of self. The author of the paper also found a connection with Buddhist tantric cult (especially Caryapada, cf. In Search of Linguistics of Silence : Caryapada চর্যা-চর্চায় নীরবতার ভাষাতত্ত্ব সন্ধান : উপক্রমনিকা and “The Movement Within: A Secret Guide To Esoteric Kayaasadhanaa: Caryaapada”.) with the narrator’s enunciation as in the first novel five widows represented the five female characters as it was found in Caryapada-text.\n\nThe author of this paper lastly related his hypothesis of Yayati/Bubur Complexes (cf. “হে প্রণম্য পিতৃদেব, তুমি তো বন্ধু নও/হও” (Yayati and Babur Complex).)with Samba’s life as Samba was cursed by his father Krishna as Samba was caressing with aged Krishna’s young girlfriends. Thus, the author’s Yayati complex hypothesis was again subscribed by the purana as reinterpreted by Kalkut. The inner-outer structure controversy as depicted in . Architectural Description of Konark Sun-Temple “কোনারকের বিবরণ” কিতাবের সমালোচনা“ was resolved here by a poem written by Bishnu De, who was highly influenced by T.S. Eliot.\n\nIII\n\nIn Search of Linguistics of Silence : Caryapada চর্যা-চর্চায় নীরবতার ভাষাতত্ত্ব সন্ধান : উপক্রমনিকা and “The Movement Within: A Secret Guide To Esoteric Kayaasadhanaa: Caryaapada”.\n\nThe author of this paper did not bother about the (a)formal linguistic analysis (meta-speaking on speaking, i.e. formal linguistics and philology) of the text of Caryapada (approx. 9th C A.D. A Tantric Buddhist text written in a sandhyabhasa or anti-language a la Halliday); (b) retrospective (pratyabhijna) construction of genealogical fantasy or linguistic statist identity or imagiNATION, instead he was proposing a secret guide to exquisite kayasadhana (the praxis within the body within the ambit of corporal studies)by following the path of Bhartrihari and Abhinavagupta’s post-formal non-analysis. The author followed Munidatta’s Sanskrit commentary of the Caryapada-text (written in an anti-language to hide the secrets of physiological (not in the Western medical sense of the term) points that is shaped and perceived by the world views of the so-called lower caste Tantric Buddhists)and that was commented in Sanskrit by Munidutta. This reciprocal discourse-exchange bi-way traffic) in between so-called H(igh)and L(ow) was also being observed by the author.\n\nThe paper ironically started with the salutation to the contemporary interpreters of the said text, though the author said that they are missing the world-views of the Tantric Buddhists as the contemporary scholar-interpreters did not link the perceptions of Tantric kayasadhana that is meant for ‘care of self’ (epimelia heatue). Only Shashibhusan Dasgupta (1969) discovered the secrets of the kaya(corporeal). Thus, the scholarship was condemned by the Caryapada-composers, who were considered to be ‘illiterate’ according the norms of literacy. Dasgupta(ibid) thus described the “illiterates’”(?) aversion to the recondite scholarship.\n\nAfter that the author elaborated the rhetoric-terms (utpreksa/metaphor, comparison in general, vyaja/ having only appearance of, deceitful, false, simulated..) used by Munidutta to explain the surplus meanings of the texts. Even the author supplied the architectural details of Kakhar (female-shaped shrines) temples (Orissa) to explain the boat-utpreksa as used in Caryapada. Lastly, the author had linked the cakras (so-called Hindu and Buddhist systems were amalgamated here—a case of syncretism) with different stages of speeches/non-speeches (a trajectory from parole to silenceme) and sleeping/non-sleeping to reach the point of “vakpathatia” (cf. caryapada, 37 a cordoned zone of silenceme or paravak) in a tabular form with illustration. One point must be noted: the authors selfhood as a scientist was condemned here by the author himself as he criticized (a) the recent neuro-physicists’ anatomo-bio-political intervention into in body of the sadhakas/ practitioners; (b) the gap between theory and praxis as it was found in recondite scholarship. Thus the paper was an addition to the author’s agenda of introducing two novel disciplinary technologies: Silence and Corporeal studies.\n\nIV\n\nনীরবতার না– ভাষাতত্ত্ব: লালনে Non-Linguistics of Silenceme: Lalon\n\nThe author, as a member of linguist community, of this paper had tried decipher one song of Fakir Lalon Shah (1774–1890 A.D.), one of the line of which is like this “ When silence would swallow non-silence” by deploying various methods of Mandyukoponisad, Bhatrihari’s three stages of languages (baikhari, madhyma, pasyanti) and Abhinavagupta’s paravak. Different body-parts, according to Tantrika world-views, were also illustrated to understand silenceme. The author also incorporated Kabir (1440–1518 A.D.) and Dadu’s (1544–1603 A.D.) epistemological concepts of silenceme, which were beyond the periphery of ‘modern’ linguistics, though physicists are now interested to know the brain-function of such meditative states by using SPECT and PET scan as a part of their anatomo-bio-political agenda. The author ultimately proposed a new disciplinary technology, called “Silence Studies”. In this case, John Cage’s musical compositions deeply influenced the author.\n\nFor\n\nFor detailed discussion, kindly follow hyperlinks (blue-colored titles\n\n“The Movement Within: A Secret Guide To Esoteric Kayaasadhanaa: Caryaapada”.

The author of this paper is contradicting Chomsky’s metanarrative of transcendental cogito. His purvapaksa (opponent’s view, i.e., Chomsky’s hypothesis of linguistic creativity) holds that there is a context free ideal creative speaking subject with zero History. However, author thinks that this ahistorical ideal subject escapes real. What is about speaking subject’s real locus? Where does s/he stand? Does s/he stand in a vacuum? As sometimes in Classical Physics, we presume such vacuum (bodies fall in the “actual” atmosphere behave as if they are falling in a vacuum; falling bodies travels 32 feet per seconds everywhere in the third planet) to continue our agenda for model-theoretic approach. Chomsky’s hypothesis also does not able to avoid such scienticism—his speaking subject stands in a vacuum.Chomsky, who is like an old fashioned physicist, is not only constructing ideal, his interest falls only within the purview of, analogically speaking, VIBGYOR as he, instigated by his Cartesian inheritance, only analyzes so-called “normal”, “natural” sentences without being bothered about the infinite sets of color-shades as perceived by a painter. His theory mercilessly marginalizes ab-normalcy (though the author does not know the exact borderline between normal and abnormal). The author is only emphasizing on the correlation between linguistic organism and human malleability. That is, linguistic creativity may or may not be crippled by the outside sociality asmental/biological linguistic algorithm cannot stand-alone as it is also controlled by the social rules. Formally, author wants to call this interface (in between psyche and society) as “psi” or psychosocial property. This psi-Property reasserts that the being is always in the being-in-the-(social) world as well as being-for-others. The author’s hypothesis is: Context-sensitive creative speaking corporeal with history….\n\nMETHOD\n\nUG is a grandnarrative that is talking about only the positive equality of all human beings, the very concept of which is engendered from the enlightenment-project. The problem is that if we are not talking about this equality, it will be rather difficult to fight all around inequality, which is just an epiphenomenon—a politico-administrative or socio-economic construct. However, I do not find any way except to take recourse to the path of “bhedabheda”—a much discussed phenomenon in the Indian Philosophy—it is at a time identity (abheda) and difference(bheda)—positive equality as well as negative equality. Creative speaking subject is there—out there—but with constraints. It is at a time syad asti (somehow it is) and syad nasti (somehow it is not) and syad avyakvyam (somehow it is indeterminate). The speaking subjects’ linguistic creativity may or may not be crippled by the outside sociality. Despite the fact of threat and violence, one can escape or bypass the threat on the Language Acquisition Device.\n\nResearch Interests:\n\nPsychoanalysis, Philosophy of Mind, Philosophy Of Language,Poststructuralism, Psycholinguistics, and 8 more\n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\nOf course one can design a restricted environment in which such control and such patterns…can be demonstrated, but there is no reason to suppose that any more is learned about the range of human potentialities by such methods than would be learned by observing humans in prison or an army- or in many a schoolroom.” (Chomsky, 1972:114)\n\nThe Crippled Creativity hypothesis\n\ndescribes the correlation between empty linguistic organism and human malleability.\n\nThat is, linguistic creativity may be crippled by the outside sociality and\n\nmental linguistic algorithm may be controlled by social rules.\n\nThis interface between psyche and society is called as Y -( psi or psycho-social) property.\n\nThese Y/psi-Property reasserts that the being is always in the being-in-the-(social)world as well as being-for-others.\n\nIt is a switch over from cognitive psychology to psychoanalysis.\n\nThus,\n\nChomsky: Context free ideal creative speaking subject with zero History\n\nSed contra: Context-sensitive creative speaking corporeal with history….\n\n(the term creative[in the Chomskyan sense of the term]is kept under erasure because creativity is a presence as well as an absence)\n\nProf. Noam Chomsky accepted/approved this hypothesis in personal correspondences.\n\nNEOLOGISM: Crippled Creativity, Psi-properties.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\n”The Crippled Creativity- A Brief Theoretical Perspective.” International Journal of Communications.

Or following Foucault, one may ask, “How has the concept of human nature functioned in our society?”\n\n2) “Suppose that the social and material conditions that prevent free intellectual development were relieved….” (Chomsky: l976: 124)\n\nSED CONTRA: What happens to “creativity”, if these social and material conditions that prevent free intellectual development are reigning in its full form by subjugating human nature?\n\n3) “…. there must be continual struggle against authoritarian social forms that impose restrictions beyond those set by ‘the laws of nature’ “(Chomsky: 1976:133).\n\nSED CONTRA: What happens to the victims of authoritarian oppression? What happen to their creativity?\n\nCORRESPONDENCES WITH CHOMSKY:\n\nCategorized research-works of Debaprasad-10\n\nLANGUAGE MOVEMENTS\n\n(THE GLOTTOPOLITICS OF LINGUISTIC SUBALTERNITY IN MULTILINGUAL INDIA)\n\n#\n\nDebaprasad Bandyopadhyay *\n\n^ দেবপ্রসাদ বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায় ^\n\nLa Filológica Por La Causa\n\nABSTRACT\n\n*For detailed discussion, kindly follow hyperlinks (blue-colored titles) listed below*\n\n(বিস্তারিত আলোচনার জন্য নিচের নীল–রঙের শিরোনামগুলোতে মাউস ক্লিক করে হাইপারলিংকস খুলতে হবে)\n\n(S)talker is searching the imagined boundaries. He was then searching linguistically movement-prone zones–where there was a need/demand/desire for monolingual state, (s)talker would be there. How did people identify themselves with their language? (S)talker was a bit confused as s/he could not find out the enumerated boundary of monolingual state anywhere in India. Even some people had cut a sorry figure to name their own language.\n\nUnder the hegemonic control of standard language within an imagined nation state, the capital-incentive language-Industry is proliferated by the introduction of electronic as well as print capitalism with the help of ideological state apparatuses. If “other” captive varieties’ (so-called dialect) the S/HS, revolt against the central Externalized Language and withdraw their affiliation from the abstract umbrella of the supposed monolingual nation state, the situation is observed as language movement. This is a case of mutual resemblance or anyonyopratibimba, where the dominated is reflecting on the images of the dominator; the dominating paradigm is followed and copied—all the state organs, ideological and repressive state apparatuses, are repeated in a form of reverse mimicry. Thus, svatva is not established, but is manifested in a form of self-other exchanges and reflections. Terrorist state perceives their own image in the bodies of the others; in case of language, that is the linguistic terrorism. On the other hand, Sagina Mahatos are forcefully elaborated and hierarchized by the norms of developmentalism and vulgar vanguardism. (S)talker wishes to call it, “Sagina Mahato Syndrome”. However, there is another side of the story, (S)talker had seen the barefoot pilgrims’ journey— pilgrims’ progress. They were communicating with each other, at the vyavaharika (practical or pragmatic) level, but surprisingly enough, they are maintaining their languages without using speed capitalist instruments. There is no question of identification of language as communication is more important. This pluriligualism needs no money-sign.

LANGUAGE AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n\nDownload (.pdf)\n\nDebaprasad Bandyopadhyay *\n\n^ দেবপ্রসাদ বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায়\n\nABSTRACT\n\nSpeaking/Hearing Subject(S/HS) is desiring to be a machine:\n\nMachine= f (S/HS)\n\nNon-algorithmic zones of Speaking/Hearing Subject with n-nary options are annihilated. Meaning is solidified, condensed. Corpse of corpus is clerically explored. Binary machine does not understand what “understanding” is. Do we not consider Russell’s paradox or Godel’s theorem here or are making fun with non-biodegradable and disposable ostentatious talking toys?\n\nThe status of COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS is questioned here from four perspectives: from the standpoints of (a) Philosophy of science, (b) Natural Science (mismatch between human Cognitive domain and machine algorithms) (c) Social Science (Plurilingual Planning), (d) Algocentricism (in contrast with post-formal subjective and substantive task of Linguistics). These problems are summarized as follows:\n\nPHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE PROBLEM\n\nTHERE IS NOTHING CALLED “PEN-PAPER-CARD LINGUISTICS”\n\nIF COMPUTER MANIPULATES LINGUISTIC DATA THROUGH THE “PEN-PAPER-CARD” METHOD\n\nIS IT JUSTIFIED TO LABEL IT AS A SEPARATE DISCIPLINE?\n\nWHAT IS THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL STATUS OF CORPUS LINGUISTICS???\n\nNATURAL SCIENCE PROBLEM\n\nMATCHING CONDITION BETWEEN “HUMAN COGNITIVE DOMAIN”\n\n&\n\n“MACHINE ALGORITHM”\n\n[Identity in Difference between computer and human being]\n\n[a] RUSSELL’S PARADOX\n\nGODEL’S/ CHURCH’S THEOREM\n\n[b] PROBLEM RAISED BY PENROSE (1990,1994)\n\n&\n\nSEARLE’S CHINESE ROOM PUZZLE\n\n[C] COMPUTER’S HALTING PROBLEM\n\n[d] FUZZINESS OF NATURAL LANGUAGE\n\n[e] POST- FORMAL APPROACH THAT DENIES ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES PROPOSED BY STRUCTURALISTS\n\nPROBLEM OF ALGOCENTRICISM\n\nMetamathematical algorithmic procedural rules ignore the non-algorithmic constitutive rules (?) of human cognition.\n\nSOCIAL SCIENCE PROBLEM\n\nPLURILINGUAL LANGUAGE PLANNING\n\nELECTRONIC CAPITALIST INTERVENTION IN LANGUAGES\n\nTHE EMPIRE OF HYPER-REAL, Simulation……..\n\nNEOLOGISMS: Algocentric Discourse, Electronic Capitalism\n\nTWO INSTANCES OF NON-COMPUTABILITY\n\n(1) FUZZY NUMERALS\n\nOne thing is certain that meaning is uncertain. What a paradox! Aporia! Invented numerals are fuzzy—indeterminacy prevails. An ostentatious toy was made—a fuzzy game. (S)talker tried to depict some non-deterministic and uncertain phenomena revealed in the expressions of numerals by Bangla speakers. The points of arguments are as follows:\n\nHuman quantification is partly or fully different from analyst’s rigorous quantification.\n\nThe following corpus from Bangla has a peculiar nature of non-componentiality or they are rather prototypical.\n\nThis prototypical nature of fuzzy numerals cannot be handled in computational framework or even in the Logical Form. The first set of data deals with idiomatic expressions like:\n\nSat-paMc Seven-five “pros and cons”;\n\nnOy-chOy nine-six “topsy-turvy”;\n\nunis-biS, nineteen-twenty “trifle difference” jaHa bahanno taHay tippanno.\n\njaHa baHanno, taHai tippanno “Whatever is fifty-two, that is fifty-three” (i.e. 52=53) “A trifle difference does not count.”\n\nThe second problem may be termed as “one is not equal to one” problem. A rule of “one deletion” was proposed by Probal Dasgupta (1987).\n\n5 dokanduTo shop-two-classifier.\n\n6.dokanTa shop-singular-classifier.\n\nObviously, “one” is deleted in 6. However, Dasgupta mentioned that ‘one deletion’ is not true in the cases like\n\njOlTa, Water-classifier or\n\ntelTa oil-classifier. In Bangla, one cannot say\n\n*EkTa jOl ‘One-classifier Oil”\n\nHowever, there are some pragmatic cases where such expressions like 9 is possible. The Speaking subject’s perception may still be “one” in those cases– it is ‘one’ as a mass body. Of course, this is not a deterministic physical ‘one’, but one as a whole. When any Bangla speaker says,\n\nphrij theke jOlTa ano. fridge from water classifier\n\nbring “Bring water from the fridge.”,\n\nhis/her intention is to refer “one bottle of water”. Therefore, ‘one” is there in the D-structure, but it is a fuzzy one. The concept of this fuzzy “one” may be further illustrated in the following movement- transformations, where deterministic numeral expressions are changed to non-deterministic Determiner Phrases:\n\n11.a) paMcTa five-classifier (definite)\n\n11.b) goTa paMcek classifier( indef. ) five-one “more or less five “\n\n12.a) paMcjon five-classifier (definite)\n\n12.b) jona paMcek classifier( indef. ) five-one “more or less five “\n\n13.a) paMckhana five-classifier\n\n13.b) khan paMcek ,classifier( indef. ) five-one “more or less five “\n\n14.a) paMc Hajar “five thousand”\n\n14.b) Hajar paMcek thousand five-one. “more or less five thousand”\n\n15.a) paMc lakh, five lacs\n\n15.b) lakh paMcek lacs five-one “more or less five lacs”\n\nExamples like 11-15 show those deterministic expressions in (a) and non-deterministic expressions in (b). Compared to (a), examples in (b) show the fronting of classifiers with subsequent morphophonemic change and an addition of /ek/ “one” to the specific numeral x. This one is not deterministic +-1, but this “one” has a range more or less than +- 1.\n\nThese Bangla numeral expressions show the world-views of the community concerned with a special reference to their psychophysical way of looking at things (perception) and ways of making order of things (understanding). Therefore, it is a hermeneutic problem that involves the relative gap between human perception and understanding in relation to their habitat. The range of +-1 is different in different persons belonging to different socio-economic classes or even it may be different in a single person in different psychosocial context. A game had been developed by his engineering students\n\n(2) PERCEPTUAL AND GRAMMATICAL TIME\n\nPerceptual time is supplemented by grammatical tense. Do we need to deploy tensor calculus here? That is ridiculous. Let us watch the watch in the time of eco-enemy technocratic society guided by technical rationality.\n\nThere are different types of time, (a) technological time as it is followed by watching the watch by selecting a norm (GMT); (b) grammatical time as it is revealed in the textbooks of Grammar; (c) perceptual time as it is perceived by the speaking subjects of a given speech community; (d) Scientific time as it is calculated by the locus of the perceived by deploying Tensor Calculus. The author showed that the prescriptions of grammatical time do not match with the perceptual time of different communities. The author argued that the tenses and aspects as categorized in the Bangla prescriptive grammars ignore the perceptions of the construct “time” by the speakers of the imagined community “Bangla” as the conjugational paradigm in the Bangla grammar book is the mimicry of English prescriptive grammatical paradigms, e.g.,\n\nami tomar baRi kal jacchi\n\nI your house tomorrow go present continuous\n\n“ I am going to your house tomorrow”\n\nami tomake kal rastay dekhechi.\n\nI you dative yesterday road locative see present perfect\n\n“I have seen you on the road yesterday.”\n\nIn the case of 1, all the Bengali-speaking informants perceived /jacchi/ as future tense (I will go..) and in the case of 2, /dekhechi/ is perceived as past tense (I saw) instead of prescribed “present perfect” (which is traditionally used to denote “immediate past), though prescriptive grammar categorically put an imperative for not using “present perfect” in the sense of past (cf. Chattopadhyay, 1939: 322). It is matter of wonder that there is no linguistic work so far on the perceptual time in Bangla.\n\nThis paper also concentrated on the semiotics of time in Cinema or particularly on the concept of time in the hyper-real, real (as it is symbolized) and in the ir-real. The author compared the difference between “reel” time and “real” time at the moment of perceiving hyper-real. As the author has dealt with the subjective perceptions of time in different locus and contexts by different individuals of different imagined communities, it is concluded that there is no generalized objective parameters for the historical a priori, “time”.\n\nANOTHER SIDE OF THIS NARRATIVE\n\nAlgorithms are used to simulate intonation:MUSICKING AND SPEAKING: DIFFERaNCE (SEGMENTING THE SUPRASEGMENTALS) Download (.pdf)\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nIn the beginning of my career, I dare to ask Chomsky all about this man-machine equation; about impossibility of Artificial Intelligence; about his algocentric discourse that follows machine algorithm(especially the use of the term ‘computation’); about his model-theoretic approaches….\n\nHis answers are as follows:\n\nFor detailed discussion, kindly follow hyperlinks (blue-colored titles)\n\n“Linguistic Cybercolonization”.

The India census reports since 1871 were put to show the lacunas of statistical survey techniques that helped to construct genealogical fantasy and nation statist boundary. Secondly, the tensed relationship between Laksminath BejBarua, an Asamiya writer, and Rabindranth Tagore was shown to understand the impact of extra-linguistic variables at the moment of a birth of nation in the context of colonialism. Thirdly, the role of print capitalism was depicted through the abstract ID: 2015951 endeavor of Fakirmohan Senapati, an Odia writer, by analyzing the discourse of his biography. Otherwise the abstract of this Bangla paper is as same as Abstract ID: 2024842.\n\nAll the linguistic movements in colonial India lead to the demand/desire for autonomy in different spheres and were linked with anti-imperialistic nationalist movement, though on the contrary, all these movements had become the mirror image of dominant others’ nation statist mimic imagination. In this way, there was a demand for “autonomous” and “pure” tool indigenous grammar (free from “adulteration”) of a well-defined enumerated and “pure” language which is selected centrally as a standard language. Therefore language-managers of a given community did two things: a) they, as a member of imagined community, defined the language boundary (i.e. selection of standard and extension of the standard language from centre to periphery) and b) managed that language with the help of a tool called grammar.\n\nIn this paper, the author tries to show the Bengalee intellectuals’ (language judge/-police/-managers) perspectives (19th. C. and the first three decades of the 20th C) on the issue of autonomy of two neighbouring languages, viz. Oriya and Asamiya, two neighboring languages of Bangla. The paper shows a classical centre-periphery relation, where Bengal as a centre, wanted to subsume the periphery through hegemonic selving in course of standardizing and extending the political geography of Bangla with the supposed language module. The situation shows dialectic of hegemonic inclusion, which creates internal colonization, and thus captive languages with a feeling of derivative nationalism were trying to combat external colonization as well. These cases in the colonial period and at the time of the birth of a new nation states might help us to apprehend the post-colonial withdrawal syndrome from the other defeated varieties (i.e., so called “dialects”).\n\nA Dialogue on Linguistic Creativity\n\nDownload (.pdf)\n\nDebaprasad Bandyopadhyay\n\nদেবপ্রসাদ বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায়\n\nIndian Statistical Institute, Kolkata\n\nThis paper is an abridged transcript of an imagined dialogue between Prof. Pro-Chomsky (PC) and Mr. Anti- Chomsky (AC). AC’s point of departure from Chomskian innateness hypothesis was mainly guided by Rolland Barthes, M. Foucault, and J. Kristeva. AC has risen following points in connection with the Chomskian innateness hypothesis:\n\n1. From where does the ideal speaking subject speak? Where is the locus of ideal speaking subject? What is about the history of such ideal speaking subject? Does the outside influence in formation of inside LAD? What happens to transcendental Cogito (as postulated in Cartesian Linguistics), when it is subjected to the outside sociality? (Here I am inkling towards Psychoanalysis — to the construct of “psyche” rather than that of cogito as I am emphasizing on the society-psyche interface).\n\n2. PC, out of his Cartesian anxiety, considers body as a machine. He deploys technical metaphors (e.g., The terms like “Computation’, “array” “interface”, “parser “etc or operations like “COMMAND”, “SATISFY”, “SPELL OUT”) for explaining human body. These are not metaphors or case of displacement only, but a case of metonymic transformation of human body as these technical metaphors condense the scope of human potentiality. Does human body follow algorithm only? Do we not have extra-/non-algorithmic cognitive ability? (AC’s point is that Cognitive Domain is not algorithmic only.)\n\n3. Chomskian syntax analyzes the algorithm of “normal” “well-formed” sentences only. Apart from the exclusion of institution-body correlation in the Chomskian hypothesis, this very construction of “natural language” (e.g., the well-constructed written sentences) mercilessly marginalizes the language of so-called non-“natural” madness or folly. How do we know the differences between normal way of speaking and abnormal way of speaking? This question was initiated by Foucault (1968) to beg the premise of Cartesian cogito. Chomsky, who is like an old-fashioned physicist, is interested in VIBGYOR. However, in the domain of Art (where infinite sets of colors are illuminating) and literature, there is a proliferation of “deviations” from “normal standard” (as constructed by the Ideological State Apparatuses) and without such “deviations” no work of art or literature is possible. Is this domain of Art and Literature, a domain of unreason or madness or is it un-scientific?\n\n4. According to AC, Chomskian syntax is an anotomo-bio-political tool for knowing the docile body of the speaking subject. The will to know the body(especially cognitive domain) of the speaking subject leads to the will to power over the docile body of the stable subject, who is objectified at the moment of deployment of syntactic tools. Thus, the subjectification of discipline of Linguistics (an enlightenment project) is possible.\n\n“সরলরেখায় ইন্ডিক ভাষা-ইতিহাস: সমস্যার ইতিহাস” (Linear History of Indic Language: Some Problems of Historiography).\n\nDebaprasad Bandyopadhyay\n\nদেবপ্রসাদ বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায়\n\nIndian Statistical Institute, Kolkata\n\nJanuary 9, 2009\n\n2009. “Sorolrekhay Indic bhaSa itiHaS: SomoSSar itiHaS”.[Linear History of Indic Language: Some Problems of Historiography] Ed.

The author compared, with the help of the concept of Foucauldian genealogy, this linear history with ‘fast forward-rewind’ phenomenon in magnetic tapes.\n\nThere were four case studies offered by the author to nullify institutionalized linear chronological history of Indic languages as proposed by Suniti Kumar Chatterji and Sukumar Sen: (a) the dating of the Rgveda: it is not the oldest Veda, but constructed in the 6th C. B.C. by marginalizing Samasongs by means of grammaticalization/codification of Rg-recitations (cf. SSRN Paper ID: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2021917, http://ssrn.com/abstract=2018055) ; (b) the Jataka- narratives were composed almost 500 to 600 years after the death of Buddha, though scholars had put it within the lifetime of Buddha; (c) In case of constructing the linguistic history of imagined Bangla, the author put a simple question: if anyone ask Luipada (one of the Carya- poets) or Candidasa (composer of Srikrsnakirtana) or the king Laksmanasena: are you a Bengali? Obviously they did not understand the connotation of Bangla/Bengali that was a 19th C. product/construct or historical apriori; (d) looking at the ontogeny of language acquisition, when a child is forming ”go-goed “ (Bangla examples are cited) type analogical formation, other-mirrors started to “rectify” it. The problematic question is: which one is earlier and which one is after?\n\nAccording to author this institutionalized linear history of language, that, peculiarly enough, overlaps with history of literature, subscribes the nation statist genealogical fantasy and deals only with substantive arbitrary epi-phenomenal E-linguistic features—a leisure class’s conspicuous consumption. The problem of Comparative Philology or Historical linguistics is that this enterprise largely depends on the entailment theory of causality and frequent (?)One-after-another occurrences of arbitrary signifiers lead them to a dogmatic bad faith! If Chomskian UG is to be believed, how do we classify languages genealogically? And that is an inner contradiction of the linguistics. (cf. SSRN Paper ID: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2015064, http://ssrn.com/abstract=2029974). This type of History is not only ahistorical, but anti-historical non-epistemology.\n\nKeywords: Regulatory Theory, pratyavijna, Historicism, grammaticalization, ksnikatavada, Foucauldian genealogy, language-police/-judge/-managers, semiotic order, ‘fast forward-rewind’ phenomenon in magnetic tapes\n\n“চোট-পাট বেত্তান্ত [Jute Industry in West Bengal]”\n\nদেবপ্রসাদ বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায়\n\nIndian Statistical Institute\n\nJanuary 25, 2007\n\ncoT-paT bettanto, Tepantar Vol. VI, pp.29-66, 2008\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe investigator, out of his severe guilt feeling as he is a member of the leisure class, executed some self-funded projects related to socio-economic conditions of West Bengal. One of them is jute industry in West Bengal, India. He had surveyed jute cultivation and industry (59 Factories). Methodologically speaking, he had not followed any statistical sample survey techniques as he wished to reject state-statistics unholy nexus following Foucauldian paradigm; secondly, under the deployment of scheduled survey techniques, subjects were objectified and they underwent metonymic transformation. According to investigator, a Foucauldian, that is a sever violence. Therefore, instead of this technique he followed his own version of qualitative ethno-methodology or snow-ball method for understanding such domains. His findings are as follows: • Economics is not a so-called natural science that could be guided by the laws of physics. Thus the universalization of economic laws is not at all possible. Econometric analysis does not able to predict future economic condition. • The governmental statistics does not match with the ground-reality narratives. • The so-called binary division between organized and unorganized sector does not work at all — a fuzzy zone of organized-unorganized sector has been evolved in the West Bengal industrial scenario. • The existence of disembodied (a phantom or ghost-like entity) owners of several industries has been observed in organized jute industry, coal industry as well as in unorganized basalt-quarries. • Due to automation and manipulative procedures taken by the owners of industries and due to the conversion of surplus labour-necessary labour ratio in the form of money-sign, null-workers are “working” without any work in the sphere of economy. The extraction is possible due to the diachronically accumulated surplus labor from the deceased null workers. Null workers exist and do not exist. • By the virtue of the labour of the deceased null workers, owners are creating a accumulative space, where one can convert money-sign to another money-sign, i.e., the domain of dangerous share market. Specters of the null workers are not at all haunting here, where capital to commodity transformation has become merely a place of conspicuous consumption of the minority super-rich people, who have the fetish for the ostentatious display of eco-enemy commodities. • The role of state is minimal — collusion of super-rich, a minority, is reigning with the help of ideological state apparatuses. • The investigator is emphasizing on using local terms to depict the nature of economics as it is found in glocal (global local) context of West Bengal. If Sahibs could use so-called anti-languages like plum or lemon market, what is wrong with the terms like lokkhibar (no consuming day), tola (illegal levy), pORta (covert weight), gunda tax (tax to be paid to the goons), bani (the hidden residue of the gold at the time of reselling), Soru line (illegal path) phoRe (the ‘illegal’ agent), cinHat (signs or a type of archewriting that regulates the parallel market with legal conflict)? • The role of political parties here surprising enough. There is no question of ideology as advertised by the respective parties, rather they are using ideology as a mask. They are acting as private limited company as the corporatization of those parties guided by management gurus has successfully established in the dollar-controlled democracy.\n\nNote: Downloadable document is in Bengali.\n\nNumber of Pages in PDF File: 19\n\nKeywords: null worker, disembodied owners, surplus extractor, fuzziness of formal-informal sectors\n\nFinal Sound-Initial Sound: A Note on Playing Antyaksari\n\nDebaprasad Bandyopadhyay\n\nIndian Statistical Institute\n\nSTUDIES IN PHONETICS AND PHONOLOGY, pp. 110-113, K. Nagamma Reddy, A. R. Fatihi, eds., Ess Ess Publications, 2002\n\nAbstract:\n\nHindi /antaksOri /, Bangla / Ontakkhori / ‘final letter‘ is the name of a popular game based on songs. One person initiates any song and another one takes the cue from the final sound of the song’s final word to start a new song in a given language. Thus, the final sound has become and must become the initial sound and if one fails to do so within a stipulated time, s/he fails to score.\n\nOnce we, in Bengal, played /Ontakshori /, nowadays we are playing /antaksOri /, thanks to the popularization of Hindi /OntaksOri / – programmes in TV. The hegemony of Hindi as a superstratum wins at last.\n\nThis code-mixing is not the concern of this paper, rather it concentrates on the perception of sounds by the Bangla speakers, when they are playing the game. As all the final sounds do not occur in the initial position, e.g., /R/ and four semi vowels: / Y / (front mid), / W / (back mid), / y / (front high), / w / (back high) they are interpreted differently. The rule of the game and management of sounds are important here as they reveal the nature of perception by the native speakers of Bangla.\n\nHowever, what is revealing in this game is that, as Derrida asserts in his proposed Grammatology, writing has its own rule as well as speaking and behind every act of speaking there is writing and vise versa. This paper reasserts this position by showing that ‘writing’ (in the crude sense of the term) may also intervene in the domain of speaking. One may then, look into the domain of ‘spelling pronunciation’ for further elaboration of the fact.\n\nNote that the word “differance” as spelt by Derrida, at a time handles “to differ” and “to defer” shows the so-called autonomy of (arche-)writing or its own play with itself without being a supplement of speaking. Literate Bangla-speakers, at the time of playing this pleasurable game, defer the difference of r-R. This paper follows many technical terms as developed by Derrida in his proposed Grammatology, viz. trace, supplement, erasure…….\n\nNumber of Pages in PDF File: 3\n\nKeywords: perceptual phonetics, grammatology, differAnce, supplement, trace\n\n“Creative Cogito and Disturbed Corporeal”\n\nDownload (.pdf)\n\nDebaprasad Bandyopadhyay\n\nদেবপ্রসাদ বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায়\n\nIndian Statistical Institute, KolkataAbstract:\n\nThis paper is on the refutation of “scientific” notion of creative speaking/hearing subject with zero history a la Chomsky or rather on the falsification of this metanarrative of “ideal” speaker-hearer. The counter-hypothesis, in a nutshell, describes the correlation between empty linguistic organism and human malleability — that is, creative speaking subject is a myth (in the Bartheian sense of the term). The idea is to investigate the traces of outside sociality in the mental linguistic algorithm as non-contaminated Language Acquisition Device (LAD) does not exist. The author calls this phenomenon as psi-(psycho-social) property of human mind. In this paper, the author wishes to discuss briefly three basic as well as interrelated problems in relation with linguistic cognition in general. The problems are as follows: I. Is there any relationship between “empty linguistic organism” and “social malleability”? Or, what are the effects of socio-linguistic externally to psycholinguistic internally? Do we really have human-object in such a raw state as posited by Chomsky without being constrained or manipulated by the outside sociality? II. What is the matching condition between human cognition and computational algorithm? Or, what is identity in difference (bhedābheda) in computational cognition and human cognition? III. How does we recover perceive and recognize the deleted portion of a sentence or a word when we are perceived sentence?\n\nThis third question is related to the unique capacity of human cognition, that negates even the possibilities of the second question and the second question is a derivative of social condition depicted in the first problem. Providing this small clue, I would like to discuss these three problems in the following three separate sections, which are further divided into different subsections. The sections of the paper are as follows: Section 1 poses the problems with the notions of Internalized and externalized language Thus, in the Section 1 of this paper the problem regarding the speaking subject’s body as well as language will be presented. Section 2 concentrates on the facts and fictions. Thus it deals with these “fictitious” facts taken from different types of literature. Section 3 attacks Chomskian hypothesis within the gharana within his inherited enlightenment project. This section also briefly introduces the theories, which are not within the purview of Chomskian schooling. This section inter-/rupts/-pretes the “facts” (as presented in Section 2) and two diagrams (as presented in Section 1) with the help of divergent theories. I am strategically smuggling my voice, as a sub-altern local intellectual, into the voices of Sahibs as we cannot do without sahibs. Thus this section accounts for different schools of thought to subscribe the problem as presented in Section 1. Section 4 concludes that the meta-narrative of speaking subject is a “myth” in Bartheian sense of the term and puts forward the hypothesis of “crippled creativity” or “end of dialogue.” The problem arises in this stable situation, when different scholars from different schools of thoughts are trying to search out an “ideal speech situation.” These scholars are ranging from Marxist, Existentialist, Hermeneutician, Psychoanalysts, Critical Theorist to Post-structuralist and some Third-worId activists. Why are they striving for language? Is there something wrong with our language? Do we not create infinite sets of sentences out of finite sets of words despite the fact that we are living within the behavioral world of manipulation? What happens to our competence or our internalized Language? If we do not face problems of language generation, there would be no question of proposing “ideal Speech situation” or “intersubjective interaction” between speaker and hearer on the part of Habermas or Third world activists. This striving for “ideal speech situation” is preceded by suffering, which, according to Freud is “obvious” “common know/edge” to us (Freud, 1930: 94) and it is not an illusion (or persecutory paranoia) that can be eradicated by technical intervention or inducing medicine. The different domains of state apparatuses, school, prison, army, bureaucracy use behavioral technique to manipulate body-object.\n\nNumber of Pages in PDF File: 42\n\nKeywords: Psi-properties, Crippled Creativity\n\nAccepted Paper Series\n\n“(M)Other Tongue Syndrome: From Breast To Bottle.”\n\nDownload (.pdf)\n\nDebaprasad Bandyopadhyay\n\nদেবপ্রসাদ বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায়\n\nIndian Statistical Institute, Kolkata\n\nSTUDIES IN SOCIOLINGUISTICS AND APPLIED LINGUISTICS, pp. 87-106, R. Kumar, ed., Booklinks, 2001\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis paper explores, from the perspectives of different inter-disciplines, the genesis of the historical a priori, “Mother Tongue” (MT) instigated by a sexist question, “Why is it not Father Tongue?” It at a time relates psychology of mother-child relation in specific social milieu and its implications in Psycholinguistics and History of the concept in relation to the birth of nation-state. In India, the word “mother” has been deployed in the realm of land and language and subsequently proliferated in every sphere of discourses. Is it only due to the social proximity of mother-child that gives birth to such notions? When “the name of the Father” is dominating the social sphere, and the Father’s tongue is child’s tongue, why the name of the dominated mother is nominated and affiliated to the objects like “land” and “language?” This discussion on the MT inaugurates four distinct issues: (a) The mother to other or breast-to-bottle switch-over [in case of language death]; (b) The proliferation of (M)other-tongue Industry aided by professionals; (c) Mother-children dyad in relation to language acquisition; (d) the artificial means for detaching the dyad by the introduction of feeding bottle Industry. Author did not agree with Kakkar (1981:55) that the “controversy between breast and bottle feeding” is “false.” I think, the switch over from breast to bottle has a larger implication in understanding gestalt of “mothering” in its psycho-physiological connotations or in its metaphoric senses as revealed in “mother land” and “MT.” The metaphor of “breast to bottle” switch over stimulates us to look into the history of Industrialization in which the “nature” is defeated by the manufacturing of technological “culture”. Author’s imaginative effort to feminize the “tongue “ends in vein as the author admitted that the term “MT,” since the term was first used, had never meant the vernacular, but rather its contrary. The term was used by Catholic monks to designate a particular language they used, instead of Latin, when they are “speaking from the pulpit” (Illich in Patttanayak, 1981:24). That is, the “holy mother of the Church” introduced this term and it was inherited it from the Christianity, thanks to the effort made by foreign missionaries in the colonial period in India. Illich (ibid) aptly pointed out that the word “MT was introduced into Sanskrit in the eighteenth century as a translation from English.” It is not only a derivative technical term, born out of translation, but it was also altered as the Indian mother-cult had also an impact on this translation. The total endeavor to relate mother-child with the language-acquisition process is nothing but a fantasy as the biological mother has nothing to do with the language-object per se in a given all pervading patriarchal culture except to introduce substantial inputs to the child like “other” associates of the child. The author concluded that the “MT” as a metaphor is a politico-theosophical construct that, later on, has become a technical term in the discursive formation of administration and academics. Culture supplies us notion; we then try to make their notations and we neutralize that symbol by deploying different “scientific” and “cultural” methods. However, the symbolic order retains its symbolism. The whole discursive formation circling around MT is endowed here with the metaphoric illness and thus termed as “(M)OTHER TONGUE SYNDROME.”\n\nNumber of Pages in PDF File: 12\n\nKeywords: Symbolic Order, Mother Tongue, Linguistic Human Right"
