        "text": "The song with sequence of four kings and the compilation of songs with jack of all trades / joker kind sequence:\n\nOn the eve of the centenary celebration of the marvelous actor of Hindi films, who was hailed as the king of acting and role model of the acting, Yousuf saab aka Dilip Kumar, this is a tribute to him through one of his unique lip-synched songs. The history of Hindi film industry will remain incomplete without His mention, in fact won’t start without his name.\n\nNot only films and its hit scenes but the songs he enacted were also made memorable by this actor who weas branded as Tragedy King by the Hindi film critics. Even while not lip-synching he would command the attention of the viewers by his sheer authoritative presence. For only two times he entered the singing booth too. First time in Musafir with the nightingale Lata ji in the song ‘laagi naheen chhute‘ ( link here). The return of his singing Karma was in the song ‘har karam apna karenge‘ (Link here)\n\nFor the rest of his prime period, he and his music directors commanded the voice of the then ruling singer king, Mohammad Rafi. There was an occasional detour to Mahendra Kapoor (Ramchandra kah gaye Siya se) who was clone of Rafi saab in the 60s and he became quite a permanent choice of playback to him after the demise of Rafi saab and a lovely punctuation of legendary Salil da-Mukesh (‘suhana safar aur yeh mausam haseen‘ ).\n\nGhor kalyug did arrive (as depicted in the song of Gopi) when the lesser mortal and one of the many clones of Rafi saab, Mohammad Aziz, did playback to the King actor.\n\nIn all those years, neither He nor his music directors thought of trying the playback of Kishore da, whose career took a U(pward) turn with his playback singing career rising with the success of Aradhana and Amar Prem. How could they? It was unbelievable for them in their wildest dreams. The association would never gel in the viewing and listening minds of film lovers.\n\nWith his growing age, Dilip saab’s magic of giving hit films began to fade out in the late 60s and the early 70s. He also did a Bangla film in 1970 named Sagina mahato, which won the National award but the remake of the same in the following 74s named Sagina failed to recreate the magic.\n\nIt however got the distinction of being the only film when the two ‘K‘ings , D’K‘ and K‘K‘ united together, not for one for as many as four songs which covered quite a few genres like festive dance ( gajab chamke bindiya tori aadhi raat) , the hilly region folk tipsy (‘uparwala dukhiyon ko naheen sunta re‘) , an absolutely cute folk romantic duet ( ‘tumhare sang to rain bitayi‘ with the antara tune diverting to antara of ‘albela main ek dilwala‘ of the same M.D., link here ) and this absolute and comic rollercoaster\n\n‘Saala main to sahab ban gaya’.\n\nOf course, the music director of the movie had a lot to do for making this King combination happen. Kishore da must have rejoiced that moment by erupting with joy with ‘Saala main to Yousouf) saab ka playback ban gayaa.‘\n\nThe song is a thorough entertainer and Majrooh saab, as usual, comes to the (Tea) party for that background of Tea estate workers and the Hero, Sagina’s revolt against the tyranny of British regime.\n\nHe (Majrooh) beautifully depicts the influence of the British colonial mindset in his lyrics and how! The suit, boot, London, the crushing and dismissing mentality ‘tum langotiwala na badla hai na badlega‘ and the swag along ‘tum sab saala loag ka kismat hum saala badlega‘, everything is so apt and impressive and that too in a very entertaining way, just like the tune, orchestration and the high-headed singing by the king of comedy singing, Kishore da.\n\nAll of these aspects of musical entertainment complement each other so beautifully to reign on our musical ears and the Sun of this song will never set just like the once-upon-a-time true boast of the British empire.\n\nKishore da too was in command of the film singing in the 70s and remained like that till his demise in ’87 and even if he didn’t but the boast of ‘Tum sab saala hero log ka kismat hum saala badlega‘ was certainly in the air and A.I.R.\n\nAlthough, barring this movie, they didn’t work together, they did have immense respect for each other’s talents that depicts in the images displayed at the start.\n\nLet’s enjoy this unique combo in this Kingly song to raise the toast for King Kishore Kumar, the music composing King from Tripura Gharana, Sachin da, the lyricist emperor, Asrar Khan aka Majrooh and acting King and Mughal-e-Shehzaada, Salim, Yousuf saab with baa-adab and ba-mulahija for his 100th Saalgiraah.\n\nLong live the Tragedy, in fact all-rounder acting King!\n\nSong video: Press here\n\nWhat a kingly sequence, yeh Suit inka dekho, yeh swag inka dekho…\n\nIn the game of rummy, this is a quartet. There is also a situation where a sequence can be completed by a card called proper joker and the one which is designated as a joker for any particular game which can complete the sequence.\n\nListen to the progression of the stanzas, typically along\n\n“waah Fakire, suit pahankar (link here)\n\nkaisa kude-faande,\n\nKauwa jaise pankh mayur\n\nka apni dum mein baandhe’\n\nThis is quite a familiar folk meter/ progression you will think when I specifically mention it. This meter/ progression is our joker/ jack of all the following songs which has been added by the music directors at the different positions.This will be an extended treat in this all-Kings union event.\n\nListen to this popular song from the proper album as the first one in this interesting sequence.\n\nKaliraam ka khul gaya pol : Barsaat ki ek raat\n\nLyricist : Anand Bakshi\n\nThere is another king superstar, Amitabh Bachchan, who has recently won not only the challenge of the villain, Amjad Khan, in the dhol play competition but also the Heart of the beautiful queen, Rakhi, in a Durga pooja festival and this joker kind meter of\n\n‘kauwa hans ki chaal chala\n\nlangdake thoda thoda,\n\nek gadhe ne koshish ki\n\nwoh bhi ban jaaye ghoda’\n\nto add salt over the mental wounds of Amjad Khan to make the situation more Hari-Bol..I mean horrible for him.\n\nIt not only goes with the meter of antara of sagina song but also with the lyrical sentiment of\n\n‘kauwa jaise pankh mayoor ka\n\napne dum mein baandhe‘.\n\nAlthough all the songs of this bilingual project of Barssat ki Ek raat & Anusandhaan (Bangla) by Shakti Samanta are exact replicas of tune and orchestra wise this song is distinctly different than its Bangla counterpart ‘bolo Horibol Hori bol‘ (Link here, recreation of ‘baap ka maal’, ‘aami tak dhum‘) and this joker of the sequence adds a crispy zing. Mark that it plays a cameo tonot appear further in that song.\n\nLink here if video below not available.\n\nInterestingly, second song has exactly the same situation, same King singer (Kishore), same Tripura Prince composer ( RDB) another bangla Chakravarti King Mithun and similar bilingual project like BKER/Anusandhaan\n\nbut/ PARANTU\n\nthe bangla director is different, another Chakravarty King Pramod and to add to this Kingly sequence, the joker phrase appears only in the bangla counterpart.\n\nDekhle Kemon Tumi Khel: Anyay Abhichaar – Lyricist: Gauri Prasanna Mazumder\n\nAnyay Abhichar was a similar bilingual project by Pramod Chakraborty, another Burman loyalist like Shakti Samanta, the Hindi counterpart being ‘Aar paar’ (1984) . This song is bangla counterpart of ‘gali gali chor hai‘ ( link here ) and the situation is similar to that of ‘kaliram ka phat gaya dhol’ that is the public embarrassment of the main villain played by Utpal Dutt. Interestingly, he also played the main villain and father of Amjad khan in BKER/ Anusandhaan.\n\nThis joker-ly cameo of the phrase is happy again to do verbal as-salt on the villain to make the song recipe tangier.\n\nVideo link : Press here.\n\nThis joker phrase appears, once again as a cameo at the start of the song to complete the sequence of kings in this non film bangla song but with a slight difference.\n\nBaba, khoka, keno..bolo.. Lyricist – Mukul Dutt\n\nMusic: R.D.Burman Bangla non film\n\nThe versatile singer king is here again to present a double role vocal song in which he presents a beautiful dialogue between a dominant and ever criticizing father (Baba) and his naughtily defensive and respect-giving son (khoka) all by himself, just like one person playing chess from both sides.\n\nTrust thus vocal and composer king to make it interesting enough with the language being no barrier. The composer king wet on to give its hindi version, ‘Daddy Sunny‘ while making the antara reuse in ‘chaar dinon ki hai yeh zindagani‘ and ‘yeh duniya jungle hai ‘.\n\nEnjoy the joker start that makes this King-king confrontation sequence amazingly entertaining.\n\nAudio link : Press here\n\nNext song and we have more than an interesting situation for it is the revisit of the actor king and birthday celebrity, Dilip Kumar, although in a guest appearance.\n\nChori ho to chor pakad le- Phir kab milogi\n\nSingers- Chorus\n\nLike you all know, three jokers can make one pure sequence in Rummy, here there are six jokers that make it a double treat. The lyrical and (folk) dance cameo is interesting in more than an aspect.\n\nFirst, as stated earlier, it has six jokers that make this sequence unique in all of the songs in this category. Moreover, it is rare to have a song like this that is sung by choral or unidentified singers only. Each phrase is like an argument followed by a counter argument with each phrase being punctuated by the sharp percussive phrases played on ‘Tasha’.\n\nIn the visuals, it is King Dilip kumar aided by Abhi Bhattacharya, before whom, the members of kabila present their arguments. Not many, even quite die-hard fans of pancham are aware of this rare folk beauty that gets over in less than two minutes.\n\nVideo link: Press here\n\nNot all the sequences are male dominated like the following one which is mainly dominated by the vocal queen Asha Bhosale in another folk song situation.\n\nBichhua bane piya tere nain : Paanch Dushman /\n\nDaulat ke Dushman Lyricist: Majrooh\n\nThe film was a delayed project produced by Manu Narang and he cast himself as hero. The soundtrack was first released in the name of ‘5 dushman’ in 1973 and again in 1983 as ‘Daulat ke Dushman’.\n\nThe movie and his acting were disastrous, but the soundtrack was A-1 and was dominated by the greats of the likes of Kishore-Lata-Asha-Rafi. The male voice of this folk song picturised on Aruna Irani in a folk dance is wrongly credited to Kishore kumar on disc as it is actually sung by an extra/ unidentified singer.\n\nAsha Bhosale is like queen here as she breezes through the dance sequence with usual finesse and this joker phrase not only kick-starts the proceedings with\n\n‘aaj jamaa hai kunj galee mein\n\nsab gokul ke praanee’\n\nbut also jacks the ending with\n\n‘dhadak dhadak ke dhadke jiyara\n\ndhadke aur phir tarase‘\n\nSng video link: Press here although it misses the starting joker card.\n\nSong audio: Press here\n\nAnother kunj galee and ‘mela’ of Gokul ke praani that includes the Gopi-s of Vraj and Lord Krishna that graces the last one but very special one in this sequence.\n\nAll the entries so far have been connected to the DevBurmans but this last but not the least entry is non DevBurman and non-Hindi and non Bengali.\n\nAre Kanha de re choli – Lata Mangeshkar – Chorus\n\nFilm – Pinjara Music Ram Kadam\n\nLyricist: Jagdish Khebudkar\n\nLata Mangeshkar has sung very few Marathi lavani (Marathi folk dance) songs compared to her siblings, Asha Bhosale and Usha Mangeshkar. This song from the movie, Pinjara, directed by V.Shantaram, was based on the confrontation of a lavani dancer played by Sandhya and a school master played by Dr Shriram Lagoo. Obviously, the soundtrack was dominated by lavani songs and this Gan-Gavlan type song was the only song sung by Lata Mangeshkar.\n\nAfter the compere by the male singer comes Lata Mangeshkar’s goosebumps of a rendition of a phrase that follows the common meter of the phrase from 41 sec onwards.\n\nfor audio link : Press here.\n\nWith my limited knowledge I could find out these six songs, I would love to know additional entries across the languages of India.\n\nAnyways, these all geniuses are Kings in their respective fields, and I am a mere fan of these gems of musical works.\n\nIn the words of Majrooh of the main Sageena Song,\n\n‘Kaisa yeh Raaja Bhoj ka sequence sunaye yeh Gangu teli…’ but still had a great desire to put these elaborate expressions to be a Song(u) telli. Kya karein\n\n“Hum langotiwala na badla hai na badlega” for being Aadat se majboor.\n\nHope you enjoyed this musical Rummy game of Kingly sequence jacked by the common jokers."
