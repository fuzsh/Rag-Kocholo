There are many educational and inspiring events connected to the Walk and AAPI Heritage Month in May, including a traveling exhibit at the Museum titled Towards Equity: California’s Chinese American Women graciously on loan from the Chinese Historical Society of America.\n\nThe Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History is a proud partner of this event and would like to recognize the efforts and thank our partners and contributors at the Quok Mui Foundation, the Coalition for Asian Justice, the Chinese Historical Society of America, Hopkins Marine Station, the City of Pacific Grove, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium.\n\nWe had a great 2024, See Below for the Schedule & Supporting Events"
