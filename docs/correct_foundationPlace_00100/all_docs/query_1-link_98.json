Therefore, our relationships, job performance, what we are willing to do or are able to resist, all move in a positive direction.\n\n— Dr. Francine Shapiro\n\nResearch & Development at EMDR Institute\n\nPushing Boundaries\n\nEMDR is now accepted as a treatment of choice by numerous mental health departments and trauma organizations.\n\nEMDR has a broad base of published case reports and controlled research that supports it as an empirically validated treatment of trauma and other adverse life experiences. The Department of Defense/Department of Veterans Affairs Practice Guidelines have placed EMDR in the highest category, recommended for all trauma populations at all times.\n\nInternational Treatment Guidelines\n\nMeta-Analyses\n\nRandomized Controlled Trauma Studies\n\nNon-Randomized Trauma Studies\n\nAdaptive Information Processing and EMDR Procedures\n\nMechanism of Action\n\nRandomized Studies of Hypotheses Regarding Eye Movements\n\nAdditional Neurobiological Evaluations\n\nCombat Veteran Treatment\n\nPublications & Findings\n\nAccess to latest research papers, articles, and findings from the institute.\n\nDual Attention Stimuli\n\nPhobia and Panic Disorder Studies\n\nSomatoform Disorder Studies\n\nClinical Applications\n\nGetting Past Your Past: Take Control of Your Life with Self-Help Techniques from EMDR Therapy\n\nEye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) Therapy-Third Edition\n\nHandbook of EMDR and Family Therapy Processes\n\nEMDR as an Integrative Psychotherapy Approach\n\nThe EMDR Institute stands as the foundational training organization, deeply rooted in Dr. Shapiro's original vision, a construct of rigorous research, and a forward-looking hope for healing and personal growth. Despite Dr. Shapiro's passing, her legacy endures through the Institute's work.\n\nWe are committed to harmonizing cutting-edge research and fresh perspectives with unwavering fidelity to her mission. Our focus remains steadfast on our core purpose: to serve and facilitate healing in others.\n\n— April Minjarez, Facilitator\n\nHands down, it is the gold standard. The Institute has been a solid institution dedicated to healing the world.
