Graphic designer Lani Headley took inspiration from such labels to create artwork representing some of the best things about the county. In Journal of a Novel, Steinbeck reasoned that âIt is a strange feeling to be taking people who are close to me apart and putting them on paper. But I see no reason why I should not. They are mine and I can do what I like with them.â In reading the selections inside this publication, you might find reason to disagree with our readers. Similarly, Steinbeckâs work was not always met with universal acclaim. These are their decisions, and they can vote as they please. You might also notice a theme as you read. Steinbeck provided us with a trove of material to draw on as we assembled the 2023 edition of The Best of Monterey County. Were we all familiar with the dozens of books he wrote or the details of his life when we started? Hardly. But we learned along the way. Inside these pages, you will learn what our readers believe to be the countyâs best. We hope it serves as a fun and inspiring guide. Preface By Dave Faries It is said that by the time John Steinbeck finished the manuscript that would become East of Eden, he had worn more than 300 pencils down to the nub. Well, probably not that far. Steinbeck was rather particular about his pencils and tossed them when they had worn down to a certain length. By some accounts, the famed author and Salinas native sharpened 60 pencils each day he sat down to write. Since it took him a year to finish East of Eden, the 300 figure seems low. But itâs a handy number, at least as far as weâre concerned. The Best of Monterey County is a compilation of over 300 descriptions of the regionâs favorite people, places, things andâ¦well, letâs just remain in the literary world and say nouns. Of the Best Of write-ups included in this issue, 266 are regular categories, voted on by our readers. The final section is reserved for Weekly staffers.

In his time, there were just dribbles of aid from charities. But when the organization providing aid is Meals on Wheels of the Monterey Peninsula, you can be sure that help is on the way. Last years, its 250 volunteer drivers delivered 276,000 meals around their service areaâmeals prepared by a team of cooks, providing breakfast, lunch and dinner. They also offer group dining in the Community Center, as well as recreational and social activitesâagain through the support of volunteers. Steinbeck would have been impressed. Best Local Do-Gooder Elsa Rivera bigsurfoodandwine.org Seemingly wherever you go in Monterey County, Elsa Rivera is there. Mostly, sheâs behind the scenes, orchestrating creative events that support charitable causesâthings like the Big Sur Fashion Show (executive director) or Big Sur Food and Wine Festival (CFO and events director). Sometimes sheâs on the stage as an emcee, a role the dancer has leaned into since a knee injury. âI love uplifting peopleâs talents,â she says. âArt is essentialâwe need it for our souls.â Other volunteer roles include serving on the boards of the Monterey Bay Jade Festival and GI Josie, where she introduced the Blue Water Project to support surf therapy for women recovering from PTSD. Rivera also helped grow pandemic relief efforts The Big Share and ALL-IN Monterey. In short, giving back is built into her daily life. âI believe we make time for anything we want to do,â she says. âI think not having time is a lame excuse. We can always make time for things we love.â Best Local Nonprofit Best Place to Take Visitors Monterey Bay Aquarium 886 Cannery Row, Monterey (831) 648-4800, montereybayaquarium. org Ed Ricketts, Steinbeckâs best friend and the model for the character Doc in Cannery Row, would be amazed that a neighbor to his famed Pacific Biological Laboratoriesâa compact wooden building where he stored and researched his marine animal finds from Monterey Bay and Pacific Ocean from 1936 until his untimely death in 1948âis today the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The Aquarium takes the storage and study of those animals to a level beyond what Ricketts might have imagined. Since 1984 the Aquarium has been one of the top aquariums in the world, and along with its research arm, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, has been facilitating important discoveries and bringing them to millions of visitors. The newest exhibit, Into the Deep, was made possible using a remotely operated vehicle, named appropriately the ROV Doc Ricketts. If you and your visitors havenât seen the exhibit, itâs a good reason to return. And with a mission to inspire conservation of the worldâs oceans, the Aquarium remains one of the leading nonprofit organizations anywhere. Best Radio Station 101.7 FM, KCDu The Beach 80 Garden Court, Monterey (831) 658-6200, 1017thebeach.com If a song is hot, The Beach has it on the playlistââMinnie The Moocher,â âIn the Mood,â Wabash Cannonba... Woops! Wrong era. Instead, think Olivia Rodrigo, Dua Lipa, SZA, Harry Styles, Taylor Swift and all the current hits. On-air talents like JoJo Lopez, Tommy Del Rio, Fredo and Tino Cochino set the soundtrack of now, making every day lively. Plus, you can score some great concert tickets from their contests. Best Radio DJ Jeff White KRML, 94.7 FM 27300 Rancho San Carlos Road, Carmel (831) 620-7374, krml.com Between music, general wisdom and a devotion to surfing, the tides and the nonprofit organization Surfrider, Jeff White sets a unique tone that clearly resonates with listeners. Every morning on KRML he lays down information that is useful and helps people stay in the know. Best of all, best College Professor | Enid Ryce\n\n14 BEST OF MONTEREY COUNTY® 2023 mcweekly.com/bestof around town Whiteâs delivery is not from on high, but as a friend. Heâs conversationalâa DJ of the peopleâGeorge would have been listening in the bunkhouse. You can also find him every Wednesday evening indulging fresh brewed hops at one of the now four Alvarado Street Brewing pubs during the eponymous talk show âPub Talk,â featuring voices from the community. Best School CSu Monterey Bay 5108 Fourth Ave., Marina (831) 582-3000, csumb.edu In Steinbeckâs Monterey County, soldiers were a constant presence; a couple of them have a cameo in Cannery Row. But Fort Ord was decommissioned, and in a perfect swords-into-plowshares evolution, in its place came CSU Monterey Bay. The university is often recognized for its service to the area. In fact, itâs a graduation requirement that students get involved in community projects, exploring subjects like social justice, social responsibility and diversity. This year, CSUMB climbed 224 places in Forbesâ college rankings, and now ranks 119th for affordability and student advancement. Best K-12 Teacher Imogen Erickson Pacific Grove High School 615 Sunset Drive, Pacific Grove (831) 646-6590, pgusd.org John Steinbeck made pozole with a can of chili and a can of hominy. Thank God he was a writer and not a chef. But his talents would certainly have improved if Imogen Ericksonâa chef and culinary arts teacher at Pacific Grove High Schoolâhad given Best Place For A Birthday Party | MY Museum\n\nVOTED BEST PLACE TO VOLUNTEER mcweekly.com/bestof BEST OF MONTEREY COUNTY® 2023 15\n\naround town him instruction. Erickson says cooking âis a skill for life.â The best part, she says, is that her students also learn about other subjects along the way, including chemistry, physics, cultural anthropology, math and more. âTheir learning is supported by what weâre learning in the kitchen,â Erickson says. BEST COLLEGE TEAM Hartnell Women's Soccer Team Hartnell College 411 Central Ave., Salinas (831) 755-6700, hartnell.edu âSectional football games have the glory and the despair of war,â John Steinbeck noted. Likely he was talking about American football, not soccer. But thatâs how the rest of the world knows it. The ferocious Panthers have played solidly over the past couple of years, and itâs a strength that has been built by head coach Ivan Guerrero for over a decade. Two years ago, the team won its first state championship. Last year they made it to the second round of playoffs. These felines are no longer strays, but serious house cats any opponent has to be cautious with. BEST COLLEGE PROFESSOR Enid Baxter Ryce CSU Monterey Bay 5108 Fourth Ave., Marina (831) 582-3126, csumb.edu âI have come to believe that a great teacher is a great artist,â John Steinbeck observed. How true. Thatâs why he is a revered writer. And thatâs why Enid Baxter Ryce is a revered instructor. Ryceâs lectures in the Cinematic Arts & Technology Department and the Arts, Humanities & Social Science Department arenât just a class, but an experience. Her students go out of the classroom, work with their hands and collaborate with others. Ryce says her goal is to make her classes relevant to students and their personal goals. Beyond cultivating creativity, they work on real projects for institutions like NASA, National Geographic and museumsâ experiences they add to their resumes. BEST PLACE TO WORK Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula 23625 Highway 68, Monterey (831) 624-5311, montagehealth.org Weâre a little biased at the Weekly, because itâs a really good place to work. But CHOMPâthe wonderful acronym for Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsulaâclearly has us beat. Besides a healthy environment and good benefits, the Montage Health facility offers perks such as a great cafeteria serving the best milkshakes in the entire county (see Specialty Foods for proof). Thatâs why the doctors and nurses we depend on stay on, year after year. So CHOMP being the best place to work is good for all of us. BEST LOCAL POLITICIAN Jimmy Panetta 1200 Aguajito Road, Monterey (831) 424-2229, panetta.house.gov When the newly elected Congressman Jimmy Panetta went to Washington in 2017, he entered a ferment: Donald Trump, also newly elected, had turned the GOP establishment upside down, a trend that has continued. Yet Panetta entered into that fray with the hope, if not conviction, that he could get legislation done by reaching across the aisle to his GOP colleagues. Itâs the same mentality that Joe Biden has brought to his presidency, as Biden has 16 BEST OF MONTEREY COUNTY® 2023 mcweekly.com/bestof â22 â23\n\nmcweekly.com/bestof BEST OF MONTEREY COUNTY® 2023 17 Thank you, readers of The Monterey County Weekly, for voting California State University, Monterey Bay as âBest Schoolâ! csumb.edu 1192672711 Best of Monterey MCWeekly 9.38x4.94 Ad 23 01.indd 1 9/1/23 1:41 PM VOTED #1 BEST PLACE TO HAVE A BIRTHDAY PARTY 2023 425 Washington Street, Monterey, CA 93940 MY Museum 831.649.6444 mymuseum.org Thank you for voting us Best Boutique Fitness Studio carmelbarre.com 3730 The Barnyard, Suite G-21, Carmel P M (831)238-9766 â23 Locally Grown.

BEST LOCAL BLOG BEST LOCAL WEBSITE Monterey County Weekly 668 Williams Ave., Seaside (831) 394-5656, mcweekly.com Just like the 2020 presidential election, the Monterey County Weekly winning for Best Local Blog and Best Local Website did not involve election interference, voter suppression or fraud. The only ones crazy enough to falsely claim these shenanigans currently have their hands full in the courts of Georgia, New York and Washington, D.C. John Steinbeckâ just like usâstarted as a journalist, reporting on migrant workers for the San Francisco News, and reporting on World War II for the New York Herald Tribune. Thank you for trusting us as your go-to for community information, from entertainment to breaking news. BEST CLERGY Dr. Bill Little Center for Spiritual Awakening 522 Central Ave., Pacific Grove (831) 372-1942, centerforspiritualawakening.org To a God unknown? Hardly. Dr. Bill Little is a frequent flier in the Best Of Readersâ Poll. Unique to Dr. Littleâs tenure among the winners of this poll is the fact that he has won in two rather disparate categoriesâBest Professor and Best Clergy. Dr. Little has led the Center for Spiritual Awakening since 1976, and offers talks on a diverse range of topics. But all of them are designed to help answer the biggest questions of all: What will awaken you spiritually? BEST BUSINESS SIGN Other Brother Beer Co. 877 Broadway Ave., Seaside (831) 747-1106, otherbrotherbeer.com Doc would often leave his lab on Cannery Row and head to Alvarado Street for a beer. This was, of course, many decades before Other Brother Beer Co. opened in Seaside under a painted sign reminiscent of the 1930sâsuggesting establishment and longevity, yet with a modern appeal. It does not intrude, itâs simply part of the place. The sign leaves no doubt that Other Brother belongs to the neighborhood and that people gravitate to the brewpub. BEST NEON SIGN Dust Bowl Brewing 290 Figueroa St., Monterey (831) 641-7002, dustbowlbrewing.com It was on May 8, 1948 when Ed RickettsâSteinbeckâs best friendâdied while driving across the train tracks at Drake Avenue in Monterey after a Del Monte Express passenger train smashed into his vehicle. He was only 50. That rail line, which started service in 1889, took its last ride in 1971, and in the 1980s, the City of Monterey converted the tracks into the Rec Trail, a regional treasure. The former depot of the Monterey stop now houses a Dust Bowl Brewing taproom, and its neon sign shines out toward Del Monte Avenue, announcing its presence to the passersby and visitors as a gathering place for locals and tourists alike in a spot that holds a place in Monterey history. Beyond that, Steinbeckâs most celebrated novel, Grapes of Wrath, followed Okies from the Dust Bowl to California, where they tried to make a new life. Dust Bowl Brewing followed them. mcweekly.com/bestof BEST OF MONTEREY COUNTY® 2023 19 Thank you to the readers of the Monterey County Weekly! â23\n\n20 BEST OF MONTEREY COUNTY® 2023 mcweekly.com/bestof around town Best Place To Drink Next To A Celebrity Mission Ranch 26270 Dolores St., Carmel (831) 624-6436, missionranchcarmel.com At one point in time it would have been possible to sit next to Steinbeck in a Monterey bar. Ed RickettsâDoc from Cannery Rowâliked to visit Alvarado Street establishments, but his lab was truly happening. Gabe Bicknell (famous as Mack) might have frequented La Ida. The point is, hobnobbing with celebrities is something that makes everyone a little giddy, and Monterey County is no stranger to some of the worldâs more famous clientele. These days, Mission Ranch is a star in its own right among readers in the know. Maybe itâs the drool-worthy food selection for both pre and post cocktails, or maybe itâs the ever present chance that you might run into Bill Murray or Justin Timberlake. Best Hotel Bernardus Lodge & Spa 415 W. Carmel Valley Road, Carmel Valley (831) 658-3400, bernarduslodge.com Most hotels have pools. Bernardus has an infinity jacuzzi to go along with a pool, hot tub and other pleasures. Each room has a soaking tub for twoâas well as fireplaces and goose down comforters. So thereâs no real need to leave your exquisite villaâ¦except that there are gardens to roam, a bocce and croquet lawn for elevated activity, the finest craft cocktails and a memorable restaurant. And the service? Impeccable. And Bernardus is dog-friendly. So if youâve been traveling around the country in a pickup with Charley in tow and need a respiteâand you happen to be a famous author with the means, Bernardus is clearly the best. Best Local Event/ Festival AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am Pebble Beach Golf Links, 1700 17 Mile Drive, Pebble Beach (831) 649-1533, attpbgolf.com Imagine a pairing of Rory McIlroy, Jordan Speith, Bill Murray and John Steinbeck. Yeah, yeahâcouldnât happen. Besides, Steinbeck had a wicked slice and was woeful with the putter. But the annual PGA Tour stop is unlike any other because it brings celebrity starpower together with golfâs finest, so itâs possible to see top authors playing alongside tour pros. The format changes in 2024, but the celebrity draw remains. Ohâthe remarks about Steinbeckâs golf game? A bit of fiction. Best Place To See & Be Seen Best Farmers Market Old Monterey Marketplace and Farmers Market Alvarado Street, Monterey (831) 655-2607, oldmonterey.org On Tuesday afternoons, with all due respect to Soledad, itâs happening on Alvarado Street in Old Monterey. Packed with produce, flowers, cakes and crafts, this weekly eventâwith its three blocks of local vendorsâfeels more like a festival than a farmers market. And with its happy hour schedule (4-7pm every Tuesday), this market draws folks of all ages from all walks of life. Itâs people watching, with a lot of distractions. Mack and the boys could have easily stocked up at a market like this. But we donât condone five-finger discounts. Best Place to Read the Weekly Alta Bakery 502 Munras Ave., Monterey (831) 920-1018, altamonterey.com Montereyâs Alta Bakery is very popular. Itâs deserved popularityâthe bakery boasts delicious baked goods and innovative coffee drinks and a hearty lunch menu. Itâs also great news for the business. That said, it is slightly less good news for us patronsâAltaâs popularity leads to long lines on virtually any given day. Hereâs an idea for how to make line time fly by: Read the Weekly. Weâll bet you can make a pretty good dent in the news section, or plan your weekend with our Hot Picks, while you wait. And once you place your order, head out back to the Cooper Molera Adobe gardens to enjoy the features at a more leisurely pace.

Clarissa continues to works tirelessly for her clients and the community which makes this award so deserving. She has worked on the Monterey Peninsula in the banking industry for over 30 years as a Branch Manager and has found her perfect fit as VP of Community Relations for Monterey County Bank. She continues to serve on the Boards of Carmel, Pacific Grove and Monterey Peninsula Chamber of Commerceâs.

Stand on the edge of the Pacific, looking out over the Monterey Bay, and embark on a new chapter. The ceremony space (maximum 100 people) can be reserved for very reasonable per-hour rates (especially if you happen to be a Pacific Grove resident), and your guests will enjoy fresh sea air and the sound of the crashing waves while you celebrate. Love is in the airâand right in the name. BEST PLACE FOR A BIRTHDAY PARTY MY Museum 425 Washington St., Monterey (831) 649-6444, mymuseum.org It is said that âa party hardly ever goes the way it is planned or intended.â And the thought has some weight to it, since it was Steinbeck who pointed it out. Howeverâand itâs a big howeverâ the potential for chaos is muted by the right venue. MY Museum is the perfect place to host a birthday party for a youngster. For one thing, you donât need additional decorations. And itâs versatile, in that MY Museum can host small or larger gatherings. And both kids and adults love the place. So party on, because it will go as intended. BEST PLACE TO EAVESDROP vesuvio 6th and Junipero, Carmel (831) 625-1766, chefpepe.com/restaurants/vesuvio Oh, the stories you may hear. Part of what made Steinbeck such a great writer was his ability to hearâand not just stories. He could pick up on inflections and character. That Aperol spritz says something about the couple at the next table. But hereâs the problem. This is seriously good pizza and pasta, so you donât want to be distracted by the stumbling conversation of first dates or those recounting celebrity sighting. But it is good listen. And youâll probably want to retell the story in some way. BEST PUBLIC GOLF COURSE Pacific Grove Golf Links 77 Asilomar Blvd., Pacific Grove (831) 648-5775, playpacificgrove.com As John Steinbeck noted, âPacific Grove benefits by one of those happy accidents of nature that gladden the heart, excite the imagination, and instruct the young.â Weâre guessing that his observation referred to Pacific Grove Golf Links, which takes full advantage of the crashing waves and rugged dunes to create a golf experience rivaled only by the storied courses of Pebble Beachâon a Tom Joad budget. In fact, the course is often referred to as the poor personâs Pebble Beach, something Steinbeck would appreciate. And the bar to complete the 19th hole experience is pretty swell, too. BEST SURF SPOT Asilomar State Beach Along Sunset Drive, Pacific Grove (831) 646-6440, parks.ca.gov John Steinbeck was a skilled sailor attuned to the machinations of tides and swells, just like modern-day surfers. When the surf is small, Asilomar is great for learning to paddle through the whitewater and to attempt standing up. When the surf gets bigger, finding a channel to paddle through is a challenge unto itself for experienced surfers aiming to get outside to catch peaks for open-faced rides. On the biggest of big days when the beach break is closing out, the outer reef might wake up where 30- to 50-foot waves have been ridden. Even if you donât surf, watching surfers walk on water is peak people watching. 22 BEST OF MONTEREY COUNTY® 2023 mcweekly.com/bestof Book now at EscapeRoom831.com Lighthouse 599 Lighthouse Avenue, Monterey 831.241.6616 Wave Street 765 Wave Street, Suite A2, Monterey 831.324.0513 AND FROM THE MAKERS OF ESCAPE ROOM 831 ARCADE Â LOUNGE Â ESCAPE ROOMS Â SKEE BALL Â EVENTS 685 Cannery Row, 3rd Floor, Monterey 831.241.6616 OSCARSPLAYGROUND.COM NOW OPEN!

It faces west, for a perfect angle on the sunset. Itâs roughly a mile long, inviting pooches to run free, and their humans to walk or jog alongside and spread out. Itâs a place to play volleyball or catch a wave or just relax and gaze out at the deep blue sea. Itâs also a place to observe the power of nature. Return throughout the year and watch the beach change as winter swells carry sand away, exposing sandstone formations, then pile up that iconic white sand again in summer. Carmel Beach can be many things to many people, and in all of those ways, itâs the best. BEST HIKING TRAIL BEST PARK Point Lobos State Natural Reserve 2 miles south of Rio Road on Highway 1, Carmel (831) 624-4909, parks.ca.gov/pointlobos If youâre a local who regularly finds yourself driving by Point Lobos, youâd be forgiven for wondering whether the park has become overrated. Itâs packed virtually daily (but especially on weekends and holidays), with cars lining Highway 1 near the entrance. But the truth is that hairy parking situation or not, Point Lobos is magical. Gaze out at the turquoise water from China Cove, visit with gorgeous old cypress trees and climb to Whalerâs Knoll and watch for whale spouts in the distance. Youâll be glad you came. BEST PLACE TO BIKE / MOUNTAIN BIKE Fort Ord National Monument Various entrances; Regional BLM office at 940 2nd Ave., Marina (831) 582-2200, blm.gov/programs/ national-conservation-lands/california/ fort-ord-national-monument Who would have thought, back in the 1980s, say, that Fort Ordâan Army post and training area owned by the federal government since 1917âwould later become one of the worldâs preeminent destinations for riding bikes? Life is unpredictable. And Fort Ord is unlike any other place: a vast expanse of oak woodlands, draped by lichen, and rolling hills of maritime chaparral now filled with trails perfect for those on two wheels to roll through and experience the majesty of the landscape. The hills arenât steep, the views can be epic, and when youâre riding a bike, the place just feels like a playground. Itâs easy to fall into taking the places you live for granted, but Fort Ord, when youâre rolling through it, reminds you that we live in a very special place. BEST LIBRARY Monterey Public Library 625 Pacific St., Monterey (831) 646-3933, monterey.org/library Before Al Gore invented the internet, people often had to leave their caves and go to libraries to do research and find books.

The library has everything: kidâs books, a vast collection of fiction and nonfiction, internet access, great resources for research and, despite how many people are there, peace and quiet. BEST HANGOUT FOR TEENS Del Monte Shopping Center 1410 Del Monte Center, Monterey (831) 373-2705, delmontecenter.com Where else would teens spend a day with friends, the Palace Flophouse? Not a good idea. Instead, they gather at Del Monte Shopping Center. Why? Chipotle, J.Jill, the Apple Store, pizza, ice cream, clothing stores, a multiscreen theater playing the must-see movies, the math learning centerâ¦just wanted to see if you were still paying attention. But there is a math learning center, as well as dozens of shops, restaurants, even a gym. Thatâs a lot to Instagram. BEST HANGOUT FOR SENIORS Carmel Foundation Corner of 8th and Lincoln, Carmel (831) 624-1588, carmelfoundation.org John Steinbeck died at the age of 66, which means he didnât get to experience the fruits of the golden years that seniors enjoy today. No better place to enjoy oneself toward the end of lifeâs âback-9â than at the Carmel Foundation. Surrounding oneself with contemporaries and having a full schedule has been shown to prolong life, and the staff here pack it in. From movie nights to field trips to classes, members will always stay engaged. For those needing advanced care, the Carmel Foundation offers services including medical, meal delivery and other in-home support services. BEST SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITY Canterbury Woods 651 Sinex Ave., Pacific Grove (831) 373-3111, covia.org/canterbury-woods This is the third year in a row that Canterbury Woods has been voted readersâ favorite senior living community. Itâs not a surprise to the staff and residents of Canterbury Woods, where some of todayâs residents are the children of past residents and staff members remain working there for decades, says Executive Director Elvyra Abare. Children of employees have been known to follow in their parentsâ footsteps and come to work at Canterbury Woods themselves as adults. âThe reputation of Canterbury Woods is really what itâs all about,â Abare says. Part of that reputation includes staff listening and working collaboratively with residents. Residents feel like contributing members of the community âand their voice will be heard,â Abare adds. Thereâs a robust residentsâ council supported by a variety of committees that keep residents engaged and happy to live in a supportive community. 26 BEST OF MONTEREY COUNTY® 2023 mcweekly.com/bestof Thank you, KRML listeners, and MC Weekly readers, for voting Jeff White as the Best DJ in Monterey County.

It shouldnât come as a surprise that Monterey Countyâs Best Late Night Hangout is home to, and the brainchild of, its Best Bartender. From its name to its live jazz, drag and burlesque nights, Pearl Hour is Katie Blandinâs love letter to Monterey. Sheâs created a space and a vibe that is wholly distinct (and desperately needed) around these partsâwhile also happening to serve a delectable cocktail menu thatâs unparalleled anywhere in the county, if not the entire Central Coast. Donât think mezcal and gin can go together? Try the Pearlescentâyou wonât regret it. Best Bar For Baby Boomers Mission Ranch 26270 Dolores St., Carmel (831) 625-9040, missionranchcarmel. com The bar at Mission Ranch has it allâ pastoral views of sheep grazing, with Point Lobos and the Pacific Ocean beyond. A wine list featuring a range of local wines. A menu of small bites for when you start to feel peckish after that second glass (there are so many good wines to choose from). Nightly piano music sets the mood, so settle in and order a Jack Roseâitâs what Steinbeck would do. Best Bar For Gen Xers Best Bar For Millennials Alvarado Street Brewery 426 Alvarado St., Monterey, (831) 6552337 Carmel Plaza, Suite, Ocean Avenue and Mission Street, Carmel, (831) 293-8621 301 Main St., Salinas, (831) 356-219 Tasting room at 1315 Dayton St., Salinas (831) 800-3332, asb.beer Canât keep track of where Gen X ends and Millennials begin? Thatâs OK, neither can we. But what we can be sure of is that Alvarado Street Brewery is the place to find both generations imbibing and dining together in harmony. Itâs more than your standard bar. Would an ordinary pub have smoked salmon pizza or crispy burrata salad? Would the common hangout include dozens of beer selections alone featuring Monterey Countyinspired names like âBixby Blondeâ and âChillâd Out: Ocean Waterâ? An impressive selection of local wines and signature cocktails round out the options to make for our readersâ favorite multi-generational watering hole. Best Drink With A View Schooners Monterey Plaza Hotel, 400 Cannery Row, Monterey (831) 372-2628, schoonersmonterey.com Thereâs no problem with emphasizing just the drink here, even if you end up seated with your back to the view. The signature cocktails are strong and fresh, and play up the oceanfront settingâthe Eden of Edgewater features cucumber vodka, cucumber juice and elderflower, or the Purse Seiner has gin, lime and fresh ginger. But whatâs extra special is that those drinks are served on a perch over the kelp beds off Cannery Row, providing an excellent vantage point to watch otters, seals and seabirds. Or look further out at the horizon. Or focus even more closely on the invertebrates, like sea stars visible on a clear day, and think about pioneering marine biologist Ed Ricketts, gathering specimens just a few doors down. From micro to macro, the view delivers. Best Neighborhood Bar Other Brother Beer Co. 877 Broadway Ave., Seaside (831) 747-1106, otherbrotherbeer.com Thereâs something different about this place. Perhaps thatâs why itâs the âotherâ brother. What that means in this case is, unlike a lot of watering holes on the Monterey Peninsula that fill up with tourists (not a bad thing), Other Brother is a place where one can almost always find a table, and even if everyone doesnât know your name arts and entertainment Jimi Hendrix image: Ed Caraeff / Iconic Images Best Pub | Crown & Anchor\n\n30 BEST OF MONTEREY COUNTY® 2023 mcweekly.com/bestof arts and entertainment (or, more likely, even if no one knows your name), it has a vibe that feels like home. Its capacious interior with high ceilings gives the spot an airy feel, and the garage-door-style sliding windows bordering the sidewalk are usually open when the weather ainât foul. And by the sidewalk, thereâs a parklet that makes for some great people- and car-watching while hanging with your besties. And did we forget to mention that the beer is really good? Itâs no surprise Other Brother wins in this category. No-brainer. Best Place For Day-Drinking Dust Bowl Brewing Co. 290 Figueroa St., Monterey (831) 641-7002, dustbowlbrewing.com When John Steinbeck was alive and moving through the world, as writers do, there was a train that traveled from Pebble Beach to San Francisco, the Del Monte Express, which had its last run in the 1970s. Among the stops was a station in Monterey, on the Rec Trail near Fishermanâs Wharf, which has finally found the best reuse of the spot: Itâs home to a Dust Bowl Brewing Co. taproom, and its outdoor patio, right along the Rec Trail, is blessed with salt air and, on a good day, plenty of sunshine. Not to mention the beer is excellent, as are the offerings from adjacent Wedoâs food truck. And the passersby traffic on the Rec Trail makes it a top-notch spot in the countyâmaybe the bestâto watch people. And thatâs just what Steinbeck did. Best Bar For Darts Bulldog Sports Pub 611 Lighthouse Ave., Monterey (831) 658-0686, bulldogsportspub.com A long-time institution in New Monterey, the Bulldog has always been a localsâ favorite. After a recent renovation, the bright, clean, open space shines with TVs everywhere so you donât miss a moment of the action. The Bulldog offers karaoke, trivia and live music throughout the week. If youâve got a hankering to throw darts with your palsâor make a new friend to play withâhead on down, order a beer and pick a board. Best Happy Hour Hula's Island Grill 622 Lighthouse Ave., Monterey (831) 655-4852, hulastiki.com A great crowd, fun drinks, discounts, a 60-minute time limitâthese are common happy hour traits. What sets Hulaâs apart is their dedication to happy hour. To begin with, it lasts an hour and a half, from 4-5:30pm. And they host it seven days a week. But it only gets better on Tiki Tuesday, when Hulaâs breaks all the rules and extends happy hour all night long. Thatâs rightâ tiki drinks until the moon is down. Best Pub Crown & Anchor 150 W. Franklin St., Monterey (831) 649-6496, crownandanchor.net The only thing better than Sunday funday is sweet Thursday. Fortunately, for Monterey County residents, The Crown & Anchor is open on both of themâand the other days, too. This authentic British pub affectionately known to locals as âThe Crankerâ is celebrating its 20th year being voted Best Pub in Monterey County. Whether itâs the beer, the British fare, or the one-liners delivered by owner Tony Sutton Deakin, Crown & Anchor would certainly meet the approval of Old Jingleballicks himself, to whom Deakin mightâve said, âYou will be a stranger here but once.â Best Place To Shoot Pool Easy Street Billiards 511 Tyler St., Monterey (831) 333-0825, montereybilliards.com Like drive-in movie theaters and bowling alleys, pool halls have all but disappeared.

BEST CLUB FOR ROCK Salty Seal Brewpub & Sports Bar 653 Cannery Row, Monterey (831) 920-2327, saltysealpub.com Rock and roll often reveals the masks we wear during our normal, boring lives, and invites us to exit for a moment and be honest. The happening club (and former brothel in the old Bear Flag building) invites local rockers to dance the night away with two full bars, a restaurant, darts, pool, and foosball accompanying a jukebox. Check the rotating lineup of live music and linger (or dance) depending on your mood. BEST CLUB FOR JAZZ Cibo Ristorante Italiano 301 Alvarado St., Monterey (831) 649-8151, cibo.com Three simple words are etched on the wall of Cibo: âCocktails, Dinner, Jazz.â Itâs from Steinbeckâs The Moon Is Down, a tale of nightlife inâ¦nah! Weâve never even read The Moon Is Down. But these words tell you that this is a place where good times are to be had, and in appreciation. Windows blue as the cool, sultry tunes of Glenn Miller or Charles Mingus and a bar that somehow reminisces the ocean as a smooth character will greet you at this long-time classic jazz clubâa staple of Monterey County. You can find great local jazz musicians at this groovy venue playing on Wednesday nights to accompany your dinner, followed by revelry on the weekends with a nearly-packed bar open until 2am. BEST BLUES CLUB Deja Blue 500 Broadway Ave., Seaside (831) 324-0044, dejabluelive.com With his novel The Grapes of Wrath, John Steinbeck painted a truly dire portrait of scores of people hoping to remove themselves from the calamity that was the Dust Bowl, a series of severe dust storms over the drought-stricken southern plains of the U.S. during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Hopefully no one reading this has the blues on such a big scale as that, but the blues do come in all shapes and sizes. If that resonates with you, head on over to this big-time blues, jazz and comedy club for some real relief via solid live blues and other music, great cocktails and a soul food menu including braised oxtail, jalapeño hushpuppies and shrimp, grits and eggs to set things just right. BEST PLACE FOR COMEDY Golden State Theatre 417 Alvarado St., Monterey (831) 649-1070, goldenstatetheatre.com In three years, Golden State Theatre in Monterey will be 100 years old, and that by itself is impressive. Built as a Castilian castle in 1926, a time when Steinbeck was an unknown, it was supposed to be a fancy venue that could be attended by the masses. Once the largest theater between San Francisco and Los Angeles, it had 1,600 seats, which means that back then it could have entertained onethird of the city (population 6,000). These days you have to fight for tickets to go experience a night of laughter. Big stars like Jerry Seinfeld, Jay Leno, Paula Poundstone and Al Franken have made local audiences laugh here. It is also a wonderful venue for small concerts by bigtime artists such as Patti Smith, the Pixies and Macy Gray. 32 BEST OF MONTEREY COUNTY® 2023 mcweekly.com/bestof FINEART ARCHIVES PUBLISHING CREATIVE Let your walls tell a storyâ¦ Visit our gallery on-line to see the best in fine-art photography. iconicimagesgallery.com The hills are alive, with the sound of...
