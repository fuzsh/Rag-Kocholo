For more than 30 years, the Center operated almost entirely on the generosity of community volunteers who offered assistance to those in need and a place to find community. Over the last decade, the Center developed more robust programs and services to meet those needs, hired professional staff, and engaged significant public and private funding to support the community.\n\nNow, the Sacramento LGBT Community Center has become one of the region’s largest nonprofits, reaching more LGBTQ+ people than any organization in Northern California. Operating in four locations, the Center provides programs and services spanning three broad categories: Health and Wellness, Advocacy, and Community Building.\n\nHealth and wellness services include HIV/STD Testing and Prevention, PrEP Navigation, Counseling Services, Sexual Health Education, Gender Affirming Care Services, Harm Reduction, Medication Assisted Treatment navigation (MAT), Support Groups, and more.\n\nThe Center’s Q-Spot Youth Program offers a brave space for youth ages 13-24 to receive social and emotional support through mental health respite, peer mentorship, and support groups. The Q-Spot also offers life skills workshops, youth-centered advocacy, and events such as Q-Prom.\n\nThe Center’s housing services include homelessness prevention, a 14-bed Short-term Transitional Emergency Program (STEP) 90-day low-barrier youth shelter, and a six-bed Transitional Living Program (TLP) where clients can stay for up to 24 months as they prepare for independent self-reliant living, and transition to more permanent housing. Both programs serve 18–24-year-old youth and include case management, housing, meals, clothing, transportation assistance, and access to wrap-around services including counseling, education and employment assistance, life skills workshops, and the establishment of a support system that can be maintained upon exiting the program.\n\nIn addition to providing a safe haven, the Center serves as an advocate for equity and social justice. Advocacy programs include legal aid through community partnerships, support services for community members who have been victims of bias or hate-related incidents, an outreach and training institute, Queer Voices (a performance-based ensemble), and public policy and community organizing.\n\nThe Center is host to various community-building initiatives including the annual Sacramento Pride Festival & March, Q-Prom (a fun-filled evening for LGBTQ+ youth and allies), and Mama’s Makin’ Bacon Drag Brunch (the largest drag brunch extravaganza in Sacramento), Chosen Family Feast (a shared community meal on Thanksgiving), World Aids Day, and dozens of others throughout the year.\n\nThe Mission\n\nThe Center works to create a region where all LGBTQ+ people thrive; we support health and wellness, advocate for equity and justice, and work to uplift our diverse and culturally rich LGBTQ+ community.\n\nOrganizational Highlights\n\nFounded: 1978\n\nRevenue: $6.5 million\n\nBoard of Directors: 21 seats, 13 currently filled\n\nStaff: 54 FTEs\n\nHeadquarters: Sacramento, CA\n\nWebsites: saccenter.org and sacramentopride.org\n\nThe Position\n\nReporting to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and serving as a key partner on the Senior Leadership Team, the Chief Operating Officer (COO) is a strategic and visionary operations and finance leader for a rapidly growing agency.
