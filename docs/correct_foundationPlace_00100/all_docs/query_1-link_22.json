In February 2008, the FDA issued an advisory recommending that primary processors avoid purchasing hogfish, grouper, and snapper species captured within 10 miles of the sanctuary, and amberjack, barracuda and other pelagic species captured within 50 miles of the sanctuary. This advisory was reissued in November 2013.",

        "text": "Human Health\n\nMonterey Bay\n\nWhy is it a concern?\n\nOffshore, nearshore, and estuarine environments in Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary have all been impacted by contaminants. Although the majority of the sanctuary’s nearshore waters generally do not pose risks to human health, there are localized areas and isolated impacts that periodically pose serious health risks. Because toxins (domoic acid and paralytic shellfish poison) produced by certain algal species have been found at levels in Monterey Bay that are potentially harmful to human health, and an annual statewide mussel quarantine is issued from May 1 to October 31 by the California Department of Public Health. Periodic beach warnings and closures, due to the presence of pathogen indicators (E. coli, fecal coliform, total coliform, Enterococcus), are common at some locations.\n\nOther chemical contaminants found in the tissues of nearshore animals, and in some cases exceeding health standards, include DDT, PAHs, PCBs, arsenic, mercury, chlordanes, butyltins, and copper. Problem areas for metals and/or persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are at Elkhorn Slough, Moss Landing, Pacific Grove, and Santa Cruz Point. Approximately a third of the sanctuary sites sampled are categorized as high relative to all other U.S. sites for metals and/or POPs.\n\nTo improve time lags for posting closures and reopening beaches, research is needed to develop faster, reliable new methods of indicator bio-assessment, to investigate the use of indicator compounds other than coliform bacteria (e.g., fecal sterols, caffeine, long-chain alkylbenzenes), and to determine ways to distinguish between animal and anthropogenic sources of contamination (e.g., RNA ribotyping). In addition, a poor understanding of the dynamics of harmful algal blooms affects the ability to control causal mechanisms and reduce impacts. Research is needed to distinguish human from natural influences that appear to be resulting in increased frequency and duration of outbreaks, particularly among strains of algae not recognized on the west coast until the early 1990s.\n\nOverview of Research\n\nResearch conducted by Sanctuary scientists and partners provides critical information to address existing and emerging resource conservation and management issues. The Overview of Research highlights some, but not necessarily all, of the research activities completed or ongoing at the Sanctuary.\n\nScience Needs and Questions\n\nCan compounds other than coliform bacteria (e.g., fecal sterols, caffeine, long-chain alkylbenzenes) be detected rapidly, and do they accurately indicate the presence of pathogens?\n\nDo these methods have the speed to meet recreational users' needs, and the specificity to meet state water quality standards?\n\nCan disease-causing pathogens be directly tested as an alternative to using indicators?\n\nWhat systems are available to present real-time information on beach status to the public?\n\nAre there other pollutants associated with indicator bacteria such as endocrine disruptors and other pharmaceuticals, and what are their effects to nearshore organisms?\n\nWhat are reliable indicator species for the presence of HAB toxins (Emerita sp., Mytilus sp.)?\n\nHow do HABs affect local species populations?\n\nWhat are the depuration rates for shellfish and other market organisms (e.g., rockfish, flatfish, baitfish) following HAB events?\n\nWhat are the natural and anthropogenic factors influencing the HABs?\n\nWhat are the other, non-filter feeding pathways that HABs impact the ecosystem, such as through contamination of flatfish or bait fish?\n\nWhat role do agricultural versus urban nutrients play in the development of HAB events?\n\nReferences\n\nArmstrong, M.A., N.
