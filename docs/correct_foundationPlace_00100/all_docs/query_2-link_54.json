These papers form an important picture of the formation and early activity of the Michigan Anti-Slavery Society, with a record of their official resolutions, activities and expenditures. They provide insight into the inner workings of one of the most important state-level Garrisonian antislavery societies.

Harry A. Franck (1881-1962) was a University of Michigan graduate (1903), avid traveler, and veteran of both world wars. The black and white images in this collection were digitally photographed from original negatives on nitrate or acetate film and reversed into positives, while the color images are from hand-colored lantern slides (on glass) that Frank had prepared to illustrate his lectures. Most of the color images therefore have a black and white counterpart in the negative series.Image Collectionsum-ic;umscl-icArtifact Collections Held by University of Michigan,University of Michigan - Special Collections Research CenterARRAY(0x5577a8b10c20);ARRAY(0x5577a8b10c08)Photographs and Pictorial Works;Humanities (General)General Information Sources;Humanitiesforeign:https://quod.lib.umich.edu/s/sclfranck/lib/colllist/thumbnails/sclfranck.jpgHarry Alverson Franck PhotographsHarry Alverson Franck PhotographsN/AN/Atext:Harry Alverson Franck PhotographsnodefaultDigital Library Production Servicestatistics detailCollectionH/s/sclfranck restrictedNo categoryCollection not in any groupsimagehttps://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/music_hazenmusic_hazenN/AThe \"Jazz Revisited\" collection consists of digitized recordings of this half-hour radio program hosted by Hazen Schumacher and broadcast on WUOM from 1967 to 1997. The show was picked up by NPR and at its peak was aired by 220 stations throughout the country. Schumacher was an early jazz enthusiast and featured on the show jazz recordings dating from 1917 to 1947. Each episode included six or seven recordings along with brief commentary from Schumacher. The recordings played were largely 78s but later broadcasts also included reissues from LPs and CDs.Image CollectionsNo group nameARRAY(0x5577a8b10ff8);ARRAY(0x5577a8b110a0)Music;AudioArts;General Information Sourcesforeign:https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/music_hazen/lib/colllist/thumbnails/music_hazen.jpgHazen Schumacher's Jazz Revisited Radio ShowHazen Schumacher's Jazz Revisited Radio ShowN/AN/Atext:Hazen Schumacher's Jazz Revisited Radio ShowdefaultDigital Library Production Servicestatistics detailCollectionH/m/music_hazen publicNo categoryCollection not in any groupstexthttps://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jameshenryjameshenryN/AThis collection is made up primarily of correspondence to husband and wife Gilbert and Adeline James of Cherry Creek, New York.

Many originally appeared in publications that predated the widespread use of photography for art documentation. These engravings, line drawings, and plans reflect both the technological and aesthetic standards of their time. These records include full bibliographic information on the sources, which were published between 1879 and 1921. Allan T.

The Simpson collection encompasses the history of Islamic book arts, with a particular focus on illustrated manuscripts produced between 1300 and 1600 CE. The Islamic Art Archives is comprised of four series, and the Simpson material thus comprises the fifth series, which now spans a century of scholarship on Islamic art, painting, architecture, and archaeology.Image Collectionsart-ic;um-ic;vrc-icArt History / Works of Art,Artifact Collections Held by University of Michigan,Visual Resources CollectionsARRAY(0x5577a8b145d0);ARRAY(0x5577a8b14678);ARRAY(0x5577a8b146f0);ARRAY(0x5577a8b14798)Art and Design;Art History;Archives and Manuscripts;Asian Languages and CulturesArts;General Information Sources;Humanitiesforeign:https://quod.lib.umich.edu/h/hart3ic/lib/colllist/thumbnails/hart3ic.jpgHistory of Art Department, Visual Resources Collections - Simpson Islamic Manuscript Record ArchiveHistory of Art Department, Visual Resources Collections - Simpson Islamic Manuscript Record ArchiveN/AN/Atext:Simpson Islamic Manuscript Record ArchivenodefaultDigital Library Production Servicestatistics detailCollectionH/h/hart3ic restrictedArchitecture;Art History / Works of Art;Photographs;Artifact Collections Held by University of Michigan;Visual Resources CollectionsArchitecture;Art History / Works of Art;Photographs;Artifact Collections Held by University of Michigan;Visual Resources Collectionsimagehttps://quod.lib.umich.edu/h/harthartN/AThe Department of the History of Art's digital collection consists of images representing art and architecture from all eras and geographic regions of cultural history.
