        "text": "The Stronger Together program supported libraries in implementing early learning and out of school time programs. Stronger Together also provided funds for libraries to improve library access through outreach vehicles and other innovative means.\n\nEarly Learning\n\nThrough Stronger Together: Early Learning, local libraries strengthened their roles as early learning community hubs and improved or expanded early learning programs and services in their communities. Over $2.5 million was awarded to support the critical role that libraries play in providing families with much needed wraparound services and resources in partnership with community organizations, ensuring equitable access to opportunity for young children and their families across the state.\n\nBy investing in quality early learning opportunities, we are laying the foundation for a lifetime of success, resilience, and fulfillment.\n\nMayor Larry Klein, City of Sunnyvale\n\nSeveral libraries created spaces dedicated to serving early learners and their families that provided access to local community resources and services that helped children develop school readiness skills. From offering high-quality bilingual programs to developmental screenings to outdoor gardening educational programs led by master gardeners, libraries delivered tailored programming that provided youth and families with opportunities that built skills, enriched imagination, and supported whole child development.\n\nAt our early learners’ water and harvest time each week after SPROUT Storytime, children learn over and over about plant and healthy eating concepts taught in books. Many caregivers have shared that their small patrons ask each week, when are they going to visit the garden again.\n\nImperial Public Library staff\n\nParticipating Libraries\n\nAlpine County Library**\n\nButte County Library\n\nEl Dorado County Library*\n\nImperial Public Library\n\nLong Beach Public Library\n\nLos Gatos Library**\n\nMission Viejo Library**\n\nMono County Libraries**\n\nMonterey Public Library**\n\nOceanside Public Library*\n\nPasadena Public Library**\n\nSacramento Public Library\n\nSan Diego Public Library**\n\nSan Jose Public Library\n\nSan Mateo County Libraries**\n\nSanta Maria Public Library**\n\nShafter Library\n\nSunnyvale Public Library\n\nTorrance Public Library**\n\nVentura County Library\n\n*Mentor libraries who also provided support and guidance to other Early Learning libraries\n\n**Black Gold Early Learning hub library\n\nOut-of-School-Time\n\nStronger Together: Out of School Time Learning grants help local libraries improve or expand library services to out-of-school time youth. These grants, which total over $2.2 million, support and expand the critical role that libraries play for children and teens when they are out of school. Funded projects focus on one of the following topics:\n\nSocial-emotional development\n\nWorkplace preparedness of teens\n\nYouth voice and leadership\n\nAcademic / technological advancement of youths\n\nA replication of a previous Shared Vision project\n\nLibraries designed programs to serve their community in a variety of ways. Some held internships, some engaged teens as makers, some had art programs for youth and families, some focused on elevating the voices of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) youth. All of the projects leveraged community partnerships to make the impact of the work more meaningful for youth they serve.\n\nI loved being able to do behind-the-scenes work and help out with kids programs, city events and Comic Con.\n\nA Teen Intern from Santa Clara City Library\n\nIt was so cool to meet all the people from the library foundation and learn more about what they do.\n\nAn Oceanside Teen Intern who presented to the Oceanside Library Foundation\n\nThe most important thing I gained from this internship was communication skills, an essential part of my work with the Literacy Center.\n\nA Teen Intern from the Santa Barbara Public Library\n\nParticipating Libraries\n\nAlameda County Library\n\nAzusa City Library\n\nButte County Library\n\nCity of Huntington Beach\n\nCity of Imperial Public Library\n\nCity of Richmond\n\nLA County Public Library\n\nMission Viejo Library\n\nOakland Public Library\n\nOceanside Public Library*\n\nPlacentia Library District\n\nRiverside County Library System\n\nSacramento Public Library\n\nSanta Barbara Public Library\n\nSanta Clara City Library\n\nSanta Clarita Public Library\n\nSouth San Francisco Public Library\n\nThe San Jose Public Library\n\nTulare County Public Library\n\n*Mentor Libraries that provided support and guidance to other Out-of-School Time libraries\n\nImproving Library Access\n\nStronger Together: Improving Library Access grants enable local libraries to acquire bookmobiles and community outreach vehicles and offer programs that improve access to library materials and services. Over $2.67 million was awarded to help libraries eliminate barriers and implement new ways to bring literacy, technology, and other services to those who face challenges visiting their local public library. When Californians lack transportation, live far from their library, or work long hours, mobile libraries and expanded program delivery make it possible to access library services and programs. Several projects involve the use of alternative fuels and green technologies. This project also funds book bikes!\n\nThere are 20 mobile outreach vehicles rolling through or rolling towards California communities as a result of this project.\n\nCounty Librarian Christopher Veach presents on Lake County’s new bookmobile\n\nParticipating Libraries\n\nCity of Pleasanton\n\nCity of San Diego\n\nCounty of Plumas\n\nCovina Public Library\n\nLake County Library\n\nMonterey Public Library\n\nPacific Grove Public Library\n\nRiverside County Library System\n\nSan Diego County Library\n\nSanta Barbara Public Library\n\nTulare County Library\n\nWhittier Public Library\n\nWoodland Public Library\n\nVentura County Library\n\nYolo County Library\n\nOpen+\n\nOpen+ is a system that enables library patrons to access library buildings and resources outside of normal operating hours. Created to complement staffed library hours, the system uses cameras, sensors, and automated locks that allow visitors to access hold pick-up areas and other self-service resources.\n\nThe Califa Group received a $226,346 grant to implement the Improving Library Access: Open+ Pilot Project.\n\nQuestions?"
