        "text": "Accelerating Global Equality\n\nThe business case for equality knows no borders\n\nAlthough the push for LGBTQ+ inclusive workplaces began largely as an undertaking within the United States and Europe, the conversation around inclusivity is now pointedly more prominent among international stakeholders. The bottom line is undeniable – in a global marketplace, equality knows no borders.\n\nWorking hand-in-hand with both U.S.-based and international businesses, HRC made the case that inclusion efforts did not have to be contained to any one border. With many multinational companies employing persons outside of the United States, HRC encouraged CEI participants to consider how their adopted inclusive policies and practices could and would impact their workforces in countries with less tolerant legal and cultural stances towards LGBTQ+ communities.\n\nTo this effort, in 2016, the Corporate Equality Index criteria were expanded to require that companies with global operations extend their nondiscrimination policies across all their operations. This change helped drive more widespread adoption of nondiscrimination policies that include sexual orientation and gender identity protections. In 2016, 54% of CEI-rated companies had global operations and 95 percent of those companies extended their LGBTQ+ inclusive nondiscrimination policies globally. With the 2023-2024 CEI, 65 percent of rated companies have global operations and over 99 percent extend those protections globally.\n\nThe process towards LGBTQ+ inclusion does not end with nondiscrimination policies. Companies continue to amplify their global LGBTQ+ inclusion efforts through the targeted expansion of equitable benefits and inclusive practices. Globally, companies are adopting critical benefits such as domestic partner recognition and transgender-inclusive healthcare benefits, as well as organizational training and capacity building. These companies are also deepening employee engagement efforts by expanding employee resource groups for LGBTQ+ workers and their allies.\n\nIn the past, and for this 2023-2024 edition, the CEI survey collected information on global efforts to provide domestic partner benefits and transgender-inclusive benefits, support for global chapters of employee resource groups, and whether companies engage externally with LGBTQ+ communities outside the U.S. Across all categories, a majority of companies report extending these benefits and inclusive practices beyond U.S. borders.\n\n1At the HRC Foundation, we use the acronym “LGBTQ+” to represent the diversity of the greater lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer communities. We recognize that this acronym is U.S.-centric and that communities around the world recognize different identities and acronyms. When working in different communities, we adjust our language to reflect local customs.\n\nContinued Need for Partner Benefits\n\nSince 2002, the CEI has required parity between spousal and partner benefits. After the United States v. Windsor and before the Obergefell v. Hodges Supreme Court rulings, HRC released a position paper cautioning against a marriage-only standard for accessing healthcare coverage, which is an unreasonable standard given the many other legal vulnerabilities beyond their right to marry that continue to affect LGBTQ+ individuals’ freedom.\n\nSince the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which brought marriage equality nationwide by ruling that marriage is a fundamental right to which same-sex couples should have the same access as opposite-sex couples, employers have sought to do the right thing in the name of equality and provide spousal benefits to both same- and different-sex married couples. In December 2022, the U.S. Senate passed the Respect for Marriage Act (RMA) — a bill that will codify federal marriage equality by guaranteeing the federal rights, benefits and obligations of marriages in the federal code; repeal the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA); and affirm that public acts, records and proceedings should be recognized by all states. By doing so, it protects the status quo that exists following the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark rulings in Loving v. Virginia (1967), Windsor v. United States (2013) and Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) — decisions that together made equal marriage the law of the land.\n\nWhile marriage equality is undoubtedly a monumental step toward full equality, LGBTQ+ individuals remain at risk for discrimination in many other aspects of daily life. Until LGBTQ+ Americans have full equality through the federal Equality Act, domestic partner benefits will remain an essential CEI standard that helps to fill the void left by federal and state law and ensure LGBTQ+ workers and their families receive equitable benefits whether married or partnered.\n\nDomestic partner benefits do not only serve same-sex couples. In fact, over the last decade, most businesses that have offered same-sex partner benefits also extended these to different-sex partners. Employers have increasingly recognized the value of providing necessary benefits to meet the needs of their diverse workforces.\n\nIn total, 962 businesses met the standard in this year’s survey. The CEI continues to reflect best practices for LGBTQ+ workers and their families.\n\nHRC is proud to partner with leading employers on corporate initiatives that drive equality. These corporate initiatives include the Business Statement on Anti-LGBTQ+ State Legislation with over 300 major employer signatories, the LGBTQ Refugees Mentorship Initiative, and Working Positively, which invites employers to commit to being visible role models in support of HIV-positive employees and other chronic illnesses.\n\nThe latest employer activation with HRC is the Count Us In Pledge, an effort to elevate the business sector’s allyship and voice in support of transgender and non-binary people, particularly employees and their families. The pledge, with over 100 large employer signatories, represents a cross-sector commitment to stand in solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community during this unprecedented state of emergency by pledging the following:\n\nTo be proud and public LGBTQ+ allies, calling on lawmakers to abandon any efforts to discriminate and reject anti-LGBTQ threats to company values of diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nTo raise up honest and authentic experiences of LGBTQ+ Americans, including those of employees and customers in the transgender and non-binary community; and\n\nTo ensure transgender and non-binary employees and their families have access to the health and medical care they need, where possible under the law.\n\nAnd one of the largest coalition initiatives is the Business Coalition for the Equality Act. HRC’s Business Coalition for the Equality Act is a group of 552 leading U.S. employers that support the Equality Act, federal legislation that would provide the same basic protections to LGBTQ+ people that are provided to other federally protected groups. Coalition member companies represent nearly every industry, employ over 15.3 million people in the U.S., command over $7.2 trillion in revenue, and have operations in all 50 states.\n\nThe Equality Act creates clear, consistent protections to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment ensuring that LGBTQ+ employees are hired, fired, and promoted based on their performance. In addition, the bill provides protections from discrimination in housing, credit, and jury service for LGBTQ+ people. The bill also prohibits discrimination in public spaces and services and protects against discrimination in the receipt of federal funding on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity.\n\nThe historic Obergefell v. Hodges case in 2015 gave same-sex couples the right to marriage, and, since then, state legislators across the country have responded by proposing hundreds of anti-LGBTQ+ bills. However, companies opposed (and still oppose) these discriminatory bills. Over the last seven years, countless companies in all 50 states have spoken out against attempts to undermine LGBTQ+ civil rights. Discriminatory bills that attempt to curb access to public services for transgender people, deny basic services to LGBTQ+ families, or preempt local nondiscrimination ordinances put company employees, employee families, and customers at risk.\n\nCEI-rated employers are on record supporting broad issues of LGBTQ+ equality at the local, state, and federal levels, including through amicus briefs that are submitted during court cases to support pro-LGBTQ+ legislation and rulings.\n\nCorporate Equality Index 2023-2024\n\nThe HRC Foundation’s CEI rating system is designed for mid- to large-sized businesses (500 full-time employees and above) and divided into three key categories of criteria:\n\nNon-discrimination policies across business entities;\n\nEquitable benefits for LGBTQ+ workers and their families; and,\n\nSupporting an inclusive culture and corporate social responsibility.\n\nLaunched in 2002, the CEI is the first internationally recognized benchmarking report for businesses to gauge their level of LGBTQ+ workplace inclusion against competitors. In addition to seeing a growth in the number of highly-rated employers, the CEI has also seen great success in the reach of the survey. The number of employers officially rated has expanded from 319 original participants to a current participant count of 1384, encompassing all major industry sectors.\n\nInvitations and Participation\n\nThe largest and most successful U.S. employers are invited to participate in the CEI and are identified through the following lists*:\n\nFortune magazine’s 1,000 largest publicly- and privately-traded businesses (2022 Fortune 1,000); and\n\nAmerican Lawyer magazine’s top 200 revenue-grossing law firms (2022 AmLaw 200).\n\nAdditionally, any private-sector, for-profit employer with 500 or more full-time U.S. employees can request to participate, including those that are privately held.\n\n*Note: Due to the staggered timelines of the ranking lists and when contact lists are made available, the ranking year lags the CEI survey year by one year and the CEI publication year by up to two years.\n\nHow We Obtain Information\n\nThe primary source of information for the Corporate Equality Index rating each business received is the CEI survey sent every year to previous and prospective respondents. The web-based survey included links to sample policies and other guidance, found on the HRC Foundation website.\n\nHRC Foundation staff provided additional assistance and direct consultation throughout the process and reviewed submitted documentation (required within each section) for appropriate language and consistency with survey answers.\n\nInvitations for the CEI 2023-2024 survey were emailed and mailed in April of 2023 and responses were due back in July of 2023. If a business had previously participated in the CEI, surveys were first sent to the individual(s) responsible for prior submissions. If a business had not previously participated in the CEI, surveys were sent to the chief executive officer or managing partner of the firm, as well as the highest-level executive(s) responsible for human resources, diversity, communications, or community engagement, if obtaining the contact information for these executives was possible.\n\nThe information required to generate CEI ratings for businesses is difficult to ascertain from public records alone. In addition to the self-reporting provided through the CEI survey, we investigated and cross-checked the policies and practices of the rated businesses, any connections with organizations that engage in anti-LGBTQ+ activities, and news accounts of efforts that undermine LGBTQ+ equality writ large (e.g., through case law efforts or public policy lobbying actions). Employers were not rated until all appropriate information had been gathered and verified to the greatest extent possible. Businesses were invited to provide HRC Foundation staff with any additional information or updates before this report went to print.\n\nIn total, the sources used include:\n\nThe HRC Foundation’s CEI survey;\n\nInternal Revenue Service 990 tax filings reviewed for any business foundation’s gifts to anti-LGBTQ+ groups;\n\nCase law and news accounts regarding findings of discrimination and corporate responsibility and the LGBTQ+ community-at-large; and,\n\nIndividuals that report verifiable information to the HRC Foundation.\n\nIf a business was found to have a connection with an anti-LGBTQ+ organization or activity, the HRC Foundation contacted the business and provided it with an opportunity to respond and, to the best of its ability, to mitigate the harm done and ensure that no such action would occur in the future. Businesses unwilling to do so would have been penalized up to - 25 points from their overall rating through Criterion 5.\n\nWith the rise of extremists attacks on corporate advocacy and a businesses support of the LGBTQ+ community, the Human Rights Campaign revised the CEI’s Responsible Citizenship criterion to provide better guidance on the need for businesses to reaffirm support for the community when facing anti-LGBTQ+ attacks. Employers will receive up to 25 points deducted from their score for a large-scale official or public anti-LGBTQ+ blemish on their recent records. Scores on this criterion are based on information that has come to HRC’s attention related to topics including but not limited to:\n\nadvocating for public policies or regulations related to LGBTQ+ equality that would be detrimental to employees and their families.\n\nundue influence by a significant shareholder calculated to undermine a business’s employment policies or practices related to its LGBTQ+ employees;\n\nopposing shareholder resolutions reasonably aimed at encouraging the adoption of inclusive workplace policies;\n\nrevoking inclusive LGBTQ+ policies or practices;\n\nengaging in proven practices that are contrary to the business’s written LGBTQ+ employment policies.\n\ndirecting corporate charitable contributions to organizations whose primary mission includes advocacy against LGBTQ+ equality;\n\nfailing to uphold established commitments to the LGBTQ+ community resulting from pressure from anti-LGBTQ+ extremists\n\nWe define recent records: the time period your current CEI is published until the next CEI report is published, the following survey cycle. This time period is typically 1 year.\n\nOfficial and Unofficial Ratings\n\nThe HRC Foundation may have rated businesses that did not submit a survey for a 2023-2024 rating if the business has submitted a survey in previous years and the information is determined to be accurate, or, if the HRC Foundation has obtained sufficient information to provide an individual rating. In both cases, the HRC Foundation notified the business of the official rating and gave them an opportunity to provide updates or clarification prior to the report release.\n\nFortune 500-ranked businesses that, after multiple invitations, have never responded to the CEI survey were evaluated independently and have designated unofficial ratings listed in gray in Appendix A. The HRC Foundation proactively evaluates these 111 Fortune-ranked companies for two key reasons:\n\nTo provide the public with accurate information on these major employers; and,\n\nTo ensure that the CEI is truly a benchmarking report among peers.\n\nBecause LGBTQ+ workers and prospective employees must navigate the gaps in federal and state protections that affect their employment decisions, our staff assesses the research on these non-surveyed businesses through this same lens, ascertaining what we can from publicly available information and applying those findings to our CEI criteria.\n\nNo matter the rating, any business that participates in the CEI is taking on a transparent, credible process of LGBTQ+ inclusion. The HRC Foundation commends the employers that have committed to the public and transparent process of the CEI survey and we invite these 111 companies to do the same.\n\nIn total, the CEI 2023-2024 contains official ratings for 489 Fortune 500 businesses, 633 Fortune 1000 businesses, 163 law firms and 698 additional major businesses. With the additional 111 Fortune 500 businesses that have unofficial ratings, the total number of rated businesses is 1,496. Findings in the 2023-2024 CEI report are based on the 1,386 officially rated businesses."
