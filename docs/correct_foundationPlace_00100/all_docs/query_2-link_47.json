Senate Bill (SB) 450 (Allen, D-26) was signed into law on September 29, 2016, adding Section 4005 to the California Elections Code, allowing authorized counties, upon approval of their Board of Supervisors, to conduct any election by mail, with certain requirements. Under VCA, all voters are mailed a ballot commencing 29 days before the election, and each county establishes, with public input, numerous ballot drop box locations and vote centers throughout the county where any county voter may cast their ballot. This legislation is one of many election reforms designed to change how elections are conducted in order to increase voter participation and voter engagement by expanding voting options.\n\nThe County of San Diego Board of Supervisors approved the county’s transition to a vote center model under the Voters Choice Act on October 19, 2021. The San Diego County Registrar of Voters immediately created internal working groups to develop processes for operating and conducting elections under the vote center model.\n\nA great deal of planning along with the purchase of required technology and equipment had already been accomplished as a result of administering both the November 3, 2020, Presidential General Election and the September 14, 2021, California Gubernatorial Recall Election under a \"VCA-like\" model due to the global pandemic.\n\nIn addition to the work already accomplished by the Registrar’s office, we have incorporated feedback provided by voters and community advisory committees such as the Language Accessibility Advisory Committee (LAAC), and Voter Accessibility Advisory Committee (VAAC). We are also thankful for the support and guidance provided by the Secretary of State’s office and the counties who have transitioned before us.\n\nYou can learn more about joining the county’s LAAC and VAAC on the Registrar’s website at Language Accessibility Advisory Committee (sdvote.com) and Voter Accessibility Advisory Committee (sdvote.com).\n\nThe Election Administration Plan (EAP) provides the foundation and guiding outline for the future of voting and elections in San Diego County. We have updated our website to inform the public about the upcoming changes and incorporated tools for community feedback and site suggestions. The website can be found at Voter’s Choice Act (sdvote.com).\n\nFollowing the public comment period and finalization of the EAP, the Registrar’s office will implement a comprehensive Voter Education and Outreach Plan ranging from expanding our social media presence, partnerships with high schools and institutions of higher education, collaborations with government agencies and community organizations, and conducting a variety of voter education workshops. The plan is a framework for the Registrar’s office to meet its goal of informing San Diego County’s over 1.9 million registered voters of the upcoming changes and transition to the vote center model.\n\nThe first countywide election under this new model will be the June 7, 2022, Gubernatorial Primary Election, and the first special election under this model will be the April 5, 2022, State Assembly District 80 Special Primary Election. We look forward to providing San Diego County voters with more convenient and secure voting options and an improved voter experience through the vote center model. All active registered voters will receive a ballot in the mail, and they may still choose to vote in-person at any vote center in San Diego County.\n\nAt the time of preparing the EAP, San Diego County would have a minimum of 195 vote centers, all would be open for four days, including election day, with 39 of the 195 vote centers being open an additional seven days for a total of 11 days and a minimum of 130 mail ballot drop box locations are expected based on current voter registration totals and California Elections Code requirements. Voters may return their vote-by-mail ballot by mail (no postage required), at a ballot drop box location, or at any vote center.\n\nAs we transition to the vote center model, my staff and I remain committed to our mission of providing election services to the citizens of San Diego County to ensure equal access to the election process, protect the integrity of votes, and maintain a transparent, accurate and fair process while safeguarding voters against the spread of misinformation by keeping them informed of their voting options and the conduct of elections.\n\nCynthia Paes\n\nRegistrar of Voters\n\nSan Diego County\n\nVote-By-Mail Ballots\n\n§4005(a)(8)(A)\n\nThe implementation of the Voter’s Choice Act (VCA) in San Diego County requires that every one of its over 1.9 million active registered voters receive a ballot in the mail. San Diego County has proven that it is well positioned to handle the volume of the printing, mailing, and processing of mail ballots that will result from this obligation. This requirement supports current voter behavior and projected trends, which the San Diego County Registrar of Voter’s office has already taken into consideration.\n\nFurther, for all future elections, all voters will now receive a ballot in the mail regardless of preference or voting model, pursuant to Assembly Bill 37 (Berman).\n\nBackground\n\nIn the March 2020 presidential primary election, the Registrar’s office issued nearly 1.4 million mail ballots to voters who specifically requested to receive their ballots by mail, approximately 75% of the county’s total registered voters. The number of voters who request to receive ballots by mail has been steadily increasing for the better part of two decades. With such a large percentage who prefer voting by mail over the years, the Registrar’s office has matured its processes, increased capacity and is more than prepared to manage the processing of mail ballots accurately and securely.\n\nThis preparation proved successful while administering the November 2020 presidential general election. As a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic, the Governor’s two Executive Orders (N-64-20 and N-67-20), and related legislation (Assembly Bill 860 - Berman and Senate Bill 423 - Umberg) permitting the Registrar of Voters to conduct the presidential general election under a \"VCA-like\" voting model, the Registrar’s office mailed over 1.96 million ballots to all active registered voters in the county and made available 235 in-person voting sites open for four days, and 125 mail ballot drop-off locations open for nearly a month.\n\nThe Registrar again operated under a \"VCA-like\" model for the September 14, 2021, California Gubernatorial Recall Election. Over 1.96 million ballots were mailed to the county’s active registered voters, 131 mail ballot drop-off locations were open for nearly a month and 221 in-person voting sites were open for four days of in-person voting.\n\nBallot Printing & Mailing Preparation\n\nThe Registrar’s office has a state certified vendor who can handle the vote by mail ballot printing and mailing capacity. The office has also maintained a long-term and strong partnership with its local United States Postal Services office to ensure timely delivery and return of mail ballots.\n\nThe vote by mail packet is sent to voters in a white envelope labeled with the Official Election Mail logo and contains the following:\n\nA yellow return envelope\n\nThe official ballot, which may be on multiple ballot cards depending on how many contests are in the election\n\nInstructions on how to complete and return the ballot\n\nThe closest ballot drop box location along with direction to the complete lists and hours of operation at sdvote.com\n\nAn \"I Voted\" sticker\n\nProcessing Returned Mail Ballots\n\nThe Registrar’s office has invested over the years to manage backend processing of mail ballots. The office currently operates its own high-speed mail sorting machines that are used to process returned ballots. These sorting machines take an image of every returned envelope, and tracks that the ballot has been returned. The images of the signature on the returned envelopes are used by staff to perform a signature comparison and determine if the signature compares with the voter’s signature on file. The speed of the mail sorting equipment, its integration with the signature verification process, and the use of automated extraction machines has allowed the Registrar’s office to seamlessly handle the volume of returned mail ballots.\n\nCounting Returned Mail Ballots\n\nThe Registrar’s office has eight high-capacity scanners that can scan over 10,000 ballots per hour per scanner. These were purchased in 2019 and have more than doubled scanning capacity. The office has access to an additional 40 Canon scanners that can scan over 4,000 ballots per hour per scanner and can be used when additional capacity is required during the election cycle.\n\nTracking Mail Ballots\n\nThe Registrar’s office uses the Secretary of State’s Where’s My Ballot system operated through BallotTrax. This system provides additional transparency for voters on the status of their mail-in ballot. Voters can receive notifications as their security return envelope with ballot enclosed moves through the mail stream. Mail ballots are tracked using an Intelligent Mail Barcode (IMB) which the United States Postal Service uses to track when ballots are mailed and returned to the Registrar’s office.\n\nVote Center and Ballot Drop Box Locations\n\n§4005(a)(10)(B)\n\nThe VCA establishes detailed criteria and formulas for the placement and locations of vote centers and ballot drop box locations. Vote centers and ballot drop box locations will be decided based on specific considerations and requirements described below:\n\nProximity to public transportation\n\nProximity to communities with historically low vote-by-mail usage\n\nProximity to population centers\n\nProximity to language minority communities\n\nProximity to voters with disabilities\n\nProximity to communities with low rates of household vehicle ownership\n\nProximity to low-income communities\n\nProximity to communities of eligible voters who are not registered to vote\n\nProximity to geographically isolated populations, including Native American reservations\n\nProximity to college campus or university\n\nAccess to accessible and free parking\n\nThe distance and time a voter must travel by car or public transportation\n\nTraffic patterns near vote centers and ballot drop-off locations\n\nVote Center Formula and Considerations\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(vi)(l)\n\nThe VCA has established a formula for determining the number of vote centers based on the number of registered voters. Counties are instructed to provide one 11-day vote center for every 50,000 registered voters and one 4-day vote center for every 10,000 registered voters. Based on the algorithm outlined in the VCA, the required minimum is 39 vote centers open for 11 days, including Election Day, and 195 vote centers that will be open for four days, including Election Day, in San Diego County.\n\nThe Registrar’s office plans to provide more vote centers than the required minimum. San Diego County will operate approximately 39 vote centers open for 11 days, including Election Day. All of the locations will be in full operation during the last four days of voting throughout San Diego County. Vote centers will have two \"opening days\", with greater numbers of vote centers in operation during the final four days with expanded hours on Election Day.\n\nIncreasing the number of locations will enable the placement of additional vote centers in isolated communities like Borrego Springs, Boulevard, Campo, Descanso, Rincon, and Warner Springs.\n\nVote Center Minimum Requirements\n\nVote centers will be decided based on requirements set forth in statute, the accessibility to voters with disabilities and language needs, location availability, and public feedback. The Registrar’s office will use voter and population data to assist with selecting the best areas for vote centers.\n\nThe Registrar’s office has been identifying and assessing hundreds of potential facilities to ensure that locations are distributed throughout San Diego County in a manner that provides greater access and convenience for all voters.\n\nVote Center Site Selection\n\nVCA requires counties to consider at a minimum fourteen criteria when establishing vote centers. The Registrar’s office uses the Center for Inclusive Democracy (CID) siting tool and the most current available geospatial data from SanGIS to consider all required criteria. The Registrar’s office provides access to the interactive CID siting tool which allows the user to search for and evaluate any proposed location against required criteria (see Center for Inclusive Democracy Siting Tool description on page 22).\n\nWhile the CID Siting Tool provides a quick and effective way to assess proposed locations against required criteria, it does not automatically define where vote center locations will be identified and confirmed.\n\nVote Center Survey Assessment\n\nIn addition to considering required criteria, a vote center survey assessment considers many of the other site selection elements that, while not required by law, impact the vote center siting process. Some examples of these site selection elements include path of travel, size of the voting room, the presence of adequate lighting (both inside and outside), the geographic area of the proposed site, internet connectivity, and electrical capacity.\n\nVote Center Facility Recruitment Process\n\nAs a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic and emergency legislation the Registrar’s office conducted both the November 2020 presidential general and the September 2021 gubernatorial recall elections under a \"VCA-like\" voting model with 221 to 235 voting locations open for four days of voting across the county. These voting locations were again reviewed and assessed to determine if they would meet minimum requirements for a vote center.\n\nLocations unable to accommodate vote center operations, such as private residences and locations under 1,000 square feet, were contacted to inform them of the transition to a new voting model and thanked them for their past service. The remaining facilities were moved forward to the next level of review in the recruitment process.\n\nFacility Research\n\nBased on the previous facility recruitment process, a list of over 500 voting locations has been reviewed and contacted to serve as possible vote centers if initial criteria were met.\n\nNon-public facilities were contacted for further discussion on availability and potential costs. Public facilities were contacted to schedule vote center survey assessments.\n\nConsistent with previously used polling place research, additional public properties and facilities within the county are being evaluated and added to a master list for further research. Suitable facilities, that have not served as polling places, have been contacted for vote center site assessments. Additionally, based off population data, cities have been evaluated for a targeted number of vote centers.\n\nList of Potential Vote Centers with Days and Hours of Operation\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(vi)(III), §4005(a)(10)(l)(vi)(VI)\n\nThe Registrar’s office is currently in the process of identifying potential vote centers and conducting site assessments and accessibility surveys. Vote center locations will be selected in conjunction with public feedback and the requirements as necessitated by law. The final list of selected vote centers will be included in the Voter Information Pamphlet and will be available on the Registrar’s website, sdvote.com .\n\nStarting ten days before Election Day, approximately 39 vote centers will be open during regular business hours, from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., and on Election Day, from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. An additional 196 vote centers will open starting at three days before Election Day. See page 67 in Appendices for the 11-Day and 4-Day Locations Table at the time of publishing. The San Diego County Registrar of Voters will publish a list of vote centers on the Election Information page at sdvote.com.\n\nMap of Suggested Areas for Vote Centers\n\nVote Center Layout\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(vi)(XI)\n\nA voter’s experience at any of the county’s vote centers will be similar to voting at one of the voting locations used during the September 2021 gubernatorial recall election. Vote centers offer voters enhanced services and benefits that are secure and convenient. All vote centers will be equipped with a minimum of four electronic rosters (electronic pollbooks, or e-pollbooks) allowing vote center staff to verify the status and eligibility of the voter quickly and easily, and a minimum of eight ballot marking devices. At vote centers, a voter will be able to:\n\nVote in-person or drop off an already voted mail ballot (sealed inside its return envelope)\n\nUse a touchscreen ballot marking device to mark selections and print out an official ballot\n\nAll ballot marking devices are fully accessible allowing voters with disabilities to vote independently and privately\n\nVote in-person using the ballot you received in the mail\n\nIf you made a mistake or lost your mail ballot, you can instead vote in person at any vote center\n\nGet language assistance\n\nRegister to vote and vote the same day\n\nUpdate voter registration information (address, political party)\n\nThe Registrar’s office will implement vote center layout guidelines to ensure all ballot marking devices and voting booths are placed in a manner that allows a voter to mark their ballot independently and privately. Layouts will be sensitive to the accessibility needs of voters and will be expected to be adjusted to accommodate the varying shapes and room sizes of each location (see page 66 in Appendices for a sample layout).\n\nEach vote center layout incorporates four stations:\n\nGreeter Station: Greet voters, manage any lines, accept mail ballot drop off or provide check-in forms, clipboard, pen, and direct voters to check-in station\n\nCheck-in Station: Check-in voters, conditionally register voters and provide assistance\n\nVoting Station: Voters mark their selections privately and independently with a ballot marking device or in a voting booth (marking ballot mailed to them)\n\nCheck-out Station: Cast ballot in official ballot box and receive “I Voted” sticker\n\nNumber of Vote Center Employees\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(vi)(IX)\n\nThe estimated number of vote center employees is based on the number of 11-day and 4-day vote centers, the number of check-in stations and ballot marking devices in relation to the anticipated turnout of a vote center and a schedule that supports all-day shifts. Estimates of the number of required vote center employees are calculated based on an average of six staff needed at the 11-day centers, and twelve staff at the 4-day voting at all centers. The average considers that there may be differences in the number of required staff at any given vote center.\n\nTraining of Vote Center Employees\n\nTraining of vote center employees is guided by the California Secretary of State’s Poll Worker Training Guide. The county’s Poll Worker Training Manual and other training materials can be viewed on the Registrar’s website at Poll Workers Training (sdvote.com). This material is typically posted one month prior to Election Day.\n\nBallot Drop Box Location Formula and Considerations\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(vi)(II)\n\nThe VCA has established a formula for determining the number of ballot drop box locations based on the number of registered voters. Counties are instructed to provide at least two locations within the jurisdiction where the election is held or at least one ballot drop box location for every 15,000 registered voters. San Diego County Registrar plans to provide approximately 130 ballot drop box locations throughout San Diego County.\n\nMinimum criteria are being considered and evaluated while researching any potential ballot drop box location. Ballot drop box sites that will best provide voters with additional options to drop off their ballot securely and conveniently are being considered. Best efforts are being made to identify locations for stand-alone drop boxes, in areas with existing security camera coverage in different areas than vote center sites and post offices.\n\nThere will be a combination of stand-alone and staffed ballot drop box locations.\n\nBallot Drop Box Minimum Requirements\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(vi)(VI)\n\nIn addition to the VCA minimum requirements, the California Secretary of State’s office provides regulations such as accessibility and language requirements. Stand-alone ballot drop boxes have been designed to provide translated legal language included in the graphics of the ballot drop box. As well, the Registrar’s office is evaluating the possibility of adding additional features to support voters with disabilities, such as content in Braille, and high contrast artwork, and will continue to work with disability community partners to research best practices for future consideration.\n\nBallot drop box locations, whether indoors or outdoors, will be decided based on the requirements set forth in the VCA, accessibility to voters with disabilities and language needs, location availability, and public feedback.\n\nThe Registrar’s office will be identifying and assessing hundreds of potential locations to ensure that the ballot drop boxes are distributed throughout San Diego County in a manner that provides greater access and convenience for all voters.\n\nAs well, the Registrar will follow “California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 2. Administration, Division 7, Chapter 3. Article 1. Vote by Mail Ballot Drop Boxes and Vote by Mail Drop Off Locations” guidelines which provide security measures in the design requirements of the ballot drop box, security monitoring and procedures of use during the available voting period. The design and language printed on the ballot drop boxes will inform the public that the box is official and secure. Ballot drop boxes will have preventative security such as anti-vandalism coating and fire suppression features.\n\nBallot Drop Box Survey Assessment\n\nVCA requires counties to consider at a minimum fourteen criteria when establishing ballot drop box locations. The Registrar’s office uses the Center for Inclusive Democracy (CID) siting tool and the most current available geospatial data from SanGIS to consider all required criteria. The Registrar’s office provides access to the interactive CID siting tool which allows the user to search for and evaluate any proposed location against required criteria (see description of Center for Inclusive Democracy Siting Tool on page 22).\n\nWhile the CID Siting Tool provides a quick and effective way to assess proposed locations against required criteria, it does not automatically define the final ballot drop box locations.\n\nBeyond the minimum requirements, additional criteria will be considered in choosing the ballot drop box locations. These criteria, while not required by law, impact the siting process, and improve the desirability of the location. Some examples of these site selection elements include, presence of an onsite security camera, availability of short term/temporary parking spaces for the ballot retrieval team, and the presence of adequate lighting at the proposed site.\n\nBallot Drop Box Location Recruitment Process\n\nAn informational packet is being developed which will include a letter from the Registrar of Voters and an informational ballot drop box flyer on specifications, expectations, and frequently asked questions. The packet will be used to outreach to potential sites and will provide detailed information about the ballot drop box process. The packet will include a ballot drop box agreement so that all parties have a clear understanding of roles and obligations.\n\nPrevious polling places and mail ballot drop off locations were reviewed to determine if the location could support a ballot drop box on site. Working concurrently with potential vote center site selections, potential ballot drop box locations have been identified that will provide additional options for voters to drop off voted ballots. In addition, research has been conducted on potential city sites, libraries, and other publicly available locations. Well-known retail shopping centers and privately-owned properties have also been identified as possible locations. All potential ballot drop box locations are being further reviewed. Like the vote center recruitment process, cities and areas that have the largest need for ballot drop boxes are being prioritized.\n\nEvery potential site will undergo a site assessment to determine suitability and accessibility. Once the site is fully reviewed, final determinations will be made on the potential location of any placement. This will require working with the site tenant, property management company and/or property owner for approval.\n\nList of Potential Ballot Drop Boxes with Days and Hours of Operation\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(vi)(IV), §4005(a)(10)(l)(vi)(VII)\n\nThe Registrar’s office is currently in the process of identifying potential ballot drop box locations and conducting site assessments and accessibility surveys. Ballot drop box locations will be selected in conjunction with public feedback and the requirements as necessitated by law. The final list of selected ballot drop box locations will be included in the Voter Information Pamphlet and will be available on the Registrar’s website at sdvote.com.\n\nAll ballot drop box locations will be open during regular business hours with at least one accessible box that is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. All ballot drop box locations will close Election Day, at 8:00 p.m.\n\nSee page 77 in Appendices for Ballot Drop Box Locations Table at the time of writing and publishing. The Registrar of Voter’s office will publish a list of ballot drop box locations on the Election Information page at sdvote.com.\n\nMap of Suggested Areas for Ballot Drop Box Locations\n\nVote Centers and Ballot Drop Box Siting Tool and Methodology\n\nTo assist with selecting sites for vote centers and ballot drop box locations, the Registrar’s office uses the Center for Inclusive Democracy (CID) siting tool and the County’s Geographic Information System (GIS) technology to help identify optimal sites for potential vote centers and ballot drop box locations. This is accomplished by visualizing demographic and voter data, polling places, parcel information, census data, and precinct information at the community level.\n\nUtilizing the siting tool’s grid, made up of half mile cells covering the entire county, “suitable areas” were identified and compared against archived polling places, voting locations and new public properties and facilities. Survey assessments were performed to determine if the locations would meet minimum required criteria and other site selection elements for a vote center or ballot drop box location.\n\nTo further assist with the process, the CID data was integrated with potential vote center and ballot drop box locations based off archived polling places, voting locations, public infrastructure, and community sites. This allows exploring existing data, proposing new sites, and tracking progress of site selection process to make informed decisions.\n\nMethodology\n\nUsing CID siting tool, site selection elements, and GIS technology, the San Diego Registrar of Voters will identify locations for all “suitable areas” in the County to host vote centers and ballot drop box locations.\n\nSite Selection Suggestion Form on Website\n\nAnother way vote center and ballot drop box locations are selected for assessment is public feedback received through the Site Suggestion Form on sdvote.com. This allows the public to provide a facility name, address, and a reason for suggesting a location. The Registrar’s office continues to follow up on feedback related to vote centers and ballot drop box locations.\n\nServices for Voters with Disabilities\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(vi)(X)\n\nThe San Diego County Registrar of Voters is committed to supporting voters with disabilities throughout the transition to the vote center model. The Registrar’s office will expand and update services for voters with disabilities through a collaborative process of community and advisory committee input and by using an updated comprehensive accessibility survey.\n\nThe Registrar’s office supports voters with disabilities by:\n\nEnsuring all vote centers meet accessibility requirements\n\nUsing ballot marking devices with current accessibility supported technology\n\nProviding the ability to cast a ballot independently from home through the county’s remote accessible vote by mail (RAVBM) system\n\nProviding audio and large print versions of voting material\n\nUpdated Accessibility Survey\n\n§4005(a)(4)(C)\n\nTo comply with accessibility requirements, the Secretary of State Accessibility Checklist was reviewed, and additional requirements were added to the Registrar of Voter’s Polling Place Survey to create the San Diego County Registrar of Voters Vote Center Survey. The updated version focuses on a more in-depth examination of paths of travel from public transportation, seeking sites with a maximum number of accessible parking spaces, and additional questions to differentiate between types of curb ramps.\n\nThe past survey was also reviewed to ensure that all questions on the current survey follow the Secretary of State Accessibility Checklist and the requirements in the VCA. The format of the Vote Center Survey was also updated from previous paper versions and outdated electronic versions to an application-based program that can be used on a mobile electronic device.\n\nInformation for Services for Voters with Disabilities included in Voter Information Pamphlet and VBM Instructions\n\n§4005(a)(8)(B)(i)(IV)\n\nThe Voter Information Pamphlet will include information on how voters with disabilities can request assistance, Disability Rights California’s Voting Hotline phone number, and how to contact the Registrar of Voter’s office for any general questions. Additionally, the pamphlet will specify that a voter unable to mark a ballot may bring up to two individuals to assist with voting. The pamphlet will also include a postcard with prepaid postage for voters to request a remote accessible vote by mail ballot (RAVBM).\n\nThe mail ballot instructions will inform voters of the availability of requesting election materials in an accessible format.\n\nAccessible Information Posted to Website\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(i)(IV), §4005(a)(8)(B)(ii)\n\nThe Registrar of Voter’s website provides information to all voters in an accessible format. Special attention has been given to the design of the website to facilitate compatibility with screen readers and easy navigation.\n\nThe website provides voters with information relating to the election process, registering to vote, VCA legislation, and the Election Administration Plan (EAP). The website also has a dedicated Accessible Voting (sdvote.com) webpage that will provide information about services available to voters with disabilities, including:\n\nVote center and ballot drop box accessibility\n\nBallot marking device description and instructions\n\nResources for voters with disabilities\n\nRequesting a remote accessible vote by mail ballot (RAVBM)\n\nThe website will include information on the types of services available to voters with disabilities, what services can be accessed at vote centers, and more. It will also include a list of vote centers and ballot drop boxes in an accessible format.\n\nHow a Voter with Disabilities may request a Mail Ballot, RAVBM, or Replacement Ballot\n\n§4005(a)(5), §4005(a)(10)(l)(ii)\n\nWith the move to vote centers, a person with a disability can request a mail ballot, RAVBM, or replacement ballot via the website, through email, over the phone, in written form, or in person at the Registrar’s office. A voter may also request RAVBM through the postage-paid postcard included in every Voter Information Pamphlet. In addition to these options, voters will also be able to request a replacement ballot and vote in-person at any vote center.\n\nRemote Accessible Vote-By-Mail (RAVBM)\n\n§4005(a)(8)(B)(i)(IV)\n\nSan Diego County registered voters with disabilities may request a downloadable ballot by connecting to the Registrar’s remote accessible vote-by-mail (RAVBM) system. RAVBM provides voters with disabilities the ability to request access to a mail ballot electronically. The ballot can be downloaded to the voter’s computer, marked using the voter’s own assistive technology and then printed. Instructions are provided in the RAVBM system.\n\nAs with any mail ballot, RAVBM ballots must be sealed inside a return envelope as provided in the system’s instructions, signed and returned by mail or at any vote center or official ballot drop box location.\n\nReturn instructions are also available in the voter information pamphlet sent to every voter’s mailing or email address.\n\nType and Number of Accessible Ballot Marking Devices\n\n§4005(a)(2)(B), §4005(a)(4)(D), §4005(a)(10)(l)(vi)(X)\n\nAll San Diego County vote centers will be equipped with a minimum of eight fully accessible ballot marking devices and may expand the number of devices dependent on the voting room size and voter needs. All voters are offered the use of these accessible ballot marking devices.\n\nA voter can mark their ballot using the touchscreen display, audio tactile device, or their own assistive technology. The ballot marking devices provide voters with disabilities an autonomous voting experience. Ballot marking devices will be arranged to allow all voters the opportunity to cast their ballot privately and independently.\n\nType and Number of Reasonable Modifications at Vote Centers\n\n§4005(a)(6)(D), §4005(a)(10)(l)(vi)(X)\n\nThere are multiple types of reasonable modifications that will be offered inside vote centers. A minimum standard of eight accessible ballot marking devices, and physical modifications will be in place to support voters with disabilities.\n\nMagnifiers and signature guides are available and prominently displayed at each check-in station. Chairs will be available if needed at check-in stations and at the accessible voting units. If a voter needs additional assistance, vote center employees will be available to assist a voter as a visual guide through the voting room, or to read out any information they may not be able to see.\n\nIn addition to the modifications mentioned above, each vote center will be surveyed for accessibility. If needed, facilities may be provided with threshold ramps for short rises to enter rooms, cones to identify hazards, and mats to cover slipping hazards. Most facilities will be asked to leave doors to the voting room open for accessibility.\n\nEach vote center will have signs with a phone number a voter may call to request curbside voting without entering the vote center.\n\nMobile Voting\n\nThe Registrar’s office will continue to seek opportunities and funding to bring mobile voting to voters in unique locations and geographic areas where voters might otherwise have limited access to in-person voting options. Staff are researching the optimal approach for providing these services such as considering the use of a “pop-up” type vote center location or a self-contained mobile unit.\n\nThe Registrar’s office is also researching the potential use of the county’s Live Well Mobile Office as a mobile vote center.\n\nToll-Free Voter Phone Line\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(vii)\n\nThe public will be provided a toll-free voter phone number to direct voters to the accessibility features in order to ask questions and receive voting and election-related information. The toll-free phone number will be published on the Registrar of Voters website and provided in media outreach and direct voter contact information including the Voter Information Pamphlet.\n\nVoters who are deaf, hard of hearing, or speech-disabled may use the California Relay Service (CRS) by dialing 711 to use the telephone system via a text telephone (TTY) or other device to call the Registrar of Voter’s office toll-free voter phone number. CRS supports the following modes of communication: TTY, VCO, 2LVCO, HCO, STS, VASTS, ASCII, or Voice.\n\nVideo Conferencing\n\nThe Registrar’s office is researching options for providing American Sign Language interpretation assistance upon request at vote centers and will consult with its VAAC and the Deaf Community Services of San Diego (DCS) to assess the need and/or the viability of recruiting ASL proficient poll workers to assist voters in-person at vote centers.\n\nLanguage Assistance Services\n\nThe Registrar of Voter’s office provides comprehensive language assistance services to voters. From having dedicated bilingual staff prepare culturally appropriate translations and maintaining an extensive event calendar, the Registrar’s office is committed to providing numerous opportunities for language communities to learn about the transition to vote centers.\n\nThe Registrar’s office has full-time bilingual employees overseeing each of the county’s federally covered languages and during each countywide election cycle we make every effort to recruit and hire bilingual seasonal employees in each of the county’s state covered languages.\n\nThe Registrar’s office goes above and beyond what is required by state and federal law by utilizing the county’s interpreter service where appropriate. Most recently a Somali interpreter was brought in for a public meeting targeting the Somali speaking community.\n\nTranslated Reference Ballots and Language Assistance\n\n§13400\n\nPer California Elections Code §14201, the Registrar’s office is required to provide translated reference ballots for targeted precincts and information indicating that translated reference ballots are available for targeted precincts. The Registrar’s office will have a complete set of translated reference ballots for targeted precincts at every vote center.\n\nLanguage Assistance Services included in Voter Information Pamphlets or Mail Ballot Instructions and Website\n\n§4005(a)(8)(B)\n\nVoters will be notified of their ability to request translated election materials and language assistance services in the Voter Information Pamphlet and mail ballot instructions.\n\nThe website will provide the complete list of language assistance services. Currently, the Registrar’s office utilizes Language Assistance (sdvote.com) to provide information on language assistance services under the polling place model. This webpage will be updated to reflect language assistance services available under the vote center model.\n\nBilingual Vote Center Staffing and Supported Languages\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(vi)(IX)\n\nThe Registrar’s office will determine which vote centers are located in or adjacent to a precinct that meets language requirements under the federal Voting Rights Act (VRA) for in-person language assistance. In addition, the Registrar’s office will solicit public input regarding which vote centers should be staffed by individuals who are fluent in specific languages, pursuant to subdivision (c) of §12303 and §203 of the federal Voting Rights Act. Every effort will be made to recruit and assign bilingual vote center staff to these vote centers.\n\nAt vote centers identified as meeting language assistance requirements, voters will still have alternate options to receive effective in-language assistance such as translated written materials, or assistance over a telephone call.\n\nThe Registrar’s office will continue to collaborate with the community to provide Somali speaking bilingual staff at targeted vote centers which is above and beyond what is required by state and federal law.\n\nToll-Free Voter Phone Line and Voter Call Center\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(vii), §4005(a)(10)(l)(i)(I)\n\nLeading up to Election Day, the Registrar’s office operates a call center that is staffed with bilingual operators and utilizes an interpreter call-in service to assist voters (in-language) with questions before, during, and after an election. The toll-free call center number is (800) 696-0136 and it has been activated.\n\nThe toll-free phone number will also be published on the Registrar’s office website, public service announcements, marketing materials, and provided in media outreach and direct voter contact information including the Voter Information Pamphlet. There is one toll-free number to serve the public, including language communities.\n\nVoting Technology\n\nElectronic Roster of Voters (E-pollbooks)\n\nElectronic pollbooks (e-pollbooks) replace paper rosters and provide a mechanism to ensure efficient and secure processing of eligible voters at any vote center location. These e-pollbooks contain an electronic list of registered voters (Roster of Voters) that are used at vote centers. The Roster of Voters is the official list of all registered voters eligible to vote in the election. E-pollbooks may be used to verify voter registration data, including name, address, date of birth, preferred language, party preference, precinct, and vote-by-mail status. However, e-pollbooks never store driver's license number, or any reference to a social security number. They provide better searching and more up-to-date voter status information than a paper roster, creating a better voting experience for voters.\n\nThe e-pollbooks exchange voter status updates with the voter registration system in a protected, encrypted way, which enables the staff at the vote center to better verify a voter’s eligibility to receive a ballot and prevent double voting. The registration system shares that information through its connection to the VoteCal system. VoteCal is the centralized statewide voter registration database that interacts and exchanges information with county registration database and other state systems such as Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Department of Public Health, and the Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nVoting System\n\nThe Registrar of Voters follows strict chain of custody requirements for voting system software and hardware throughout the testing, certification, and operating process. As part of the certification process, San Diego County’s voting system went through rigorous functional and security testing conducted by the Secretary of State’s office and a certified voting system test lab in order to ensure the system’s compliance with California and federal laws, including the California Voting System Standards (CVSS) which are the strictest in the nation. The county’s certified voting system software and hardware is used in an environment where chain of custody and software integrity is strictly controlled.\n\nSecurity is built into every aspect of county’s voting technology. As part of the rigorous voting technology certification process, an independent third-party testing authority conducted source code review and evaluation, hardware and software security penetration testing, and operational testing to validate system performance and functioning under normal and abnormal conditions. This was done to identify any vulnerabilities in the code requiring voting system vendors to resolve or mitigate prior to certification to essentially prevent any issues with the county’s elections.\n\nThe Registrar’s office strict chain of custody requirements, including personnel requirements, protects the source code from breaches and the post-election reviews and audits establish compliance between voted ballots and the voting system.\n\nIn addition, the county’s voting system is paper based, meaning the Registrar’s office has a paper ballot trail for every vote cast.\n\nBallot Marking Device (BMD)\n\nEvery vote center will have a minimum of eight touchscreen ballot marking devices that will print out an official paper ballot with the voter’s choices that they can review before placing the ballot in the official ballot box to be counted at the Registrar’s office.\n\nVoters visiting these locations to cast their ballot in person will mark their ballot using the device. This device does not store, tabulate or count any votes and it does not store any voter information.\n\nThere is a reason why these devices are called ballot marking devices. The voter marks their selection on the screen. Then, on the paired printer the voter will print out their official ballot with their selections. This official paper ballot is what goes inside the official ballot box to be tabulated at the Registrar of Voter’s office.\n\nThe ballot marking devices are fully compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act. In addition to English, voters can select a translated ballot in one of the County’s four federally covered languages: Spanish, Filipino, Vietnamese, and Chinese.\n\nVote center staff will start a voter’s session by activating the device. Voters choose the language and make their selections by touching the screen next to voting choices. Voters can review their choices and make corrections if necessary on-screen, then tap “print ballot” to print out their official ballot. After reviewing their selections, voters can place their ballots in the secrecy sleeve or envelope given to them by vote center staff and may place it in the ballot box or give it to vote center staff to place in the ballot box for them.\n\nInstructional videos will be available at sdvote.com.\n\nVoting Security\n\nThe Registrar’s office aggressively pursues security measures to protect the integrity of our elections by paying attention to issues related to ballot integrity and voter registration systems. Although threats are constantly changing and incidents are unique, there are best practices and strict protocols in place to prepare for threats and incidents.\n\nThe Registrar’s office continues to improve our current systems through hardware and software lifecycle management practices. The Registrar’s office has implemented physical and cybersecurity controls while incorporating training for employees.\n\nThere are strict access controls in place securing the room where the voting system resides. Each room in the Registrar’s office has ceiling mounted cameras directed at entry and exit areas for additional security precautions.\n\nSecurity and Contingency Plans to Ensure Prevention of Disruption\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(vi)(VIII)(ia)\n\nThe Registrar’s office has a multi-pronged approach to ensure prevention of disruption to election operations through partnerships, internal controls, and procedures.\n\nState, Federal, and Local Partnerships\n\nThe Registrar’s office has developed a relationship with the San Diego County Chief Technology Office (CTO) and the current Information Technology Outsourcer (ITO) – who manages the county’s IT network. The Registrar’s office also has a direct relationship with the California Secretary of State, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Election Assistance Commission (EAC).\n\nThere is increased collaboration around election cycles before and after the election. The Registrar’s office enhances security awareness and communication, including regular meetings with the County’s CTO, ITO, Sheriff, DHS, and the FBI.\n\nInternal Controls\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the Registrar’s office includes a multi-layered approach to ensure the data remains encrypted and secured at all times. Physical security is also a consideration when choosing a location to host a vote center. Only facilities that provide adequate physical security will be chosen.\n\nMobile device management allows total control of securing and enforcing policies related to e-pollbook tablets. Mobile device management allows for the ability to remotely wipe a device, use password enforcement, and enable software updates as needed.\n\nEvery vote center will have a smartphone for notification in the event of an emergency. Vote center staff will also receive training and instructions in their reference manual on what procedures to follow should there be an emergency. Voting equipment will have battery back-up in the event there is a loss of power.\n\nProcedures, Methods and Standards\n\nChain of custody procedures are used as an administrative control as part of the overall strategy to secure election operations. The chain of custody procedures ensures that physical tracking of voting system equipment is in place.\n\nVoting system components are secured within a secure location until deployed for the election. Ballot marking devices are placed in numerically sealed transportation containers. All voting equipment is tracked with RFID labels when deployed and returned to the Registrar’s office.\n\nElection workers sign chain of custody documents, known as seal verification logs, for voting equipment at distribution locations. Election workers and vote center staff will be required to check the security seals periodically and report any broken seals or suspicious activity. Voting equipment is inventoried and placed in a secured location.\n\nSecurity and Contingency Plans to Ensure Continuation of Election in Event of Disruption\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(vi)(VIII)(ib)\n\nThe Registrar’s office has a continuity of operations plan in place to mitigate or prevent disruptions in the elections process; however, it is equally important to be prepared to respond to the real possibility of an incident or disruption. This section outlines the steps taken to be prepared to continue elections operations in the event of a disruption.\n\nVote Center Response During the Voting Period\n\nDuring the voting period, election support personnel are located throughout San Diego County, ready to respond to any incident. These field personnel have replacement voting equipment and supplies and are trained to handle technical issues. Vote center employees have emergency contact information, including a dedicated helpdesk that can quickly resolve issues, or dispatch a member of the support team in the field.\n\nAll vote center equipment functions independently. If one piece of equipment stops functioning, it does not impact the operation of other voting equipment.\n\nContinuity of Operations Plan\n\nThe Registrar’s office has an in-depth plan that can be used in the event of a cybersecurity incident or outage. This plan provides a systematic way to identify, address and recover from an incident.\n\nEssential functions and their associated information technology dependencies have been identified to ensure ongoing elections operations in the event of a disruption. It provides a framework for determining critical business processes and enabling the organization to survive the loss of part or all operational capabilities.\n\nDelegations of authority have been set to avoid misinformation and manage the dissemination of information to voters, staff, and media during a disruption, as well as make policy determinations and decisions for functional areas of the department as appropriate.\n\nMethods and Standards\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(iv)\n\nThe purpose of the continuity plan is to allow election operations to continue in the event of a disaster, an incident, or a service disruption. By identifying the procedures for essential functions, processes, communications, and alternate facilities, most foreseeable disruptions to elections operations can be mitigated.\n\nEssential Functions\n\nThe continuity plan identifies all essential functions required to run an election. Each of these essential functions are analyzed, and the technical dependencies for each are determined. For each of the technical dependencies, a recovery strategy is defined, including the restoration of required data.\n\nCommunications\n\nThe continuity plan also addresses modes of communication, and how communication can continue during a disruption. This includes alternate modes of communication in the event the primary system fails. Responsibilities are assigned for disseminating information, and key stakeholders with whom it will be required to communicate in the event of a disruption. The process that is disrupted determines with whom the communication needs to occur. For example, some disruptions will require communication to only vote center staff, while other disruptions may require communication to the media and general public.\n\nAlternate Facilities\n\nAlternate facilities are designated for local disasters, such as fires, floods, or other situations that would not allow access to our main facilities.\n\nFor vote centers affected by a disaster or power outage, voting activities can be relocated to another part of the facility. Ballot marking devices and E-pollbooks have battery backup and could be moved outside for temporary use due to a short-term loss of indoor access. If voting activities cannot continue then nearby locations will be contacted and voters will be provided guidance on where to go. Signage will be posted at any affected locations and information related to the relocation will be disseminated through local media outlets.\n\nFiscal Impact\n\nEstimates of Short-Term and Long-Term Savings\n\n§4005(a)(10)(I)(v)\n\nThe following tables show a breakdown of the one-time and ongoing costs and savings associated with conducting elections pursuant to the Voter’s Choice Act. The Registrar’s office has invested in its voting system, matured its processes, and increased its capacity over the years to manage such an already large percentage of voters who prefer voting by mail and is well positioned moving forward to manage the processing of mail ballots accurately and securely.\n\nAs a result of the transition to the Voter’s Choice Act, the County of San Diego expects to see savings from no longer paying the nearly 10,000 poll workers a stipend to work on Election Day. However, ongoing costs are expected as a result of providing wireless connectivity for ePollbooks (Roster of Voters) to use at each vote center. In addition, poll workers will be paid an hourly wage for multiple days of work since vote centers will be opened more days. Finally, there are additional costs for voter outreach and education as a result of the new requirements.\n\nThe Registrar’s office will continue to analyze the effects of the Voter’s Choice Act on long-term costs and savings associated with conducting elections under this new model.\n\nOverview of Voter Education and Outreach Plan\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(i), §4005(a)(10)(l)(i)(VI)\n\nBackground\n\nThe Registrar’s office already has a robust voter education and outreach program with five dedicated full-time staff along with an additional 18 to 20 seasonal staff during election cycles. Our outreach coordinators have strong and well-established relationships with community leaders and stakeholders. We are committed to cultivating new partnerships with community organizations, as well as strengthening our existing relationships with community partners during the transition to the vote center model.\n\nIt has been challenging during the pandemic but historically we have participated in well over 300 community events and meetings each year. Through 2020 and 2021 much of this work was done virtually and with COVID-19 still looming we will continue using a virtual platform as appropriate.\n\nFortunately, we can leverage our recent voter engagement activities and the exposure gained through conducting the last two statewide elections in 2020 and 2021 under a “Vote Center” type model. The comprehensive outreach campaigns associated with those elections will only support our efforts moving forward.\n\n“VCA-like” November 2020 Presidential General Election Cycle:\n\nDuring the November 2020 election cycle the Registrar’s office sent two direct mailings to all registered voters informing them of the upcoming changes in the election and their voting options. We placed 165 newspaper ads across 43 different newspapers in San Diego County, including in-language newspapers.\n\nWe ran nearly 450 audio ads across 12 different radio stations, including in-language outlets, plus additional streaming ads.\n\nIn addition to traditional and digital advertising, the Registrar’s office strategically utilized large outdoor posters on the exterior walls of gas stations, convenience stores, and bodegas located in underserved neighborhoods. In total, we placed posters around 45 different locations in San Diego County. We created four poster designs, each poster included English messaging and featured a language that is represented in the specific neighborhood. This tactic allows the Registrar’s office to target neighborhoods where other forms of traditional media can’t always reach.\n\nAdditional digital media included five email blasts, display ads, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter ads that targeted the general market, federally covered languages, and communities of color. We also developed and aired 30 Public Services Announcements available in five languages.\n\nThis campaign delivered over 90 million impressions.\n\n“VCA-like” September 2021 Gubernatorial Recall Election Cycle:\n\nDuring the most recent September 2021 recall election, we placed 35 newspaper ads across 28 different newspapers in San Diego County, including in-language newspapers. We placed audio ads across 12 different radio and streaming stations, including in-language outlets and ran approximately 1500 ads on traditional radio.\n\nIn addition to traditional and digital advertising, the Registrar’s office again utilized the large outdoor posters in underserved neighborhoods based on targeted zip code selections. We found this to be a successful tactic in 2020. In total, we placed posters at 65 different locations across San Diego County.\n\nAdditional digital media included two email blasts, display ads, Facebook and Twitter ads, again targeting our general market, and communities of color.\n\nThis campaign delivered over 57 million impressions.\n\nBoth campaigns informed San Diego County voters of their voting options consistent with the Voter’s Choice Act, including that all active registered voters will automatically receive a ballot in the mail nearly a month before Election Day, voters can return their ballot by mail, or at any ballot drop off or voting location, and in-person voting is available over multiple days at any one of the 200+ locations across the county.\n\nThese two statewide elections gave San Diego County quite an advantage as we now officially transition to the Voter’s Choice Act. The Registrar’s office has already gone to great lengths to prepare voters for any changes they may find in the upcoming election. The 2022 outreach efforts and media campaign will continue to reenforce voting options and that now these changes voters have already experience are permanent for all future elections.\n\nThe Registrar’s office will continue to participate in outreach events that have been historically attended, as well as develop creative and more effective ways of communicating to voters. This Voter Education and Outreach Plan will highlight outreach events the Registrar’s office will coordinate and/or attend, outline messaging strategies that will increase our presence in the community, and detail how resources will be allocated more efficiently through the analysis of key data points.\n\nSummary of Goals\n\nVoter education workshops/demonstrations\n\nVote Center community presentations\n\nCommunity engagement events\n\nPartnerships with colleges and universities\n\nPartnerships with high schools\n\n2 – 4 direct voter contacts\n\nRobust multilingual, targeted media campaign\n\nIncreased social media presence\n\nCommunity Partners\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(i)(III)\n\nSuccessfully maintaining a community outreach program includes maintaining established partnerships with community-based groups and organizations. The Registrar’s office regularly meets with dedicated individuals from various organizations across San Diego County including advocacy groups, civic groups, citizen leagues, senior centers, churches, city clerks, political parties, and other individuals. Community partners are listed starting on page 52 in Appendices.\n\nVoter Accessibility Advisory Committee & Language Accessibility Advisory Committees\n\n§4005(a)(9)(A), §4005(a)(9)(B), §4005(a)(10)(l)(i)(I)\n\nThe Registrar’s longstanding Voter Accessibility Advisory Committee (VAAC) and Language Accessibility Advisory Committees (LAAC) are designated to focus on the needs of voters with disabilities and minority language communities.\n\nThe mission of the LAAC is to advise and assist the Registrar’s office with implementation of federal and state laws relating to access to the electoral process by voters with limited-English proficiency.\n\nThe LAAC also provides recommendations identifying and prioritizing activities and programs to ensure equal access to the ballot. The responsibilities of the committee include providing expertise on language accessibility issues; providing recommendations identifying and prioritizing activities; and responding to the office’s questions regarding language support.\n\nThe mission of the VAAC is to advise and assist the Registrar’s office with providing services to voters with accessibility needs and explore all opportunities to provide equal access to the ballot.\n\nThe VAAC also provides recommendations identifying and prioritizing activities and programs to ensure voters with disabilities can independently cast a ballot. The responsibilities of the committee include providing expertise on accessibility matters; incorporating accessibility procedures into operations; and providing feedback to the Registrar’s office regarding accessibility standards and outreach to voters with disabilities.\n\nLAAC and VAAC meeting agendas and a list of members and supporting organizations for each group can be found starting on page 62 in Appendices. Language community partners and disability community partners are listed on page\n\nVoter Education Workshops for Language Communities\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(i)(VI)(ia)\n\nFollowing the final publication of the EAP, the Registrar’s office will host voter education workshops to provide vote center and election information for each of San Diego County’s federal and state required languages. The federally covered languages include Spanish, Filipino, Vietnamese, and Chinese. The state covered languages include Arabic, Japanese, Korean, and Laotian.\n\nEach workshop will include information about the vote center model, voting equipment overview/demonstration, language assistance services, ballot drop-off options, and methods to request translated election materials. Information about the workshops will be announced at least 10 days in advance of the date and will be shared with the LAAC and language community organizations.\n\nThe Registrar’s office will partner with the LAAC and its language community partners to determine the number of workshops, dates, times, and locations, and what materials to distribute to best serve voters with language needs.\n\nMethods to Identify Language Communities\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(i)(V)\n\nThe Registrar’s office utilizes the number of voters who request language assistance through voter registration forms. Voters may also notify the Registrar’s office of their language preference by telephone, fax, email or online to update their language preference. Sources such as the United States Census Bureau help identify areas where there may be communities that have limited-English proficiency and may need language assistance.\n\nIn addition, the Registrar’s office receives input from language community partners on the geographic distribution of where language communities exist in San Diego County.\n\nToll-Free Voter Phone Line and Language Assistance\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(vii), §4005(a)(10)(l)(i)(I)\n\nLeading up to Election Day, the Registrar’s office operates a call center that is staffed with bilingual operators and utilizes an interpreter call-in service to assist voters (in-language) with questions before, during, and after an election. The toll-free call center number is (800) 696-0136 and it has been activated.\n\nThe toll-free phone number will also be published on the Registrar’s office website, public service announcements, marketing materials, and provided in media outreach and direct voter contact information including the Voter Information Pamphlet. There will be one toll-free number to serve the public, including language communities.\n\nVoter Education Workshop for Disability Community\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(i)(VI)(ib)\n\nFollowing the final publication of the EAP, the Registrar’s office will host voter education workshops to increase accessibility and participation of eligible voters with disabilities. The workshops will include education about the vote center model, voting equipment overview/demonstrations, the accessibility of the voting equipment, ballot drop-off information, and options for obtaining an accessible vote-by-mail ballot.\n\nThe Registrar’s office will partner with the VAAC and its disability community partners to determine the number of workshops, dates, times, and locations, and what materials to distribute to best serve voters with disabilities. Possibilities include developing instructional and informational outreach materials on topics such as RAVBM and available services for voters with disabilities at vote centers.\n\nInformation about the workshop events will be announced at least 10 days in advance of the date and it will be shared with the VAAC and disability community organizations.\n\nRemote Accessible Vote-By-Mail Outreach\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(i)(II)\n\nThe Registrar’s office will develop an outreach plan to inform voters of the availability of RAVBM in partnership with the VAAC. Different strategies will be created based on the target audience and best practices on how to reach them. This will be implemented as a part of the larger overall media strategy for informing and engaging voters leading up to the June 7, 2022 Gubernatorial Primary Election.\n\nHigh Schools\n\nThe Registrar’s office has strong relationships with high schools through its Student Poll Worker Program. The program allows students to participate as poll workers on Election Day and gain hands-on experience in the democratic process.\n\nIn addition, the Registrar’s office will leverage its existing relationships with high schools to provide pre-registration opportunities, voter registration training, and information on how elections are conducted under the vote center model.\n\nColleges and Universities\n\nThere are over twenty colleges and universities in San Diego County. The Registrar’s office has built relationships with many colleges and universities through hosting polling places and mail ballot drop-off locations, as well as supporting voter education efforts and voter registration training to student organizations. The Registrar’s office has already begun planning efforts with colleges and universities to host a vote center or mail ballot drop box location on campus.\n\nDetention Facilities, Probation, and Parole\n\nThe Registrar’s office has established relationships with county detention facilities, and the probation department to provide voter registration training, election information, news stories, flyers and posters, updates, and we remain available to answer questions of staff as they assist voters throughout the year.\n\nWe also coordinate the receipt of voter registrations, distribution of ballots including conditional voter registration, and the return of ballots for each county detention facility.\n\nWe provide volunteer training to outside organizations that have arranged with the Sheriff’s department to register individuals at the county detention facilities.\n\nWe will continue to work with community organizations and advocates to identify how we can support efforts to inform those on probation or on parole of their rights to register and vote.\n\nThe Registrar’s office will develop posters with tailored messaging to be hung at probation and parole offices and in the recommended communities of Southeast San Diego, National City, City Heights, Barrio Logan, and North County.\n\nVoter Engagement and Community Events\n\nParticipating in events throughout San Diego County is an integral part of the Registrar’s voter outreach program. Covering a diverse and expansive area, these efforts aim to achieve the following goals:\n\nEducate voters on the transition to the vote center model and voting options\n\nProvide information and allow opportunity for individuals to register to vote\n\nNetwork and pursue collaborative opportunities\n\nAs many groups exist within San Diego County, participation in community events allows the Registrar’s office to promote services, build partnerships, and interact with various communities. Targeted groups have included, but are not limited, to the following:\n\nCommunity groups\n\nChurches\n\nCitizenship classes\n\nLanguage Groups\n\nRotary clubs\n\nHigh Schools\n\nUniversities\n\nProfessional associations\n\nStudent organizations\n\nPublic service agencies\n\nCultural clubs\n\nNon-profit organizations\n\nYouth groups\n\nService organizations\n\nSenior citizen centers\n\nCommunity Events\n\nTo maintain presence in the community, the Registrar’s office will continue to focus its community outreach efforts on small-to-medium and large-scale events. The Registrar’s office will be present at these events to register eligible voters and to provide information about the transition to the Vote Center model, voting, and other election information. Staff will engage the public, answer questions, and assist in filling out voter registration forms.\n\nBy participating in these events, the Registrar’s office will have access to thousands of individuals in communities throughout San Diego County. A list of potential community events being pursued in the 2022 election cycle is available on page 50 in Appendices.\n\nGeneral Media Plan\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(i)(I)\n\nTo inform San Diego County voters of the upcoming changes to voting and elections, the Registrar’s office will take an expansive approach to reach as many voters as possible, multiple times. Advertising tactics include, but not limited to, social media, direct mailing, print, broadcast, video, digital, outdoor posters, audio, and radio. The Registrar’s goal is to saturate the spectrum of media outlets for voters to increase the potential for a voter to see informational and marketing materials.\n\nIn additional to reaching the general market, the media campaign will feature in-language ads targeting hard to reach communities, low voter turnout areas, underserved populations, and more.\n\nMedia Partners\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(i)(II), §4005(a)(10)(l)(i)(VIII)\n\nThe Registrar’s office will provide news stories, video, and social media content for mass distribution and publication to existing media partners and seek out other trusted media sources to relay information. Accessibility options, methods to request an accessible ballot, vote center and ballot drop box locations, other general election information and other voting updates will be shared with media partners. For a list of media partners, please see page 57 in Appendices.\n\nNews stories will be posted through the County News Center which will position information as timely and critical. Stories posted through the County News Center are shared and disseminated to the public through the local media. All stories are translated in Spanish, Filipino, Vietnamese, and Chinese and sent to the appropriate language media outlets.\n\nAdditionally, the Registrar often appears on local media to provide up to date information related to the election.\n\nLanguage Media Partners\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(i)(l)\n\nSan Diego County’s diverse communities receive news updates and information from a variety of sources, including language media outlets. The Registrar’s office has dedicated full-time staff to serve as liaisons to language communities and have developed strong relationships with language media partners in communities that speak Spanish, Filipino, Vietnamese, and Chinese. Information on the upcoming election and the toll-free voter assistance hotline will be shared with language media partners. For a list of language media partners, please see page 59 in Appendices.\n\nDirect Voter Contacts\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(i)(X)\n\nThe Registrar’s office plans to send two to four direct mailings to inform all registered voters of the availability of the toll-free voter assistance hotline and the upcoming changes to elections and voting. The mailers may vary in size but will be designed to catch the attention of the voter with vote center branding and messaging. The mailers may also provide information such as voting options, vote center and ballot drop box locations and hours, and when to expect a Voter Information Pamphlet or official mail ballot packet.\n\nEach mailer will be translated into each of the county’s federally covered languages. The English version of the mailer will include messaging in each of the county’s federally covered languages describing how a voter can obtain the mailer or other election materials in another language.\n\nThe first mailer will go out approximately 99 days before Election Day (E-99) with a second mailer going out just prior to the vote centers opening (around E-22). In addition to these mailers, targeted messaging will also be included in the county’s Voter Information Pamphlet starting to go out at E-40 and in the official mail ballot packet going out at E-29.\n\nA sample of the first mailer can be found on pages 97 and 98 in the Appendices.\n\nPostage-Paid Postcard for Requesting Materials in an Alternate Language or an Accessible Format\n\n§4005(a)(8)(B)(iii)\n\nAll registered voters will receive a postage-paid postcard in their Voter Information Pamphlet to request a mail ballot in an accessible format and to request election materials in alternate languages per §14201 of the California Elections Code and §203 of the federal Voting Rights Act. Instructions will be included in the pamphlet and on the Registrar’s website for completing and returning the postcard.\n\nPublic Service Announcements\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(i)(VIII), §4005(a)(10)(l)(i)(IX)\n\nThe Registrar’s office will create visual and audio PSAs in varying lengths and themes to inform voters of the upcoming election (translated in all federally covered languages). The content will be informational as well as instructional such as notifying voters of the upcoming election and options for casting a ballot. Videos and audio will promote the toll-free, accessible voter hotline to ask questions and receive voting and election-related information.\n\nThe videos will be open-captioned and be in accessible formats to be inclusive of voters who are hard of hearing or deaf and voters who are blind or visually impaired. Additionally, videos will be audio-recorded in Spanish, Filipino, Vietnamese, and Chinese. Content will be provided to general media partners and language media partners. Please see page 57 in Appendices for a list of general media partners and page 59 for language media partners.\n\nSocial Media\n\nThe Registrar’s office will use social media to attract new voters and to provide information to existing voters about the change to vote centers and updates on critical deadlines, voting tips, vote centers and ballot drop box locations.\n\nThe Registrar’s office will utilize Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Nextdoor to promote vote center information and target languages (English, Spanish, Filipino, Vietnamese, and Chinese) and populations in San Diego County such as African American, American Indian, Hispanic/Latino, Filipino, Vietnamese, and Chinese.\n\nBelow are social media strategies to achieve the overall goals of informing and educating voters about the transition to the vote center mSponsored posts across social media channels that are targeted to users based on location, demographics, user interests, behaviors, and user preferencesode:\n\nSponsored posts across social media channels that are targeted to users based on location, demographics, user interests, behaviors, and user preferences\n\nCreate a monthly social media calendar that shares important election information including deadlines, voting options, and more\n\nPlace the Registrar’s office as the official resource of election information in San Diego County by sharing important election information, breaking down the voting process, dispelling election misinformation, and responding to voter’s most asked questions\n\nCreate eye-catching content including graphics and videos to keep voters engaged and informed\n\nOutdoor Posters, Transit Shelters and Billboards\n\nIn addition to traditional and digital advertising, the Registrar’s office will strategically utilize neighborhood billboards and large outdoor posters at gas stations, convenience stores, grocery stores, liquor stores, and bodegas as well as advertising in transit shelters located in hard-to-reach neighborhoods based on targeted zip code selections and the Center for Inclusive Democracy mapping tool. Each display will feature English and a language that is represented in the specific neighborhood.\n\nThese tactics allow the Registrar’s office to target neighborhoods where other forms of traditional media can’t reach.\n\nFor a past sample of large poster locations please see page 60 in Appendices. All locations are subject to availability.\n\nWebsite\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(i)(IV)\n\nThe Registrar’s website, sdvote.com will be utilized heavily as the main source of vote center information and materials for the public. Information on the website is in accessible formats and is publicly available. This will include the EAP, methods to request an accessible mail ballot, the ability to use an accessible ballot marking device and how to use it, lists of vote centers and ballot drop box locations, and other information related to the VCA.\n\nMaterials on the website are also translated into the Registrar’s federally covered languages so voters with limited-English proficiency in these languages will be able to access important election information.\n\nProjected Budget for Voter Outreach\n\n§4005(a)(10)(l)(i)(VII), §4005(a)(10)(l)(i)(VII)\n\nThe transition to the voter center model is a fundamental change for San Diego County voters and will require significant funding for the multiple facets of the Voter Education and Outreach Plan through the 2022 election cycle.\n\nVoter Education and Outreach Funding and Comparison to Past Budgets\n\nAppendices\n\nPublic Meetings\n\nIn developing of the EAP, the Registrar’s office hosted well over the minimum number of public meetings in San Diego County to gather input from the public. These meetings gave attendees the opportunity to learn about the upcoming transition to the vote center model and provide feedback.\n\nTo be inclusive of targeted communities, language assistance was provided at select meetings and particular meetings were promoted to the disability community. Additional public meetings above and beyond what is required by state and federal law were held for Native American and Somali communities.\n\nTargeted Communities\n\nNumber of Meetings\n\nDisability Community\n\n4\n\nSeniors\n\n1\n\nHispanic/Latino\n\n5\n\nVietnamese\n\n5\n\nChinese\n\n5\n\nFilipino\n\n6\n\nJapanese\n\n3\n\nKorean\n\n3\n\nArabic\n\n4\n\nLaotian\n\n1\n\nAdditional Communities\n\nNumber of Meetings\n\nNative American\n\n2\n\nSomali\n\n1\n\nPublic Meeting Schedule\n\nFull schedule of vote center public meetings is provided below.\n\nCommunity Events\n\nThe list below represents targeted community events the Registrar’s office plans to pursue in 2021 and 2022.
