        "text": "Library & Local History\n\nHistory of the LibraryIn 1886 the first library in Pacific Grove opened in the “reading corner” of the Old Parlor. The Old Parlor was located at 165 Fountain Avenue at the corner of Fountain and High, now Ricketts Lane. It was used as a community hall from the early 1880s until 1910.\n\nThe Pacific Grove Library Association also dates from 1886. In 1904 the collection was given to the city which obtained a Carnegie grant of $10,000 in 1906. The Pacific Improvement Company donated the lot, itself valued at $10,000. Total costs far exceeded the grant; therefore, plans were modified and the difference made up through taxation. McDougall Bros. designed the building and Harry Chivers and the Granite Rock Company were the builders. At the dedication, Paris Kilburn praised the building in which size but not quality was sacrificed. He named all the craftsmen, and berated complainers: “What you want here is your taxes not lowered but increased, and abandon the idea of getting something for nothing.” The library was enlarged in 1926, 1938, 1950 and most recently in 1978-1981 with the new steep gable roof incorporating all.\n\nIn 1908 the Pacific Grove Public Library opened at 550 Central Avenue, Pacific Grove, California 93950.\n\nAlthough the exterior of the original Carnegie building has changed somewhat, it is still in the Mission style, and many of the original features in the interior, including the lovely arches and windows of the Reading Area, have been maintained. These features, along with a library staff long noted for friendly assistance and high quality service, combine to provide a welcoming atmosphere to everyone who visits the library.\n\nIn October 2019 the library moved to a temporary location at 542 Lighthouse Ave., #111 while the building on Central Ave. underwent an extensive remodel of the interior. The renewal project was deemed substantially complete in July of 2020.\n\nBridges that Span the Centuries“Books are our best, our wisest, and most faithful companions. They instruct, they entertain, and they console us. Books like searchlights, penetrate the darkness of the past and supplement our fading memories. Like the noonday sun, they illumine the present, and make our limited field of vision almost boundless as omniscience. They are the bridges that span the centuries...they annihilate space and time, and make our libraries whispering galleries wherein the faintest noise from the most distant place and time can reach the dullest ear.”\n\nHorace Platt\n\nPacific Improvement Company\n\nPGPL Cornerstone Laying\n\nNovember 9, 1907\n\nLocal HistoryThe Local History Collection\n\nThe Pacific Grove Public Library collects, organizes, stores and displays books, maps, images, manuscripts, audio visual materials, oral histories, biography files, directories, voter registers, local newspaper clippings, ephemera, and other printed, handwritten and drawn artifacts pertaining to Pacific Grove's heritage.
