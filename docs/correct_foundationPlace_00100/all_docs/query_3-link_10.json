        "text": "The California State Library is pleased to offer Stronger Together: Improving Library Access, a state-funded opportunity that provides grants to local libraries so they can acquire bookmobiles and community outreach vehicles and offer programs that improve library access and program delivery. The purpose of this project is to help libraries eliminate barriers and implement new ways to bring literacy, technology and other services to those who face challenges visiting their local public library. When Californians lack transportation, live far from their library, or work long hours, mobile libraries and expanded program delivery make it possible to access library services and programs.\n\nGrantees\n\nBelow is a list of the current Stronger Together: Improving Library Access grantee organizations and their projects.\n\nGrantee OrganizationProject NameCity of PleasantonPtown on the Go!City of San DiegoAccess in MotionCounty of PlumasGreenville BookmobileCovina Public LibraryRec and Read Covina!Lake County LibraryLake County Library BookmobileMonterey Public LibraryBookmobile Replacement Project for Monterey Public LibraryPacific Grove Public LibraryPacific Grove Public Library Mobile Outreach Vehicle Electric (PGPL MOVE)Riverside County Library SystemLibrary ConnectSan Diego County LibraryMobile Outreach – Zero Emission VehicleSanta Barbara Public LibraryLibrary on the GoTulare County Library FoundationCheck It Out Tulare County LibraryVentura County LibrarySchool Mobile LibraryWhittier Public LibraryWhittier Public Library on the GoWoodland Public LibraryWoodland Public Library Mobile Library ProjectYolo County LibraryYOLO Mobile Library\n\nEligibility\n\nAn applicant must be a California public library, or a California cooperative system, consortium or library membership organization. Cooperatives, consortia or library organizations must apply on behalf of a specific, defined group of affiliate libraries.\n\nRequirements\n\nAll participating libraries will:\n\nAcquire a new or modify an existing bookmobile or community outreach vehicle, or provide programs intended to improve library access and program delivery\n\nHave a partner or community connection with at least one organization\n\nProvide brief quarterly reports on status of bookmobiles or community outreach vehicles\n\nTimeline\n\nApplication opens: September 20, 2021\n\nRecorded information session\n\nDeadline to apply: November 15, 2021 at 5:00 p.m.\n\nFunds awarded: January 2022\n\nProject completion: March 31, 2024\n\nGrant Details\n\nGrant Amounts\n\nMost awards will be from $50,000 to $250,000, though we may consider smaller or larger amounts (for example, in the case of a cooperative application) on a case-by-case basis.\n\nMatch Requirements\n\nA match is required for these grants, which may be cash, in-kind, or a combination of both. The match will be based on your library’s Local Income Per Capita (LIPC) level, which is derived from California Public Libraries Survey data. For libraries in LIPC Level 1, a 20% match will be required. For LIPC Level 2, a 25% match will be required. For LIPC Level 3, a 30% match will be required. The match is a percentage of funds requested, not a percentage of the total budget. For example, the 20% match on a $100,000 funding request would be $20,000. We will consider reductions in match on a limited, case-by-case basis.\n\nTo find your library’s LIPC, please check the State Library’s Statistics webpage.\n\nPartnership and/or Community Connection\n\nEach funded project must have at least one partner or community connection. A partner is defined as an organization with which your library has a written agreement and which also provides resources to the project, either cash or in-kind, or both. A community connection is defined as an organization that supports your project but with whom you have no formal written agreement.\n\nProject Details\n\nWe are seeking projects that are guided by the principles of equity, diversity, inclusion, and belonging in all aspects of project planning, implementation, and evaluation.\n\nFunded projects can include the purchase of vehicles, such as bookmobiles, vans, bikes, or other vehicles, to extend library services to hard-to-reach populations. Projects involving vehicles that use alternative fuels, such as electric vehicles, are especially encouraged. Proposals for program support for existing vehicles that are underutilized because of lack of staff and other resources such as collections and equipment will also be considered.\n\nProjects may also include proposals to support programs intended to improve library access and program delivery, including lockers and pop-up libraries.\n\nTo ensure the success of each project, libraries will be required to provide quarterly status updates on the procurement process of their bookmobile or community outreach vehicle.\n\nIf your library would like to apply to participate in Bibliotheca’s Open+ project, that application counts as a Stronger Together: Improving Library Access grant. The grant process for libraries seeking to implement Open+ will be run separately, so please do not use the current application to apply for Open+.\n\nPlease note, for staffing costs, state funding can only be used to fund project-specific staff or staff time spent directly on the project.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nAssociation of Bookmobiles and Outreach Services\n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging resources\n\nThe following webinars were created to support the Shared Vision/Bringing the Library to You Mobile Solutions grants. The trainings include helpful information about how to select a mobile library vehicle, which features to include, how to implement mobile library services in your jurisdiction, and more.\n\nLibrary Mobile Outreach (Part One): A Practical Guide for Selecting the Correct Vehicle for Your Library\n\nLibrary Mobile Outreach (Part Two): A Guide for Selecting the Correct Options and Features for Your New Vehicle\n\nBringing the Library to You!
