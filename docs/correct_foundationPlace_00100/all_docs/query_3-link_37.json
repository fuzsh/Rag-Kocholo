        "text": "Our next WateReuse Central Coast chapter meeting will be on Thursday, July 25 from 12:00pm to 1:00pm. This will be a virtual-only meeting hosted on Teams.\n\nOur main presentation will focus on Prepping Your Wastewater for Future Potable Reuse. The City of Ventura is embarking on a project to upgrade its water reclamation facility (VWRF) in anticipation of its inclusion into a potable reuse treatment train coupled with an Advanced Water Purification Facility (AWPF). The design objective for the VWRF is to maximize the available log reduction values (LRVs) for viruses, Giardia cysts, and Cryptosporidium oocysts (V/G/C) through the use of membrane bioreactor (MBR) and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection treatment techniques. Through new regulatory pathways, this project was able to develop a framework for projected baseline LRVs of 1/2.5/2.5 for MBR and 1.5/4/4 for UV disinfection, with the opportunity for additional LRVs via MBR challenge testing, that could be used for indirect/direct potable reuse (IPR/DPR) credits.\n\nAn agenda will be distributed prior to the meeting.\n\n11 am PT | 2 pm ET (1 hour)\n\nThis webcast is free of charge.\n\nPDHs: 1\n\nRegister Now!\n\nThis webcast, co-hosted by the U.S. EPA, will present the key outcomes of an expert workshop that sought to understand how the permitting process can better support innovative water resource management solutions, such as water reuse. The webcast will detail five characteristics to support a permitting process that is not a painful hurdle, but rather an opportunity for mutual creativity between regulators, regulated entities, and the engaged public. Webcast participants will learn about how this framework can be applied to their unique circumstances, work being done by EPA and partners, and how innovation can be better facilitated through permitting.\n\nSpeakers:\n\nJustin Mattingly, Water Reuse Program, U.S. EPA\n\nMichael Kiparsky, University of California, Berkley\n\nDave Smith, Water Innovation Services\n\nFelicia Marcus, Stanford University\n\nhttps://watereuse.org/civicrm/event/register/?reset=1&id=414\n\nPlease find below the 2024 schedule for the Legislative-Regulatory Committee. All in-person meetings will be held at the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California’s Sacramento offices located at: 1121 L Street, Suite 900, Sacramento.]\n\nBoth in-person and virtual meetings will occur from 12:30 to 2:00 pm. Those indicated as virtual will occur over Zoom and a link will be provided on the agenda.\n\nThe 2024 WRCA Annual Conference will be at the: Hyatt Regency Orange County.\n\nPlease save the date for our 2024 meeting dates:\n\n1. January 19 – in person\n\n2. March 8 – virtual\n\n3. March 22 – in person\n\n4. April 12 – virtual\n\n5. May 10 – in person\n\n6. May 31 – virtual\n\n7. June 21 – virtual\n\n8.
