        "text": "CAL STATE UNIVERSITY MONTEREY BAY\n\nLike the Bayonet & Blackhorse Golf Courses, California State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB) is located on the former Fort Ord Army Base in Seaside. With its expansive campus and scenic location, CSUMB became the 21st campus in the California State University system in 1994, giving students access to study in an \"outcomes-based\" educational environment.\n\nCSUMB academic programs integrate several traditional fields of study to provide the breadth of knowledge and depth of skills so highly valued by employers. On top of that, students get hands-on experience through service learning, internships, and action research before finally demonstrating their cumulative learning in comprehensive Capstone projects that showcase their abilities perfectly just as they enter the job market.\n\nIn addition, CSUMB is home to former White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta's Foundation. Recently, the Foundation worked with CSUMB to develop a Masters in Public Policy degree."
