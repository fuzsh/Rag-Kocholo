        "text": "Elucidation of the EP Leatherback Migration Corridor: The Influence of Ocean Currents\n\nThis multi-year dataset confirmed the existence of a persistent migration corridor for leatherbacks spanning from the Pacific coast of Central America, across the equator and into the South Pacific. The turtles traveled along a predominantly southwesterly heading, which was strongly influenced by ocean currents. An earlier telemetry study hypothesized a leatherback migration corridor between Costa Rica and Galápagos that could be influenced by environmental factors such as ocean fronts, bathymetric features, currents, or geomagnetic cues [6]. We examined each of these hypotheses with our larger sample size, and found no relationship between the southward turtle movements and the most prominent frontal feature in the region, the Equatorial Front, which runs east to west just north of the equator (Text S1). We also found no consistent association between leatherback tracks and the Cocos Ridge, the dominant bathymetric feature in the region, even after current correction (mean turtle heading = 193° versus 224° if they had followed the orientation of the Ridge). Instead, the turtles' movements over the Cocos Ridge were correlated with the current strength of the southern edge of the CRD, which deflected them over portions of the Ridge each year (Figure 3A–3C). Once the influence of currents was removed, it was apparent that the turns observed in the tracks in the corridor region (12 °N–5 °S) were current-induced. For these reasons, we conclude that navigation through the complex and highly energetic equatorial region supports the existence of a compass sense, possibly guided by the geomagnetic map (Figure 3F) formed by the force and inclination fields in the region, as has been documented for sea turtles in other parts of the world [18].\n\nOur results demonstrate that leatherbacks responded to strong zonal currents by increasing their southward speed, probably to maintain their SSW headings and to avoid being pushed too far eastward or westward from their destination in the South Pacific Gyre. Inter-annual variability in current location and strength was a major force shaping the turtles' migration routes. In each year, the migration corridor was initially constrained to the zone of lowest MKE associated with the center of the CRD (Figure 3A–3C) and, ultimately, the breadth of their dispersal within the South Pacific Gyre (Figure 2B) was determined by the strength of the equatorial currents through which they migrated. This was particularly evident in 2005, when the currents were weaker, and in 2007, with stronger currents (Figure 3B and 3C). This interaction between post-nesting EP leatherbacks and currents contrasts with that of South African leatherbacks [19], whose variable long-distance movements suggest passive drift with prevailing currents in the Southwest Indian Ocean.\n\nLeatherbacks moved rapidly through the productive equatorial region [20,21] and then dispersed in the most oligotrophic region of the Pacific Ocean [22]. The slow, meandering movements by the turtles in the South Pacific Gyre suggest that post-nesting female leatherbacks probably migrate there to forage. Leatherback turtles do not feed directly on phytoplankton but on large gelatinous zooplankton [23], and despite its low phytoplanktonic biomass, the South Pacific Gyre ecosystem sustains an ample mesozooplanktonic forage base and a substantial longline tuna fishery [24,25]. Therefore, we suggest that following the energetic demands of egg production, it may be more efficient for post-nesting EP leatherbacks to forage in an oceanographically quiescent region within which high water clarity could enhance prey detection [26] while requiring minimal swimming effort.\n\nA further possible explanation for the consistency in migration routes followed by EP leatherbacks is that present-day migration patterns do not reflect the historic diversity of migration strategies, such as that observed in other leatherback populations [13,14,19,27]. The leatherback tracks presented here, which document the first 12–18 mo of the entire ∼4-y remigration interval, suggest that post-nesting EP turtles almost exclusively occupy oceanic areas. Eckert and Sarti [7] also tracked EP leatherbacks to oceanic areas, but a few of these turtles moved into coastal areas off South America. A single turtle in this study (tag ID 56280, tagged during 2005) occupied exclusively nearshore foraging habitats along the coast of Central America throughout the entirety of its tracking duration (562 d). Previous reports have indicated substantial leatherback bycatch in nearshore fisheries in the EP, specifically in swordfish driftnets off Chile and Peru [7,28,29], and leatherbacks continue to interact with fisheries in Peruvian [30] and Chilean waters [31]. Given that coastal areas in the EP represent highly productive areas when compared with oceanic areas, Saba et al. [32] hypothesized that this bycatch could have essentially extirpated a “coastal” migratory phenotype in this population. Sustained tracking efforts on the EP population, including continuous tracking studies on previously tagged remigrant turtles, and tagging of turtles in foraging habitats are necessary to test this hypothesis.\n\nConservation Implications of EP Leatherback Tracking Data\n\nCharacterization of spatio-temporal habitat use is a fundamental element of effective biodiversity conservation management strategies. Our results have enabled us to define two high-use areas for leatherback turtles in the EP: (1) an oceanic post-nesting migration corridor shaped by currents, and (2) and putative foraging grounds in the South Pacific Gyre. The data provide compelling new strategies for conservation of Pacific leatherbacks (Box 1), which could also benefit other marine species.\n\nBox 1. Conservation Recommendations from EP Leatherback Tracking Data\n\n1. Implement specific strategies for leatherback protection within existing MPAs and conservation initiatives in the EP.\n\n2. Improve collection of fisheries-dependent information to characterize leatherback-fisheries interactions in the EP.\n\n3. Increase understanding of multi-species movements and high-use areas through the use of fisheries-independent data (i.e. electronic tagging).\n\n4. Apply recommendations 1–3 above for planning of dynamic time-area closures and/or appropriate gear modifications to reduce leatherback-fisheries interactions within the following high-use areas:\n\n• EP leatherback high-use area #1: Post-nesting migration corridor spanning an open-ocean region from the Pacific coast of northwest Costa Rica (approximately 12°N) to approximately 5°S, within which turtles are seasonally concentrated during the period of February-April.\n\n• EP leatherback high-use area #2: Defined by the predictable association of turtles during their dispersal phase within putative foraging habitats in the region of current motions (i.e. eddy kinetic energy) in the South Pacific Gyre.\n\nFirst, we encourage enhanced regional and international cooperation in management of leatherbacks and their migration corridor occurring within existing MPAs (i.e., PNMB, Cocos Island, Coiba Island, Galápagos Islands) and conservation initiatives (i.e., ETPS). Because much of the leatherback dispersal region occurs within international waters, multinational organizations and policy instruments (i.e., Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles, Inter-American Tropical Tuna Convention, Convention on Highly Migratory Species, Comisión Permanente del Pacífico Sur, United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organization) should be leveraged to achieve turtle management and conservation outcomes on the high seas. The leatherback migration corridor, which occurs during a period of a few months (February–April, Figure 3H), is largely contained within the boundaries of the ETPS, which also includes PNMB and the coastal areas used by one of the tagged turtles. This affords an opportunity for each of the governments involved in these initiatives to actively participate in the spatio-temporal management of leatherbacks as they occupy the network of MPAs in this region (Figure 4).\n\nEP leatherback turtle home-range utilization distribution for all years combined (2004, 2005, and 2007). Boundaries of the ETPS, corresponding to the exclusive economic zones of Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador, and Colombia, are shown as dashed blue lines. The green polygon comprises the region with the lowest climatological EKE (≤30 cm2 s−2) in the South Pacific Gyre.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0060171.g004\n\nSecond, we strongly recommend enhanced and increased collection of fisheries-dependent bycatch data and fisheries-independent habitat use data throughout the EP. In particular, expanded and improved observer coverage in EP fisheries would be an important step to characterize leatherback interactions with fisheries operations in the EP, because currently available information on leatherback bycatch is inconsistently collected for most fisheries. Collection of fisheries bycatch data for leatherbacks is critical to evaluating relative effects of distinct fisheries on leatherback mortality. Leatherback interactions with small-scale fisheries (i.e., artisanal, traditional, subsistence) may be especially critical in coastal habitats where extremely high sea turtle bycatch rates have been observed [7,33].\n\nFor fisheries-independent information, further electronic tagging efforts on EP leatherbacks and other highly migratory marine species that share similar high seas habitats and face common human threats would improve effectiveness of adaptive conservation schemes. Our data represent only the initial segment of the entire nonreproductive period for female leatherbacks, leaving much of their at-sea behavior and habitat use unexplored. Therefore, a priority for future leatherback tagging studies should be to focus on foraging ground behavior and movements throughout the entire nonreproductive period.\n\nThird, improved data on fisheries bycatch and leatherback habitat use in the EP as outlined above would inform planning of dynamic time-area closures and/or appropriate gear modifications intended to reduce turtle interactions with fisheries. A current illustration of this approach is in the USA California/Oregon-based drift-gillnet and longline fisheries, where a time-area closure was implemented based on temporal and spatial patterns of leatherback distributions; leatherback bycatch was reduced to zero following implementation of this measure [34]. This tracking study defines at least two regions within the Pacific where strategic time-area closures could be a useful management tool for protecting leatherbacks within high-use habitats. The first area is the post-nesting migration corridor spanning an open-ocean region from the Pacific coast of northwest Costa Rica (approximately 12 °N) to approximately 5 °S, within which turtles are seasonally concentrated, in predictable patterns, during the period of February–April. The second high-use area is defined by the predictable association of turtles during their dispersal phase (through putative foraging habitats) with the low EKE region of the South Pacific Gyre. Time-area closures could be applied to protect post-nesting turtles when they are seasonally concentrated during migration (i.e., while moving through the ETPS) and within international waters on the high seas during foraging periods within low EKE regions of the South Pacific Gyre. Another specific opportunity to manage turtles during dispersal occurs when they pass through the oceanic island territories of Chile (i.e., Easter Island, Juan Fernandez Islands, and the Desventuras Islands). Management actions within each of the above regions should be based upon spatio-temporal overlap of the leatherback high-use areas and areas of high bycatch. In addition to establishing time-area closures, new technologies such as vessel monitoring and tracking systems (VMS) combined with continuous satellite tagging of EP turtles (for near–real time high-use data) could further mitigate human interactions with leatherbacks.\n\nThe implementation of time-area closures to protect leatherbacks in the South Pacific would provide parallel conservation benefits for other marine species [35–42] whose movements through the ETP region have also been revealed by satellite tracking and other data. For example, recent satellite tracking studies on green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from Galápagos have indicated that February–April closures to protect green turtles would also benefit migrating leatherbacks that use similar migratory and foraging habitats with the EP [42].\n\nLarge-scale electronic tagging studies will increasingly play an important role in informing spatio-temporal management activities of coastal and pelagic habitats for threatened marine species [5]. Our results elucidate the oceanic behaviors of leatherback turtles, and are applicable to existing and future conservation strategies that promote the recovery of EP leatherbacks (Box 1). In the future, animal movement models derived from satellite-tag data, in combination with real-time oceanography [20,32,43] will provide managers with the ability to predict the movement patterns of leatherback turtles and to take effective conservation actions to protect them at sea."
