        "text": "Apparatus For and Method of Adjusting Signal Points, Equalizer Gains And The Like\n\nBackground of the invention\n\nThe present invention relates to the communication of communication signals modulated to include digital data in the form of a train of symbols over communication media utilizing a predetermined transmit constellation of signal points, and more particularly, to apparatus for and method of identifying a signal point of a receive constellation corresponding to an extracted symbol of the communication signal and adjusting said signal point to a new position of the receive constellation based on the position of the extracted symbol in relation to the current position of the signal point, said new position of the identified signal point becoming part of the receive constellation for processing at least one subsequently extracted symbol of the communication signal, and to apparatus for and method of adjusting equalizing gain factors of an equalizer based on a function of factors including the identified signal point. Presently, data communication equipment (DCE), such as modems, for example, are being used to communicate digital data between data terminal equipment (DTE), such as personal computers, workstations and the like, over telephone lines using a standard communication format or constellation of signalling points, such as the CCITT V.22 bis signalling format, for example. In transmitting and communicating digital data in a telephone network, the primary source of distortion of the communication signal is linear in nature and is handled effectively by equalization techniques implemented in the DCE's at both ends of the communication link. Most telephone lines do not induce severe enough non-linear signal distortion of the communication signal to warrant a separate processing subsystem in a modem to mitigate the non-linear effects on the standard signalling format.\n\nRecently, it has been proposed to communicate digital data over a cellular telephone network using a standard communication signalling constellation, like the CCITT V.22 bis format, for example. However, the cellular network is recognized as introducing distortive effects on the communication signal substantially different from that of the telephone network because it is designed primarily to communicate voice only signals over voice band media in which commercial channel bandwidth is severely restricted, that is the cellular network is not designed for transmitting digital data.\n\nIn the transmission of voice signals in a cellular network, the audio signal input to a microphone is generally used in controlling the instantaneous FM radio signal frequency. A limiter circuit in the transmitter limits the audio voltage before it controls the radio signal to keep it from moving too far off from its center frequency, thus reducing interchannel interference. This process is better known in the communication field as clipping and is a form of non-linear distortion of the communication signal. Accordingly, clipping is designed intentionally into the cellular transmitter of the cellular network to keep or limit radio frequency (RF) spillage over into an adjacent communication channel, that is, the limiter precludes moving the instantaneous frequency of the communication channel too far from that desired. Clipping causes amplitude group delay or non-constant group delay (amplitude induced distortion) on the digital data transmission which results in the symbols thereof becoming distorted at the receiving end to the point where the reliability thereof is questionable. That is, a distorted symbol may be closer to a signal point of a receive constellation other than that intended and misconstrued by a data estimator of the receiving modem as applying to an unintended digital data code. These non-linear effects may cause poor throughput in digital data communication between modems by creating difficulties in making initial connection, and if retransmission capabilities exist may cause retransmissions of the same data due to poor quality transmission over a preceding communication period.\n\nThere are a number of possible solutions to the non-linear distortion problem, one being designing a signalling format which is impervious to non-linearities, but any new signalling format would be non-standard and the corresponding modem application would not be capable of communicating with everybody else. Another solution may be to accept the no n-li nearly distorted communication signal using a standard signalling format and undo the distortive effects at the receiving modem.\n\nIt has been proposed theoretically to combat non-linear effects as well as linear effects on communication signals through the use of Volterra series or kernel characterization of a general non-linear system. An example of this theoretical solution is described in the paper: D.D. Falconer, \"Adaptive Equalization of Channel Non-Ïnearities in QAM Data Transmission Systems\", Bell Systems Technical Journal, Volume 57, No. 7, September, 1978. In essence, these type systems condition the received signal to render it accurate for use in a fixed signalling format using a passband decision feedback equalizer to remove both linear and non-linear effects on the incoming communication signal based on a model of the passband channel. While offering an effective theoretical technique of solving the problem, the Volterra series method is not considered practical because it is extremely computationally intensive and would probably require an additional separate processor in a modem to handle the computational load associated therewith. In addition, the Volterra series requires an extremely long time to converge to a solution which is not suitable for conventional digital communication equipment.\n\nAccordingly, what is needed is data communication equipment which can communicate digital data information at suitable throughput rates over a communication media under the effects of both linear and non-linear distortion. It is desirable that the digital communication equipment operate within a standard signalling format for digital data communication and undo the distortive effects of the communication signal using techniques which are substantially less computationally intensive and time consuming as those of the Volterra series. Summary of the Invention\n\nApparatus and corresponding method are provided for receiving a communication signal communicated over a communication medium and for processing the received signal in accordance with a received constellation of signal points to retrieve digital data thereof. The communication signal is modulated to include digital data in a form of a train of symbols based on a predetermined transmit constellation of signal points with each point thereof representing a digital code. Each symbol of the train is positioned by modulations substantially at the signal point of a transmit constellation corresponding to the digital data code intended to be represented thereby in the train. The modulated symbols of the communication signal are distortable in the communication thereof. In accordance with the present invention, the apparatus and corresponding method extracts the modulated symbols of the train from the received communication signal, identifies a signal point Sn(k) of the received constellation corresponding to an extracted symbol k based on a predetermined criteria, the signal point Sn(k) being used to retrieve the digital data code of the symbol k, and adjusts the signal point from its current position Sn(k) to a new position Sn(k+1) of the receive constellation based on the position of the extracted symbol k in relation to the current position Sn(k) for use in identifying the signal point of the receive constellation corresponding to at least one subsequently extracted symbol k+1 of the train.\n\nIn another aspect of the present invention, the apparatus and corresponding method equalizes an extracted symbol k of the train by processing the extracted symbol k and at least one other symbol of the train with corresponding equalizing gain factors to yield an equalized symbol R(k), and adjusts the equalizing gain factors in the equalizing process based on a function of factors including a difference between the equalized symbol R(k) and the identified signal point Sn(k), corresponding extracted symbols, and an adaptive gain factor, the adjusted equalizing gain factors being used in the equalizing process to equalize at least one subsequently extracted symbol k+1 of the train. A gain factor may be used in the adjustment of the signal points of the receive constellation and/or in the adjustment of the equalizing gain factors. In connection with the use of this gain factor, apparatus for and method of are provided for updating the gain factor at predetermined time periods based on a set of error signals of the respective adjustment process of which at least one error signal being updated at each predetermined time period. The apparatus and corresponding method select for each predetermined time period at least one low pass filter means for filtering the corresponding updated error signal and a corresponding absolute value means for taking the absolute value of the resultant filtered error signal to generate an intermediate signal, and combine the intermediate signals generated from the low pass filter means and corresponding absolute value means to generate a signal representative of the updated gain factor for the predetermined time periods. The representative signal may be modified to yield the updated gain factor.\n\nBrief Description of the Drawings\n\nFig. 1 is an illustration of a suitable communication network environment for applying the principles of the present invention.\n\nFig. 2 is a graph exemplifying the signal points of the CCITT V.22 bis constellation.\n\nFig. 3 is a graph exemplifying a non-linear limiting function.

Referring to Fig 1 , digital data communication may be effected from a data terminal equipment (DTE) 10 at a site 12 via a cellular telephone network 14 to another DTE 16 at a site 18 which may be a subscriber site of a public telephone system. The DTE 10 provides digital data over a conventional link 22 to a modem 20 which may be of a type manufactured by Universal Data Systems (UDS) Model No. FASTTALKâ¢ 2400/5 LP2, for example. Modem 20 is coupled over a conventional link 24 to a portable or personal cellular telephone 26 which may be of a type manufactured by Motorola under the trade name Microtac,â¢ for example. The DTE 10 causes the modem 20 to generate a communication signal which is modulated to include the digital data in the form of a train symbols based on a predetermined transmit constellation of signal points which shall be described in greater detail hereinbelow.\n\nIn the alternative, the DTE 10 may provide the digital data to a similar modem 28 of a mobile unit 30 at the site 12. The modem 28 may be switchably connected via switch 32 to a cellular phone 34 of the mobile unit 30. The switch 32 may switch between a telephone handset 36 and the modem 28. The mobile cellular phone 34 may be of the type manufactured by Motorola bearing the Model No. S1703C . Similarly, the modem 28 is caused to generate the communication signal including the digital data in the same manner as described for the portable cellular phone 26. The communication signal is, in turn, transmitted from either of the cellular phones 26 or 34 over the airwaves using conventional radio frequency carrier RF signalling to a cell site 38 of the cellular network 14 and there it is conducted through a conventional mobile telephone switching office 40 into a public switch telephone network PSTN 42 and to a central office thereof. From the central office of the PSTN, the communication signal is routed through the appropriate subscriber loop carrier system SLCS 44 and over conventional telephone lines 46 to a receiving modem 48 which may be of the same type as modems 20 and 28. Modem 48 is linked via conventional link 50 to the DTE 16 at the site 18. The modem 48 receives the communication signal including the modulated digital data thereof and processes the received modulated symbols in accordance with a receive constellation of signal points to retrieve the digital data which is provided to the DTE 16 over the link 50. The DTE 16 may, in turn, return digital data via the same route as described supra to the cellular system 14 and DTE 10 at site 12.\n\nThe DTE's 10 and 16 may communicate digital data with other DTE's at other sites, cellular or PSTN, using a similar communication signal routing arrangements. For example, the DTE 16 may also provide digital data to the modem 48 and cause it to communicate with another DTE 60 at a subscriber site 61. The DTE 60 is coupled to the public telephone network via a modem 62 and subscriber loop carrier system 64 utilizing conventional telephone line 66. In the present embodiment, the transmission of digital data from the DCE's is in the form of a train of symbols based on a predetermined transmit constellation of signal points. It is understood that the modulated symbols of the communication signal may be distorted in their relative position of the constellation of signal points as a result of linear and non-linear effects according to the transmission and communication techniques and arrangements of the communication system.\n\nAn example of a situation that results in non-linear distortion of the communication signal as a result of the transmission thereof occurs in cellular communications and more specifically the cellular telephone transmitter in which the modulated communication signal is passed through a hard limiter stage which confines the maximum frequency deviation from its center frequency to avoid interference with neighboring frequency channels of the cellular network. This limiting or clipping of the communication signal is a non-linear operation that standard telephone modems normally are not confronted with. Accordingly, performance of the telephone modem can be severely degraded to the point of useiessness if the level of non-linear distortion becomes significant to result in a substantial reduction to noise immunity. One aspect of the present invention is to increase the noise immunity of a DCE, especially with regard to non-linear signal distortion of the foregoing described type. As has been indicated above, a conventional data communication equipment (DCE) or modem transmits digital data in the form of a train of modulated symbols based on a predetermined transmit constellation of signal points. Each signal point of the transmit constellation represents a digital code. For example, the CCITT V.22 bis standard comprises a constellation of 16 unique signal points which are shown by the X's in the graph of Fig. 2. Each signal point is representative of a digital code of information and is characterized by an inphase I and quadrature Q value as a two dimensional vector, for example. A scatter plot of each of the 16 possible ideal vectors of the typical transmit constellation of Fig. 2 is shown in the Table 1 herebelow.\n\nTable 1\n\nAccordingly, each symbol or baud period of the communication signal is modulated to create a symbol positioned in the transmit constellation by the inphase and quadrature components thereof to be substantially at the signal point of the transmit constellation corresponding to the digital data code intended to be represented thereby in the train. For the V.22 bis standard, for example, there are 600 baud periods per second with each baud period containing a symbol representing 4 bits of digital data code. Consequently, at 600 baud periods per second, the V.22 bis standard is capable of communicating 2400 bits per second of digital data information. As has also been indicated above, non-linearities in the transmitting modem, receiving modem and communication media, like that illustrated in Fig. 1 , for example, may cause substantial distortion of the modulated symbols in the communication signal. The primary type of non-linearity that one might expect to deal with in cellular networks may be approximated by the following expression:\n\nVout = â ai (Vin)' i = 0\n\nThe above mathematical equation may be expressed as a sum of weighted input values raised to integer powers. For example, in the case where ao=o. ai = 1. and aj's are 0 for even i, a compressing or limiting function may be generated and mathematically expressed as follows:\n\nVout = Vin - 0.8(Vjn)3 + 0.3(Vjn)5\n\nwhich is illustrated in the graph of Fig. 3.\n\nIn operating a modem generated carrier signal through a nonÂ¬ linear function such as that illustrated in Fig. 3, it is recognized that the amplitude modulation of the carrier may be severely distorted. Since the amplitude of the carrier controls the position of the symbol or vector at the receiving end, it is clear that such amplitude distortion causes a deviation in the l,Q position of the symbol in the receive constellation. An example of such distortion of the transmitted symbols of the V.22 bis transmit constellation is shown in the graph of Fig. 4.\n\nTo complicate matters, the distorted symbol is generally conducted through general low pass and band pass filters in both the cellular transmitting and receiving data communication equipment which disperse in time the non-linear effects. By the time the transmitted symbol is received by the receiving modem, it may already have been subjected to the time-dispersive effects of the various communication filters. An additional result of the filtering of the non-linear effects is one of phase distortion as a function of signal amplitude. The graph of Fig. 5 exemplifies these phase distortive effects particularly on the outer symbols of the receive constellation.\n\nA functional block diagram schematic embodiment of portions of a data communication equipment or modem 70 suitable for use in the communications system of Fig. 1 is shown in Fig. 6. Referring to Fig. 6, the communication signal after being received by the receiving modem 70 is processed first by a set of filters and an adaptive gain control (AGC) function in a section 72 prior to being demodulated by a demodulation section 74. Each symbol of the communication signal is extracted by the processing blocks 72 and 74 as characterized by the inphase and quadrature components thereof. For example, for the kth symbol of the received train of symbols, the demodulator section 74 develops the inphase and quadrature components l(k) and Q(k), respectively, as representative thereof. The I and Q components of each extracted symbol of the train may be input to an equalizer section 76, if such a section is included in the receiving modem, for processing the effects of linear distortion of the received symbols. A suitable equalizer 76 for the puÏoses of describing the present embodiment, by way of example, is shown in Fig. 7. Equalizers of this type, which are commonly referred to as taped delay line equalizers, generally process a current symbol, which for the present example is the kth symbol along with at least one other symbol of the train which may be denoted as the k-1 for preceding symbol and k+1 for succeeding symbol. In the block diagram example of Fig. 7, delay blocks 80 of the tapped delay line may be designed to delay the communication signal 1 baud period; in which case, the signals X1 ,\n\nX2, X3 XN correspond to the symbols k, k-1, k-2 respectively.\n\nEach signal X1-XN of the tapped delay line may be processed by a corresponding equalizer gain G1-GN, respectively, and the resultant signals combined in a summer 82 to yield an equalized symbol R|(k), R-Q(k). While the above equalizer has been described as a single processing unit in connection with complex signal variables, it is understood that generally separate taped delay lines are used for each of the in phase and quadrature components of the extracted symbols with cross product interaction therebetween in the processing thereof to yield the respective equalized symbols R|(k) and RQ(k). Further, while the delays have been described as being 1 baud period, it is understood that, for some conditions, the delays may be a portion of the baud period or some multiple thereof as the case may be. Still further while the exemplary embodiment of Fig. 7 has been described with only preceding symbols, it is understood that an equalizer may also process succeeding symbols as well as without deviating from the principles of the present invention. In the instant embodiment of the receiving modem 70 as shown by the block diagram of Fig. 6, a signal point identifier 78 is provided for identifying the signal point Sn(k) of the receive constellation corresponding to the kth extracted symbol based on some predetermined criteria. The identified signal point Sn(k) is used to retrieve the digital data code of the symbol k in accordance with the receive constellation. In the present embodiment, the nearest signal point to the extracted symbol of the receive constellation is the identified signal point Sn(k).\n\nThe method used by the signal point identifier 78 for the present embodiment is illustrated by the graph of Fig. 8. While the example of Fig. 8 refers only to quadrant 1 of the receive constellation, it is understood that the principles described in relation thereto may be applied to the other 3 quadrants of the receive constellation as well. The instant example will be described in connection with the kth symbol of the received train of symbols which may be typical of any symbol thereof. The position of the signal points S (k), S2(k), S3(k) and S4(k) of the receive constellation are denoted by the dots in the graph. The position of the kth extracted symbol or vector R(k) is denoted by the X in the graph.\n\nMore specifically, the signal point identifier 78 of the instant embodiment measures an error vector from each of the signal points\n\nSÎ¹(k), ..., Sn(k) of the receive constellation to the position of the extracted symbol R(k) and then identifies the signal point corresponding to the smallest error vector as the identified signal point. In the example shown in Fig. 8, the signal point S3(k) is the nearest signal point and thus assumed to be the signal point intended to represent the digital data code of the extracted symbol. However, it is understood that amplitude and phase distortions may result in an extracted symbol with large enough positional difference to cause a selection, using the nearest signal point criteria, of a signal point which was not intended to represent the digital data code thereof. Accordingly, this is the type of problem that the present invention intends to rectify.\n\nThe cause of the misidentification under the foregoing described circumstances results from an assumption built into the design of the identifier function 78 that since the transmitted symbol is characterized by l,Q coordinates of +/-1 and +/-3, that the received corresponding symbol in the train will be clustered around the I and Q coordinates of +/-1 and +/-3, respectively as well. This assumption is normally valid for communication systems limited primarily to linear distortion, but not when the communication signal under goes non-linear distortive effects as in cellular telephone networks, for example. Thus, for the non-linear distortion case, the signal points of the receive constellation cannot remain fixed and consistent with the transmit constellation signal points, under all conditions. Rather, the signal points of the receive constellation should be adjusted based on a learning process using the distorted received symbols. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the distorted received symbols are interpreted and used to reposition the signal points of the receive constellation to more accurately identify the intended digital data code of the distorted received symbol. Unless the non-linearities are extreme in the communication system, the statistical symbol clustering about its intended signal point should be small enough to allow nearly error-free interpretation. An example of a set of repositioned signal points for a receive constellation which can interpret the incoming extracted symbols with a higher degree of accuracy is shown in the Table 2 found herebelow (refer to signal points of Fig. 5). Table 2\n\nIn the present embodiment, a signal point adjuster section 88 is provided to coordinate with the signal point identifier 78 for adjusting an identified signal point from its current position Sn(k) to a new position Sn(k+1) of the receive constellation based on the position of the extracted symbol R(k) in relation to the current position Sn(k) for use by the identifier section 78 in identifying the signal point of the receive constellation corresponding to at least one subsequently extracted symbol R(k+1 ) of the symbol train.\n\nA block diagram schematic of a suitable signal point adjuster for use in the embodiment of Fig. 6 is shown in Fig. 9. Referring to Fig. 9, the identified signal point Sn(k) is subtracted from the extracted symbol R(k), which may be equalized if an equalizer section is provided in the receiving modem or which otherwise is unequalized, in a summer unit 90 to generate an error signal En(k) which is adjusted by a gain factor 92 to generate an adjusted error signal 94. In the present embodiment, the error signal En(k) is multiplied by the gain factor 92 in a multiplier unit 96. The adjusted error signal 94 is combined with the current position Sn(k) of the identified signal point to estimate a new position Sn(k+1 ) thereof. A delay block 96 is provided to cause a 1 symbol period delay between the current and new positions of the identified signal point and a summer 98 is used to add the adjusted error signal to the current signal point in the present embodiment. Accordingly, each signal point Sn of the receive constellation may be adjusted when identified as the nearest signal point to the corresponding symbol in this manner. Consequently, the signal point adjuster 88 learns over a period of time in dealing with many received distorted symbols how to adjust the signal points of the receive constellation to new positions in order to optimize the digital data estimation of the received symbols in the identifier section 78.\n\nIt is recognized that all of the error of the received distorted symbol may not be due to non-linear effect, thus the gain factor 92 of the embodiment of Fig. 9 is used to slow the adaption process so that it will not converge to an erroneous signal point position using only a few corresponding symbols. The gain factor 92 limits the amount of repositioning or correction applied to the appropriate signal point to a fraction of the last detected error. Accordingly, the adaption or correction process is thus spread over a greater number of symbols, that is intentionally inducing a lag effect or low pass filtering action into the signal point adjuster control loop making it less sensitive to erratic symbol disturbances due to noise, etc. and more sensitive to the slowly varying non-linear effects of the signal point of interest.\n\nThe signal point adjuster control loop embodiment depicted in Fig. 9 processes variables which are complex in nature including the inphase I and quadrature Q components thereof. However, it is understood that two separate control loops may be used to process respectively the in phase and quadrature components of such variables without deviating from the principles of the present invention. In addition, while only a single complex control loop has been described for processing the identified signal point and storing the adjusted position thereof in a table in memory, such as the Table 2 shown hereabove, it is understood that, in the alternative, a separate complex control loop may be provided for each signal point of the receive constellation; in which case, the adjusted signal point value may be provided in the output register or registers thereof for use by the identifier section 78 in connection with the subsequently extracted symbol k+1 of the train.\n\nThe gain factor 92 of the signal point adjuster embodiment may be a constant, or time varying, or adaptive in accordance with some variable. For example, the gain factor may be set to a high level allowing the control loop or loops to learn quickly, and then reduced to a smaller value after a fixed period of time in order to stabilize the steady state performance of the loop. In the alternative, an adaptive gain factor adjustment system may be able to sense whenever the stored signal points, such as that depicted in Table 2, for example, show a trend of misalignment with resent incoming receive signals. When this occurs, the gain may be set ideally large. When the stored signal points are fairly well centered in individual clusters by the received symbols, adaptation may be considered complete and the gain factor set at a smaller value. One method of effecting such an adaptive control of the gain factor at a symbol period is to concentrate on the identified signal point assuming first that it is set to a proper position in the receive constellation. Noise causes non-zero error factors between the corresponding symbols and the signal point; however, the I and Q components of the error factors due to noise alone will each be, on the average, zero. Inputting the error vector components into a corresponding pair of low pass filters associated with the corresponding signal point will result in the filtered outputs staying very near zero. On the other hand, if the error factors of the signal point are consistently too far to the left and also too high above a proper signal point setting, for example, then these error factors are not considered as being caused solely by noise, but rather include non-linear effects as well. In this example, the I component of the error vector will generally read positive and the Q component negative. Inputting the I and Q components of the error vector into respective low pass fitters will result in the I filter output growing to a positive value, and the Q filter output growing to a negative value. The fact that the low pass filter outputs have grown to relatively large values, positive or negative, is sufficient to indicate that the corresponding signal point is in the wrong position of the received constellation, which in turn implies that a large gain factor for the signal point adjuster is needed to render a quicker adjustment. A functional block diagram schematic suitable for embodying the principles of such an adaptive gain factor adjuster is shown in Fig. 10. Referring to Fig 10, a pair of low pass filters is provided respectively for the inphase and quadrature errors of each signal point identifiable by the signal point adjuster. The identified pair of error vectors En|(k) and EnQ(k) are routed to the appropriate low pass filter pair by a demultiplexer unit 100 using selector signal n. The outputs of the low pass filters are each input to an absolute value section which is used to sense a \"buildup\" on any filter output, positive or negative. The outputs of the absolute value sections are then combined in a summer 102 to produce a signal 104 which is representative of the new or adjusted gain factor. The signal 104 may be modified by multiplying it by a fixed gain G in a multiplier unit 106 to yield the new or adjusted gain factor 92 which is used in the signal point adjuster embodiment of Fig. 9 to process the subsequently extracted symbol k+1.\n\nTo summarize, in the situation in which the stored signal points are in their proper locations of the received constellation, the error vectors in relation to the extracted symbols of the received communication signal will render no trends statistically and the respective outputs of their low pass filters will stay at substantially zero. Accordingly, the absolute values thereof and resultant composite summation also stays near zero. A relatively small gain factor is yielded implying that little or no adjustment is desired in the signal points of the received constellation, that is, the desired effect of adaptation is considered substantially completed. On the other hand, when some or all of the signal points of the receive constellation move out of their proper positions statistically, the filtered error signals grow in value over time which causes a net increase in the gain factor 92 to cause a repositioning of the signal points at a faster rate.\n\nIn an alternate embodiment, the gain factor of each control loop of the signal point adjuster 88 may be individually adaptively adjusted as illustrated by the functional block diagram schematic of Fig. 11. The control loop of the nth signal point, by way of example, is represented by the block 110 and may be similar to that described in connection with the embodiment of Fig. 9. The resultant complex error En(k) may be input to a conventional low pass filter (LPF) 112. The filtered error signal of the LPF 112 may be input to an absolute value circuit (ABS) 114. The output of the ABS 114 may be modified by a fixed gain GF in a multiplier section 116 to effect the individual gain factor for the control loop n. Accordingly, the individual gain factor of each control loop is adjusted adaptively based on its corresponding error signal or difference between the extracted symbol, equalized or otherwise, and the identified signal point associated therewith.\n\nIn another aspect of the present invention, the gains G1-GN of the equalizer 76 may be adjusted to new values using an equalizer gain adjuster 120 which is coupled to the equalizer 76 as shown in the block diagram schematic of Fig. 6. A functional schematic diagram of an equalizer gain adjuster suitable for embodying the principles of this aspect of the present invention is shown in Fig. 12. The embodiment of Fig. 12 adjusts the gain factors Gj of the equalizer 76 based on a function of factors including a difference between the equalized symbol R(k) and the identified signal point SN(k), the corresponding extracted symbols Xj of the equalizer, and an adaptive gain factor. The equalizing gain factors are adjusted for one extracted symbol K and used by the equalizer 76 to process at least one subsequently extracted symbol K+1 of the train of symbols. Referring to Fig. 12, the identified signal point Sn(k) is subtracted from the equalized extracted symbol R(k) in a summer 122 to yield a difference or error signal En(k). The error signal En(k) is adjusted by an adaptive gain factor 124 in a multiplier unit 126. In addition, the result of the foregoing described adjustment is used to multiply a signal Xj(k)* representative of each symbol i of the equalizing mean to generate corresponding gain error signals ej(k) utilizing the same multiplier unit 126. In turn, each gain error signal ej(k) is combined with its corresponding equalizing gain factor Gj(k) in a summer 128 to generate corresponding adjusted equalizing gain factors Gj(k+1) for use by the equalizer 76. A delay function 130 may separate the adjusted equalizing gain factors from the current equalizing gain factors during the combination process. The adaptive gain 124 used in the embodiment of Fig. 12 may be produced by either of the adaptive gain factor adjustment embodiments described in connection with either Fig. 10 or Fig. 11.\n\nMore specifically, when using the adaptive gain factor adjustment embodiment of Fig. 10, the individual gain error signals ej(k) are selectively input either in complex form or their inphase and quadrature component form to the respective low pass filter and absolute value sections utilizing the demultiplexer 100. Accordingly, the outputs of the absolute value sections are combined in the summer 102 and modified by the fixed gain factor G in the multiplier 106 to produce the adaptive gain factor 124 for use in the gain adjuster 120 for the subsequently extracted symbol R(k+1) of the train. Similarly, when using the embodiment of Fig. 11 to generate individual adaptive gains in adjusting the equalizer gains Gj, each error signal ej(k) is input to a corresponding low pass filter 112 which is cascaded with an absolute value section 114. The resultant signal is modified by the gain GF in the multiplexer 116 to yield the corresponding individual adaptive gain which is used for the subsequently extracted symbol k+1. In this manner, the gains of the equalizer 76 may be adjusted with an adaptive gain factor based on a function of the generated error signals ej(k).\n\nThe apparatus described in connection with the embodiment of Fig. 6 may be implemented in a digital signal processor which may be of the type manufactured by NEC Corporation bearing Model No. 77P25 or 77C25, for example. In this regard, Figs. 13a and 13b exemplify a program flowchart for use in implementing the foregoing described functions in the digital signal processor. A signal point adjuster algorithm begins at block 140 in Fig. 13a in which the vector R(k), equalized or otherwise, is developed from the received communication signal either in complex form or in the form of its individual inphase and quadrature components R|(k) and RQ(k), respectively. Next, in block 142 the nearest signal point Sn(k) to the vector R(k) becomes the identified signal point of the receive constellation corresponding to R(k). In block 144, the error vector E(k) is computed as the difference between the nearest signal point Sn(k) and the vector R(k). In some circumstances, some of the signal points of the receive constellation are predetermined as being unadjustable especially when an equalizer function is provided in the receiving modem. These unadjustable signal points, which may be those signal points of the receive constellation closest to the origin thereof, are referred to in the instant embodiment as \"anchor\" points. The intent is to inhibit the signal point adjuster from adjusting those identified signal points which are predetermined to be \"anchor\" points, which is accomplished in the next decisional block 146. If the decision block 146 identifies the signal point Sn(k) as being an \"anchor\" point.the program execution bypasses the signal point adjustment process. Otherwise, the next block to be executed is 148 wherein the signal point is adjusted based on an adaptive gain factor and the difference between the identified signal point and extracted vector. In block 150, the gain is adaptively adjusted in accordance with the routine shown in Fig. 13b. Referring to Fig. 13b, to start with, in block 152, a low pass filter associated with the identified signal point Sn is selected. When using the in phase and quadrature component of the error signal, the outputs of the selected in phase and quadrature low pass filters are updated based on using the respective in phase and quadrature error signals as inputs in the blocks 154 and 156. Next, in block 158 the absolute values of the in phase and quadrature low pass filter outputs are taken and combined by summation in the block 160. The adaptive gain factor is computed in block 162 by modifying the summation of block 160 by a fixed gain represented by G which may be on the order of 0.2, for example. The adaptive gain then is used in block 148 of the signal point adjustment subroutine of Fig. 13a for processing the next extracted symbol R(k+1). It is worth noting that while the various aspects of the present invention have been identified in accordance with the foregoing described embodiment, it is understood that additions, deletions, and modifications may be made thereto without deviating from the broad principles thereof. Accordingly, the various aspects of the present invention should not be limited to any single embodiment, but rather construed in broad scope and breadth in accordance with the recitation of the appended claims."
