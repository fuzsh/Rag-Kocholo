        "text": "Ports\n\nPORTS is a free distance learning program that helps schools teach common core state standards in the context of California State Parks. It uses the power of California’s K-12 High-Speed Network (HSN) and the educational potential of live videoconferencing.\n\nThe PORTS program provides teachers and students with lesson plans, digital video, digital images and media materials from the program’s website. These materials prepare students and teachers to use PORTS to deliver real-time, two-way audio and video communication between the classroom and a State park This live videoconferencing allows park staff to look directly at students sitting miles away in a classroom and engage them in conversation.\n\nIn this way, PORTS gives students access to park experts regardless of the students’ geographic location or economic status. In 2015/2016 PORTS reached over 46,000 K-12 students in California, the majority of which were in schools federally classified at low-income.\n\nThese live, interactive presentations include science, history, language arts and other academics. They are part of fully developed units of study that include support and follow up.\n\n“Treasuring the Kelp Forest” presented from Point Lobos State Natural Reserve is a relatively recent addition to the study units now available through PORTS.\n\nThe PORTS website at www.ports.parks.ca.gov provides more information about the program. This includes a description of some of the units of study available, as well as key State Parks contacts for the program.\n\nA Tablet App for exploring Point Lobos State Natural Reserve. Free on the Google Play Store or Apple’s App Store. Recommended for ages 7 to 107.\n\nThis fun and feature-packed app provides an interactive experience while you take a virtual walk and learn about the animals, plants, and geological features that are found at the Reserve. Exceptional videos and detailed photos provide a personal connection with all the natural wonders of Point Lobos, including the striking geologic formation that forms the boundary with the sea.\n\nPlay the Food Web game, and as you unlock the secrets of the web of life you’ll learn the names of over 90 animal and plant species that rely on each other to survive and to provide the balance required for healthy biodiversity.\n\nTry your hand at balancing the ecosystem of a tide pool with a fast-paced and constantly changing mix of plants and critters that call it their home. Or take a tour through history and meet the many people who lived and worked at Point Lobos and find out why we all must protect this important natural environment for generations to come.\n\nSpecial thanks to the California State Parks Foundation, the Nancy Buck Ransom Foundation, the Yellow Brick Road Benefit Shop of Carmel and the many generous individuals who supported this project\n\nOf the dozens of people who participated in the making of the Discover Point Lobos App, we would like to thank the following for recognizing the possibilities that this app has in furthering the knowledge and love for all things wild and natural: Dr. Sylvia Earle for her narration of the Welcome to Point Lobos video, Tierney Thys, Linda Yamane, Kim Weston, and Kip Evans, who developed the app and provided most of the videos and photos."
