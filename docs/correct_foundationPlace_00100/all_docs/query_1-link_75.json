        "text": "NOAA will bring thousands of K-12 teachers and students around the country outside for hands-on environmental education opportunities through funding awarded in fiscal year 2015. Eighty-four new and continuing projects benefit from a total of over $7 million in funding for the NOAA Office of Education’s Bay Watershed Education and Training (B-WET) program.\n\nB-WET is an environmental education program that promotes locally relevant, authentic experiential learning focused on K–12 audiences. B-WET funding is provided through competitive grants that promote Meaningful Watershed Educational Experiences (MWEEs). MWEEs are multi-stage activities that include learning both outdoors and in the classroom, and aim to increase the understanding and stewardship of watersheds and related ocean, coastal, riverine, estuarine, and Great Lakes ecosystems of all participants. NOAA funding is provided for teachers to support student investigation of environmental topics both locally and globally that are of interest to them. Students identify actions to address these issues and understand the value of those actions.\n\nIn 2015, funded activities include a cultural and natural history exchange program with the Suquamish Tribe in Washington State, bringing together high school students from different regions in the Pacific Rim to share common ideas, values, and traditional ways of knowing. In the Gulf of Mexico, funds support a project that teaches teachers and students how marine debris affects our marine environment. With an interactive website entitled Watershed Experience Tracker, and through waterway cleanup initiatives, teachers and students will learn how the choices we all make can have a substantial impact on neighboring communities and habitats, including marine environments. In California, student mentoring teams including STEM professionals will engage in the STEM disciplines and actively participate in Santa Barbara Channel research by assembling and collecting data with marine remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) in order to implement long-term monitoring protocols, analyze historical data-sets, and construct scientific reports and outreach projects.\n\n“B-WET-funded professional development enhances teachers’ skill and confidence in using environmental education to address multiple subjects’ curriculum standards and local education agency initiatives,” said Louisa Koch, Director of Education at NOAA. \"Teachers and education professionals involved with the B-WET program are equipped with information they can share with their students and communities for years.\"\n\nThe MWEE approach is based on research literature, evaluation results and lessons learned over a decade of program implementation. The B-WET national evaluation system, which began data collection in 2014, enables the program to monitor and adjust program activities as a result of new information about best practices, and to support grantees in implementing those practices.\n\nB-WET currently serves seven areas of the country: California, Chesapeake Bay, Great Lakes, the Gulf of Mexico, Hawaiʻi, New England, and the Pacific Northwest. Awards in the Great Lakes region are made possible by funds from the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.\n\nNew 2015 B-WET projects, by region, are:\n\nPlease Note: Award amounts listed are amount provided in fiscal year 2015 only and may not reflect the full amount of the award over all years.\n\nCalifornia\n\nRecipient Project State Amount Lompoc Unified School District Aquarium SeaQuest Program Lompoc, CA $36,015 Multicultural Education for Resource Issues Threatening Oceans Foundation, Inc.
