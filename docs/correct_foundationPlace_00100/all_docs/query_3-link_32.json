Instead, Seidman suggests buying gifts that will spark conversation and are not as costly, such as books. If you do want to buy front-row seats to a game or concert, attend it with the client.\n\nThe same caution should be applied to accepting gifts. There is often a fine line between what a company”s policy will allow and what is appropriate, Seidman said. If a gift is too lavish, motives should be evaluated.\n\n“Gifts are vague and often can be deceptive in terms of what they are intended to do and whether they will result in a conflict of interest, a bribe or appearance of impropriety,” Seidman said.\n\n|— Staff and wire reports"
