If you have any questions or comments relating to our website or the privacy policy, contact us by telephone at (800) 640-5137.\n\nWhat is a ticket?\n\nA \"ticket\" is the industry-wide term that refers to the document you submit through USA North 811, which request the utility members to mark or locate their facilities at your worksite. After submitting your ticket (online or over the phone), you will receive a ticket number that is the reference number for your individual request. Make sure to keep the ticket number assigned to your request for at least the duration of the excavation and preferably longer for your records.\n\nI’m not digging very deep; should I submit a ticket?\n\nYes. You should contact 811 no matter how deep you are digging, since many cables and pipes lie at extremely shallow depths. If you’re ready to submit a ticket, please click here.\n\nHow do I know which utilities were notified of my request?\n\nAt the bottom of your ticket is a list of the utility members we notified for you. If you listed an email address on your request, you should receive a copy of your ticket via email.\n\nWhat are my responsibilities when requesting an area to be check for lines?\n\nProvide correct address/site location information and correct locating instructions.\n\nProvide valid contact information and respond to questions from utility personnel.\n\nMake sure the address is clearly posted at the site.\n\nProvide open access to the property (gates unlocked, animals contained, etc.).\n\nWrite down and follow the dates and times when your request becomes legally active, when it expires, and when it must be updated.\n\nKeep the ticket number assigned to your request for at least the duration of the excavation and preferably longer for your records. The number is proof of your request through USA North 811 and allows us to quickly find your request.\n\nI submitted my 811 request, when can I start digging?\n\nYou can begin your excavation once the following conditions have been met:\n\n· It is beyond the start time listed on the ticket or the legal notice (two working days’ notice not including the day of notification), whichever is later, has passed and all notified utility members have positively responded to your request.\n\nIf the start date and time for your ticket has passed, and one or more of our utility members has yet to respond to your request, please refrain from digging and contact 811 as soon as possible by dialing 8-1-1 so that we may notify the utility member(s) in question regarding their no response. You are not clear to dig until you receive a response from all utility members on your ticket. If you need a copy of your ticket to verify which utility members were notified, please click the “Get a Copy of your Ticket” button located under the “Quick Links’ section at the top of our website.\n\nWho marks the utility lines?\n\nEach utility member is responsible to locate their own facilities. Some utility members utilize in-house locators, while others hire 3rd party locators to mark for them. USA North 811 is not a locating service.\n\nDo I need to pre-mark my dig site?\n\nYes. Show the utility members exactly where you plan to dig by pre-marking your dig site with white paint. If you don’t have white paint available, you can also use white stakes, white flags, white whiskers, white chalk and even white baking flour. If you neglect to pre-mark your dig site, the utility members may choose not to locate their facilities. For further information regarding pre-marking or delineating your dig site, please watch our \"How to Premark\" instructional video.\n\nWhich lines are going to be marked at my site?\n\nThe utility members notified on your ticket are responsible to mark or locate the facilities they own and operate at your dig site. Private utility lines (landscape irrigation and lighting, natural gas line to a barbeque, electrical line to a detached garage or shed, etc) will not be marked since they are not owned by a utility.\n\nI’ve damaged an underground utility line, what do I do?\n\nIf the damaged utility line poses a threat to life, health, or public safety, evacuate the worksite (300’ or more upwind from damage) and contact 911 to dispatch emergency services. If you discover or cause any damage (breaks, leaks, nicks, dents, gouges, grooves, or other damage to subsurface installation lines, conduits, coatings, or cathodic protection) you must immediately report it to the affected utility member. You can get the emergency contact information for the damaged utility owner by contacting 811 and notify them that you have damaged a facility at your worksite. Never attempt to fix, repair, pinch, squeeze, zip tie, or bury the damaged facility.\n\nThere are utility markings in the area where I planned to dig, how do I proceed?\n\nWhen digging in an area around utility lines, it is critical that you follow the tolerance zone guidelines. The tolerance zone is an area 24” on either side of the outside diameter (or center line if diameter isn’t provided) of the marked utility line. In the tolerance zone, you are required to excavate using only human powered hand tools.\n\nAre you owned or operated by a utility company? Are you a state agency? Who funds your operation?\n\nUSA North 811 is a 501(c)(6) non-profit organization funded by over 1,500 utility owners and governed by 34 board members elected from the membership. We are not directly owned or operated by any utility company and are not an agency of the state of California or Nevada.\n\nWho is responsible to clean up or remove the paint markings after a job is complete?\n\nWe recommend that the excavator or person/company requesting the marks to remove the markings when the work is complete. It is the excavator’s responsibility to protect the markings during the excavation, and because they are the only ones who know when a job is done and are also the party that requested the markings, it is recommended that they be the ones who remove the markings when the job is complete.\n\nCan I submit my 811 request online?\n\nDue to high call volumes and increased excavation activity, our 811 phone lines can at times become backlogged with callers waiting to submit their request. Because of this, we always advise our customers to submit their requests online instead. You can sign up for our online ticket system here.\n\nI forgot to submit my 811 request and I’m supposed to start my work tomorrow; can I submit an emergency request?\n\nAll excavation requests require a minimum of two working days’ notice prior to the start of excavation. State law identifies which factors qualify a request as an emergency, and if your excavation does not meet those requirements you cannot submit an emergency request. To see if your excavation meets the requirements of an emergency notification, please see the state specific emergency definitions below:\n\nCalifornia: “Emergency” means a sudden, unexpected occurrence, involving a clear and imminent danger, demanding immediate action to prevent or mitigate loss of, or damage to, life, health, property, or essential public services.\n\nNevada: “Emergency” means a sudden, unexpected occurrence that involves clear and imminent danger and requires immediate action to prevent or mitigate loss of life or damage to health, property or essential public services.\n\nI lost my ticket number, where can I look it up?\n\nIf you provided us with your email address when you submitted your ticket you would have received a copy of your ticket. Check your email inbox and see if you can find the email copy we sent you. Or you can get a copy of your ticket through your online account. If you still cannot find your ticket, please call 811 and advise the customer service representative that you need help looking up your ticket number.\n\nHow will I know if all of the utility members on my ticket have responded to my request?\n\nThe utility members listed on your ticket can respond in a number of different ways, including marking the location of their underground facilities at your site, contacting you via email or phone to advise you that your site is clear from any conflict with their underground facilities, or by providing you information about the location of their underground facilities such as maps or as-built plans.

After submitting your ticket (online or over the phone), you will receive a ticket number that is the reference number for your individual request.

Make sure to keep the ticket number assigned to your request for at least the duration of the excavation and preferably longer for your records.\n\nI’m not digging very deep; should I submit a ticket?\n\nYes.

You are not clear to dig until you receive a response from all utility members on your ticket. If you need a copy of your ticket to verify which utility members were notified, please click here.\n\nWho marks the utility lines?\n\nEach utility member is responsible to locate their own facilities. Some utility members utilize in house locators, while others hire 3rdparty locators to mark for them. USA North 811 is not a locating service.\n\nDo I need to pre-mark my dig site?\n\nYes. Show the utility members exactly where you plan to dig by pre-marking your dig site with white paint. If you don’t have white paint available, you can also use white stakes, white flags, white whiskers, white chalk and even white baking flour. If you neglect to pre-mark your dig site, the utility members may choose not to locate their facilities. For further information regarding pre-marking or delineating your dig site, please watch our “How to Premark” instructional video\".\n\nWhich lines are going to be marked at my site?\n\nThe utility members notified on your ticket are responsible to mark or locate the facilities they own and operate at your dig site. Private utility lines (landscape irrigation and lighting, natural gas line to a barbeque, electrical line to a detached garage or shed, etc) will not be marked since they are not owned by a utility.\n\nI’ve damaged an underground utility line, what do I do?\n\nIf the damaged utility line poses a threat to life, health, or public safety, evacuate the worksite (300’ or more upwind from damage) and contact 911 to dispatch emergency services. If you discover or cause any damage (breaks, leaks, nicks, dents, gouges, grooves, or other damage to subsurface installation lines, conduits, coatings, or cathodic protection) you must immediately report it to the affected utility member. You can get the emergency contact information for the damaged utility owner by contacting 811 and notify them that you have damaged a facility at your worksite. Never attempt to fix, repair, pinch, squeeze, zip tie, or bury the damaged facility.\n\nThere are utility markings in the area where I planned to dig, how do I proceed?\n\nWhen digging in an area around utility lines, it is critical that you follow the tolerance zone guidelines. The tolerance zone is an area 24” on either side of the outside diameter (or center line if diameter isn’t provided) of the marked utility line. In the tolerance zone, you are required to excavate using only human powered hand tools. For more information about the tolerance zone and hand digging requirements, please click here for California & Nevada requirements .\n\nAre you owned or operated by a utility company? Are you a state agency? Who funds your operation?\n\nUSA North 811 is a 501(c)(6) non-profit organization funded by over 1,500 utility owners and governed by 34 board members elected from the membership. We are not directly owned or operated by any utility company and are not an agency of the state of California or Nevada.\n\nWhat does it cost to submit an 811 request?\n\nSubmitting a utility locate request to USA North 811 for your planned dig project is free of charge. The utility members bear the burden of funding the center and the cost of locating the utilities in an effort to provide the public a free service that will prevent or limit damage to underground utilities.\n\nI see spray paint markings at my property, how can I find out who is doing work?\n\nHave you recently hired a contractor to do work at your property (fence project, new pool, landscaping, utility repair, etc)? If so, the markings are most likely due to the contractor submitting an 811 request for your property for that project. Markings at your site might also be due to work that is being done by one of your neighbors if that work is taking place near your shared property line. If you haven’t hired anyone to work at your property, and you have verified with your neighbor that they haven’t as well, please email our Operations Team (centeroperations@usanorth811.org) so they can look and see if there are any open tickets for your address.\n\nWho is responsible to clean up or remove the paint markings after a job is complete?\n\nWe recommend that the excavator or person/company requesting the marks to remove the markings when the work is complete. It is the excavator’s responsibility to protect the markings during the excavation, and because they are the only ones who know when a job is done and are also the party that requested the markings, it is recommended that they be the ones who remove the markings when the job is complete.\n\nCan I submit my 811 request online?\n\nDue to high call volumes and increased excavation activity, our 811 phone lines can at times become backlogged with callers waiting to submit their request. Because of this, we always advise our customers to submit their requests online instead. If you are working at an address, you can submit your ticket online quickly and easily at www.811express.com. If you are working at any other type of location other than an address, you can sign up for our E-Ticket program that will allow you to submit any type of location online.

Please note the “update by” date on your ticket.\n\nHow deep are the utility lines buried?\n\nThe depth of utilities varies by location and by type of utility. An underground pipe or cable may no longer be at the same depth as when it was originally buried if grading, leveling, erosion or other nearby surface activity has taken place.
