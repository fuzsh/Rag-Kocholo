        "text": "Board of Directors\n\nJOHN B. O’SULLIVAN, President\n\nHome: Pacific Grove\n\nBackground: Growing up, John was fascinated with California’s marine life. From the tide pools to the open ocean, invertebrates, sharks, rays, bony fishes, marine mammals, and sea birds captured his attention. Today, John has been collecting marine animals and conducting field and captive research for more than 41 years. He began his career as a volunteer at Scripps Institution of Oceanography’s (SIO) Aquarium, collecting specimens for public display and education. Next, he moved into SIO’s Marine Biology Research Division as a volunteer and as a technician with the Sea Grant Program. In 1986, he joined the staff at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. John enjoys the blending of his collecting responsibilities with captive and field research that includes a wide variety of species that live along the eastern Pacific, including the Gulf of California, Mexico.\n\nALAN ARVIN, Vice President\n\nHome: San Luis Obispo\n\nBackground: After earning his master’s degree in his home state of Kentucky, Alan began his career in Pennsylvania as a systems engineer—specifically in robotics and vision systems applied to high-volume manufacturing—at American Cimflex. He then moved to California to join the West Coast’s growing tech industry as a systems engineer at SUN Microsystems and Director of IT at Trimble Navigation. Alan leveraged his experience as a consultant for emerging companies and eventually co-founded two tech-consulting companies that were later acquired: The Trilliance Group and Demand Solutions Group, now a part of Oracle.\n\nAfter 30 years in tech, Alan shifted his efforts to marine conservation and community engagement around environmental protection, a passion that blossomed over his years spent on the central coast of California. Between his home on the California central coast and the high desert of New Mexico, Alan volunteers his time with environmental organizations that strive to educate and conserve natural beauty and habitats, from the desert to the sea.\n\nSEAN POWELL, Treasurer\n\nHome: Pacific Grove\n\nDegrees: Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, California State University, Monterey Bay\n\nBackground: Sean was born and raised on the Monterey Peninsula having lived in Pacific Grove for the last ten years. He remembers coming to the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History as a student and again with his own children years later. Sean is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) that has worked in a local CPA firm for the last five years with an increasing emphasis on non-profits. Having enjoyed the museum and the beautiful outdoors that the central coast has to offer, he appreciates the education and value the Museum provides to the community and is grateful to be a member of the board.\n\nMATTHEW DENECOUR, Secretary\n\nHome: Pacific Grove\n\nDegrees: Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo; Master of Education, Framingham State University (Massachusetts)\n\nBackground: Matt’s love of museums probably stems from childhood trips to the Field Museum, and the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. More recently, he has been a volunteer at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science and now at the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History as a monarch docent. As a retired educator, Matt loves how museums can spark a child’s interest and inspire a love of life-long learning. He is grateful to serve on the board and believes that the building and collections are just a part of what the PGMNH is, and that the education and citizen-science functions carried out by the staff and volunteers vastly expands the museum’s impact in the community.\n\nALEXIS BUNTEN\n\nHome: Del Rey Oaks\n\nDegrees: Bachelor of Arts in Art History, Dartmouth College; PhD in Cultural Anthropology, UCLA\n\nBackground: After receiving her BA, Alexis returned to Alaska, where she worked at the Sealaska Heritage Institute, and the Alaska Native Heritage Center in programming. Subsequent to receiving her PhD, Alexis served as the Project Ethnographer for the Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage (IPinCH) project, and as a Senior Researcher at the FrameWorks Institute.\n\nAlexis is an accomplished researcher, writer, media-maker, and curriculum developer. She has published widely about Indigenous and environmental issues, with articles in American Indian Quarterly, the Journal of Museum Education and American Ethnologist. Her 2015 book, “So, how long have you been Native?” Life as an Alaska Native Tour Guide” won the Alaska Library Association Award for its originality, and depth. In addition to writing, Alexis has contributed to several Indigenous-themed productions, including co-producing and writing the script for a documentary nominated for the Native American Film Awards. Alexis has developed educational material for both formal and informal learning environments including university level-courses as well as lifelong learner curriculum.\n\nWALAN CHANG\n\nHome: Marina\n\nDegrees: Bachelor of Science in with an emphasis on East Asia, University of the State of New York; Master of Science in Applied Marine & Watershed Science, California State University Monterey Bay\n\nBackground: Walan grew up in Texas and joined the Air Force soon after high school.

When she retired, she returned to Monterey. Walan now serves on multiple committees in the VA Palo Alto Health Care System, including as the Co-Chair of the Veteran and Family Advisory Committee. She is also a kitten foster parent for South County Animal Rescue and manages its Adoption Center.
