        "text": "Farmers for Soil Health Climate-Smart Commodities Partnership (Finalized)\n\nThis project proposes to accelerate long-term cover crop adoption by creating a platform to incentivize farmers. The platform will quantify, verify, and facilitate the sale of ecosystem benefits, creating a marketplace to generate demand for climate-smart commodities. This project plans to support the implementation of more than 1 million acres of crop crops across 20 states. It also plans to enable corn and soybean commodity groups to achieve greenhouse gas emission reduction goals while supporting their farmer members and advancing more productive and sustainable practices, using remote sensing, satellite imagery and other data science techniques while “ground-truthing” with a statistically significant set of soil samples from participating fields and a marketplace interface powered by an integrated monitoring, reporting and verification platform. The project includes a 20 percent reserve for underserved producers and a survey plan to assist with recruitment.\n\nLead Partner: National Fish & Wildlife Foundation\n\nOther Major Partners: Farmers for Soil Health (National Corn Growers Association, the United Soybean Board, and the National Pork Board), National Center for Appropriate Technology, National Association of Conservation Districts, Soil Health Institute, University of Missouri, The Sustainability Consortium, Data Transmission Network, MBSH Consulting.\n\nAvailable States: IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, MN, MI, MO, NE, OH, SD, TN, ND, NC, MD, DE, NY, WI, PA, VA\n\nMajor Commodities: Corn, Soybeans\n\nAgreement Amount: $95,000,000\n\nMidwest Climate-Smart Commodity Program\n\nThis project will build markets and provide funding to farmers via outcome-based contracts for the reduction and removal of carbon dioxide through the adoption of new climate-smart practices. The remaining project funding will support farmer enrollment assistance, carbon quantification, technical assistance support, measurement, reporting and verification, and underserved farmer outreach and enrollment. Monitoring for this project is planned to include remote sensing, field inspections, farmer operational records, field audits and soil sampling. They plan to account for and track both nitrous oxide (N2O) emission reductions and soil carbon sequestration separately at the field level. The project also plans to reserve 20% of contracts for underserved populations supported by dedicated conservation agronomist technical assistance.\n\nLead Partner: Iowa Soybean Association\n\nOther Major Partners: PepsiCo**, Cargill**, Renewable Energy Group**, Ingredion**, Target**, JBS**, Coca-Cola**, FarmRaise, Rural Community Assistance Partnership, AgOutcomes*\n\nPrimary States Expected: IL, IN, IA, KS, NE, ND, OH, WI, SD, MO, MI, MN\n\nMajor Commodities: Corn, Soybeans, Wheat, Sugar Beets\n\nApproximate Funding Ceiling: $95,000,000\n\nStrengthening Grassroots Leadership and Capacity to Scale Climate-Smart Production Systems and Facilitate Underserved Producers' Access to Markets\n\nThis project will work through its network of 3,000 conservation districts throughout the nation to grow and advance grassroots efforts to ensure producers and local communities are prepared to meet the demand and have access to climate-smart commodity markets. Project plans to support implementation of climate-smart practices like cover crops, nutrient management plans, forest stand management, prescribed grazing and forage and biomass planting. Planned marketing efforts include identifying strategies for building acres or products. The project plans to use COMET-Planner and/or other data models (e.g., Truterra Sustainability Tool, SYMFONI) to identify practice options that maximize carbon sequestration. HabiTerre’s technology and quantification solution – SYMFONI – captures the trade-offs and synergistic effects of the system of conservation practices implemented; HabiTerre plans to develop a farmer-facing dashboard that summarizes producers’ historical GHG emissions (e.g., soil organic carbon changes, N2O emissions, and CH4 emissions/uptake) at the field and farm levels. NACD plans to verify soil organic carbon (SOC) changes through soil sampling on a representative subset of fields. The project plans to support development of climate-smart market opportunities that benefit local economies and identify strategies for bundling acres or products, provide additional education on Scope 3 protocols and traceability, and what is needed to participate in climate-smart commodity markets. NACD also plans to cultivate national partnerships that facilitate access to growing climate-smart markets. Of the producers enrolled, over half are planned to be underserved producers. The project also plans to invest in the Indian Nations Conservation Alliance (INCA) and organizations that serve tribal producers, as well as Rural Coalition and their members, the Rural Advancement Fund of the National Sharecroppers Fund and Kansas Black Farmers Association to strengthen Conservation Districts’ outreach to historically underserved communities and producers.\n\nLead Partner: National Association of Conservation Districts\n\nOther Major Partners: Indian Nations Conservation Alliance (INCA)*, Rural Coalition*, the Kansas Black Farmers Association*, and the Rural Advancement Fund of the National Sharecroppers Fund*, Ecosystem Services Market Consortium (ESMC)*, Field to Market: The Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture*,**, HabiTerre*, Cornell University Atkinson Center for Sustainability*\n\nPrimary States Expected: Nationwide, Tribal, Territories\n\nMajor Commodities: Corn, Soybeans, Wheat, Sorghum, Rice, Livestock\n\nApproximate Funding Ceiling: $90,000,000\n\nClimate SMART (Scaling Mechanisms for Agriculture’s Regenerative Transformation)\n\nThis project, which will reach across 43 states, aims to catalyze a self-sustaining, market-based network to broaden farmer access, scale adoption of climate-smart practices, and sustainably produce grain and dairy commodities with verified and quantified climate benefits. Truterra plans to work with food and ag companies to acquire project grown climate-smart commodities. Truterra’s quantification methodology would include a modeled-plus-measured approach to quantify GHG removals, using a field-level calibrated version of the DayCent model for both the baseline (producer’s actual prior practices) and the current state with new practice. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines would be used to determine emissions from all sources that cannot be effectively modeled using DAYCENT and WEPP (used to determine energy demand of field passes based on crop operations); model runs would be supported by soil sampling stratified by soil (physiochemical class, soil textural class, and soil drainage class), management (Generalized Tillage Intensity Rating (gTIR) for each of the past six years, grouped into low- or medium-tillage), and climate (temperature and effective precipitation). Truterra plans to work with Food and Ag companies to 1) better understand the commodity production practices in their supply chain, 2) identify geographies where working with producers on CSC will have the most impact, 3) deploy resources through the Network to create a “supply” of practice change, and 4) procure the resulting GHG or other ecosystem service assets. This system would enable food companies to acquire CSCs, rewards producers for producing them, and offers Network members an incentive payment for helping make it happen. The project plans to equip 11 underserved producer organizations with access to the Truterra sustainability tool, services and programs, and provide targeted support on approximately hundreds of thousands of acres as welll as train Black Climate-Smart Agronomists through internships/fellowships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) throughout the Southeast. The project also plans to provide priority access to all project technical and financial assistance opportunities and train and incentivize 10 or more underserved producers to host Farmer Peer Networks.\n\nLead Partner: Truterra, LLC**\n\nOther Major Partners: Ag Gateway, Biofiltro, Continuum Ag, ESRI, Equilibrium Capital, Farmobile*, FarmRaise, John Deere, La Crosse Seed, Macquarie, Microsoft, Northern Star Seed, Sound Ag, Strand Gard Stewardship, WinField United, American Farmland Trust*, Black Family Land Trust*, Farm Credit Council, Federation of Southern Cooperatives*, Minorities in Ag, Natrl.
