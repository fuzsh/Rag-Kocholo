Come for a waterfront bike ride along the Monterey Bay Coastal Recreation Trail from Monterey to the Pacific Grove coastline. Learn how the City of Pacific Grove is better prepared than many cities to address these issues due to the Citys Shoreline Park that runs the length of the coastline, long standing policies of setting development back from the shoreline and the geologic foundation of granite overlain by marine terrace deposits. The City is evaluating and planning for potential shoreline impacts that are expected to result from sea level rise, including the potential for relocation of portions of the recreational trail, and relocation of utilities. Hear updates from the City on the Pacific Grove Shoreline Management Plan being developed and the recently updated City of Pacific Grove Local Coastal Program.

Monterey was the Spanish and Mexican capital of California from 1774 to 1846 and was the official and sole port for international trade during this time. The City is also home to the first movie theater and the site of the California Constitutional Convention whereby on October 13, 1849, the delegates signed the Constitution in Colton Hall.

Secondary treated effluent entering this facility undergoes a four-step Advanced Water Treatment (AWT) process of ozone pre-treatment, membrane filtration, reverse osmosis, and oxidation with ultra violet light and hydrogen peroxide. The Demonstration Facility is just one example of how technological innovations and partnerships are helping to solve complex water supply issues in northern Monterey County. Learn how this facility continues to provide unique opportunities for public outreach and project specific data collection. Well use a shuttle as transportation from the conference venue on Cannery Row to the PWM facility.\n\nTour leads:\n\nRachel Gaudoin, Monterey One Water\n\nDiana Staines, Associate Planner, Denise Duffy & Associates\n\nMobile Workshops info updated: Mar 11, 2019."
