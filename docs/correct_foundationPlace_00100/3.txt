For the fourth time in five years, Pacific University ranks as the top private research university in the Pacific Northwest.

The designation comes from the National Science Foundation’s annual Higher Education Research and Development Survey, which ranks over 600 colleges and universities in the U.S. based on their investment in research.

During the 2022 fiscal year, Pacific expended more than $6.1 million in research and development. The expenditures are the most among private colleges in Oregon and rank fifth in the state among institutions of higher education, behind Oregon’s four largest public universities.

Pacific ranked 13th in research and development spending among all West Coast private institutions. The ranking places Pacific in a select group with such institutions as Stanford University, the University of Southern California and the California Institute of Technology.

Nearly $2.7 million was expended on research sponsored by the federal government while $498,000 came from state and local governments.

“Research is becoming a larger part of both the student and faculty experience at Pacific," said Jo Isgrigg, director of the university's Office of Scholarship & Sponsored Projects. “These investments enhance not only our faculty leading the research but our undergraduate and graduate students who partner with faculty on a wide range of exciting research projects.

“This achievement is shared across the university – everyone, every department contributes to this ranking. This is a wonderful success story that reflects the extraordinary teamwork and community at Pacific.”

Often a staple of large public universities, research has become an increasingly prominent part of Pacific’s vision over the past decade.
