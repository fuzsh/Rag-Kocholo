Contact booking EU/WORLD (except USA): signs.mgmt@outlook.fr Contact Bookings USA : scott@cybergrooveprod.com BIOGRAPHY : Signs is a french trio from Toulouse, France composed of Opsen, Primal Therapy & Le Lutin After making their marks separately in the dnb scene, they decide to join forces in 2014. Since the beginning, the trio has made a point of experimenting with different sounds. Dragging inspiration from their respective musical backgrounds they helped pioneering the fairly recent Jungle/dnb sub genre : Halftime/Future beat. Their no compromise approach and strong work output eventually caught the attention of several well-established drum n bass labels such as Critical, Eatbrain and RAM Records. In 2017 they signed to Noisiaâs DIVISION RECORDINGS and released the â Skin outâ EP wich really established them as main players in the genre and solidified their reputation for delivering heavy yet complex organic bangers. This year looks even more promising with another EP forthcoming on DIVISION, a multi-genre EP and different boundary pushing projects on huge labels.
