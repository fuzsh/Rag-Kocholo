        "text": "Psychologists\n\nWhen people think of psychologists, the image of someone lying on a leather couch, sharing their feelings, often comes to mind. While this scenario does occur, psychologists engage in much more than just listening to emotions.\n\nPsychologists typically hold a doctoral degree like a Ph.D., Psy.D., and Ed.D., and they must be licensed and pass general and state-specific board exams to practice.\n\nPsychologists can be skilled in treating a range of mental health concerns, from depression to relationship issues and trauma-related conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). They can also assist with substance misuse disorders, eating disorders, and learning disabilities, providing support to improve overall well-being. However, psychologists cannot prescribe medication in most states.\n\nPsychologists work in various settings, including private offices, hospitals, and schools, with many now also offering online therapy services.\n\nIn 2021, the American Psychological Association conducted a survey that showed that 50% of psychologists had transitioned to providing a combination of in-person and virtual services for their clients, a significant increase from 30% in 2020.\n\nPsychiatrists\n\nPsychiatrists are specialized doctors who diagnose, treat, and prevent mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders using a combination of psychiatric medicine, physical exams, and lab tests. They hold either a doctor of medicine (MD) degree or a doctor of osteopathic medicine (DO) degree.\n\nWhile general practice doctors can also prescribe medications for mental and emotional issues, many individuals prefer to seek care from psychiatrists for more complex disorders.\n\nPsychiatrists’ specialties can include:\n\nChild and adolescent psychiatry\n\nGeriatric psychiatry\n\nAddiction psychiatry\n\nForensic psychiatry\n\nEmergency psychiatry\n\nNeuropsychiatry\n\nSleep medicine\n\nPain medicine\n\nPsychoanalyst\n\nA psychoanalyst follows the theories and practice of Sigmund Freud by helping someone explore their repressed or unconscious impulses, anxieties, and internal conflicts. This is done through techniques like:\n\nfree association\n\ndream interpretation\n\nanalysis of resistance and transference\n\nPsychoanalysis has its critics. But it’s valued by many for its ability to delve into deep psychological and emotional issues that may underlie harmful behavioral patterns, often at a subconscious level.\n\nBe careful in selecting a psychoanalyst, as the title isn’t legally protected, meaning anyone can technically call themselves one. However, a credible psychoanalyst typically has undergone years of additional training beyond a graduate mental health degree.\n\nLook for a psychoanalyst who is board certified. Legitimate certification bodies adhere to rigorous standards and are recognized by respected professional organizations in the field of psychoanalysis.\n\nSome examples include:\n\nThe American Board of Psychoanalysis (ABPsa)\n\nThe American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA)\n\nThe International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA)\n\nPsychiatric nurse\n\nPsychiatric nurses are registered nurses with specialized training in mental health, often holding degrees such as a bachelor of science in nursing (BSN) or an associate degree in nursing (ADN). They typically work in psychiatric hospitals, mental health clinics, correctional facilities, and residential treatment centers. Additionally, they may work in private practice or provide home-based care.\n\nThey build therapeutic relationships with clients, provide psychological therapy, administer psychiatric medications, and manage challenging behaviors related to mental health conditions. Psychiatric nurse practitioners can prescribe medications similar to psychiatrists when they’re not available or cost-effective for an individual.\n\nA study found that only about 5.2% of nursing students had “definitely decided” on choosing psychiatric nursing as a specialty, indicating a challenge in attracting students to this field.\n\nEfforts to address stigma and anxiety related to mental illness could make psychiatric nursing more attractive and improve recruitment rates in the mental health field.\n\nPsychotherapist\n\n“Psychotherapist” is a broad term encompassing various mental health professionals, including psychologists and therapists, who specifically provide psychotherapy—a form of “talking therapy” aimed at enhancing mental health and overall well-being.\n\nFor instance, a psychologist using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to treat someone with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) would be practicing psychotherapy. These professionals typically hold advanced degrees in psychology, counseling, social work, or a related field.\n\nCounselors and counseling\n\nCounselors are mental health professionals who provide guidance and support to individuals, couples, families, and groups. Distinct from therapists and psychologists, counselors typically concentrate on addressing specific life challenges and providing practical solutions rather than diagnosing and treating complex mental health disorders or deeply-rooted psychological issues.\n\nCounselors usually have a master’s degree in counseling or a related field; however, a bachelor’s degree may be sufficient for certain counseling roles, such as those focused on substance use disorders.\n\nHere are some specific types of counselors:\n\nMental health counselor: Mental health counselor is a broad term for a licensed professional who provides mental health counseling services, often focusing on specific issues or populations. A mental health counselor might help you work through challenges, such as grief, anger, or work and career problems.\n\nFamily and marriage counselor: A family and marriage counselor specializes in addressing common challenges that arise in family and marital relationships, such as communication issues, conflict resolution, and parenting concerns. Their sessions are goal-oriented, aiming to achieve practical solutions and improvements in relationships.\n\nAddiction counselor: An addiction counselor specializes in care for people with problems like substance misuse, gambling, sexual addictions, or hoarding. They often work in group settings, facilitating therapy sessions and offering strategies for recovery and relapse prevention.\n\nReligious counselor: Religious counselors provide support in faith crises, marriage, and family issues, incorporating spiritual views into mental health care. Often church leaders, religious counselors have extensive training in both religion and mental health.\n\nArt therapists\n\nArt therapists are trained professionals who use the creative process — such as painting, sculpting, or writing — to improve mental health and well-being. They typically hold a master’s degree in art therapy or a related field.\n\nResearch indicates that art therapy, as a supplement to other evidence-based therapies, may assist in treating various mental health conditions, including depression, dementia, schizophrenia, and psychosis. Engaging in creative activities can boost self-esteem, develop talents, and enhance self-sufficiency.\n\nArt therapists work in various settings, including hospitals, mental health clinics, schools, and private practice, providing a unique and valuable approach to mental health treatment.\n\nSocial workers\n\nSocial workers are professionals dedicated to helping individuals and communities with personal and social challenges. They can be found in various settings, including public agencies, hospitals, universities, and private practices.\n\nTheir work involves addressing personal issues, disabilities, and social issues, such as substance misuse, housing insecurity, and unemployment. Social workers also play a crucial role in resolving family conflicts, including cases of domestic violence and child abuse.\n\nThere are many subtypes of social work. These can include:\n\nchild, family, and school\n\nmedical and public health\n\nmental health and substance use\n\nTo become a social worker, one typically needs a bachelor’s or master’s degree in social work, along with relevant licensure or certification."
