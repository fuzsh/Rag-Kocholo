        "text": "You wrote a great email. It has a solid opening line, clear email message, and closes with a call to action that‚Äôs sure to convert. Before you click ‚ÄúSend,‚Äù there‚Äôs just one last thing to do: Write a great email sign-off.\n\nWhat is an email sign-off?\n\nAn email sign-off is the final section of an email. It is generally composed of a word or short phrase followed by your name and professional signature. An email sign-off goes directly after the email‚Äôs closing line and signals that the message is complete.\n\nEmail sign-offs are used in just about every kind of email. They‚Äôre a crucial part of business correspondence, and because of this, using an appropriate email sign-off is good email etiquette.\n\nWhat every email sign-off should include\n\nEvery email sign-off should include the following:\n\nA farewell\n\nA signature\n\nContact information\n\nThe first part of an email sign-off, the farewell, is the word or phrase used right before the sender‚Äôs name. It‚Äôs an important part of the email‚Äôs tone, and it can impact how the reader interprets the email. Here are a few examples of email farewells:\n\nBest regards\n\nSincerely\n\nCheers\n\nTalk soon\n\nThe next component, the signature, is the sender‚Äôs name. If you have a professional email signature, you don‚Äôt need to type your name after an email‚Äôs farewell. If you don‚Äôt have an email signature, be sure to include your name and any relevant contact information, such as your phone number or social media handle, so the recipient can reach you through a means other than email if necessary.\n\nAn email signature is a personalized block of content you can set to be automatically included in every email you send, or just to specific audiences, such as people outside your organization. An email signature typically contains your full name, job title, phone number and extension, LinkedIn profile, and office address, and it may include additional information like an inspirational quote or headshot.\n\nDifferent kinds of email sign-offs\n\nGeneral email sign-offs\n\nMost emails end with general sign-offs. These are the short statements that precede a sender‚Äôs name and do not address anything specific to the sender‚Äôs relationship with the recipient or the email‚Äôs content. Possible sign-offs of this kind include:\n\nRegards\n\nThank you for your interest\n\nHave a great day/Have a great weekend\n\nPersonalized email sign-offs\n\nIn some cases, a personalized email sign-off is a better choice than a general email sign-off. Usually, personalized email closing phrases are reserved for email recipients the sender has an existing relationship with, either personal or professional. These sign-offs are usually one sentence and often take the place of an email‚Äôs closing phrases. Here are a few examples:\n\nI‚Äôm looking forward to starting this project with you\n\nThank you so much for this opportunity\n\nThank you for your hard work\n\nAs with a general email sign-off, the sender‚Äôs name comes immediately after a personalized email sign-off.\n\n10 best ways to end an email\n\nEmail sign-offs for formal business\n\nAn appropriate sign-off is part of a professional email closing. These include:\n\n1 Sincerely\n\nThis traditional sign-off is a popular choice because it ends an email on a positive, yet formal, note.\n\n2 Regards\n\nThis, and its variations warm regards, kind regards, and best regards, sends a clear, positive message without straying from professional communication guidelines.\n\n3 Best wishes\n\nA bit more gregarious than the previous entries, this sign-off makes it clear that you wish the recipient well.\n\nUse these email closing phrases for individuals outside your organization, prospective and current clients, outreach to vendors and other partners, and colleagues if your industry or company has a more formal culture. These are also ideal for emails sent with job applications and cover letters.\n\nEmail sign-offs for informal business\n\nWhen you‚Äôre emailing colleagues with whom you have a close relationship, or you‚Äôre otherwise conducting less formal business, the following email sign-offs are appropriate:\n\n4 Cheers\n\nSimilar to best regards, cheers is a conversational, friendly way to end an email.\n\n5 Take care\n\nThis sign-off communicates that you have a warm relationship, but it isn‚Äôt over the top.\n\n6 Best\n\nIt‚Äôs simple, straightforward, and fits just about any email.\n\nEmail sign-offs for gratitude and requests\n\nWhen you‚Äôre making a request or saying ‚Äúthank you‚Äù for a favor, endorsement, referral, or opportunity, you can reflect this in your email sign-off. Examples of this kind of sign-off include:\n\n7 Thank you\n\nIt‚Äôs simple and to the point.\n\n8 I appreciate your [help, input, feedback, etc.]\n\nSimilar to the previous entry, this sign-off clearly expresses your gratitude to the recipient. In a follow-up or reminder email, this can be a useful strategy for ensuring a response.\n\nEmail sign-offs for casual conversation\n\nIn casual exchanges, personalized email sign-offs are more common. However, there are plenty of general sign-offs that are just as appropriate for casual conversations, such as:\n\n9 Talk soon\n\nIf you‚Äôre planning to talk to your friend soon, feel free to let them know!\n\n10 Catch you later\n\nSimilar to talk soon, this sign-off acknowledges that you‚Äôll see your friend soon.\n\n10 email sign-offs to avoid\n\nBecause an email sign-off needs to make a good impression on the recipient, there are certain sign-offs you should avoid. These include:\n\n1 Looking forward to hearing from you [Thanks in advance]\n\nThis sign-off can come across as manipulative or passive-aggressive because it implies a demand that the recipient write back.\n\n2 Yours truly\n\nYou don‚Äôt truly belong to the recipient. This is insincere.\n\n3 ‚Äî[Name] or ‚Äî[Initial]\n\nUnless you‚Äôre sending a very brief, informal email, omitting the sign-off can come across as brusk or careless.\n\n4 Love (or a variation, like XOXO)\n\nUnless you‚Äôre writing an email to your significant other or a close family member, this sign-off is too personal.\n\n5 Emoji (üëçüëãüôÇ‚úåÔ∏è)\n\nWhile some emoji are acceptable in business communication, it‚Äôs better to leave them out of your sign-off, which is meant for more formal and less ambiguous communication.\n\n6 Respectfully yours\n\nIn contrast to the previous entry, this sign-off is considered very formal, to the point of feeling stiff or aloof.\n\n7 Have a blessed day\n\nIt‚Äôs generally best to avoid any religious overtones in professional and casual emails.\n\n8 Have a good one\n\nThis is another example of an overly informal sign-off that‚Äôs better said in person than in email.\n\n9 Hope that makes sense\n\nThis sign-off can also be considered passive-aggressive, as it implies that any misunderstanding is on the recipient‚Äôs part, rather than due to your communication skills.\n\n10 Good luck\n\nThis sign-off leaves too much up to interpretation‚Äîdoes it imply the recipient needs luck, that a task is too difficult, etc.?\n\nAn inappropriate sign-off is just one kind of email mistake that can detract from your message. Failing to include a sign-off is a similar faux pas.\n\nEmail sign-off FAQs\n\nWhat is an email sign-off?\n\nAn email sign-off is a short line, typically a word or phrase, that precedes the sender‚Äôs signature. In some cases, senders write personalized email sign-offs. These tend to be one full sentence or less that matches the email‚Äôs tone and that may include a call to action.\n\nWhat should every sign-off include?\n\nEvery email sign-off should include:\n\nA farewell\n\nThe sender‚Äôs name\n\nThe sender‚Äôs contact information\n\nWhat are the different kinds of email sign-offs?\n\nThe different kinds of email sign-offs are:\n\nGeneral sign-offs\n\nPersonalized sign-offs\n\nWhat are three examples of good email sign-offs?"
