        "text": "Usually, children love any type of music. As soon as they hear a melody or a tune, their bodies start rocking and their toes start tapping; however, an average child does not keep tempo, cannot properly sing a note, and will most likely crash into his friends if he is trying to dance along with them. A musically gifted child is usually more progressive in these parts. Your child who can easily bang out a beat on your pans and pots might just have the talents of a future rock star. Following are 4 signs that demonstrate whether your child is a gifted musician or not:\n\nMovements\n\nWatch the movements of your child. According to a research article, musically gifted children tend to have a rhythmic/musical way of moving. They might walk, sway, or tap their toes in time to music. When you play music in front of your child, he will naturally tap a tambourine on beat in time to the melody or beat a drum. According to a research by KidsHealth, an average child can keep time periodically as they become around age 3, however a musically gifted child will show this ability before this age – and keep time more frequent than others.\n\nListening Skill\n\nThe next step is to listen to your child when he/she points out what they hear. A child who is musically talented is often more aware of the sounds as compared to other children. Your child may talk about flowing water, noisy cars, music coming from the house of your neighbor, or music that you usually play in your car, etc.\n\nObserving Skill\n\nYou can play music for your child at your home to test their musical gift. See if he/she notices whether an instrument is out of tune or not. You can also sing a simple song yourself and make an intentional mistake in the melody. Your child will probably notice your mistake if they are musically gifted. Furthermore, you can ask them to repeat a tune they hear; musically gifted children can successfully mimic the sounds of instruments they hear in a melody or often catch onto a tune easily.\n\nInstrument Playing Skill\n\nEncourage your child to play different kinds of instruments. For instance, show them how to play the guitar – and then give them some time at the instrument to see whether they try to reproduce the tune they hear. If your child is musically gifted, then they might even surprise you by coming up with something wonderfully original.\n\nGet Professional Insight\n\nYou can also take help from a professional to evaluate your child. You can simply ask a music teacher to assess him/her or if you happen to live near a university with a music program, call them and check to see if someone there might evaluate the skills of your gifted child. You might want to enroll your child in music lessons, if he/she is particularly talented."
