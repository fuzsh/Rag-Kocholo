        "text": "While closing an email, you need to sign off.\n\nBut what is the right way to do it? Should you write ‘Kind Regards,’ ‘Best Regards,’ ‘Warm Regards,’ or, for that matter, only ‘Regards’?\n\nSimilarly, there are many other sign-off options that can confuse you even further.\n\nAn email sign-off is a short phrase added to your email’s end, right before your contact information.\n\nJust like a salutation indicates the beginning of your email, a sign-off indicates its end. Including a sign-off reflects good email etiquette on the part of the sender.\n\nIn this article, we will look at the best and worst ways to sign off an email. I’ll also share some best practices to nail your overall email signature style.\n\nBut before that, let’s understand the importance of a good email sign-off.\n\nWhy a Good Email Sign-off Is a Must\n\nA good email sign-off makes your email look more professional.\n\nNo matter how well-written your body content is, without a salutation or a sign-off, your email recipient may be disappointed. The closing phrase of your written correspondence should make an impact.\n\nEmail is one of the most effective communication channels because it’s personal. You lose the personal element by omitting a sign-off or using the wrong one.\n\nHere’s an example of how Robin Sharma, the author of the best-selling book ‘The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,’ signs off for his newsletter subscribers.\n\n‘Love + Respect’ is a unique way of signing off. It easily connects with its recipients, which helps build better relationships with them.\n\nBut again, this might not go well with a professional email or business letter.\n\nAs it’s the last thing your subscribers read in your email, it tends to stick in their minds.\n\nThat’s why it’s crucial to look at the right ways to sign off an email.\n\nEnhance Your Email Marketing\n\nWant to make your emails more impactful?

Just customize the images, headings, and CTAs for your brand, and hit send in a few minutes!\n\nBrowse the Template Library\n\nBest and Worst Ways to Sign Off Your Emails\n\nSome email sign-offs get a higher response rate than others.\n\nEmails that are signed off with a ‘Thanks in advance’ and ‘Thanks’ have seen response rates of 65.7% and 63%, respectively.\n\nWhereas emails that signed off with ‘Kind Regards’ had a response rate of 53.9%, ‘Best Regards’ and ‘Regards’ had 52.9% and 53.5%, respectively.\n\nHere are some of the best and worst ways to sign off your emails.\n\n1. Best Regards\n\nA commonly used email sign off, ‘Best Regards’ sets a friendly tone with clients and people you aren’t well acquainted with and is a great alternative to using ‘Kind Regards’.\n\nTypically, ‘Best Regards’ indicates respect and admiration for the recipient without indicating any working relationship other than what you already have with them.\n\nBut that doesn’t limit you from using it while communicating with your existing clients, vendors, or colleagues within the company.\n\nTypical scenarios where you can use “Best Regards”:\n\nWhen someone uses casual language in their emails to you.\n\nWhen communicating with businesses and vendors you already have an established relationship with.\n\nWhen reaching out to your colleagues.\n\nWhen emailing existing customers.\n\nFor example, here’s an email I got from LinkedIn. Although I have no direct relation with LinkedIn, they use ‘Best Regards’ to establish a sense of gratitude in case I decide to take the survey.\n\n2. Kind Regards\n\nAre you emailing someone for the first time? Use ‘Kind Regards’ to sign off to maintain formality.\n\nWhile the formal tone may sound less friendly, it conveys authority and professionalism.\n\nTypical scenarios where you can use the “Kind Regards” signature:\n\nWhen sending welcome or introductory emails to a mutual acquaintance of your friend.\n\nDuring the early stages of your communication with prospects and leads.\n\nDuring a warm outreach campaign.\n\nWhen you’re unsure which signature to choose from.\n\nVariations include Kindest Regards, Warm Regards, or just Regards.\n\n3. Thanks and Regards\n\n‘Thanks and Regards’ sets a professional yet friendly tone.\n\nWhile it sounds formal, it also addresses your recipient with respect.\n\nTypical scenarios where you can use the “Thanks and Regards” sign-off:\n\nWhen you’re concluding emails with a formal yet friendly tone.\n\nWhile communicating with colleagues or associates where there’s professional rapport.\n\nWhile responding to professional inquiries with a note of thanks.\n\nWhen following up on requests for assistance or information, to show appreciation while maintaining professionalism.\n\nThis is how our onboarding team at EngageBay makes the best use of Thanks and Regards’ sign-off.\n\n4. Regards\n\nWhen in doubt, always use ‘Regards.’\n\nEven though ‘Regards’ sets a professional tone, it does not create any expectations. ‘Kind Regards’ and ‘Best Regards’ can be used in both professional and informal emails, so when you’re unsure which salutation to choose from, go with ‘Regards.’\n\nThat is probably why it is one of the most popular ways to sign off despite risking sounding rude or cold.\n\nHence, before using it, consider who your recipient is, how your relationship with them is, and the purpose of your personal or business email.\n\nTypical scenarios where you can use the “Regards” sign-off:\n\nWhen you need a neutral, professional closing but the exact tone of the email isn’t crucial.\n\nIn routine business communications where familiarity with the recipient is limited.\n\nWhen responding to inquiries where a formal tone is necessary but not overly warm.\n\nWhen concluding an email where the content has been straightforward or technical.\n\nRead also: How to Write a Winning Introduction Email\n\n5. Best\n\nAnother professional yet friendly sign-off, ‘Best,’ can be used in almost all kinds of scenarios.\n\nUse it when sending an email to your friend, colleague, professor, or your manager.\n\nIt’s better to avoid using ‘Best’ if you are contacting someone for the first time or in a more formal email.\n\nTypical scenarios where you can use the “Best” sign-off:\n\nWhen concluding emails with people you already know and have an informal or semi-formal relationship with.\n\nIn follow-up communications where the tone has been established as friendly and casual.\n\nWhen emailing within your team or organization where a lighter tone is accepted.\n\nFor wrapping up conversations that involve routine updates or non-critical information.\n\nRead also: How to End an Email Appropriately: Tips & Examples\n\n6. Thank you or Thanks\n\nIf someone has offered guidance or assistance, close your email with a ‘Thank You’ or ‘Thanks.’\n\nA ‘Thank You’ acknowledges the recipient’s work and expresses appreciation, making it a great Kind Regards / Best Regards alternative.\n\nMoreover, you can also close your informal email with a ‘Thank You’ to ask someone to perform a task, resolve a query, or provide answers to a question.\n\nTypical scenarios where you can use the “Thank you or Thanks” sign-off:\n\nAfter receiving help or advice from a colleague or professional.\n\nWhen expressing gratitude after a meeting or business interaction.\n\nIn emails that involve requesting further assistance or information.\n\nWhen acknowledging the receipt of information or documents from others\n\nThis sign-off is versatile and appropriate for both formal and informal settings where you wish to show appreciation.\n\nRead more: 100+ Thank You Email Subject Lines to Master Gratitude\n\n7. Great working with you\n\nIf you are sending an email thanking someone for their services, then a ‘Great working with you’ is a good way to sign off.\n\nYou can also use this sign-off when you want to send a farewell email to a colleague who is leaving the organization.\n\nTypical scenarios where you can use the “Great working with you” sign-off:\n\nConcluding a project where you and a team or individual have collaborated successfully.\n\nIn a goodbye email to a departing colleague to express appreciation for the time spent working together.\n\nWhen wrapping up long-term interactions or partnerships that are coming to an end.\n\nAfter a successful collaboration or event where the joint efforts were especially fruitful.\n\nRead also: How To Say ‘Please Find Attached’ In 20 Different, Smarter Ways\n\n8. Looking forward\n\n‘Looking forward’ is a warm and gracious way to show your eagerness to meet or hear from your recipient in a formal letter or email.\n\nIt is generally used when you want to discuss ideas with a colleague and get their input or feedback.\n\nTypical scenarios where you can use the “Looking forward” sign-off:\n\nWhen scheduling a future meeting or event that involves your recipient.\n\nIn follow-up emails after an initial meeting or discussion to express anticipation for the next steps.\n\nWhen requesting feedback or further information on a project or proposal.\n\nIn emails that set up expectations for ongoing communication or collaboration.\n\nRead more: Practical Onboarding Email Templates for New Clients, Employees, and Affiliates\n\n9. Best wishes\n\n‘Best Wishes’ is more like a greeting used in email while trying to send good wishes to your recipient for any occasion or event.\n\nFor instance, if you are trying to send your employee a welcome or farewell email, ‘Best Wishes’ will be the right sign-off.\n\nIt helps establish a friendly tone with the recipient. An alternative for Best Wishes is Warm Wishes.\n\nTypical scenarios where you can use the “Best wishes” sign-off:\n\nIn congratulatory messages for achievements like promotions or awards.\n\nWhen sending well-wishes for personal milestones such as weddings, births, or retirements.\n\nIn farewell messages to colleagues or employees who are moving on or retiring.\n\nIn holiday greetings or annual messages to clients and colleagues.\n\nThis sign-off conveys positivity and goodwill, making it suitable for various personal and professional emails.\n\nRead also: 12 Email Invoice Templates to Customize and Click Send\n\n10. Hope this helps\n\nWhen you reply to someone who has asked a question or for some kind of help, you can use ‘Hope this helps’ to sign off your email.\n\nYou can also use the sign-off if you are providing someone with potentially useful information or resources.\n\nTypical scenarios where you can use the “Hope this helps” sign-off:\n\nResponding to emails where the sender has requested specific information or assistance.\n\nFollowing up on discussions that include guidance or advice you’ve offered.\n\nIn emails where you’re providing resources, links, or data that might solve a problem for the recipient.\n\nWhen sending instructions or solutions to a colleague or client.\n\nThis sign-off is supportive and reassuring, indicating that you hope the information you’ve provided will be beneficial.\n\nRead more: 36 Real Estate Email Marketing Templates\n\n11. Take care\n\nAnother way to build a friendly relationship with colleagues is by closing your emails with a ‘Take care.’\n\nHowever, keep in mind that this is an informal way to communicate with your colleagues, so it is best to use it only with people with whom you are well acquainted. This is also a good option while sending personal emails to colleagues from the same organization.\n\nBesides, ‘Take Care’ is often used to address sick leave request emails at the workplace.\n\nTypical scenarios where you can use the “Take care” sign-off:\n\nWhen sending personal or less formal emails to colleagues you are familiar with.\n\nIn communications related to health matters, such as informing about a sick leave or wishing someone a speedy recovery.\n\nIn farewell emails to colleagues, especially in less formal contexts.\n\nWhen sending supportive or empathetic messages during difficult times.\n\nThis sign-off conveys warmth and personal concern, making it suitable for more intimate or supportive correspondence.\n\n👉 Now that you know how to sign off your emails, head on over to EngageBay’s library of 1,000+ free and customizable HTML email templates to create stunning emails.\n\nHow Not to Sign Off Your Emails\n\nLearning how not to sign off your emails is as important as knowing how to sign off.

Write your full name\n\nIrrespective of whether it is your first or fifth email, it is preferable to state your full name in your sign-off.\n\nUnless you have a unique name or are well-acquainted with the receiver, use your full name at all times.\n\n3. Include contact details\n\nTo nurture a relationship with your recipients, make sure that you include relevant contact information while closing your emails.\n\nDetails such as your phone number, company website, and social media handles can allow people to contact you beyond emails as well.\n\n4. Avoid unprofessional language\n\nTo develop good email etiquette, make sure that you sign off all your emails.\n\nNot including a sign-off makes your emails abrupt and unprofessional.\n\nIrrespective of whether the sender signed off their emails, ensure that you do so at all times.\n\nAlso, try to avoid abbreviations and the use of informal language.\n\nRead also: How to Create a Cold Email Strategy That Will Hook Your Readers\n\nWrap Up\n\nEmail sign-offs don’t just demonstrate a positive work ethic but good email etiquette as well.\n\nThere are several ways to sign off your emails, depending upon the situation and the recipient.\n\nThere are many websites like EngageBay that allow you to build an email signature for free.
