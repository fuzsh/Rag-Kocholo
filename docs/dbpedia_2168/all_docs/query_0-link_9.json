        "text": "Music lessons make for a great home-based business where musicians can utilize their experience with playing instruments and teach lessons to others that are interested in music. With a music lesson business model, advertising your services using signs is by far one of the best attractors you can use, but your music lesson signs should consist of a few marketing elements to ensure success. Communicating to your target audience should be the first rule when designing your signs. By simply printing \"Music Lessons\" and a contact message, this is too vague and will be less likely to attract attention and promote further investigation on the part of your readers. However, by communicating the type of music lessons you teach is far more effective for penetrating the right market share and find only the individuals interested in learning the instrument you are willing to teach.\n\nOur music lesson signs are created to give you some ideas in regards to the style of advertising that works best for musician teachers. For example: if you teach piano, our piano lesson signs we provide are fully customizable allowing you to add your contact information, your session rates, and even uploading new graphics to make your signs unique to you. If violin is your specialty, our violin signs will help you create a music lesson sign that caters to people wanting to play the violin.\n\nOur designing system will also allow you to apply custom messages for advertising guitar lessons, trumpet lessons, or create advertisements for any other instrument you may teach, and once you are finished with your customizations, you will want to pick the sign products you want us to print. If your business is home based, we suggest using our yard signs to promote your music learning business. These signs can be purchased in volume and strategically placed at nearby subdivision entrances, busy intersections and other areas around your community to target individuals that may be looking for music to target individuals that may be looking for music tutors. Even placing your yard signs at college campuses to attract music students can be an effective way to promote your business."
