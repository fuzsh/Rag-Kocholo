        "text": "The way your email ends is crucial.\n\nWhile your subject line and opening hold a lot of weight, the closing line of an email, or email sign offs, shouldn’t be overlooked. Email sign offs can set the overall tone of your email, express gratitude to the reader, boost or impair your response rate, establish a working relationship, and leave a long-lasting impression. In other words, they can make or break your emails.\n\nAnd as emails are one of the primary methods of communication used both inside and outside the workplace, using them correctly is essential.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll explore some of the most popular email sign offs and how they’re used, settle the differences between the sign offs ‘Yours sincerely’ and ‘Yours faithfully’, and throw in some extra tips and tricks for good measure!\n\nHow to sign off an email\n\nBefore we look at any examples, here are some rules you should bear in mind when choosing your sign off:\n\nKeeps things flexible\n\nDon’t be afraid to mix things up. Sticking with ‘Kind regards’ every time, no matter the context, can make your emails lackluster and less impressionable.\n\nConsider the tone and intent of your message\n\nSending an email with an inappropriate sign off can easily lead to trouble. While the closing phrase ‘Have a great day’ seems innocent enough, it can easily be viewed as sarcastic if misplaced. Context is key when it comes to using certain email endings.\n\nInclude your contact details\n\nForgetting your name is guaranteed to leave a bad impression. In your first email correspondence, ensure your chosen sign off is followed by your contact information (full name, job title, phone number, and email address), and any other essential business information.\n\nSetting up automatic email signatures is an easy remedy for this.\n\nConsider the audience\n\nUnderstanding your relationship with the recipient is essential for choosing the most appropriate email sign off. Consider carefully – is your chosen email ending suitable for your close friend, family member, employee, colleague, customer, or boss?\n\nUse the correct grammar\n\nSign offs should start with a capital letter. In the case of sign offs composed of two or more words like ‘Kind regards’ or ‘Hope this helps’, only the first word should be capitalized. A comma should be placed directly after the sign off.\n\nKnow the difference\n\nWhether it’s the difference between yours sincerely, yours faithfully, kind regards, or best regards, certain email sign offs generate a lot of confusion. Let’s put that to rest.\n\nYours sincerely or Yours faithfully?\n\nThe easiest way to clarify the distinction between these two sign offs is as follows:\n\n‘Yours sincerely’ should be used for emails or letters where the recipient is known (someone you have already spoken to). The complementary email opener is ‘Dear [NAME]’.\n\n‘Yours faithfully’ should be used for emails or letters where the recipient is unknown. The complementary email opener is ‘Dear Sir/Madam’.\n\nYours sincerely or Sincerely yours?\n\nThese sign offs are interchangeable in terms of meaning.\n\nThe only difference comes from where you live. British language favors ‘Yours sincerely’ while American language favors ‘Sincerely yours’.\n\nYours sincerely or Your sincerely?\n\n‘Yours sincerely’ is correct.\n\nBest regards or Kind regards?\n\nThese two sign offs are essentially interchangeable. Both are widely regarded as formal closings, with ‘Kind regards’ being the more formal. Hence, switching to ‘Best regards’ is recommended when a relationship with the recipient has been established.\n\nKind regards or Yours sincerely?\n\n‘Yours sincerely’ and ‘Yours faithfully’ should be reserved for formal emails and letters, such as job applications and business correspondence. You’re unlikely to encounter these in day-to-day email correspondence.\n\nTherefore ‘Kind regards’ and ‘Best regards’ are better options for workplace emails.\n\nEmail sign off examples\n\nIt’s time to launch into examples.\n\nTo clarify, we have separated email sign offs that can be used in almost any email from those that are context reliant, or ‘contextual’.\n\nFor example, while ‘Regards’ is a universal sign off, ‘Thanks in advance’ only makes sense if you have asked for something in your email.\n\nAs stated, context is a huge factor when choosing email sign offs, so the following categories aren’t set in stone. But they should make the selection process a whole lot easier.\n\nFormal email sign offs\n\nThe following sign offs are generally recognized as formal and are classed as professional email closings. They can be used in nearly any email scenario and shouldn’t cause any problems.\n\nThis being said, some people argue that ‘Regards’ and ‘Best’ are abrupt and come off as insensitive, while others vouch strongly for these. We’ll leave you to decide!\n\nBest\n\nBest regards\n\nBest wishes\n\nKind regards\n\nRegards\n\nWarm regards (Warmly, Warm wishes)\n\nYours faithfully (Faithfully, Faithfully yours)\n\nYours respectfully (Respectfully, Respectfully yours)\n\nYours sincerely (Sincerely, Sincerely yours)\n\nYours truly (Truly yours)\n\nFormal email sign offs (contextual)\n\nSign offs that show gratitude are widely believed to get the highest response rate in emails.\n\nMany thanks (All my thanks)\n\nSpeak soon\n\nTalk soon\n\nThank you\n\nThanks in advance\n\nThat’s all for now\n\nWith appreciation\n\nWith gratitude\n\nSemi-formal email sign offs\n\nAs ever\n\nHave a great day (Have a great week, Have a great weekend)\n\nHope this helps\n\nThanks\n\nUntil next time\n\nInformal email sign offs\n\nInformal email endings should be used with care. Consider carefully whether they are appropriate for your situation.\n\nThis is especially true for text-like acronyms, arguably the riskiest sign offs to use in a work environment.\n\nFor example, if you have a close relationship with a colleague, you may be inclined to use ‘ttyl’ to sign off a work email (an acronym for ‘talk to you later’).\n\nBye\n\nCheers\n\nCiao\n\nLater\n\nPeace (Peace out)\n\nrgds\n\nSee ya (See you)\n\nTake it easy\n\nInformal email sign offs (contextual)\n\nStay tuned\n\ntafn\n\nthx\n\nttyl\n\nSummary\n\nYour email sign offs can establish the tone, nurture a working relationship, and bolster your response rate. In other words, it’s essential to know when to use ‘All the best’ or ‘Have a good one’ in an email ending."
