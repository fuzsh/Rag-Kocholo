        "text": "Background\n\nWorkplace violence is a frustrating problem facing Federal agencies today. While more and more information on the causes of violence and how to handle it is becoming known, there is often no reasonable rationale for this type of conduct and, despite everything we know or do, violent situations happen. No employer is immune from workplace violence and no employer can totally prevent it.\n\nThe cost to organizations is staggering. It is impossible to overstate the costs of workplace violence, because a single incident can have sweeping repercussions. There can be the immediate and profound loss of life or physical or psychological repercussions felt by the victim as well as the victim's family, friends, and co-workers; the loss of productivity and morale that sweeps through an organization after a violent incident; and the public relations impact on an employer when news of violence reaches the media.\n\nWorkplace violence affects other areas as well. The adverse impact on organizations and individuals is wide-ranging and can include:\n\nTemporary/Permanent Absence of Skilled Employee\n\nPsychological Damage\n\nProperty Damage, Theft, and Sabotage\n\nProductivity Impediments\n\nDiversion of Management Resource\n\nIncreased Security Costs\n\nIncreased Workers' Compensation Costs\n\nIncreased Personnel Costs\n\nTemporary/Permanent Absence of Skilled Employee\n\nThere are many theories about the causes of workplace violence. However, caution should be taken when profiling or stereotyping individuals or organizations since the presence of any of the factors related to these theories does not necessarily indicate a violent act will be carried out. Nevertheless, an incident can be the result of any one or a combination of these factors.\n\nRemember – violence or threats of violence in all forms is unacceptable workplace behavior. It will not be tolerated and it will be dealt with appropriately.\n\nPolicy, Purpose, and Scope\n\nEvery year, approximately two million people throughout the country are victims of non-fatal violence at the workplace. Officials at the Department of Justice have found violence to be a leading cause of fatal injuries at work with about 1,000 workplace homicides each year. Violence against employees occurs in a variety of circumstances and situations including: robberies and other crimes, actions by frustrated or dissatisfied clients and customers, acts perpetrated by disgruntled co-workers or former co-workers, and domestic incidents that spill over into the workplace.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) policy and position on workplace violence are clear. It is our policy to promote a safe environment for our employees and the visiting public, and to work with our employees to maintain a work environment that is free from violence, harassment, intimidation, and other disruptive behavior. The Department's position in this area is that violence or threats of violence — in all forms — is unacceptable behavior. It will not be tolerated and will be dealt with appropriately.\n\nThe primary purpose of this document is to provide employees of the Department with a concise reference regarding the Department's program on managing actual and/or potentially violent situations. It is intended to make employees, including supervisors and managers, aware of the potential for violence in the workplace, to increase their abilities to recognize early warning signs of potentially violent situations, and to understand how to respond to actual or potential incidents. It identifies functional area experts who employees, supervisors, and managers can call on to help them assess, defuse, and/or resolve the situation. This document also provides some prevention tips. Finally, some additional resources are included in the Appendices for those who want to learn more.\n\nAll employees and all facilities of the Department are covered by the policies and program guidance contained in this document. The Department's policy also applies to contractors and visitors to Department facilities.\n\nThis document appears on the Department's LaborNet under \"Reference Library\" and portions of the document are being condensed into one or more \"Desk Aids.\" All DOL employees should read and become familiar with the information provided in this document.\n\nRoles and Responsibilities\n\nThe goal of the DOL Workplace Violence Program is to support a work environment in which violent or potentially violent situations are effectively addressed with a focus on prevention by increasing employee understanding of the nature of workplace violence, how to respond to it, and how to prevent it. Success in the protection of our employees requires your personal attention and, as necessary, appropriate action.\n\nIT IS UP TO EACH EMPLOYEE TO HELP MAKE THE DEPARTMENT A SAFE WORKPLACE FOR ALL OF US. The expectation is that each employee will treat all other employees, as well as customers or clients, with dignity and respect.\n\nDepending on the parameters of the incident and the resources available, one or more of the experts in the functional areas listed below may be called upon to provide technical assistance in their particular field to help assess, investigate, and/or respond to a violent or potentially violent situation.\n\nEmployees (Including Managers and Supervisors) are responsible for:\n\ntheir own behavior by interacting responsibility with fellow employees, supervisors, and clients;\n\nbeing familiar with Department policy regarding workplace violence;\n\npromptly reporting actual and/or potential acts of violence to appropriate authorities;\n\ncooperating fully in investigations/assessments of allegations of workplace violence;\n\nbeing familiar with the service provided by the Employee Assistance Program;

and\n\nproviding advice and assistance concerning specific information that could and should be released to the media before, during, and/or after a crisis.\n\nHuman Resources is responsible for:\n\nassisting in assessing and investigating allegations of workplace violence raised by employees, supervisors, and/or managers, as requested;\n\nproviding technical expertise and consultation to help supervisors determine what course of administrative action is most appropriate in specific situations, including Alternatives to Discipline and use of Alternative Dispute Resolution process;\n\nproviding advice and counsel regarding personnel rules and regulations; and\n\noffering training courses to assist employees to deal with situations which may lead to potential violence, e.g., conflict resolution, stress management, negotiation skills, etc.\n\nPreventing Workplace Violence\n\nOne of the major components of an effective workplace violence program is its strategy regarding prevention. This section will focus on awareness and preventive measures that can be taken to deal with threatening, intimidating, and/or potentially violent behavior.\n\nBecoming familiar with the Department's policy and program regarding workplace violence is an important step in preventing workplace violence. It is imperative that all employees, including managers and supervisors, understand this policy and program.\n\nAll managers and supervisors are expected to discuss the policy and program with their staff so that they understand how to handle intimidating, threatening, or violent incidents as well as understand the consequences of such behavior (such as disciplinary and/or adverse action up to and including removal and criminal charges).\n\nWork Environment\n\nThe best prevention strategy is to maintain an environment which minimizes negative feelings, such as isolation, resentment, and hostility among employees. Although no workplace can be perceived as perfect by every employee, there are several steps that management can take to help create a professional, healthy, and caring work environment. These include, but are not necessarily limited to:\n\npromoting sincere, open, and timely communication among managers, employees, and union representatives;\n\noffering opportunities for professional development;\n\nfostering a family-friendly work environment;\n\nmaintaining mechanisms for complaints and concerns and allowing them to be expressed in a non-judgmental forum that includes timely feedback to the initiator;\n\npromoting \"quality of life\" issues such as facilities and job satisfaction; and\n\nmaintaining impartial and consistent discipline for employees who exhibit improper conduct and poor performance.\n\nSecurity\n\nMaintaining a secure and physically safe workplace is part of any good strategy for preventing workplace violence. The Department uses a variety of security measures to help ensure safety. The measures used depend on the resources available in the area. These may include:\n\nthe Federal Protective Service or designated security personnel to respond to requests for assistance;\n\nemployee photo identification badges and coded card keys for access to secure areas;\n\non-site guard services;\n\nguard force assistance in registering, badging, and directing visitors in larger facilities; and\n\nother appropriate security measures such as metal detectors.\n\nAdditional law enforcement assistance is available through local police departments for emergency situations. Employees should notify the appropriate security office or designated police of suspicious or unauthorized individuals on Departmental property.\n\nEducation\n\nEducation and communication are also critical components of any prevention strategy. The following types of education and communication are effective in preventing violence and other threatening behavior:\n\ncommunicating an awareness among employees, supervisors, and managers regarding all aspects of the Department's Workplace Violence Program: what it is, what to do when faced with possible problems, employee and management responsibilities, early intervention techniques, who to call for assistance, etc.; and\n\neducating employees and communicating to them techniques designed to effectively deal with conflict resolution, stress reduction, etc.\n\nPerformance/Conduct Indicators\n\nBeing aware of performance and/or conduct problems which may be warning signs of potential trouble is good prevention strategy. These signs may show up in perpetrators of violence, those who are victims, and those involved in domestic violence. Although it is possible that only one of these indicators will occur, it is more likely that a pattern will occur or that they will represent a change from normal behavior. Remember that the presence of any of these characteristics does not necessarily mean a violent act will occur. They may be indicators of another type of problem such as being ill, depressed, bereaved, etc. Some examples of performance and/or conduct indicators are listed below (listing is not intended to be all inclusive):\n\nattendance problems – excessive sick leave, excessive tardiness, leaving work early, improbable excuses for absences;\n\nadverse impact on supervisor's time – supervisor spends an inordinate amount of time coaching and/or counseling employee about personal problems, re-doing the employee's work, dealing with co-worker concerns, etc.;\n\ndecreased productivity – making excessive mistakes, poor judgment, missed deadlines, wasting work time and materials;\n\ninconsistent work patterns – alternating periods of high and low productivity and quality of work, inappropriate reactions, overreaction to criticism, and mood swings;\n\nconcentration problems – easily distracted and often has trouble recalling instructions, project details, and deadline requirements;\n\nsafety issues – more accident prone, disregard for personal safety as well as equipment and machinery safety, needless risks;\n\npoor health and hygiene – marked changes in personal grooming habits;\n\nunusual/changed behavior – inappropriate comments, threats, throwing objects;\n\nevidence of possible drug or alcohol use/abuse;\n\nevidence of serious stress in the employee's personal life – crying, excessive phone calls, recent separation;\n\ncontinual excuses/blame – inability to accept responsibility for even the most inconsequential errors; and/or\n\nunshakable depression – low energy, little enthusiasm, despair.\n\nEmployee Support Services\n\nA variety of Department resources are available to assist employees in dealing with problems originating in or being brought to the workplace. Employees should begin by contacting their supervisors, specialists from their servicing Personnel Office, Employee Assistance Program Counselors, Equal Employment Opportunity Counselors, Union Representatives, and/or the WorkLife4You (formerly LifeCare) Resource and Referral Service.\n\nEarly Intervention\n\nIntervening early in a threatening or potentially violent situation is vital to preventing its escalation. There are many intervention options, and they vary greatly depending upon the situation. Early intervention may defuse the initial situation and give the supervisor an opportunity to thoroughly review options for resolution. Intervention sets the tone for how the situation will be resolved so it must be handled deftly.\n\nTake Appropriate Action\n\nSupervisors and managers must be willing to take action when necessary. All employees must know that violence in the workplace will not be tolerated and that appropriate action will be taken if threats of violence or violence occurs.\n\nWorkplace Violence Warning Signs\n\nOne of the common types of workplace violence is that among co-workers. In addition, a high percentage of violent incidents are perpetrated by individuals from outside the workplace. This includes situations such as domestic violence, bomb threats, and violence by customers.\n\nWhile they are often preventable, it is still difficult to determine whether or not any particular workplace situation is potentially violent. This is an emotional and complex topic, and decisions about what to do in certain situations are not always straightforward or made in a clearheaded state of mind. In many cases, employees ignore warning signs because they believe they are not important, \"that's just the way Joe is,\" or that it is none of their business. In other situations, employees react based on fear and what they believe is the profile of a potentially violent person, not necessarily observed actual behavior. Another major hindrance is not knowing where to go to get help in making determinations regarding real and potential risks.\n\nActual threats should always be taken seriously and responded to immediately. When there is not an actual threat, judgment and senses should be trusted. The \"gut feeling\" that one gets when talking to people should be respected. If one feels that someone is dangerous, take the proper precautions.\n\nForms of Violence Among Co-workers\n\nThere are many forms of workplace violence among co-workers. Unfortunately, the one form that receives the most attention is workplace homicide. But there are far more incidents of violence that do not involve casualties but have the same traumatic effects. Some examples of the most frequently encountered situations among co-workers are:\n\nconcealing or using a weapon;\n\nphysical assault upon oneself or another person;\n\nactions which damage, destroy, or sabotage property;\n\nintimidating or frightening others\n\nharassing, stalking, or showing undue focus on another person;\n\nphysically aggressive acts, such as shaking fists at another person, kicking, pounding on desks, punching a wall, angrily jumping up and down, screaming at others;\n\nverbal abuse including offensive, profane and vulgar language; and\n\nthreats (direct or indirect), whether made in person or through letters, phone calls, or electronic mail.\n\nOther Forms of Workplace Violence\n\nIt is important to recognize that violent incidents in the workplace may include acts of domestic violence. Often, co-workers and supervisors believe that domestic violence is something that is not their concern, but a private family matter that should not be brought to work. But the problem does spill over into the workplace. Domestic violence accounted for 27% of violent events in the workplace. If the victim has sought shelter or a restraining order, the workplace is frequently the place s/he can be found. It is not uncommon for the perpetrator to show up at the work site to carry out acts of violence against the partner or anyone trying to protect that person.\n\nBecause of the nature of the services provided by Department programs, there are also incidents of workplace violence perpetrated by our clients/customers, particularly in enforcement and investigative settings. Finally, bomb threats make up an increasing percentage of workplace violence incidents. Many threats made in the Federal Government are made against individuals. Others allege that bombs have been planted in Federal facilities. Most threats are made by telephone.\n\nRecognizing the Levels of Violence and Response\n\nPotential or actual violent situations among employees usually escalate if not defused. Violence and the warning signs that typically occur can usually be identified at three levels. It should be noted that anyone or combination of warning signs at the three levels may be indicative of a potentially violent situation. The following is an attempt to delineate warning signs and the appropriate response. There is no fail-safe way of presenting this information to employees. Employees will have to make a judgment call as to the appropriate action to take by discerning and evaluating the given situation.\n\nLevel One (Early Warning Signs)\n\nThe person is:\n\nintimidating/bullying;\n\ndiscourteous/disrespectful;\n\nuncooperative; and/or\n\nverbally abusive.\n\nResponse When Early Warning Signs Occur at Level One\n\nObserve the behavior in question.\n\nReport concerns to your supervisor to seek help in assessing/responding to the situation. If the offending employee is the reporting employee's immediate supervisor, the employee should notify the next level of supervision. If the offending person is not an employee, the supervisor of the employee reporting the incident is still the appropriate individual to receive and provide initial response.\n\nDocument the observed behavior in question.\n\nSupervisor should Meet with the offending employee to discuss concerns. Follow these procedures:\n\nSchedule private time and place.\n\nCoordinate any necessary union participation.\n\nGet straight to the point.\n\nAsk the employee for his or her input.\n\nAsk the employee what should be done about the behavior.\n\nAsk how you can help.\n\nIdentify the performance and/or conduct problems that are of concern.\n\nIdentify the steps you would like to see to correct problems.\n\nSet limits on what is acceptable behavior and performance.\n\nEstablish time frames to make changes and subsequent consequences for failing to correct behavior and/or performance.\n\nDepartment's policies.\n\nLevel Two (Escalation of the Situation)\n\nThe person:\n\nargues with customers, vendors, co-workers, and management;\n\nrefuses to obey agency policies and procedures;\n\nsabotages equipment and steals property for revenge;\n\nverbalizes wishes to hurt co-workers and/or management;\n\nsends threatening note(s) to co-worker(s) and/or management; and/or\n\nsees self as victimized by management (me against them).\n\nResponse When the Situation Has Escalated to Level Two\n\nIf warranted, Call 911 and other appropriate emergency contacts (such as Federal Protective Service) for that particular facility, particularly if the situation requires immediate medical and/or law enforcement personnel.\n\nImmediately Contact the supervisor and, if needed, the supervisor will contact other appropriate official(s) such as functional area experts to seek help in assessing/responding to the situation.\n\nIf necessary, Secure your own safety and the safety of others, including contacting people who are in danger (make sure emergency numbers for employees are kept up-to-date and accessible).\n\nDocument the observed behavior in question.\n\nSupervisor should Meet with the employee to discuss concerns and, if appropriate, begin or continue progressive discipline. The supervisor should follow these procedures:\n\nCall for assistance in assessing/responding, if needed.\n\nAvoid an audience when dealing with the employee.\n\nRemain calm, speaking slowly, softly, and clearly.\n\nAsk the employee to sit down; see if s/he is able to follow directions.\n\nAsk questions relevant to the employee's complaint such as:\n\nWhat can you do to try to regain control of yourself?\n\nWhat can I do to help you regain control?\n\nWhat do you hope to gain by committing violence?\n\nWhy do you believe you need to be violent to achieve that?\n\nTry to direct the aggressive tendencies into another kind of behavior so that the employee sees s/he has choices about how to react.\n\nLevel Three (Further Escalation – Usually Resulting in an Emergency Response)\n\nThe person displays intense anger resulting in:\n\nsuicidal threats;\n\nphysical fights;\n\ndestruction of property;\n\ndisplay of extreme rage; and/or\n\nutilization of weapons to harm others.\n\nResponse When Situation is a Level Three Emergency\n\nAny individual observing violent or threatening behavior which poses an immediate danger to persons or property is expected to:\n\nCall 911 and other appropriate emergency contacts (such as Federal Protective Service) for that particular facility, particularly if the situation requires immediate medical and/or law enforcement personnel.\n\nRemain Calm and Contact supervisor.\n\nSecure your personal safety first.\n\nLeave the area if your safety is at risk.\n\nCooperate with law enforcement personnel when they have responded to the situation.\n\nOnce law enforcement personnel are on the scene, they will assume control of the situation. Witnesses should be prepared to provide a description of the violent or threatening individual, details of what was observed, and the exact location of the incident.\n\nDocument the observed behavior in question.\n\nSupervisor, where needed, will contact functional area experts and will follow the procedures described in the Level Two section.\n\nDomestic Violence\n\nExcept when those involved in domestic violence are co-workers, most incidents are perpetrated by individuals outside the agency. It is, therefore, unlikely that the levels of violence described above will be evident. There will, however, be early warning signs that this type of violence is escalating outside the workplace. The victim may show symptoms such as increased fear, emotional episodes, and/or signs of physical injury. Victims, as well as perpetrators, also show signs of work performance deterioration. By intervening when the early warning signs occur, even though violence may not yet have been committed at work, a serious incident may be prevented.\n\nResponse Involving Domestic Violence\n\nIn the event the perpetrator shows up at work with the intent of harming the employee and any others who happen to be in the way or involved, follow the procedures described in Level Three in responding to the immediate crisis.\n\nIf it is known that an employee is being affected by domestic violence, whether or not the perpetrator has shown up at work, it is important to provide support and assistance. Not only is the person at risk for more and usually escalated violence, but it has an impact on the safety and productivity of the entire work force. Below are some tips for supervisors when helping an employee affected by domestic violence.\n\nTalk with the employee about your concern of the possibility of the violence extending into the workplace and Recommend that the employee contact the Employee Assistance Program or the Department's resource and referral service, WorkLife4You (formerly LifeCare), for assistance in dealing with the problem.\n\nRecommend that the employee call the National Domestic Violence Hotline for more information about domestic violence or to help find local resources.\n\nContact the Employee Assistance Program for more information and/or assistance, if needed.\n\nRecommend that a workplace safety plan be developed in case an incident occurs at the workplace. Think about the safety of the individual as well as everyone around her/him. Don't be a hero if the perpetrator shows up at work. Follow the safety plan and go for help.\n\nWhen a Violent Event Happens on GSA-Controlled, Public, or Privately Controlled Property\n\nEvent Involves Strangers/Clients/Customers:\n\nNotify Supervisor.\n\nReport incident to the Security Guard/Local Law Enforcement.\n\nNotify FBI when violence is directed at the job function, normally contacted through/by Security, Solicitor, Inspector General, or OASAM Office.\n\nEvent Involves Co-Workers/Supervisors:\n\nNotify Supervisor (higher level if immediate Supervisor involved).\n\nReport incident to the Security Guard/Local Law Enforcement.\n\nEvent Involves Suspicious Letter/Package, a Bomb, or a Personal Threat:\n\nSuspicious Letter/Package\n\nDo NOT handle or open suspicious item.\n\nEvacuate the area if safety at risk.\n\nNotify Supervisor.\n\nImmediately report the item to the Security Guard/Local Law Enforcement.\n\nThreat Including Bomb Threat\n\nWhenever possible, if telephone threat, note the following:\n\nTelephone number where the call was received;\n\nExact time call was received;\n\nCaller's sex, name, telephone number, and where calling from;\n\nDetails regarding caller's voice (calm, excited, disguised, accent, etc.);\n\nCaller's estimated age (as determined by voice);\n\nBackground noise, if any; and\n\nIf call involves a bomb threat, also ask the following:\n\nWhen will the bomb explode?\n\nWhere is the bomb?\n\nWhat does it look like?\n\nWhat kind of bomb is it?\n\nWhy did you place the bomb?\n\n(Sometimes the caller will respond unwittingly and provide valuable information.)\n\nNotify Supervisor;\n\nImmediately report the incident to the Security Guard/Local Law Enforcement;\n\nNotify FBI when violence is directed at the job function, normally contacted through/by Security, Solicitor, Inspector General, or OASAM Office; and\n\nEvacuate the area if safety at risk.\n\nBottom Line: If you reasonably believe that you have an imminent dangerous situation, call 911 or local emergency response facility immediately!\n\nIn the Event of a Medical Emergency\n\nContact the following, applicable to the event:"
