        "text": "Essential symbols to help you navigate sheet music\n\nIf you don’t know what to do when you see these signs, you could get lost in the piece of sheet music. It's happened to me during gigs where I'm sight-reading so I know the pain and don't want you to suffer!\n\nThese signs and symbols of musical notation are found very often in modern sheet music.\n\nNo-one really teaches these details of musical notation. It doesn’t matter how good a reader/player you are, you can still get lost if you don’t know what these symbols mean.\n\nRepeat signs and symbols are used for several reasons:\n\nThey cut down the number of pages required to be printed\n\nThey may highlight the structure of the work. For example, verse section and chorus section.\n\nThe Repeat Sign\n\nThe most common sign in music ‘maps’ is the repeat sign.\n\nThe repeat sign is made up of a double bar line, with two little dots facing the music you’ve just played. The repeat sign indicates you should go back and play the same section again, before moving on, beyond the repeat sign, to the next section of music.\n\nThe question is, how far back should you go? There’s two options:\n\nGo back to the repeat sign whose dots face the other direction, ie. inward like this:\n\nor\n\nIf there is no repeat sign facing the other way, go right back to the beginning and play from there:\n\nPro tip: You can enhance visibility and therefore diminish your chances of missing repeat signs by adding little highlights in pencil:\n\nFirst and Second (and third and fourth...) Time bars\n\nThese are used in conjunction with repeat signs, if the composer wants to finish the repeated section differently the second time around.\n\nHow to play 1st and 2nd time bars\n\nThe first time through, play the 1st time bar up to the repeat sign. Go back. The second time through on the repeat, skip from just before the beginning of the 1st time bar to the beginning of the 2nd time bar section then play on:\n\nThere can be 3rd, 4th and more time bars:\n\nDa Capo (D.C.)\n\nDa Capo means go back to the beginning of the piece.\n\nDal Segno (D.S.)\n\nDS means go back to the ‘sign’.\n\nThis is probably the easiest sign to miss when you’re reading a piece of sheet music.\n\nPro tip: If you’re going to be sight-reading in a gig, highlight the sign during the rehearsal or talk-through of the map so you can jump straight back to it.\n\nD.C. or D.S. al Fine\n\n‘Al Fine’, pronounced ‘al finay’ means ‘to the end’. Al fine means go back to the beginning (in the case of Da Capo) or the sign (in the case of Dal Segno) and play either:\n\nto the end of the piece; or\n\nto the word Fine.\n\nCoda\n\nThe Coda (Latin for ‘tail’) is a separate section at the very end of a piece of music. Finding or getting to the Coda in a piece of sheet music can be challenging, so get out the highlighter so you don't miss it!\n\nUsually there is an indication like ‘to Coda’ or just the coda sign by itself. Then you have to jump to the Coda and play to the end of the piece.\n\nIn rehearsal, or even at live gigs where the musicians are sight-reading, they might take a few minutes before starting to talk through the sheet music, highlighting things like:\n\nThe key signature and any key signature changes\n\nThe intended speed (tempo) of the song\n\nWhere the repeats, DS's ,Codas, etc are.\n\nA comprehensive course on rhythm\n\nThis tutorial is part of a 5.5 hour course on rhythm called 'You Got Rhythm!'
