        "text": "How to sign off an email?\n\nThe best email sign-offs do 3 things:\n\nIt fits the context of your email message\n\nIt reflects how familiar and friendly you are with the recipient\n\nIt refers to the main emotion or request conveyed in the email\n\nYour sign-off right can be hugely influential on how your reader perceives you. According to behavioral economist Daniel Kahneman, the end of an experience strongly determines the way we go on to remember that experience. Take this into account, when you decide what sign off to use to end any important email.\n\nThat said, if the email is not so important, if it’s just another email, a short message, or one message in a long string, your sign-off may not be so influential, and it may even go unnoticed. In that case, you could simply skip a sign-off altogether and go about your day with a sound mind.\n\nThe bottom line is that you know better than anyone what the right sign-off is for a given action. But this does not mean that you’re left only with your gut feeling to work with. We have an easy technique to help you know what’s right. Let’s jump right in.\n\nAsk yourself these 4 questions to nail your email sign-off every time\n\nWhat is the main message of my email?\n\nWhat is the emotion I want to convey to the recipient?\n\nIs this email formal or informal?\n\nDoes the recipient know me?\n\nHow do these 4 questions provide clarity\n\nlet’s consider the following example:\n\nI wrote an email to my manager requesting a raise. In my email, I spelled out my accomplishments, my contribution to the team, and my dedication to the company.\n\nI can answer the questions as follows:\n\nI want to be considered for a raise\n\nDedication\n\nFormal\n\nWe know each other\n\nIn this case, I should go for a formal sign-off that refers to my request and conveys my feelings of dedication. I’ll end my sign-off with my name for a personal emphasis, and since my manager knows me I’ll use only my first name so that I won’t come across as emotionally distant and overly formal.\n\nThe most commonly reported sign offs in the YouGov poll were:\n\n“Thanks” 62%,\n\nJust a name or initials – 46%\n\n“Sincerely” – 44%\n\n“Love” – 28%\n\n“Regards” – 22%\n\nNo signature at all – 21%\n\nHow to sign off an email with multiple names\n\nWhen signing off an email with multiple names, such as co-workers or corporate members. The person who is writing the email will put their name and team name or they will mention the title of the person who ranks higher in the organization for example:"
