As members of this profession, engineers are expected to exhibit the highest standards of honesty and integrity. Engineering has a direct and vital impact on the quality of life for all people. Accordingly, the services provided by engineers require honesty, impartiality, fairness, and equity, and must be dedicated to the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. Engineers must perform under a standard of professional behavior that requires adherence to the highest principles of ethical conduct.\n\nI. Fundamental Canons\n\nEngineers, in the fulfillment of their professional duties, shall:\n\nHold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.\n\nPerform services only in areas of their competence.\n\nIssue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner.\n\nAct for each employer or client as faithful agents or trustees.\n\nAvoid deceptive acts.\n\nConduct themselves honorably, responsibly, ethically, and lawfully so as to enhance the honor, reputation, and usefulness of the profession.\n\nII. Rules of Practice\n\nEngineers shall hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.\n\nIf engineers' judgment is overruled under circumstances that endanger life or property, they shall notify their employer or client and such other authority as may be appropriate.\n\nEngineers shall approve only those engineering documents that are in conformity with applicable standards.\n\nEngineers shall not reveal facts, data, or information without the prior consent of the client or employer except as authorized or required by law or this Code.\n\nEngineers shall not permit the use of their name or associate in business ventures with any person or firm that they believe is engaged in fraudulent or dishonest enterprise.\n\nEngineers shall not aid or abet the unlawful practice of engineering by a person or firm.\n\nEngineers having knowledge of any alleged violation of this Code shall report thereon to appropriate professional bodies and, when relevant, also to public authorities, and cooperate with the proper authorities in furnishing such information or assistance as may be required.\n\nEngineers shall perform services only in the areas of their competence.\n\nEngineers shall undertake assignments only when qualified by education or experience in the specific technical fields involved.\n\nEngineers shall not affix their signatures to any plans or documents dealing with subject matter in which they lack competence, nor to any plan or document not prepared under their direction and control.\n\nEngineers may accept assignments and assume responsibility for coordination of an entire project and sign and seal the engineering documents for the entire project, provided that each technical segment is signed and sealed only by the qualified engineers who prepared the segment.\n\nEngineers shall issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner.\n\nEngineers shall be objective and truthful in professional reports, statements, or testimony. They shall include all relevant and pertinent information in such reports, statements, or testimony, which should bear the date indicating when it was current.\n\nEngineers may express publicly technical opinions that are founded upon knowledge of the facts and competence in the subject matter.\n\nEngineers shall issue no statements, criticisms, or arguments on technical matters that are inspired or paid for by interested parties, unless they have prefaced their comments by explicitly identifying the interested parties on whose behalf they are speaking, and by revealing the existence of any interest the engineers may have in the matters.\n\nEngineers shall act for each employer or client as faithful agents or trustees.\n\nEngineers shall disclose all known or potential conflicts of interest that could influence or appear to influence their judgment or the quality of their services.\n\nEngineers shall not accept compensation, financial or otherwise, from more than one party for services on the same project, or for services pertaining to the same project, unless the circumstances are fully disclosed and agreed to by all interested parties.\n\nEngineers shall not solicit or accept financial or other valuable consideration, directly or indirectly, from outside agents in connection with the work for which they are responsible.\n\nEngineers in public service as members, advisors, or employees of a governmental or quasi-governmental body or department shall not participate in decisions with respect to services solicited or provided by them or their organizations in private or public engineering practice.\n\nEngineers shall not solicit or accept a contract from a governmental body on which a principal or officer of their organization serves as a member.\n\nEngineers shall avoid deceptive acts.\n\nEngineers shall not falsify their qualifications or permit misrepresentation of their or their associates' qualifications. They shall not misrepresent or exaggerate their responsibility in or for the subject matter of prior assignments. Brochures or other presentations incident to the solicitation of employment shall not misrepresent pertinent facts concerning employers, employees, associates, joint venturers, or past accomplishments.\n\nEngineers shall not offer, give, solicit, or receive, either directly or indirectly, any contribution to influence the award of a contract by public authority, or which may be reasonably construed by the public as having the effect or intent of influencing the awarding of a contract. They shall not offer any gift or other valuable consideration in order to secure work. They shall not pay a commission, percentage, or brokerage fee in order to secure work, except to a bona fide employee or bona fide established commercial or marketing agencies retained by them.\n\nIII. Professional Obligations\n\nEngineers shall be guided in all their relations by the highest standards of honesty and integrity.\n\nEngineers shall acknowledge their errors and shall not distort or alter the facts.\n\nEngineers shall advise their clients or employers when they believe a project will not be successful.\n\nEngineers shall not accept outside employment to the detriment of their regular work or interest. Before accepting any outside engineering employment, they will notify their employers.\n\nEngineers shall not attempt to attract an engineer from another employer by false or misleading pretenses.\n\nEngineers shall not promote their own interest at the expense of the dignity and integrity of the profession.\n\nEngineers shall treat all persons with dignity, respect, fairness and without discrimination.\n\nEngineers shall at all times strive to serve the public interest.\n\nEngineers are encouraged to participate in civic affairs; career guidance for youths; and work for the advancement of the safety, health, and well-being of their community.\n\nEngineers shall not complete, sign, or seal plans and/or specifications that are not in conformity with applicable engineering standards. If the client or employer insists on such unprofessional conduct, they shall notify the proper authorities and withdraw from further service on the project.\n\nEngineers are encouraged to extend public knowledge and appreciation of engineering and its achievements.\n\nEngineers are encouraged to adhere to the principles of sustainable development1 in order to protect the environment for future generations.\n\nEngineers shall continue their professional development throughout their careers and should keep current in their specialty fields by engaging in professional practice, participating in continuing education courses, reading in the technical literature, and attending professional meetings and seminars.\n\nEngineers shall avoid all conduct or practice that deceives the public.\n\nEngineers shall avoid the use of statements containing a material misrepresentation of fact or omitting a material fact.\n\nConsistent with the foregoing, engineers may advertise for recruitment of personnel.\n\nConsistent with the foregoing, engineers may prepare articles for the lay or technical press, but such articles shall not imply credit to the author for work performed by others.\n\nEngineers shall not disclose, without consent, confidential information concerning the business affairs or technical processes of any present or former client or employer, or public body on which they serve.\n\nEngineers shall not, without the consent of all interested parties, promote or arrange for new employment or practice in connection with a specific project for which the engineer has gained particular and specialized knowledge.\n\nEngineers shall not, without the consent of all interested parties, participate in or represent an adversary interest in connection with a specific project or proceeding in which the engineer has gained particular specialized knowledge on behalf of a former client or employer.\n\nEngineers shall not be influenced in their professional duties by conflicting interests.\n\nEngineers shall not accept financial or other considerations, including free engineering designs, from material or equipment suppliers for specifying their product.\n\nEngineers shall not accept commissions or allowances, directly or indirectly, from contractors or other parties dealing with clients or employers of the engineer in connection with work for which the engineer is responsible.\n\nEngineers shall not attempt to obtain employment or advancement or professional engagements by untruthfully criticizing other engineers, or by other improper or questionable methods.\n\nEngineers shall not request, propose, or accept a commission on a contingent basis under circumstances in which their judgment may be compromised.\n\nEngineers in salaried positions shall accept part-time engineering work only to the extent consistent with policies of the employer and in accordance with ethical considerations.\n\nEngineers shall not, without consent, use equipment, supplies, laboratory, or office facilities of an employer to carry on outside private practice.\n\nEngineers shall not attempt to injure, maliciously or falsely, directly or indirectly, the professional reputation, prospects, practice, or employment of other engineers. Engineers who believe others are guilty of unethical or illegal practice shall present such information to the proper authority for action.\n\nEngineers in private practice shall not review the work of another engineer for the same client, except with the knowledge of such engineer, or unless the connection of such engineer with the work has been terminated.\n\nEngineers in governmental, industrial, or educational employ are entitled to review and evaluate the work of other engineers when so required by their employment duties.\n\nEngineers in sales or industrial employ are entitled to make engineering comparisons of represented products with products of other suppliers.\n\nEngineers shall accept personal responsibility for their professional activities, provided, however, that engineers may seek indemnification for services arising out of their practice for other than gross negligence, where the engineer's interests cannot otherwise be protected.\n\nEngineers shall conform with state registration laws in the practice of engineering.\n\nEngineers shall not use association with a nonengineer, a corporation, or partnership as a \"cloak\" for unethical acts.\n\nEngineers shall give credit for engineering work to those to whom credit is due, and will recognize the proprietary interests of others.\n\nEngineers shall, whenever possible, name the person or persons who may be individually responsible for designs, inventions, writings, or other accomplishments.\n\nEngineers using designs supplied by a client recognize that the designs remain the property of the client and may not be duplicated by the engineer for others without express permission.\n\nEngineers, before undertaking work for others in connection with which the engineer may make improvements, plans, designs, inventions, or other records that may justify copyrights or patents, should enter into a positive agreement regarding ownership.\n\nEngineers' designs, data, records, and notes referring exclusively to an employer's work are the employer's property. The employer should indemnify the engineer for use of the information for any purpose other than the original purpose.\n\nFootnote 1 \"Sustainable development\" is the challenge of meeting human needs for natural resources, industrial products, energy, food, transportation, shelter, and effective waste management while conserving and protecting environmental quality and the natural resource base essential for future development.\n\nAs Revised July 2019\n\nBy order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, former Section 11(c) of the NSPE Code of Ethics prohibiting competitive bidding, and all policy statements, opinions, rulings or other guidelines interpreting its scope, have been rescinded as unlawfully interfering with the legal right of engineers, protected under the antitrust laws, to provide price information to prospective clients; accordingly, nothing contained in the NSPE Code of Ethics, policy statements, opinions, rulings or other guidelines prohibits the submission of price quotations or competitive bids for engineering services at any time or in any amount.\n\nStatement by NSPE Executive Committee\n\nIn order to correct misunderstandings which have been indicated in some instances since the issuance of the Supreme Court decision and the entry of the Final Judgment, it is noted that in its decision of April 25, 1978, the Supreme Court of the United States declared: \"The Sherman Act does not require competitive bidding.\"\n\nIt is further noted that as made clear in the Supreme Court decision:\n\nEngineers and firms may individually refuse to bid for engineering services.\n\nClients are not required to seek bids for engineering services.\n\nFederal, state, and local laws governing procedures to procure engineering services are not affected, and remain in full force and effect.\n\nState societies and local chapters are free to actively and aggressively seek legislation for professional selection and negotiation procedures by public agencies.\n\nState registration board rules of professional conduct, including rules prohibiting competitive bidding for engineering services, are not affected and remain in full force and effect. State registration boards with authority to adopt rules of professional conduct may adopt rules governing procedures to obtain engineering services.\n\nAs noted by the Supreme Court, \"nothing in the judgment prevents NSPE and its members from attempting to influence governmental action . . .\"\n\nNOTE: In regard to the question of application of the Code to corporations vis-à-vis real persons, business form or type should not negate nor influence conformance of individuals to the Code. The Code deals with professional services, which services must be performed by real persons. Real persons in turn establish and implement policies within business structures. The Code is clearly written to apply to the Engineer, and it is incumbent on members of NSPE to endeavor to live up to its provisions. This applies to all pertinent sections of the Code.\n\nCopyright © National Society of Professional Engineers. All rights reserved."
