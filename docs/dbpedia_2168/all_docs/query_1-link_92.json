        "text": "Musicians are composers, conductors or performers of music, and use their skills to pursue a creative role in a variety of settings\n\nYou could be a composer, instrumentalist or a singer performing either in the studio or to a live audience.\n\nYou may work alone, as a freelance artist, in collaboration with others, or as a salaried member of a:\n\nband\n\nchoir\n\ntheatrical ensemble\n\nopera company\n\norchestra.\n\nCompetition in this field is high, so you'll need to dedicate hours of practice to maintain and develop your skills - whatever your preferred style.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nAs there are many genres of music, some activities will differ depending on your area of expertise. However, you'll typically need to:\n\nperform at concerts, festivals, theatres and other music venues\n\nparticipate in recording sessions\n\npractise regularly\n\nattend rehearsals and plan performances\n\nprepare for auditions\n\nlook after your instrument and/or voice\n\nset up/tune your instrument and other equipment, arranging for its transportation if required\n\ncompose new songs and music\n\npromote your act by making demos, using social media, setting up your own website, and contacting agents and record companies\n\nhandle the administration of business activities such as managing accounts, negotiating fees and organising distribution of your recordings both offline and online\n\nseek out new venues in which to perform\n\narrange gigs and tours either yourself or through a manager or agent\n\ndeliver educational work in schools, businesses and the wider community.\n\nSalary\n\nYour income will vary widely depending on, for example, whether you're working freelance or as part of an orchestra, or whether you're performing a gig in a pub or in a concert venue.\n\nThe Musicians' Union (MU) recommends minimum casual stage rates for groups performing on stage (usually in a theatre or concert venue) ranging from £172 to £192 per musician (for a single performance plus rehearsal on the same day). They also recommend a minimum national gig rate of £147 for groups performing in pubs and clubs per musician and £196 for functions per musician. You can negotiate gig fees based on these minimum rates taking into account your training, experience and expertise.\n\nIn orchestras, your salary will depend on the orchestra you work for, your grade and experience. For example, salaries for BBC orchestra players can range from £38,820 to £61,080 depending on the orchestra you work for, your grade and years of service. Minimum concert rates for freelance BBC orchestral concerts range from £155 to £202.50 per musician depending on your location and grade.\n\nThe MU has guidance on rates for employed and self-employed orchestral musicians, gigs and live engagements, session musicians, and musicians working in theatre.\n\nIncreases in income will depend on your genre, experience and skill, the type of venue you play in, your popularity and the general economic climate.\n\nFor salaried musicians, extra payments can be made for overtime, concert fees, recordings, porterage of large instruments and travel expenses. In some instances, you may also be paid an additional fee for rehearsal. Royalties may be additionally paid if the music has been registered with the PPL or PRS for Music.\n\nMany musicians have a portfolio career and work in more than one role to earn enough money. Examples of other work include private music teaching to individual pupils or to groups in schools or the community, writing music for other artists, producing music for other artists and working as a touring musician for other artists.\n\nFigures are intended as a guide only. See the MU and the Incorporated Society of Musicians (ISM) for more information on fees and rates for musicians.\n\nWorking hours\n\nYou won't have a regular Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm work pattern. Rehearsals usually take place during the day and performances in the evenings, though this can vary.\n\nStudio recordings can take place late into the evening.\n\nPrivate practice can take place any time of the day or night.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nIt takes time, skill, practice and dedication to develop a reputation as a musician and you'll be expected to learn in your own time.\n\nYou may need to diversify and branch out into other styles of music to enhance your employability. You may also have to take on other work, for example teaching music either to individual pupils or peripatetic teaching in schools/colleges, to enhance your income as a performer.\n\nPerforming and auditioning can be stressful for some musicians, and injuries (such as repetitive strain injury) can affect your career. The British Association for Performing Arts Medicine (BAPAM), a specialist charity, provides free, expert health services and a wide range of advice on how to stay fit and healthy as a musician.\n\nIt's relatively common to spend time away from home, sometimes for lengthy periods, both in the UK and abroad. This goes hand in hand with touring companies or going on tour with your band. You'll need to be flexible and travel where the work takes you, whether this is freelance or contract work.\n\nA limited number of orchestral posts are available and tend to be in the larger cities. There are opportunities for singers and instrumentalists to audition throughout Europe and beyond.\n\nQualifications\n\nAlthough you don't need a degree in music to become a musician, for some genres, such as the classical repertoire, it is highly regarded. Experience and overall musicianship are paramount.\n\nMost musicians start learning an instrument or singing from an early age. This is particularly true of classical musicians, who take graded music exams, including theory, before going on to further training at a conservatoire (music college) or university.\n\nConservatoires differ from universities as they focus more on performance-led diplomas or degrees, with an emphasis on practical skills. You'll be expected to work a full week with performances and workshops usually held in the evening or at the weekend. You must also be prepared to practise in your own time. Entry is via audition and undergraduate courses last three or four years. There are also postgraduate courses available.\n\nThere are also many universities offering music degrees - visit UCAS for details and to apply. Some courses focus more on the academic side of music so do your research to make sure the course matches your career aims.\n\nRelevant qualifications and graded exams are also provided by organisations such as The Associated Board of Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM) and Rockschool.\n\nCompetition is tough in the industry, but a love for your style of music combined with the determination to succeed should improve your chances. Entry to full-time posts in orchestras is particularly competitive and you'll usually need to build a musical career incorporating performance work in a number of different settings and groups, teaching and arranging music.\n\nSkills\n\nYou'll need to have:\n\nmotivation, determination and perseverance\n\nconfidence in performing before an audience\n\nstamina and dedication to continue practising every day\n\nreliability and flexibility as you'll need to work long and irregular hours\n\nthe ability to work well as part of a team\n\ncreativity\n\nself-discipline and time management skills\n\neffective communication and interpersonal skills\n\npatience, understanding and resilience, to take on board criticism and accept rejection\n\nattention to detail.\n\nYou'll also need business and marketing skills as many musicians work on a self-employed or freelance basis.\n\nWork experience\n\nWhatever your genre of music, you'll need to get practical experience. Get involved with orchestras, choirs, music societies, bands and solo musicians at university and in your local area. Introduce yourself to as many musicians as possible, use any professional contacts you make and use social media platforms such as YouTube and TikTok to promote yourself and showcase your work. For more information on how to promote yourself, see the MU's advice on marketing yourself.\n\nNetworking is vital as opportunities are often discovered via word of mouth, and personal recommendations can sometimes lead to auditions. Take any opportunity that arises to gain experience - by doing so, you'll build your confidence and professional network and extend your repertoire. Examples of where to gain this experience include:\n\nplaying for amateur orchestras\n\nattending auditions\n\nentering talent competitions\n\nplaying at festivals\n\nplaying gigs\n\njoining student society music groups.\n\nIf you are in a band or a solo artist, contact local music venues and send them a demo tape of your music. You can upload your music to platforms such as SoundCloud so that you can easily share your tracks.\n\nEntry is usually through an audition. Where appropriate, keep a record of when different organisations audition by closely following their website or calling them in person. For example, some orchestras and opera houses hold auditions on a yearly basis, while others only audition when a current member leaves.\n\nSee BBC Music Introducing for information on how to get started.\n\nFind out more about the different kinds of work experience and internships that are available.\n\nEmployers\n\nMany professional musicians, regardless of their genre, are self-employed, with the exception of some classical musicians, who are occasionally employed as a full or part-time member of an orchestra.\n\nThere is a variety of orchestras and ensembles in the UK, and they differ in terms of size, style, location and repertoire. Employers include ballet, symphony, opera and chamber orchestras, some of which are large enough to employ musicians on full-time contracts. For a list of member orchestras and ensembles see the Association of British Orchestras (ABO).\n\nAs a popular musician you could form part of a band, a backing group or be a solo performer. You'll usually need to work in another role and play part time until you become successful.\n\nThe most common employers of classical singers are opera companies, although as there are very few professional choirs opportunities can be limited. Some of the larger choral societies employ opera singers for solo and oratorio work.\n\nThere is also occasional work offered by independent fixers for recording sessions and outdoor performances. Freelance musicians or permanent staff can take on this ad-hoc work.\n\nOrganists are attached to a specific cathedral or church and their full-time post may also include the role of choirmaster and director of music. Most organists will work part time and combine their role with teaching at an associated school or conducting a local choral society.\n\nOther employers of musicians include holiday camps, cruise ships, theatre companies, the Royal Corps of Army Music, RAF Music Services and Royal Marines Band Service.\n\nLook for job vacancies at:\n\nEntertainers Worldwide Jobs - for musicians and singers looking for auditions, jobs and other opportunities in the UK and around the world\n\nMusical Chairs - for classical music jobs\n\nMusic Jobs\n\nThe Stage - for singing opportunities within UK theatre and the entertainment and performing arts industry.\n\nYou can also visit the ABO website and search individual orchestral and opera company websites. The Royal College of Organists (RCO) also advertises jobs.\n\nAlthough some jobs and auditions are advertised in the music and entertainment press, one of the most common ways to learn of vacancies is via word of mouth and networking.\n\nIt's also possible to find work through an agent or manager.\n\nYou could also produce a demo CD, DVD or MP3 of your music to send to recording companies.\n\nProfessional development\n\nYou'll need to continue training to improve your performance and professional development throughout your working life. This is achieved through practising every day and performing, as well as by taking lessons with private music teachers.\n\nFurther training and support are available from a range of organisations and professional bodies related to your genre of music, for example:\n\nthe ABO - represents professional orchestras, youth ensembles and the wider classical music industry\n\nthe RCO - represents organists and choral directors\n\nIvors Academy - represents songwriters and composers\n\nsome of the larger opera companies, for example the Royal Opera House and the National Opera Studio\n\nRockschool - for popular music.\n\nThese organisations provide a range of professional development opportunities such as training courses, qualifications and seminars, as well as access to advice, awards and bursaries.\n\nMembership of the ISM and the MU is also useful. They provide members with access to careers and business advice on issues such as fees and contracts, as well as networking and professional development opportunities.\n\nYou can also get support through Help Musicians, a charity for professional musicians that provides a range of financial, welfare, physical and mental health support to musicians.\n\nIt's also worth reading the specialist press for your area of music, such as Music Week, to keep up to date with what is happening in the industry.\n\nCareer prospects\n\nEstablishing a career as a musician can be difficult as it's an extremely competitive area of work. It's not always possible to work full time as a musician, particularly at the start of your career, and you'll need talent, determination and perseverance to succeed.\n\nThere isn't a great deal of movement within the orchestral profession, so bottlenecks do occur and progression can be slow. Movement to another orchestra may be the only way to advance in this situation. With experience you may be able to progress to principal player or section leader. This is likely to involve extra duties such as organising a section of the orchestra, editing the music and discussing options with conductors.\n\nSolo performers may start their career within an orchestra or amateur choir and then progress to become a soloist, but very often they start their career from day one as a solo performer with a mixture of freelance solo work and teaching. You'll receive more work as you build your reputation.\n\nOnce you've gained experience in the popular music industry, you may decide to move into the business side as a producer, manager or writer or you could work for a record company.\n\nIt's also possible to develop your career as a composer or conductor, start your own ensemble or move into related areas of work such as music education, administration or community arts work.\n\nFind out more about careers in music."
