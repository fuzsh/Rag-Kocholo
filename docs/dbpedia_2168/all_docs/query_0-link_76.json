        "text": "Choosing a college major is a big decision that shapes both your academic journey and future career. While some might underestimate the challenges that come with being a fine arts major, those who major in fine arts know that the program demands more than just an interest in visual expression. It requires a lot of skill and dedication. If you have appreciation and skill for painting, sculpture, drawing, printmaking, or photography, there are probably a few signs you’re an artist who belongs in a fine arts degree program.\n\n1. You’re Passionate About Art\n\nEverything about art is exciting to you. You love to explore different kinds of visual mediums and have a knack for working with the ones that are your favorite. You probably also love to visit art galleries or just look at the art around you. Beyond making art, you care deeply about how art evokes emotion, makes viewers think, and shares a unique perspective. There’s also a good chance you have defended artwork if someone else tried to discount it as silly or simple.\n\n2. People Say You Should Be an Artist\n\nWhether it’s teachers or friends and family, people tell you that you have artistic talent. They probably encourage you to create and give a lot of positive feedback on your art. You’ve probably also had your artwork showcased in school galleries or contests. You’re so used to the encouragement that you’ve considered working toward becoming an artist in your career.\n\n3. You Love Art Supplies\n\nTrips to the arts and crafts store aren’t a chore for you, they’re fun. You save up your extra cash to stock up on supplies and love to experiment with new materials. Testing the items in your latest haul, seeing what works for you and connects with your vision is your definition of the perfect day in.\n\n4. You Enjoy Art History\n\nArt history isn’t exactly everyone’s cup of tea, but it’s certainly yours. You really appreciate learning where the world’s great works of art originated from and how they came to be. You want to know about the people who created those masterpieces, learn about their perspective, and take some of that inspiration and incorporate it into whatever you’re currently working on.\n\n5. You’re Visually Minded\n\nYou’re a visual learner, meaning you prefer to learn through pictures, graphics, and colors. Naturally, you might also express yourself better through these kinds of visual mediums rather than words. You also likely have a very keen eye for details, like to observe your surroundings, and care about how things look or how they are presented.\n\n6. You’re Committed to Creating\n\nCreating art isn’t easy, but you make art because you want to. You may run into creative blocks or might not always have your work appreciated. Even still, you let your love for art come first. The message and meaning behind your artwork matter, and you strive to finish what you’ve started no matter how long it takes.\n\nJoin Villa’s Fine Arts Program"
