Whether itâ€™s helping family, friends, or your community, learning lifesaving skills will make a difference.\n\nFind a class today or call 1-800 RED-CROSS.\n\nMany companies in the United States require First Aid, CPR and AED certifications for the workplace. The Red Cross offers flexible, OSHA-compliant group training solutions. Employees can be trained online, through community classes, at your location, or the Red Cross can train your company's trainers so they can deliver Red Cross instruction.\n\nLearn more by filling out this form or calling 1-800-RED-CROSS .\n\nLaunched in 2014, the Red Cross Centennial Campaign helps children and adults learn how to swim and urges people across the country to make sure that they, and their families, can swim.\n\nThe American Red Cross celebrates the real-life stories of how individuals and teams came together to help save the lives of others. Share your story.\n\nBehind every Red Cross training program stands the Scientific Advisory Council - a team of experts dedicated to ensuring the training curriculum is based on the latest and best emergency science. The council, a member panel of nationally recognized medical, scientific, aquatics, and academic experts is the reason why individuals, corporations, and healthcare providers choose the Red Cross for their training needs."
