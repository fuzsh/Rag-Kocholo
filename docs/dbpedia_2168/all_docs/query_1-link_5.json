        "text": "Long comment: I’m not sure if the question fits here to be honest. It appears to be a request for resources about something that should be quite opinion based. Because this is by no means a thing of classical musicians, but generally a thing with any kind of art. There are many ways to define what makes a good musician, and different people will have different ideas on this. And especially things like musicality are very fuzzy terms. Some people will say this musicians plays with so much musicality, and some will say this musician has no musicality, he cannot even keep his time.\n\nWhat is true is that music — particularly classical music — offers many degrees of freedom and expression. This means great artists are able to really make great things. On the other hand especially the world of soloists is extremely competitive. This means that you do get artist who survive by technical brilliance. And for some people these are musicians with a lot of skill but little musicality.\n\nBut in then music has from the beginning been something that needs to be sold to people in some sense. In music you are dependent on other people liking what you do, and being willing to pay you for it. And thus we see certain type of musicians because there is at least some demand for it. You get musicians who play with a lot of pathos and “soul”, because there are people who like that thing. There are musicians who play with insane technique because there are people who like that thing. And thus both are fine.\n\nThere is of course a thing that due to the competitiveness of the business many musicians are trained for technical brilliance, and it is harder to survive as musicians if you do not have that level of technique. But mostly I think this is simply people liking different things, and expressing their own opinion of what makes musicality.\n\nThe important thing here is to be able to say: “I do not like the way X is playing Y” without projecting it on the person: “I to not like X, because he does not play Y well”."
