        "text": "Do you have that professional email mostly written, but you’re not quite sure how to wrap it up? Or do you feel like you’re defaulting to the same email closings every time and want some alternatives? Sure, if you’re emailing someone you talk to everyday, it’s not necessarily the end of the world to skip the sign-off and end with just your name. But when you want to make sure an email makes a good impression, taking an extra beat to consider how you’re ending your note could help it land the way you want it to.\n\nSEARCH OPEN JOBS ON THE MUSE! See who’s hiring here, and you can even filter your search by benefits, company size, remote opportunities, and more. Then, sign up for our newsletter and we’ll deliver advice on landing the job right to you.\n\nWhen you’re sending a professional email—for work or school, in your job search, or in a personal situation where you’re dealing with a business—the ending of your message “can leave a lingering favorable impression [and] give a satisfying sense of completion,” says Muse career coach Barb Girson.\n\nRead on to see how to end your emails the right way—plus a list of professional closings for any situation.\n\nWhat to Include When Ending an Email\n\nThe amount and type of information you add to your email endings will depend on the situation. But generally the less you know the person you’re emailing, the more info is required.\n\nHere are the most common elements of a professional email ending:\n\nClosing line: Jumping from the main subject of your email directly to your sign-off might be jarring, especially for longer messages. You can ease the transition with a closing line that expresses gratitude or well wishes. Even if someone is quickly scanning an email, they often read the last line, Girson says, so you can also use this space to include a call to action or to reiterate to the recipient what you need from them.\n\nClosing (or sign-off): This is the word or phrase that goes right above your name. Think “Sincerely,” “Best,” “Thanks,” or something like “Have a great weekend!” Unless you’re more than a few emails into an email thread (especially over a short period of time) or you’re very close with the recipient, you need a professional closing for your email. See below for a list of options.\n\nName: If this is the first email you’re sending someone, you should generally go with your full name (first and last or whatever you commonly go by) or your first name followed by a default email signature that has your full name in it. For conversations with people you already know, your first name is usually enough.\n\nPronouns: This is at your discretion and dependent on your comfort level—especially if you identify as LGBTQ. But for allies: Keep in mind that when you share your pronouns, you help create a safe environment and normalize the act in general so that trans and nonbinary people don’t feel conspicuous as the only ones doing it.\n\nTitle and company: You might include one or both of these as part of your email ending, depending on who you’re contacting and why. If you’re emailing someone outside of the organization you work for, including both tells the recipient what you do and where you work. If you’re emailing a coworker (particularly from a company email address), the company you work for is a given and you can leave it off, but if you haven’t interacted with the person before, your position might be helpful to include. During your job search, you should generally leave your current workplace out. You’re not writing the email as part of your current company’s business (plus you’re trying to leave, so it could confuse the reader).\n\nContact info: The person you’re emailing already has your email address (though you could include it in a default email signature), but you might want to consider adding other methods of reaching you such as a work or cell phone number. But only list ways you actually want to be contacted.\n\nMore context about who you are/the work you do: If you’re making a first introduction or creating your default email signature, you can also use your email signature to give your email recipient more context about what you’ve done in the form of links to your LinkedIn profile, personal website or portfolio, and/or your social media accounts (if they’re professional and relevant!).\n\nIf you’re creating a default email signature, consider adding everything on this list from “name” down (you should tailor the closing line and sign-off for each note). Note that “Sent from my iPhone” is not part of a professional email ending and is appropriate only when it makes sense for the other person to know that you sent an email on the go. Otherwise, delete this before you hit send, and definitely keep it out of any email cover letters.\n\nHow might this look all together?\n\nSending a Cover Letter:\n\nThank you for taking the time to review my application, and I hope to hear from you soon!\n\nSincerely,\n\nPaolo Santiago\n\nGraphic Designer\n\nhe/him/his\n\n(555) 123-4567\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/pasantiago/\n\nPortfolio: www.paolosanti.com\n\nResponding to an Interview Request:\n\nI look forward to speaking with you on Thursday.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nSam Perkins\n\nthey/them/their\n\n(444) 234-5678\n\nReaching Out to Someone at Another Company for the First Time:\n\nI look forward to working with you as your company begins the transition to XYZ’s new CRM software.\n\nAll the best,\n\nLetitia\n\nLetitia Watson\n\nshe/her/hers\n\nAccount Manager, XYZ Solutions\n\n(333) 345-6789\n\nEmailing a Colleague You Work With Regularly:\n\nI’m excited to hear your thoughts on this slide deck by Tuesday afternoon. Hope you have a great long weekend!\n\nThanks,\n\nJun\n\nExamples of Email Sign-Offs\n\nHere’s a list of possible email closings to help you change things up. When considering what type of sign-off to go with, think about who you’re emailing and why. “It is up to you, the audience you are reaching, and the message you are conveying,” Girson says. If you’re replying to someone else’s message, try to pay attention to cues and gauge the formality of their note in order to match it, says Muse career coach Lynn Berger.\n\nIf You Need Something Formal\n\nThink cover letters, job search and application-related emails (especially if it’s the first time you’re emailing this person), and messages to people you don’t know well or at all. If you’re not sure what type of closing is most appropriate for a given situation, it’s best to err on the side of formality (but maybe loosen up that stuffy “Sincerely” and opt for a “Take care,” “Regards,” or the old standby “Best” instead).\n\nAll my best,\n\nBest,\n\nBest regards,\n\nBest wishes,\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you,\n\nRegards,\n\nRespectfully,\n\nSincerely,\n\nSpeak with you soon,\n\nTake care,\n\nWarm regards,\n\nWarm wishes,\n\nWarmly,\n\nIf You Want Something Friendly\n\nThese email closings work well when you’re corresponding with someone you know well or when you’re a few exchanges deep in an email thread. Use these with close colleagues and coworkers or anyone else you have a professional, but more casual relationship with.\n\nRead more: Sick of Signing All Your Emails With Best? Here's When You Can Start Dropping the Formalities\n\nCheers,\n\nEnjoy your [day of the week]/week/weekend,\n\nGood luck,\n\nGreat catching up with you,\n\nHappy [day of the week],\n\nHappy holidays,\n\nHave a good one,\n\nHave a great day,\n\nHere’s to a great [day of the week],\n\nHope this helps,\n\nHope you’re making it through [day of the week],\n\nSee you tomorrow/next week/at [that upcoming activity or event you’ll both be attending],\n\nSending good vibes,\n\nTalk soon,\n\nUntil next time,\n\nIf you’re many emails deep into a friendly or casual chain, you can also consider dropping the sign-off completely and just putting your name at the end of each email.\n\nIf You Want to Show Appreciation\n\nMaybe the person is taking something off your plate during an especially busy week or connecting you with someone in their network. Or perhaps you’re just thanking someone for their time. Even when you’re just asking someone for something as part of both your job duties, it’s nice to show that you’re grateful. After all, don’t you like when you feel appreciated for doing your job? (Note: Try to match how effusive your thanks is with the reason you’re expressing gratitude to avoid confusion—“thanks a million” for something relatively small could leave the email receiver wondering if you’re being sarcastic.)\n\nAll my thanks,\n\nI can’t thank you enough,\n\nI owe you,\n\nMany thanks,\n\nMuch appreciated,\n\nThank you,\n\nThank you for everything,\n\nThank you in advance,\n\nThanks,\n\nThanks a million,\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nThanks for your consideration,\n\nThanks for your help,\n\nThanks so much,\n\nWith appreciation,\n\nWith gratitude,\n\nYou’re a lifesaver,\n\nYou’re the best,\n\nClosings to Avoid\n\nThese sign-offs have no place in a professional email. Reserve them for exchanges with friends and loved ones only.\n\nHave a blessed day, (or anything else with religious overtones)\n\nLove,\n\nPeace out! (or any other slang)\n\nThx (or any other abbreviations)\n\nYours truly (or any closings that suggest a devotion that’s a bit too much for the workplace)"
