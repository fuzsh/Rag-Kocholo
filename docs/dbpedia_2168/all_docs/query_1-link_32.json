        "text": "Introduction: What are the Different Types of Artists?\n\nIn an era with an enormous array of different types of contemporary art, one might wonder what the different types of artists are today – and in the past. Furthermore, there is more than one parameter to create types of artists; some of these parameters are very important and commonly used in the art industry. But what are they, and what are the different types of artists according to these parameters?\n\nThe different types of artists are determined by the medium (for instance, a collage artist), the artist’s career (for example, an emerging artist), the art movement connected to the artist (for example, a pop artist), the general style of the artist (abstract artist) or the genre the artist practices (for example a portrait artist).\n\nAs a result, following these five different parameters, we can present you with a complete overview of the different types of artists. So, without further ado, let’s jump into the first types of artists with the medium.\n\nPlease note: If you are an artist, read our article on How To Succeed As an Artist. Or, feel free to head over to our Services for artists, to get featured on CAI or request professional 1-on-1 advice.\n\nDifferent Types of Artists by Medium\n\nFollowing the different types of art based upon medium, we can differentiate the different kinds of artists accordingly. Please note an artist can be a painter and an installation artist simultaneously. This can often be referred to as a multimedia artist.\n\nAs a result, we have listed the different types of artists by medium below:\n\nThe painter\n\nThe sculptor\n\nThe draughtsman\n\nThe printmaker\n\nThe collage artist\n\nThe digital (collage artist)\n\nThe (fine art) photographer\n\nThe video artist\n\nThe installation artist\n\nThe land artist\n\nThe (public) intervention artist\n\nThe performance artist\n\nDifferent Types of Artists by Career\n\nThe art industry often refers to certain types of artists based on their careers and status. Please note that this list has many gray areas between the different types of artists. Often it is not clear when an artist moves from being an emerging artist to being a mid-career artist. However, it is most often obvious when one speaks of an established artist.\n\nTo have a good understanding of these types of artists, we have listed the different types using the correct terminology below, including a short and concise definition:\n\nThe beginning artist: the beginning artist is an artist who has just started their career. As a result, the artist in question does not have a mature body of works, decent exhibition history, or any recognition in the art world.\n\nThe emerging artist: an emerging artist is an artist who has a decent body of works and some exhibition history. As a result, the artist in question has caught the eye of some galleries and collectors. However, for now, their career and status have no convincing recognition from the industry.\n\nThe mid-career artist: A mid-career artist is not an artist in the middle of his career according to his lifespan. They are an artist with a strong and mature body of works and a good exhibition history resulting in national and international recognition in the art world. At this point, the artist may have participated in some exhibitions at museum institutions or significant art events.\n\nThe established artist: An established artist, often referred to as a blue-chip artist, is an artist who has an extensive body of works and internationally established recognition in the art world. As a result, the artist has had multiple exhibitions at major institutions or events and has a proven value in the art market.\n\nDifferent Types of Artists by Art Movement\n\nWhen it comes to the different types of artists based on art movement, it’s very self-explanatory. If the artist is connected to a specific art movement, for instance, Conceptual Art, then we can call the artist a conceptual artist. As a result, every art movement results in a type of artist. However, not all artists are exclusively bound to one particular direction. Or, some art movements are part of a more significant art movement. As a result, a modern artist can also be a surrealist artist, as surrealism is an art movement of modernism.\n\nWe have listed the most important types of artists by movement below to create a clear overview:\n\nRenaissance artist\n\nMannerist\n\nBaroque artist\n\nClassicist artist\n\nRococo artist\n\nNeoclassicist artist\n\nRomanticist artist\n\nRealist artist\n\nSymbolist artist\n\nModern artist\n\nImpressionist artist\n\nPost-impressionist artist\n\nFauvist artist\n\nCubist artist\n\nFuturist artist\n\nExpressionist artist\n\nDada artist\n\nSuprematist artist\n\nConstructivist artist\n\nSurrealist artist\n\nAbstract expressionist artist\n\nPostmodern artist\n\nPop artist\n\nConceptual artist\n\nFluxus artist\n\nFeminist artist\n\nMinimal artist\n\nPhotorealist artist\n\nArte Povera artist\n\nNeo-Expressionist artist\n\nBody artist\n\nEnvironmental artist\n\nKinetic artist\n\nOp artist\n\nDifferent Types of Artists by Style\n\nWhen it comes to the art styles, there is often some confusion as people often to see a certain art movement as an art style, which are two different things. The style of the art refers to the visual characteristics. As a result, a certain style, for instance abstract art, can have several art movements, in this example abstract expressionism, minimalism, suprematism, constructivism and op art for instance.\n\nWe have listed the most common types of artists based upon style below:\n\nabstract artist\n\nfigurative artist\n\nacademic artist\n\ngraphic artist\n\nDifferent Types of Artists by Genre\n\nWe conclude this article with the different types of artists based upon the genre they are occupied with. A genre is a certain niche or topic artist can focus on. As a result, some artists dedicate their oeuvre to one specific genre, making the notion of a type of artist by niche very appropriate. Therefore, we have listed the different types of artists by genre below:\n\nPortrait artist\n\nLandscape artist\n\nStill life artist\n\nUrban artist\n\nHistory artist\n\nFigure artist\n\nLast Updated on September 15, 2023"
