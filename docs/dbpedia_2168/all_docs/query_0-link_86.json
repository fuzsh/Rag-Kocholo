        "text": "Struggle to remember the entire dictionary of music terms? From adagio to waltz, here is a comprehensive guide to Italian musical terms and other terminology.\n\nWhether a direction to play glissando or an indication that Pavarotti is in fact about to sing an aria, not the overture, music terms can sound as beautiful and playful as the compositions they describe.\n\nThey’ll also help you gain a fuller understanding of the history of classical music, and exactly how composers wanted their pieces to be played.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the most useful terminology you’ll find in music.\n\nRead more: 30 of the greatest classical music composers of all time\n\nA\n\nAccelerando (Italian: 'getting faster')\n\nAdagio (Italian: 'slow'). Meaning the music should be played slowly. Barber's 'Adagio' is a fantastic example of this.\n\nAllegro (Italian: 'lively'). Meaning the music should be played cheerfully. Upbeat and brisk. Try Rossini's William Tell overture for size.\n\nAndante (Italian: 'walking'). Meaning the music should be played at a walking pace. Not too fast or slow.\n\nAria (Italian: 'air'). An aria is a song, generally used to describe set-piece songs in Opera.\n\nAtonal Music in which no key can be established. The technique is heard in a lot of 20th Century music. Composers from the Second Viennese School used atonality as a basis for much of their work.\n\nRead more: Here’s a genius written representation of musical terms\n\nB\n\nBallad. From the vulgar Latin 'ballare', meaning to dance. A work in dance form imitative of a folk song, with a narrative structure.\n\nBar. A vertical line through the stave, to mark the music into sections, each with a set amount of beats within.\n\nBarcarolle. A boating song, generally describing the songs sung by gondoliers in Venice. Chopin, Mendelssohn, Fauré and Offenbach all wrote works imitating the form.\n\nBaritone. Male singing voice in the middle range. Gerald Finley is a world class example of a baritone.\n\nBaroque. A period in art and music from around 1600-1750. Composers include Monteverdi, Purcell, Rameau, Bach, Vivaldi and Handel.\n\nBasso Continuo (Italian: 'continuous bass'). A form of bass line used in music from the Baroque period. It is usually notated with numbers indicating what chords can be used, so the continuo player can embellish the lines. Bach's Brandenburg Concertos are a fine example of this.\n\nBerceuse. A lullaby. Generally slow and undulating, Chopin's famous Berceuse is the most well known example of the form.\n\nBolero. A Spanish dance. The most famous example is Ravel's Boléro.\n\nC\n\nCadence. Two chords at the end of a piece which provide a type of 'punctuation' at the end of a musical phrase. Cadences can either suggest the sentence isn't over, or provide a type of musical 'full-stop'.\n\nCantata. A choral work that uses solo voices with an instrumental (usually orchestral) accompaniment. A cantata is generally a choral work of some length that also uses solo voices, usually with instrumental accompaniment. The texts used may be sacred or secular. Some cantatas use solo voices without chorus or choir. Listen to Bach's Cantata No. 140 (Wachet Auf) for a beautiful example.\n\nCapriccio. (Italian: 'caprice'). A lively piece of music, usually free in its form and short. Tchaikovsky's Capriccio Italien is certainly in high spirits.\n\nChanson. (French: 'song'). A French song, from the middle ages to the 20th century.\n\nChorale. A Lutheran hymn. Generally the music moves in block chords. The most famous Chorales of all were written by Bach.\n\nChord. The sounding of two or more notes at the same time.\n\nChromatic. Notes which do not belong to the diatonic scale. For example, in the scale of C major (the white notes on the piano), they black keys (sharps and flats) are the chromatic notes. Rimsky Korsakov's Flight of the Bumblebee is a particularly exciting example of a work built around the chromatic scale.\n\nClef. Several symbols drawn at the end of a stave, indicating the pitch of the notes written on that stave.\n\nCoda (Italian: 'tail'). The tail end of a piece of music. Usually a section which indicates the end of the piece or section is approaching.\n\nColoratura (Italian: 'colouring'). A type of decoration, usually in singing that is ornate and richly ornamented. Dame Joan Sutherland was one of the greatest coloratura sopranos of all time.\n\nConcerto. A piece of instrumental music for soloist contrasted by an ensemble (either a small group of musicians or a full orchestra). Rachmaninov's epic Piano Concerto No. 2 remains one of the most popular works in the genre.\n\nCountertenor. The vocal range of a male alto. Close in range to a female soprano. Iestyn Davies explains here.\n\nCrescendo (Italian: 'growing') A dynamic instruction meaning to gradually play louder.\n\nD\n\nDa Capo (Italian: 'from the beginning').

Indicated by a stylised ♭ sign, shows that the note before which it is place should be lowered by a semitone. Flat can also mean that a note is out of tune, sounding lower than it should in this case.\n\nForte (Italian: 'strong'). A dynamic instruction meaning the music should be played loudly. The instruction appears as either: 'f' loud; 'ff' fortissimo, meaning very loud; or 'fff' very loud. The practice has expanded to allow for any number of 'f's, depending on how loud a composer wants something to be played. Here are some examples of when 'fff' really doesn't describe it...\n\nFugue. A form in which the composition is contrapuntal. A theme introduces the piece, which is then repeat at different pitches throughout the composition, set in counterpoint to other musical lines within the texture. The Fugue has proven a fascinating medium, even penetrating the world of pop music and Lady Gaga...\n\nG\n\nGigue.

A term describing movements in art and music. Generally French, the impressionist art and music from the late 19th / early 20th Century is characterised by a sense of veiled, blurred images and a palette of rich colour. Both Debussy and Ravel resented their music being described thus, as they felt it suggested their music had little formal and structural value.\n\nIntonation. The accuracy or lack of pitch in instrumental playing and singing. For example, 'intonation is off here', meaning the tuning is not exact.\n\nJ\n\nJig. A lively English dance, usually placed at the end of a Baroque suite.\n\nK\n\nKey. A musical key is the relation of different chords to each other. The 'tonic' is the subjective sense of 'home', from which musical compositions deviate from, and arrive back to. Relations of different keys to each other give the impression of tension, development and resolution. A 'key signature' is an instruction at the beginning of written music, indicating what the 'home key' of the work is.\n\nL\n\nLargo (Italian: 'broad', 'wide', 'slow'). An instruction meaning the music is usually slow in speed, or broad in tempo.\n\nLegato (Italian: 'joined').

Madrigals are usually of a secular nature, and became very popular in the Renaissance and early Baroque periods.\n\nMajor. A scale which corresponds on the piano to all the white notes, C to C. A C major triad chord consists of the notes: C, E, and G. Generally, major keys sound 'happy' while minor keys sound 'sad'.\n\nMalagueña. A Spanish gypsy dance from the region of Málaga. Composer Ernesto Lecuona is known for his piece of the same name, and Ravel used the form in his Rapsodie Espagnole.\n\nMazurka. A traditional Polish dance. Many composers, including Chopin and Szymanowski have written works using the form.\n\nMezzo (Italian: 'half'). The term can be used in a number of contexts. Mezzo-forte / mezzo-piano are dynamic instructions meaning 'half-loud' and 'half-soft' respectively. A mezzo-soprano is a female voice range that is lower than a soprano.\n\nMinuet.

An electronic instrument which produces sound using a keyboard which controls oscillating frequencies. Produced by Maruice Martenot in 1928, the most famous example of its use is in Messiaen's bombastic Turangalîla-Symphonie .\n\nOpus (Latin: 'work') A term is generally used in the listing of a composer's works by opus numbers, usually abbreviated to Op. Since the Latin plural opera would lead to unnecessary confusion it is best avoided, although the alternative opuses remains an unsatisfactory substitute. Opus numbers are not always a guide to the date of composition or even to the date of publication.\n\nOratorio (Italian: 'pulpit'). A large scale work for orchestra and voices, usually sacred in nature. Oratorios are narrative in the same way as opera, but are performed without staging, costume, action or scenery.\n\nOstinato (Italian: 'obstinate') A repeated musical phrase or rhythm.\n\nOverture.

Colloquially known as the 'piano'. A keyboard instrument developed int he 18th Century. The piano evolved from the harpsichord, in that the piano creates sound by hammers hitting strings, rather than the strings being plucked. The term 'pianoforte' is a mix of two Italian words, 'piano' (soft) and 'forte' (loud), meaning depending on how much force is applied to the keys, the instrument's dynamic range can be anywhere from very soft to very loud.\n\nPitch. The frequency of the vibration of sound. Pitch is measured in hertz, and is generally organised in a system known as 'equal temperament', a system of tuning in which different notes have a standardised pitch ratio.\n\nPizzicato (Italian: 'plucked') A direction to string instrument performers to pluck the strings, rather than using the bow to create sound.\n\nPiù (Italian: 'more'). A term that can preface an instruction to mean 'more of'. 'Più vivo', meaning 'more lively', or 'Più lento', more slow.\n\nPoco a poco (Italian: 'little by little'). An term that can preface and instruction meaning to follow it 'little by little'. For example, 'poco a poco crescendo', meaning, getting louder gradually, little by little.\n\nPresto (Italian: 'quick') An instruction that a movement, section therein, or work is fast in tempo.\n\nQ\n\nQuarter-tone A division of pitches, smaller than a semitone, which is half a tone.
