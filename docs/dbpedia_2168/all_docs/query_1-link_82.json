        "text": "For many classically trained musicians, landing a permanent position in an orchestra is the dream. Perhaps this is because orchestra positions provide job security, a good salary, medical benefits, and the opportunity to play regularly with other outstanding musicians. Or perhaps it's because, in many ways, the orchestra is one of the last pure temples of musical worship in existence. In a world where being employed full-time solely to play and perform music is an absolute rarity, the orchestra harkens back to an older time, when patrons of the arts would support musicians out of nothing more than a deep appreciation for their craft. As such, an orchestra member's job requires only learning, rehearsing, and performing the orchestra's repertoire with skill and passion.\n\nThere are opportunities for orchestral musicians all over the world, with a particularly large concentration in Europe.\n\nThere are four large groups of instruments in an orchestra: strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion. Each of these groups is broken into a number of subgroups, also called sections, based on instrument; for example, the orchestra's many strings players are grouped into two violin sections, a viola section, a cello section, and a double bass section. Each section is in turn led by a principal player, also called a section leader or first chair, who is tasked with playing orchestral solos, signaling entrances and exits, and determining technical details like bowing or breathing. Orchestra members are charged with listening closely and working together to find cohesion and balance within the larger group—a task in which they are led by their conductor and music director, the orchestra's concertmaster, and the section leaders.\n\nCareer Path\n\nMost orchestra musicians start their professional careers soon after earning a bachelor's or master's degree, usually from a conservatory music performance program. Many begin by working in community and regional orchestras, honing their craft before auditioning for more prestigious orchestras in larger cities, where paychecks—and the average level of playing—are higher. Auditions are a major part of every orchestra musician's early career.\n\nOnce employed by an orchestra, musicians can advance within their instrumental section, climbing to become the principal player, also known as the section leader; the section leader of the first violins is a special position called the concertmaster. Section leaders often stay in their positions for decades, meaning opportunities to take these seats tend to be rare. In addition to playing for better and better orchestras, skilled orchestra musicians can go on to become conductors or music directors, pursue a career as a soloist, start their own music ensembles as bandleaders, or become involved with education or public outreach as nonprofit artists, music teachers, or professors."
