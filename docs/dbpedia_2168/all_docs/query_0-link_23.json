        "text": "Constant exposure to high decibel levels — whether on stage or wearing headphones in the studio — takes its toll on hearing. Many famous musicians have experienced permanent hearing loss from spending so much time on stage with loud music or even in the studio with loud music flowing through their headphones.\n\nStatistics show that professional musicians are approximately four times more likely to develop noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) as compared to the general public. Professional musicians are also more likely to experience tinnitus, a condition that causes ringing in the ears. Hearing damage from the loud music also has an impact on others in the music industry, including backstage workers, lighting technicians, and even the waiters and bartenders that serve in the places where music is being played. Famous musicians who have permanent hearing loss include Eric Clapton, Chris Martin from Coldplay, Brian Wilson from The Beach Boys among many others. One great way that musicians can prevent hearing loss by understanding the signs.\n\n4 Tips About Hearing Loss For Musicians\n\nGet familiar with the types of hearing loss loud music can cause\n\nHearing loss – Musicians may begin to experience total or partial inability to hear sounds. Hearing loss may also affect the ability to hear higher frequencies.\n\nDistortion of sound – Another type of hearing loss that musicians can experience is distortion of sound. Commonly, consonant sounds, especially s and t will blur together and lack clarity.\n\nTinnitus – Tinnitus occurs when the sufferer hears ringing or the perception of sound in the absence of it. Tinnitus sufferers may also hear things such as whistling, buzzing or roaring sounds within the ear or head.\n\nHyperacusis – Musicians also can experience hyperacusis which is when the sufferer has a decrease in sound tolerance. It may render as an increased physical discomfort from sounds that are loud, but tolerable to others. Hyperacusis sufferers can also begin to suffer from phonophobia, also known as the fear of sound.\n\nDiplacusis – Diplacusis is when there is a distortion of pitch. The sufferer may experience a different pitch in one ear versus the other, making one note to be heard as two.\n\nUnderstand the riskiest sound levels.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) prescribes that the safe level of sound to avoid hearing damage is 80 dB and below, while the ​National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is 85 dB and below. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), on the other hand, estimates the safe level to be 90 dB and below. While the numbers slightly vary, all organizations agree that prolonged exposure can be harmful to hearing.\n\nExplore the use of headphones.\n\nHeadphones are a common tool for musicians, but they can come with a price for hearing. Active noise-canceling and noise isolating headphones can be beneficial in reducing noises that impact hearing.\n\nBone conduction headphones allow listeners to be more aware of their surroundings because they don’t block out surrounding noise. These types of headphones can still cause hearing damage if played too loud. Output limiting headphones or earbuds are a great option because they limit the volume to 85 dB.\n\nDrill down on how the music impacts your hearing.\n\nAlmost all musicians have experienced hearing loss at some point in their careers. Studies show that 52% of classical musicians and 30% of rock musicians were found to have some degree of permanent hearing loss.\n\nAssess The Setting – Some concerts and music rehearsals have dangerous volume levels, and all music venues have drastically different acoustics. As a musician, it’s important for you to understand the music levels of each venue.\n\nInstruments – Not all instruments have the same impact on hearing. For example, brass, woodwind, and percussion players are particularly susceptible to music-induced hearing loss because of high volume levels and high frequencies.\n\nAt Madison & Saratoga Hearing Center, We’re Here to Help!
