        "text": "Cash Me Outside Girl doesn’t need musical talent. A tenor saxophonist playing jazz clubs in Chicago does. The professional has the chops to play gigs and make money, and can use direct-to-fan platforms to create better fan relationships and even expand income. But these are working folks, so f—k the fame.\n\n8. The Symphony Orchestra Player\n\nThis is related to the gigging musician, with the only difference being a steady orchestra chair. Actually, any ensemble that plays consistently fits this category. So, the second violin of the San Diego Symphony Orchestra spends most of her time playing with one orchestra, instead of constantly playing different jobs.\n\n9. The Hobbyist\n\nMaybe a serious musician in the past, now it’s just for fun. Sadly, even extremely talented musicians can experience difficulty making ends meet. So this category can include some bad-ass players that have day jobs, families, or other things laying claim to their time.\n\n10. The Hobbyist In Denial (HID)\n\nLofty aspirations, lots of missed notes. Sometimes self-financed (see Florence Foster Jenkins).\n\n11. The Songwriter\n\nSometimes a performer, oftentimes not, this breed of musician is putting songs and lyrics together and hopefully scoring some hits. Usually behind-the-scenes.\n\n12. The Post-Label, Direct-to-Fan Artist\n\nAmanda Palmer is one of the biggest examples of this. Palmer was built up by a major label, had a falling out, and subsequently ventured solo. It was a messy departure, but ultimately a good stepping stone.\n\nActually, some really big superstars also fit into this category, simply because their contracts ran out! A prime example is Radiohead, but plenty of post-label artists are thriving out there.\n\n13. The Producer/Composer\n\nTypically behind the scenes, but oftentimes grabbing the spotlight — especially in hip-hop. Either way, this is a different type of animal, with roles that can span rap producer to Hollywood composer to stock music creator.\n\n14. The Teacher\n\nA lot of active musicians also teach; some are solely dedicated to instruction. Incidentally, some are actively teaching others and helping other musicians out — even if they don’t have a formal teaching gig.\n\n15. The Legacy Artist\n\nThe glory days are over, but hopefully the revenues are not. Or, if they are, reunion tours and remastered releases are always tricks to consider. Of course, it always helps if everyone’s alive.\n\nWe’re getting the band back together…"
