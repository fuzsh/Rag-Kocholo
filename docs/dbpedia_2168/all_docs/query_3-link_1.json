        "text": "Signage has been a vital part of human communication for centuries, guiding and informing individuals throughout their daily lives. From our caveman days to the 21st century, sign makers have played a crucial role in creating professional signs and bespoke signage that captivate attention, direct, and sell.\n\nJoin us for a journey through time as we explore the incredible history of signage and the clever people who create them - sign makers!\n\nMany historians believe signage started with the ancient Greeks and Romans, where signs were used to identify trading stalls, advertise goods and provide directions. The earliest signs were handcrafted from things like wood and stone. These signs would often use imagery to portray a message, due to the vast amount of illiteracy among the population.\n\nThese skilled artists, known as sign makers, were highly regarded for their excellent craftsmanship in creating signs that stood out in a crowded marketplace. As time went on, signage imagery became more elaborate. Colourful paintings and even gold engravings were used on professional signs to direct and attract!\n\nDuring the Renaissance period, a golden age for artists, sign makers became extremely popular. Because of this, they received a surge in demand.\n\nThis period is when bespoke signage makers developed and evolved their skills, combining traditional techniques with emerging artistic styles to create stunning bespoke signage that showcased their expertise.\n\nAs the Renaissance unfolded, the appreciation for art, culture and aesthetic grew. The demand for signage that not only conveyed messages and directions but held beauty and sophistication encouraged professional sign makers to explore new designs and new materials. The bespoke signage we know today began here.\n\nThe intervention of electricity in the 1800s marked the beginning of the biggest evolution in professional signs' history.\n\nIt was during this period that the idea of incorporating a lightbulb into bespoke signage emerged, revolutionising the visibility, aesthetic and overall quality of signage, still to this very day.\n\nThe ability to illuminate signs at night opened up new possibilities, designs and ideas, and allowed businesses to grab attention at all times. These became especially popular with nighttime clubs, cinemas, and 24-hour shops.\n\nIn 1907, plastic was invented. This brought a dramatic shift in the mass production of signage. With this newfound material, the process of creating signs became faster and more cost-effective. This gave professional sign makers the ability to create mass amounts of affordable signage and distribute it far and wide. As a result, businesses of all sizes were able to make use of the brilliant marketing tool which is signage.\n\nThe history of signage and the artistry of sign makers have evolved hand in hand, adapting to the changing times and technologies. Today, signage continues to provide businesses, small and large, with effective 24/7 advertisement, as well as providing amazing directional and wayfinding signage across the country.\n\nHere at Esign, our exceptional team continues to embrace this legacy of innovation and craftsmanship in every sign we create.
