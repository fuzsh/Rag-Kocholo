        "text": "Clogs: In this next lesson, you will be creating your very own graphic score.\n\nNaomi: Oh, I canât wait. No rules, I just do whatever I like.\n\nClogs: Exactly. However, some graphic scores come with instructions. They might tell you what instruments to use or how fast to play, but they will always leave some things up to the musicianâs imagination or interpretation.\n\nNaomi: So that means you could listen to two performances and they would sound similar but still different. I do like the idea of no rules, though.\n\nClogs: One of the most famous graphic scores, called Treatise, by Cornelius Cardew, is 193 pages long and contains no instructions at all. This means every performance is completely different.\n\nNaomi: Oh, I hope Mrs Thomas doesnât expect me to write a score thatâs that long. Time to find out.\n\nMrs Thomas: Are you excited about composing your own graphic score?\n\nNaomi: Yeah, I cannot wait. Where do I start?\n\nMrs Thomas: OK, well, on the easel you have some pieces of card for you to draw on. Each will be a different part of your song. Once youâre done with a part, lay it on the floor where weâll be able to see the score come together.\n\nNaomi: OK, understood. What shall I draw first?\n\nMrs Thomas: Well, maybe think of a sound you like and find a way to draw that, or focus on drawing something that you think will inspire the reader.\n\nNaomi: Well, I want a big dramatic start, so maybe four loud bangs?\n\nMrs Thomas: Oh, what shapes or symbols could you use for that?\n\nNaomi: Big pointy stars. I imagine each sound is going to sound sort of the same, so Iâm going to draw these stars the same size.\n\nMrs Thomas: Oh, great work. Right, first one done. Whatâs next?\n\nNaomi: OK, Iâd then like the music to start very quiet and get louder. I can draw a smooth line from the bottom to the top, like this.\n\nMrs Thomas: Oh, good idea. In music, getting louder is called crescendo and getting quieter is called decrescendo. If you want, you can also add some instructions to this section to make it clearer.\n\nNaomi: Right, so do I just write âmake this quietâ here and âmake this loudâ here?\n\nMrs Thomas: Well, you could use a single letter to give that instruction. P in music stands for piano, which means quiet. Can you guess what pp might mean?\n\nNaomi: Does that maybe mean very quiet?\n\nMrs Thomas: Yes, exactly. Thatâs also called pianissimo. The letter f stands for forte, meaning loud and ff is fortissimo, which meansâ¦\n\nNaomi: Very loud. So Iâve put pp down here and ff up here.\n\nMrs Thomas: All right, onto the next one. What do you want to do?\n\nNaomi: Iâm going to do some wavy arrows, all three aiming up to the right. So letâs start here. Oneâ¦ Twoâ¦ Threeâ¦\n\nMrs Thomas: Great. Do you want to add any instructions?\n\nNaomi: No, I think Iâll leave this one up to the musicianâs imagination.\n\nMrs Thomas: OK, Well, we can start thinking about the structure of our graphic score now. For example, you could repeat some bits so that the music feels familiar to the listener. It doesnât have to be new every time.\n\nNaomi: Well, in that case, I fancy doing the four stars again.\n\nMrs Thomas: Oh, very nice. Do you have any idea how you want to lay out your score? You could put the sections in a straight line like traditional notation, or you could try something new.\n\nNaomi: Hmm, how about a spiral around the whole carpet?\n\nMrs Thomas: Oh, well, thatâs a good idea although it means youâve got a lot more drawing to do.\n\nNaomi: Yeah, thatâs true.\n\nNaomi: Thatâs it, my graphic score is complete.\n\nMrs Thomas: Oh, well done. Youâve created an amazing piece of art. How would you feel about me performing your masterpiece?\n\nNaomi: Really? Yes, please. I canât wait to hear what you do with it.\n\nMrs Thomas: OK, Iâm going to play the keyboard and I may sing a bit too. Why donât you try and follow along and work out what part of your graphic score Iâm playing.\n\nNaomi: OK, will do. Iâll give you the big introduction. Everybody, please put your hands together for the incredible, the sensational, the ridiculously talented Mrs Thomas!\n\nMRS THOMAS SINGS SOFTLY\n\nMRS THOMAS SINGS LOUDLY\n\nPIANO NOTES INCREASE IN PITCH\n\nFOUR SHORT NOTES\n\nONE LONG NOTE\n\nLOTS OF SHORT NOTES\n\nFOUR SHORT NOTES\n\nMRS THOMAS SINGS SOFTLY THEN LOUDLY\n\nPIANO NOTES DECREASE IN PITCH\n\nMRS THOMAS SINGS\n\nMRS THOMAS SINGS\n\nNOTES THEN INCREASE THEN DECREASE IN PITCH\n\nNaomi: That was so cool to hear my score performed. I love your interpretation.\n\nMrs Thomas: Oh, thanks, Naomi. Weâve learned that a graphic score will inspire a musician in different ways."
