        "text": "You’ve done the hard work of writing a professional email, and now it’s time to figure out how to end it. Knowing how to end an email professionally is crucial for writing clear, actionable emails that leave your recipient with a positive impression. This guide will walk you through how to end an email professionally, from ways to send an email and best and worst email sign-offs to what your email signature should include.\n\nWhat Are Email Endings?\n\nAn email ending is what it sounds like: the way you end an email! There are three main components of email endings.\n\nClosing phrases: The phrases you use to summarize your email before you officially sign-off.\n\nSign-off: The word or couple of words you use before you include your signature.\n\nEmail signature: Your name, and sometimes additional personal information.\n\nSo how exactly do you end an email? Let’s look at best practices for each part of an email ending.\n\nProfessional Ways to End an Email: Closing Phrases\n\nProfessional email closing phrases are the sentences you use before officially signing off the email. These phrases should restate and clarify the purpose of your email and end with a call to action.\n\n“Whether I’m emailing a prospect to get a meeting or emailing a recruiter to get an interview, I want to be sure that the reader understands exactly what the next step I’d like them to take is,” Otis Perry, business development representative at Forage, says.\n\n>>MORE: How to Find and Reach Out to Recruiters on LinkedIn\n\nThe recipient should know exactly what to do next after reading your email, whether sending you times to meet, reviewing a document, or telling you the next steps.\n\nProfessional Email Closing Phrases Examples\n\nThank you so much for connecting! I look forward to speaking with you on [date and time].\n\nI’ve sent over [materials you discussed]. Please review by [date] and let me know if you have any questions.\n\nThank you again for meeting with me today. I look forward to learning about the next steps of the interview process.\n\nI look forward to joining the team! I’ll see you for my first day on [date].\n\nThank you again for giving me more information about the opportunity! I’ve attached my resume and will contact you by [date] to follow up if I haven’t heard from you by then.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions by replying to this email or reaching out to me on Teams.\n\nI look forward to reading your responses in the attached sheet below on Friday. I’ll be in touch about next steps the following week.\n\nProfessional Ways to End an Email: Email Sign-Offs\n\nYou’ve come up with the longest part of the end of your professional email — next, you’ll decide how to sign off an email. While some people have strong opinions about which email sign-offs they prefer, you can’t go too wrong as long as you choose something professional that suits the context of your email.\n\n“I always say ‘thank you so much for your time,’ or ‘thanks in advance’ if the purpose of my email was to ask questions or if I’m providing instructions on a project to someone,” sats Daniela Camejo Sanchez, senior writer at WriterArmy, a content production agency. “Expressing gratitude and kind regards is always a good idea!”\n\nFormal Email Sign-off Examples\n\nFormal email sign-offs concisely wrap-up the email professionally without being too familiar.\n\nSincerely\n\nBest\n\nKindly\n\nRegards\n\nWarm regards\n\nAll the best\n\nThank you\n\nThank you in advance\n\nCasual Email Sign-Off Examples\n\nWondering how to sign an email more casually? If you’re emailing someone at work who you have a fairly casual relationship with, there are still options for keeping it professional with a casual tone. Casual email sign-offs — that are still appropriate for the workplace — include:\n\nHave a great day\n\nStay tuned\n\nCheers\n\nTake care\n\nTalk soon\n\nOnwards and upwards!\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you\n\nThanks\n\nInappropriate Email Sign-Offs\n\nThere are a few professional email sign-offs to avoid, most of which are too casual or inappropriate for the workplace. Examples of these include:\n\nLove\n\nThx\n\nYours\n\nYours truly\n\nXO\n\nPeace out\n\nSee ya\n\n✌️ (or any other emoji)\n\nWhat to Include in a Professional Email Signature\n\nAfter you’ve signed off, you want to include your name and, depending on who you’re talking to, a few additional details. For example, if you’re speaking with a recruiter or a networking connection, you may want to share additional contact information and a link to your website. Besides your name, you may consider including:\n\nYour current title\n\nYour university and graduation year (if you’re a student)\n\nYour phone number\n\nYour email address\n\nYour location\n\nA link to your website or online portfolio\n\nA link to your LinkedIn or other professional social media accounts\n\nWhat Tone Should You Use When Ending a Professional Email?\n\nTo determine what tone to use at the end of your professional email, Camejo Sanchez says it’s all about knowing who you’re communicating with.\n\n“Especially if this is the start of a conversation with a person you don’t know, do your research,” Camejo Sanchez says. “Ask yourself, how do they present themselves professionally? What is their personal brand like? Do they seem like they value formal exchanges over more casual ones, or vice versa? You can tell a lot about a person by reading a few professional posts they’ve shared online.”\n\nYet no matter who you’re emailing, Perry says to remember there’s a human behind the email, too.\n\n“I often try to dance the line between a formal and casual tone,” he says. “I definitely want to be respectful and not say anything that may offend or disengage the reader. However, I want to humanize my email as much as possible and communicate in a conversational tone so it’s easier for readers to digest.”\n\nHow to End an Email Professionally: Examples\n\nNow that you know what to write in a closing phrase, have your sign-off ready to go, and have nailed your signature, you know how to end your email professionally. Here are a few email examples for everyday work situations, from job search to team collaboration.\n\nIn a Networking Message\n\nI’d love to connect over the phone to learn more about the position.

That doesn’t mean you need to be devoid of humanity or empathy. Remember, there’s another person behind the screen.\n\n“Try to avoid being demanding or assumptive when asking for someone’s time or energy in your emails,” Perry says. “I think it’s important to communicate from a confident yet humble place.”\n\nLearn more professional email tips:\n\nHow to Respond to a Job Interview Email (With Examples)\n\nHow to Accept a Job Offer (With Examples)\n\nHow to Write a Job Interview Thank You Email (With Template)\n\nHow to Write a Thank You Email After a Zoom Interview\n\nFAQs\n\nImage credit: Canva"
