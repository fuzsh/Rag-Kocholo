        "text": "Well, you could use voltas, brackets that mark certain measures as being played only on certain repeats. They're a useful tool worth knowing about.\n\nBut in this case they would save you all of one measure, at the expense of making the music harder to follow. Voltas are best applied to longer segments, four repeated bars minimum, ideally eight or more.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with writing out a line or even a whole section multiple times. I'm a programmer, and I've caught myself thinking this way, that all redundancy must be quashedâ€”if that's you too, unlearn it! Human performers aren't machines, jumping around takes time and breaks up thoughts. Music repeats itself all over the place, and above all it should be readable. Never be afraid of writing out a short segment again."
