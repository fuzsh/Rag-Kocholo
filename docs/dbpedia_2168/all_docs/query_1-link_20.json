        "text": "Post by neverduplicated on\n\nWhich of your favorite musicians/bands do you think have the most sylistically diverse catalogues? I believe to be considered for this type of question, a musician/band would need at least 4 albums to their name and would have had to go through some major changes in their sound. Giving a little explanation with your answers will be appreciated!\n\nBjork - from her alt. rock days with the Sugarcubes to her varied solo career consisting of electronic, pop, R&B, and musical theatre influences, Bjork has never had a problem switching up her style and owning it.\n\nGwen Stefani - during her early days with No Doubt, she sang to fun, swinging, and angsty ska tracks. Then the band mixed their brand of rock with make Jamaican dancehall music for Rock Steady. After that, Gwen surprised everyone by fusing different types of 80's new age and modern dance sounds for her solo career. I expect her return to No Doubt will make her impressive catalogue even more diverse.\n\nSilverchair - their early days consisted of the grungy Frogstomp and Freak Show, but they quickly moved on to dark orchestral rock on Neon Ballroom followed by more grandiose, theatrical, and less angsty orchestral rock on Diorama. Then they pulled a complete 180 to come out with the very modern sounding Young Modern, their first album to have no traces of their early grunge days.\n\nMariah Carey - I know many will disagree with this as Mariah often gets slammed for not changing her style, but this woman does power ballads, booty-shakin' club bangers, spiritual songs, house tracks, 80's rock covers, and pure pop fun - sometimes all in one album.\n\nPost by halo19 on\n\nI'm surprised Prince was not mentioned in any previous post. He could play just about anything and any style. Not to mention a vast discography, even his bad stuff seems artistically motivated. He was dance/funk/R&B/rock/pop/psychedelic/everything. Sometimes his stuff is strange, sometimes just real catchy\n\nBeck has an intersting discography.\n\nHis 3 1994 independent albums: stereopathetic soulmanure, a big goof album of trash and lo-fi noise & the tuneful yet quirky folk of One Foot in the Grave.\n\nHis most well-rounded and by far best is Odelay, which is a genre in itself. Mutations and Midnite Vultures are genre considered genre excercise albums.\n\nDavid Bowie: He started out trying to be folksy, then went for hard rock (TMWSTW), then towards a great album in general and then his glam phase. By the mid-70's he made experimental electronic records with Brian Eno, as well as the Station to Station album that paved its way to those. Then he did new wave circa Scary Monsters, then commercial pop in his next two '80's albums. In the '90's he experimented with jungle and industrial.\n\nPost by Rose \"Payola\" Nylund on\n\nI was going to say before I even read the topic, if anyone says Mariah, I'm banning them and here it was in the original post.\n\nOf course I'm joking but I will respectfully disagree. Her house tracks, for example, are typically because they were remixed by someone else. Her covers of 80s rock songs never sound like rock songs themselves. They sound like songs sung by Mariah Carey in her usual style. Granted she has the pop world covered, R&B, nice ballads and upbeat tunes but she hardly stands out in any way compared to someone like Beyonce or Paula Abdul or Celine Dion as far as musical diversity goes.\n\nMy example would be Martina Sorbara. Lead singer of Dragonette. She started out doing folk music with her first indie release in the late 90s. Just her and a guitar. Her first major label album on Nettwerk was more folk but with higher production and it touched on country, pop and slightly jazz stylings. And you know it was all her because she wrote all of the songs herself, and not being a big name there would be no reason to try to mold the record into something spectacular so it was organic and natural. Later on, as part of Dragonette, she'd co-write synth pop songs that were a huge change from her folk days for sure, not to mention her role in collaborations with ambient musicians and dance-based acts like Basement Jaxx.\n\nNot the best example, I know, compared to Prince or Bowie but the one that came to my mind.\n\nPost by WotUNeed on\n\nA few people came to mind for me: Neil Young, Leonard Cohen, and Joni Mitchell. Ha, actually seeing the names together and not just thinking them, I realize I've picked three Canadian singers who got their starts in the 1960s.\n\nAnyway, all three of them started out in the folksy vein.\n\nYoung brought in some rock elements, then some harder rock elements, did some electronic experimentation (e.g., Trans), and now has settled into some rock stuff again.\n\nCohen would bring in a lot of pop and experimental jazz influences, then moved into some rock stuff, and now still blends a lot of styles.\n\nMitchell went from very folksy to a more pop-oriented sound to a very jazz-influenced sound to some rock-influenced stuff (during her stint at Geffen Records) and now has kind of settled into her own little niche.\n\nDefinitely agree with the mentions of Silverchair, Bowie, Prince, and Beck.\n\nPost by HEADOFTHEPACK on\n\nI'm surprised Prince was not mentioned in any previous post. He could play just about anything and any style. Not to mention a vast discography, even his bad stuff seems artistically motivated. He was dance/funk/R&B/rock/pop/psychedelic/everything.

In the '90's he experimented with jungle and industrial.\n\nGreat examples, when I saw the title of the thread, Bowie was the first big name that came to mind.\n\nI'd agree with Madonna to an extent, but she rather dips her toes into a variety of genres and gives them a pop sensibility as opposed to making an album fully outside of pop music. Not to her detriment of course, but perhaps not right for this thread.\n\nBjork's another one, I could imagine her releasing an album within any genre and not be too surprised by it. She's always been incredibly diverse and never really falters in her experimentation, for me anyhow.\n\nTo a lesser extent, I'll put Goldfrapp out there... I find it difficult to compare their records because they're all so different.\n\nPost by when the pawn... on\n\nMichael Jackson - he has won Grammys in General, Pop, Rock & R&B with nominations in dance categories. Some of his R&B songs cross into hip-hop territory and some of the slower pop songs will cross into smooth jazz territory.\n\nThriller alone won Michael grammy's in general, pop, rock and R&B. That's a diverse album!\n\nI don't want this to sound like s.tanning lol but I want to say that Glambert's debut album, for better or for worse, is pretty all over the place. Even just looking at the ballads, there's broadway-ish (Soaked), top/40 ready (Sleepwalker), hushed/electronic (ALS, Broken Open). Then there's dance stuff (FYE, Strut, SFW, IIHY, Fever), pop/rock (WWFM, PUU, Aftermath) and some glam-rock (Music Again, Down the Rabbit Hole). Only one album but I'm guessing that for the length of his career, Adam won't shy away from experimenting stylistically.\n\nPost by halo19 on\n\n^Lou Reed's a good one. Comparable to Bowie, but he's like the more crazy and druggy counterpart, never as mainstream.\n\nI think that Violent Femmes could be one. Their signature-known style is folk punk which people consider them innovators (first album has hints of doo wop even). But on the second album you can hear them experiment in country and free jazz, two genres you wouldn't expect in the same album. Then they had a more contemporary \"80's\" sound in the next album. They're interesting and fun."
