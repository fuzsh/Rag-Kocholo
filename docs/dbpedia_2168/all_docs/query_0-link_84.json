        "text": "Maddie Kerr, songwriter and lead vocalist of Nashville rock group Mercury, has signed a worldwide co-publishing deal with Concord Music Publishing. The deal, effective immediately, includes her full catalog and all future works.\n\nThe Franklin, Tennessee native developed the band, whose music emphasizes her songwriting as a form of survival and a way of finding clarity. Their singles “Trying” and “Woolgathering” drew attention in 2023 from publications such as Billboard, Nylon, Paste Magazine, Under The Radar and more.\n\nKerr’s latest three-track project, Together We Are One, You And I, is set for release on June 7 via Big Loud Rock. The collection features tunes “Born In Early May,” “Special” and “Crick,” and will be accompanied by a short film directed by Harrison Shook. Recorded in Asheville, North Carolina with producer Alex Farrar, the collection pushes her passionate rock writing toward new heights as she processes and makes sense of some intense feelings. Additionally, Kerr will join Dreamer Boy on dates across the country from June 7–18, and perform with Mercury for their first headlining Nashville show at The Blue Room on June 28.\n\n“Maddie is a once-in-a-lifetime kind of creator that exemplifies why so many of us get into the music business—to be part of something special and irreplicable,” says Melissa Spillman, VP of A&R, Concord Music Publishing Nashville. “She exudes an artistry that is rare and compelling, and I am so proud to add her to our Concord roster.”\n\n“Working with the Concord team has been an incredible honor and one of my most treasured experiences,” shares Kerr. “They are all so excited about music and passionate about their people. I feel so seen and accounted for and am so excited to continue my work with them!”"
