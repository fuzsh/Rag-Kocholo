        "text": "In a few short years, Zach Bryan has taken the country and Americana worlds by storm. And he's ready to do it again with his self-titled album.\n\nZach Bryan follows the wildly popular singer/songwriter's 2022 major label debut American Heartbreak, a sprawling triple album of raw country and roots songs that elevated Bryan from something of a cult favorite on the fringes of the genre to a full-blown superstar.\n\nBryan's latest record showcases his ever-evolving talent as both a singer and a songwriter; his singular voice shines, aching and gritty with a touch of soul and no shortage of twang. The album's 16 tracks incorporate a bit more of his own taste, too, as he taps several guests to join him on the LP, including Kacey Musgraves and The War and Treaty.\n\nWhat remains most true with Zach Bryan is that the star is still doing things his own way. Bryan wrote and produced the LP himself, releasing it under his own Belting Broncos imprint in partnership with Warner Records, through whom he also signed the imprint's first artist, Levi Turner, in June.\n\nAnd while Zach Bryan is likely to be a hit, the notoriously fame agnostic artist — a 2022 profile in the New York Times called him \"music's most reluctant new star\" — isn't concerned with sales or accolades. As he declared on social media, \"I've got no grand explanation for these songs, I got no riddle in reasoning behind writing them, I don't have a bullshit roll-out plan to stuff it in front of as many people as I can. I just wrote some poems and songs that I want to share because I think they're special.\"\n\nRejection of the traditional album roll-out model is in line with Bryan's DIY ethos, the very philosophy that helped catapult him from an active duty member of the Navy to arena-packing superstar in just a few short years. Accordingly, the only press Bryan did in advance of the new LP was an interview on \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast. As he's done for most of his career, Bryan likes to let his music speak for itself.\n\nAs Bryan kicks off his next chapter, check out six ways Bryan is singlehandedly changing the country music industry.\n\nHe Found Success The DIY Way\n\nBryan is part of a new generation of country stars who built fan bases themselves before attracting the attention of the Music Row machine. He posted his earliest songs to YouTube before finding even greater success on TikTok, and released two albums independently prior to his breakout LP American Heartbreak: 2019's DeAnn, named for his late mother, and 2020's Elisabeth, named for his ex-wife. What's more, he's toured relentlessly over the years, drawing a rabid following to his lively, rowdy shows.\n\nAnd that spirit hasn't seemed to wane in the wake of releasing Zach Bryan, as he wrote the following Instagram caption when sharing the record's track list: \"really proud to call the writing and production on somethin' all mine, thank y'all for your patience, I didn't make this album to appease people who will never be happy anyways, I made it for my people.\"\n\nHe's Taken On The Ticketing Industry\n\nAnyone who's tried to buy a concert ticket in recent years knows how difficult the secondary market has made it for regular fans to afford to see their favorite artists live. With his rabid following, Bryan would be a prime target for resellers if he hadn't taken proactive steps to ensure that tickets land in the hands of actual fans, not scalpers. For his 2023 Burn Burn Burn Tour, Bryan partnered with AXS to prevent for-profit resale, and also made sure that all tickets were reasonably priced — the most expensive ticket available cost $156, a far cry from the several hundreds of dollars fans typically have to drop on concerts now.\n\nAnd if that weren't enough, in 2022 Bryan dropped a live EP called All My Homies Hate Ticketmaster, making plain how he feels about the monopoly currently controlling much of the live ticketing market.\n\nHe's A Veteran\n\nCountry music has strong ties to the military, but few modern stars have actually served in some capacity. Prior to pursuing music full time, Bryan served as an Aviation Ordnanceman in the Navy, having enlisted at the age of 17.\n\nWhile serving, he completed tours in Djibouti and Bahrain, stealing pockets of free time to work on his songwriting. He soon found fans after posting music online and, after eight years of service, was honorably discharged in 2021 upon signing a record deal with Warner Records.\n\nWhen announcing his discharge on social media, Bryan shared, \"If it was my decision, I would never get out of the world's greatest Navy, but here I am and they kindly honorably discharged me to go play some music. Can't tell if I'm a coward or if I'm chasing a dream but regardless, the best eight years of my life were spent serving the best country in the whole damn world.\"\n\nMilitary service runs in Bryan's family, as both his father and his late mother served in the Navy. Bryan was actually born in Japan while his father was stationed there. The family moved around throughout Bryan's young life, making him a Navy brat.\n\nHe's Maintained An Aura Of Mystery\n\nBryan's songs are honest and confessional, but he famously shares little about his personal life outside of what he reveals in his music. The songwriter rarely gives interviews, speaking with the media even less since seeing his star rise after the success of American Heartbreak. And most of his social media posts are about music and touring, occasionally sharing candid snaps with friends or photos of his dog, fittingly named Jack Daniel's.\n\nThough many country stars find themselves, willingly or not, involved in the current culture wars, Bryan (so far) has managed to stay removed — with the occasional exception, like when hecalled out Travis Tritt for removing Bud Light from his tour rider in the wake of the beer brand's involvement with trans social media personality Dylan Mulvaney.\n\nSome Of His Fan-Favorite Songs Aren't Even Officially Released\n\nWhen Bryan posted the track listing for Zach Bryan on Aug. 18, many fans took to the comments to lament songs they love that didn't make the cut. The top comment on Bryan's Instagram post of the track listing reads, \"zachary lane we are BEGGING for deep satin,\" with over three thousand likes emphasizing the sentiment.\n\nOther fans are hoping for \"Somebody,\" an especially raw love song that namechecks Tracy Chapman, and the wistful \"Screen Door.\" That passion from fans for unreleased music is yet another indication that Bryan is far from your average artist.\n\nHis Powers Extend Beyond Music\n\nSure, Bryan can pen a hit song, but he also helped the Oakland Athletics win a baseball game.\n\nOn Aug. 21, the team was playing the Kansas City Royals and found the game tied in the bottom of the ninth inning. Oakland left fielder Brent Rooker was itching to finish the game so he could head across the street to Bryan's concert at the Oakland Arena, so he took matters into his own hands, hitting a two-run homer to end the game and clinch the victory for his team. Rooker not only made it to Bryan's show, but got to join the star on stage to sing together.\n\nOther prominent sports figures who have gotten into the action at Bryan's shows include WWE stars Brock Lesnar and Braun Strowman, Oklahoma State University football coach Mike Gundy and San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey. And in a particularly funny, quintessentially Zach Bryan moment, New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones joined him during a tour stop in Queens — but Bryan, an avowed Philadelphia Eagles fan, quickly took back the mic to yell, \"Go Birds!\"\n\nTour Diary: See Parker McCollum's Favorite Photos & Memories From His Biggest Year On The Road Yet\n\nCharles Wesley Godwin never intended to play for audiences when he picked up a guitar for the first time in college. Now, the 30-year-old Godwin is a full-blown country star, playing stadium shows and prestigious music festivals as one of the genre's fastest rising talents.\n\nGodwin's musical power and allure lie in the ability to inhabit both a superstar persona and family-man image. He's equally comfortable belting his raucous, anthemic \"Cue Country Roads,\" and serenading his baby daughter in \"Dance in Rain,\" a touching song about his vision for her future. Tapping into his West Virginia roots and family history, Godwin's authentic, raw storytelling hasn't just widely resonated — it's helped the singer realize his calling.\n\nKnown for his deep, piercing voice and intimate portraits of human experiences, Godwin first endeared himself to audiences with songs like \"Hardwood Floors,\" a sweet love song to his wife, and \"Seneca Creek,\" a ballad from his first album, 2019's Seneca. Across three studio albums thus far, Godwin mixes powerful vocals and relatable, heartfelt lyrics, aligning him with the likes of Zach Bryan, Tyler Childers, and Sturgill Simpson.\n\nThe son of a coal miner and a teacher, Godwin dreamed of playing professional football and attended West Virginia University to study finance. After moving on from college football dreams, he taught himself guitar, learning country classics to fill the football void.\n\nBut while studying abroad in Estonia, one of Godwin's roommates took his guitar to a club show and coaxed Godwin up on stage after the set. His cover of John Denver's \"Take Me Home Country Roads\" — Godwin's college theme song and current show closer — earned him his second gig, performing at a fashion show. He was hooked.\n\nAfter college, Godwin spent most of a decade touring relentlessly, crisscrossing the country to play bars and coffee houses. As he transitioned from covering favorite songs to writing his own, Godwin honed his writing chops and musical voice, intent on figuring out who he would be as a musician.\n\nHis latest studio album, 2023's aptly titled Family Ties, showcases the versatility and emotional depth that continues to make his songs resonate intensely. It includes upbeat country bangers like \"Two Weeks Gone\" and \"Family Ties\"; ruminations on deep generational connections to family, including his journey to understand his dad in \"Miner Imperfections\" and recounting his mother's heart-wrenching experience in \"The Flood\"; and raw, personal reflections on his love for his children, from \"Gabriel\" to \"Tell the Babies I Love Them.\"\n\nAfter signing his first major record label deal and opening for Zach Bryan in 2023, Godwin will spend 2024 headlining shows around the United States, also supporting Luke Combs on several dates and playing festivals like Stagecoach, Bonnaroo and Under the Big Sky.\n\nAhead of his tour launch on April 4, Godwin spoke with GRAMMY.com about his inspiration and writing, chasing his musical dreams, and his favorite career \"pinch me\" moments — so far.\n\nHow did you get started in music?\n\nI watched the Avett Brothers in the 2011 GRAMMYs and was wowed by it, and thought maybe picking a guitar up would be a productive hobby to have. And then over time I began to realize I actually had the talent.\n\nThat hobby worked out okay.\n\nI've always joked — even though people are like \"Oh man, that's crazy, you didn't find it until you were in your 20s\" — I'm like, \"Well, at least I found my thing.\" I feel very fortunate. I feel like things could have easily gone a different way.\n\nWas music of interest to you? What kind of music did your parents play when you were growing up?\n\nMy dad listened to oldies radio, a lot of pop music from the '60s and the '70s. I had a lot of the Beatles songs and CCR songs stuck in my head as a little kid.\n\nI would casually consume whatever was put right in front of me, but I wasn't big into music. I was worried about sports. I wanted to be good at football.\n\nWhat was it like for you picking up a guitar the first time?\n\nIt was frustrating. My fingers wouldn't go where I wanted them to. And it seemed very difficult. But I would just bite it off in 15-minute chunks each day. I wouldn't quit.\n\nIt wasn't until about a year into it that I could actually start stringing chords together. My dad had gotten a mining engineering degree, and to do some pretty high-level calculus, he always told me when I was growing up, \"Math, it just clicks one day, as long as you don't give up on it.\"\n\nTell me more about your dad, for whom you wrote \"Miner Imperfections.\" It sounds like you got your work ethic from him.\n\nWhen he grew up, most of his friends were getting drafted to Vietnam. He had applied for the mines and he gave himself a timeline. He said, If the mines don't call within two weeks, I'm going to join the Air Force, because if I'm gonna get sent to Vietnam, I might as well join on my own terms. He ended up getting called by the mines and went underground in his early 20s. And worked his ass off.\n\nHe'd met my mom, and they created a better life for themselves. [They] were able to elevate themselves economically and give my brother and I a great life growing up, and the ability to chase our dreams.\n\nHe didn't love the mines, but he was good at it. And it was a way for him to make a good living. My dad had an amazing work ethic. He was very, very hard-nosed, independent, principled. And he taught me a lot of that.\n\nAs I've gotten older, I've grown to appreciate him more and more. And [my parents] gave me the mental tools I needed to be able to go through that whole crucible of going all across the country for a decade and sleeping in my car and playing in bars and restaurants and cafes, basically living well below the poverty line for many years, to make this dream of mine come true.\n\nI think the very first song of yours I heard was \"Seneca Creek.\" What's the story behind that song?\n\nThat's about my grandparents, on my mother's side. My mom's side of the family is from Seneca Rocks, West Virginia. They're part of the hillbilly highway, they moved up to Canton, Ohio. My granddad was working for Ford Motor Company. And he got drafted to go fight in Korea. So he went off and was a tank commander and fought in Korea for two years and went back to the Ford Motor Company when he got back.\n\nThey started a family and started building a life. They ended up moving back to West Virginia in the early '60s, and took over my great grandfather's General Store and farmed cattle. My grandmother was the postmaster.\n\nThey had a remarkable life, full of highs and lows and it was a very, very human story. And I thought it translated well into song.\n\nWhat experiences in your life have colored the kinds of stories you want to tell in your music?\n\nI draw on my family, my wife and my kids. That's really some of the most profound experiences I've had.\n\nMy dad, when he was my age, was crawling in less than three feet of coal. So I don't want to write too much about \"playing on the road was hard.\"\n\nOne strong point of mine is I can observe somebody else and find the little nuggets of humanity to put into song that can still seem very personal and moving to people.\n\nBut you've also got these deeper generational connections and stories, too.\n\nI have a lot of interesting family members in the family tree that I've been able to pull from. My mom's side came over in the potato famine in the mid-1800s. My dad's side, a lot of them were even here before the United States was the United States.\n\nThere's a lot of interesting and rich family history to draw from — moonshiners on my mother's side, there's been soldiers, drunkards, teachers and miners. My great grandfather on my dad's side, he used to eat a raw potato in the mines every day for lunch until Italians came over and showed the Irish guys how to eat better.\n\nYou've talked about your music sounding like it's from West Virginia. What does that mean? What is West Virginia music to you?\n\nBefore I put my first record out, I understood that I needed to find what my natural voice was. And make sure that I wasn't just trying to mimic somebody else.\n\nI would not be able to pull off sounding like I'm trying to sing rodeo country. But I can sound like I'm from West Virginia, because that is the truth.\n\nI think it has to have some bluegrass, if we're talking country music. Because you [also] got [late West Virginia native] Bill Withers, who is one of the best soul singers ever.\n\nStories about rural places and working class people often get tokenized and stereotyped. When you're writing songs, how do you honor the people you're writing about instead of making them stereotypes?\n\nI just try my best. There's been a lot of lines that when I'm working on songs over the years, I've been like, \"that's not it,\" and then put a line through it and try to come up with something better or more positive or more honest.\n\nI'd rather shine a light on the more admirable character traits, either people in my family that I'm writing about or made up characters. I also try not to make it too unrealistic. I have a lot of songs about regret, which is something that [is] very human. But I definitely don't want to go around glorifying things that aren't really good for society or community.\n\nYou've talked about how you felt stuck when you wrote your latest album, Family Ties. What was that feeling? And how did you get out of that rut?\n\nI had a bunch of people on payroll for the first time in my life. Labels had come into the picture; my wife was just about to have our second child; we had a house we just bought the year prior. I had all these things around me that I'd never had around me before. I was putting pressure on myself, because I wasn't just this broke guy anymore that only needed enough to fill up his gas tank.\n\nI let that affect my mind and my creativity, and my productivity with the notebook. The way I got out of it was just realizing — this sounds so cliche, but it's true, and it's true with music, and so many other things in life — that you can only control the things that you can control.\n\nI felt like writing about my family is what I wanted to do. Just because there's so much love and guilt that I was feeling at that time. The birth my children — my daughter just being born, my son was still really young, with my wife and, being gone for hundreds of days [in] years prior, but then I was home that whole pandemic year, which was this super special time, but also just so weird after all those years of being gone all the time, and then going back to being gone all the time.\n\nNow that all of that hard work has started paying off, what have been some of your biggest \"pinch me, I can't believe this is happening\" moments?\n\nRecently, I opened for Jason Isbell and for Turnpike Troubadours. Those were folks that I was listening to a decade ago, in the middle of the night, trying to drive home from some gig far away.\n\nAnd throughout our tour this year, we're doing these Luke Combs dates, and the Avett Brothers are on two of them. The whole reason I picked up a guitar, here we are over a decade later, and I'm going to be shaking their hands before we play a stadium. And this whole thing started with me just sitting on a couch in college watching them at the GRAMMYs. So that's gonna be a \"pinch me\" moment, for sure.\n\n8 Artists Bringing Traditional Country Music Back: Zach Top, Randall King, Emily Nenni & More On Why \"What's Old Becomes Beloved Again\"\n\nWe may have known about Toby Keith's stomach cancer diagnosis for nearly two years, but that didn't keep the news of his Feb. 5 death from hitting hard. The oftentimes outspoken country music star enjoyed a three-decade career as one of the genre's beloved hitmakers, courtesy of unabashed hits like \"Who's Your Daddy?,\" \"Made In America\" and \"I Wanna Talk About Me.\"\n\nOccasionally his in-your-face persona clashed with folks, particularly when it came to his political views in recent years. But for the most part, it was Keith's blue-collar upbringing and work ethic that shined through and resonated with his legion of listeners.\n\nIt wasn't until his thirties that the future Songwriters Hall of Famer landed his first record deal in 1993, following years grinding away as a rodeo hand, in oil fields and as a semi-professional football player to make ends meet. The Oklahoma-born crooner would go on to record 20 No.1 hits, sell over 40 million records across 26 albums, and gross nearly $400 million touring — cementing himself as one of country music's most successful artists in the process.\n\nAs we look back on Keith's life and legacy, here are five essential cuts from the seven-time GRAMMY nominee, whose memory will live on in the hearts of country music artists and fans alike.\n\n\"Should've Been A Cowboy\" (1993)\n\nFew artists strike gold with their maiden release, but Keith did just that when his song \"Should've Been A Cowboy\" launched in February 1993. The upbeat track received widespread acclaim, eventually reaching No. 1 on the Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart a few months later.\n\n\"Should've Been A Cowboy\" takes on a distinctly traditional tone as Keith romanticizes cowboy culture by referencing classic westerns like Gunsmoke with nods to Marshall Dillon and Miss Kitty in addition to six-shooters, cattle drives and Texas Rangers abound. The tune also reinforces the notion that cowboys just have more fun, whether its \"stealin' the young girls' hearts, just like Gene [Autry] and Roy [Rogers]\" or \"runnin' wild through the hills chasin' Jesse James.\"\n\nBy the looks of Keith's career, he certainly had his fair share of fun, and it may not have come if it weren't for \"Should've Been A Cowboy.\"\n\n\"How Do You Like Me Now?!\" (1999)\n\nAfter a successful '90s run (which included two more No. 1s in \"Who's That Man\" and \"Me Too\"), Keith kicked off the 2000s with his fourth No. 1 hit, \"How Do You Like Me Now?!\" In signature Toby Keith fashion, he confronts his haters by asking the titular, rhetorical question, posed to his high school's valedictorian — who was also his crush. \"I couldn't make you love me but I always dreamed about livin' in your radio,\" he sings on the brazen chorus.\n\nThe song is a stern reminder to never let anyone keep you from chasing your dreams; it's also a lesson of standing strong on your convictions. Its message also proved fitting for Keith's career: After Mercury Records Nashville rejected the song (and its namesake album) in the late '90s, Keith got out of his deal with them in favor of signing with DreamWorks Records, with whom he released the project a year later. Not only did the single go on to spend five weeks at No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart, but it became the singer's first major crossover hit.\n\n\"Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)\" (2002)\n\nKeith was never afraid to share his opinion in public or in song, especially when it came to displaying his patriotism and appreciation for those who protect the United States. While the Okie approached this from a softer side on 2003's \"American Soldier,\" his most renowned musings on the subject without a doubt came a year earlier with \"Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American).\"\n\nOn the angsty ballad — which was written in the wake of his father's March 2001 death and the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks — Keith channels a universal feeling of American hurt and pride. \"Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)\" inspired an equal outpouring of support and outrage that, for better or worse depending on where you stand, helped cement the song into the annals of country music lore.\n\n\"I Love This Bar\" (2003)\n\nWe've all got our favorite watering hole full of its own quirks and characters, from winners to losers, chain-smokers and boozers. Keith taps into that feel-good, hometown hang feeling with \"I Love This Bar,\" a lighthearted tale from 2003's Shock'n Y'all that makes dingy dive bars feel like the prime party destination.\n\nThe midtempo track — Keith's 12th No. 1 — further plays into country music drinking tropes as Keith proclaims, \"I like my girlfriend, I like to take her out to dinner, I like a movie now and then\" before making a hard pivot, adding \"but I love this bar.\"\n\nAll joking aside, the song, and all of the unique individuals described within it, have a harmony to them inside those hallowed walls. It's a kinship that seems more and more difficult to find in today's world, and a sentiment best captured at the song's conclusion: \"come as you are.\"\n\n\"As Good As I Once Was\" (2005)\n\nYour best days may be behind you, but that doesn't mean you can't still live your best life and thrive in the present — even if you don't get over hangovers as quickly as you used to.\n\nThat youthful wisdom is distilled into every lyric of \"As Good As I Once Was,\" a reminiscent story in which a then-44-year-old Keith recounts his prime as a lover, drinker and fighter humbly. That being said, his pride is still quick to take charge with convictions like \"I still throw a few back, talk a little smack, when I'm feelin' bullet proof.\"\n\nLasting six weeks at No. 1, \"As Good As I Once Was\" was the biggest of the 15 chart-toppers Keith tallied in the 2000s. And though he scored one more in the following decade (along with several other hits, including the playful drinking song \"Red Solo Cup\"), \"As Good As I Once Was\" will live on as one of Keith's quintessential messages of fun-loving confidence: \"I ain't as good as I once was, but I'm as good once, as I ever was.\"\n\n8 Artists Bringing Traditional Country Music Back: Zach Top, Randall King, Emily Nenni & More On Why \"What's Old Becomes Beloved Again\"\n\nThat's a wrap for Music's Biggest Night! The 2024 GRAMMYs were extraordinarily stuffed with incredible moments, from performances to historic wins to unforgettable surprises.\n\nSeveral of the most memorable moments came from first-time winners. In fact, there were 126 at the 66th GRAMMY Awards, spanning a wide array of talent across genres. From Colombian songstress Karol G to indie rock supergroup boygenius and country singer Brandy Clark, take a look at some of the biggest acts that took home their very first golden gramophones.\n\nMiley Cyrus Celebrated Her First Wins With A Pumped-Up Performance\n\nMiley Cyrus may have taken home the coveted Record Of The Year for \"Flowers,\" but a different Category may have been the biggest achievement. Just before her performance on the GRAMMY stage, Cyrus won her first-ever golden gramophone for Best Pop Solo Performance.\n\n\"This award is amazing, but I really hope it doesn't change anything, because my life was beautiful yesterday,\" Cyrus said while accepting her first award.\n\n\"Flowers\" is featured on Cyrus' 2023 album Endless Summer Vacation. \"Flowers\" was also nominated for GRAMMYs for Song Of The Year.\n\nKarol G's First GRAMMYs Resulted In Her First GRAMMY\n\nKarol G has had a meteoric rise over the past several years, and that continued unabated at Music's Biggest Night.\n\nAt the 2024 GRAMMYs Premiere Ceremony, Karol G won the GRAMMY for Best Música Urbana Album, for her 2023 LP Mañana Será Bonito. (She'd previously been nominated at the 2022 GRAMMYs, for the same category, for KG0516.\n\n\"Hello everybody, my name is Karol G. I am from Medellín, Colombia. This is my first time at the GRAMMYs, and this is my first time holding my own GRAMMY,\" she said, utterly concisely.\n\nVictoria Monét Completed A Lifelong Goal…\n\nVictoria Monét won big at the GRAMMYs, including taking home the award for Best New Artist. The singer also took home golden gramophones for Best R&B Album and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical for Jaguar II.\n\nMonét has been nominated for 10 GRAMMYs over her career as both a solo act and songwriter. When accepting the GRAMMY Award for Best New Artist, Monét compared herself to a plant growing from soil.\n\n\"My roots have been growing underneath ground, unseen, for so long, and I feel like today I'm sprouting, finally above ground,\" she said.\n\n…And So Did Coco Jones\n\nMonét’s fellow R&B nominee — and one-time collaborator — Coco Jones also turned a nearly 15-year journey into GRAMMY success, winning Best R&B Performance for her song \"ICU.\"\n\nTyla, Me'shell NdegeOcello & Kylie Minogue Won In First-Time Categories\n\nAt the 2024 GRAMMYs, there were three new Categories — which meant three inaugural winners. South African singer/songwriter Tyla took home her first GRAMMY with her win for Best African Music Performance for her smash hit \"Water,\" while Me'shell NdegeOcello and Kylie Minogue notched their second wins each, in the new Best Alternative Jazz Album and Best Pop Dance Recording Categories, respectively.\n\nAfter 16 Years, Paramore Got GRAMMY Gold\n\nMyspace-era alt wizards Paramore enjoyed a stunning resurgence with their 2023 album This Is Why. They'd been nominated in past ceremonies — their first nominations coming in 2008 — but at the 2024 GRAMMYs, they nabbed the trophy for the prestigious Best Rock Album Category. And with their first win, they made GRAMMY history: Paramore is the first female-fronted rock band to win Best Rock Album.\n\nLainey Wilson Continued A Massive Year With A GRAMMY\n\nMuch like Tyla, country star Lainey Wilson nailed it on the first try — as far as the Recording Academy goes. She was nominated twice at the 2024 GRAMMYs, and took home a golden gramophone for Best Country Album, for Bell Bottom Country.\n\nClearly, the phenomenon of a first-time GRAMMY nominee taking it home transcends genres and continents.\n\nSecond Time Was A Charm For Zach Bryan\n\nCountry great Zach Bryan's been nominated before — at the 2023 GRAMMYs, for Best Country Solo Performance, for \"Something in the Orange.\"\n\nThis time, he brought home the golden gramophone for Best Country Duo/Group Performance, for \"I Remember Everything.\" Bryan was also nominated for Best Country Album (Zach Bryan) and Best Country Song, also for \"I Remember Everything.\"\n\nFirst-Time Nominees Boygenius Won Three Times\n\nWomen dominated the 2024 GRAMMYs, which certainly applies to boygenius — who consist of three women, and cleaned up at the ceremony. And, they too were first-time nominees\n\nBoygenius took home three GRAMMYs revolving around 2023's the record, including Best Alternative Music Album, Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance — both for the stirring, gender-flipped \"Not Strong Enough.\"\n\nPeso Pluma Went From First-Time Nominee To First-Time Winner\n\nMúsica Mexicana, stand up! Upstart Peso Pluma took home the GRAMMY for Best Música Mexicana Album (Including Tejano), for his tremendous album GÉNESIS.\n\nAs the status of Mexico on the global stage continues to swell, take Pluma's win as a sign to keep your ear to the ground.\n\nBrandy Clark Left A Winner\n\nRoots-heavy singer Brandy Clark's been nominated for 17 GRAMMYs over the years, but never gave up.\n\nAt the 2024 GRAMMYs, she won for Best Americana Performance for \"Dear Insecurity\" — and she played a corker of a version at the Premiere Ceremony with the string duo SistaStrings.\n\nFred again.. Proved To Be Dance Music’s Latest Hero\n\n2022 saw Fred again.. rise as one of dance music's most promising new stars with the release of his compilation album, USB, and his third studio album, Actual Life 3 — and both helped him win his first pair of GRAMMYs in 2024. USB's \"Rumble\" (a collaboration with Skrillex and Four Tet) scored Best Dance/Electronic Recording, and Actual Life 3 took home Best Dance/Electronic Music Album.\n\nTaylor Swift & Kacey Musgraves Celebrated Historic Firsts\n\nWhile winning a GRAMMY was nothing new to 2024 winners Taylor Swift and Kacey Musgraves, they both had feats that marked big firsts in GRAMMY history. Swift became the first artist to be awarded Album Of The Year four times with her win for Midnights, while Musgraves' win for Best Country Duo/Group Performance for her Zach Bryan collaboration \"I Remember Everything\" made her the first artist to win in all four Country Field Categories.\n\nKeep checking GRAMMY.com for stories about the 2024 GRAMMYs — and the Recording Academy thanks you for tuning into Music's Biggest Night! If you missed it, stream it on Paramount+ for maximum musical glory.\n\n2024 GRAMMY Nominations: See The Full Winners & Nominees List\n\nIf 2023 wasn't the biggest year ever for mainstream success in country music, it came mighty close.\n\nAcross the three major fronts in the music industry — live concerts, music streams and sales, and chart performance — country music reminded audiences why it's a vital American music form and a conversation starter in our culture.\n\nAccording to Billboard, 48 years have passed since more country artists racked up more No. 1 hits on its all-genre Hot 100 chart. This year saw chart-toppers from record-breaker Morgan Wallen (\"Last Night\"), established hitmaker Jason Aldean (\"Try That in a Small Town\"), viral newcomer Oliver Anthony (\"Rich Men North of Richmond\"), and 2022's big success story, Zach Bryan (\"I Remember Everything\" featuring Kacey Musgraves). Back in 1975, four country artists and five songs reached the Hot 100's summit: Glen Campbell, B.J. Thomas, Freddy Fender, and two cuts by John Denver.\n\nMeanwhile, more than a dozen country artists landed on the Billboard Year-End Top Artists chart, with Wallen and Luke Combs landing in the top five. In addition, Apple Music named Wallen its top global music artist of 2023.\n\nBut enough prelude — let's get down to why the genre has been booming, by tracking the five biggest trends in country music in 2023.\n\nThere Was Massive Crossover\n\nMorgan Wallen pulled country music's biggest crossover on the charts, ending the year with five of the top 50 most streamed songs of 2023 on Spotify, as well as 11 of the top 100 songs on Apple Music (all U.S. charts). He landed eight songs on the year-end Billboard Hot 100, including \"Last Night,\" a tale of whisky-fueled love and regret driven by acoustic guitar and clap-along percussion, which held the top spot for 16 weeks, the most for a non-collaboration song in the chart's 65-year history. It was also the most streamed song on Apple Music globally, contributing to the streaming service naming Wallen its top global music artist of 2023.\n\nZach Bryan became the second artist to place at least 18 songs on the Hot 100 chart in the same week when he dropped his self-titled sophomore album in August — second only to Wallen's record of 36 songs, coinciding with the March release of his double-album One Thing at a Time. Zach Bryan is nominated for Best Country Album at the 2024 GRAMMYs, alongside Kelsea Ballerini's Rolling Up The Welcome Mat, Brothers Osborne's Brothers Osborne, Tyler Childers' Rustin' In The Rain, and Lainey Wilson's Bell Bottom Country. (More on Bryan later.)\n\nThe Hot 100 further indicated the genre's crossover success in early August, when the top three positions were occupied by country songs: Jason Aldean's \"Try That in a Small Town,\" Morgan Wallen's \"Last Night,\" and Luke Combs' cover of Tracy Chapman's 1988 classic. Not only was it the first time in history that country songs dominated the first three spots on the all-genre chart, but it also happened two more times on Aug. 26 and Sept. 2. \"Last Night\" and \"Fast Car\" also received nominations for the 2024 GRAMMYs; \"Last Night\" is nominated for Best Country Song at the 2024 GRAMMYs alongside with Brandy Clark's \"Buried,\" Zach Bryan and Kacey Musgraves' \"I Remember Everything,\" Tyler Childers' \"In Your Love,\" and Chris Stapleton's \"White Horse,\" while \"Fast Car\" is Best Country Solo Performance alongside \"White Horse,\" \"Buried,\" \"In Your Love.\" and Dolly Parton's \"The Last Thing on My Mind.\"\n\nWhat's more, two of the eight Best New Artist nominees at the 2024 GRAMMYs are country acts, \"Son of a Sinner\" star Jelly Roll and soulful husband-and-wife duo The War and Treaty. They're nominated alongside Gracie Abrams, Fred again.., Ice Spice, Coco Jones, Noah Kahan and Victoria Monét.\n\nLainey Wilson celebrated a banner crossover year both in music and television. Along with parlaying the hit Paramount series \"Yellowstone\" into more exposure for her music, she became the first female artist in history to have four No. 1 hits on country radio in a calendar year thanks to \"Heart Like A Truck,\" \"Wait in the Truck\" with HARDY, \"Watermelon Moonshine\" and \"Save Me\" with Jelly Roll — all of which cracked the top 30 of the all-genre Hot 100.\n\nSeveral Musicians Court Controversy\n\nHistorically, popular country music tends to revolve around themes often imbued with imagery and anecdotes from small-town American life, from love won and lost to simply having a good time. But in 2023, politics infiltrated country music in a more mainstream way than perhaps ever before — even prompting Maren Morris to declare she was leaving country music. \"I thought I'd like to burn it to the ground and start over,\" Morris told the Los Angeles Times in September. \"But it's burning itself down without my help.\"\n\nJason Aldean's single \"Try That in a Small Town\" didn't cause much of a ruckus when it dropped in May, but the promotional video for the song, released in July, certainly kicked a hornet's nest of dissatisfaction. The lyrics begin with a carjacking and a robbery, then confront advocates of gun control and flex how \"good ol' boys, raised up right\" will step up to defend their own. The song \"refers to the feeling of a community that I had growing up,\" Aldean wrote on Twitter, \"where we took care of our neighbors, regardless of differences of background or belief.\"\n\nBut if he was only looking to reboot the s—-kickin' country-boy theme of Hank Williams Jr's 1981 song \"A Country Boy Can Survive,\" he lost the plot with the video. The clip intersperses shots of Aldean and his band performing with footage of riots and destruction reminiscent of the 2020 racial protests sparked by the deaths of Elijah McClain, Breona Taylor, George Floyd and others by police force. And the filming location, the Maury County Courthouse in Columbia, Tennessee — site of the 1927 lynching of an 18-year-old Black man by a white mob — only stoked tensions. The controversy eventually dimmed, but not before the song hit No. 1 on the Hot 100.\n\nJust three days after Aldean's song reached the top, a folk song by an unknown artist with no previous history in the music business hit YouTube and spread like wildfire. \"Rich Men North of Richmond,\" written and performed by Oliver Anthony, sparked a controversy of its own for a handful of lyrics shaming \"obese welfare\" recipients amid righteous blue-collar anger directed at politicians who are out of touch with the working class.\n\nConservative audiences latched onto the song, and it even made an appearance at the Republican presidential debate on August 23, three days before it claimed the No. 1 spot on the Hot 100 that Aldean held just a few weeks earlier. In response, Anthony chastised the right-wingers who thought he was one of them, as well as critics on the left whom he felt mischaracterized his words. \"That song is written about the people on that stage — and a lot more, too,\" he said in a 10-minute video posted to YouTube.\n\nCountry Icons Were Saluted\n\nCountry music has seen its share of memorable covers in more recent years, from Johnny Cash's iconic version of Nine Inch Nails' \"Hurt\" to Sturgill Simpson's take on the Nirvana classic \"In Bloom.\" But the practice reached a new peak in 2023 thanks to performances and recordings from present-day and legacy stars alike.\n\nNashville hitmaker Luke Combs channeled his love for Tracy Chapman's 1988 hit \"Fast Car\" into a faithful cover on his 2023 album Gettin' Old. Combs's version reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 (Chapman's original peaked at No. 6) and has been certified double Platinum by the RIAA, in addition to winning both Single of the Year and Song of the Year at the Country Music Association awards—making Chapman the first Black woman to ever win a CMA trophy.\n\nAfter Dolly Parton was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2022, she took her honor quite literally. Parton collaborated with artists ranging from Judas Priest shrieker Rob Halford to Pink and Elton John on 30 recordings, including massive hits like \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" and \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me.\" The album's first single, the original composition \"World On Fire,\" reached No. 1 on Billboard's Rock Digital Song Sales chart.\n\nParton also turned up on A Tribute to The Judds, another star-studded covers album, performing \"Mama He's Crazy\" with Lainey Wilson. Spearheaded by Wynonna Judd in tribute to her mother Naomi, her partner in the duo from 1983 until her death in April 2022, the album brings together some of country music's biggest names on 14 classics from the legendary group. Evergreen it-couple Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton take on \"Love Is Alive,\" while Jelly Roll, K. Michelle and the Fisk Jubilee Singers perform \"Love Can Build a Bridge.\" The album also features Reba McEntire, Carly Pearce, Jennifer Nettles and Gabby Barrett on a rendition of \"Girls Night Out.\"\n\nEven the Rolling Stones dabbled in the country world this year — well, sort of. The 14-song tribute album Stoned Cold Country features Eric Church on a properly sixties-sounding \"Gimme Shelter,\" Elle King on a faithful version of \"Tumbling Dice\" embellished with pedal steel guitar flourishes, and guitar hero Marcus King performing the Sticky Fingers deep cut \"Can't You Hear Me Knocking.\" Elsewhere, Brothers Osborne join The War and Treaty on a particularly soulful recording of \"It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It),\" and artists like Ashley McBryde, Brooks & Dunn and Maren Morris put their spin on their favorite Stones tunes.\n\nAlt-Country Blew Up\n\nCall it Americana, alt-country, singer/songwriter country — but the subgenre rooted in artists like Gram Parsons, John Prine and Lucinda Williams has evolved from its days as an influential side attraction to a force impacting charts, sales and box office receipts. In 2023, artists from what was once the fringes of mainstream country music showed how much they're really part of the fabric of the genre.\n\nNo artist exemplifies this surge more than Zach Bryan, who parlayed his successes in 2022 into an even bigger 2023, topping the Hot 100 and Billboard 200 albums chart for the first time, and headlining a sold-out arena tour. Folk-pop singer/songwriter Noah Kahan, who joined Bryan for the song \"Sarah's Place\" on Bryan's Boys of Faith EP, also found major success with songs originally performed for his 2022 album Stick Season, including a duet with Kacey Musgraves on \"She Calls Me Back,\" released in October.\n\nThe War and Treaty fuse gospel and soul influences with alt-country on \"Blank Page\" from the 2023 album Lover's Game, which picked up a nomination for the Best American Roots Song GRAMMY (competing against \"California Sober\" by Billy Strings Featuring Willie Nelson, \"Cast Iron Skillet\" by Jason Isbell And The 400 Unit, \"Dear Insecurity\" by Brandy Clark Featuring Brandi Carlile, and \"The Returner\" by Allison Russell). The husband-and-wife duo Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Trotter scored soulful hits with \"That's How Love Is Made,\" as well as their own team-up with Zach Bryan on \"Hey Driver,\" which peaked at No. 14 on the Hot 100 and No. 5 on the Hot Country Songs chart.\n\nThe return of Oklahoma sextet Turnpike Troubadours generated excitement from Texas to Tennessee and beyond, as the band headlined arenas and amphitheaters like Red Rocks in Colorado and L.A.'s Greek Theatre, plus a three-night stand in Boston. Frontman Evan Felker split the fold in 2019 but returned two years later, culminating in the release of A Cat in the Rain, their sixth album for their independent imprint Bossier City Records, in August 2023.\n\nCollaborations Were Abundant\n\nCovers weren't the only way that collaborations flourished in country music this year. In fact, only one nominee in the Best Country Duo/Group Performance category at the 66th GRAMMY Awards is an actual full-time group — that's Brothers Osborne, who is nominated alongside pairings of Dierks Bentley and Billy Strings (\"High Note\"), Zach Bryan and Kacey Musgraves (\"I Remember Everything\"), Vince Gill and Paul Franklin (\"Kissing Your Picture (Is So Cold)\"), Jelly Roll and Lainey Wilson (\"Save Me\"), and Carly Pearce and Chris Stapleton (\"We Don't Fight Anymore\"). That's just how popular artist features have become in country music.\n\nBut those are far from the only artist collaborations that made an impression. Jelly Roll also joined Dustin Lynch on \"Chevrolet,\" while Miranda Lambert and Leon Bridges sang \"If You Were Mine,\" a slow-rolling soul-country single. \"Thank God,\" a duet recorded by Kane Brown and his wife, Katelyn, reached No. 13 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on Country Airplay, only the second time a duet by a married couple reached the top (after Tim McGraw and Faith Hill's \"It's Your Love\" in 1997).\n\nSuper-producer Diplo leaned into his Mississippi and Florida roots on Diplo Presents Thomas Wesley, Chapter 2 — Swamp Savant, his second collaborations album with country and hip-hop artists; \"Heartbroken,\" an acoustic guitar-driven country-pop song featuring Jessie Murph and Polo G, reached the top 20 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart. Murph's own duet with Jelly Roll, \"Wild Ones,\" made its mark on the same chart while notching No. 1 on the iTunes Top 200 Songs chart.\"\n\nCountry music awards shows celebrated the art of the collaboration with viral crossover moments this year as well. Buzzing female country stars Ingrid Andress, Morgan Wade, Lainey Wilson and Madeline Edwards joined Alanis Morissette to perform her '90s alt-rock hit \"You Oughta Know\" at the CMT Awards; Ed Sheeran and Luke Combs dueted on \"Life Goes On\" at the ACMs; and Morgan Wallen, HARDY and Post Malone paid tribute to Joe Diffie at the CMAs by taking on his 1993 hit \"John Deere Green.\"\n\nWill country music continue to surge in 2024? If the chart stats, stadium tours and star-studded collaborations are any indication, it's certainly not slowing down.\n\n5 Female Artists Creating The Future Of Country Music: Jaime Wyatt, Miko Marks & More"
