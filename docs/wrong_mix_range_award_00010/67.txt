Biography

Abstract

J. J. Thomson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906 "in recognition of the great merits of his theoretical and experimental investigations on the conduction of electricity by gases." He was affiliated with University of Cambridge his entire career, first getting his education there and later holding positions such as Lecturer, Master of Trinity College, and Cavendish Professor of Experimental Physics. He is credited with discovering the electron, but his work covered a wide variety of areas like electricity and gases, magnetism, light, and properties of matter.
