        "text": "What is Cathode Ray Tube?\n\nA cathode-ray tube (CRT) is a vacuum tube in which an electron beam, deflected by applied electric or magnetic fields, produces a trace on a fluorescent screen.\n\nThe function of the cathode ray tube is to convert an electrical signal into a visual display. Cathode rays or streams of electron particles are quite easy to produce, electrons orbit every atom and move from atom to atom as an electric current.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCathode Ray Tube\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nJ.J.Thomson Experiment\n\nCathode Ray Tube\n\nApparatus Setup\n\nProcedure of the Experiment\n\nConclusion\n\nUses\n\nFrequently Asked Questions – FAQs\n\nIn a cathode ray tube, electrons are accelerated from one end of the tube to the other using an electric field. When the electrons hit the far end of the tube they give up all the energy they carry due to their speed and this is changed to other forms such as heat. A small amount of energy is transformed into X-rays.\n\nCathode Ray Tube\n\nThe cathode ray tube (CRT), invented in 1897 by the German physicist Karl Ferdinand Braun, is an evacuated glass envelope containing an electron gun a source of electrons and a fluorescent light, usually with internal or external means to accelerate and redirect the electrons. Light is produced when electrons hit a fluorescent tube.\n\nThe electron beam is deflected and modulated in a manner that allows an image to appear on the projector. The picture may reflect electrical wave forms (oscilloscope), photographs (television, computer monitor), echoes of radar-detected aircraft, and so on. The single electron beam can be processed to show movable images in natural colours.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nJ. J. Thomson Experiment – The Discovery of Electron\n\nThe Cathode ray experiment was a result of English physicists named J. J. Thomson experimenting with cathode ray tubes. During his experiment he discovered electrons and it is one of the most important discoveries in the history of physics. He was even awarded a Nobel Prize in physics for this discovery and his work on the conduction of electricity in gases.\n\nHowever, talking about the experiment, J. J. Thomson took a tube made of glass containing two pieces of metal as an electrode. The air inside the chamber was subjected to high voltage and electricity flowing through the air from the negative electrode to the positive electrode.\n\nCathode Ray Tube\n\nJ. J. Thomson designed a glass tube that was partly evacuated, i.e. all the air had been drained out of the building. He then applied a high electric voltage at either end of the tube between two electrodes. He observed a particle stream (ray) coming out of the negatively charged electrode (cathode) to the positively charged electrode (anode). This ray is called a cathode ray and is called a cathode ray tube for the entire construction.\n\nThe experiment Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) conducted by J. J. Thomson, is one of the most well-known physical experiments that led to electron discovery. In addition, the experiment could describe characteristic properties, in essence, its affinity to positive charge, and its charge to mass ratio. This paper describes how J is simulated. J. Thomson experimented with Cathode Ray Tube.\n\nThe major contribution of this work is the new approach to modelling this experiment, using the equations of physical laws to describe the electrons’ motion with a great deal of accuracy and precision. The user can manipulate and record the movement of the electrons by assigning various values to the experimental parameters.\n\nApparatus Setup\n\nThe apparatus of the experiment incorporated a tube made of glass containing two pieces of metals at the opposite ends which acted as an electrode. The two metal pieces were connected with an external voltage. The pressure of the gas inside the tube was lowered by evacuating the air.\n\nProcedure of the Experiment\n\nApparatus is set up by providing a high voltage source and evacuating the air to maintain the low pressure inside the tube.\n\nHigh voltage is passed to the two metal pieces to ionize the air and make it a conductor of electricity.\n\nThe electricity starts flowing as the circuit was complete.\n\nTo identify the constituents of the ray produced by applying a high voltage to the tube, the dipole was set up as an add-on in the experiment.\n\nThe positive pole and negative pole were kept on either side of the discharge ray.\n\nWhen the dipoles were applied, the ray was repelled by the negative pole and it was deflected towards the positive pole.\n\nThis was further confirmed by placing the phosphorescent substance at the end of the discharge ray. It glows when hit by a discharge ray. By carefully observing the places where fluorescence was observed, it was noted that the deflections were on the positive side. So the constituents of the discharge tube were negatively charged.\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter completing the experiment J.J. Thomson concluded that rays were and are basically negatively charged particles present or moving around in a set of a positive charge. This theory further helped physicists in understanding the structure of an atom. And the significant observation that he made was that the characteristics of cathode rays or electrons did not depend on the material of electrodes or the nature of the gas present in the cathode ray tube. All in all, from all this we learn that the electrons are in fact the basic constituent of all the atoms.\n\nMost of the mass of the atom and all of its positive charge are contained in a small nucleus, called a nucleus. The particle which is positively charged is called a proton. The greater part of an atom’s volume is empty space.\n\nThe number of electrons that are dispersed outside the nucleus is the same as the number of positively charged protons in the nucleus. This explains the electrical neutrality of an atom as a whole.\n\nUses of Cathode Ray Tube\n\nUsed as a most popular television (TV) display.\n\nX-rays are produced when fast-moving cathode rays are stopped suddenly.\n\nThe screen of a cathode ray oscilloscope, and the monitor of a computer, are coated with fluorescent substances. When the cathode rays fall off the screen pictures are visible on the screen.\n\nFor more information about cathode ray experiment, the discovery of electron or other sub-atomic particles, you can download BYJU’S – The learning app. You can also keep visiting the website or subscribe to our YouTube channel for more content."
