This event will feature twelve problem statements on Geo-Spatial Applications from esteemed ISRO centres: NRSC, PRL, NESAC, SPL, and SAC. Teams of 3-4 Indian students from undergraduate, postgraduate, and PhD programs are invited to participate. The Bhartiya Antariksh hackathon involves a rigorous two-level screening process. Initially, 100 teams will be shortlisted based on their ideation and relevance to the problem statements. From these, an expert committee will select 30 teams for the grand finale. The grand finale, a 30-hour marathon event, will be held at the NRSC Outreach Facility in Jeedimetla, Hyderabad, starting at 10:00 hrs IST on August 13, 2024. The hackathon event is managed through a dedicated web portal. Proposals can be submitted through the portal until July 26, 2024. The list of teams advancing to the grand finale will be announced on August 2, 2024. ISRO Chairman Dr. S. Somanath will formally launch the Bhartiya Antariksh Hackathon (BAH) ‚Äì 2024 web portal on July 4, 2024, at 10:30 hrs IST. This event will be streamed live on ISRO‚Äôs YouTube channel, and all enthusiasts are welcome to tune in. https://lnkd.in/g2RqHc9k\n\n27th International Conference on Particle Physics and Cosmology (COSMO2024) 21-25 October 2024.
