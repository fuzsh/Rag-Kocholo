        "text": "Alfred Nobel had a vision of a better world. He believed that people are capable of helping to improve society through knowledge, science and humanism. This is why he created a prize that would reward the discoveries that have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind. Since 1901, the Nobel Prize has been awarded in the fields of physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace, while a memorial prize in economic sciences was added in 1968.\n\nThe economic foundations for the Nobel Prize were laid in 1895, when Alfred Nobel signed his last will and left much of his wealth to the establishment of a prize and the subsequent Nobel Foundation, which is tasked with a mission to manage his fortune and has ultimate responsibility for fulfilling the intentions of Nobelâ€™s will. In accordance with the instructions Nobel left through his will, various independent prize-awarding institutions have selected Nobel Prize laureates in each prize category for more than a century.\n\nToday, there are also several outreach organisations and activities that have been developed to inspire generations and disseminate knowledge about the Nobel Prize through events, exhibitions, educational efforts and digital outreach."
