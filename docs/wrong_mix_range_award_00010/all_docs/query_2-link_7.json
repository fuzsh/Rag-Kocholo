        "text": "(1856–1940). The renowned British physicist J.J. Thomson was the discoverer of the electron. His research laid the foundation for developments of great importance in electricity, electronics, chemistry, and other sciences. He won the Nobel Prize for his work on the conduction of electricity through gases.\n\nJoseph John Thomson was born on December 18, 1856, in Cheetham, near Manchester, England. His father was a publisher and bookseller. Young Thomson planned to become an engineer, but while studying at Owens College he developed an intense interest in physics. He took advanced studies at Cambridge University, where he became a lecturer in 1882. Thomson published a treatise on vortex rings in 1883 that showed his early interest in the structure of the atom.\n\nHis work as a teacher and researcher impressed Cambridge authorities so favorably that he was appointed to the important Cavendish professorship of experimental physics when the chair became vacant in 1884. He soon gathered a brilliant group of students who also acted as research assistants. Seven of them later won Nobel Prizes. During this period Thomson was engaged chiefly in electromagnetic experiments.\n\nIn 1893 Thomson published the results of these studies in Notes on Recent Researches in Electricity and Magnetism. He gave a course of lectures at Princeton University in 1896, summarizing his researches on the discharge of electricity through gases.\n\nDuring 1896 Thomson also conducted an investigation of cathode rays. On April 30, 1897, he startled the scientific world by announcing that the particles composing cathode rays were much smaller than atoms. These particles were later called electrons.\n\nIn his later researches Thomson found isotopes of the element neon and developed an electrical method for separating different kinds of atoms and molecules. He received the Nobel Prize in 1906. Among his other honors were a British knighthood, the Order of Merit, the Copley medal of the Royal Society, and honorary degrees from many universities. He was president of the Royal Society from 1915 to 1920. During World War I he served on the Admiralty Board of Invention and Research.\n\nHe married Rose Elizabeth Paget in 1890. They had a son, George, who became a noted physicist, and a daughter. Thomson died at Cambridge on August 30, 1940, and was buried in Westminster Abbey."
