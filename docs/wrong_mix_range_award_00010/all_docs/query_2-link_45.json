        "text": "AKA Joseph John Thomson\n\nBorn: 18-Dec-1856\n\nBirthplace: Cheetham Hill, England\n\nDied: 30-Aug-1940\n\nLocation of death: Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England\n\nCause of death: unspecified\n\nRemains: Buried, Westminster Abbey, London, England\n\nGender: Male\n\nReligion: Anglican/Episcopalian\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Physicist\n\nNationality: England\n\nExecutive summary: Discovered the electron\n\nBeginning in 1895 physicist J. J. Thomson theorized that cathode rays produced in Crookes' tubes must be composed of what he called \"corpuscles\", a single type of negatively charged particle. In 1897, applying his own vacuum technique to the study of these then-mysterious rays, Thomson made a convincing argument for composition based on sub-atomic particles, \"this matter being the substance from which all the chemical elements are built up\".\n\nTo make sense of this theory he proposed a \"plum pudding model\" of the atom, which was debated for several years and disproved by his former student, Ernest Rutherford. Thomson also showed a stream of channel rays could be separated into two or more parts through exposure to electrical and magnetic fields, leading eventually to the invention of the mass spectrograph and discovery of isotopes by another of Thomson's students, Francis W. Aston. Thomson won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906, and his son, physicist George Paget Thomson, won the same honor in 1937.\n\nFather: Joseph James Thomson (bookseller, d. 1872)\n\nMother: Emma Thomson\n\nWife: Rose Elizabeth Paget (lab student, m. 22-Jan-1890, one son, one daughter)\n\nSon: George Paget Thomson (physicist)\n\nDaughter: Joan Paget Thomson\n\nUniversity: Victoria University of Manchester\n\nUniversity: BA Mathematics, Trinity College, Cambridge University (1880)\n\nFellow: Trinity College, Cambridge University (1880-1918)\n\nProfessor: Cavendish Professor of Physics, Cambridge University (1884-1919)\n\nLecturer: Physics, Princeton University (1896, four lectures)\n\nLecturer: Physics, Yale University (1904, six lectures)\n\nAdministrator: Master, Trinity College, Cambridge University (1918-40)\n\nCambridge and St John's Adams Prize 1884\n\nRoyal Medal 1894\n\nHughes Medal 1902\n\nSmithsonian Hodgkins Medal 1902\n\nNobel Prize for Physics 1906\n\nKnighthood 1908\n\nOrder of Merit 1912\n\nCopley Medal 1914\n\nJohn Scott Medal 1923\n\nBenjamin Franklin Medal 1923 (by the Franklin Institute)\n\nMascart Medal of the Societe Francaise des Electriciens 1927\n\nManchester John Dalton Medal 1931\n\nIET Faraday Medal 1938\n\nBritish Association for the Advancement of Science President (1909)\n\nRoyal Institution of Great Britain\n\nRoyal Society 1884\n\nRoyal Society President (1916-20)\n\nScottish Ancestry\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nElements of the Mathematical Theory of Electricity and Magnetism (1895, physics)\n\nProperties of Matter (1895, physics text; with J.
