        "text": "Discovery of the electron\n\nThomson’s most important line of work, interrupted only for lectures at Princeton University in 1896, was that which led him in 1897 to the conclusion that all matter, whatever its source, contains particles of the same kind that are much less massive than the atoms of which they form a part. They are now called electrons, although he originally called them corpuscles. His discovery was the result of an attempt to solve a long-standing controversy regarding the nature of cathode rays, which occur when an electric current is driven through a vessel from which most of the air or other gas has been pumped out. Nearly all German physicists of the time held that these visible rays were produced by occurrence in the ether—a weightless substance then thought to pervade all space—but that they were neither ordinary light nor the recently discovered X-rays. British and French physicists, on the other hand, believed that these rays were electrified particles. By applying an improved vacuum technique, Thomson was able to put forward a convincing argument that these rays were composed of particles. Furthermore, these rays seemed to be composed of the same particles, or corpuscles, regardless of what kind of gas carried the electric discharge or what kinds of metals were used as conductors. Thomson’s conclusion that the corpuscles were present in all kinds of matter was strengthened during the next three years when he found that corpuscles with the same properties could be produced in other ways—e.g., from hot metals. Thomson may be described as “the man who split the atom” for the first time, although “chipped” might be a better word, in view of the size and number of electrons. Although some atoms contain many electrons, the electrons’ total mass is never so much as 1/1,000 that of the atom.\n\nBy the turn of the century, most of the scientific world had fully accepted Thomson’s far-reaching discovery. In 1903 he had the opportunity to amplify his views on the behaviour of subatomic particles in natural phenomena when, in his Silliman Lectures at Yale University, he suggested a discontinuous theory of light; his hypothesis foreshadowed Albert Einstein’s later theory of photons. In 1906 he received the Nobel Prize for Physics for his researches into the electrical conductivity of gases; in 1908 he was knighted; in 1909 he was made president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science; and in 1912 he received the Order of Merit.\n\nThomson was, however, by no means a scientific recluse. During his most fruitful years as a scientist, he was administrative head of the highly successful Cavendish Laboratory. (It was there that he met Rose Elizabeth Paget, whom he married in 1890.) He not only administered the research projects but also financed two additions to the laboratory buildings primarily from students’ fees, with little support from the university and colleges. Except for its share of a small government grant to the Royal Society to aid all British universities and all branches of science, the Cavendish Laboratory received no other government subsidy, nor were there contributions from charitable corporations or industry. A gift from a devoted staff member made possible the purchase of a small liquid-air machine essential for Thomson’s research on positive rays, which greatly increased knowledge of the recently discovered atomic nuclei.\n\nThomson was, moreover, an outstanding teacher; his importance in physics depended almost as much on the work he inspired in others as on that which he did himself. The group of men he gathered around him between 1895 and 1914 came from all over the world, and after working under him many accepted professorships abroad. Seven Nobel Prizes were awarded to those who worked under him. It was while working with Thomson at the Cavendish Laboratory in 1910, for example, that Ernest Rutherford performed the research that led to the modern understanding of the internal structure of the atom. In the process, the Rutherford atomic model supplanted the so-called plum-pudding model of atomic structure proposed by Lord Kelvin; the latter is known as the Thomson atomic model because of the strong support Thomson gave it for a few years.\n\nThomson took his teaching duties very seriously: he lectured regularly to elementary classes in the morning and to postgraduates in the afternoon. He considered teaching to be helpful for a researcher, since it required him to reconsider basic ideas that otherwise might have been taken for granted. He never advised a man entering a new research field to begin by reading the work already done. Rather, Thomson thought it wise that the researcher first clarify his own ideas. Then he could safely read the reports of others without having his own views influenced by assumptions that he might find difficult to throw off."
