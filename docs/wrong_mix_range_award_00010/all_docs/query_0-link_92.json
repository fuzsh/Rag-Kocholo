James Chadwick (1935 Nobel Prize in Physics)\n\nManchester-educated James Chadwick received the 1935 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering the neutron, an uncharged particle in atomic nuclei. Chadwick’s collaboration with Rutherford at Manchester and subsequent work at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge paved the way for advancements in atomic and nuclear physics.\n\n9. Walter Norman Haworth (1937 Nobel Prize in Chemistry)\n\nCarbohydrate chemist Norman Haworth, awarded the 1937 Nobel Prize, created a significant school of research at Birmingham. His work on the chemical structures of sugars and the synthesis of vitamin C, undertaken after his education at Manchester, laid the groundwork for large-scale vitamin production.\n\n10. George de Hevesy (1943 Nobel Prize in Chemistry)\n\nHungarian chemist George de Hevesy received the 1943 Nobel Prize for pioneering the use of radioactive isotopes as tracers in chemical processes. Working with Rutherford at Manchester, de Hevesy realized the potential of isotopes while sipping tea with Niels Bohr, leading to groundbreaking research in radiochemistry.\n\n11. Robert Robinson (1947 Nobel Prize in Chemistry)\n\nChemist Robert Robinson, a former Professor of Organic Chemistry at Manchester, was awarded the 1947 Nobel Prize for his work on the structure of plant products, including alkaloids. Robinson’s analytical methods played a crucial role in identifying components in complex biological molecules.\n\n12. Patrick Maynard Stuart Blackett (1948 Nobel Prize in Physics)\n\nPhysicist Patrick Blackett received the 1948 Nobel Prize for his pioneering work in atomic physics. Using CTR Wilson’s cloud chamber at Manchester, Blackett automated the process to photograph the tracks of atomic nucleus disintegration, contributing to the understanding of positrons and gamma rays.\n\n13. John Douglas Cockcroft (1951 Nobel Prize in Physics)\n\nPhysicist John Cockcroft, a Manchester alum, shared the 1951 Nobel Prize for creating the first proton accelerator at Cambridge. Cockcroft’s groundbreaking research on nuclear transformations laid the foundation for new isotopes, contributing to advancements in atomic physics.\n\n14. Alexander Todd (1957 Nobel Prize in Chemistry)\n\nChemist Alexander Todd, Professor of Organic Chemistry at Manchester, won the 1957 Nobel Prize for his analysis of biologically important molecules. Todd’s work on nucleotides, crucial components of DNA, played a pivotal role in the development of the double helix model by Watson and Crick.\n\n15. Melvin Calvin (1961 Nobel Prize in Chemistry)\n\nChemist Melvin Calvin, a former Manchester researcher, received the 1961 Nobel Prize for studying the pathways of photosynthesis in plants.
