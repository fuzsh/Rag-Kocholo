        "text": "Welcome to the Maryland Distinguished Lectures in Algebra and Number Theory! This is an annual lecture series concerning recent developments in Algebra and Number Theory, delivered by the world's foremost experts. It is organized by Thomas Haines .\n\n2024 Zhiwei Yun\n\nTheme: Higher theta series\n\nAbstract: Theta series play an important role in the classical\n\ntheory of modular forms. In the modern language of automorphic\n\nrepresentations, they are constructed from a pair of groups $G$ and\n\n$H$ (one orthogonal and one symplectic, or both unitary groups) and\n\nthe remarkable Weil representation of $G\\times H$. Kudla introduced\n\nan analogue of theta series in arithmetic geometry, by forming a\n\ngenerating series of algebraic cycles on Shimura varieties. The\n\narithmetic theta series has since become a very active program.\n\nIn joint work with Tony Feng and Wei Zhang, we consider analogues of\n\narithmetic theta series over function fields, and try to go further\n\nthan what was done over number fields. Our work concentrated on\n\nunitary groups. We defined a generating series of algebraic cycles on\n\nthe moduli stack of unitary Drinfeld Shtukas (called the higher theta\n\nseries). We made the Modularity Conjecture: the higher theta series\n\nis an automorphic form valued in a certain Chow group. This is a\n\nfunction field analogue of the special cycles generating series\n\ndefined by Kudla and Rapoport, but with an extra degree of freedom\n\nnamely the number of legs of the Shtukas.\n\nOne concrete formula we proved was a higher derivative version of the\n\nSiegel-Weil formula. It is an equality between degrees of\n\n0-dimensional special cycles on the moduli of unitary Shtukas and\n\nhigher derivatives of the Siegel-Eisenstein series of another unitary\n\ngroup. More recently, we have obtained a proof of a weaker version of\n\nthe Modularity Conjecture, confirming that the cycle class of the\n\nhigher theta series (valued in the cohomology of the generic fiber) is\n\nautomorphic.\n\nThe series of talks will feature a colloquium-style introduction to\n\nsome representation-theoretic and geometric background (the second talk), the other\n\ntwo being more technical talks in which I will explain some ingredients in\n\nthe proofs of the higher Siegel-Weil formula and the weak Modularity\n\nConjecture.\n\nHigher Theta series, Part I\n\nTuesday, February 27 at 3:30 pm\n\nUniversity of Maryland - Kirwan Hall Rm 3206\n\nHigher Theta series, Part II (Colloquium)\n\nWednesday, February 28 at 3:15 pm\n\nUniversity of Maryland - Kirwan Hall Rm 3206\n\nHigher Theta series, Part III\n\nThursday, February 29 at 3:30 pm\n\nUniversity of Maryland - Kirwan Hall Rm 3206\n\n2022 Mark Kisin\n\nTheme: Arithmetic of abelian varieties and their moduli\n\nEssential dimension and prismatic cohomology (Colloquium)\n\nWednesday, December 7 at 3:15pm\n\nUniversity of Maryland - Kirwan Hall Rm 3206\n\nAbstract: The smallest number of parameters needed to define an algebraic covering space is called its essential dimension. Questions about this invariant go back to Klein, Kronecker and Hilbert and are related to Hilbert's 13th problem. In this talk, I will give a little history, and then explain a new approach which relies on recent developments in $p$-adic Hodge theory. This is joint work with Benson Farb and Jesse Wolfson.\n\nFrobenius conjugacy classes attached to abelian varieties\n\nThursday, December 8 at 2:00pm\n\nUniversity of Maryland - Kirwan Hall Rm 3206\n\nAbstract: The Mumford-Tate group of an abelian variety $A$ over the complex numbers is an algebraic group $G$, defined in terms of the complex geometry of $A$, more specifically its Hodge structure. If $A$ is defined over a number field $K$, then a remarkable result of Deligne asserts that the ℓ -adic cohomology of $A$ gives rise to a $G$ -valued Galois representation ρℓ:Gal($\\bar K/K$)→$G(\\mathbb Q_\\ell)$. We will show that for a place of good reduction v∤ℓ of A, the conjugacy class of Frobenius ρℓ(Frobv) does not depend on ℓ. This is joint work with Rong Zhou.\n\nHeights in the isogeny class of an abelian variety\n\nFriday, December 9 at 2:00pm\n\nUniversity of Maryland - Kirwan Hall Rm 3206\n\nAbstract: Let $A$ be an abelian variety over $\\bar{\\mathbb Q}.$ In this talk I will consider the following conjecture of Mocz. Conjecture: Let $c > 0.$ In the isogeny class of $A,$ there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of abelian varieties of height $ c.$ I will sketch a proof of the conjecture when the Mumford-Tate conjecture - which is known in many cases - holds for $A.$ This result should be compared with Faltings' famous theorem, which is about finiteness for abelian varieties defined over a fixed number field. This is joint work with Lucia Mocz.\n\n2021 Wei Zhang\n\nDecember 1, 2021 - Cycles on products of elliptic curves and a conjecture of Bloch-Kato\n\nWednesday, December 1 at 3:15pm\n\nUniversity of Maryland - Kirwan Hall Rm 3206\n\nAbstract: One classical way to study rational or integral solutions of a polynomial equation is to look at the simpler questions of the various congruence equations modulo n for all integer n. The conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer predicts that, for elliptic curves (defined by equations of the form y^2=x^3+ax+b with integer coefficients), the data from these congruence equations mod n should actually encode much information on the solutions in rational numbers. In the first talk we will discuss a generalization of the question to the product of several elliptic curves, where, instead of rational points, we look for algebraic cycles (i.e., parameter solutions) modulo suitable equivalence relations (rational equivalence, Abel—Jacobi or its p-adic version). In particular, I'll report some recent results on a conjecture of Bloch-Kato.\n\nDecember 2, 2021 - Periods of automorphic forms and L-values\n\nThursday, December 2 at 11:00am\n\nUniversity of Maryland - Kirwan Hall Rm 3206\n\nAbstract: In the second and the third talk I will report some of the ingredients in the proof of the results presented in the first talk. For a reductive group G over a number field and H a suitable subgroup, a fundamental question is to study the period integral of an automorphic form on G along the subgroup H. I’ll give examples with an emphasis on the cases that are related to special values of L-functions.\n\nDecember 3, 2021 - Heights of special cycles on Shimura varieties and L-derivatives\n\nFriday, December 3 at 2:00pm\n\nUniversity of Maryland - Kirwan Hall Rm 3206\n\nAbstract: In the last talk, I will move to an arithmetic analog of period integrals from the second talk. Here we consider Shimura varieties defined by a group G and special algebraic cycles defined by a subgroup H of G. The height pairing of such special cycles is often related to the special value of the first derivative of L-function; the first of such instance was proved by Gross and Zagier in 1980s. We report the progress on the arithmetic Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture, one of the generalizations of Gross—Zagier theorem to high dimensional varieties.\n\n2019 Ngô Bảo Châu\n\nDecember 4, 2019 - On The Hitchin Fibration\n\nOn The Hitchin Fibration\n\nWednesday, December 4 at 3:15pm\n\nChicago\n\nAbstract: Simpson's non-Abelian Hodge theory stipulates a diffeomorphism between the moduli space of flat connections on a smooth projective variety and the moduli space of semi-stable Higgs bundles with trivial Chern classes. The main feature of the moduli space of Higgs bundles is the Hitchin map calculating the characteristic polynomial of the Higgs field. Over a curve, the structure of the Hitchin map is fairly well understood as an abelian fibration with degeneration. When the base field is a finite field, counting points on the Hitchin fibration allows us to connect the geometry of the Hitchin fibration with orbital integrals and the trace formula. This interplay between geometry and harmonic analysis has been very fruitful for understanding both sides of the story, and in particular, it gave rise to a proof for the fundamental lemma. I will give an account of this interplay in my first lecture.\n\nDecember 5, 2019 - On The Hitchin Fibration II\n\nOn The Hitchin Fibration II\n\nThursday, December 5 at 2:00 pm\n\nChicago\n\nAbstract: In the second lecture, I want to discuss the theory of non-archimedean integration on the Hitchin fibration due to Groechenig, Wyss and Ziegler. Surprisingly, calculating nonarchimedean integrals is not exactly the same as counting points and this approach gives another proof of the fundamental lemma, and this discrepancy sheds yet new lights on the theory of endoscopy. The proof is also more elementary in the sense that it does not use the theory of perverse sheaves.\n\nDecember 6, 2019 - On The Hitchin Fibration III\n\nOn The Hitchin Fibration III\n\nFriday, December 6 at 2:00 pm\n\nChicago\n\nAbstract: In my third lecture, I want to report on a completely different development on the moduli space of Higgs bundles. In joint work with T.H. Chen we started exploring the structure of the Hitchin map for the moduli space of Higgs bundles over higher-dimensional varieties, which raises interesting questions on the geometry of commuting varieties.\n\nLectures on Differential Equations and their Numerical Analysis\n\nThe Aziz Lectures were established by a generous gift from Prof. A. Kadir Aziz. The purpose of the lectures is to bring distinguished mathematicians to the University of Maryland, College Park, to give survey lectures on differential equations, their numerical analysis, and related areas.\n\nKadir Aziz, who died on March 25, 2016 at the age of 92, received his Ph.D. from the University of Maryland, College Park in 1957. He was on the faculty of Georgetown University from 1956 to 1967, and was on the faculty at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) since 1967. He was Professor Emeritus of Mathematics and Statistics at UMBC. Throughout his career Kadir Aziz was an active and highly respected member of the Numerical Analysis community at Maryland.\n\nCV of Kadir Aziz\n\nThe Aziz lecture is given at 3:15pm in the Math Colloquium Room (MTH 3206).\n\nUsually the speaker gives a related talk in the Applied Math Colloquium on the previous day at 3:30pm.\n\nAziz Lectures 2024\n\nBoth the Applied Math Colloquium (September 3 at 3:30pm) and the Aziz Lecture (September 4 at 3:15pm) will be broadcast via Zoom\n\nZoom Link: https://umd.zoom.us/j/97661035379?pwd=eW4xR2xFL3paQ3VCTXd6bjNXNlJNUT09\n\nSeptember 4, 2024\n\nMultilevel approximation of Gaussian random fields\n\nChristoph Schwab\n\nETH, Zurich\n\nSwitzerland\n\nCentered Gaussian random fields (GRFs) indexed by compacta as e.g. compact orientable manifolds M are determined by their covariance operators. We consider the numerical analysis of sample-wise, compressive multi-level wavelet-Galerkin approximations of centered GRFs given as variational solutions to coloring operator equations driven by spatial white noise, with pseudodifferential covariance operator being elliptic, self-adjoint and positive from the Hörmander class. For pathwise approximations with p parameters, tapered covariance or precision matrices have O(p) nonzero entries, can be optimally diagonally preconditioned, and allow O(p) path simulation, covariance estimation and kriging of GRFs.\n\nJoint work with Helmut Harbrecht (Uni Basel), Kristin Kirchner (TU Delft), and Lukas Herrmann (RICAM, Linz).\n\nAziz Lectures 2023\n\nApril 12, 2023 - 3:15pm\n\nSome Mathematical Aspects of Deep Learning and Stochastic Gradient Descent\n\nLexing Ying\n\nStanford University\n\nThis talk concerns several mathematical aspects of deep learning and stochastic gradient descent. The first aspect is why deep neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent often generalize. We will make a connection between the generalization and the stochastic stability of the stochastic gradient descent dynamics. The second aspect is to understand the training process of stochastic gradient descent. Here, we use several simple mathematical examples to explain several key empirical observations, including the edge of stability, exploration of flat minimum, and learning rate decay. Based on joint work with Chao Ma.\n\nAziz Lectures 2019\n\nMay 1, 2019\n\nOperator Preconditioning\n\nRalf Hiptmair\n\nETH Zurich\n\nSwitzerland\n\nThis text is printed on a background of locally refined finite element meshes. For the fast iterative solution of finite element models on such meshes preconditioning is indispensable. This is where operator preconditioning enters stage: it offers a general all-purpose recipe for constructing preconditioners for discrete linear operators that have arisen from a Galerkin approach, in particular, from finite element methods and boundary element methods. The key idea is to employ matching Galerkin discretizations of operators of complementary mapping properties. If these can be found, the resulting preconditioners will be robust with respect to the choice of the bases for trial and test spaces. As a consequence, in a finite element setting, they will still perform well even for high-resolution models.\n\nAziz Lectures 2018\n\nSeptember 12, 2018\n\nSmooth random functions and smooth random ODEs\n\nLloyd N. Trefethen\n\nOxford University\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nWhat is a random function? What is noise? The standard answers are nonsmooth, defined pointwise via the Wiener process and Brownian motion. In the Chebfun project, we have found it more natural to work with smooth random functions defined by finite Fourier series with random coefficients. The length of the series is determined by a wavelength parameter lambda. Integrals give smooth random walks, which approach Brownian paths as lambda shrinks to 0, and smooth random ODEs, which approach stochastic DEs of the Stratonovich variety. Numerical explorations become very easy in this framework. There are plenty of conceptual challenges in this subject, starting with the fact that white noise has infinite amplitude and infinite energy, a paradox that goes back in two different ways to Einstein in 1905.\n\nMay 4, 2018\n\nStochastic Nonlinear Schrödinger Equations\n\nArnaud Debussche\n\nÉcole Normale Supérieure de Rennes\n\nThe nonlinear Schrödinger equation is a prototype model to describe propagation of waves in dispersive media. It arises in several models and noise appears naturally. It may represent the noise due to amplifiers or random dispersion in the fiber. In this talk I will present some aspects of wellposedness and influence on blow-up phenomena for the stochastic nonlinear Schrödinger equation.\n\nFebruary 7, 2018\n\nMathematical theory and computational approaches for modern materials science\n\nClaude Le Bris\n\nEcole des Ponts and Inria\n\nThe talk, intended for a general audience, will survey some challenging mathematical and numerical problems in contemporary materials science. Questions such as the passage from the microscale to the macroscale, the insertion of uncertainties, defects and heterogeneities in the models, will be examined. We will discuss the interesting issues raised for mathematical analysis (theory of partial differential equations, stochastic processes, homogenization theory) and for numerical analysis (finite element methods, discrete to continuum, Monte Carlo methods, etc).\n\nAziz Lectures 2016\n\nDecember 9, 2016\n\nModeling traffic flow on a network of roads\n\nProf. Alberto Bressan\n\nDepartment of Mathematics\n\nPenn State University\n\nThe talk will present various PDE models of traffic flow on a network of roads. These comprise a set of conservation laws, determining the density of traffic on each road, together with suitable boundary conditions, describing the dynamics at intersections. While conservation laws determine the evolution of traffic from given initial data, actual traffic patterns are best studied from the point of view of optimal decision problems, where each driver chooses the departure time and the route taken to reach destination. Given a cost functional depending on the departure and arrival times, a relevant mathematical problem is to determine (i) global optima, minimizing the sum of all costs to all drivers, and (ii) Nash equilibria, where no driver can lower his own cost by changing departure time or route to destination. Several results and open problems will be discussed.\n\nMay 4, 2016\n\nQuantum Dots and Dislocations: Dynamics of Materials\n\nProf. Irene Fonseca\n\nDepartment of Mathematical Sciences\n\nCarnegie Mellon University\n\nThe formation and assembly patterns of quantum dots have a significant impact on the optoelectronic properties of semiconductors. We will address short time existence for a surface diffusion evolution equation with curvature regularization in the context of epitaxially strained three-dimensional films. Further, the nucleation of misfit dislocations will be analyzed.\n\nThis is joint work with Nicola Fusco, Giovanni Leoni and Massimiliano Morini.\n\nAziz Lectures 2015\n\nNovember 18, 2015\n\nTensor Sparsity - a Regularity Notion for High Dimensional PDEs\n\nProf. Wolfgang Dahmen\n\nInstitute für Geometrie und Praktische Mathematik\n\nRWTH Aachen University (Germany)\n\nThe numerical solution of PDEs in a spatially high-dimensional regime (such as the electronic Schrödinger or Fokker-Planck equations) is severely hampered by the “curse of dimensionality”: the computational cost required for achieving a desired target accuracy increases exponentially with respect to the spatial dimension.\n\nWe explore a possible remedy by exploiting a typically hidden sparsity of the solution to such problems with respect to a problem dependent basis or dictionary. Here sparsity means that relatively few terms from such a dictionary suffice to realize a given target accuracy. Specifically, sparsity with respect to dictionaries comprised of separable functions – rank-one tensors – would significantly mitigate the curse of dimensionality. The main result establishes such tensor-sparsity for elliptic problems over product domains when the data are tensor-sparse, which can be viewed as a structural regularity theorem.\n\nApril 15, 2015\n\nWaves in random media: the story of the phase\n\nProf. Lenya Ryzhik\n\nDepartment of Mathematics Stanford University\n\nThe macroscopic description of wave propagation in random media typically focuses on the scattering of the wave intensity, while the phase is discarded as a uselessly random object. At the same time, most of the beauty in wave scattering come from the phase correlations. I will describe some of the miracles, as well as some limit theorems for the wave phase.\n\nMay 6, 2015\n\nMathematical challenges in kinetic models of dilute polymers: analysis, approximation and computation\n\nProf Endre Süli\n\nMathematical Institute University of Oxford\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nWe survey recent analytical and computational results for coupled macroscopic-microscopic bead-spring chain models that arise from the kinetic theory of dilute solutions of polymeric fluids with noninteracting polymer chains, involving the unsteady Navier–Stokes system in a bounded domain and a high-dimensional Fokker–Planck equation. The Fokker–Planck equation emerges from a system of (Ito) stochastic differential equations, which models the evolution of a vectorial stochastic process comprised by the centre-of-mass position vector and the orientation (or configuration) vectors of the polymer chain. We discuss the existence of large-data global-in-time weak solutions to the coupled Navier–Stokes–Fokker–Planck system. The Fokker–Planck equation involved in the model is a high-dimensional partial differential equation, whose numerical approximation is a formidable computational challenge, complicated by the fact that for practically relevant spring potentials, such as finitely extensible nonlinear elastic potentials, the drift coefficient in the Fokker–Planck equation is unbounded.\n\nAziz Lectures 2014\n\nNovember 12, 2014\n\nThe interplay between geometric modeling and simulation of partial differential equations\n\nProf. Annalisa Buffa\n\nIstituto di Matematica Applicata e Tecnologie Informatiche \"E. Magenes\"\n\nPavia, Italy\n\nComputer-based simulation of partial differential equations involves approximation of the unknown fields and a description of geometrical entities such as the computational domain and the properties of the media. There are a variety of situations: in some cases this description is very complex, in some other the governing equations are very difficult to discretize. Starting with an historical perspective, I will describe the recent efforts to improve the interplay between the mathematical approaches characterizing these two aspects of the problem.\n\nAziz Lectures 2013\n\nNovember 8, 2013\n\nUniversality and chaos in clustering and branching processes\n\nProf. Robert Pego\n\nCarnegie-Mellon University\n\nScaling limits of Smoluchowski's coagulation equation are related to probability theory in numerous remarkable ways. E.g., such an equation governs the merging of ancestral trees in critical branching processes, as observed by Bertoin and Le Gall. A simple explanation of this relies on how Bernstein functions relate to a weak topology for Levy triples. From the same theory, we find the existence of 'universal' branching mechanisms which generate complicated dynamics that contain arbitrary renormalized limits. I also plan to describe a remarkable application of Bernstein function theory to a coagulation-fragmentation model introduced in fisheries science to explain animal group size.\n\nApril 2-3, 2013\n\nMaximum Norm Stability and Error Estimates for Stokes and Navier-Stokes Problems\n\nProf. Vivette Girault\n\nUniversité Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France\n\nEnergy norm stability estimates for the finite element discretization of the Stokes problem follow easily from the variational formulation provided the discrete pressure and velocity satisfy a uniform inf-sup condition. But deriving uniform stability estimates in L∞ is much more complex because variational formulations do not lend themselves to maximum norms. I shall present here the main ideas of a proof that relies on weighted L2 estimates for regularized Green's functions associated with the Stokes problem and on a weighted inf-sup condition. The domain is a convex polygon or polyhedron. The triangulation is shape-regular and quasi-uniform. The finite element spaces satisfy a super-approximation property, which is shown to be valid for most commonly used stable finite-element spaces. Extending this result to error estimates and to the solution of the steady incompressible Navier-Stokes problem is straightforward.\n\nAziz Lectures 2012\n\nFebruary 22, 2012\n\nSemismooth Newton Methods: Theory, Numerics and Applications\n\nProf. Michael Hintermüller\n\nDepartment of Mathematics\n\nHumboldt-Universität, Berlin, Germany\n\nMany mathematical models of processes or problems in engineering sciences, mathematical imaging, biomedical sciences or mathematical finance rely on non-smooth structures, either directly through non-differentiable associated energy models, due to (quasi)variational inequality formulations or the presence of inequality constraints in pertinent energy minimization tasks. Based on non-smooth operator equation based (re)formulations of the above problem classes, in this talk a generalized Newton framework in function space is discussed. For this purpose the concept of semismoothness in function space is addressed. Relying on the latter concept, locally superlinear convergence of the associated semismooth Newton iteration is established and its mesh independent convergence behavior upon discretization is shown. In a second part of the talk, the efficiency and wide applicability of the above semismooth Newton framework is highlighted by considering constrained optimal control problems for fluid flow, contact problems with or without adhesion forces, phase separation phenomena relying on non-smooth homogeneous free energy densities and restoration tasks in mathematical image processing.\n\nAziz Lectures 2011\n\nDecember 2, 2011\n\nOptimal and Practical Algebraic Solvers for Discretized PDEs\n\nProf. Jinchao Xu\n\nCenter for Computational Mathematics and Applications\n\nPenn State University\n\nAn overview of fast solution techniques (such as multi-grid, two-grid, one-grid and nil-grid methods) will be given in this talk on solving large scale systems of equations that arise from the discretization of partial differential equations (such as Poisson, elasticity, Stokes, Navier-Stokes, Maxwell, MHD, and black-oil models). Mathematical optimality, practical applicability and parallel (CPU/GPU) scalability will be addressed for these algorithms and applications.\n\nFebruary 11, 2011\n\nComplex Fluids\n\nProf. Peter Constantin\n\nDepartment of Mathematics\n\nUniversity of Chicago\n\nThe talk will be about some of the models used to describe fluids with particulate matter suspended in them. Some of these models are very complicated. After a bit of history and a review of known results, I will try to point out some open problems, isolate some of the mathematical difficulties, and illustrate some of the phenomena on simpler didactic models.\n\nAziz Lectures 2010\n\nNovember 12, 2010\n\nDiscontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Methods for High Order Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations\n\nProf. Chi-Wang Shu\n\nBrown University\n\nDiscontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element methods were first designed to solve hyperbolic conservation laws utilizing successful high resolution finite difference and finite volume schemes such as approximate Riemann solvers and nonlinear limiters. More recently the DG methods have been generalized to solve convection dominated convection-diffusion equations (e.g. high Reynolds number Navier-Stokes equations), convection-dispersion (e.g. KdV equations) and other high order nonlinear wave equations or diffusion equations. In this talk we will first give an introduction to the DG method, emphasizing several key ingredients which made the method popular, and then we will move on to introduce a class of DG methods for solving high order PDEs, termed local DG (LDG) methods. We will highlight the important ingredient of the design of LDG schemes, namely the adequate choice of numerical fluxes, and emphasize the stability of the fully nonlinear DG approximations. Numerical examples will be shown to demonstrate the performance of the DG methods.\n\nMarch 5, 2010\n\nA Taste of Compressed Sensing\n\nProf. Ronald DeVore\n\nTexas A&M University\n\nCompressed Sensing is a new paradigm in signal and image processing. It seeks to faithfully capture a signal/image with the fewest number of measurements. Rather than model a signal as a bandlimited function or an image as a pixel array, it models both of these as a sparse vector in some representation system. This model fits well real world signals and images. For example, images are well approximated by a sparse wavelet decomposition. Given this model, how should we design a sensor to capture the signal with the fewest number of measurements. We shall introduce ways of measuring the effectiveness of compressed sensing algorithms and then show which of these are optimal.\n\nAziz Lectures 2009\n\nOctober 12, 2009\n\nIsogeometric Analysis\n\nProf. Thomas J. R. Hughes\n\nInstitute for Computational Engineering and Sciences\n\nUniversity of Texas at Austin\n\nGeometry is the foundation of analysis yet modern methods of computational geometry have until recently had very little impact on computational mechanics. The reason may be that the Finite Element Analysis (FEA), as we know it today, was developed in the 1950's and 1960's, before the advent and widespread use of Computer Aided Design (CAD) programs, which occurred in the 1970's and 1980's. Many difficulties encountered with FEA emanate from its approximate, polynomial based geometry, such as, for example, mesh generation, mesh refinement, sliding contact, flows about aerodynamic shapes, buckling of thin shells, etc., and it s disconnect with CAD. It would seem that it is time to look at more powerful descriptions of geometry to provide a new basis for computational mechanics.\n\nThe purpose of this talk is to describe the new generation of computational mechanics procedures based on modern developments in computational geometry. The emphasis will be on Isogeometric Analysis in which basis functions generated from NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) and T-Splines are employed to construct an exact geometric model. For purposes of analysis, the basis is refined and/or its order elevated without changing the geometry or its parameterization. Analogues of finite element h- and p-refinement schemes are presented and a new, more efficient, higher-order concept, k-refinement, is described. Refinements are easily implemented and exact geometry is maintained at all levels without the necessity of subsequent communication with a CAD description.\n\nIn the context of structural mechanics, it is established that the basis functions are complete with respect to affine transformations, meaning that all rigid body motions and constant strain states are exactly represented. Standard patch tests are likewise satisfied. Numerical examples exhibit optimal rates of convergence for linear elasticity problems and convergence to thin elastic shell solutions. Extraordinary accuracy is noted for k-refinement in structural vibrations and wave propagation calculations. Surprising robustness is also noted in fluid and non-linear solid mechanics problems. It is argued that Isogeometric Analysis is a viable alternative to standard, polynomial-based, finite element analysis and possesses many advantages. In particular, k-refinement seems to offer a unique combination of attributes, that is, robustness and accuracy, not possessed by classical p-methods, and is applicable to models requiring smoother basis functions, such as, thin bending elements, and strain-gradient and various phase-field theories.\n\nA modelling paradigm for patient-specific simulation of cardiovascular fluid-structure interaction is reviewed, and a précis of the status of current mathematical understanding is presented.\n\nMay 1, 2009\n\nThe Fast Multipole Method and its Applications\n\nLeslie Greengard\n\nCourant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University\n\nIn this lecture, we will describe the analytic and computational foundations of fast multipole methods (FMMs), as well as some of their applications. They are most easily understood, perhaps, in the case of particle simulations, where they reduce the cost of computing all pairwise interactions in a system of N particles from O(N2) to O(N) or O(N log N) operations. FMMs are equally useful, however, in solving partial differential equations by first recasting them as integral equations. We will present examples from electromagnetics, elasticity, and fluid mechanics.\n\nAziz Lectures 2008\n\nNovember 14, 2008\n\nTopology optimization of structures\n\nProf. Gregoire Allaire\n\nEcole Polytechnique\n\nThe typical problem of structural optimization is to find the \"best\" structure which is, at the same time, of minimal weight and of maximum strength or which performs a desired deformation. In this context I will present the combination of the classical shape derivative and of the level-set methods for front propagation. This approach has been implemented in two and three space dimensions for models of linear or non-linear elasticity and for various objective functions and constraints on the perimeter. It has also been coupled with the bubble or topological gradient method which is designed for introducing new holes in the optimization process. Since the level set method is known to easily handle boundary propagation with topological changes, the resulting numerical algorithm is very efficient for topology optimization. It can escape from local minima in a given topological class of shapes and the resulting optimal design is largely independent of the initial guess.\n\nMarch 28, 2008\n\nNew materials from mathematics: real and imagined\n\nProf. Richard D. James\n\nUniversity of Minnesota\n\nIn this talk I will give two examples where mathematics played an important role for the discovery of new materials, and a third example where mathematics suggests a systematic way of searching for broad classes of yet undiscovered materials.\n\nAziz Lectures 2007\n\nNov. 16, 2007\n\nAdaptive Approximation by Greedy Algorithms\n\nProf. Albert Cohen\n\nLaboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions, Université Pierre et Marie Curie,\n\nParis, France\n\nThis talk will discuss computational algorithms that deal with the following general task: given a function f and a dictionary of functions D in a Hilbert space, extract a linear combination of N functions of D which approximates f at best. We shall review the convergence properties of existing algorithms. This work is motivated by applications as various as data compression, adaptive numerical simulation of PDE's, statistical learning theory.\n\nMay 4, 2007\n\nCompressive Sampling\n\nProf. Emmanuel J. Candes\n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology\n\nOne of the central tenets of signal processing is the Shannon/Nyquist sampling theory: the number of samples needed to reconstruct a signal without error is dictated by its bandwidth-the length of the shortest interval which contains the support of the spectrum of the signal under study. Very recently, an alternative sampling or sensing theory has emerged which goes against this conventional wisdom. This theory allows the faithful recovery of signals and images from what appear to be highly incomplete sets of data, i.e. from far fewer data bits than traditional methods use. Underlying this metholdology is a concrete protocol for sensing and compressing data simultaneously.\n\nThis talk will present the key mathematical ideas underlying this new sampling or sensing theory, and will survey some of the most important results. We will argue that this is a robust mathematical theory; not only is it possible to recover signals accurately from just an incomplete set of measurements, but it is also possible to do so when the measurements are unreliable and corrupted by noise. We will see that the reconstruction algorithms are very concrete, stable (in the sense that they degrade smoothly as the noise level increases) and practical; in fact, they only involve solving very simple convex optimization programs.\n\nAn interesting aspect of this theory is that it has bearings on some fields in the applied sciences and engineering such as statistics, information theory, coding theory, theoretical computer science, and others as well. If time allows, we will try to explain these connections via a few selected examples.\n\nAziz Lectures 2006\n\nDecember 1, 2006\n\nImaging in random media\n\nProf. George C. Papanicolaou\n\nMathematics Department\n\nStanford University\n\nI will present an overview of some recently developed methods for imaging with array and distributed sensors when the environment between the objects to be imaged and the sensors is complex and only partially known to the imager. This brings in modeling and analysis in random media, and the need for statistical algorithms that increase the computational complexity of imaging, which is done by backpropagating local correlations rather than traces (interferometry). I will illustrate the theory with applications from non-destructive testing and from other areas.\n\nApril 21, 2006\n\nString integration of some MHD equations\n\nProf. Yann Brenier\n\nLaboratoire Alexandre Dieudonné\n\nUniversité de Nice-Sophia-Antipolis, France\n\nWe first review the link between strings and some Magnetohydrodynamics equations. Typical examples are the Born-Infeld system, the Chaplygin gas equations and the shallow water MHD model. They arise in Physics at very different (from subatomic to cosmologic) scales. These models can be exactly integrated in one space dimension by solving the 1D wave equation and using the d'Alembert formula. We show how an elementary \"string integrator\" can be used to solve these MHD equations through dimensional splitting. A good control of the energy conservation is needed due to the repeated use of Lagrangian to Eulerian grid projections. Numerical simulations in 1 and 2 dimensions will be shown.\n\nFebruary 3, 2006\n\nMultiscale Analysis in Micromagnetics\n\nProf. Felix Otto\n\nInstitute for Applied Mathematics\n\nUniversity of Bonn, Germany\n\nFrom the point of view of mathematics, micromagnetics is an ideal playground for a pattern forming system in m aterials science: There are abundant experiments on a wealth of visually attractive phenomena and there is a well-accepted continuum model.\n\nIn this talk, I will focus on two specific experimental pattern for thin film ferromagnetic elements. One pattern is a ground state, the other pattern is a metastable state. Starting point for our analysis is the micromagnetic model which has three length scales and thus many parameter regimes. For both pattern, we identify the appropriate paramater regime and rigorously derive a reduced model via G-convergence. We numerically simulate the reduced model and compare to experimental data.\n\nThis is joint work with A. DeSimone, R. V. Kohn, and S. Müller for the first part and with R. Cantero-Alvarez and J. Steiner for the second part.\n\nAziz Lectures 2005\n\nDecember 9, 2005\n\nMultiscale Modeling in Biosciences: Ion Transport through Membranes\n\nProf. Willi Jäger\n\nInstitute for Applied Mathematics\n\nUniversity of Heidelberg, Germany\n\nAziz Lectures 2004\n\nNovember 19, 2004\n\nElectromagnetic imaging for small inhomogeneities\n\nProf. Michael Vogelius\n\nDepartment of Mathematics, Rutgers University\n\nMay 7, 2004\n\nMathematical models for cell motion\n\nProf. Benoît Perthame\n\nÉcole Normale Supérieure, Paris\n\nAziz Lectures 2003\n\nNovember 14, 2003\n\nMultiscale Modeling and Computation of Flow in Heterogeneous Media\n\nProf. Tom Hou\n\nCaltech\n\nMarch 7, 2003\n\nMathematical and Numerical Modeling of the Cardiovascular System\n\nProf. Alfio Quarteroni\n\nPolitecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, and\n\nEPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland\n\nAziz Lectures 2002\n\nDec. 6, 2002\n\nThe regularity of minimizers in elasticity\n\nProf. John Ball\n\nDepartment of Mathematics, Oxford\n\nMay 3, 2002\n\nMultigrid: From Fourier to Gauss\n\nProf. Randolph E.

After working as an economist for three years and serving in World War II he began graduate studies in mathematics at New York University. He received his doctorate in 1949 under the direction of Richard Courant. He held a one-year post-doctoral appointment at the California Institute of Technology, and then returned to New York University as an assistant and then associate professor. In 1956 he accepted an appointment as associate professor at the University of Maryland, where he remained for the rest of his career, except for visiting appointments at the Universities of Minnesota, Oxford, and Newcastle upon Tyne. He was promoted to full professor in 1958 and became an emeritus in 1988.\n\nAvron Douglis's research, noted for its depth, precision, and richness, covered the entire range of the theory of partial differential equations: linear and nonlinear; elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic. The famous papers he had written with S. Agmon and L. Nirenberg are among the most frequently cited in all of mathematics.\n\nThe Avron Douglis Library is housed in the department.\n\nThe Avron Douglis Lectures were established by the family and friends of Avron Douglis to honor his memory. Each academic year it brings to Maryland a distinguished expert to speak on a subject related to partial differential equations.\n\nApril 17, 2024 - Long Time Dynamics of Fluids and Plasmas\n\nPeter Constantin\n\nPrinceton University\n\nFluids interacting with charged particles belong to many realms of scientific endeavor, ranging from electrochemistry and electrophysiology, to astrophysics and nuclear fusion engineering. I will discuss first the case of electrostatic interactions, relevant to electrochemistry and elctrophysiology. The models consist of Navier-Stokes equations for the fluid, coupled to equations describing the evolution of charge densities, with negligible magnetic effects. The resulting systems, Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes and electroconvection systems, have a rich dynamical behavior under non-equilibrium boundary conditions, but exhibit entropic relaxation under equilibrium boundary conditions. Mathematically, this relaxation is due to the presence of nontrivial dissipative structures. I will present some of the ideas of proofs of regularity and stability, some of the results about the existence of non-equilibrium states, and the problem of electroneutrality. I will then discuss strong magnetic fields and relaxation to magneto-hydrostatic (MHS) equilibria via viscous and non-dissipative mechanisms. This is a mathematical and potentially numerical approach to reach MHS configurations which are of interest to stellarator fusion design. I will present some of the challenges of this area. Finally, if time permits, I will also briefly discuss problems of relativistic plasma kinetics.\n\nAbout the Speaker\n\nPeter Constantin is the John von Neumann Professor of Mathematics and Applied and Computational Mathematics at Princeton University. Peter Constantin received his B.A and M.A. summa cum laude from the University of Bucharest, Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics. He obtained his Ph.D. from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem under the direction of Shmuel Agmon. Constantin's work is focused on the analysis of PDE and nonlocal models arising in statistical and nonlinear physics. Constantin worked on scattering for Schrodinger operators, on finite dimensional aspects of the dynamics of Navier-Stokes equations, on blow up for models of Euler equations. He introduced active scalars, and, with Jean-Claude Saut, local smoothing for general dispersive PDE. Constantin worked on singularity formation in fluid interfaces, on turbulence shell models, on upper bounds for turbulent transport, on the inviscid limit, on stochastic representation of Navier-Stokes equations, on the Onsager conjecture. He worked on critical nonlocal dissipative equations, on complex fluids, and on ionic diffusion in fluids. Constantin has advised thirteen graduate students in mathematics, and served in the committee of seven graduate students in physics. He mentored twenty-five postdoctoral associates. Constantin served as Chair of the Mathematics Department of the University of Chicago and is the Director of the Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Princeton University. Constantin is a Fellow of the Institute of Physics, a SIAM Fellow, and Inaugural Fellow of the American Mathematical Society, a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nFebruary 14, 2023 - Internal Waves in 2D Aquaria and Homeomorphisms of the Circle\n\nMaciej Zworski\n\nUC Berkeley\n\nThe connections between the formation of internal waves in fluids, spectral theory, and homeomorphisms of the circle were investigated by oceanographers in the 90s and resulted in novel experimental observations (Leo Maas et al, 1997). The specific homeomorphism is given by a ``chess billiard\" and has been considered by many authors (Fritz John 1941, Vladimir Arnold 1957, Jim Ralston 1973... ). The relation between the nonlinear dynamics of this homeomorphism and linearized internal waves provides a striking example of classical/quantum correspondence (in a classical and surprising setting of fluids!). I will illustrate the results with numerical and experimental examples and explain how classical concepts such as rotation numbers of homeomorphisms (introduced by Henri Poincare) are related to solutions of the Poincare evolution problem (so named by Elie Cartan). The talk is based on joint work with Semyon Dyatlov and Jian Wang. I will also mention recent progress by Zhenhao Li on the case of irrational rotation numbers.\n\nMarch 4, 2020 - Flows of Vector Fields: Classical and Modern\n\nCamillo De Lellis\n\nIAS, Princeton\n\nConsider a (possibly time-dependent) vector field v on the Euclidean space. The classical Cauchy-Lipschitz (also named Picard-Lindelöf) Theorem states that, if the vector field v is Lipschitz in space, for every initial datum x there is a unique trajectory γ starting at x at time 0 and solving the ODE.(t) = v(t, γ(t). The theorem looses its validity as soon as v is slightly less regular. However, if we bundle all trajectories into a global map allowing x to vary, a celebrated theory put forward by DiPerna and Lions in the 80's show that there is a unique such flow under very reasonable conditions and for much less regular vector fields. A long-standing open question is whether this theory is the byproduct of a stronger classical result which ensures the uniqueness of trajectories for almost every initial datum. I will give a complete answer to the latter question and draw connections with partial differential equations, harmonic analysis, probability theory and Gromov’s h-principle.\n\nDecember 8, 2017 - The Threshold Theorems for the Hyperbolic Yang-Mills Equations\n\nDaniel Tataru\n\nUC Berkeley\n\nThis talk will aim to provide an overview of a recent series of papers, joint with Sung-Jin Oh, devoted to the energy critical 4+1 dimensional hyperbolic Yang-Mills equation. These papers provide a comprehensive analysis of the large data problem, ultimately providing a proof of the Threshold Conjecture for Yang-Mills, and more. We will cover an array of ideas, ranging from gauge theory to hard core pde estimates to geometry and blow-up analysis.\n\nNovember 2, 2016 - Effective Models for Ginzburg-Landau Vortices\n\nSylvia Serfaty\n\nNYU\n\nGinzburg-Landau type equations are models for superconductivity, superfluidity, Bose-Einstein condensation. A crucial feature is the presence of quantized vortices, which are topological zeroes of the complex-valued solutions. This talk will review some results on the derivation of effective models to describe the statics and dynamics of these vortices, with particular attention to the situation where the number of vortices blows up with the parameters of the problem. In particular we will present new results on the derivation of mean field limits for the dynamics of many vortices starting from the parabolic Ginzburg-Landau equation or the Gross-Pitaevskii (=Schrodinger Ginzburg-Landau) equation.\n\nMarch 31, 2016 - The h-principle in Fluid Mechanics\n\nLászló Székelyhidi Jr.\n\nInstitute of Mathematics, University of Leipzig\n\nIt is known since the pioneering work of Scheffer and Shnirelman that weak solutions of the incompressible Euler equations exhibit a wild behaviour, which is very different from that of classical solutions. Nevertheless, weak solutions in three space dimensions have been studied in connection with a long-standing conjecture of Lars Onsager from 1949 concerning anomalous dissipation and, more generally, because of their possible relevance to the K41 theory of turbulence. In joint work with Camillo De Lellis we established a connection between the theory of weak solutions of the Euler equations and the Nash-Kuiper theorem on rough isometric immersions. Through this connection we interpret the wild behaviour of weak solutions of Euler as an instance of Gromov’s h-principle. In this lecture I will explain this connection and outline recent progress concerning Onsager’s conjecture.\n\nApril 9, 2015 - From molecular dynamics to kinetic theory and fluid mechanics\n\nLaure Saint-Raymond\n\nHarvard and MIT on leave from Ecole Normale Superieure\n\nIn his sixth problem, Hilbert asked for an axiomatization of gas dynamics, and he suggested to use the Boltzmann equation as an intermediate description between the (microscopic) atomic dynamics and (macroscopic) fluid models. The main difficulty to achieve this program is to prove the asymptotic decorrelation between the local microscopic interactions, referred to as propagation of chaos, on a time scale much larger than the mean free time. This is indeed the key property to observe some relaxation towards local thermodynamic equilibrium. This control of the collision process can be obtained in fluctuation regimes [1, 2]. In [2], we have established a long time convergence result to the linearized Boltzmann equation, and eventually derived the acoustic and incompressible Stokes equations in dimension 2. The proof relies crucially on symmetry arguments, combined with a suitable pruning procedure to discard super exponential collision trees.\n\nKeywords: system of particles, low density, Boltzmann-Grad limit, kinetic equation, fluid models\n\n[1] T.

The equation is both nonlinear and nonlocal, and its solutions often create small scales easily and tend to be unstable. I will review some of the background, and then discuss a recent sharp result on small scale creation in solutions of the 2D Euler equation. I will also indicate links to the long open question of finite time blow up for solutions of the 3D Euler equation.\n\nApril 19, 2013 - Topology-Preserving Diffusion of Divergence-Free Vector Fields\n\nYann Brenier\n\nÉcole Polytechnique\n\nThe usual heat equation is not suitable to preserve the topology of divergence-free vector fields, because it destroys their integral line structure. On the contrary, in the fluid mechanics literature, one can find examples of topology-preserving diffusion equations for divergence-free vector fields. They are very degenerate since they admit all stationary solutions to the Euler equations of incompressible fluids as equilibrium points. For them, we provide a suitable concept of ”dissipative solutions”, which shares common features with both P.-L. Lions’ dissipative solutions to the Euler equations and the concept of ”curves of maximal slopes”, à la De Giorgi, recently used by Gigli and collaborators to study the scalar heat equation in very general metric spaces. We show that the initial value problem admits global \"dissipative\" solutions (at least for two space dimensions) and that they are unique whenever they are smooth.\n\nFebruary 8, 2012 - On the rigidity of black holes\n\nSergiu Klainerman\n\nPrinceton University\n\nThe rigidity conjecture states that all regular, stationary solutions of the Einstein field equations in vacuum are isometric to the Kerr solution. The simple motivation behind this conjecture is that one expects, due to gravitational radiation, that general, dynamic, solutions of the Einstein field equation settle down, asymptotically, into a stationary regime. A well known result of Carter, Robinson and Hawking has settled the conjecture in the class of real analytic spacetimes. The assumption of real analyticity is however very problematic; there is simply no physical or mathematical justification for it. During the last five years I have developed, in collaboration with A. Ionescu and S. Alaxakis, a strategy to dispense of it. In my lecture I will these results and concentrate on some recent results obtained in collaboration with A. Ionescu.\n\nFebruary 25, 2011 - Mathematical Strategies for Real Time Filtering of Turbulent Dynamical Systems\n\nAndrew Majda\n\nCourant Institute of Mathematical Sciences -- New York University\n\nAn important emerging scientific issue in many practical problems ranging from climate and weather prediction to biological science involves the real time filtering and prediction through partial observations of noisy turbulent signals for complex dynamical systems with many degrees of freedom as well as the statistical accuracy of various strategies to cope with the .curse of dimensions.. The speaker and his collaborators, Harlim (North Carolina State University), Gershgorin (CIMS Post doc), and Grote (University of Basel) have developed a systematic applied mathematics perspective on all of these issues. One part of these ideas blends classical stability analysis for PDE's and their finite difference approximations, suitable versions of Kalman filtering, and stochastic models from turbulence theory to deal with the large model errors in realistic systems. Many new mathematical phenomena occur. Another aspect involves the development of test suites of statistically exactly solvable models and new NEKF algorithms for filtering and prediction for slow-fast system, moist convection, and turbulent tracers. Here a stringent suite of test models for filtering and stochastic parameter estimation is developed based on NEKF algorithms in order to systematically correct both multiplicative and additive bias in an imperfect model. As briefly described in the talk, there are both significantly increased filtering and predictive skill through the NEKF stochastic parameter estimation algorithms provided that these are guided by mathematical theory. The recent paper by Majda et al (Discrete and Cont. Dyn. Systems, 2010, Vol. 2, 441-486) as well as a forthcoming introductory graduate text by Majda and Harlim (Cambridge U. Press) provide an overview of this research.\n\nApril 24, 2009 - The global behavior of solutions to critical nonlinear dispersive and wave equations\n\nCarlos E. Kenig\n\nUniversity of Chicago\n\nIn this lecture we will describe a method (which I call the concentration-compactness/rigidity theorem method) which Frank Merle and I have developed to study global well-posedness and scattering for critical non-linear dispersive and wave equations. Such problems are natural extensions of non-linear elliptic problems which were studied earlier, for instance in the context of the Yamabe problem and of harmonic maps. We will illustrate the method with some concrete examples and also mention other applications of these ideas.\n\nApril 25, 2008 - Surface Waves and Images\n\nJoseph B.
