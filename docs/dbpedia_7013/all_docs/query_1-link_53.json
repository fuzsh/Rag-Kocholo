Marta Zdenkovic, Zagreb\n\nSummary. William Feller (Zagreb, 1906 - New York, 1970), outstanding Croatian - American mathematician. Graduated in mathematics from the University of Zagreb (1925), earned his PhD in Göttingen (1926). Professor in Kiel, Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Lund. Since 1939 lived in the USA, employed at Universities of Brown, Cornell, and Princeton. One of the founders of Probability Theory as a scientific discipline, best known for his two volume monograph An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications. Many mathematical notions bear his name. Member of several national academies, recipient of the National Medal of Science, USA.\n\nExtended summary. William Feller (Zagreb, July 7th, 1906 - New York, January 14th, 1970), outstanding Croatian - American mathematician, born in Croatia as Vilibald Srecko Feller. As a student he simplified the name to Vilim. At the University of Zagreb studied mathematics for the first two years (i.e. the first four semesters out of eight, 1923-1925), and then continued his studies in Göttingen where he earned his doctorate in 1926 under Richard Courant. He prepared a part of his thesis already as a student in Zagreb. Professor in Kiel (Germany, 1928-1933), Copenhagen (Denmark, 1933-1934), Stockholm, and Lund (Sweden, 1934-1939). In 1938 he married Clara Nielsen.\n\nSince 1939 lived in the USA, employed at Universities of Brown, Cornell, and since 1950 at Princeton University as a Eugen Higgins Professor of mathematics. Feller wrote the review of A.N. Kolmogorov's famous book Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung (Foundations of Probability Theory) for Zentralblatt für Mathematik in 1934. One of initiators of editing Mathematical Reviews (1939), and one of its first executive directors (1944-1945). One of the founders of Probability Theory as a scientific discipline, best known for his two volume monograph An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications, which is considered as one of the finest mathematical textbooks of the 20th century. It was translated into Russian (with foreword to Volume 1 written by Kolmogorov), Japanese, Chinese, Castellano, Polish, and Hungarian. About hundred and fifty mathematical notions bear his name, a među njima su: Feller process, Feller transition function, Feller semigroup, Feller's property, Feller Brownian motions, Feller's test for explosions, Lindeberg-Feller condition, Feller operator, Feller potential, Feller measures, indefinite Krein-Feller differential operators, Kolmogorov-Feller equation, etc.\n\nA renowned French mathematician Jean Dieudonné (and a member of the Bourbaki group) enlisted the following fourteen mathematicians among the founders of Proability Theory:\n\nJ. Bernoulli (1654-1705), A. de Moivre (1667-1754), P. Laplace (1749-1827), D. Poisson (1781-1840), P. Čebišev (1821-1894)., A. Markov (1856-1922), É. Borel (1871-1956), N. Wiener (1894-1959), P. Lévy (1886-1971), A. Kolmogorov (1903-1987), A. Hinčin (1894-1959). W. Feller (1906-1970), J. Doob (1910-2004) i G. Hunt (1916-2008).\n\nAt the International Congress of Mathematicians held in 1958 in Edinburgh, Feller delivered a plenary talk \"Some new connections between probability and classical analysis.\" In 1966 he was elected to the international scientific committee which had to choose candidates for the 1966 Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Moscow (awarded to Michael Francis Atiyah, Alexander Grothendieck i Stephen Smale). Feller had 22 PhD students. Member of several national academies: former Yugoslav (since 1990 Croatian) Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb (since 1937), Royal Danish Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Sciences (USA), American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Boston, and of prestigeous scientific organizations: Royal Statistical Society, London, and The London Mathematical Society (honorary member). Recipient of the 1969 National Medal of Science by the president of the USA, known also as Presidential Award (posthumously in 1970). An asteroid was named after him in 1996: 21276 Feller (1996 TF5).\n\nOn July 17th 1953 William Feller delivered a lecture in Zagreb in Croatian language, under the title \"Matematicka teorija difuzije\" (Mathematical theory of diffusion). He was in touch with his relatives in Zagreb, as well as with his colleagues at the University of Zagreb. During the post WWII period Feller visited Zagreb on four occasions: in 1953, 1956, 1957 and 1958. According to Vladimir Vranić, professor of mathematics at the University of Zagreb and a personal friend of Feller, \"not only that Vilim Feller did not hide his Croatian descent, but he was also proud of it.\"\n\nWilliam Feller – version française abrégé\n\nWilliam Feller (né à Zagreb le 7 juillet 1906, mort à New York le 14 janvier 1970) fut un mathématicien distingué. Ses prénoms de baptême furent Vilibald, Srećko et ce n’est qu’en rentrant à l’université qu’il raccourcît ses prénoms en Vilim. Après deux ans d’études des mathématiques à l’université de Zagreb il continua à l’université de Göttingen où il obtint le doctorat ès mathématiques en 1926 (à l’âge de 22 ans !) sous la direction de Richard Currant. William rédigea certaines parties de sa thèse de doctorat pendant ses études à Zagreb.\n\nIl fut professeur à Kiel en Allemagne (1928-1933), Copenhague en Danemark (1933-1934), Stockholm et Lund en Suède (1934-1939). En 1939 il épousa Clara Nielsen. Puis en 1939 il s’installa aux Etats Unis où il enseigna aux universités Brown, Cornel et en 1950 à l’université de Princeton.\n\nEn 1934 Feller a écrit pour Zentralblatt für Mathematik la revue de fameux Grundbegriffeder Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung (Les Bases de la Théorie de Probabilité) d’A.N. Kolmogorov.\n\nEn 1939 il était un des fondateurs de «Mathematical Reviews» et entre 1944 et 1945 il en devint le directeur exécutif.\n\nEn tant qu’un des fondateurs de la théorie de probabilité moderne comme une discipline scientifique il est le plus connu par son œuvre en deux volumes «An Introduction to Probability Theory And Its Application». Cette monographie est considérée parmi les textes mathématiques les plus remarquables de 20eme siècle. Elle a été traduite en Russe (avec l’avant-propos au premier volume écrit par Kolmogorov), Japonais, Chinois, Espagnol, Polonais et Hongrois.\n\nIl existe environ 150 références qui portent le nom de Feller : Le Processus Feller, La fonction de transition Feller, Le Semi-group de Feller, la propriété de Feller, les mouvements Feller- Brown, le test d’explosion Feller, la condition Lindenberg – Feller, l’operateur Feller, le potentiel Feller, les mesures Feller, les opérateurs différentiels indéfini de Krein-Feller, L’équation de Kolmogorov-Feller etc.\n\nAu congrès international des mathématiciens à Edinburgh en 1958 Feller a présenté un discours plénière «Quelques connections nouvelles entre la probabilité et l’analyse classique» (Some new connections between probability and classical analysis).\n\nAu congrès international des mathématiciens qui a eu lieu en 1966 à Moscou il a été élu membre de comité scientifique international pour l’élection des candidats pour la médaille «Fields». Feller a proposé 22 étudiants préparant leur thèse de doctorat.\n\nIl a été membre de plusieurs Académies nationales : L’ex Yougoslave (maintenant Croate) Académie des Sciences et Arts à Zagreb, L’Académie royale des sciences de Danemark, L’Académie Nationale des Sciences des Etats Unis, L’Académie américaine des arts et sciences à Boston. Aussi a-t-il été le membre de plusieurs autres organisations scientifiques prestigieuses telles que La Société royale des statistiques à Londres, La Société des mathématiciens de Londres (membre honoraire).\n\nA titre posthume en 1970 il a reçu du président des Etats Unis la médaille des Sciences pour l’année 1969. En 1996 un astéroïde (21276 Feller – 1996 TF5) a été nommé à son honneur.\n\nLe 17 juillet 1953 William Feller a présenté à Zagreb une conférence en langue croate sous le titre : «La théorie mathématique de diffusion».\n\nIl garda toujours le contact avec sa famille et ses collègues de l’Université de Zagreb. Après la seconde guerre mondiale Feller s’est rendu à Zagreb quatre fois : en 1953, 1956, 1957 et 1958.\n\nSelon Vladimir Vranić, le professeur des mathématiques à l’Université de Zagreb, «non seulement William Feller ne cacha ses origines Croates mais il en fut fier»\n\nJ.

Marta Zdenkovic, Zagreb\n\nVilim Feller was a son of world's famous pharmacist Eugen Viktor Feller (Lviv, Lamberg 1871 - Zagreb 1936), who built the family house with pharmacy and laboratories (on the photo below) and the farmaceutical factory, both in Donja Stubica near Zagreb in 1901.\n\nEugen Viktor Feller was born Lviv (Lamberg) in Galicia in Austrian Empire under the name of Isak Eisig Feller. It is assumed that already in Galicia, he changed his name to Eugen Viktor; see [Fatović-Ferenčić and Ferber-Bogdan, pp. 21-26].\n\nThe Feller Pharmacy in Donja Stubica\n\n( night photos)\n\nE.V. Feller benefactor\n\nHis father initiated the industrial production of Elsa fluid and its variants (soaps, shampoos, shaving creams, balsams, hygienic and cosmetic products, elixirs, etc.), which was a world wide success, sold in the whole of Europe, Asia (Japan and China), Africa (Egypt), and in the USA. See [Fatovic-Ferencic and Ferber-Bogdan] for more information.\n\nEugen Viktor Feller, Vilim's father, around 1905\n\nwith kind permission of prof. Marta Zdenkovic, Zagreb\n\nEugen Viktor Feller married Ida Oehmichen (1870-1938; Oemichen is her father's second name, and her mother's second name is Pelc or Peltz), of Austrian descent, with whom he had twelve children, among them Vilim Feller. Eugen Viktor's father was David Feller, of Jewish descent, who lived first in Lviv (or Lavov, Lemberg), and then moved to Austria-Hungary, while his mother was Elizabeta (Elsa) Holzer, of Austrian descent. We may note that Viktor Eugen gave the name of Elsa fluid in honour of his beloved mother Elsa.\n\nElsa fluid medicinal soap, Stubica-Donja, Croatie\n\nwith kind permission of prof.

His parents gave him the name of Vilibald Srecko Feller (the Croatian name Srecko is Felix in English). This can be seen in the register of births, Ilica 25, Zagreb (many thanks to prof. Marta Zdenkovic for this information). His address is indicated at Jurisiceva 1, that is, at Elsa fluid dom. The name of Vilibald was given to him according to St Vilibald, ie. St. Willibald, whose feastday is on 7 July. See more information about Sv. Vilibald in Croatian.\n\nThe church of St. Marko, Zagreb, where William Feller was baptised;\n\nthe roof has been decorated by the Croatian Coat of Arms since 1878 (photo by Hippo);\n\non the right of the church is the building of the Croatian Parliament (Hrvatski Sabor).\n\nHe was baptised on 19th July, 1906 in the church of St. Marko in the Upper Town in Zagreb, by rev. Petar Mrzljak. His godparents were Dr. Miroslav Müller, a physician in the town of Osijek, and his wife Marija. Entering the University of Zagreb in 1923 he changed his name to Vilim Feller.\n\nVilibald Srecko Feller in 1907 (?), Zagreb;\n\nwith kind permission of prof.

It was projected by Viktor Eugen's half-brother Mathias Feller, an architect from Munich, Germany. It is interesting that this family building, surrounded with a cultivated park and rare plants, had among others an oval room for music and concerts (Musik-Zimmer). Today the house and the park are in a sad shape, devastated since 1945 during the ex-Yugoslav Communist period.\n\nVilibald Srecko Feller (bottom right), the youngest among eight brothers:\n\nFerdinand, Marko, Vlado, Miroslav, Marian, Kazimir, Dragan, and Vilibald Srecko\n\n(his four sisters were Elsa, Marica, Zora, and Krista)\n\nwith kind permission of prof.

Stanko Vlögel, professor of mathematics and engineering mechanics at the University of Zagreb.\n\nI express my sincere gratitude to dr. Mirna Flögel-Mrsic, professor of biochemistry at the University of Zagreb, for this information (2006). Late professor Stanko Vlögel was her uncle.\n\nThe First Gymnasium in Zagreb (now the Mimara Gallery),\n\nwhere Vilibald Srecko Feller finished his secondary shooling (1922/23);\n\nfive of Feller's brothers also finished that school: Ferdinand (1914/15) , Marko (1917/18), Miroslav (1918/19), Marian (1919/20), Vladimir (1919/20).\n\nPhoto and data from [Prva Gimnazija u Zagrebu 1854-2004]\n\nFeller finished his secondary schooling in 1923 at the First Gymnasium in Zagreb. He had private lessons, and went to annual exams to that gymansium.\n\nMatriculation form of fourth semester of Vilim Feller's study of mathematics\n\nat the University of Zagreb, 1925,\n\nwith kind permission of prof. Marta Zdenkovic, Zagreb\n\nMilan Šenoa 1869-1961 (with his family in 1921) lectured Mathematical Geography (see on the above photo) to young Vilim Feller. Milan Šenoa was a son of August Šenoa, distinugished Croatian writer. Photo by permission of Jasmina Reis, curator of the Šenoa House in Zagreb.\n\nFeller enrolled for the study of mathematics at the University of Zagreb in the academic year 1923/1924. Here is the Matriculation Form issued by the University of Zagreb in 1925, during the second year of his studies of mathematics in Zagreb (during the second semester of the academic year1924/1925), published in [Science in Croatia 2, p. 109]. We underline the fact that the regular study of mathematics lasted for four years. Having completed his studies of mathematics in Zagreb in just two years, Feller continued at the University of Göttingen in Germany.\n\nAccording to the obituary published in [The Annals of Math. Statistics], Feller finished his studies at the University of Zagreb with a degree equivalent to today's Master of Science, but this claim is wrong. First of all, Feller completed the first two years of study of Mathematics in Zagreb, and at that time, there was not the degree of \"Master of Science\".\n\nVilim Feller as a student at the University of Zagreb\n\nwith kind permission of prof.

Marta Zdenkovic, Zagreb\n\nA few words about Feller's professors in Zagreb. It is to be noted Dr. Vladimir Varicak at that time was already an established scientist of international reputation, one of the leading European specialists in Einstein's theory of relativity. His very much cited book \"Darstellung der Relativitätstheorie im dreidimensionalen Lobatschefskijschen Raume\" had been published in Zagreb in 1924 (follow the link for more information), when Feller was on the first year of study of mathematics in Zagreb. Also Stanko Hondl was known as an excellent professor of physics, whose lectures had strong emphasis on concrete experiments.\n\nStanko Hondl (1873-1971), Feller's professor of physics at the University of Zagreb, was a dean of the Faculty (1919/1920, 1932/1933), rector of the University of Zagreb (1935-1937) , and president of JAZU (1933-1942, Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts since 1991); source: Central Physics Library, Zagreb\n\nDr. Hondl was a successor of professor Vinko Dvorzak, outstanding Czech physicist (and a student of Ernst Mach), who founded the study of physics at the University of Zagreb in 1875. It is very probable that Feller also attanded Hondl's special courses on the theory of relativity and atomic physics, as well as at other professors. Hondl spent an academic year specializing in physics in Göttingen and Berlin (1894-1896), where he also attended lectures delivered by Max Planck. It is very probable that Hondl wrote a recommendation letter for Feller to continue his studies in Göttingen. We mention that also Marije Kiseljak, who lectured Calculus, spent the academic year 1913/14 in Göttingen [Glasnik Mat. Fiz. Astr., 2, 1947, p. 205-209].\n\nUniversity of Zagreb, founded in 1669, where Feller studied from 1923 till 1925\n\n(photos by D.Z., 2007)\n\nFeller's professor Stjepan Bohnicek was a specialist in number theory. He studied mathematics and physics in Vienna, and published among others an extensive paper of almost 60 pages in Mathematische Annalen (Zur Theorie des relativbiquadratischen Zahlkörper, Mathematische Annalen, 63 (1906), 85-144). All this shows that young Feller had good professors, and obtained a solid grounding in mathematics and physics during his studies in Zagreb, which resulted with an equivalent of the title of Master of Science at the very young age of 19.\n\nGustav Janeček(1848-1929), pharmaceutist and chemist born and educated in Czechia, since 1879 was employed at the University of Zagreb. In the period of 1908-1909 he was a rector of the University of Zagreb. He was important in organizing the study of chemistry at the University of Zagreb. Under his mentorship, the first PhD in Chemistry in Croatian was defended in 1886. In 1893 he founded the Association for the Conservation and Enhancement of the Plitvice Lakes. He was a member of JAZU (since 1991 HAZU - Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts) in Zagreb since 1887, the president of its Department of Mathematics and Natural Sciences in the period of 1908–17, and the president of the Academy in the period of 1921–24. He was an extraordinary member of the Czech Academy of Sciences.\n\nHere are two more matriculation forms filled in by Vilim Feller (2nd and 3rd semsester, University of Zagreb, 1924 and 1925):\n\nIn [Science in Croatia 2, p. 109], in an article by Academician Sibe Mardesic, we can see the names of some other lectures, including mathematical, attended by Feller during the first three semesters (we also exploited the data from the above two matriculation forms; many thanks to Professor Sibe Mardesic):\n\nMathematics I, II, III (+ exercises), Dr. Marije Kiseljak\n\nInfinite series, Dr. Stjepan Bohnicek\n\nSelected chapters from differential and integral calculus, Dr. V.

In 1925, after two years of study of mathematics in Zagreb, Feller entered the University of Göttingen, the strongest mathematical center in the world at that time. It is natural to assume that this happened under the advice (and recommendation) of his professors in Zagreb. Already the next year, in 1926 (November 3rd), he defended his doctoral thesis Über algebraisch rektifizierbare transzendente Kurven under the name of Willy Feller, at the age of only 20 years, and suma cum laude. His adviser was a famous mathematician Richard Courant, who was a student of David Hilbert. He remained in Göttingen for two years as an assistant of professor Courant. Feller became acquainted with David Hilbert, one of the greatest mathematicians of all times, who was also teaching there. Hilbert was always his ideal mathematician.\n\nRichard Courant (1888-1972), Feller's thesis advisor;\n\nphoto from Finite Elements Corner\n\nThe archive of the University of Göttingen holds a file about the doctorate of Willy Feller in 1927 (Math.Nat.Prom. 0010, 23). The Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences awarded him a PhD the July 18, 1927 in the disciplines of Mathematics, Analysis and Physics with the above mentioned thesis Über algebraisch rektifizierbare transzendente Kurven (review: Courant). As we have said, in November 3, 1926, the oral exam was held, and members of the committee were R. Courant, G. Herglotz and J. Franck. I express my deep gratitude to Dr. Ulrich Hunger from the Universitätsarchiv Göttingen for this information.\n\nThe thesis was published under the same title in Mathematische Zeitschrift in 1928, Vol 27, pp. 481-495.\n\nAccording to [Vranic, p. 348], Feller already began his scientific work as a student of mathematics in Zagreb, which resulted with the above thesis defended in Göttingen. He reported his original results at the Geometric Seminar led by his professor Marije Kiseljak, Zagreb, who inspired young Feller's interest in this topic. As we have already mentioned, Feller completed his studies of mathematics in Zagreb with the title equivalent to today's Master of Science.\n\nIda and Eugen Viktor Feller, Vilim's parents, in 1932 in Bad Gastein spa, Austria;\n\nwith kind permission of prof. Marta Zdenkovic, Zagreb\n\nVilim Feller with his mother Ida, 1932, in Bad Gastein spa, Austria;\n\nwith kind permission of prof. Marta Zdenkovic, Zagreb\n\nAccording to [Reid, Courant in Göttingen, p 111], the assistants of Richard Courant who supervised the mathematical Praktikum in Göttingen discovered at the beginning term in 1925 that there was no longer any need for them to solve problems themselves, since they discovered that the answers of Feller, a new student, were invariably correct.\n\nThe assistants promptly alerted Courant to the presence of Willy Feller. After the third calculus lecture, to Feller's amazement, the professor - an unbeleivably august personage to a European student of that day - approached. Questioning the boy about his education in his native land, Courant discovered that Feller was already doing mathematics on his own. He told him to bring his work to the next lecture. Even thus instructed, Feller was too bashful to produce his papers on the appointed day. The next morning he was awakened by commotion on the stairs leading to his attic room. There was a knock on the door. Courant entered and left a few moments later with the desired papers.\n\nAfter Feller was \"discovered\" in the Praktikum, he was an accepted member of the new \"in group\" which gathered around Courant. [Reid, Courant in Göttingen, p 111].\n\nFeller's first scientific work in the domain of Probability Theory was published in 1935 in Mathematische Zeischrift no 40, \"Über den Grenzwertsatz der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung, I\", at the age of 29.\n\nIt seems to be little known that William Feller wrote a review of the famous book by outstanding Russian mathematician A.N. Kolmogorov (1903-1987), Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung [English translation of the book], 1933, in which theoretical foundations of Probability Theory have been laid down:\n\nWilliam Feller: Review of Kolmogorov (1933), Zentralblatt für Mathematik und ihre Grenzegebiete, 7:216, 1934.\n\nA.N. Kolmogorov (1903-1988) around 1930,\n\nphoto from My Pictures from the History of Mathematics by D.E. Cameron\n\nHere is a part of Feller's review of Kolmogrov's Grundbegriffe for Zentrablatt, taken from [Shaffer and Vovk, p. 56]:\n\nThe calculus of probabilities is constructed axiomatically, with no gaps and in the greatest generality, and for the frst time systematically integrated, fully and naturally, with abstract measure theory. The axiom system is certainly the simplest imaginable. . . . The great generality is noteworthy; probabilities in infinite dimensional spaces of arbitrary cardinality are dealt with. . . . The presentation is very precise, but rather terse, directed to the reader who is not unfamiliar with the material. Measure theory is assumed.\n\nIt is to be noted that Feller was only 27 years old when this book was published, while Kolmogorov was 30. We need to mention that there exists the Kolmogorov–Feller Equation in Probability Theory. Also, Kolmogorov wrote Foreword to the second Russian edition of Volume I of Feller's famous book An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications.\n\nOn 25 September 1965, Andrej N. Kolmogorov was a guest of the Institute of Mathematics of the University of Zagreb, where he had a lecture \"On the foundations of the Theory of Probability\".\n\nSee Ž. Hanjš, D. Žubrinić, Znameniti ruski matematičar A. N. Kolmogorov bio je gost u Zagrebu 1965., Matematičko fizički list, 3 (2012), 247; 208–209.\n\nÉmile Borel's (1871-1956) book Le Hasard, published in Paris, France, in 1916, has been translated into Croatian under the title Slučaj (176 pp) already in 1920, thus spreading early mathematical ideas of Probability Theory. Compare with its new French edition from 1920. The authorised translation from French into Croatian was done, as indicated, by M. L. and Z. M. (i.e., Marija Lukšić and Zdenka Makanec, then at the age of 26; authorised by Vladimir Varićak, professor of Mathematics at the University of Zagreb; Zdenka pl. (= von) Makanec earned her PhD in Mathematics under the guidance of Varićak in 1917, as the first Croatian woman at the University of Zagreb; for more details, see [Vuković and Valent, 2023]).\n\nAccording to a Swedish mathematician Ulf Grenander (in his interview published in Statistical Science),\n\nThe institute [Institute for Insurance Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics in Stockholm, directed by Cramer; D.Z.] had a visitor there from 1936 to 1940, and this was William Feller. Feller came from Germany and Cramer took him under his wings. I think it was Cramer who told him that he should not continue working on differential geometry, which he did before. Cramer advised him to move to probability theory, the field of the future, and then Feller started working on probability theory.\"\n\nCramer certainly had impact on Feller, but as we saw, Feller published his first work on probability already in 1935, and Feller was very well acquainted with Kolmogorov's classic monograph, which he reviewd for Zentralblatt. Also, according to Professor Ulrich Krengel, Feller started his work in probability theory already in Kiel, that is, in 1933 at the latest.\n\nVili Feller with his mother, 1932, in Bad Gastein spa, Austria;\n\nwith kind permission of prof. Marta Zdenkovic, Zagreb\n\nFeller defended his habilitation thesis in 1928, and obtained the position of Privat Dozent in Kiel. According to [Croatian Biographical Lexicon] Feller was also a director of the Institute of Applied Mathematics at the University of Kiel. He remained in Kiel until 1933, when he left Germany due to the arrival of Nazism.\n\nPhoto of William Feller in 1928 at the age of 22, when he earned the title of \"Privat Dozent\" (i.e., of private Assistant Professor) at the University of Kiel in Germany. It was published in Zagreb in the 1928 issue of the weekly Svijet (World), no 17 on p. 357 (in the accompanying text, it is claimed that Feller studied in Zagreb and Göttingen for one and three years respectively, which is not true; the correct respective durations are two and one years). Many thanks to Ivica Vuković for his information about this photo, as well as to Davor Šterc, Zagreb. Also many thanks to FOI (Faculty of Organization and Informatics, Varaždin) for having digitized this journal.\n\nHe then continued his carreer in Copenhagen (working at the Mathematical Institute there from 1933 to 1934, where he met also Niels Bohr), and in Stockholm and Lund (from 1934 to 1939; among his colleagues there were Harald Cramér and Marcel Riesz). In 1938 he married Clara Nielsen, who had been his student already in Kiel. In 1939 Feller's emigrated to the USA.\n\nIda and Eugen Viktor Feller, parents of William Feller,\n\nin Bad Gastein in 1932\n\nVilim Feller in 1936, when he started to work in Stockholm;\n\nhis father Eugen Viktor died the same year in Zagreb, and his mother two years later;\n\nwith kind permission of prof. Marta Zdenkovic, Zagreb\n\nIn 1937 William Feller participated the celebrated colloquim on probability theory at the University of Geneva, chaired by Maurice Frechét. Feller's paper \"Sur les axiomatiques du calcul des probabilités et leurs relations avec les expériences\" was published in Wavre (1938–1939), pages 7–21 of the second fascicle, number 735 of Les fondaments du calcul des probabilités. Participants included Cramer, Dœblin, Feller, de Finetti, Heisenberg, Hopf, Levy, Neyman, Polya, Steinhaus, and Wald, and communications were received from Bernstein, Cantelli, Glivenko, Jordan, Kolmogorov, von Mises, and Slutsky. The proceedings were published by Hermann in eight fascicles in their series Actualites Scientifiques et Industrielles. The first seven fascicles appeared in 1938 as numbers 734 through 740.

Woyczyński.\n\nAccording to personal information I obtained from Marta and Nikola Zdenkovic in 2006, Zagreb (their grandfather Ferdinand was William Feller's brother), William Feller was on friendly terms with Albert Einstein (1879-1955), despite a difference of almost 30 years. Since 1950, they were both in Princeton, USA: Einstein at the Institute of Advanced Study and Feller at the Princeton University.\n\nIn 1939 Feller became associate professor at Brown University (Providence, Rhode Island), and there he started his work on issuing Mathematical Reviews. This important reviewing math journal, now leading in the world, has been founded by the AMS (American Mathematical Society), with Neugebauer, Tamarkin and Feller as effective editorial staff (see [Rosenblatt, p. 5]).\n\nWilliam Feller at Cornell (1945-1950), when he was preparing his treatise\n\nAn Introduction to Probability Theory and Its applictaions, Vol. I.\n\nPhoto from Cornell University.\n\nIn 1944 he became citizen of the USA. In 1945 Feller became a professor at Cornell University, where he worked for five years. In 1950 he obtained the position of Eugene Higgins Professor of Mathematics at Princeton, where he remained until his death in 1970. During the academic years 1965/66 and 1967/68 he lectured as a visiting professor at the Rockfeller University in New York.\n\nPrinceton University photos by Mihay\n\nClara Nielsen, 1937, Feller's student in Kiel (they married in 1938),\n\nwith kind permission of prof. Marta Zdenkovic, Zagreb\n\nIt is interesting that Feller published two of his scientific works in a Croatian journal, Rad JAZU (JAZU = the then Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts, Zagreb, since 1991 HAZU = Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts). He wrote both articles in the Croatian language:\n\nPrilog teoriji mjere u apstraktnim prostorima (Contribution to measure theory in abstract spaces; Bemerkungen zur Masstheorie in abstrakten Räumen), Rad JAZU 249, 1934, 30-45\n\nO Kolmogoroff - P. Lévyjevu predocivanju beskonacno djeljivih funkcija reparticije (On Kolmogoroff - P. Lévy representation of infinitely divisible distribution functions; Neuer Beweis fur die Kolmogoroff - P. Lévsche Characterisierung der Unbeschränkt teilbaren Verteilungsfunktionen), Rad JAZU, 32, 1939, 1-8.\n\nUnder the title of the first article his name is written as follows:\n\nNapisao [written by]\n\nDr. Vilim (W.) Feller\n\nMeanwhile, in 1937 he was elected as corresponding member of JAZU (now Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts). This is indicated under the title of the second article, where his name is written as\n\nNapisao član dopisnik\n\n[written by corresponding member]\n\nVilim (W) Feller\n\nWe provide an excerpt from an article by an American mathematician Michael Golomb, Terror and Exile and a Letter About it (A report from Volume 4, #1, of TopCom), which was a part of a special exhibition organized during the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin, 1998:\n\n... The List of Expelled Berlin mathematicians contains 53 names. 21 of them found refuge in US, 7 in GB. Next is the List of Emigrants among all German-Speaking Mathematicians. It contains 130 names. It is a surprise to me, and probably also to many readers, that as many as 75 German mathematicians, many of them world-renowned, emigrated to this country in the thirties. I choose from the list names that are universally recognized: Emil Artin, Reinhold Baer, Gustav Bergman, Felix Bernstein, Lipman Bers, Salomon Bochner, Alfred Brauer, Richard Brauer, Herbert Busemann, Richard Courant, Max Dehn, Willy Feller, Kurt Friedrichs, Kurt Goedel, Hans Hamburger, Ernst Hellinger, Eduard Helly, Fritz John, Theodor Karman, Hans Lewy, Karl Loewner, Kurt Mahler, Karl Menger, Richiird von Mises, Otto Neugebauer, Johann von Neumann, Emmy Noether, Wilhelm Prager, Hans Rademacher, Hans Reichenbach, Arthur Rosenthal, Erich Rothe, Hans Samelson, Otto Schilling, Carl L. Siegel, Otto Szasz, Gabriel Szegö, Olga Taussky, Abraham Wald, Stefan Warschawsky, Wolfgang Wasow, Hermann Weyl, Max Zorn. The great Albert Einstein, himself an emigrant from Berlin, is not included because he is classified as a Physicist, not a mathematician. By their own work and as teachers of a generation of brilliant young American mathematicians these emigrees from Nazi Germany have made the US the great center of mathematics in the world that it is today. ...\n\nMichael Golomb himself left Germany in 1933, went to the Croatian capital Zagreb, and in 1939 arrived to the USA.\n\nWilliam Feller, photo from [Vladimir Vranic]\n\nProfessor Ulrich Krengel from the University of Göttingen wrote the following about Feller's participation at International Mathematical Congresses, [History of Probability and Statistics at the International Congresses of Mathematicians, PS]:\n\n... In Oslo (1936 [International Congress of Mathematicians]), Maurice Frechét devoted a portion of his plenary lecture \"Mélanges mathématiques\" to topics in probability. In addition to his own work, he discussed progress by Hadamard, Hostinsky, Doeblin and Kolmogorov. He also stressed the fact that by now probability was equally exact as other branches of mathematics, and that many mathematical subjects \"integral equations, group theory\" etc., were used as tools in probability. Another important talk in Oslo was the one given by W. Feller on stochastic processes. He discussed his well known existence and uniqueness theorems for Markov processes with jumps. ...\n\n... In the Conference [International Congress of Mathematicians 1950, Cambridge, Massachussetts] chaired by von Neumann there were three talks related to probability:\n\nC.E. Shannon: Some topics in information theory\n\nS.M. Ulam: Random processes and transformations\n\nW. Feller: Some recent trends in the mathematical theory of diffusion.\n\nCertainly the last of these was a highlight. Feller explained the ties between classical boundary problems for the heat equation and diffusion processes. He also spoke on Ito's theory of stochastic integration. This was possibly the first time that these topics were presented to a broad mathematical public. ...\n\nVilim Feller (on the right) in Zagreb in 1953, in Jurjevska 31a, where he spent his youth,\n\nwith Ivo Zdenkovic, father of Marta and Nikola Zdenkovic\n\n(Ivo's wife Eva is the daughter of Ferdinand, Vilim's brother);\n\nwith kind permission of prof. Marta Zdenkovic, Zagreb\n\nAt the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) held in Edinburgh 1958, William Feller delivered one hour plenary talk \"Some new connections between probability and classical analysis\", [PDF, 6.8 MB]. For more detailed information see History of Probability and Statistics at the International Congresses of Mathematicians, [PS], by Ulrich Krengel, University of Göttingen, Germany.\n\nUpon the invitation of Mathematical Association of America (MAA), Feller delivered a lecture in 1959 as the so-called \"Hedrick lecturer\" about his work in mathematics. Earl R. Hedrick was the first president of MAA (1916-1917). The association publishes The American Mathematical Monthly, one of the most widely read math journals in the world, established in 1894.\n\nFeller was among those who initiated publishing the important Mathematical Reviews journal in 1939, and was one of its first executive editors (1944-1945; the first editors were Otto Neugebauer, 1939-1940, and J.D. Tamarkin, 1940-1944).\n\nNow Mathematical Reviews are published on the web:\n\nAccording to Ulf Grenander (in his very interesting interview published in Statistical Science), Feller had been the editor of Mathematische Zentralblatt. When he arrived from Stockholm to Brown University (USA) in 1939, he had a complete list of active mathematicians from all over the world with him, and that number at that time was 300! Furthermore,\n\n... Aided by this list, Neugebauer initiated editing the Mathematical Reviews from Brown. Later, Feller took over the editorial responsibilities and continued in that capacity for years until he left Brown and moved to Cornell.\n\nAccording to the [Annals of Math. Statistics, 1970],\n\n... he [i.e. William Feller] deserves the gratitude of mathematicians for his six years of effort in establishing the new journal [i.e. Math. Reviews], now the leading review of mathematics in the world.\n\nWilliam Feller and Clara Nielsen Feller in 1950.\n\nPhoto from Selected Papers 1, with kind permission of professors René L. Schilling and Wojbor A. Woyczyński.\n\nClara Nielsen Feller, 1957\n\nwith kind permission of prof. Marta Zdenkovic, Zagreb\n\nWilliam Feller's monograph An Introduction to Probability Theory and its Applications, Volumes I and II (the first edition appeared in 1950, when Feller was 44), it had subsequent editions, and was translated into several other languages (Russian, Japanese, Chinese, Polish, Spanish, and Hungarian). It is considered to be one of the best mathematical textbooks written in the 20th century. According to Feller's own words, he worked on Volume I for eight years, since 1941 till 1948.\n\nWilliam Feller: An Introduction to Probability Theory and its Applications, Volume one, John Wiley, New York, 1950\n\nA few quotations from the book:\n\n...Probability is a mathematical discipline whose aims are akin to those, for example, of geometry or analytical mechanics. In each field we must be careful to distinguish three aspects of the theory: (a) the formal logical content, (b) the intuitive background, and (c) applications. The character, and the charm, of the whole structure cannot be appreciated without considering all three aspects in their proper relation. [p. 1]\n\n...Nowadays small boys betting and shooting dice, newspapers report on samples of public opinion, and the magic of statistics embraces all phases of life to the extent that young girls anxiously watch the statistics of their chances to get married. [p. 2]\n\n...The history of probability (and of mathematics in general) shows a stimulating interplay of theory and applications: progress in theory opens new fields of applications, and each new application creates new theoretical problems and influences the direction of research. [p. 3]\n\nWilliam Feller (1906-1970),\n\nphoto by Paul Halmos (1916-2006) from his book\n\nI have a photographic memory (Providence, 1987); Halmos provides also the photo of another outstanding Croatian mathematician - Zvonimir Janko\n\nWe provide an excerpt from the review of the 1950 first edition of Feller's book (Volume I), written for Mathematical Reviews by R. Fortet:\n\nAfin d'éviter toute notion mathématique élevée (théorie de la mesure, etc.) et pour que l'ouvrage soit utilisable par des étudiants débutants, l'auteur s'est limité aux questions où n'interviennent qu'un nombre dénombrable d'éventualités; mais à propos de ces questions simples il aborde les problèmes les plus avancés de calcul des probabilités, dont beaucoup n'avaient pas encore été exposés dans un livre, de sorte que l'ouvrage est également du plus haut interêt pour les spécialistes. Le texte inclut un très grand nombre d'exemples ou d'exercises proposés, généralement originaux et remarquablement choisis. ...\n\nFrom the review of the 1957 second edition of Feller's book (Volume I), written by U. Grenander for Mathematical Reviews:\n\n...As in the first edition the exposition is mathematically rigorous and at the same time elegant and lucid. This fascinating book will remain a standard textbook of mathematical probability for many years to come.\n\nFrom the review of the 1966 first edition of Feller's book (Part II), written by S. Orey for Mathematical Reviews:\n\nThis is the sequel to the popular first volume ... but it is designed so that it can be used independently. The reader of this book need not have any prior knowledge of probability beyond a few basic definitions, say as given in the first chapter of the first volume. Indeed it is the author's aim, admirably realized, to be of interest to a diverse audience, ranging from novice to expert. The book has a rich texture, derived from the wealth of problems treated as applications or illustrations of the theory. The striking aspect is the apparent ease and elegance with which these problems are dispatched, frequently making obsolete the original treatment given in the research literature. ...\n\nPhoto from The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive, William Feller\n\nAs we have said, Feller worked eight years on preparing Volume I of the first edition of his monograph, issued in 1950 (xii+419 pp).\n\nFeller's book: the second edition fourth printing, of the first volume, released in February 1960. Photo from www.biblio.com .\n\nThe second volume appeared sixteen years later, in 1966 (xviii+636 pp). Both volumes comprise altogether 1135 pages. Volume I had two more editions, in 1957 (xv+461 pp) and in 1968 (xviii + 509 pp). Both of them were substantially improved with respect to previous editions.\n\nIn the Preface to the Volume II of his book, published in 1966, Feller wrote the following:\n\n[speaking about the unexpected success of Volume I] ... The book seems even to acquire new friends. The fact that laymen are not deterred by passages which proved difficult to students of mathematics shows that the level of difficulty cannot be measured objectively; it depends on the type of information one seeks and the details one is prepared to skip. The traveler often has the choice between climbing a peak or using a cable car. ...\n\nHere are the data about the latest editions of both Volumes (from MathSciNet), which comprise altogether 1178 pp:\n\nFeller, William: An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications.

Second edition John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York-London-Sydney 1971 xxiv+669 pp.\n\nThe second edition of Volume II was issued in 1971, soon after Feller's death in the Memorial Hospital in New York, January 14, 1970, at the age of 63. His wife Clara wrote on p. xi of the book the following lines:\n\nTHE MANUSCRIPT HAD BEEN FINISHED AT THE TIME OF THE AUTHOR'S DEATH, but no proofs had been received. I am grateful to the publisher for providing a proofreader to compare the print against the manuscript and for compiling the index. J. Goldman, A. Grunbaum, H. McKean, L. Pitt, and A. Pittenger divided the book among themselves to check on the mathematics. Every mathematician knows what an incredible amount of work that entails. I express my deep gratitude to these men and extend my heartfelt thanks for their labor of love.\n\nMay 1970, Clara N. Feller\n\nSee the contents of Volume II of Feller's monograph on Probability Theory.\n\nIn his 1950 monograph (An Introduction to Probability Theory..., I), Feller introduced the notion of the \"doubly stochastic matrix\", which is used also today. These matrices appeared under the diferent name in a work from 1923 by Schur, as well as in a work by Van der Waerden in 1926. (See L. Mirsky: Results and problems in the theory of doubly-stochastic matrices, Z. Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie 1, 1963, 319-334, footnote *** on p. 319.) Many thanks to Professor Zlatk Drmač for this information.\n\nAs we have said, his books have been translated into Russian, Japanese, Chinese, Polish, Spanish and Hungarian. The first Russian translation of Volume I appeared just a year after the appearance of the book in 1950! And also the first Russian translation of Volume II appeared just a year after the appearance of the book in 1966! Moreover, Feller himself provided corrections of the English 1966 edition for the 1967 Russian edition of Volume II!

Kolmogorov:\n\nThe first edition of Feller's book already obtained a widespread approval in the USSR. Now we bring to the reader's attention the translation of the second English edition, improved and added to by the author in many details. ... It is precisely this choice of material which enables Feller's book to occupy an independent place in the literature on probability theory. ... ... By the choice of problems Feller brings to light their solving by \"direct\", and specifically probabilistic means. This tendency to see behind analytical transformations their \"probabilistic\" sense, belongs to the most valuable features of Feller's book. Deserving our attention is also the author's effort in the book in clearly illustrating the character of effects of probabilistic laws on carefully chosen examples . In many cases the author manages to introduce the reader into really interesting questions of comparation between statistical data and probabilistic theory of events. ... (translated from Russian by D.Z.)\n\nYu. V. Prokhorov in his foreword to the first Russian edition of Volume II wrote the following:\n\n... Professor Feller, having learned about the prepartion of the second volume, kindly sent us a list of many necessary corrections, that were included into the text. I am very grateful to him for his kindness. ... (translated form Russian by D.Z.)\n\n1984 third Russian translation of the third English edition of Volume 1 of Feller's monograph,\n\nalso with foreword by A.N. Kolmogorov\n\nIt is surprising to read the following sentence of Yu.V. Prokhorov in his foreword to the Russian 1984 translation of the third English edition of Volume 1:\n\nThere is no any other book on probability theory comparable to this one - it so successfully comprises mathematical austerity, excellency of proofs, and the quantity of considered applications. Expounding the most complex mathematical questions, the author does not omit from sight the real world phenomena, where a developed theory can be applied. The character of the book is such that it will not age for a very long time.

Goldman, USA.\n\nAccording to [Halmos, p. 94], Feller \"spoke loudly, very fast, with a strong Yugoslav accent [sic! - should be Croatian accent, D.Z.], with wit and charm and understanding.\"\n\nFeller's scientific interests in mathematics were very broad. He contributed to calculus, geometry, and functional analysis. About half of his papers are in the field of probability theory.\n\nEspecially important was his work in the period between 1950 and 1962, when \"W. Feller broke new grounds on the theory of diffusion and Kolmogorov was delighted.\" See [Nitis Mukhopadhyay].\n\nAccording to Mathematical Reviews, Feller's works are cited 1320 times by 1649 authors. The first part of his book is cited 390 times, and the second part 712 times. It should be noted that Math Reviews is reviewing math articles starting with the year 1939, so that Feller's very productive scientific work before that (that is, between 1926 and 1939) is not evidenced there. His most cited article (37 times) is\n\nFeller, William: The parabolic differential equations and the associated semi-groups of transformations. Ann. of Math. (2) 55, (1952). 468-519. (Reviewer: K. Yosida),\n\nBesides two volumes of his famous book Feller wrote 104 scientific papers, see the complete list in the memorial issue of [Annals of Math. Statistics].\n\nMany mathematical notions bear his name:\n\nThe list has been obtained using mathematical references from MathSciNet covering the period between 1970 (since Feller's death) and 2007, citing Feller's name.\n\nPaul C. Kettler, Norway:\n\n...the personal aspects of creative lives are just as important I believe as the professional aspects. At the lowest level, it is personal interaction, after all, which produces great collaborations. Feller and Kolmogorov, across continents and ideologies, is the perfect example.\n\nWilliam Feller has the Erdös number equal to 1 (one): he has a joint paper with Paul Erdös written in 1949 (and with Pollard). Erdös wrote more than 1500 papers, and had 509 coauthors!\n\nFeller-Tornier constant has been defined in Feller's paper written jointly with Erhard Tornier (1994-1982): \"Mengentheoretische Untersuchungen von Eigenschaften der Zahlenreihe.\" Mathematische Annalen, Vol. 107, (1933) 188-232. The constant is defined as the density of natural numbers whose prime factorization contains an even number of distinct primes to powers larger than the first. It is equal to 0.661317... .\n\nTornier was 12 years older than Feller. In 1932 he became a Nazist, and ousted Feller from the University of Kiel in 1933 when he learned about his Jewish ancestry (for more information see [Thomas Hochkirchen], Abraham A. Fraenkel: Lebenskreise, Deutsche Verlag-Anstalt, Stuttgart, 1967, p. 155, and M. Pinl.: Kollegen in einer dunklen Zeit. III. Jber. Deutsch. Math.-Verein. 73 (1971/72), no. 1, 153-208). Feller had another joint paper with Tornier, published also in Mathematische Annalen, Vol 107, 1933 (Mass und Inhaltstheorie des Bairischen Nullraumes, pp. 165-187), and submitted in 1931.\n\nW.

The committee consisted of Georges de Rham (chair), Harold Davenport, Max Deuring, Willi Feller, Michael Al. Lavrentiev, Jean-Pierre Serre, Donald C. Spencer, and René Thom, see here. Recipients of the Fields Medal at the 1966 International Congress of Mathematicians in Moscow were Michael Francis Atiyah, Alexander Grothendieck, and Stephen Smale.\n\nWilliam Feller with Benjamin Weiss, his PhD student, in 1960s,\n\nfrom Jay Goldman's Photo Album\n\nFeller is the author or coauthor of two more books:\n\nWilly Feller: Über die Lösungen der linearen partiellen Differentialgleichungen zweiter Ordnung vom elliptischen Typus, Berlin : Springer, 1929 (when he was teaching in Kiel, Germany)\n\nJacob David Tamarkin, Willy Feller (Brown University, Graduate School): Partial differential equations, Providence, R.I., 1941\n\nFeller in 1960s, from Jay Goldman's Photo Album\n\nAccording to the Mathematical Geneaology Project (with his name indicated as Willi K. Feller), William Feller was thesis advisor to 22 students in the period of 1941 to 1969, and by 2016 he has as many as 1169 descendants. Marta and Nikola Zdenkovic, Zagreb, informed me in 2006 that they do not know the meaning of initial \"K.\" appearing in Feller's name in the Math Geneaology Project, and expressed their doubts about it. However, there exists a paper entitled Feller, W.K., \"Statistical aspects of ESP\", Journal of Parapsychology, 4 (1940), pp. 271-98. Here are the names of Feller's PhD students:\n\nPatrick Billingsley, Princeton University 1955\n\nWilliam Cleveland (2nd advisor) Yale University 1969\n\nGeorge Forsythe, Brown University 1941 450\n\nDavid Freedman, Princeton University 1960\n\nDonald Gaver, Princeton University 1956\n\nMelvin George, Princeton University 1959\n\nJay Goldman, Princeton University 1965\n\nMario Juncosa, Cornell University 1948\n\nWilfred Kincaid, Brown University 1946\n\nFrank Knight, Princeton University 1959\n\nRobert Kurtz, Princeton University 1967\n\nPhilip Marston, Stanford University 1976\n\nHenry McKean, Jr., Princeton University 1955\n\nBrian Murdoch, Princeton University 1955\n\nLoren Pitt, Princeton University 1967\n\nGéza Schay, Princeton University 1961\n\nGeorge Seifert, Cornell University 1950\n\nLawrence Shepp, Princeton University 1961\n\nMartin Silverstein, Princeton University 1965\n\nHale Trotter, Princeton University 1956\n\nMaria Weber, Cornell University 1949\n\nBenjamin Weiss, Princeton University 1965\n\nFeller's unofficial PhD student was Frank Spitzer, see here.\n\nSome sources claim that his another unofficial PhD student was Joanne Elliott (1925-2023), but she herself revoked this claim (many thanks to Professor Zoran Vondraček for this information, which he obtained fromProfessor Wojbor Woyczynski, USA). She became a professional mathematician, and in one of her papers,\n\nJoanne Elliott: The Boundary Value Problems and Semi-Groups Associated with Certain Integro-Differential Operators, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 76, No. 2 (Mar., 1954), pp. 300-331, doi:10.2307/1990771\n\nshe wrote the following: \"...This problem, suggested by W. Feller, arises in the theory of stochastic processess. ... The author wishes to thank William Feller for many helpful discussions...\" Furthermore, Feller and Elliot published a joint paper:\n\nJoanne Elliott, William Feller: Stochastic Processes Connected With Harmonic Functions, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 82, No. 2 (Jul., 1956), pp. 392-420, doi:10.2307/1993055\n\nJoanne Elliott, photo by Paul Halmos (on the same page Feller's photo appears)\n\nI have a photographic memory (Providence, 1987)\n\nWilliam Feller mentions Joanne Elliott in the Introduction to Volume II of his monograph. In Joanne Elliott math geneaology we can find that the title of her dissertation was On Some Singular Integral Equations of the Cauchy Type, and advisor unknown (Feller?). She earned her PhD at Cornell in 1950, and recall that Feller was professor there in the period of 1945-1950. In Rutgers-New Brunswick Mathematics Graduate Faculty we found that she worked in potential theory, and that in 1974-77 she had a chair at Douglas College (at Rutgers since1964, Professor of Mathematics since 1965), retired since 1991.\n\nWilliam Feller; photo from [Croatian Biographical Lexicon]\n\nFeller became a member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb (the then JAZU) in 1937, that is, at the age of 31. He was also a member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences, and the Royal Statistical Society in London. Shortly before his death he was elected as an honorary memebr of the London Mathematical Society. He was also a governor of the New Jersey section of the Mathematical Association of America (1958-1961, [PDF]), and a president of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics in 1947. According to [Roseblatt, p 12], Feller was a member of the American Philosophical Society.\n\nLetter of William Feller to his brother Miroslav sent in 1947, written in Croatian\n\nWilliam Feller was representative of several committees of the American Mathematical Society (AMS), see [PDF]:\n\nsince 1959 till 1961 (two mandates) he was a Representative of the Society (AMS) in the Division of Mathematics of the National Research Council (together with K.O. Friedrichs, P.R. Halmos, Morrey, I. Kaplansky, N.H. Mc Coy, C.B. Morrey, H. Busemann, B.W. Jones)\n\na member of Committee to Select One Hour Speakers For Summer and Annual Meetings (with J.W. Green, chairman, and Hans Rademacher)\n\nNational Medal of Science, conferred to William Feller in the White House\n\nby president Richard Nixon in 1970 (posthumously)\n\nFeller was a member of the National Academy of Sciences (USA, since 1960) and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Boston, since 1958 (Career description: Mathematician; Educator).\n\nMany outstading mathematicians from Princeton University were elected as members of the National Academy of Sciences: Solomon Lefschetz (1925), James W. Alexander (1930), John von Neumann (1937), Hermann Weyl (1940), Eugene P. Wigner (1945), Salomon Bochner (1950), Howard P. Robertson (1951), Norman E. Steenrod (1956), Emil Artin (1958), William Feller (1960), Donald C. Spencer (1961), John W. Milnor (1963), etc. See the complete list.\n\nFeller was awarded the National Medal of Science of the USA in 1969 (Discipline: Mathematics and Computer Science). The National Medal of Science award was established by the U.S. Congress as a Presidential award. It was conferred in 1970 by president Richard Nixon to Feller's wife Clara during the official ceremony held in the White House, a month after Feller's death at the age of 63. This prestigeous medal has been conferred to him for\n\nhis important contributions to pure and applied mathematics,\n\nhis efforts to make probability theory accessible to broad audience,\n\nhis pioneering work in establishing Mathematical Reviews.\n\nDr. Feller was nominated for the National Medal of Science by Oscar Zariski, the then President of the American Mathematical Society, in July, 1969. Many thanks to Dr. Mayra Montrose from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for this information, and for kind help in collecting the data about Feller's nomination. Zariski obtained the Presidential Award in 1965. According to the \"Feller Nomination Package\" kept by the NSF, the section containing the Biographical data states the following:\n\n\"In 1939 Feller and his wife moved to Providence, Rhode Island, where he became associate professor at Brown University, and the first Executive Editor of Mathematical Reviews which was founded in that year. Much credit is due to Feller for his pioneer work in establishing this journal, which is the formost mathematical review journal in the world.\"\n\nThe names of authors of this text, prepared in the first half of 1969, are not written, but according to other documents contained in the \"Feller Nomination Package\", kept at the NSF, it seems that the text was written by Joseph Doob, Mark Kac and Jerzy Neyman. All three of them were members of the National Academy of Sciences at that time, and Neyman received the Presidential Award in 1968, a year before Feller. Joseph Doob received the same award in 1979.\n\n1944 Mathematical Reviews with William Feller as Executive Editor.\n\nKept at the Department of Mathematics of the University of Zagreb\n\nIn the period of 1962-2013 there were altogether 481 recipients of the National Medal of Science (also called Presidential Award), and among them there were about 90 Nobel Prize wineers. In the field of Mathematics and Computer Science there were 59 of recipients, and Feller eighth in order:\n\nWiener, Norbert, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1963\n\nLefschetz, Solomon, Princeton University, 1964\n\nMorse, H.

Geometry of differential space: Dedicated to the memory of Will Feller. The Annals of Probability, 1:197-206, 1973.\n\nOn July 17th 1953 William Feller delivered a lecture in the building of JAZU, Zagreb, in Croatian language, under the title \"Matematicka teorija difuzije\" (Mathematical theory of diffusion), see [Mardesic, Some data...].\n\nHe was in touch with his relatives in Zagreb, as well as with his colleagues at the University of Zagreb. During the post WWII period Feller visited Zagreb on four occasions: in 1953, 1956, 1957 and 1958 (a letter from 1957, written in Croatian by the mother of Marta and Nikola Zdenkovic, mentions that \"uncle Will and Clara\" are in Zagreb, and that they have brought toys for Marta and Nikola from the USA).\n\nWilliam Feller in Zagreb, Croatia, near his home in Jurjevska 31a\n\nDepartment of Mathematics, PMF, University of Zagreb,\n\nMarulicev trg, Zagreb, Croatia, where Feller had a lecture in 1956 (photo by D.Z., 2007)\n\nWilliam Feller in Zagreb, Croatia, in 1950s\n\nIn 1950s, William Feller paid a visit to The Ruđer Bošković Institute in Zagreb (founded in 1950), where he was received by Ivan Supek, the then director of the Institute. The Institute was shown to him by Dr. Ksenofont Ilakovac, experimental physicist. Information by the courtesy of academician K. Ilakovac, January 2020.\n\nHe helped professor Sibe Mardesic from Zagreb, at that time a young scientist, to spend the academic years 1957/58 and 1958/59 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, see [here]. S. Mardesic was introduced to Feller in person by Zeljko Markovic in his office, when Feller visited Department of Mathematics and had a lecture there, PMF, Zagreb, in 1956. According to [Vranic, p. 352], \"...not only that Vilim Feller did not hide his Croatian descent, but he was also proud of it.\"\n\nWilliam Feller in 1960s\n\nphoto courtesy of professor Mladen Vranic, Toronto\n\nJ. Dieudonné, a well known French mathematician, and a member of the Bourbaki group, in his book A panorama of pure mathematics - As seen by N. Bourbaki (Academic Press, New York, London, 1982), indicated that the main ideas of probability theory are related to the names of:\n\nJ. Bernoulli (1654-1705), A. de Moivre (1667-1754), P. Laplace (1749-1827), D. Poisson (1781-1840), P. Chebisev (1821-1894), A. Markov (1856-1922), É. Borel (1871-1956), N. Wiener (1894-1959), P. Lévy (1886-1971), A. Kolmogorov (1903-1987), A. Hincin (1894-1959), W. Feller (1906-1970), J. Doob (1910-2004), and G. Hunt (1916-2008).\n\nWilliam Feller in 1964; photo from The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive;\n\nthe source is probably [Halmos]\n\nIt is amusing that the name of the street in Princeton where William Feller lived since 1950 until his death was\n\nRANDOM ROAD\n\nIf you go here http://maps.google.com/ and type \"Random Road\" \"Princeton, New Jersey\" you will go right to the short road where Prof. Feller and his wife lived. It's just off Nassau St., the main street in Princeton. (Was the name of the street given in honour of Feller? D.Z.)\n\nMany thanks to Mr Paul C. Kettler, Norway, a former student of professor Feller, for this wonderful information (2006). Here is another lovely detail from Feller's lectures, described by Mr Kettler:\n\nFeller's favorite number was \"17,\" employed over and over in his talks whenever a natural number was in order, and the low integers one, two, and three, were not evident choices. This was in expressions such as, \"Consider the sum of 17 random variables,\" etc. This use of \"17\" was a standing joke, which he loved as much as anybody else.\n\n[This is why some people call number 17 - the Feller number, see Wikipedia; D.Z.] One other anecdote by Mr. Kettler:\n\nFeller and Salomon Bochner each had corner offices on the first floor of the old Fine Hall (now Jones, the Psychology Department.) As there was a central auditorium-style classroom on the floor, offices and smaller classrooms were to the outside of a rectangular hallway around the floor. Bochner's office was in the near right corner as you entered the building, and Feller's was at the next corner continuing. Frequently the two of them, precipitated by a quick phone call from one to the other, would meet in the hall, then march around (always counter-clockwise) several times in very animated discussion. Sometimes they would retire to one or the other's office for more talk, but usually they would not. After three circuits or so they would have exhausted their comments to each other, and would retire back to their offices. It was really a funny, and frequent, sight.\n\nA lovely example of a computation á la Feller is provided by his student Gian Carlo Rota, a well known Italian-American mathematician. One of the first examples of definite integrals computed at the calculus level is integration of the the function sin2x from zero to 2pi. Here is how Feller does it. First integrate the identity sin2x + cos2x = 1 from zero to 2pi, and then note (by a trivial geometric arguement) that both integrals on the left-hand side are equal. Hence, the required integral is equal to pi.\n\nBesides his native Croatian, William Feller spoke also German, English, French, Latin, Hebrew, and very probably Swedish as well (recall that he spent five years in Sweden, from 1934 till 1939). And concerning Feller's fluency in Swedish, here is a testimony of Ulf Grenander, a Swedish mathematician: \"... later I had many contacts with him. He used to write to me in Swedish!\" According to the information that I obtained from Mr. Nikola Zdenkovic in 2006, his hobby was translating old texts from Sanskrit.\n\nProfessor Feller was a member of editorial boards of two prestigeous journals: Transactions of the American Mathematical Society and the Annals of Mathematical Statistics.\n\nWilliam Feller's vivid lecturing, photo by J.R. Goldman, USA\n\n(from the cover of an internal magazine of IBM)\n\nFeller's PhD student Benjamin Weiss has nice memories about his professor:\n\nHe was a remarkable mathematician/teacher and person. ... Feller not only taught me probability theory and mathematics, he also introduced me to IBM Research where I worked both during my graduate studies in the summer time and for several years after receiving my degree. Herman Goldstine (a collaborator of J. von Neumann) was the director of Mathematical Sciences at the IBM Research center and he had a number of distinguished mathematicians serve as consultants. These included Courant, Mark Kac, Feller and later on J. Moser. During\n\nmy first year of studies when I asked him about math in industry he arranged that I get a summer position at IBM Research which led to my connections with them. ...\n\nUlf Grenander in his interview for Statistical Science described Feller's character as follows:\n\nHe was a very colorful person. I remember that he once explained at a party how World War I really started. His view was quite different from the conventional one. Feller was very entertaining. He was a great storyteller and he told stories about practically anything imaginable.\n\nFrom an introductory article written by the editorial board of [Annals of Math. Statistics] on the occasion of death of William Feller in 1970, we cite the following:\n\n... His expository lectures and articles have done a great deal to spread the knowledge and recognition of probability throughout the world. His books catch the flavor of his mathematics, though only his presence could convey the full enthusiasm of his lectures. The jacket cover of the third edition of Volume I bears this appreciation from Gian-Carlo Rota of MIT: \"... one of the great events in mathematics of this century. Together with Weber's Algebra and Artin's Geometric Algebra this is the finest text book in mathematics in this century. It is a delight to read and it will be immensly useful to scientists in all fields.\"\n\nIn the same issue of the [Annals of Math. Statistics] we can find the following dedication on the separate page:\n\nBy action of the Council of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, the 1970 volume of the Annals of Mathematical Statistics is dedicated to the memory of\n\nWILLIAM FELLER\n\nWilliam Feller, probably in 1940s, when he worked on establishing Math. Reviews;\n\nphoto from [Proceedings of the Sixth Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statisics and Probability (Univ. California, Berkeley, Calif., 1970/1971), Vol. II: Probability theory]\n\nMark Kac in his very interesting article [William Feller, In Memoriam], wrote the following lines:\n\nWilliam Feller, one of the most original, accomplished, and colorful mathematicians of our times, died after a long illness on 14 January, 1970. The entire mathematical community mourns his death but at this symposium his loss will be felt more deeply, for all of us here have been influenced both by his work and by his person. ...\n\nVolume I, or to be precise, An Introduction to Probability and its Applications, Volume I, is a book with few peers in scientific literature. It is a treatise and a textbook, a masterpiece of exposition and a credo of methodology of sweeping panorama of a subject and a collection of examplary jewels. No wonder it has appealed to an audience so wide as to border on the incredible, ...\n\nFeller was a man of enormous vitality. Not even in the last stages of his illness was his zest for life visibly lessened. ...\n\nOutside of mathematics and science Feller was especially interested in ancient history - and in this fascinating field his knowledge and competence bordered on the professional. ...\n\nWilliam Feller: Are life scientsts overawed by statistics?

Many thanks to Mr. Siniša Miličić for sending me this article.\n\nWilliam Feller in 1959, and Joseph Doob behind him.\n\nPhoto by Paul Halmos. Source mathdl.maa.org\n\nJoseph Doob, a renowned American mathematician, wrote about Feller the following, see his article [William Feller and twentieth century probability]:\n\n... No other book even remotely resembles it in its combination of the purest mathematics together with a dazzling virtuosity of techniques and applications, all written in a style which displays the enthusiasm of the author. This style has made the book unexpectedly popular with nonspecialists, just as its elegance and breadth, not to mention its originality, has made it an inspiration for specialists.\n\n... Those who knew him personally remember Feller best for his gusto, the pleasure with which he met life, and the excitement with which he drew on his endless fund of anecdotes about life and its absurdities, particularly the absurdities involving mathematics and mathematicians. To listen to his lecture was a unique experience, for no one else could lecture with such intense excitement. No one could generate in himself as well as in his auditors so much intense excitement. In losing him, the world of mathematics has lost one of its strongest personalities as well as one of its strongest researchers.\n\nIn the same obituary Joseph Doob wrote the following:\n\nFeller (1906-1970) made original and profound contributions to probability theory over a period (from 1935 till his death) over which it was transformed from a poor relation to a central branch of mathematics.\n\nVilim Feller, photo from [Vranic]\n\nphoto by Orren Jack Turner, Princeton University Library\n\nVilim Feller in 1907 (?), Zagreb;\n\nwith kind permission of prof. Marta Zdenkovic, Zagreb\n\nJoe Doob said the following in his conversation with J.L. Snell:\n\n... While writing my book [Stochastic Processes] I had an argument with Feller. He asserted that everyone said \"random variable\" and I asserted that everyone said \"chance variable.\" We obviously had to use the same name in our books, so we decided the issue by a stochastic procedure. That is, we tossed for it and he won.\n\n... My inclination has always been to look for general theories and to avoid computation. A discussion I once had with Feller in a New York subway illustrates this attitude and its limitations. We were discussing the Markov property and I remarked that the Chapman Kolmogorov equation did not make a process Markovian. This statement satisfied me, but not Feller, who liked computation and examples as well as theory. It was characteristic of our attitudes that at first he did not believe me but then went to the trouble of constructing a simple example to prove my assertion.\n\nFeller was the first mathematical probabilist I had ever met and meeting him at a Dartmouth meeting of the AMS around 1940 I felt like Livingston when Stanley found him in Africa. I envied the Russian probability group but Kolmogorov, who included statisticians among the probabilists, told me around that time how he envied the fact that the US had so many probabilists! ...\n\nOriginally I wrote in ink, applying ink eradicator as needed. Feller visited me once and told me he used pencil. We argued the issue, but the next time we met we found that each had convinced the other: he had switched to ink and I to pencil. ...\n\nRichard Feynman, a famous American physicist and Nobel prize winner, wrote in his bestseller \"Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman\"!, p. 210, that he liked to talk to Professor Feller at Cornell. Feller worked there from 1945 till 1950, as well as Feynman.\n\nBenoit Mandelbrot, distinguished French mathematician, a founder of Fractal Analysis, mentions Feller's monograph in his well known book \"The Misbehavior of markets\":\n\nIt is due to an eminent mathematician I knew well, Willy Feller, who in 1950 wrote a probability textbook widely used at one time. (p. 31; many thanks to Dr. Ivica Martinjak, University of Zagreb, for this information)\n\nHere, we should correct Mandelbrot - the monograph is still widely used!\n\nS Ramasubramanian (Bangalore, India, PDF):\n\nWilliam Feller, in the preface to the third edition of his classic, observes that even in the 1940’s few mathematicians recognised probability as a legitimate branch of mathematics and that applications were limited in scope. ...\n\nLet us see a part of autobiographical sketch of a winner of the 1998 Steel Prize awarded by the American Mathematical Society, which only mathematicians can write:\n\nDoron Zeilberger was born on July 2, 1950, in Haifa, Israel, to Ruth (Alexander) and Yehudah Zeilberger. He received his Ph.D. in 1976, from the Weizmann Institute of Science (as a student of Harry Dym (a student of Henry McKean (a student of William Feller (a student of Richard Courant (a student of David Hilbert))))).\n\nSee also Zeilberger's article: Fully AUTOMATED Computerized Redux of Feller's (v.1) Ch. III (and Much More!), accompanied by Maple package FELLER.\n\nProfessor Donald A. Dawson (Ph.D., MIT, 1963) described his scientific geneaology in a similar way:\n\n...thesis advisor was Henry P. McKean (Ph.D., Princeton, 1955); McKean's thesis advisor was William Feller (Ph.D., Gottingen, 1926); Feller's thesis advisor was Richard Courant (Ph.D., Gottingen, 1910); Courant's thesis advisor was David Hilbert (Ph.D., Konigsberg, 1885).\n\nWe learned from Personajes de la Astronomía y la Astronáutica, Venezuela, that there is an asteroid bearing the name of William Feller (1906-1970):\n\nMatemático Croata, nacionalizado estadounidense.

It describes its generators and the link with stochastic differential equations in infinite dimensions. In a unifying way, where the square gradient operator is employed, new results for backward stochastic differential equations and long-time behavior are discussed in depth. The book also establishes a link between propagators or evolution families with the Feller property and time-inhomogeneous Markov processes.

On page iv we can read the following dedication, referring to volume 1 of Feller's Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications:\n\nAs we see, the dedication was written 35 years after Feller's death!\n\nCharles M. Grinstead (Swarthmore College) and J. Laurie Snell (Dartmouth College), in their book Introduction to Probability (available online!) published by the AMS (American Mathematical Society), provide the following acknowledgments:\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS FOR FIRST EDITION\n\nAnyone writing a probability text today owes a great debt to William Feller, who taught us all how to make probability come alive as a subject matter. If you find an example, an application, or an exercise that you really like, it probably had its origin in Feller’s classic text, An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications. ...\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS FOR SECOND EDITION\n\nThe debt to William Feller has not diminished in the years between the two editions of this book. His book on probability is likely to remain the classic book in this field for many years. ...\n\nFrom Tony Smith's Bounded Complex Domains:\n\nWhen I was in college, Prof. William Feller said that you should always have a concrete model with which to think about abstract math structures, and that one of the most nearly universal models was the 2-dimensional Unit Disk D1 in the complex plane C1. It is a good example of a Bounded Complex Domain, whose boundary is the unit circle S1.\n\nHere are some thoughts of Paul C. Kettler about Feller's attitude towards the division of math"
