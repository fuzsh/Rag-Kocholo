        "text": "Ever since the promulgation of Rerum Novarum more than 130 years ago, Catholic Social Teaching has addressed social concerns, with the aim to do justice to our common human dignity and in the prospect of the common good. While before the 1960s its approach was definitely very Eurocentric, a global awareness grew steadily and slowly since the pontificate of John XXIII, with an increasing attention not only to social issues, but also to ecological issues and especially their interplay as recognized by pope Francis with the publication of Laudato si’. However, was this move from a Eurocentric to a global perspective enough to decolonize CST? And to what extent does the idea of Catholic social teaching itself, as referring to a ‘corpus’ of text considered as the social tradition itself contribute to colonizing theology? What approaches to CST offer opportunities to contribute to decolonizing theology instead? These are the question which this paper aims to tackle.\n\nGunda Werner is a highly respected theologian, holding a Ph.D. in Dogmatic Theology from the University of Münster, Germany, and a Habilitation from Ruhr University Bochum, Germany. She has held numerous academic positions, including that of a Visiting Scholar at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, CA, USA, and Visiting Scholar at Boston College, Boston and Fordham University, New York, USA. Since March 2023, she is a Full Professor of Dogmatic Theology and Chair for Dogmatic and History of Dogma at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany. Prior to this, she served as a Full Professor of Dogmatic Theology and Head of the Institute for Dogmatic Theology at the University of Graz in Austria. Dr. Werner has received numerous accolades for her work, including the Venia Legendi Award for Dogmatic Theology and History of Dogma from Ruhr University Bochum, Germany. She has also been an Editor for the topic 'Christianity' in the subject area \"Churches and Religious Culture\" for Enzyklopädie der Neuzeit: Aktualisierungen und Erweiterungen. Since 2019 she is the Chair Person of AGENDA – Forum for catholic female Theologians. Dr. Werner's vast experience, expertise, and impressive education record have made her a sought-after scholar in her field, and her commitment to the advancement of theological knowledge is truly inspiring.\n\nGender thinking is \"godless\" and \"atheistic,\" it \"manipulates language\" and \"subjugates\" people to an ideology in which the focus is no longer on the relationship with God, nor on the love between man and woman, but only on the \"ethical relationship between sexual partners,\" in which - and here the collective indignation reaches a first climax - neither sexual orientation nor the covenant of sacramental marriage is important. Finally, the criticism of gender theories (which, by the way, never exist in the plural among the relevant authors, but always only as \"the\" gender theory of Judith Butler) culminated in the accusation that this was the ultimate attack on the idea of creation, that God had created man as man and woman. And with this we have finally arrived at anti-feminism: Exclusion from office and public life, poorer educational opportunities and lower pay have to be accepted, because \"the\" woman wants to be with the children as a mother and take care of the home, she puts the family first in her priorities. Even if this means that she earns less, does not have a career and has fewer opportunities, she is still realizing her nature as a woman. In a world in which \"specifically male\" and \"specifically female\" characteristics are not inherent in human beings by God's will, the biologistic justification of male supremacy in society would be deprived of its breeding ground.\n\n“Decolonization as an unfinished Project” is one of the proposals of this congress. However, this ambitious affirmation cannot be carried out in our theologies without taking into account what are the origins and understandings that generated the Spanish imperial colonial thought. It is a question, therefore, of situating the genealogies of these epistemologies that transformed the human condition, reality, and the known world and that many name today as the first globalization. Hence, approaching the relations between the Philippines and the Spanish empire is necessary to locate and trace those beginnings. The approximation between these two worlds and its consequences can be studied, beyond the historical facts, through the history of the ideas that appeared, by the effects that they caused in political, economic and religious relations, and also by looking at the transformation that they exercised over the natural world and its resources turned into merchandise. Locating the genesis of these colonizing processes allows us to broaden the matrix of our theological intelligibility, since it forces us to resignify: the genealogies, the epistemic memories, the inductive methodologies, as well as the theological places from which we are elaborating our theological production. The decolonial perspective in times of Vatican II, in addition to a review of theological frameworks, is on the one hand an impulse to move away from «theologies of naivety» or «theologies of limbo» that are alien to epistemic or ecocidal injustice. On the other hand, decolonial hermeneutics becomes a challenge to elaborate «theologies of the common» produced by those who have not yet been «validated» nor have they had «the right of appearance».\n\nToday the Philippines is third in the list of countries with the most number of Catholics. Of a total of 105 million people, 89% are affiliated to the Roman Catholic Church.In 2021, the Philippines celebrated the 500th year anniversary of the arrival of Christianity when a tribal settlement agreed to take part in a mass baptism initiated by the captain of the colonizing expedition, Fernando Magellan. However, it was the expedition led by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi in 1565 that cemented Spanish colonial rule in the archipelago leading to the establishment of the institutional/hierarchical Church. Taking into context the close interfacing of the Vatican and Madrid (as manifested in the passage of Papal Bulls establishing the legitimacy of Patronato Real), there was a close collaboration between the processes of colonization and evangelization. The colonial rule was abusive in regard to how the colonizers treated the native population. First they established the reduccion system, patterned after their colonial strategy in Central/Latin America to hasten proselytization. Given the theological and pastoral praxis of the medieval Church, this meant an aggressive drive to vanquish all aspects of the indigenous belief system practiced by the indigenous communities for thousands of years. Eventually as a result of their brutal subjugation, there erupted hundreds of revolts across the archipelago. In the course of history, a greater sense of unity evolved among some of the lowland peasant communities that consolidate the collective will of the oppressed to rise up against their oppressors. The Union waged a revolutionary war against the Spanish colonial forces for five years until finally the Spanish rule was vanquished which led to the establishment of a Republic, the first to be declared in Asia. The first seeds of what could be referred to as the beginnings of a “native liberation theology” arose in various forms with some of the insurrections that erupted against Spanish colonial rule. This constituted the nascent decolonization of the manner of interpreting the Bible highlighting its liberation content which would reach a new height in theological circles in the Philippines in the wake of the Second Vatican Council. In the 1960s, the political-economic-social structures of the Philippines worsened in regard to its governance system. This led to the worsening poverty situation of the majority and the lack of social justice in all fronts. Vatican II and eventually the declaration of martial law by the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos who ruled from 1972 to 1986 heighted the development of what would be decolonial theologizing. The Marcos dictatorial regime was eventually vanquished through a People Power revolution in February 1986 which led to the restoration of democratic practices in the Republic. However, despite the reforms under Mrs. Cory Aquino until today, the poverty situation worsened owing to the neo-liberal policies imposed by the State apparatus. This was further worsened with gross human rights violations and in-attention to the need to push for ecological justice under President Rodrigo Duterte who won the elections in 2016. Owing to the persistence of this kind of socio-eco-political situation, a movement within faith-based institutions has once more arose with a strong decolonial with a theological perspective advocating for a militant response that listens to both the cry of the oppressed poor and the harassed planet!\n\nJudith Gruber is professor of systematic theology at KU Leuven, Belgium, and the director of KU Leuven’s Centre for Liberation Theologies. She received her PhD (summa cum laude) in Catholic Systematic Theology from the University of Salzburg, Austria, in 2012 and subsequently held a tenure track position at Loyola University New Orleans from 2012-2017. Her research focuses on the intersection of systematic theology and critical cultural studies, with particular specializations in intercultural theology and postcolonial theology. Her first book, Theologie nach dem Cultural Turn. Interkulturalität als theologische Ressource (Kohlhammer 2013), was awarded with the “Encounter of Cultures” Prize for excellent monographs from the Theological-Philosophical College SVD St. Augustin (Bonn, Germany). A revised and updated version has been published in English translation as Intercultural Theology. Exploring World Christianity after the Cultural Turn (Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, Research in Contemporary Religion 25, 2017). She is editor or co-editor of 7 multi-authored volumes (published by Brill and other international presses) and special issues of peer-reviewed journals. Other work has appeared, inter alia, in Louvain Studies, Theological Studies, Journal for the Feminist Study of Religion and in a number of peer-reviewed edited volumes. She serves on the editorial boards of the series Brill Research Perspectives in Theology, Transforming Political Theologies (Routledge) and Religion in Geschichte und Gesellschaft (Lit-Verlag), and is currently the representative of the European Society for Catholic Theology in the International Network for Societies of Catholic Theologies.\n\nINSeCT’s theme for this year’s twin conference at KU Leuven, BELGIUM and the Ateneo de Manila University, PHILIPPINES is aptly titled “Decolonizing Theologies. Glocal Histories, Contemporary Challenges\". In analyzing our contemporary ecological crisis as one of the major consequences of colonization and in the hope of changing our habitus toward the world, the people and fellow created beings, I echo the challenge of Lynn White that we need to address one of the not-so-obvious but implicit causes of our ecological crisis, that is, religion as our way of conceptualizing our relation to the Creator and other created beings. I propose that a more conscious, systematic way of theologizing and teaching that underlines the aftermath of colonization and furthers the task of decolonizing our way of understanding Creator-creation relationship is where our contributions to various fields of theology can be useful for a transdisciplinary response to the ecological emergency. What we need is a dynamic of transformational ecological theology and pedagogy to effect intellectual and moral ecological conversion that underlines the unique relations between AND among the divine, humans AND non-humans. In this presentation, I will first briefly note how ecology has been used as a science of the empire and as a tool for environmental exploitation. Next, I will succinctly present some advances from contemporary biblical ecological hermeneutics, underlining especially the challenge of the Earth Bible Project’s six ecojustice principles to the various fields of theology. I will then complement these challenges with insights from postcolonial ecological (ecolonial) hermeneutics. Finally, I will provide some challenging implications of this way of theologizing and teaching to our way of living and building back better a more sustainable and inclusive future for our world, globally and locally, in this (post)-COVID-19-pandemic era."
