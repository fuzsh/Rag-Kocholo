        "text": "The PhD student will work at LJAD (Geometry, Analysis, Dynamics team), a top-level mathematics and applications laboratory, in conjunction with the Inria centre at Université Côte d'Azur (McTAO team). The subject will benefit from the complementary skills of the two teams in dynamic systems and optimal control. As part of the KEEP project, selected at the Assises des mathématiques 2022 by the CNRS, the partner ENSTA Bretagne (Brest) will also bring its expertise in modelling and mechanics.\n\nThe aim of this study is to produce energy using a kite. It forms part of a more general R & D approach (KEEP project for Kite Electrical Energy Production) led by ENSTA Bretagne (Brest) and IRDL (CNRS), which ultimately involves developing an innovative demonstrator. The kite is used to capture the force of the wind and send it to a generator, which converts the mechanical energy recovered into electricity. In steady state, the kite whose dynamics are modelled by an ordinary differential equation, follows a limit cycle whose energy performance we want to optimise. This performance depends on the design parameters of the system and the control of the kite, and we are interested in maximising the energy performance of the device."
