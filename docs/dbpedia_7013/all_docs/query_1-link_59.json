        "text": "In Ireland, prior to the 1900s, advanced training opportunities in mathematics and related fields were limited. While William Hamilton (1805-1865) and George Salmon (1819-1904) had distinguished careers in academia in the land of their birth and education, other notable Irish people with maths talent, such as Robert Adrain (1775-1843) and George Stokes (1819-1903), spent their working life overseas. Of course, many younger mathematicians apprenticed under the likes of Hamilton and Salmon, at Trinity College Dublin, and to a lesser extent (under others) at the Queen's Colleges in Belfast, Galway and Dublin, as well as at the Catholic University of Ireland in Dublin.\n\nHamilton, Salmon, Adrain, Stokes\n\nThe whole concept of postgraduate study was slowly changing, arguably driven by French and German models. Studying with a master for several years, leading to a significant new result written up as a thesis, slowly became the new expectation for research mathematicians. For instance, Father John Donaghey from Kilmovee, Mayo, earned his PhD in 1907 in Munich with Wilhelm RÃ¶ntgen, before undertaking a career teaching at St Eunan's College (Raphoe), Maynooth, the University of Munich, and (in the USA) at Marquette University and Incarnate Word College.\n\nStarting just over a century ago, in part spurred by the National University of Ireland's Travelling Studentship scheme, Irish graduates of mathematics and mathematical physics started to travel to Britain or further afield in greater numbers to pursue postgraduate study. Some of them did research directed by very well known and influential people, and on occasion these mentors had Irish connections.\n\nThese stays in Cambridge, London, Paris, Edinburgh, Princeton, and elsewhere generally lead to advanced degrees, in most cases a doctorate. While not all of the newly minted mathematicians returned to Ireland, many of them stayed in academia, and of those, several played major roles in starting up or advancing research programmes wherever they ended up, and often supervising PhD students of their own.\n\nIn the period up to 1960, Irish postgraduates trained overseas with talents as diverse as Picard, Bateman, Levi-Civita, Baker, Whittaker (who had worked at TCD), Hardy & Littlewood, Hodge, Born, Smithies, Artin, Wright, Hayman, Higman, Besicovitch, and Feller, as well as an impressive array of top notch (and sometimes Nobel prize winning) physicists. Needless to say, in this period there are also some examples of doctorates earned in Ireland for research done under the guidance of distinguished advisors (some of whom, e.g., JL Synge, were themselves Irish).\n\nBelow we survey numerous notable cases which correspond to postgraduate work completed between 1910 and 1959 (actually, as it happens, between 1913 and 1957). The focus is on pure maths and theoretical physics; obviously other people in this era pursued postgraduate work in applied and engineering maths.\n\nStarting in 1960, the numbers of people in this category skyrockets: see 1960s and 1970s. Later decades will be surveyed in future blogs here.\n\n(Last updated 17 Jan 2022.)"
