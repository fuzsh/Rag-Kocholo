        "text": "Page 99 →Chapter 4 Coercive Control and Mass Mobilized Violence\n\nMao was keenly aware that successful land reform mobilization first required eliminating the coercive capacity of local opposition forces, as his letter to Huang Yanpei above demonstrates. Without a guarantee that the CCP was there to stay, that peasants and land reform officials would be safe from retaliatory violence, moral mobilization was bound to fail. The principal aim of this chapter is to demonstrate the preconditions for successful moral mobilization and to eliminate major alternative explanations for the mobilization of collective violence. I argue that local variation in the extent of mobilized violence turned on the degree of coercive control in a county—that is, where the People’s Liberation Army had succeeded in eliminating armed insurgents. In areas with coercive control, local authorities could provide a safe and stable political environment for mass mobilization, wherein mobilizers could operate openly and freely and villagers felt less intimidated by the prospect of retaliatory violence for cooperating with the new regime. Using a nested analysis design,2 I conduct a large-N analysis of violence data from an original hand-coded data set of 250 counties in the East China Bureau along with three county case studies.3 I use the large-N analysis to show that coercive control better explains variation in collective violence during the land reform campaign than socioeconomic variables, presence of class enemies,Page 100 → or history of violent conflict. To demonstrate that moral mobilization was the process behind the mobilization of collective violence where coercive control was high, I use county case studies from the data set to illustrate how counties used their control and resources to carry out moral mobilization, while those that lacked this control failed to portray the landed elite as morally retrograde, dampening mobilization efforts.\n\nCase Selection and Research Design\n\nWhereas the timing of land reform is almost perfectly collinear with geographic location and resource endowments in most parts of China, the East China Bureau offers an invaluable opportunity to analyze localities from significantly different regional political economies that implemented land reform simultaneously under the same policy guidelines. Because the Communists had a more stable base in northern China, many northern localities underwent land reform in the civil war period, which operated under the “May Fourth Directive” (五四指示), a relatively radical land reform policy that tolerated a wider scope of land confiscation and violence. Small family farming, not landlordism, predominated in these localities, and recurrent natural disasters kept the region poor.4 The confluence of socioeconomic factors and radical land reform policy in northern China before 1949 frustrates attempts to tease apart the relative importance of landholding inequality, regional wealth, and policy orientation. While other bureaus that carried out land reform after 1949 were squarely situated within the north, south, or the ethnically diverse west, the East China Bureau contained both northern and southern localities. Led by Rao Shushi, the bureau sent similar policy directives regarding land reform to the localities under its jurisdiction and ordered them to implement the campaign around the same time, which controls for concerns about differences in central-level leadership attitudes toward mass mobilizing violence and the possible effects of early versus late land reform implementation.\n\nThe large-N analysis uses the county as the unit of analysis, while the case studies focus on townships. County governments organized, trained, and dispatched work teams (工作队) to townships (乡) and villages in the surrounding countryside, and county Party committees were the lowest-level political entity that received and modified policy decisions from the East China Bureau and regional Party committees. Most of these county-level Page 101 →data come from county gazetteers (县志); however, I also used separately published issue-specific county gazetteers—land gazetteers (土地管理志), agricultural gazetteers (农业志), and so on—as well as archival and internally published sources to supplement missing data.5 Because of the low number of overall counties in this region, I collected data for all counties during the land reform campaign (1950–52) that had a published gazetteer. Since the State Council in 1980 called for all provinces and counties to publish gazetteers, there were only a few counties in this region that, for unknown reasons, did not publish a gazetteer.6\n\nNevertheless, in most of Anhui and Jiangsu the land reform campaign was carried out at the township level, with villages in the same township often participating in political struggle together.7 Thus when looking at the process of mobilization I shift the analysis downward to the township level. I analyze townships in three counties that varied in terms of coercive control: a county that lacked control and failed to mobilize much violence (Fengyang County); a county that possessed control and plentiful organizational resources that implemented moral mobilization to foment violence (Wuxi County); and a county that initially lacked control but was able to mobilize violence once it was able to wrest control away from insurgents (Huaining County).\n\nThe Dynamics of Collective Violence in East China’s Land Reform Campaign\n\nOn the heels of the Chinese Communist victory in 1949, cadres across the East China Bureau faced the formidable task of implementing the land reform campaign and mobilizing the masses to participate in violent political struggle.8 In the winter of 1950, the East China Bureau issued a seemingly paradoxical policy directive called “going all in to mobilize the masses with leadership” (有领导的放手发动群众) that exhorted cadres to shift from their ongoing preparatory work to the vigorous mobilization of violent political struggle in the winter of 1950. This strategy contained conflicting demands to mobilize the masses to identify and struggle against class enemies but also to prevent them from indiscriminately attacking others once mobilized.\n\nLocal governments, however, were unequally prepared to manage violent mass mobilization, as evidenced by the great deal of variation in the amount of violence mobilized in different parts of the East China Bureau. Page 102 →Unlike the Chinese Civil War period—when the CCP strategically proscribed violent political struggle in contested military zones with weak Party support, knowing that these areas would probably fail to implement struggle-based land reform properly—localities did not have the luxury of opting out of mobilization after 1949. Instead, the amount of collective violence mobilized in a locality hinged on local governments’ degree of coercive control.\n\nCoercive control was fundamental to the successful promotion of the moral mobilization of violence for two reasons. First, control allowed the local government to credibly commit to preventing retaliatory violence. Since moral mobilization was a public and participatory form of political violence, those who wished to “speak bitterness” (诉苦) on stage against struggle targets were putting themselves at tremendous risk. What if the struggle target survived the struggle session and sought revenge later? Even if the struggle target were indeed executed, what if the relatives, friends, or hired thugs of the target desired to avenge his or her death? Community surveillance by local militias and civilians helped maintain order and ensured that struggle targets did not run away or attempt to retaliate against their targets; however, this defense work was ineffective or downright impossible in areas where armed opposition was rampant. As Kalyvas argues, civilians will only denounce others where they “perceive the political actor as able to protect them from retaliation.”9 Fear of retaliation also deterred locals from redistributing land or participating in struggle sessions. Indeed, the East China Bureau’s Land Reform Handbook underscored the primacy of establishing coercive control and consolidating political authority at the grass roots in preparing for land reform work.10 A lower risk of retaliatory violence in areas firmly under state control had significant emotional benefits. As Collins argues, outnumbering the target of violence and reducing the probability of retaliation eases the “confrontational tension” that prevents many participants from using violence.11 This tension was pervasive in the early 1950s, when many locals doubted the longevity of the new Party-state. Even the mere perception of political weakness frightened locals and complicated the Party’s mobilization efforts, leading many to fear a “change in heaven” (变天)—that is, the collapse of the Communist regime and the return of the Nationalists.12\n\nSecond, the preparatory work for moral mobilization required a secure and stable political environment. Because of the extensive process of boundary work needed to set the stage for the mobilization of mass participation in violence, cadres needed to be able to work openly with little interference or Page 103 →opposition from remnant hostile forces—that is, bandits, decommissioned soldiers, Nationalist spies and saboteurs, and so on. In areas with weak coercive control, local officials faced a situation similar to that of irregular war—that is, a confrontation involving a weak group of insurgents who must rely on guerrilla-style tactics to challenge a militarily superior state.13 Armed opposition groups sabotaged infrastructure, kidnapped or killed officials, and burned down government buildings. In Tongling County in southern Anhui, guerrilla groups comprised of former Nationalist officials, vagrants, and bandits kidnapped and beat up village cadres; during the county’s land reform campaign, these and other opposition groups worked with “unlawful landlords” to sabotage cadre work, slaughter livestock, “manipulate” (蛊惑) the masses, and bribe cadres.14 Elsewhere, in Fengxian County in southern Jiangsu, a resistance group calling itself the Central Assassination Party (中央暗杀党), allegedly organized by Nationalist agents, mobilized over eighteen hundred people to storm the township’s Peasant Association and destroy the land reform work team’s office.15\n\nCoercive control provided the local government with the necessary opportunity to mobilize violence. This logic contradicts Kalyvas’s assertion that there is a curvilinear relationship between coercive control and the intensity of (homicidal) violence, in which political actors are most likely to use selective violence to eliminate targets in areas with firm though not complete military control.16 While this logic certainly makes sense in a civil war context, where the point of selective violence is to eliminate political threats and deter defection, a new revolutionary state uses violence to consolidate its political power and legitimacy throughout its territory, regardless of the extent of its coercive control. Along with the nearly unanimous moral conviction in the correctness of violent land reform—only Liu Shaoqi and a minority of other leaders believed in nonviolent economic land reform—the Party implemented selective violence wherever it had the opportunity to do so. And violent political struggle through moral mobilization, as it turned out, was only possible where the local government enjoyed strong coercive control.\n\nContaining the Masses: The Role of the Local Party Leadership\n\nThe Party was also concerned about controlling the scope of violence once mobilized: uncontrolled violence was politically counterproductive for the Page 104 →Party because failing to selectively punish perceived enemies of the community undermined efforts to build solidarity between the Party and the local community.17 Despite the immense pressure placed on grassroots cadres to carry out “fierce” class struggle, the Party resolutely proscribed “reckless beating and killing” (乱打乱杀) and instructed cadres to take precautions to maintain order during struggle sessions. “Place those who are likely to be beaten near cadres in order to prevent [reckless beating and killing],” a Fengyang report cautioned. “It is better than pulling them away once the beating begins” (比打起来再拉好).18 Violence, though necessary to the cause, was not to be meted out recklessly.\n\nThe East China Bureau stated that localities should follow official guidelines for handling “evil tyrants” in order to “differentiate between, isolate, and crush the enemy, one by one, and to avoid expanding the definitional scope of ‘evil tyrant’ to include their henchmen or ordinary landlords, which would excessively broaden the scope of attack (以致打击面过广).”19 Rao Shushi, the head of the East China Bureau, explained that one of the “important links” (重要环节) in the bureau’s implementation of the land reform campaign was the unification of the masses in “building the broadest united front against feudalism in the countryside” (建立农村中最广泛的反封建的统一战线); such a strategy necessitated the careful management of the campaign’s “scope of attack” (打击面).20 “Because the attack targets are mainly landlords and evil tyrants,” a Northern Jiangsu Regional Party Committee report read, “[the extent of attack] should not be stretched too far to avoid disrupting class ranks, generating unified resistance, and isolating ourselves.”21\n\nStriking the balance between mobilizing and controlling the masses, however, was significantly more complicated. The Southern Jiangsu Regional Committee suggested that Party training should emphasize overcoming the fear of making mistakes and feeling restrained in mobilizing struggle as well as avoiding a laissez-faire (放任自流) approach. The directive used the following example to illustrate this approach:\n\nWhen some peasants in the course of struggle are agitated by righteous indignation and spontaneously attack landlords, we do not pour cold water [on them] (当场泼冷水) right then and there, which would hurt the masses’ mood, but before and after [the struggle session] we should start from the personal interests of the peasants to patiently educate them.22\n\nPage 105 →A southern Jiangsu land reform report detailed this evolving, dynamic process of violent mobilization:\n\nbaojia heads (伪保甲长) and henchmen (狗腿子), which will create chaos.23\n\nOfficials on the Chuxian Prefectural Party Committee, in northern Anhui, called for strict discipline in the implementation of land reform and urged cadres to communicate this need for control to the peasants: “Through various meetings convey the anti-local tyrant stance of land reform and announce that there will not be random seizures, beatings, and pursuit of movable property, nor will there be complete confiscation (宣布不乱捉，乱打，乱追浮财不扫地出门); instead talk things over and reason (评理讲法) [and] hold disciplined struggles (有纪律的斗争).”24 A 1951 report from southern Jiangsu emphasized the difficult trade-off that local cadres had to manage: “[Cadres’] lives are very hard. . . . They have a hard time preventing random beatings and killings, yet the responsibility falls on their shoulders; if they are too lenient to the landlords, they fear the peasants will be resentful, while if they are too harsh, their superiors will criticize them.”25 Indeed, superiors often had to encourage grassroots leaders to overcome any reservations they had about using struggle-based land reform. A land reform report from the Shanghai suburbs noted: “In the beginning, because our leadership did not know enough, there existed among the cadres many reservations and a fear of getting in trouble, and [they] would not dare to use a ‘mentality of struggle’ (斗争主义思想). After their superiors pointed this out and [the cadres] received practical work education, this problem was quickly resolved.”26\n\nControlling violence required strong Party leadership. The Party faced threats from both vengeful locals and non-Party or poorly trained cadres. Kalyvas has noted that revenge-based violence tends to be pervasive during episodes of political violence.27 The Party was keenly aware of the danger of the masses “overheating” (过火) and often took precautions to prevent strugglePage 106 → sessions from breaking out into wanton violence. Yet the Party also needed to deal with the danger of untrained or reckless cadres, especially those who were not Party members.28 Localities with few Party members had no choice but to rely more heavily on local activists (积极分子) and non-Party cadres to carry out the campaign. It is plausible that these activists and non-Party member cadres, many of whom aspired to join the Party, were susceptible to using violence to display the depth of their political conviction, a phenomenon Yang Dali has termed “the politics of loyalty compensation.”29 More important, though, was that untrained or poorly trained cadres, regardless of their Party membership, could easily conflate the use of violence with proper mobilization. A notice from the Baoshan County Party Committee complained, “In some places, cadres think that killing for the sake of killing (为杀而杀) and struggling for the sake of struggling (为斗而斗) are good things; these deviations must be corrected and stopped.” This appears to have had less to do with issues of displaying loyalty through “leftism” than with vague and conflicting policy directives that required a great deal of training and experience to understand. In this sense, adequate Party leadership was indispensable for properly training cadres, ensuring cadre discipline, and conveying Party directives to the grass roots.\n\nWithout good Party leadership, cadres struggled to contain revenge-based violence or resorted to violence themselves. In Qingpu County, right outside of Shanghai, cadres had established military control over its territory by the end of 1949, with the antibandit campaign ending the following year. But without adequate Party personnel and training, violence here broke down into chaos. In a high-profile incident, seventeen people were beaten to death within a matter of days. While observers attributed this outbreak of violence to the justified outrage of the masses, they also criticized local cadres for losing control of the campaign: “Local cadres, who were unable to grasp the details of the situation beforehand . . . were unable to prepare in advance to prevent the occurrence of these deviations.”30 Du Runsheng, commenting on the frequency of beatings and floggings in the Central South Bureau’s land reform campaign, enumerated the many ways in which poor or nonexistent leadership resulted in reckless violence:\n\nSome [beatings and floggings] were the revenge of the masses; [that is], in the past these people were persecuted by the evil tyrants and after speaking bitterness they became extremely furious and flogged them. Some were because of a minority of rash cadres who couldn’t put up with the landlords’ sly denialsPage 107 → and were not good at collectively strategizing and executing policy to bring the landlords to heel; therefore, [they] adopted this incorrect method. Some were because the locality lacked leadership, and the people freely interpreted [policy] and acted on their own. Some were because of dissidents who seized the opportunity to cause trouble and sabotage policy. Some were secretly encouraged by cadres, and some have been secret floggings and beatings backed by cadre support. The situations are different, but the dangers are the same: [this behavior] harms the full mobilization of the masses and strays from the majority.31\n\nThe Party believed that the solution to this problem was policy education and training of both the masses and cadres. “In some places that in the past experienced reckless beatings and killings,” a Changjiang Daily editorial argued, “it was precisely because [the leadership] had not done all it could do to convey [our] policy to the masses.”32\n\nYet it was precisely the need to recruit Party members en masse in the newly conquered territories of the south after 1949 that frustrated the Party’s efforts to contain leftist radicalism. Party committees operating in areas with lower densities of Party members had to rapidly vet more activists and cadres than in areas with established Party bases. Since activists in particular were crucial to organizing struggle sessions, finding villagers to speak bitterness, or themselves speaking bitterness on stage, it was inevitable that non-Party members would play a significant role in mass-mobilizing violence where the Party was least present. Moreover, these activists and non-Party cadres may have felt that mobilizing more violence would accelerate their careers, despite the aforementioned higher-level directives discouraging the use of violence as a barometer for mobilization success.\n\nVariable Measurement\n\n乱杀)—that is, killings that occurred in the heat of a struggle session or public sentencing at the hands of the outraged masses. Struggle targets, however, almost always endured some degree of violence, as most were bound, beaten, and humiliated on stage and received some amount of corporal punishment; many were killed as well, with or without official approval. If anything, the number of struggle targets is a conservative measure of violence because the prospect of political struggle and the traumatic experience of being struggled against caused countless people to commit suicide. Suicide deaths were rarely, if ever, reported in summaries of land reform violence. Considering these data constraints and biases, I believe the number of struggle targets is by far the best existing measure of political violence during land reform.\n\nMeasuring the Principal Explanatory Variable: Coercive Control\n\nCoercive control refers to whether a locality was threatened by ongoing armed resistance during the land reform campaign. While the stability of coercive control tends to come out clearly in archival data, it is difficult to quantify in the absence of extensive archival data for all localities. Because local insurgent opposition severely dampened the local government’s efforts at mobilizing popular participation in land reform, I measure coercive control according to the timing of the PLA’s “antibandit” (剿匪) operations relative to the land reform campaign. All localities began antibandit operations shortly after the PLA’s arrival—1949 for most of the localities in this data set—however, some localities finished eliminating insurgents within months, while others continued fighting them up until the mid-1950s. I coded localities as having secure coercive control where antibandit operations ended before the initiation of the land reform campaign and where there was no evidence of armed opposition during the campaign. Where the exact date of the end of antibandit operations is missing, I refer to the gazetteer’sPage 109 → chronology (大事记) for evidence of armed opposition to land reform; if armed resistance occurred during the land reform campaign, I coded the locality as lacking control.\n\nAlternative Arguments: Class Conflict, Material Incentives, Party Density, and Violent Histories\n\nI account for four major alternative arguments: class conflict, material incentives, Party density, and historical patterns of violence. A prevalent explanation for identity-based mobilization is preexisting social cleavages; that is, mobilizers can more readily mobilize people where there are strong feelings of “relative deprivation” or long histories of identity-related conflict.34 Since the CCP was ostensibly mobilizing on the basis of class, one might expect more class conflict where landholding inequality was more pronounced. In the absence of sufficient information to calculate Gini coefficients for county landholding patterns, I use three measures of landholding inequality: the percentage of county land owned by those labeled as landlords; the ratio of landlord per capita landholdings and poor peasant per capita landholdings; and the ratio of landlord per capita landholdings and overall average per capita landholdings.\n\nOlson’s classic formulation of the collective action problem argues that selective, usually material, incentives are crucial to mobilization. If selective material incentives drove violent mass mobilization, we would expect to find more collective violence in wealthier areas that had more resources that they could use as selective rewards for participating in collective violence. Struggle targets usually had their possessions confiscated and redistributed—the “fruits of struggle” (斗争果实)—and cadres sometimes would give denouncers the first pick of confiscated assets, though this was not sanctioned by official policy. If cadres were heavily relying on selectively redistributing the possessions of struggle targets, this would have been most feasible in areas with a higher level of wealth. Because GDP measures did not exist for early 1950s China, I use grain yields—amount of grain produced per mu35 of land—as an overall measure of agricultural development. This measure captures soil quality, agricultural inputs, and labor skill; even though many localities before 1949 produced cash crops for sideline industries and traded for grain, this measure captures the overall productivity of the land in a region.36\n\nPage 110 →As discussed earlier, activists and non-Party cadres played a larger role in mobilizing violence and had less oversight where Party density was low. Aspiring to join the Party, these activists and cadres may have pushed for more violence in an effort to demonstrate their revolutionary credentials and competence at mobilization.37\n\nLast, I consider the role of historical patterns of violence; the CCP may have succeeded best at mobilizing in areas that frequently broke out into intercommunal violence or endured significant violence that generated strong feelings of nationalism. Places that were known to have a history of intercommunal strife may simply be more predisposed to violent mobilization because of abiding violent sentiment toward one’s neighbors. To account for pre-1949 intercommunal violence, I include a dummy variable that indicates whether a county recorded one or more armed battles between communities (械斗) in the chronology of its gazetteer between 1900 and 1949. Violence by outsiders may have also facilitated violent mobilization by forming strong in-group identities. Chalmers Johnson famously argued that the CCP succeeded in mobilizing the peasantry before 1949 by tapping into the anti-Japanese nationalist sentiment provoked by the violence of the Japanese occupation.38 To account for the possibility that the CCP could mobilize more violence where the Japanese occupation was more brutal, I coded localities according to their experience under Japanese occupation. I distinguish between counties that experienced indiscriminate violence under the “mopping-up” campaigns or other forms of wartime atrocities and those that have no record of Japanese occupation or wartime violence and atrocities.39\n\nOther Controls\n\nAdditional controls include Party density, the percentage of households labeled as landlords, whether a county had successfully carried out land reform before the revolution, and county population. As the discussion of the Party’s role in the mobilization process indicates, the Party often played a countervailing role in violent mobilization, preventing the endless expansion of collective violence. I measure the Party’s presence in a county using the number of Party members per one thousand people in 1949. Because Party members were recruited heavily during the mass campaigns of the early 1950s, using Party data beyond 1949 or 1950 is not an accurate measure of the existing capacity of the Party during the land reform campaign. I treat Page 111 →coercive control and Party density as independent forces of mobilization and containment, respectively. I do this because coercive control and Party density were in fact not collinear: some regions had high densities of Party members yet were mired in ongoing warfare with local bandits, remnant Nationalist groups, and newly formed resistance groups, and vice versa.\n\nThe percentage of households labeled as landlords in a county during land reform controls for the possibility that there was more violence in areas that simply had more landlords; that is, more potential targets would probably result in more violence. I add a dummy variable for pre-1949 land reform because the Party mobilized land reform in some parts of Huaibei during the civil war, and these areas may have experienced less violence than other localities for two reasons. The problem of reckless violence during civil war-era land reform may have made cadres working in these localities more sensitive to controlling violence. Regional authorities reminded local cadres of the problem of “leftist deviations” during the civil war-era campaign and cautioned them to avoid repeating these mistakes. A 1950 directive from the Northern Jiangsu Regional Party Committee, whose jurisdiction had conducted a considerable amount of land reform work before 1949, instructed: “Do not repeat some of the ‘experiences’ of pre-1949 LR in northern Jiangsu, such as ‘payback any injustice or animosity you have’ (有冤报冤，有仇报仇) etc., [for] that will create an environment where every landlord has a blood debt and everyone needs to be punished and have their accounts settled.”40 Aside from these warnings, deaths due to this reckless violence may have reduced the number of potential struggle targets for post-1949 land reform. County gazetteers indicate whether a county carried out land reform before 1949. I code counties that completed land reform across its entire territory or a significant portion of its territory before 1949 as early land reform implementers. I do not include counties where the Nationalist invasion of Huaibei forced cadres to abort land reform or prevented land reform from being carried out in a substantial amount of its territory.\n\nTo control for the importance of other communal identities, I include a measure of lineage strength. In his analysis of communal violence during the Cultural Revolution, Su argues that lineages played a major role in escalating violence, as interlineage conflict became the basis for political violence; he extends this logic to the land reform period as well. I operationalize lineage strength as the percentage of land in the hand of corporate entities, which the CCP recorded as “public land” (公地). Public land is a crude measure of lineage land because it includes land owned by temples and schools, Page 112 →in addition to land owned by lineages. The clear north-south variation—21.87 percent of total land classified as public land in the south versus 2.88 percent in the north—maps onto known regional patterns in lineage size and strength, suggesting that the measure has prima facie validity.\n\nI use a natural logarithmic transformation of struggle targets per capita, the ratio-based measures of landholding inequality, agricultural productivity, and Party density because of the severe skewness of these variables. Table 18 in Appendix A provides descriptive statistics for all the variables used in this analysis.\n\nModel Estimation and Results\n\nI estimate the effect of coercive control on levels of political violence using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. Table 3 presents standardized coefficients for predictors of land reform violence. The results across all three models support the proposition that coercive control, not socioeconomic inequality, facilitated the mobilization of collective violence against “class enemies.” Coercive control has large positive correlation with collective violence significant at the p < .01 level in all models. All three measures of landholding inequality were not significantly correlated with collective violence. Agricultural development, however, has a strong, significant correlation with violence. This supports the idea that areas with more development may have had more goods to redistribute, which may have provided a stronger material incentive to participate in land reform violence.\n\nThese results do not provide strong support for the intercommunal conflict or revenge hypotheses. Intercommunal conflict and lineage strength have small and insignificant correlations with land reform violence. Moreover, Japanese occupation has an insignificant though negative correlation with land reform violence, which contradicts the expectation from a revenge argument that individuals would use the land reform campaign to get back at people who collaborated with the Japanese.\n\nThe percentage size of households labeled as landlords correlates positively with land reform violence, though this correlation is barely significant in only one model. Having experienced a land reform campaign before 1949 does not appear to have had a significant effect on post-1949 land reform violence.\n\nTable 3. Standardized OLS Coefficients for Determinants of the Number of Struggle Targets in a County during Land Reform\n\nVariable\n\nOutcome: Struggle Targets per 1,000 (logged)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nPage 113 →Case Studies: Chaos and Control in Fengyang, Wuxi, and Huaining Counties\n\nThe results from the large-N analysis reveal that coercive control was a crucial precondition for successful mobilization. In line with theoretical expectations that the Party did not rely on social cleavages and selective economic incentives to mobilize participation in collective violence, landholding inequality and agricultural development do not significantly correlate with violence. To demonstrate how coercive control laid the groundwork for moral mobilization, I illustrate the success or failure of mobilization in three Page 114 →case studies of counties that varied in levels of coercive control. In the third case study, I address endogeneity concerns between control and mobilization—that is, that the Party-state used mass mobilized violence to establish coercive control—with an across-time case study of a locality that initially lacked coercive control and failed to mass-mobilize collective violence until higher levels of government intervened to establish control, after which it was able to implement moral mobilization and mobilize the masses.\n\nThe counties of Fengyang, Wuxi, and Huaining provide an illuminating contrast of localities that lacked or secured coercive control before mobilizing collective violence (see Table04). Authorities in Fengyang struggled to mobilize collective violence because of their inability to eliminate lingering insurgent groups who harassed locals and attacked Party-state officials during the land reform campaign. Wuxi, in stark contrast to Fengyang, was under firm state control and carried out moral mobilization in a stable political environment, mobilizing more than twice as much violence. Huaining is an interesting contrast to Fengyang and Wuxi in that it began with contested coercive control and mobilized a tremendous amount of collective violence after establishing control. Nested analysis designs allow more freedom in comparing cases because the large-N analysis weakens alternative arguments that usually necessitate a “most similar” case study design.41 Since the preceding analysis suggests that inequality and patterns of class labeling do not strongly predict violence outcomes, these cases need not match closely on these variables. Still, these cases match on major political variables, such as central-level jurisdiction (East China Bureau) and experience of atrocities under Japanese occupation; and I compare their levels of violence by indexing for population.\n\nChaos and Failed Mobilization in Fengyang\n\nFengyang County in Northern Anhui exemplifies how the lack of coercive control could stall mobilization. Fengyang experienced a relatively low amount of violence during its land reform campaign. The county struggled against 463 people over the course of the campaign (approximately 1.39 per 1,000 residents, well below the sample mean of 2.75); of these 463 targets, only 45 were executed.42 Despite its relatively high density of Party members who could carefully manage the land reform campaign, its lack of coercive Page 115 →control severely hindered its ability to mobilize violence. An alarming report from the Fengyang County Public Security Office stated that in 1950 the secret society Yi Guandao had joined forces with landlords, local tyrants, and “backbone” elements of counterrevolutionary parties to organize underground armed outfits, such as the Ninth Route Army (九路军) and the Southeastern People’s Anti-CCP National Salvation Army (东南人民反共救国军), to carry out violent raids on county government offices and kill cadres. Aside from these underground groups, the report noted that there were fifty-one bandit groups strewn across the county’s mountainous regions and along its railways, many of which were sabotaging the county’s transportation infrastructure.43 Chuxian Prefecture reported that bandits and spies in Fengyang, and its neighbor Jiashan, were mobilizing armed uprisings and even leading commoners to rob state granaries.44\n\nTable 4.

The Fengyang Party Committee openly worried about the high possibility of retaliatory violence by bandits and other targeted groups against cadres and civilian participants alike: “[The bandits] have blocked the launching of mass movements. This will be a bloody struggle, not only for our cadres but also for our victims’ families and activists.”45 And indeed it was. Groups opposed to the CCP terrorized locals precisely at times when struggle sessions were scheduled to convene. A regional Party committee reported the effects of these acts of premeditated terror on the local population’s behavior at struggle sessions: “Struggle sessions in many places exhibit a tendency to be tense at times and relaxed at Page 116 →other times (时紧时松); when the bandits run rampant, they [the villagers] become noticeably flustered and nervous (显得仓皇焦急), but then act as if everything is fine (万事大吉) once the bandits go into hiding.”46\n\nIn the absence of sufficient mobilization, violence was not severe even where struggle sessions were organized, as cadres were unable to carry out moral boundary work to reshape locals’ perceptions of the landed elite. A 1951 report from Fengyang County’s Fenglin District reviews the outcome of thirty-eight struggle sessions against sixty struggle targets, mainly landlords and unlawful landlords accused of spreading rumors, bullying the people in the past, destroying agricultural implements, dispersing their food, and otherwise sabotaging land reform. Their struggle sessions, however, did not go according to plan. During one struggle session, when the aggrieved parties were on stage speaking bitterness against the landlords, the crowds below began to laugh (下面的群众却大笑起来). The report lamented that “hatred toward the landlords was not sufficiently strong” (对地主的仇恨性不够强). In another struggle session in Chengdong Township, the landlords themselves did not take the struggle session seriously and went to lie down and bask in the sun before returning to the stage to be struggled against.47 While the lack of mobilization is in and of itself notable, what is more striking is the open defiance of struggle targets against what they clearly perceived to be a weak and ineffectual regime that could not deliver on its promise to foment violence in the name of the people.\n\nMobilization under Control in Wuxi\n\nWuxi County, in stark contrast to Fengyang, stood as an exemplary case of successful moral mobilization. It was one of the first counties to select a township to serve as a “classic experimental” site for land reform, due to its proximity to the city of Wuxi, home to the headquarters of the Southern Jiangsu Regional Party Committee, and the committee’s direct oversight of the county’s governance. Aside from enjoying firm state control, the selected township, Fangqian Township, received significant resources from the regional, district, and county Party committees; authorities hoped that the results of land reform work here could serve as a template for other townships in Wuxi and elsewhere in southern Jiangsu.48 This also meant that Wuxi’s land reform cadres received early and extensive training under the guidance of the regional Party committee’s work team; as part of their experimentalPage 117 → work, the work teams dispatched personnel to surrounding townships and villages. An extensive report from Fangqian Township shows that the land reform work team there had a clear understanding of the obstacles facing them and patiently carried out moral mobilization over a month and a half to redefine social relations in the township and rouse the peasants to participate in collective violence.\n\nThe work team at Fangqian initially reported numerous formidable obstacles to mobilization. They claimed that the “crafty feudal mode of rule” in the area had “muddled the class consciousness of the masses” (糊涂了一般群众的阶级意识); locals had many reservations (顾虑很多) about participating in the campaign; and they did not question the socioeconomic status quo. Moreover, nearly all villagers rented or rented out land, which made a simple class-based analysis of exploitation infeasible.49 To deal with these obstacles, cadres set out to carry out moral boundary work through visits, small groups, and informal chats. After convening the villagers, cadres explained the “justness and necessity” of land reform and criticized those who were apathetic or wanted to free ride. The work team then set about to organizing speaking-bitterness sessions to break through the locals’ “simplistic” (单纯) economic mode of thinking—that is, being solely concerned with the economic rewards of land reform. In carry out boundary work, they emphasized that “[we] label landlords to clarify who the enemy is, and [we] assess labels to help the peasants recognize themselves.”50\n\nWhen organizing collective violence, they noted that many villagers felt indifferent toward most of the landlords, and most preexisting resentment was toward local officials who had a more direct, and negative, relationship with locals. There were, however, a minority of landlords who could plausibly be reframed as evildoers, and it was precisely these landlords who were chosen as struggle targets to kick off the campaign. In an open-air space, the peasants attended a struggle session of the most hated landlords; despite the rain the crowd stayed for two hours.\n\nFrom Chaos to Control in Huaining\n\nWhat if state control was endogenous to mass mobilized violence? Perhaps localities established control through mobilizing the masses, which would imply that control was not a prerequisite for successful mass mobilization. I exploit cross-time variation in coercive control in Huaining County—particularlyPage 118 → in Tongfu Township—to show collective violence occurred after authorities wrested control from local insurgents to implement moral mobilization.\n\nSituated in southwestern Anhui on the northern bank of the Yangzi River, communities in Huaining suffered from insurgent attacks right up to the eve of land reform in late 1950. Lineage power appears to have been particularly strong in Huaining—countywide statistics indicate that lineages controlled about 15 percent of the land. Local elites used their lineage ties and their connections to the Big Swords (大刀会), bandit groups, and even Nationalist operatives to intimidate locals, kill livestock, and destroy property. Local authorities, however, eliminated this resistance before the countywide mobilization of the campaign in November. Communities carried out 692 struggle sessions against 2,329 evil tyrants, bandit leaders, secret society heads, secret agents, and unlawful landlords, sentencing 512 of them to life imprisonment or execution; on a per capita basis this level of violence was significantly higher than the regional average for Jiangnan.51\n\nIn the case of Tongfu Township, it is clear that violent mobilization hinged on the switch from chaos to control. In Tongfu, elites murdered township officials, strangling the leader of the township Peasant Association in the middle of the night; and they bribed local officials to infiltrate mass associations and prevent the mobilization of class struggle, using these groups to beat up and imprison poor peasants.52 This situation changed once the Party committee dispatched a land reform work team to retake power from the local resistance. Locals had been nervous about participating in the campaign because of the retaliatory violence already used against them. To rectify this, the work team reformed the local Peasant Association, cleansed the ranks of corrupt cadres, and arrested the “evil tyrant” ringleaders who had taken power. These evil tyrants were two brothers, a pair of “evil gentry” who had formerly collaborated with the Nationalists to carry out “antibandit” operations. They were known to extort money and steal property from villagers, with one of them having stolen a poor peasant’s wife, and, most notably, had killed a local couple’s eldest son. The work team held a community-wide meeting to announce that they had apprehended the evil tyrants, articulated the state’s policy of leniency toward those who left the Big Swords society, to which many villagers belonged, and encouraged villagers to join the Peasant Association. Despite these assurances, few people said anything at the meeting. Wang Yiwen, one of the original accusers who helped the work team expose the web of corruption spun by the evil Page 119 →tyrants, said that he was afraid that he’d be the first to get killed once the Nationalists came back.\n\nSimply reestablishing coercive control was not sufficient to mobilize locals: while there were still doubts about the credibility of the Party’s retaking of power, there were also feelings of apathy to overcome. When Wang Yiwen first went to look for people to accuse the evil tyrants at the first Peasant Association meeting, he came back dismayed because the handful of people he could find who would say anything merely said, “What’s past is past” (过去的事情算了). The work team resorted to a strategy of finding, inducing, and linking up grievances (访苦，引苦，串苦). After the Peasant Association meeting, the work team and the small handful of the aggrieved worked together to think of ways to recruit more people to share their grievances with the community. They had each aggrieved person go out to recruit two more people to help the locals break through their anxieties. In just two days, they went from five to over thirty accusers and increased the ranks of the Peasant Association to over 110. They also worked to use these stories of wrongdoing to mobilize other villagers to come to the impending struggle session. After Wang Yibao’s second son died of illness, cadres mobilized locals and sent representatives to console him but also to “encourage his hatred” (鼓动王挺高仇恨心), since his first son had been murdered by one of the evil tyrants and had not yet been avenged. They then used this same story to educate the entire community, to “take the hatred of one and turn it into class hatred (把个人仇恨，变为阶级仇恨).”\n\nWith these moral boundaries set, it was time to activate them at the struggle session through moral theatrics. Before the struggle session, it was decided that those with “big grievances would speak first” (大苦先诉) and that the evil tyrants would be forced to wear mourning clothing and carry the spirit tablet of Wang Yibao’s deceased son (决定要恶霸披麻戴孝捧灵牌子). Over four hundred villagers showed up to the struggle session. The two evil tyrants were paraded out, along with Wang Yibao and his wife, and their deceased son, in funereal attire, holding the deceased son’s spirit tablet (突进人堆，小孩子戴孝披麻，捧灵牌，进会场). The accusers quickly became riled up and tore at the struggle targets’ clothing, demanding they kneel and hold up the spirit tablet. Wang Yibao and his wife spoke bitterness, crying and cursing themselves hoarse; the audience fell into a mournful silence. In total, twenty-eight people denounced the struggle targets. Multiple times the masses demanded to beat him to death on the spot; one of the aggrieved wanted to toss them into the river. By the end, the crowd Page 120 →agreed on shooting him. At the struggle session, they were sent to the People’s Court for sentencing.\n\nThe success of this initial struggle session facilitated further mobilization. Township cadres met to discuss holding three struggle sessions over three days, with each village participating. Locals had been so agitated by the previous struggle sessions that by the third it was discovered that many of them had snuck knives and awls in with them so they could slash the struggle targets. The militia monitored the crowd and prepared itself to pull people away to keep struggle targets from being beaten to death on the spot, thereby prematurely ending the struggle session. After this short string of struggle sessions, the township Peasant Association convened the community to summarize the content of the struggle sessions and then discussed other policy matters, such as distributing class labels, organizing leadership for further mobilization—that is, military conscription, production, and so on.53\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions\n\nMany accounts of state-mobilized violence argue that mass violence is most likely where the state is absent. Timothy Snyder, in his exploration of mass violence on the German-Soviet borderlands during World War II, concludes that the greatest amount of violence occurred not in areas with direct state mobilization but rather in “zones of statelessness,” where locals could embark on murderous rampages against their Jewish populations.54 Similarly, Su Yang asserts that locals in relatively remote areas killed far more people during the Cultural Revolution.55 Once political elites initiate a campaign of violence, the political periphery becomes the front line of slaughter.\n\nI argue the opposite: the mobilization of collective violence requires the state to possess a coercive monopoly. While the local population and careerist officials may try to expand the boundaries of violence once mobilized, I find that the state’s elimination of the coercive capacity of its local competitors is a necessary first step. This process of state-mobilized violence does not appear to be a function of landholding inequality or political variables, like past patterns of violence, that figure heavily in scholarly accounts of civil war violence and genocide. Economic development, however, does appear to have mattered for overall levels of land reform violence, as areas that were wealthier experienced more collective violence.\n\nPage 121 →Despite the lack of strong quantitative support for class conflict and historical violence arguments, cadres did tailor their moral mobilization to the local political economy, focusing on the social relations and norms that characterized interactions between elites and villagers. Socioeconomic conditions, naturally, influenced the kinds of local elites who predominated in a locality and whom the CCP targeted in its mobilization work. As I argue in the following chapter, if a local government’s degree of control determined the intensity of violence at the grass roots, local social relations determined its content—that is, the kinds of social relationships that cadres used in their moral boundary work and the fodder they used in organizing moral theatrics."
