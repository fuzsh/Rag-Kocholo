        "text": "Ryan Ramsey gave the Quad Cities River Bandits another quality start Tuesday night, and Trevor Werner hit a home run for the second straight game.\n\nWith those two leading the way, the Bandits opened this week’s six-game homestand against the Midwest League-leading Wisconsin Timber Rattlers with a solid 5-0 victory.\n\nThe victory snapped QC’s two-game losing streak and moved the Bandits to 48-54 for the season. QC is now 18-19 in the Western Division second-half race.\n\nIt was just the second shutout loss of the season for Wisconsin (65-37, 22-13 in the second half).\n\nRamsey pitched five shutout innings, allowing three hits. It was his fourth straight start allowing no more than one run. He walked one batter and struck out six, matching his season high.\n\nQC scored in both the first and third innings after two were out — both frames after Kansas City's highly touted rookie Jac Caglianone made the second out in each.\n\nIn the first, Carson Roccaforte singled home Spencer Nivens, who had doubled ahead of Caglianone.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn the third, it was again Nivens getting things started with a one-out single. Werner then laced a two-run homer over the fence in left field off Wisconsin starter Patricio Aquino (L, 3-4).\n\nCaglianone picked up his first professional base hit, ripping a 110 mile per hour liner to the wall in right for a double. He finished 1-for-4.\n\nThe Bandits added a pair of insurance runs in the eighth when Omar Hernandez singled in Roccaforte and Justin Johnson, who reached on two of QC’s three walks in the frame.\n\nWisconsin recorded five hits, three of those doubles by Cooper Pratt — his first three two-baggers of the season.\n\nQC lived dangerously late in the game as the Timber Rattlers loaded the bases in the eighth with one out. However, Chazz Martinez, who hit two batters in the frame as he pitched into a jam, got out of it without any runs scoring.\n\nThe series is scheduled to resume Tuesday evening at MWP. QC is scheduled to start right-handed pitcher Ethan Bosacker (3-1, 1.69 ERA) against Wisconsin left-hander Brian Fitzpatrick (4-1, 2.83 ERA).\n\nAnother promotion: While the Bandits did add two to the roster this week, they lost one of their most reliable pitchers as Chase Wallace was promoted to Class AA Northwest Arkansas.\n\nHe is the eighth Bandit player to move up this season.\n\nThe 25-year-old right-handed reliever made 27 appearances for Quad Cities this season recording a 1-3 record with a 2.82 ERA. His 0.83 WHIP was the best among Midwest League relievers with at least 17 appearances. He walked just nine batters while striking out 38 in his third year in the Quad-Cities.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nGet in the game with our Prep Sports Newsletter\n\nSent weekly directly to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nTom Johnston\n\nsports writer/golf editor\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
