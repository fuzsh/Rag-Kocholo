        "text": "On September 2, 1949, United States intelligence reported that \"some 100,000 well-trained troops\" under the \"Moslem military commander\" Ma Bufang (马步芳) represented the last \"major effective anti-Communist group in the Chinese Northwest.\" Declaring, \"His troops are considered completely loyal and there is no record of any desertion to the Communists in ten years of fighting,\" the \"top secret\" memorandum concluded by suggesting that, if supplied with desperately needed ammunition, \"he and his troops have the will to fight indefinitely.\"1 That assistance would not materialize. Counter to the bullish intelligence assessment, by then desertions already were endemic within Ma's armies. Most astonishingly, on August 28, two days after Gansu's capital, Lanzhou, had fallen to the Communists, Ma Bufang himself fled Northwest China never to return. Barely a week later, units of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) marched largely unopposed into Ma's former [End Page 208] stronghold of Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province. As summarized a year later by the American political scientist John Lindbeck, \"In one month's span China's Northwest fell to the Communists.\"2\n\nThe certitude with which US analysts had predicted the steadfastness of Ma's soldiers was based in part on the premise that Muslim troops would remain loyal to a Muslim commander and in part on the presumed \"antipathy of the Moslem religion to Communism.\" These were not uncommon assumptions. The \"conflict between the followers of Marx and Allah,\" as Lindbeck colorfully described it,3 was also of grave concern to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Despite concerted efforts for over more than a decade, by 1949 the CCP had experienced only limited success attracting support from China's Northwest Sino-Muslim communities, while some of its worst battlefield defeats had come at the hands of Muslim-led armies.4 As explanation, officials involved in \"nationalities work\" repeatedly cited the \"conservative\" nature of Islamic culture and religion as an \"obstacle to nationality and class awakening.\" However, they were quick to shift the lion's share of the blame to what the party referred to as \"great nationality chauvinism\" (大民族主义 da minzu zhuyi) or more commonly as \"great Han chauvinism\" (大汉族主义 da Hanzu zhuyi). The claim was that centuries of repression and exploitation at the hands of the Han majority—in particular, the cataclysmic violence visited upon many Northwest Muslim communities in the late nineteenth century—had left them distrustful of the overwhelmingly Han PLA and CCP and susceptible to manipulation by reactionary Muslim leaders, especially the so-called \"Ma family warlords\" who had dominated the Northwest since the last years of the Qing Empire.5\n\nThis article explores the CCP's efforts to navigate a particularly complex ethnocultural landscape in the period immediately prior to and following its 1949 victory in the Chinese Civil War. In particular, it considers the CCP's decision to minoritize Sino-Muslims as a discrete Hui minzu (民族), or nationality, in the context of the party's foundational contention that disunity between ethnocultural blocs was a consequence of great Han chauvinism.6 The geographic focus is on what has been called the \"Qinghai-Gansu Highlands,\" the ethnoculturally and topographically diverse Hehuang (河湟) region that lies in today's southwestern Gansu Province and eastern Qinghai Province or, from a Tibetan perspective, the northeastern edge of the vast region known as Amdo.7 For [End Page 209] centuries a point of contact and overlap between the Tibetan Buddhist, Chinese, and Islamic worlds, the Qinghai-Gansu Highlands form what historian Alfred Rieber has referred to as a \"complex frontier,\" a zone in which a \"number of state systems and social groups engaged in violent and peaceful intercourse within a broadly conceived geographical space that set restraints and opened possibilities for human action.\"8 North of the Yellow River lies a band of ethnoreligiously mixed but heavily Muslim districts that stretch roughly from Linxia (临夏) in Gansu to Xining. Tibetan Buddhist communities predominate in the towns and villages south of the river and particularly as one travels upward into the grasslands that unfold within the great bend of the Yellow River.\n\nThe CCP's critique of great Han chauvinism was not unique to Han-Muslim relations. However, its application to the Northwest Hui may have been. Uradyn Bulag, a leading scholar of ethnopolitics in China, has argued that by taking for itself the role of \"Good Han\" determined to liberate \"oppressed smaller nations\" from those it deemed \"Bad Han,\" the CCP introduced a \"new Han ethnic sensibility that was self-reflexive and self-critical rather than being simply paternalistic.\" This conceptual shift allowed the CCP to envisage a state that stretched beyond the homogenous nation and \"granted prominent place for non-Han in their political thinking.\"9 It underpinned the CCP's claims of sovereignty in non-Han areas and put the party in a position to offer a progressive alternative to the treatment of minorities and colonial subjects in and by the imperialist West. Put another way, it was a creative but ultimately insufficient mechanism for tackling one of the most vexing problems of twentieth-century nation building: how to fit the ethnocultural diversity of the dynastic state within a nation-state form—to construct majorities and minorities—without resorting to majoritarian ethnocultural violence.\n\nFrom this vantage point, the Qinghai-Gansu Highlands presented a particular challenge to the CCP and its understanding of inter-nationality relations. In this complex frontier, good/bad binaries and \"triadic interaction(s)\" were complicated by additional layers of ethnocultural uncertainty.10 What happens when history's bad guys are not primarily Han? And what if the frontier nature of a region dictates that the singular non-Han be turned into multiple non-Hans? In the Qinghai-Gansu Highlands and surrounding areas, the CCP identified Ma Bufang and his coterie of Hui Muslim \"reactionary\" officers and \"feudal\" landlords, not Han elites, as the principal agents of nationality exploitation and Tibetans as their primary (but not sole) targets. It therefore declared Tibetans to be a priori victims of nationality exploitation, almost irrespective of an individual's class base or previous behavior. This included monastic leaders and hereditary headmen who, with few exceptions, were recruited into the party's United Front (统一战线 Tongyi zhanxian). [End Page 210]\n\nIn \"minority nationality\" regions like Amdo, the United Front primarily referred to a period of indefinite length during which class struggle was to be deemphasized or suspended. Instead, traditional elites were given positions within the new regime, where, using the charismatic authority, local knowledge, and existing relationships afforded by their indigenous status, they were meant to serve as intermediaries between the party-state and their communities. Elsewhere, I have argued that by relying on indirect rule through local elites the party in 1950s Amdo borrowed from traditional imperial practices. Unlike the imperial state, however, which in general was most concerned with maintaining order at minimal cost, the United Front was considered by its CCP advocates to be a \"transformative methodology of state and nation building.\"11\n\nUnited Front principles also were extended to Hui communities. In contrast to Tibetans, however, Hui in China's Northwest occupied a liminal space between victim and oppressor. Regional leaders therefore ordered their soldiers and cadres to separate good Muslims from bad. Yet, because Hui were both traffickers and targets of nationality exploitation, the distinction could not be solely based on class status as it theoretically was in Han rural settings. The need to distinguish good Muslims from bad would be made even more urgent by a string of uprisings that between late 1949 and mid-1953 engulfed several Muslim-majority areas along the Gansu-Qinghai frontier before spilling into the Tibetan- and Mongol-dominated grasslands to their south. Useful echoes can be found in the Qing state's determination during and after its pacification of the nineteenth-century Great Northwestern Rebellions to distinguish \"weed\" Muslims bent on disrupting social order from \"good\" Muslims capable of proving loyal to the state.12 While not unconnected, the CCP's approach to the \"Hui question\" must also be viewed within its own historical moment. It was an expression of a particular practice of minoritization and a framework for conceptualizing the new socialist nation-state that emerged in competition with regional actors and amid a global reckoning over the \"minority question.\"\n\nThe Hui Question Is a Nationality Question\n\n\"Minorities are not automatically minorities.\" Instead, as theorist Gyanendra Pandey has reminded us, they \"are historically constituted.\"13 In recent decades, the Hui have been touted as a \"model minority,\" a successful example of harmonious interethnic relations and the effective application of the CCP's nationalities policies and principles.14 The situation could not have been more different in 1949. Scholars such as Jonathan Lipman have shown that there has long existed in China a tradition of [End Page 211] racializing Muslims as insular, untrustworthy, disloyal, and violent.15 The so-called \"Muslim Rebellions\" of the late nineteenth century, which devastated the Northwest, reinforced among non-Muslims this Muslim reputation for violence while furthering within Muslim communities fear of their Han neighbors and of the state.\n\nDuring the Republican period, debates raged both among Muslim intellectuals and between them and the Han establishment over what type of a community—religious, ethnic, both, or neither—Sino-Muslims embodied, without coming to any real resolution. The Guomindang (GMD) under Chiang Kai-shek generally considered Sino-Muslims to be a religious minority, a view shared by many Muslim elites who saw the distinction as a way \"for achieving integration without assimilation.\"16 By the time Communist armies captured Northwest China in 1949, their leaders—in purposeful contrast to their GMD rivals—had long insisted that the region's Chinese-speaking Muslim population belonged to the larger, singular Hui nationality and that the Hui were one component of a historically constituted and inseparable multi-minzu China.\n\nDespite this conviction, party leaders understood that inter-nationality relations were often scarred by deep divisions and frequent bouts of intercommunity conflict. And they made clear who and what was to blame. Into the late 1950s, the CCP consistently asserted that inter-nationality animus and alienation were first and foremost a legacy of great Han chauvinism, described in a pivotal 1941 CCP study of the \"Hui question\" as \"thinking, principles, and behavior that oppresses weaker nationalities\"; the study's authors added that \"throughout history, it has created within the Hui distrust and hatred for the Han.\"17 Having determined that nationality disunity was principally a product of Han prejudice and exploitation, policy-makers were equally clear about how to cure this malaise. Within the Han majority and especially among Han cadres and soldiers who worked among \"minority\" communities, an all-out effort must be marshaled to eliminate expressions of great nationality chauvinism. Only then would \"local nationalism\" (地方主义 difang zhuyi), a parochial response to Han chauvinism that manifests within non-Han people, gradually disappear so that nationality unity would be secured.\n\nThe CCP first deployed a sustained critique of Han chauvinism while on the western reaches of its famous Long March. In desperate need of supplies and safe passage while [End Page 212] traveling through non-Han regions, the CCP used the critique in an attempt to differentiate its Red Army from the \"bad\" Han actors who had come before. The need to develop a cohesive \"nationalities policy\" arose after the party core reached the relative safety of its northwestern base area. There, earlier flirtations with formulas that allowed for non-Han self-determination hardened into a vision of an indivisible, multi-minzu socialist China. Discursively at first, but eventually with world-altering ramifications, non-Han groups were transformed into minority nationalities within a Han-dominated state.18\n\nBecause of the Communist base area's physical proximity to heavily Muslimpopulated areas and because of its need to compete with both the Japanese and the GMD for non-Han support, the CCP's minzu work during the war years focused heavily on the Hui and (for similar reasons) the Mongols. In spring 1940, cadres at the CCP's newly established Nationality Question Research Office (NQRO; 民族问题研究室 Minzu wenti yanjiushi) produced the first study of a single minzu, \"Outline on the Hui Nationality Question\" (关于回回民族问题的提纲 \"Guanyu Huihui minzu wenti de tigang\"). It was followed a year later by the much longer The Hui Nationality Question (回回民族问题 Huihui minzu wenti). Declaring that \"the Hui question is a nationality question,\" the two documents sought to settle any lingering intraparty confusion over whether or not the Hui constituted a discrete minzu. In his study of the CCP's post-1949 nationality classification project in southwest China, historian Thomas Mullaney showed that language was the core \"ethnotaxonomic\" indicator by which minzu status was to be determined.19 Somewhat remarkably, in the case of the Chinese-speaking Hui the principal marker was religion. The NRQO insisted that the Hui \"gradually had become a minzu\" in direct response to centuries-long discrimination committed against Islam and its adherents. Even while acknowledging that Islam was a barrier to both class and nationality consciousness, the authors argued that it was not \"simply a religious belief.\" Instead, Islam was the fabric that knitted together Hui society and the \"sacred banner that unites them in their struggle\" against nationality oppression. They warned that to suggest otherwise would play into the hands of the \"Japanese invaders\" who were promising to sponsor an independent Muslim state (大回回国 Da Huihuiguo) in Northwest China.20\n\nEven when the nation-state champions \"the idea of co-existence, in the form of tolerance, of unity in diversity,\" Pandey has written, \"groups and communities are placed not only next to, but also on top of and underneath, one another.\"21 Although the party leadership declared the equality of all of China's minzu, the materialist, evolutionary, and inherently Han-chauvinistic model to which the CCP subscribed produced a second paradox. After 1949, the CCP would position the Han and a couple of other highly assimilated minzu at higher stages of socioeconomic development while distributing dozens of other [End Page 213] minoritized groups at various points below.22 As a \"relatively economically and culturally advanced minzu,\" the Hui would receive something of an upper-middling status.23 The work of the NQRO shows that by 1940 a minzu hierarchy was already emerging. For instance, a parallel study declared Mongols to be a \"backward nationality\" that had fallen under the \"poisonous\" grip of \"Lamaism.\"24 Although the NQRO noted that \"the Hui have yet to develop into a modern nationality,\" it also admitted that they had \"come under the influence of the relatively advanced Han.\" This proximity had exposed Hui to the particularly \"brutal exploitation of Han chauvinism\" but also to a comparatively high degree of \"Sinicization\" (汉化 Hanhua). According to the NQRO, the former was a type of \"human coercion\" that produced in many Hui an acute \"hatred\" for the Han. On the other hand, it considered Sinicization to be a \"natural process\" of development.25\n\nFor party elites, these contradictions helped offer an explanation for how and why Sino-Muslims in the Northwest were able to seize power after the fall of the Qing and also to replace Han regionally in the nationality-exploitation pecking order.26 According to Bulag, the relational logic of the CCP's ethnopolitics demanded that \"nationalism is just if it opposes imperialist oppression but it becomes imperialistic if it serves to oppress a weaker nation.\"27 In areas under Muslim rule, \"Hui chauvinisms\" (回族主义 Huizu zhuyi) now oppressed other minzu, including Han, Mongols, Turkic-speaking Salar, and \"especially Qinghai's Tibetans,\" who were considered by the party to be particularly backward. At the same time, it helped explain why the Hui masses remained devoted to Islam, to their Islamic leadership, and to the Ma clans, each of which was viewed by their communities as bulwarks against Han chauvinism. CCP officials reasoned that in reality the Hui masses were being exploited alongside other minzu for the benefit of the new Hui ruling class.28 The challenge was to convince ordinary Hui that the Red Army, later to be renamed the PLA, was not a \"bad\" Han army—like those that had laid waste to the region in past decades and centuries—but \"a good friend\" and \"savior\" of its \"Hui compatriots.\"29\n\nLiberator and Savior of the Hui People\n\nOn May 23, 1949, the city of Xi'an, gateway to the Northwest, fell to Communist forces. Days later, the PLA's First Field Army under General Peng Dehuai (彭德怀) [End Page 214] was tasked with \"liberating\" Northwest China by year's end.30 To meet this target, the party would need to attract support from Muslim communities or at least to sever their ties to the Ma regimes of the Northwest.\n\nA week before Xi'an's capture, the CCP's Northwest Bureau released a Hui Work Manual (回民工作手册 Huimin gongzuo shouce) and a much shorter primer, Concise Hui Work Manual (回回工作间要手册 Huihui gongzuo jianyao shouce).31 The latter was a handbook distributed to \"ordinary work comrades sent into Hui areas\" to instruct them on how to be a good Communist—or, in Bulag's formulation, how to be \"Good Han.\" It noted that both sectarian and class divisions had long existed among the Northwest Hui. However, the insular and parochial qualities of their religion, customs, and shared heritage had fostered certain \"nationality traits,\" said the manual, and \"relatively prominent among them is their sense of solidarity, martial nature, and spirit of sacrifice.\" The handbook explained that this allowed Hui to set aside internal divisions when confronted by outsiders and made it \"unusually easy\" for the ruling class to use ordinary Hui as instruments of nationality exploitation against their non-Muslim neighbors.32\n\nOne way to disrupt these solidarities, which from the party's viewpoint were fundamentally rooted in resistance to Han chauvinism, was to model new, good behavior. The handbook noted that many Hui did not understand the party's nationalities policies nor did they trust its representatives to respect local traditions and beliefs. Standing orders since at least the days of the Long March demanded that soldiers and cadres working within Muslim communities observe the \"three great prohibitions\" (三大禁条 sanda jintiao): no billeting soldiers within mosques, no eating pork, and no defacing the Koran.33 The handbook provided a more comprehensive list of \"Hui customs and important taboos\" for its soldiers and cadres to heed. These included rules against drinking liquor or consuming anything prepared by a non-Muslim; the handbook emphasized that Hui \"do not even drink tea brewed by a person outside the faith.\" It also briefly outlined the Ramadan fasting traditions, Islamic hygienic practices, and what it referred to as the \"extremely feudal and conservative\" gender relations among the Hui. Protections were extended to Islamic institutions. The handbook instructed cadres to safeguard mosques and mazar (Sufi shrines; 拱北 gongbei), and it forbade smoking and singing within their walls and hanging signs (presumably revolutionary slogans or instructions) on their exteriors. It also required permission be requested from the imam before \"mass work\" was implemented in a community.34 All of this was meant to assuage Muslim fears by demonstrating that the Communists were a different type of Han than those they had known in the past.\n\nThe battle for Gansu began in late July. By the second half of August, Communist armies were descending upon their two main prizes, Lanzhou and Linxia. Referred to by Peng Dehuai and other PLA commanders as the \"Ma bandits' lair\" (马匪老巢 Mafei [End Page 215] laochao), Linxia was the birthplace of the Ma clans and a center of Islam already known to outsiders as \"the Mecca of China\" and \"Northwest China's Muslim Holy Land.\"35 Not only were Hui-Han relations in Linxia thought to be particularly strained, but military leaders presumed that reverberations from the PLA's conduct in Linxia, good or bad, would ripple throughout the Northwest.36 As his soldiers prepared their assault, First Army Corps commander Wang Zhen (王震) exhorted them to remember, \"We are not the savage, plundering, and vengeful [Han] armies of the past that conquered the West and pacified the Hui. … We are the People's Liberation Army led by the Chinese Communist Party. We must provide proof so that the Hui can see that the PLA truly is the liberator and savior of the Hui people.\"37\n\nA primary component of this \"proof\" was to be \"preferential treatment\" (优待 youdai) given to captured Hui soldiers. Along with standard rules not to kill, beat, humiliate, or steal from prisoners, PLA leaders insisted that Hui captives be addressed as \"Hui brother or Muslim brother\" rather than by commonly used slurs and, tellingly, that pork not be used to \"intentionally torment\" them. They also required that Muslims be allowed to perform daily prayers and other religious practices and be provided access to Islamic burial rites performed by an imam.38 Most importantly, commanders ordered their soldiers to follow a procedure Peng referred to as \"catch and release\" (抓即放 zhua ji fang).39 This meant that \"after a brief period of education\" rank-and-file Hui captives should be given \"travel funds\" (路费 lufei) and sent home.40 Enemy officers below the company level were also to be released, but only after being \"personally hosted\" for propaganda by a suitably ranked PLA officer or political commissar. While more senior Hui officers were to remain in custody, PLA commanders promised that after the capture of Xining even they would be sent for reeducation and then \"quickly set free.\"41\n\nThis \"special treatment\" was designed to counter stories circulating within Muslim communities that the Communists routinely \"kill Muslims and destroy mosques,\" \"conscript men as porters and force women to visit the soldiers,\" engage in practices of sharing \"communal wives and communal property,\" and so forth.42 A military report predicted that both while on the road and after returning to their villages, these freed soldiers would [End Page 216] serve as living proof that the rumors were untrue.43 Peng insisted that \"catch and release\" helped facilitate the capture of a string of towns en route to Linxia. And when PLA soldiers entered the city on August 23, he reported that Linxia's Han and Hui inhabitants both filled the streets to boisterously greet the liberators.44\n\nEnemies and Friends\n\nThe surrender first of Linxia and then, a few days later, of Lanzhou cast a pall over Xining. An eyewitness recalled that panic filled the streets as those with money or position scrambled to stash their wealth or plot escape.45 On August 27, PLA forces crossed from Linxia into Qinghai's Xunhua (循化) County. In 1936–1937, the previous time Communist troops had set foot in Qinghai, Ma Bufang's forces had nearly wiped out the Communists' West Route Army. This time PLA divisions moved speedily along two fronts, seizing town after town before converging on Xining a week later. Instead of encountering heavy resistance from resolute, anti-Communist Muslim fighters, as was being contemporaneously predicted by US intelligence, along the way PLA units reported accepting the surrender of almost 2,000 enemy soldiers, including 18 generals and dozens of high-ranking officers. According to contemporary accounts in the CCP-run media, as the main body approached the city on September 6, Han, Hui, and Tibetan residents gathered outside the city gates and lined its streets to \"eagerly await\" the PLA.46\n\nDespite the relative ease with which Xining was captured, party and military leaders anticipated difficulty consolidating control over the province. At an agricultural conference in Xining, Peng Dehuai asked delegates, \"How do we unify the multinationality region of Qinghai?\" Not only was Qinghai vast, sparsely populated, demographically complex, and economically underdeveloped, but the CCP lacked even a rudimentary preexisting party organization there and had \"no United Front relationships\" upon which they might rely.47 Peng answered his rhetorical question in orthodox Maoist fashion by stating, \"First we must distinguish enemies from friends.\" This, he explained, meant differentiating \"the small minority of bad elements within each nationality\" from the \"vast majority of good people within each nationality.\"48\n\nPeng's approach was in line with the party's overall strategy in ethnic minority areas in which cadres were ordered to form \"a broad-based United Front by winning over and uniting with all local nationality and religious elites who can be united.\"49 The [End Page 217] United Front is a concept developed under Vladimir Lenin that allows Communist parties to ally on a temporary basis with non-Communists in order to advance socialist revolution. In China, the concept is most often associated with the two United Fronts struck between the GMD and the CCP in the years prior to 1949. By the end of the Chinese Civil War, as Lyman van Slyke explained, \"its function was changing from the isolation of an enemy to the integration of the people in support of the new regime.\"50 This task was considered particularly essential in places like the Qinghai-Gansu Highlands, where \"patriotic consciousness\" seemed particularly weak and where it was assumed that the traditional authority of indigenous elites was especially strong. The party's Northwest Bureau explained that, although \"these upper strata elements\" were members of the exploiting class, within local communities they were \"seen as heroes. The reason is simple: it is because, under the rule of Han chauvinism in the past, they played the leading role in opposing nationality exploitation.\"51 Employing the example of a hypothetical Tibetan lama, Peng clarified that the party was \"using the lama as a bridge.\" It might take three, five, or even ten years of patient work, Peng warned, but eventually this bridge could be used to reach the masses.52\n\nPeng had insisted that \"bad elements\" existed within each minzu. In practice, however, with few exceptions, the CCP leadership viewed Tibetan and Mongol religious elites and secular headmen to be victims of nationality exploitation and therefore targets to be won over through political means. The Hui presented a more complex problem. At the national level, party leaders blamed Han chauvinism for the inter-minzu estrangement that plagued China's ethnocultural frontiers. Regionally, however, Qinghai's Party Committee explained that the Hui \"have been the ruling nationality for a relatively long period of time.\" Party leaders concluded that from this perch Hui had oppressed other minzu, especially more \"backward\" groups like Mongols, Tu (土族 Monguor), and Tibetans.53\n\nFor this reason, as their forces bore down on the Qinghai-Gansu Highlands, party and military leaders had predicted that Tibetans and other exploited nationality groups would welcome the Communists as liberators. On the other hand, they expected many Muslims to view the PLA as a Han army intent on reversing the region's ethnopolitical order. These assumptions, which were surely colored by long-held stereotypes about Muslim belligerence and disloyalty, seemed to be proven correct in Xunhua County. In anticipation of the PLA's arrival, many among the area's Muslim Salar majority fled into the hills or followed their leaders across the Yellow River, where they formed an anti-CCP militia. In contrast, members of the county's sizable Tibetan minority, including all of its local leaders, are said to have welcomed the Communist soldiers with gifts of cattle and sheep.54\n\nIn fact, despite the celebrations that accompanied the PLA's \"liberation\" of the Northwest, party leaders remained acutely concerned about Muslim loyalties. For instance, [End Page 218] a month after its capture, Peng Dehuai cautioned, \"The Linxia problem is not yet fully resolved.\" He warned that more than 10,000 armed militiamen were still at large and that many Hui remained anxious over the CCP's intentions and worried that local Han would seek to punish their Hui neighbors for past misdeeds.55 Across the provincial border, a major source of concern was the estimated 50,000 mostly Muslim soldiers who had served under Ma Bufang. Several thousand had been captured or surrendered during the PLA's drive toward Xining and mop-up campaigns in surrounding districts. After a \"short period of reeducation,\" they were to be sent home \"to engage in production.\"56 While a large portion of the remainder had simply disbanded, Peng warned that thousands of enemy troops were regrouping in the grasslands west of Xining or in the mountains separating Linxia from Qinghai. Party leaders feared that an additional unknown number had melted into towns and villages to engage in sabotage. The rest were considered potential targets for anti-CCP propaganda spread by their former comrades.57 Even while warning that threats remained from \"rumormongering, agitation, and sabotage,\" Qinghai's Party Committee also reminded its soldiers and cadres that, although Hui had been perpetrators of nationality chauvinism, the majority were simultaneously victims of class exploitation. Reasoning that \"nationality prejudices cannot be eliminated overnight,\" the provincial leadership ordered its agents not to be \"influenced by the backward ideas of other nationalities\" who allegedly looked to turn the new political situation to their advantage by transforming efforts to root out a small number of \"bandits and spies\" into a broader \"anti-Hui struggle.\"58\n\nThe Bandit Problem Is Inseparable from the Nationality Question\n\nThe CCP's efforts at inter-minzu rapprochement took visible form during the first weeks of 1950 when prominent members of Qinghai's various ethnic communities gathered in Xining for a Unity and Friendship Conference. After five days of speeches and resolutions, army chief Liao Hansheng (廖汉生) closed the proceedings by declaring the conference proof that \"Qinghai's seven nationalities are not divided by language, place, belief, or customs, … they are like brothers in an intimate and harmonious family.\"59\n\nIt doubtlessly was not lost on those in attendance that Liao's appeal to inter-nationality fraternalism did not reflect conditions throughout much of the region. Liao had admitted as much in a report he had delivered not two weeks earlier. In it, he asserted that 2,713 [End Page 219] \"bandits\" (土匪 tufei), a label the CCP used to describe domestic armed resistance, had either voluntarily turned themselves in or had been captured, wounded, or killed by security forces during October and November.60 In Gansu, security officials admitted that \"waves of unrest\" in the Linxia region had left more than 1,000 Han and Hui dead or injured in a series of revenge killings (汉回仇杀Han Hui chousha).61 Most troubling for party leaders, on November 30, over 300 \"armed rebels\" had launched an attack on government offices in Qinghai's Huangzhong (湟中) County. Then, on December 5, more than 1,700 men wearing white caps and red armbands—identifying the mutineers both as Muslims and as members of Ma Bufang's Eighth Cavalry Regiment—seized two townships in Datong (大同), a county adjacent to Xining. This was quickly followed by uprisings in Xunhua, Menyuan (门源), and Hualong (华隆) Counties in Qinghai and in several areas of the greater Linxia region and beyond in Gansu. In early January, Liao announced that more than 1,900 of these \"bandits had been eliminated [歼匪 jianfei]\" (referring to casualties as well as those captured and those who surrendered) and that the purported ringleader, a former Ma Bufang general named Ma Ying (马英), had been shot dead.62 The battle had not been completely one-sided, however. In Datong alone, security forces reported suffering 388 casualties, including 107 killed in action and another 55 unaccounted for.63\n\nUnbeknownst to Liao and his colleagues, these were the first in a series of linked uprisings that would come to an end only after several years, 98 \"bandit extermination campaigns,\" and more than 1,400 PLA fatalities in Qinghai alone.64 Yet, the first point of instruction delivered by army leadership cautioned a degree of restraint. While the sources make clear—occasionally explicitly but more often implicitly—that the rebels were largely Muslims, it demanded soldiers and cadres remember that the conflict \"absolutely is not a 'Hui rebellion'\" (绝非\"回族 造反\" juefei \"Huizu zaofan\").65 A report that referred to the revolt in Datong as the \"Datong Hui Rebellion\" even had a correction appended that reminded readers of the orders of the Qinghai party secretary, Zhang Zhongliang (张仲良): \"It is completely inappropriate to consider this a Hui rebellion.\"66\n\nThe proclamation by Zhang and other regional leaders that the unrest was something other than a \"Hui rebellion\" was a message to their cadres and soldiers not to succumb to old prejudices. It was also meant to reassure both Han and Muslim residents of the Northwest that there would not be a repeat of the intercommunity and state violence of the late Qing—world-shattering events that were well within living memory. But if not [End Page 220] a Hui rebellion, what was it? According to reports out of both Datong and Menyuan, the uprising was \"no accident.\" It was \"a large, organized, and planned conspiracy\" launched by a cabal of senior military leaders and officials of Ma Bufang's regime who hoped to use Muslim fears that \"the Han had seized power\" to reinstall the old order.67 Peng Dehuai reminded his mostly Han soldiers that Ma was no more a representative of the Hui than Chiang Kai-shek was of the Han, adding, \"It would be a huge mistake if Han were to conflate Ma Bufang with the Hui people and feel that the Hui people are the enemy of the Han or that the Han people are the enemy of the Hui.\"68 In other words, at its core the uprising should be treated not as a nationality struggle but as a last-ditch effort by a small number of class enemies who, in order to reverse the revolution, had manipulated \"the hatred of narrow nationalism that great Han chauvinism had created.\"69\n\nYet regional leaders did not direct all of their blame outward. Acknowledging that \"the bandit problem is inseparable from our handling of the nationality question,\" contemporary reports are rife with admonishments urging cadres and soldiers to correct \"shortcomings,\" \"mistakes,\" and \"prejudices.\" The example most often cited was the bloodletting in Linxia. The \"Linxia incident\" had been sparked by the death of five Hui while in custody. However, this had come amid complaints over the near exclusion of Hui from positions within government and the local militia and over \"bandit suppression\" operations that officials acknowledged had \"indiscriminately\" targeted local Muslims. As a result, an aphorism was spreading through Muslim communities: under the Communists \"Han become officials, Hui become prisoners.\"70 Even worse, \"leading cadres\" had turned a blind eye to Han calls to \"annihilate the Hui\" while ordering firearms be confiscated from \"terrorized\" Muslims, leading to rumors that authorities were \"taking Hui guns to arm the Han.\"71\n\nThe party's conduct in China's \"Little Mecca\" had been anything but the shining example demanded by Peng Dehuai. Nor were these types of \"shortcomings\" and \"mistakes\" limited to Linxia. For instance, in the spring of 1950, \"a large-scale bloody incident of an ethnic nature\" in Pingliang (平凉) was blamed on gratuitous acts of \"great nationality chauvinism\" committed by Han cadres and soldiers. This again included the exclusion of Hui from positions in government as well as a general disregard for Hui customs and religion that had led some soldiers to cook pork in Muslim homes and to the near-disinterment of the tomb of a Sufi lineage founder.72 [End Page 221]\n\nElsewhere, the Northwest Bureau admitted that Ma Yuanxiang (马元祥), another of Ma Bufang's former generals, had been released after eight months of political reeducation only to find that security forces had captured and killed his son, father, and nephew. Fearing for his own life, Ma donned a disguise and fled south into Amdo's southern grasslands, where he launched a major anti-CCP insurgency.73 In other words, the distrust, discrimination, and ill treatment of Muslims by the CCP and PLA were both causes and consequences of the mistaken idea that this was in fact a \"Hui rebellion.\"\n\nThe Benefits of Backwardness\n\nAs had been all too common with Qing armies of the previous century, security forces across the Northwest were proving unwilling or unable to distinguish \"good\" muslims from \"bad.\" By early summer 1950, as many as 50,000 Hui from across the Northwest were reported to have fled to Inner Mongolia.74 Recognizing the damage anti-Hui transgressions were having on efforts to pacify the region and construct the new state, Qinghai's Party Committee asserted that if nationality policies were correctly enacted \"there would be no bandits.\"75 Yet as long as pockets of rebellion existed, it admitted that full implementation of those policies would be impossible. To break this cycle, regional leaders again reasoned that its operatives needed to distinguish the vast majority of good Hui from the \"small number of reactionaries\" in their midst.76 This did not simply mean weeding out those who had joined uprisings from those who had not. Because Han chauvinism was considered the root cause of rebellion, it also meant separating the rank-and-file and even mid-level insurgents from the \"bandits, spies, and local tyrants\" who had used narrow nationalism to either press or trick ordinary Muslims into taking part. While the latter were to be eliminated \"militarily,\" party leaders repeatedly insisted that the former be won over \"politically\" through promises of clemency and the promotion of the party's core nationality policies of political autonomy, freedom of religious belief, and economic development.77\n\nLike all other undertakings during these earliest years of CCP rule, out of necessity this outreach would need to be conducted \"from top to bottom.\" Instructions emphasized the importance of recruiting influential members of the \"Hui gentry\" and especially Islamic leaders who could serve as bridges to the masses.78 For instance, a report out of Ledu (乐都) County noted approvingly that an imam and two village elders had defused a riotous situation by reading aloud the government's policy of leniency and by acting [End Page 222] as guarantors that the state would abide by its promises.79 In addition to weakening the insurgency, this United Front approach offered the CCP the opportunity to demonstrate that it was not targeting Muslims but those allies of the Ma Bufang regime who had been most exploitative and now hoped to restore the old order.\n\nIn October 1950, Qinghai's governor announced that security forces had inflicted 2,215 casualties, taken 2,283 prisoners, and accepted the surrender of almost 30,000 suspected rebels. Yet \"diehard enemies\" of the new regime had not given up. Officials warned that \"evil and unrepentant bandits and spies\" had slipped into \"pastoral areas and border regions.\" There, under the alleged orders of GMD leaders in Taiwan, they were forming counterrevolutionary organizations and plotting to launch \"guerrilla war behind enemy lines.\"80 These areas were mainly inhabited by Tibetans and Mongols, and in several cases the mostly Muslim insurgents would find sanctuary with and forge alliances among those deemed by the party to be the foremost victims of Hui nationality oppression.\n\nThe easiest explanation might have been that class interests were proving more resilient than nationality cleavages, and there is some evidence of initial support within the local leadership for this position. For instance, one military report claimed that \"a small number of Hui and Tibetan upper strata reactionary elements\" colluded to use the economic resources of monastic landholdings to support their insurgency.81 Far more commonly, however, party leaders cast Tibetan and Mongol elites not as class enemies but as \"hoodwinked\" victims of their Muslim coconspirators' manipulation. Secretary Zhang admitted that most of the Han cadres dispatched beyond the agricultural districts that surround Xining did not understand local conditions and had little relevant experience. He explained that this provided an opening for Hui rebels who used \"this vast area's relative backwardness and our difficulties\" to compete for the crucial support of local Tibetan and Mongol leaders.82 In reality, figures like Ma Yuanxiang, who had served lengthy deployments in the Amdo grasslands, had far longer and deeper relationships with a host of the region's prominent Tibetan and Mongol figures than did the recently arrived CCP.\n\nWhile Zhang beseeched his cadres \"to strengthen our contacts with the upper strata of each nationality,\"83 Shérap Gyatso (in Tibetan, shes rab rgya mtsho; 喜绕嘉措 Xirao Jiacuo)—the great Buddhist scholar and educator, now Qinghai's vice governor—appealed directly to the region's Tibetan and Mongol leaderships. In an October 1950 speech, he noted that \"remnant bandits and spies\" had fled into the grasslands, where they \"use the weakness of the revolutionary government … and the cultural backwardness of Mongol and Tibetan compatriots\" to ferment and sustain rebellion. Citing three exemplars who had reported bandit activity to the government or used their own forces to \"quickly hunt down and drive out\" the enemy, Shérap Gyatso implored, \"I hope the [Mongol] nobility and [Tibetan] chieftains of each area will lead the people under them to stand against and eliminate the bandits and spies.\"84 [End Page 223]\n\nThe first of the three figures to receive Shérap Gyatso's commendation was the powerful leader of the Tibetan Nangra (snang ra; 昂拉 Angla) chiefdom, Wangchen Döndrup (dbang chen don grub; 项谦 Xiangqian). In praising the Nangra headman, Shérap Gyatso was almost certainly referring to an August meeting in Xining in which Wangchen Döndrup had pledged to end ongoing flirtations with insurgents who were increasingly finding refuge in his wooded, mountainous, and defensible home region, which lay along the south bank of the Yellow River. Yet, Wangchen Döndrup was not in Xining to receive Shérap Gyatso's acknowledgment in October. By then, he had begun to stockpile weapons and fortify roads into Nangra. In November 1950, he openly broke with the CCP, joining Hui rebels to launch what has been called \"Qinghai's longest and most influential rebellion of the early Liberation period.\"85\n\nDespite the seriousness of the situation, or perhaps because of it, party and military leaders treated this threat differently than they had the string of uprisings north of the river. Instead of launching an immediate military assault on Nangra—dubbed by its defenders Qinghai's \"Little Taiwan\"—the regional leadership, over a span of 18 months, dispatched 17 separate high-level delegations aimed at negotiating a \"political\" solution to the insurrection. This was in spite of Wangchen Döndrup's own complicated relationship with Ma Bufang—a violent dispute in the 1930s between Wangchen Döndrup and Ma had ended with an oath of brotherhood—and the seriousness of his alleged offenses, which included the killings of cadres and soldiers.86 An open letter signed by Qinghai's senior leadership explained the party's position. It read, \"Mr. Wangchen, considering your crimes, you already should have been punished according to state law, but the people's government believes that you have been hoodwinked by outside spies and bandits.\" It promised that if Wangchen Döndrup were to break with his Hui allies and \"return to the people,\" the government would guarantee his personal safety, protect his wealth, and reaffirm his traditional position atop the Nangra chiefdom.87\n\nThese overtures proved unsuccessful. Finally, in early April 1952, having secured at least outward approval from many of Amdo's important Tibetan monastic leaders and hereditary chieftains, the PLA launched a massive assault on the Nangra region. Qinghai's \"Little Taiwan\" fell within days. Even then, occupying soldiers were ordered to distinguish the mostly Muslim \"outside bandits and spies\" from hoodwinked Tibetans. Officers instructed their men to protect monasteries and promised Tibetan headmen and lamas that, if they surrendered, they would escape punishment and their wealth and status would be safeguarded.88 The pledge was even extended to Wangchen Döndrup, who had escaped the initial attack by fleeing into the mountains. Upon his surrender three months later, Wangchen Döndrup was appointed to leadership positions in the soon-to-be-created [End Page 224] Jianzha (尖扎) Tibetan Autonomous County and vice chairman of the Huangnan (黄南) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. In August, an editorial appeared in the Qinghai Daily in which Wangchen Döndrup expressed his \"gratitude after returning to the people.\"89 His Muslim allies were not accorded the same opportunity.\n\nIn part, the CCP's extraordinary effort to woo Wangchen Döndrup amounted to a time-tested divide-and-conquer strategy meant to weaken the insurgency by playing members of one minzu against another. However, it was also a function of the CCP's underlying assumptions about nationality relations in Northwest China. The unspoken supposition was that, by virtue of their nationality identity, Tibetan and Mongol elites could not be bandits and spies. At worst, they were hoodwinked headmen, victims of both \"cultural backwardness\" and nationality exploitation.\n\nIn his Qinghai Daily editorial, Wangchen Döndrup leaned into this discourse. He claimed that his own \"backwardness\" had left him susceptible to the lies and bribes of the \"Ma bandit gang.\"90 Yet the longtime Nangra headman was hardly some country rube. By 1949, Wangchen Döndrup had two decades of experience navigating Amdo's complex frontier dynamics, including, it seems, forging relationships with some of the men who later found refuge in Nangra. He was no more a hoodwinked headman than were many of his counterparts who made the opposite but also calculated choice of siding with the new regime against the mostly Muslim insurgents. In the 1930s, Wangchen Döndrup had parlayed his position into a loose alliance with Ma Bufang. Following the Nangra Rebellion, he belatedly took advantage of the CCP's United Front strategy of befriending nearly any amenable elite Tibetan figure to once again secure his status and protect his community.\n\nMuslim elites did not have the same benefit of backwardness. The rise of Muslim power in the Northwest during the last decades of the Qing Empire and the routinization of that authority in the years after its collapse created a complex web of power relationships that did not comport to the CCP's diagnosis of nationality disunity. Because it engendered local nationalism among the Hui, party leaders still considered great Han chauvinism to be the ultimate culprit. Yet proximity to the Han meant that the Hui had developed into a relatively advanced minzu. This allowed for the seizure of power by the Ma clans, who used the historical antagonism between Han and Hui to solidify support among ordinary Muslims. For party leaders, the solution was to demonstrate to Muslim communities that the CCP was not the \"bad\" Han of the past and that their purported loyalty to the Mas was misplaced—to convince the vast majority of Northwest Muslims that they had been tricked into supporting an exploitative regime. This did not mean that all Hui elites were considered enemies. But it did mean that the line between enemy and friend was more muddled than among the more \"backward\" Tibetans.\n\nIt also meant that Hui elites were not afforded the same protections as their Tibetan and Mongol counterparts. The initial era of open rebellion ended in spring 1953 when Ma Yuanxiang was hunted down and killed in the grasslands of southern Amdo. Not long afterward, when Qinghai's administrative units were largely finalized, only two were designated Hui autonomous counties. According to Susette Cooke, this decision was \"no [End Page 225] doubt due to mistrust of residual Ma regime influence.\"91Although the United Front mostly shielded Tibetan and Mongol headmen and religious institutions from socialist reforms prior to 1958, land reform and collectivization drives were conducted within Muslim communities. In Linxia, for instance, the state confiscated not only the large landholdings of the Ma families and other wealthy Hui but also the substantial properties of mosques and Sufi shrines.92 In Gannan (甘南) Prefecture, land reform was implemented within Han and Hui communities but not Tibetan ones.93\n\nConclusion\n\nContemplating contemporary horrors in Xinjiang, the pseudonymous political theorist Ye hui wrote, \"The impossible task of the nation-state is to define permanent difference and rule it to its extinction.\"94 Even when accompanied by pledges of equality and pluralism, processes of majoritization and minoritization, definitive parts of any act of nation making, are necessarily accompanied by violence of differing sorts and degrees. In the PRC, the CCP's salvational mission to liberate \"oppressed smaller nations\" was—and remains—interwoven with a civilizing mission that by its very nature is deeply \"Han chauvinistic.\"95 As elsewhere, this has left minoritized people vulnerable to what Janet Klein—a historian of the Ottoman Empire and its successor states—has called \"that unique brand of repression and mass violence … when minorities—now conceived as such—came to be regarded as threats to the territorial integrity of the 'nation' and to the imagined privilege and power of the dominant … group.\"96\n\nIn China, majoritarian-state violence was given legitimacy during 1957's Anti-Rightist campaign when the causal link between great nationality chauvinism and local nationalism was suddenly severed. Rather than seeing local nationalism as a product of Han exploitation, party leaders redefined it as an independent, dangerous, and even treasonous political deviancy bent on sabotaging socialism or dividing the nation. Senior leaders overseeing China's nationalities affairs, such as Wang Feng (汪峰), even began [End Page 226] to suggest that some Hui were plotting to establish an independent country (回族斯坦 Huizu sitan or 回回国 Huihuiguo).97\n\nThe period of the United Front had come to an end. In 1958, in response to a combination of ethnoreligious repression, food shortages, and orders to rapidly collectivize pastoral areas during the Great Leap Forward, rebellion once again engulfed many \"minority\" communities across China's Northwest: Hui, Tibetan, Mongol, Salar, and others. This time, in contrast to the early 1950s, security forces were unleashed with little restraint. No exemption was given for victims of nationality oppression, and no distinction was made between Muslims and other rebels. In Xunhua, for instance, thousands of Salar and Tibetans were killed or arrested after PLA reinforcements lifted a three-day, multiethnic siege of the county seat.98 In Linxia, unconfirmed reports suggested that security forces killed 10,000 Muslims and detained another 14,000. Across the region, mosques and shrines that were not demolished were shuttered and often turned to secular use. Imams and other religious leaders were jailed and publicly denounced, and public religious life was all but proscribed. In at least some cases, men were forced to cut their beards and women were unveiled, halal dining halls were abolished, and Muslims were made to raise pigs.99 Members of Tibetan communities became victims of similar if not greater levels of cultural destruction, dislocation, incarceration, and death. Wangchen Döndrup was among them. Like many of his contemporaries, the Nangra headman was quickly arrested. He died not long afterward, officially of an unspecified illness.100\n\n\"In its very efforts to recognize 'the minority minzu' as distinct categories and build an inclusive, progressive nation,\" Ye Hui has written, the CCP \"reproduced the hierarchical distinction between the self and the Other, the majority and minority\" that validates state violence against non-Han people.101 The CCP's self-reflexive critique of Han chauvinism had been an innovative and arguably empathetic attempt to perform the tricky task of transforming the multiethnic empire into a bounded Han-majority nation-state without resorting to the racialized violence it criticized in the West. However, this was premised on the notion that the agents of nationality oppression were Han and that those it deemed to be minorities needed saving. In China's Northwest, where for decades the ethnopolitical hierarchy had been inverted, the CCP found itself determining which Muslims deserved rehabilitation and which required elimination. As had their imperial forebears, CCP leaders discovered that the distinction was not always easy to make. [End Page 227]\n\nMore research is needed on the experience of Northwest Hui in the 1950s and how it may have differed from that of their non-Muslim neighbors. However, the sudden shift from an ethnopolitical framework that loudly proclaimed Han chauvinism to be the primary threat to nationality unity to one that targeted local nationalisms flattened the ethnopolitical playing field. In effect, the category \"Bad Han\" had been eliminated. Now any critique of Han chauvinism or demands for minority particularism made by a non-Han actor placed them in the singular, newly expanded category of \"bad minority.\"102\n\nAcross China, attacks on ethnocultural difference reached their height during the first stages of the Cultural Revolution. The death of Mao in 1976 and the subsequent repudiation of the Cultural Revolution by his successors was accompanied by a renewed criticism of Han chauvinism (now recast as an expression of ultraleftism) for the damage it had done to inter-nationality relations, opening within non-Han communities' real but still limited and uneven opportunities for ethnocultural revival and reinvention. In some cases, Hui have been better positioned to take advantage of these opportunities than have others.\n\nStill, Hui Muslims occupy an awkward ethnopolitical position in post-Mao China. On the one hand, as a loosely connected, relatively well-integrated, Chinese-speaking minzu without obvious transnational linkages or recent histories of open anti-state activity, they have been recast as a \"model minority,\" particularly in contrast to Tibetans, Uyghurs, and other more \"problematic\" ethnic communities. On the other hand, long-term mutual suspicion born in part from communal memory of the history of Han-Muslim violence has been elevated in recent years by a resurgence of Han ethnonationalism and by twenty-firstcentury Islamophobia, both of which are intertwined with the state's campaigns against \"terrorism\" and \"religious extremism.\"103 Simply put, Hui Muslims continue to operate amid good/bad dichotomies. They have to prove their loyalty to the nation in ways the \"unmarked\" majority does not.104\n\nThe terminologies have changed. However, under Xi Jinping the CCP again has come to embrace what was once called \"Han chauvinism\" while attacking expressions of ethnocultural difference in ways that echo earlier criticisms of \"local nationalism.\" Historian and analyst James Leibold has referred to the emergence of a \"new virulent form of cultural nationalism that pathologizes dissent and diversity as an existential threat to the party and the nation.\"105 This phenomenon has been most visibly manifest in the regime of surveillance, incarceration, and forced labor that has descended upon Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, including some Hui. But it also can be seen in the erosion of minority cultural and religious rights across China, including what appears to be the end of \"bilingual education,\" limitations on preferential policies in family planning and university admission, and the so-called \"Sinicization of religion\" (宗教中国化 zongjiao Zhongguohua). Among other challenges, for Hui this has meant the closure of centers of Islamic teaching and publishing, renewed obstacles for hajj pilgrimage, the removal of Arabic-lettered signs from public view, and most viscerally the demolition of \"Arab-style\" domes and minarets on mosques, including those in both Linxia and Xining. [End Page 228]\n\nWhy? Few observers view Sino-Muslims as having separatist agendas or as genuine threats to China's security. Instead, it seems to be part of the current regime's more general fixation on \"homogeniz[ing] Chinese culture to make all parts conform to a party-led nationalism and to use the full force of the state to control any dissenting voices.\"106 Left to be determined is whether this return to explicit (if unidentified as such) Han chauvinism will generate greater identification with and integration into the Chinese nation or whether, as an earlier generation of party leaders predicted, it will strengthen pan-Hui or pan-Islamic identity, intensify resentment of the Han majority, and sharpen the alienation of Muslim communities from the state."
