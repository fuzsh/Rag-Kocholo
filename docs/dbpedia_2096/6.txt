Campaign to Suppress Bandits in the Border Region of the Hubei-Hunan-Sichuan (湘鄂川边剿匪) was a counter-guerrilla/counterinsurgency campaign that the Communists fought against the Kuomintang guerrilla left behind after the nationalist government withdrew from mainland China. The campaign was actually fought after the Chinese Civil War was declared over by the PRC in Beijing a year earlier, and took place in the border regions of the following three Chinese provinces: Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan, and resulted in communist victory. This campaign was part of Campaign to Suppress Bandits in Central and Southern China.
