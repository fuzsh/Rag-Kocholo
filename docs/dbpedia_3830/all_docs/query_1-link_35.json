        "text": "From the music of the Allman Brothers to Curtis Mayfield to Jo Jo and extending to a new movie this year about two great jazz musicians (Clark Terry & Justin Kauflin), there is a common theme of “Keep on keeping on”. In the arts that refers to performing, sharing talent, pursuing a passion and the quest to create, to excel and to never quit. There is a zest to improve, to innovate and to excite.\n\nIn the world of business however, that phrase tends to lose the meaning that many artists strive for. It is is transformed into an action of inaction. To say that a business should “keep on keeping on”, takes on the meaning of “doing what it has always done”. In other words, to remain in the current state the business is in. The Status Quo. The Latin translation being for that phrase literally means: “in the state in which” something is. By that definition, to pursue the Status Quo means your company should abandon any plans to grow, to expand, to improve or to innovate. To say that you are pursuing the Status Quo in the business world is the equivalent of ringing the death knell in the middle centuries. Success, at least long term success, and Stagnation, DO NOT go hand-in-hand.\n\nAnother phrase that is often over-used as an “explanation” for why things are the way they are, is: “IT IS WHAT IT IS”; sometimes referenced as “IIWII” (pronounced: eye-eye-double-you-eye-eye). As in the stock answer to questions such as “Why can’t the application do….?”, or “Why do the methods/procedures call for me to…?” becomes - Well, “It Is What It Is”. That answer is a cop-out and evades the question. We should NEVER settle for the Status Quo! It is time to remove that phrase from our vocabulary. Innovate, Dare, Inspire – those are the words and actions that need to replace IIWII!\n\nBack in 1997, Apple Inc. put together an ad campaign that touted the visionaries of the world. The words in the ad are almost polar opposite to the definition of what the term Status Quo is. This campaign was created as a collaborative effort between then Apple CEO Steve Jobs and the team from TBWA/Chiat/Day (Lee Clow, Rob Siltanen, Ken Segall, and Craig Tanimoto). The text of that ad reads:\n\n\"Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.\"\n\nThere have been a lot of hero’s and innovators and business leaders that originally were called “crazy”. They made discoveries and pushed the boundaries and Never settled for the Status Quo (or even considered using the term IIWII)! The author Jarod Kintz has been quoted as saying: “If the status quo came carbonated in a can, I’d shake things up.” I’d like to believe that there are many more misfits and rebels ready to shake up their carbonated cans of Status Quo. Now, no one likes to be labeled as “crazy”, and far too many folks have self-identified themselves as Innovators. The term of Innovator seems not only over-used but also too often miss-used and misunderstood.\n\nSo, how about we change our label? Let’s call ourselves “Disruptors” and accept that as our new title. Let’s challenge assumptions, discover new opportunities, shatter the chains that are holding us and our businesses back and risk to imagine new possibilities. It’s time we get rid of those tired and worthless expressions such as: ”That’s just the way things are done around here”, “We tried that once a long time ago…”, “We’ve always done it that way” and “It is What It Is”. As Disruptors, let’s all start using a new phrase:\n\n\"Never Settle for The Status Quo!\"\n\n_______________________________________________________________________"
