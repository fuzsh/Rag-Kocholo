Make of that what you will.\n\nThe Most Famous Classic Rock Rock Music Artists\n\n(As you can see, retirement has left me with too much time on my hands.)\n\nPost by mortified on\n\nI suspect it means nothing. Like most of these things.\n\nI'm surprised that Freddie Mercury sits so high in both categories. He was hardly a prolific solo artist. Queen, I get. But Freddie?\n\nI don't know anyone who's ever completed one of those surveys.
