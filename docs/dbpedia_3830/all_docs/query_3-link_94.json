        "text": "Have you ever had one of these in your home?\n\nI have. This is what my mom’s rocking chair looked like. Presumably purchased in the seventies, it sat in our living room for years. Though I knew this type of chair was a Thonet {pronounced tho-nay} bentwood rocking chair, I always thought the design was mid-century. Turns out it was designed way before that!\n\nMichael Thonet (1796-1871), is known as the German-Austrian inventor of the process of bentwood production, recognized by flowing forms and the resulting lightweight product. He first opened his furniture cabinetry workshop in 1819 in a rural Austrian town, where in 1830, he experimented with bending steamed wood to create furniture. The wood is heated with water vapour and then bent into the desired shape, which gives the pieces their particular charm. In 1853, he founded the the Austrian company ‘Gebrueder Thonet’. Mihael Thonet received a patent in 1856 for the process of bentwood manufacturing, when he and his five sons began to produce innovative ‘bentwood’ furniture.\n\nThe pieces became known for being practical, inexpensive and refined. By 1900, the Thonet family had 52 assembly-line production factories in Europe, and was the world’s major manufacturer of bentwood furniture. After his patents for the process expired in 1869, imitations abounded and still do. Some consider him the founder of modern furniture design. You probably will recognize another design of his, the one that made him famous.\n\nThe Thonet cafe bentwood chair.\n\nCheck out some of his early designs. Aren’t they neat? And amazingly still relevant?\n\nYou can definitely see a more Victorian look by 1904.\n\nI kind of want a couple of these for my front porch.\n\nI bought an imitation bentwood rocking chair at a garage sale several months ago that is sitting in my house. I planned on taking on a little upholstery project and tufting it myself. I do looooovvvveeee tufting. Maybe someday I’ll get to that project.\n\nSometimes you just need to see something in an actual room, right?\n\nBunny Williams gave this one an acrylic back to not block the beautiful view in this home. Genius!\n\nThere are several photos I found where people have revamped their chairs. Painting the frame (like the picture above) and sometimes painting the frame and putting upholstery over the caning.\n\nIf you are wanting a more modern look, I love the chrome version!\n\nThis guy is on Ebay right now! Somebody needs to snag him! With some new upholstery, this would be so fab!\n\nI also found this teensy little version for a dollhouse on Ebay. How adorable is this?!\n\nI see these chairs all the time at estate sales and consignment stores. Craigslist usually has several. Find one, make it you, and send me a picture! I love to feature Reader Projects!\n\nIt is no secret that I love pretty antiques and well-designed vintage furniture. Something I really appreciate when I find things I think are special, is that these pieces were the maker’s artwork. Time and thought and scrupulous detail were all part of the process that would create something useful, comfortable, lovely and lasting. So the next time you see a bentwood rocker, I hope you see more than “Mom or Grandma’s old rocking chair”, I hope you think of Michael Thonet and his five sons, experimenting in their little shop in Austria. Steaming and bending and creating something different and beautiful. A classic furniture style. One we are still using more than 150 years later.\n\nIn conclusion, I had to include some incredible pieces of art, by a few very notable artists I might add, that were inspired by Thonet’s molded artwork.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nA rare peek into a candid Picasso."
