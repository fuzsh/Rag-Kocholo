        "text": "Here is Status Quo playing ‘Rockin’ All Over The World’ live as the opening song of the opening set of Live Aid on 13 July 1985 – the worldwide concert as organised by Sir Bob Geldof and Midge Ure that raised some £150m for victims of famine in Ethiopia.\n\nThis is at Wembley Stadium in London with 72,000 people. A concert was then held that day at John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia where 90,000 people attended. Wikipedia says: ‘On the same day, concerts inspired by the initiative were held in other countries, such as the Soviet Union, Canada, Japan, Yugoslavia, Austria, Australia, and West Germany. It was one of the largest satellite link-ups and television broadcasts of all time; an estimated audience of 1.9 billion, in 150 nations, watched the live broadcast, nearly 40 percent of the world population.’\n\nThe line ups were seriously star-studded, including Elton John, Queen, Madonna, Santana, Run DMC, Sade, Sting, Bryan Adams, the Beach Boys, Mick Jagger, David Bowie, Duran Duran, U2, the Who, Tom Petty, Neil Young and Eric Clapton. Francis Rossi lead singer and guitarist of Status Quo later sad “Bob told me, ‘It doesn’t matter a fuck what you sound like, just so long as you’re there.”\n\nThis a reminder of times when countries around the world made a true effort to work together for the common good."
