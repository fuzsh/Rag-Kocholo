He recorded an album called \"Cantata of Social Comment\" released in England, and played keyboards on a platinum album with \"Status Quo\" still one of Europe’s top rock bands.\n\nFoster played keyboards on the first album by Kiss and four Gladys Knight and the Pips albums, which featured the hits \"Midnight Train to Georgia\" and \"The Best Thing That Ever Happened\".\n\nBruce was nominated for a Grammy Award for his song \"Look Out for Number One\", featured in the sound track from \"Staying Alive\", a film directed by Sylvester Stallone. This song was also used two different years at the Olympic games.\n\nCollaborating with the legendary songwriter Doc Pomus, Bruce wrote the title song from the Broadway musical \"Elvis, The Legend Lives On\". The cast included the Bill Black Combo and the Jordanaires.\n\n\"Trail of Broken Hearts\", performed by Cher for the soundtrack \"Days of Thunder\", was written by Bruce and Richie Sambora, co-writer Richie Sambora asked Bruce to collaborate on \"Stranger in This Town\", Richie’s solo album. This produced Richie’s hit single \"One Light Burning\", once again played for the torch-burning ceremony again at the Olympics, and \"The Answer\", Richie Sambora’s world-renowned anthem.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nWell , I never knew that :\n\nLazy Poker Blues is a Fleetwood Mac song from Mr Wonderful : written by Green/Adams and appearing on MKGS. Peter Green in his hey day and now looking a bit like this British blues rock guitarist and the founder of the band Fleetwood Mac. Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998 for his work with the group, Green's songs such as \"Albatross\", \"Black Magic Woman\", \"Oh Well\" and \"Man of the World\" have been recorded by artists such as Santana, Aerosmith, Status Quo. Green inspired B.B. King to say, \"He has the sweetest tone I ever heard; he was the only one who gave me the cold sweats.\"[7][8] Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page have both praised his guitar playing.[9] Green's playing was noted for its idiomatic string bending and vibrato[6] and economy[10] of style.\n\nPost by col on\n\nJimmy Horowitz played piano on Pildriver.\n\nBesides producing, arranging or appearing on albums by Thin Lizzy (Nightlife), Dusty Springfield, Cilla Black and Bad Company (Straight Shooter), he was also some early Rod Stewart albums.\n\nRod Stewart was managed by (Billy)Gaff Management (GM) at the time, who also managed Quo in the early 70's, prior to the formation of Quarry Management (with Rory Gallagher's management, Quo + Rory = Quory, hence Quarry!).\n\nHorowitz was also married to Lesley Duncan and was a member of her band. The Lesley Duncan Band also appeared on the Reading '73 album with The Faces, Andy Bown and Status Quo.\n\nLesley Duncan also did a lot of session vocals with Madeline Bell, who used The Status Quo as her backing band prior to Pictures Of Matchstickmen becoming a hit.\n\nOne of the Lesley Duncan bands line-ups included Jimmy Horowitz, Madeline Bell (see previous), Chris Spedding (who later worked with Bryan Ferry, The Vibrators, The Sex Pistols and The Wombles) and Andy Bown, who appeared on Pink Floyd's The Wall tour and is now more famously known as being an official member of Status Quo for the last 34 years.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nJuniors Wailing (White/Pugh) Appears on Ma Kellys Greasy Spoon , written by Kieran White and Martin Pugh , members of Steamhammer .\n\nThe band Steamhammer hail from Worthing England and were founded in 1968 by Martin Quittenton (guitar) and Kieran White (vocals, guitar, harmonica). The first stable line up consisted of Quittenton, White, Martin Pugh (guitar), Steve Davy (bass), and Michael Rushton (drums). The name of the band possibly influencing Quo's Piledriver album tag given their early influence and choice of song on MKGS.\n\nLike many of their peers (and according to Wiki) , the band experimented with instrumental passages, introspective lyrics, and ultrasonic guitar effects, along with folk, jazz and classical influences. After playing in English pubs in the late 1960s, Steamhammer’s self-titled album Steamhammer (aka Reflection) debuted on Columbia Records in 1968, featuring their single, \"Junior's Wailing,\" and including covers of \"You'll Never Know\" by B. B. King and \"Twenty Four Hours\" by Eddie Boyd as well as original songs by White, Quittenton, and Pugh.While the album was not commercially successful, the band’s sound became popular live, especially in West Germany. In the summer of 1969, Quittenton and Rushton left the band and the second version of the band recorded the album Mk II, released in 1969. It consisted entirely of original songs, and the musical style had more jazz and progressive rock influences.\n\nAfter the death of a band member and various line up changes , it was announced in June 1973 that they would now perform as Axis, playing their first gig under that name at the Marquee on 15 June. Quittenton rejoined, but the band split towards the end of 1973.\n\nAfter leaving Steamhammer, White recorded a solo album, Open Door, which was released in 1975 - he later emigrated to the US (Oregon), where he worked as a truck driver until passing away in 1995 (cancer). Quittenton played guitar and co-wrote songs, including \"Maggie May\" and \"You Wear It Well\" on albums by Rod Stewart.\n\nMartin Pugh, lead guitarist for Steamhammer and Armageddon, grew up in England during the 60’s and 70’s Golden Age of Rock and Roll. As a young musician, weaned on this synchronistic wave of sound that defined a generation and captured the world’s attention, Pugh began laying down his progressive, blues-and-folk-influenced roots with his first band, known as The Package Deal, who started gigging in Devon and Cornwall in the early 60’s. Martin soon moved to London and joined Carl Douglas (“Kung Fu Fighting”) & The Big Stampede for a year before joining Steamhammer. After blazing new trails throughout Europe with Steamhammer, Martin then moved to California and signed a deal with A&M Records, recording the Armageddon album in 1974.\n\nA version Steamhammers Juniors Wailing has recently been posted on another thread - enjoy , I like it. Here is a pic of Martin Pugh , who now lives in California\n\nPost by Detroit on\n\nJimmy Horowitz played piano on Pildriver.\n\nBesides producing, arranging or appearing on albums by Thin Lizzy (Nightlife), Dusty Springfield, Cilla Black and Bad Company (Straight Shooter), he was also some early Rod Stewart albums.\n\nRod Stewart was managed by (Billy)Gaff Management (GM) at the time, who also managed Quo in the early 70's, prior to the formation of Quarry Management (with Rory Gallagher's management, Quo + Rory = Quory, hence Quarry!).\n\nHorowitz was also married to Lesley Duncan and was a member of her band.

Rick played it as well on some tracks.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nFrank Ricotti\n\nFrank Ricotti gets an honorable mention for playing bongo’s on the Rocking All Over the World Album, standing in for Spud whilst he recuperated from a bad back .\n\nFrank was born 31 January 1949, London, England. Ricotti was born into a musical family and followed in his drummer-father’s footsteps by taking up percussion. Although adept on most percussion instruments, Ricotti concentrated upon the vibraphone and also developed his talents as a composer and arranger. In the late 60s and early 70s Ricotti played and recorded with Neil Ardley, Dave Gelly, Graham Collier, Mike Gibbs, Stan Tracey and Gordon Beck. Ricotti led his own jazz quartet and recorded the album Our Point of View, released in July 1969.\n\nBy the late 70s Ricotti had become established as a studio musician; during the following decade he was deeply involved in the soundtrack music for a succession of popular British television series by Alan Plater, including Yorkshire TV’s The Beiderbecke Affair.\n\nIn the 1980s he played with Chris Laurence and John Taylor in the group Paragonne, and played with Beck again in 1984.\n\nFrank Ricotti is apparently a living legend. Beyond being one of the most in demand percussionists in the world for the top recording artists, he has played on innumerable film scores such as Inception, Skyfall, Twilight Saga, Madagascar, Interstellar, Narnia, Fantastic Mr Fox, Dark Knight, Bourne series.. There isn't an hour in the day where, somewhere in the world, his playing isn't being broadcast\n\nRicotti has recorded with artists such as Status Quo, Freddie Mercury, Pet Shop Boys, Swing Out Sister, Belle and Sebastian, Clannad, Barclay James Harvest, Meat Loaf, Elkie Brooks, Rick Wakeman, Tina Turner, Aztec Camera, Thomas Anders, Alphaville and Mark Knopfler.\n\nPost by col on\n\nJimmy Horowitz played piano on Pildriver.\n\nBesides producing, arranging or appearing on albums by Thin Lizzy (Nightlife), Dusty Springfield, Cilla Black and Bad Company (Straight Shooter), he was also some early Rod Stewart albums.\n\nRod Stewart was managed by (Billy)Gaff Management (GM) at the time, who also managed Quo in the early 70's, prior to the formation of Quarry Management (with Rory Gallagher's management, Quo + Rory = Quory, hence Quarry!).\n\nHorowitz was also married to Lesley Duncan and was a member of her band.

Rick played it as well on some tracks.\n\nThe credit is \"Additional Piano\".\n\nRick is credited with Piano and Organ.\n\nI don't know on who played on what track, they're mostly submerged anyway.\n\nTook me years to hear the piano on Don't Waste My Time!!\n\nPost by dennis on\n\nWas this the same Tom Parker featured on Quo? :-\n\nThomas Arthur 'Tom' Parker (1944 in Dumfries – 18 April 2013 in Marbella) was a British musician. He started playing piano at the age of six and was performing in jazz clubs around London by his teens. In the 1960s he was a session musician. He was briefly a member of The Animals in 1966.\n\nIn 1972 he formed Apollo 100 with other session musicians and had a hit single \"Joy\", an arrangement of Bach's Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring.\n\nParker was also known for his popular arrangements of classical works, such as The Young Messiah, The Young Amadeus, and The Young Verdi which were recorded with the New London Chorale.\n\nHe died in Spain where he lived in semi-retirement."
