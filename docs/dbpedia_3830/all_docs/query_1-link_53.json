        "text": "Danielle SeeWalker is a Húŋkpapȟa Lakȟóta citizen of the Standing Rock Sioux Nation in North Dakota. She is a mother, artist, writer, curator, activist, and businesswoman and currently based in Denver, Colorado since 2018. Her visual artwork often incorporates the use of mixed media and experimentation while incorporating traditional Native American materials, scenes, and messaging. Storytelling is an integral part of her artwork and pays homage to her identity as a Lakȟóta wíŋyaŋ as well as her passion for redirecting the narrative to an accurate and insightful representation of contemporary Native America while still acknowledging historical events.\n\nAlongside her work as a visual artist, Danielle is a freelance writer and recently published her first book, titled “Still Here: A Past to Present Insight of Native American People & Culture.” She is also very dedicated to staying connected and involved in the Native American community and has served the past two years as Co-Chair for the Denver American Indian Commission. Through her work on the Commission, she has been able to be involved in several pieces of legislation that have directly affected her Native American community – including a law to abolish derogatory Native American mascots (2021) and to create an Office and Liaison for Missing & Murdered Indigenous Relatives (MMIR) investigations (2022 and 2023). Danielle considers herself an “artivist” as she can voice many important topics through her artwork and also be boots on the ground to make change happen.\n\nDanielle has also been working on a long-term personal project since 2013 with her long-time friend called The Red Road Project. The focus of the work is to document, through words, photographs, and video, what it means to be Native American in the 21st century by capturing inspiring and positive stories of people and communities within Indian Country. She recently evolved that project into a non-profit organization with a division to provide cultural arts opportunities to Native American people residing in urban areas. She brings traditional art forms such as quillwork classes to her community to revive these dying art forms for a new generation.\n\nJuliette Perine Myers is a queer, mixed-race Chinese-American artist based out of south Minneapolis who has been creating public art, painted and mosaic murals, sculptures, and community art in the Twin Cities and surrounding metro since 2015. Her style is known for its dreamlike and whimsical qualities and often draws from her different identities, mythology, and elements found in nature. Most of her public artwork has been collaborative and rooted in collective healing through community engagement and storytelling. For example, she has worked with mosaic artist Lori Greene to create numerous mosaic murals and sculptures since 2018 with the help of other assistants and community volunteers, and she also helped form the activist-based mural collective, Creatives After Curfew, following the murder of George Floyd in 2020. Recently completed art projects include a mural in the Joyful World Mural Park at the Minnesota State Fair, the Stories of Womxn mosaic sculpture on Snelling and Lafond Ave. in St. Paul, and contributing to the mosaic panels for the Survivors Memorial on Boom Island, Minneapolis.\n\nMichael Roy, a.k.a. Birdcap, grew up near the bayous of southern Mississippi, on America’s verdant “third coast”, a region battered by hurricanes and scarred by a violent, racist political history. Roy studied painting at Memphis College of Art but got his start as a muralist when he left the South and moved halfway across the world, where he became a part of the thriving street art scene in Seoul, South Korea. The character of “Birdcap” was born in South Korea. In the past decade, Birdcap’s career as a muralist has spanned continents, but the artist’s work is a product of the south, both a love letter to the region he calls home and a challenge to its problems. Birdcap works in a style equally steeped in Saturday morning cartoons and history paintings. He creates densely colored scenes that slide between references to Jim Henson and the Crossing of the Delaware. Using a vocabulary of fantastic shapes that make a Birdcap mural identifiable across the world, the artist takes up deeply personal subjects such as grief and loss, tackles political anxieties, and traverses a contemporary landscape both absurdly beautiful and troubled."
