        "text": "This weekend as I was running around the house working on lists and tasks; Spotify was providing a soundtrack in the background as often is the case. I wasn't really listening to be honest - it was white noise. But then, Smooth Criminal from Michael Jackson came on and I started to bop and dance without even realizing I was doing it until my kids (who are always watching) joined in.\n\nBOOM : Interlude for a dance party!\n\nOnce we had sufficiently shaken our hips, it reminded me that Michael Jackson was a genius - no matter what else in his life you might cite that paints another picture. My kids haven't been exposed to this music, but they too innately danced and could see the awesomeness in the beat and vocals. He was a world class innovator and the things he \"made\" stand the test of time. That is the highest praise really for me, rule breaking art that stands the test of time.\n\nFast forward to the next afternoon which saw me at a kids birthday party. With time to kill I decided to go down a \"Michael Jackson + Innovation\" rat hole on my iPhone. My instincts were confirmed. I wanted to share some of the rules that he broke and conventions that he challenged now over 30 years later when the hindsight is pretty powerful to inspire your next \"risk\" and put things into perspective:\n\nWhen Michael Jackson released Thriller there were a few \"rules\" or assumptions in music that had not been broken or challenged up to that time.\n\nEstablished rock guitarists did not collaborate with soul, R’n’B and disco singers.\n\nBlack artists were very rarely featured on MTV.\n\nMotown was necessary for black artists' success.\n\nJackson and Quincy Jones had enormous ambition and a huge desire to change the game and break those rules. Their plan with Thriller was to make an album that would appeal to fans of all genres. This would force the press to pay attention. They set out to get cross genre credibility. They actively sought unexpected and famous collaborators. They aimed for something never seen before. This takes so much ambition. There is no map. There was so much to lose on paper because Off the Wall, the previous solo record, had sold 8 million copies and defied the critics that said he needed his siblings for success. He could have released another record like that one and likely it would have also been successful on that vista.\n\nBut Jackson and Quincy weren't interested in incremental art with Thriller - they wanted to defy all these conventions and shatter them to create new rules for not only Michael Jackson - but the industry. So with the conventions at the time in place consider:\n\nJackson and Jones drafted in Eddie Van Halen to play a solo on Beat It.\n\nPaul McCartney sang a duet with Jackson on The Girl is Mine\n\nHorror actor Vincent Price provided the creepy vocals at the start and end of the song Thriller\n\nThe album itself played across genres in a way albums of that day did not - Billie Jean and Wanna Be Startin’ Something are funk tracks, Human Nature and Lady of My Life are ballads, Beat It is a rock song, PYT and Baby Be Mine fall into the realm of R’n’B and disco.\n\nThe Beat It video set a new standard – costing an unheard-of $150,000 to make.\n\nThe 14-minute horror film that was the accompaniment to the song Thriller, directed by American Werewolf in London’s John Landis, was something else entirely. Its budget was $500,000 and the production was on the scale of a major movie.\n\nDid you stay up to watch the Thriller video live on network TV? I did, that in itself shifts traditional channels to market and models. Having fans stay up late to watch a video...? Unheard of...\n\nThe proof is in the pudding. Thriller went on to win a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards and became the best-selling album of all time. It took guts, ambition, execution excellence, diverse perspectives and a masterful vision to weave all of this together to create this ambitious masterpiece.\n\nConsider the risks that all of those established artists took in collaborating with Michael Jackson on something radically different than the status quo. They broke the rules too (albeit with less risk). I have to assume that they took the leap because the concept of creating something ground breaking was exciting to them too - art for art's sake. No one of these collaborators needed the money.\n\nAll of that is satisfying to read and admire, but Michael Jackson's innovation extends beyond music and dance. It wasn't just music and his trademark moonwalk dance move. Michael Jackson fundamentally changed the formula for monetizing fame. I didn't make this connection until I was immersed in my reading, but the singer was the first musician to have his own clothing line, hawking official “Thriller” jackets and sequinned gloves. Remember those?\n\nHe was one of the first artists to sign massive endorsement deals, earning millions from Pepsi. He was the precursor to the more recent successes and stories of 50 Cent and his Vitaminwater fortune or Dr. Dre and his $3 billion headphone empire.\n\n“Jackson helped flip the paradigm of entertainer as contractor on its head, offering a new path: entertainer as owner,”\n\nIn the business world Jackson saw the value in owning a hit song. When his lawyers alerted him that the Beatles catalogue was for sale, Jackson jumped and against the counsel of his advisers he went hard. He was competing with Sir Richard Branson of all people! He applied innovation to his approach to winning. Rather than competing with money (his) against money (Richard Branson), he won the rights by offering something no one else could: a concert appearance in Perth, Australia, for the seller’s favourite charity.\n\nIn 1985, Jackson won the catalogue for $47.5 million. It’s worth $1 billion today.\n\nLessons:\n\nWhen you think that you are taking a big risk - things are likely not nearly as \"all in\" as you think, as changing the paradigm of which you are working inside. Go big!\n\nLeverage those characteristics that are unique to whatever you can offer. If you can't win the game based on the current rules, make new rules!\n\nSeek out collaborators and people with radically different perspectives. Divergent views de-risks things by providing a 360 that you lack in their absence.\n\nDoing something that is novel (when done well) is something that people will gravitate towards - not react against. Individual nervousness to break the mold is trumped by the collective desire to celebrate courage.\n\nThere are a few more weeks on 2017 - what paradigms or sacred cows can you challenge in 2018? The rewards are enormous when you succeed and you'll be smarter and wiser for trying.\n\nNow where is that Michael Jackson Christmas playlist?"
