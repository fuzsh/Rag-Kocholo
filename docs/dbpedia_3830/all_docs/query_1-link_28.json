        "text": "‘Quo’ing In – The Best of the Noughties’\n\nStatus Quo are delighted to announce the release of ‘Quo’ing In – The Best Of The Noughties’ an era spanning compilation taking in their greatest hits from the band’s output thus far in the new millennium, which includes 5 UK Top Ten studio albums, and many fan favorites. Along with this news comes the release of the first single ‘Caroline’, one of the band’s biggest hits; a brand-new album studio version recorded in 2022. The collection will be released on earMUSIC on 16 September 2022 on various formats: 2CD Jewelcase, Limited Edition 3CD Deluxe Digipak (featuring a bonus disc with 10 previously unreleased live classics, newly mixed in 2022) plus Digital.\n\nAs well as all of the key tracks from this important era of the band’s career, the collection includes brand new and never before available 2022 studio versions of the classics ‘Rockin‘ All Over The World’, ‘Paper Plane’ and ‘Caroline’ plus brand new 2022 studio ‘Out Out Quoin’ Remixes’ of live favourites ‘Backbone’ and ‘Cut Me Some Slack’.\n\nKicking off with tracks from 2002’s ‘Heavy Traffic’, which was the first ‘proper’ album of the Noughties [following the covers set ‘Famous In The Last Century’], this set also draws from ‘The Party Ain’t Over Yet’ [2005], ‘In Search Of The Fourth Chord’ [2007], ‘Quid Pro Quo’ [2011], ‘Bula Quo!’ [2013], ‘Aquostic: Stripped Bare’ [2014], ‘Acoustic II: That’s A Fact’ [2016] and 2019’s ‘Backbone’, plus a few other gems from along the way, including tracks with Brian May and the Beach Boys.\n\nFrancis Rossi said of the album, “Coming into the Noughties we were under pressure. Struggling to maintain our place at the top table and, in a way, weighed down by what had gone before. This was a time of change and the band that recorded ‘Heavy Traffic’ is different to the one that laid down ‘Backbone’ but what did not change was the passion, energy and desire to build on what had gone before. The fact that so many of the songs fitted into the live sets along the way is testimony to their strength. Anyone who knows me will be aware that I don’t deal in nostalgia, but I do think that what Status Quo achieved during this twenty year period – in the face of challenges that none of us could have predicted we’d have to deal with – is worth celebrating”.\n\nMore details and pre-order options can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.ear-music.net/status-quo-catalogue/"
