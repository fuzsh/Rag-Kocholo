        "text": "First of all, can I ask that we all keep the comments civilised?\n\n2nd of all, Status Quo supporters already know who the best and greatest Rock Band of all time is.\n\nNo, it's not Spinal Tap...LOL!!\n\nAccording to the long interview with ALAN LANCASTER, he told us that American Record Co. executives tried to extort massive amounts of $$ from them to pay off people's mortgages and other expenses.\n\nRadio Stations came up with the most outrageous and bizarre reasons not to play QUO's songs.\n\nThe real reason is that Status Quo were and are a trillion times better than Grand Funk Railroad and Lynyrd Skynyrd and Aerosmith and Journey and The Grateful Dead ( Boring ) The Allman Brothers etc.\n\nTherefore, if Status Quo were to receive high exposure on air and in the media, (after all, they were very handsome young men,) then they would've put all the ordinary American Bands in the shade and in the corner.\n\nAll of those ordinary American Bands wouldn't have sold as many records or been as popular with a superior product on the scene.\n\nThe superior product being STATUS QUO.\n\nWhich means that the Record Company executives wouldn't have made as much money from the American Bands.\n\nThe financial irony is that they would've made more $$ from STATUS QUO.\n\nThat's cutting off your nose to spite your face.\n\nStatus Quo were the first Rock Band to perform with a full Philharmonic Orchestra, many years before other Bands copied their idea.\n\nThe biased American media only report the American \" Johnny Come Latelies \" like KISS and Metallica.\n\nKISS even stole \" The End of the Road \" name from QUO's 1984 Concerts.\n\nStatus Quo are the pioneers and ground breakers in so many fields of activities.\n\nQUO supporters will always remember the day our Rock Legends played 3 Concerts in 3 different cities in 24 hours to raise money for Charity.\n\nThey are called THE MIGHTY QUO for many reasons, not just their superior music.\n\nBeing a supporter of the Greatest Rock Band in history, it's very hard to type all this with tears coming from my eyes.\n\nThere is no more passionate fan than a QUO fan.\n\nAs a post-disclaimer, I and other QUO fans do love Bands like Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band, Bachman Turner Overdrive, there are many more of course.\n\nQUO do a good version of Get Out of Denver ( Baby ) and a bloody great version of Takin' Care of Business.\n\nSome QUO fans, like me, have a diverse and eclectic taste in music.\n\nThe best thing to happen in music history was PUNK / POST-PUNK / NEW WAVE from mid 70's - mid 80's.\n\nWhen I first heard DEVO, B-52s, THE CURE I was hearing 3 of my fave Bands. Then there is\n\nJOY DIVISION, TALKING HEADS, ELVIS COSTELLO, GANG of FOUR, THE FALL, THE JAM, JAPAN, TELEVISION, BLONDIE, THE POLICE, ECH & THE BUNNYMEN, MAGAZINE, DEPECHE MODE, BUZZCOCKS, RAMONES, HUMAN LEAGUE ( before & after the girls joined ) TRAVELOGUE & REPRODUCTION are two of the best electronic albums ever made, then members left to form HEAVEN 17 ( PENTHOUSE & PAVEMENT )\n\nSEX PISTOLS, NEW ORDER, Siouxsie and the Banshees, THE PRETENDERS ( 1ST TWO ALBUMS )\n\nMADNESS, THE SPECIALS, SIMPLE MINDS, SQUEEZE, XTC, and in Australia there was a plethora of Bands & Artists that I enjoyed LIVE & in my bedroom with headphones on...........\n\nCheck out THE CELIBATE RIFLES & LIME SPIDERS or v SPY v SPY, DIVINYLS, THE SAINTS,\n\nTHE SCIENTISTS, SCREAMING TRIBESMAN, ALLNITERS, COLD CHISEL, MIDNIGHT OIL,\n\nHOODOO GURUS, MACHINATIONS, THE RADIATORS, THE GO -BETWEENS, the list goes on.......\n\nAll the time knowing that I had THE MIGHTY QUO albums in chronological order ready to play when I was feeling sad or melancholy.\n\nWhen I play my Kit, I smash the hell out of it to \" Nightride \"\n\nI've broken a few sticks belting the life out of the High Hat.\n\nLONG LIVE THE QUO!!!!!!!!!!\n\nNobody and Nothing comes close to the Greatest Rock Band in history.\n\nRIP Rick ' Reg ' Parfitt-The greatest Rhythm Guitarist in music history, not a bad singer either.\n\nRIP Alan ' Nuff ' Lancaster-The greatest!!!!!! Bass player & Hard Rockin' nice guy, powerhouse vocals.\n\nPosted by Lancaster Parfitt Coghlan Rossi Lynes on Friday, 11/11/2022 @ 03:00am"
