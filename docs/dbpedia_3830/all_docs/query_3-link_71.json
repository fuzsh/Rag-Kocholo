        "text": "On the 23rd of December 1888, in a small house in Arles in the South of France, one of the most famous artists of all time — Vincent Van Gogh — feverishly cut off his own ear in a mysterious act of self-mutilation.\n\nVan Gogh's friend and fellow painter, Paul Gauguin planned to visit in October. Eagerly anticipating his impending visit, in this letter to his friend Van Gogh promised that, en route from Pont-Aven to Arles, Gauguin would see \"miles and miles of countryside of different kinds with autumn splendors.\"\n\nVan Gogh also reported that a recent bout of eyestrain forced him to remain indoors and paint an interior \"with a simplicity à la Seurat.\" This painting was The Bedroom — sketched and vividly described here — in which he \"had wished to express utter repose with all these very different tones.\"\n\nVan Gogh expressed his desire to talk with Gauguin about this and other paintings, admitting that \"I often don't know what I'm doing, working almost like a sleepwalker.\"\n\nThe circumstances in which Van Gogh cut off his ear are not exactly known, but many experts believe that it was following a furious row with Gauguin at the Yellow House. Afterwards, Van Gogh allegedly packaged up the ear and gave it to a prostitute in a nearby brothel. He was then admitted to a hospital in Arles."
