        "text": "Many of you know that we love unusual and interesting chairs. Due to their scale and form, they can be something more than just good furniture, adorning a space and becoming sculptural objects in a room in their own right.\n\nOne of our all-time favourite models is Klismos, a design that originates in ancient Greece and is distinguished by its spare, elegant lines and sweeping, curved rear stiles surmounted by a broad, deeply curved tablet, which supports the sitter's shoulders, or which may be low enough to lean an elbow on.\n\nThe Klismos (Greek: κλισμός) was a specifically Greek invention, without detectable earlier inspiration. No examples have survived from the ancient times and ancient sources give no specific description of its form, but the depictions of ancient seat furniture are familiar from painted pottery and bas-reliefs from the mid-fifth century BCE onwards. In epos, Klismos signifies a throne or an armchair; in Homer's Iliad, after Priam's appeal, Achilles rises from his thronos, raises the elder man to his feet, goes out to prepare Hector's body for decent funeral and returns, to take his place on his klismos.\n\nThis Attic red figure kylix depicts the teacher Linos seated on a Klismos chair, reading from a papyrus roll. His pupil Mousaios stands in front of his teacher reading from the writing wood tablets he holds in his left hand. Preserved in the Musée du Louvre, this school scene is one of the earliest surviving images of anyone reading a papyrus roll. Athens, 450-400 BC.\n\nAnother great example of Attic pottery from 460–450 BC, depicting a woman seated on a Klismos while playing a barbitos. Preserved in The Walters Art Museum, Baltimore, MD.\n\nWe can only guess what is going on in this scene, depicted on a 4th century BC Greek oinochoe, but one detail appears quite certain: it is highly unusual that a Klismos is rendered in a three-dimensional aspect. The scale of the chair is impressive, as is its sculptural boldness. The oinochoe is on display at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, Gallery 16.\n\nIt is worth noting that klismoi were not exclusively made in wood for domestic use, but could also be carved in stone or marble to form prestigious seats for prominent citizens in public spaces, such as forums or theatres. Illustrated is a proedria at the theatre of Dionysos, Athens (6th–4th centuries BC), finely executed in marble.\n\nBeing avid admirers of the Greek cultural and philosophical tradition, the Romans adopted Greek architecture, design and fashion. Depicted seated on a Klismos chair is Marcus Claudius Marcellus (c. 270 – 208 BC), five times elected as consul of the Roman Republic. On display in Rome, Capitoline Museums, Palazzo Nuovo, Hall of the Emperors.\n\nWhile the depictions of Klismoi on pottery are more numerous, they are usually quite stylised and might exaggerate the proportions. The surviving examples rendered in marble offer priceless information about the details of their construction and embellishment, such as these elegantly chamfered legs and stiles. This Roman marble statue dates to the 2nd cent. CE, it is fitted with the head of Helen, mother of Constantine the Great (dating to 320—325 CE), modelled seated on a finely detailed Klismos of relatively small scale. On display in Rome, Capitoline Museums, Palazzo Nuovo, Hall of the Emperors.\n\nAnother particularly sculptural depiction of Klismos, in terracotta, forms part of a funeral group of an unknown poet or musician. Circa 330–300 B.C. The Getty Museum.\n\nAn early 19th century engraving by Lorenzo Roccheggiani of a reconstruction of a Klismos (on the right) from a painting on an 'Etruscan' pottery amphora, shown on the left.\n\nThe Klismos fell from general favour during the Hellenistic period and was only revived during the second, archaeological phase of European neoclassicism in the 18th century, when it first started to appear in historical paintings, and later in actual designs for furniture. The republican ideals of Greek and Roman antiquity corresponded well with the 18th century enlightenment and the aesthetics of the noble past, manifested in the style républicain, that appealed to the educated men of the late 1700's.\n\nThe Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons, 1789, a monumental canvas by Jacques-Louis David (1748–1825), depicting the Roman leader Lucius Junius Brutus, founder of the Roman Republic, contemplating the fate of his sons while seated on a grand scale Klismos. The artist commissioned some chairs from Georges Jacob in 1788, to be used as props in his historical paintings that required a high level of visual authenticity. Musée du Louvre.\n\nAn extremely curvaceous Klismos was designed in 1790 by a Danish artist Nicolai Abildgaard (1743 - 1809), one of the earliest examples of the Klismos Revival. The Danish Museum of Art & Design. SMK Foto\n\nIn England, it was the gentleman collector Thomas Hope who pioneered the Klismos form in his designs for Duchess Street house-museum in London. Klismos-inspired chairs were illustrated by Hope in several variations in Household Furniture and Interior Decoration (1807)\n\nAnother British furniture designer George Smith, apparently, owed a great deal of inspiration to Thomas Hope. He published his A Collection of Designs for Household Furniture and Interior Decoration in 1808 which became the first collection of designs for ordinary furniture in a fully developed Regency style\n\nTwo from a set of eight Klismos chairs formerly in the Entrance Hall at Harewood House, Yorkshire, probably supplied around 1817 by the ‘Royal’ cabinet-makers, Marsh & Tatham, to Edward ‘Beau’, Viscount Lascelles (1764-1814) as part of a Regency refurbishment, which included fitting up the hall in the Egyptian style. Retaining their original faux calamander finish with gilt accents. Sold at Christie's London, 13 December 2019, lot 107 (£35,000).\n\nIn America, the fashionable new style was pioneered by the architect and designer Benjamin Latrobe. During the James Madison administration (1809–17), Benjamin Latrobe designed a suite of painted furniture for the White House in the latest Grecian style. Although the suite was destroyed in a fire in 1814, drawings for it bearing Latrobe’s instructions to the Baltimore fancy chair makers John and Hugh Finlay still exist. Illustrated are two chairs from the workshop, from the collections of The Metropolitan Museum of Art (L) and The Winterthur Museum (R).\n\nAncient Greek aesthetics had their second revival among the connoisseurs of the early 20th century, being later reimagined by Art Deco.\n\nOne of the most pleasing manifestations of the second Greek revival is Villa Kerylos in Beaulieu-sur-Mer, France, built by the architect-archeologist Emmanuel Pontremoli (1865 – 1956), who also designed amazing murals, mosaics and furnishings for the house that are inspired and in some cases, directly copied from antique sources. The design was loosely based on aristocratic homes on Delos – archeological excavations at the tiny island began in 1872.\n\nThe furniture designed by Pontremoli but was splendidly crafted by cabinetmaker Louis-François Bettenfeld.\n\nReflecting on the perfection of Greek works of art in 1812, George Smith wrote that every attention “was evidently given to produce a flowing and correct outline; and so to arrange the parts in masses, that the whole should appear clear and distinct . . . and it is this happy relief, this rejection of little parts, that gives their works so chaste and pleasing an effect.”\n\nPossibly the most iconic interpretation of the epic Klismos was the creation of Terence Harold Robsjohn-Gibbings (1905–1976), a British-born architect and furniture designer.\n\nIn 1960, T. H. Robsjohn-Gibbings met Greek cabinetmakers Susan and Eleftherios Saridis, and, together, they created the Klismos line of furniture, which drew heavily on classical forms. It is still in production.
