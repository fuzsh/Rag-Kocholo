        "text": "David Hockney is an English artist, painter, and photographer who was born on July 19, 1937. Hockney is regarded one of the most prominent artists of the 20th century. He attended the Bradford College of Art and the Royal College of Art. His paintings reflect upon different times in his life such as his relationships with friends, family, and lovers.\n\nThe image combines the chair in different angles which make its appear as if they are facing inwards. This gives the appearance of the image edge. My interpretation of this picture is that when a situation or scenario is approached from various angles, it gains a whole new perspective. The photo montage captures a situation whereby when a typical situation is interpreted by different people one ends up with a combination of various aspects of the common situation, in this case, the chair.\n\nHockney is mostly known for his paintings which are inspired by his life in California. He captures the beautiful nature, leisure activities, culture, the people and the weather of Los Angeles in his colourful Pop Art paintings. For instance, his famous Swimming Pools series is characterised by its’ smooth and vibrant hues. His paintings and photographs have been featured in various exhibitions such as the Tate Britain Exhibition. He has also starred and inspired documentaries such as the Randall Wright’s David Hockney Documentary.\n\nA few artists that have been inspired by David Hockney include Chuck Close, Cecily Brown and Martin Scorsese. Hockney continues to incorporate his art into technology in that his most recent pieces have been developed on an iPad. He continues to remain humble and does remarkable work as an artist making his mark in the world of art."
