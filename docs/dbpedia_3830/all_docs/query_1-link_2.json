        "text": "Transcendentalism and The Age of Status Quo Art\n\nBy definition Transcendentalism is the means to navigating oneself to a higher plane of thinking, feeling, and understanding by way of allowing all of the senses to experience the world. American and European artists in the past have claimed that such experiences can permeate the work of artists and the subsequent enlightenment within the work most definitively leads to better art. Furthering ones artistic endeavors to better outcomes I believe is and should always be the chief purpose of the artist and thus Transcendentalism I believe is an integral tool for the artist.\n\nI grew up along the East Coast of the U.S. and spent much time looking at long, grey skies for weeks on end during the winter months only to enjoy the first warm spring days to such an extent that it still feels criminal, after 40 years of my life, to remain indoors. This is a basic rationale for Transcendentalism. Everyone who experiences true winter cold for the entirety of the winter season appreciates the warmth of spring and summer and this can best be demonstrated during those first few days of warmer weather. I would invite you to the Jersey Shore or Delaware, Virginia or Carolina beaches to see just how many people flock to resort towns with nothing but smiles and towels. It is not to say that various weather patterns and different climate conditions are not conducive toward an improved lifestyle or for the artist better work though. I mean only to point out that the people who do not experience climatically desired weather conditions year round fully take advantage of the weeks and months when the conditions are as desired.\n\nThe reason that they do this is because they feel an inherent or innate connection to the elements; to Nature, which they do not necessarily feel outwardly during the colder seasons. They therefore decompress their minds and bodies and instinctively allow themselves to be at peace with the world. Essentially they are becoming one with Nature. The point that I wish to make here is that we as animals on this planet have an intrinsic relationship with the natural world. Because artists and other creative oriented people draw inspiration from diverse sources the natural world very often is disregarded in the contemporary world of art making however I believe that this is a perilous error on our parts."
