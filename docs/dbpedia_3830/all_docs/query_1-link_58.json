        "text": "The music industry has long been the focus of scrutiny from many artists for its overbearing record contracts and manipulation of naive and hopeful talented musicians. Millions of fans might not know that their favorite musicians don’t own their own music.\n\nMany of the world’s most infamous musicians have come out against record labels. Prince is notorious for coming out and warning young artists — “don’t sign.”\n\nWhat does it look like when record labels own their artist’s music?\n\nThe Record-Breaking Re-Record\n\nEnter in: Taylor Swift and her army of dedicated fans, aka — Swifties. On Friday, November 12, Taylor re-released her album Red from 2012, originally owned by a label. This time, she is label-free. The album rendition is titled Red (Taylor’s Version).\n\nBillboard reported that Swift had the biggest album sales week of 2021. According to Spotify, Taylor broke records on the streaming platform for most album streams in a single day by a female artist (90.8M). That said — the previous title holder was also Taylor, following her release of “Folklore” in 2020.\n\nTubular’s data reports that Swift’s personal Youtube racked up 170M views across 39 uploads in the first week of release. In just 7 days, +7,890 album-related videos were uploaded by fans across Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, and Twitch.\n\nExercising Creative Freedom\n\nOne of the most notable songs on the album that Taylor says she is most excited about is “All Too Well”.\n\nWhen Swift appeared on The Tonight Show, she told Jimmy Fallon this was her favorite song on the original Red album from 2012. Still, she revealed “oftentimes my personal favorites don’t end up being singles or videos” due to labels having the final say in the songs that they’ll push and market the most. So the original 10-minute version of the song was cut down to a standard length and never given a video feature — until now.\n\nSwift resurrected this song with her director debut for the short film “All Too Well”. This video won the highest number of Youtube views on Taylor’s channel with 41.1M and 3.6M engagements in just one week and more than eight other song variations, such as the lyric video, short film, and SNL performance earned over 70M views total.\n\nMastering Fan Engagement\n\nTaylor made her directing debut with “All Too Well”, a short film starring Sadie Sink from Stranger Things and Dylan O’Brien from Maze Runner. In her classic Swift-style, she dropped dozens of “easter eggs” (clues & codes) throughout the 14-minute film, which incite her fans to scour the content for a hint into Swift’s personal life. This scavenger hunt game she’s created with fans exhibits a mastery of viewer-creator relationships.\n\nEngaging with fans this way exponentially propels viewership, engagements, and minutes watched. When you have millions of people raking through details with a fine-toothed comb, engagement skyrockets — this is a lesson that all brands and creators can learn. Today’s young social video audiences want to participate, relate, and be involved rather than just consume.\n\nThe Future of Crowd Funding\n\nSwift’s ability to produce records sans-labels has allowed her to reassume creative control and become more successful than ever before. She’s breaking records left and right. But how can up-and-coming artists without a fanbase as loyal as the Swifties afford to do the same?\n\nWe believe the evolution of social video can offer a direct line of communication between creator and consumers. Many artists are looking to promote NFTs via social media to use fan funding for an album, exonerating them from going to a record label. This trend is not unique to the music industry, as it spans across all industries where creators are becoming self-empowered through social platforms.\n\nBut why would fans pay for NFTs when they can stream on Spotify or Apple Music?\n\nThe truth is that fans love the artist, not the record label. We’ve seen how Swifties have responded in the first week of Red (Taylors Version), and celebrated her freedom to exercise creative control. Many music-lovers would be happy to support their favorite up-and-comers in recording an album with total creative authenticity rather than one edited by a label.\n\nSocial video and the creator economy have single-handedly altered the way musicians put out music. This shows us what the future of dispersed funding could look like. It also indicates how consumer-creator relationships empower creators. For more predictions on the future of the Creator Economy, read here.\n\nOther female artists have also taken a bit of power back this month. Jessica Simpson bought back the rights to her lifestyle & clothing brand for $65M. Additionally, after over a decade of conservatorship, Britney is finally in control of her own money, property, and life. #FreeBritney.\n\nWe spoke to the Lead Product Manager and Taylor Swift expert at Tubular to get his perspective on the future of creatives in power.\n\nInsights to Actions:\n\nWhat can your company learn from the Taylor’s reign?"
