        "text": "I went back in time on Saturday, to 30 years ago, which was the last time I saw Status Quo play live. I was a kid, and went to Milton Keynes Bowl on 21 July 1984 to see what was billed as the last ever Quo show. It turned out it wasn't; they were back together for Live Aid within a year, and recommenced a career that continues to this day. I always felt cheated by that; I wouldn't have gone had it not been the last ever show.\n\nBut on Saturday night – as part of my continuing to campaign for force Guardian music writer, pop historian, and Saint Etienne band member Bob Stanley to embrace heavy rock – I was down at Eventim Apollo (or the Hammersmith Odeon, as pretty much everyone there would have known it) for the return of the Frantic Four, the original Quo line-up. Or, rather, the second return of the Frantic Four, since they first reunited this time last year for the first time since 1981. Never let it be said Quo don't have a pretty good eye for an opportunity, because this line-up is alternating with the actual current line-up, the Frantic Four playing the deep cuts, the current line-up doing the end-of-the-pier hits set.\n\nRecent years have seen some extravagant claims made for Quo. A big Mojo feature posited their single-mindedness as a precursor to punk, and Bob suggested to me they had plenty in common with Krautrock, in their own peculiar way – making Francis Rossi and Rick Parfitt the Norwood Neu! – and that the guitar pattern that introduces Caroline has rather more in common with the systems music of Steve Reich than with, say, Foghat.\n\nI can't go that far. And I doubt Quo would be likely to make those claims for themselves. But, equally, to paint them as the world's most limited band is to do them a grave disservice. They are used a byword for predictability: I saw a review earlier of the Cure that took this usage, saying they had \"turned into a formulaic, Goth rock Status Quo\". And that's simply unfair, probably on the Cure and certainly on the Quo.\n\nFor a start, it isn't all heads-down no-nonsense mindless boogie. Alan Lancaster's Is There a Better Way is a song that provides some justification for the proto-punk argument; the guitar intros to Oh Baby and Blue Eyed Lady venture into near baroque territory; and Rossi, as everyone who's seen him live knows, is a genuinely excellent blues guitarist, while Parfitt's frantic downstrokes on rhythm were the blurry twin of Johnny Ramone.\n\nBut I can't deny it. Quo are at their most thrilling – and thrilling is the right word – when they bring on the boogie. Rain was astoundingly heavy, Down Down as fabulous as ever (and as lyrically puzzling: \"I want all the world to see/ To see you're laughing and you're laughing at me.\" Why? Who would want that?). Small wonder the Apollo/Odeon was as packed as I've ever seen it, with an audience as fiercely partisan as I've ever encountered. This was the first time I've ever entered that auditorium and been physically unable to make more than a couple of steps into the crowd.\n\nSo why are Quo so dramatically underrated by those outside their fanbase? It can't just be that people think they do one thing and one thing only – look at AC/DC, whose range is equally limited, but who are now regarded by anyone with half a brain as a treasure. I think it's more to do with their lack of any hint of rock star mystique. Now, you might say AC/DC lack that, too, but they do it by being more or less invisible when they're not touring, and by doing so few interviews. By staying silent, they make themselves more interesting than they actually are. Quo, by contrast, have no problems putting themselves out there – Rossi and Parfitt have told their war stories a thousand times – to the extent that they even starred in their own crime comedy last year, Bula Quo! There's no hint of mystique about them: Rossi and Parfitt are evidently a pair of genial south London fellas who do exactly what they want, which makes them appear a bit naff (though it surely contributes to the fierce loyalty they attract from their fans). Pair that with records like the execrable Margarita Time and it's not hard to argue that if a big part of rock'n'roll's appeal is about creating an image of excitement, then Quo fail dismally. On Saturday morning, I was telling a friend I was off to see Quo that night. \"For pleasure?\" he asked. Yes. He looked aghast. And I got that reaction time and time again from different people.\n\nThat's probably the way I'd feel – possibly wrongly – about the official, current Quo line-up, which groups the hit singles into medleys, and which I associate with the band's transition from rock group to family entertainers. But the Frantic Four? That's one of Britain's defining rock groups, and they deserve to be treated as such."
