Most recently, I have met many from C-K through affiliation with the Wallaceburg Concert Band, the Chatham Kent Arts and Culture Network and this column. Many I have sought out, but several have been incidental to other artistic ventures I happened to be involved with.\n\nA recent example would be meeting Miranda McGuire. I met Miranda at Glasstown and was introduced to her as “an incredibly talented bartender” who was creating beer-based cocktails for the brewery. I offered to assist with a venture that Glasstown is creating to showcase local artists and discovered that Miranda is a professional artist who happens to work part time at Glasstown. Joni and I had a fascinating conversation with her recently and she will be the subject of an upcoming column.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe one constant I have found with the truly talented is that they work relentlessly at their craft. Conventional wisdom states that you need to invest 10,000 hours to become proficient at something. To put that in context, that is roughly the equivalent of five years of full-time employment. Also, not coincidentally, about the length of most apprenticeships.\n\nTalented artists take lessons, look to the experience and wisdom of those who have gone before, educate themselves about traits, styles and rules so they can copy, emulate and break free of the rules to develop a singular style.\n\nThe fact that gifted people work hard at their craft shouldn’t be surprising. But I have met people who are passionate about the arts, and want the accolades and respect without the work. I get it, arts are often treated in the education system like fluff – a bird course. There is also the romantic notion of people being born gifted. Of course, there is the emotional connection to the arts as well and our current “everyone gets a trophy” philosophy flies in the face of actual honest feedback.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nSo, it is not difficult to see why those who dabble in the arts believe they deserve accolades for limited effort. I always think of the 1984 movie Amadeus, more specifically the way the character of Salieri was portrayed in that Hollywoodized version of Mozart’s life. He refers to himself as “the patron saint of mediocrity.” We have put mediocrity on a pedestal and it is often assumed that the desire to be gifted makes it so.\n\nI have been asked for my opinion about theatrical performances many times. This is a landmine I try to navigate with kindness and tact. If someone that I know well actually wants honest feedback, when they ask me, I will share my honest observations and my experienced opinion. In the end it is just an opinion.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nHowever, far too often the request is a thinly veiled need for an ego boost and in this case, I do not try to offend anyone while giving some feedback. I applaud whatever I can find in the performance that was excellent – and there is almost always something. It may be the lighting, music, set or costumes, but it is still a positive focal point.\n\nFor me, the honest input of others is a valuable tool to help me see what I may be oblivious to. An example of this would be after the Wallaceburg Brass Quintet and friends’ concert in June. Gavin Warren, the talented clarinetist who graduated from U of T’s performance program last year was a part of the ensembles that played. After the concert Joni and I asked for his feedback on the quintet. Gavin drafted a two-page response to this request and Joni and I were thrilled to read it and see where we as musicians and as an ensemble can improve. Now, I wouldn’t ask my good friend Phil Moses to review our concert in detail because he is likely to say, “I’m no expert and it’s not really my style of music. But it sounded good to me.”\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nNo disrespect to Phil. His feedback would be nice to hear, but Gavin’s has weight because of the experience and detail. Gavin can focus on specifics and suggest alternative ways to present ourselves as an ensemble, approach the charts, the quality of our ensemble sound, etc. Phil simply does not have that experience. Phil makes us feel good, Gavin makes us better.\n\nIt is always surprising to me when artists or aspiring artists choose not to accept feedback from informed, experienced artists. The only path to improvement is to challenge yourself and the best way to do that is speak to someone who can give honest feedback to help you elevate your skill. Status quo is never the goal.\n\nEvents coming up:\n\nGavin Warren will be hosting his second area clarinet recital on Sept. 29. Watch here for more information.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe Wallaceburg Concert Band is about to get rolling for another season and the beginner music program will start soon. Dave will have more details in his column.\n\nGlasstown Brewing has Brewfest Sept. 23 where you can sample brews from all four local craft breweries and an Octoberfest event planned for Oct. 7. If you are an artist or crafter and want to attend the Oct. 7 event, contact Miranda at Glasstown for more info or check their Facebook page.\n\nIf you are an arts enthusiast, want to be a leader in supporting the arts across C-K, are motivated energetic and passionate about the arts, consider applying to join the dynamic team on the board of the Chatham Kent Arts and Culture Network. This board is only three years old, but very engaged in the arts community and looking for a few dedicated individuals to join the team.
