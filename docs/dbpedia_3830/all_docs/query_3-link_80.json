        "text": "No design element is more universal than the chair. While its basic body-supporting functionality has hardly changed, the chair has seen countless interpretations that encompass ever-evolving tastes, materials, technologies, and ideologies. All of which have made this practical domestic necessity, at its best, an emblem of status, style, and artistry.\n\n“The chair is among the most designed, studied, written-about, and celebrated artifacts of the modern era,” design historian Peter Fiell tells ELLE DECOR. And no wonder, when it offers insight into what makes us tick. “If you study the history of the chair, you rediscover the world,” Stine Liv Buur, manager of the classics collection at Vitra, explains. “From existing chairs, both from our contemporary times but also thousands of years-old chairs, we can learn about comfort, ergonomics, quality, material, functionality, connections, dimensions, and not least, sustainability.”\n\nWhat makes a good chair?\n\nSuch a question has been debated among museum curators, design critics, and interior designers—a query that will likely never be answered with finality. However, caveats aside, there are some general rules of thumb about what makes a good chair. Liv Buur deems that a successful build is “a comfortable seat that lives up to its function and is sustainable within material, connections, and longevity.” Fiell adds that beyond such considerations—a truly great chair fundamentally offers a special connection with its user. “It can be a physical, psychological, structural, intellectual, contextual, ideological, emotional, aesthetic, cultural, or even a spiritual connection.”\n\nWhat makes an iconic chair?\n\nOf course, for every really good chair, there are myriad failed attempts that have paved the way. Among such iterations, certain perches have forged their own path beyond the derivative and act as testaments to enduring design and remarkable ingenuity. Whether it’s a revolutionary design like Michael Thonet’s bentwood armchair or Le Corbusier’s Machine Age Grand Confort LC2 armchair, these furnishings—each for its own reasons—deserve a seat in the hall of design fame.\n\nWhat is the most popular chair in the world?\n\nWhile the answer to this question, too, cannot be quelled with a simple statistic, the Vitra Design Museum holds that the Monobloc chair is a firm contender as the most widely used piece of furniture in the world. “As the quintessential example of a mass-consumer product, the Monobloc chair can be found wherever there is a need for cheap seating—be it in European gardens, African cafés or Asian restaurants,” a 2017 exhibition plaque concluded. While the plastic chair has many renditions among designers with a shared vision to make a chair out of a single piece of material, it has been seen in the Panton chair, the Bofinger, and Henry Massonnet’s Fauteuil 300, which the exhibition holds “is regarded as the archetype of the inexpensive plastic chair.” Think about how many times you’ve pulled up a plastic chair of some kind in the past week, and you might be nodding your head in agreement.\n\nWhile such tasteful design objects are savored as museum-worthy, they were also intended to support everyday life. So by all means, appreciate them from afar, or if you’re feeling inspired, bring one into your home to be used as was intended. Read on for the 23 chair designs we believe are worth knowing—and, if you’re feeling inspired, owning. So draw up a chair, and don’t sit this one out.\n\nYear: 1969\n\nDesigner: Gaetano Pesce\n\nProvenance: Italy\n\nThe late Italian designer Gaetano Pesce was in the shower in 1968 when the idea for the Up chair came to him. “I had the sponge in my hand,” he told in 2017. “When I pressed the sponge, it shrank, and when I released it, it returned to its original volume.” This visual inspired his design of the pop-up polyurethane chair—a series of “Up” chairs that feature a rounded, sculptural form and are made with a single piece of polyurethane foam. Nearly 50 years after its creation, versions of it grace the halls of design museums around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Like all statement pieces, the “Up” chair—also known as La Mamma for its sensual rounded contours—has been the subject of controversy among some. In 2019, an Italian feminist group staged a protest around a 26-foot installation depicting the famous Up chair in Milan’s Piazza del Duomo during Milan Design Week, calling it a “further violence against women, represented as helpless and formless bodies, where man is not called into question.” Pesce responded by saying, “I believe these feminists have not read nor understood the meaning of my work in Milan.\"\n\n$6,511 at B&B Italia\n\nYear: 1956\n\nDesigner: Charles and Ray Eames\n\nProvenance: U.S.\n\nIf the LCW is the workaday sedan of design, the Eames lounge chair and matching ottoman, No. 670 and 671, are the Rolls-Royce of 20th-century chairs. “Unlike most other chairs by Charles and Ray Eames, this one was aimed squarely at the luxury end of the market,” Fiell says. “It was and remains very expensive.” It’s one of the most instantly recognizable designs by the Eames duo—and for good reason. “Comfortable and puffy like an old-fashioned club sofa, it is the mid-20th-century answer to the Victorian daybed,” Miller writes. Best known for their efforts to create inexpensive furniture pieces that could be mass-produced easily, the Eames set is the husband-and-wife team’s take on luxury. “The couple’s genius lies in the fact that the chair and ottoman look equally appropriate in the executive office, a home study, or the family den,” Miller adds. It’s also the best example of the evolution of the lounge chair typology, Vitra’s Liv Buur explains. “Charles and Ray Eames studied the chesterfield and the English club chair, in an aim to design a chair with similar comfort but a more easy and contemporary appearance. They succeeded—big time—both in design and longevity.” The seat was released by Herman Miller in 1956. Vitra produces and distributes the chair and ottoman in Europe and the Middle East and Herman Miller does so for the rest of the world. The first chairs introduced in the 1950s still exist today and continue to be one of the most collectible models of sexy (not to mention comfortable) midcentury design.\n\n$5,916, Herman Miller"
