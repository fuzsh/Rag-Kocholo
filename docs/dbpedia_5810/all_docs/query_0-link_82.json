        "text": "Arthur Salz (* December 31, 1881 in Staab, Bohemia, today Stod (Czech Republic); † August 10, 1963 in Worthington, Ohio[1]) was a German professor of sociology and economics who wrote on mercantilism, imperialism, and power.[2] He taught at the University of Heidelberg before being forced to flee Germany because of his Jewish faith. He was familiar with the Stefan George circle and married Sophie Kantorowiz, the sister of historian Ernst Kantorowicz.\n\nLife[]\n\nSalz was born on December 31, 1881 in Staab, Bohemia (today Stod, Czech Republic) to Heinrich Salz and Rosa née Popper. After completing high school (Gymnasium) in Pilsen, Salz studied economics in Berlin, where he attended the lectures of Georg Simmel. He later studied in Munich and Heidelberg, where he befriended Friedrich Gundolf and came in contact with the Stefan George circle. He remained in contact with Stefan George until 1925. He was also a regular guest in the home of Max Weber. Salz completed his dissertation in 1903 under Lujo Brentano, earning a doctorate in political science (Doctor Rerum Politicarum). Salz ran his family's business in Staab for a short time thereafter.\n\nSalz was the co-editor of Heidelberger Studien aus dem Institut für Sozial- und Staatswissenschaft and lectured at the Handelshochschule in Mannheim and at the Akademie der Arbeit in Frankfurt. In 1907, Salz took on a position as a lecturer at the University of Heidelberg. After further studies in Vienna and Prague, Salz completed his post-doctoral work (Habilitation) in 1909, entitled \"Wallenstein als Merkantilist\" (\"Wallenstein as a Mercantilist\").[3] He became an assistant professor at the University of Heidelberg in 1916.\n\nIn 1912, Salz married Sophie Kantorowicz, the sister of the historian Ernst Kantorowicz. They had three children, Beate, Judith, and Henry.\n\nSalz served in the Austro-Hungarian army during the World War I. He held a post as an economic adviser to Djemal Pascha, an assignment which took him to Constantinople and Damascus and awakened Salz's interest in Islam although he himself was a religious Jew.\n\nIn 1933, Salz was forced to leave his position at the University of Heidelberg because of his Jewish faith. He lived one year in England, where he held a position as a guest professor at the University of Cambridge. In 1934, he immigrated to the USA and became a professor at the Ohio State University. He never returned to Germany.\n\nPublications (selected)[]\n\nBeiträge zur Geschichte und Kritik der Lohnfondstheorie, Stuttgart: Cotta, 1905.\n\nGeschichte der böhmischen Industrie in der Neuzeit, München: Duncker & Humblot, 1913.\n\nFür die Wissenschaft gegen die Gebildeten unter ihren Verächtern, München: Drei Masken Verlag, 1921.\n\nMacht und Wirtschaftsgesetz, Leipzig: B.
