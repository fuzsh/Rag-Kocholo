        "text": "In recent decades, scholars have shown a distinct new willingness to concede the important place of religion in the life and thought of the philosopher Franz Brentano. But these studies are still dominated by a presumption that Brentano’s life and thought are best understood according to a model of secularization as a progressive waning of religion. This essay asks whether such a presumption is the best way of understanding the complex interconnections between various elements of his philosophical and religious ideas. It posits that a better appreciation of his position entails a confrontation with Brentano’s historical imagination, and especially the structuring role of his approach to the history of philosophy as one manifesting regular cycles of decline and regeneration. Brentano’s theory of the four phases of philosophy, though not programmatic of his approach to history as such, was nevertheless an exercise in thinking about the ways that history could accommodate various forms of progress and repetition. It was therefore a salutary means for thinking about the evolution of religion in ways that challenge any simple understanding of secularization.\n\nThis article seeks to establish a new perspective for understanding Catholic intellectual history in the German territories during the mid-nineteenth century. By analyzing scholars' efforts to revamp “Catholic Wissenschaft” in the context of a broader revival movement, it reveals how both “liberals” and “ultramontanes” engaged in a form of devotional activism which made Catholicism the measure of social action and scholarly practice alike. Important differences notwithstanding, scholars of all stripes saw their task as transforming Catholicism into a relevant tool for meeting the needs of the age. Rooting their efforts in the broader Catholic revival movement in this way, the article proposes “Catholic modernity” as a salient category for interpreting the significance of their work, and for better integrating it into the broader framework of German history.\n\nThis article reinterprets Catholic hostility toward the Enlightenment in the nineteenth century. Reading the efforts of German-Catholic scholars to distinguish \"true\" from \"false\" Enlightenment, it argues that this differentiation was part of a broader discourse of Catholicism through which Catholics sought to engage the modern world. More than merely an instance of co-opting a hegemonic terminology, laying claim to \"true\" Enlightenment helped scholars in three distinct ways: It legitimized their own scholarly praxis, served as a way of managing anxiety over Catholic involvement in the Enlightenment, and provided a framework for pinpointing Catholicism's cultural uniqueness. By reassessing Catholic hostility to one major tenet of modernity in this way, the article steps outside the \"master narrative of secularization\" and joins a growing tendency to approach religion from a postsecular perspective.\n\nMost nineteenth-century Germans saw German Catholics as either liberal, patriotic, and enlightened, or ultramontane, anti-German, and backward. However, dividing nineteenth-century German Catholics into two neat camps cannot explain certain movements among them. Particu- larly, the movement among Catholic intellectuals to found a new Catholic university in Germany and rejuvenate the reputation of Catholic scholars, reveals more than two clashing Catholic opin- ions about modernization and nation-building in Germany. The opinions of one particular leader in the movement can lead us further in and reveal more variation among Catholics in nineteenth- century Germany. Wilhelm Emmanuel Freiherr von Ketteler, Bishop of Mainz from 1850 to 1877, often used secular and nationalistic rhetoric to convince both fellow Catholics and non- Catholic fellow Germans that Catholic scholarship was a key ingredient of German leadership in Europe. Ketteler’s case for a new Catholic university demonstrates that the devoutly traditional did not all oppose the nation-building and modernization of the nineteenth century, and that German Catholics envisioned and enacted their role in the German nation and German modernity in more complex terms than either “liberal” or “ultramontane.” Reading his sermons, correspon- dence, and publications with methodological inspiration from literary scholars and Carl Schorske allows surface inconsistencies to give way to a coherent case for Catholic scholarship that inhab- ited a middle ground between Catholics and non-Catholics and between ultramontane Catholics and liberal Catholics. Ketteler’s invocation of the history of the Church and the Catholic history of Germany was the key to his narrative placing Catholics in Germany’s future. The existence of Ketteler’s narrative reveals as yet unfathomed depths in nineteenth-century German Catholicism. Studying Ketteler’s arguments can deepen our understanding of German nation-building in the nineteenth century as well as of European secularization in the modern age.\n\nGeorg von Hertling (1843-1919) - a cousin of Franz Brentano - is the only Aristotle Scholar and Professor of Philosophy who has ever held the German Chancellorship. Before becoming a conservative politician, he was a spearhead of the German catholic academics during the confessional struggles in the 1870s. He published a treatise titled \"Materie und Form und die Definition der Seele bei Aristoteles\", in which he defended a theory of individual forms in Aristotle. To a certain extent, he published this treatise in defence of his cousin Franz Brentano; but while Brentano’s theses on the soul were severely attacked by (mostly Protestant) Aristotle scholars for their Thomistic-Catholic spirit, the “critical method” adopted by Hertling was mostly met with cautious approval. Forthcoming in: ”The German Chancellor, Confessional Struggles, therein Aristotle & His Allegedly Individual Forms. Georg von Hertling as an Interpreter of Aristotle“, in: Gerald Hartung/Colin G. King/Christof Rapp (eds.): Aristotelian Studies in the 19th Century, Berlin/Boston: De Gruyter.\n\nTherese Neumann, Anna Katharina Emmerick, Anna Schaeffer, Adrienne von Speyer – these are some of the many Catholic women of modern German Europe who claimed to receive stigmata, the mystical wounds of Christ. In many cases, their lives and wounds sparked a flurry of public debate that can reveal much about the hopes and fears surrounding German Catholicism in a particular time and place. Some, such as Emmerick, also achieved a sustained following whose twists and turns can be tracked over time. Yet heretofore, the growing body of scholarship on modern German Catholicism has acknowledged these women in passing, if at all. This neglect may well be due to a general academic tendency to interpret stigmata as a product of internalized, psychologically damaging discourses of human (and especially female) imperfection and inferiority. The work of Caroline Walker Bynum, Andrea Dickens, and others, however, has revealed how mysticism functions as a suite of ideas and practices which can provide Christian women an alternative means of exercising power in the context of the patriarchal institutional Church. In this spirit, the physically punishing asceticism and gory wounds of women stigmatics become signs to be read in the light of the mystic’s theology and cultural context, revealing meanings other than those attributed to them, perhaps anachronistically, by modern psychology.\n\nThis essay explores ways in which political theology might help historians think differently about religion in the modern world. Beginning with a brief analysis of how Carl Schmitt appealed to nineteenth century Catholicism as a significant touchstone for articulating his conception of political theology, it then examines episodes from the nineteenth century Catholic revival and interprets them as a form of devotional activism. Rather than treating religious identities as fixed, devotional activism assumes that such identities are in constant flux, and are as much the consequence as the cause of religious action. Looking at the different ways that German Catholics sought to capitalize on changing circumstances during the revolutions of 1848, the essay pays particular attention to the specific time-consciousness animating these efforts. Like political theology itself, this time-consciousness contested a narrative of modernity in which religion is always already consigned to the past. By helping to reveal how Catholics struggled to define their future on their own terms, political theology offers a useful means of redressing some of the conceptual deficits in our approach to Catholicism, and religion, in the modern world."
