        "text": "Max Weber – Jurist, National Economist and Sociologist\n\nMax Weber is born in 1864 to a prosperous, educated middle class family with political and economic ties throughout Europe. At the start of his university career, the German Reich was experiencing a period of economic prosperity. Weber studied law, and obtained his doctoral degree and habilitation in Berlin on medieval commercial law and Roman agrarian history. He went on to address the problems of modern agrarian capitalism in the eastern provinces of the German Reich. As a self-declared member of the middle class he fought for a politically self-assured bourgeoisie and against its inclination towards feudalization. He was also an early critic of the sham constitutionalism of the German Reich.\n\nA „Galileo of the Humanities“\n\nKarl Jaspers about Max Weber(according to Sven Papcke in Die ZEIT from Oct. 5th, 1984, p. 33)\n\nAfter teaching commercial law in Berlin Max Weber accepted in 1895 an unexpected call to the chair of national economy and finance in Freiburg, even though he had not habilitated in this discipline. Only two years later Max Weber was appointed professor at the chair of national economy and finance in Heidelberg, succeeding Karl Knies. His health deteriorated rapidly, and he was less and less able to comply with his lecturing mandate. In 1903, Weber resigned from his official position, and though still an honorary professor he did not lecture again full time until 1919. For most of his career he pursued the life of a private scholar, concentrating on his economic and political fields of interest.\n\nIn 1904/5 Weber published probably his best known work “The Protestant Ethic and the ‘Spirit’ of Capitalism”. It locates the origins of the modern idea of profession in a lifestyle characterized by ascetic Protestantism. To this day this essay is considered one of the most important texts in sociology and economic history.\n\nAround 1911 Max Weber increasingly focused on the economic ethics of different world religions as well as their relation to other social structures and powers. This also enabled him to locate his thesis of a close affinity between the religious and capitalistic spirit within a universal historical framework.\n\nThe Puritan wanted to work in a calling; we are forced to do so.\n\nWeber, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Translation by Talcott Parsons (1930), p. 181; edited in MWG I/9, p. 422.\n\nHe aimed at developing a typology and sociology of rationalism. Weber diagnosed a rationalizing process characteristic of the Occident, separating Western culture from other cultural areas, leading to cultural phenomena that seemed to be of universal significance and validity. This process has considerably increased mankind’s technical domination of the world in all areas of life but has at the same time also increased the risk of a loss of meaning and freedom.\n\nAfter many short trips and visits his actual stay in Munich finally only lasted just over a year. During this time period, though, revolutionary events were taking place on a daily basis. Nothing less than the reorganization of Germany and Europe is open for debate.\n\nAs in Heidelberg so in Munich, Weber frequented intellectual circles. He was a welcome guest in Elsa und Max Bernstein’s literary salon where he met, among others, Thomas Mann. Weber also had contact with Paul Ernst, Ricarda Huch, Rainer Maria Rilke and Helene Böhlau.\n\nReference: M. Rainer Lepsius' Speech on the occasion of the unveiling of the commemorative plaque, published as: \"Max Weber in München\", in: Zeitschrift für Soziologie, vol 6., issue 1, Jan. 1977, p. 103–118.\n\nOn November 4th, 1918, only a few days before the political upheaval and the end of the German Empire, in the restaurant Wagnersäle in Munich’s Sonnenstraße in front of hundreds of listeners Weber talked about the political reorganization of Germany; Rainer Maria Rilke was in the audience. He argued for the following: voluntary renunciation of the throne by Emperor Wilhelm II, whom he hated, a strong fight against Bolshevism, preparation of a peace treaty acceptable to all participating nations, the parlamentarization of imperial constitution and the abolition of class-restricted suffrage throughout the entire Empire.\n\nWeber with his liberal and partially unconventional political views suffered rejection in Munich’s bourgeois-conservative milieu. In the summer of 1919 he testified in two high treason trials in favor of Ernst Toller and Otto Neurath, both of whom were active in the Räterepublik, the Bavarian republic of councils which sprung up early in 1919 before their suppression in April of that year. He also entered into discussions with communist students. One consequence of this was that Weber was appointed a full member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities by only a narrow margin.\n\nIn January 1920 Weber felt compelled to make a political statement. Right-wing students had entered a petition for clemency on behalf of Graf Arco-Valley, who had been sentenced to death for murdering Kurt Eisner, Bavaria’s first Prime Minister; they had also defamed left-wing students for protesting against the petition. Weber declared at the beginning of his lecture that he would have had Arco executed, because now Kurt Eisner would become a revolutionary martyr and Arco a coffeehouse attraction. His next lecture was disrupted by the shouting and whistling of right-extremists, and access to his lectures had to be controlled."
