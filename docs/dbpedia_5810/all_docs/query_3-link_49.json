        "text": "Databases on trending issues\n\nThe Archives of Sexuality and Gender program provides a robust and significant collection of primary sources for the historical study of sex, sexuality, and gender dating back to the sixteenth century. With material drawn from hundreds of institutions and organizations, including both major international activist organizations and local, grassroots groups, the documents in this collection present important aspects of LGBTQ life. Researchers and scholars can examine how sexual norms have changed over time, health and hygiene, the development of sex education, the rise of sexology, changing gender roles, social movements and activism, erotica, and many other interesting topical areas.\n\nFeatured\n\nApply natural language processing tools to raw text data (OCR) from Gale Primary Sources in a single research platform. By integrating an unmatched depth and breadth of digital primary source matter with the most popular Digital Humanities (DH) tools, Gale Digital Scholar Lab provides a new lens to explore history and empowers researchers to generate world-altering conclusions and outcomes. The Digital Scholar Lab offers advanced humanities computing tools that make natural language processing (NLP) for historical texts accessible, more efficient, and impactful, thus expanding the footprint of digital humanities across campus.\n\nFeatured\n\nExplores the history of the environment and conservation efforts across the globe from the late 1800s onwards. Environmental History: Conservation and Public Policy in America, 1870-1980 documents the emergence of these concerns from different aspects of conservation and environmental public policy in North America in the modern era. The archive concentrates particularly on the role of various government agencies, conservation organizations and individual actors who pioneered the study of the natural environment and campaigned for its protection.\n\nPolitical Extremism and Radicalism provides insight on unorthodox (by contemporary standards), fringe groups from both the right and left of the political spectrum through rare, hard to access primary sources. Content supports scholars and students answering questions on philosophical, social, political, and economic ideologies as well as on contemporary issues surrounding gender, sexuality, race, religion, civil rights, universal suffrage, and much more.\n\nAlternate Name(s) Gale Research Complete\n\nProvides access to millions of pages of primary sources, academic journals, periodicals, and eBooks.

It presents social history that casts a spotlight on diversity, equity, and inclusion with materials that cover activism and social justice issues, highlight disabilities in Queer society, offer information around alternative sexualities, document interactions between sexuality and religion, and represent diverse ethnic communities across North America. These LGBTQ history collections detail how identities developed in different social conditions, and how communities grew around dedicated, sometimes courageous, individuals.\n\nNew\n\nDemonstrates how society has presented and treated individuals with disabilities historically. Materials in this collection include personal memoirs, records of treatments, methods of education, and forms of remediation. Reports and proceedings of organizations and institutions that sought to help or heal those with disabilities are included, as well as records of policies and programs. Through this collection, researchers will grasp the many forms of institutional discrimination, political exclusion, and social control under which disabled individuals struggled. Materials chronicle how individuals were classified and treated and how some overcame physical or mental challenges to defy perceptions of being disabled.\n\nAlternate Name(s) Gale Research Complete\n\nProvides access to millions of pages of primary sources, academic journals, periodicals, and eBooks.
