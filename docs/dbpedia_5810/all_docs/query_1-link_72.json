        "text": "Arthur Norman Holcombe (1884-1977) was awarded a Ph.D. in economics at Harvard in 1909. In the Preface to his doctoral thesis he thanked “Professor Gustav Schmoller of Berlin, Professor Lujo Brentano of Munich, and above all Professor F. W. Taussig of Harvard.”\n\nThesis title: Public ownership of telephones on the continent of Europe. Boston, etc., Houghton, Mifflin, 1911, 8°. pp. xx, 482 (Harv. Econ. Stud., 6).\n\nIt is an indicator of the porousness of the borders between the disciplines making up the Harvard Division of History, Government, and Economics in the early 20th century that Holcombe moved so easily from the department of economics to the government department where he went on to have a distinguished career.\n\n__________________\n\nArthur Norman Holcombe was born in Winchester, Massachusetts, on November 3, 1884. He graduated from Harvard with an AB in 1906, and a Ph.D. in 1909. On August 30, 1910, he married Carolyn H. Crossett; they had five children. In 1964, he married Hadassah Moore Leeds Parrot. Holcombe split his career between public service and teaching. He was credited with establishing political philosophy and theory as basic disciplines in Harvard’s government curriculum. Among his students were Henry A. Kissinger and Henry Cabot Lodge. In 1949, he assisted Chiang Kai Shek in the drafting of a constitution for the Republic of China. In 1955, he retired as Eaton Professor of the Sciences of Government to become chairman of the Committee to Study the Organization of Peace, an affiliate of the American Association for the United Nations. He died on December 9, 1977.\n\nSource: “Biographical Note” from Guide to the Arthur N. Holcombe Personal Papers at the John F.
