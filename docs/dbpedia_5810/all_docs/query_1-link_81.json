        "text": "No. 4 of the Series: Sammlung älterer und neuerer staatswissenschaftlicher Schriften des In- und Auslandes; containing the German translations of the three most important economic tracts by James Anderson published between 1777 and 1801.\n\nBi(bli)ographics:\n\nJames Anderson was born into a farming family in Hermiston, Mid-Lothian, Scotland - today a suburb of Edinburgh – into the period we now call the Scottish Enlightenment. Anderson became one of this period’s typical representatives, but his economic achievements were mainly ignored by his more famous contemporaries. His parents died when he was very young and the education by a relative, his guardian, prepared him to manage – reportedly in his teens - the farm rented by his family. The General Biographical Dictionary [1] describes Anderson as “an eminent agricultural writer” and particularly interested in advancing the agriculture of Scotland which is supported by the long list of his publications (see pages VI and VII of Lujo Brentano’s introduction). In 1768 Anderson married the heiress to the estate of Mounie - Miss Seton, of Mounie in Aberdeenshire and shortly after also leased a 1.300 acre farm (named Monks Hill) nearby. In 1783 Anderson gave up farming and moved again to the vicinity of Edinburgh to facilitate the education of his children. By this time his reputation as a leading agricultural, political and economic author was well established throughout Scotland and beyond. Anderson’s reputation had earned him an honorary doctorate and the membership in numerous scientific associations. Around 1797 Anderson moved to Isleworth near London where he remarried in 1801 and continued his agricultural studies and publications. He died in Westham, Essex in 1808.\n\nContent\n\nThe original title of the first translated work (starting at page 29) is hidden in Anderson’s Observations on the means of exciting a spirit of national industry… as a Postscript to Letter Thirteenth, subtitled: On the Nature and Influence of the Bounty on Corn, and the other Corn-Laws of Great Britain. London and Edinburgh, 1777, pp. 307; the original English version of the text is available as Community Text in this collection at: https://archive.org/details/OnTheNatureAndInfluenceOfTheBountyOnCornAndTheOtherCornLawsOfGreatBritain\n\nThe second translated work (starting at page 95) carries the original title: An enquiry into the nature of the corn-laws; with a view to the new corn-bill proposed for Scotland. Edinburgh, 1777. This essay, published as a pamphlet, is now extremely rare as it contained the first exposition of Anderson’s Rent Theory. The Goldsmiths’ Copy of this essay carries the handwritten remark by Herbert Somerton Foxwell (1849 – 1936) “extremely rare and valuable”.\n\n“The Theory of Rent was first discovered and clearly stated by James Anderson in a tract published in 1777, and called ‘An Inquiry into the Nature of the Corn Laws, with a view to the Corn Bill proposed for Scotland’.” [William Stanley Jevons, The Theory of Political Economy (1871)] https://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Jevons/jvnPE.html?chapter_num=10#book-reader\n\nAn English extract – containing the essence of Anderson’s Rent Theory - is available as Community text in McCulloch’s: A select collection of scarce and valuable economical tracts …, pp. 321 at: https://archive.org/details/cu31924030156966\n\nThe third translated contribution (starting on page 161) containing Anderson’s Rent Theory – was originally published in Anderson’s RECREATIONS IN AGRICULTURE, Natural-History, Arts, and Miscellaneous Literature, Volume V., being the First [volume] of the Second Series, dated 30. August 1801., No. 6. Second Series, Vol. I., LONDON: 1801, pp. 401 sub titled: On Rent and Grain –A comparative View of the Agents of Rent and of Tythe in influencing the Price of Corn. The original essay is available as Community text in this collection at: https://archive.org/details/OnRentAndGrainAComparativeViewOfTheEffectsOfRentAndOfTytheInInfluencingThePriceOfCorn.\n\nA further and the briefest - in this commentators opinion the best - exposition of James Anderson’s Rent Theory – not contained in this translation – is published in : THE BEE, OR LITERARY WEEKLY INTELLIGENCER, consisting of original pieces and Selections from performances of merit, foreign and domestic, Volume Sixth, Edinburgh 1791, pp. 293 subtitled: On Rent and Grain - Disquisition on the Connection that subsists between Rent, and the Price of Grain, and their mutual Influence upon each other. Available as Community Text in this collection at: https://archive.org/details/OnRentAndGrainDisquisitionOnTheConnectionThatExistsBetweenRentAndThePriceOfGrain\n\nLast not least, Anderson published in London, 1801 a ‘follow-up’ on the first essay in this translation (which was published in 1777). This follow-up essay, published as a pamphlet is titled: A calm investigation of circumstances that have led to the present scarcity of grain in Britain: Suggesting the means of alleviating that evil, and of preventing the Recurrence of such a calamity in future. The second edition of this original text is available as Community text in this collection at: https://archive.org/details/ACalmInvestigationOfCircumstancesThatHaveLedToThePresentScarcityOfGrainInBritain\n\nLiterature:\n\nFor more details on Anderson’s life see:\n\nCharles F.
