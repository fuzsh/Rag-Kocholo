        "text": "DARMSTADT, West Germany, Nov. 14 (Reuters)—Heinrich von Brentano, West German Foreign Minister from 1955 to 1961, died in a hospital here today. He was 60 years old.\n\nDr. von Brentano, parliamentaryleader of the ruling Christian Democratic party, died of cancer of the esophagus two days after admission to the‐hospital, according to the doctor who treated him.\n\nHe had undergone a gullet operation last December but was later able to go home, and he had appeared to be convalescing favorably.\n\nDr. von Brentano, who once said, “I am a European by vocation,” was a man whose personal ambition was to work for the unification of Europe.\n\nBut in the last month of his life he was working to preserve the unity of the Christian Democratic party, which he had helped found and whose parliamentary leader he had been for nine years.\n\nHe had been the onlyaristocrat in the cabinet of former Chancellor Konrad Adenauer. He had been groomed for high political office fromn childhood, and his hobby was constitutional law and history.\n\nHe played a leading role in furthering the European unification movement and in securing the acceptance of West Germany as a full partner in it.\n\nAlthough his appointment as Foreign Minister brought no major changes of policy, Dr. von Brentano was not regarded as a yes man. His views on the priorities of European unity largely coincided with those of the masterful Chancellor, and he had enough tact to smooth over their differences in private before they came too far into the open.\n\nHeinrich von Brentano was a lifelong bachelor of fastidious and cultivated tastes with a fondness for antiques, rare wines and good clothes. A man of impeccable manners, he was also a talented negotiator for his Government.\n\nBy heritage and outlook a Western European, Dr. von Brentano had emerged by the mid nineteen‐fifties, as the spokesman for a pro‐French and strongly anti‐Communist foreign‐policy line.\n\nHe had always been very cautious about dealings with the Soviet Union, it was observed some years ago, because he believed that an active Eastern policy for West Germany would arouse the suspicions of the Western governments.\n\nBut finally he had become known as perhaps the most adamant anti‐Communist among the major political personalities in Bonn.\n\nDr. von Brentano's foreignpolicy views were fixed during the founding years of the Bonn Republic, then threatened by Stalinist Russia on the East and drawn in the West by the vision of a United Europe based on a French and German reconciliation. A decade later, when that vision had become blurred, Dr. von Brentano remained faithful to what was known as Little Europe—a continental union. This position made him a leader of what was called the Gaullist Opposition in Bonn.\n\nA shy, chain‐smoking intellectual who lacked oratorical gifts or a colorful personality, Dr. von Brentano was neverthe‐ less considered a shrewd and forceful behind‐the‐scenes operator. It was said of him that he rose to political prominence in WWest Germany after World War II by the attributes of a hardworking, dispassionate competence and a scrupulous honesty and loyalty.\n\nThe former Foreign Minister's full name was Heinrich von Brentano di Tremezzo. He was born on June 20, 1904, at Offenbach am Main in Hesse, Germany. The family, of Milanese origin, consisted of merchants and bankers who, in the 18th century, moved into Germany and established deep cultural ties.\n\nAmong the famous 19th‐century Brentanos were Betting friend of Goethe and Beethoven; the romantic poet Clemens; the idealistic philosopher Franz; the economist Lujo, and the democratic revolutionary Lorenz.\n\nDr. von Brentano's father, Otto, was a lawyer and a member of the Weimar National Assembly that drew up the constitution of the Republic. The son was the youngest of six children among whom were Clemens, an outspoken critic of Hitler and later German Ambassador to Italy, and Bernard, a novelist, who was driven into exile for his anti‐Fascist book, “The Beginnings of Barbarism in Germany.” Their only sister became a nun.\n\nAfter attending schools in Darmstadt, where he excelled in Latin and Greek, young Brentano studied law at the Universities of Frankfurt, Munich and Giessen, and in France at Grenoble. At the age of 28, he took over his father's law practice.\n\nDr. von Brentano entered politics in 1945. In explaining the reason for his move, he later told an interviewer:\n\n“In those days you Americans did not seem to think there were any decent Germans except Social Democrats. We had to show you differently.”\n\nDr. von Brentano himself had refused to participate in political activity under the Third Reich, and a leg ailment kept him out of military service. During that period he practiced law in Darmstadt.\n\nHis feelings toward Nazism were expressed in the Bundestag in November, 1951, when questions regarding its resurgence were raised. “We will not tolerate,” Dr. von Brentano said, “bodies that get together to drink to the health of Hitler, and similar monkey business.”\n\nAfter the war, because of his legal knowledge, he was asked to take part in drafting a new state constitution. He helped establish the German Federal Republic and won a parliamentary seat in the first postwar elections in 1949.\n\nDr. von Brentano succeeded Dr. Adenauer as parliamentary floor leader of the Government majority party. His work won him such acclaim that he was re‐elected floor leader in 1953 with 242 of a possible 244 votes from his party's deputies in the Bundestag.\n\nUntil his appointment as the Christian Democratic parliamentary leader, he played a major role in involving the new republic in emergent European organizations.\n\nIn 1952, Dr. von Bretano was unanimously elected president of the six‐nation Schuman Plan committee that drafted the statute for the European Econamic Community.\n\nHe emphasized his belief in the need for unity when he remarked that the frontiers of Europe “belong to the museums —in an age when a plane flies from London to Rome in two hours by passing over eight different nations.”\n\nDr. von Brentano, who was once regarded as Chancellor Adenauer's crown prince, became Foreign Minister in May, 1955. An observer at the time remarked that the two men were amazingly alike in their views of most of the major foreign‐policy questions affecting West Germany.\n\nA Western diplomat, alluding to Dr. Adenauer's and Dr. von Brentano's view that their country's destiny was tied to the political unity of Western Europe, said:\n\n“Von Brentano is the better European, for he believes in it with his heart and not mainly as a means of suppressing another possible outburst of German nationalism.”\n\nAs Foreign Minister, Dr. von Brentano inspired a fierce loyalty in those who worked closely with him. However, one official voiced a criticism sometimes shared by others that the Foreign Minister took “the airs of a grand seigneur.”\n\nIn 1961, Dr. von Brentano was succeeded as Foreign Minister by Dr. Gerhard Schröder and subsequently became the Christian Democrats' parliamentary leader again. Something of the former Foreign Minister's character and method was disclosed in this observation:\n\n“He does not strike a spark in large audiences or any time he reads a speech. But in a small group, chain‐smoking and sipping whisky, he reveals the sharp incisiveness that made him a successful lawyer.”"
