They started as A-movies, original adaptations of the novels, when Fox Studios first produced them. However, Author Earl Derr Biggers only penned six Charlie Chan novels before his death. So after their fifth Chan film, Fox decided to take their detective around the world in B-movies; low budget films made in record time with little financial backing. And the series continued that way later with 20th Century-Fox and Monogram Pictures Corporation. Still, these reels of “gold dust” hosted some significant co-stars and became a worldwide film phenomenon.

If you’d like to see the entire list of actors and actresses (including animals,) who starred in the 44 Charlie Chan films from 1931 to 1949, just visit Rush Glick’s alphabetical “Cast List” page at The Charlie Chan Family Home. Here’s a peek at some who joined Detective Chan on his crusades for justice (on both sides of the law!):

A: LIONEL ATWELL, (aka: Professor Moriarty.)

B: J. EDWARD BROMBERG.

C: RITA CANSINO, (aka: Rita Hayworth,) CARROLL, LEO G., (aka: Mr. Waverly of U.N.C.L.E.) CHANEY JR., LON (aka: The Wolfman.)

D: DOUGLAS DUMBRILLE.

E: DICK ELLIOT.

F: STEPIN FETCHIT. (Hollywood’s first successful black film star).

G: HENRY C. GORDON.

H: SHEMP HOWARD, (aka: Shemp of The Three Stooges. [A Panama Hat tip to Greg Giordano].)

V: EDDIE VITCH, (aka: caricaturist and mime artist, who’s hundreds of images of Hollywood stars adorned the Brown Derby, 1628 North Vine Street in Hollywood, which became famous for the caricatures that filled its walls.)

W: ROLAND WINTERS, (aka: Charlie Chan, 6 films.)

X: (this spot intentionally left blank)

Y: ROBERT YOUNG, (aka: Father Knows Best & Marcus Welby MD.)

Z: GEORGE ZUCCO, (aka: Professor Moriarty.)

There you are, some of the names you’ll find within each of the 26 letters (well, not counting “x”) on Rush Glick’s Cast List page. Now it is up to you to investigate those letters for more star-power. Call it the A-B-C Murders. I mean Mysteries, not Murders, Mysteries! (Whew, almost put my foot in it with Dame Agatha Christie’s legal department!)

“Success–what is it? A bubble that explodes when touched by human hands.”

The Black Camel, 1929, Chap 23

P.S. Did you spot my mistake? Somewhere around “K”. ANSWER: Boris Karloff played The Monster…NOT Frankenstein. Frankenstein, or Dr. Henry Frankenstein, was played by Colin Clive. The 1931 movie posters for the film all read, “Frankenstein, The Man Who Made a Monster!”
