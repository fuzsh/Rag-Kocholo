The first one – Charlie Chan Carries On (1931) – and the next three – Charlie Chan’s Chance (1932), Charlie Chan’s Greatest Case (1933), and Charlie Chan’s Courage (1934) – are all missing, lost in two fires.\n\nHowever, Fox simultaneously filmed a Spanish-language version of Charlie Chan Carries On, Eran Trece [There Were Thirteen], which survives.\n\nThe character of Charlie Chan was revived as a fondly remembered 39 episode TV series in 1957 with J Carrol Naish, The New Adventures of Charlie Chan.\n\nRoss Martin revived the character in a 1970 TV movie, The Return of Charlie Chan, a failed pilot for a new TV series, and Peter Ustinov starred in a final failed theatrical release, Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen (1981), while Peter Sellers sent up the character in Murder by Death in 1976, playing Sidney Wang,\n\n© Derek Winnert 2019 Classic Movies"
