[Probable date of Charlie’s involvement: “Early spring 1931 (two days) Note: it is possible that we can state that the action in this film takes place in early April. We might further surmise that, owing to the brightness of several night time scenes, that there was a full, bright moon over Waikiki at the time. If this were so, we can, perhaps, noting that the moon was full on the evening of April 2, 1931, venture to state that action portrayed in “The Black Camel” occurred on the above date and the following day {April 3}, a Thursday and Friday.] (THE BLACK CAMEL)\n\n1933—Joan Karnoff married Al Rogers.

However Charlie Chan’s mention of the family’s most recent child, a girl [the twelfth Chan offspring], shown in this movie in a photograph which was also presumably the same one that is seen in the next film, “Charlie Chan in London,” means that these adventures must be contiguous, or at least very close in time. Therefore, we must place the adventure depicted in “Charlie Chan’s Courage” in the year 1934, with Charlie Chan’s involvement being, due to the railroad ticket found at P.J. Madden’s house, which was clearly dated Februar4y 8, four days in the early part of February, beginning on a Thursday morning, probably the 15th, and concluding on the following Sunday evening, which may been the 18th, with Bob Crawford, who mentioned the dates perhaps having been confused.)
