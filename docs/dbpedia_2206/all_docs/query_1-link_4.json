        "text": "I was awed by the work done in recreating this \"lost\" Charlie Chan movie. Using the original script and still photos of the cast, a team recreated the movie. Of course, the voices were not original, the essential background noise likewise. However, both were necessary in bringing to life this (sadly) lost work. Remember, there is no \"action,\" just the photos of the actors in each scene and the created audio, but it's enough to understand the plot and follow it through to the solving of the case. I am impressed by the dedication shown here in what must have been a laborious job. I am so grateful to artists, naturalists, etc. who are willing to take on such challenges in order to bring to us viewers glimpses of art, nature, science, etc. that we would never otherwise experience."
