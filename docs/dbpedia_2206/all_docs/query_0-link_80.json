        "text": "A large (23\" x 37\") floating head painting of Warner Oland as Charlie Chan, done in preproduction and used in a May 20, 1931 trade ad in VARIETY announcing this film and a \"2nd Chan\" to be directed by Benjamin Stoloff. This piece was painted by Norton Gaston and used at the Fox West Coast Theater premiere of the film. The image of the Egyptian Theater shows how these large Gaston paintings were used at first run picture palaces along side the printed studio issued paper.\n\nInteresting to note is that the next Chan film mentioned in the ad was not helmed by Stoloff and that it would be nearly two years before another Chan film was released."
