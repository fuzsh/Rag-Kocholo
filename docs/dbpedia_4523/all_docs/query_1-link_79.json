        "text": "The annual Arizona Bowl might not be considered one of the biggest bowl games in college football, but it might now have its most famous sponsor.\n\nRapper/entertainer Snoop Dogg and his drink brand “Gin & Juice by Dre and Snoop” — co-founded along with Dr. Dre and named after the hit song in the ’90s — on Monday agreed to become the newest title sponsor of the Arizona Bowl on Dec. 28.\n\nThe game will now be known as “The Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl presented by Gin & Juice.”\n\nThe game will feature teams from the Mountain West and Mid-American Conferences.\n\n\"I’m ready to bring the juice back to college football,” Snoop Dogg said in a video posted on his social media channels.\n\nSnoop Dogg isn’t the first celebrity to sponsor a bowl game, as former NFL player Rob Gronkowski and talk show host Jimmy Kimmel are sponsors for the L.A. Bowl.\n\nSo, college football fans, what do you think?\n\nIs this a neat thing for the sport? What other celebrities would you like to see jump on board and sponsor a bowl game?\n\nLet us know below."
