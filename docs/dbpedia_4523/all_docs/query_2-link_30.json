        "text": "Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. (born October 20, 1971), known professionally as Snoop Dogg,[note 1] is an African-American rapper, singer, record producer, television personality, entrepreneur, and actor. His music career began in 1992 when he was discovered by Dr. Dreand featured on Dre's solo debut, \"Deep Cover\", and then on Dre's solo debut album, The Chronic. He has since sold over 23 million albums in the United States and 35 million albums worldwide.[4][5][6]\n\nSnoop's debut album, Doggystyle, produced by Dr. Dre, was released in 1993 by Death Row Records. Bolstered by excitement driven by Snoop's featuring on The Chronic, the album debuted at number one on both the Billboard 200 and Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. Selling almost a million copies in the first week of its release, Doggystyle became certified quadruple platinum in 1994 and spawned several hit singles, including \"What's My Name?\" and \"Gin & Juice\". In 1994 Snoop released a soundtrack on Death Row Records for the short film Murder Was the Case, starring himself. His second album, Tha Doggfather (1996), also debuted at number one on both charts, with \"Snoop's Upside Ya Head\" as the lead single. The album was certified double platinum in 1997.\n\nAfter leaving Death Row Records, Snoop signed with No Limit Records, where he recorded his next three albums, Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told (1998), No Limit Top Dogg (1999), and Tha Last Meal (2000). Snoop then signed with Priority/Capitol/EMI Records in 2002, where he released Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss. He then signed with Geffen Records in 2004 for his next three albums, R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece, Tha Blue Carpet Treatment, and Ego Trippin'. Malice 'n Wonderland (2009), and Doggumentary (2011) were released on Priority. Snoop Dogg has starred in motion pictures and hosted several television shows, including Doggy Fizzle Televizzle, Snoop Dogg's Father Hood, and Dogg After Dark. He also coaches a youth football league and high school football team. In September 2009 Snoop was hired by EMI as the chairman of a reactivated Priority Records.[7]\n\nIn 2012, after a trip to Jamaica, Snoop announced a conversion to Rastafarianism and a new alias, Snoop Lion. As Snoop Lion he released a reggae album, Reincarnated, and a documentary film of the same name, about his Jamaican experience, in early 2013. His 13th studio album, Bush, was released in May 2015 and marked a return of the Snoop Dogg name. His 14th solo studio album, Coolaid, was released in July 2016. Snoop has 17 Grammynominations without a win. In March 2016, the night before WrestleMania 32 in Arlington, Texas, he was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame, having made several appearances for the company, including as Master of Ceremonies during a match at WrestleMania XXIV.[8] In 2018, he released his first gospel album, Bible of Love. On November 19, 2018, Snoop Dogg was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[9]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nCalvin Cordozar Broadus Jr.[10][11] was born in Long Beach, California,[11][12] the second of three sons.[13] He was named after his stepfather, Calvin Cordozar Broadus Sr. His mother is Beverly Broadus (née Tate).[14][15][16] His father, Vernell Varnado,[15] was a Vietnam veteran, singer, and mail carrier who was frequently absent from his life.[17] As a boy, Broadus's parents nicknamed him \"Snoopy\" because of his appearance but usually addressed him as Calvin at home.[12][18]His mother and stepfather divorced in 1975. When he was very young, Broadus began singing and playing piano at Golgotha Trinity Baptist Church. In sixth grade, he began rapping.[19][20] Broadus's father left the family when he was three months old. A DNA test read by George Lopez on Lopez Tonight revealed Broadus to be of 71% African, 23% Native American, and 6% Europeandescent.[21]\n\nAs a teenager, Broadus frequently ran into trouble with the law. He was a member of the Rollin' 20 Crips gang in the Eastside area of Long Beach,[22][23]although he stated in 1993 that he never joined a gang.[19] Shortly after graduating from high school, he was arrested for possession of cocaine, and for the next three years was frequently in and out of prison (including Wayside Jail).[12] With his cousins Nate Dogg and Lil' ½ Dead and friend Warren G, Snoop recorded homemade tapes as a group called 213, named after the Long Beach area code. One of his early solo freestyles over En Vogue's \"Hold On\" made it to a mixtape that was heard by influential producer Dr. Dre, who called to invite him to an audition. Former N.W.A associate The D.O.C. taught him how to structure his lyrics and separate the thematics into verses, hooks, and chorus.[24]\n\nMusical career[]\n\n1991–1997: Death Row, Doggystyle, and Tha Doggfather[]\n\nWhen he began recording, Broadus took the stage name Snoop Doggy Dogg. Dr. Dre began working with Snoop Dogg, first on the theme song of the 1992 film Deep Cover, and then on Dr. Dre's debut solo album The Chronic with the other members of his former starting group, Tha Dogg Pound. The huge success of Snoop Dogg's debut Doggystyle was partially because of this intense exposure.[12]\n\nFueling the ascendance of West Coast G-funk hip hop, the singles \"Who Am I (What's My Name)?\" and \"Gin and Juice\" reached the top ten most-played songs in the United States, and the album stayed on the Billboard charts for several months.[12] Gangsta rap became the center of arguments about censorship and labeling, with Snoop Dogg often used as an example of violent and misogynisticmusicians.[25] Unlike much of the harder-edged gangsta rap artists, Snoop Dogg seemed to show his softer side, according to music journalist Chuck Philips. Rolling Stone music critic Touré asserted that Snoop had a relatively soft vocal delivery compared to other rappers: \"Snoop's vocal style is part of what distinguishes him: where many rappers scream, figuratively and literally, he speaks softly.\"[19] Doggystyle, much like The Chronic, featured a host of rappers signed to or affiliated with the Death Row label including Daz Dillinger, Kurupt, Nate Dogg, and others.\n\nA short film about Snoop Dogg's murder trial, Murder Was the Case, was released in 1994, along with an accompanying soundtrack. On July 6, 1995, Doggy Style Records, Inc., a record label founded by Snoop Dogg, was registered with the California Secretary of State as business entity number C1923139.[26]\n\nAfter Snoop Dogg was acquitted of murder on February 20, 1996, he, the mother of his son, and their kennel of 20 pit bulls moved into a 5,000-square-foot (460 m2) home in the hills of Claremont, California and by August 1996 Doggy Style Records, a subsidiary of Death Row Records, signed the Gap Band's Charlie Wilson as one of its first artists.[27] He collaborated with fellow rap artist Tupac Shakur on the 1996 single 2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted. This was one of Shakur's last songs while alive; he was shot on September 7, 1996, in Las Vegas, dying 6 days later.\n\nBy the time Snoop Dogg's second album, Tha Doggfather, was released in November 1996, the price of living (or sometimes just imitating) the gangsta life had become very evident. Among the many notable hip hop industry deaths and convictions were the death of Snoop Dogg's friend and labelmate Tupac Shakurand the racketeering indictment of Death Row co-founder Suge Knight.[12] Dr. Dre had left Death Row earlier in 1996 because of a contract dispute, so Snoop Dogg co-produced Tha Doggfather with Daz Dillinger and DJ Pooh.\n\nThis album featured a distinct change of style from Doggystyle, and the leadoff single, \"Snoop's Upside Ya Head\", featured a collaboration with Charlie Wilson. The album sold reasonably well but was not as successful as its predecessor. Tha Doggfather had a somewhat softer approach to the G-funk style. After Dr. Dre withdrew from Death Row Records, Snoop realized that he was subject to an ironclad time-based contract (i.e., that Death Row practically owned anything he produced for a number of years), and refused to produce any more tracks for Suge Knight other than the insulting \"Fuck Death Row\" until his contract expired.[22] In an interview with Neil Strauss in 1998, Snoop Dogg said that though he had been given lavish gifts by his former label, they had withheld his royalty payments.[28]\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that after Tha Doggfather, Snoop Dogg began \"moving away from his gangsta roots toward a calmer lyrical aesthetic\":[12] for instance, Snoop participated in the 1997 Lollapalooza concert tour, which featured mainly alternative rock music. Troy J. Augusto of Varietynoticed that Snoop's set at Lollapalooza attracted \"much dancing, and, strangely, even a small mosh pit\" in the audience.[29]\n\n1998–2006: Signing with No Limit and continued success[]\n\nSnoop signed with Master P's No Limit Records (distributed by Priority/EMI Records) in 1998 and debuted on the label with Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told that year. His other albums on No Limit were No Limit Top Dogg in 1999 (selling over 1,503,865 copies) and Tha Last Meal in 2000 (selling over 2,000,000).[12] In 1999, his autobiography, Tha Doggfather, was published.\n\nIn 2002, he released the album Paid tha Cost to Be da Bo$$, on Priority/Capitol/EMI, selling over 1,300,000 copies. The album featured the hit singles \"From tha Chuuuch to da Palace\" and \"Beautiful\", featuring guest vocals by Pharrell. By this stage in his career, Snoop Dogg had left behind his \"gangster\" image and embraced a \"pimp\" image.\n\nIn 2004, Snoop signed to Geffen Records/Star Trak Entertainment, both distributed by Interscope Records; Star Trak is headed by producer duo the Neptunes, which produced several tracks for Snoop's 2004 release R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece. \"Drop It Like It's Hot\" (featuring Pharrell), the first single released from the album, was a hit and became Snoop Dogg's first single to reach number one. His third release was \"Signs\", featuring Justin Timberlakeand Charlie Wilson, which entered the UK chart at No. 2. This was his highest entry ever in the UK chart. The album sold 1,724,000 copies in the U.S. alone, and most of its singles were heavily played on radio and television. Snoop Dogg joined Warren G and Nate Dogg to form the group 213 and released The Hard Way in 2004. Debuting at No.4 on the Billboard 200 and No.1 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, it included the single \"Groupie Luv\". Snoop Dogg appeared in the music video for Korn's \"Twisted Transistor\" along with fellow rappers Lil Jon, Xzibit, and David Banner,\n\nSnoop Dogg appeared on two tracks from Ice Cube's 2006 album Laugh Now, Cry Later, including \"Go to Church\", and on several tracks on Tha Dogg Pound's Cali Iz Active the same year. His song \"Real Talk\" was leaked on the Internet in the summer of 2006 and a video was later released on the Internet. \"Real Talk\" was dedicated to former Crips leader Stanley \"Tookie\" Williams and a diss to Arnold Schwarzenegger, the governor of California. Two other singles on which Snoop made a guest performance were \"Keep Bouncing\" by Too $hort (also with will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas) and \"Gangsta Walk\" by Coolio.\n\nSnoop's 2006 album Tha Blue Carpet Treatment debuted on the Billboard 200 at No.5 and sold over 850,000 copies. The album and the second single \"That's That Shit\" featuring R. Kelly were well received by critics. In the album, he collaborated in a video with E-40 and other West Coast rappers on the single \"Candy (Drippin' Like Water)\".\n\n2007–2012: Ego Trippin', Malice n Wonderland and Doggumentary[]\n\nIn July 2007, Snoop Dogg made history by becoming the first artist to release a track as a ringtone before its release as a single, \"It's the D.O.G.\" On July 7, 2007, Snoop Dogg performed at the Live Earth concert, Hamburg.[30] Snoop Dogg has ventured into singing for Bollywood with his first ever rap for an Indian movie, Singh Is Kinng; the song title is also \"Singh is Kinng\". He appears in the movie as himself.[31] The album featuring the song was released on June 8, 2008 on Junglee Music Records.[32] He released his ninth studio album, Ego Trippin'(selling 400,000 copies in the U.S.), along with the first single, \"Sexual Eruption\". The single peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard 100, featuring Snoop using autotune. The album featured production from QDT (Quik-Dogg-Teddy).\n\nSnoop was appointed an executive position at Priority Records. His tenth studio album, Malice n Wonderland, was released on December 8, 2009. The first single from the album, \"Gangsta Luv\", featuring The-Dream, peaked at No.35 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album debuted at No.23 on the Billboard 200, selling 61,000 copies its first week, making it his lowest charting album. His third single, \"I Wanna Rock\", peaked at No.41 on the Billboard Hot 100. The fourth single from Malice n Wonderland, titled \"Pronto\", featuring Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, was released on iTunes on December 1, 2009. Snoop re-released the album under the name More Malice.\n\nSnoop collaborated with Katy Perry on \"California Gurls\", the first single from her album Teenage Dream, which was released on May 11, 2010. Snoop can also be heard on the track \"Flashing\" by Dr. Dre and on Curren$y's song \"Seat Change\". He was also featured on a new single from Australian singer Jessica Mauboy, titled \"Get 'em Girls\" (released September 2010). Snoop's latest effort was backing American recording artist, Emii, on her second single entitled \"Mr. Romeo\" (released October 26, 2010 as a follow-up to \"Magic\"). Snoop also collaborated with American comedy troupe the Lonely Island in their song \"Turtleneck & Chain\", in their 2011 album Turtleneck & Chain.\n\nSnoop Dogg's eleventh studio album is Doggumentary. The album went through several tentative titles including Doggystyle 2: Tha Doggumentary and Doggumentary Music: 0020 before being released under the final title Doggumentary during March 2011.[33] Snoop was featured on Gorillaz' album Plastic Beach on a track called: \"Welcome to the World of the Plastic Beach\" with the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble, he also completed another track with them entitled \"Sumthing Like This Night\" which does not appear on Plastic Beach, yet does appear on Doggumentary. He also appears on the latest Tech N9ne album All 6's and 7's (released June 7, 2011) on a track called \"Pornographic\" which also features E-40 and Krizz Kaliko.\n\n2012–2013: Reincarnated and 7 Days of Funk[]\n\nOn February 4, 2012, Snoop Dogg announced a documentary, Reincarnated, alongside his new upcoming studio album entitled Reincarnated.

He hadn't written nothing down. He just came in and started busting. The song was \"Tha Shiznit\"—that was all freestyle. He started busting and when we got to the break, Dre cut the machine off, did the chorus and told Snoop to come back in. He did that throughout the record. That's when Snoop was in the zone then.\"\n\nPeter Shapiro says that Snoop debuted on \"Deep Cover\" with a \"shockingly original flow – which sounded like a Slick Rick born in South Carolina instead of South London\"[77] and adds that he \"showed where his style came from by covering Slick Rick's 'La Di Da Di'\".[74] Referring to Snoop's flow, Kool Moe Deecalls him \"one of the smoothest, funkiest flow-ers in the game\".[73] How to Rapalso notes that Snoop is known to use syncopation in his flow to give it a laidback quality,[78] as well as 'linking with rhythm' in his compound rhymes,[79]using alliteration,[80] and employing a \"sparse\" flow with good use of pauses.[81]\n\nSnoop re-popularized the use of -izzle speak, particularly in the pop and hip-hop music industry.[82]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nSnoop married his high school sweetheart, Shante Taylor, on June 12, 1997. On May 21, 2004, he filed for divorce from Taylor, citing irreconcilable differences.[83] The couple renewed their wedding vows on January 12, 2008.[84]They have three children together: sons Cordé (born August 21, 1994) and Cordell (born February 21, 1997), who quit football to pursue a career as a film maker, and daughter Cori (born June 22, 1999).[citation needed] Snoop also has a son from a relationship with Laurie Holmond, Julian Corrie Broadus (born 1998).

It was like shootin' layups for me. I was makin' 'em every time.\" He went on to say that on the advice of some of the pimps he knew, he eventually gave up pimping to spend more time with his family.[22]\n\nSports[]\n\nSnoop is an avid sports fan, including hometown teams Los Angeles Dodgers, Los Angeles Lakers, and USC Trojans, as well as the Pittsburgh Steelers.[92] He has stated that he began following the Steelers in the 1970s while watching the team with his grandfather.[93] He is also a fan of the Oakland Raiders, Los Angeles Rams, and Dallas Cowboys, often wearing a No. 5 jersey, and has been seen at Raiders training camps.[94] He has shown affection for the New England Patriots, having been seen performing at Gillette Stadium.[95][96] He is an avid ice hockey fan,[citation needed] sporting jerseys from the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguinsand the AHL's Springfield Indians (now the Utica Comets) in his 1994 music video \"Gin and Juice\". On his reality show Snoop Dogg's Father Hood, Snoop and his family received hockey lessons from the Anaheim Ducks, then returned to the Honda Center to cheer on the Ducks against the Vancouver Canucks in the episode \"Snow in da Hood\".[97]\n\nSnoop is a certified football coach and has been head coach of his son Cordell's youth football teams and the John A. Rowland High School team.[98][99] Cordell played wide receiver and defensive back at Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas, Nevada, and received football scholarship offers from Southern California, UCLA, Washington, Cal, Oregon State, Duke, and Notre Dame.[100][101][102][103][104][105] Cordell committed and signed a letter of intent to play for UCLA on February 4, 2015.[106] On August 14, 2015, UCLA announced that Cordell had left the UCLA football team \"to pursue other passions in his life\".[107]\n\nReligion[]\n\nIn 2009, it was reported that Snoop was a member of the Nation of Islam. On March 1, he made an appearance at the Nation of Islam's annual Saviours' Dayholiday, where he praised minister Louis Farrakhan. Snoop said he was a member of the Nation, but declined to give the date on which he joined. He also donated $1,000 to the organization.[108][109][110]\n\nClaiming to be \"born again\" in 2012, Snoop converted to the Rastafari movement,[111][112][113][114] switched the focus of his music to reggae[115] and changed his name to Snoop Lion after a trip to Jamaica. He released a reggae album, Reincarnated, saying, \"I have always said I was Bob Marleyreincarnated\".[116]\n\nIn January 2013, he received criticism from members of the Rastafarian community in Jamaica, including reggae artist Bunny Wailer, for alleged failure to meet his commitments to the culture.[117] Snoop later dismissed the claims, stating his beliefs were personal and not up for outside judgment.[118] Wailer is credited for giving Snoop the name \"Lion\".[118]\n\nCharity[]\n\nDogg partners with city officials and annually gives away turkeys to the less fortunate in Inglewood, California at Thanksgiving. He gave away 3000 turkeys in 2016.[119]\n\nPolitics[]\n\nIn 2012, Snoop Dogg endorsed Representative Ron Paul in the Republican presidential primary,[120] but later said he would vote for Barack Obama in the general election, and on Instagram gave ten reasons to vote for Obama (including \"He a black black person\", \"He's BFFs with Jay-Z\", and \"Michelle got a fat ass\"), and ten reasons not to vote for Mitt Romney (including \"He a white black person\", \"That muthafucka's name is Mitt\", and \"He a ho\").[121]\n\nIn an interview with The Huffington Post, Snoop Dogg came out in support of same-sex marriage, saying, \"people can do what they want.\"[122]\n\nIn his keynote address at the 2015 South by Southwest music festival, he blamed Los Angeles's explosion of gang violence in the 1980s on the economic policies of Ronald Reagan, and insinuated that his administration shipped guns and drugs into the area.[123]\n\nHe endorsed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in May 2016, saying, \"I would love to see a woman in office because I feel like we’re at that stage in life to where we need a perspective other than the male's train of thought ... [and] just to have a woman speaking from a global perspective as far as representing America, I’d love to see that. So I’ll be voting for Ms. Clinton.\"[124]\n\nAnimal welfare[]\n\nSnoop Dogg regularly appears in real fur garments, especially large coats, for which he attracts criticism from animal welfare charities and younger audiences. In a vodcast in 2012, the rapper asked \"Why doesn't PETA throw paint on a pimp's fur coat.\".[125] In 2014, Snoop Dogg claimed to have become a vegan, although he was filmed wearing fur less than a year later.[126] In June 2018, he performed at the Environmental Media Association (EMA) Honors Gala, while on the screens behind him, the logo for Beyond Meat was displayed.[127]\n\nBusiness ventures and investments[]\n\nBroadus has been an active entrepreneur and investor. In 2009, he was appointed creative chairman of Priority Records.[128]\n\nIn April 2015, Broadus became a minority investor in his first investment venture Eaze, a California-based weed delivery startup that promises to deliver medical marijuana to persons doorstep in less than 10 minutes.[129][130][131]\n\nIn October 2015, Broadus launched his new digital media business, Merry Jane, that focuses on news about marijuana. \"Merry Jane is cannabis 2.0\", he said in a promotional video for the media source. \"A crossroads of pot culture, business, politics, health.\"[132]\n\nIn November 2015, Broadus announced his new brand of cannabis productsLeafs By Snoop. The line of branded products includes marijuana flowers, concentrates and edibles. \"Leafs By Snoop is truly the first mainstream cannabis brand in the world and proud to be a pioneer\", Snoop Dogg said. \"LBS is blazing a trail for the industry.\" In such a way, Broadus became the first major celebrity to brand and market a line of legal marijuana products.[133]\n\nBroadus and his brand manager Nick Adler released an app, Snoopify that lets users plaster stickers of Snoop's face, joints or a walrus hat on photos. Adler built the app in May after discovering stickers in Japan. The app currently generates $30,000 in weekly sales.[134]\n\nOn March 30, 2016, Broadus was reported to purchase the famed soul food restaurant chain Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles out of bankruptcy.[135]\n\nWorld records[]\n\nOn May 27, 2018, Snoop Dogg set the Guinness World Record for the largest Paradise cocktail. Concocted at the BottleRock Napa Valley music festival, the \"Gin and Juice\" drink measured over 132 gallons and \"contained 180 bottles of gin, 154 bottles of apricot brandy and 38 jugs of orange juice\".[136]\n\nLegal incidents[]\n\nShortly after graduating from high school, Broadus was arrested for possession of cocaine and for the following three years was frequently in and out of prison.[12] In 1990, he was convicted of felony possession of drugs and possession for sale.[137]\n\nWhile recording Doggystyle in August 1993, Snoop Dogg was arrested in connection with the death of Philip Woldemariam, a member of a rival gang who was shot and killed by Snoop's bodyguard, McKinley Lee; Snoop was charged with murder along with Lee as he was driving the vehicle from which the shooting took place. Snoop and Lee were defended by Johnnie Cochran.[138]Both Snoop and Lee were acquitted; Lee was acquitted on grounds of self-defense, but Snoop Dogg remained entangled in the legal battles around the case for three years.[139]\n\nIn July 1993, Snoop was stopped for a traffic violation and a firearm was found by police while conducting a search of his car. In February 1997, he pleaded guilty to possession of a handgun and was ordered to record three public service announcements, pay a $1,000 fine, and serve three years' probation.[140][141][142]\n\nSnoop Dogg, Tha Dogg Pound, and The Game were sued for assaulting a fan on stage at a May 2005 concert at the White River Amphitheatre in Auburn, Washington. The accuser, Richard Monroe Jr., claimed he was beaten by the artists' entourage while mounting the stage, allegedly after an \"open invite\".[143]The lawsuit, which sought $22 million in damages, was dismissed in 2009.[144]\n\nIn September 2006, Snoop Dogg was detained at John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California by airport security, after airport screeners found a collapsible police baton in Snoop's carry-on bag. Donald Etra, Snoop's lawyer, told deputies the baton was a prop for a musical sketch. Snoop was sentenced to three years' probation and 160 hours of community service for the incident starting in September 2007.[145] Snoop Dogg was arrested again October 2006 at Bob Hope Airport in Burbank after being stopped for a traffic infraction; he was arrested for possession of a firearm and for suspicion of transporting an unspecified amount of marijuana, according to a police statement. The following month, after taping an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, he was arrested again for possession of marijuana, cocaine and a firearm. Two members of Snoop's entourage, according to the Burbank police statement, were admitted members of the Rollin 20's Crips gang, and were arrested on separate charges.[146] In April 2007, he was sentenced to a three-year suspended sentence, five years' probation, and was required to perform 800 hours of community service after pleading no contest to two felony charges of drug and gun possession by a convicted felon. He was also prohibited from hiring anyone with a criminal record or gang affiliation as a security guard or a driver.[137]\n\nIn April 26, 2006, Snoop Dogg and members of his entourage were arrested after being turned away from British Airways' first class lounge at Heathrow Airport. Snoop and his party were denied entry to the lounge due to some members flying in economy class. After being escorted outside, the group vandalized a duty-free shop with whiskey bottles. Seven police officers were injured in the midst of the disturbance. After a night in jail, Snoop and the other men were released on bail the next day, but he was unable to perform a scheduled concert in Johannesburg.[147] On May 15, the Home Office decided that Snoop Dogg would be denied entry to the United Kingdom for the foreseeable future, and his British visa was denied the following year.[148][149][150]As of March 2010, Snoop Dogg has been allowed back into the UK.[151] The group involved in the incident have been banned by British Airways for \"the foreseeable future.\"[152]\n\nIn April 2007, the Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship banned him from entering the country on character grounds, citing his prior criminal convictions. He had been scheduled to appear at the MTV Australia Video Music Awards on April 29, 2007.[153] Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship lifted the ban in September 2008 and had granted him visa to tour Australia. DIAC said: \"In making this decision, the department weighed his criminal convictions against his previous behaviour while in Australia, recent conduct – including charity work – and any likely risk to the Australian community ... We took into account all relevant factors and, on balance, the department decided to grant the visa.\"[154]\n\nHe was banned from entering Norway for two years in July 2012 after entering the country the month before in possession of 8 grams of marijuana and an undeclared 227,000 kr in cash, or about US$24,900 as of August 2018.[155][156][157]\n\nSnoop Dogg has also been arrested and fined for misdemeanor marijuana possession in Los Angeles in 1998,[158] in Cleveland in 2001,[159] and Sierra Blanca, Texas in 2010.[160]\n\nSnoop Dogg, after performing for a concert in Uppsala, Sweden on July 25, 2015, was pulled over and detained by Swedish police for allegedly using illegal drugs, violating a Swedish law enacted in 1988, which criminalized the recreational use of such substances – therefore even being under the influence of any illegal/controlled substance a crime in itself even without possession. During the detention, he was taken to the police station to perform a drug test and was released shortly afterwards. The rapid test was positive for traces of narcotics, and he was potentially subject to fines depending on the results of more detailed analysis, which were expected to be completed within several weeks.[161] The rapper uploaded several videos on the social networking site Instagram, criticizing the police for alleged racial profiling; police spokesman Daniel Nilsson responded to the accusations, saying, \"we don't work like that in Sweden\". He declared in the videos, \"black person as got me in the back of police car right now in Sweden, cuz\", and \"Pulled a black person over for nothing, taking us to the station where I've got to go pee in a cup for nothin'. I ain't done nothin'. All I did was came to the country and did a concert, and now I've got to go to the police station. For nothin'!\" He announced to his Swedish fanbase that he would no longer go on tour in the country due to the incident.[162][163][164]\n\nIn the Death Row Records bankruptcy case, Snoop Dogg lost $2 million.[165]\n\nDiscography[]\n\nMain article: Snoop Dogg discography\n\nSee also: 213 discography, Tha Dogg Pound discography, and Tha Eastsidaz discography\n\nStudio albums[]\n\nDoggystyle (1993)\n\nTha Doggfather (1996)\n\nDa Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told (1998)\n\nNo Limit Top Dogg (1999)\n\nTha Last Meal (2000)\n\nPaid tha Cost to Be da Boss (2002)\n\nR&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece (2004)\n\nTha Blue Carpet Treatment (2006)\n\nEgo Trippin' (2008)\n\nMalice n Wonderland (2009)\n\nDoggumentary (2011)\n\nReincarnated (2013)\n\nBush (2015)\n\nCoolaid (2016)\n\nNeva Left (2017)\n\nBible of Love (2018)[166]\n\nCollaboration albums[]\n\nTha Eastsidaz with Tha Eastsidaz (2000)\n\nDuces 'n Trayz: The Old Fashioned Way with Tha Eastsidaz (2001)\n\nThe Hard Way with 213 (2004)\n\nMac & Devin Go to High School with Wiz Khalifa (2011)\n\n7 Days of Funk with 7 Days of Funk (2013)\n\nRoyal Fam with Tha Broadus Boyz (2013)[44]\n\nCuzznz with Daz Dillinger (2016)\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilms Year Title Role Notes 1994 Murder Was the Case Himself Main role 1996 A Thin Line Between Love and Hate Himself Cameo appearance 1998 Half Baked Scavenger Smoker 1999 The Wrecking Crew Dra-Man Main role 2000 Hot Boyz C-Dawg 2000 Up in Smoke Tour Himself Concert film 2001 Training Day Blue 2001 Baby Boy Rodney 2001 Bones Jimmy Bones Main role 2001 The Wash Dee Loc Main role 2003 Old School Himself Cameo 2003 Malibu's Most Wanted Ronnie Rizzat Voice role 2004 Starsky & Hutch Huggy Bear Brown 2004 Soul Plane Captain Antoine Mack 2005 Racing Stripes Lightning Voice role 2005 The Tenants Willie Spearmint Main role 2007 Arthur and the Invisibles Max Voice role 2008 Singh is Kinng Himself Bollywood Movie 2009 Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder Himself Voice role 2009 Falling Up Raul 2009 Brüno Himself 2009 Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard Max Voice role 2011 The Big Bang Puss 2012 We the Party Big D 2012 Mac & Devin Go to High School Mac Johnson Main role 2013 Turbo Smooth Move Voice role 2013 Reincarnated Himself Documentary 2013 Scary Movie 5 Ja'Marcus 2014 The Distortion of Sound Himself 2015 Pitch Perfect 2 Himself 2015 Dispensary Mac Johnson Main role 2015 The Culture High Himself 2016 Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping Himself 2017 Grow House Himself 2018 Future World Love Lord\n\nTelevision Year Title Role Notes 1997 The Steve Harvey Show Himself Episode \"I Do, I Don't\" 2001 King of the Hill Alabaster Jones Episode \"Ho Yeah!\" 2001 Just Shoot Me Himself Episode \"Finch in the Dogg House\" 2002–2003 Doggy Fizzle Televizzle Himself 8 episodes 2003 Playmakers Big E Episode \"Tenth of a Second\" 2003 Crank Yankers Himself Episode \"Snoop Dogg & Kevin Nealon\" 2004 Chappelle's Show Puppet Dangle/Himself Episode 10 2004 Las Vegas Himself Episode \"Two of a Kind\" 2004 The Bernie Mac Show Calvin Episode \"Big Brother\" 2004 The L Word Slim Daddy Episodes \"Luck, Next Time\" & \"Liberally\" 2004 2004 Spike Video Game Awards Host/Himself TV special 2006 Weeds Himself Episode \"MILF Money\" 2007–2009 Snoop Dogg's Father Hood Himself 2 seasons, 18 episodes 2007 Monk Murderuss Episode \"Mr. Monk and the Rapper\" 2008, 2010, 2013 One Life to Live Himself 3 episodes, wrote and produced theme song[167] 2009 Dogg After Dark Himself 1 season, 7 episodes 2009 WWE Raw Host/Himself TV special 2010 The Boondocks Macktastic Episode \"Bitches to Rags\" 2010 Big Time Rush Himself Episode \"Big Time Christmas\" 2011 90210 Himself Episode \"Blue Naomi\" 2011 The Cleveland Show Himself Episode \"Back to Cool\" 2014 Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta Himself Guest Appearance 2014 Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood Himself Guest Appearance 2015 Snoop & Son, a Dad's Dream Himself 1 season, 5 episodes 2015 Sanjay and Craig[168] Street Dogg Episode \"Street Dogg\" 2015 Show Me the Money 4[169] Himself Episode 4 2016 Trailer Park Boys Himself Episode \"Up In Smoke We Go\", \"The Super Bling Cowboy\", \"Thugged out Gangsta Sh*t\" 2016–present Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party Himself Co-host 2017 The Simpsons Himself Episode \"The Great Phatsby\" 2017 Growing Up Hip Hop: Atlanta Himself Guest Appearances 2017 The Joker's WildPresented by Snoop Dogg Himself Host 2018 Sugar Himself Episode: \"Snoop Dogg surprises a young father who is working to turn his life around.\"\n\nVideo games Year Title Role Notes 2025 Nickelodeon vs. Disney: Ultimate All-Stars Himself DJ/Musician/Music Club Host\n\nRoles in Ideas Wiki[]"
