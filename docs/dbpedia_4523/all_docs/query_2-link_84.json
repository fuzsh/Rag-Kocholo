        "text": "Snoop Dogg has admitted to not having voted in an election before as he believed his criminal record meant that he was not allowed to.\n\nHowever, the “Drop It Like It’s Hot” rapper now intends to hit the polls for the first time this November.\n\nDuring an appearance on Real 93.3’s Big Boy’s Neighbourhood, Snoop, who was convicted of drug possession in 1990 and gun and drug charges in 2007, said he was “brainwashed” into thinking that “you couldn’t vote because you had a criminal record”.\n\n“I didn’t know that. My record’s been expunged so now I can vote” the 48-year-old explained.\n\n“I ain’t never voted a day in my life, but this year I think I’m going to get out and vote because I can’t stand to see this punk in office one more year,” he said of Donald Trump and his battle against Democrat candidate Joe Biden to stay in the White House.\n\nSnoop said he would encourage his fans to vote in November by leading by example.\n\n“We got to make a difference, I can’t talk about it and not be about it,” he said. “I can’t tell you to do it and then not go do it. If I tell you to do something, I done it already.”\n\nDuring the interview, Snoop also spoke out about the Black Lives Matter protests which have erupted across the US in response to police brutality and systemic racism.\n\nWhile he pledged his support of the movement, he asked that people stay safe from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“We're dealing with the pandemic too, and I don't think that is fully going away,” he pointed out.\n\n“People are quick to jump into the streets and not knowing what the full, you know, thing is with that right now. So I just want to let everybody know to be careful and be safe and keep your mask on. Stay hydrated, stay [hygenic].\""
