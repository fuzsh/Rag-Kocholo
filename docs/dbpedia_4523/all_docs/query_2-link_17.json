        "text": "Post by Deleted on\n\nCordell Broadus should probably thank his famous father for hustling him into playing football more than a decade ago.\n\nThe son of rapper Snoop Dogg has grown to be a four-star receiver in the Class of 2015 with scholarship offers from USC, Notre Dame, LSU, Arizona State, UCLA and others.\n\nSo how did Snoop get his son into the game? By bribing him with a lot of cash when he was 6 years old.\n\n\"My father got me into football at a young age,\" Broadus said in an interview with Bleacher Report. \"He had to pay me, because I didn't really wanna play football. I was more interested in acting.\n\n\"He sat me down one day and said, 'You obviously don't want to play football, so what do I have to do to make you play?' I was like, 'Give me some money.' He said, 'How much?' I said $2,000 -- he gave it to me in an envelope. The next season it was $1,000, and after that it was free. He always says I'll have to pay him back when I get to the [NFL].\"\n\nIn an envelope. That kills me. What dad hands two grand to his 6-year-old son in an envelope? I guess that's how you roll if you're Snoop.\n\nLuckily, this isn't just some famous guy's son getting attention from programs hoping having an affiliation with a celebrity will help give them cred with other kids. Broadus is a good football player and will be fun to watch in college.\n\nHighlights:\n\nPost by nmerritt11 on\n\ny'all can have Snoops son...Clemson is gonna land Keyshawn Jr.\n\nHis nephew went to Ohio State (Michael Thomas).\n\nI will tell you a little known fact...Keyshawn wanted to attend Clemson but it was too far away for his family to attend games. He wanted to play there so bad he was either enrolled or was close to enrolling at Tri-county Technical College in Clemson, SC to get his grades up and then transfer into Clemson. Johnson loved everything about Clemson except one thing...he was home sick and his friends/family would not be able to watch him play his college ball.\n\nJohnson Sr. constantly tweets about Clemson and they make it a regular stop. He has visited there quite a bit and Keyshawn is calling it Wide Receiver U right now. They now have the funds where geography is not an issue. Clemson is in really good shape with Jr. right now and it should only continue as Mike Williams/Artavis Scott continue to put up big numbers with Watson slinging it and then enter five stars RayRay McCloud and Deon Cain to follow. The pipeline of Clemson WR's is really just getting started."
