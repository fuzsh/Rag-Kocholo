        "text": "FROM THE LBC to the streets of Paris (yes, silent 's'), Snoop Dogg has been taking over feeds, going viral for his Olympic coverage for NBC, and it’s the entertainment we didn’t know we needed at the games.\n\nFrom swimming laps with former Olympian Michael Phelps to riding the bus with the US Men’s Basketball team, attending the equestrian team dressage with his longtime pal Martha Stewart, and giving after-hours tours of the Louvre where he discovers he is Mona Lisa’s long-lost twin brother “Tony Lisa,” Snoop has been making his rounds across different events. He’s not only one of Team USA’s number one fans, but is also providing a taste of Parisian culture to those at home watching the games from their screens.\n\nSnoop has been enlisted by NBC as an official commentator, with his special called #Followthedogg, which is exclusively on the broadcast network’s online and social platforms, as well as on the partner streaming platform, Peacock. While many clips from his series have been meme'd and circulated on social media platforms, the full coverage that Snoop provides can only be found on NBC and Peacock.\n\nSnoop has provided many great laughs at the games and is even being praised by one user who wrote to X, “Snoop Dogg at the Olympics is one of the best things that has ever happened in the history of the Olympics.”\n\nHere our some of our favorite moments of Snoop at the Games:\n\nOlympic Torch Bearer Snoop Dogg\n\nYes, you read that right. Snoop Dogg did, in fact, help lead Team USA as a torch bearer in the opening ceremony. During the passing of the symbolic object, Snoop did a classic Crip walk, which was fitting for the iconic rapper.\n\nEquestrian Snoop Dogg\n\nOne of the rapper's more viral moments so far at the games came accompanied by his dear friend Martha Stewart as the duo sported matching equestrian attire while attending the equestrian team dressage. While there, the two commented on the performance of the Polish rider Sandra Sysojeva. In the viral clip, Snoop’s classic song “Gin and Juice” is played over the routine. With a prior fear of horses, Snoop really immersed himself in the sport for content. “I'm really scared of horses. So for me to do that, I feel like I'm really going somewhere,” he says in the video. Watch the full clip below:\n\nSwimmer Snoop Dogg\n\nHe’s back and this time joined by Olympic gold meadlist Michael Phelps; in the short clip, Snoop is seen swimming laps with the legendary swimmer. The rapper reveals the two “go back like the backstroke.” When asked if he needed some goggles, the rapper says an adamant “hell nah.”\n\nWatch Video Here\n\nA Trip to the Louvre With Snoop\n\nIn this short one minute clip for NBC, which was also posted to Snoop's personal TikTok, the rapper takes viewers after hours to the historical art museum in Paris. While standing in front of the Mona Lisa, the star says that he is her twin brother, “Tony Lisa.”\n\nFine Dining With Snoop\n\nThe iconic friendship duo is back again, but this time outside of the grounds and rather in a three Michelin star restaurant called Le Cinq.\n\nWhen it comes to food, the two aren't shy; keep in mind that they previously hosted their own cooking show, Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party. While sipping on glasses of champagne and eating authentic Parisian snacks like escargot, Snoop had a lot to say on both what he liked and really did not like (let’s just say he will pass on the snails, but loves the “porky pig” aka a lardon).\n\nWatch Full Clip Here\n\nTo watch all of Snoop Dogg's coverage at the 2024 Paris Games, click the button below to watch on NBC."
