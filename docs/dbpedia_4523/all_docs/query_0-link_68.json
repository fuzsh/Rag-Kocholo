        "text": "Childish Gambino announces new single titled “Lithonia.” As the rapper revealed the release date for his new single, the Grammy winner vents about leakers for allegedly streaming the track ahead of the July 2 release.\n\nGambino Announces New Single “Lithonia”\n\nGambino, whose real name is Donald Glover, vented his frustration on TikTok Live this week. While announcing the single set to drop on Tuesday (July 2), he said, “That got leaked. It kinda pissed me off, to be honest. That’s another reason why y’all don’t get good s—. For what? It’s not valuable enough. It’s just a single.”\n\nNo Soup For Leakers\n\nThe “Me and Your Mama” artist, 40, specifically called out “youth-driven” streaming service Audiomack for leaking the track. He added, “No soup for you. You’re not getting the album now. That’s what time I’m on.”\n\nAlso in his Live, Gambino said that the rollout for the project is mostly about “fun,” because he feels like “people just not having enough fun.” Stressing about the theme of “fun,” Gambino said fans can see all of what he’s planning in the trailer for Bando Stone when they watch A Quiet Place: Day One in IMAX Theaters.\n\nGambino has been teasing “Lithonia” on TikTok in recent weeks and used a brief snippet of the track to fire back at his critics. Earlier this month, he posted a short clip of somebody about to list off “the reasons I don’t f— with Donald Glover.”\n\nThe video then switched to the camera facing the artist looking bored while the new song played the lyrics: “He’s finding out that nobody gives a f—,” played in the background. The snippet has been featured on more of his TikToks since, with him singing the lines.\n\n“Lithonia” appears to be the first single from Gambino’s upcoming album, Bando Stone in the New World, which is due out this summer.\n\nPer HipHopDX, the rapper and actor announced the record earlier this year. The project is set to serve as the soundtrack to a film of the same name Glover is working on and be his final release under his rap moniker.\n\nIt will also mark his second full-length release of this year following his fifth studio album Atavista, an updated version of his 2020 album 3.15.20, which dropped in May.\n\nThe artist is also gearing up to embark on his massive The New World Tour that will take him across North America, Europe, and Oceania between August 2024 and February 2025. He’ll be joined on the road by fellow genre-bending stars Willow Smith and Amaarae.\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
