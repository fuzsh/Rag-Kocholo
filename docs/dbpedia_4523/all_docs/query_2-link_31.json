        "text": "Snoop Dogg is taking his marijuana legacy to the next level, opening his first licensed dispensary and launching a line of cannabis products that pay tribute to rapper 2Pac.\n\nSnoop’s name is effectively synonymous with marijuana, as the artist has made cannabis culture a hallmark of his personal and professional brand for decades. Now he’s making his debut in California’s legal industry with the launch of the Los Angeles-based retailer S.W.E.D., which stands for “Smoke Weed Every Day.”\n\nThe dispensary features various nods to Snoop’s career under the record label Death Row Records, which he took over in 2022. For example, there’s a smoke-proof DJ booth where Snoop can smoke and spin music, memorabilia associated with the label and graffitied quotes from the artist.\n\nOne of the other unique features of the Los Angeles dispensary is its catered selections of marijuana offerings, which will include a new line of limited-edition products from Snoop’s Death Row Records Cannabis brand.\n\nThat product line honors rapper Tupac Shakur, or 2Pac, an iconic artist who Snoop befriended before he was killed in a shooting in 1997. It was 2Pac who gifted Snoop his first blunt.\n\n“That first blunt sparked a friendship that ran deep,” Snoop said in a press release. “We’ll always have his music, but this is another way I can bring what was meaningful to 2Pac to his fans.”\n\nThis isn’t the artist’s first foray into the cannabis industry, as he also launched a different marijuana brand called Leafs By Snoop in Colorado in 2015.\n\nSnoop’s marijuana legacy runs deep, as late night TV host Jimmy Kimmel recognized last year when he declared the artist’s birthday, October 20, the “new high holiday” of DoggFather’s Day.\n\nWhile he might be best known as a prolific consumer, Snoop has also advocated for reform, which includes calling for a policy change at the NBA so that players could freely use cannabis off the court.\n\nHe said last year that he supported the reform based on the “medical side of it, the health benefits and how it could actually help ease the opioids and all the pills that they’ve been given and the injections.”\n\nSnoop has long been pushing athletics organizations to adopt lenient marijuana policies, often emphasizing that point that cannabis could serve as a less addictive and dangerous alternative to prescription opioids.\n\nThe artist, who once estimated that he smokes 81 blunts per day, also made headlines in 2019 after he disclosed that he paid a person upwards of $50,000 a year to roll his blunts for him.\n\nNCAA Votes To Remove Marijuana From Banned Substances List For College Athletes"
