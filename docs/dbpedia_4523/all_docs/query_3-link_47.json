        "text": "Arizona State University, Phoenix, AZ\n\nMarch 15-16, 2023\n\nThe Drug Enforcement and Policy Center at the Moritz College of Law at The Ohio State University and the Academy for Justice at the Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law at Arizona State University organized a symposium titled “Drugs and Public Safety: Exploring the Impact of Policy, Policing, and Prosecutorial Reforms” to examine the public safety impact of marijuana and other modern drug policy reforms. The conference was committed to exploring, from a variety of perspectives and with the help of a variety of voices, how to better understand and assess the relationship between drug reforms (broadly defined, including clemency policy and criminal justice reform) and public safety (broadly defined, with an emphasis on violent and serious crime).\n\nBackground\n\nIn 1996, California kicked off a new state-driven law reform era through a ballot initiative legalizing medical marijuana. In subsequent decades, as dozens of states legalized marijuana use, various advocates, public officials, and researchers warned about the possibility of dire public safety consequences. More drug crimes, more general criminality, more drugged driving, and all sorts of other public safety harms were often mentioned as the possible short- or long-term consequence of significant state-level marijuana reforms.\n\nAs of summer 2022, there are 37 states with robust medical marijuana regimes and 19 with full adult-use marijuana programs. The continued support for state-level marijuana reforms seems to reflect, at least in part, the fact that so far, researchers have not documented direct connections between marijuana reforms and adverse public safety outcomes. Though crime is a growing public concern given the rise in violent crimes in recent years, few advocates or researchers have documented clear connections or correlations between jurisdictions that have reformed their marijuana laws and increases in crimes.\n\nAs marijuana reforms have spread, so too has discussion of broader drug reforms such as decriminalization or legalization at both state and local level, as well as relief from drug-war excesses through clemency and expungement. But given the increasing concern about violent crime, many advocates and lawmakers are wondering whether past and possible future drug policy reforms may be advancing or undermining the broad interest in creating safe and stable communities. As the country moves away from marijuana prohibition, a fully informed discussion of drugs, violence, and public safety is needed now more than ever.\n\nWeldon Angelos\n\nWeldon Angelos is a music producer who has worked with legends like Snoop Dogg, Tupac Shakur’s recording group, and Tory Lanez. In 2004, Weldon became the national face of criminal justice reform after he was sentenced to a mandatory 55-year prison term for selling a $900 worth of cannabis as a first-time offender. His cause was championed by Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) & Mike Lee (R-UT), celebrities, leading news organizations like the Washington Post, and even the Koch brothers, which led to an early release in 2016 after serving 13 years of his 55-year sentence.\n\nSince his release, Weldon has become a leading activist working with a bipartisan coalition of celebrities, lawmakers, and business leaders to make our criminal justice system fair for everyone.\n\nWeldon is also a public speaker, author, and is currently co-producing a feature documentary about his story and the criminal justice system.\n\nRaul Ayala\n\nRaul Ayala is the Collaborative Courts Supervising Attorney for the Federal Public Defender’s Office in the Central District of California. As such, he has been assigned as the lead Deputy Federal Public Defender for each of the Conviction and Sentence Alternatives (CASA) Program courts — two in Los Angeles and one each in Santa Ana and Riverside. In addition, he is a team member of the Substance Abuse Treatment and Reentry (STAR) Program, the district’s post-conviction reentry drug court. Raul has been part of the CASA and STAR programs since 2011, and also serves as the office supervisor for its developing Social Support Unit.\n\nAfter working several years at a private non-profit community law firm that he and several other law school classmates established in the San Joaquin Valley upon graduating from UC Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco, he became a trial deputy for the Federal Public Defenders Office from 1984 through 1988. During that time, he tried dozens of cases in district court and argued several matters before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In the following twenty years of private practice as a criminal defense lawyer, he tried many more cases in both federal and state courts, and remained active in various bar associations and public interest scholarship foundations. He returned as a federal defender for a second “tour of duty” in 2008, is a regular trainer for the national Defender Services Office of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts in Washington, D.C., and is currently working on public comments addressing the United States Sentencing Commission’s interest in federal alternatives to incarceration programs.\n\nRaul recently served as Chair of the ABA Criminal Justice Section’s Standards on Diversion Task Force, which were adopted by the ABA House of Delegates at the 2022 Annual Meeting. He serves as Chair of the section’s Alternatives to Incarceration and Diversion Committee, as Co-Executive Director of the Corrections and Sentencing Division, and has recently joined the Section’s Council.\n\nValena Beety\n\nProfessor of Law, Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law at Arizona State University, Deputy Director of the Academy for Justice\n\nProfessor Valena Elizabeth Beety is professor of law at Arizona State University Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law and the deputy director of the Academy for Justice, a criminal justice center connecting research with policy reform.

LPP is a national nonprofit working at the intersection of cannabis and criminal justice reform. Gracie created and leads the LPP policy team, which provides nonpartisan, evidence-based technical assistance to jurisdictions working to roll back cannabis prohibition. She operates her team within the framework that implementing a commercial market for cannabis is only part of legalization: true legalization must undo the harms of prohibition–through state-initiated resentencing and record clearance initiatives. Their operational approach is that smart cannabis policy reforms build the critical momentum for broader justice reforms, which will ultimately shrink the harmful footprint of the legal system in this country.\n\nGracie is a legislative strategist and policy expert who has spent over a decade dedicated to reducing the criminalization and incarceration of marginalized communities. Her work is centered around driving bipartisan consensus and translating research into smart policy. She has worked in advocacy, research, correctional, and reentry settings in both the adult and youth legal systems. Gracie has served as a consultant helping leaders in dozens of states adopt and implement data-driven system reforms, including the popular Clean Slate laws that create automatic record clearance processes.

He was sworn in at a public ceremony on January 3, 2017. Upon stepping into his role as county attorney, Mr. Volkmer’s goal has been to create a system of individualized justice. Mr. Volkmer wants county prosecutors to look at each case on its individual merits and seek a penalty that fits each individual crime.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, he does not believe every person who commits a crime needs to go to jail. Mr. Volkmer encourages the use of diversion, specialty courts, adult probation, and prison to hold offenders accountable while giving offenders the skills necessary to successfully reintegrate into society.\n\nMr. Volkmer believes in the concept of proportionality in the criminal justice system. What that means is the sentence imposed needs to fit the crime. Mr. Volkmer wants his staff to look at the impact a crime has on the victims and the community, as a whole.\n\nAdditionally, Mr. Volkmer wants the office to focus on fiscal responsibility. One accomplishment Mr. Volkmer is most proud of is working with the county to start a new department to provide medical examinations to victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. Before this program, victims were required to leave the county to receive these vital services. Now PCAO can provide better, more timely treatment to victims locally while saving taxpayer money.\n\nMr. Volkmer attended the University of Akron, obtaining both a law degree, with a certificate in Litigation, and his M.B.A. During his years in the private sector, operating his own law firm, Mr. Volkmer served local community members in a variety of matters including Juvenile Law, both Delinquency and Dependency, Family Law, Guardianships and Conservatorships, Probate, Wills, Estate Planning and Criminal Law.\n\nJonathan Wroblewski\n\nDirector of the Harvard Law School Semester in Washington Program and the Director of the Office of Policy and Legislation in the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice\n\nJonathan Wroblewski has been the Director of the Harvard Law School Semester in Washington Program since 2010. He is also the Director of the Office of Policy and Legislation in the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.

Jonathan represents the Department of Justice on the United States Sentencing Commission, the Federal Judicial Conference’s Advisory Committee on the Criminal Rules, and the American Bar Association’s Criminal Justice Council.\n\nJonathan began his federal career in 1988 as a prosecutor with the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he prosecuted criminal civil rights cases, including law enforcement misconduct, involuntary servitude and hate crimes. In 1994, Jonathan joined the United States Sentencing Commission, serving as Deputy General Counsel and then Director of Legislative Affairs. In 1998, he rejoined the Department of Justice in the Criminal Division’s Office of Policy and Legislation. Prior to his federal service, Jonathan served as an assistant public defender in the Alameda County Public Defender’s office, where he represented indigent criminal defendants at all stages of litigation. Jonathan’s prior academic work includes being a Visiting Scholar at the Institute of Criminology at the University of Cambridge in 2005 as part of the Atlantic Fellowship in Public Policy program and serving as an adjunct professor at the George Washington University’s National Law Center and George Mason University School of Law. Jonathan graduated from Duke University in 1983 and from Stanford Law School in 1986."
