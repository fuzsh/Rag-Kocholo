Born on October 20th, 1971, Snoop Dogg grew up in the streets of Compton, California where gang violence was rampant. He developed ties to the notorious Crips gang at an early age, and by the time he was 12 years old, he had already become a rapper.\n\nDuring his teenage years, Snoop Dogg participated in rap battles and built an underground following with his mixtapes. His proficiency as a rapper quickly attracted attention from record labels including Death Row Records which signed him in 1992.
