        "text": "Snoop Dogg has been expanding his brand over the last several years by using his celebrity to sell food products like ice cream and cereal, but the transition from music into the food business has been met with some obstacles, that he says are on purpose.\n\nIn February, Snoop Dogg and Master P launched a lawsuit against Walmart and Minnesota-based cereal maker Post, claiming that the two companies colluded to keep the new cereal line created by Snoop's \"Broadus Foods\" out of the hands of consumers.\n\nIn the lawsuit filed in Dakota County District Court, Snoop and Master P says that \"Post essentially worked with Walmart to ensure that none of the boxes of Snoop cereal would ever appear on store shelves.\"\n\nPost and Walmart have responded to the lawsuit in recent court filings, according to the Star Tribune, they call the allegations from Snoop Dogg and Master P \"completely false\" and say that the lawsuit is \"utterly without merit.\" They've asked to have the case moved from the courts into arbitration.\n\nPost and Walmart claim that Snoop violated the agreement by taking the case directly to court, saying, \"Broadus Foods violated the agreement by filing this suit rather than proceeding in arbitration.\"\n\nPost manufactured and distributed the 4 flavors of cereal for Broadus Foods, and even offered to buy the cereal brand at one point, but were declined. In the end, the companies were to split the profits from the cereal.\n\nPersonally, I remember looking at Walmart for the cereal, but could never find it, I never had a problem finding and buying Snoop's ice cream though. Boxes of the cereal were available from Amazon, but I'm not having cereal shipped to me, I'd rather just buy that at the store directly. I'm assuming this will eventually just get settled out of court and both parties with move on."
