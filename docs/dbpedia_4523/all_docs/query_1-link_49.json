        "text": "Sure, the athletic talent on display at the 2024 Summer Olympics is extraordinary, but it's no Snoop!\n\nSimone Biles and fellow Team USA women's gymnast Jordan Chiles spotted Snoop Dogg in the crowd during competition and started dancing. Cameras caught the pair noticing the rapper and busting out some moves. Snoop, decked out in Team USA apparel, got out of his seat and also danced.\n\n\"Anybody have any more fun than Snoop? I don't think so,\" announcer Terry Gannon said.\n\nThe NBC Olympics social media accounts posted the clip on July 29.\n\n\"Drop it like it‚Äôs hot! üî• Jordan Chiles, Simone Biles, and Snoop Dogg were,\" it captioned the moment.\n\n\"snoop is definitely having the best summer,\" NBC wrote in the comments on the TikTok video.\n\nIndeed, Snoop has made the most of his time in Paris. The rapper, who is providing his unique brand of commentary for NBC during the Games, was seen in an NBC video shared late July 29 learning some swim tips and tricks from the GOAT, Michael Phelps.\n\n\"You see me and MP, we go back like the backstroke,\" Snoop says of the 23-time gold medalist before asking how someone could learn to swim faster.\n\n\"Wingspan, lung power,\" Phelps replies.\n\n\"You just described me!\" Snoop quips, laughing. \"I definitely have great lung power.\"\n\nLater, after getting clearly exhausted from his hotel pool swim, Snoop jokes he's in \"gold medal condition,\" as he wheezes.\n\nThe video was just the latest highlight in a slew of Snoop moments that have captured Olympics audiences.\n\nEarlier on July 29, Snoop was at his best while providing analysis of a men‚Äôs doubles badminton match between the United States and China on July 28.\n\n‚ÄúThis is a great rally here between China and the U.S. right here,‚Äù he began his rapid-fire commentary during the long volley shared on X by NBC Sports, with his words flying faster than the shuttlecock itself.\n\n‚ÄúAs you see, it don‚Äôt stop 'til the casket drop. They rocking and rolling, back and forth,‚Äù he continued.\n\n‚ÄúGive me that, no I need that. Nope, over here, nope, over there, what about over there? Nope. What about there? Nope. Give me that. I need that. That, too. Sit down. Get down. Wait a minute. Hold it, way up in the sky. Now down. Back up. Over there. Now over here. Get out the way. Move. I told you, we need that.‚Äù\n\nFans loved the joy the rapper brought.\n\n\"Snoop has literally become an American treasure!\" someone commented.\n\nHe's also been spotted cheering on Team USA from the stands throughout the events, always dressed to the nines in American flag apparel or the faces of competing Olympians.\n\nAt one point, he watched tennis rivals Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal play with fellow Long Beach, California, native, tennis icon Billie Jean King.\n\nSnoop also helped host the Paris opening ceremony alongside TODAY's Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie, NBC's Mike Tirico, singer Kelly Clarkson and former NFL player Peyton Manning.\n\nSnoop freestyled occasionally during the ceremony, chatted with Biles' family, and was caught on camera ahead of the ceremony absolutely getting down.\n\nHe also had the honor of carrying the Olympic torch ahead of the ceremony.\n\nAt one point, following an interview with Olympian Noah Lyles on the Team USA boat, Tirico tossed to Snoop.\n\n‚ÄúYou know Noah (Lyles) stays smooth as a broom, dipped and whipped, smooth as a booty, so you know he‚Äôs gonna be fresh to death, ya dig?‚Äù Snoop said, seemingly off-the-cuff.\n\nWhen asked how he was holding up in the rain, the Long Beach, California, native had this to say:\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm chillin like a villain, raindrops falling on my head ‚Äî but we still playin' to win, baby.‚Äù\n\nViewers can expect to see a lot of the rapper during the Olympics, as he will take a deep dive into the city and the athletes hoping to make their mark.\n\nSnoop Dogg and the Olympics may not jump out as a natural combination, but he says it‚Äôs an ideal fit.\n\n‚ÄúI grew up watching the Olympics and am thrilled to see the incredible athletes bring their A-game to Paris. It‚Äôs a celebration of skill, dedication, and the pursuit of greatness,‚Äù he said in a press release earlier this year.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have some amazing competitions and, of course, I will be bringing that Snoop style to the mix. It‚Äôs going to be the most epic Olympics ever, so stay tuned, and keep it locked. Let‚Äôs elevate, celebrate, and make these games unforgettable, smoke the competition, and may the best shine like gold. Peace and Olympic LOVE, ya dig?‚Äù\n\nThis is not Snoop‚Äôs first go-round at the Olympics, either. He previously reported during the 2021 Summer Games in Tokyo, appearing on the Peacock show ‚ÄúOlympic Highlights with Kevin Hart and Snoop Dogg.‚Äù\n\nThat endeavor helped pave the way for this new gig.\n\n‚ÄúSnoop is already an Olympic gold medal commentator, generating tens of millions of views for his highlights commentary on Peacock of the dressage competition during the Tokyo Olympics,‚Äù said Molly Solomon, executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production.\n\n‚ÄúThat performance alone has earned Snoop a job as our Special Correspondent in Paris. We don‚Äôt know what the heck is going to happen every day, but we know he will add his unique perspective to our re-imagined Olympic primetime show.‚Äù\n\nCoverage of the Summer Olympics will run from July 26 until Aug. 11 on NBC and Peacock, as well as USA Network, GOLF Channel, CNBC, E! and Universo.\n\nPeacock is streaming the Paris Olympics around the clock.
