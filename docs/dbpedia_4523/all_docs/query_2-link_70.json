        "text": "Welcome to FTW Explains, a guide to catching up on and better understanding stuff going on in the world. This is FTW Explains: The Olympics.\n\nSnoop Dogg is mostly known as a musician but he is also a man who wears many hats, which also includes an involvement with the Olympics.\n\nThe legendary Long Beach rapper, who has been nominated for 17 Grammy Awards and has won a Primetime Emmy Award during his illustrious career, is the ultimate multi-hyphenate.\n\nNow spanning more than three decades in the public eye, he is as popular and recognizable today as ever. After selling more than 35 million albums around the world, fans will get another chance to watch him enjoy continued success as more than just a musician.\n\nSnoop had a show for the Tokyo Olympics\n\nSnoop Dogg is a massive sports fan, showing a particular affinity for teams based in Southern California.\n\nSome of his favorite teams include the Lakers, Dodgers, USC Trojans and Pittsburgh Steelers. He also roots for several hockey teams and he even joined an investment group to buy the Ottawa Senators, although it was not successful.\n\nHe is a football coach, as featured in the Netflix documentary Coach Snoop, and operates the Snoop Youth Football League in Los Angeles.\n\nConsidering his love for sports, it wasn’t surprising when Peacock tapped him to host “Olympic Highlights with Kevin Hart and Snoop Dogg” for the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nHe is doing even more for the Paris Olympics\n\nFollowing the success of his previous show on Peacock three years ago, Snoop Dogg was tapped for an elevated role this year and is on-site in Paris.\n\nHe has said that he would desperately like to meet a dancing horse and get in the pool with swimmer Michael Phelps.\n\nNBCUniversal announced that he will provide regular updates for the network during the 2024 Paris Olympics. That includes on-air time with NBC’s Mike Tirico during prime time coverage.\n\nHere is more directly from Snoop (via NBC.com):\n\n“I grew up watching the Olympics and am thrilled to see the incredible athletes bring their A-game to Paris. It’s a celebration of skill, dedication, and the pursuit of greatness,” said Snoop Dogg. “We’re going to have some amazing competitions and, of course, I will be bringing that Snoop style to the mix. It’s going to be the most epic Olympics ever, so stay tuned, and keep it locked. Let’s elevate, celebrate, and make these games unforgettable, smoke the competition, and may the best shine like gold. Peace and Olympic LOVE, ya dig?”\n\nSnoop recently ran the 200-meter sprint at 2024 US Olympic Track & Field Trials in Eugene, Oregon."
