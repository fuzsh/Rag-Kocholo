        "text": "Rapper Snoop Dogg did a U-turn on his opinion about Donald Trump, saying he has “nothing but love and respect” for the former president following years of staunch criticism.\n\nIn an interview with London’s The Sunday Times over the weekend, the “Gin and Juice“ rapper was asked about his thoughts on the GOP front-runner in the upcoming presidential election. He replied by praising Trump, mentioning the former president pardoned Michael “Harry-O” Harris, a former associate of Suge Knight.\n\n“Donald Trump?” Snoop Dogg said. “He ain’t done nothing wrong to me. He has done only great things for me. He pardoned Michael Harris.”\n\nKnight, alongside Harris and Dr. Dre, co-founded the Death Row Records record label in the 1990s, which signed Snoop Dogg early in his career. Harris was convicted of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder but was pardoned by Trump in 2021 after serving 30 years of a 25-year-to-life sentence, according to USA Today. Before leaving office, Trump pardoned Harris, along with 69 others.\n\n“I have nothing but love and respect for Donald Trump,” Snoop added.\n\nThe rapper’s latest sentiments are in stark contrast to what he has expressed in the past.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with Rolling Stone, Snoop Dogg said he had “never seen a motherf‑‑‑er” like Trump, asking, “How could we have someone as reckless as him running our country?”\n\nIn 2018, Snoop Dogg also heavily criticized Trump and fellow rapper Kanye West, who is an open Trump supporter.\n\nThe rapper is also known for his previous controversial stunts to condemn the former president, such as shared an EP cover on social media in 2017 that shows him standing over Trump’s dead body. In a 2018 visit to the White House, he smoked a blunt outside of the building."
