        "text": "SAN QUENTIN – Rapper Snoop Dogg urged Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Saturday to grant clemency to Stanley “Tookie” Williams, so he can continue his work with young people.\n\n“Stanley `Tookie’ Williams is not just a regular old guy, he’s an inspirator,” the rapper and former Crips member told a crowd of about 1,000 outside the main gate of San Quentin State Prison. “His voice needs to be heard.”\n\nWilliams, 51, is set to be executed Dec. 13. He was convicted in 1979 of murdering four people during two robberies in Los Angeles and Whittier. He has exhausted his appeals and he has asked Schwarzenegger for clemency.\n\nSnoop Dogg, 33, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, said after he saw “Redemption,” the award-winning television movie based on Williams’ life and starring Jamie Foxx, he realized he needed to contribute more to his community and to young people, in particular.\n\n“I come from the east side of Long Beach, home of where gang-banging is an all-time must and Crippin’ is at an all-time high. I was once a Crip gang member,” he said, adding that the music business helped him leave that life behind.\n\nHe now does youth outreach activities, including running a football league for youngsters.\n\n“I didn’t get this from somebody that was on the streets. I got this from Stanley `Tookie’ Williams, a brother that was locked up on Death Row,” he said, wearing a white T-shirt with huge black letters that said savetookie.org. “He inspired me to want to do something positive with my life and to go touch the kids.”\n\nThe rapper had wanted to visit Williams on Death Row, but his application was denied by prison officials because of his criminal record. Snoop Dogg has been arrested several times for weapons and drug-related offenses, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.\n\nOrganizers played a new Snoop Dogg song called “Real Soon,” which promotes Williams’ advocacy work. It was expected to be available Monday as a download from the rapper’s Web site.\n\nMembers of the Nation of Islam along with California Highway Patrol and Marin County sheriff’s deputies provided security for Saturday’s event. No incidents were reported.\n\nVolunteers sold T-shirts, doughnuts and coffee. Paperback copies of Williams’ memoir, “Blue Rage, Black Redemption” also were available. All proceeds were to benefit the Save Tookie Foundation, organizers said.\n\nTodd Chretien, who works with the Campaign to End the Death Penalty, an advocacy group that helped organize the rally, implored the governor to grant clemency.\n\n“There is no reason on earth to kill him, and there is every reason to keep him alive,” he said."
