        "text": "A woman who accused Snoop Dogg of sexual assault and battery in a lawsuit in February, only to drop the suit months later, has refiled her claim against the rapper and one of his associates.\n\nThe woman, who is identified only as Jane Doe, resubmitted the lawsuit earlier this week in a California federal district court, according to documents obtained by PEOPLE. The filing again contains sexual assault and sexual battery allegations against the \"Gin and Juice\" rapper and his associate Bishop Don Magic Juan, which he has denied, and also includes defamation claims.\n\nThe initial suit was reportedly pulled \"without prejudice\" in April, months after Snoop Dogg asked a federal judge to dismiss the suit based on the fact that the allegations it contained were \"implausible and false.\"\n\nIn this week's filing, Doe, allegedly a former employee of the star, claims that Snoop Dogg, 50, used social media to make threats against her. She also alleges that after a private mediation between her and the artist's legal team, he used social media to \"threaten, intimidate, and coerce Plaintiff into not exercising her constitutional rights to engage in a mediation.\"\n\nThe lawsuit states: \"Defendant Snoop Dogg's pattern and practice of threats, retaliation, harassment, and intimidation unsurprisingly did not stop there.\"\n\nThe lawsuit also claims that despite the accuser wanting anonymity, her identity was revealed by a spokesperson for the rapper — whose real name is Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. — in an attempt to \"intimidate\" and \"harass\" her.\n\nIn response, a spokesperson for the rapper tells PEOPLE: \"The complaint refiled against Snoop Dogg by 'Jane Doe' and her attorney is meritless. It follows Jane Doe's attorney's voluntarily dismissing just a few months ago her previous complaint on the alleged matter. He also dismissed an earlier complaint — this is the third try. As before, this refiled complaint is riddled with and predicated upon falsehoods and inaccuracies. Moreover, as Jane Doe and her attorney know or should know, Jane Doe has never been Snoop Dogg's employee.\"\n\n\"In March 2022, the plaintiff and her attorney were served with a motion to dismiss by legal counsel for Snoop Dogg. That motion made clear to Jane Doe and her attorney the false nature of Jane Doe's allegations against Snoop Dogg. Jane Doe's attorney then in April 2022 asked the court to dismiss his client's complaint.\"\n\nThe spokesperson concluded, \"Snoop Dogg looks forward to proving the falsity of these allegations.\"\n\nThe \"Young, Wild & Free\" rapper was originally sued in February. At the time, Doe claimed that he assaulted her after she attended his concert at Club Heat Ultra Lounge in Anaheim, California in May 2013. She also alleged she worked for Snoop Dogg and Don Juan as a stage dancer for their concerts in exchange for gifts.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges Snoop Dogg's \"actions were sexually predatorial,\" stating that Doe \"found herself thinking about her job security if she displeased [Snoop]. [She] felt pressured ... due to his dominance, and his position of power over her, including his ability to hire and fire her and ensure that she would never be hired in his industry again.\"\n\nDoe has \"suffered anxiety, stress, depression, nightmares, sleep disturbances, post-traumatic stress, headaches, severe emotional distress and physical ailments,\" as a result of Dogg and Don Juan's alleged actions, according to the previous complaint, which alleged that Doe had lost income, bonuses, compensation and other employment benefits.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Snoop Dogg Says That the NFL and Hip Hop Are About, 'Representing, Movin' Forward and Change'\n\nDays after the suit was first filed in February, a spokesperson for Snoop Dogg denied the claims against him, calling them \"simply meritless.\"\n\n\"They appear to be part of a self-enrichment shakedown scheme to extort Snoop Dogg right before he performs during this Sunday's Super Bowl halftime show,\" they added, according to Reuters.\n\nThe spokesperson also denied the accuser's claims that she worked as a stage performer during his concerts.\n\n\"What is clear is that this shakedown scheme is disgraceful,\" they said. \"This attempt to use the courts to advance this scheme is shameful too, and does a disservice to real victims who deserve to be believed.\""
