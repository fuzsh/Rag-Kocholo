        "text": "Snoop Dogg’s performance at the 2024 Paris Olympics continues to be a slam dunk.\n\nThe rapper, who has worn many different hats (and helmets) while covering the Games, gave a golden performance Monday night during the 50th anniversary celebration of USA Basketball.\n\nIn videos from the performance, the 52-year-old can be seen sporting a shirt with an image of USA women’s basketball star A’ja Wilson while singing some of his hits, including “Drop It Like It’s Hot.”\n\nWilson was among the Team USA men’s and women’s basketball players in attendance alongside LeBron James, Diana Taurasi and Stephen Curry. At one point, Snoop brought players, including Brittney Griner, onto the stage to hand out gifts.\n\nAnd the Celebration of Olympic Basketball didn’t just have current basketball players making an appearance, as retired athletes across many sports—including Dwyane Wade, Sue Bird and even Tom Brady—joined in.\n\nThe star-studded event took place ahead of both the men’s and women’s team’s quarterfinal games, on Aug. 6 and 7 respectively, where both teams are hoping to defend their gold medal streak—the fifth consecutive for the men and a dominating eighth for the women."
