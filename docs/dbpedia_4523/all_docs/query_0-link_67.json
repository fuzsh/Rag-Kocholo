A spokesman and a spokeswoman at Def Jam would not comment.\n\nAt issue is whether Mr. McGriff gave Mr. Gotti seed money for Murder Inc. from his drug profits, the police have said. Record label executives at Def Jam, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said yesterday that Mr. Gotti did not take drug money for the business.\n\nBefore Def Jam's president, Kevin Liles, told Rolling Stone last summer that \"Gotti's so hot we had to get an extra air-conditioner put in here,\" Mr. Gotti used to sleep on a sofa in the office, because he was essentially homeless, the executives said.\n\nThere was no windfall of drug money or any other kind of money, the executives said.\n\nMr. Gotti was born Irving Lorenzo, but changed his name in homage to John Gotti, the Gambino crime family boss, now dead. One of the favorite stories about Irv Gotti concerns his interview for a job with Def Jam. Asked where he wanted to be in five years, he replied, \"I want to become you, and then destroy you and everyone like you, because you can't know hip-hop better than me.\"\n\nHe got the job, and his proteges resuscitated the label that had launched Public Enemy and LL Cool J. He records at a SoHo studio called the Crack House.\n\nMr. McGriff is well known to the police as the leader of the Supreme Team, a drug gang in Queens. He resumed contact with Mr. Gotti when he was released from prison.\n\n\"A lot of these guys, they're really confused,\" Mr. Clark said. \"They bring in the criminals from their neighborhood around them now. They think they know the guy, and bring the guy into the organization, and they forget what happens in the street, and that there's an effect from all that.\"\n\nMr. Gotti made Mr. McGriff a producer on a forthcoming straight-to-video project titled \"Crime Partners,\" label executives said. The investigation that led to Friday's raid began when the police saw a bootleg copy of the DVD and noticed Mr. McGriff's name in the credits, the Def Jam sources said.\n\nThe police have said Mr. McGriff helped write and produce the film, Murder Inc.'s first, in which Ja Rule, Ice-T and Snoop Dogg appear.\n\nMAP posted-by: Jo-D"
