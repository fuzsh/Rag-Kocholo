        "text": "\"Anything I put my mind to, I accomplish it/ From writing scripts with Tina Fey to laying down the hardest shit\". Childish Gambino, whose latest free EP dropped this month, may be the only rapper to boast about hitting the laptop with Liz Lemon, but then he's also the only rapper to scribble for The Daily Show and hold down a day job with Chevy Chase. That's because Gambino's better known as Donald Glover, the writer, actor and comic who plays cocksure Troy Barnes in US further ed-com Community. Where Troy spits simplistic, Spanish-language gems with his partner in rhyme Abed, however, Glover forgoes all mention of \"bibliothecas\" in favour of smart, profanity-laced rhymes delivered nimbly over polished production.\n\nIf his flow screams Lil Wayne, Glover the MC at least avoids comparison with his colleague Chevy, who pioneered comedy rap with 1980's Sugar Hill Gang parody Rapper's Plight. Despite his comedy career (and Wu-Tang-spoofing rap moniker), Glover maintains that his rapping ain't no joke. \"Damn bloggers argue over whether or not I'm serious\", he griped on his 2010 Culdesac album – see culdesac-album.com – \"It's Nas's Illmatic not Eddie Murphy's Delirious\".\n\nYet Glover's skills as a comic have undoubtedly proven transferable, whether he's dropping a pop-culture punchline (\"Crowd at my shows more mixed than Rashida Jones\") or detonating a bad-taste boast (\"NBC is not the only thing I'm comin' on tonight\"). And through his rap over Jamie xx's remix of Adele's Rolling In The Deep, he shows a sure touch with other people's tunes.\n\nElsewhere, Glover engages in the type of open-wound introspection more commonly associated with joke-tellers than rhyme-spitters. For every three lyrics about his sexual prowess, there's at least one recounting his nerdy past or admitting that he's still viewed as \"gay\" or \"whiter than that Colgate\" by many a black rap fan.\n\nEmerging as the unlikely Dr Dre to Glover's Eminem is Fey, who apparently blessed Donald with more than just a 30 Rock writing gig. \"And this next part sounds like nonsense\", he rhymes on The Last, \"but I swear to God Tina Fey gave me confidence/ Taught me everything that is good comes from honesty/ Everybody's got a voice, you just gotta follow it …\"\n\nOn the same track, though, Glover suggests that the only comedy rappers worth following are The Lonely Island, whose follow-up to 2009's Incredibad is due shortly. In fact, with many of today's rap stars themselves resembling SNL caricatures (Gucci Mane has an ice-cream cone tattooed on his face and Waka Flocka Flame's called Waka Flocka Flame), the time's never been better for hip-hop-savvy funny folk to unleash their inner MCs. Abed as the new Jay-Z anyone?"
