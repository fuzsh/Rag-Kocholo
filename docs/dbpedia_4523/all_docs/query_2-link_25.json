        "text": "Snoop Dogg needs no introduction. An icon of today’s music industry, Snoop skyrocketed to rap stardom in the 90s with his album, Doggystyle. This iconic record was released in 1993 and entered the Billboard 200 chart in poll position (the first time that had happened for a debut record).\n\nSnoop D-O-double-G, as he’s often known, has stayed in the public eye ever since! Want to find out more about him? Keep reading to discover 5 things you probably never knew about the legendary Snoop Dogg.\n\n1. Snoop Dogg Isn’t His Real Name\n\nThis piece of trivia might not come as a huge surprise. After all, most artists perform under a stage name, and “Snoop Dogg” doesn’t sound like something most parents would call a new-born baby! What’s more surprising is the actual name that’s on his birth certificate.\n\nSnoop Dogg’s real name is Calvin Cordozar Broadus Junior. In fact, ‘Snoop’ only came about when his parents started calling him ‘Snoopy’. That childhood nickname stuck and eventually morphed into the stage name we know him by today.\n\n2. Snoop’s No Stranger to Scandal\n\nSnoop Dogg is one of the most well-known and loved celebrities of our time. But he’s had a fair share of scandalous moments throughout his career too!\n\nFor example, did you know that he was arrested in relation to a drive-by shooting in the early days of his career (before being cleared of all charges)? More recently, he’s said to have had an affair with Celina Powell (though you should learn more about the accusations before pointing fingers).\n\n3. Snoop Coaches Football\n\nRap music may have made him famous, but Snoop Dogg’s a man of eclectic interests. Of them all, though, sports is one of particular note. He’s a major basketball and football fan and even spent years coaching a youth team (Snoop’s Steelers)!\n\nDon’t believe us? You can see him in action on a 2018 Netflix documentary called ‘Coach Snoop’.\n\n4. Snoop Had Genuine Gang Affiliations\n\nUnlike many modern-day rappers who just talk the talk, Snoop walked the walk as far as gang affiliations go. He was once a member of the Rollin’ 20 Crips!\n\nRather than glorifying that fact, though, Snoop now uses his experiences to compel young people to take a different path. An outspoken advocate of gun control, he’s more ‘Peace and Love’ than ‘Bloods and Crips’ nowadays.\n\n5. Snoop’s a Genius (Literally)!\n\nA quick one to finish: word on the street is that Snoop D-O-double-G’s a genuine genius. And not just of the musician/rap variety. Rumour has it that he boasts an incredible IQ score of 147, which would qualify him for Mensa.\n\nDon’t Forget These Facts About Snoop Dogg\n\nSnoop Dogg’s world-famous and lauded for both his musical talent and unique personality. However, he’s got so many strings to his bow that even die-hard fans don’t know everything about him."
