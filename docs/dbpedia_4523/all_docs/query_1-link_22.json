        "text": "US rapper and entrepreneur Snoop Dogg has acquired Death Row Records, the label that launched his career.\n\nThe Californian hip-hop star shot to fame following the Death Row-release of his 1993 hit debut album, Doggystyle.\n\nIt featured hits singles such as Gin & Juice, Doggy Dogg World and Murder Was The Case.\n\nSnoop Dogg said the move was an \"extremely meaningful moment for me\" and he was looking forward to \"building the next chapter\" of the record label.\n\n'Future value'\n\n\"I am thrilled and appreciative of the opportunity to acquire the iconic and culturally significant Death Row Records brand, which has immense untapped future value,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"It feels good to have ownership of the label I was part of at the beginning of my career and as one of the founding members.\n\nHe later posted an image on Instagram, alongside the caption \"Bacc on Death Row\".\n\nAllow Instagram content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Instagram .
