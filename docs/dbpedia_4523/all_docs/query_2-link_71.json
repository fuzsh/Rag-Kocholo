        "text": "Snoop Dogg\n\nBible of Love\n\nRCA INSPIRATION\n\n6/10\n\nBy this time and place in recent Dogg Pound memory, we get that Snoop—the one-time Crip and hero to weed aficionados everywhere—can host game shows and hang with home décor maven Martha Stewart. And while he’s a family man who has had a hand in coaching his son’s football team, audiences on the “Gin & Juice” tip never really saw evidence of Snoop’s religious affiliations, other than his making an appearance at the Nation of Islam’s annual Saviours’ Day, where he exalted minister Louis Farrakhan. So a new gospel album—a thirty-two track double LP, in fact—from Tha Doggfather seems odd in terms of his spirituality, but it’s also so very at one with an unpredictable catalog that includes films such as Soul Plane and reggae records under a different name.\n\nIf you love Snoop’s slippery honey-and-rubber flow and sing-song patois, you’re in luck: holy rolling hasn’t slowed him. On “Words Are Few,” the juicy-fluid rapper intones, “I know God is calling me, I’m not where I’m supposed to be” with doleful dedication and righteous indignation. But if you’re hoping that he imbues every track with such fire and brimstone, you’ll be disappointed; in many cases, Snoop’s spiritual involvement is minimal—maybe a metaphorical “Hallelujah” here and there."
