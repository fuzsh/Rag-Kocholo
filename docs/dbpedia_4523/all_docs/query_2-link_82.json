Besides his main residence, the Long Beach mansion he’s owned since 1994, Snoop Dogg has owned several other houses and properties.\n\nClaremont California House\n\nOne of his notable properties is a mansion located in Claremont, California. The property features five bedrooms, five bathrooms, a gym, and a swimming pool. The mansion also has a detached guest house and a tennis court.

The entrance to the mansion is grand, with large double doors that open up to a large foyer.\n\nThe Church – California\n\nSnoop Dogg bought a modest three-bedroom house a few years after buying his dream home in Diamond Bar, located on the same block. Although it might seem strange that the rapper bought a home near his primary residence, many people were shocked when he turned the estate into a working recording studio.\n\nSnoop spends most of his time in the studio, which he calls his “Church,” which is still a special location for him. The mansion also features a recording studio where Snoop Dogg creates and records his music.

When the transaction was made, Snoop Dogg cited his son Cordell Broadus as the primary facilitator and brought him to the FaZe Clan.\n\nHowever, in 2023, a lot transpired. After the company announced cutbacks in early 2022 and initially decided to go public in the summer of 2022, FaZe Clan stock has declined dramatically. However, the esports organisation’s 2022 financial statement showed a substantial loss.\n\nSnoop Dogg told FaZe Holdings Inc. on March 29, 2023, that he is withdrawing immediately from the organisation’s board of directors. Inconsistencies with the firm or its affiliates did not lead to Snoop Dogg’s resignation.\n\nConclusion\n\nSnoop Dogg has used his mansion as a location for several music videos and television shows, including his reality show “Snoop Dogg’s Father Hood,” which aired on E! in 2007. The show gave viewers a glimpse into Snoop Dogg’s personal life and relationships with his wife and children.\n\nSnoop Dogg’s success as a rapper and entrepreneur has declared him a cultural icon and an inspiration to many.
