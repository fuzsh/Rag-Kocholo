        "text": "MUNCIE, Ind. — Sheriff Woody, the pull-string cowboy action figure who starred in four \"Toy Story\" movies, played a role this week in a Muncie man's meth-related arrest.\n\nThe earnest lawman — voiced by actor Tom Hanks in the movie — did not speak as the events unfolded Tuesday that led to the arrest of Timothy Scott Marcum.\n\nBut according to an affidavit, someone had tied a \"Sheriff Woody\" doll to the \"hitch receiver\" of a Dodge Ram 1500 pickup truck driven by the 36-year-old Muncie man.\n\nWoody — or, more specifically, his head — obscured some of the digits on the truck's license plate.\n\nThat prompted a Muncie police officer to pull the vehicle over, near Yale Avenue and Broadway, shortly after 2 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nMore: Muncie woman charged with giving meth to fellow Blackford County Jail inmates\n\nAnother officer who arrived at the scene had a police K-9, who indicated there were controlled substances in the pickup truck. A search of the vehicle prompted discovery of three plastic bags, one containing nearly 3 grams of meth, and the others holding an estimated 24 grams of marijuana.\n\nMarcum was arrested on preliminary counts of possession of meth and possession of marijuana. He was released after posting a $6,000 bond at the Delaware County Jail.\n\nThe Delaware County prosecutor's office will determine whether formal charges will be filed against the Muncie man.\n\nMarcum was charged in May, in Randolph Circuit Court, with burglary, attempted theft and criminal trespass. His trial in that case is set for Sept. 30.\n\nAccording to court records, Marcum has been convicted of crimes including auto theft, false informing, fraud, invasion of privacy, residential entry and theft.\n\nDouglas Walker is a news reporter at The Star Press.
