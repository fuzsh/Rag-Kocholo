        "text": "Snoop Dogg is undeniably one of America’s most successful rappers. He is a 17-time Grammy Award nominee and a Primetime Emmy Award winner among other notable achievements. With a distinct voice and a charismatic persona, Snoop Dogg is definitely one of the game-changers in the rap music industry. It’s safe to say that the Long Beach-born rapper is a hip-hop legend and an established entrepreneur.\n\nIf Katy Perry’s hit single “California Girls” rings in your head, then maybe you should know that he not only featured in it but co-wrote the hit song. Now, let’s look at five things you probably don’t know about Snoop Dogg.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\n1. He has a high IQ\n\nIconic rapper and businessman, Snoop Dogg, has an almost unbelievably high intelligence quotient (IQ). After years of speculation, he finally confirmed that he does indeed have a staggering IQ of 147. With the average IQ ranging between 85 and 113, 147 is regarded as a genius level.\n\nBut this shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, considering the rapper’s business acumen and many different musical skills. Snoop has many awards to his name. Besides his A+ rapping, he is a producer, songwriter, actor, and media personality.\n\nDr. Dre’s 1992 hit, “Nuthin’ But A ‘G’ Thang” features Snoop and peaked at No. 1 on Billboard Hot 100. Snoop also penned Akon’s “I Wanna Love You” and has written several other hits.\n\n[RELATED: 4 Songs You Didn’t Know Snoop Dogg Wrote for Dr. Dre]\n\nSnoop is a creative genius who employs masterful wordplay in his artistry. Over the years, he has released 19 studio albums. His lyrics usually address social issues such as gun violence and stability for the youth.\n\nWith vast business ventures, Snoop is an entrepreneur at heart. Years after his exit from Death Row Records, he acquired the record label. He is also the owner of the wine brand, Cali by Snoop, and a legal cannabis production business in California.\n\nThe rap-genius served as a Mega Mentor for the singing competition, The Voice Season 20. He has shown interest in training up-and-coming talents, encouraging hard work and determination among them. It takes a high level of intelligence to be one of the most influential figures in the rap game for years.\n\n2. He is married to his high-school sweetheart\n\nSnoop Dogg and his girlfriend from high school, Shante Taylor, were wed on June 14, 1997. In 2004, however, he filed for divorce from Shante. Three years later, they reconciled their differences and renewed their vows in 2008.\n\nSnoop and Shante have three children—Cordé, Cordell, and Cori. He also has a son from a relationship with Laurie Holmond. Despite their earlier difficulties, they’ve gone on to live happily together. They have been married for 23 years.\n\nWhen asked in an interview by Today‘s Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush Hager about the secret to the longevity of their marriage, Snoop responded, “I think because we were both young and we were both willing to sacrifice for each other. She knew what my dreams and goals were, and at the same time, I knew what hers were.” (Per BET)\n\n3. He has popular cousins in the entertainment industry\n\nSnoop Dogg appears to have a good number of famous relatives. His first major shot into stardom was with his cousin in a musical group 213. The group consisted of Snoop, his late cousin Nate Dogg, and the stepbrother of Dr. Dre, Warren G.\n\nThe band released an album, The Hard Way, which peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard 200. With the passing of Nate Dogg in 2011, 213 was disbanded. Snoop is also the first cousin of siblings, Brandy, a popular ’90s R&B singer and Grammy Award winner known for her vocal prowess, and Ray J Norwood, a singer, songwriter, and actor. Professional wrestler Sasha Banks is also his first cousin.\n\n4. He participates in philanthropy and charity work\n\nThe rap veteran and clinically acclaimed hip-hop rapper is a huge believer in supporting charitable donations for deserving causes. He has been coaching football since 2005 under the Snoop Dogg Youth Football League, which is geared towards providing inner-city kids with an avenue to express themselves.\n\nA Netflix Special titled, Coach Snoop, details this.\n\nAfter the release of Black Panther in cinemas in 2018, Snoop Dogg joined American author Frederick Joseph in donating tickets for 1,000 young children to see the movie. This act further endeared him to people.\n\nSnoop is also an advocate for animal rights. He serves as a brand ambassador for Beyond Meat, a plant-based food company founded by Ethan Brown. The company develops plant-based meat substitutes and has garnered the support of Kim Kardashian and a host of other celebrities. He has teamed up with other celebrities to hand out hundreds of free Beyond Meat burgers. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, he joined Beyond Meat’s Feed a Million+ campaign to feed front-line workers.\n\n5. He has reinvented himself several times\n\nBorn Calvin Cordoza Broadus Jr. in 1971, Snoop Dogg was named after his stepfather. While still a young child, he developed a liking for the character Snoopy from the Peanuts cartoon. It was this liking that led his mother to nickname him ‘Snoopy.’ The name, however, became regularly used at home, and years later became the inspiration for his stage name, ‘Snoop Dogg.’\n\nOver his 30-plus years career, Snoop Dogg has reinvented himself several times. In the earliest days of his career, he took the name ‘Snoop Doggy Dog.’ But by 1996, when he was leaving Death Row Records, his old record label, he changed his name to Snoop Dogg and joined a new label, No Limit Records.\n\nAfter his return from a trip to Jamaica in 2012, Snoop Dogg announced that he had joined the Rastafari movement and would be going under a new moniker, ‘Snoop Lion.’ Following this announcement he released Reincarnated, both an album and a documentary detailing his conversion. By May 2015, he released Bush, his 13th studio album, and then returned to using his previous name, Snoop Dogg.\n\nPhoto by Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images"
