        "text": "With his performance at the Super Bowl LVI making Snoop Dogg a big name in family homes again, it’s no wonder that new sexual assault allegations against him and his associate have recently come to light. This often happens when a celebrity finds their way into the spotlight because past victims are forcibly reminded of their abusers and attackers when they see them on TV for an interview or performance. The success and momentum of the Me Too movement has continued to this very day, and it continues to give people the strength to come forward with their stories.\n\nWhat’s the story behind the new allegations?\n\nUSA Today reports this is not the first time that Snoop Dogg (Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr.) has faced sexual assault and rape allegations, as in 2005 a make-up artist named Kylie Bell made rape accusations against the rapper. Once again, he is facing accusations of sexual assault and battery, this time from an anonymous woman referred to as Jane Doe who worked and danced for Snoop Dogg’s concerts. This time, Snoop Dogg is facing these accusations along with his associate Bishop Don Magic Juan (Donald Campbell).\n\nIn court documents, Jane Doe detailed how both Snoop Dogg and Mr. Campbell assaulted her. First, Campbell forced her to perform oral sex on him the morning after she had spent the night at his place. The night before, Jane Doe had asked Campbell to return her to her own home after her friend had left her at a club with no ride home. Instead, Campbell had taken her to his place.\n\nAfter that, despite Doe complaining of not feeling well, Campbell took her to see Snoop Dogg at his recording studio. At the studio, Jane Doe excused herself to the bathroom as she still felt unwell. It was while she was still on the toilet that Snoop Dogg allegedly accosted her, and forced her to perform oral sex on him. She was too afraid to refuse, as she had knowledge of his prior rape allegations.\n\nAfter this incident, Jane Doe was not hired as a dancer again by Snoop Dogg or his associate.\n\nJane Doe and the defendants had tried to settle this dispute out of court through mediation a few days before Snoop Dogg’s Super Bowl performance, but it proved to be ultimately unsuccessful. USA Today reports, “Because of the incident, Jane Doe ‘continues to suffer great pain of mind and body, shock, emotional distress, physical manifestations of emotional distress including embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, disgrace, humiliations, and loss of enjoyment of life.’”\n\nDoe’s attorneys expect Snoop Dogg to retaliate, as he retaliated against Kylie Bell (who later dropped her charges) by suing her for extortion “‘in an effort to intimidate her.’”\n\nWhat can you do if you are sexually assaulted?\n\nSexual assault can happen to anyone at any time. Whether you are at a club, a library, or at work, it is still possible to be assaulted. If you have been sexually assaulted, our Los Angeles attorneys recommend keeping five things in mind during this difficult time when everything seems surreal:\n\nThe attacker is to blame. No matter what, the victim is never the perpetrator of the crime. Rape is committed by an attacker, and the victim retains no blame for these criminal actions.\n\nYou are not alone. Sexual assault and rape can make one feel isolated from everyone else. It can be difficult to talk about your experience, and it may feel like you are alone, but the truth is that you are not. There are many resources available to you, including our sexual assault attorneys, therapy, and support groups.\n\nYou have legal rights. You can file a civil lawsuit. You can work with the District Attorney to ensure that he or she presses charges. You can remain anonymous, if you wish. As time is of the essence, it is important that you get in contact with a lawyer as soon as possible. Depending on the circumstances surrounding the assault, other parties may share responsibility for the pain you endured.\n\nYou can start the healing process on your own schedule. Healing is a complex process. Nobody heals in the same way, and there is no rule when you have to start to heal. Sexual assault is an immensely sensitive issue, and it is your right to take as much time as you need to process what was done to you. In time, however, you will begin to heal.\n\nYou have an ally in us. We understand that going to court can be intimidating and frightening. Because of this, we will always be your advocate, fighting for you, your family, and your future.\n\nSexual assault can happen to anyone, anywhere. Whether the attacker is a stranger, a family member, or even a celebrity, it is important to know that no matter what, you are not at fault for the harm that has been done to you. You deserve justice and compensation for the physical and emotional trauma that you endured.\n\nAt Taylor & Ring, our Los Angeles attorneys are here to help you in any way we can. We understand that this crime is reprehensible, and we are here to fight for you. You don’t have to suffer in silence. Contact our offices by calling 310-776-6390 or through this form to arrange a free confidential consultation. We serve clients throughout Southern California.\n\nRelated Sexual Abuse and Assault Content"
