        "text": "In my keynote at California Society of Association Executives (CalSAE) Seasonal Spectacular the other day, I talked about how humans are tribal, like every other kind of social animal (wolves, lions, crows, bees, etc.) When we're in an uncomfortable group situation like networking, we try to find the other humans who seem the most like us. It's a safety and security mechanism that goes back to the very beginnings of human existence. But it also keeps us from meeting and connecting with people who may be completely unlike us (at least on the outside), and from whom we could experience both personal and professional growth and learning. This relationship between Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart is so heartwarming to me, and such a great example of how unexpected friendships can be rewarding and beautiful. Something you might forget that they have in common is that they both have criminal records. In my #keynote, I also talked about how one in four Americans have a #criminal record, but FOUR in four Americans have a criminal history! Those without a criminal record just haven't been caught breaking the law. Which is something we have all done. So, hey, that's something you have in common with everybody you meet! üåü Do you have any unexpected #friendships like this one? #WeAreAllCriminals #Networking #BusinessNetworking üî∏üî∏üî∏ Fun fact: I've been speaking, teaching and #training for over 30 years! Catch my posts about building visibility, credibility and influence through engaging and authentic #presentations by tapping the bell üîî in my profile or by following #SpeakingUpForChange and #ThisIsWhatProfessionalLooksLike. Look for my #LinkedInLearning course, \"Micro-Presentations: Saying More in Less Time!\" ü§èüèº\n\nThis post is everything. I believe \"like\" attracts \"like\" at the right time; and that \"like\" comes in all kinds of packages. It's also a reminder that when your \"PLAN\" seems to now be just \"PL\" (Source for this sentiment: Phoebe Buffay) - just keep going. You never know when the next phone call, introduction or coffee will be THE game changer and open up new ideas and doors you didn't see coming. #keepgoing #newideas #businesspartnership #friends\n\nWhat can creatives take from this post by Snoop Dogg? 1. Embrace Unlikely Collaborations: Creatives can learn to embrace unexpected partnerships, recognising that fruitful collaborations can emerge from diverse and unconventional connections. 2. Value Professional Growth: Snoop's journey with Martha Stewart showcases the importance of seeking opportunities for professional growth and development in the creative industry. 3. Seek Mentorship: Creatives should actively seek mentorship from more experienced individuals in their field, understanding the invaluable insights and guidance that mentors can provide. 4. Build Genuine Connections: Beyond professional collaborations, creatives can aim to build genuine connections with their peers, fostering relationships that go beyond the surface and contribute to personal and artistic growth. 5. Appreciate Creative Partners: Recognise and express gratitude for creative partners who contribute to collaborative projects, acknowledging the unique strengths each person brings to the creative process. 6. Stay Open-Minded: Creativity often flourishes in unexpected places. Maintaining an open mind can lead to innovative ideas, collaborations, and friendships within the creative community. 7. Network Positively: Actively engage in positive networking within the creative industry, understanding that relationships and connections play a crucial role in the professional journey. 8. Express Gratitude: In the creative realm, acknowledging and expressing gratitude for the support and inspiration received from others can create a positive and collaborative atmosphere within the creative community. Hope this helps someone. My two cents üòâ Thomasina ‚úåüèæ . . . #creativecommunity #creative #creativity #collaboration #positivity #gratitude #graduatestudents #grads #network #networking #mentorship #art #fashionindustry #media #mediaindustry #musicindustry #partnerships\n\nNever thought I'd repost Snoop Dogg, yet he's highlighting #cocreation, a collaborative process where different stakeholders work together to produce a mutually valued outcome. While some attributes are commonly discussed, like collaboration and shared goals, there are less common attributes that are equally important: 1. #EmotionalConnection: Co-creation often involves a deep emotional investment from the participants. The emotional connection between Snoop and Martha drives their passion and commitment, leading to more innovative and effective outcomes. 2. #DiverseKnowledgeIntegration: While diversity is obvious, the specific integration of diverse knowledge bases is less discussed. Co-creation between the pair thrives on the unique perspectives and expertise each brings, leading to more comprehensive and highly unique solutions. 3. #IterativeLearning: Co-creation is not a linear process; it often involves iterative learning where mistakes and feedback are integral to refining the end product or solution. 4. #Empathy and #UserCentricity: While user focus is common in design thinking, in co-creation, there's a deeper level of empathy required for understanding all stakeholders involved, not just the end-user. 5. #BoundarySpanning: This involves transcending traditional boundaries, be they organizational, cultural, or disciplinary, to leverage the strengths of diverse groups. 6. #SustainableRelationships: Building and maintaining long-term relationships is a less emphasized but crucial aspect of co-creation. Snoop and Martha are not just focused on the immediate project, but on building a network of ongoing collaboration opportunities. 7. #FluidLeadership: Unlike traditional models with a fixed leader, co-creation often involves fluid leadership where different participants may lead at different stages based on their expertise. 8. #SharedRiskReward: In co-creation, all parties share the risks and rewards. This mutual stake in both the process and the outcome has driven a more committed engagement between them. These attributes highlight the complexity and richness of the co-creation process, going beyond the more commonly discussed aspects of collaboration and innovation. Well done, Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart."
