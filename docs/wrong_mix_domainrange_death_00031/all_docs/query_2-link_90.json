        "text": "Legendary disco singer Donna Summer has died at age 63. She leaves her husband – vocalist Bruce Sudano – three children and four grandchildren, as well as a world of disco lovers.\n\nSummer, who (according to TMZ) has been at work on a new album, has been fighting cancer for several years. She became the Queen of Disco in the 1970’s with hits “Hot Stuff”, “Bad Girls” and “Love to Love You Baby.” She won five GRAMMY awards and an Oscar for “Last Dance,” which was featured on the film “Thank God it’s Friday.”\n\nDonna Summer passed on Thursday in Florida. Her family has stated that they “are at peace celebrating her extraordinary life and her continued legacy.” Summer will be sorely missed, and her contributions to the world of music will live forever."
