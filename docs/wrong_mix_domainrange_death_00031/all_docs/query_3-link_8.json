        "text": "Donna Summer, whose pulsing disco anthems dominated dance floors in the 1970s and went on to have a huge influence on dance and club music for decades to come, has died of cancer at the age of 63.\n\nSummer's I Feel Love and Love to Love You Baby, both produced by Giorgio Moroder, pushed the limits of the time with their provocative lyrics and became huge hits in nightclubs around the world.\n\nHer music helped define the disco genre but also had a huge influence on synth pop, house and dance music, inspiring artists from David Bowie to Madonna to Moby.\n\nSummer, who won five Grammys and sold more than 130 million records worldwide, died surrounded by her family in Naples, Florida, publicist Brian Edwards said.\n\n\"While we grieve her passing, we are at peace celebrating her extraordinary life and her continued legacy.\"\n\n\"Early this morning, surrounded by family, we lost Donna Summer Sudano, a woman of many gifts, the greatest being her faith,\" a statement from her family confirmed.\n\nBorn on New Year's Eve in 1948, Donna Summer first found her voice singing in the choir at her local church.\n\nHer pulsing anthems became the soundtrack for a glittery age of sex, drugs, big hair and flashy clothes.\n\nHer career began in Germany where she performed in productions of the shows Hair and Porgy and Bess and worked as a studio session singer.\n\nBut it was not until 1975 that she found fame with the moaning vocals and grinding beat of Love to Love You Baby which was a huge, but controversial, hit in European nightclubs.\n\nSummer followed up with a string of other disco tunes in the 70s with hits like Hot Stuff, I Feel Love and Bad Girls, and her 1978 cover version of the ballad MacArthur Park, which was her first number one record in the United States.\n\nIn the '80s, she scored a massive hit with She Works Hard For the Money as she sought to branch out of the disco genre.\n\n'The Queen of disco'\n\nTributes started pouring in within hours of her death.\n\n\"She not only made her mark in my heart as well as others, but she forever changed the way ... America danced and enjoyed themselves,\" Gloria Gaynor said in a statement.\n\n\"She may have had her 'Last Dance' here on earth, but 'Heaven Knows' it is dancing with joy for her arrival.\"\n\nHarry Casey, lead singer and \"KC\" of fellow disco greats KC and the Sunshine Band, said he was stunned.\n\n\"We are the freshman class in creating music that continues to this day to make people happy,\" he said.\n\n\"It makes you want to get up and dance and forget your troubles for awhile.\"\n\n\"Rest in Peace dear Donna Summer. Your voice was the heartbeat and soundtrack of a decade,\" music producer Quincy Jones said on Twitter.\n\nIn a statement, Liza Minnelli said Summers would always be remembered.\n\n\"She was a queen, THE Queen of disco, and we will be dancing to her music forever. My thoughts and prayers are with her family always,\" she said.\n\nSinger Mary J Blige tweeted: \"RIP Donna Summers!!!!!!!!!??. You were truly a game changer!!!\"\n\nLa Toya Jackson, sister of the late Michael Jackson, tweeted: \"My condolence to #Donna Summer's family & love ones. She will be terribly missed. She was truly the #Disco Queen!\"\n\nIn Hollywood, flowers were placed on her sidewalk star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\n'The sound of the future'\n\nThe singer won five Grammy awards during her spectacular career, including in 1980 for best rock female vocalist for Hot Stuff, but also as recently as 1997 for best dance recording for Carry On.\n\n\"These songs weren't just hits they were all anthems,\" music commentator AJ Hammer said.\n\n\"She really defined diva well before a lot of people knew what the word diva meant.\"\n\nLove to Love You Baby pioneered the 12\" format which dominated clubs in the late 20th century, being released in a 17-minute version in November 1975.\n\nI Feel Love was released two years later and would also have huge impact on the dance music scene in years to come.\n\n\"One day in Berlin ... [Brian] Eno came running in and said, 'I have heard the sound of the future.' ... he puts on I Feel Love, by Donna Summer ... He said, 'This is it, look no further. This single is going to change the sound of club music for the next 15 years.' Which was more or less right,\" David Bowie later remembered.\n\nSummer holds the record for most consecutive double albums to top the Billboard charts - three - and first female with four number one singles in a 12-month period, three solo and one with Barbra Streisand. This feat was later matched by The Beatles.\n\nHer seventeenth and final studio album, Crayons, was released in 2008.\n\nSummer had three children and was married twice.\n\nHer family has asked that fans make donations in Summer's honour to the Salvation Army."
