        "text": "The Queen of Disco has returned to her throne.\n\nIn case you haven’t heard, Donna Summer is in the midst of one of this year’s most convincing (and unexpected) comebacks. The 59-year-old vocalist, responsible for such ’70s dance anthems as “Hot Stuff,” “Bad Girls” and “I Feel Love,” has risen with her first studio set of all new material since 1991’s “Mistaken Identity.”\n\nThe new offering, “Crayons,” dropped May 20 and immediately became a surprise success story. The album entered the charts at No. 17, marking Summer’s highest debut to date, and has already produced two No. 1 dance hits. The singer has also embarked on a major tour in support of “Crayons,” which hit the newly renovated Mountain Winery in Saratoga on Wednesday and will touch down at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland on Saturday.\n\nIn other words, Summer is having one heck of a season. And she knows it.\n\nShe opened her show at the Mountain Winery with the colorful “Crayons” track “The Queen is Back,” which served as a welcome proclamation, and then proceeded to hit the crowd with a two-hour mix of both disco classics and new tracks. The emphasis on the current release meant that there wasn’t time to play every oldie that fans wanted to hear. Yet, the material from “Crayons” was so strong that it hardly seemed like a bad trade-off.\n\nIndeed, some of the distinct highlights of this two-set show came courtesy of the new album. Besides “Queen,” Summer also delivered inspired versions of the hot club tracks “I’m On Fire” and “Stamp Your Feet” (the two tracks that have topped the Billboard dance chart). The disco diva, whose husky, mature and expressive voice sounded great throughout the night, clearly seemed to enjoy singing the “Crayons” cuts.\n\n“I’m very fortunate,” she explained to the crowd early in the evening. “After a 17-year pause, I’ve actually had the blessing of being able to finally finish a new CD.”\n\nPerhaps the long wait has something to do with why Summer is going to such measures to promote the album. She’s traveling with an arena-sized show, a full-on spectacle that is much bigger than what is normally produced at either the Mountain Winery or the Paramount. There’s a 10-piece band, complete with three backing vocalists, as well as three excellent male dancers. There are also video segments, plenty of other theatrical elements and, befitting a diva of Summer’s stature, numerous costume changes.\n\nShe appeared first in a gorgeous purple evening gown and matching arm-length gloves, cutting the Cabbage Patch in front of huge crown shown on a digital screen, but the other outfits (notably the black leather catsuit that she wore toward the end of the show) were equally stunning.\n\nShe continued to sell the new album during the second set, especially with “Stamp Your Feet” and the funked-up version of “Slide Over Backwards, but, as expected, she also emphasized the classic hits.\n\nShe opened the set with a defiant take on “No More Tears (Enough is Enough)” and then delivered a stunning rendition of “MacArthur Park,” with the crowd joining in on what might be some of the most memorable lyrics in modern pop history: “Someone left the cake out in the rain / I don’t think that I can take it / ‘Cause it took so long to bake it / And I’ll never have that recipe again.”\n\nSummer saved the heavy-hitters for last and brought the show to a close with the mega-hits “She Works Hard for the Money,” “Hot Stuff” and “Last Dance.” In doing so, she gave the crowd members the chance to put to use all the moves they learned back in those disco dance classes in the ’70s.\n\nWatching the fans strut their stuff was enough to convince anyone that the disco era ended a long time ago. Summer’s show, however, served as proof positive that the Queen of Disco is still at the top of her game."
