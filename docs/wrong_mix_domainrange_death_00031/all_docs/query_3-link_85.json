        "text": "In 1975, Summer approached Moroder with an idea for a song she and Bellotte were working on for another singer. She had come up with the lyric “love to love you, baby”. Moroder was interested in developing the new sound that was becoming popular and used Summer’s lyric to develop the song. Moroder persuaded Summer to record what was to be a demo track for another performer.\n\nShe later said that she had thought of how the song might sound if Marilyn Monroe had sung it and began cooing the lyrics. To get into the mood of recording the song, she requested Moroder turn off the lights while they sat on a sofa with him inducing her moans and groans. After hearing playback of the song, Moroder felt Summer’s version should actually be released.\n\nThe song was then sent to Casablanca Records president Neil Bogart in hopes of getting an American release. Bogart informed Summer and Moroder he would release the song (now called “Love to Love You Baby”) but requested that Moroder produce a longer version for discothèques. Moroder, Bellotte, and Summer returned with a 17 minute version and Casablanca signed Summer and released the single in November 1975. The shorter version of the single was promoted to radio stations while clubs regularly played the 17 minute version (the longer version would also appear on the album). Casablanca became one of the first record labels to popularize the 12″ single format.\n\nBy early 1976, “Love to Love You Baby” had reached No. 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100, while the parent album of the same name sold over a million copies. The song generated controversy due to Summer’s moans and groans and some American and European radio stations, including the BBC, refused to play it.\n\n“Love to Love You Baby” found chart success in several European countries, and made the Top 5 in the United Kingdom despite the BBC ban. Other upcoming singles included “Try Me, I Know We Can Make It”, US No. 80; “Could It Be Magic”, US No. 52; “Spring Affair”, US No. 58; and “Winter Melody”, US No. 43. The subsequent albums Love Trilogy and Four Seasons of Love both went gold in the US.\n\nIn 1977, Summer released the concept album I Remember Yesterday. This album included her second top ten single, “I Feel Love”, which reached number six in the US and number one in the UK. According to David Bowie, then in the middle of recording of his Berlin Trilogy with Brian Eno, its impact on the genre’s direction was recognized early on:"
