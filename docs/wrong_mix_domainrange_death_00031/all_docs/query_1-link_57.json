        "text": "Donna Summer is far from dancing her “Last Dance.”\n\nThe 59-year old diva’s hometown show last night at the Bank of America Pavilion proved she’s still got the charisma and the mighty pipes to keep belting it out for years to come.\n\nWith a 10-piece band (including three female backup singers) behind her, Summer launched head first into a two-act gig beginning with “The Queen is Back,” one of nine songs performed from her new CD, “Crayons.” Wrapped tight in a sparkly purple gown with matching evening gloves, she projected an unmistakable sense of self-satisfaction. But it was matched bit for bit with tongue-in-cheek humor: The Queen of Disco takes herself seriously, but not too seriously.\n\nAlternating between hits and new songs, she did her best to keep the crowd engaged with familiar material while dishing out tunes many were likely hearing for the first time.\n\nConsidering recent dance-floor trends, 1977s electro-pulsing “I Feel Love” sounded more relevant now than it did 10 or 15 years ago. Up-tempo disco staples like “Dim All the Lights,” “MacArthur Park” and “On the Radio” took the enthusiastic near-capacity crowd to church by way of Studio 54. When she opened the second act with “No More Tears,” you could hear her singing alone against the piano. It was the show’s sparsest moment, and Summer’s voice was so powerful she has to hold the microphone at a fair distance from her face to avoid distortion. (The Streisand part was sung flawlessly by sister and longtime backup gal Mary Gaines Bernard.)\n\nThe “Crayons” material had a modern urban bent that kept the show moving at a satisfying clip. Her recent pair of #1 club hits, “I’m a Fire” and “Stamp Your Feet,” packed funky punch, but the real surprises were the bluesy grind of “Slide Over Backwards,” the dance-hall-reggae-inflected title track and hip-hop-inspired “Mr. Music.”\n\nA trio of dancers repeatedly appeared to kill time during costume changes (six!). And while the production values definitely felt hokey, we’ll indulge our homegirl’s theatrical flair in trade for that flawless set of pipes. By the time she closed with “Last Dance,” folks were unabashedly boogieing in the aisles."
