        "text": "Synopsis\n\n\"Queen of Disco\" passed away at the of 63, battling with lung cancer. Now, a recent documentary has come out, streaming on HBO, which unfolds several chapters of her life.\n\nA new documentary featuring the legendary Queen of Disco has been released. With a remarkable career filled with numerous chart-topping hits and over 100 million copies of hit singles sold, fans of Donna Summer may be curious about the circumstances surrounding her passing.\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nUnion Budget 2024 Live Updates\n\nNow, more than a decade after her death, her daughter Brooklyn Sudano and Academy Award-winning director Roger Ross Williams present a fresh perspective on the life of the renowned \"Last Dance\" singer through this documentary: “Love to Love You, Donna Summer”.\n\nWhile the documentary surrounds her life and \"great\" music career, we will take a halt at how the \"Queen of Disco\" passed away at the age of 63.\n\nDonna Summer passed away on May 17, 2012, following a battle with lung cancer. In a statement released by her family, they shared the sad news: \"Early this morning, we lost Donna Summer Sudano, a woman of many gifts, the greatest being her faith.\" While grieving her loss, they found solace in celebrating her remarkable life and the enduring legacy she left behind. The family expressed deep gratitude for the prayers and support they received during this sensitive time.\n\nDonna Summer, a non-smoker, was diagnosed with lung cancer and speculated that it may have been caused by the traumatic events of the 9/11 attacks. Living in an apartment in downtown Manhattan when the towers were struck, she experienced immense fear and retreated from the outside world. However, she found solace and healing through her faith and the uplifting power of attending church. This spiritual renewal helped alleviate the heaviness she had been carrying.\n\nFollowing her passing, reports were suggesting that her lung cancer was linked to smoking, but the family firmly denied these claims. Brian Edward, the representative, clarified that the reports were inaccurate and stated that the specifics of Donna Summer's diagnosis and treatment were private matters between her family and the medical team. While various factors could contribute to the development of cancer, the family emphasized the need for respecting their privacy regarding these details.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat was Donna Summer's debut album?\n\n\"Lady of the Night\"\n\nWhere was Donna Summer from?\n\nShe was born in Boston, Massachusetts, USA.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
