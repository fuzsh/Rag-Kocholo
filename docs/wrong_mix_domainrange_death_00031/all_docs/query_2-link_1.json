        "text": "The Hollywood Historic Trust had placed a wreath filled with pink roses, yellow orchids, snapdragons and Queen Anne's lace. Fans had left handwritten messages, candles and a sparkling tiara on the star. (One guy passing by threw his cigarette butt, which landed on the star's name while I was there snapping photos. Oh, Hollywood.)\n\nA couple TV reporters were stationed in front of the star for the early evening broadcasts. News vans were parked close by in a line.\n\nSummer's star is located in front of 7000 Hollywood Boulevard, adjacent to the Roosevelt Hotel.\n\nShe was inducted into the Walk of Fame on March 18, 1992, said Ana Martinez, spokeswoman for the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Summer received star No. 1,952 and sang live without musical accompaniment at her dedication ceremony.\n\nCheck out the photos in the slideshow for a peek at the scene late Thursday afternoon.\n\nRelated: Donna Summer Dead: Queen Of Disco Dies At 63\n\nTell us: Are you a fan of the late disco queen?
