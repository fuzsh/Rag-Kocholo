        "text": "She was called the Queen of Disco, and wore that crown with grace uncommon among pop stars.\n\nBut Donna Summer was more than a genre practitioner. She was more than mere pop royalty, too. She was a pioneer. Long after the first wave of disco passed into history, Donna Summer has remained essential listening.\n\nFew musicians can boast that their recordings had a profound effect on the course of contemporary music. Summer, the singer, songwriter and electropop originator who succumbed to lung and breast cancer this morning, according to her family, was one of those few. She was 63.\n\nHer mid-’70s records used repetition, drone and mechanized beats to prompt an ecstatic experience from dance-floor revelers. Her breathy, ravished lead vocals were at once suggestive and otherworldly, and pushed her music into ethereal and hypnotic territory rarely visited by other more earthbound musicians. These recordings had an immense influence on nearly all dance music that has followed.\n\n\"Together with producer Giorgio Moroder, Donna pioneered the use of electronic sequencers in dance music,\" wrote Duran Duran synthesizer player Nick Rhodes on the band’s website. \"Today that sound that seems so familiar, but in 1977 it was a brave new frontier. It’s extremely rare that you hear one song that completely changes the way you perceive music. (Summer’s) ‘I Feel Love’ achieved that.\"\n\nNot many knew about the severity of her illness. But that kind of reticence was typical of Summer who, despite the explicit nature of many of her hits, was a private person and a devout Christian.\n\nLike many of the greatest pop stars of the 20th Century, Summer, who was born LaDonna Gaines in Boston, began singing in church. Her hits, however, were decidedly secular. \"Love to Love You Baby,\" \"Hot Stuff,\" \"Bad Girls\" — these were songs of overt, smoldering sexuality. They gave a mirror-ball swing and a bell-bottomed flair to 1970s club culture, and remain in heavy circulation to this day.\n\nSummer has often expressed ambivalence about the raciness of her early material.\n\n\"I shouldn't have sung that song,\" she told The Star-Ledger in 2008, referring to \"Love to Love You Baby.\" \"It came out without my knowledge. I was in shock when I heard it because I really did come out of the church and it was not your basic God song. It's history at this point. It is what it is and I am who I am because of it.\"\n\nShe had other influences as well. She left high school to sing for a psychedelic rock band. Later, she auditioned for the musical \"Hair.\" She didn’t get the part in the original New York production, but when \"Hair\" opened in Munich in 1968, she was part of the ensemble. Summer, who learned to speak German, became a session singer and stage actress in Europe, appearing in 1970s productions of \"Godspell,\" \"Showboat\" and \"The Me Nobody Knows.\"\n\nHer death came on the eve of the New Jersey version of the Electric Daisy Carnival, North America’s biggest electronic music festival. (It takes place at the Meadowlands today through Sunday.) Much of the music that will be played there can trace its origins directly to the mid-’70s albums Summer made with Moroder.\n\nBy extending repetitive drum tracks and adding icy synthesizers, Summer and Moroder made some of the earliest electropop ever recorded. The club mix of \"Love to Love You Baby\" was nearly 17 minutes of throbbing bass pulse, skittering high-hat and alluring wisps of melody.\n\nReleased in 1975, \"Love to Love You Baby\" was a controversial record: Summer’s ecstatic delivery prompted squeamish radio stations in the United States and Europe to ban the disc. \"In reality, I’m very shy,\" Summer told Penthouse magazine in a 1979 interview. \"My sexuality exists on sort of a fantasy level.\"\n\n\"I Feel Love,\" Summer’s groundbreaking 1977 hit, is considered by many to be the first trance record ever made. Moroder pulled out everything but the synthesizers and Summer’s arch, slightly dispassionate voice: The sound was robotic and mechanized, yet the extraterrestrial feel of the track made the record sexier. Brian Eno famously called it the sound of the future.\n\nSummer was not always an enthusiastic part of that future. Her 1979 \"Bad Girls\" album incorporated elements of hard rock and new wave. In 1983, she scored another chart-topper — \"She Works Hard For the Money,\" a driving rock track. Her new sound was never less than danceable, but she seemed determined to demonstrate that dance music wasn’t all she could do. In the 1990s and 2000s, she cut Christmas music, standards and romantic ballads alongside cuts that echoed her early hits; her 2008 album \"Crayons\" — her first in more than a decade — was an eclectic affair that found her rejuvenated.\n\nSummer’s music netted her an enormous gay audience. Yet a magazine report in the mid-’80s that claimed that she had called AIDS a divine punishment drew sharp criticism. Thousands of former fans sent copies of her albums back to her record company. Summer always strongly denied making the statement.\n\nSummer is survived by her husband, Bruce Sudano, and their daughters Brooklyn and Amanda. Summer is also survived by Mimi, another daughter from a prior marriage.\n\n• Donna Summer: Stars mourn 'Queen of Disco' on Twitter\n\n• Donna Summer dead at 63, reports say\n\n• Trending: Donna Summer, music festivals and Baba Booey"
