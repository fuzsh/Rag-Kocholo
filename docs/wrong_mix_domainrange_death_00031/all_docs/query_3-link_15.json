        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) â€” Donna Summer's funeral will be a private one for family and close friends.\n\nPublicist Brian Edwards said in a statement Friday that Summer's family is overwhelmed and appreciates the outreach from fans and friends, but that her funeral services will remain private.\n\nHe didn't provide details on when and where services would be held.\n\nSummer died Thursday morning of lung cancer at age 63 in Naples, Fla. Edwards also said that the singer did not smoke.\n\nSummer earned the title of Queen of Disco after releasing a string of dance hits in the 1970s, including \"Hot Stuff,\" \"I Feel Love,\" ''Love to Love You Baby\" and \"Last Dance.\""
