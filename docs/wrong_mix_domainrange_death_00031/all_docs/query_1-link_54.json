        "text": "Some events speak loudly to the soul, giving the heart a bellwether of its makeup. The planning for my mother’s funeral was one such event, tied up in a two-week period of my last few days with her. Though close, she and I hadn’t spoken much immediately prior, our lives being some nine hours parted, and she incapacitated to speak.\n\nShe died from complications with cancer — a really bizarre kind — tongue cancer. Yes, that’s right. It still sounds crazy to me. It started out merely as a bump on her tongue. And my mother was nothing if not someone who would get it checked out right away. She simply didn’t fool around with her health.\n\nBut the bump progressed into malignant cancer. She sought the doctor, eventually having slices taken off. Tongue surgeries. I joked with her about speaking with “forked tongue.” She laughed. But it didn’t go away. It turned into something worse. She got chemo and lost hair, but it kept progressing. Eventually, it wrapped itself around her carotid artery and she had emergency surgery.\n\nThe last several month or so of her life, she really wasn’t able to talk on the phone, so only those up with her in Wichita got much interaction from her. Like I said, we were close. It was emotionally challenging not to be able to support her."
