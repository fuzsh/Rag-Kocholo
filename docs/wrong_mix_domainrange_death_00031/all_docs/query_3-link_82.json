        "text": "Career and Life Highlights\n\n1971\n\n\"Sally Go Round The Roses\" is Donna's debut single. A cover of the Jaynetts 1963 hit is released on MCA Records. She again is credited as Donna Gaines.\n\n​1973\n\nIn 1973 Donna marries Austrian actor Helmuth Sommer and had her daughter, Mimi, the same year.\n\n​\n\n1974\n\nDonna makes her first appearances as Donna Summer (and Americanized version of her husband's last name of Sommer). She makes her chart debut with the single The Hostage which reaches #2 in the Netherlands is produced by Pete Bellotte and written by Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte.\n\n1971\n\n\"Sally Go Round The Roses\" is Donna's debut single. A cover of the Jaynetts 1963 hit is released on MCA Records. She again is credited as Donna Gaines.\n\n​1973\n\nIn 1973 Donna marries Austrian actor Helmuth Sommer and had her daughter, Mimi, the same year.\n\n​\n\n1974\n\n​Donna meets German based producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Belotte while recording backup vocals in Munich for Three Dog Night.\n\n​\n\nDonna makes her first appearances as Donna Summer (and Americanized version of her husband's last name of Sommer). She makes her chart debut with the single The Hostage which reaches #2 in the Netherlands is produced by Pete Bellotte and written by Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte.\n\n​\n\nLady Of The Night, Donna's debut album, is released in February 1974.\n\n​\n\n1975\n\nDonna makes her debut in the U.S. with the worldwide smash hit Love To Love You Baby which was released by Oasis records, which would later join Casablanca Records. Love to Love You Baby makes it to #2 US, #1 Canada, #2 Norway, #4 Australia, #5 Sweden, #4 UK and made the Top 15 in four more countries around the world. Donna Summer was now properly poised to reach superstardom.\n\n1975\n\nThe album \"Love To Love You Baby\" is released in August 1975. Like the title single the album is a hit worldwide reaching the Top 20 in seven countries around the world.\n\n1975\n\nDonna divorces Helmuth Sommer.\n\n1976\n\nDonna receives U.S. Gold certifications for the albums \"Love To Love You Baby\", \"Love Trilogy\" and \"Four Seasons Of Love\".\n\n​\n\n1977\n\n​The electronic odyssey \"I Feel Love\" is released and becomes Donna's second huge worldwide hit. The song reached #1 in Australia, Japan and the UK. It also hit #2 New Zealand, #3 Germany, #4 Canada, #5 Sweden, #6 US, #8 Norway, #9 Ireland. \"I Feel Love\" represented the future on the concept album \"I Remember Yesterday\". Upon hearing the song super producer/musician, Brian Eno, said the song was the sound of the future.\n\n1977\n\n\"I Remember Yesterday\", Donna's fifth studio album and her second concept album. Her first concept album was 1976's \"Four Seasons of Love\", each song represented the seasons. \"I Remember Yesterday\" is a travelogue of musical genres spanning the decades produced with a disco undertone. Side One of the LP saw Summer \"remembering yesterday\" by combining the electronic disco sound with sounds of the 1940s (\"I Remember Yesterday​\"), 1950s (\"Love's Unkind​\") and 1960s (\"Back In Love Again​\"). Side Two consisted of two pop/disco tracks, a ballad and finished with a disco song supposedly representing \"the future\" that would become one of the most famous songs of that genre - \"I Feel Love​\".\n\n1977\n\nDonna releases her third concept album (6th studio album), \"Once Upon A time\", a double album which tells a modern day \"Cinderella\" rags to riches story, through the elements of orchestral disco and ballads.\n\n​\n\n1977\n\nBoth \"I Remember Yesterday\" and \"Once Upon A Time\" are certified Gold in the U.S. by the RIAA.\n\n1978\n\nDonna Summer gets the starring role in the movie \"Thank God It's Friday\". Donna plays a singer determined to perform at the hot disco club. The movie met with moderate success but the song \"Last Dance\" was a huge hit for Donna reaching #3 in the U.S. and the top ten in several countries around the world. Donna won her first Gammy award for \"Best R&B Vocal Performance\" for the song \"Last Dance\". The song also won the Academy Award for \"Best Original Song\".\n\n​\n\n1978\n\nDonna Summer hits the #1 spot on the U.S. album chart with her double live album \"Live and More\". The first three sides are live in concert recorded during Summer's 1978 concert in Lost Angeles, CA at the Universal Amphitheater. The fourth side contained a new studio recording called \"MacArthur Park Suite\". This 17 minute medley includes the songs \"MacArthur Park\" and \"Heaven Knows\". Both songs in the suite were hit singles reaching the Top Ten in several countries around the world as well as both being certified Gold by the RIAA in the U.S.\n\n​\n\n1978\n\nDonna meets Bruce Sudano (her future husband) while recording \"Heaven Knows\". Sudano was a member of the band Brooklyn Dreams who appeared on the song \"Heaven Knows\" with Donna Summer.\n\n1979\n\nThis is Donna's banner year. She started the year out on a winning streak with \"Heaven Knows\" topping the charts in the U.S. She also wins a Grammy Award for \"Last Dance\" and the song goes on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song.\n\n1979\n\nDonna continues her winning streak in March 1979 when she releases \"Hot Stuff\". The song sails right up to #1 in several countries around the world as well as becoming one of her biggest hits in her entire career. The song is released simultaneously with her signature album \"Bad Girls\".\n\n​\n\n1979\n\n\"Hot Stuff\" is certified Platinum (the first of three in the singles category). Meanwhile the album \"Bad Girls\" has gone on to become a worldwide mega-hit. \"Bad Girls\" is Summer's seventh studio album and her third concept album. The album reached #1 in the US and Canada as well as #3 in Norway, New Zealand and Sweden. Several tracks from the album received heavy play in night clubs and discos around the world. The album includes the hit singles \"Hot Stuff\", \"Bad Girls\", \"Walk Away\" and \"Dim All The Lights\". Popular album tracks include \"Sunset People\", \"Our Love\", \"On My Honor\" and \"Journey To The Centre Of Your Heart\".\n\n1979\n\n\"Bad Girls\" is released as a single and like \"Hot Stuff\" quickly made it to #1 in the U.S. and was certified platinum by the RIAA. The song also reached the top 10 in several other countries. Right on the heels of the success of both \"Hot Stuff\" and \"Bad Girls\", \"Dim All The LIghts\" is the third single release from \"Bad Girls\" and jumps all the way to #2 on the U.S. singles chart and also shows extremely well throughout the world. Keeping the winning streak going Donna's duet with Barbra Streisand \"Enough Is Enough (No More Tears)\" soars to U.S. #1 and is a mega-hit around the world reaching the top 3 in many countries.\n\n​\n\n1979\n\nDonna's first internationally released greatest hits compilation is released in October 1979. The double album compilation, \"On The Radio: Greatest Hits Volumes I & II\" reaches #1 in the U.S. and becomes her third consecutive (and last) #1 album in the U.S. The album is a huge worldwide hit charting and selling well in more than a dozen countries around the world.\n\n1980\n\nAfter disagreements in artistic vision Donna parted with Casablanca Records and was quickly signed to Geffen, which at that time was still new in the business.\n\n1980\n\nDonna starts the new decade with a bang! She's hot stuff all over again with a fresh new rockin' new wave influenced sound. \"The Wanderer\" hit dance clubs and radio stations around the world and caught people by surprise. Donna Summer did a complete turnaround in music style. The result was a huge hit. With it's pulsating bass guitar and electronic rhythms the song reached #3 in the U.S. , #4 in Canada, #5 in New Zealand, #6 in Australia and #9 in Sweden.\n\n1980\n\nThis time around Donna was not able to keep up the momentum. The following two singles were only moderate hits with \"Cold Love\" reaching US #33 and \"Who Do You Think You're Fooling\" making it to US #40. After the huge reception for the album \"Bad Girls\", the new album \"The Wanderer\" seemed to be received somewhat tepidly only reaching #13 in the U.S. Nor did the album generate much excitement throughout the world. It reached the Top 15 in only one other country other than the U.S. and that was Sweden where it reached #15. Despite the album's somewhat lackluster sales the music itself was definitely solid. This album was decidedly more rock and new wave influenced with some of the songs showing hints of a Pat Benatar style dance rock song.\n\n1980\n\nJuly 16, 1980 Donna Summer marries Bruce Sudano, they remain together until her passing in 2012. Sudano and Summer were truly one of entertainment's golden couples having been married 31 years and 10 months. They parented two girls Brooklyn Sudano born in 1981 and Amanda Grace Sudano born in 1982.\n\n​\n\n1981\n\nDonna recorded the album \"I'm A Rainbow\" with the Giorgio Moroder / Pete Bellotte production team, her ninth studio album with them and tenth if your include \"Live and More\". But when \"I'm A Rainbow\" was presented to Geffen they were not impressed sensing that the Moroder Bellotte sound was growing stale. Eventually Summer parted ways with Bellotte & Moroder upon mutual agreement. \"I'm A Rainbow\" was shelved and finally released in 1996. Geffen hired Quincy Jones to produce Summer's next album.\n\n1982\n\nDonna comes back in 1982 hotter than ever. She releases \"Love Is In Control (Finger On The Trigger)\". Donna belts this song with every ounce of emotion, soul and conviction as only she can. This is our first hint of what was just around the corner in her work with producer Quincy Jones. One of the songs co-writers, Rod Temperton, had written Michael Jackson's \"Rock With You\" and later went on to write several more hits for Jackson on his \"Thriller\" album. \"Love Is In Control\" brought Donna back into the Top Ten. The song #10 US, #4 Canada, #3 Norway and charted with in the Top Twenty in another half dozen countries.\n\n​\n\n1982\n\nJuly 1982 her second album for Geffen Records is released and her first with a producer other than Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte. Quincy Jones, whom up to that time had produced Michael Jackson's \"Off The Wall\", George Benson's \"Give Me The Night\" and a quadruplet of Brother's Johnson albums. ​​The album sold well and showed a slight uptick in overall worldwide sales from her previous album \"The Wanderer\", but was still not back to her prime as with \"Live and More\" and \"Bad Girls\". ​\n\n​\n\n1982​\n\nThe next single is considered one of her best by die-hard fans. Donna releases the epic \"State of Independence\" in August. Although sales and airplay were only moderate the song is highly respected by fans and music critics. The song is written by Jon Anderson (lead singer of Yes) and Vangelis. Jon and Vangelis first recorded the song for their album \"The Friends Of Mr. Cairo\" in 1981. Again Brian Eno comments on Summer's music having said this was his favorite song and he played it often while working with Coldplay in producing their \"Viva La Vida\" album. The song includes an all-star choir assembled by Quincy Jones and includes Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie, Kenny Loggins, Dionne Warwick and others. Eric Clapton appears on guitar. Quincy Jones claims this song laid the groundwork for \"We Are The World\".\n\n\"State Of Independence\" was only a moderate hit throughout the world. In the US the song reached #41. It made it into the Top Ten in only two countries #10 Ireland and #3 Netherlands. The song did not chart in as many countries as her most recent hit have. Regardless the song was widely recognized for it's originality in both arrangement and emotion factor. Donna Summer's vocal performance is spot on flawless.\n\n​1983\n\n\"The Woman In Me\" is released as a single and was written by Michael Clark and John Bettis (Bettis co-wrote many hits with Richard Carpenter for the group Carpenters). The song is another moderate hit reaching #33 in the US. The Bruce Springsteen penned \"Protection\" is the fourth single release from Donna's \"Donna Summer\" album, but the song fails to chart. Regardless the song receives a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. Springsteen plays the guitar solo on the song and contributes backing vocals which can be heard in the fadeout of the song.\n\n1983\n\nOnce again Donna's relationship with Geffen Records seemed to sour as after they were notified by Polygram Records, Summer's former label Casablanca was by then a wholly owned subsidiary, that she needed to deliver them one more album to fulfill her contract with them.\n\n1983\n\nDonna appears on \"A Special Eddie Rabbitt\", which airs on CBS-TV on Thursday March 24, 1983. Donna sings a medley with Eddie Rabbitt as well as performaning a flawless rendition of Dolly Parton's \"Starting Over Again\".\n\n​\n\n1983 ​\n\nSummer delivered the album, She Works Hard for the Money, and Polygram released it on its Mercury imprint in 1983. The title song became a hit reaching number three on the US Hot 100, and would provide Summer with a Grammy nomination. The album also featured the reggae-flavored UK Top 20 hit \"Unconditional Love\", which featured the British group Musical Youth who were riding high from the success of their single \"Pass the Dutchie\". The third US single, \"Love Has A Mind of Its Own\", reached the top forty of the Billboard R&B chart. The album itself was certified gold.\n\n1984 ​​\n\nDonna is nominated for two Grammy Awards and wins for Best Inspirational Performance for the song \"He's A Rebel\" from her 1983 album\"She Works Hard For The Money\". This is her third out of five Grammy Awards. The awards show is aired on February 28, 1984 and recognizes musical accomplishments from 1983. Her other nomination was for Best Pop Vocal Performance for the song \"She Works Hard For The Money\", Irene Cara won that award for the song \"Flashdance - What A Feeling\".\n\n​\n\n​\n\n1984\n\nIn late 1984, with her obligation to Polygram complete, Summer returned on Geffen Records with her next release. Geffen, wanting to keep the momentum going, enlisted She Works Hard for the Money's producer Michael Omartian to produce Cats Without Claws. The album, however, was not as successful as She Works Hard for the Money and failed to attain gold status in the US, becoming her first album since her 1974 debut not to do so. It did include a moderate hit in The Drifters cover \"There Goes My Baby\", which peaked at No. 21. The album's second single \"Supernatural Love\" only reached #75 on the US singles chart. Jellybean Benitez remixed two of the songs for the album that were released as 12\" singles for club play \"Eyes\" & \"I'm Free\".\n\n​\n\n1985\n\nSummer asks to be released from her contract with Geffen but is turned down. She remains with them until 1988.\n\n1985\n\nDonna Summer wins a Grammy Award for Best Inspirational Performance for the song \"Forgive Me\" from her 1984 album\"Cats Without Claws\". This is her fourth out of five Grammy Awards. The awards show is aired on February 26, 1985 and recognizes musical accomplishments from 1984.\n\n​\n\n1987\n\nAfter several years away from the music scene Donna Summer releases her thirteenth studio album, \"All Systems Go\", which did not sell well, becoming her second consecutive album not to achieve gold status. The album made it to #122 on the US charts and only sold just over 100,000 copies. The album fared well in Sweden where it reached #27, but did not do well anywhere else. It featured the single \"Dinner with Gershwin\" (written by Brenda Russell), which hit #48 in the US, though it peaked at No. 13 in the UK and Ireland. The album's title track, \"All Systems Go\", was released only in the UK where it peaked at No. 54.\n\n1988\n\nSummer teams with the hit British production team of Mike Stock, Matt Aitken and Pete Waterman to record the album \"Another Place and Time\". Geffen Records, however, decided not to release the album. At this point in time Donna finally leaves Geffen Records.\n\n​\n\n1989\n\n\"Another Place and Time\" is released in Europe by Warner Bros. and in the US the album is released by Atlantic Records. The album, again was not a big hit for Summer only reaching #53 in the US. It performed best in Sweden at #16 and the UK #17. The album however did bring another Top Ten hit for Donna with the song \"This Time I Know It's For Real\" which made it to #7 in the US, #6 Canada, #4 Ireland, #6 Netherlands, #3 Norway, #3 UK and made it in the Top 20 in several other countries. This was Donna's biggest hit in 5 years. \"I Don't Wanna Get Hurt\" and \"Love's About To Change My Heart\" were both released as singles worldwide and fared moderately.\n\n1990\n\nIn 1990 the compilation album \"The Best Of Donna Summer\" was released and charted fairly well in several countries throughout Europe and the US. The album went gold in the UK after the New Bass Mix of the song \"State of Independence\" had been released to promote the album.\n\n1991\n\nAdopting a more urban music style and dying her hair blonde Donna Summer releases her 14th studio album. The Atlantic Records release is her least successful studio album of pop music. The album is her first to not chart anywhere in the world, with the exception of reaching #97 on the U.S. R&B chart. ​Two singles were released, \"When Love Cries\" which reaches #77 in the U.S. and \"Work That Magic\" reaching #74 in the UK.\n\n​\n\n1992\n\nFind Donna teamed up with Giorgio Moroder again. This time with the classic tune \"Carry On\", which was produced and co-written by Giorgio Moroder. The song initially is not a success failing to chart anywhere. However, the song does enjoy minor success in subsequent re-releases in upcoming years.\n\n1992\n\nDonna Summer receives her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on March 18, 1992. It's located at 7030 Hollywood Blvd.\n\n1993\n\n​In 1993, Polygram issued the two-disc set, The Donna Summer Anthology, which included 34 tracks of all of Summer's material with Casablanca and Mercury while also including songs from her tenures with Atlantic and Geffen. The Anthology surprisingly sold well in Mexico having reached #25 on the Mexican charts.\n\n1993\n\nDonna records a well received rendition of \"La Vie En rose\" which is included in the tribute album \"Tribute To Edith Piaf\", which also includes Piaf songs recorded by Ann Wilson (Heart), Pat Benatar, Emmylou Harris, Leon Russell and others.\n\n​\n\n1994\n\nDonna makes her first appearance on the sitcom \"Family Matter\", starring Jaleel White as Steve Urkel. Summer plays Urkel's shy Aunt Oona.\n\n​\n\n1994\n\n1994 sees the release of another hits compilation this one, Endless Summer: Greatest Hits\" sells well worldwide. #90 US, #75 Netherlands, #10 New Zealand and #37 UK. Two singles are released from the compilation \"Melody Of Love\" which became Donna's 10th #1 hit on the US Dance charts and also reached #21 in the UK. The second single \"Any Way At All\" did not chart.\n\n1994\n\nHaving signed with Mercury/Polygram in 1993 Donna releases \"Christmas Spirit\" on October 4, 1994. The album does not chart but remains a consistent favorite every Christmas season.\n\n​\n\n​​\n\n1995\n\nIn 1995 Donna and her family move from Sherman Oaks, California to Nashville, Tennessee. During this time Donna took some time off to focus on painting, a hobby she started in the early 80's and continued throughout her life.\n\n​\n\n1995\n\nDonna's mother, Mary Gaines, passes away of pancreatic cancer.\n\n​\n\n​1995\n\n\"I Feel Love (Rollo & Sister Bliss Monster Mix)\" is released by Polygram and fares well on the charts reaching #9 on the US Dance chart, #24 (Ireland), #26 (Netherlands) and #8 (UK).\n\n​\n\n1996\n\n1996 is an exciting year for Donna Summer fans as her 1981 album \"I'm A Rainbow\" is finally released. The album was originally recorded for Geffen Records in 1980-81 and was produced by Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte. Geffen shelved the album siting it's material was stale. The album was finally released on the Mercury label. Songs on the album include a tasty rendition of \"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\", \"Highway Runner\" which showed up on the \"Fast Times At Ridgemont High\" soundtrack and \"Romeo\" which appeared on the \"Flashdance\" soundtrack.
