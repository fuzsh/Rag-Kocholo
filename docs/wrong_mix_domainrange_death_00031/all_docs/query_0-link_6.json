        "text": "This year’s 36th annual Candlelight Concert took its guests back to the ’70s with a dazzling holiday discotheque setting in Orange County Performing Arts Center’s Segerstrom Hall Friday night, December 4. Studio 54 couldn’t have looked this good! “We are going to take you back to the 1970s with ‘disco-licious’ Donna Summer,” Candlelight chair Marta Bhathal said in her remarks. “The Disco Queen,” as Summer is still called today, certainly did her job, entertaining with that same rich, vibrant voice we know so well. With her 10-piece band accompanying her, Summer led guests to the holigram-lit dance floor with a huge mirrored disco ball overhead to dance and sing-a-long to such hits as “Bad Girls,” “Last Dance,” “On the Radio,” and “Hot Stuff,” and, at one point, selecting four ladies to come up on stage as back-up singers. Wailing away were Michele Forsyte, Julie Fishman, Sara Meehan, and Annie Andrews.\n\nEarlier in the evening, the 415 guests were welcomed curbside with commemorative photos and carolers from the Orange County High School of the Arts singing songs of the season before ascending the mirrored grand staircase to the Orchestra Level for a cocktail reception featuring Grey Goose martinis. Entering Segerstrom Hall to see the 1,000-seat orchestra level seating covered with terraces for dining was quite the treat. The engraved acrylic dinner tables, lit from below with holiday colors of red or green, were centered with festive white floral centerpieces accented with colorful Christmas ornaments and a homey white-shaded lamp. Oversized movie screens, featuring legendary scenes from classic holiday motion pictures, created a warm, nostalgic glow as guests dined on a four-course repast, thanks to The Patina Group chefs Greg Wiele and Joachim Splichal. Wines, courtesy of Tim and Stephanie Busch and Trinitas Winery, were paired with the delicious courses.\n\nCenter President Terry Dwyer and Board Chairman Tom McKernan voiced the requisite thanks to the chairs, committee, underwriters, and board of directors for their efforts in making the effort so successful – nearly $1 million in net proceeds successful! Bhathal and her co-chair Liz Merage thanked their committee, including underwriting co-chairs Pat Poss and Carol Wilken, underwriters’ reception chairs Valaree and Robert Wahler and opportunity drawing chair Janis Agopian.\n\nA diamond and Tahitian black pearl necklace was presented to Bhathal and a pair of diamond Baroque pearl earrings to Merage from Mardo Fine Jewelry for their efforts. Lady guests departed with Rosenthal crystal paperweights and the men with a bottle of cabernet sauvignon, courtesy of Mardo, but not before joining the disco DJ for some more hot disco dancing.\n\n* * *\n\n“Robin and I were raised beyond poor,” Dr. Phil McGraw stated of he and his wife at the annual CASA holiday luncheon held Friday at The Ritz-Carlton, Laguna Niguel. “We know what it’s like to go through this world without a guiding hand and, being a professional and in the mental health industry, I’ve seen what happens to those kids who fall through the cracks. So, when we found out about CASA, it was a perfect fit for us.”\n\n“Dr. Phil,” as he is known as host of the very successful daytime talk show by the same name, and his wife Robin McGraw are the official spokespersons for the National Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) Association’s “Forgotten Children” campaign, launched in the spring of 2008. Since then, inquiries to CASA have risen more than 60%, the largest number of inquiries in one year since its inception 31 years ago. The campaign is an effort to raise awareness of foster children and recruit much-needed CASA volunteer advocates, who work together with the court system in the best interests of the foster children.\n\n“There are a 500,000 kids in the foster care system,” Dr. Phil said, “and half of them, or 246,000, don’t have an advocate at all. They’re just one of many in a thick case file on a social worker’s desk, and we’ve got to close that gap.” Phil went on to say that statistics have proved that those foster kids who have an advocate spend 50% less time in the system as those who don’t, which means they get in, get placed and get out to have a chance of traction in life. “When they age out with no family member for support, they’re lost,” he said. Robin said her involvement was on more of a personal level as a wife and mother. “I’d bring all 246,000 of them home if I could,” she said. In February, Robin will draw attention to the newest crop of CASA volunteers when she will attend training courses to become a CASA child advocate herself.\n\nThe Friends of CASA-sponsored fundraiser, which drew a sold-out crowd of 569 and netted $175,000 for the cause, was chaired by Deborah Keillor, who said she got involved with CASA when a good friend told her about her experiences in the foster care system. “I heard about CASA and wanted to help,” she said. Keillor acknowledged the 180-item silent auction co-chairs Annette Juptner Gonzalez and Shelly Rankin and underwriting co-chairs Teri Pitchess and Melinda Wood, as well as South Coast Plaza Director of Community Relations Kathryn Glassmyer, who was responsible for acquiring the Michael Kors 2010 spring collection – just off the runways of New York Fashion Week. The top-notch runway show, which featured fashions from the Michael Kors boutique at South Coast Plaza, was very well received.\n\nCASA of Orange County’s Executive Director Gregory Bradbard encouraged guests to grant a CASA child’s Starfish holiday wish, which decorated three Starfish trees at the event and were wishes by actual foster children. Later, it was determined that guests contributed an impressive $28,000 to grant wishes.\n\nFormer foster youth and Court Appointed Special Advocate of Orange County’s Youth of the Year Sandy Phan brought the CASA message home in her remarks, telling of her journey as an out-of-control teenager to the present day being the first person in her family to graduate high school and go to college. She credits her group home, Young Life Enrichment, her advocate, Mary Roda, and the CASA agency for her success. “CASA gave me hope and with that hope and their help, I became who I am today,” she said. Quoting Isaac Newton, who said, “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants,” Phan said in closing, “CASA has not only placed me on their shoulders, but has held me higher so that I might be able to reach for the stars.”"
