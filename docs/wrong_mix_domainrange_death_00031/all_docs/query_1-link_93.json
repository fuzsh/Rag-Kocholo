        "text": "Donna Summer’s death has taken a lot of people by surprise including Gloria Gaynor. I spoke with her by phone today from Morocco where she is performing. In fact, she learned of Summer’s death when my station made a call to her to arrange an interview.\n\nWhen it comes to disco there are two names that eclipse all others: Donna Summer and Gloria Gaynor. So I am thrilled that Gloria took time to speak with me about such a close peer.\n\nGloria told me that she first met Summer when they both appeared on a tv show together in California in 1970s. She said her favorite Summer song is “MacArthur Park” because she believes of her hits this song shows Summer’s depth and breadth as an artist. Gloria also told me that she plans to sing a tribute to Summer in her upcoming concerts.\n\nI think as it’s explored more, the lyrics to all those Donna Summer hits pigeon holed as (albeit booty shakin’) dance music of the disco heyday will be given a second look. “She Works Hard For The Money” is an anthem of female empowerment that came at a time when not only more women entered the workforce, but more women were single mothers holding a full time job and raising children. “Hot Stuff”, well, there’s no question what she’s singing about. But remember when it was released: 1979, more than a decade after the women’s liberation movement of 1960s and just as the United States was about to take a conservative turn culturally and politically. On the surface it’s a club song about sex but I like to look between the drum process. It’s a song that says what everyone with blood in their veins has felt and desired and why shouldn’t a woman be able to sing about it?\n\nI asked Gloria how she thought Donna Summer will be remembered.\n\n“As an artist who warmed the heart and moved the body.”\n\nNo one could say it better."
