        "text": "Original Studio 54 & The Saint NYC Resident DJ Robbie Leslie comes to Palm Springs for the kick-off of Dirty Disco’s first Daytime Tea at Palm Springs newest and largest LGBTQAI+ nightclub, REFORMA.\n\nPalm Springs, CA\n\nThe nine-city, International traveling party, celebrating the legendary hits of the 70s & 80s, mixed with the current Nu-Disco hits of today, as remixed by the team of Dirty Disco & Matt Consola, has been a runaway hit, playing to Palm Springs crowds of 500 or more, since it’s debut in 2020. Currently taking place every other first Saturday Night of the month at Chill Bar on Arenas, starting April 1st (no joke), Dirty Disco branches out as a Daytime Saturday Tea Dance (4pm-9pm) at Chill’s new sister property, REFORMA PS.\n\nResident DJ Matt Consola welcomes original Studio54 & The Saint NYC DJ, Robbie Leslie, for a special Dirty Disco presents: TEA at Studio 54. Consola will start out the evening for two hours with the established Dirty Disco sound and then Robbie Leslie will take the partygoers on a 3-hour classic NYC discothèque Journey like his days at Studio, The Saint, Palladium, and Ice Palace (just to name a few iconic clubs), as well as his weekly DJ mixed show, Robbie Leslie Presents every Friday at 6pm & Sundays at 10pm on the SiriusXM Studio 54 station.\n\nCreated by the team of Matt Consola and Mark DeLange, the Dirty Disco party is not your typical Disco & Funk party. Consola, the owner of Swishcraft Music, America’s largest LGBTQAI+ dance label, and DeLange, the owner of Dirty Disco Music and iconic Queer dance venues including The Houston Eagle, both also have the distinction of being world famous, multi-Billboard Dance #1 Remix producers, having separately and together produced more than 5,000 official & private dance remixes of artists including Lady Gaga, Dua Lipa, Miley Cyrus, Cher, Lizzo, Sam Smith, Beck, Taylor Swift, and Madonna to The Bee Gees, KC & The Sunshine Band, Donna Summer, Diana Ross, Sister Sledge, Dead or Alive, Erasure, and Michael Jackson over the course of their 30+ years in the industry. Their party, Dirty Disco, exclusively plays their Dirty Disco & Matt Consola remixes of 70s & 80s Disco, Funk, and New Wave classics mixed with their remixes of current “Nu-Disco” hits, a disco-house hybrid dance genre currently dominating today’s clubs and commercial radio by artist such as Purple Disco Machine, Block & Crown, Kylie Minogue, Dua Lipa, Beyoncé, Lizzo, Daft Punk, and many others.\n\nWith recurring party locations in Houston, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Denver, Wilton Manors, Vancouver BC, and Puerto Vallarta, it’s the overwhelming success of their Palm Springs party that has Dirty Disco happening 6 times a year plus Palm Springs Pride in November.\n\n“Because I want this party to celebrate our local population”, states Consola, “I will be offering all Coachella Valley residents FREE ENTRANCE with local ID from 4pm-5pm.” For all others, it will be $5.00 in advance and $10 at the door.\n\nConsola continues, “Flaggers & Fan Dancers will take to the stage while sexy retro go-go dancers and go-go drag performers, led by Palm Springs’ own Instagram sensation @Barnabysdaddy, will shake their groove thangs.” Consola finishes by saying,” I encourage everyone to break out those Cha Cha heels, sparkly 70’s outfits, (costumes are strongly encouraged) and dance the night away in a glamorous world of spinning lights and pounding disco beats.”\n\nREFORMA PS is Palm Springs’s newest LGBTQAI+ owned club, lounge, and restaurant, just steps outside the Arenas district. Recently launched in February 2023 by Chill Bar owners Rob Giesecke and husband, Bill Vastardis, this 9,000 square foot space to dine, play and be entertained, with it’s state-of-the-art sound and lighting, is the largest venue of this type in all of Coachella Valley.\n\nLike this story?
