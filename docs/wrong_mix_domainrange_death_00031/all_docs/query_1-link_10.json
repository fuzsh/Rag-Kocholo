        "text": "When Donna Summer died of lung cancer earlier this month, disco truly died with it's Queen. And as we've seen with other singing sensations of her magnitude, sales of her albums have increased tremendously. This will be very lucrative for her estate. However, maybe not as lucrative as it could have been.\n\nAccording to Billboard almost half of Summer's trove of musical treasures are not even available to buy on the market! And her estate owns most of the rights to these albums. This will surely have a huge impact on the amount of money that her estate could be receiving. Especially given that the material that is available has been estimated to sell upward of 40,000 copies, much of which will most likely go to the record companies that own them.\n\nAt the time of her death Donna Summer had an estimated worth of about $75million.\n\nPlease contact a professional estate litigation Attorney to get advice on how to maximize the potential income that your estate may receive after your death.\n\n*This blog entry was not written by an Attorney and should not be constituted as professional legal advice."
