        "text": "Did inhaling toxic air from the collapse of the Twin Towers on 9/11 give Donna Summer the lung cancer that eventually killed her?\n\nThe singer thought so, friends have told TMZ.\n\nSummer was in her apartment near ground zero during the terrorist attacks. In the years following 9/11, friends say, she was paranoid about dust, hanging silk sheets in her dressing room and spraying disinfectant in the air.\n\nSummer, 63, died Thursday after a long battle with lung cancer.\n\nStudies have found people exposed to the dust and fumes from 9/11 are at a risk for health problems. Cancer rates have tripled for police officers who were on the scene.\n\nBut by her own admission, Summer sequestered herself in her apartment after the terrorist attacks. And there is that little matter of her smoking cigarettes for years and frequenting clubs with lots of secondhand smoke.\n\nNo one should question her authority on the cause of her cancer; after all, she was very intuitive.\n\nIn 2008, she said in an interview that she had a premonition about the attack a month before it happened. “My husband and I were walking down the street. I had this feeling. I said, ‘Honey, I feel like terrorism, high on top of the buildings.’ I knew something was going to happen. When it did, I flipped out.”"
