        "text": "Donna at the Mountain Winery, Saratoga\n\nFirst, if you are a DS fan and if you havenât bought tickets yet -- don't walk, run to see these shows!!!\n\nThis new show was 100% (if not more) better than those of the previously years. Now this wasn't a Cher or Bette Midler extravaganza, but they couldn't sing half as well as Donna (Cher and Bette are brilliant in many other ways). Some songs were done with skits and most utilized the LED graphics/movies screen; it was almost like a variety show on Broadway. There were 4.5 costume changes, again, very lovely and very appropriate for our Donna, but no Bob Mackie.\n\nThe Mountain Winery Theatre (an outdoor stage) and the surrounding grounds are still until under renovation, but the venue is already stunning. (The Mountain Winery was first bought by Paul Masson, a pioneer California vintner). The new seats are more comfortable; yes, I was in the \"VIP box seats\" area, but just as I don't necessary prefer boxes at the operas, I'd rather be closer to this stage. That being said, it was much easier to stand up and dance in the \"box seat\"; and did I have an aerobic workout!\n\nThere was an almost full moon yesterday, a clear sky, and with all those city lights in Silicone Valley below, it was truly a magical and mystical night! Donna said in the beginning that she loves this venue and it was almost like singing directly to God; I believe it was not just stage talk.\n\nSpoilers below (and sorry, for more rambling, and I probably have A.D.D.) --\n\nGetting the easy part out first, this is the song list:\n\n[Intro: Electronic Beethoven's Fifth / Changing of the Guards.)\n\nThe Queen is Back\n\nI Feel Love\n\nDim all the Lights\n\nI'm a Fire\n\nSand on my Feet\n\nOn the Radio\n\nMr. Music\n\nCrayons\n\n--- intermission ---\n\nNo More Tears (Enough is Enough)\n\nMacArthur Park\n\nBring Down the Reign\n\nSlide Over Backwards\n\nSelah [Mary Ellen Bernard]\n\nShe Works Hard for the Money\n\nBad Girls\n\nHot Stuff\n\nLast Dance [Encore]\n\nBruce wasn't there yesterday, is he out promoting his album? However, the three lady backup singers and the three boy dancers (oh, I LOVE the cute white boy) balanced it out well l. As I said, this is not a Las Vegas Celine Dion show, but the LED(?) screens synced extremely well with the songs. The Hattie Mae skit is funny. I was quite surprised by Bring Down the Reign and didn't know if she has done this in other concerts before (Cathy must know). I love BDTR, but I do miss Con Te Partiro, Driving Down Brazil, Be Myself Again, and Fame (the Game). I really hope she will do all of them at Paramount this Saturday, or at least the latter two. Donna people? Can you hear me? Anyway, I encourage you to visit < http://www.savedarfur.org>, make a donation for a loved one or in Donnaâs name. We must stop this genocide! [Okay, stepping off the podium now.]\n\nI would say the venue was three-quarters full, but the energy and enthusiasm from the audience were much more than I expected! I thought we were mostly Silicon Valley middle-aged professionals and more mature season tickets holders of the concert series, but there were people up dancing with almost very song (of course, BDTR was a sit down), and the ladies were up swaying from the very beginning. There were three stretch limos that I saw in the VIP parking lot with people attending in style. Silly me, I thought Donna was in one of them :-( Almost the entire audience was up on their feet for OTR, and the crowd went completely wild with all the classics. Couples were also slow dancing right in front of the stage to the slower (or the slower part of) songs, it was sweet. There was an=2 0organic standing ovation right after MacArthur Park! Being fair and balanced, an obviously intoxicated, rotund guy did say he love the oldies and hate the new songs, but then I also helped a group of lady to write down the names of all the songs so they could buy it on iTunes.\n\nOne negative part, they didn't allow photography (they said it was the artist's request). They told my friend to check his camera; I sneaked in mine but I couldn't even squeeze in a single good picture of Donna since the photo Nazis were monitoring :-( I decided to just dance yesterday and try for more photographs at the Paramount. Yes...it does say no camera on that ticket too but they have to stop me again (and ply my camera off my cold dead hand). I believe in the artistâs rights and I think it is wrong for some to tape the whole concert or whole songs to be put it on YouTube, but no-flash photography by ardent fans??? [Off my soapbox again.]\n\nBased on the general audience reaction at the Mountain Winery last night, and with all the GBLT (just because I like the sound of giblets) folks who will be attending, I predict that Donna will ABSOLUTELY blow off the roof, and bring down the house at the Paramount Theatre. Donna might have one of the warmest Welcome-Back-to-the-SF-Bay-Area reception. Donna people, please do the Castro Theatre next time; okay, at least Oakland is one step closer.\n\nOf course, I felt sad at the end of the concert and longed for more. I really want=2 0to meet other forum members. I think the post-Paramount fan gathering will be wonderful. I myself need a wind down period, but maybe some of you will like more dancing. Thank you Hector and his friend at Bench and Bar (and Cathy for posting it). I think if enough of us show up, the bar might play more Donna Summer music; otherwise, we might feel like leaving after just one drink. âItâs Only Loveâ will be nice, maybe the cute young dancers will join us too, maybe even Donna (â¦take me down to a land of a thousand dreams).\n\nMy white, disco, cowboy hat got a lot of compliments too. Guess I would wear it to the Paramount again. So come over and say âHiâ at the Paramount. I am the short Chinese guy in the white, disco, cowboy hat. :-)\n\n- Ben\n\n[Editor's note: this is the first time Bring Down The Reign has been performed in this tour!]"
