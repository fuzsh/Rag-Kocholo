        "text": "Singer Donna Summer, who found fame as one of the biggest stars of the disco era, died Thursday of cancer, according to news reports. She was 63.\n\nSummer, whose hits included such songs as “Hot Stuff,” “Bad Girls” and “MacArthur Park,” won five Grammys in a career that started with her work in musical theater and as a studio backup singer before she exploded in the latter half of the ‘70s as one of the most recognizable stars of the disco scene.\n\n“Early this morning, we lost Donna Summer Sudano, a woman of many gifts, the greatest being her faith,” her family said in a statement released Thursday. “While we grieve her passing, we are at peace celebrating her extraordinary life and her continued legacy. Words truly can’t express how much we appreciate your prayers and love for our family at this sensitive time.”\n\nHer breathy and seductive vocals on “Love To Love You Baby” turned into her first hit record on its release in 1975, with controversy over her moans and groans of pleasure on the track causing some radio stations to ban it even as club-goers grooved to a longer version that reached 17 minutes or so.\n\nIn 1978, she earned her first No. 1 single with a cover of “MacArthur Park,” also acting in the movie “Thank God It’s Friday,” which produced the hit single “Last Dance,” the single that won Summer her first Grammy.\n\nThe concept album Bad Girls followed in 1979, with its title track, “Hot Stuff,” and “Dim All The Lights” among its best-known tracks. Moving into the ‘80s, Summer tried to break away from disco and expand her work into other parts of pop and rock ‘n’ roll. The 1983 album She Works Hard For Her Money was another success, with its title track a hit single and popular video on the still-new-at-the-time MTV.\n\nIn recent years, she had continued success with dance records, and toured regularly. In 2008, she played two nights at the Hollywood Bowl while touring behind Crayons, her first album of new material since 1991. (See our review for the first of those shows here.) In 2009, she played the Orange County Performing Arts Center, her last local appearance, if we’re not mistaken.\n\nSummer was in Florida when she died. She is survived by her husband Bruce Sudano and three daughters."
