The old African gods have taken on new forms since they arrived in North America, their spirits manifesting in turntable wizardry, improvisational skills, rituals and performances. Through meetings with musicians, writers and artists, miracle healers, gumbo cooks and Mississippi bluesmen, James explores a culture that has always drawn on a unique mix of different ethnic influences to produce its diversity, allure and vitality. Tickets are $9.50 for general admission and $7.50 for members, seniors and students. For more information go to http://hoodoo.stokedfilm.com/\n\nPioneers of African American Cinema is the result of a project to restore feature-length films, shorts and rare fragments representative of the work of early African American film artists. Their films often dealt with race very differently from Hollywood movies and were tailored to African American audiences.\n\n“The Bronze Buckaroo” (1939)stars native Detroiter Herb Jeffries as the dashing and brave singing cowboy Bob Blake, with Lucius Brooks as his comic sidekick. The plot revolves around Blake and his men trying to find their missing friend, who is being held by a land-grabbing rancher trying to force the friend to sign over the deed to his ranch. Also showing is a rare excerpt from Commandment Keeper Church in Beaufort South Carolina, from May 1940, filmed in the Sea Island community of Beaufort, depicting the religious practices of the Gullah people. Both films are free.\n\nApril 3, 2017 (Detroit)—The Detroit Film Theatre (DFT) at the Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA) is wrapping up this season’s Afrofuturism series with “The United States of Hoodoo” on April 15 at 9:30 p.m. Also in April is the last film in the DFT’s free Pioneers of African American Cinema series, “The Bronze Buckaroo,” which is followed by a rare clip of the religious practices of the Gullah people, showing April 22 at 3 p.m.\n\nFor its ongoing Afrofuturism series, the DFT invited Afrotopia founder, Ingrid LaFleur, to curate and introduce a series of films exploring the art of Afrofuturism, an aesthetic movement of African diaspora writers, musicians, visual artists and filmmakers that explores black futures through techno-culture and science fiction.\n\n“The United States of Hoodoo” (2017) follows author Darius James on his personal journey and cultural voyage across the continent to discover how African-based spirituality has influenced America´s popular culture.
