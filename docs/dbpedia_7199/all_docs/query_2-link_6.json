It consists of two reels of positive 16mm acetate film (a) and (b), is in black and white and contains sound. A single row of perforations runs along one edge of each film strip, while a variable-area optical-sound (audio on film) track runs along the other.\n\nIn the opening scene, four cowboys ride through a desert before stopping and having a drink. They then engage in a conversation about their missing friend Joe, before resuming their journey. In the next scene, a man sits on a wooden fence reading from a paper as the camera cuts to four animals that surround him: a barking dog, a cow, a donkey and a chicken. At one point the man reads, “To throw the voice for a greater distance, it is imperative that…” before the camera cuts back to the group of riding cowboys.\n\nThe film continues by chronicling the experiences the four cowboys encounter as they search for Joe. Upon their arrival to Joe’s ranch, the men are informed by Joe’s sister that Joe has been missing for weeks. They eventually realize that Joe’s neighbors are holding him hostage over a land dispute.\n\nPlace depicted\n\nArizona, United States, North and Central America\n\nPlace filmed\n\nSan Bernardino County, California, United States, North and Central America\n\nClassification\n\nTime-based Media - Moving Images\n\nType\n\nsound films\n\nblack-and-white films (visual works)\n\nrelease prints (motion pictures)\n\nfeature films\n\n16mm (photographic film size)\n\nTopic\n\nAmerican West\n\nFilm\n\nRace films\n\nWestern films\n\nCredit Line\n\nCollection of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, Gift of Randall and Sam Nieman\n\nObject number\n\n2015.167.4.1ab\n\nRestrictions & Rights\n\nUnknown - Restrictions Possible\n\nRights assessment and proper usage is the responsibility of the user.\n\nGUID\n\nhttp://n2t.net/ark:/65665/fd5d96e3200-eb3f-4304-a07f-87fbbb4586ba\n\nCataloging is an ongoing process and we may update this record as we conduct additional research and review.
