        "text": "Born in Detroit in 1911 or 1913 or 1914, Herb Jeffries is a great singer ... and his rich baritone enhanced the legendary Duke Ellington Orchestra beginning around 1940. Prior to his connection with Ellington, Jeffries sang with the Earl 'Fatha' Hines.\n\nIn between all of this - and most often billed as Herbert Jeffrey - he strapped on a brace of six-guns and rode the Hollywood range in a quartet of B westerns in the late 1930s.\n\nIn westerns (and other films), it was common to typecast performers based on their race, ethnicity, etc. That was a time of Hollywood stereotypes, and black performers were generally given minor roles as a servant, porter, cook, et al. While I'm no expert on the subject, there was a market for films featuring black performers and there were many black only theaters.\n\nHerb Jeffries' first oater was HARLEM ON THE PRAIRIE (1937), and the producer was none other than Jed Buell. Handling the directing chores was prolific Sam Newfield. Buell's career began with the Mack Sennett studio and later, he produced many of the Fred Scott singin' westerns which were released by Spectrum. And in 1938, Buell created a film that remains unique in Hollywood history - the movie was THE TERROR OF TINY TOWN which featured an all midget cast playing cowboys and cowgirls.\n\nOver the course of the next year or two, Jeffries did three more sagebrush yarns, TWO GUN MAN FROM HARLEM (1938), THE BRONZE BUCKAROO (1939), and HARLEM RIDES THE RANGE (1939). Buell was not involved in these productions -- Richard C. Kahn had assumed those duties. The films were distributed by Al Sack via his Texas-based Sack Amusement Enterprises.\n\nCast members in the Jeffries films included Mantan Moreland, best remembered for his role as chauffeur 'Birmingham Brown' in the Charlie Chan series. Spencer Williams worked in front and behind the camera - Williams was 'Andy Brown' in the AMOS & ANDY TVer of the early 1950s.\n\nHans Wollstein provided info on the vocal groups that appeared in the films. In HARLEM RIDES THE RANGE, there are two: The Four Tones (Lucius Brooks, Rudolph Hunter, Leon Buck and Ira Hardin) and The Four Blackbirds (James Davis, Edward Brandon, Reg Anderson and Jack Williams). The Four Tones also appeared in HARLEM ON THE PRAIRIE, THE BRONZE BUCKAROO, and TWO-GUN MAN FROM HARLEM.\n\nAnother film or two were in the planning stages, but were never made. Any chances to continue the series ended when Jeffries signed on as the lead vocalist with the Ellington band, circa 1939 or '40. He served in World War II and, after the war, lived for a dozen years in France.\n\nJeffries was a recipient of a Golden Boot award in 1996.\n\nThe first and only black hero/lead in the old B westerns deserves a page on the Old Corral.\n\nJeffries passed away from heart failure on Sunday, May 25, 2014 West Hills Hospital and Medical Center, West Hills, California.
