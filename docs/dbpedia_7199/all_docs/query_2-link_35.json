Original Vintage Movie Lobby Card. Hollywood Productions, 1939. Measures 11\" x 14\" in color and sepia tones.The plot follows Jeffries as a cowboy who attempts to locate his missing friend who was kidnapped by a land grabber. This film, as with all black films of the 1930s, was produced with the aim to represent African Americans fairly. Through these ethnic films, African American actors could escape the roles of unwitting sources of comedic relief to become stars in their own shows. It is considered the first Black Western Musical. Perfecting his horsemanship and performing many of his own stunts, Jeffries gave African-American kids a hero to root for - a minority movie icon. Lobby card features a still image from the film and text stating \"Herbert Jeffrey and an All Colored Cast\" and \"A Richard C. Khan Production\" and \"Distributed by Sack Amusement Enterprises\". Lobby Card also features an illustration of a cowboy on a horse next to the film image. Small pinholes in corners and minor wear around the edges and top that does not affect the image. Overall, in very good condition. - 1946 All Black Cast film \"The Bronze Buckaroo\" vintage lobby card archive",
