        "text": "In 1935, Herb Jeffries was a jazz vocalist touring with Earl “Fatha” Hines and his band through the American South. As Jeffries recalled in a documentary on his life, on a break between sets one evening, he and the other musicians stood at the stage door and watched as a group of kids playing in the alley ran off, leaving one boy behind crying. Jeffries asked him if the others had hurt him. “No, they’re my friends,” the young boy replied, “but we’re playing cowboy, and they won’t let me be Tom Mix.” Herb Jeffries asked why, and the boy’s voice broke as he replied: “Because Tom Mix ain’t Black.”\n\nWesterns were the most popular film genre of the 1930s, with plots that offered escapism, romance, and adventure amid the Great Depression. Audiences of all kinds thronged to theater rows and balconies to watch stars like Mix play the Hollywood-embellished myth of the cowboy as a timeless and heroic figure. Yet movie theaters were still segregated, and Black and brown audiences watched actors and storylines that didn’t reflect their realities. Historically, it’s estimated that one in four cowboys of the American West was Black, and according to Kendall Nelson, author of Gathering Remnants: A Tribute to the Working Cowboy, one in three was a Mexican vaquero. It wasn’t until Herb Jeffries became the first singing cowboy to play a Western hero who didn’t identify as white that audiences saw that legacy represented on screen.\n\nHerb Jeffries was born Umberto Valentino in 1913. From birth, he wasn’t sure exactly where he fit in. His mother, Fern, was Irish, and his Sicilian-Moorish father, had died in World War I before he was born. Fern, a seamstress, was pregnant with her son when she fell in love with Howard Jeffrey, an Ethiopian presser in her shop. Together, Fern and Howard overcame ubiquitous bigotry and honored their relationship by marrying before interracial marriage was legally recognized by the United States. Young Jeffries called Howard his father and took his name (later changing it to Jeffries). Growing up in Detroit in the early 1920s, he found identity and community in the diversity of his neighborhood, saying in the 2008 documentary A Colored Life: The Herb Jeffries Story, “We had many races living there, and we all got along very well without money [...] We had a lot of Jewish people there. We had, what we were called during that time, Negroes, who lived there.”\n\nAs a young man, Jeffries was drawn to music that reflected the blend of cultures he had grown up with, and no genre reflected the diversity of America as thrillingly as jazz. In what almost sounds like a jazz-age myth, Jeffries was discovered performing in a speakeasy by Louis Armstrong, who told him he should get out of Detroit and go on the road. As the years went by, Jeffries made a name for himself as a jazz singer famous for his elegant phrasing and debonair persona. Then he met another person who changed the trajectory of his life—the young boy he spoke to who wanted to be Tom Mix.\n\nAssuming there’s a heaven for cowboys, Jeffries is likely listening to Cowboy Carter on repeat. With her eighth solo studio album, Beyoncé surveys the contemporary landscape of America as she sits sidesaddle on a white stallion. Over 27 tracks, she blazes a trail through country music past and present, reterritorializing some well-worn roads. Like Jeffries before her, Beyoncé’s identity as a performer is intrinsic to the social justice she embodies.\n\nCowboy Carter is punctuated by “KNTRY Radio” interludes, an imaginary station hosted by Willie Nelson. We hear past musical innovators through a time-traveling transistor radio: Blues pioneer Charles Anderson’s “blue yodel,” the Mississippi Delta Blues legend Son House, and one of the greatest progenitors of rock and roll, Sister Rosetta Tharpe. This is all American country music, Beyoncé seems to be saying. Her album weaves like a barrel racer through rhythm and blues, gospel, hip-hop, and country Western genres—fusing them all. Beyoncé has said that Cowboy Carter was inspired by her experience of feeling excluded from country music as a Black artist. Yet it would do the work a disservice to consider it merely a clap back; it is not so much a response, as it is a reorientation for an audience miseducated on the origins of cowboy culture in the first place.\n\nReading a newspaper one day on tour in 1936, Jeffries came across the name of Jed Buell, an independent producer of B pictures that were widely distributed. Jeffries wanted to voice his feeling that a Western made specifically for non-white audiences would be successful. To his surprise, Buell asked if he wanted to write and star in the pictures himself. Jeffries was not an actor or a writer, yet with an audience already established from his musical career, he was in much the same vein as Gene Autry or Roy Rogers, musicians who had brought their loyal fans with them when they transitioned from radio to film. Black-identifying himself, Jeffries took seriously both the honor and the responsibility of representing a new Western hero. He saw a pile of unmade scripts on Buell’s desk. At random, he picked one up with a generic Western title—Sunset on the Prairie—and proposed they simply use a screenplay that was already written, adding specific tweaks that would resonate with Black audiences. Sunset on the Prairie became Harlem on the Prairie. Jeffries stood with one foot in the mythological West and the other in a Harlem of the mind—and unified them."
