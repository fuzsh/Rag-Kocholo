        "text": "My interest in the Twenties steered me to Magic in the Moonlight, a film that came out last year starring Colin Firth and Emma Stone. It’s a light, romantic comedy set in 1928 along the Mediterranean coast of France and the plot sounded somewhat like the plot of my own first novel, The Impersonator, so I knew I’d enjoy it.\n\nAn experienced magician is asked by another magician friend to debunk a young woman who claims to be able to contact the spirits. The friend says he’s tried but can’t figure out how she does it. So the cocky Colin Firth enters the scene. (He’s playing a part that Houdini played in real life, debunking fake mediums.) Of course, he falls for the woman. Frustratingly, he can’t figure out how she’s doing it either, and at last he concludes that he was wrong, that some people really can contact the spirits of the dead in seances. And then there’s the ending.\n\nMy main character, Jessie, has worked for magicians in her younger days and has participated in similar scams to bilk gullible people who want to contact the spirits of their dead relatives. Jessie knows the tricks. She would have known this one. I did not!\n\nIt didn’t make much of a splash in theaters, but it’s available through Netflix. I recommend it to those who enjoy the clothing and cars of the era–not to mention the beautiful scenery.\n\nI came across this last year and saved it because I believe I can use the information. One of my characters passes as white, and I’m basing him on Jeffries.\n\nHerb Jeffries, who sang with Duke Ellington and starred in early black westerns as a singing cowboy known as “the Bronze Buckaroo” — a nickname that evoked his malleable racial identity — died on Sunday in West Hills, Calif. He was believed to be 100. The cause was heart failure, said Raymond Strait, who worked on Jeffries’s autobiography. Over the course of his century, Jeffries changed his name, altered his age, married five women and stretched his vocal range from near falsetto to something closer to a Bing Crosby baritone. He shifted from jazz to country and back again. Jeffries’s racial and ethnic identity was itself something of a performance. He told some people that his father was African-American, others that he was mixed race and still others that he was Ethiopian or Sicilian. He told people he chose to be black — to the extent that a mixed-race person had a choice at the time. “He told me he had to make this decision about whether he should try to pass as white,” the jazz critic Gary Giddins recalled. “He said: ‘I just knew that my life would be more interesting as a black guy. If I’d chosen to live my life passing as white, I’d have never been able to sing with Duke Ellington.’ ”\n\nAccording to the L.A. Times, his movies “had titles such as “Harlem Rides the Range” and “The Bronze Buckaroo” and featured the tall, handsome, wavy-haired singer with a Gable-esque mustache as a dashing, white-hatted good guy in a black western outfit and riding a white horse named Stardusk. The idea to make movie westerns with all-black casts was Jeffries’.\n\n“Little children of dark skin — not just Negroes, but Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, everybody of color — had no heroes in the movies,” he told The Times in 1998. “I was so glad to give them something to identify with.”\n\nHe was born Umberto Valentino in Detroit on Sept. 24, 1913. “My mother was Irish, my father was Sicilian, and one of my great-grandparents was Ethiopian,” Jeffries, who took his stepfather’s last name, told the Oklahoman in 2004. “So I’m an Italian-looking mongrel with a percentage of Ethiopian blood, which enabled me to get work with black orchestras.” . . . But finding an African American who could ride, sing, and act was difficult — until the tall, broad-shouldered Jeffries, who learned to ride on his grandfather’s dairy farm in Michigan, nominated himself.\n\n“No way. They’ll never buy you; you’re not black enough,” the light-skinned Jeffries remembered Buell saying. Jeffries said Buell finally agreed to let him play the part but insisted that Jeffries wear makeup to darken his skin.\n\n“Harlem on the Prairie,” billed as “the first all-Negro musical western,” was released in 1937. Among the all-black cast members were Spencer Williams, who later portrayed Andy on “Amos ‘n’ Andy” on television, and comedian Mantan Moreland, who provided comic relief. Jeffries earned $5,000 for the film, which was shot at a dude ranch near Victorville in five days. Each of the films that followed were produced just as fast. In later years, Jeffries would jokingly refer to them as “C-movies.” But he took great pride in them.\n\n“To say I was the first black singing cowboy on the face of this earth is a great satisfaction,” he told American Visions in 1997.\n\nIn an era when black actors typically played subservient roles on screen, Jeffries stood out. “Herb was a sex symbol,” New York University film professor Donald Bogle, author of “Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies & Bucks,” a history of black films, told The Times in 2003. “With his wavy hair and Clark Gable mustache, he might have been a different kind of star had America been a different kind of place.”\n\nI’ve now read two books by Beatrice Burton (FLAPPER WIFE and HOLLYWOOD GIRL), so I got curious about this woman who wrote in the mid-1920s–and who is helping me write my own stories today.\n\nHer first book, FLAPPER WIFE, was published in 1925, exactly the year my novels are set. Her last came out in 1937. During those 12 years, she published seventeen novels. I’ve read only two, but judging from the titles and short descriptions, they are all romances about young women finding happiness in marriage. Her books are set in the year they were written, so they provide a fascinating glimpse of the prejudices, fashions, slang, values, and surroundings of the era. No writer of historical fiction could ask for a better source!\n\nLittle is known of Ms.Burton’s life. (This is the only image I could find of her.) She was born in Cleveland in 1894 and died in Florida in 1983. She wanted to be an actress–and in fact had at least three small parts in silent movies in the 1920s–and this may explain her interest in Hollywood as a subject for her books and magazine articles. Six of her stories were made into (silent) movies, none of which seems to have survived. Too bad–I’d love to see the one that was based on FLAPPER WIFE."
