        "text": "Paul Robeson\n\nBorn in 1898, Paul Robeson was the son of a pastor who escaped enslavement in North Carolina, so the cause of freedom was very much at the forefront of his mind. Robeson was the ultimate multi-hyphenate before the term was coined: a Columbia University Law School graduate, a boundary-breaking Shakespearean actor of stage and screen, a lifelong activist, and a sublime singer with a heavenly baritone. He was a star. But like many of our greatest talents, amidst the McCarthyism of the 1950s his career was severely restricted. In addition to being blacklisted for his convictions and losing opportunities in the United States, Robeson had his passport revoked for a decade by the State Department, severely curtailing his ability to tour and make a living anywhere in the world.\n\nMust-watch performances: “Body and Soul” (Oscar Micheaux, 1925), “Show Boat” (James Whale, 1936); and “The Emperor Jones” (Dudley Murphy, 1933). For more on his life, we also recommend the Sidney Poitier-narrated documentary “Paul Robeson: Tribute to an Artist” (Saul Turrell, 1979), a unique, Oscar-winning short film tracing the trajectory of Robeson’s artistic and political evolution in parallel with changes in how he performed one of his signature songs, “Ol Man River.” Streaming via The Criterion Channel.\n\nNina Mae McKinney\n\nNina Mae McKinnery was one of the original triple threats — as Donald Bogle wrote in “Hollywood Black”: “A blazing talent, a terrific singer and dancer and a skilled actress.” Bogle also calls her “Hollywood’s first Black love goddess.” In 1929, McKinney was the first African American actress to star in a major mainstream film, “Hallelujah!” And yet, largely because of racism and timing, her opportunities were short-lived. The Hollywood establishment had little to offer her long term, so McKinney made race movies instead, and, like Josephine Baker, McKinney also sought work in Europe. Despite those roadblocks, McKinney remains one of few artists universally remembered and acclaimed by everyone we spoke to — film historians and fans alike.\n\nMust-watch performance: Hallelujah!” (King Vidor, 1929). Rhea Combs praises the versatility of McKinney’s performance in “Hallelujah!,” saying, “ Nina does a great job … she’s singing, she’s dancing, she’s performing. She carries the scene.” The clever 1932 musical short “Pie, Pie Blackbird,”which stars McKinney, the teenage Nicholas Brothers, and the Eubie Blake band, was a favorite of virtually everyone I spoke to including Bogle and Combs.\n\nLena Horne\n\nAs America’s first full-fledged Black screen goddess, Lena Horne couldn’t be called undersung, but she also doesn’t get the full credit for all the doors she opened and how hard-won those victories were. Her rise is a critical part of film and American civil rights history. She was a fantastic singer and actress, as her films show. But her performances also reflect a shift in the kind of roles Black performers could embody. As Bogle has documented, Horne personified an idealized “new Negro womanhood,” one that could be glamorous and removed from the stereotyped portrayals of sexless servitude that Hollywood reserved for Black women.\n\nMust-watch performances: “Cabin in the Sky” (Vincente Minnelli, 1943) and “Stormy Weather” (Andrew L. Stone, 1943). While “Stormy Weather” is Horne’s signature song and role, “Cabin in the Sky” is her granddaughter Jenny Lumet’s number one pick, for a role that she describes as a bit scandalous and allowing “a little more freedom and more playfulness.” Lumet adds, “What Vincente Minnelli did was just so smart and so funny and naughty and brilliant and I think she just had more fun.”\n\nLumet also strongly suggests viewing Horne’s performance of the song “Stormy Weather” in her one-woman Broadway show. The contrast is revealing and says something about studio influence. In the 1943 movie version, Lumet notes, there was “this very, very rigid structure” in terms of how Horne “was allowed to sing or present herself;” the studio even criticized her for opening her mouth too wide. As a result, in the movie you get a “porcelain version.” On Broadway, in contrast, Horne was in control: “There’s a seven-minute section of ‘The Lady and Her Music’ where she sings the song again, and you can see what it means to be free in yourself as an artist. That woman is seldom seen, and we saw her on stage during the run of that show, but that’s who Grandma was.”\n\nJames Edwards\n\nSometimes thought of as the actor who “preceded Poitier,” Edwards was a handsome, formally educated actor who started his career on the stage. By age 31, when he debuted in his first two movies, he had already gained critical acclaim on Broadway. Decades after Micheaux, Hollywood more fully acknowledged that America had a racism issue, and it began to produce what were sometimes called “Negro problem pictures.” One of the best of those lot was a version of the play “Home of the Brave,” retooled to illuminate racism and racial conflict rather than antisemitism. With his star turn as a Black soldier damaged by the racism of his fellow platoon members during World War II, Edwards becomes a sort of transitional figure – situated between the traditional subservient roles of the Hollywood movies of the 1920s and 1930s and the Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte roles of the 1950s and 1960s. As Bogle recounts, the role had a real impact: ”That’s really when Hollywood starts to deal with race as the theme of films.” Edwards is a black soldier, recovering from psychological and physical injuries he sustained while “fighting for the land of the free,” and “when a new generation sees him, they’re sort of startled.”\n\nMust-watch performance: “Home of the Brave” (Mark Robson, 1949).\n\nFayard and Harold Nicholas, aka “The Nicholas Brothers”\n\nPeerless performers, the miraculous sight of the Nicholas brothers’ bodies in flight is the first image you see in the book “Regeneration: Black Cinema 1898-1971.” Celebrated and revered by dance and movie luminaries like Gregory Hines, Fayard and Harold began making history from an early age as the children of professional musicians. Their performances were exceptional, sometimes incorporating humor and song as well as dance. But given Jim Crow, their screen presence was often isolated in select scenes, with placement designed with segregation in mind, so that they could be easily excised for exhibit in areas where their mere presence wouldn’t be tolerated by white audiences. This was reportedly not the case, however, with “Down Argentine Way” which contained a standout extended sequence blending comedy (dialogue delivered in flawless spanish) and dance.\n\nMust-watch performance: For its versatility, “Down Argentine Way” (Irving Cummings, 1940) is a particular favorite of Fayard’s granddaughters Cathie and Nicole. New Yorker critic Richard Brody praised them as the best part of that film. The musical interlude in “Stormy Weather,” which Fayard choreographed, contains what is one of the most widely acclaimed tap dance performances in history.\n\nRex Ingram\n\nIngram boasts one of the most unusual backgrounds for an actor and one of the most impactful legacies. Trained in medicine, Ingram graduated from Northwestern University with honors and thought acting would be a minor detour on his path to being a doctor. He was discovered by a film scout and recruited right off the street to play a supporting role in the silent movie “Tarzan of the Apes” in 1918. His role in the biblically themed “Green Pastures” was the star-making turn that made him a favorite. Another of Ingram’s performances was so powerful it reportedly changed the life course of a young Harry Belafonte. According to The New York Times, a 16-year-old Harry was “transfixed” by Rex Ingram’s performance as a Sudanese soldier in “Sahara.” One scene in particular – when “the camera zoomed in on Ingram’s face as he suffocated a Nazi soldier led the boy to enlist in the United States Navy.”\n\nMust-watch performances: “The Green Pastures” (Marc Connelly and William Keighley, 1936), “Cabin in the Sky” (Vincente Minnelli, 1943), and “Sahara” (Zoltan Korda, 1943).\n\nKatherine Dunham\n\nDunham was a visionary choreographer and dance educator who invented her own style of movement, and founded multiple troupes and schools including the Dunham School of Arts and Research, but Dunham also had a prolific and influential career as a dancer and choreographer in the movies, beginning with 1941 film “Carnival of Rhythm.” In the 1930s, as an anthropologist and ethnographer she also conducted research in the Caribbean and then incorporated those traditions from those countries into her choreography. The short films she made on these trips are now part of a special collection in the Library of Congress.\n\nMust-watch performance: “Star Spangled Rhythm” (George Marshall), a 1942 American all-star cast musical film made by Paramount Pictures during World War II as a “morale booster”; “Carnival of Rhythm” (1941); “Stormy Weather” (1943).\n\nEvelyn Preer\n\nPreer died young at the age of 36 in 1932, but achieved critical acclaim and fame in her short life, both on stage as a singer and theatrical actress, and on screen. Her reputation grew as one of independent Black cinema’s leading dramatic actresses, starring in many of Oscar Micheaux’s films from his very first release “The Homesteader” in 1919. “Of her shape-shifting ability to take on wide-ranging roles from villains to heroines, Micheaux reportedly said, “Miss Preer could play any role assigned her.”\n\nMust-watch performance: “Within Our Gates” (1920), which curator Rhea Combs characterizes as a film that is “remarkable” in its entirety. The silent classic is Oscar Michaeux’s filmic response to the racist historical revisionism and slander of “Griffith’s Klan-loving epic “Birth of a Nation.”\n\nTheresa Harris\n\nWhile most of the Black women who played servant roles in the Depression era fit a certain profile — larger and browner women supposedly built for comfort — Theresa Harris had an altogether different profile. Her eye-catching role as a friend and companion to Barbara Stanwyck in “Baby Face” (1933) so struck award-winning dramatist Lynn Notage that it inspired her to write about the actress who imbued a basic role with a subtle kind of fire. The result was her 2011 play “By the Way, Meet Vera Stark.” Similarly struck with Harris’s nuanced performances, Donald Bogle characterized Harris as “A different kind of movie maid.”\n\nMust-watch performance: “Baby Face” (Alfred E. Green, 1933). For a different view of Harris, unencumbered by the Production Code, watch her as a singer in the pre-Code film “Thunderbolt” (Josef von Sternberg, 1929).\n\nLouise Beavers\n\nReflecting a widely held admiration, Doris Berger calls Beavers “a powerhouse of an actress.” One of the consummate Black character actresses of Depression Era Hollywood, Beavers exemplifies the performer who made the most of the material they were given, imbuing narrow parts with dimension. Her best known role is her empathetic turn as housekeeper Delilah in the first screen adaptation of “Imitation of Life” (1934). When we spoke, Bogle singled out that performance for high praise, arguing that Beavers exceeded her scripted role: “It’s in many ways that stereotype, but in other ways, her performance is coming from the heart. And when her daughter rejects her, the pain that she experiences is real.”\n\nMust-watch performances: It’s a tie: “Imitation of Life” (John M. Stahl, 1934) and “Reform School” (1939). Bogle singles out “Imitation of Life” as “the one film of the Depression to suggest that a contemporary race problem existed in America.” Doris Berger and Rhea Combs recommend “Reform School” (Leo C. Popkin, 1939) in which Beavers stars as the head of a prison. Berger notes that two things are striking about this race film: “One, her ideas for reform, to reintegrate youth after they come out of prison into society. And the other thing is in comparison to Hollywood, the roles she was afforded in Hollywood were never a starring role, never in her entire career.”\n\nHattie McDaniel\n\nVanity Fair framed her as both “icon” and “outcast,” but by any measure Hattie McDaniel was truly exceptional. Born in Wichita, Kansas, in 1895 to parents who had both been enslaved in the south, she was part of a talented family of entertainers and the quintessential example of the Black performer rising above their circumstances and the constraints of the roles they were given. As Charlene Regester wrote, McDaniel began singing in a local theater as a teen and later sang with an orchestra, touted as a female version of Vaudevillian Bert Williams. She famously became the first African American to win an Oscar for “Gone With the Wind” (1939), and for a time she was the reigning “Black star of stars,” taking over in that informal honor, ironically, from Stepin Fetchit, according to Donald Bogle. With her commanding presence, she elevated a character known only as “Mammy” as much as she could. Black audiences and the Black press were of two minds about her performance. They praised McDaniel for bringing humanity to the role while decrying the movie’s projection of Blackness. McDaniel is also remembered for wielding influence she had with care and generosity.\n\nMust-watch performances: “Show Boat” (James Whale, 1936); “Gone with the Wind” (1939).\n\nHerb Jeffries (also known as Herb Jeffrey)\n\nThe leading man known as “the Bronze Buckaroo ” and the “Sepia Singing Cowboy,” was a singer in Detroit speakeasies before starring in movie musicals. He became Black independent film’s answer to white cowboy heroes played by Gene Autry and Roy Rogers, and also sang with the Duke Ellington orchestra. While he considered himself a chameleon as an actor, audiences emphasized his ”heartthrob” good looks. Part of his appeal at the time was a certain amount of ambiguity in his identity.\n\nMust-watch performance: His debut: ”Harlem on the Prairie,” (Sam Newfield, 1937) a Black cowboy western co-starring Mantan Moreland and Spencer Williams that was recently restored by the Academy Museum. Calling it an archival “treasure,” curator Doris Berger recommends it for the “amazing acapella singing, in full western ensemble.”"
