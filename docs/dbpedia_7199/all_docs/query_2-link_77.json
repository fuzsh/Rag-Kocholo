        "text": "Jeymes Samuel—aka the musical act The Bullitts—is the writer-director of the new Western The Harder They Fall, and while he may be new to the feature-directing game, he’s been around for a while.\n\nFrom his work on his own music, to producing and collaborating with the likes of Jay-Z—who, incidentally, is a producer on the film—Mos Def, Charlotte Gainsbourg and many others, to his piloting of the Jay-Z: Legacy short film, Samuel’s been quite busy.\n\nHe also has quite a lot to say about movies. Here’s his thoughtful and entertaining examination of five films that inspired The Harder They Fall.\n\n4\n\nMagnolia\n\n1999\n\nIcon_Audio-Video_-PlayCreated with Sketch.\n\nWhere to watch\n\nThere’s nothing I can say about this movie that hasn’t already been said, but what gets overlooked I feel is the musical poetry of the whole movie. This movie for me is literally a poem. From Aimee Mann’s songs to the recurring theme of “Dreams” by Gabrielle. The scene when the whole movie comes to a stop and everyone breaks (or floats) into the song “Wise Up” is genius. Mr. Anderson was firing on all creative cylinders with this movie. Then the frogs … the frogs fall from the sky!! I have had so many conversations about this beautiful choice to the point that when I was making THTF and I was working on the saloon scene with the Blue Lady dancing, rather than explain it, I would say, “In life, you’re either a frog person, or you ain’t.” Bravo, Paul Thomas Anderson. Bravo.\n\n5\n\nShe's Gotta Have it\n\n1986\n\nIcon_Audio-Video_-PlayCreated with Sketch.\n\nWhere to watch\n\nThe word genius gets thrown around a lot, too much even, but this film for me is the celluloid personification of the word. I remember the first time watching She’s Gotta Have It as a child and being glued to the black-and-white beauty of it, then marveling at the scene when it turns to color in the park. My set photographer on The Harder They Fall was David Lee, Spike Lee’s brother, and not a day went past where I didn’t ask him something about this movie. The scene when Jamie Overstreet has to get to Nola Darling’s home is done in a series of photographs to the magical score of Spike’s father, Bill Lee—it’s nothing short of magic. Watching this movie was the closest I got to being in film school. For me, this is Spike’s best movie next to Do the Right Thing."
