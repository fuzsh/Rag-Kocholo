Nearly 500 independently produced race films, exclusively made for black audiences, were produced in the United States between 1915 and 1952, and shown in over 1000 movie theaters across the country; although most of them are now lost due to neglect and poor preservation. The collection restored some of these films to their proper importance as significant and vital additions to the history of the image of black people in the movies, and the development of cinema.

Watch it, and then check out the titles streaming on Netflix under “Pioneers of African-American Cinema.”"
