Sega recently announced its adding four more vehicles to its “Rally Revo” game, and a custom Hummer H3 made the lineup. According to Sega, Hummer is one of the only auto manufacturers to allow customization and changes to their model for use in the game. This couldn’t be much of a surprise since, after all, Hummer has a commercial focusing on customizing in which an H3 shoots off a pier and turns into a submarine (See video below). For the video game, Sega artists “removed the rear doors and dropped the ride height, brought the wheel arch up a touch and tweaked it further to allow more space for wheel clearance… then added Rally-Raid influenced wheels and tires.” We’d like to give all the credit to the Sega design team, but we couldn’t help be reminded of a very similar Hummer H3 we saw at the 2005 SEMA show. We think SOME design credit should go to the folks at Toyo Tires – what about you?
