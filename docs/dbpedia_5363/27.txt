McRae Enduro

The brainchild of rally champion Alister McRae, the McRae Enduro is a new rally car concept that combines outstanding driving dynamics and modern turbo-diesel power with the extra traction that comes with a sophisticated suspension set-up and four-wheel-drive. The rugged McRae Enduro has been designed to compete in the most extreme off-road events including the FIA Cross-Country rallies, Baja-type events and the gruelling Dakar Rally. Having first met with the SEGA Racing Studio early in development of SEGA Rally the relationship was made stronger when SEGA Racing Studioâ€™s Lead Car Artist, Keith Burden, became involved in the design process of the McRae Enduro, offering his skills and advice on the look and shape of the McRae Enduro. The McRae Enduro also makes its video game debut in SEGA Rally.

HUMMER H3 SUV (Customised)

You wont find this beast of a car in any other game because it's been modified, with approval by GM, by Lead Car Artist at the SEGA Racing Studio, Keith Burden. HUMMER is one of the very few manufacturers to allow such extensive customisation for a game and Keith has pulled out the stops to produce a real monster for SEGA Rally. Beginning as a standard HUMMER H3 SUV, Keith removed the rear doors and dropped the ride height, brought the wheel arch up a touch and tweaked it further to allow more space for wheel clearance. Keith then added Rally-Raid influenced wheels and tyres. The H3 is currently the most popular HUMMER model, with its compact design making it especially desirable within the American market.
