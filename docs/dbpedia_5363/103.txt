Hummer was an American automobile brand founded in 1992 by AM General when they started selling the military truck M998 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV, pronounced and called Humvee) to the public. The Humvee was developed for the US Army by AM General and in 1983 AM General was awarded a contract to supply the US Army with the Humvee.

General Motors (GM) bought the brand in 1998 and renamed the Humvee Hummer H1 for civilian use. H2 and H3 were developed as more civilian versions of the H1. The H2 had a new 3 part frame with the front from the 2500 truck range and the the rear from the Tahoe with a new middle. Earlier versions came with a Chevrolet 6.0 liter engine, later versions a Chevrolet 6.2 liter engine. The H2 was built by AM General.

The H3 was based on the Chevrolet Colorado, had a straight 5 cylinder 3.5 liter engine and was assembled by GM in Shreveport, Louisiana.

GM ended the Hummer brand in 2010, then reintroduced the Hummer as an electric SUV and pickup truck in the GMC brand ten years later.
