        "meta_description": "The Hummer was an angular, militaristic, go-anywhere truck that became an emblem of 1990s pop culture. General Motors' Hummer was a coveted status symbol sought by celebrities and a sometimes mocked and vilified example of how far America's newfound love for SUVs had gone. But in 2009, GM got rid of several of its brands, including Pontiac, Saab and Hummer. While the Hummer had a brief lifespan of just under two decades, it made a lasting impression on the auto industry.",
