        "text": "In 2002, General Motors made it official: Jacksonville's Nimnicht Chevrolet was the new home of one of the country's 147 first GM Hummer dealerships.\n\nBy 2003, a super-sized Hummer was America's new status ride, and Nimnicht built a new multi-million dollar dealership to sell them at 11503 Philips Highway by 2005\n\nThis week, GM announced it couldn't cut a deal with China's Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machines to buy Hummer, a month after the corporation shut down Hummer H2 production.\n\nHope still springs eternal that a new suitor will be found, said Nimnicht GMC-Hummer general manager Jackie Lynch. In fact, he said they sold two Hummers this week, as the news of the soured deal came out.\n\n\"It is disappointing. We would have hoped the deal would go through smoothly. We are still optimistic another buyer might step up there. We don't think that it is over,\" Lynch said. \"We have been told by GM that it is business as usual and they might see a few new suitors come in, like Saab.\"\n\nGeneral Motors reached agreement in late 1999 with Hummer's original maker, AM General, to acquiring exclusive ownership of the brand name worldwide. In 2002, Nimnicht began selling the Hummer line from its Chevrolet site at 1550 Cassat Ave., then built the current Hummer-specific steel girder design, complete with off-road course to show off its off-road prowess. The original H1, a civilian version of the military HUMVEE, was eventually replaced by GM-developed (and slightly smaller) H2 and H3 models, based on existing Chevrolet sports utility vehicles. Priced between $30,000 and $45,000, they average between 13- and 18-mpg.\n\nLynch said they have about 10 2010, and nine 2009 Hummers in stock. While sales have slowed in the past year, they usually sold between seven and 10 per month.\n\n\"Had we had consistent production through this whole transaction process, we would have done better, but our inventory was low,\" he said.\n\nLynch said they haven't \"thought that far ahead\" to what happens to the facility if a new Hummer owner isn't found. For now, they will sell and service the SUVs as long as Hummer is in existence, boosted with an expanded high-end used car program and the ability to do authorized warranty work on GM's defunct Saturn line. General Motors killed off Saturn and Pontiac late last year, and just sold off Saab to the Dutch supercar maker, Spyker."
