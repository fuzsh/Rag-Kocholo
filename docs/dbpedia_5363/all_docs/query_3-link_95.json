        "text": "Story at a glance\n\nMany automobile companies have begun debuting electric trucks for the first time.\n\nA General Motors advertisement teases the new Hummer electric pickup truck and SUV.\n\nThe company says that it is working towards an “all-electric” future as customers are increasingly concerned about sustainability.\n\nWhen you think of a Hummer, you might think big and powerful, but you’re probably not thinking environmentally friendly. But General Motors is giving it an electric rebrand, literally.\n\nIn an advertisement narrated by Lebron James, General Motors revealed the GMC Hummer EV earlier this year.\n\nThe all-electric “super truck” will have 1,000 horsepower, 11,500 pound-feet of torque and be able to sprint from 0-60 mph in 3 seconds, according to the company. The vehicle marks the return of the Hummer brand after it was discontinued due to decreasing demand for large SUVs as oil prices peaked.\n\nOur country is in a historic fight. Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n“Our electric trucks will change what people thought they knew about EVs – and everything they know about Hummers. The GMC HUMMER EV is our first entry, but it won’t be alone for long. We will offer not just one pickup, but multiple models with multiple variants, for multiple customers – a vehicle and package for everyone,” General Motors President Mark Reuss said in a release.\n\nThe company is the latest to debut an electric truck, following Fiat Chrysler’s Jeep Gladiator and Ford’s Bronco SUVs. Tesla is launching its own all-electric Cybertruck, but isn’t scheduled to begin production until late 2021.\n\nProduction on the GMC Hummer EV is scheduled to begin in 2021, according to the company, with batteries developed in Warren, Mich., and the truck itself built at the Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant, where the company recently invested $2.2 billion.\n\nMORE FROM CHANGING AMERICA\n\nANTARCTIC GLACIER RETREATED 3 MILES IN 22 YEARS\n\nWE DON’T BELONG ON MARS, WE HAVEN’T LANDED ON EARTH YET\n\nHALF THE WORLD’S SANDY BEACHES COULD BE WASHED AWAY BY CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n10 THINGS WE CAN ALL DO ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nWHY IT’S NOW COOL TO EAT ‘UNPOPULAR FISH’\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.
