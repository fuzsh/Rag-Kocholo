I am reaching you from Turkey, I work in the technical service of an entertainment and arcade hall. My English is not very good, the video card in the (yellow) Lindbergh computer case in the Hammer arcade game in our business has burned, I want to replace it with a new one, but I cannot log in to the windows screen or login. bios. Can anyone help with this?\n\nAttachments\n\nIMG20230808105524.jpg\n\nIMG20230808105542.jpg\n\nIMG20230808105518.jpg\n\nHello,\n\nWhy do you want to go in the Bios?\n\nif you are sure you want to go there and risk breaking the one that works, see HERE for a procedure ... in french!

I just got a non-working Lindy Yellow and it appears that the graphics card is dead. Power pins are fine, but no fan spin and no output. I get an alarm when I remove it so the AGP slot appears fine. I heard that the Lindy uses TPM, but I wasn't sure if that applied to the graphics card.\n\nI saw another 7800 online with a higher bios version, so I guess that's out unless I can downgrade the card bios or somehow turn off TPM?\n\nAlso, I thought these boards came with a GeForce 6 series GPU? Sega Retro and others indicate a 6 series and I visually saw a few Lindy's online with a 6. Is it possible that these are swappable?"
