        "text": "I am trying to get as many Lindbergh games played on my D9202 CGA/EGA/VGA monitor as possible and some are \"HD only\". So I thought perhaps I could down convert those games to VGA resolution with the GBS8200 and take the HD signal down to a 640x480. I have tried with the GBS8200 and can't get it to work or display. Anyone else tried this? There are a few games on the multi-kit that are HD only with no \"low resolution\" alternatives - trying to see if those games can be played on a standard VGA arcade monitor or if you HAVE to go with an HDTV display.\n\nThanks.\n\nYes; HOTD EX, ID5, Hummer Extreme, Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown (Error 51 Wrong Resolution Setting), and OutRun 2 SP SDX all don't work on the D9202 VGA monitor due to resolution issues. Outrun 2 is a big one - Yes; I can't get it to load with the 720x480 resolution which really stinks as I can't play Outrun 2 (Lindbergh) on my D9202. I wouldn't even mind it being squished at this point, but can't get anything to appear and is \"out of range\".\n\nWhich jumpers are you referring to on the Lindbergh for the 640x480 resolution? I was wondering if since it is a \"PC\" - its resolution simply can't be \"set\" to 640x480 and everything is sent out at that resolution just as a Windows PC.\n\nYes; HOTD EX, ID5, Hummer Extreme, Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown (Error 51 Wrong Resolution Setting), and OutRun 2 SP SDX all don't work on the D9202 VGA monitor due to resolution issues.
