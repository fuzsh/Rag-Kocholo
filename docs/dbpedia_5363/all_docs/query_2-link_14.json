With an initial availability of fall 2021, Edition 1 is expected to offer a powerful 11,500 lb.-ft. of torque (GM estimate), best-in-class 1,000 horsepower (GM estimate) and the ability to go 0–60 mph in approximately 3 seconds (GM estimate). These same impressive specifications will also be available on the HUMMER EV3X, which has an initial availability of fall 2022.\n\nWhile reservations are full for the Edition 1, they are being accepted for other trims of GMC’s new supertruck."
