It includes various technologies, such as cameras that allow the driver to see underneath it and four-wheel steering.[19] The SUV variant is rated to tow up to 7,500 pounds (3,400 kg) and seats five passengers with 35.9 cubic feet (1,020 L) of cargo space behind the rear seats and 81.8 cubic feet (2,320 L) with the back seats folded down.\n\nThe pickup truck variant has a longer wheelbase than the SUV.[20] The pickup variant has a 5-foot (1.5 m) high loadbed with a payload capacity of 1,300 pounds (590 kg) as well as a 11.3-cubic-foot (320 L) front trunk.[21] The front trunk on both models is also intended to store the four removable roof panels when needed. It has eighteen cameras installed, as well as front-and-rear pedestrian alerts designed to aid drivers' situational awareness. These accompany numerous other driver-assistance features such as automatic braking and blind-spot warnings.[22][23]\n\nIt weighs 4.5 short tons (4.1 t), with the battery weighing almost 3,000 pounds (1,400 kg).[19] With a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,400 pounds (4,700 kg), it is classified as a class 3 medium-duty truck in the United States.[21]\n\nOrigins\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Hummer\n\nThe GMC Hummer EV originates from the discontinued Hummer brand that was founded by AM General, the manufacturer of the original HUMVEE light military vehicle that was later adapted to civilian spec and sold to the public as the Hummer H1. In 1999, General Motors purchased the rights to the Hummer name and began marketing it as a full-fledged brand with a lineup that eventually included the Hummer H2 and Hummer H3. The Hummer brand was discontinued in 2010 following the General Motors bankruptcy.\n\nTrims\n\n[edit]\n\nEdition 1\n\n[edit]\n\nEdition 1 started production in 2022 as a limited edition and the sole model available for the first year. It was available for pre-order by the end of the launch event on October 20, 2020. All Edition 1 units are white with a black roof and feature bronze-colored wheels. The interior is a two-tone black-and-gray with bronze accents and Edition 1 badges.[24] The Edition 1 will also feature Easter eggs themed after the Apollo 11 moon landing.[25] Edition 1 has three electric motors with 1,000 hp (750 kW; 1,000 PS), 329 miles (529 km) of range,[9] and is fitted with the Extreme Off-Road package, which includes 35-inch (890 mm) mud-terrain tires, skid plates, and rock sliders.[24] The Hummer EV Edition 1 sold out in the first 10 minutes of opening the pre-orders.[26] Initial sales of the Edition 1 were delayed, but were later available in 2022.\n\nThe \"Crab Walk\" feature, which allows the Hummer EV to travel diagonally by using four-wheel steering, comes standard with Edition 1. Edition 1 also includes UltraVision underbody cameras for easier off-road maneuverability and visibility, adaptive air suspension, steel underbody armor, a system called \"Extract Mode\" which lifts the suspension six inches (150 mm) for more clearance, a driver assistance system that allows for automatic lane change and hands-free driving on compatible highways that have been mapped by GM, a digital key, removable roof panels, and GMC's MultiPro Tailgate.[citation needed] In Extract Mode, approach, departure, and breakover angles are 49.7, 38.4, and 32.2 degrees respectively. Ground clearance is 15.9 in (400 mm) and maximum water fording depth is 32 in (810 mm). GMC estimates wall-climbing ability at 18 in (460 mm) and suspension travel at 13 in (330 mm).[27][28]\n\nEV2x\n\n[edit]\n\nIncludes all the features of EV2; however, it will also come standard with four-wheel steering, Crab Walk, adaptive air suspension with adaptive ride control, and optional Extract mode. This trim will output an estimated 625 hp (466 kW; 634 PS) using a dual motor system, will have an estimated range of at least 300 miles (480 km), and is expected to be available in Spring of 2023.[29]\n\nEV2\n\n[edit]\n\nThis is the base Hummer EV trim which will include super cruise, HD surround view, digital key, infinity roof, a multi pro tailgate, and rear drop glass among other standard features. The EV2 will output an estimated 625 hp (466 kW; 634 PS) using a dual motor system, with an estimated range of at least 250 miles (400 km). It is expected to be available by Spring 2024.[29]\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Hummer EV is produced at GM's Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly plant in Michigan. Production of the Hummer EV Truck commenced on November 17, 2021, while the Hummer EV SUV started production on January 30, 2023. In October 2020, GM invested $2.2 billion in the plant for the production of these electric vehicles.[13][30] As of Q3 2022, 783 units had been delivered to customers.[31] As of July 2023, 16,088 units have been produced.[32]\n\nMarketing\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 30, 2020, GM released three advertisements for the Hummer EV, followed by Super Bowl LIV commercials on February 2, 2020, with LeBron James as the spokesperson.[33] In January 2021, GMC announced a multiyear sponsorship deal with Chip Ganassi Racing (CGR) which sees CGR rebranded as GMC Hummer EV Chip Ganassi Racing in the FIA-sanctioned international electric off-road racing series Extreme E. As part of the sponsorship deal, the team's Spark Odyssey 21 body will be styled as the Hummer EV.[34][35]\n\nCriticism and safety concerns\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Autobesity\n\nThe GMC Hummer EV is over twice the weight of an average American car, and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety had to perform checks to ensure their equipment could handle its mass before crash testing it, since it weighs around 3,500 pounds (1,600 kg) more than the heaviest vehicle they had previously tested.[36][37] As an SUV, it is far more likely to kill pedestrians in accidents than a conventional car, which has been noted by critics concerned about the safety of the vehicle.[19][38][39][22] Jennifer Homendy, the head of the United States' National Transportation Safety Board, said that the Hummer EV is an example of a heavy electric vehicle, which is more likely to kill or seriously injure other road users in the event of a collision, alongside products from other manufacturers such as Ford or Volvo.[40][36]\n\nIt can accelerate from a standstill to 60 miles per hour (97 km/h) in around three seconds.[19][39][22] The vehicle's ability to gain speed so quickly has furthered concerns about the danger it may pose to other road users.[39][41][42] In the United States it can be driven by anyone with a normal drivers' license,[23] while in Europe a heavy goods vehicle license may be required to drive it as weighs 1,300 pounds (590 kg) more than the 7,700-pound (3,500 kg) maximum allowed for a regular European driving license obtained after January 1997.[43][44] These factors have contributed to concerns that some owners may not be sufficiently skilled to drive it safely.[21][23] General Motors responded to concerns by saying that their \"customer's safety is a top priority regardless of the type of propulsion or mass of the vehicle\".[39][45]\n\nIt is intended to appeal to customers who otherwise would not have considered buying an electric vehicle, with it expected that most owners will purchase it as a second or third car, likely negating[how?] the environmental benefits of its electric drivetrain.[19] However, some believe the Hummer EV may encourage increased uptake of other, smaller electric vehicles.[45] The \"Edition 1\" variant has a United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) energy-consumption rating of 43 mpg‑e (49 kWh/100 km) on highways, 51 mpg‑e (41 kWh/100 km) in cities, and 47 mpg‑e (45 kWh/100 km) combined and an EPA combined range of 329 miles (529 km).[46][47] Its high mass leads to high levels of particulate emissions from tire and road wear compared with lighter vehicles,[48][49] which can cause various negative health effects.[50][51] Because of this, the Hummer EV has been described as an attempt at \"greenwashing\".[52][53][17]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nChevrolet Silverado EV\n\nCadillac Escalade IQ\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
