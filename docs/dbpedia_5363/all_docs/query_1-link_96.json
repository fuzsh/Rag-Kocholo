        "text": "Following on our March 2023 and August 2023 releases of newly emulated Korean multicarts, here are some more!\n\nThe work has been conducted mostly by Ben Sittler and Bock.\n\nWe have many more things lined up, but it's been tremendously challenging to try to make sense of bootleg multicart releases in term of e.g. naming convention, mapper reverse engineering, emulation.\n\nToday we have 6 new releases, totaling 349 games(**)\n\n(**) Marketing stunt, there are lots of duplicates!\n\nMost of those games are using new mappers/circuit board.\n\nEmulators which have put effort at supporting those include:\n\n- MEKA 2023-08-26 (with an update today)\n\n- Emulicious.\n\n- CEGA.\n\nIf you have an emulator author, please consider supporting multicarts releases! We hope that other emulators will follow suit. None of those release will work on traditional flash-carts, but individual games may be extracted.\n\n(1)\n\n128 Hap (128합) for the Master System / Samsung Gam*Boy.\n\nThis is quite a feat to finally release it, as it is actually the first dump that Ben worked on and very eagerly documented in this topic and this other topic. In a way, the gateway leading Ben to work on more Korean multi-cart :)\n\nThe reason this wasn't released before is we had an issue with naming it...\n\nOur copy of the cartridge is damaged and we don't have a proper label for it! For a while we hoped we would stumble on physical or in-rom data giving this a specific name. I scoured thousands of photos in my archives scrapped from auctions and misc pages, and found evidence of 128-in-1 multicart for SMS but upon further research we could tell it was a different cart with different contents. So eventually we went for what's displayed in the main menu \"128 Hap\".\n\n(2)\n\n11 Hap Gam-Boy (11합 겜보이) for the Master System / Samsung Gam*Boy\n\nhttps://www.smspower.org/Games/11HapGamBoy-SMS\n\nI first discovered this cartridge while traveling in Hokkaido to visit my friend Masato in 2011. It was an intense dumping session where I tried to grab as much data as possible, but for many games we didn't get to fully emulate the mapper until later. This is now done.\n\nBen also spotted an equivalent Megadrive cartridge (running in SMS mode) called \"11 Hap Super Gam-Boy (11합 슈퍼겜보이)\". We weren't able to dump this one yet but based on visible contents it seems very likely that the binary contents is identical.\n\n(3) (4)\n\nSuper Game World 30 Hap (Super Game World 30합) / Super World 30 Hap (Super World 30합) for the Master System / Samsung Gam*Boy .\n\nTwo alternate versions of essentially a same compilation. We found two labels and contents is very slightly different. What appears to be the later version has a label saying \"Super World 30 Hap\" (instead of \"Super Game World 30 Hap\"), which is inconsistent with all other releases in this series. Contents differences analyzed by Ben:\n\nTwo variants exists, with a 8552 bytes difference. \"There are clearly several differences, and at least some of them indicate it's likely two separate iterations. There are some addresses moved in the MSX BIOS replacement+menu region though not many, and also some stray assembler source remains in \"Super Game World 30 Hap\" that was overwritten in \"Super World 30 Hap\". Also, there is a whole different version of the MSX Bomberman game (폭탄인간 / pogtan in'gan, i.e. \"bomb man\") in \"Super World 30 Hap\". From the Bomberman title screen in \"Super Game World 30 Hap\" only button 2 works to start the game, whereas in \"Super World 30 Hap\" only button 1 works to start the game. Given button 1 on the Gam*Boy controller is also marked \"Start\", I suspect \"Super World 30 Hap\" is the later one.\"\n\nWe labelled the dumps respectively \"Super Game World 30 Hap [v0] (KR).sms\" and \"Super Game World 30 Hap [v1] (KR).sms\" to be consistent with our ROM images naming conventions.\n\n(5)\n\nSuper Multi Game - Super 75 in 1 for the Master System / Samsung Gam*Boy.\n\n(This is part of the same \"Super Multi Game\" series for which we released the more ambitious Super Multi Game - Super 125 in 1 back in March, along with a nice scan of the cover that could obtain.)\n\n(6)\n\nSuper Game World75 Hap (Super Game World 75합) for the Master System / Samsung Gam*Boy.\n\nFrom the same unnamed team who brought us Super Game World 30 Hap and Super Game World 260 Hap, this series is recognizable by their creative use of graphics and music in multicart menus.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nWe are happy to be hitting a frontier of niche releases here, making very tangible progress on Korean multicarts. Many of those cartridges have taken decades to be dumped and emulated properly. We will have more soon.\n\nIf you can help us acquire any Korean title, please reach out!.\n\nFollowing on our March 2023 releases of Korean multicarts, here's a new bunch.\n\nThe work has been conducted mostly by Ben Sittler with support from me Bock.\n\nWe have many more things lined up, but it's been tremendously challenging to try to make sense of bootleg multicart releases in term of e.g. naming convention. As Ben has been exploring Game Gear releases (more on that in the future) it has been become clear we still haven't found the right way to label some of them, as they are lots of naming conflicts, or difficult to label releases. We're doing our best and it's pretty exciting to be covering those rarely charted territories of retro-game preservation!\n\nToday we have 8 new releases, totaling 489 games(**)\n\n(**) Marketing stunt, there are lots of duplicates!\n\nMost of those games are using new mappers/circuit board.\n\nEmulators which have put effort at supporting those include:\n\n- MEKA 2023-08-26 (with an update today)\n\n- Emulicious.\n\n- CEGA.\n\nIf you have an emulator author, please consider supporting multicarts releases! We hope that other emulators will follow suit. None of those release will work on traditional flash-carts, but individual games may be extracted.\n\n(1)\n\nLet's start humble but stylish:\n\nOur first release is 2 Hap in 1 (Moai-ui bomul, David-2) / 2合 IN 1 (모아이의 보물, 다비드-2) for the Samsung Gam*Boy / Master System released by Hwasung Computer Co. Ltd, featuring Moai no Hibou and David-II.\n\nAlso see Ben's forum post about dumping this and photos.\n\n(2)\n\nNext up we have Zemina 4-in-1 (Q-Bert, Sports 3, Gulkave, Pooyan) / 큐버트 스포츠３겔케이브 퓨얀 for the Samsung Gam*Boy / Master System. This doesn't actually have an explicit name, the label only provides the 4 game names, but in the vein of trying to make senses of bootleg releases we are prefixing our game page and filenames with \"Zemina 4-in-1\".\n\nAlso see Ben's forum post about dumping this and photos.\n\n(3)\n\nMore Zemina branded multicart!\n\nZemina's Best 88 for the Samsung Gam*Boy / Master System, packed with early SMS titles and MSX1 ported titles.\n\nAbout see Ben's github post about dumping this and photos.\n\n(4) (5)\n\nIf you split the \"Best 88\" ROM dump in two in turns out that each half can act as an independent multicart! They were programmed to do so, so the code in the first-half scans for available contents and display a different menu depending on the presence of the second half of that.\n\nFirst half is Zemina's Best 39 for the Samsung Gam*Boy / Master System.\n\nand second half is Zemina's Best 25 for the Samsung Gam*Boy / Master System.\n\nHere's the thing..\n\nWe have evidence that Best 25 exists as a standalone cartridge:\n\nBut we haven't found an original yet. We however don't yet have evidence that Best 39 exists as a standalone cartridge. Time will tell, but we are mentioning that clearly on the game page: for has it has been extracted as the standalone first-half of Best 88.\n\n(6)\n\nWe have A Korean release of Tank Battalion for the Samsung Gam*Boy / Master System. Note that while the Korean adaptation was adapted for the Master System (which has the extra RAM the SG-1000 doesn't have), the Taiwanese adaptation which we released for the SG-1000 a while ago relies on the Taiwan-only DahJee RAM expansion adapter as Taiwanese market was running on SG-1000 II back then vs Korean market was always on Master System only.\n\n(7) (8)\n\nWe're not done!\n\nWe have Super Game 150 (슈퍼게임150) and Super Game 180 (슈퍼게임180) for the Samsung Gam*Boy / Sega Master System.\n\nUnusually note that Super Game 150 is 2 whooping megabytes while Super Game 180 is \"only\" 1 megabyte: the earlier actually carries more unique games.\n\nSee forum threads about dumping Super Game 150 and more details..\n\nUnlike several others multi-game cartridges, other We don't yet have menu indexes for Super Game 150 and Super Game 180. Your help would be appreciated there!\n\nReminder that you can find a handy list of our releases at https://www.smspower.org/Dumps/Releases.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nHappy 26th Anniversary!\n\nThe tradition goes, and entries to our 2023 Coding, Music and Hacks competitions have have been posted now! You can grab and play them now. Voting starts soon!\n\nAnd now on to our traditional releases of new dumps!\n\nExactly one year ago we released the first emulated Korean xx-in-1 multicart. I have been chasing them for decades and sitting on a pile of undumped and unemulated ones, as other projects took priority. With Ben Sittler independently pushing in this direction, we made enormous progress and both of us went into a dumping frenzy which continued into this year. Ben in particular did a majority of the work reverse engineering the new mappers, figuring out how to dump his cartridges and adding emulation code to Meka. I followed on his footsteps, dumped many of mine (we still both have a few unsolved ones), occasionally helping and reviewing mapper code.\n\nToday we have 5 new multicart releases, totaling 429 games(*) We have several more we'll release over time as we are still going through what we have and figuring out naming conventions. Those unlicensed multicarts are particularly tricky to label as there are frequent inconsistencies between packaging, cartridge and in-game menu. That's not even accounting for multiple releases (patches, SMS/MD/GG sharing a compatibility layer), multi-cart code altering menu layout based on data, multicart containing other multicarts, multicarts with physical switches etc. As we will naturally drift toward Game Gear multi-carts we may have LOTS to release and will need to come up with tricky naming schemes as many different cartridges may be sharing a similar or same name.\n\n(*) IF you were to trust their advertised count, which you cannot :)\n\nMost of those games are using new mappers/circuit board. As of today, they are emulated by MEKA 2023-03-27 (today's release) and Emulicious, and we hope that other emulators will follow suit. None of those release will work on traditional flash-carts, but individual games may be extracted.\n\n(1)\n\nOur first release is Pigu-Wang 7 Hap - Jaemiiss-neun Game Mo-eumjip (피구왕7합 - 재미있는 게임 모음집) for the Sega Master System / Samsung Gam*Boy. Exhibiting an almost timid \"7 in 1\", this is nonetheless one of the most interesting Korean compilation: it contains 2 Megabytes (16 Megabits) worth of original Master System games developed in Korea. Most of the polished SMS-era titles are in this compilation: Dallyeora Pigu-Wang (dodgeball), 94 Super World Cup Soccer, Agigongnyong Dooly and more... Among the seven titles is one we haven't seen before: Bugtris, a 1 and 2 players Tetris clone where cleared lines turns into bugs that you have to squash. We also added a nice quality scan of the game box in the Scans section.\n\nNote we also extracted the exact same dump from a Megadrive copy of the compilation, where the cartridge is set to run in SMS mode. Both versions are identical.\n\n(2)\n\nAscending to our next step, Super Game 45 (슈퍼게임４５) for the Sega Master System / Samsung Gam*Boy. With a joyful menu sporting My Hero's sporting, this compilation contains a few dozen Sega Mark III card games and MSX1 games modified for the SMS. Note quite 45 but still a nice amount. We have an index and translation of the menu in the link above (thanks to Ben Sittler for those).\n\n(3)\n\nComing after is Super Game 52 Hap (슈퍼게임５２합) for the Sega Master System / Samsung Gam*Boy. As you may notice from the similar title screen, this immediate successor of Super Game 45 and was developed and published by the same people. While we have still uncovered new brands of pirate multicarts, there are some recurring \"big brand\" and this is one of them. We don't have a menu index for this one yet (if someone can make it in the same format!) but this is double the size of the Super Game 45 and contains more unique games.\n\n(4)\n\nOur next multicart is Super Multi Game - Super 125 in 1 for the Sega Master System / Samsung Gam*Boy. This is also a 2 Megabytes (16 Megabits) cartridge and contains a handful of modded MSX releases. It is notable because many of the MSX games have Korean logos.\n\n(5)\n\nOur fifth multicart is Game Chongjiphap 200 (게임 총집합 200) for the Sega Master System / Samsung Gam*Boy. By game count it is our largest multicart release so far, but it is only a 1 Megabyte (8 megabits) cartridge and contains less unique games than e.g. Super 125 in 1 above. The MSX games we could check in this compilation appears to have less modifications: copyright scrubbing but no translated titles.\n\n(6)\n\nLastly, we have an alternate dump for last year's Game Mo-eumjip 188 Hap (게임모음집188합) . I personally dumped two copies of this cartridge and got the same version (released last year) but Ben's copy was very slightly different. He posted it to a development thread recently but for the sake of visibility we are mentioning it here too. Read details about this variation:\n\nThe byte differences are in a region occupied by MSX BIOS replacement and menu code+data, I believe. The different bytes are at ROM offsets 0x11c1, 0x11c7, 0x11cd, and 0x11d3.\n\nThe differences are in the \"trainer\" (RAM patching) data for four of the King's Valley game variants in menu entries 101, 102, 103, and 104.\n\nFor menu entry 101, at address 0xFFE0 it replaces 0x55 with 0x03 (Bock's copy) or 0x04 (my copy)\n\nFor menu entry 102, at address 0xFFE0 it replaces 0x55 with 0x06 (Bock's copy) or 0x08 (my copy)\n\nFor menu entry 103, at address 0xFFE0 it replaces 0x55 with 0x0A (Bock's copy) or 0x0B (my copy)\n\nFor menu entry 104, at address 0xFFE0 it replaces 0x55 with 0x0B (Bock's copy) or 0x0E (my copy)\n\nSo for some reason, the maker of this multicart eventually replaced the starting level in one of their game trainer between two batches of manufacturing this multicart.\n\nHope you enjoy this foray into the little uncharted lands of multicarts... We hope to share more soon. Thanks for Ben Sittler for his invaluable help getting this to happen and still ongoing.\n\nHelp wanted!\n\n- Site contributors: full index and details for those games would be good to add to the wiki.\n\n- Emulator authors: support for those multicarts in more emulators would be nice. You can refer to MEKA sources on github for mappers details (or feel free to ask there).\n\nHappy new year 2023!\n\nFollowing last month's release of three prototypes, and a Phantasy Star 35th Anniversary Retranslation Update, we've got another pile of goodies :)\n\nA Prototype of the great Scramble Spirits for the Master System. A rare and charming two-players vertical shooter developed in Japan. The sample cartridge was sourced from the UK but as per its EPROM it seems like it was displayed at CES.\n\nIt curiously bears a 1989 copyright (vs final game saying 1988). Looking at simple data statistics does contains noticeably less meaningful data than the final release however so it appears to be a definitively earlier build: one can assume they intently bumped the release date to 1989 expecting the game to release that year?\n\nSee attachment for a photo of the cartridge.\n\nA Prototype of Fushigi no Oshiro Pit Pot (不思議のお城 ピットポット) for the Master System.\n\nBased on analysis by super-reverse-engineer Calindro, the changes in this build relates to how the game EDIT mode converts edited level to in-game mode. In the prototype some treasure chests seems to disappear when starting a level. This prototype was dumped from a Japanese collection a few years ago.\n\nSuper Penguin (슈퍼팽귄, 수퍼펭귄) for the Samsung Gam*Boy / Master System, a rare Korean original developed by SIECO. This is a basic MSX1/SG-1000 era platformer. Although undated, it seems to draw inspiration from the level art of Super Mario Bros 3 so was probably developed after.\n\nBox art and in-game title are inconsistent in spelling, and the product number SI-3131G appears to be the same as Gangcheol RoboCop (강철 로보캅), also by Sieco. A equally obscure MSX version also exist.\n\nThen we have Con-Dori (콘돌이) for the Samsung Gam*Boy / Master System, and MSX Soccer / Chuggu (축구) for the Samsung Gam*Boy / Master System, both unlicensed MSX1 ports. Con-Dori has unusually terrible audio.\n\nCon-Dori was provided and dumped by bsittler who has lately been of tremendous help and instrumental with on-going work dumping and reverse engineer Korean XX-in-1 cartridges (leading to our release of Game Mo-eumjip 188 Hap (게임모음집188합) and many upcoming ones.\n\nMSX Soccer has a Hwaseong / Hwasung Bumper Screen injected into the MSX BIOS replacement.\n\nWe are not done!\n\nWe have the rare Taiwanese version of The Circuit / Fēichē zhēngbà zhàn (飛車爭霸戰) for the Taiwanese Mark III., for which the cartridge was kindly provided to us by Eric Kuo. Thank you!\n\nTo finish, we have 4 \"SMS game in a Game Gear cartridge\" releases by Hung Tao Hsin (HTH), to complement the 24 releases we made in 2021:\n\nHG 101-13: The Ninja / Dàshén rěnzhě (大神忍者)\n\nHG 101-15: Choplifter / Ā pà qì (阿帕契).\n\nHG 101-26: Aztec Adventure / Nazca'88, with erroneous box labels: Aztel Adventure (Nazca'88) / Ganbare Goemon (がんばれゴエモン).\n\nHG 201-12: E-SWAT / Pīlì zhàn jǐng (霹靂戰警), dumped from the variant with E-SWAT art label.\n\nIn the tradition of other HTH releases: original Sega copyrights have been scrubbed and/or replaced with HTH ones, and games were modified to increase amount of lives/bullets.\n\nAttached to this post are photos of original cartridges.\n\nEnjoy!"
