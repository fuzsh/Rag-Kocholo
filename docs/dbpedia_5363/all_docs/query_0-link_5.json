        "text": "Not to be confused with Hummer Team.\n\nHummer Software (蜂鸟软件, also translated as \"Hummingbird Software\", not to be confused with the Japanese game company Hummingbird Soft) was a company based in Xi'an, China, who produced games primarily for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and \"EMG\" hardware-based plug & plays.\n\nThe Hummer Software company was the successor to Dragon Co., which in itself was formed by ex-Hengmao Electronics employees. Hummer Software mainly focused on developing \"[software] around the EMG802, EMG1000, EMG1020 series of game platforms\"; the \"EMG\" devices seem to be a proprietary form of hardware used in plug & plays. The company previously hosted several \"demo\" ROMs for download on their website, including a Sonic the Hedgehog game demo; however, all of these files are no longer archived.\n\nA handful of Hummer Software productions are known to have been released, such as the Sega Mega Drive game Death Caliber. The software for two plug & plays - the Sunnyflyer 30 in 1 and the Lexibook Color Console (20-in-1) - were also produced by Hummer Software.\n\n[]\n\nOfficial website (archived)\n\n\"Jempire\" Microsoft Word document showing all \"EMG\" games (note: clicking link will download document)"
