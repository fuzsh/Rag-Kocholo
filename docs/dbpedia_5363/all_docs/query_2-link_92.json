        "text": "GMC, a division of General Motors Co. in Detroit, and A+E Networks, have announced the television premiere of âRevolution: GMC HUMMER EV,â a new documentary showcasing the development of the all-electric truck.\n\nThe 2022 GMC HUMMER EV Pickup is the first all-electric vehicle in GMCâs portfolio and features new architecture that delivers off-road capability and on-road performance. Throughout the documentary, viewers will see how the team developed industry-leading innovations, including the available CrabWalk and the Watts to Freedom launch control mode.\n\nFirst airing in the Drive block on The History Channel on Sunday, March 27, at 11 a.m., the 60-minute film follows GM team members who helped launch the companyâs first all-electric pickup, which took two years.\n\nThe automaker provided the documentaryâs crew with open access to the testing of the vehicle, and viewers will go behind the scenes of key moments in the development of the GMC HUMMER EV, from inception to start of production.\n\nâOur goal was to upend what an electric vehicle is capable of and push the boundaries from 100 years of vehicle development experience,â says Josh Tavel, executive chief engineer at GMC. âThis documentary captures the soul of a team capable of incredible innovation and resilience. Their learnings are laying the foundation of vehicle development for decades to come.â\n\nGMC selected Detroit-based WTP Pictures and Hiatus to produce the film, and director Sean King OâGrady to bring the teamâs journey to life.\n\nScenes include GM personnel in the freezing temperatures of Michiganâs Upper Peninsula as they test the limits of the GMC HUMMER EV on snow and ice. From there, they head to the scorching heat and steep red rocks of Moab, Utah, as the team fine-tunes the truckâs off-road capability.\n\nAlong the way, the film dives into GMâs testing facilities â previously unseen by the public â including the halls of the GM Design building at the Global Technical Center in Warren, and the companyâs proving grounds in Milford and Yuma, Ariz.\n\nIn addition, viewers will go inside the undertaking to build out and retool GMâs Factory ZERO Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant. The documentary also showcases the development of GMâs Ultium Platform, a dedicated EV architecture and propulsion system that provides flexible applications in nearly every type of vehicle.\n\nâThe story we discovered while filming was far more fascinating than anything we could have hoped for,â says OâGrady. âWe witnessed a bold and passionate team bring GMâs first major entry into this extraordinary transformation of the auto industry. This was an incredible opportunity to go deep behind the scenes of the development process to discover what it takes to bring a vehicle to life, and to capture this moment in automotive history as it happened.â\n\nFollowing the premiere on The History Channel, there will be an encore showing of the film on FYI on Thursday, March 31, at 9 p.m. ET. The documentary will also be available for streaming via History on Hulu and History.com on Sunday, March 27 as well as on GMCâs YouTube channel starting Sunday, April 3.\n\nProduction of the 2022 GMC HUMMER EV Pickup began in late 2021 at GMâs Factory ZERO Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center â a 40-year-old facility revamped with a $2.2 billion investment to support GMâs all-electric future.\n\nThe first customer deliveries began in December of last year and will continue throughout this year. GMCâs electric lineup will expand with the 2024 GMC HUMMER EV SUV, which will go into production at Factory ZERO in early 2023, and the all-electric Sierra Denali.\n\nReservations for available models are currently accepted atÂ GMC.com/HummerEV."
