        "text": "Usually, you’d think owning a Hummer H1 would be more than enough to stand out from the crowd, but that just wasn’t the case for rapper and record producer Master P. Back in 1994, took a regular H1 and turned it into something even more eye-catching: the H1 “Bubble Eye.” I’ve got some good news for you, it’s for sale. You can own this thing.\n\nThe truck was posted for sale in the Hummer H1 Network Facebook group, and even the ad doesn’t shy away from how ungainly this slant-nosed Hummer looks. Along with its unique front end, the Bubble Eye comes with ancient 39-inch Bogger tires that you’ll need to replace, No Limit Records decals (that’s Master P’s label), a 6.5-liter diesel engine (no word if it has a turbo or not) and a goddamn Sega Dreamcast. That’s right. This truck comes with a Sega Dreamcast built-in. It could not be a more ’90s product if it tried.\n\nThis is the perfect car for the type of guy who looks at a Tesla Cybertruck and thinks to himself, “This will not get me enough negative attention.” The whole thing can be yours for $40,000, according to the seller, Adam Wall Ace on Facebook.\n\nFor the most part, the truck seems to be in pretty good condition inside and out. I mean it doesn’t look perfect or anything – H1s were never particularly well built and this thing is 30 years old at this point, but all things considered, it’s not too bad. The only major fault the seller lists (other than the rotten tires) is that the stereo is broken. He writes, “Some enterprising thief stole the amplifiers ages ago, so the stereo is currently a silent partner.” Not great.\n\nIf the whole “Bubble Eye” thing isn’t for you, the seller says a “front clip swap” is all you’d need to do to get it back to stock. I may not like the way this truck looks, but it would be sacrilege to do that in my opinion."
