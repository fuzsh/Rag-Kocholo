All can be …\n\nNow’s your chance to bid on this legendary hot hatch driven by the famous \"Top Gear\" and \"The Grand Tour\" host\n\nIt just needs a bit of polish and elbow grease. And a few body panels.\n\nThis championship-winning C2 Corvette looks like it would be a lot of fun\n\nRemoving it required demolishing several walls, and now it's being offered for sale\n\nThe truck was custom made for rapper Master P back in 1994, and its design hasn't aged well"
