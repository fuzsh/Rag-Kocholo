        "text": "Wikimedia\n\nHummer was an American off-road brand of GM (General Motors). The Hummer off-roader of the same name was built between 1992 and 2010 in three generations (H1, H2, and H3) - each also in a pickup version.\n\nOriginally, the Hummer was developed and produced by the AM General Corporation (manufacturer of commercial, military, and passenger vehicles). The Hummer brand also initially consisted of just one model. Only in 2003 did the vehicle receive the model designation H1.\n\nThe Hummer's immediate ancestor is the M998 HMMWV (Humvee) military vehicle, designed and built specifically for the US Army by AM General. Back in the late '80s, AM General planned to launch a civilian version of the Humvee, which actually went on sale in 1992 under the Hummer name.\n\nIn 1999, the trademark rights were then sold to General Motors (GM). Production continued, however, GM took over sales. GM later released two Hummer models of its own - the H2 and H3.\n\nHummer H1 Pickup (1992 - 2006)\n\nWikimedia\n\nThe Hummer H1 (civilian version of the HMMWV) first appeared actually in 1992 and was offered in five body styles:\n\nas a convertible-like four-door with an open loading area and tarpaulin top (4-door open top)\n\nas a closed five-door (4-door wagon)\n\nas a \"Slantback\" model\n\nas pickup version (2-door / 4-door)\n\nas a hardtop version with a fixed roof\n\nTechnically, the Hummer H1 largely corresponded to the military Humvee. However, it offered more extensive equipment with a 12-volt electrical system, a comfortable interior, air conditioning, a CD player, and electric window regulators (optional).\n\nThe H1 pickup had tremendous off-road capabilities. With a ground clearance of 1.3 ft, departure angles of 72 degrees at the front and 37.5 degrees at the rear were no problem. Likewise, its large track width (1818 mm) gave it a high degree of stability.\n\nThe Hummer Pickup even coped with waters up to 76 cm deep and 56 cm high steps without any problems. In addition, the vehicle had differentials on both axles that could be locked by braking.\n\nIn 2003, the manufacturer equipped it with electric Eaton differential locks at the rear, and a year later also at the front. A portal gearbox with a gear reduction directly on the wheels and a tire pressure control system finally supplemented the equipment of most H1 models.\n\nEngines\n\nWikimedia\n\nThe Hummer pickup was powered by a total of four diesel engines and one gasoline engine. A five-speed automatic version was used from the model year 2006 - but only in the H1 Alpha.\n\n1992-1993 - 6.2L GM-6200 V8 Naturally Aspirated 110kW/150 hp\n\nfrom 1994 - 6.5 l GM-6500 V8 naturally aspirated diesel with 125 kW/170 hp\n\n1995-1996 - 7L Chevy Small Block V8 Gasoline 147kW/200 hp\n\n1996-2004 - 6.5L GM-6500 V8 Turbocharged Diesel 147kW/200 hp\n\nsince 2005 - 6.6 l Duramax 6600 V8 turbo diesel with 221 kW/300 hp (H1 Alpha)\n\nAM General eventually ceased production of the Hummer H1 pickup in June 2006.\n\nHummer H2 SUT Pickup (2005 - 2010)\n\nWikimedia\n\nThe Hummer H2 is an SUV (Sport Utility Vehicle) and a SUT (Sport Utility Truck) from the US car brand Hummer and was built from 2003 to 2010. With the H2, GM wanted to offer a slightly smaller version of the H1 and at the same time expand Hummer as its own brand.\n\nThe Hummer H2 was built at AM General for a total of seven years before GM discontinued the Hummer brand in 2010. Like the previous H1, the Hummer H2 also had excellent off-road mobility, but did not quite come close to the H1.\n\nAlso technically the H2, in contrast to the H1, was not based on the original military version M998 HMMWV (Humvee) from AM General, but on a platform specially developed for this purpose. Their technical components were also used in the Cadillac Escalade and in GMC vehicles.\n\nExternally, however, the smaller H2 stuck to the angular shape of the Hummer H1, although the term \"small\" is relative in the Hummer world. Because with a length of almost five meters and a width of more than two meters, the three-ton lobster was anything but small.\n\nWhile the original version of the H2 was a five-door SUV with an enclosed cab and trunk, GM released a Hummer H2 pickup truck version, the H2 SUT, in 2005. This had a four-door passenger cabin with a short loading area (up to 1.80 x 1.20 meters).\n\nIn 2007 (2008 model), the Hummer H2 pickup received a facelift. First and foremost, this brought with it an improved interior, including the third row of seats in the SUV variant. In addition, various modifications to the engine and minimal changes to the radiator grille were made. However, nothing changed in the terrain characteristics.\n\nThe off-roader already had the following as standard:\n\nOn-Board Computer\n\nDual Airbags in Front\n\nThree-Zone Automatic Climate Control\n\nBOSE Premium Sound System, 6-Disc CD Changer\n\nAutomatic Transmission\n\nMultifunction Steering Wheel with Radio Control Buttons\n\nCruise Control\n\nCentral Locking System\n\nElectric Windows\n\nEight-Way Electrically Adjustable Leather Seats\n\nHeated Seats Front and Rear\n\nOversized Tires with HUMMER Rims\n\nUniversal Garage Door Opener and Remote Engine Start from Model 2008\n\nAlso optionally available were:\n\nAdjustable Rear Suspension\n\nSunroof\n\nBackup Camera\n\nDVD Entertainment System\n\nNavigation System\n\nCustom Grid\n\nSpecial 20-inch Chrome HUMMER Rims\n\nEngines\n\nWikimedia\n\nFrom 2003 to 2004, the Hummer H2 was powered by a GM truck engine. It had a displacement of six liters, eight cylinders, and an output of 236 kW/321 hp, combined with a four-speed automatic transmission, traction control, and a differential lock on the rear axle.\n\nFrom 2005-2007 this had increased to an output of 242 kW/330 hp and from 2008 the Hummer H2 received a 6.2-liter V8 engine with 293 kW/398 hp and a 6-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe Hummer H2 SUT (Pickup Truck) was never offered in Europe and its base price in the US was around $70,000 brand new.\n\nHummer H3T Pickup Truck (2009 - 2010)\n\nWikimedia\n\nWhile the SUV version of the Hummer H3 had been on the market since 2005, GM (General Motors) only pushed the pickup truck version - the Hummer H3T - four years later. The Hummer H3T was a pickup truck based on the platform of the Hummer H3 and the Chevrolet Colorado.\n\nWith a loading area of ​​1.50 meters in length (1010 liters), it mutated into a small truck and, with an overall length of 5.34 meters, was 60 cm longer than the SUV variant of the H3. GM wanted to conquer a new niche by placing the H3T between mid-size and full-size trucks and thus creating a combination of practical trucks and crisp off-roaders.\n\nIn the front view, it hardly differed from its smaller brother. Equipped with a large grille and greedy round front lights - according to the motto: move over there, here comes a Hummer!\n\nIts cabin (crew cab) offered space for five people and its rear row of seats could be folded in a ratio of 60:40, which provided additional storage space. Also, the Hummer pickup was a ruthless tractor. It could easily transport goods weighing over 2.5 tons. Here, some vehicles of the competition could only look envious.\n\nDespite its longer chassis, the Hummer H3T handled rough terrain almost as well as the shorter H3 SUV. You could also order the pickup with an optional adventure package. This included large 33-inch wheels, special shock absorbers, locking differentials, and a shortened gear ratio.\n\nThus, the Hummer H3T had a ground clearance of 285 mm and managed a gradient of 60 percent. To ensure that no sensitive components are damaged during a wild ride off-road, the H3T also had various underride protection plates. Nevertheless, the Hummer H3T pickup truck was also suitable for everyday use, which was also reflected in its equipment.\n\nEngines\n\nWikimedia\n\nA 3.7-liter V8 gasoline engine with a five-cylinder in-line cylinder and an output of 245 hp served as the drive unit, which enabled it to reach a top speed of a sufficient 96 mph. In a stronger version, the Hummer pickup was equipped with the 5.3-liter small-block V8. This had an output of 305 hp and was ideal for off-road use, particularly due to its enormous torque (434 Nm at 4,000 rpm).\n\nAt the end of February 2010, General Motors finally announced the end of the Hummer brand. The last Hummer H3T pickup rolled off the assembly line on May 24, 2010.\n\nProtecting Your Hummer Pickup\n\nNot much can hurt Hummer trucks since they are extremely durable and robust.
