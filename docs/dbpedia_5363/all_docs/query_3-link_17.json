Only 729 units were made! It is a very desirable collector's item.\n\nThe images that you see here are from the last HUMMER H1 Alpha ever made! Yes, you read it right, this was the last one to come out of the production line, certified by AM General; never titled!\n\nThis iconic piece of Hummer history came to us with all the proper documentation of a new vehicle and a Hood made specially for the occasion, painted to match the vehicle superb color, Mystic Green, and signed by everyone that work in the H1 Project!\n\nIn December of 1999 AM General sold the Hummer name and the rights to market and distribute Hummer vehicles to General Motors. AM General continued to Build the original Hummer (now called H1) at the Mishawaka plant. In mid 2002 AM General began building the all new Hummer H2 as a 2003 model in a new state of the art manufacturing facility adjacent to the HMMWV/H1 plant.\n\nIn mid 2005 Hummer introduced the 2006 Hummer H3. The H3 was a midsized SUV based on the Colorado/Canyon truck platform and built at GM's Shreveport, LA plant.\n\nThe final decision to end civilian H1 Production was made on Tuesday May 9th 2006, the decision was officially announced to the public Friday May 12th 2006. There were 729 '06 H1s built bringing the total number of H1s produced since their introduction in 1992 to 11,818.\n\nJune 3rd 2008 GM announces that it is considering selling or closing down the Hummer brand.\n\nGM files for Bankruptcy on June 1st 2009, announces Chinese company Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company will purchase the Hummer brand the day after.\n\nOn February 25th 2010 GM announces the deal with Sichuan Tengzhong for the sale of the Hummer brand has fallen through. GM says they will evaluate any further offers over the next several weeks and if no suitable offers are received, they will begin the \"orderly wind-down\" of the Hummer brand.\n\nApril 7, 2010 notification is sent to Hummer dealers that no \"viable\" buyers have been found and the \"orderly wind-down\" of the Hummer brand will begin.\n\nThe \"wind-down\" is completed and GM officially shuts down the Hummer brand on October 31st 2010."
