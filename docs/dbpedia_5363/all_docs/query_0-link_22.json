        "text": "SEGA REVEALS SUPER CAR QUARTET\n\nFOR SEGA RALLY REVO\n\nMitsubishi Concept-X, HUMMER® H3™ SUV (Customized),\n\nMcRae Enduro, and RUF Rt 12 Unveiled for Genre-Defining Rally Game\n\nSAN FRANCISCO AND LONDON (September 10, 2007) – SEGA of America, Inc. and SEGA Europe Ltd. today confirmed that SEGA Rally Revo™ will include, among others, the Mitsubishi Concept-X, the recently revealed McRae Enduro, the RUF Rt 12 and a uniquely customized HUMMER® H3™. SEGA Rally Revo will be released on the PLAYSTATION®3 computer entertainment system, the Xbox 360® video game and entertainment system from Microsoft, the PSP® (PlayStation®Portable) system and the PC on October 9, 2007.\n\nMitsubishi Concept-X\n\nWith a front end inspired by a jet fighter, this is the concept vehicle for the next-generation of the Lancer Evolution Series, and makes its video game debut in SEGA Rally Revo. The production version of the Concept-X will have a 2.0 liter turbo-charged engine, a twin-clutch transmission, an advanced all-wheel-drive system and lightweight all-aluminum bodywork. The words Lancer Evolution have become synonymous with the sport of rallying since the car first launched in 1992 and the Concept-X has paved the way for the release of the forthcoming Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X in early 2008.\n\nMcRae Enduro\n\nThe brainchild of rally champion Alister McRae, the McRae Enduro is a new rally car concept that combines outstanding driving dynamics and modern turbo-diesel power with a sophisticated suspension set-up and four-wheel-drive. The rugged McRae Enduro has been designed to compete in the most extreme off-road events including the FIA Cross-Country rallies, Baja-type events and the grueling Dakar Rally. Having first met with the SEGA Racing Studio early in development of SEGA Rally Revo, the relationship was made stronger when SEGA Racing Studio’s Lead Car Artist, Keith Burden, became involved in the design process of the McRae Enduro, offering his skills and advice on the look and shape of the McRae Enduro. The McRae Enduro also makes its video game debut in SEGA Rally Revo.\n\nRUF Rt 12\n\nRUF Automobile GmbH is the producer of high-performance vehicles, specializing in the manufacturing and enhancement of existing sports cars to RUF performance specifications. The RUF Rt 12, available for purchase with either a four or rear-wheel drive train, has advanced aerodynamics and handling characteristics. It is one of the fastest and most desirable SEGA Rally Revo cars, boasting a top speed of over 200mph.\n\nHUMMER H3 SUV (Customized)*\n\nYou wont find this beast of a car in any other game because it’s been modified, with approval by GM, by Lead Car Artist at the SEGA Racing Studio, Keith Burden. HUMMER is one of the very few manufacturers to allow such extensive customization for a game and Keith has pulled out the stops to produce a real monster for SEGA Rally Revo. Beginning as a standard HUMMER H3 SUV, Keith removed the rear doors and dropped the ride height, brought the wheel arch up a touch and tweaked it further to allow more space for wheel clearance. Keith then added Rally-Raid influenced wheels and tires. The H3 is currently the most popular HUMMER model, with its compact design making it especially desirable within the American market.\n\nDeveloped by SEGA Racing Studio on the PLAYSTATION 3 system, Xbox 360 and PC and the by Bugbear Entertainment Limited on the PSP system, SEGA Rally Revo is rated “E” for ‘Everyone’ by the Entertainment Software Review Board. SEGA Rally Revo will be available in stores on October 9, 2007.
