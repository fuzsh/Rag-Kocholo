        "text": "This article is about the Hummer brand. For the Hummer H1, see Hummer H1. For the military's Hummer, see Humvee. For other uses, see Hummer (disambiguation).\n\nHummer was a brand of trucks and SUVs marketed since 1992 by AM General when it began selling a civilian version of the M998 Humvee.\n\nIn 1998 General Motors purchased the brand name and marketed three vehicles: the original Hummer H1, based on the Humvee, and the Hummer H2 and the Hummer H3 models that were based on other, smaller civilian-market GM platforms.\n\nThe business viability of the Hummer brand was under review by GM management since 2008. The brand was not transferred to Motors Liquidation Company as part of the GM bankruptcy in 2009; instead, it was retained by GM in order to investigate selling the brand.\n\nChinese automaker Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company announced in 2009 that it would acquire the Hummer brand, pending government approvals. However, the Chinese industrial equipment maker withdrew its bid after failing to win approval from Chinese regulators.[1] According to Reuters, the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China rejected the deal on February 24, 2010,[2] but a spokesperson for ministry denies that it rejected the application that has been stalled for eight months.[3]\n\nAt the end of February 2010, General Motors announced it would begin dismantling the Hummer brand.[4] Two days later, the automaker announced it had been approached with new offers for the brand after the deal with Sichuan Tengzhong could not be completed.[5]\n\nBy April 2010, any sale of the brand became unlikely as inventory was depleted and Hummer dealerships began shutting down.[6] After filling a rental car fleet order, the last Hummer H3 rolled off line at Shreveport on May 24, 2010.[7]\n\nHistory[]\n\nOrigin[]\n\nThe original Hummers were first designed and built by AM General Corporation, which was formerly AMC-Jeep's General Products division,[8] in its Mishawaka, Indiana, assembly plant. The vehicles were created under a contract for the United States Armed Forces. The first model, the Hum-Vee, was built in a variety of military-based equipment and versions. The US$1.2 billion contract won by AM General in 1983 was to produce 55,000 Humvees by 1985, which was later increased to 15,000 additional units.[9]\n\nAM General had planned to sell a civilian version of the Hum-Vee as far back as the late 1980s. Having the same structure and most mechanical components, the civilian Hummers were finished in automotive gloss paint, adding passenger car enhancements such as air conditioning, sound insulation, upgraded upholstery, stereo systems, wood trim, and convenience packages.[10] The civilian model began in part because of the persistence of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who saw an Army convoy while filming a movie.[11]\n\nIn 1990, two matching white Hum-Vees were driven from London to Beijing over the rough roads of central Soviet Union. The Hummers made the trip with ease, for they were built to drive on off-road terrain. The highlights of this journey were broadcast in the United States on ESPN. This publicity would pale in comparison to the attention that the Hum-Vee received for its service in Gulf War Operation: Desert Storm, the following year. Also, a privately-owned Hum-Vee was modified into the first Snow-Vee, including the addition of caterpillar tracks, a new rear compartment and a new engine. This vehicle was designed for use in and just below the Arctic Circle, and the Antarctic.\n\nIn 1992, AM General began selling a civilian version of the M998 Humvee vehicle to the public under the brand name \"Hummer\".[9]\n\nGM purchase[]\n\nIn December 1999, AM General sold the brand name to General Motors, but continued to manufacture the vehicles.[9] GM was responsible for the marketing and distribution of all Hummers produced by AM General. Shortly thereafter, GM introduced two of its own design models, the H2 and H3, and renamed the original vehicle H1. AM General continued to build the H1 until it was discontinued in 2006,[12] and was contracted by GM to produce the H2. The H3 was built in Shreveport, LA alongside the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon pickups, with which it shared the GMT-355 platform (modified and designated GMT-345).\n\nBy 2006, the Hummer began to be exported and sold through importers and distributors in 33 countries.[13] On October 10, 2006, GM began producing the Hummer H3 at its Port Elizabeth plant in South Africa for international markets.[13] The Hummers built there at first were only left-hand drive, but right-hand drive versions were added and exported to Australia and other markets.\n\nThe H2 is also assembled in Kaliningrad, Russia, by Avtotor, starting in June 2004. The plant produces a few hundred vehicles annually, and its output is limited to local consumption (five dealers in Russia).\n\nOn June 3, 2008, one day prior to GM's annual shareholder meeting, Rick Wagoner, GM's CEO at that time, said the brand was being reviewed, and had the possibility of either being sold, having the production line completely redesigned, or being discontinued.[14] This was due to the decreasing demand for large SUVs as a result of higher oil prices. Almost immediately after the announcement, a pair of Indian automakers, including Mahindra & Mahindra, expressed interest in purchasing all or part of Hummer.[15]\n\nGM President Fritz Henderson stated several interested parties approached GM regarding the Hummer business. On April 5, 2009, Société de Participation Financière Eidos Canada Inc. (Eidos) made an unsolicited bid for Hummer.\n\nFailed sale[]\n\nOn June 1, 2009, as a part of the General Motors bankruptcy announcement, the company revealed that the Hummer brand would be discontinued. However, the following day GM announced that instead it had reached a deal to sell the brand to an undisclosed buyer.[16] After GM announced that same day that the sale was to an undisclosed Chinese company,[17] CNN and the New York Times identified the buyer of the Hummer truck unit as China-based Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company Ltd.[18][19][20] Later that day, Sichuan Tengzhong itself announced the deal on their own website.\n\nOn January 6, 2010, GM CEO Ed Whitacre said he hopes to close the deal with Tengzhong by the end of January 2010.[21] On 1 February 2010 it was announced that Sichuan and General Motors had agreed to extend the deadline until the end of February as Sichuan tried to get approval by the Chinese government.[22] It was also revealed that the price tag of the Hummer brand was $150 million.[23]\n\nLater, on February 24, 2010, GM announced the Tengzhong deal had collapsed and the Hummer brand would soon shut down.[24] There were reports that Sichuan Tengzhong might pursue the purchase of the Hummer brand from GM by purchasing it privately through the company's new J&A Tengzhong Fund SPC, a private equity investment fund owned by an offshore entity that was recruiting private investors to buy into its acquisition plan.[25] The financial markets posed problems for established borrowers and even more for Tengzhong, a little-known company from western China, at the same time as the potential value of the Hummer brand continued to decline given high fuel prices and weak consumer demand.[26]\n\nThe company announced it was willing to consider offers for all or part of the assets. American company Raiser along with several others expressed interest in buying the company. However, on April 7, 2010, this attempt failed as well, and General Motors officially said it is shutting down the Hummer SUV brand and offering rich rebates in a bid to move the remaining 2,200 vehicles.[27][28]\n\nModels[]\n\nHummer was the only brand in the United States whose entire model range lineup came with a low-range transfer case, relatively high-ground clearance, and off-road tires.\n\nHummer H1[]\n\nMain article: Hummer H1\n\nThe first vehicle in the Hummer range was the Hummer H1, based on the Humvee. Originally released in 1992, this vehicle was designed by American Motors' AM General subsidiary for the U.S. Military. Five years previously, AMC had been bought by Chrysler.\n\nHummer H2[]\n\nMain article: Hummer H2\n\nThe Hummer H2 was the second vehicle in the Hummer range. There were two variations: The H2 SUV and H2 SUT.\n\nHummer H3[]\n\nMain article: Hummer H3\n\nThe H3 was the smallest of the Hummer models and is based on the GMT355 platform shared with the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon compact pickup trucks.\n\nHummer concept car[]\n\nMain article: Hummer HX\n\nThe Hummer HX was developed in 2008 as an open-air, two-door off-road concept car, smaller than other Hummer models.\n\nPlug-in Hybrid[]\n\nRaser Technologies of Utah was to use technology similar to that in the Chevy Volt. Raser unveiled the prototype the 2009 Society of Automotive Engineers World Congress in Detroit.[29] Using their E-REV (Extended-Range Electric Vehicle) powertrain technology, the Hummer plug-in hybrid would run up to 40 miles per day on its battery alone, then a small 4-cylinder internal combustion engine would start to generate more electricity.[30]\n\nRacing[]\n\nTeam Hummer Racing was created in 1993 and showcases the Hummer's abilities. Led by off-road racer Rod Hall, Team Hummer competes in the Stock classes of both BitD and SCORE, which feature production-based vehicles with stock frames, stock suspension designs, and production-based engines. Specialized racing shock absorbers, tires, and other minor modifications are allowed, along with the required supporting components and mandatory safety equipment. Team Hummer stock-class H3 driven by Hall finished first in class with the H3 in the 2005 Baja 1000.\n\nTeam Hummer has tallied one of the most impressive records in production-class racing, earning 11 class wins at the Baja 1000.\n\nA highly modified, two-wheel drive Hummer was raced by Robby Gordon in the 2006, 2007 (8th place), 2009 (3rd place), and 2010 (8th place) Dakar Rally.\n\nLicensing[]\n\nGM had been active in licensing the Hummer. Various companies licensed the Hummer trademarks for use on colognes, flashlights, bicycles,[31] shoes, coats, hats, laptops,[32] clothing, CD players, and other items.[33]\n\nStarting in the early-1990s, when AM General started selling to the civilian market, Hummers began making appearances in the film and television industries. Some earlier and noticeable appearances include seaQuest DSV which used the Hummer H1 in place of Humvees, and Earth 2 which featured a large, \"solar-powered\" Hummer Concept truck as their main mode of conveyance. More recently noticeable appearances include CSI: Miami, being driven by the chief of the crime lab Lt. Horatio Caine (played by David Caruso], during the 6th season of CSI: Miami, they received all new 2008 H2s with redesigned interior and in the 2007 Transformers movie the Autobot known as Ratchet transforms into a search and rescue Hummer H2.\n\nProduction facilities[]\n\nAM General Hummer H1 Assembly Plant, Mishawaka, Indiana – 500,000-square-foot (46,000 m²) plant opened 1984 to build HMMWV(HUMVEE) and began production of the Hummer/H1 in 1992.\n\nAM General Hummer H2 Assembly Plant, Mishawaka, Indiana – 673,000-square-foot (62,500 m²) plant opened 2002.\n\nGeneral Motors South Africa Struandale Assembly Plant, Port Elizabeth, East Cape, South Africa - built in 1996, expanded to 75,625-square-metre (814,020 sq ft) to build H3 models.\n\nGeneral Motors Shreveport Operations, Shreveport, Louisiana – in 2005 an additional 296,000-square-foot (27,500 m²) was added to plant built by GM in 1981 to accommodate the production of the H3. In July 2009, GM had shut down Hummer production of the H3, but the automaker had a special fleet order from Avis Rent a Car System.[34]\n\nAvtotor Kaliningrad, Russia – licensed version of H2 starting in 2008\n\nOwner efforts[]\n\nHummer vehicles have been called into use during disaster situations. An organization, Hummer Owners Prepared for Emergencies (HOPE), was created by the Hummer Club and the American Red Cross.[35] It trains volunteer Hummer owners with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and first aid skills, as well as basic off-highway skills so that they may assist victims during a disaster situation. GM had paid the Red Cross $4 million to participate in the organization.[36]\n\nCriticisms[]\n\nCriticism of Hummers includes the criticism of SUVs in general, although at a higher degree. Specific extra criticisms of Hummers include:\n\nSize\n\nHummers (specifically the H1 and H2) are significantly bigger than other SUVs; this can cause problems parking, driving and fitting in a garage. Their large size also potentially poses a serious threat to smaller vehicles.[37]\n\nEcology\n\nSafety and ecological perceptions from other road users has attracted a lot of criticism.[38][39] The Hummer (usually the H2) has been singled out and attacked, sometimes using violent means, as a symbol of ecological irresponsibility.[40][41][42]\n\nPoor fuel economy\n\nEven compared to other heavy passenger vehicles, Hummers without the Diesel engine options have very poor fuel economy. Because the H2 is built to the over-8500-lb GVW class, its fuel economy is neither published by the U.S. EPA nor counted toward Corporate Average Fuel Economy.[43] For instance, H2 in one engine configuration averages about 14 mpg-US (17 L/100 km/17 mpg-imp) on highways, 10 mpg-US (24 L/100 km/12 mpg-imp) in the city, and has a curb weight of over 6,000 lb (2,700 kg), making it technically illegal for use on some streets in the U.S.[44]\n\nSafety\n\nCrash data for Hummers is less complete than for other SUVs. Because of its weight, it takes longer and further to stop in emergency braking situations. As a Class 3 truck, the Hummer is exempt from many DOT safety regulations.[45] The H1 lacks standard safety features, including child safety locks, child seat tethers, side air bags, and stability control. Large blind spots make parking difficult and possibly dangerous.[45]\n\nDrivers\n\nA one-year long study conducted by a firm that provides statistical information to insurance companies so they can determine rates found that drivers of H2 and H3 Hummers receive about five times as many traffic tickets as the national average for all vehicles (standardized based on the number of violations per 100,000 miles driven).[46]\n\nSee also[]\n\nCriticism of sport utility vehicles\n\nHumvee\n\nReferences[]\n\nThis page uses some content from Wikipedia.
