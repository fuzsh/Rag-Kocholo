        "text": "Hummer Stock Images – Trucks and SUVs\n\nThe Hummer is an iconic brand of trucks and SUVs originally derived from the legendary military Humvee. This four-wheel drive light truck reached the U.S car market in 1992 when AM General began selling a civilian version of the M998 Humvee. In 1998, GM purchased the brand name and started marketing three vehicles under the Hummer brand – the Hummer H1, based on the Humvee military light truck, and the H2 and H3 models based on smaller GM platforms.\n\nView more Hummer Images at www.izmostock.com\n\nHummer vehicles ruled the road during the turn of the century, but by 2008, these gas guzzlers were quickly going out of favour. Hit by a serious sales slump, the GM management initially placed the Hummer brand under review. However, instead of transferring Hummer to the Motors Liquidation Company as part of GM bankruptcy, the company started looking for a serious buyer for the brand.\n\nIn 2009, a Chinese vehicle manufacturer called Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company announced its interest in acquiring Hummer for a reported $150 million. The deal didn’t come through, and GM continued to retain Hummer.\n\nIn 2010, General Motors announced it would begin dismantling the Hummer brand and Hummer dealerships began shutting down. The last H3 rolled off the Hummer line at Shreveport, Louisiana on May 24, 2010.\n\nHummer Vehicle Line-up\n\nHummer H2\n\nHummer H3"
