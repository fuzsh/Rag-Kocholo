        "text": "Overview\n\nRepresenting five tons of supertruck fun, the 2025 GMC Hummer EV Pickup is a massive, 1000-horsepower beast unlike anything else on the market. The full-size pickup is second in uniqueness only to the weirdly shaped Tesla Cybertruck, which doesn’t match the GMC’s tri-motor setup for sheer power. Want serious off-roading capability? Add the Extreme Off-Road package, complete with supplemental underbelly protection, locking differentials, more camera angles, 35-inch mud-terrain tires, and upgraded axles. Those who prefer to get their kicks on top of the pavement will note the Hummer EV pickup’s WTF mode (short for Watts to Freedom) that transforms the truck into a bewilderingly quick dragster: in testing, it shot to 60 mph in a scant 3.3 seconds. Considering that it tips the scales at nearly five tons, that’s insanely impressive. Boasting a range of 311 miles in the two-motor configuration and a maximum of 381 miles when assisted by three motors, the Hummer EV Pickup can go a decent distance on one charge of its huge battery. If insanity on wheels is not what you're looking for, know that the Hummer EV pickup doesn’t beat the charging speed, range, or lower price point of the top-rated Rivian R1T.\n\nWhat's New for 2025?\n\nNot much. GMC added two colors to the lineup for 2025: an arresting Solar Orange (as if the Hummer EV Pickup weren’t already conspicuous enough) and a subtler Graphite Blue Metallic. Other than that, the automaker made no changes to the latest model.\n\nPricing and Which One to Buy\n\nThe price of the 2025 GMC Hummer EV Pickup starts at $98,845 and goes up to $106,945 depending on the trim and options.\n\nThe Hummer EV3X costs $8100 more than the EV2X, but we'd spend that to almost double the horsepower and have the Watts to Freedom launch-control mode to impress our friends by enabling rocket ship-like takeoffs. The EPA estimates that tri-motor models with the standard battery and 22-inch wheels have a 314-mile range, but a new optional extended-range battery ups estimated range to 381 miles. We'd pass on the bigger pack and instead choose the Extreme Off-Road package. That drops the range estimate to 298 miles but adds several features that will increase your enjoyment coefficient in the dirt. The separate Off-Road Readiness package adds a full-size spare tire that matches the other wheels and a vertical bed-mounted tire carrier. To maximize the enjoyment of our outdoor adventures, we'd also choose the available removable roof panels.\n\nEngine, Transmission, and Performance\n\nThe Hummer EV Pickup currently offers either two or three electric motors. Both configurations come with all-wheel drive; the dual-motor setup has 570 hp and the tri-motor version whips up 1000 hp. While we were wowed by the Hummer EV's unearthly acceleration, we were disappointed by its braking performance. Slowing the massive machine to a stop from 70 mph took an extra-long 211 feet, and repeated runs resulted in noticeable brake fade. Yikes. Maneuverability at low speeds is better than expected, a direct result of the rear-wheel-steering system, but once you're up and running the Hummer EV is as unwieldy to drive as other lifted brodozers.\n\n0-60-MPH Times\n\nThe Hummer EV Edition 1 we tested had the 1000-hp powertrain, and it rocketed to 60 mph in 3.3 seconds thanks to its Watts to Freedom (WTF) launch control mode. That makes it one of the quickest pickups we've ever tested. And nothing this heavy (9640 pounds) is anywhere near this quick.\n\nTowing and Payload Capacity\n\nThe Hummer EV pickup's maximum towing capacity is a stout 12,000 pounds, but that requires going with the 570-hp dual-motor powertrain. That exceeds the ratings for the Ford F-150 Lightningand the Rivian R1T, which are rated at up to 10,000 and 11,000 pounds, respectively. However, Hummers with three motors have a towing capacity between 7500 and 8500 pounds. During our towing test,pulling a 6100-pound double-axle camping trailer, the range of our Hummer EV dropped to just 140 miles at 70 mph.\n\nRange, Charging, and Battery Life\n\nThe Hummer EV Pickup is available with two battery sizes. The standard 20-module pack provides an EPA-estimated driving range of 311 miles for the EV2X and 314 miles for the EV3X. The latter can be equipped with a 24-module battery that GMC claims provides up to 381 miles of range. Opting for the Extreme Off-Road package reduces that estimate to 359 miles. The Hummer EV Edition 1 we tested on our 75-mph highway route traveled 290 miles on a full charge. It reached a peak charging rate of 287 kilowatts while connected to a DC fast-charger, but it only averaged 98 kW, and it took more than two hours to charge its large battery from 10 to 90 percent. GMC claims the Hummer EV pickup will add 100 miles of range in just 10 minutes; we needed about twice as long.\n\nFuel Economy and Real-World MPGe\n\nThe Hummer truck's massive weight is the enemy of efficiency. The three-motor model with its standard 22-inch wheels has an EPA-rated 58 MPGe combined. Compare that with the most powerful version of the F-150 Lightning and R1T (both fitted with 22-inch wheels) that earn 66 and 68 MPGe, respectively. For more information about the Hummer EV's fuel economy, visit the EPA's website.\n\nInterior, Comfort, and Cargo\n\nThe Hummer EV Pickup takes the form of a crew-cab truck with a five-foot-long bed. Interior materials could be of higher quality considering the Hummer's price tag and its cabin isn't as spacious as a GMC Sierra 1500 crew cab's. But the interior can be opened to the elements via optional removable roof panels that reintroduce a T-top-like design popular in GM sports and muscle cars in the 1970s and 1980s. When in place, the transparent panels are akin to a normal panoramic glass sunroof, but lifting them off and stowing them in the Hummer's front trunk gives the truck a convertible vibe similar to that of the Jeep Gladiator. Inside, several moon-inspired touches—such as a moon-boot footprint on the dead pedal and speaker grilles that show the Sea of Tranquility—serve as not-so-subtle reminders of GM's connection to NASA astronauts and the electrically powered Apollo 15 lunar rover that the company helped to engineer.\n\nInfotainment and Connectivity\n\nA large 13.4-inch display serves as the infotainment screen, and there's a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel as well. GMC contracted Epic Games—maker of the wildly popular Fortnite video game—to create the graphics for the Hummer EV's infotainment interface. The high-resolution screen and advanced graphics look great, but we noticed some pronounced lag that suggests the system doesn't have quite the processing power it needs to keep up with the software's capabilities. A host of connectivity features are standard, including wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a Wi-Fi hotspot, and GM's OnStar telematics system.\n\nSafety and Driver-Assistance Features\n\nGM's Super Cruise hands-free driving mode is a standard feature, and we've found it works quite nicely. Less advanced features such as lane-keeping assist and blind-spot monitoring are also included. For more information about the Hummer EV's crash-test results, visit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) websites. Key safety features include:\n\nStandard automated emergency braking with pedestrian detection\n\nStandard lane-departure warning and lane-keeping assist\n\nStandard adaptive cruise control with hands-free driving mode\n\nWarranty and Maintenance Coverage\n\nThe Hummer EV comes with a similar warranty to other General Motors products, which means three-year/36,000-mile bumper-to-bumper coverage and five-year/60,000-mile powertrain coverage.\n\nLimited warranty covers three years or 36,000 miles\n\nPowertrain warranty covers five years or 60,000 miles\n\nElectrical components are covered for eight years or 100,000 miles\n\nComplimentary maintenance is covered for the first visit"
