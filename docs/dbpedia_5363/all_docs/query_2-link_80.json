        "text": "OK, this is a big vehicle, perhaps the widest I have ever driven. And it’s a babe magnet, if that aspect was on my mind. In my week of driving the Hummer, I received waves from blondes in BMW convertibles and from guys with red bandanas in the back of Chevy trucks. In fact, everyone I met wanted to take a good look at the Hummer. It was interesting, everyone knew about it from the TV appearances that it makes with Arnold and Bruce and the others, but very few have ever looked inside.\n\nThe Hummer was originally designed in 1979 to fit a set of military specifications and was put into service by the Army and Marines as the HMMWV or High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle. The Army saw it as a replacement for the Jeep. The spec. called for a vehicle that could go anywhere, to places that defied the imagination and to last at least 12 years under the most unforgiving conditions. Since 1979 over 150,000 HMMWV’s have been produced for the soldiers to drive.\n\nIn October 1992, AM General, who produce the vehicle, introduced the first Hummer that you and I could drive, if you could come up with the money.\n\nThe convertible Hummer that I drove had a price, as delivered, of just under $100,000 but I didn’t have to join the army to drive it. It was celebrities, like Swertzenager and Bruce Willis, who bought the first vehicles as a statement or status symbol and the rage took off. OK, for a limited audience. Driving a Hummer is an experience like no other. It is, once you get used to the width fairly easy to park and it keeps up with the other traffic driving to and from work. But that is not what the Hummer was designed for.\n\nScale 22\" vertical rock ledges. Ford 30\" of water. Traverse 40% side slopes. Climb 60% grades. Plow through three-foot snowdrifts. That is where the Hummer is at home. It wasn’t designed to take the kids to soccer, although it will do it. It wasn’t designed to capitalize on the current SUV craze. It was designed to go everywhere you could imagine four wheels going.\n\nAbout 45 minutes north of the San Fernando Valley, the California Department of State Parks maintains the Hungry Valley State Vehicular Recreation Area (SVRA). Located at Tejon Pass in the Tehachapi and San Emigdio Mountains of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, Hungry Valley offers 19,000 acres and over 130 miles of scenic trails for off-road recreation.\n\nA ten-acre site adjacent to the trails has been developed to provide an area where 4-Wheel- Drive enthusiasts may test their personal capabilities and that of their vehicles. The practice area contains eight man-made features that replicate conditions and terrain found throughout California’s backcountry. There is a hill with both dirt and rock climbs, a loose rock traverse, and a three-foot deep-water crossing.\n\nFrom this area a series of trails lead out into the valley. The trails are assigned a difficulty rating, from a Green Circle (easiest), Blue Square (more difficult) and Black Square (most difficult)\n\nWhen going off-road preparation is most important. Don’t go on your own and know your limitations. I took my 14-year-old daughter; Jilliann and her friend Chris who were to be my spotters. AM General say you can drive the Hummer almost anywhere, but my advice is to look carefully before driving forward. I know my limits and I am very careful not to push them.\n\nMost weekends, Hungry Valley is full of families enjoying the off-road trails, and kids riding their ATV’s and motorbikes through the bush and the trails. Again, the Hummer attracted lots of attention, especially when we arrived from directions that vehicles don’t normally appear.\n\nI have driven most SUV’s on the market and I think of myself as an experienced off-roader but this beomoth gave me a whole new experience. Wherever I pointed it , it went. Trails that I have never attempted seemed easy and once I got used to the width of the Hummer my comfort level increased. This is a remarkable vehicle and it has a price tag to match. And at these prices who cares that it only gets 8 miles to a gallon of deisel fuel.\n\nGeneral Motors recently launched an all-new redesign of the www.HUMMER.com website. This friendly consumer site is geared towards Hummer owners and enthusiasts and will provide Internet surfers the opportunity to experience all things Hummer.\n\nHummer of Thousand Oaks in the Auto Mall has a selection of vehicles for test drive and if you really want to try the Hummer they have a special rental scheme that lets you drive one for a day or two. Call them at (818) 889-2126 and ask for details."
