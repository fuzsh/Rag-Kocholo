        "text": "Hummer’s history as an electric truck is considered one of the most exciting stories in the automotive industry. Hummer has played many different roles at home and abroad over the decades. The story goes that in the early 1980s, the Hummer was introduced as a combat vehicle for the U.S. military. In 1989, the Hummer served as a combat vehicle in the U.S. invasion of Panama.\n\nA Chinese auto company, Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company, expressed interest in building a Hummer in 2009 but changed its mind after not getting approval from Chinese regulators. This four-wheeled vehicle was a powerful combat vehicle that is now popular for driving on American roads. It then introduced its civilian version as well. No matter the era, Hummer vehicles always seem to make a place for themselves. The latest and greatest makeover of the Hummer brand ushers in a new era for the American icon that has been with us for the past four decades. We have some interesting facts about us that you need to know; let’s find out.\n\nTop 12 Interesting Facts About Hummer\n\nThe Hummer is a vehicle that has made the journey from the battlefield to urban streets. Here are the top 12 interesting facts about Hummer.\n\n1. The Term Hummer is an Acronym\n\nA unique and interesting thing about Hummer is that the term is an abbreviation of Humvee or HMMWV, which means High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle. Before the civilian version of the Hummer hit the streets, the Hummer was considered a military-grade vehicle, which was made for soldiers and used to fight wars. The term describes it. The HMMWV entered service years before Operation Desert Storm made “Humvee” a household term in the U.S.\n\n2. Hummer AM Was the Winning Design of the General\n\nIf we talk about the history of the old Hummer, it was one of the three prototypes of a compelling, multi-purpose SUV. The High Military Combat Vehicle program only considered it. Three companies participated in building the Hummer, including AM General, Chrysler Defender, and Teledyne Continental. Among these companies, the best was AM General’s 6.2-liter V8 Hummer, built with a three-speed automatic transmission and was a winning design.\n\nIn 1983, AM General won the contract to produce the initial batch. Before that, until the late 1980s, AM General built many thousands of Hummers. These include large vehicles, called Humvees, designed to transport troops and equipment.\n\n3. Arnold Schwarzenegger was the First Owner of a Civilian Hummer\n\nAction movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger was very fond of us. He was keen to buy the Hummer and talked to AM General about making a civilian version. So AM General built a civilian version, and in 1992 Schwarzenegger had the first civilian version of the M988 Humvee in his garage. Hummer also inspired the ‘Terminator’ on the Action Hero SUV.\n\n4. Hummer is a Robust Off-Road Vehicle\n\nAnother essential fact about Hummer is that it has excellent off-road skills. The ground clearance of this vehicle is excellent. Unlike conventional 4X4s built in the 1980s, the Humvee had an independent front and rear suspension. This big car perform well with 30 inch Jeep Rims. It gave the Humvee a ground clearance of 16 inches. These tires were about twice the size of other 4x4s at the time. Additionally, the drivetrain sits higher in the chassis, making the Hummer as wide as an 18-wheeler. The wide stance helps keep the center of gravity low and provides additional off-road stability.\n\n5. The Hummer H1\n\nThe many versions of Hummer built each had some differences, so let’s understand their differences. As the first Hummer vehicle, the Hummer H1 was based on the Humvee. Who developed American Motors’ AM General subsidiary for the civilian market in 1992. This vehicle meets U.S. Army specifications issued in 1979. It has a unique boxy design. It is comprehensive and has excellent ground clearance. The Hummer H1 uses a turbo engine that puts out 300 horsepower and 520 lb-ft of torque. As a result of U.S. regulations prohibiting foreign governments from owning defense contractors, Renault (partially owned by the French government) took control of AMC in 1982 and sold the AM General division to Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV) in 1983. Chrysler acquired American Motors in 1987, and production of H1 civilian versions continued throughout 2006.\n\n6. The Hummer H2\n\nThe Hummer H2 was the 2nd vehicle in the Hummer range built in the AM General facility under contract from General Motors from 2002 to 2009. There were two types: The H2 SUV and H2 SUT. A full-size SUV, the Hummer H2, has a slightly higher horsepower rating of 393 but only 452 pound-feet of torque. They both convey a solid military-grade message. Sales were influential during the second, third, and fourth years of production but less significantly toward the decade’s end.\n\nRead Also: 2016 Hummer H2 Exterior, Interior, Price, Specs\n\n7. The Hummer H3\n\nFinally, the Hummer H3 is Hummer’s smallest SUV and midsize SUV. It was based on the GMT355 platform shared with the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon compact pickup trucks.H1 and H2 were manufactured by AM General, while General Motors manufactured H3. The Hummer H3 is the most fuel-efficient compared to the other two versions. The H3 model was produced from 2005 to 2010 by General Motors.\n\n8. Excellent Traction Control and Central Tire Inflation System\n\nThe Hummer is equipped with a unique and powerful traction control system called Torque Track 4 that prevents the tires from spinning. The TorqueTrack 4 traction control system automatically controls the brakes on the wheels and forces traction on the other wheels that are not spinning. Its traction control system makes it easy to drive both on-road and off-road.\n\nTire inflation systems allow many off-road vehicles to let some air out of the tires to increase traction on loose, rocky, or sandy terrain. It helps the tire avoid obstacles easily, providing a smooth ride on loose surfaces like snow and sand. Humvee’s central tire inflation system lets the driver release air pressure and set individual tire pressures for off-roading. By pressing a button on the SUV’s leather interior, drivers can inflate the tires from the comfort of the cabin.\n\nS.No Interesting Facts About Hummer 1 Hummer Acronym: The term Hummer is an abbreviation for “High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle” or HMMWV, primarily a military-grade vehicle​. 2 Winning Design: AM General’s design, a 6.2-liter V8 Hummer with a three-speed automatic transmission, won the contract to produce the Humvee for military use​. 3 First Civilian Owner: Arnold Schwarzenegger was the first owner of a civilian Hummer, influencing the production of a civilian version of the M988 Humvee​. 4 Off-Road Capabilities: Hummer is known for its robust off-road abilities, with features like independent suspension and significant ground clearance​. 5 Hummer H1: Based on the Humvee, the H1 meets U.S. Army specifications from 1979 and uses a turbo engine with 300 horsepower and 520 lb-ft of torque​. 6 Hummer H2: Manufactured under contract from General Motors, the H2 comes in SUV and SUT variants and was produced from 2002 to 2009​​.s 7 Hummer H3: The smallest in the range, the H3 was produced by General Motors and shares a platform with some compact pickup trucks​​. 8 Traction Control: Features a TorqueTrack 4 traction control system and a central tire inflation system for improved off-road navigation​​. 9 Size Comparison: Surprisingly, the Hummer SUV is shorter in length than the Toyota Camry, which aids in easier parking compared to longer SUVs​. 10 Dual Fuel Tanks: Some models come with dual fuel tanks, beneficial for extended road trips​​. 11 Celebrity Appeal: Hummers are showstoppers that have become popular among celebrities like Mike Tyson and Britney Spears​. 12 Electric Comeback: Hummer was set for a comeback in 2022 as an electric truck and SUV, with expected features such as a notable powertrain, removable air panels, adjustable air suspension, and four-wheel steering for enhanced off-roading​.\n\n9.
