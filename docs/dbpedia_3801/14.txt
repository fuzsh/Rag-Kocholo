If you’ve ever seen “The Holiday“, you’ll be familiar with Kate Winslet’s cozy cottage in the heart of countryside. Now, thanks to Airbnb, fans of the festive favorite can enjoy a stay at the property that inspired the idyllic Rosehill Cottage that has become synonymous with Christmas time.

Located in Holmbury Saint Mary, England, the cottage was scouted out researchers working on the movie before being recreated brick-for-brick in a London filming studio. The original home is currently owned by Jon and Cressida Bromley who purchased the cottage after spotting it in a property magazine. However, the couple didn’t know the significance of their new home until they noticed fans of the rom-com stopping and taking photos.

The charming 3-bedroom, 1-bathroom home can sleep up to five guests and is the ideal place for a rustic retreat set among the Surrey Hills. Low ceilings, exposed beams, and cozy furnishings give the cottage a homely, lived-in feel, while an extensive flagstone terrace is a great space for outdoor dining and entertaining. Eagle-eyed viewers will also know that the home also features the inglenook fireplace and original wooden beams as seen in the hit movie.

“The holiday cottage was very cosy and charming. The kitchen and dining area are especially fabulous, with a great dining nook from which you can look out onto a lovely view. The lounge is very comfortable, with a good stove and ample supply of firewood,” reviewed one guest in Dec. 2022. “There is a public footpath right across the street with access to miles of amazing walks, the local pubs have very good food and ale. In short, it’s an ideal countryside getaway. I highly recommend it.”

Priced at an average of £295 ($356) per night, those interested in renting out the cottage can expect long waits for a booking as the property has been reserved all over Christmas, New Year, and as far as summer 2023.
