        "text": "Southport has a rich history dating back to the 18th century, and its picturesque waterfront and downtown area have served as the backdrop for many movies and TV shows over the years! If you didn’t already know, North Carolina is the third biggest filmmaking state in the world, and the only ones ahead are California and New York.\n\nEUE/Screen Gems Studios even has a 43-acre full-service production facility right down the road in Wilmington, NC, that offers 10 stages with 150,000 square feet of shooting space! They claim to be the most prominent sound stage and special effects water tank east of LA and have hosted over 400 feature films, commercials, and television series — including Iron Man 3, Halloween Kills, One Tree Hill, and more.\n\nBut, back to what’s actually been filmed in Southport NC! When you watch these movies and TV shows, we can only imagine that you may have recognized some of the backdrops. Let’s start with a few of the most popular major motion pictures:\n\nCrimes of the Heart\n\nCrimes of the Heart was filmed at different locations throughout the Southport area in 1987! You’ll recognize it by the cast, which included Diane Keaton, Sissy Spacek, Jessica Lange, and Tess Harper. The primary shooting location for this movie was 211 Caswell Avenue, known by residents as the “Crimes of the Heart house.” Other places used in this movie include the Dosher Memorial Hospital, the Olde Smithville Burying Grounds, Orton Plantation, and even the Masonic Lodge.\n\nFirestarter\n\nThis Stephen King classic was filmed in various parts of North Carolina, including Southport! Drew Barrymore played the young girl with pyrokinetic powers in the 1984 film. The house that was used as the family home in the movie is located on Howe Street and was even put up for sale a few years ago.\n\nWeekend at Bernie’s\n\nWho could forget this 1989 cult classic starring Andrew McCarthy, Jonathan Silverman, Catherine Mary Stewart, and Terry Kiser? This movie was filmed almost entirely on location in the Southport area, except for a few scenes that were shot in New York City. Remember the scene where they’re driving down the road, and they pass by that sign that says “Southport 3 miles”? That was filmed on Long Beach Road near the Southport-Fort Fisher Ferry Terminal. And, the water skiing scene? It was filmed in the Cape Fear River!\n\nI Know What You Did Last Summer\n\nThis 1997 movie starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and Freddie Prinze Jr. was filmed in Southport, Wilmington, and Bald Head Island. The infamous “hook scene” was actually filmed on the pier at Southport Marina! Other locations you may recognize include the American Fish Company, the Old Yacht Basin, and the Dosher Memorial Hospital.\n\nSummer Catch\n\nThis 2001 romantic comedy starring Freddie Prinze Jr., Jessica Biel, and Matthew Lillard was filmed in multiple locations throughout North Carolina, including Southport! Remember that scene where Ryan Dunne (Freddie Prinze Jr.) is working on his car and his dad comes out to talk to him? That was filmed right in front of the Southport Visitors’ Center on Howe Street. And, the scene where Ryan is out on the boat with his friends and they’re fishing? That was filmed in the Cape Fear River!\n\nDomestic Disturbance\n\nThis 2001 thriller starring John Travolta, Vince Vaughn, Matt O’Leary, and Teri Polo was filmed in various locations throughout North and South Carolina. In Southport, you may recognize the scene where Rick Barnes (John Travolta) is driving down the road and he gets pulled over by the police. That was filmed on Long Beach Road near the Southport-Fort Fisher Ferry Terminal. Another scene in the movie was filmed at the Southport Water Treatment Plant!\n\nWalk to Remember\n\nThis 2002 romantic drama starring Shane West, Mandy Moore, Peter Coyote, and Daryl Hannah was filmed in multiple locations throughout North Carolina, including Southport and Wilmington. Remember that scene where Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) is walking down the street with Landon Carter (Shane West)? That was filmed on Howe Street in Downtown Southport. Other locations that will seem oddly familiar include the outdoor dining scene that was filed at Cape Fear Restaurant (now Oliver’s), the Old Smithville Burying Group where Jamie uses her telescope, and Trinity United Methodist Church.\n\nSafe Haven by Nicholas Sparks\n\nThis 2013 romantic drama starring Julianne Hough, Josh Duhamel, and Cobie Smulders was filmed in various locations throughout North and South Carolina. In Southport, you may recognize the Yacht Basin Grill as the restaurant where Katie Feldman (Julianne Hough) first meets Alex Wheatley (Josh Duhamel). Another scene in the movie was filmed at the Southport-Fort Fisher Ferry Terminal!\n\nThe Problem With Providence\n\nThe latest movie filmed in Southport would be The Problem with Providence, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Lily James, and Himesh Patel! This dark comedy follows the story of various residents who come from a small yet picturesque island. We’ll include more information once we know when the movie will be released.\n\nMore Feature Movies Filmed in Southport NC & the Surrounding Areas\n\nThe Longest Ride (2015): Caswell Beach\n\nTammy (2013): Boiling Spring Lakes, The Grille Restaurant on Main Street in Shallotte\n\nWe’re the Millers (2013): Brunswick Forest\n\nIron Man 3 (2013): Oak Island\n\nArthur Newman (2012): Brunswick Community Hospital\n\nThe Secret Life of Bees (2008): Amuzu Theater, Moore Street house\n\nThe Water is Wide (2006): Yacht Basin Provision Company, Orton Plantation\n\nPirate Kids II: The Search for the Silver Skull (2006): Bald Head Island, Caswell Beach, Southport\n\nPirate Kids: Blackbeard’s Lost Treasure (2004): Caswell Beach, Southport\n\nThe Lost Cause (2004): Boiling Spring Lakes\n\nPopular TV Shows Filmed in and around Southport NC\n\nUnder the Dome (2013-2015): Bay Street, Old Smithville Burying Ground, Trinity United Methodist Church\n\nRevenge (2011): Fort Johnston Garrison House/Lawn\n\nDawson’s Creek (1998-2003): Old Yacht Basin, Bay Street, Franklin Square Park, Moore Street\n\nThe Water is Wide (2006): Old American Fish Company\n\nMatlock (1986-1995): Moore Street\n\nWhere to Learn More When You’re Here\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about movies and TV shows filmed in Southport, be sure to stop by the Fort Johnston-Southport Museum & Visitors’ Center!
