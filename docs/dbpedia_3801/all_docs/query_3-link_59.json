        "text": "The oldest existing buildings on the estate are those built by the Richmond family and Charles Deering. In 1896, Samuel H. Richmond built a pioneer home for his family on the estate as part of the settlement of the Town of Cutler. In 1900, an addition to the home was built and then opened to the paid public as The Richmond Hotel – the first hotel between Coconut Grove and Key West. The graceful Mediterranean revival–style Stone House, built by Charles Deering to showcase his valuable art collection, was constructed in 1922.\n\nFrom 1913-1918, Charles Deering purchased the land and renovated the Richmond Inn, the area’s only hotel. Adding a pump station, carriage and car garage, generator house, and boat turning basin as support structures. Deering’s winter residence became a self-sustaining homestead for he and his wife, Marion. Over the next few years, Deering invited renowned botanists, David Fairchild and John Kunkel Small, to implement a restoration of the area’s natural environment. In 1922, he also contracted the notable Coral Gables’ architect Phineas Paist to build the Stone House, a 13,000 square foot Mediterranean Revival home capable of housing the massive art and furnishings collection he was relocating from his homes in Spain, New York and Chicago."
