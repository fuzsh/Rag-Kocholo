        "text": "Romcom fans can cosplay as Cameron Diaz at this cottage in the depths of the Surrey countryside – made famous by the 2006 film, The Holiday.\n\nWhen the owners bought Honeysuckle Cottage in 2019 they had no idea of its Hollywood history, but when fans started turning up to take selfies outside the house, they realised something was afoot.\n\nAn exact replica of the house, located in the village of Holmbury St Mary, appeared in The Holiday as Rosehill Cottage. Cameron Diaz’s character Amanda arranges a house swap and leaves LA to spend Christmas in the country property, which is where she also falls in love with Graham, played by Jude Law.\n\nThe owners have now listed the property on Airbnb, and for £300 per night, guests can soak up the cottage’s ambience – which includes an AGA, cosy low-beamed ceilings and a flagstone terrace.\n\nRead next: This secluded Scottish hideaway has incredible views of the Galloway Hills"
