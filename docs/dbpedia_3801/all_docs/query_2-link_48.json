        "text": "SEPTEMBER 9 – ONWARD\n\nRating: PG\n\nRuntime: 1h 42min\n\nAbout: In Disney and Pixar’s ONWARD, two teenage elf brothers, Ian and Barley Lightfoot, get an unexpected opportunity to spend one more day with their late dad and embark on an extraordinary quest aboard Barley’s epic van Guinevere. Like any good quest, their journey is filled with magic spells, cryptic maps, impossible obstacles, and unimaginable discoveries. But when the boys’ fearless mom Laurel realizes that her sons are missing, she teams up with a part-lion, part-bat, part-scorpion, former warrior – aka The Manticore – and heads off to find them. Perilous curses aside, this one magical day could mean more than any of them ever dreamed. What’s it have to do with Lincoln and the Cottage? This place helped the Lincolns cope with the losses in their own family – though we don’t know of any quests, per se…\n\n**Doors open at 7PM for this event. Please note we are expecting a slightly later sunset in September. Screening will start as soon as we can all see the movie."
