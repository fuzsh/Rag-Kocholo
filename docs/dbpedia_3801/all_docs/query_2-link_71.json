        "text": "Four years ago I shared a tour of the adorable English cottage featured in the movie, The Holiday, starring Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law and Jack Black.\n\nRosehill Cottage stole the hearts of everyone who saw the movie. If you missed that tour, you‚Äôll find it here: Tour Rosehill Cottage from the movie, The Holiday\n\nRecently, a reader of BNOTP left this comment on The Holiday (Rosehill Cottage) tour post:\n\nDear Susan! I really adore this movie. I watch it every December. üôÇ Would you like to write a post about Graham‚Äôs Mill House from that movie? It would be interesting post! Greeting from Budapest, Hungary\n\nGreetings to you, Imre and thanks so much for the suggestion!\n\nDo you remember Graham‚Äôs (played by Jude Law) home, Mill House, in the movie? Have you ever wondered if it‚Äôs real and where it‚Äôs located? It is real and Mill House is located in Wonersh, a village in the Waverley district of Surrey, England. You can see pictures of the home here: Mill House Wonersh as seen in the movie, The Holiday. As with most movies, the interior scenes were filmed in a studio.\n\nWe get our first glimpse of Graham‚Äôs home when Amanda (played by Cameron Diaz) makes a surprise visit to see him. Charming and enchanting are two words that come to mind when we first see Graham‚Äôs home.\n\nAmanda looks amazed as she enter‚Äôs Graham‚Äôs home for the first time. She‚Äôs thought all along that he was just a typical single guy and had no idea he was the father of two little girls, Sophie and Olivia.\n\nDid Graham‚Äôs home surprise you, too? It really feels homey and cozy.\n\nSince this movie takes place at Christmastime, there‚Äôs a Christmas tree here in the entrance.\n\nAs Amanda stands in the entry, she glances to her right and to her left where she catches glimpses of the kitchen‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶and the living room. You‚Äôll notice Sophie and Olivia‚Äôs artwork throughout the home.\n\nToward the very end of the movie, Iris (played by Kate Winslet) and Miles (played by Jack Black) visit and we get a better view of the living room. There‚Äôs a little dining area in the corner.\n\nThe kitchen also has an old-fashioned kitchen table. Wonder what kind of stove that is‚Ä¶maybe an Aga?\n\nI‚Äôm not showing the rooms in Graham‚Äôs home in the order we see them in the movie because I‚Äôm saving the cutest one for last.\n\nAt one point Amanda ends up in Graham‚Äôs study. It has a library feel with all the built-in bookshelves. You can tell Graham is a devoted dad because his children‚Äôs art is everywhere, even here in his study.\n\nHere‚Äôs a better view of the study, it feels masculine but still cozy.\n\nThe cutest room is the bedroom of Graham‚Äôs daughter‚Äôs, Sophie and Olivia. It‚Äôs a delightful surprise!\n\nSophie and Olivia can‚Äôt wait to show Amanda their room with its fairytale tent! The shape reminds me of Cinderella‚Äôs carriage. Does it make you think of a fairytale carriage, too?\n\nThe other side of the room looks just as you might expect the room of two little girls to look.\n\nLet‚Äôs go inside the tent and check it out.\n\nWhen you lay down inside the tent and look up, this is your view.\n\nThe movie ends and the credits begin to roll as we get once last glimpse of Graham‚Äôs home through the living room‚Äôs bay window. Such a nice way to end it. ~~~sigh~~~\n\nYou‚Äôll find a tour of Rosehill Cottage from the movie, The Holiday, here: Tour Rosehill Cottage From The Holiday"
