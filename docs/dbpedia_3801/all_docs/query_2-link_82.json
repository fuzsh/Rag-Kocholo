        "text": "Like every Erin Krakow movie, “The Wedding Cottage” was highly anticipated by Hallmark Channel fans. With her acting partner Brendan Penny, the #Hearties and #Chessies were tuned in to their TVs. Me too! I don’t know if I’m biased because I appreciate Erin, but I found this movie refreshing, funny and different from the channel’s usual telefilms. The relationship between Vanessa and Evan develops in a believable way and their chemistry is sweet. The wedding cottage is situated in the fictional town of Stony Bridge, Vermont. But my eye immediately recognized the streets of Fort Langley, British Columbia. So I checked around a bit more and found the filming locations for you. At the end of the article you’ll find a Google map with all the places listed!\n\nThe reconstruction of New York City\n\nVanessa lives and works in New York. This is where her partner Jill stays while she goes to Vermont.\n\nThe exterior set of Martini Town Studios reproduces the streets and architecture of New York City. It’s pretty good if you ask me, better than the Warner Bros ones. Several Hallmark Movies have shot scenes or a whole movie there. I think of Lights, Camera, Christmas! that I really loved.\n\nThe Wedding Cottage\n\nVanessa finds out that Stony Bridge Cottage, once a prime wedding destination, is in a sorry state. She’s willing to do anything to hold her clients’ wedding there, even completely renovate it at her own expense. But she has to convince Evan first, the grumpy new owner of the place. With tenacity, she succeeds in getting his approval and begins a five-week renovation project under the supervision of her contractor Daryl.\n\nThis beautiful 1918 mansion, deceptively abandoned and neglected, has been used for several films (Adaline, Legends of Tomorrow, Riverdale, Once Upon A Time, Arrow, etc.) and Hallmark Movies and Series. It is located on the Foxglove Farm Everlasting property at the end of a private driveway where it is difficult to access. The interior scenes of the works and the exterior scenes like the wedding or the leaf blower are shot on location.\n\nStony Bridge Bed and Breakfast\n\nSWithout knowing how long she will be in town, Vanessa books a room at Marylin’s Bed and Breakfast. Marylin will be supportive and helpful during the five weeks of wedding planning and cottage renovation.\n\nIt is a real hotel in Langley called Princess and the Pea. The indoor scenes such as the dance class, but also the room and the patio, are shot on location without much change from the original setting. The building is a historical 1880s hotel and tours are available.\n\nStony Bridge Hardware Store\n\nWhile looking for contactors to do the work, Vanessa meets Neil who runs the town’s hardware store.\n\nThe architecture of this house located in Fort Langley does not go unnoticed. I had taken a picture of it during my visit of the city because it made me think of a ski lodge. It’s actually a plant based restaurant and it’s well rated, it’s definitely worth a stop. The business next door is a clothing and accessories store called Always, Sunny Shop.\n\nOrchard Lane Restaurant\n\nThe Orchard Lane restaurant is a true social gathering place in Stony Bridge. It welcomes the locals and mostly Vanessa and Evan’s dates. It’s probably the only establishment of its kind in the city for everyone to gather around.\n\nt looks like it, but the 9992 on 240 Street in Maple Ridge is not a restaurant at all, but the century-old residential home with a rich heritage. Known as the “Hill House”, you can read about its history HERE.\n\nBridge in the forest\n\nVanessa walks through the forest on the property to find wildflowers that will make up the bouquet and floral arrangements for the wedding. She runs into Evan and the two of them discuss their past romantic relationships.\n\nWhen Calls The Heart fans will instantly recognize Elizabeth and Lucas‘ famous “kissing bridge”. A nice nod from Erin and the production.\n\nStony Bridge Shopping Street\n\nVanessa and the bride and groom visit various businesses in town to make choices about cakes and floral arrangements for their ceremony.\n\nWhen Erin is on the phone, she is standing at 9080 Glover Road in Fort Langley. Later, as they all go from store to store, they walk past the storefront of Blueberry Meadows Interiors.\n\nClosed Bridge\n\nEvan drives the couple to the cottage but the bridge is closed and they need to cancel their plans.\n\nThe bridge is one of the many film sets available at Martini Town Studios.\n\n☟\n\nIf you want to walk in the footsteps of Erin Krakow and Brendan Penny, here are all the locations previously mentioned on a map around Langley, BC. Please share your exploration with me in the comments."
