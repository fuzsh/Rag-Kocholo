It has been used as everything from a college campus to a park, homes and apartments to a hospital, an opera house to a dance hall.\n\nWe’ve been proud to work with production teams from The Bride, Law & Order SVU, Fosse/Verdon, Wonder Wheel, Gotham, God Friended Me, Madame Secretary, Life Itself, Katy Perry, and Lady Gaga, among many others. For inquiries, contact Jordan Kimbrough at jkimbrough@snug-harbor.org or 718-425-3516.\n\nCreative minds can find opportunities to shoot in every nook and cranny of the campus. The buildings represent the changing architectural styles of the 19th and 20th centuries. The first buildings were built in the Greek Revival style. Others demonstrate marked Beaux Arts, Renaissance Revival, Second Empire and Italianate styles with high Victorian decorative components. Many of the indoor spaces are unfurnished, providing a blank canvas for a set. Expansive outdoor spaces provide a unique setting as the seasons change.\n\nIndoor spaces include:\n\nMusic Hall\n\nArt Galleries\n\nCarpenter’s Shop\n\n19th Century Residences\n\nBasements\n\nGreenhouses\n\nDance Studios\n\nClassrooms\n\nUnique hallways, stairways and other architectural features"
