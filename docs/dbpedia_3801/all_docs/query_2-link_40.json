        "text": "\"Open Corner House\" by The Up Studio\n\nIn 2019 we designed a modern farmhouse for a young Long Island family. Two years later, we got a call from an unknown number. What became of that call was bigger than we could have imagined (and we imagine things for a living!)\n\nOn the other end was a location scout from Netflix. Sheâd seen our Open Corner House online and wanted to know if it was available to rent. It wasn't... not really. (It had been, and still is, the primary residence of the family we designed it for.)\n\nBut, she had my attention.\n\nA year prior, the author Rumaan Alam had released a timely thriller about a family vacationing on Long Island and a catastrophic event that unwittingly leads two families together to weather a mysterious disaster."
