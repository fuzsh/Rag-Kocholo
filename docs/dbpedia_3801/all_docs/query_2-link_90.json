        "text": "Last week we did a crazy thing – we went to visit the Jesse Stone House!\n\n“The Jesse Stone House” as it’s known around here, is from the Tom Selleck series filmed in the area (2005-2012). It’s beautiful and iconic, set on an island accessed by a footbridge. We are not looking to move, but this house has been in John’s dreams since we first saw it so we were tempted.\n\nMany years ago, when we first started exploring the area, someone directed us to Stonehurst South, and we loved the area and the Jesse Stone House.\n\nWe now live in the area, and kayak under the bridge and around the little island regularly. It’s just around the cove from our house and we’re always smitten with it.\n\nThe property came up for sale a few years ago and John was more than interested in looking at it. However, it was completely rough inside, no plumbing, no insulation, needed fully rewired, etc. I was not interested at all! We were knee-deep into renovations of our current cottage and I couldn’t fathom starting all over again.\n\nIt was purchased by a lovely couple who completely gutted it – down to the studs as they say. Oh my, it’s lovely now! It’s back on the market and we were invited to go have a look, so we did.\n\nWe have no interest in moving. But, we’ve learned to never say never…lol\n\nSo…when our friend Alex, who is listing the house invited us to go look at it before it hit the market – we went. It was a beautiful idyllic evening. Off we went with some friends – across the bridge that Tom Selleck crosses every movie to check out the “Jesse Stone House”.\n\nLet’s have a peek…\n\nThe series stars so many great actors. Tom Selleck, Kathy Baker, Viola Davis and so many more.\n\nThe Jessie Stone series was completely filmed in the area. There are 9 movies. A common question – in what order to watch the Jessie Stone movies? Trust us, you will ask this question at some point lol. If you wish to watch the Jesse Stone movies in timeline order, you should view them as follows:\n\nJesse Stone: Night Passage (2006)\n\nJesse Stone: Stone Cold (2005)\n\nJesse Stone: Death in Paradise (2006)\n\nJesse Stone: Sea Change (2007)\n\nJesse Stone: Thin Ice (2009)\n\nJesse Stone: No Remorse (2010)\n\nJesse Stone: Innocents Lost (2011)\n\nJesse Stone: Benefit of the Doubt (2012)\n\nJesse Stone: Lost in Paradise (2015)\n\nHow fun to dream about living on an island, with incredible ocean views from every window.\n\nIt was such a pleasure to view this home and explore the little island it’s on.\n\nIt’s really ideal for a summer home. For someone who “winters away”. Winters would be difficult there, so we spent a lovely evening dreaming of “what if” and loved touring around, but alas, we are not moving to the Jesse Stone House.\n\nAs you may see, in the photo above, we were investigating the old wharf stone foundations – I love thinking of all the past lives lived here in this area. Such amazing history.\n\nThat was fun…but we love our cottage home here in South Shore Nova Scotia, and our view, and although I don’t have plans to move – we do always have our eye on the real estate market. Just keep dreaming!\n\nWhat a great experience to visit the house set and explore the private island a bit. This is going to make someone a wonderful summer home.\n\nIf you’d like to see the current listing (if it’s still available) you can see it here with realtor Alex Astbury HERE.\n\nIf you are interested, you can order the full Jesse Stone series here. It’s a great binge movie watch, and you’ll get a great vision of what it’s like living in our area (minus the murders!).\n\nWould you live on an island? Have you watched the series? I’d love to know.\n\nI guess we won’t be moving to Tom Selleck’s house. But it was a great visit.\n\nThanks for following along,\n\nxo\n\nWendy and John\n\nPin it and share it!"
