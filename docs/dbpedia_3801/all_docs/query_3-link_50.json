        "text": "Photo caption: The film Loving Vincent captures Vincent Van Gogh’s life story in his incredible painting style. Image by David Mark from Pixabay.\n\nFor most people, artists included, winter time means bundling up against the cold, evenings spent with loved ones and occasionally, a movie marathon to while away the time. Naturally, we have some favorite movies that we like to watch when cold nights descend upon us. And naturally, our favorites include movies about artists and their lives.\n\nThese films inspire us, help to bolster our courage and give us a glimpse of what life could be like if and when we honor the artist within. And of course, movies about artists are a fun way to learn a little about art history. Although there are plenty of worthy films, we’ve limited our list of films about artists to five. Here they are.\n\n1. Thomas Kinkade’s Christmas Cottage\n\nThis is a great movie for artists who like Thomas Kinkade’s work. It’s a bio-pic about a time when the artist’s mother and his family almost lost their home one Christmas season. Its storyline is reminiscent of old-fashioned Christmas movies, like “It’s a Wonderful Life,” where family and friends band together to help out their neighbors. It stars Jared Padalecki, Marcia Gay Harden and Peter O’Toole.\n\nRent the movie on YouTube.\n\n2. Frida\n\nKnown for her haunting self-portraits, Frida Kahlo’s works told stories of suffering and grief, but also joy. French writer Andre Breton called her work Mexican surrealism, though she herself didn’t like that term. To Frida Kahlo, her work was just about life as she lived it. The 2008 movie, starring Salma Hayek as artist Frida Kahlo covers her life as an artist, as well as her marriage to fellow artist Diego Rivera. The movie also stars Alfred Molina, Antonio Banderas, Ashley Judd and Mia Maestro.\n\nRent the movie on YouTube.\n\n3. The Girl With the Pearl Earring\n\nJohannes Vermeer’s painting The Girl With the Pearl Earring has long captivated art lovers. This film tells the story of Griet, a young servant girl who worked in the home of Vermeer. It’s beautifully filmed, full of intrigue and drama and highlights the story behind one of the most famous paintings of all time. The film stars Scarlett Johansson and Colin Firth.\n\nRent the movie on YouTube.\n\n4. Loving Vincent\n\nThis movie about artist Vincent Van Gogh is a treat within a treat. Not only does it tell the story of the painter’s life, it does so in his signature painting style. Loving Vincent is the first fully painted feature film in history. It took 125 professional painters to create the film’s 65,000 frames. It’s poignant, beautiful and memorable - a must-see for any fan of Van Gogh’s work.\n\nRent the movie on YouTube.\n\n5. My Left Foot\n\nThis film tells the story of Christy Brown, a writer and artist, who suffered from the effects of cerebral palsy. The condition left Brown with control of only his left foot. Thanks to Brown’s determination and the help of others, Brown not only went on to become an artist, but to inspire artists everywhere. The film stars Daniel Day-Lewis as Christy Brown.\n\nRent the movie on YouTube.\n\nLearn More About Art History by Reading These Art Blogs\n\n5 Christmas Paintings That Capture the Spirit of the Season\n\nArt That Changed the World: The Freedom From Want"
