At the height of prohibition, morale was high, morals were at an all-time low, and most of the country was controlled by the Mafia.\n\nAt this cozy little hot spot, hidden in the old Tinker mansion, you will find the best night scene around. Drink, dance, sing and mingle with other like-minded individuals but be careful, wherever there is a speakeasy there is always the mafia…and the police. On a night like tonight, with tensions running high, you might get caught in the middle of a bloody dispute. Enjoy your night but keep your guard up, we’d hate to lose any of our clientele!\n\n\"The History of Beer in Rockford\"\n\nSummer Lecture\n\nSeptember 8th 2-4pm\n\nWe are excited to have Gary Patton join us for our 2024 summer lecture series!
