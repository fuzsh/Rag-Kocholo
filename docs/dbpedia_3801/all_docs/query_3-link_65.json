        "text": "Cottages & Lodges\n\nCHOOSE YOUR FAVORITE\n\nThe Colorado Chautauqua offers a charming assortment of historic cottages and lodge spaces, each with fully equipped kitchens, and most with private screened in porches. Come stay with us and enjoy the great outdoors with front door access to over 40 miles of open space hiking trails, year-round cultural programming, full-service Dining Hall, historic General Store, and the newly renovated children’s playground with its own mini-Flatirons mountain!\n\nConcerts & Events\n\nSOMETHING FOR EVERYONE\n\nThe Chautauqua Auditorium’s lofty, open architecture is from another era and its incredible acoustics keep the music real. For more than 120 years the Auditorium has welcomed a diverse array of music legends, including Wynton Marsalis, Lyle Lovett, Joan Baez, Amos Lee, Mary Chapin Carpenter, BB King, Ziggy Marley, the Indigo Girls, Keb’ Mo’ and many others. Add the best of classical music from the Colorado Music Festival, film festivals, dance extravaganzas, public art exhibits and distinguished speakers to the mix, and there is truly something for everyone at Chautauqua. During Colorado’s chillier months, the Community House is a favorite with audiences looking to experience concerts, films and lectures in a more intimate setting.\n\nMeetings & Celebrations\n\nA DAY TO REMEMBER\n\nChautauqua has long been one of the most popular wedding locations in the country and is increasingly the choice of many organizations for company meetings and retreats. Choose from a variety of indoor and outdoor venues and let our experienced staff work with you to select the perfect lodging, dining, and catering options for your meeting or celebration!\n\nDining & Catering\n\nFINE FOOD, HOW YOU LIKE IT\n\nThe Chautauqua Dining Hall has been a Boulder favorite since 1898 and serves fresh, farm-to-table Colorado bistro cuisine for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Guests looking for something quicker can stop in at the General Store and pick up an espresso or cold drink and fresh, organic snacks to go. Guests who prefer to dine in while staying in one of our cozy cottages can order online from the Dining Hall or have groceries delivered straight to their cottage.\n\nThe General Store and Chautauqua Cafe\n\nJUST LIKE THE OLD DAYS\n\nVisit the Chautauqua General Store, an adorable, recently restored cottage serving espresso, chai, ice cream, and locally produced teas. While you’re there, pick up fresh, organic “to go” snacks and drinks for your hike, a picnic lunch to have on the Green, or a gift to take back home! You can now enjoy your General Store coffee and food, meet up with friends, listen to local singer-songwriters or take in the stunning Foothills views from the tented Chautauqua Cafe – a sustainable reconstruction of a 1899-1905 structure on the very same spot. You can even buy Chautauqua merchandise when you return home from our online store.\n\nSupport\n\nSO MANY REASONS TO GIVE\n\nFor 125 years (Yes, 2023 is our 125th Anniversary Year!), the Colorado Chautauqua Association has served as the nonprofit steward of the historic Colorado Chautauqua, a National Historic Landmark. As a 501(c)(3) organization, Chautauqua relies on generous donors like you to help us continuously improve the quality of our arts, cultural, community and educational programming and preserve our historic buildings and grounds. Please consider giving generously to support this treasured community asset!"
