        "text": "The Idea of You is undoubtedly one of the year’s most anticipated rom-coms, and it’s finally available to stream on Prime Video. Starring Anne Hathaway and Nicholas Galitzine and based on the book of the same name, the movie follows Solène (Hathaway), a 40-year-old single mom who enters into a whirlwind romance with 24-year-old Hayes Campbell (Galitzine), a member of the hottest boyband in the world.\n\nSolène, an art history graduate, runs her own art gallery — so it’s no surprise that her California home is a design dream. Despite being set in Silver Lake, the home is actually portrayed by a residence in Atlanta, Georgia, which was spotted on Airbnb by the movie’s production team. While the exterior was perfect for the look, the team spent two months renovating the space to bring back the rich history and personality of the Craftsman house.\n\nTo amp up the design factor, they added wood beams, painted faux wood grain on the trim and even painted the walls to complement Hathaway’s skin tone. “We completely redid the kitchen with custom wooden cabinets, Craftsman-era tiles, and added window panes,” production designer Amy Williams told House Beautiful. \"We painted the walls to complement Hathaway's complexion. All of the paint colors were tested against her skin tone on camera prior to selection.\"\n\nAfter the renovations, the home owners decided to keep the new design. If you want your own slice of Solène’s life — boy band romance not included — The Idea of You house is still available to rent on Airbnb.\n\nThe three bedroom, three bathroom home features an open floor plan on the main level. With state-of-the-art appliances, the newly renovated kitchen features a rustic-chic design with wooden paneled cabinets, Craftsman-style tiles, marble countertops, and hints of jewel tones to add a rich pop of color. Walking through to the dining area, a large dining table sits atop a vintage-style area rug. The walls are painted a deep blue-green hue, while wooden beams on the ceiling draw the eyes upwards and adds a lived-in feel to the space.\n\nIn the living room, coziness is a priority, from the statement green-tiled fireplace right down to the quaint reading nook that’s tucked away in the corner. Plush fabrics and wooden accents dominate the space.\n\nTwo of the three bedrooms are situated on the main level. The front bedroom has been decorated with a neutral color palette that gives the space a light and airy feel, while the second main level bedroom boasts a moodier vibe thanks to deep-toned walls and decor that provides a subtle nod to the dark academia trend.\n\nThe master bedroom has its own dedicated floor in the two-story home, with many design details that mirror those of the living room and kitchen — paned windows, dark green window frames and doors, and stylish Craftsman furniture that adds a ton of character.\n\nAdditional spaces include a private sitting room, spacious glassed-in sun room, two home offices, laundry room and a beautiful front porch."
