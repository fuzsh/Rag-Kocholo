        "text": "This is our 4th year of staying at what our family deems, “Our Happy Place.” If we aren’t traveling globally, this is where we want to be. The cottages are beautiful, extremely clean, cozy and comfy, have exceptional views, and allow for a most wonderful family vacation. The amenities and attention to details always delight us and we simply adore the team that makes this place what it is…perfect! There’s no place we would stay, truly.\n\nStayed at the cottages on Charleston Harbor for our family vacation about 2 weeks ago. What a beautiful cottage , seaside cozy decorated , very clean, spectacular view, my boys loved seeing the cargo ships passing by in the harbor off the screened in back porch as did I in the mornings. Also, the staff were friendly and wonderful especially with reccomendations of things to do while visiting. We did a kayaking expedition and booked through the cottage loved our survival bag, even came with hats! Also, we did a beach lunch, they found a restaurant and packed our family picnic lunch , I asked if they had a beach umbrella that we could borrow, well the morning of our beach lunch, not only was a cooler outside our door with our lunch, there was a beach umbrella, beach chairs for the whole family, and sand toys, they really go above and beyond. Thank you so much to the Cottages on Charleston Harbor and your amazing and hard working staff- Octavia, Lisa, Alice, and Ryan for making our vacation a wonderful and memorable one. Thank you! It was a great trip we didn't even want to leave!\n\nWe didn’t want to leave! My friend and I stayed in a two bedroom cottage. It was clean, beautifully decorated, had amazing views and had everything we needed for the week. The grounds are lovely and the area is nice as well. We walked on the docks for sunset, rose the hotel bikes to the aircraft carrier, had a massage at the hotel and ate at the restaurant across the parking lot. Quick ride over the bridge to downtown. Octavia was incredibly helpful, kind and accommodating. It was my friends birthday and she hung a sign on the fireplace and left Prosecco and glasses in the kitchen. Any questions or needs she was right there. Highly recommend and hope to return soon!"
