        "text": "A tale of romance, festive cheer and a beautiful English cottage, The Holiday is a Christmas classic. For fans of the film, there’s exciting news – you can now stay in the exact home that inspired Kate Winslet’s Rosehill cottage.\n\nThe cottage from The Holiday is based on Honeysuckle cottage located in Holmbury St Mary, Surrey which was scouted by researchers looking for the “cutest, smallest, most English cottage“. Deciding the location was too far to travel from London for shooting, the home was then recreated brick-for-brick to feature in the festive film. The cottage has now been listed on airbnb and has dates available from January 2023*.\n\nHere, we take a tour around the cottage with its traditional stone exterior and scenic views of the Surrey Hills.\n\nA tour around the cottage from The Holiday\n\nHoneysuckle Cottage’s living room includes many classic country features, such as the inglenook fireplace, traditional log burner and exposed brick. The large armchair is the perfect place to snuggle down with a book on a dark winter’s evening and gives the room a truly cosy feel.\n\nThe cottage has three bedrooms in total – one with a king-size double bed, one with a standard double bed and one with a single bed.\n\nExposed beams paired with rustic furniture and a stone floor bring a farmhouse-style feel to the cottage’s dining area.\n\nThe cottage’s kitchen is the perfect example of an archetypal country kitchen, featuring wooden beams, stone flooring and an AGA, while painted kitchen cabinets create a fresh, uplifting mood.\n\nWhether you’re there to experience a part of film history or not, it’s hard to resist the picturesque views of the Surrey Hills and fresh greenery from the cottage’s bedroom window.\n\n*Availability may change, please visit here for more details.\n\nRead more:\n\nLiving room curtain ideas for your home\n\n7 best dog-friendly travel destinations in the UK\n\nWhere was The Crown filmed?
