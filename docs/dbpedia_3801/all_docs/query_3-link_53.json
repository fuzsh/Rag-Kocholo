        "text": "Here is the ultimate cozy watch list of small-town-based movies and TV shows, all with a strong dark academia and cottagecore aesthetic.\n\nThere is something attractive about being in a little cozy town as the leaves change color and cafes‚Äô finally start to serve pumpkin pie. Let‚Äôs see if we can convince you by sharing this list of the most charming small-town settings we‚Äôd all love to spend a cozy fall in.\n\nDisclosure: This post contains affiliate links, for which we make a commission if you click and make a purchase, at no extra cost to you. Check out our Charming Cottage Shoppe on Amazon for more inspirational ideas.\n\n‚Äì TV SHOWS ‚Äì\n\n(Click titles to stream or purchase)\n\nGilmore Girls\n\nThe fictional town called Stars Hollow is located in Connecticut, not far from Hartford. It is one of the most obvious choices when it comes to a cottagecore atmosphere.\n\nIt portrays the life of Lorelai and Rory, a mother and daughter combo that has been on their own in this quirky small-town environment for as long as Rory can remember.\n\nStars Hollow seems to always have a holiday festival going on or a historical reenactment of sorts, which gives the atmosphere of a well-filled cup of pumpkin-spiced latte, or if you like Lorelai, just prefer it black. At Luke‚Äôs diner of course.\n\nüçÅ‚òïA COZY FALL GILMORE GIRLS DAY | Real Stars Hollow Towns in Connecticut!\n\nOnce Upon a Time\n\nTV series for fall usually take place among the fall foliage in New England. That‚Äôs why Maine is the most perfect setting for this fictional town called ‚ÄúStorybrooke‚Äù.\n\nA town that appeared through a curse that put traditional fairytale characters in our world, ‚Äúa land with no magic‚Äù. They no longer know they are fairytale characters. Things get interesting when Emma, the outside person, living in Boston, one day gets an unexpected visit from a little boy that claims to be her son. She drives him back to the town he claims to be from. You guessed right, ‚ÄúStorybrooke‚Äù.\n\nDoes he have a wild ‚Äúimagination‚Äù or are the people there actually fairytale characters from the book of his? Your nerves will go like a roller coaster as the story unwraps. If you are watching this with a friend, you better get more than one apple turnover, cause they are gonna go fast.\n\nThe Good Witch\n\nThe Good Witch series follows the many adventures of a very secretive and enchanting woman, who culminates in her neighbor‚Äôs interest.\n\nBased on the older ‚ÄúGood Witch‚Äù cable movies, Season One follows Cassie Nightingale and Grace, her young-teenage daughter, who also shares the same special intuition as her mother. When a New Yorker moves in next door to the Grey House, they are immediately captivated by the mother-daughter duo next door.\n\nAnne With An E\n\nThis is a new take on L.M. Montgomery‚Äôs beloved children‚Äôs classic, Anne of Green Gables.\n\nFollow the adventures of a young orphan girl living in the late 19th century and how she adapts to her new home called ‚ÄúGreen Gables‚Äù. If you are familiar with the original novel, know that there are some new takes as well as characters to be introduced to, but overall the same old Anne that so many of us love.\n\nRoad To Avonlea\n\nAnother TV adaption of L.M Montgomery‚Äôs beloved novels, set on the same island as ‚ÄúAnne of Green Gables.‚Äù\n\nSarah Stanley is sent from Montreal to live with her relatives on Prince Edward Island. Set in the early 1900s. This is a perfect small-town TV show that follows Sarah and her cousin‚Äôs everyday adventures and struggles in the cozy little village of Avonlea.\n\nP.S. Did you know that this TV show is based on the book ‚ÄúThe Story Girl‚Äù by L.M. Montgomery\n\nOver The Garden Wall\n\nIf you ask anyone, which ones are the best TV shows for fall? Many will answer, ‚ÄúOver the Garden Wall.‚Äù\n\nWhy? You would ask. Because there are few animated mini-series with the same cozy autumn vibe as this. The colors, the songs, and the settings are breathing autumn from the first minute all the way until the end.\n\nIt is Cartoon Network‚Äôs 1st animated mini-series about two brothers, Wirt and Greg, who find themselves lost in a very peculiar and odd forest. They meet a bluebird named Beatrice while they travel across this strange land in the hope of finding their way home.\n\nVirgin River\n\nA nurse practitioner moves from LA to a remote northern California town to search for a fresh start and is surprised by what ‚Äî and who ‚Äî she finds. This show has cozy sceneries and is almost like *Stars Hollow‚Äôs mountain sibling town. (*Gilmore Girls)\n\n‚Äì MOVIES ‚Äì\n\n(Click titles to stream or purchase)\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer‚Äôs Stone (2001)\n\nAn orphaned boy enrolls in a school of wizardry, where he learns the truth about himself, his family, and the terrible evil that haunts the magical world. ‚Ä¶.I think we all know this one!\n\nHocus Pocus (1993)\n\nThe Sanderson Sisters have put a spell on us since we have to watch this on repeat every October and wish we were in Salem, Massachusetts!\n\nMystic Pizza (1988)\n\nA coming of age film set in a charming Connecticut ocean town in the fall.\n\nDead Poets Society (1989)\n\nRobin Williams always brings feel-good vibes and so does this poetic prep school tale set in Delaware.\n\nLittle Women (1994)\n\nWhat can be more charming than the March sisters and their cozy home all set in post-civil war Massachusetts.?\n\nDid you see our post about when we visited the real Orchard House in Concord, MA?\n\nMona Lisa Smile (2003)\n\nKatherine Watson is a recent UCLA graduate hired to teach art history at the prestigious all-female Wellesley College, in 1953.
