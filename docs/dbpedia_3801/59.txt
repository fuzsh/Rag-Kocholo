‚Äì TV SHOWS ‚Äì

Gilmore Girls

The fictional town called Stars Hollow is located in Connecticut, not far from Hartford. It is one of the most obvious choices when it comes to a cottagecore atmosphere.

It portrays the life of Lorelai and Rory, a mother and daughter combo that has been on their own in this quirky small-town environment for as long as Rory can remember.

Stars Hollow seems to always have a holiday festival going on or a historical reenactment of sorts, which gives the atmosphere of a well-filled cup of pumpkin-spiced latte, or if you like Lorelai, just prefer it black. At Luke‚Äôs diner of course.

Once Upon a Time

TV series for fall usually take place among the fall foliage in New England. That‚Äôs why Maine is the most perfect setting for this fictional town called ‚ÄúStorybrooke‚Äù.

A town that appeared through a curse that put traditional fairytale characters in our world, ‚Äúa land with no magic‚Äù. They no longer know they are fairytale characters. Things get interesting when Emma, the outside person, living in Boston, one day gets an unexpected visit from a little boy that claims to be her son. She drives him back to the town he claims to be from. You guessed right, ‚ÄúStorybrooke‚Äù.

Does he have a wild ‚Äúimagination‚Äù or are the people there actually fairytale characters from the book of his? Your nerves will go like a roller coaster as the story unwraps. If you are watching this with a friend, you better get more than one apple turnover, cause they are gonna go fast.

The Good Witch

The Good Witch series follows the many adventures of a very secretive and enchanting woman, who culminates in her neighbor‚Äôs interest.

Based on the older ‚ÄúGood Witch‚Äù cable movies, Season One follows Cassie Nightingale and Grace, her young-teenage daughter, who also shares the same special intuition as her mother. When a New Yorker moves in next door to the Grey House, they are immediately captivated by the mother-daughter duo next door.

Anne With An E

This is a new take on L.M. Montgomery‚Äôs beloved children‚Äôs classic, Anne of Green Gables.

Follow the adventures of a young orphan girl living in the late 19th century and how she adapts to her new home called ‚ÄúGreen Gables‚Äù. If you are familiar with the original novel, know that there are some new takes as well as characters to be introduced to, but overall the same old Anne that so many of us love.

Road To Avonlea

Another TV adaption of L.M Montgomery‚Äôs beloved novels, set on the same island as ‚ÄúAnne of Green Gables.‚Äù

Sarah Stanley is sent from Montreal to live with her relatives on Prince Edward Island. Set in the early 1900s. This is a perfect small-town TV show that follows Sarah and her cousin‚Äôs everyday adventures and struggles in the cozy little village of Avonlea.

P.S. Did you know that this TV show is based on the book ‚ÄúThe Story Girl‚Äù by L.M. Montgomery

Over The Garden Wall

If you ask anyone, which ones are the best TV shows for fall? Many will answer, ‚ÄúOver the Garden Wall.‚Äù

Why? You would ask. Because there are few animated mini-series with the same cozy autumn vibe as this. The colors, the songs, and the settings are breathing autumn from the first minute all the way until the end.

It is Cartoon Network‚Äôs 1st animated mini-series about two brothers, Wirt and Greg, who find themselves lost in a very peculiar and odd forest. They meet a bluebird named Beatrice while they travel across this strange land in the hope of finding their way home.

Virgin River

A nurse practitioner moves from LA to a remote northern California town to search for a fresh start and is surprised by what ‚Äî and who ‚Äî she finds. This show has cozy sceneries and is almost like *Stars Hollow‚Äôs mountain sibling town. (*Gilmore Girls)
