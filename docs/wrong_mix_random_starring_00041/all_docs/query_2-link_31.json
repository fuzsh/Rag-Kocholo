        "text": "JJ Gregory talked with Prashant in Pasadena, CA on the final day of SketchKon. After years of being a travelling artist, Prash is set to settle down in the Pacific Northwest. They began by talking about the community experience of SketchKon….\n\nQ:You have so many friends and you’ve built communities in a lot of different places. What’s that like?\n\nA:Well, I feel super lucky and blessed for having what seems like family everywhere I go so I don’t feel displaced every time I travel. It’s wonderful. Family does require work too – I actually go through a routine in my morning meditation where I touch base with friends and family across the world as a mantra of names. Geographically I go through India and Europe and Australia, Japan, America and Canada. Even though I may not see these people for years I’m touching base every day in some way. That’s how I connect and it works to keep these connections alive. It’s like the old school way of communicating before we had all our devices. I will literally be thinking about someone and get a message or a little text back and it’s amazing.\n\nNow that I’m ready to stop being a wandering vagabond and put down roots in a place, everyone can come and visit me.\n\nQ: Is that an invitation? You might get a lot of people!\n\nA: Yeah! (laughing) It’s going to be a secret Island very difficult to travel to. But everyone is welcome.\n\nQ: I love the way that you talk about nature being part of your community and I think it ties in to your desire to nest in the Pacific Northwest. You’ve talked about how all the living creatures of this universe are connected and that’s a beautiful thing in much of your artwork, too.\n\nA: Oh my goodness. Yeah, exactly! It’s one of my greatest inspirations and I don’t know if it’s just because I was born by the coast but I especially feel like water connects us all. I’m definitely drawn to nature. I feel like I’ve lived in cities most in my life and feel ready to immerse myself closer to nature and that is very exciting.\n\nQ: What’s next on your travel schedule?\n\nA: I’m off to Toronto and then perhaps I will spend New Year’s break visiting my brother and his family in lovely Arizona. A little bit of warmth in the midst of winter and then I’m off to India in January. It’s usually a packed schedule while I’m there, but I’m taking it as it comes. For now, I will be starting off with a group show that bridges graphic novel/comic book style art with fine art. I enjoy the blurring of those boundaries.\n\nQ: So as a closing question, what was the highlight for you being in Pasadena with the Sketchbook Skool Community?\n\nA: Oh my gosh! Meeting and learning and sharing and partaking and yeah, just being inspired by so many incredible artists here. Some of the presentations and things that I attended moved me very deeply. The fact that I made so many new friends also, which is part of the ongoing growth of community, right?\n\nQ: So you’re going to have a bunch of new people to check in with in your meditation tomorrow morning.\n\nA: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That’s right!"
