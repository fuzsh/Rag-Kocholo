His audio visual treatment and presentation was fascinating, as he utilizes the chant galore soundtrack and‚Ä¶\n\nSo this is what a combination of Sri Anjaneyam and Anji would look like 20 years later in a Pan-India Cinematic Universe climate... enjoyed it, but if you know me, I tend to nitpick only the films in which I could see a greater potential rather than an outright mid film or something that didn't work for me. So, in the same regard, audacious and ambitious from Prasanth Varma as always, I mean here's someone irrespective of how the writing would eventually turn out to be, has the vision to inject the mythological or historical or fantastical into any sort of a film and when it's even more direct like a Hanu-Man, I expected him to be far better a‚Ä¶\n\nPrashant Varma cooked üî•\n\nExperimenting with my cinematic experiences I found the underdog of Sankranti releases. I‚Äôm all in for films that experiments and takes you out of the same old fatigue hero saves the village but with Hanuman and the mythological touch; all the atrocious ‚ÄúTelugu‚Äù action sequences gets the validation and logic behind it. After all these years!\n\nToiling with a mythology and religion you could go wrong but Prashant really cooked and ate and left no crumbs. I had absolute blast with a great Telugu audience mixed with others audiences as well. Goosebumps throughout the climax.\n\nTo believe that this was made in just 25 crores is beyond crazy. This could eat up 100 Adipurush. Why‚Ä¶\n\nStyle over Substance.\n\nMaybe we‚Äôre the in Mythology Gorrelu chesey trend. I‚Äôm all in for movies on Mythology but there should be some story other than the elevations too. You just can‚Äôt pick a God and write an elevation scene to him with chest thumping background score and you got yourself everyone calling it 5/5, masterpiece, what not. Money is always a plus in films these plus hundred cr easily. People fall for the style and forget what the actual substance is. Hope I‚Äôm not judging it too harshly but Prashant and team promoted it like never before film but what an actually saw was a rehashed super hero version of Sri Anjaneyam. There was nothing new that this film‚Ä¶"
