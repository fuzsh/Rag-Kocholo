        "text": "Entrepreneurship is typically associated with freedom, wealth, flexiblity, and other positive and glamourous things. But we rarely hear about the other side of entrepreneurship. After running my firm DBP-Institute for over 12 years, I have seen that entrepreneurship is also about sacrifices, failures, humiliations, isolation, lack of regular income, and ridicules. It required tremendous grit and beliefs in one‚Äôs abilities; in simple words - be thick skinned. Overall, entrepreneurship has both triumphs and tribulations, and only those who are fully prepared to embrace the full spectrum of experiences can truly thrive in this realm. ****** I write, speak, and advise on: üëâ D2A2 (digital, data, analytics, and AI) on business performance. üëâ Entrepreneurship üëâ Authentic Leadership ‚úÖ Connect or Follow me in #LinkedIn.\n\nTill today over 4,500 business, data and IT professionals have taken my data and analytics trainings, and many people have said great things about my trainings.

Today's session was on #datagovernance where I shared the 10 key Data and Analytics laws that guide the process of governing data for deriving meaningful insights. Here are the 10 foundational laws and principles in data analytics. I beleive understanding and applying these 10 laws is crucial for improved performace management from data and insights. These are not MANDATES; they are principles or guidelines to give your a sense of direction. Let me know your thoughts. Did I miss any important data analytics principle or law?\n\nResearch by McKinsey & Company found that companies that deploy DATA PRODUCTS report EBITDA increases of up to 25 percent.
