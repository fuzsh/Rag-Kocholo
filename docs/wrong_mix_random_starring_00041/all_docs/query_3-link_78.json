        "text": "India is on tour in New Zealand in 2002–03.\n\nAfter an impressive display against the West Indies in India and a stellar couple of seasons in domestic cricket, Murali Kartik is in the squad.\n\nHe doesn’t play a single Test. Nor does he play the first-class fixture before the Tests.\n\nAt the end of the Test Matches, the selectors are due to announce the squad for the World Cup, to be held in South Africa later that year. Most people expect Kartik to make the cut, because he has been India’s most impressive white ball spinner in the last couple of months. Plus, he is handy with the bat and good in the field.\n\nKartik is in his hotel room, when he gets a call from Sharda Ugra, a senior cricket journalist, covering the New Zealand tour.\n\n‘Boss-man, I just wanted to give you a heads up. You’re not going to be in the side for the ODI’s against NZ. Nor are they picking you for the World Cup… I just wanted to tell you, so you can mentally prepare yourself and be in control when the news officially comes through’, she says.\n\nKartik is crestfallen. He has been in magnificent form. And he’s done well every time he’s been given an opportunity to bowl. And yet, he is now out in the cold.\n\nKartik finds himself stuck in a hotel room, in a foreign country, on a tour where he is good enough to be in the side, but isn’t picked in the playing XI, for reasons unknown. It’s heartbreaking. And it’s frustrating because there isn’t a damned thing he can do about it.\n\nHe can always work on his craft at practice, of course. But if he isn’t given a chance to play, he can’t ‘seize the day’ or ‘prove his detractors wrong’ or ‘channelize his energy’ or give life to a million other cliches that people like tossing around in times like these — cliches that seem insensitive, bordering on cruel, even, when you consider that this young man has seized every opportunity that has come his way.\n\nHis wife, Shweta suggests that they go out for a meal, and that maybe a walk will help clear his head.\n\nAs the lift doors part at the lobby, Kartik and Shweta find themselves face to face with Saurav Ganguly.\n\n‘Yaar… Dadi… ‘, is all Kartik can bring himself to say.\n\nThe news is not official. No one has told Kartik officially that he has been dropped. But he knows. And everyone else seems to know. And everyone seems to know that he knows.\n\nWelcome to Indian Cricket in 2002–03.\n\nGanguly gives him an empathetic squeeze on his shoulder and mumbles ‘Kya karein yaar…’ or words to that effect and the moment quickly passes.\n\nIt’s 2002–03. Murali Kartik has been dropped from the World Cup squad even though, in recent times, he’s been a better white ball bowler than Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh.\n\n………………………\n\nI first spoke to Murali Kartik a couple of years ago, when I was writing a piece on his teammate, Kulamani Parida.\n\nParida was Kartik’s teammate for almost fifteen years and played his last match under Kartik’s captaincy in 2010. Unfortunately for Parida, the circumstances of his exit from the game were less than pleasant — the legality of his bowling action was called into question by the authorities. And this was after Parida had been playing professional cricket for the best part of two decades. It wasn’t as if the rules had changed. Nor was it as if Parida’s action had changed. It felt like he was the victim of a random witch-hunt.\n\nWhen he was forced to quit in 2010, it just felt…unfair… And this whole business of how much ‘flex’ was acceptable in the bowler’s arm — and the rather more bothersome question of how it was perceived — was so arbitrary. And it felt like Parida had gotten a raw deal, for no fault of his.\n\n‘Don’t you think the idea of an ‘acceptable’ extent of flex is arbitrary? And Unfair?’, I ask Kartik, during the course of our conversation about bowling actions.\n\n‘What do you mean?’\n\n‘Like a 16-degree flex is unacceptable…but a 14-degree flex is acceptable… What’s the logic?’\n\n‘Well… we don’t have just two stumps, nor do we have four…three is an arbitrary number. And yet, we accept that three stumps, for whatever reason, is the way to go, don’t we? All the laws of the game are arbitrary, if you think about it that way’, he retorts.\n\nI am in the presence of a logician. I must think carefully about how I phrase my question.\n\n‘What’s the philosophical justification for controlling the allowable ‘flex in a bowler’s arm? What principle of justice is violated when a bowler flexes his arm?’\n\nHe pauses for a minute to give me a considered reply.\n\n‘The balance shifts in favour of the bowler. Think of levers. The wrist is a lever…and so is the shoulder… the ‘whip’ effect of these levers compound when they work together. Now imagine a third lever, at the elbow, which compounds this even more… the bowler could bowl faster, or spin the ball far more — vicious, insane turn. And a batter wouldn’t be able to read it at all, because the effective arm speed with three compounded levers, makes it impossible for a batter to pick what’s going on. The balance of the game would be gone forever. Batting would become a lottery, more chance than skill…’\n\nHe could’ve been a scientist. Or an engineer. Or a philosopher, discussing cause and effect, with cold logic.\n\n‘So, you are saying that Parida’s action was flawed?’\n\n‘Absolutely not. You asked me why an illegal action was dangerous. I told you why. That has nothing to do with Kulamani Parida. Parida’s case was different. His action was legal. I’ve studied it from different angles…and I’m convinced, to this day, that it was absolutely fine. It just looked unorthodox. And that’s where he ran into trouble.’\n\nHe’s right. The question of the legality of Parida’s action was separate from the more fundamental question of whether legality itself mattered.\n\nHe could be a lawyer, cutting through the clutter with a sharp, logical mind.\n\nWe get into a discussion on the mechanics of spin bowling. On what it takes to bowl a ‘legal’ delivery. And how bowling works. And when he speaks, there isn’t a single lazy cliché about ‘artistry’ or ‘wizardry’ or anything like that. It’s all broken down to cause and effect, action and reaction. It is a discourse on the craft of spin bowling that only an expert craftsman himself could give you. There are no frills, no pointless intellectualism.\n\nHe is a rocket scientist, telling me about how a rocket works. About what it takes to reach Escape velocity. About how every element on the rocket must be questioned ruthlessly on the payoff between its utility and its weight.\n\nHe then talks specifically about the dynamics of Parida’s action, about a slightly bent arm that never straightened. And a whippy wrist rotation at the time of release that gave Parida the bite and venom that made him successful.\n\n‘So how come Parida’s action came under scrutiny after all those years?’, I ask.\n\nHe pauses for a minute. I feel the mood shift.\n\n‘What happened to him was really, really sad. Really unfortunate’\n\nHis voice is heavy with emotion, softer, more reflective… and full of sadness. The cold logician, the scientist, and the engineer are taking a break. The man talking to me now is a friend, a teammate and a brother.\n\nI don’t say anything. He goes on.\n\n‘It was such an emotional time. I remember pleading with the umpire. I remember a few tears being shed in the dressing room… How can I even begin to explain what it was like when a teammate of fifteen years was cut off from the game like that….’\n\n…………………………….\n\nThe Parida piece is done. Kartik and I stay in touch even afterwards, through the odd text.\n\nI’m curious to learn more about spin bowling — partly because I’m something of a cricket nerd myself, but also because I haven’t heard anyone deconstruct it like Kartik does.\n\nI send him a clip of a young finger-spinner, bowling in the Country Championship in England. ‘What do you think?’, I ask.\n\nI expect a critique of the bowler’s load-up, his wrist position, or maybe his final delivery stride.\n\nInstead, Kartik draws my attention to something I’ve never noticed until then.\n\n‘Look at where his bowling arm finishes in his follow through. It finishes, bent at his midriff. That bowling arm is like the string that spins a top. Theres a lovely picture in Dilip Doshi’s book. He has just delivered the ball, and his bowling arm finishes down by his knees, almost like a fast bowler. When that arm whips all the way in front of your body and ends at your knee, your bowling arm is aiding in all the twisting and pivoting. That’s when you will get all those things that people go ga-ga for — spin, dip, bounce…’\n\nSo, if he noticed a young spinner with a flawed action, would he go up to him with a suggestion?\n\n‘Not unless he asked me for my opinion. One of the first things that Sunny bhai and Kapil Dev told me when I started commentary was, not to give well-intentioned unsolicited advice. If they come to you, give them your feedback. But never otherwise. It’s good advice. I’ve always tried to follow it.’\n\nI’m also curious to know of what he thinks of statistical ‘matchups’ — a relatively modern trend where captains make tactical bowling changes based on past statistical data. This has resulted in captains bringing on spinners who take the ball away from the batter as opposed to those who bring it in. And so, because past data suggests that there are lower chances of success when you bowl a left arm spinner against a left hander, you don’t bring on a left arm spinner when a left hander is at the crease.\n\n‘I’m not every left arm spinner. I’m Kartik. And I’m not bowling to the average of all left handers. I’m bowling to a specific left-hander. The way I’d bowl to Justin Langer is very different to the way I’d bowl to Chris Gayle.’\n\nBut did he ever think he had a lesser chance of dismissing a left hander?\n\n‘Never. I always backed myself to get the batter out. Because I could give it a rip. And a spinner who turns the ball can trouble any batter. I’ve actually enjoyed quite a bit of success against lefties — Katich, Langer, Lehmann…Gilchrist has only ever scored one boundary off my bowling…And in ’02, when Chris Gayle was smashing everyone everywhere, I was one of the few bowlers who kept him quiet. I made sure he couldn’t line me up. Because I made sure I spun the odd one hard, and mixed up my lengths, speeds, trajectories and angles’\n\nGayle feasted on left arm spinners, all through his career. The idea of bowling a slow left arm spinner at him feels like dangling a juicy piece of meat in front of a ravenously hungry, savage tiger.\n\nI looked it up.\n\nIn that series in ’02, Chris Gayle scored almost 500 runs at an average of 65 — outscoring every other batter, both sides combined. Anil Kumble conceded 6.23 runs an over. Harbhajan was slightly better at 5.4 runs an over — but then he was taking the ball away from Gayle. Kartik? 4.8 runs an over. Bowling to the scariest slayer of left arm spin, in prime form.\n\nKartik was right. Of course, he was.\n\n‘It’s not even about me or Gayle. It’s the idea that because enough left handers have smashed enough left arm spinners, somehow, it makes less sense to bowl a left arm spinner to a left hander. The idea that I am doomed to fail is so oppressive. I’m not the average of everyone else. I’m me.’\n\nAgain, he is right.\n\n………………..\n\nI’m in conversation with Vijay Lokapally.\n\nIt feels surreal even saying that out loud, because for the best part of my childhood and my adolescence, I would wait eagerly to read a thousand Lokapally words in The Hindu, previewing a Test Match with his customary thoroughness, before rushing off to school. And his words would dance before my eyes, pushing the blackboard into a hazy background, distracting me from the Pythagoras Theorem, Benzene rings, vector diagrams or anything else that dared to interfere with my mindspace on the first day of a test match.\n\nI have to pinch myself, to remind myself that I’m actually speaking to a man who has, over the years, fed my love for the game, like no one else. I’ve read more words by Vijay Lokapally than I have of any other writer on the planet. I feel like I know him already.\n\nI ask him about Murali Kartik.\n\n‘I’ve known Kartik for so many years now. It was actually Bishan Singh Bedi who first told me about this young boy, playing Under-19s who bowled with a lovely loop. Bedi Sir always had a great eye for talent. And he had very high standards. So, if he told you someone was good, you immediately took notice.’\n\nI suddenly realise that a veteran scribe talking to an all-time legend of the game, looking for insights on which young cricketer to keep an eye out for, says as much about the sincerity and the work ethic of the scribe as it does about the young cricketer.\n\n‘Kartik was such an interesting cricketer. It didn’t matter whether he was playing Under-19s or Ranji cricket…or even when he played for India…When he had the ball in his hand, he wanted to be in control. He would set his own field. He would be geeing his fielders up, pushing his team in the quest for a wicket, always finding a way to attack… He wasn’t one of those bowlers who would quietly get through an over before you realized it…’\n\n‘The Railways used to play almost all their home games at The Karnail Singh Stadium in Delhi. And I used to love covering their games. It was such an intimate experience, because from where the press were seated, you could hear almost every word being spoken by the players out in the middle. It was one of those grounds where you didn’t need a stump mike. And Kartik, with the ball in his hand, especially if he was in rhythm, could be an absolute terror for the batter. He was relentless….and aggressive….and was in the batter’s face, all day long….’\n\nWhat was he like off the field?\n\n‘Very different, once he was off the field. He was always extremely respectful. Extremely polite. And intellectually curious. He would always be reading something new and would be itching to talk about it with you.’\n\n‘There’s never any bullshit with Kartik. There have been times when he had taken a bunch of wickets, and when asked about it, he would always be candid about not having been at his best. And, on the flip side, there have been occasions where he bowled very well with no wickets to show for it, and he wouldn’t be shy about telling us that he had bowled well.’\n\n‘In that sense, he was remarkably mature. He would never judge himself by outcomes. He would only judge himself by whether he was getting the ball to do what he wanted it to do. And if he felt he wasn’t bowling well — irrespective of whether or not he was taking wickets — he would work on getting better… and that maturity held him in such good stead. It helped him improve as bowler, progressively.’\n\nWho were his best friends in the game? Whom did he enjoy hanging out with?\n\n‘You know, cricket is such a competitive sport… and a lot of cricketers choose friendships strategically. I don’t judge them because I understand how hard it is to get ahead….’\n\n‘But with Kartik, there are no transactions, no strings attached to his friendships. He will be your friend if he enjoys your company, or if you have been good to him. Not because you are famous or well connected. And when he is your friend, he is loyal. He will never let you down. And he will go the extra mile.’\n\n‘He would hang out with his Railways teammates at Rishi Vaishno Dhaba, or some other restaurant, near the stadium. I’ve noticed over the years, that whenever possible, he prefers to eat only around those he is most comfortable with, because he enjoys his food and doesn’t want uncomfortable company to detract from the simple pleasure of a good meal.’\n\nI was immediately reminded of something Parida once told me… of how Kartik may have just dismissed Ponting, or Kallis or Inzamam a few days before, but when they were at the Dhaba together, he never felt like he was sharing a meal with a big-shot international star.\n\n‘When he was with us, he was always Kartik, the guy I had roomed with, the slightly senti guy who loved his food’, Parida had said.\n\nI thought of how I first got in touch with Kartik myself. Of how generous he was with his time, because he wanted me to tell the story of his friend. I thought of Kartik, begging the umpire on behalf of Parida, pleading his friend’s case as though it was his own.\n\nWhat could he have possibly stood to gain? Why did he do it?\n\n……………………….\n\n‘You are known to be this aggressive, hyper confident, combative guy… Is that who you think you are?’\n\nKartik allows himself a slight chuckle. I’ve caught him in a reflective mood.\n\n‘You probably wouldn’t think it, if you saw me play…but that’s not who I am…. That’s who I turn into when I’m on the field…’\n\n‘I’ve actually never been over-confident. Quite the contrary, in fact. I’ve always been acutely aware of my shortcomings. I’ve always felt like I wasn’t good enough. I found out later that this is called ‘The Imposter Syndrome’…’\n\n‘There have been times when I’ve been in awe of some of the ‘net bowlers that would show up for a practice session. I am an India cricketer myself, and there would be a kid who is 19–20, who hasn’t played a single first-class match yet, but if I saw him doing something interesting, something impressive, I would be in awe…’\n\n‘And that’s not a bad thing, in a way. It keeps you humble. The only thing that matters — is not your name, or your record, or how big a star you are — it’s what you can do with a ball in your hand. And that’s the beautiful thing about cricket. A net bowler can deceive a batter who has scored thousands of Test runs. Because the only thing that matters, is what he does with the ball.’\n\nSo, what happens to him when he is on the field? How does his persona change?\n\n‘It’s hard to explain. Maybe, somewhere within me is an idea that even if I am not good enough, I will give it my all, that I will fight every inch of the way…But I also think that there is something about the contest that brings out combativeness.’\n\nA memory pops into my head, of Kartik batting in his debut test against a South African attack comprised of Donald, Pollock, Klusener and Kallis. He is the last man dismissed for 14 hard-earned runs. During his stay at the crease, he is sledged, bounced and hit on the body. But he doesn’t take a backward step. Nor is he shy of retorting, of fighting fire with fire.\n\nThe contest does bring out combativeness.\n\n……………………….\n\nI’m in conversation with Sharda Ugra, one of my favourite writers. Again, this is a ‘pinch myself to make sure that this is real’ sort of moment.\n\nI ask her about Murali Kartik. And specifically, the tour to New Zealand in ’02–03.\n\nWhy did she call him and give him a heads up?\n\n‘Arrey …Kartik and I are good friends. Weve known each other from his Under-19 days. I was a junior reporter back then. We would bump into each other on the circuit all the time and struck up a rapport…and became great friends. I would call him ‘Mr Boss-man’…and he would call me ‘Ms Bal Saaf’… It was a warm friendship, based on mutual respect and trust. And so, I felt very bad for him when I heard the news and wanted to give him a heads up, so he had the chance to prepare himself for the moment when he was actually told about it, officially.’\n\n‘I felt really bad for him …and for VVS Laxman, who was also dropped for the World Cup.’\n\n‘But, you know, as a reporter, I’ve always enjoyed talking to Kartik about the game. I’ve met very few cricketers who were as devoted to their craft. He is always happiest when he is talking about bowling.’\n\n‘I remember one time, during the Sydney Test of 2004, when India was straining to score quickly, declare and bowl Australia out to wrap up what could have been a rare series victory, I bumped into Kartik in the hotel lobby, after the fourth day’s play. I asked him how the ball was coming out of his hand.’\n\n‘I’ll never forget his response. “Don’t be such a journalist ya Sharda”, he said. We both laughed and spoke of other things. But by that stage we were just two good friends — one of whom happened to be a cricketer, and the other, who happened to be a journalist.’\n\n‘What I loved about Kartik was his honesty. His bluntness. And his loyalty. And we both shared a similar allergy to bullshit.’\n\n………………..\n\nI’m back in conversation with Kartik.\n\n‘When would you say you were at your peak?’, I ask.\n\n‘This is how fans and journalists think about the game… in terms of peaks and troughs…The truth is slightly more complicated… the truth is you have good days and bad ones. And you have days when things go your way, and days where nothing works out. When you have a series of days where things go your way, people start talking about ‘peaks’… And when results don’t go your way, they say you are ‘out of form’… Anyone who has played professional cricket will tell you that this is flawed…’\n\n‘If the ball is coming out of my hand perfectly; if my rhythm and energy at the crease is good, then I am in form. Wickets have nothing to do with it. So, when people look for peaks and troughs, they are trying to force a storyline upon a certain distribution of luck.’\n\nThe logician is back.\n\nI decide to probe him further.\n\n‘So, are you saying the Wankhede Test against Australia in 2004 wasn’t your best ever performance?’\n\nMurali Kartik played 8 tests for India. He was awarded the ‘Man of the Match’ in one of those 8 tests. The Wankhede Test against Australia, in 2004 was a memorable low-scoring game that India won. Kartik himself took 7 wickets (4–44 and 3–32), playing a massive role in India’s only victory in that series, against the best team in the world.\n\nIf it had been me, I would’ve tattooed those figures on my chest. For sure.\n\nI can’t wait to hear what he has to say, almost twenty years later.\n\n‘Hmmm… Wankhede was ok. Good game. Good fun.’\n\n‘OK’…’Good Game. Good fun’ are not phrases that I would have used to describe that game.\n\n‘You were Man of the Match…and India won…doesn’t that count for something?’\n\n‘Again, those are outcomes that I have zero control over. Yes, I took wickets. And I bowled ok. But on that surface, Michael Clarke took 6–9 with his part-time left arm spin…No disrespect to him, of course, but what I’m trying to say is that it was much much harder to bat on that surface than it was to bowl on it.’\n\n‘So which performance do you value the most?’\n\n‘Nagpur. The previous game.’\n\nNobody who is involved with Indian Cricket talks too much about the Nagpur Test in 2004, in part, because India was thrashed on a raging seamer, but also because of all the backroom drama that preceded it, with the VCA ignoring directives from the team management and producing a pitch that looked like Australia had imported it from Brisbane. Not to mention the sudden, somewhat controversial withdrawal of Saurav Ganguly and Harbhajan Singh on the morning of the match.\n\n‘Why? India got thrashed in that game…. What about that game was memorable for you?’, I ask.\n\n‘It was a pitch that offered very little assistance to spin… and Australia were going hard at us. And I bowled really, really well, against great batters on a pitch that was offering me nothing. I thought I bowled brilliantly in that game.’\n\nI look up the scorecard. Australia won by 342 runs. Kartik took 5 wickets in the match. Anil Kumble took 3. Shane Warne took 4.\n\nMurali Kartik took more wickets than Anil Kumble and Shane Warne, bowling on the same unhelpful surface.\n\nNot quite as sexy a tattoo as ‘4–44, 3–32, Man of the Match, Wankhede, 2004’… but in another sense, far more tattoo-worthy.\n\n‘But India didn’t win…’\n\n‘Yeah…Of course, India didn’t win. We got hammered. But that’s not something I can control. If my mental health and my sense of worth is linked to the performance of a cricket team, then I am doomed… because I cannot control the outcome of a cricket match. No one player wins a Test match. You only have contributions. And I contributed in Nagpur. It just so happens that we didn’t win. We weren’t collectively good enough in that game.’\n\n‘Ok. Forget the outcome of the game. If I were to ask you about your most memorable spell of bowling — could be in any game- which one, would you pick?’\n\n‘Kochi. Against Pakistan.’\n\nI go back to do some research. India played a game against Pakistan in Kochi in 2005, but Kartik wasn’t in the team for that game. He did bowl well against Pakistan later in the series though, but not at Kochi. Perhaps he was mistaken?\n\n‘No No… It was in Kochi, and it was against Pakistan…but it wasn’t an international match. It was a Board President’s XI game against Pakistan in ’99’\n\nI look it up. And Kartik is right. He did play that game.\n\n‘The scoreboard says you got two wickets.’\n\n‘Yeah, I remember. Wajahatullah Wasti and Mushtaq Ahmed’\n\n‘So, what’s special about this game? The scoreboard…’\n\n‘The scoreboard doesn’t tell you that Saeed Anwar was dropped at short leg. Or that Inzy edged one through slip. The scoreboard doesn’t tell you that Youhana played and missed four times in an over. Nor does the scoreboard tell you that I bowled 8–9 overs while Moin Khan was batting, and that I didn’t allow the best sweeper in the game the opportunity to play a single sweep shot…So what does the scoreboard say? That I got 2 wickets. Just 2 wickets to show for some excellent bowling. But that’s how it goes, sometimes. But the fact that I only got 2 wickets doesn’t change the fact that that spell was one of my most memorable ones…’\n\nHe’s bowled to some of the best batters in the world. All over the world. And here he is, 24 years later, still talking about a spell in Kochi in 1999. A spell where he dismissed Wasti and Ahmed but could have easily dismissed a few others. The fact that he didn’t, doesn’t take away from the merits of what he did.\n\nI am finally beginning to understand Kartik’s view of the game. And his view of Life.\n\n‘So, you’ve bowled to so many great batters… Hayden, Inzamam, Ponting, Kallis…Who was the hardest to bowl to?’\n\nHe takes his time to consider the question.\n\n‘There were two, actually.’\n\nI wait, with bated breath. Surely one of them had to be Inzamam. Or maybe Kallis?\n\n‘Abhijit Kale….and Subramaniam Badrinath’\n\n‘Not Inzamam ul Haq?’\n\n‘Inzy was a great player. So was Hayden. They were, without doubt, the best batters I came up against in international cricket. But Kale and Badri were harder to dismiss.’\n\n‘But Inzy has played all kinds of bowling. All over the world. So has Hayden.’\n\n‘Yes, but I am not ‘all kinds of bowlers’, no? I am me. And I can only talk about whom I found difficult to dismiss, no?’\n\nIt’s hard to argue with the logic of it.\n\n‘You do realize that it would make for a better, more eyeball-grabbing story if you had picked Inzamam or Ponting or Kallis?’\n\n‘Yes, I get it. They are big names. And great players. But as a slow left arm spinner who bowled to all of them, I can safely say that the hardest batters I’ve bowled to were Kale and Badri. And I mean no disrespect to Inzy, Hayden, Ponting and Kallis.’\n\n‘What made Kale and Badri so special?’\n\n‘They always got into such good positions. A lot of batters over-stretch and play alongside their pad. Kale and Badri never over-stretched the front leg. They would take a decent stride forward, but never over-stretch. They could reach further forward with their arms and play in front of their pad, as opposed to playing alongside it. Lovely head positions. And they had superb hands. Azhar was much the same. And so were Tendulkar and Dravid.’\n\n‘I thought you were supposed to get to the pitch of the ball with your foot…’\n\n‘It’s actually more important to get your head over the ball while you play it, especially if you’re playing on dry pitches in India. If you over stretch, you could get into a tangle. Batters sometimes worry too much about where their feet are. And not enough about their arms…and their head. Badri & Kale were superb. And their concentration at the crease was something else. If they got ‘in’ it was almost impossible to dislodge them.’\n\n‘Sometimes, Badri would advance down the wicket at me, and for a fleeting second I’d think ‘Aha…Ive beaten him in the flight, here’…but he would make a quick hand adjustment and chip me away for a single. Even when you felt like you had beaten him, he would find ways to adjust. And it was the same with Kale too. Very very hard to bowl to, because they would chip you and get off strike.’\n\nThere’s a particular kind of ‘showing-off’ that cricketers love indulging in.\n\nAnd when I say ‘cricketers’ of course, I do mean almost all cricketers — right from those who smash rubber-ball bouncers for six on Sunday evening at Somasundaram ground, to those who take guard against Pat Cummins on Boxing Day.\n\nCricketers love telling stories about the most famous cricketers they’ve played with or against…or even watched or spoken to. It’s perhaps the reason why Tendulkar puts up a picture on social media when he bumps into Brian Lara. And vice versa…And maybe, that’s the reason why Sunil Gavaskar tells the story of Viv Richards chirping from second slip when Sunny walked out to bat at 0/2. Would he have told the story as many times if it was the West Indies’ Twelfth Man who chirped him, as opposed to The Greatest Cricketer in the World? I don’t know.\n\nBut I do know that big names make for memorable stories.\n\nIt’s a sort of ‘flex’, a subtle way of showing off, while paying tribute to the awesomeness of the big-name cricketer.\n\nEvery cricketer I’ve ever spoken to has told me tales — some truer than others — of how they were thrashed by Tendulkar, or how tough it was to force a false shot from Gavaskar…or how quick Javagal Srinath was, in his prime. Some have shown me scars with pride — ‘see, that’s where Kapil hit me…no helmets in those days of course’ — while others make pointed references to newspaper articles or records that link them with a demigod — ‘If you look up the scoreboard, you can see that Matt Hayden smashed me for 40 runs in four overs when he played a practice game against us’…. Or even some physical evidence of prowess — ‘Theres the window that MS Dhoni broke when he was batting in a school match.’\n\nIt’s a weird sort of ‘flex’. It’s not a boast of success or greatness at all — It’s more a boast of proximity to greatness, of adjacence to incandescence.\n\nAnd, as I was saying, almost every cricketer I’ve met or spoken to, does this in some form or another.\n\nAlmost every cricketer. There are some exceptions.\n\nLike Murali Kartik.\n\n‘There are lots of people who invoke big names to make a story more interesting. I can’t bring myself to do that. The truth is so much more interesting…and so much more valuable than a lazy lie…’\n\nHe pauses for a moment before going on.\n\n‘I remember this so clearly. There was a Delhi Cricketer — who hadn’t yet been picked to play for India at that stage — who was feeling low and dispirited because he felt as though his scores weren’t being noticed by the National selectors. I remember having a long chat with him in the parking lot at Karnail Singh Stadium. I explained to him that it wasn’t just about centuries or even averages, but that he had to score tough runs in adverse conditions, and big double hundreds in games where batting wasn’t difficult. A 70 at Lahli or Rohtak mattered more to the Selectors than a century at the Kotla. I spoke to him about the importance of staying switched on, of not losing patience while batting on flat decks. And the importance of a tight defense. We must’ve spoken about batting, about cricket and about life for an hour, at least. He was so grateful to me at the end of our chat.’\n\n‘A few weeks later, I found a story on the sports pages of the newspaper, where this player spoke about all the things that I counselled him on. In the story, he was effusive in his gratitude for the advice. Except, he didn’t attribute any of it to me. He attributed every word of advice I gave him to Rahul Dravid, instead….’\n\n‘What?’\n\n‘Yeah…true story. I mean, I get it. It’s a much better story and gathers more eyeballs if he says, ‘Dravid advised me’ as opposed to ‘Murali Kartik advised me’. The former gets the story into the papers. And maybe, wins him a few brownie points. The latter is a non-story. It just so happens to be the truth.’\n\n‘And sadly, people are more obsessed with what makes for a good story. As opposed to what actually happened. And when you call people out on it, you get branded a ‘troublemaker’, or ‘arrogant’ or any number of other things…. My biggest problem was that I couldn’t stand the idea of facts being ignored or bent to suit a narrative.’\n\n‘It’s like your previous question, no? It makes for a sexier story if I say that Inzamam was the best player I ever came up against. And no-one would have a problem with me saying it. Except that it isn’t true. It was harder, in some ways, to bowl to Badri. And I can’t live with myself if I go along with a lie just because it makes for a better story than the truth.’\n\n…………………\n\nAs I write this, my eight-year-old son waltzes into the room\n\n‘What are you writing, Appa?’\n\n‘A piece about Murali Kartik’, I answer, in that vacant tone that pre-occupied parents use when they are multitasking.\n\n‘Who is Murali Kartik?’, he asks — an innocent, straightforward question, but like many of his innocent, straightforward questions, this one leads me deep into rabbit holes of thought.\n\nWho is Murali Kartik?\n\nThe Man of the Match at Wankhede? The logician? The philosopher? Team-man? Parida’s defender? The best left arm spinner in the country? The man who went toe-to-toe against South Africa’s scariest? A bowler who never stopped thinking about bowling even after he retired? Badrinath’s biggest fan?\n\nWho is he?\n\nMaybe, he is a bit of everything… and more.\n\nBut he is, above all else, a thinker, a man who values the truth. And a man, who values what you can do with the ball in your hand, above all else, even if you are just a net-bowler."
