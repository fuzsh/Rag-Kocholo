He then joined the product design department of a leading US-based e-learning company called Emantras, in Chennai. During this period, he successfully designed a variety of electrical, electronic and\n\nlighting products for Indian, Australian and American clients. He also dabbled with game ideation and concept art for educational apps developed by Emantras.\n\nHis desire to work with eminent designers and for reputed clients took him to Studio ABD in Bangalore and thereafter to Future Factory in Mumbai.
