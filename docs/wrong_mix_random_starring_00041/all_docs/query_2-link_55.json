        "text": "ISM has been nothing short of a phenomenal experience and I've garnered so much knowledge in finance over the course of the year. Being in this program has been nothing short of a pleasure and it's a part of my high school career that I will forever cherish moving on. ISM itself culminated last Friday with our Final Presentation Night where we were all given the opportunity to present a year's worth of hard work and sweat and tears. FPN was something that I was initially very nervous about but following the event, I came to realize how fun and educational the event was. That being said, I really want to take the time to reflect upon my ISM journey as a whole while covering some key points.\n\nI want to start by covering both the high and low points of the year, respectively. In terms of high points, there were countless occurrences during ISM that I now look back upon with fondly. One such memory was actually the first day of ISM. I had heard horror stories about sleepless nights and the ever continuing-but fruitless- search for a mentor and needless to say, was very nervous about my decision to enroll in this class. During the summer, Mrs. Brittain had actually emailed us directions for an opening speech of sorts which I had actually spent the two weeks leading to the opening of school practicing. So my nervousness regarding ISM was worsened by the fact that I had to present a fully memorized speech. Despite these aforementioned feelings of negativity, I went to fourth period ISM with a relatively open mind. I actually ended up getting called first to present my speech which was essentially about who I was and what field I was studying and my motivations for doing so etc. For some reason, something clicked during my speech and I was able to present everything in a really fluid manner. My peers were very accepting and Mrs. Brittain was smiling throughout the speech. I felt very reassured and kept on going. As I opened up to my peers in ISM, I began to feel more open and comfortable around them. Sure ISM was going to be a stressful class, that much was ensured and inevitable. But just because the class would be stressful wasn't adequate reason to ruin the entire journey and the process of discovering myself. ISM is after all, about discovering oneself. And so from that day on, I began to regard ISM in a positive, optimistic light. Other highlights of the year include meeting Mr. Vawter, our new ISM teacher who came in later during the year when Mrs. Brittain left. Getting to know someone new and make new connections was a fantastic experience.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, there were lows when I was overwhelmed with work and finding a mentor. The biggest low of the year came when I had almost secured a mentor who worked with investments in Dallas but the mentor ship fell through in the last minute because of confidentiality agreements. I kept an optimistic mindset and I eventually met my current mentor, Mr. Kaufman. The big idea is to stay positive and keep networking!\n\nAnother area I want to address is advice for incoming students because ISM is a popular program in my school district. My advice is to stay positive, punctual, and persistent (or 3 P’s if you will!). ISM program is an good representation of life after high school. Life will throw challenges your way and nothing will ever go perfectly. The proper mentality is to keep strong and keep working. By doing so, you will be able to adapt to the rapid pace of ISM/\n\nThe last area I want to cover is how I could have bettered my FPN presentation. I personally feel like I nailed the actual content and the presentation as I was very passionate and I possess good speaking and presentational skills. However, I was lacking in the aesthetic department as I didn’t decorate my room enough and I felt like I could have had a wider variety of refreshments. After all, the actual content is great but the manner in which you present it is also imperative!\n\nAll in all, it's been real and I’ve loved every second of it, through the thick and thin! I hope this journey has benefited you and I thank you for tagging along!\n\n​\n\nOne issue that I tend to have in school is my intense focus on grades. There are times in my life when I define success on an entirely quantitative measure. Unfortunately, I tend to let this orientation define me at times. And my overwhelmingly apparent focus on grades can sometimes affect me in a detriment manner, with regard to my peers and even my teachers. After all, no one likes to be around a person who's no fun! But all these occurrences make ISM even more unique because it's one of the few classes where I (for the most part) focus on learning for the sake of learning as opposed to simply trying to make a specific grade. There is no special secret however. I simply want to learn for the sake of bettering my future while enjoying the ISM experience with my peers. Sure, ISM is known as that one class that requires a great deal of effort but the material is especially interesting for me. After all, each and every student is given the opportunity to pick their own area of research and corporate finance is very intriguing for me. This desire to learn for the knowledge itself is a very powerful motivator. After all, I'm confident that the information I learn in ISM will stay with me for life and this spurs me to work on into the night. I hope that you too can learn for the sake of learning because any kind of success will be a given at that point.\n\nStepping back and assessing your persona can be an enrichening process. Currently, when I take a step back and analyze myself, I feel like my greatest attribute is my dedication to detail and willingness to put in hard work. What I lack in natural intelligence, I am more than willing to make up for with my sheer perseverance. That being said, I feel like my worst attribute is my perfectionism as it can make me appear very self-centered and arrogant at times. Being more laid back is something I need to work on. In terms of the future, I envision myself going to a reputed four year university before pursuing my MBA so that I can have a respected job. This will be the platform for me to pursue other interests while having a career and stable life. My final presentation ties into this as it will be the culmination of my hard work in the ISM program and it will aid me in assessing whether finance is the career for me. This in turn will influence which college and subsequent career I would pursue. So, final presentation night will essentially allow me to share my work with friends and family while also allowing me to reflect on my success and passion for finance after a year of research.\n\nOne prevalent issue throughout my life has been my consuming devotion to my work. Even though I'm only in high school, I've found myself sacrificing many aspects of my life with so as to better the qualify of my life. And yet, the more I've done this, the more my perfectionist tendencies have been accentuated. In short, I am at the point where I measure myself with regard to how successful I am in school. To that end, this week in ISM, we were asked to reach out to friends and see if we had made a positive impression in their lives. The intent being to ascertain whether we were of value to other people. I reached out via text message to several close friends and asked them this question. Despite their surprise as to why I was asking this question, many of them responded saying that I indeed did have a positive impact on their life. They tended to cite my work ethic as being motivational to them in their own studies. More importantly, though, I had arrived at the conclusion that I clearly had a positive impact on other people! Clearly, my achievements supersede quantitative success in the form of school work and can now be measured qualitatively in the form of friendship. This is phenomenal because it reduced my excessive devotion to schoolwork because clearly my life has affected people I care for in a positive manner! I shouldn't be as insecure about my grades because other people value me for something else. I should focus on both of these aspects of my life but to say that others' perception of me depends solely on my school work would be fallacious. I hope you too can embrace this view with regards to yourself!\n\nGoing into this final segment of the year, I have been tasked with completing my ISM Final Product in a rather short amount of time. I intend to pursue an ebook so that my final product can enlighten others about the field of corporate finance. After taking into account my knowledge on finance as well as my time limit, my mentor, ISM teacher, and I decided that a range of 15-20 pages would be ideal. And yet, as I work, I find myself even more hard pressed for time and I often consider shortening the length to below 15 pages. With that being said, I don't intend to let my lack of time and day to day activities get in the way of my final product. My primary goal for ISM is to create an ebook that is at the very least 15 pages that also contains a lot of useful information presented in a coherent, easy to understand manner. I want to make a book that tells an overarching story while presenting financial concepts in an easy to comprehend manner. Then other people, particularly my target audience of young adults-would enjoy reading my work. This would simultaneously enlighten me as I'd gain a great deal of knowledge from writing it while my audience would be enlightened about concepts that they didn't previously know. That would make my ISM journey especially special and is my primary goal. I want my quality of work to be consistent throughout the year I won't fall on the final hurdle. That being said, my plan B would be the aforementioned idea of shortening the length but then the content would be too summarized and I hope that this doesn't occur. This plan of action would be painful as my quality of work has been so high throughout the year and I want to have consistency. Taking all this into account, I plan to efficiently work so that my work can be submitted punctiliously and preserve my consistency and the positive impressions others may have about my work. That is why succumbing to stress and following a backup plan is not an option. I hope you can implement your primary goals instead of relying overly on backup plans that detract from efficiency."
