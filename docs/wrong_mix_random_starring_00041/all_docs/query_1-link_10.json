        "text": "Great fun to share a little bit of what we do on Cloud Management at Google at JSSPP'2024. https://lnkd.in/giW7-hnF Thanks to Dalibor Klusáček, Gonzalo P. Rodrigo Álvarez, Julita Corbalán for the invite. Coming back to JSSPP feels like going back home. It was fantastic to see so many old friends.\n\nBack at Google, I gave a tech talk called “How to be a Uber Tech Lead” about running large programs. Over time, it became the first thing I shared with anybody asking me for leadership advice. Since I no longer work at Google and no longer have access to the recording, I decided to create a Google-agnostic version for anybody to learn from. Hopefully, this helps some of you the next time you find yourself wrangling a messy horizontal project."
