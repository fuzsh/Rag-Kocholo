        "text": "News:\n\n16-03-2008:\n\nWhile essential guitaris is off line, I've republished my interviews for essentialguitarist.com\n\nPrashant Aswani interviewed by Laurie Monk February 2007\n\nGuitar virtuoso Prashant Aswani, is a guitar force to be reckoned with. His tone, groove and have turned heads on the global stage, whether slugging it out in the studio or performing passionately live, Prashant's guitar voice is original and one of a kind. Prashant and EG discuss the ins and outs of his career to date using the latest in web 2.0 collaboration software...google docs.\n\nEG: Hi Prashant...I hope you like this method of interview, it's kind of different...but interesting\n\nPrashant Aswani: It is great for the reader because the proper amount of thought can be placed into each answer. This allows more depth to be shared and communicated.\n\nEG: OK, on to the more important subject of guitar...I get a sense that your exposure to Indian music at an early age has added another dimension to your playing. Did you study concepts like the ragas and the seven swaras in Karnatic music and does this influence today?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Yes, Indian music of all types influenced me from the start. I studied tabla for about 5 years. I studied different taals and rhythmic permutations. I also learned to sing Tabla rhythms. My learning at that point was strictly about rhythmic control and timing. Melodic concepts came later on after I started playing the guitar.\n\nEG: I noted that although your Indian music precursor, you were inevitably drawn back in your early teen years to the simpler rhythms of rock with bands like AC/DC. Was your father happy to buy a guitar to play this sort of music?\n\nPrashant Aswani: When I first got \"Back in Black\", I asked my tabla teacher if he could play to it.\n\nEG: Laughs...I have now got this vision of your parents thinking ...\"No...what have we done!\"...Is that what happened?\n\nPrashant Aswani: No, he did it in front of my parents and I saw them enjoying it, so immediately an opening was created. Then my Mom actually brought me a guitar back from India after a summer trip. I couldn't stop playing it from that point forward.\n\nEG: So there was no culture shock...that's cool!\n\nPrashant Aswani: Yes, I think my Dad is very happy with my career choice. In fact he handles most of the management responsibilities. He is very cool!\n\nEG: I know that before your career can start there is a lot of hard work learning the trade. In your case, you say that, for the most part, your self taught. I understand from Paul Gilbert interviews his early learning experiences, that this could wind up being a dead end...for example in Paul's case only using upstrokes. Did you have any strange things like that happen to you or do you think any playing is all good experience and that this just adds to your style?\n\nPrashant Aswani: I did start out via the trial and error method. However, I watched Paul's instructional video and to this day can't even come close to emulating his technical style. So I think playing how you naturally play is the way to go. There really is no right or wrong in my book. What is easy for me can be very difficult for another. For example: I use the fingers on my right hand in conjunction with a pick. This came about from playing the Tabla. Tabla is played with the fingers so it translated to guitar very easily for me.\n\nEG: When you say, I use the fingers on my right hand in conjunction with a pick, is this like a hybrid picking technique?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Yes, I believe that is the term used for this style of picking. I have been told it is similar to country guitar style picking except I use a flat pick rather than a thumb pick. I also use my middle, third and fourth fingers.\n\nEG: I know a lot of players for example up and coming player Lorenzo Venza are using hybrid picking inspired by the likes of Brett Garsed and Shawn Lane. In your case Is that a natural thing then, or is that something you have to consciously work on?\n\nPrashant Aswani: I saw Brett Garsed at a Berklee Clinic and he used a pick and his fingers. After seeing that it was possible I worked on it at first but it really became the natural way that I approach the guitar. Playing with my fingers started at a young age with tabla. This as you probably know is an Indian percussion instrument played with by the fingers and hands.\n\nEG: I know you said self taught but you did take lessons and later went on to attended Berklee. Why did you decide to go to Berklee and not MI?\n\nPrashant Aswani: I took lessons later on and mostly while attending Berklee. I didn't really choose Berklee over MI. It was the only option for me at that time because I wanted to enroll in a Degree program. Also my high school jazz director, Geoff Leonard, graduated from Berklee so I got a recommendation from him. MI has an incredible guitar department. The staff is very accomplished and the Open Counseling system is one I wish I had growing up. Open Counseling is when a teacher has a block of time in a room where students can come and ask questions about anything.\n\nEG: A lot of great players attended Berklee, who did you get lessons from?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Yes. Too many players to count. I studied with Jim Kelley, Jon Finn and many others.\n\nEG: Jon Finn is a very talented player, I have seen of his CD's and some the live band video on YouTube with Don Lappin. Did you get to see Don Lappin and his unusual two handed tapping style?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Yes he is. I never had a chance to check out Don Lappin.\n\nEG: Now your working at MI do you get a feeling that there is a rivalry between Berklee and MI, to attract the highest caliber students?\n\nPrashant Aswani: I don't feel that at all. I think the students welcome the added knowledge from Berklee Alumni that teach there.\n\nEG: I guess you better hope this is the case...or your MI lessons are going to be fun! Laughs...OK, after Berklee, at what point did you think you could make a living out of playing guitar?\n\nPrashant Aswani: I thought I could do it from the day I started. I never had a plan \"B\" and thank God I don't have to.\n\nEG: I wish I could say the same...I think I'm on plan \"F\"...laughs... I note your a big fan of Greg Howe. You also got lessons from him...where you would take an 8 hour bus ride to Greg's studio in Pennsylvania...just for a 4 hour lesson! Was it worth the trip and what sort of things did Greg's lessons bring to your playing?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Those bus rides were very long. I definitely feel that it was worth it. I learned a lot about the album making process. The lessons were very conceptual. Much more so than technical. I am grateful for that opportunity.\n\nEG: After all the hard work you finally released your first CD \"Revelation\" in 1998. I guess those bus rides paid off then as this was produced and engineered by Greg Howe. On the CD you trade solos with Greg Howe on the tracks \"Nevin Terrace\",\"Led Boots\", \"Hiding Under The Covers\" and Uber rocker \"Full Throttle\". Did you record these live with Greg in the studio or were they recorded separately?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Yes the whole album was done together with Greg in his studio with the exception of the tracks I produced.\n\nEG: That my explain the cohesive sound on the album. I was impressed with the CD and It was obvious to me the time that you were talented player with your own guitar voice. With the good reception of the album, was this point you thought you could make a living out of playing guitar?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Thank you! This was actually the point in which I wondered about making a living doing music. Putting out a well received album is just the beginning. One needs to really understand business to make it happen. Promo, concerts, seminars, sessions, and lessons are all a part of making a living and coordinating this is the key.\n\nEG: The business side seems to be quite daunting to new players...They get their guitar trick bag together and then they don't know what to do next. Are there any tips you could give players who are just starting out with their career plans?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Have a goal in mind. Figure out what you want to accomplish and map it out. ie: Do you want to be a recording artist? Do you want to be a side man? Do you want to be a session player? Check out a career path of another artist that is very successful and try to learn from their mistakes.\n\nEG: May be that's where I go wrong then ... You say map it out, what would that entail from your perspective?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Well I didn't really follow my advice because I didn't have access to advice. These are merely my suggestions based on past trials and errors and successes. I don't think there is a wrong way to pursue a career in music due the myriad of options. With that preface, I would definitely suggest learning how to communicate music so you can interact with other musicians. School and lessons are an avenue for this to take place. Additionally School can introduce you to many other styles of music as well as different players to collaborate with.\n\nEG: That's an interesting observation. So post Berklee, you moved to Italy. There seems to a lot of great players in Italy at the moment, was this what drew you to Europe and Italy or was it something else?\n\nPrashant Aswani: There are many great musicians in Italy and in Europe. I went to Italy for a vacation and then pursued some contacts while I was there. I was fortunate to have these contacts materialize into a record deal. That is what kept me there. Also, I love the people in Italy. They are so warm and kind.\n\nEG: Which guitar players did you play with in Italy and Europe?\n\nPrashant Aswani: I played with many of the guys from AXE Guitar magazine. Alessandro Benvenuti and William Stravato to name a couple.\n\nEG: Laughs...I'm more than happy for you to name more! I interested because I wonder why there are so many hot players in Italy, What is it about the Italian environment that is conducive to playing guitar?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Italy for me was a place where I could feel free. The people are so warm and interested in what a foreigner has to say. Conversations happen over incredible meals. It suited me very well as I love to cook and of course eat!\n\nEG: Me too...it sounds great and your making me hungry!...Have you been asked to play on any of the Italian players CD's?\n\nPrashant Aswani: In fact I just finished recording a track for a Bass player named Dino Fiorenza. It was a lot of fun. I have also been featured on Alessandro Benvenuti's album and William Stravato's album.\n\nEG: Alessandro Benvenuti, William Stravato, yes both these guys have released quality albums. William has a real Brett Garsed feel to his playing and Alessandro is super smooth legato. How do you feel about invites to play on others material, is this something you relish, a chance to play over something different perhaps? Is there any sort of music you would draw the line with?\n\nPrashant Aswani: The key word is quality. I very much enjoy collaboration with other artists and do my best to make this a part of my learning process. ie: playing on something challenging other than my own compositions. I also like putting my touch and feel to others music. This way two artists can compliment one another with there diverse styles.\n\nEG: OK...moving on to your trade mark sound, what is your current guitar rig and what equipment could you not live without?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Currently, I play custom ESP Guitars based on an ESP M-II Design. Todd Binder from ESP Guitars makes certain my instruments are in top shape. I do incorporate many of there standard models as well ie: Vintage Plus, Eclipse, and Viper. I also use there semi-hollow body guitar called the X-Tone PA-1. All my guitars are loaded with DiMarzio Pickups. Steve Blucher is helping me really dial in my tone. Right now I am using a \"Humbucker from Hell\" in the neck and a \"Mojo\" in the bridge position. The next stage is my new single Channel Peavey Penta Heads and Cabs. These amps are great because they are made for plugging in and going for it. There is now FX loop and other distractions to take you away from the sound. Dean Markley Signature Series 10-46 Strings and Spectraflex Cables. I use this set-up because it is what suits me best. All this gear mentioned works hand in hand with each other to facilitate my playing. So I cant live without any of it!\n\nEG: Do you keep working on your sound? I know, for instance, that Allan Holdsworth spent many months building his own giant coffin like speaker enclosures to capture a sound he was looking for.\n\nPrashant Aswani: Although my tones are similar, I am doing some kind of tweaks to them. The variables are so huge with woods of guitars to tubes of amps. I think ESP has got it down for me with regards to my guitars. I just started working with DiMarzio. Pickups are the one thing I have neglected. Steve Blucher however is the man that is going to be a big part of these new tweaks I am doing. You will hear the new tone on my new releases.\n\nEG: I'll look forward to hearing the change. OK, after the European jaunt, you went back to America to record \"Duality\". Again you were able to get Greg Howe to produce and engineer the CD, as well as play bass, keyboard and several guitar parts...from a lay mans terms it sounds like you did nothing ...laughs...only joking....Did you plan to record with Greg again or did it just happen that way?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Yes, I did plan to record with Greg on \"Duality\".\n\nEG: I note that Greg's Brother, Al, sang on the CD as well, how did that come about?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Al was simply around and we \"vibed\" so I asked him if he would sing on a track and he obliged. Thank you Al!\n\nEG: After the successful release of you \"Duality\", you got a great break by touring with the highly respected Christina Milian. That must have been an amazing experience. How embedded were you with the band and what sort of growing experiences did you get playing with Christina?\n\nPrashant Aswani: I had a great time Playing with Christina. I was a hired gun for that gig so my job was easy, play guitar as well as I can so that Christina could shine.\n\nEG: So no major solos then? I guess it was the same for the Billboard Music Awards where you played guitar for pop mega star Justin Timberlake! That must have been an amazing gig, How did that come about?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Kevin Antunes (Justin's Music Director) called me to do that gig. That was also a great time. Working on that level is always a pleasure because the professionalism is so high. I am very appreciative for that opportunity.\n\nEG: OK, your current release is called \"Revelation: Fully Loaded\". This is a compilation of your first CD, including the awesome Full Throttle, and some newer tracks. A great CD and highly recommended. Which tracks are you particularly pleased with?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Thank you. I am pleased with the overall outcome. I am very excited about the three new songs that I produced. I am producing a lot more now and I enjoy the creative control.\n\nEG: Yes, its a great sounding CD and the new tracks, like DV8, are cool. You say your producing the material and have creative control. What does this mean for you, are you using home studio tools or do you prefer using professional studio equipment?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Well I record using Pro-Tools. By creative control, I mean the original vision of the project will keep its integrity.\n\nEG: OK, so you have a home recording rig, what does that consist of from a computer point of view?\n\nPrashant Aswani: I use a Mac. Generally a PowerBook G4 Laptop. Sometimes a G5 Desktop. For drums we use the desktop. I also hire an engineer for my recordings. I like having someone who handles the technical aspect while I focus on the production and the performance.\n\nEG: I was talking with Magnus Olsson recently about guitar music in general. To paraphrase Magnus, when it comes to composition, even if you are a fantastic guitar player it does not guarantee that you put together a great song. Also the big majority of people will never care how great your guitar playing is. Would you agree with that and how do you move from being a great guitar player to a great musician?\n\nPrashant Aswani: First off I would like to say that I am always striving to become better; as a guitar player and as a musician. This is a life long process. I am humbled every week when I go to GIT and see guys like Scott Henderson and Dan Gilbert. I think one can be recognized and appreciated as being a great guitar player. Being a great songwriter is a very different thing all together. Many famous pop artists have there songs written for them and still the whole of the media and the world cares about there every move.\n\nEG: In your compositions how do you avoid writing music for people who are looking for something new all the time, bigger kicks, fast playing, scarier licks?\n\nPrashant Aswani: The best way is to write for one's self. I want to hear improvement from song to song. For the most part melodies and rhythms are produced very naturally. I ask myself after the demo is recorded, \"Can I sing this song?\". If I can it is a keeper.\n\nEG: I had not thought of that as a measure, so that would a good rule of thumb for players to adopt in their writing efforts. So I guess you've applied these techniques to the three \"Revelation: Fully Loaded\" tracks and the upcoming CD for 2007, called \"Time\". Can you give us a taster of what can expect musically from this release?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Yes. I also applied them to 17 other songs. Don't forget about the other 9 on \"Revelation: Fully Loaded\" and 8 on \"Duality\". This was a technique I learned early on in my musical journey from some Indian classical singers. My third album will be out later this year. I will be producing the entire album. You should expect a hard hitting aggressive new album. Lots of memorable melodies with grooves that will keep you head bobbing for days.\n\nEG: With the track record of your previous CD's, can we expect any guest appearances on the album?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Possibly, that will just need to be a surprise. Laughs...\n\nEG: Laughs...I thought you would fall into my trap...OK...maybe next time! As you've mentioned, Greg Howe was a big influence on you in the early days. Which other guitar players and more broadly musicians, would you say have influenced you and you would recommend players to listen to extend there musical horizons?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Actually, Greg was more a later influence. I first heard him on the release of \"Uncertain Terms\". Zakir Hussain is at the top of my list with regards to influence. I played tabla from age 8 to about 15. Indian classical ragas were a staple in my household. To name some guitarists, Angus Young, Jason Becker, Randy Rhoads, Vinnie Moore, Pat Metheny, Scott Henderson, John McLaughlin, and Brett Garsed. Also John Coletrane and Steve Coleman were big influences. I recommend listening to all types of music. It is not important how technical or simple. One can learn from any of the legends I have mentioned as well as a host of others.\n\nEG: So what is your preferred flavour of music at this point?\n\nPrashant Aswani: I want to have an experience of some kind. Good or bad, exciting or boring. I am getting that from Indian Movie sound tracks.\n\nEG: Cool, does that mean your a Bollywood fan too?\n\nPrashant Aswani: I enjoy Indian movies. I grew up watching them at home. I understand Hindi so it makes it very easy to get in to. Also the music is joyous and many times spiritually based. The cinematography is amazing.\n\nEG: OK, moving back on to your ethnic styling and its fusion with the rock idiom. The late Shawn Lane, took a similar journey adding a Karnatic feel to his playing. Did you get into Shawn Lanes' playing where he incorporated Karnatic music into his own heady blend of rock playing?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Shawn Lane was amazing! I listened to him almost everyday on the \"Centrifugal Funk\" album along with Brett Garsed and Frank Gambale. That was my introduction to shred fusion.\n\nEG: Laughs...I guess like everyone else you were trying to work how he played those crazy wide interval licks on Hey Tee Bone... talking about speed, I'm often trying to get the message across that speed isn't the only answer. I believe the heart of a players voice comes from their use of vibrato. I noted from your playing style you also make use of the bar to shape your notes, how did you develop your vibrato / bar voice?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Many years of listening and of course years of practice and deliberate use of the bar has facilitated my use. Inflections play a huge role in Indian classical music. I have always tried to incorporate these ideas into my playing. The bar really allows for many different quarter tonalities that are tough to get form a fretted instrument. I love the options that a Floyd Rose brings to the table. Anything can happen.\n\nEG: Apart from regular practice , is there anything you can recommend struggling guitar players who get stuck in a rut?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Buy an album that would not normally be played. For example, if you like guitar music, by a hip-hop album to change your pattern of listening. Ruts are caused by lack of ideas. Ideas can come from many sources. Getting out of the box in which the rut stems is what is important and diversifying my CD collection has helped me out in the past.\n\nEG: So may be stock up on some Dr Dre and Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy...and blow ofver the back beats... Any key albums you would recommend that made a difference to you and your playing?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Of course! Allan Holdsworth - Secrets, Anything from Zakir Hussain, Steve Coleman and the Five Elements - Curves of Life, This is to name a few but there are really too many to list. Pick an album from one of my list of influences.\n\nEG: Wow, that's so cool, I love Secrets. A lot of great tracks, Alan Pasqua gets to dust some great piano on that album. Endomorph is my favourite, great solo and just check out the note at 2.20 from that track! OK...moving back to your current career. I note that your now a private guitar tutor and open counsellor at Musicians Institute in Hollywood...how well does that go down with former Berklee alumni?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Well, many of the instructors at GIT went to Berklee. I think that both schools are great! I know that I am learning a ton from being around guys like Scott Henderson.\n\nEG: So your still on the trail of gathering new techniques and ideas...do you think this will ever end for you?\n\nPrashant Aswani: Music is a life long learning event for me. I chose to be a musician precisely for this very reason. I love the complexity ans the simplicity that makes people laugh and cry. I hope it never ends!\n\nEG: It's difficult to predict the future, but in my recent experience YouTube and the video market has exploded for guitar players, what plans do you have for this market?\n\nPrashant Aswani: YouTube is definitely a big market. I am sure that I will start posting live clips from my concerts and clinics this year.\n\nEG: Well, I 'll look forward to those. What's next for the future of a live Prashant Aswani?\n\nPrashant Aswani: I have a CD release concert with my trio in March. Joey Heredia - drums and Gabe Rosales - Bass. Of course a special concert for the students at GIT in April. This will be a big event as ESP will be giving away a guitar! Many clinics and concerts are being planned and scheduled as we speak. I look forward to these shows. Daniel Adair (Drummer for NickelBack) and Dave Martone and I are releasing a new album. The songs are completed and the tracking has started. Look out for this one hopefully by the end of 2007.\n\nEG: Wow, Joey Heredia! He's a great drummer, and he worked with Scott Henderson and Frank Gambale too. That will be a great show to watch. I do like good drummers too! The Dave Martone CD sounds great too, he's a very interesting player lots of original ideas and sound scapes...good choice! OK, Prashant, thanks for spending the time with this interview. I wish you good luck with your playing and the new CD release \"Time\".\n\nPrashant Aswani: Laurie, Thank you for your time and support. People like you make it possible for us guitarists to continue making a living. You also make it a ton of fun! Peace!\n\nhttp://www.prashantaswani.com/"
