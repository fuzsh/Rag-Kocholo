        "text": "Sister-duo Ranjani-Gayatri, Trichur Brothers Srikrishna Mohan and Ramkumar Mohan, and vocalist Vishakha Hari have pulled out of the Music Academy’s annual conference—which will be presided over by Krishna—while Chitravina N Ravikiran has decided to return the Sangita Kalanidhi title conferred on him in 2017. Ravikiran was accused of sexual harassment by two students in 2018, though he denies the allegations.\n\nThe meltdown of these singers has no greater cause except the ‘cause’ of ‘Brahminism’. In an interview to a news channel, the sister-duo said Brahmins are a soft target, describing the community as “least casteist”. Hari said her “core values” are threatened by the academy’s action of awarding Krishna, who has “engaged in a lot of slandering…hurting the sentiments of many”.\n\nThe victim card that Brahmins are playing by boycotting the conference simply because the academy recognised Krishna’s contributions to the classical music industry reeks of casteist privilege. It’s not the sign of a “least casteist community”. The elite artists can’t stand someone questioning the power structure in the industry they operate in.\n\nAlso read: TM Krishna’s book celebrating Dalit Christian mrdangam makers triggers row in Tamil Nadu\n\nWhy Krishna bothers them\n\nIn his letter to the Music Academy, Ravikiran accused TM Krishna of displaying “no foresight to the economic and collateral damage his actions could cause to the classical industry”. Krishna took Carnatic music to the slums and brought people into the industry who otherwise never would. He sings about Allah in Carnatic style and has made the music truly public, bringing it out of its ivory tower monopoly.\n\n“He has vilified the Carnatic music fraternity that has collectively contributed millions of hours of artistry, hard work and literature,” Rajani and Gayatri wrote.\n\nHighlighting the flaws of one’s own fraternity, which are shaped by years of oppressive caste’s dominance in the field of art, is not villainisation; it is navel gazing. And people like Krishna do it at a huge cost—they’re the ones who end up being targeted by their community and run the risk of coming across as ‘saviours’ for the oppressed while belonging to the oppressor class.\n\nNot only does questioning one’s own fraternity require a great deal of courage, but it also shows integrity. TM Krishna’s articulate critique and a fearless approach of raising issues while enduring backlash over the years is admirable.\n\nIn their reply to the sisters, the Madras Music Academy clarified that Krishna was being honoured for his contribution to music over his long career, “with no extraneous factors influencing our choice”. The academy putting its foot down is a healthy sign for its future.\n\n‘Award wapsi’, otherwise demonised by proponents of the Hindu Right, is a form of protest to question unbridled power. But here, they are questioning the achievements of someone who has consistently questioned power structures. Some of them admitted that Krishna’s talent is unparalleled, but it’s his politics that makes him “unworthy” of the award.\n\nIt’s time Brahmins, fed by centuries of privilege, learn that the cushion of power they have enjoyed—and continue to enjoy—in the art world and other areas won’t carry on for eternity. All forms of power structure come down. This one would as well. Dancers like Nrithya Pillai are here to tip the scales to balance, as are artists KJ Yesudas, P Unnikrishnan, Brinda Manickavasagam, and Neyyattinkara Vasudevan. Pillai is demanding answers for appropriation and Brahminisation of Dalit art and culture.\n\nAs such, the protest against Krishna shows how uncomfortable Brahmins become when a critical lens is turned on them. Industry’s validation of Krishna suggests to them that the ground beneath their feet is shaking. For good reason.\n\nAlso read: Is cancelling TM Krishna’s music concert right of organisers or sign of Hindu intolerance?\n\nAn industry controlled by Brahmins\n\nLike many classical art forms, the Carnatic music industry is also full of Brahmins who act as the gatekeepers. It is a demanding art form, where even the most talented and experienced singers require daily practice, a sharp memory, years of training under exceptional teachers, and of course a natural ear for music. The success rate and the potential to earn good money is limited, a gamble people from unprivileged backgrounds are seldom able to play.\n\nThis is where figures like TM Krishna play a crucial role. Being a Brahmin and fighting against his own does not make Krishna a hero. One could argue writer G Pramod Kumar is fair in criticising Krishna for only stating the problems and never offering any solutions, noting how few Dalits have been able to thrive in the endogamous circles of Carnatic music.\n\nWhat makes Krishna stand out are his contributions towards social reform within the industry, even if he is only saying something no one else would. But he is doing much more. He is democratising music, singing songs in praise of non-Hindu deities, breaking the norm, and challenging the authority.\n\nKrishna has ruffled a lot of feathers in the past. In 2017, he noted how MS Subbulakshmi had left her devadasi roots behind to become an ideal Brahmin woman. This invited widespread criticism from Carnatic musicians. But Krishna has stayed true to his ideals without caring about his celebrity status or influence, even as his concerts got cancelled, not just in India but abroad as well.\n\nViews are personal.\n\n(Edited by Prashant)"
