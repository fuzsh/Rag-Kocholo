        "text": "Nabeel A wrote:\n\nUpwork already getting revenue from freelancers and clients so why include excessive connects expenses.\n\nBecause many freelancers never earn any money and don't contribute anything at all to the running of this website, and probably a lot of them take up customer service time as well. Upwork also has a bunch of programs to educate and coach new freelancers, and that needs to be paid for. So it's fair that everyone who uses Upwork should have to contribute by paying for connects.\n\nAlso, if connects were free, every job post would be spammed even more than it already is. It wouldn't benefit anyone if their proposal was only one out of 100 that a client receives, instead of one out of 50 (which is already bad enough).\n\nI am not against connects as I mentioned in the post but against those that serve nothing. second, if you are talking about just using website alone, it really doesn't cost much but running the upwork team costs alot. Upwork has also found easier solution for that using freelancers for various tasks.\n\nThird, do you really think freelancers, who are not earning/new , will take up customer support time? They usually use community forum and also most don't even know how to connect to support agent and if they do, what would they talk about? Also Upwork can also use filters or automation for questions like 'how to get first job or review my profile/proposal' or they can just redirect such messages to community.\n\nThere are many options for preventing spam like limiting the total proposals for the job or giving client to set that number, preventing users from submitting proposals through automation, limiting proposals sent by a freelancer on monthly or weekly basis, getting clients to have verified payment method along with identity verification before posting job, and many other options.\n\nUpwork academy only has few presentation type or interactive type sliders instead of proper courses.\n\nNabeel A wrote:\n\nI am not against connects as I mentioned in the post but against those that serve nothing. second, if you are talking about just using website alone, it really doesn't cost much but running the upwork team costs alot.

Do you think that clients just magically appear here, or perhaps Upwork has to spend a bit of money attracting them?\n\nNabeel A wrote:\n\nThird, do you really think freelancers, who are not earning/new , will take up customer support time?\n\nThey absolutely do. People who have been here for awhile already know what they're doing and seldom need to contact support. Many new freelancers seem to hardly ever read anything and think they can contact support whenever they have any question about what to do or how things work. They're also the ones who have problems getting paid, linking their bank accounts, verifying their identities, dealing with clients, etc. etc. etc.\n\nNabeel A wrote:\n\nThere are many options for preventing spam like limiting the total proposals for the job or giving client to set that number, preventing users from submitting proposals through automation, limiting proposals sent by a freelancer on monthly or weekly basis, getting clients to have verified payment method along with identity verification before posting job, and many other options.\n\nThose are all very bad ideas.\n\nNabeel A wrote:\n\nUpwork academy only has few presentation type or interactive type sliders instead of proper courses.\n\nWrong again. They're even offering one-on-one coaching now.\n\nPrashant P wrote:\n\nYeah, but in return they have to guarantee that the connect you are spending for a job is REAL. Who knows they themselves might be posting those fake jobs.\n\nCharging for something that doesn't exist is not honest.\n\nAnother tiresome accusation that Upwork posts fake jobs in order to steal your connects. If you really think this, then it's surprising you still use this website.\n\nPrashant P wrote:\n\nAlso, it is easy for us to say it is cost of doing business. Spending 30 cents for a job is no big deal for us, but in many parts of the world like my home country India 30 cents will buy you a cheap lunch from a street hawker!\n\nIt doesn't matter where somebody lives, if they have skills then they can charge much higher rates than they would get at a full-time job in their own country; therefore, it should be no problem paying for connects.\n\nWhy would you want to limit a freelancer's ability to work? I'm not giving up my ability to earn money on the platform. There was a spell earlier this summer when I applied for 21 jobs before I was hired. Of course, most of those never hired anyone, but that is another topic. I was not spamming the clients, I was looking for work.\n\nIt would be great if Upwork could eliminate the instant proposals people submit to any job because the clients wouldn't have to wade through garbage. It would be extremely difficult to establish a program that could tell the difference between a real proposal and a copy-pasted one.\n\nVerified payment means nothing and it is not a guarantee in any way, shape, or form nor does it mean you will get paid. Too many freelancers see \"verified payment\" and stop looking at the client. Verified payment means that three tiny reversible charges were made when the client presented the card number. By the time the freelancer goes to get the money, the bank can shut it down. There is no guarantee except for using the automatic hourly tracker, and that has limitations.\n\nOne of the biggest problems with Upwork is that they have and are continuing to allow anything to set up an account as a freelancer. There are far too many freelancers here, and many have no skills or reason to be here other than to game the system. Most freelancers are never hired and never make a penny. Limiting proposals not only harms the freelancers' ability to earn but it denies Upwork the money from connects, so it won't happen.\n\nFreelancing is nothing like the lottery. There are actions and funding necessary for any business, and freelancing needs to be treated as a business if you want to succeed. What kind of job is there where you just make money? There are always expenses with any job. Connects, the 20/10/5%, are part of running a business.\n\nJeanne H wrote:\n\nWhy would you want to limit a freelancer's ability to work?

For example, I can only earn more if others don't earn. Almost all of things in life don't follow zero-sum game rule. If people joining have no skills and getting the jobs, they would get very bad feedbacks and that's it for them.

Connects, the 20/10/5%, are part of running a business.\n\nThat was whole point for limiting proposals so clients don't get overwhelmed and freelancers don't just keep submitting proposals and waste time & money to win the lottery. It seriously has become a sort of lottery as with more proposals, no one will go through them. Some would have really done work on crafting custom proposals for the job.\n\n\"No one wants to limit anyone and that can save from clients from receiving too much proposals.

If they are not satisfied, more can submitted.\n\nDo you really think by limiting, jobs will decrease in numbers on Upwork or clients won't come anymore with jobs?\"\n\nIt eliminates freelancers who create individual proposals applying for the job. And, you have an even worse problem with garbage proposals.\n\n\"Limiting will also help in making sure everyone only apply to their related fields and think hard before doing it. \"I was not spamming the clients, I was looking for work\" - What do you think others submit proposals for?\"\n\nI know many fake freelancers send their fake proposals immediately. They are trying to cheat clients. They have no interest in becoming a legitimate freelancer.\n\n\"I think you probably see it as a zero sum game.

If people joining have no skills and getting the jobs, they would get very bad feedbacks and that's it for them. I honestly don't understand by what you meant in \"gaming the sysem.\"\n\nI mean those freelancers who steal profiles, lie about their skills, language, pretty much everything, and yes, send those proposals 1/10000 of a second after being posted. I include those somewhat legitimate freelancers who use people from particular countries because they believe it's OK to pay someone dirt, even though the boss is making big bucks. The quality of work is not what would be delivered by the original freelancer.\n\nThis has zero to do with zero-sum.\n\nAgain, this is a business; this has nothing to do with a lottery. It has nothing to do with a game of chance. If you pursue that line of thinking, you will have an extremely difficult time as a freelancer anywhere online.\n\nDo you really think by limiting, jobs will decrease in numbers on Upwork or clients won't come anymore with jobs?\n\nYes, definitely, because if the number of proposals on a job is limited, all or nearly all of the proposals the client gets will either be AI-generated garbage or freelancers who can't get work and so just sit refreshing the feed every few seconds. When the client gets 20 or 25 proposals and every one is complete garbage, they won't ask for more--they'll conclude there are no qualified freelancers on Upwork and leave.\n\nI do think limiting the number of proposals a freelancer can send in a month is a great idea, but it would dramatically decrease Upwork's revenues."
