        "text": "1. Describe Sai as a third person.\n\nSai is a helpful and friendly person. A tad bit arrogant, and very very talkative. He remembers things that you yourself would not remember about your life, including the last time you had cereal. His friends will tell you the he‚Äôs ‚Äúpompous, smart, very conceited, and loves talking about all the awesome things in his life‚Äù. You can call him at 3am and ask him to review your resume for an interview the next day and he will. But if you do that and do not tell him how that interview went, he will probably not do it again. Ever.\n\n2. You are one of the technically strong person I know. Like when you talk about having read books, you are not talking about novels but a book on some computer language. And then most of your amazing talks are about computers, which I personally really like to listen to. How did you gain so much of interest in computers?\n\nI got introduced to code by my sister when I was in 4th std. It was a simple HTML page with alink, vlink, etc.. The thing that attracted me the most was the colorful nature of web pages. This transitioned into a fondness for coding/programming. I was naturally good at math, and that helped me learn programming quite easily. My interest in computers was always pretty high, but if there was one thing/person that shaped up my interest in security, it was my thesis advisor and friend ‚Äì Dr. Adam Doupe.\n\nThe reason I love reading books compared to learning online is due to an issue I have with my eyes. I have something called a ‚Äúconvergence insufficiency‚Äù, which makes it very hard for me to work on computers without suffering pain, very ironic, but unfortunately true. I literally have more books than clothes, reaching to about a 150 books so far on just Computer Science and programming languages. I make it a point to read at least one chapter a week, which also helps me with my GitHub coding streaks.\n\n3. Describe your experience in your school & college in India and at ASU.\n\nI feel that the education experience at both places are vastly different from each other, but I love them both just the same. In India, I would spend a lot of my time going to coding competitions, symposiums, and spent very little time doing homework/assignments. We had exams that covered the entire grade of the course. I felt like I had very little leftover-time in my undergrad. At ASU, my time was mostly spent in working on thesis related stuff, homework, and assignments, and rarely spent much time in studying for exams. I believe that grad school has been very light-weight and has been very easygoing. I find a lot of time for almost everything I want to do. This is one of the reasons I started doing the GitHub streak, which is almost 475 days now. Being at ASU gave me an incentive to get better, being with so many other people who worked so hard.\n\n4. If you had the power to shape up future Sai (which you have, but theoretically if you could be anyone you want to be without any problems), what would future Sai look like?\n\nThe ways I want future Sai to look like are actually two divergent things. On the one hand, I want Sai to be a visiting professor, teaching students throughout the world, learning constantly, and to be well-known in the field of Computer Science. I want Sai to be a winner of the Turing Award from ACM. On the other hand, I want to see Sai become a very well respected coder, one of the best in the business, learning newer languages, designing systems that are used by billions of people across the world. I want this Sai to at least become a respected CTO of a top tier organization making decisions impacting the lives of billions of people. One thing common to both is that they are both related to computers, another is that they both involve immense learning. In more concrete words, I want future Sai to either be a Professor or a Research Engineer (Not scientist) or maybe a bit of both.\n\n5. Tell us something about Sai that nobody else knows\n\nI am extremely shy. I know it is hard to believe, but I mostly never venture out to talk to people by myself. I am actually pretty much afraid to talk to people üôÇ I will never make the first move in talking to a person, but if they do want to talk to me and make an effort, I ensure that they are not disappointed. On stage all this changes; I become an entirely different person while I am in the spotlight, having won multiple awards for being a really good speaker, and that makes most people think that I am not shy.\n\nInterviewer‚Äôs words:\n\nSai is a trustworthy friend. Not only his knowledge makes him an awesome friend to seek out for help from, he is genuinely interested in putting in efforts to help. I also feel that he still has not utilized his abilities to his potential, which means that when he does, he will be a big figure. On the other hand, he is definitely very pompous, which can get him into trouble now or then. Like the time when he challenged everyone in our class to find out bugs in our team‚Äôs code. On a positive side, trying to save our face made project so more interesting than it would have been. But hey! He is able to convert his flamboyant words into productive actions too, which is what matters! I wish him best for whatever he does wherever he is in future."
