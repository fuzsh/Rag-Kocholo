Now: ➡️ 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗱𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗳𝗲𝗲𝗹? ➡️ 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗱𝗼 𝗣𝗮𝗸𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘀 𝗳𝗲𝗲𝗹? ➡️ 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗱𝗼 𝗔𝗺𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗻𝘀 𝗳𝗲𝗲𝗹? Now, do Indians have a right to say that 'It is 'my' desire that Sachin should play'? Is it your desire? Or is it because of the fact that you are born in a particular place? It is the 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗿𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗮𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗮𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗱𝗶𝗱𝗻'𝘁 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝗮𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗮𝗻. The Pakistanis' great desire is that Sachin should fall as early as possible. But is it really their desire? 𝗜𝘀 𝗶𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗶𝗿 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗿𝗲? Since childhood, they have been taught that Pakistan must beat India. Is it really their desire? That's what they have been told. They don't bother. They are indifferent. Who is Sachin? Now, is it their indifference? It is not even their indifference. Since childhood, all they (Americans) know is baseball. When they look at cricket, they say, 'It looks like baseball. But it's not exactly baseball. And we don't bother about what these people are doing.' So 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝘀𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘀 '𝗺𝘆' 𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗼𝗻. Every opinion is a thought, and every thought is 𝗯𝗼𝗿𝗿𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗱. 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗹 \"𝗺𝘆\" 𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳𝘁𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗲𝘀 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴. There are two types of conditioning: physical conditioning and social conditioning. ➡ 𝗣𝗵𝘆𝘀𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 refers to our body's programming to perform certain basic functions and reactions without any conscious thought. There is no free will involved in these processes; they occur independently of our conscious decisions. For example, when you touch a hot stove, your hand instantly withdraws without you having to think about it. This reflex is an example of physical conditioning at work. ➡ 𝗦𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 consists of beliefs, values, and behaviors acquired from our surroundings. This shapes how we think, behave, and perceive the world, influenced by culture, tradition, language, and societal norms. For instance, a person growing up in a particular culture adopts its customs and values without questioning them, having been conditioned from a young age. Both types of conditioning—physical and social—demonstrate that much of what we consider our own reactions and opinions are programmed responses. So never say it is 'my' opinion; it is not your opinion. It is somebody else's opinion. 𝗜𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗮 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗼𝗻. If there is 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀, it is not your thoughts and opinions, but your ability to understand. This joy is deeply related to understanding. Everything else is 𝗯𝗼𝗿𝗿𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗵𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲, 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀.\n\n\"Don't worry about my marriage, my bride is freedom.\" When 𝗕𝗵𝗮𝗴𝗮𝘁 𝗦𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗵 left his home, he wrote this at the end of his letter. On one hand, while the world thought this issue was very serious, on the other hand, our 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗴 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗷𝗼𝗸𝗲 a lot about it! When Bhagat Singh raised this issue while pulling the leg of his friend, he got this reply: \"I am already married to 'Bamatul Bukhara', and as long as she is with me, no British can catch me.\" And today, this answer seems less of a joke and more of a prophecy. Bhagat Singh's friend 𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝘀 '𝗔𝘇𝗮𝗱', 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗶𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝘀 '𝗔𝘇𝗮𝗱'. We are talking about Shri Chandrashekhar Azad. He used to call his Mauser 𝗽𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗹 '𝗕𝗮𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗹 𝗕𝘂𝗸𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗮'. 𝗧𝗼𝗱𝗮𝘆 𝗶𝘀 𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗯𝗶𝗿𝘁𝗵𝗱𝗮𝘆. So I thought, why not introduce you to the real 'Azad' today? Do you know 𝘄𝗵𝗼 𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗲𝗱 𝗵𝗶𝗺 '𝗔𝘇𝗮𝗱'? At the age of 15, his parents sent him to Banaras. They wanted young Chandrashekhar to become a 𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗹𝗮𝗿 𝗼𝗳 𝗦𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗸𝗿𝗶𝘁. But young Chandrashekhar loved freedom from the beginning. At a very young age, he became a part of 𝗚𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗵𝗶𝗷𝗶'𝘀 '𝗡𝗼𝗻-𝗖𝗼𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁' and also went to jail for the movement. When he was presented before the magistrate, the magistrate asked, \"𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗲? 𝗪𝗵𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝘀𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂? 𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗵𝗼𝗺𝗲?\" Then young Chandrashekhar said, \"𝗠𝘆 𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 '𝗔𝘇𝗮𝗱', 𝗺𝘆 𝗳𝗮𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿'𝘀 𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 '𝗦𝘄𝗮𝗱𝗵𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗮', 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗺𝘆 𝗵𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝘀 '𝗷𝗮𝗶𝗹'.\" Seeing this attitude, the magistrate 𝗽𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘀𝗵𝗲𝗱 𝗵𝗶𝗺 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝟭𝟱 𝗹𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗲𝘀. He happily accepted it. And from that day onwards, he was called ‘Azad’. But don’t be fooled, Azad was 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀 𝘀𝗼 𝘀𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗼𝘂𝘀! If you ask HSRA (his organization) comrades Shiv Verma, Bhagwandas Mahor, and Manmath Nath Gupta, they will tell you the inside story. Azad was a very sociable person. He would often 𝗰𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗷𝗼𝗸𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝘀𝗶𝘁𝘂𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀! Also, he used to talk with such intimacy that the parents of all the comrades considered him as their elder son. And why not? When the young comrades of HSRA were 16-17 years old, Azad was 20 years old. It was Azad who trained all the new revolutionaries and took care of them like an 𝗲𝗹𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗯𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿. Not only this, he used to meet the parents of the comrades regularly. He kept a constant watch that they did not get any inkling of the revolutionary activities and their anxiety did not increase. Azad also loved to ride a bicycle. If someone overtook him, he would get peace only after 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗵𝗶𝗺 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗲. . . (What happened next is 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗹𝘆 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴. Discover the complete story in the 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.)\n\nI never tire of telling this small story: ⬇ Once I was travelling in a 𝗹𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻 which started from Delhi, next whole day it travels, and on the third day, reaches its destination. First day in my coach, a lady enters, and sits on the berth in front of me, and she 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗸𝘀 𝘂𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗹𝘆 𝗱𝗲𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗱, I thought it’s fine; it is a long journey, she might be sad at something. I did not pay much attention to it and slowly, as the night came in, she is showing sighing with her head against the window. 𝗛𝗲𝗿 𝘀𝗮𝗱𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝘄𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 as the stations kept on passing by. I thought it may a general grief upon leaving some dear one behind and went off to sleep. In the morning as I woke up 𝗜 𝗳𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝗵𝗲𝗿 𝘄𝗲𝗲𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴 and now tears were rolling down her cheeks. Concerned, I decided to ask but then stopped thinking it might be something personal. But then with every station that passed, her woes were increasing. As the afternoon approached, 𝘀𝗵𝗲 𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝗰𝗿𝘆𝗶𝗻𝗴 and filling the compartment with her wail. I was concerned and asked the cause to her utter sadness, but 𝘀𝗵𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝗱 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘀𝗮𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝘂𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗰𝗿𝘆. I thought she didn’t want to tell and tried not to pay any heed after that. As evening came, 𝘀𝗵𝗲 𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝗰𝗿𝘆𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘃𝗶𝗴𝗼𝗿𝗼𝘂𝘀𝗹𝘆. I asked again and she did not say anything again. So amidst all this crying, I somehow managed to sleep although with difficulty. In the morning when I woke up, I was startled to see that she was crying with all her might! Not only was 𝘀𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗼𝗯𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗳𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗼𝘂𝘀𝗹𝘆 but also shouting and beating the walls in despair. 𝗜 𝗴𝗼𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝗱 at that and making her sit still, I asked firmly the reason of her grief. “𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝘀𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝗼 𝗺𝘂𝗰𝗵?” She replied in a very soft, almost guilty voice, that “I am in the 𝘄𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻 since last three days, and every station that passes by reminds me that I am in the wrong train.” Found it funny, hmm? If you know that the train is wrong, then why did not you get off it? Now if you know you are in the 𝘄𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗲𝘁𝘆, if you really know it deeply enough then you would have left it by now. You would have discarded it by now, you would have flown away by now! Whom are you deceiving? 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝘄𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝘀𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗲𝘁𝘆 and you 𝘄𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 from this very society and at the same time, you want to enjoy being a ‘rebel’. 𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘄𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗲𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗲 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲. #acharyaprashant #life\n\nOn July 17, 1948, 𝘄𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗻 were allowed to sit for 𝗨𝗣𝗦𝗖 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲. 😯 Reading this fact three days ago 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗽𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘂𝘀 as much as it may surprise you now. But society has progressed significantly since then. Looking at social media and films, women and men have equal freedom and opportunities. 𝗪𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝗮𝗻 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝗿𝗲𝘁? ⬇ 𝙈𝙤𝙨𝙩 𝙢𝙚𝙣 𝙛𝙚𝙚𝙡 𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝘄𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗻 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀 𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙣 𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙢! But what do the facts say? Let's take a look. All these statistics are based on recent government data (NSO Survey): 🔷 In 1947, India's literacy rate was 17%. Within that, the 𝗺𝗮𝗹𝗲 𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘆 𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝟮𝟱% and the 𝗳𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗹𝗲 𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘆 𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝟴%. Even now, in 2024, there is still a 𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝗴𝗮𝗽 between male and female literacy rates. For example, in 𝗥𝗮𝗷𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗵𝗮𝗻, the female literacy rate is only 58%, meaning 𝟰𝟮% 𝗼𝗳 𝘄𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝗼𝗿 𝘄𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗶𝗿 𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲. The male literacy rate is much higher at 81%. The situation is not much better in other states either. 🔵 𝗘𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸, 𝘂𝗻𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗽𝗮𝘆: In rural areas, if 𝗺𝗲𝗻 𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 ₹𝟯𝟵𝟯 𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝗱𝗮𝘆, 𝘄𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗻 𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 ₹𝟮𝟲𝟱 for the same work. 🔵 In the 15-29 age group, over 𝟱𝟬% 𝗼𝗳 𝘄𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗻 are neither employed nor studying. So think about what this young workforce is doing? 🔵 Only 13.6% of 𝗠𝗣𝘀 in the 2024-2029 Lok Sabha are women. 🔵 Only 16% of India's total 𝘀𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝘀𝘁𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗿𝘀 are women. 🔵 Most women are not part of the economy. Only 29% of women are economically 𝘀𝗲𝗹𝗳-𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗻𝘁. In China, this rate is 61%. 🔵 The rate of 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿-𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗳𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗱𝗲 in India is alarmingly high. 40% of the world's feticides occur in India alone each year. It is estimated that due to female feticide, there are 𝟰-𝟱 𝗰𝗿𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗳𝗲𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝗱𝗮𝘂𝗴𝗵𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 in the Indian population. Yes, we have lost 4-5 crore of our daughters to feticide. If these 𝗱𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝗱𝗮𝘂𝗴𝗵𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝘄𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺 𝗮 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗿𝘆 together, the population of 200 countries worldwide would be less than that country. 🔵 70% of 𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗺𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗴𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗻 are domestic violence or violence by someone known to them. Not only this, but the situation in the rest of the world is also similar: 🔶 Women in Switzerland got the 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝘃𝗼𝘁𝗲 in 1970. 🔶 Until 1980, women in England could not take 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗲𝗯𝗶𝘁 𝗰𝗮𝗿𝗱𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗶𝗿 𝗼𝘄𝗻 𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗲. 🔶 Women could not hold 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗷𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲 in all states of America until 1973. 🔶 Women in Saudi Arabia have been 𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗱𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗰𝗮𝗿𝘀 only since 2018. This is a global problem. Women need more representation in all fields of our society! #acharyaprashant #gender\n\nIn today's world, the word \"𝗚𝘂𝗿𝘂\" has been diluted to the point where it is applied to anyone with a little bit of knowledge in any field. We have Love Gurus, Tech Gurus, Fitness Gurus, Marketing Gurus, Yoga Gurus, and whatnot. “𝗚𝘂𝗿𝘂,” 𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗮𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗹𝗲, 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗰𝗮𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝗿𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗹𝘆. But simply imparting knowledge doesn’t earn one the esteemed status of a Guru. It’s important to understand why it is 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝘄𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝘀𝗼 𝗮𝗻 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁 to use the word “Guru” casually and irresponsibly. 🔵 𝗔 𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗶𝘀 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗮 𝗚𝘂𝗿𝘂: Someone who provides you with knowledge is not a Guru. He is just a KP (knowledge provider). In fact, what we have mostly in 𝘀𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗴𝗲𝘀 are also knowledge providers. They must not be called teachers or Gurus. Learn to see the difference between the two. There is a deep reason why society calls a KP a Guru—so that 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗚𝘂𝗿𝘂, the bodh, can be avoided. Society hates the Guru and is afraid of him. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗚𝘂𝗿𝘂 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗧𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗺𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗽𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗼 𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗳𝗮𝗹𝘀𝗲𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀. Never equate a KP with a teacher or Guru. A KP will ensure your ego remains intact. He will work to satisfy 𝗬𝗢𝗨𝗥 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱𝘀 and help you meet 𝗬𝗢𝗨𝗥 𝗴𝗼𝗮𝗹𝘀. He will give you knowledge as per 𝗬𝗢𝗨𝗥 𝗱𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱. In a way, 𝗵𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗿𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗧𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵 𝗗𝗢𝗪𝗡 𝘁𝗼 𝗬𝗢𝗨𝗥 𝗹𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹. A Guru, on the contrary, will 𝗥𝗔𝗜𝗦𝗘 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝗼𝗳 𝗧𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵. This process of raising you involves the annihilation of your ego, so most probably you will not like it. A Guru will not meet your expectations, nor will he draw a syllabus to meet your demands. In fact, 𝗶𝗳 𝗵𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗮 𝗚𝘂𝗿𝘂, 𝗵𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝘀𝗵𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗺𝘀. It is difficult to like or love a Guru, but KPs are very likable. 🪔 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗮𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗧𝗶𝘁𝗹𝗲 \"𝗚𝘂𝗿𝘂\"🪔 So do not just call anybody a ‘Guru’. Guru is not a cheap word. Do not use it casually. Just as you cannot go about giving your heart to anybody, similarly you cannot have anybody as your Guru. It is a 𝗹𝗼𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝗳𝗳𝗮𝗶𝗿 𝗱𝗲𝗲𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝗻 𝗹𝗼𝘃𝗲. #acharyaprashant #GuruPurnima\n\n\"Which coaching institute is best for my 5th grader for IIT JEE preparation?\" A Quora user asked this question some time ago, which led to a heated debate. Many called this 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝘂𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 on the child and instead suggested letting the child explore his or her real talents and interests. To this, the parent responded, \"The child doesn’t know what is good or bad for him. Hence, it’s our responsibility to choose the right path for him….𝗜𝗜𝗧 𝗶𝘀 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗴𝗶𝗼𝘂𝘀, and getting into it will bring pride to the family.\" Unfortunately, this belief is not unique to one family; it reflects a broader societal obsession with IIT, viewing it not just as an educational degree but as a 𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗶𝘀𝗲. Here are several logical fallacies contributing to the hype and obsession with IIT: 1) 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗼 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆: Accepting a belief based on authority rather than evidence. 𝗘𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲: Parents push their children to prepare for IIT because a 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗶𝘀𝗲𝘀 it's the only way to ensure a successful future. This ignores the child's interests in other fields. 2) 𝗛𝗮𝘀𝘁𝘆 𝗚𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Drawing a conclusion from insufficient or biased evidence. 𝗘𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲: Believing all IIT graduates get 𝗵𝗶𝗴𝗵-𝗽𝗮𝘆𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗷𝗼𝗯𝘀 based on a few success stories, despite 38% of students across 23 IIT campuses being unplaced in 2024. This ignores the varied outcomes for IIT graduates. 3) 𝗙𝗮𝗹𝘀𝗲 𝗗𝗶𝗰𝗵𝗼𝘁𝗼𝗺𝘆: Presenting two options as the only possibilities, ignoring other alternatives. 𝗘𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲: Telling a student they must get into 𝗜𝗜𝗧 𝗼𝗿 settle for a 𝗺𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗼𝗰𝗿𝗲 𝗷𝗼𝗯, ignoring other top institutions and varied career paths. 4) 𝗛𝗮𝗹𝗼 𝗘𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁: Assuming one positive quality leads to other positive qualities. 𝗘𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲: Assuming an IIT graduate will excel in all areas of life, such as being a 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗻𝗲𝗿, based solely on their academic success. 5) 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗱𝘄𝗮𝗴𝗼𝗻 𝗙𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗰𝘆: Doing something because others are doing it. 𝗘𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲: Students enroll in IIT coaching because their 𝗽𝗲𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘁, driven by media and popular culture, ignoring other fulfilling career paths. 6) 𝗙𝗮𝗹𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗲: Assuming that if one event follows another, the first event caused the second. 𝗘𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲: Believing success is solely due to graduating from IIT, ignoring personal skills, networks, and other opportunities. 7) 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗼 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Considering something better or correct because it is traditional. 𝗘𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲: Expecting children to follow 𝗳𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗹𝘆 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 of becoming engineers or doctors, leading to dissatisfaction in fields they are not passionate about. These fallacies create unrealistic expectations and undue pressure on students and graduates. It's crucial to recognize an individual's character and true potential beyond their degree."
