        "text": "News\n\nentertainment\n\nhindi\n\nbollywood\n\nExclusive! \"Irrfan Khan was one of the most respected actors in Hollywood,\" says 'Tryst With Destiny' director Prashant Nair\n\nThis story is from May 8, 2020\n\nExclusive! \"Irrfan Khan was one of the most respected actors in Hollywood,\" says 'Tryst With Destiny' director Prashant Nair\n\nInternational filmmaker Prashant Nair, whose latest film 'Tryst With Destiny' bagged the Best Screenplay Award at the 2020 Tribeca Film Festival recently opened up about Irrfan Khan and how the methods of filmmaking have changed amidst the lockdown, in an exclusive interaction with ETimes.\n\nInternational filmmaker Prashant Nair, whose latest film 'Tryst With Destiny' bagged the Best Screenplay Award at the 2020 Tribeca Film Festival recently opened up about Irrfan Khan and how the methods of filmmaking have changed amidst the lockdown, in an exclusive interaction with ETimes.\n\nThe ace filmmaker also shared his views on how Irrfan opened up the doors for Indian actors in Hollywood and how foreign cinema has evolved over the period and now aims at representing Indian and South Asian talents on screen.\n\nExcerpts from the interviewâ¦\n\nHow has the lockdown affected your life?\n\nSo, on a personal level, we live in the countryside and fortunately, they locked down the island quite early so it hasn't been too bad here. But the rest of Spain has been a disaster. Living in the countryside here with around 2000 people, our life is generally quite quiet anyways so nothing's changed that much and I've had time to write and spend with my daughter. Professionally, it's been both good and bad in the sense that I have had time to write and work on new projects. But at the same time, we just finished a film. The film was going to premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival and we were all excited but then at the same time this whole thing happened. So we actually haven't been able to screen the film publicly yet as the festival didn't happen the way it usually does. Thankfully, they still had the competition and the jury ended up giving us an award, but at the same time, it's just a weird time. Nobody really knows what to expect in the future and what's going happen with all the films that are ready right now.\n\nAnything new that you have learnt in the lockdown?\n\nYeah, absolutely. I think we're learning how to do as much as possible over the Internet, which is great. All the meetings that were before happening in person are now happening over the Internet and I hope that continues. I've also been getting a lot of people calling with offers to direct shows that are do it yourself, which is very strange. I've gotten three or four calls in the last week with people offering me to direct shows that are made entirely in a remote way. So the cameras are shipped to people's homes and they record themselves and the edit happens somewhere else and then you direct it from somewhere else. So that's been pretty interesting. I also got a couple of calls about writing for animation - I guess people are looking to do more animation films. So definitely the number of people calling for writing has increased along with animation and creative lockdown projects.\n\nWe all understand that things may not go back to the way exactly they were. So we're trying to move ahead with our current projects in new ways. I'm currently exploring casting and we're trying to do that completely through the Internet. So it's been interesting and I think we're all finding new ways to create content and to collaborate.\n\nWhat is the first thing that you plan to do once the lockdown is over?\n\nWe're fortunate here in Spain as we have no alcohol restrictions otherwise that would be the first thing. So I would like to go to the beach because we are so close to it and yet we canât so I think that'll be the first thing I would do once the lockdown is over.\n\nFrom an entrepreneur to films, what inspired you to take such a huge step in your career?\n\nI didn't spend too much time thinking about what I wanted to do in life when I was a teenager and was kind of involved in the day to day of life. I studied engineering and I never really liked it. I think a lot of people in my generation studied engineering because they didn't know what their real passion was. So when I graduated I didn't really know what I wanted to do, I thought probably it was to write a book. But it was also bang in the middle of the internet boom in the late 90s which was quite an interesting time and one thing led to another and I started a company and, of course the money was great, but I wasn't completely satisfied. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I'd never read a screenplay or been on a set and didn't even have any contact in the film industry. So I just took a little class and thought it was quite interesting so let me try my hand at making a really small movie. And then one thing led to another so it wasn't a well thought through plan.\n\nIt's hard to give up a lucrative career at a certain point in your life and start from zero so when I look back at it â I probably didn't think it through that well at the time, but you know, life is short so you just need to find something you love to do as that's what makes you richer.\n\nYour latest film Tryst With Destiny won the Best Screenplay in an International Narrative award at the Tribeca Film Festival recently. How do you feel about it and what do you plan to do next?\n\nI'm delighted, it's the best start that we could have hoped for the film in the given the circumstances. I'm really happy for the team as even though the award was for Best Screenplay, the jury spoke a lot about the execution of the film, which I think reflects not just my work, but everyone across the board. I think is a good start for the film. Iâm told it is the first time that an Indian film has won a major competition prize in Tribeca.\n\nNow, we hope for a proper screening so that the cast and crew can see their work.\n\nCan you tell us about a director whom you idolize?\n\nThere are many but Iâve always been a huge fan of AlmodÃ³var. He has been a huge inspiration in terms of the uniqueness of his voice and how he embraces it. I love a lot of his films and have also always been a huge fan of Bong Joon-ho, who after 'Parasite', has rightfully become a household name.\n\nIs there an equal opportunity for Indian talents in the West?\n\nWe were heading quickly in that direction before this pandemic but who knows what happens after this. Hollywood was certainly getting more and more conscious of the idea that there needs to be Indian and South Asian talent represented on screen and behind the camera. For example, I have agents in Los Angeles, from whom I regularly receive scripts and proposals for projects that include South Asian talent. So I think there are a growing number of directors and actors in the system. It's a very good time right now.\n\nWhat do you make of Priyanka Chopraâs foray into Hollywood?\n\nWell, it's obviously amazing what she's done. It requires a tremendous amount of work to cross over from such different worlds and sheâs setting an example for a lot of other people.\n\nWhich Indian actor has made the most impact in Hollywood?\n\nIrrfan was definitely one of the most respected actors in Hollywood. I think he made the biggest mark with the sheer power of his performance and he was an actor many major directors across the world appreciated. The nuance and the complexity with which he inhabited his characters was so respected all across the world. I think Irrfan has reached a level that no one else has reached yet.\n\nBollywood recently lost two stalwarts, Rishi Kapoor and Irrfan Khan. Did you get a chance to meet them?\n\nI met them both informally, socially and both were delightful. I can't say I know them in any way but I've met them both and like any other director I have always wanted to work with Irrfan.\n\nWhich is your favourite Irrfan Khan film?\n\nI love 'The Warrior' by Asif Kapadia and also 'The Lunchbox'.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nVisual Stories\n\nFrom Sonakshi Sinha to Anushka Sharma: Bollywood divas who nailed the red sari look\n\nLifestyle\n\nBhojpuri celebs who are also exceptional singers\n\nEntertainment\n\n10 must-try street foods of Varanasi\n\nFood\n\nBaby boy names that mean success\n\nLifestyle\n\nSigns you are in a toxic relationship\n\nLifestyle\n\n10 most stressful countries in the world\n\ntravel\n\nâPowerful bows in Hindu legendsâ\n\nLifestyle\n\nVacation outfits to steal from Samantha's wardrobe\n\nEntertainment\n\n8 short books that a true bibliophile will finish in a day\n\nLifestyle"
