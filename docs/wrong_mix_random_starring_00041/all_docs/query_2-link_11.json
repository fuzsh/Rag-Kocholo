What you see here is the one-of-a-kind pecan pie from @troublebakermy, which was introduced to me by my foodie sis @nananawiz. \n\nThis ensemble has everything I love in a square... crunch from the pecan nuts, dark chocolate (what other choc is worth having anyways üòâ), and a crumbly base that brings it all together in an inseparable bond. Some may say it's a bit on the sweet side, but I don't share that view, given the balance of textures from the crunch, crumb and velvety dark choc.\n\nAlso, it surprisingly doesn't feel too heavy for the gut, either. The petite 1-inch squares keep the guilt at bay (for me at least!) and helps earn brownie (or pie?) points with others as it's just too easy to share. Somehow, they seem to call out to you to share themüòÅ  Everyone I've shared it with have never said it was too much, nor too little. \n\nAs a gift, it expresses curative thought and a personal touch towards the giftee. People l know love it, even if they're not big nutters. Period ‚ù§Ô∏è\".",
