        "text": ":: A still from his review video\n\n\"Everything is about politics and shoe licking,.. \" Cdtv rights reserved (r) ~ Prashanth is an unbiased blunt tamil film reviewer who won't prevaricate. He \"perspires\" for making his reviews in a well grid unique standard. Popular film celebs have recognized his endeavours.\n\n\" I did my schooling in Tiruppur, Tamilnadu. Studied chemical engineering at Sathyabama University. \"\n\n‣ What will you credit for your successful run at Youtube. . Is your review commercialized..\n\nThe reason for me to do the reviews was I was tired of the biased reviews being broadcasted on channels, reviewers fool people by appreciating a movie that is not worth it at all, my goal is to help people with genuine reviews so that they are not wasting their money on a waste movie.\n\nIt all started withAayirathil oruvan , I actually started with Eeramreview, but it was a poorly done one and I removed it in a week, I was not serious about reviewing then. I credit my viewers for my successful run, they are everything to me, whatever I’m doing, I’m doing it for them! And honestly, this is not a commercial review, whatever little revenue I get through the ads, I spend it to buy tickets , watch movies and buy more equipment to enhance my reviews. However, you can call it commercial as I’m generating revenue out of my reviews.\n\n\" I think I have every right to rebut to comments that are nasty .. \"\n\n‣ In some videos, you have leived a remark or note about \"bad\" comments.. How do they mean you.. and what can probably the reason for those comments..\n\nI’m a highly sensible human being and I think I have every right to rebut to comments that are nasty, I cannot keep my mouth shut when someone tries to provoke me for no reason. I also think that it is very important for me to thank the viewers who thank or praise me through the comments, I always owe my viewers!\n\n‣ Some time back in the mid of February, you said Selvaragavan to remind about you and you added that he is the one who encouraged you to do these reviews. Hope we are right. How come this recognition happened.. and kindly\n\nnote us of any other film celebs who have recognized your works.. We guess G.V Prakash too encouraged you.\n\nYes, you are right. Selvaraghavan, GV Prakash, Udhayanithi stalin , Prasanna, Pooja balu and Jithan Ramesh are people who encourage me now and then. Selva anna (Selvaraghavan) is very special to me because he was the first celebrity to recognize me , I remember saying that I shot aayirathil oruvan review with a webcam and did not even have proper equipment to shoot, he said just do it with what u have and it will be fine. These people are like family to me.\n\n\" People are not willing to put their effort , but still want to be famous. \"\n\n‣ What is the sole need to upload these videos with varied subjects. There are\n\nads been displayed for every video. Do you think they hinder the viewers?\n\nViewers have no problems with the ads being run, and you cannot do things for free forever!I need some money to buy the tickets etc, the viewers have never complained about the ads, so I don’t really worry! I really do not plan about the subject of my video, everything is spontaneous except for the reviews as it is planned. Even if I plan, I see no wrong with it, as it will only help the viewers.\n\n‣ Some of your videos reflect a \"transparent\" point out on big shots, were there any claims ? Is that you removed or re-uploaded a video again with corrections in speech or something that you gave clarification about your earlier views..\n\nNope, never, your source has minimal knowledge about me. My Angadi Theru review was blocked by ayngaran* for no reason,\n\nI phoned them and clarified that I have the right to review any movie, so they said I can re-upload and won't block. I then raised the issue with youtube and got that blockade completely removed. I will never ever remove a video for anyone, whoever thebig shot may be. I have not clarified about my position in any video, I love every actor but hate the actions of some of them some times. I have made an interview by director Senthamizhan private because he was talking about an issue in the video, and since the issue was solved, I thought the video will be hindrance to the film and hence I made that interview private.\n\n‣ Some of your videos partially mark the pitfalls for a talent to come in flying color. Some bear a sarcastic note with sometimes posing a derogatory remark and unveils a passive speech as a crusader for led down talents.. Your notion that the present world is failing to recognize true talents. How far do you admit these views,.. Your view, please..\n\nTamil cinema Industry is the perfect example of a world that barely recognizes true talent. Everything is about politics and shoe licking, You cannot be open, You MUST call your actors and directors with a \"sir\" preceding their name, You have to praise them for \"nothing things\". This has now become a custom of almost every field including IT- especially in India. True talents are barred most of the time by highly selfish people, that is why it is important for true talents to use youtube as a platform and show the world who they are. I took no ones help when I started and I’m happy with where I’m now, I cannot say that I’m a talent , but I can definitely say that I have done something that will otherwise be impossible for me to do through vintage methods. I stand for some values, I’m always a crusader at heart and have deeper understanding about life than many. For me, people are more important than money.\n\n‣ Your unbiased and blunt narration has catered likes for your endeavours.. We are happy for it. Kindly express your view about short films, short film\n\nmakers,..\n\nI can see many with a high Definition video camera shooting some nonsense and calling it a short film. I remember reading a tamil script written in English and the dialogues were robotic. People are not willing to put their effort , but still want to be famous. My reviews may look simple, but it takes atleast 8 hours for me to make a review and I do lot of takes to get the perfect review, I honestly in my heart know that I’m working hard on my reviews and this is the only reason why my viewers like it. Short film makers should follow the same, put the best effort you can, take your time to write the script and update it if necessary, be humble , respect people's opinion, this is how you grow as a short film maker. I have seen some fantastic short films and I totally believe that short films can influence a person in many different ways, so it is very important for our society to come with high quality short films and not some 10 minute crap!\n\n‣ Special mention..\n\nSruthi muthukrishnan – my friend who I love a lot. Ambreen Tariq – A friend from Pakistan who inspires me in many different ways! Maharajan Kanagaraj – A college friend who knows me to the core, My lovely clients from the west, Selavaraghavan anna and Udhayanithi stalin anna ."
