But it's a good one and twisted, one I should say.\n\nDecember 30, 2022\n\nRating: 🌟🌟🌟🌟. 25\n\nReview:\n\nWow!! A beautiful short book with characters, I would love to reread again.\n\nThe story is of Sooraj and Ridhi. In the beginning of the story we introduce to Sooraj and how he's struggling to perfect person in Tinder to get lucky. And also meets his two beautiful, funny friends. Then we meets Ridhi, and comes to know their story. Two childhood friends who becomes lovers, share their all beautiful firsts together, a perfect love story. But then one day it's not anymore. And in this story we gets to see that if their loves is really ends or not.\n\nA mature romance book, with mature characters, talks about real things, or ignore them and the characters with their flaws and mistakes and the way they lead their life makes them more real, more relatable at times.\n\nI love Sooraj and Ridhi, I love their relationship. Two totally different persons, who respects each other for everything they are, but still not ready to discuss their real problems. Yes at times I get annoyed with Sooraj and his thought process, he's still interesting to read about.\n\nEven though the story is short, it's still intriguing enough to read, about how an imperfect relationship can also be perfect in many ways. A must read.\n\nJanuary 7, 2023\n\nAt first I want to ask a question that what does it mean ‘A love story'.\n\nIs it mean that to love someone and marry him/her? Or to love him/her till last breath. We all love someone in our entire life. Some marry them and some can't.\n\nThis story is for them who get married to their love. What happens after love marriage. Our love ends or it stays like as it was. This is the story of Ridhi and Sooraj whose teenage love blooms.\n\nBut slowly slowly their is separation in their love. As a result they got divorced. What's happed to them and their child?\n\nDid they come together again? Or married someone else? Do this was the end of the story.\n\nIs this how their love end?\n\nThere is too much romance in this story and twist. I hooked through this book. Read the whole book to know full story.\n\nFebruary 2, 2023\n\nA Perfect Love Story…Until it was not by Prashant Sharma is a fictional story that revolves around a smart hardworking engineer, Sooraj and Ridhi was a creative girl with no aim in her life. They had been childhood friends, grew up by living every phase of life together and ended up marrying each other. But life never runs smoothly it’s always filled with ups and downs, trials and challenges, joy and happiness. Here also, after their marriage destiny brought some twist and turns in their lives. What were those? Will they be able to sort out everything and live a happy life?\n\nThis story is a perfect blend of friendship, hope, love, romance, ups and downs, twist and turns. I was legit hooked till the end to know what will happen next. The characters were well maintained. The writing style and plotline was gripping. The language was simple and understandable. The title and cover are appropriate. Overall, it was a good short fictional read.\n\nDecember 23, 2022\n\nIt is a beautiful love story between the two childhood friends Riddhi and Sooraj. The journey begins from there and it's slowly finds its own space in teenage as a romantic love story and then finally comes to marriage. But is that an end to a love story? After marriage we will think that is there no love between them? Is that the way the relationship goes? What would be the love in this story is really gripping to read till the end of the book.\n\nIt's really impressive that how the author puts up all the relatable issues to make the readers understand deeply. Every love story will be so sweet and always nice until marriage. But after marriage, the scenarios and situations will change. As the priorities changed, automatically there may be a chance to get fade in the love bond slowly. Riddhi and Sooraj's married life slowly falls apart with time. Whether they both realize the worth of each other is interesting to go deep into the bond of their relationship. Riddhi always wanted to explore and create something of her own but on the other side everything will be a competition for Sooraj.\n\nThe end of the story is unexpected and unpredictable. But if feels like incomplete as like the climax of some movies which will keep some of you dissatisfied or disappointed. The author might have been added epilogue to the story that what happens next to the ending rather it states only the author’s thank you note. Editing part should be much better. Otherwise it’s in an easy language. The title and the cover is also perfectly made. The plot of the story is in an average mode. The storyline is gripping, entertaining and engaging to touch our emotion. It looks like a teenage love story and the life that begins. Nicely narrated and the writing style is good enough. New young readers can find the joy of reading this simple love story.\n\nDecember 23, 2022\n\nBook : A Perfect Love Story - Until It Was Not\n\nAuthor : Prashant Sharma\n\nThis story was almost like watching a movie. Every scene was running inside my mind. The author's writing skill was the obvious reason behind this. Is it because of beautiful writing style, or proper handling of emotions, Or Existing characters.\n\nThe story revolves around the couple who has been with each other for a long time but still they have not discussed the important issues of their relationship. The stroy revolves around Ridhi and sooraj are childhood lovers and have grown up together and know each other inside out, problems arise when they grow up and have to act as adults and have currers to make and a living to do. There are so many parts of it that i can relate to. The old school love instead of the new era love through phones. This book has taken up one of the most rampant yet unadressed issues of today's generation. When people have rose tinted glasses on duringbthe relationsgio and everything seems smooth, the iceberg of irregularities dont come in view and when they hit, the entire balance goes haywire.\n\nWhile reading certain scenes in the story I actually felt like it was happening in reality ! That is how the book deeply engages the readers. Many more gave a scary experience while reading this book. The author has a good storytelling style. However, it's the ending that was the most terrifying.\n\nSuch an intriguing and unique storyline. It's a very short read.A story full of emotional ups and down. Eloborate writing and smooth transition between scenes. The plot and the plot twist were shocking and I like it alot. This book got me hooked right from start and you just can't stop reading it unless you have finished it.\n\n⭐ Rating : 4/5 🌟⭐\n\n⭐ Must Recommended 🌟\n\nDecember 15, 2022\n\nA PERFECT LOVE STORY…UNTIL IT WAS NOT... by Prashant Sharma is a story revolving around childhood sweethearts Riddhi and Sooraj. The journey from there slowly finds its space in teenage romance and then in marriage. But do you really think marriage would be the ultimatum of any relationship? The journey after that would be a cakewalk right? Then my dear you're wrong.\n\nI'm so impressed by the author, he puts up all the relatable issues diligently. Priorities may get changed, it's shown boldly. Likewise, Riddhi and Sooraj’s married life slowly falls apart or better to say fades away with time when they both realise the worth of each other in their togetherness. Riddhi being an average student always wanted to create something of her own but on the other everything was a competition for Sooraj.\n\nRiddhi cherries her carrier after wasting so many years just getting expensive gifts from her rich husband, which later on turn into a small needle in them. What do you think can be the ending of this so-called perfect marriage? Will there be any marriage? And if it does what does get changed?\n\nTrust me, please don't miss the ending it was so unexpecting (kind of expected something like that may happen but this way was unimaginable). Just a book of 166 pages-1/2 sitting just enough. At some point, you may feel it's a book for mere teenagers just stepping into the genre of love and all, yep the book is written in too simple language like really easy. At some point, I felt the editing part could have been done better. Few personal descriptions and Characterisation were simply inelegant. Expecting things to turn a little more pleasing from his next work.\n\nDecember 26, 2022\n\n✨Book Name- A Perfect Love Story...

So much that I know what to expect and kind of have my predictions about what many happen and unravel in the story.\n\nTo be fairly honest, the blurb gives me an impression that the story is quite a cliche and nothing much to hold on to but I was wrong on my judgements. This is why they say \"do not judge a book by its cover\" because we may never know what we may find in between the book and just how much we are going to love and remember it from time to time.\n\nSo, this is a love story, I guess we can all figure that out from the first read itself but one thing that is the element of surprise in this book is that it is not your usual love story. It is filled with actions and developments that one can hardly see that so much time has passed while reading it.\n\nThough the story is not something we haven't heard before, I still had a great time reading this one. It's always fun and nice to follow characters and see how they progress throughout the book. This book is one as such that keeps on pushing you to read forward and wait for the final reveal.\n\nThis book is a must-read for everyone. Do read it if you have the chance. Everything is done beautifully. The characters are well developed and the language is clear and straightforward. Such a great read.\n\nJanuary 10, 2023\n\nThe Perfect Love story until it was is an amazing novel written by Prashant Sharma .First I appreciate its catchy cover ,which is good enough to attract any reader.
