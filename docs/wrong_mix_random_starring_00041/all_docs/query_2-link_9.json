        "text": "In September ‘22, after a long wait of 12 months after first opening The Avatar Hotel , we were finally able to obtain our bar license and we launched our cocktail program at The Loft Kitchen & Bar in the hotel. During the pandemic, the concepts of a ‘spirit forward’ and ‘ingredient driven’ approach to cocktails started taking roots with a few bars in Delhi and Goa leading the early charge, followed by Mumbai and Bangalore. It’s now spread wider with great cocktail bars in Jaipur, Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune. There maybe about 50 bars of note that regularly do the rounds of bar wars with various brands. So we took a bold step in cheerful Mangalore to bring out our Tulu Nadu hyper local version of it in 2022. We recently also re-did the menus in 2024 and went even deeper on the craft. While our signatures have always had Tulu names to drive the point home, someone took this picture below and posted it somewhere and since then it’s suddenly gone viral bringing our invisible efforts here some much needed oxygen. It’s been coming to me twice a day on WhatsApp from random corners of the country. I thank our mystery patron. You are just what stories like us need to keep doing our thang. Hope you enjoyed our cocktails as much as we enjoy creating and serving them. #LiveTheLifeYouLove MOHAMMED IMRAN KHAN Jijo Paul Ashish Suresh Subhash Praveen Ullal Nilesh Nayak\n\nBeing located in the home of the 100 year young ‘Bharat Ka’ Karnataka Bank, It’s our frequent pleasure at The Avatar Hotel to cater to this prestigious Bank of India for their business and convention needs. Took the liberty of interrupring their working lunch and personally welcoming the MD Mr Srikrishnan Keech and ED Sekhar Rao to the hotel along with all their leadership from across the nation. So much energy in the room! It was infectious."
