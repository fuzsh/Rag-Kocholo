        "text": "For anyone who knows me well or even met me once, I often get complimented or a remark passed that “You speak very well.” It can refer to my business presentations or sometimes just my communication skills, sitting down and penning this on a Monday morning, there is a small sense of achievement for me not because of the compliment but because people other than me believed in it but not me.\n\n“To speak, or not to speak, that is the question—\n\nWhether ’tis Nobler in the mind to suffer\n\nThe Slings and Arrows of outrageous audience members,\n\nOr to run and hide,To die, to sleep”.\n\nMaybe it wouldn’t have been a great quote in Hamlet, but it is a great question for many. When it comes to public speaking, I have known many people including my cousins or friends who literally throw up and immediately say “NO” at just the idea of having to get up in front of an audience. In fact, I will never forget my first experience with public speaking.\n\nBrevity is the soul of wit\n\nIt was Grade 3 and I was forced to go on stage as a part of a mandatory elocution competition and I walked up to the stage with my tie and uniform and I stood there for 2 mins looking at the entire auditorium, which consisted of Chief Guests, Trustees, Parents of other kids, my friends, seniors, juniors and all I could say was “Thank you”. Those 2 minutes were the longest of my life and my eyes were all red with tears filled in it, I didn’t lose composure, held my head high and walked down the stage with lot of whispers around. Devastated, heartbroken I snuggled to my mum and dad in the auditorium watching my friends win prize after prize. That HURT and HURT Real bad not because I came back after two words but because I didn’t even try and of course a 7-year old’s jealousy of your friends winning trophies and certificate.\n\nMy teacher met me next day, where I was a subject of ridicule in my class and she called me in front of everyone and asked everyone to clap and I will never forget her words as she said,\n\n“Everyone Clap for Prashanth because in spite of not saying anything he didn’t cry on stage and maintained his manners.”\n\nProbably, it was that which stung me in my head and she told me speaking on stage is not a big thing and if I couldn’t do its absolutely fine. That hit me and hit me so hard that I decided that I will go there once again and try my luck.\n\nThe stage was the same, the occasion was my annual day but lot at stake for me personally (I know I make it sound like some cliched warfare but as an 8-9-year-old this was my biggest battle apart from deciding which cartoon to skip) and topic was “My Ambition.” I spoke for my designated time and walk down to great applause but that wasn’t what I was searching for. I was searching for my teacher and wanted to tell her\n\n“It was a big deal to walk up and speak”\n\nAnd she saw me and told me to wait and my name was called to go and collect the prize and that was my first sense of achievement because I can gloat this all my life that I did it and did it all by myself. Years later, after passing out school when I asked the teacher why she said that to me, she said something which is inscribed in my head forever, I quote her\n\n“You held your dignity for 2 mins when you had a choice to escape, that speaks volume of your upbringing. I wanted you to have the fire within you and make you realize that sometimes its OK to put your pride at stake rather than saying its fine.”\n\nThat was my moment in life and no one in this world would seize that because I learnt it my way.\n\nToday, I am part of Pre-sales and sales where my job is to communicate day in and day out and that can be via phone or emails or sometimes meetings and presentations. We wait till our MBA or graduation to improve on these skills. Often, its mistaken as a “soft skill” well knowing excel and great Data Science software’s can get you a job on desk where you will be “backbone” of the company, but you will never be the show stopper or the revenue generator of your company. By no means, I am degrading the other lot well if it is easy to talk to a client where business is at stake then everyone would be in Client servicing or sales.\n\nMost people would say that communication is a soft skill. Nevertheless, it’s a soft skill masquerading as a hard-corporate asset. That’s because in any business environment, if you can present well, you’re worth your weight in gold! Moreover, these good public speakers are the people who rise through the ranks to become good leaders. We are in a generation where we judge people basis their communication skill somewhere and for a leader if he or she doesn’t have good communication skill then he has had it for life.\n\nSpeak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue\n\nI used to take part in inter school competitions and people used to give some wonderful speeches and I used to be like ‘wow’, but no one remember them or their content and when it was my turn I spoke naturally because I spoke what they wanted to hear and above all I spoke like one of them. The credit to this goes to my father because he never wrote my speeches for Independence Day or elocution day. He made sure I researched going to the library and wrote my speech because of which I never mugged up and I spoke like a conversation or a dialogue. We see so many people today who forget some important things in a presentation either due to fear or they have a pattern or write their material in paper and speak.\n\nThere is always going to be a speaker or a presenter or you can be the one who sells experience. I rather sell an experience because experience gets you loyalty and interest and presenter get you an audience who can always get changed when someone sells an experience.\n\nNo legacy is as rich as Honesty\n\nYou might have heard people saying talk in front of mirror and rehearse. Trust me I don’t know if it works or not because I tried couple of times and looking at my ugly face I lost all hope of trying. So, I stick to my method of just keeping myself calm.\n\nMy technique or way to present is very different because I have tried and tested some methods. But what works best for me is when I don’t prepare for my presentation. I asses the audience and try and find a common chord then I tell a story connecting all because No one forgets a story teller and story lasts in your mind more than data or PowerPoint presentations. While you’re speaking people are likely on their phones, tablets, or laptops, reading emails, surfing the web, researching who you are, or maybe taking notes on your speech. It’s your job to make them put their devices down and pay attention to what you have to say.\n\nYou can’t ask them to turn off their phones, but you can make them set their phones down by creating an atmosphere that excites and engages the listeners.\n\nSuit the action to the word, the word to the action\n\nPublic speaking enhances the ability to fulfill your organizational or business needs. Your colleagues may be technically or practically brilliant. They may have great and strong ideas in mind. Yet, it is a good public speaker who can speak well in front of a group, putting over their point of view powerfully and persuasively, will outstrip others everytime. EVERYTIME!\n\nBeing a good speaker, you enhance the ability to motivate others and change their lives for a better. As we all know that words can hurt, but it can also heal, create, build and transform. For example, Martin Luther King, the leader of the Civil Rights Movement, is the best speaker of all times. Just by one speech, “I Have A Dream”, he was able to motivate all the black nations in America, change their minds, gave them hope and faith, lifted up their spirits, shake the world, convince the whites and imply a great impact on his audience. Your words are your seeds and your audience’s hearts are the ground your seed is planted. Being a good speaker, you might find yourself changing someone’s life, saving them from jumping off the cliff of their miseries.\n\nLast but not the least, being a good public speaker improves your self esteem. It also creates an aura of self confidence and self image improvement. Confidence and self esteem come from being successful and being successful comes from being a linguistic public speaker. You don’t have to be someone else on stage, all you have to do is just be yourself. Sometimes, no matter how much you believe in your message or how well you’ve rehearsed, if you don’t act like yourself in front of the group, your audience may view your speech as insincere or calculated.\n\nThe Wheel has come full Circle\n\nI went to my school recently for Independence day celebration and I saw one cute little girl who might be in her 3rd or 4th standard stand on stage and all she said with her teary eyes and chubby cheeks was\n\n“I am sorry but Thank you.”\n\nFor a min, I closed my eyes and I recalled and understood by what Shakespeare said “The wheel is come full circle.”\n\nThroughout our lives, we’re told to be a little more patient. From our parents when we complained while waiting in line for a roller coaster, from our friends when they’re taking forever to get dressed and even from our managers when we think we’re ready for a promotion or to take on new responsibilities. But how often are we really in the wrong? And how often is our impatience, well, acceptable?\n\nThe thing is, like some “bad” qualities, impatience can be a good thing in the right setting. It’s a driving force for some of the world’s most successful entrepreneurs, and one could argue nothing would get done if we never questioned how fast something should take.\n\nIf someone asks me “Choose 3 words describing yourself?” … I would be blatantly lying if I didn’t say “Reckless, Loyal and Impatient.” Yes, I did choose 2 words which are “negative” as per a normal recruiter but it is the truth. I was always told that be yourself in the interview but then we all manage to show the side which any recruiter wants to see and somewhere create an own mask. Let’s focus on the word “impatient”: Being impatient isn’t bad.\n\nPersonally speaking, I was always told that being impatient is bad since it isn’t the sign of someone with clear thoughts. Well, I never cared if my thoughts were clear if you are an individual who believes more in the process rather than the result then make sure you are impatient. No matter how much we argue, all industries are result based rather than approach based but when you are in a phase of career which demands you results on the go then being impatient is more beneficial than being patient.\n\nHere’s what I’ve learned about impatience: It’s an indicator telling me that I’m either doing something I don’t particularly care for (e.g. taking a History of Psychology test) or that I’m not fully engaged in what I enjoy doing. If I find myself getting antsy when I’m talking with a client, for example, it means that something is not running on all eight cylinders. There’s something about the process that needs attention. Why am I not feeling present? What buttons does that interaction push in me? Do other people in my client’s life also feel that way when they interact with him or her?\n\nThe other thing I’ve come to realize is that impatience goes hand in hand with intensity. If you’re an impatient person, you’re probably also an intense person. I think impatience is intensity that has gotten blocked or channeled into the wrong stream. I started my career as a research analyst and then progressed to Client servicing and the first quality you shouldn’t possess at the business side is being impatient. That’s the thumb rule.\n\nOne of my first feed backs I got from my higher authorities was that you are ‘intense’ and I took it very positively. I took it as a compliment. I want to be fully there for my clients, to be present in my interaction, to create an open space where all the feelings and emotions and insights get explored. Sure, it can feel intense, but that’s where the healing happens. I have had interactions with clients who said\n\n“All ‘ABC’ did was nod her head.”\n\nAnd they’re talking about a lack of intensity. And, of course, I bet that there are sales people who hear the opposite from their clients:\n\n“I was looking for someone who’d be quieter and just listen.”\n\nI think that intensity is not for everyone, but if I can be accepting and intense and join forces with my clients (i.e. have an alliance) then solution’s becomes very powerful.\n\nManaging impatience:\n\nI think I learned how best to use it. In other words, it was important to me that people understood my impatience was to make the team better. Maybe I did learn how to use it productively as opposed to destructively.\n\nShould others be impatient:\n\nIt worked for me because it is who I am. I don’t think it can work for everyone, although I would argue some impatience is a very good thing. If someone is not naturally impatient, they shouldn’t try to be something they are not.\n\nMy father works in a government office where patience is needed at the highest level because being impatient means you can’t get your job done. But to this day, I know him he is impatient, and it would live with him for the rest of his life. And I know why\n\nNow for people who are always told being impatient is stupid and blah blah, I have couple of arguments, yes arguments, I chose this word after lot of contemplations and it is not my point of view it is a logical argument.\n\nWhat can you do right now is what matters, not “someday”?\n\nI can vouch on my life that no top management guy would like an employee if he is slow. Intentionally slow learners are obsessed with the long term and can’t do jack in the short term because of it. I prioritise the short term, and all benefits I reap will also help me in the long term I want to know what I can do right now to make sure I am speaking better right now. This approach is so powerful and has worked so incredibly well for me and many other learners, that it drives me crazy when people get their minds clouded with long-term issues that don’t matter to them in the here and now.\n\nMy impatience to solve the biggest issues I have right now, mean that I’ll get somewhere quicker. And my awareness of how quickly I can get somewhere very useful means that I will indeed want to do this in months and not years.\n\nMy stepping stone approach: do something tangible and do it better than you did last time\n\nI have always been quoted by people that “he is too young to get promoted?”\n\nMay be in terms of experience I may be young but in terms of skill can you say that about me? I am sure you can’t because I learn most things quicker and start doing better than native doers because I am impatient, and impatience leads to curiosity and curiosity leads to desire and the desire to know better and that yields results. The keyword being results and that’s what Top MNC’s look in employees. An impatient employee who would welcome problems but above all have an approach to solve them.\n\nThat said, some of that impatience might just be a form of ambition. Maybe you’re not qualified for a position bump, but you’ve mastered your job and are ready for more responsibility, so you talk to your boss about taking on new projects. Or, you pick up a side gig. Or, you decide to learn to code so you can fix your site’s problems on your own.\n\nImpatience can be an amazing thing when it’s converted into drive. It forces you to think of new and different places to take your career, push yourself a bit further, and ultimately achieve your goals.\n\nI like impatient clients–and not just because they remind me of myself. They bring energy and intensity and purpose to therapy. They’re motivated. They have an agenda to get better and that’s exactly the energy I’m looking for. I think all of us have that intensity, to some degree, but we’ve learned to mask it. And in my experience as a therapist, often, suffocating the intensity is a large part of why a person is feeling bad in the first place.\n\nImpatience gets a bad rap, and sometimes for good reason. However, when you choose to turn it into something productive and motivating, it can have a huge, positive effect on your career. The key is knowing when it’s acceptable to push forward, and when it’s better to wait it out.\n\nFor anyone wondering the blog is called as “Live a life you will remember.” And it spoke about impatience no connection isn’t it? You don’t live a life worth remembering if you don’t push your barrier or limits. Being patient never makes you a Legend.\n\nDon’t believe me? Think about any ‘Legend” and you will see them impatient:\n\nCristiano Ronaldo: Played for Manchester United at 18 (it’s a tender age for any professional to start a football game)\n\nGautam Buddha: renounced life at the age of 29\n\nBill Gates: Found Microsoft aged 26 (It was listed publicly at 32)\n\nBarrack Obama: Became president aged 47 (he overcame 7 political layers in USA to attain his place)\n\nSo somewhere, Avicii was spot on when he wrote the song:\n\n“One day you’ll leave this world behind\n\nSo live a life you will remember.”\n\nI can’t have an opinion on what others do or want. Nor do I have the right to comment on their ambition. But, I certainly don’t want to live a mediocre life.\n\nPs: For any guys reading this please be patient when you need to take a decision regarding your marriage. IFYWIM.\n\nZidane\n\nThat’s what we called him. I was 8 or 9 and he was my Physical education teacher and my football coach. A fading bald head and the control and finesse of the French International it was just genius at work to watch him play. My teacher was my reference point to Zidane but my ideology was a man who plays football like Zidane. It was an era pre-smartphone and an era where internet wasn’t used to verify the stats.\n\nI never cared where did he play his club football nor did my friends. We never cared how old he was, or what his goals-per-game ratio was, but we loved the way he jogged around the pitch, and we loved his skills.\n\n16000 kms separated our homelands but the magic of the World Cup made him as real for us as he was for his compatriots. We knew Zidane.\n\nEveryone had an expert opinion — whether it was your uncle disgustedly muttering about Ronaldo’s ‘illness’ in the final or the bus conductor unable to hide his anger at Ariel Ortega for his moment of madness in the quarters — everyone felt a personal connection with something happening half a world away, involving countries none of them gave a damn about otherwise.\n\nFor all the controversy it courts, for all the corporate hullabaloo that it surrounds itself with, at times for all its best efforts to not do so… FIFA does get one thing right. This. The World Cup.\n\nNo other sporting event puts the ‘World’ in ‘World Cup’ quite like this one. From Palakkad to Palestine, when the World Cup is on, nothing else seems to be important. It is, as Ricky Martin so famously crooned, the Cup of Life. It is clearly a global sport and no sports comes even close to be matching the passion the world has for it. Yes, even though my mom doesn’t understand why – she still gets excited when there are tense games. There are not many sporting event that can give this feeling to any TV viewer.\n\nEmotional Ride\n\nIt’s simply more than just a sport. For many it’s a lifestyle, a cultural expression, it makes them proud of their own country, cheering for the 11 men on the field that represent a whole country. It reaches such a profound level at which we all can understand each other – no matter the origin.\n\nWe understand the feelings that everyone endures during these games. Within only a few minutes, you experience pure anger, regret, fear and hope with a tension that only builds up the closer the game between the two teams is.\n\nIt can end up in extreme tears or extreme joy. Only to be waiting for the next game and the roller coaster of emotions.\n\nMemories\n\nFor generations, the quadrennial tournament has captivated the imagination. Grown men are moved to tears at the mere mention of Dr. Socrates and his ’82 Brazilians. Wizened old veterans still talk about how you experience, and not simply ‘watch’, Diego Maradona play football. Each era has its own distinct connect with the Cup — for mine, it was Ronaldo.\n\nNo, not him. The Ronaldo. The Original. O Fenomeno.\n\nI remember Valderrama and his glorious hair, Ariel Ortega and his loco ways, Zinedine Zidane’s headers, I remember thinking no one could possibly be cooler than Roberto Baggio and, strangely, Paolo Maldini — but what I most distinctly recollect is that the sight of Brazil’s no.9 gave me a rush of visceral thrill that has remained unmatched to this day.\n\nPerhaps it’s the slight exaggerations that always accompany formative memories, but I’ve never seen anyone do the kind of things I remember Ronaldo doing on a football pitch — the sight of him dragging along a hapless Dutch defender as he bore down on goal (for long I thought it was Jaap Stam, another hero, but YouTube has since corrected me – it was Phillip Cocu) in a show of unbridled power is burned into the deepest recesses of my conscious, forming an untouchable benchmark. The word may be overused these days, but by god, was he awesome.\n\nFor others, slightly younger – or introduced to the game a little later – it’s the Ronaldo of ’02, the one with the mad triangle haircut and the toe-poked finishes, or the little one, ‘-inho’… Ronaldinho and his glorious freekick, the sight of David Seaman looking he’d seen proof of alien life leaving us gurgling with guilty pleasure. For the next generations, it’s Torsten Frings absolutely hammering in the opener in ’06, Andres Iniesta remembering his best friend in ’10 with the last goal of the tournament, James Rodriguez — all Hollywood good looks and Real Madrid seducing audacity — bursting into our collective conscious in ’14.\n\nWhatever it is that made you fall for this game, the first time will never really leave you… and every subsequent edition will lure you in deeper and deeper. Various iterations of EA’s FIFA, and Konami’s PES, along with the wonder of YouTube may have taken away from the mystery and aided in the rise of a particularly irritating brand of cynical ‘expert‘, but there still remains an element that’s unique to the World Cup — a magic that you can’t really describe, a personal connection you feel that words do little justice in describing. There’s something that’s essentially pure about the football at a World Cup.\n\nFor a month Club tribalism is left at the wayside (by most of us), teams from countries you can’t locate on a map are adopted as our own (for those on some rather high horses, you can support your nation’s struggling team – and another one that plays in World Cups regularly – with equal passion. There’s nothing wrong in that), and your entire life seems to orient itself around the Cup. Even at a time of powerful villainisation (or blatant propaganda — whichever you choose to believe), this holds true.\n\nThis edition has raised the question of morality like none other and as forced as you think it may be, we must not shy away from discussing it. In an age of unprecedented openness and communication, every avenue must be explored to talk about — and bring solutions to correct — such issues.\n\nIt is never just about the game. In ’62 it was about General Pinochet. In ’78, the Argentine military junta, in ’94 the might of the free world (3 years after the Gulf War). This year, we must question Russia about the various crimes it’s been accused of (the illegal invasion of Ukraine, the detention of political prisoners in Siberia, the support of Bashar Al-Assad, the racism) – as we should the United States in the build-up to their co-hosting the event in 2026 (the illegal invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, the detention of political prisoners in Gitmo, the support of ISIS, the racism).\n\nBut at the end of the day, none of this negativity should let us detract from the most fundamental aspect of this tournament… that there really is no greater sporting event on the planet. For all the joy it has given us, la Copa Mundial deserves that much.\n\nAnd in that spirit… here’s to a month of joyous madness.\n\nHere’s to Spain powering through the chaos and into the light. Here’s to Iceland and Panama working miracles. Here’s to Egypt and Colombia easing a nation’s pains through the simple act of kicking a ball. Here’s to Brazil remembering who they really are. Here’s to France rising above the divisions that always seem to plague them. Here’s to Belgium making the most of their Golden Generation. Here’s to England getting over the disappointments of theirs. Here’s to Germany Germany-ing the whole shindig.\n\nHere’s to Neymar, or Cristiano Ronaldo, or Lionel Messi — or Kylian Mbappe — leaving an indelible memory in the minds of a 9-year-old in a small-town half a world away.\n\nWhen I first sat down to watch Top Gun with my dad back in the 8th grade, I didn’t know the difference between an F-22 and a 777, and I could probably count on one hand the number of service members I was acquainted with at the time. It took me another 3 viewings just to understand what branch Maverick was in because I was under the impression, like most Indians, that the Navy sailed ships, the Air Force flew planes, the Army marched on foot, and the Marine Corps…well, they were an elusive branch that were just more hard core than the rest. Even though Top Gun was a little before my time, I can easily say that Top Gun shaped my adolescence and taught me valuable lessons about the military lifestyle that was so different from my own.\n\nNothing illustrates America’s complicated relationship with gender performance like Top Gun. It presents itself as military prowess, bomber jackets, and dudes bein’ dudes united against those who would oppose the American ideal (Russia, who else?). What it actually does remarkably well, if accidentally, is set up classic masculinity to fail and promises that is going to turn out fine. We don’t need it, because it’s an act. Tom Cruise takes America by the hand and says,\n\n“Gender is a performance that doesn’t matter.”\n\nThe film follows Pete Mitchell, call sign “Maverick,” a reckless and talented young pilot looking to buff up his tarnished family name by earning top honors at the elite military training facility known as Top Gun. The year is 1986.\n\nMav and his best friend Goose find themselves lucky to earn a position in a very small class of talented pilots, including rivals Iceman and Slider. Iceman has a reputation in complete contrast to Mav’s: Where Maverick is gutsy and unique, Iceman follows the rules of engagement to perfection. They compete for power in class and on the training grounds, Maverick constantly asserting himself as the best.\n\nMaverick also takes on the challenge of wooing his instructor, call sign “Charlie,” who reminds him in her own way that he is blinded by the act he tries to maintain.But Maverick finds his foundation most shaken when, during a mission, Goose is killed as an indirect result of Maverick’s showboating. While it’s not Maverick’s fault, he knows his act has gone too far and takes the brunt of the blame. He decides to quit altogether, and only when urged to get back up again for an emergency skirmish against the Russians that demands his skill as a fighter pilot does he get back behind the controls.He succeeds when he accepts Iceman as a teammate and not a rival. Iceman allows him a moment to recover his masculine act in front of the other men in the iconic final moments of the film: “You can be my wingman anytime.” Maverick lets go of his grief, throwing Goose’s dog tags into the sea, and chooses to become a flight instructor.\n\nThe story, if predictable, is a good one. I’ve watched it approximately 60 times in my life and always find myself proud of its conclusion. It may be overblown and flashy, but underneath Maverick there is a kid learning to make his way in the world just like the rest of us.\n\nNever Fire Unless Fired Upon\n\nThe world is not out to get you, so stop believing the worst of people. Believe that people are inherently good and treat everyone with loving kindness,unless they are total mean jerks. Then you have permission to fire and when you do make sure you fire hard.\n\nHey Goose, You Big Stud, Take Me To Bed Or Lose Me Forever\n\nThe busyness of everyday life can take a toll on your relationship. Make time to take care of loved ones, Spend time and above all value their time because at the end of the day you are struggling to keep them happy.\n\nSon, Your Ego Is Writing Cheques Your Body Can’t Cash\n\nLetting go of ego is difficult but good for your soul; rather than feed an inflated sense of self, come face-to-face with reality. Remember pride goes before a fall.\n\nAnd You, Asshole, You’re Lucky To Be Here!\n\nWe are all lucky to be here. Every day on Earth is a good day; embrace your luckiness and count your blessings.\n\nTalk To Me, Goose.\n\nCultivate the art of conversation, and remember to listen as well. Start speaking to people, a Hi or a hello doesn’t go wasted.\n\nAre You A Good Pilot?\n\nI Can Hold My Own.\n\nGood, Then I Don’t Have To Worry About You Making Your Living As A Singer.\n\nMaking a living in the any field is very difficult; it’s a good idea to have something to fall back upon in case your dream of becoming a famous singer/ actor/ artist does not pan out but don’t let your dreams remain as dreams.\n\nYou Can Be My Wingman Anytime.\n\nBullshit. You Can Be Mine.\n\nPeople with whom you have an adversarial relationship can, in time, become people that you can trust and rely on if you show them that YOU can be trusted and relied upon.\n\nIt’s time to redefine perfection. Perfection is about mistakes. You must teach your mistakes to others so they learn them in the classroom, the boardroom, and the debrief. You must teach your mistakes to others so they don’t make them in combat, on a sales call, during a negotiation, or when fighting a fire, running a business, or leading a team.\n\nThey say be very thoughtful if you want to get a tattoo because it’s a permanent stuff and it can’t be erased. Make sure you are 200% sure that you wouldn’t have a regret ever. But, for me one of the most spontaneous decision was to get inked and probably one of the most random decision.\n\nShow me a man with a tattoo and I’ll show you a man with an interesting past”. ~ John London\n\nIts been over 5 and half months since I got my first tattoo and the experience of getting inked has been worthwhile. While people have misconceptions about the pain barrier but its your intent and desire which makes a difference. Yes, tattoos are extremely personal, pretty much permanent and should be taken very seriously!! Many of my friends have “tats” and do no regret permanently marking their bodies. Although some would like old tattoos covered up or brightened. They took their time looking into what they wanted and the safest place to get it. People have tattoos for all different reasons and meanings. The 1,000-year-old art form and the stigma against it have started to fade in the workplace, and the enterprise is building.\n\nRevelation : Certainty\n\nWhether you are a painfully indecisive person who has been mulling over a tattoo for years or you have spontaneously decided ink is something you simply have to have, everyone has that moment of pure certainty in their decision, that moment when you announce with the passion of a thousands burning suns that you are getting tatted up! You are certain it is your best idea ever, you are absolutely getting inked as soon as possible and anyone who doesn’t agree should immediately de-board your train because it’s headed straight for tattoo town — no non-believers allowed.\n\nSomething like that happened to me over a pint of beer and I zeroed down on my first Tattoo.\n\nRevelation : Self Doubt\n\nTotally understand how diagonally opposite two revelations are but the world works in mysterious ways, no? With any super high, there is the inevitable crash and after that untarnished moment of conviction your self doubt starts to creep in. Maybe you think your grand announcement was a little rash or you begin to wonder if you really love your chosen art enough to sport if for all of eternity. Also, are you even the type of person that can truly pull off a tattoo?\n\nRevelation 3 : Reason of getting Inked and the design\n\nOne of the biggest reasons for me getting inked was my passion for various things in life. While deciding on the type of design, I had to understand and also accept what I truly love and value and doing that I found 3 things which would define me. 3 things without which I can’t imagine life and probably 3 things which complete me.\n\nSymbol : Manchester United Devil Logo\n\nIf there was one thing which I have modelled my limited life it was, is and forever would be Manchester United. Manchester united is a club for some but for me it’s a way of life. My day starts with reading news about the club and following it during good and bad times and ends with contemplating when I am going to visit next to hear the Old Trafford(home ground of the club) Faithful sing their hearts out. One of my favourite chants of all time is\n\nOh when the Reds, (Oh when the Reds), Go marching in (go marching in), Oh when the Reds go marching in, I wanna be in that number, Oh when the Reds go marching in!\n\nThere is some passion or lets say some unsaid business which is left for me and the club and probably not in this life time but may be next where I would score for them right at the stretford end and remove my jersey to announce as one of their own.\n\nSymbol : Batman\n\nMy father always told me that “never let the child in you die” and years later I realized that it was a clichéd quote. One of my fondest memory of watching a movie was Tim Burton’s 1989 classic, Batman, starring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. I was only nine or ten, , but for me it was a life-changing experience. The moment when he was holding the purse-snatching thug over the side of the building and the thug frantically asks, “What are you?”, and Gotham’s Dark Knight replied in his fearsome, non-just-gargled-glass tone, “I’m Batman.” He then tossed the terrified scumbag back to the roof and leaped off into the shadows of the city. I had goosebumps when I first experienced that scene and have every time since then. That was the moment when I knew Batman was my superhero, the hero that would forever be the paramount of all heroes. None would ever compare to him and none have, save for The Doctor, who could ever only tie with him.\n\nBatman represents hope, a few people in my actual life AND Batman have taught me that with enough prep time, anything is possible. He’s a person who transcends the limitations of humanity through dedication, obsession, and sheer will-power. He is the best of humanity. Uncompromising, unflinching, unafraid, in the face of the worst of humanity. All the while being a lunatic who decided he needed to dress up as a bat, man does he have style. He is the dark knight in every aspect. He is both a genius and completely insane. His dedication goes far beyond logic and even his love toward his family and friends, but it is this extreme dedication that drives him to save so many lives. In that sense, i think he is one of the most interesting and complex characters ever created.\n\nSymbol : Peace (my mother)\n\nMy name is Prashanth and if you dissect the name then it has “Pra” + “Shanth” (yes with a ‘h’ and I am obssssed with it and not because I am a south Indian).\n\nMy mother’s name is Shanthi and with a ‘h’ and I am very particular to point out when someone misses that H. I had an unconventional childhood and I am glad I had one because I learnt the subtlest things of life pretty early. I am born to a man who left his hometown at the tender age of 16 in search of an employment in a city called as Mumbai. I am born to a woman who believed in everything what that man did. For her the life was always about my father or years later her son. There were times when she would be in catch 22 situation and she would put her arm around me and say “let go of it and respect the man”. Teenage days isn’t it? A 17 year old boy trying to prove his father wrong all the time and acting all “DUDE” not realizing the fact that he is nothing without his name.\n\nWhatever little I am today its because of my mother and I would be a fool to deny it. If there was one thing which my parents taught specially my mother it would always be\n\n“Be man of Character and value not a man of degree and riches”\n\nI try to follow it as much as I can but I am human and I do err sometimes but she says something else to it\n\n“Realize it, accept it and grow from it”\n\nWhen someone is like a potter and you being the clay and shaping your life for good how on earth wouldn’t you include in everything in your life?\n\nHow does my Tattoo look?\n\nWho said art can only be portrayed in paintings and music? Art is unlimited; it can’t be defined. Just like oil on a canvas is called art, ink on skin is called art as well. Personally, I believe that tattoos are the highest form of art. Our skins are already beautiful; they are sacred. Adding any form of drawing or letters on them is solidly artistic. Getting a tattoo requires strength and courage—the courage to tell our story through our skin, the strength to let go of the attachment to our bodies, and the strength to feel the present moment with the needle. Thus, I consider people with tattoos strong. Not only strong, but courageous and different too.\n\nGetting a tattoo is definitely not a must in life. Just like it is pivotal for me, for others the whole idea is absurd. Whether we like tattoos or not, ink should be respected as it is an expressive form of art. It’s intimate, yet at the same time global. We shouldn’t worry about the pain or what people might say. And most importantly we shouldn’t worry about getting bored of the tattoo. Tattoos on our bodies become like moles on our skin; they become an intrinsic part of us.\n\nSitting down and writing this it’s a bit awkward for me because I have had immense trouble with myself and caused a major deal of trouble to my parents and relatives. Being a hyperactive child and more importantly if you are blessed with good tongue then the line of women and trouble is never far away. Please don’t take it as a self-gloating statement its more of a self-analysis than a 20 year old somethings shot to fame. This is a letter which I want to write today so that when I am old rocking on my arm chair thinking how did I do in life, I want to read this :\n\nI hope this message has found its way to you.\n\nI hope you have managed to figure it all out, the ins and outs of life. I hope life answered all your questions and above all I hope you figured out a way to live life the way you wanted always.\n\nYou’re looking at me, the younger, and more naive, more determined, more self-righteous self; you have nothing but love and gratitude for me. You see that I am outraged at how stuck I feel. You watch me consumed by more depression, you see me struggle daily. You see the pain I carry around in my heart. You see my struggle, you see me have momentary outbursts and cry in fits of rage; and you see that I make it through. You see that I’m OK. My pain, my struggles, my issues are not what define me. You see that I make it through this rough patch, and you know that I come out stronger, smarter and more self-aware than ever before.\n\nLets look life in the same “blocks” which you defined for yourself in the same order which you always wanted:\n\nFAMILY\n\nYou have had innumerable chances but everytime you did what was told to not do but then you were man enough to never pass the buck and your parents more understanding because they let you live with your choice. Everything that has happened has lead you to this moment. Don’t change a thing. Everything worked out exactly as it should be. Remember what your Hindi teacher taught you\n\nMeans if it doesn’t happen to your will then its happening to someone up above’s will and he will never yield a path for your destruction.\n\nHopes\n\nI hope you’ve forgiven all the people who have hurt you, and I hope their pain doesn’t matter as much to you anymore. I hope you’ve filled your life with people who only lift you up, instead of the ones who constantly tear you apart. But above all of it, I hope you have forgiven yourself. I hope you have forgiven yourself for the mistakes and the bad decisions.\n\nI hope you have found the person you’ve spent your whole life looking for. I hope they are kind and treat you how you’ve always deserved. I hope you never take them for granted, and I hope they never put you in a position to do so.\n\nI hope you have kept in touch with all the people who have changed you. I hope you have kept them close, through the good and the bad times. I hope you remind them of how important they are to you, and they know how grateful you are for them.\n\nI hope you still remember me, the younger version of yourself. I hope you look back on the person I am and are proud of who that was. I hope you carry around the things the past has taught you, but do not let them weigh you down.\n\nI hope you have loved hard. I hope you have given it all to the one you love, and I hope it was enough. I hope you have managed to mend that broken heart of yours, and I hope it never falls apart again.\n\nI hope the best for you. I truly do.\n\nI hope the future treats you kindly.\n\nAnd I hope it all works itself out in the end.\n\nDespite all the constant frustration, you’ve managed to wear glitter every damn day, and hey, that’s kinda a victory, right? So, sit down and put on that CD which you always played and listen to the soothing voice of James Hetfield and sing along\n\nSo close, no matter how far\n\nCouldn’t be much more from the heart\n\nForever trusting who we are\n\nAnd nothing else matters…..\n\nLove forever,\n\nThe bearded young Manchester United die hard\n\nI am flying to my hometown tomorrow to meet my grandmother. To my grandmother, I was this cute little boy with chubby and red cheeks which she would kiss all day long and tell me how soft I was. I don’t know how she will react tomorrow, seeing me because I am not that cute child anymore and for a typical grandmother, I know what she will say.\n\nWhenever you adopt a new style or look, it’s always the initial period after the change that takes the most getting used to. Depending on how seismic of a shift you make, going from flip-flops to sneakers being at one end of the spectrum with opting for a purple mohawk at the other, the adoption period can take time for some people. Of course, growing out your beard for the first time is no different.\n\nBeards have long been linked to the ways that men feel about themselves at any given point in time. Whilst we all like to think of ourselves as individuals, wearing a beard – or indeed not – is generally influenced by a number of factors, and involves conscious decisions. The beard, for example, was once portrayed as an outward symbol of inner male characteristics. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, beliefs in the four bodily humors meant that beards were regarded as a form of bodily waste. In fact, facial hair was seen as the result of heat rising out of the ‘reins’ – the area that included the genitals! To have a thick beard suggested that lots was going on down there and, therefore, the beard was considered a reliable marker of virility and sexual potency.\n\nAlthough every guy experiments with facial hair when they’re first going through puberty, the real test comes when a man decides to fully commit to growing a beard, along with the patience, maintenance, and confidence needed to soldier on through both the highs and lows of initial beardsmanship. I am not just referring to the beard here either, although we support you in that most noble of bearded quests. Every man experiences various trials and tribulations during that first year of opting to skip regular shaving\n\nGrowing a beard has been one of the most testing phases of my life not because it was itching but because I was bothered whether my girlfriend would kiss me or not and thankfully she did or let’s put it as she does. Growing a beard definitely has its advantages and the most sought-after one would be attention.\n\nThis is my tribute to the process of “bearding”\n\nThe ‘process’ of Bearding teaches us tolerance. Tolerance to laugh off comments (sometimes meant rudely) that others may make to us about our Beards. That tolerance we learn is beneficial to us throughout many others situations in life. Perhaps that’s why they say Bearded Fathers are the best; tolerance is key for them. The Beard is hair on a man’s face, but it’s not ‘just’ hair on a man’s face. We learn valuable Life lessons in the process.\n\nThe ‘process’ of Bearding isn’t just a ‘physical’ thing our bodies do; it’s a spiritual thing too. As The Beard grows out we get to deal with folks around us more than usual, the naysayers and ‘haters’ as it were. Being able to stand up to this is as important to Bearding as being able to deal with the ‘itch!’ I’ve said it before and here’s a good time to insert it here too\n\n“When growing one’s Beard out, you learn not only about yourself, but about those around you.”\n\nThe Beard also teaches us patience. Most guys can’t grow a full, thick Beard the first time they let it grow out and they get frustrated. It’s similar to life really. As the Beard starts to grow, it’s thin or patchy in some areas, not quite unlike us as young men; lessons unlearned. As we age, The Beard matures; it thickens, fills in, and gets longer, if we let it.\n\nPatience is indeed a virtue. You can shave and hope the myth is true, and that The Beard will come in thicker and fuller, but alas it will not do so. It takes time; many years in most cases for a Beard to mature; fill in, thicken, and get longer. In life too, as we age, we learn more, become more wise (in most cases), and settle comfortably into being ‘us.’ …and ‘patience’ is something I think most of the people on the planet could use a bit more of (oh, the irony)\n\nGrowing out your Beard also shows us how much people rely on ‘appearances’ and ‘stereotypes.’ Your friends and family may ‘jokingly’ harass you, and those who don’t know us may perceive us as homeless, drug addicts, criminals, etc. It becomes very apparent how shallow human beings can be. There are those of course whom a Beard will attract and these are the real folks. Folks who see and know the importance of a Beard to a man; not just a ‘men wear beards’ thing, but betting that a guy with a full, thick, and long Beard is a more mature person then the smooth shaven guy next to him, is probably a winner.\n\nGrowing a beard is an emotional as well as mental growth and trust me it is one. From my mom calling me as a “terrorist” to a fellow colleague calling you as “stoner”, it’s a journey which every guy should go through at least once.\n\nThe Beard teaches us to relax. Life can be difficult and just taking a few moments, stroking your Beard can do wonders for you. Helps clear the thoughts, probably lowers our Blood Pressure too. Stroking one’s Beard is definitely therapeutic’\n\nThe Beard gives us Strength. It’s like going into a fight with a buddy by your side. I believe wearing a Beard helps us harness that in us which is primordially male. Think of the story of Samson in the Bible. Having had his hair cut off, he lost his ‘strength.’ It seems to give us bravery and bolster our self-image. Makes us more resolute, more honest to ourselves. It can bolster a ‘brotherhood’ with other Bearded men.\n\nThe main reason why I started growing a beard was I wanted to look like Andrea Pirlo and I tried to copy his style for months now and then I had enlightenment and the answer was\n\nFor those who blundered their way through trigonometry and calculus in high school and college, sheer mathematical genius is almost unfathomable. But Albert Einstein’s brand of genius — that rare mix of brilliance, creativity and perseverance — was arguably as important as any given intelligence quotient (IQ). We all live in a world where we prefer White-collar jobs and no matter how much we deny we have a fetish towards “professional courses.” I always wanted to be an engineer or make a career in research right from my 6th standard as my teachers figured out that I was over curious about things which made sense only to me. Being a hyperactive child, my attention levels dropped in seconds and I was always in the prowl of something challenging and thrilling all the time. In order to curb this my teacher in school gave me a special project and the challenge was only I was involved in this project. I remember the conversation till date .\n\nHer name being Pradnya Datar but we always called her Datar Teacher. One of those teachers who always found positive traits in you no matter how bad you are as a human being. Her punishments were novel and her words were Bible verses for me when I grew up. Recently, when I met her she still had that million dollar smile and gave me a warm hug as much as my mother would give me and slowly whispered in my ears.\n\n“So the young spectacled boy who rode on his bicycle has grown into a bearded man.”\n\nThat was all what I was waiting for: A word and a word from one of those people who matter to you. The conversation years back went like this :\n\nDatar Teacher : How are you Prashanth? I met your father in the market seems like you haven’t changed one bit with your concentration levels.\n\nMe : Hello Teacher, I don’t know and I don’t think about that anymore because I let that be natural and let nature take its course. But, how come you are in morning shift today? (She was my primary teacher in 3rd standard because of whom I won the Maharashtra Talent search examination)\n\nDatar Teacher : I had some work in evening so thought before I leave, I will meet you and have a word. Acha, suno you like reading right? This book is given to me by my son and its on Albert Einstein. Padhlo ek baar and tell me his story to me\n\nMe: Einstein? That’s fascinating ok teacher I will tell you about him but I am sure you know about him because you once told us how he hated to play golf.\n\nDatar Teacher : Yes, I do know about him but I want to know what you think of him. Waise bhi 120-150 page book hai tum toh ek do din mein khatam karloge aur haan take this seriously ok and report jaise likhke dikhao\n\nMe: Theek hai waise bhi Unit Test k liye time hai so time pass ho jayega.\n\nI bid adieu to her and the book she gave me was Albert Einstein: And the Frontiers of Physics. 10 minutes was all what I took to get hooked to one of the most complex human beings known to mankind.\n\nAlbert Einstein’s brand of living life was stunning. Lots to learn from. I am a big fan of Albert Einstein and though I have degrees in engineering, the reason I am such a big fan is not why he was so famous. What Albert Einstein taught me about life go way beyond his scientific achievements. He was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the general theory of relativity, affecting a revolution in physics. For this achievement, he is often regarded as the father of modern physics and the most influential physicist of the 20th century. While best known for his mass-energy formula E = mc2(often dubbed “the world’s most famous equation”), he received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. The latter was pivotal in establishing quantum theory within physics. But my learnings from the project was much more than his thought process or his achievements. I learnt lessons of life through Einstein.\n\nKeep Striving hard\n\nEinstein was often frustrated with the state of his times and felt that the world would require a substantially new manner of thinking to survive. But that did not mean he was without hope. He knew that rules of the game as much as the next guy and an important rule was always to keep pushing.\n\nMy lesson learned is to keep going despite indifference, and even when I feel discouraged with my work.\n\nWorking in software industry has never been easy as the rewards are comparatively less and pressure and stress is more but this thought sometimes kept me pushing for more and more and thankfully kept me grounded in professional terms and never take my position for granted.\n\nSmiling never goes waste\n\nEinstein had a very good way to make people laugh. To him, it was a serious business, indeed. He made people think while making them smile with almost all of his work.\n\nMy lesson learned is to not take myself so seriously. And laugh often.\n\nStand up for your beliefs\n\nAlbert felt that the world was dangerous not because evil people but because of people who recognize the evil, yet do nothing about it. His characterization of the age was that world leadership had developed a perfection of means yet had a significant confusion of ends.\n\nMy lesson learned is to be passionate about helping others and sharing the light.\n\nTell your story\n\nEinstein’s view of a person’s life was that the true sign of intelligence was not knowledge but imagination and he believed that the only source of knowledge was experience. He loved telling stories to influence.\n\nMy lesson learned is to practice curiosity and imagination as often as possible and learn continuously.\n\nSense of humor\n\nEinstein often stated that his secret to creativity was knowing how to hide his sources. He felt that the difference between stupidity and genius was that genius had its limits. Einstein liked to say that only 2 things were infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and he wasn’t sure about the former.\n\nFocus on the Present\n\nWhat a great example Einstein uses to illustrate the importance of focusing on the present. We can miss the pleasures of the present by becoming too preoccupied with the past and/or future. Reminding ourselves daily to be present will bring us more peace and joy as well as provide us with a greater appreciation for life.\n\nThe next time I met my teacher and I explained her most of the things above and she very smartly asked me “did you like what you read ?”. My answer was “hell yeah” and just like every teacher she said to me\n\n“Prashanth, even the most complicated of subjects can be mastered by slow, progressive, focused learning. After all, if the brilliant Einstein could not focus on more than one thing at a time, what are the chances that anyone could?”\n\nI understood why she gave me this project and probably this is why this will remain my favourite research topic all my life.\n\nOne of the biggest complaints which most of our parents have towards us is the fact that we are not as hardworking as they used to be. Well, there are various ways to go about it and one of them is a very valid argument of “Working smart” over “Working hard”.\n\nLife is definitely not a bed of roses but for people like me we can sleep even if the bed has thorns because we are “LAZY”. One of the biggest complains my mum has towards me is\n\n“A banyan tree can grow from his ass but he won’t get up and do the job”\n\nWell, I disagree with banyan tree part but agree with her on me getting up from the bed on most days. Ideal weekend for me would be lazing around on the bed with my parents giving right from food to my laptop on my bed and I live like an emperor with nothing to do. Couple of my relatives have even told my mom on how she is spoiling me and for all their opinion I have a very simple answer :\n\nIf any of your friends or relatives or even your parents say that Lazy people can’t go ahead in life then it’s absolutely not true. I completely agree with their fact that you do need to put in efforts but more than the title of “smart work”, I would want to categorize it as “Effective hard work”. Ideally some people define it as one way to call smart work but it’s not its more with understanding the purpose of doing the work and getting the job done once it for all rather than doing the same job again by same method. Probably, one of the biggest advantage of working in a software company has been the ruthless manner how machines replace human beings and the logic is simple there : whoever you are if you don’t carve out a niche for you then you are replaced.\n\nFor people who think only hardworking people survive this ruthless behavior then you are wrong. Apart from a research report from HBR, so called lazy people survive this onslaught more than anyone else because “since they want to remain free they keep finishing their job in a much quicker time”. Also, when they are finishing they find ways to reduce the time taken for same work because : Boredom. These people make great strategic thinkers and leaders. They do things in a smart way in order to expend the least effort. They don’t rush into things, taking that little bit of extra time to think and find the shortest, best path. They question, contradict, and show dissent against inefficient methods or unnecessary tasks.\n\nHow could laziness be an advantage?\n\nHow could laziness be an advantage in business? First off, it’s not laziness in the way you typically think. Because diligent employees are so focused on steady, productive action, they often act first and think second. They do incredibly well when someone else has thought through the strategy of what they’re doing and prescribed a plan for action. But if the strategy still needs some thought or is incomplete, this type of employee usually won’t pause to think through things first and create their own.\n\nBut today’s modern industry requires less of that and much more creative, innovative, problem-solving output, which requires something other than diligence. It requires a different skillset, an ability to look for efficiencies, shortcuts and—honestly—ways to do less work, all things a lazy mindset is predisposed to seek out.\n\nLaziness drives Creativity\n\nA lazy mindset is always looking to simplify the process of doing things… anything. It doesn’t just get down to work—it questions first. And questioning sits at the root of creativity because it allows for open-ended options, rather than the closed loop of an instruction. If we want innovation and efficiency (and we do), we need to be open to “thinking lazy.”\n\nHard work isn’t the same as smart or effective work.\n\nA team efficiently cuts their way through a forest only to have the leader rise up above the canopy and say, “We’re in the wrong forest.” It’s a parable warning about the bias toward hard work over smart or successful work. Sometimes a lack of action, or delayed action and a little more thinking first, is precisely what we need to ensure that our team is working effectively, not just hard.\n\nObviously no one wants employees who coast along, just riding the coattails of their hardworking co-workers until the job’s done. But maybe employees who seek the path of least friction, who have a “lazy” way of thinking, of doing things, are an asset we should embrace.\n\nThink results, not activities.\n\nThink return on investment (time spent versus money earned ratio) rather than busy work.\n\nThere are better ways of working. Don’t restrict yourself to a certain set rule of doing things just for the sake of status quo.\n\nLazy people are naturally enlightened masters.\n\nNormal people pay money to learn how to meditate, then spend a week in different yoga positions which will leave them tired for another week. Lazy people spend so much time just happily staring into space, there minds a complete void of any content whatsoever, that they generally cross the enlightenment zone in the early stages of their life.\n\nLazy people don’t expect anything much of others.\n\nThis is the greatest thing about lazy people. Unlike all the other demanding people that never seem to get out of our face, us lazy people want only one thing from you: call and order pizza.\n\nWe lazy people are a pretty easy bunch to please.\n\nSo the next time you feel like calling lazy people ‘a blot on humanity’, think long and hard whether its worth it. Because we lazy people are of too much benefit to the world.\n\nThey are more relaxed\n\nLazy people don’t rush everything and don’t jump from one thing to the other all the time. They take the time and get to task after task. While some people panic, their attention get distracted and they don’t fully commit to tasks. Lazy people, on the other hand, have fewer worries and calmly do their jobs.\n\nThey know their goals\n\nLazy people know how to prioritize and to focus on their own goals, not on those imposed by other people. They are simply too lazy to pay attention to other people’s priorities, so they focus on their own. Besides, they spend much less time achieving these goals, as they will have more time to relax then.\n\nSlowing down and doing nothing at all is sometimes the best use of our time. In today’s society the words busyness and business have become one in the same. We think that if we’re not running errands, attending meets, going to work, or inputting information we are somehow being lazy. Yet, without lazy people we would not be where we are today.\n\nBeing lazy can be a beautiful thing if you let it. If you invest in your laziness and refine it, it can give you the most valuable commodity we have…more time. Lazy dudes may be the true masters of the world. Even Yoda might acknowledge them. You never know.\n\nWell, if I explain this to my parents then may not be that lazy to ask me to get out of home and in the meanwhile wish you all very happy Monday and a great week ahead."
