        "text": "New Company. Same Great Products.\n\nArecont Vision Costar, LLC is a US-based company founded in 2018 to offer complete video surveillance solutions to customers around the world. AV Costar’s headquarters, R&D, and support operations are in Glendale, California in the Greater Los Angeles metro area. Our manufacturing is nearby in Duarte, California, while our Advanced Technology Center is located in the city of Clovis, in California’s Central Valley region. Sales offices are located throughout the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East.\n\nIn July, 2018, the original Arecont Vision, LLC was acquired by Costar, a US corporation that designs, develops, manufactures, and distributes a full range of proven products for the video surveillance and machine vision markets. The executive leadership, most employees, and all of Arecont Vision’s technology, trademarks, and patents are now part of the new AV Costar. Manufacturing, sales, support, and all other functions continue as before, serving our customers around the world.\n\nRMA Return Center\n\nFor AV Costar RMA support, please contact us by one of the following methods:\n\nBy visiting this page on our website: https://support.arecontvision.com\n\nBy phone number: +1(818) 937-0700\n\nBy email: [email protected]\n\nThe Total Video Solution\n\n& Contera™\n\nOur premier offering is the AV Costar Total Video Solution™, composed of advanced megapixel cameras, cloud-enabled video management systems, recurring-revenue generating web services, and network-managed video recorders.\n\nThe 2018 launch of the AV Costar Total Video Solution represented a major new strategy for our business, culminating in the birth of our new company itself, AV Costar. With the announcement of the Total Video Solution we also introduced our newest brand name, Contera.\n\nContera is an anagram of Arecont, a reflection of AV Costar’s new way of thinking. We are focused on building on the knowledge and experience of the original company to produce something even better for our customers. Contera is a portfolio of software and hardware families that combine with the proven MegaIP™ brand of megapixel cameras to together form the Total Video Solution.\n\nMade in the USA\n\nWe are committed to quality products, with the most advanced features and capabilities for our customers. Most AV Costar products are designed and manufactured in the United States. A subset of our products are designed in the US but assembled elsewhere.\n\nMegaIP cameras (MegaBall, MegaDome, MegaVideo, MegaView, MicroDome, and SurroundVideo), ConteraCMR recorders (3 of 4 models), and both ConteraVMS and ConteraWS software families are Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. §§ 8301-305) and Federal Trade Commission Made in USA compliant with few exceptions.\n\nThose same AV Costar products are also compliant with the “Presidential Executive Order on Buy American and Hire American” for manufactured goods (click to view online at whitehouse.gov), as signed on April 18, 2017.\n\nContact AV Costar for more information on product and accessory compliance.\n\nDownload the made in the USA compliance statements Learn about our NDAA compliance\n\nAmerican-Made\n\nQuality & Design\n\nFor customers in the United States, if you are planning video surveillance camera purchases, please select your designed and built in the USA choice, AV Costar. AV Costar offers the widest range of Made in USA megapixel cameras with our Mega series, as well as with our software options and many of our NVR/server platforms.\n\nCustomers both inside the United States and around the world can trust AV Costar for award-winning products and customer service proven worldwide for true Made in USA quality and innovation.\n\nContinued Industry Leadership\n\nAV Costar continues our legacy of designing the best, most advanced, and highest reliability megapixel video products in the industry. Our list of industry firsts demonstrates this ongoing commitment, unmatched by any other vendor.\n\nWe began our R&D efforts in 2003, manufacturing in California the industry’s first two-megapixel IP network camera by 2004. Just two years later we released the industry’s first multi-sensor camera, and we still lead this segment with advanced capabilities and in sheer number of model choices. Our remote-setup SurroundVideo® Omni G3 released in 2017 is an example of our continued leadership, as is our latest offering – the feature packed, high performance ConteraIP™ multi-sensor camera unveiled in 2018.\n\nLearn more about our leadership, products, and technology by visiting our Products page.\n\nIndustry Recognition\n\nAt AV Costar, we strive to be the best at everything we create, as we look for new ways to drive the video surveillance industry forward. We’re extremely grateful to have been awarded so many times for our industry leadership, technology, products, support, and our people.\n\nGo to Awards\n\nProduct Quality & Support\n\nAV Costar remained a leader in the introduction of new, leading-edge technologies and products throughout the company’s history. While the company made commitments to product quality and after-installation support, those leading-edge products sometimes still made things challenging for our end user customers and our authorized security dealers and integrators.\n\nIt’s an entirely new world now with the launch of AV Costar. Our executive leadership and the entire company are committed to ensuring customer satisfaction, and in continuing to invest additional resources into our Quality Assurance, Inside Sales and Technical Assistance Center customer support teams and processes.\n\nWe’ve made big improvements through investment in new systems including our new Customer Support Portal powered by Zendesk and overhauling our practices and procedures. We've enhanced our back office systems for increased efficiency with the implementation of NetSuite ERP and added an updated Partner Portal. AV Costar also completely overhauled our Global Supply Chain and Manufacturing processes, including opening a new manufacturing facility in Los Angeles County in the city of Duarte and adding our Advanced Technology Center in Clovis, CA. And we're making continued investments in our people, through training and the addition of more technical support and development team members and resources company-wide.\n\nMegapixel Imaging... Worth a Thousand Words\n\nWe’ve been successful because our customers value AV Costar® products and our market leadership.\n\nAV Costar has delivered over 3.5 trillion pixels from our cameras sold around the world since our journey began in 2003. We hold over a dozen patents for our industry-leading technology, which helps account for the many industry firsts we continue to deliver.\n\nDownload Testimonials Brochure"
