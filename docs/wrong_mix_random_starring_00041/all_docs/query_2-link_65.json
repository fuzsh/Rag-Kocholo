        "text": "What an amazing year this has been. Haven’t got used to writing ‘09’ in the date and the year is over already! Here’s a look back at the year that was my best yet.\n\nI clocked record number of hours sitting in front of my computer, doing stuff that has made this year a memorable one. Kept thinking about this girl who barely knows i exist. Wanted to shoot a short film, but couldn’t get past an idea. Downloaded stuff worth a million illegally. I spent very little time with family, especially with mum and dad. I know i should talk more with them but talk about what? Okay not gonna talk any more about this stuff as it demands a blog entry of its own. Have improved considerably with my English. And my hair-line has been receding pretty fast now. If i continue with this pace, I’ll have to opt for hair-transplant surgery at the age of 22, yikes! Haven’t grown a mm over the last 12 months, have reached the pinnacle. Lets get to the top things that happened to me in 2009.\n\nfacebook & twitter:\n\nI had been using Orkut for quite a while now and wanted to give facebook a try. I signed up and i hated it. It found it to be really confusing (now i wonder why?) compared to the no-hassle Orkut. Then it slowly grew on me and guess what, I can’t but visit it at least once a day. I’m addicted to this baby and no longer enjoy using Orkut. And jus when i thought this was the ultimate social networking site, i had a tryst with twitter. My facebook page.\n\ntwitter is the coolest site to literally follow the people you adore. I would be very happy if more people start using it actively as it is a great medium to stay connected. I don’t update my status often (jus like this blog) as no one’s following it anyway but i read others’ tweets. My favourite tweeters: Roger Ebert, Chetan Bhagat, Rajeev Masand, Kris Tapley, Anne Thompson and Jason Reitman. Seriously, is there a better way to start a day than Genelia wishing you Good Morning! ?\n\nFollow me on twitter. But my page is so dead. Can you hear the echo?\n\nAvatar:\n\nYes, you read it right. This movie was one of my top obsessions this year. That doesn’t meant it’s my favourite. The wait for the movie was sweeter than the movie itself, but that view of mine may change after i watch it again on 30th. Spent a lot of my time over it. Wasted? maybe, but its jus like being in love, you live for present.\n\nThought of putting up the poster here, but they are all pathetic.\n\nLinsa:\n\nUmm.. nothing happened actually, nothing significant. But a day hasn’t gone by without me thinking about her. My friends are gonna give me dirty looks for saying this but seeing her was the only thing i looked forward to in college. It was an on/off thing for the last few months but after a lot of thinking I’ve made up my mind, It’s over (like it ever took off). She’s not gettable and i think i am wasting my time here.. Was i barking up at the wrong tree? Maybe. Jus like thalaivar said, “Kaadhal oru kadal maari da, athey maranthutu tumbler’kul neechal yenada?” But what will i do when i see in college when classes start again? Fall in love all over again? I couldn’t help myself till now. Let’s see what 2010 has in store for me. For now i have my fearless Taylor Swift to give me company, she belongs with me.\n\nWanted to put her picture here (yeah i have loads) but, it would be way too audacious of me. And quite indecent.\n\nPriya’s Wedding:\n\nOkay let’s start with a confession, you are the first person to read it.\n\n“When i was staying in Jammu with mum and dad i missed my sister so much i used to cry at nights.”\n\nNow that I’ve told someone about it i feel different. I’ve never told her how much i love her, and now it struck me that I’ve never said “I love you” to anyone in my life. Never to my mom & dad either. Even to the girls i proposed all i said was “I have a huge crush on you”. Back to the point, my sister getting married was a high point this year. Really happy for her. Here’s wishing her a long and prosperous wedded life.\n\nMovies:\n\nThis year was a very good one for movie buffs. Almost all the blockbusters released in India with not too much of a delay. All the movies i saw in theatre viz. Watchmen, Star Trek, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, Up, Inglourious Basterds and Avatar, were at Sathyam Cinemas. Except for the last one, I saw all the movies with Arjun and to make up for it I am watching the same movie with him again anyway. And all the countless movies i saw alone at home. And with the Oscar race that has already started, I’ve begun watching all the movies that are in-contention.\n\nHope the year was great for you too.\n\n“WISH YOU A HAPPY NEW YEAR!“"
