Thanks!”\n\nTig introduces the US Doc jury.\n\nJuror Kristen Johnson: “This jury spent 8 hours in deliberation. You may imagine it was because we were fighting. But it was a love-fest, and every one of us wanted to discuss every film in the competition. “\n\nJuror Eugene Hernandez: Eugene: “At its core the Sundance Film Festival is about discovery.

We wanted to present this experiment in as truthful a way as possible.”\n\nUpdated at 7:27 p.m.\n\nStarting the evening off with the psychedelic teaser that’s preceded every screening during the Festival.\n\nHere comes Tig Notaro.\n\nTig is wearring a beige blazer and blue jeans and stalking the stage like the stand-up comedian she is.\n\n“I think I was the obvious choice to host. Considering I’ve only seen Grease and Star Wars. I actually used to volunteer at the Festival. In the mid-to-late 90s.”\n\n“If someone had pulled me asked and said you’re outside in the freezing cold and living on cheese and crackers. Come here I have some news, in just 17 years you’ll have a movie about your life premiering at the festival and the same year you’ll be hosting the awards, I’d be like ‘Yeah, I know.'”\n\n“I was instructed to do old material. But I’m not just going to do old material, I’m going to do my oldest material. My very first comedy routine.” A joke about her name, conflated with “pig” and “tit.”\n\n“So I’m going to tell my very first joke written when I was ten years old. What consists of a navel army? Bellybuttons.”\n\n“Congrats to everybody here. You did it, we did it, you’re amazing.”\n\nTig introduces Keri Putnam.\n\nUpdated at 7:00 p.m.\n\nFor several years running, and thus now traditionally, the Awards Ceremony takes place a few miles north of Park City at the Basin Recreation Fieldhouse at Kimball Junction. We’re about half an hour away from the ceremony, and people are filing in, partaking of the buffet, and pigeon walking to the soul tunes that are echoing around the room.\n\nThis year the airy, Space Shuttle-accommodating Fieldhouse hangar is decorated sparingly, which is in keeping with 2015’s minimalist design. Outside of a few projected pinwheels against the rafters, the only discernible decoration is a giant circle against the back wall of the stage. There’s a subtly shifting glow emanating from behind the circle, which is also the place from which the host and presenters will emerge. Even the monitors that flank either side of the stage stick to the circular theme, with rounded images from this year’s films eclipsing one another.\n\nThis year’s host is popular stand-up comic and documentary subject Tig Notaro. In the film Tig, which screened as part of the Documentary Premieres category, directors Kristina Goolsby and Ashley York follow Notaro during her L.A. concert, which helped her to cope with both her battle with breast cancer and the unexpected death of her mother. She’s got her work cut out for her if she wants to out-bawdy last year’s hosts, Megan Mullally and Nick Offerman, but something tells me she’s up to the task.\n\nAs the Festival comes to a close, our minds go back to the start, way back to Thursday, January 20, when Festival founder Robert Redford, flanked by Festival Director John Cooper and Sundance Institute Executive Director Keri Putnam, discussed the state of all things Sundance for the media. Referencing the Charlie Hebdo tragedy in Paris, he said, “I think freedom of expression seems to be in danger in a lot of areas. But as far as we’re concerned, we will do everything in our power to keep it alive.” Looking back on the week, it’s clear that the 2015 iteration of the Festival has done just that.\n\nAmong the 124 narrative and documentary features in this year’s slate, several films transcended the trade and entertainment pages and became news items of their own. Alex Gibney’s Going Clear, an expose of the Church of Scientology, has had people talking and filing all week, and has sent the Church’s marketing and social media departments working overtime to counteract the bad press. Meanwhile The Russian Woodpecker has become something of a minor sensation with its assertions that the Soviet-era Chernobyl leak was an inside job, with the Ukraine still paying the price for Russian malfeasance. Other bracingly uncensored films included the FBI informant doc thriller (T)error, Censored Voices, Cartel Land, and Kirby Dick’s The Hunting Ground.\n\nHang right here for just a few more minutes, as this year’s Awards Ceremony is about to begin."
