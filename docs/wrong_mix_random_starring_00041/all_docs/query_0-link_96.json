        "text": "Ans:\n\nDear SK,\n\nSo, you want to marry a man who cheats, hides his escapades, and disrespects you?\n\nWhat kind of life do you think you are going to have with a man who has no respect for women and sleeps with women to gain his self-esteem?\n\nTalking about how you can be a saviour, only makes you a victim, so that you are constantly under his control.\n\nIt’s possible that you haven’t been able to see his intentions and that you have reached out to me.\n\nListen, you have a beautiful life ahead, so not waste it on a man who thinks of nothing and only himself.\n\nYour friend also was able to sell you out so easily only suggest that this man is some sort of a charmer and women easily fall into his trap.\n\nBeware, kindly step up first and respect and honour yourself.\n\nLearn to Love yourself else you will keep falling into the same trap of falling for such men who have nothing to do with women other than use them.\n\nStep out NOW and no explanations required…You are not obligated to give him any.\n\nHe will behave like a victim and place you on a pedestal so that you go back to him, STAND your GROUND…Love is pure and this cannot be your first or last love….selfishness cannot be love.\n\nThere are more beautiful relationships waiting to embrace you only if you first move on from this toxic relationship, love yourself and use your strength appropriately.\n\nYou can do this…be an example for all those girls who choose to celebrate men who are toxic to them. Be a source of strength to all of them.\n\nAns:\n\nDear Unknown,\n\nIt seems like you have moved away in mind and heart.\n\nIt does happen in few relationships as there might have not been a strong emotion attached when the relationship began, or the emotion ceases to exist as you have moved on and changed.\n\nGood or bad? Neither…it happens.\n\nBe rightful and do not lead him on.\n\nIt is not his fault that you feel the way that you do. But you do owe it to him to tell him how you feel now, so that he is not living in a love bubble.\n\nSo, break it to him gently and wait for his response. It maybe anger, sadness, disappointment.\n\nBe with him through the process. He may not want to speak with you for a while till he gets a chance to process it fully; accept that. He may blame you; accept that as well.\n\nIt is not your fault, but he will not have any other safe space to vent out his feelings. And once this stage has passed, discuss it very maturely together as to what the next steps can be.\n\nTill then, it will be only you dealing with this in the relationship when it has to be the business of both.\n\nAnd as far as sexual issues go, I don’t find any relevance of it as age gap never hurt anyone’s sex life.\n\nAnd what do his relatives have to do in your relationship? It’s the two of you (if you choose to be together mutually) and anyone else is just an unnecessary add-on piling on to make more mischief. Draw boundaries and live happy.\n\nNow, time to come out clean and then maturely process and decide the future course of action.\n\nMy best wishes to you!"
