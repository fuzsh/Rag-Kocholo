        "text": "Despite all odds, the world’s oldest film festival kicked off proceedings earlier this week in Italy. The 77th Venice Film Festival opened with a stronger than usual resistance to the encroaching power of streaming giants, with everyone from Oscar-winning actor and president of the jury Cate Blanchett, to legendary Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodovar talking, sense and sentimentality about the big screen experience.\n\nWhile that tussle goes on, the fact that film festivals are back in action is a good sign for industries around the world that have begun to recalibrate. And for the makers of independent, arthouse films: Chaitanya Tamhane’s The Disciple (backed by his mentor Alfonso Cuaron) heads to Toronto International Film Festival after bagging a FIPRESCI award at Venice. Ivan Ayr’s Milestone also opened to glowing reviews at Venice; while Prashant Nair’s Tryst With Destiny scored an award for the best screenplay earlier this year at a virtual competition section from Tribeca. What comes next, as film production resumes and theatres open up? Tamhane, Ayr and Nair are cautiously optimistic, and demonstrate the way forward with their own work.\n\nChaitanya Tamhane\n\n33, Mumbai\n\nCourt (2015), The Disciple (2020)\n\nCase study: Five years ago, Chaitanya Tamhane caused a stir with his debut Marathi feature Court, in which he presented a fly-on-the-wall perspective of the goings-on in an Indian courtroom. It won instant critical acclaim worldwide, and very quickly, he ascended to the upper crest of storytellers leading Indian indie’s new wave, a tiny forceful movement that would eventually break out with the arrival of OTT platforms. Now, with his sophomore feature, The Disciple, premiering at both Venice and Toronto film festivals in competition, Tamhane makes history: Apart from the fact that it's the first Indian film in 20 years to compete at Venice's main competition; his will be the first Indian film screened in a theatre since the pandemic shuttered all activity, anywhere in the world.\n\nTen ragas to a disco beat: The Disciple is a Marathi film “set in Mumbai in the world of Indian classical music, which is a very dynamic subculture here. It’s the journey of an Indian classical vocalist, who’s been raised by his father on stories about these great masters and this ‘secret knowledge’ – a romantic notion of classical music - all rather traditional concepts and values. And heʼs trying to make a career and trace his path in contemporary Mumbai.” Tamhane quickly adds that the film is not about the glamorous superstars of the scene, it’s very much about the struggling sort.\n\nLabour of Love: Tamhane says he was working on another script in 2015 when, out of nowhere, “the bug bit me really hard and I was suddenly enamoured by this world.” He attended concerts, read books like Namita Devidayal’s The Music Room, watched documentaries (and found most to be overflowing with reverence). He travelled all over the country “with no agenda” and befriended musicians: Endless conversations with the rudra veena player Bahauddin Dagar; upcoming musicians like Hriday Desai from Ahmedabad; the musician, tabla player and writer Aneesh Pradhan, who eventually became indispensable to the project, from designing the music to consulting on production design and casting.\n\nPartner in rhyme: The Disciple is also a “spiritual successor” to a play that Tamhane wrote at age 21, Grey Elephants In Denmark, led by his longtime collaborator Vivek Gomber, as a magician/mind-reader. Gomber produced Court and now also The Disciple; or as Tamhane puts it: “We have pulled every last drop of blood and sweat and resource that we had into this film. I don’t know if I’ll get to make another film, certainly not with this very real kind of insecurity around. It’s never about just making a film, it’s about making a film on your own terms.”\n\nA class apart: In 2016, Tamhane was selected as Alfonso Cuarón’s protégé as part of the prestigious and exclusive Rolex Mentor and Protégé Arts Initiative. Part of the programme involved spending time on the sets of Cuarón’s Oscar-winning Roma. “I was like a kid in a candy store: The set-up, the scale, the elaborate nature of everything, and at the same time, Alfonso’s precision, eye for detail, complete command over the medium!” Tamhane gushes. “Personally, I thought it was a very strict set, shrouded in secrecy. I was the only one who had the script, nobody else in the entire crew of the film had it. I was gifted this secret that weighed so heavily on my soul; it was like a big act of trust.”\n\nWhile Cuarón demanded magic and mind-reading performances of his disciple at dinner and birthday parties (heʼs practised both for years), Tamhane rolls his eyes at how he himself would “go on and on about the connection between magic and cinema.” “But Cuarón is a magician in his own right,” he says. “He taught me to be a professional film-maker.”\n\nWait and watch: “The problem is that, when this kind of situation arises, budgets for the arts are the first to be slashed,” Tamhane says. “But everyone is hungry for more content. We’ve also slowed down a little bit, so we might be more conducive to watching something with a different pace. I feel there is curiosity and a demand for different kinds of stories. So I don’t want to be too pessimistic, but it’s more about where in the pecking order the independent scene will lie. Plus, if there’s one thing this year has taught us is to not predict things and not take things for granted.”\n\nPandemic playlist: Before things went into hyperactive mode with The Disciple, Tamhane decided to revisit the classics. “I watched Fellini’s Amarcord again and was like, this really is a masterpiece. I saw [Akira Kurosawa’s] Rashomon for the first time and was in awe.” His favourite platform, he says drolly, is the movie screen at a theatre, but does recommend Sanal Kumar Sasidharan’s controversial S Durga on Mubi for those keen on a dose of new Indian indie.\n\nIvan Ayr\n\n37, Chandigarh\n\nSoni (2018); Milestone (2020)\n\nFirst Act: Two years ago, Ivan Ayr made a splash with his debut feature, Soni, which premiered in the Venice Film Festival’s Horizons section (the only Indian film at the festival in 2018). A small film by any measure, it was a subtle, powerful character study of two women cops negotiating sexual and power politics in Delhi’s rough and rowdy streets. Featuring sharp performances by Saloni Batra and Geetika Vidya Ohlyan, Soni got accolades from the wider fraternity and, quickly, a spot on Netflix in early 2019 – where it rose to prominence and became one of the most recommended films, with its fair share of word-of-mouth hype.\n\nThe big premiere: Ayr’s sophomore feature, titled Meel Patthar (Milestone) has premiered once again earlier this week in Venice’s Horizons section. “It’s a special, honourable platform for young film-makers, new voices. But this year, there are some very experienced film-makers in competition,” – Martina Parenti and Massimo D’Anolfi, for instance, who’ve been nominated for the coveted Orizzonti prize in the past – “so it’s a bit scary,” he laughs.\n\nOn the road: Meel Patthar is “the story of a truck driver, a character study like Soni, about his past and present life, and of his attempt to find his place in a rapidly changing modern India.” Ayr was fascinated by the lives of some relatives who have been truck drivers themselves, and are now “just transporters”, and wanted to explore it. He wrote the film while living in San Francisco – he returned to India in 2019 after 12 years in the US – and had initially wanted it to be an Indian immigrant story. But he changed his mind upon his return, deciding that the idea of a truck as “home within a home within a home” and that quest might be more intriguing if set here. With the support of Kimsi Singh (who also produced Soni), Ayr shot the film in February this year on a budget, because he wanted that special winter aura to the space. And he located it in Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar, adjoining the NCR, which he calls “a world of its own”.\n\nOrigin story: Ayr’s journey with film-making began while at engineering school in San Francisco. Hanging out with the theatre and film school crowd at his university, he was introduced to European masters like Krzysztof Kieślowski, who is still one of his biggest influences. He’d been introduced to David Lynch and Alfred Hitchcock before he left India, but university introduced the idea that “film-making is not something only accessible to the rich and elite”. “It’s a very expensive medium of art, and I wish for more opportunities for young film-makers, but at that point I realised that it’s possible to make short films, at the very least, to express your voice.”\n\nUn-Lessons: Ayr says he’s come to disagree with the idea that the script is the most defining aspect of a film. “I feel that there are many things that can have a profound impact on the viewer other than the story,” he says. “I treat film-making as a medium of philosophy, and lately I’ve been wondering if its motive can be more than just to tell a story. Can it invite a viewer to imagine things not in the story, and can it leave you with questions?”\n\nTo be continued: For Ayr, the differences between the arthouse and mainstream are more subtle than they appear. Especially at a time like this, “It’ll be the same for everyone, I guess: Run sets with limited numbers of people, rethink the very idea of the spaces we shoot in, really pin down crowd control.” But more importantly, and optimistically, Ayr feels that the pandemic will “define the kind of stories we want to tell”. “If it’s a film about a lot of kids in school, maybe you need to wait,” he says, “If it’s a giant horror or action project with lots of explosions, I’ve no idea how theyʼd cope as I’ve never done a film of that scale. But, films like Trapped or the classic 12 Angry Men – those are the kinds of interesting, fantastic stories that I feel will take birth.”\n\nPrashant Nair\n\n43, Mallorca\n\nDelhi In A Day (2011), Umrika (2015), Tryst With Destiny (2020)\n\nEarly bird: The Tribeca Film Festival was among the first on the calendar to call curtain once the pandemic hit, but the organisers decided to hold screenings for the competition sections anyway. “The version that we sent of Tryst With Destiny was incomplete,” shrugs Prashant Nair, who drew attention some years ago for his superlative indie starring Suraj Sharma, Umrika. “The VFX hadn’t been done, for instance, as our post-work was halted.” Nair won the award for best screenplay anyway, proving that risky moves such as anthologies do pay off.\n\nRule of Thirds: Tryst With Destiny is a triptych of loosely connected stories, shot in Maharashtra and UP, “each representing a colour of the flag”, and following “three sets of characters struggling to have control of their destiny in contemporary India.\" There’s the “extremely wealthy billionaire” who’s on the cusp of everything that money can buy; the lower class couple who are struggling to rebuild their lives; and a cop in Mumbai, who’s trying to upgrade his apartment, his living conditions, for the sake of a mistress that he’s besotted by. “The film is obviously inspired by Nehru’s speech,” says Nair, “and the idea of India as a work in progress, of striving towards equality as a kind of perpetual goal. So the film playfully, and not in a very preachy way, evaluates where we are.”\n\nPatriot act: As the kid of a diplomat who grew up mostly abroad, Nair says he’s used to “representing the idea of India to people who aren't really familiar with it. And I think one of the things I’m extremely proud about, regardless of the issues we have, is that we are a secular nation.” In 2018, during a break in the shoot for Made In Heaven, of which he’s directed a few episodes, Nair recalls reading the news and feeling disturbed. “I had these three stories floating around in my head and, at that moment, it came together. I wrote the script, and I didn’t really think anyone was going to produce it. The film’s a little adventure in terms of structure. But I sent it to Manish Mundra of Drishyam Films,” – who also produced Umrika – “and he took to it, as he does, taking decisions in the snap of a finger.”\n\nOrigin story: Nair meandered into film-making at the age of 32, when he had “the chance to change careers. I didn’t even really know what I wanted to do so I thought, maybe I’ll make a film.” It’s why he thinks he entered this with a degree of naivete, and why both Delhi In A Day and Umrika were made in a “very spontaneous manner.” Only with a bit of exposure after Umrika did well in the US and India did he “start to discover a little bit more about myself as a film-maker. I started to meet people in LA, checked out the international scene a little bit too.”\n\nWarp & weft: During these years, Nair says he’s discovered that while he really loves making films, his fondness for the industry itself doesn’t quite match up. Living in Spain with his wife and children, he can “go months and months without seeing anyone from the industry,” perhaps not having as much work, but more intent on seeking out a different way of living. “For me, making films is an important way for me to discover the country that I'm born in but never actually lived in.”\n\nThe State of Things: Nair thinks the current scenario presents a double-edged sword to indie film-makers like him. “The theatrical business has never been particularly kind to indie films, so that doesn’t change much right now,” he says. “But the guys who are actually buying this content, the OTT platforms, are doing really well at this time, and they all need content with this lockdown. So I’m kind of hopeful that that will translate into a lot of indies getting acquired in the next 18 months.” A more pragmatic approach, if and when things start up again, would be “to do work in the episodic space, which is a great way to make a living between two films.”\n\nComing soon: Apart from being hooked to groundbreaking TV series like I May Destroy You and Normal People, Nair has used this time to polish his script for a series based on the Uphaar cinema tragedy in 1997 in Delhi – signed for a major OTT platform, but yet to go into production. “It’s a sort of multi-perspective look at the tragedy,” he says, “following two parents who lose their kids in it and the 20 years struggle they took on to get justice against the cinema owners. It’s another look at the institutions that fail to protect us, a David and Goliath story.”\n\nNOW READ\n\nAkshay Kumar to Narendra Modi, here are 7 personalities who joined Bear Grylls in his wild adventures\n\n15 videos and pictures that prove Akshay Kumar is fit for any adventure\n\n7 reality shows on Netflix that will make you cringe and keep you hooked at the same time\n\nMore on Entertainment"
