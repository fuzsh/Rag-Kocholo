        "text": "This symposium on heritage in modern South Asia considers what new scholarship on museums, memorialization, mourning, and archaeology in South Asia can offer the global turn in critical heritage studies. In turn, the symposium explores how non-state actors and local communities have contested colonial and national understandings of heritage and memory. Our interdisciplinary, multi-sited symposium examines heritage across South Asia and interrogates a diverse array of heritage sites in the region, including crematoriums and memorials alongside museums and archeological excavations. Building on scholarship on heritage as “a cultural and social process” for negotiating conflict (Laurajane Smith) and museums as “contact zone[s]” (James Clifford), our symposium panels reconsider the material histories of heritage sites, broadly construed, and what they reveal about contemporary debates on heritage and power. The first panel (“(Anti-)Imperial Heritage”) explores how both non-state actors and local communities have engaged archaeology and monuments in conjunction with or opposition to imperial projects, from the British Empire in India to the US presence in Afghanistan. The second panel (“Heritage beyond the Nation-State”) examines how museum exhibits and vernacular literature have conceptualized heritage beyond national borders through local and global collaborations. The third panel (“Technologies of Heritage”) addresses how different technologies, including cameras, crematoriums, and coins, can reshape understandings of heritage. The final panel (“Memorialization as Heritage”) draws together alternative heritage projects to consider counter-commemorations as interventions in heritage creation. A full day symposium would be ideal for this interdisciplinary, cross-border, and multi-sited approach and would enable the presenters to engage with different conceptions of heritage. Moreover, the Madison conference is the ideal venue for this conversation given the importance of contested historical sites in contemporary South Asia. (The scholars in our proposal who are not based in the US have committed to attending in person and applying for travel funding.)\n\nSacred sites play a major role in the religious traditions of South Asia. This is largely due to the centrality of the practice of pilgrimage, but also because of their historical significance as cultural, financial, and political centers. While sacred sites have been the subject of scholarly discussions for several decades, most of the existing work explores sacrality within the context of specific localities. In this symposium, we suggest shifting the perspective by examining sacred sites as nodal points within webs of connections. Our aim is to promote a new understanding of South Asian sacred sites as participating in relationships with each other, rather than as stand-alone monuments, by focusing on the different types of links between them (literary, historical, ritual, etc.). Identifying these patterns will enable us to formulate them into coherent models, reflective of the diverse agencies at work within the webs of connections. Thus, this symposium will provide a venue for generating new insights into South Asian notions of “sacred” and “place.” The ASAC’s symposium day provides us with a unique opportunity to bring together scholars from diverse academic backgrounds and career stages, to share their work on three broad themes: 1) Making sacred links: The elements that connect physical spaces with the notion of sacredness and those by which one sacred space is linked to others, focusing on ritual dynamics and on temple art. 2) Textual reflections on geographic sacrality: The representations of sacred sites in literature and how literature on sacred sites establishes connections between physical places. 3) Mapping territories: a. The phenomenon of mapping sacred sites in devotional, literary, and musical compositions, and the marking of connections through ritual activity. b. Incongruities between literary ‘sacred maps’ and the distribution of physical spaces, conflicting notions of ‘sacred sets,’ and expressions of intersectarian tensions over sacred territories.\n\nUntil recently, the most widely visible and thoroughly researched archives of South Asian screen culture have been selected archives of Indian cinema–typically repertoires of Bollywood and pre-Bollywood Bombay cinema or of arthouse auteur cinema. Over the past decade, the lens of South Asian screen studies has been slowly expanding to include cinematic cultures that are emergent and minoritized, navigating previously unexplored archives and adopting innovative methods and frameworks. Many of these screen cultures have been ignored or brushed aside as meaningless and tasteless entertainment. However, we believe that attunement to these cultural forms represents a more inclusive and democratic approach to screen studies in the region. This Symposium highlights peripheral screen media and those that have been minoritized by authoritarian and repressive regimes and formations. The papers explore geopolitical formations, sociosexual biases, as well as the privileging of particular media formats and access infrastructures over others. A variety of approaches are taken to screen cultures, including production and reception analysis of film, television, streaming, and other forms of narrative media. Thus, the presentations shine light on new or neglected South Asian screen productions and cultures beyond, around, or before Bollywood. A number of papers discuss methods of screen archive-building that help us to democratize the scope of South Asian screen studies. They aim to historicize the politics of cultural conservation as well as of memory and forgetfulness across South Asia. Combined, the papers examine screen cultures across the region as well as those that themselves question its borders. Ultimately, this Symposium seeks to understand how screen industries respond to, undermine, or even shape the political currents around them.\n\nMuch research on caste in Indian performing arts has focused on relationships of service-provision of Dalit-bahujan performers to dominant caste patrons in ‘folk music’ genres, or the Brahminization of classical performing arts. Such work has kept the remit of caste within the confines of ‘tradition’ or history. Newer research broadens the perspective, situating caste in the very aesthetics and embodiment of genres, in contemporary settings like recording studios, and amongst Christian and Muslim musicians. It also explores current processes and consequences of disenfranchisement, and caste assertion. This literature expands understandings of the performing arts as a site for caste dis/empowerment and exposes the continual mutations, co-options, and appropriations of caste in and through the performing arts, including in the academy. Incorporating work by bahujan, savarna, and non-South Asian scholars, this symposium looks at layered processes of popularization, assertion, resistance, cleansing, appropriation, exclusion, and disenfranchisement in diverse musical genres across regions, religions, and political divides. We examine Dalit activism in and through music. We make legacies of music-making in Muslim and Christian communities audible and prominent, centering questions of sonic democracy and the politics of sound in modern South Asia. We study how caste is learned at the levels of taste and deportment. We explore the cooption of bhakti via music to maintain dominant caste Hindus and Hinduism as normative, incorporating Hindutva as well as liberal contexts. We highlight the ‘payout’ to privileged bodies (dominant caste and white) for work that seeks to resist caste. Finally, we question how cycles of caste persistence, mutation and co-option may be disrupted, how value and benefit can be channeled into Dalit-bahujan genres, instruments, and performing bodies, and how a critical discourse and aesthetics of caste and music can be developed that does not represent another incarnation of savarna control of knowledge and discourse.\n\nIf space is fundamentally political, how can spatial injustices generate political power and construct new ways of thinking about inequities in the places where we live and work? How does mapping political agency and subjectivity of the disenfranchised in urban South Asia–in theory, method, and activism–unsettle existing frames about power and dispossession and contribute towards building a just world? Motivated by critical urban studies scholarship that focuses on regimes of violence, erasure, and agency, this symposium brings together a community of emerging scholars of urban Pakistan to build a collective understanding of exclusionary urbanization processes as the means of political agency of the excluded and dispossessed. We urge attention toward the micro-politics and encounters of ordinary life that reveal how the (un)intended effects of state policies, development aspirations, and liberal imaginaries transform everyday struggles. While the struggle to push stories of people, landscapes, and histories marginalized and othered in dominant discourses is an ongoing action, we want to think with our participants in a daylong symposium about what troubles the constructions of the marginal/ized, what is gained from attending to experiences on the ground, and how a careful and urgent engagement with alternative narratives of development and dispossession can support everyday struggles for resistance. We take contemporary calls of theorizing from the South seriously to consider what is at stake in amplifying the politics of the disenfranchised across theory, method, and activism. We propose a daylong symposium for building community and meaningful exchange of ideas among a group of emerging scholars of urban Pakistan–from diverse disciplinary backgrounds but with a shared commitment to mapping and theorizing the everyday experiences of ecological, social, and political disenfranchisement–about the possibilities of just worlds that emerge within their work.\n\nThe discursive field of the Telugu public in South India has been transforming through pivotal moments of political shifts, social movements, and literary developments. The social and political articulations in the region have been historically generative for the evolution of democratic ideals. The dynamic exchange between publics and counter-publics shaped around antagonisms of caste, class, and gender in modern history is a continuity of the longue-durée of democratic undercurrents in the region. Archives on literary, poetic and devotional expressions reflect an intellectual and cultural investment in social reform against practices of gender discrimination and caste inequality in the region. The reformist and revolutionary ideas in the region’s history have sedimented the Telugu identity and its plural imaginations in many ways. In this Symposium, we bring together upcoming and recent scholarship on the discourse and history of the Telugu public(s) through panels intersecting across scholarly disciplines. The symposium will have presentations speaking through a diverse range of material like oral narratives, literary texts, cultural activism, political histories and performance genres. The diversity in disciplinary approaches and research methods of archival, literary, religious and ethnographic studies will inform the multifaceted understanding of the Telugu publics. By bringing together around twenty scholars with a wide-ranging academic expertise, the symposium will harness the intellectual momentum that is building up on research studies and publications on the Telugu-speaking region. The attending researchers have been extensively invested in the social and political implications of their works through an informed understanding of caste, gender, class and inter-religious relations in the region. The specificity of the regional site will deeply engage with research developments and intellectual contributions in the broader fields of Deccan Studies, India Studies, and South Asia Studies, and research initiatives being undertaken by Khidki Collective, Maidaanam, and others that have been shaping the Telugu public.\n\nOur symposium advances multidisciplinary methods and approaches to the study of craft communities across the interconnected geographies of South and Central Asia. It challenges the disciplinary boundaries of South Asian area studies by exploring transregional experiences that remain outside the ambit of elite cultural networks. It brings together scholars from diverse subfields of the humanities, arts and social sciences to facilitate research dialogue on the history of cross-cultural interactions among craft communities in South and Central Asia. Our goal is to develop craftsperson-centric approaches to historiography, which affirm the subjective experiences and creative imagination of marginalized communities. Our research reorients humanistic and social scientific discourses to elaborate upon new methods and practices of transregional histories. The plurality of craftworker experiences lies at the heart of our innovative methodology. Our papers disaggregate the category of “craft” in favor of analytical readings of historical sources on specific skills, technologies, ideas, objects and communities. Beyond courtly documents and official reports, our research draws on overlooked materials and knowledge systems, which were circulating among craft communities in South and Central Asia. We propose reconsideration of the relevance of craft histories for the purposes of building an inclusive model of historiography that goes beyond imperial, dynastic or colonial sources. Our presenters elucidate alternate narratives of shared cultural heritage, community values and family lore, upending our assumptions about the reach of imperial, statist or local power. Our symposium is part of our collaborative effort to build a community of scholars, researchers and craft specialists who—on account of their research and engagement with craft communities—challenge prior historiography with a view to advancing transregional, inclusive and connected histories of South and Central Asia. We cultivate the work of early career scholars and put them in conversation with senior scholars as respondents.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a proliferation of scholarship on the Cold War’s lasting political, economic, and intellectual currents within the Global South. Indeed, what Arvind Rajagopal calls “the first metaphysical war of modern times…simultaneously everywhere and nowhere” (1. p.370) continues to cast a long shadow on our understanding of the 20th century and its anti-colonial—simultaneously nationalist and internationalist—impulses. And yet, despite the increased scholarly emphasis on the Non-Aligned Movement, Pan-Asianism, and the Bandung era, the corollary imaginative labor of this internationalist period remains under-appreciated within the study of modern South Asia. In this symposium, we propose internationalisms as alternately responding to, engaging with, resisting, and even side-stepping and refusing the Cold War and its ideological demands. Our emphasis then is on the Cold War as not just a series of geopolitical interactions with the West, but also a period of collective world building within South Asia itself. Bringing together scholars from disciplines such as history, law, literature, anthropology, art history, film studies, gender and sexuality studies, and science and technology studies, we aim to put in conversation simultaneous developments in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. In each case, we consider “individual lives” (2. p.9), geographical sites, and cultural projects as performing acts of discursive and material agency in the era of decolonization. ---------------------------- 1.

Leiden University Press.\n\nThe notion of the \"Kerala model\" has dominated Social Science and Humanities discourses on South Asia since the 1970s. High rates of literacy and progressive social development coupled with low mortality and fertility rates pitched Kerala, in southwestern India, as a model for development economists. Many scholars have identified problematic aspects of this developmental paradigm, yet the notion of \"Kerala exceptionalism,\" positing Kerala as a case study in social development, has long held sway for scholars of the region. This first-ever Kerala Studies symposium explores changes in this field of subregional studies in the context of increasing pushback against area studies. The symposium brings together scholarship that challenges and goes beyond the Kerala model, showcasing new work in the subregion and its diasporas. Our panelists come from media studies, literature, gender studies, history, art history, sociology, and the law. Composed of four interconnected panels on “activisms,” “transregional mobility,” “religions,” and “visual cultures,” our symposium features scholarship with an anti-caste, feminist frame, as we understand this to be the way forward for Kerala studies scholarship. Through these interconnected themes, our panelists engage with the continued expressions of the most marginalized in Kerala and the Kerala diasporas to fight against authoritarianism/fascism and against caste apartheid. Accordingly, the symposium speaks directly to the South Asia conference’s 2024 theme, “Democracy and Authoritarianism,” while engaging current challenges to the area studies approach and interrogating the forms taken by the critique of the “Kerala model.” The extended time of the symposium will allow participants and audience members to discuss and engage with the recommended texts and have open-ended discussion. Thus, each panel will feature 3-4 scholars speaking for 7-10 minutes about their work, followed by a Q&A session, a format we anticipate will generate a robust conversation among a diverse range of voices.\n\nDemands for Kashmiris’ self-determination has been central to Kashmir even preceding the creation of the modern nation-states of India and Pakistan, yet the authoritarian occupation over Kashmir has only increased. Over the past few decades, Kashmir Studies has been at the forefront of new ways of engaging in critical scholarship—in no small part due to the marginalization of Kashmir itself and, in turn, any form of critical scholarship engaging Kashmir beyond the framework of “solving an international security problem.” Independent scholars and the Critical Kashmir Studies Collective therefore had to fight against entrenched power structures in both political and academic spheres, in doing so charting new courses in interdisciplinary research and activist scholarship. However, since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, the social, political, and cultural landscapes of Kashmir have shifted tremendously—with the demands for self-determination increasingly cracked down upon and silenced amidst the increasing rise of authoritarianism over Kashmir. With this symposium, we will engage new and emerging scholarship in Kashmir Studies, focusing on the post-2019 world and issues including law, treaties and sovereignty; society, Islam, and political mobilization; the security state and resistance culture; literature, music, and the arts amidst occupation; widespread and long-term repercussions of violence on mental and physical health; and settler colonialism, land, and ecology.\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita is one of the best-known and most widely read, studied, and recited texts in Hindu traditions, and has a long history of exegesis, commentary, and translation in South Asian and European languages. Only seven hundred verses long, this work continues to produce a diverse range of readings, in both scholarship and popular culture, encompassing religion, politics, literature, mysticism, philosophy, and statecraft; its growing role and visibility in contemporary Hindu nationalism makes it a particularly fraught and contested site for debates about South Asian pasts and futures. However, the Bhagavad Gita tends to be considered a stable, canonical work, often obfuscating the diverse interpretations that comprise the text’s multilingual, transnational archive. This symposium brings together early-career scholars who approach this text through a wide range of languages, historical periods, and disciplinary perspectives. The papers in this symposium speak to—and reveal— rich interpretive archives of the Bhagavad Gita not yet considered in detail in secondary scholarship. The scholars who will participate in this day-long symposium will explore the Gita’s interpretive life in premodern and modern contexts ranging from Sanskrit commentarial traditions and Mughal-era Persian translations to contemporary nationalist discourses. It is our hope that this symposium will be the first of many future collaborations that investigate the multiplicity and diversity of the Gita in South Asia and beyond.\n\nThe American Institute of Indian Studies holds an annual dissertation-to-book workshop at the Madison South Asia Conference, co-sponsored by the American Institute of Bangladesh Studies, the American Institute of Pakistan Studies, and the American Institute of Sri Lankan Studies. The workshop aims to help a select number of recent PhDs re-vision their doctoral dissertations as books. Author participants will submit a sample chapter and draft book proposal in advance. The interdisciplinary workshop will begin at 7 pm the day before the scheduled day-long symposium for a “Secrets of Publishing” Q&A session. During the day-long symposium sessions, each of three groups of approximately eight authors and three mentors will work intensively together discussing each project. We conclude the workshop with an all-group dinner at a nearby Indian restaurant. Faculty from a range of disciplines, areas of expertise, gender identities, and levels of seniority will serve as mentors. Each mentor will have published at least one book and will specialize in a range of South Asian regions (including India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) and come from various disciplinary backgrounds, including anthropology, history, literature, media studies, gender studies, and religious studies. For the Wednesday full-day symposium workshops, we will need three separate rooms, OR two separate rooms including one large room separated into two by a divider. We will follow the full-day conference symposium schedule, including the scheduled breaks.\n\nThis symposium aims to think in an interdisciplinary manner about how Jains have historically imagined and enacted individual and collective agency. Jain Studies scholarship has primarily examined the Jain notion of action and non-action through karma theory, centering on the classification of action, factors that play a role in the mechanics of action, and the production of its consequences. Research on Jain ethics and conduct, which has also included discussions on the concept of action, has tended to focus on its regulatory aspects in the context of mendicant discipline. The symposium seeks to expand on these explorations by investigating conceptualizations of the underlying agentive forces involved in the performance of actions. Papers will attend to the embodied dimension of various forms of actions as well as their situatedness in historical and social networks. The contributions of this symposium to the field of Jain studies are manifold. First, it brings together scholars investigating Jain conceptions of agency through a variety of disciplines and methodologies, highlighting the complexity of its textual treatments and lived realities. The presenters include scholars who specialize in various areas such as the history of Jain philosophy, Jain grammatical traditions, Jain ritual culture, ethnography of Jain religious practices, Jain political and economic influence, and the history of science and artisanship within Jain communities. Second, by examining the practices of literary and scientific elites alongside those often overlooked or marginalized in scholarship, particularly lay women and artisans, the papers, taken together, recognize and explicate how different orders of agency exist and interact at every level of Jain social organization. Third, the papers cover a wide range of historical perspectives, spanning from the medieval and early modern periods to the contemporary era. This approach allows for a productive, diachronic examination of conceptions of agency writ large within the Jain tradition.\n\nOur proposed symposium explores the emergence of what we are calling right-wing aesthetic grammars in South Asia. We use the term grammar to gesture to the ways in which emergent aesthetic forms - both visual and sonic - forge distinctive right-wing languages. We wish to explore how these aesthetic grammars underpin instances of collective effervescence and undergird more sustained notions of belonging and potential political action. Our seminar aims to understand the everyday formations of these grammars, with all their complexities and contradictions, through several interrelated domains of inquiry: 1) how and why certain image-forms and sonic traces circulate virally across bodies, communities, and nation-state borders 2) how these circulations are shaped by and shape the specificity of the infrastructural and economic platforms through which they travel 3) how ordinary people play with these circulating aesthetic forms in ways that extend and deepen their communicative possibilities in unpredictable ways 4) how the structures of feeling that emerge through these aesthetic forms work to draw individuals into loose and fluid right-wing collectivities. We contend that South Asia, with its multiple histories of right-wing emergence, offers an important comparative site to analyze how images or sonic fragments that circulate, sometimes confusingly, across national contexts index different and sometimes competing popular political movements. By gathering anthropologists who work across South Asia, we wish to shed light on the crucial role that socially mediated audio-visual popular content plays as it is remixed by individuals in ways that breathe life into right-wing movements.\n\nThis symposium brings together scholars interested in the history of everyday life in Mughal South Asia. Our goal is to explore how thinking in terms of common practice, materiality, lived environments, and even lived experience can enrich and complicate understandings of the larger narratives, institutions, and personalities central to how Mughal history has most often been written. Approaching this era from the perspective of the commonplace helps us to instead bring into focus the complex social and material setting of the Mughal world, through not only incorporating the objects, spaces, and customary practice that framed everyday life but also through offering ways of integrating a wide array of social figures, from the emperor himself and the broader elite to the vast understudied range of other figures populating the Mughal city, qasba, and countryside, from servant to soldier, from shoe-maker to rural cultivator. Presentations will address areas ranging from everyday law, religious ritual, and understandings of the body to literary networks, the making of urban environments, epistolary practice, and histories of the senses. In the process, the symposium will also take advantage of the diverse disciplinary entry-points of contributions to reflect on the archival challenges and opportunities of approaching the Mughal period from this vantage point.\n\nWhile the contemporary study of Hindu traditions began with text, the latter’s centralization as the primary mode through which to understand Hinduism, as a unified religion in modernity, has long been contested. In the wake of postcolonial criticism and, more recently, the emergence of critical Hindu studies, the continued privileging of text and its perceived status has become fraught with issues of hierarchical relations and discourses of power. What, then, does it mean to study texts and their supposed authority in the field of Hindu studies today? How do textual scholars respond, for instance, to the rise of Hindu nationalism, an ideology that explicitly grounds itself in anachronistic textual readings, or to the continued marginalization of oppressed castes, Dalits, and women within textualized domains, or to the racist and exploitative legacies of colonialism, themselves informed by Orientalist textual scholarship, that mark the global Indian diaspora? As a first step toward addressing these matters, this symposium proposes to explore the ways in which textual authority comes to be constructed, negotiated, exercised, challenged, and constrained in Hindu spaces. Among the questions it seeks to engage are the following: How might textual studies and ethnographic perspectives complement one another in appreciating the elaboration, performance, or limitations of authority within textually pluralist, casted, and gendered contexts? How is textually generated authority utilized to create or reinscribe particular kinds of religious communities and associated logics of inclusion or exclusion? How do translation and historiographic practices mediate the authority of Hindu texts across literary, regional, and generic domains? How do conceptions of authority transform as texts move outside of South Asia and become part of digital spaces? Participants approach these topics from a range of methodological, temporal, geographic, and linguistic vantage points, creating new opportunities for collaboration on a pressing issue for the field.\n\nAnimals, both real and imagined, are intricately woven into the histories, ideologies, images, and texts of South Asia. Likewise, human lives in South Asia have perennially existed alongside non-human animals within shared ecologies. Recent decades have been marked by the “animal turn” across the scholarly landscape, and the introduction of animal studies into South Asian studies is already well underway. This symposium radically centers animals in our study of South Asia without decentering humans, exploring human understandings of specific animals throughout the historical period, from deep history to the present day. Using a variety of methodological approaches including multispecies ethnography, history, textual studies, and material analysis, we delve into human-animal relations across diverse media, and trace how animals have been used for human purposes. Materials under study include various elephant science and elephant care manuals (gajaśāstra), Buddhist sculpture and architecture including at Bharhut and Sanchi, and colonial-era postcards and trade cards. We raise questions on the extent of animal personhood as natural personhood and ideal personhood, animal sentience, animal treatment, and animal categories and genders. Our projects include investigations of hospitality and interspecies relations with pigeons in Pakistan, a historical overview of the biological understanding of the elephant across the ages in South Asia and in Persian and Greek worlds, the overlap of nāga and elephant identities at ancient Buddhist sites, Buddhist animal identities in Āryaśūra’s Jātakamālā, and the role of the elephant in Mughal sovereignty. The symposium will dedicate a half day to one very exceptional animal—the elephant—and a half day to other animals in South Asia. Our research concerns animals as beings of their own; at the same time, focusing on animals aids our understanding of human histories, stories, archaeologies, ethnographies, and geographies.\n\nEmbodied Divinity in South Asian Religions This year’s RBSN symposium seeks to amplify the interventions on the multifaceted nature of divine embodiments in the context of bhakti in South Asian traditions by bringing together scholars across disciplines working on hagiography, literature, and lived religion (Waghorne, Cutler, and Narayanan 1985). It endeavors to critically intervene in contextualizing the role of the divine as an embodied self wherein the divine is not confined to abstract transcendence but is intimately woven into the fabric of everyday life. As of yet, scholarly attention has focused on divine-devout relationships centering the devotee as the agent of bhakti. In this symposium, we hope to amplify and shed light upon the embodied divine as the perceived agent. The papers in this symposium illuminate how divine embodiments derive and confer meaning and efficacy, emerging from and giving shape to religious and nonreligious realms alike (Pintchman and Dempsey 2016). We examine what it means for the divine to exert agency in an earthly form: can we decenter the devout in making the divine? How does the divine act within relationships of bhakti? What role does materiality or the lack thereof play in embodying the divine in South Asia? How do oral and written texts substantiate beliefs and practices in lived religion that aid in embodying the divine as a living being subject to human-like conditions? The papers span a chronological arc from pre-modern textual and epigraphic sources, ritual analysis and philosophy, and anthropological analysis. Spanning varied religious traditions such as Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism, this symposium addresses issues of materiality, paradox (i.e. a transcendent deity whose earthly embodied self is subjected to human-like conditions), and wonder (Srinivas 2023). Through such varied lenses, we invite scholars of bhakti to rethink the role of the divine in creating the social of bhakti.\n\nThe ‘decline’ of Indian Buddhism is often attributed to the twelfth-thirteenth century abandonment, destruction, and disrepair of several mega monasteries across Bihar, Bengal, and Orissa that emerged in the eighth-ninth century CE. However, recent scholarship by McKeown (2019), Waley (1932; also, Prasad 2021), and Hori (2018) has presented new evidence of a continuation of Buddhist monasteries and settlements, and Buddhist patrons respectively in the Magadha region (present-day south Bihar) questioning this understanding of the decline of Buddhism. This challenges the traditional understanding of the decline of Buddhism and raises questions about what happened to Buddhist institutions and their activities after the thirteenth century. This panel aims to examine the idea of the decline of Indian Buddhism and reconsider its fate during the medieval period (thirteenth to seventeenth centuries CE) in eastern India. The discussion will cover issues of historiography, patterns in artistic production, built landscape, patronage, and monastic and non-monastic Buddhism to better understand this phenomenon. The geographical area covered by the panel includes present-day Bihar, West Bengal, and Orissa in India, as well as Bangladesh. How was post-thirteenth-century ‘Buddhism’ in eastern India different from its ‘early medieval’ (c. 8th-12th century CE) aspects associated with mega-monastic institutions in Bihar, Bengal, and Orissa? What sources are available to reimagine the ‘final’ days of Buddhism in eastern India? What was the nature of continuing Buddhist monasteries and how did they cope with the newer forms of political authority? How did it affect their patronage and links with the laity in the existing settlements? With these questions, this panel brings together papers on different aspects of later medieval Buddhism in the eastern regions of the Indian subcontinent with papers on epigraphy, art and architecture, archaeology, ethnography, and textual studies as some of the approaches.\n\nSince the publication of Sheldon I. Pollock’s monumental study of the South Asian political imaginaire, The Language of the Gods in the World of Men, scholars have frequently followed him in charting “cosmopolitan” and transregional conceptions of cultural and political identity and activity. With the present, proposed symposium we seek to look in the other direction, as it were, to examine the manner in which the specificity of place serves to shape the political, cultural, religious, and linguistic imagination and practices of the people who make these social realities. The panelists seek to answer the question as to what can be known of South Asian cultural, religious, linguistic, and political lives when privileging the concept of place. To what degree is social consciousness defined by place, how are boundaries formed in reality and imagination, and what do such distinctions do to shape ideas of self, literature, culture, language-use, and political representation and identity? Ultimately, we seek reflectively to complicate notions of the “regional,” “national,” “trans-regional,” and “transnational” by way of examining four exemplars from the Indian subcontinent, namely, those of the Kashmir Valley, Nepal and the Kathmandu Valley in particular, Western India between Rajasthan and Gujarat, and, finally, South India and Tamil Nadu in particular. Scholars participating in the panel hail from the gamut of academic institutions in the United States and Canada, work in various disciplinary traditions, and study a range of historical periods, from the early Medieval to the present day. Two panelists will speak to each of the four regions selected for discussion, with the intention that a ranging conversation will shed new light on what it means to speak of “regions” or “regionality” when examining culture, religion, politics, and language in South Asian Studies.\n\nWith the new geopolitical reality drawing global media and academic attention toward Bangladesh, scholars in social sciences are exploring Bangladesh through various academic lenses, evidenced in the publication of new books and scholarly journal articles. A notable observation in this new wave of scholarship on Bangladesh is the participation of young Bangladeshi scholars who grew up in Bangladesh but studied in Western academia and found their places in renowned universities and research institutions. While many of these scholars follow the early generation of scholars (i.e., anthropologists, historians, geographers, political scientists, and sociologists) in Bangladesh, the unique positionality of this new generation of scholars is evident in the choice of their research topics, analytical approaches, and publishing for both the academic and general audience. This half-day symposium gathers a group of these young scholars simultaneously positioned in academia in Bangladesh and the West, looking at their lived experiences from various disciplinary perspectives. The topics of research these scholars explore range from fictional depictions to historical and feminist understanding of the past, uncovering political struggles that significantly shaped the past and understanding the politics of the present and the future, political ideology influencing the institutional apparatus, including the state and its functions, authoritarianism and disinformation, securitization of society, racialization of religious identity and migrant transnationalism. While the collection of papers connects with ongoing discourses within relevant disciplines, the positionality of the authors allows for bridging Bangladesh with Western academia with both personal experience and professional expertise, making this symposium a unique space for germinating new insights about Bangladesh.\n\nThis panel examines how joy is articulated, understood, and generated in South Asian literary, religious, and ritual worlds. Each panelist seeks to understand the work of joy and how joy works in the text and traditions in which they are immersed. Through careful and close readings of texts and ritual praxis, the panelists explore questions of vocabulary, soteriology, and gender to delve into the place of joy in South Asian literary, religious, and ritual worlds. Panelist 1 draws on the Buddhist Pāli canon and commentaries to unpack the vocabulary of joy and its synonyms to argue that sukha (joy/happiness) is as important to Buddhist soteriology as the much more well-known emphasis on dukkha. Panelist 2 focuses on the conclusion of the Mahābhārata to draw attention to the text’s linking of desire and happiness, and in doing so appears to reverse course, suggesting that personal desire rather than being ruinous can be the source of a lasting, liberatory joy. Panelist 3 pays attention to the specific words for joy in the Sangam corpus—men speak of joy in terms of lust and pleasure, while women articulate it as relief—to argue for the gendered character of joy, most evident in the jasmine landscape that signals domesticity and patient waiting. Panelist 4 takes us into the festival world of a Tamil Śaiva temple to unpack how radically transparent ritual acts, such as public performance of the usually private ornamentation of the gods, creates a dynamic, mutually constituting relationship of pleasure and joy between priests and devotees that aims to recreate the rapturous joy of the tradition’s foundational Tamil poets. The discussant will respond to the four papers and provide comments to guide our appreciation of joy and its attendant affective dimensions—pleasure, desire, lust—in South Asian literary, religious, and ritual worlds.\n\nThis double panel will revisit the special collection of essays on ‘Majoritarian Politics in South Asia’ published by Cultural Anthropology in 2021 for their ‘Hotspots’ section. Since the essays were published, there has been a contentious regime change in Pakistan and Bangladesh, the formation of a new coalition government in Nepal and a new government in Sri Lanka in the aftermath of a political crisis and upcoming elections in India in the face of widespread changes to laws regarding citizenship and marriage among others . However, what has continued through these changes is the attachments to ideologies of ‘injury’ and ‘violation’ in everyday social, political, economic and cultural life. Selected contributors from the collection will examine their continued engagement with the issues from the collection and their respective understanding of how majoritarian regimes ‘acquire legitimacy and longevity through attaching themselves to the quotidian desires, aspirations, fears, and resentments of ordinary people in the region’. The presenters, strengthened with further ethnographic and research insights, will analyse the continuing stitching together and the ‘stickiness’ of majoritarian politics by examining blasphemy politics treason and the reconstitution of citizenship in Pakistan, land regimes of plantation and the gendered politics of dissent in the making of political futures in Sri Lanka, the politics of sub nationalist agitations, the contradictions of syncretism and the cartography of temple Hinduism in India, and how queer narratives navigate the political field of majoritarianism and precarity in Bangladesh . The broad aim of the panels is to provide insights into the particular as well as universalizing majoritarian politics across South Asia through the prism of contradictions and heterogeneity that it both negates and reifies.\n\nThere are eight Title VI NRCs for South Asia–far behind Latin America (19), East Asia/Pan-Asia (19), Africa (13), and the Middle East (13). One might conclude that South Asia is not of great pressing strategic concern to the United States, despite the region’s importance from politics and population to language and history. When higher education is facing demographic challenges from within and defunding challenges from without, how are we to justify studying South Asia? This panel critically reflects on “study” in terms of judgment and literacy. Their relationship is a persistent puzzle: why are polities with high levels of education not immune from dangerous policies and horrifying acts? Our papers suggest that studying South Asia is less about cultivating cross-cultural literacies and more about honing abilities to judge right from wrong—that is, providing opportunities for better understanding the relationship between judgment and literacy itself. Our panel leverages South Asia scholarship and National Resource Center administration. Paper 1 starts the panel with the ways in which epigraphy inspired the British Raj to cultivate political legitimacy through the support of vernacular education, paving the way for literacies to justify anti-colonial projects as right against imperialism as wrong. Paper 2 shifts from early colonial India’s epigraphy to contemporary India’s social media, exploring the ways in which digital literacies fuel political polarizations and how such polarizations complicate right/wrong distinctions. Paper 3 takes up the theme of polarizations in a comparative frame examining recent developments in India and the US, interrogating the relationship between “Hinduphobia” and racism to illustrate the role of classroom censorship in cultivating judgment. Finally, Paper 4 explores the relationship between literacy and refusal in forging world citizens, arguing that the latter grounded “cosmopolitan” efforts in interwar Tamil-speaking South India to cultivate right/wrong distinctions.\n\nThis panel explores the political aesthetics of contemporary populism by focusing on gendered personalization in South Asian politics. The papers invite us to contemplate the auratic power of a number of formidable women leaders around whom multiple aspects of South Asian democratic culture, such as, dynastic tradition, kinship, celebrity culture, and mediatization coalesce. While a masculinist configuration of sovereignty continues to dominate the discussion of populism in the West, South Asian women leaders and their brands of authoritarian populism expose a libidinal economy that suffuses personalist conceptions of political representation. Exceeding, re-signifying, and at times directly challenging the conventionally male, upper-class, and upper-caste categories of political authority, these leaders emerge as ambiguous fetishes that are at once of the people and far beyond them, marking a familiar oscillation between intense identification with the leader and her intrinsic singularity. By analyzing the visceral economy of affect and speech of politicians such as Indira Gandhi, Jayalalitha, Mayawati, Benazir Bhutto, and others, the papers on the panel document the material and symbolic registers through which these leaders have asserted their power in some of the world’s most populous democracies. The aim here is not simply to recognize South Asian, or even postcolonial, difference in shaping political charisma, but to rethink the global career of contemporary authoritarianisms from the vantage point of South Asian mass democracies.\n\nIn November 2023, authorities in Batticaloa, a town in Sri Lanka's Eastern Province, detained nine Tamil individuals under the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act, seizing materials intended for a vigil commemorating those lost in the war. This incident is part of a sustained effort by the state to control narratives around war memorialization, supporting a dominant ethnonationalism that legitimizes authoritarian rule and suppresses democracy. This was a sustained process of the state taking control of the meanings of symbols, events, and practices of memorialization of the war to ensure the continuity of the majoritarian ethnonationalism narrative. This narrative provides legitimacy to authoritarian rule and denies democracy, disproportionately affecting the minority Tamils and their struggle for rights. This panel draws on interdisciplinary perspectives from Anthropology, Political Economy, Performance Studies, and Literature and incorporates both scholarly and artistic voices. It addresses memorialization as a site of contested histories of the conflicts. It explores how art and performance embody, challenge, and reconstruct collective memory, offering alternative genealogies that resist the erasure and homogenization of diverse experiences and truths. Contributing to ongoing debates on the role of art and performance in grieving, witnessing, and constructing post-conflict identities and memories, we offer critical perspectives into how Sri Lanka's contested pasts are navigated and memorialized within the public sphere. Central to our discussion is the exploration of how artistic mediums navigate the tension between hegemonic, state-sponsored historiography that erases the multiple histories of othered communities in post-conflict, post-war memorialization. Rather than presenting the aesthetic as a simple alternative or solution to state oppression, the four papers highlight the nuanced embodiment of grieving, recollection, and addressing the enduring repercussions of violence. Collectively, we provide insights into the politics of memorialization and the rise of ethnonationalist authoritarianism in postcolonial societies.\n\nThis panel presents revisionist approaches to the prose and poetry of foundational Urdu poet Mīrzā Muḥammad Rafīʿ Saudā (The Frenzy) (1706-1781), a Persian- and Urdu-language author whose range encompassed clever ġhazals, sectarian lampoons, devotional elegies, and historical criticism. Recent approaches to early Urdu history have forged new connections between authors, texts, and social contexts. So too, current historical scholarship on eighteenth-century Mughal India has refocused attention on public culture. While engaging these scholarly shifts, we aim to reexamine Saudā’s long and varied career as an intellectual shaped by South Asian literary traditions. The first two papers discuss Saudā’s rise in Delhi (ca. 1735-1755) as the “Poet Laureate of Reḳhtah,” acquiring an old title applied to a new literary style. The first paper examines Saudā’s ġhazals so as to elucidate his emulative dialogues that strategically distinguished his words in a crowded poetry scene. The second paper contextualizes an infamous qaṣīdah Saudā purportedly wrote to lampoon the reformer Shāh Walīullāh. Both papers analyze Saudā’s early notions of distinction as related to dialogue, humor, and social contexts. The next two papers present Saudā’s career in Awadh (ca. 1755-1781), which coincided with the emergence of Saudā’s critical voice. The third paper examines changing socio-literary norms through a discussion of Saudā’s abilities as a marṡiyah (eulogy) writer and strategies as a critic in a versified critique of marṡiyah conventions. The final paper analyzes Saudā’s approach to Persian literary history and style in a critical treatise penned at the end of his life, revealing Saudā to be a uniquely positioned Indo-Persian intellectual. Both papers consider the stakes of Saudā’s literary vision as it coalesced in his later career. From these vantages, the papers on this panel frame Saudā as a careerist writer who successfully navigated the competing economic, aesthetic, and linguistic demands of late Mughal society.\n\nThis Roundtable brings together interdisciplinary perspectives on the intellectual and social history of the Library (Kitabkhana) in South Asia. We focus on one of India's oldest and most significant collections of manuscripts housed in Rampur Raza Library. The Roundtable follows two sets of questions about texts and context. We plan to discuss the historical development of manuscript from pre-colonial royal private collection in Rohillkhand to public library in post-colonial Rampur. Here our attention will be to discuss the collection, preservation, and dissemination of manuscripts particularly, Arabic, Persian, Pashto, and Urdu in the historical development of the library. Instead of taking a princely or national framework, we hope to map the geographies of knowledge circulation that connects Rampur with Mecca, Najaf, Tehran, Kabul, Peshawar, Delhi, and Lucknow. First, we focus on patrons, manuscript collectors, calligraphers, musicians, dastango, print publishers, librarians, and scholars who were part of the development and dissemination of the manuscript collections. Contributors will speak about various manuscripts, their histories of circulation, and their significance in writing a multilingual South Asian history. (Presenter 1, 2, 3 will address these issues) The second set of questions brings the texts into conversation with changing historical contexts. Here we want to raise questions about the social and political life of texts and readers under changing political contexts from precolonial, colonial, princely to the national context and knowledge production in the global academy. The participants will speak about endangered manuscript archives, preservation efforts, the value of the library in small-town vernacular intellectual culture. We also discuss politics of access in the age of digital archives. (Presenter 4 and 5 will address these issues) We hope to start interdisciplinary discussion on politics of preservation and dissemination in writing a critical history of manuscripts, reading publics, and democratization of knowledge in South Asia.\n\nPart 1 of 2. Our panel will discuss dominant and emerging ideas on being Muslim in contemporary South Asia through music, image, text, performance, active recollection, and memory, in the context of increased otherization. Papers will explore junctures, events, overlaps, and nodes, situated across time and space, which act as vestibules between the idea of “Muslimness” and “belonging”. Conceptions of belonging will explore linkages with religiosity, class, caste, gender, hegemonies, place making, pioneership, and rootedness. The aim is to move beyond problematizing authority and representation / mis-representation and invest in narratives which are first-person, self-reflexive, agency specific and advance critical foresight. This panel comprises of early career researchers, advanced doctoral students, and professional academics from across a range of disciplines, including history, religion, ethnomusicology, anthropology, and development studies. The panel is sponsored by the South Asian Muslim Studies Association (SAMSA).\n\nContemporary South Asian constitutions are by and large progressive and enumerate a host of socio-economic rights and civil liberties. Yet the Minority Question is yet to be substantially resolved. Strategic litigation has in some instances afforded citizenship rights, but the othering of diverse minorities across the region are a reminder of a colonial past that continues to haunt contemporary South Asia. In this roundtable, we propose to examine South Asian legal history over the long nineteenth and twentieth centuries as it relates to the making of minorities. We seek to engage in an interdisciplinary conversation between history and law, and in particular constitutional studies. A historical inquiry will not only help understand how minority questions developed in South Asia, but also the complex webs of local knowledge production which shaped the meaning of group identities. The proposed roundtable, therefore, will not only set a precedent for the larger epistemological objective of internationalizing Legal History but simultaneously conceive it from below by creating space for its local articulations including sites in the periphery of the Global South—and South Asia in particular. We propose to discuss the following non-exhaustive categories: i) Production of Minorities and Group identities ii) Personal Laws: Historical Reflections and Contemporary Relevance iii) Ethnic Minorities: Path Dependencies and Militarization (both colonial and contemporary) iv) The othering of Sexuality and Gender\n\nThis panel examines discussions on caste in Tamil society in two British colonies, India and Mauritius, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth-century. This was a period during which deliberations around caste not only proliferated in the colonial records but also crammed private and public correspondences, caste periodicals, musical hagiographies and even brawls between poets. Speaker 1 studies the “Ida Scudder Papers,” an extensive collection of personal correspondences and speeches by the American Missionary based in Vellore (Madras Presidency), Dr Ida Scudder (1870-1960). She informs us that even though the missionary archives are quiet about caste in the Indian Christian community, a close reading reveals anxieties around mission and caste amongst non-Indians that shaped institutional practices of medical aid. Speaker 2 examines a pro-Gandhian Tamil periodical by vēḷāḷars, a non-brahmin caste community, which circulated in the 1920s, titled Vēḷāḷa Mitraṉ. The speaker suggests that the periodical invented discursive spaces of intimacy that obfuscated contradictions around commemorating their communal identity while simultaneously supporting Gandhi’s protests against untouchability to their presumably kin-based readership. Speaker 3 looks at the brahmin composer, Kopālakiruṣṇa Pārati’s (1811-1896) Nantaṉār Carittirakkīrttaṉaikaḷ (1861), a musical hagiography of the only Dalit saint in Tamil Śaivism. They demonstrate how the devotional-musical work developed a discourse on caste and ethical behaviour that avowed the “lord and slave” relationship. Speaker 4 moves us to Mauritius, to an emerging Tamil diaspora and unpacks the feud between two vēḷāḷar colonial bureaucrats cum poets – Soobrayan Pillai (1886-1978) and Selvam Pillai (1988-1978). This paper informs us that, although countering each other, both vēḷāḷar men contributed to the formation of militant Hindu landlordism in Mauritius. Altogether, the four papers bring to the foreground less attended to discussions on caste that circulated away from the “centre” but amongst Indians and non-Indians in British India and Mauritius.\n\nThrough ethnographic, formal, and comparative historical approaches to Indian media industries, this panel considers key understandings of contemporary global contexts, as well as key understandings of labor, regulation, and gender in accounts of South Asian cinemas. The first two papers explore tensions between national, regional, and cross-border political imperatives, especially as they have congealed around the labors of star actresses; and the latter two focus on grassroots unionizing by below-the-line women workers who decry the challenging and exploitative conditions of their places of work. Together, the four papers offer a wide view of gendered labor and regulation across Indian media industries, in order to reveal what kinds labor—and shifts therein—tend to fall through the cracks of global media studies. Speaker 1 begins with an account of Tamil-language Nayanthara-starrer Annapoorani (2023), which gained notoriety after its Netflix release was met with Hindu nationalists’ objections. Yet, the film’s initially unrestricted theatrical exhibition invites an analysis of complexities between regional, national, and nationalist media, in terms of contemporary reception and censorship. Speaker 2 continues with another case study of a contemporary commercial film, focusing on the Yash Raj Spy Universe’s Pathaan alongside its Tiger franchise, to argue that depictions of workplace romances between an Indian agent and a feminine Pakistani counterpart betray key shifts in the contemporary Indian spy film as well as ambivalent and contradictory nationalist and post-nationalist visions of justice. Speakers 3 and 4 offer contemporary case studies not of specific films, but of below-the-line workers in two unions: Federation of Western India Cine Employees, and South Indian Cine Women Workers Union, respectively. Speaker 3 emphasizes the patriarchal and exploitative working conditions that unionized women workers are fighting, and Speaker 4 highlights the tendency to overlook the contributions of below-the-line workers’ grassroots activism in studies of production and media industries.\n\nThe panel explores the long nineteen-forties in Bengal by engaging with modes and registers of anticolonialism which were constituted by ideas of cosmopolitanism, transcontinental intellectual solidarities, and global linguistic networks. Establishing a dialogue with the existent scholarly discourses on the 1940s, the panel focuses particularly on the international wave of decolonial and emancipatory politics which became a singular characteristic of the period. The panel seeks to highlight how histories of anti-colonial movement could be written in a global intellectual mode which guided much of the anti-fascist, peasant, trade union, and student movements. The first paper reads the student magazine of the Presidency College in Calcutta from the nineteen forties to highlight the global events that were gaining prominence among the youth, a rising engagement with leftist politics, and a consequent emergence of the magazine as a site for thinking through multiple forms of ideological positions. The second paper demonstrates the global aspirations of the working class in forties Bengal as they made their labor strikes speak for the cause of the proletariat across the globe. The paper further probes the increasing participation of women in these strikes which was adding another dimension to the protest lexicon. The third paper argues how the birth of East Pakistan differed significantly from West Pakistan in their articulation of national and moral sovereignty. By reflecting on the history of ‘consciousness’, the paper shows how Bengali Pakistanism collapsed political and literary realisms by presenting Pakistan as a site for Bengali Muslim ‘Renaissance.’ The final paper focuses on Hitosadhini Sabha from North Bengal and claims how it forged connections between the metropoles, colonies, presidencies, and the native states. Drawn at the intersection of transnational and micro history, the paper is an exploration of the various ‘affective communities’ that were formed at the brink of decolonization.\n\nThis panel is part 1 of 2. It presents four interconnected papers that offer diverse perspectives on environmental, social, and political dynamics in early modern South Asia, particularly focusing on the Mughal Empire's formation and decline in the 18th century. The first paper delves into the history and symbolism of Kalhora wall paintings in Sindh, illuminating the religious beliefs and agrarian influences that shaped the Kalhora state within the broader context of Mughal hegemony. These papers offer new evidence in vernacular languages that shed light on precolonial 'rationalizations' and 'patrimonies' that made early modern political life possible. Moving to courtly visions and artistic representations, the second paper explores the forest as a worksite in Mughal, Mewar, and Awadh courts, highlighting how these spaces were integral to the empire's economic and symbolic frameworks. The third paper shifts focus to environmental migration and state formation, examining how the movements of pastoral communities like the Rebaris influenced territorial control and administrative infrastructure, crucial aspects of Mughal governance. Finally, the fourth paper presents a riparian perspective on the decline of the Mughal Empire, focusing on logistical challenges and economic shifts along the Ganga River that contributed to the empire's weakening and the rise of British influence in eastern India. Together, these papers weave a narrative of interconnectedness between environmental factors, artistic expressions, migration patterns, and imperial dynamics, offering fresh insights into the complex and multifaceted history of Mughal state power and its eventual giving way to instruments of early colonial hegemony in the eighteenth century which are explored in the panel to follow.\n\nHysteria goes by many clinical names: from conversion disorder, to dissociation, to histrionic personality disorder, to clinical muteness – the diagnostic muddle of hysteria is far from a thing of the past. This diagnostic muddle is not so much a question of misrecognition of hysteria, or lack of proper discovery, but rather the ambiguity generated is the very feat of hysteria itself. At the same time, much has been said about the supposed disappearance of hysteria or its refusal to disappear in the darker continents of the world, thought to be a hangover from a lingering western pathologization, arriving too late after its western disappearance onto the psychoanalytic scene of the postcolonies. On the contrary, this panel analyzes how in spite of this oft-repeated clinical anachronism, the thing that sometimes goes by the name hysteria appears as a decisive force in refusing to let the status quo narrative draw forward in any kind of linear way. From describing scenes of violence to revolutionary resistance, Frantz Fanon has helped us understand hysteria as both a clinical and a political – if not revolutionary – category and revolution itself as a hysterical process (David Marriott). This panel brings together researchers working in clinical and nonclinical contexts in South Asia – ethnographic, historical, and literary – to think with the generative ambiguity of the clinical and political category of hysteria. Ultimately, we might ask, in the recurring category of hysteria, summoned to such vastly different ends, what does the thing-called-hysteria itself become? And what are the political and clinical consequences of holding on to or undoing of this category?\n\nSouth Asia has been the site of rich interventions in the \"agrarian question,\" a Left debate on the role of agriculture and the peasantry in bringing about a post-capitalist future. At its heart is a political question on the agency of the peasantry, but it also involves theoretical disputes over the analysis of agriculture under capitalism. Our panel will revisit the \"agrarian question\" in the territory of what would become Pakistan by seeing its intersections with class, nation, gender, caste, and imperialism. Drawing on the colonial and postcolonial articulations of agrarian revolt, the panel will explore the implications for how we imagine the agrarian questions in Pakistan. Moreover, it explores its broader interfaces with the global agrarian question, through the exploration of M.N.Roy's contestations in the Second Congress of the Comintern, the politics of the Kirti Kissan Sabha (1927-1935), the West Pakistan Kissan Committee (1947-now), and the Mazdoor Kissan Party (1968-now). Moreover, through exploring the intermeshing of caste, tribe, gender, labour and land relations in Khyber Pakthunkhwa, the panel will complicate political articulations of the Agrarian Question within past and present agrarian movements and Marxist theorizing. These grounded reflections from Pakistan are designed to offer broader insights for those researching global agrarian histories by foregrounding movement literature and practices, and how these interact with the complex socio-material worlds within which global and local agrarian relations are woven.\n\nThe study of stone beads found at site of the Indus Tradition (2600-1900 BCE) in northwestern South Asia provides an important window into multiple aspects of ancient social, economic, and ideological organization. Ongoing studies of beads from regional sites located near the agate and carnelian mining areas of Gujarat in western India provide direct evidence for the development of localized styles of ancient beads manufacturing technology and bead shapes. Presenter 1 will discuss the robust evidence for local production at two well excavated sites, Ghola Doro (Bagasra) and Shikarpur. Presenter 2 will focus on stone bead production and bead styles from the major urban center of Harappa, Punjab, as well as other sites in Pakistan to illustrate the important connections between sites in the core regions of the Indus River Valley and the resource area of Gujarat. Based on the comparative data from the earlier periods at Harappa, it is possible that craftspeople from Gujarat may have had a major role in spreading specific bead making technologies and bead styles throughout the Indus region. Presenter 3 will examine stone beads made from other types of rock some of which might come from regions outside of Gujarat, such as amazonite, grossular-vesuvianite and lapis lazuli. These other rocks were incorporated into the bead making traditions of the Indus cities and even are distributed in sites throughout Gujarat, showing the multidirectional movement of raw materials and also bead production technology and bead styles. Presenter 4 will examine the legacy of Indus stone beads that were produced in the Indus or Mesopotamia and traded to West Asia and the Mediterranean region during the 3rd millennium BCE or Bronze Age. There is also evidence for the hierlooming of Indus beads and trade of these rare ornaments more than 1000 years later during the Iron Age.\n\nAt a time when socio-political actors seem intent on seizing the Ramayana for their own ends and narrowing its interpretation, this panel highlights the work of younger scholars who continue to emphasize the diversity and multivocality of this narrative tradition. The papers, spread across different temporalities and regions in South Asia, discuss the role of translation and the multifarious applications of genre-making in the epic tradition in addressing questions of gender and domesticity, caste, geo-political and historical imagination, and moral subjectivities in the subcontinent. The four papers each look at a different genre and style of the epic and intend to foreground a critical conversation on the distinct functions that a multivocal text serves and arrive at a framework to understand its translations therein. By bringing different epic sub-genres into conversation, this panel seeks to analyze how the Ramayana serves as a medium to understand the historical realities and aspirations of South Asian society. Speaker 1 and Speaker 2 study medieval Ramayanas to highlight two distinct styles of composition, the erotic and the historical. Speaker 1 scrutinizes the ways in which the fifteenth-century Punam’s Ramayana, composed in the hybrid manipravalam style, uses irony and sarcasm to critically engage with the oft-neglected conjugal life of Rama and Sita. Speaker 2 investigates the sub-genre of historical realism within the epic canon and analyzes the devotional, theological and political compulsions that fueled the need to undergird the epic’s historicity. Speaker 3 and Speaker 4 study colonial and post-colonial epics. Speaker 3 studies the writing of children’s Ramayana and the role of abridgment and selective illustrations in the making of Hindu childhoods in colonial Bengal. Speaker 4 traces the impact of Periyar Lalai’s Singh’s Hindi translation of EV Ramaswami’s modern classic “Ramayana: A True Meaning” in rearticulating “Dravidian” anti-caste politics.\n\nThis double panel will revisit the special collection of essays on ‘Majoritarian Politics in South Asia’ published by Cultural Anthropology in 2021 for their ‘Hotspots’ section. Since the essays were published, there has been a contentious regime change in Pakistan and Bangladesh, the formation of a new coalition government in Nepal and a new government in Sri Lanka in the aftermath of a political crisis and upcoming elections in India in the face of widespread changes to laws regarding citizenship and marriage among others . However, what has continued through these changes is the attachments to ideologies of ‘injury’ and ‘violation’ in everyday social, political, economic and cultural life. Selected contributors from the collection will examine their continued engagement with the issues from the collection and their respective understanding of how majoritarian regimes ‘acquire legitimacy and longevity through attaching themselves to the quotidian desires, aspirations, fears, and resentments of ordinary people in the region’. The presenters, strengthened with further ethnographic and research insights, will analyse the continuing stitching together and the ‘stickiness’ of majoritarian politics by examining blasphemy politics treason and the reconstitution of citizenship in Pakistan, land regimes of plantation and the gendered politics of dissent in the making of political futures in Sri Lanka, the politics of sub nationalist agitations, the contradictions of syncretism and the cartography of temple Hinduism in India, and how queer narratives navigate the political field of majoritarianism and precarity in Bangladesh . The broad aim of the panels is to provide insights into the particular as well as universalizing majoritarian politics across South Asia through the prism of contradictions and heterogeneity that it both negates and reifies.\n\nFaculty cultural exchanges to less-traveled countries in South Asia enrich the participating institutions' academic environments, enhance their research capabilities, and contribute to their global reputation. For participating faculty, they foster knowledge exchange, research collaboration, cultural diversity, and institutional networking. The exchanges can also be a chance to challenge assumptions and build bridges for faculty and their students alike. But demanding course goals and outcomes and the time constraints of a semester prevent even the most well-meaning faculty from applying the knowledge gained abroad to their teaching practice. Democratic methods such as discussion boards are one way to culturally and globally enhance one’s curriculum using one’s experiences as a source of information. But are there other more creative ways to turn faculty cultural exchange experiences into meaningful teaching and learning opportunities for undergraduate students? Six faculty members, four from U.S. Community Colleges and one from a Pakistan college recently participated in a cultural exchange to each other’s countries. This Roundtable will engage the participants in a discussion on how faculty can integrate faculty cultural exchanges into their curriculum — lectures and class activities. This Roundtable will encourage an interdisciplinary and intercultural conversation on how to incorporate travel experience outcomes across disciplines and transnational institutions with a focus on U.S. and Pakistan\n\nThe “political” is usually approached through inquiries into institutions of sovereignty, governance, distribution, and force, and through standardized conceptual repertoires. This panel offers a distinctive approach, attuning analysis to aesthetic assemblages of form, material, and affect that authorize and produce a sense of the political. It is concerned with the present political moment in India. Panelist 1 focuses on the anti-CAA protests in Mumbai, attending to the materiality of kaaghaz (paper) and khoon (blood) in constituting psychologically individuated and affectively laden awaaz (voice) as the ground and evidence of citizenship. Voice is shown to be grounded in the crowd, which emerges as a “socio-technical, material infrastructure for the production and circulation of digital-renderings of awaaz-images.” Panelist 2 focuses on the contested Central Vista Redevelopment Plan in New Delhi and the emergence of a Hindutva grammar of the secular actualized in architectural form, offering a way to address emergent languages and affects of community and alienation and to delineate a range of political imaginaries being built into the revised aesthetics of monumental urbanism. Panelist 3 focuses on a collaboration between NGOs and designers in Mumbai rethinking autorickshaw interiors as a response to gendered violence. At stake is a “spatialized philosophy of design-as-politics” through the material and aesthetic production of a “de-gendered experience of the city” as civil space. Panelist 4 focuses on aesthetic and biopolitical claims for the architectural assemblage of the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in Varanasi as emblematic of a new political grammar of vikaas (development), one that relieves the city and its concretions of religious value from the biological toxicity of the crowds produced by an alleged history of Muslim encroachment, and creates a new kind of crowd that can see the city and the nation differently.\n\nThe panel considers factors impacting Indian Punjabi women’s, Sikh specifically, decision to migrate, or to not migrate. The presenters, who are also collaborators for a project on international migration from the Punjab funded by a Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) grant, explore this objective in the context of women located in the Indian Punjab as well as the United States. This participatory audio-visual project combines insights from a range of disciplines – sociology, global studies, religious studies, feminist theory, visual anthropology, narrative theory, critical race studies, migration studies – to develop documentary filmmaking tools for engaging with academic research questions through creative practices. Hence, the methodology employed by each panelist is distinct. Speaker 1, as a sociologist, includes observations obtained from semi-structured interviews and ethnography. Speaker 2, as a filmmaker, presents a visual lens in analyzing the footage collected from Punjabi-Sikh women, which includes the interviews conducted by another panelist. Speaker 3's gender and cultural studies framework expands the range of methods in storytelling in shedding light on the topic. Together, their interdisciplinary approach enhances the tools of analysis to access the many nuances that inform international migration decisions and experiences of the informants. The presenters also grapple with understanding both visible and invisible borders for women’s mobility.\n\nHad Sri Lanka embraced pluralism—something it was well positioned to do—the island may well have established a liberal democracy. But having disenfranchised the Indian Tamils within a year of gaining independence in 1948, the country steadily moved in an ethnocentric direction. It is now best branded a hybrid democracy that combines relatively free and fair elections amidst malgovernance and ethnocracy. In this milieu, certain leaders have utilized executive powers to operate in authoritarian fashion, thereby compounding the country’s democratic deficits. But such democratic backsliding gets challenged, causing the political pendulum to swing between relative authoritarianism and illiberal democracy. This democratic regression and progression have been major aspects of the country’s politics especially since the semi-presidential system was set up in 1978. Sri Lanka is slated to hold a presidential election by September-October 2024 and parliamentary elections before August 2025. The present government postponed local government elections that were due in March 2023, claiming the bankrupt country lacked funds. Many fear it may do the same with the presidential election. A postponed election could unleash a violent uprising. On the other hand, if the presidential election is held on schedule and the new government alters course, that could exacerbate the extant crises. The upshot is that if democratic politics fails to minimize the present widespread angst, the country could well become even more authoritarian than any time in the past. Within this context, the proposed panel will discuss issues ranging from debt structuring and its gendered impact, how a weakened judiciary and parties contribute to democratic backsliding, the attendant illiberalism, and resulting resistance.\n\nFor many decades now, the “Persianate world” has served as a useful framework for discussing vast areas of western, central, and southern Asia in which Persian was the shared language of cultural prestige, disrupting nationalist and religion-centric approaches to historiography. While generally invoked to approach premodern cultural and political geographies in transregional, multilingual, and non-anachronistic terms, recent scholarship has started to examine the persistent and changing relevance of the “Persianate” to the period of European colonialism, nationalism, and modernization. Our panel hopes to develop this conversation by asking: what happened to Persianate ways of being, thinking, and creating in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries? The first speaker will consider the continued importance and usage of Persian among Urdu literati during the nineteenth century. Through an attentiveness to matters of continuity, the paper develops a new framework for the study of the Persian in the colonial period. Speakers two and three will focus on more specific case studies, examining how Persophone intellectuals from Iran and South Asia in the early twentieth century repurposed and rethought Persianate poetics to meet the demands of the present. Speaker two will introduce the work of the pandit-scholar Padmasiṃha Śarma who, by taking recourse to the works of Alṭāf Husayn Ḥāli, mounted a defense of the tradition of Braj poetry in a time when literary practice was moving towards standardized Hindi. The third speaker, meanwhile, will reassess the attitudes of the Iranian poet-scholar, Muḥammad-Taqī Bahār to the so-called Indian style of Persian poetry, situating them within his broader literary commitments and understanding of the Indo-Persian tradition. Taken together, these papers suggest new ways of thinking about the persistence and transformation of the Persianate in its encounter with modernity.\n\nOn the occasion of the publication of Kartik Nair’s \"Seeing Things: Spectral Materialities of Bombay Horror\" (University of California Press, 2024), this roundtable stages a discussion about the felicity of failure in plumbing social, political and material histories in South Asia. Committed to a close reading of glitches within film frames for their indexical trace of a historical touch that provides entry to histories of production, bodies, labour, control and pleasure, \"Seeing Things\" challenges us to perceive this trace as a series of aesthetic effects to be parsed speculatively and uncertainly to generate historical accounts beyond the familiar, the canonical and the normative. Exploring the ramifications of Nair's method for scholarship on South Asia, this roundtable brings together an opinionated panel of scholars who have worked with disregarded, degraded, disappeared, disdained and dubious public cultural forms to discuss how the glitch or tear is the entry point to an ‘uncanon’ (Nair 2024:39) of social and cultural life. The five speakers will respond to a different provocation of Seeing Things from the diverse geographic, historical and thematic contexts of their own research in South Asia. Speaker 1 will draw on his research on performance cultures to consider the performativity of glitches - the embodied and fleshy life of these aesthetics and their ability to work the body and activate the audience. Speaker 2 will examine how failure constitutes a form of worlding, creating transnational circuits of influence that render film genres 'globally familiar'. Speaker 3 will draw out how the ‘bad object’ of genre film encourages faltering interdisciplinary conversation between film studies and anthropology. Speaker 4 will discuss the significance of production and circulation cultures for aesthetic and material practices in South Asian visual culture. Speaker 5 will respond to these interventions and set out future lines of enquiry.\n\nPart 2 of 2. Our panel will discuss dominant and emerging ideas on being Muslim in contemporary South Asia through music, image, text, performance, active recollection, and memory, in the context of increased otherization. Papers will explore junctures, events, overlaps, and nodes, situated across time and space, which act as vestibules between the idea of “Muslimness” and “belonging”. Conceptions of belonging will explore linkages with religiosity, class, caste, gender, hegemonies, place making, pioneership, and rootedness. The aim is to move beyond problematizing authority and representation / mis-representation and invest in narratives which are first-person, self-reflexive, agency specific and advance critical foresight. This panel comprises of researchers from across a range of disciplines, including gender studies, language, and literary studies. The panel is sponsored by the South Asian Muslim Studies Association (SAMSA).\n\nThe four papers in the panel explore Dalit, Adivasi, and Socialist actors’ critical engagement with liberal ideas and institutions, especially with the politics of representation, the juridical transformation and secular constitution, and the emerging notions of social equality. The Government of India Acts of 1919 and 1935, the discussion over franchise and representation in the provincial assemblies (1928-1932), access to educational institutions, the judicial system, and the 1862 Indian penal code provide an important context. Colonial Liberalism enabled a new set of conversations and possibilities among Dalit and Adivasi organizations and they actively participated by engaging with the state and the caste-Hindu Indian nationalists, and in the process created new publics. Even the socialists and the communists keenly debated questions relating to popular sovereignty and franchise, and proposed radical constitutional transformations than those proposed by the Raj or the nationalists. The four papers will shed new light on the vital role of these diverse social actors in contributing to debates on representation and affirmative action, juridical transformation, and franchise and electoral politics. Recognizing the role of colonial liberalism as a tool of domination (U. Mehta, 1999 and N. Dirks, 2001), its interaction with Indian institutions (K. Mantena, 2010), and its role in enabling new discussions among elite Hindu actors and Bengali peasants (C. Bayly, 2011 and A. Sartori, 2014), the four panelists will introduce new social actors who actively engaged with these political concerns. The four papers will explore aspects of colonial liberalism by using Adivasi, Dalit, and socialist materials and pay special attention to the language deployed by the social actors.\n\nThis roundtable aims to reflect on our collective duty as scholars of South Asia, in the context of the ongoing violence in Palestine. As many legal experts have noted, Israel’s ferocious assault on Gaza has been and continues to be genocidal in intent, scope and scale. This has been war on children as well as on journalists, aid workers and medical staff. It has also featured deliberate and systematic attack on scholars. An integral part of the Israel’s multipronged war strategy has been the targeting of students, scholars and cultural and educational institutes in Gaza, a policy the Palestinian scholar, Karma Nabulsi, has termed “scholasticide”. This is the latest, most severe chapter in Israeli settler colonialism in Palestine, which has been supported by the United States, and aided by other Western powers for over a century. It demands attention from scholars worldwide, including and especially of South Asia, given our connected histories. This roundtable brings together scholars of South Asia, situated in various disciplines, including Gender and Women’s Studies, Anthropology, History and Classics to deliberate on the ethical responsibilities of South Asian scholars towards Palestine. Scholars will bring their particular expertise to discuss various topics including the interconnected histories of anti-colonial struggle in Palestine and British India, the history of Palestine solidarity movements in postcolonial South Asia, the comparable relationship between citizenship, exclusion and violence in Israel and Pakistan, India and Bangladesh and Palestinian feminist critiques of global empires and concepts such as “reproductive genocide”. The panelists will discuss actions scholars can take up to support Palestinian academics and students through pedagogy, research, and academic activism. At the same time, the group will also discuss the lessons we can draw from the Palestinian struggle and consider how the work of solidarity opens political possibilities in South Asia.\n\nThis roundtable will focus on the pedagogic challenges that the inherently multilingual, non-Europhone, non-Western field of contemporary Indian theatre offers to both instructors and students in the American graduate classroom. The moderator (Speaker 1) will outline some key theoretical, critical, and interpretive strategies for negotiating the problems of linguistic and cultural access because of which Indian theatre remains marginal in Western academic curricula and scholarship. The other five speakers will reflect on various methods of connecting this more or less unfamiliar field to their respective areas of interest and expertise, which include the theatres of Iran, India, Nigeria, and the Vietnamese-American diaspora. The roundtable thus potentially offers a unique composite portrait of what it means to study modern and contemporary Indian theatre in the thoroughly international setting of a US graduate program.\n\nThe plurality of film cultures in South Asia not only centers the region as a critical framework in understanding histories of popular media, but also offers multiple registers of cinema historiography. While the cinematic texts and their symptoms have shaped much of historiography (Prasad 1998, Mazumdar 2007, Sarkar 2009, Vasudevan 2011), the panel looks to participate in the more recent turn towards material histories to excavate encounters, cross-border exchanges, and minor histories (Mahadevan 2016, Mukherjee 2020, Siddique 2022, Nair 2024). The panel asks: if cinema, both in terms of its institution and intimacy, gets mediated by contiguous material cultures, what are the different constituents of such mediations? By looking at materials like gossip, photo albums, popular print, and production stills from diverse regional contexts across the colonial-postcolonial divide of the last century, the papers show how film cultures proffered new modes of participation and new performative possibilities in modernity. They employ region as an analytic category to demonstrate how caste, gender, and taste were mobilized through material cultures of Maharashtra, Bengal, and Hindi-speaking regions. The industrial milieu, another key determinant, shows how cinema as an industry became a space for voyeuristic speculation, alternative modes of production, creative interlocution with other media practices such as literature and portraiture photography. The papers also address how the public sphere becomes both the imagined and empirical locus to mobilize new cultural possibilities- be it through circulation of pleasurable fragments, proliferation of anti-caste attitudes, or infusion of literary sensibilities. Finally, while thinking through interconnected material registers spanning affective public cultures, industry patrons and paratextual interlocutors, the panel also seeks to reassess dominant articulations of the filmic archive, offering exploratory non-instrumental ways to think about the impact of cultural archives on public imagination.\n\nThis panel is Part I of the double panel, \"Bengal and its South Asian Neighbors,\" that seeks to initiate a dialogue with regards to the Bengal region, as it has evolved into a contested terrain shaped by the Partition and the creation of Bangladesh. In the recent decades, communal fragmentations have flared up. Thus, the impact of historic political forces, attuned to addressing the region’s heterogeneous ethnic, linguistic, and religious communities, requires reassessment. Part 1 includes four papers. Speaker 1seeks to explore the significance of language reform, initiated during the Bengal Renaissance, and its relation to affective histories, while Speaker 2 illuminates the longue durée framework of the idea of the Indian or Bengal Renaissance. Thereafter, Speaker 3 revisits the contested alliance between Islam and Marxism in East Bengal with an aim to recuperate the global history of alliance between Leftists and Islamists. Speaker 4 navigates the works of Bengali writers—all born outside East Bengal— to enunciate the manifold hauntings of the Partition in Bangladeshi literature.\n\nThis panel is part 2 of 2. It brings together authors of four new monographs and student discussants to delve into the complexities of early British colonial rule in South Asia, exploring themes of rationality, patrimony, and legal structures that made colonial discourse and effecting its rule possible. The first paper investigates the early colonial legal history under the East India Company's rule, questioning whether it established a rule of law or merely a rule by law, especially in relation to property rights and administration. The second paper delves into gendered property disputes in Awadh during the mid-19th century, highlighting how contested claims to royal patrimonies shaped notions of statehood and sovereignty. The third paper focuses on the financial intricacies within Baroda, showcasing indigenous actors' navigation of colonial economic frameworks to assert princely autonomy and economic viability. Finally, the fourth paper explores the concept of sovereignty in international law as applied to the princely states of colonial South Asia, analyzing jurisdictional politics and debates over legal status. These papers collectively offer a nuanced understanding of colonial governance, legal rationalization, economic strategies, and sovereignty dynamics in South Asia, shedding light on the interplay between colonial hegemony and indigenous agency. By examining historical contexts and power structures, the panel contributes to a broader discussion on the impact of colonialism on legal systems, economic landscapes, and political identities in the region, inviting critical reflections on the legacies of British imperial rule and its enduring effects on post-colonial societies. The Chair and Discussant are graduate students who will lead comments and critiques of the papers presented.\n\nThe state of Indian democracy has suffered a series of debilitating reversals since 2014. Amidst a climate of state-sanctioned anti-minority violence, dismantling of political institutions, and throttling of political dissent, the future of Indian democracy appears bleak. In this context, our panel revisits the idea of ‘margins’ and ‘marginality’ by presenting a narrative of resistance and care that animates the various cases under study. Two of our presentations ‘center’ the informal colonies or squatter settlements of the nation’s capital, New Delhi, and the practices of its inhabitants. The other two presentations draw attention to the political lifeworlds of Muslims in India, who have suffered the brunt of state repression and violence under the BJP. Speaker 1 foregrounds how informal doctors provide essential medical care to working poor residents in Delhi’s squatter settlements, whereas Speaker 2 investigates the legal claim-making efforts of the urban poor in New Delhi in the context of rising evictions and dispossession. Speaker 3 studies the contradictory and contested ways in which Muslims engage with the ascendancy of Hindu nationalist forces through Muslim political mobilization in Rampur, while Speaker 4 interrogates the anxieties and aspirations driving the political lifeworlds of Muslims in Assamese chars (riverine islands). The panel aims to recenter these spaces of spatial, socio-cultural, political, and economic marginality as nodes of incipient resistance and sustained care in contemporary India. In doing so, the panel offers an image of guarded optimism. At one level, these studies outline the long history of political exclusion and social oppression in these spaces that precede the BJP. At another level, these studies offer accounts of hope, defiance, and solidarity within these ‘margins’ that assume critical valency at a time when the presumptions underlying the promise of Indian democracy appear to be slipping rapidly.\n\nWater shapes our contemporary and historical worlds, from intimate, individualized scales, to vast global and geopolitical ones. In turn, the hydrosphere is shaped by contesting political, legal, cosmological, bureaucratic, aesthetic, cultural, and technoscientific concerns that render legible claims of territory, sovereignty, governance, belonging and livelihoods. This panel draws attention to the intersection of hydropolitics and mapping in colonial, postcolonial and contemporary South Asia to ask: How does mapping operate as a political technology of (il)legibility in watery spaces? What are the different mapping technologies at play in the hydrosphere, and what effects do they have on our understanding of the histories, politics, cultures, and ecologies in which they are deployed? And how does a transdisciplinary lens allow us to trace the intersections of water with caste, class, religion and citizenship in relation to increasingly precarious democracies and rising authoritarianism? By understanding mapping as a political technology as well as a lived experience, this panel highlights the constant tension between the politics of governance and the governed, and hence between sovereign space and lived place in the watery, soaking and muddied ecologies of South Asia. The four papers in this panel span a range of spatial and temporal hydrogeographies - from urban water infrastructures in colonial Madras, postcolonial water disputes between India and Pakistan in the Indus basin, and Cold War alliances to map the Indian Ocean, to contemporary negotiations about citizenship and nationhood in the border regions of Northeastern India. This interdisciplinary panel brings together anthropology, history, media studies, and science and technology studies to understand how the South Asian hydrosphere has been mapped. Drawing attention to the afterlives of British colonialism, partition and its still unraveling effects, and the rise of contemporary majoritarian politics, we cast light on the shared histories and ongoing intimacies of hydropolitics in South Asia.\n\nSeals and writing from the Indus Civilization (2600-1900 BCE) continue to receive considerable scholarly and public attention, and for good reasons. The script has yet to be deciphered, and the seals inscriptions are often engraved upon represent some of the best evidence of Indus administrative behaviors and technical virtuosity. A small but dedicated group of scholars across the world are applying new methods to study seals, writing, and the dynamic role both played in Indus organization and integration. For nearly 50 years, the Corpus of Indus Seals and Inscriptions (CISI) project headed by Dr. Asko Parpola and colleagues has been the primary source of data to study Indus seals and writing. As the project nears completion and fewer materials are recovered and published, how can we continue to study the earliest South Asian seals and writing and ensure accessibility? Given the significance of both in the development and fluorescence of the Indus Civilization, now is the time to prepare for the future of studying seals and writing after the completion of the CISI project. This session highlights current efforts and outlines future goals to ensure that what first identified and heralded the Indus as a unique, indigenous South Asian cultural phenomenon will continue to drive scholarship and public interest in the future.\n\nPromoting cordial interreligious relations is essential for reducing conflict between Hindus, Muslims, and others amid the religious plurality of South Asia. Likewise, it is crucial fo"
