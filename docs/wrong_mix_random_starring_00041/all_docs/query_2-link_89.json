        "text": "We interviewed Prashant Wase. After completing Bachelors in Business Systems (BIS), from University of Ballarat, Victoria, Australia, he took a plunge into writing. He penned down his first Novel “Its Complicated – An Uncommon love story of a common man” with “Notion Press”. Currently he is working as an EHS personnel in a private firm entrenched in Mumbai, Maharashtra.\n\nWhat inspired you to start writing?\n\nWriting always fascinated me. I started writing when I was in 3rd grade. My work never got published, because I never thought of getting published at that time. I used to write small fictional stories. I made a discrete notebook for that, till date I have that special book with me. I think writing is only element in my life, which never left me. I always believed in a quote by Benjamin Franklin – “ Either write something worth reading, or do something worth writing”.\n\nA need to create something of your own was always disturbing me. I focused then on writing, and thought; it would be my desire to see my own work that is printed and readers from all over the world read it. They not only read it but also appreciate it. The thought actually became my motivation. When I am in a writing phase, I cannot obliterate the feeling that I really want to do this.\n\nWhat did you like to read when you were a boy?\n\nIt was altogether a different era. I was mostly obsessed with cricket those days. Movies were only watched on TV. Less outing and more play was my routine. But a different liking was just developing. I was attracted towards comics. I used to read them during my exams, during my cricket matches, and moreover during travel. I love to read all comics from “Diamond comics, Tinkle series, Raj Comics (I read very few, but I use to love them too). Then I jumped on to international flavored comics like Richie Rich, Fighter Toads and many more. Then a day come when I felt that I was younger enough to read novels, it was quite late. I started with “Chetan Bhagat & Paulo Coelho”.\n\nWhat is the greatest challenge in writing a book?\n\nI learned a few things, which I like to mention:\n\na) Trust the thoughts: I have to stick to a particular thought, once I made a rough draft on what actually I had to write. No matter whatsoever my thinking process should not deviate.\n\nb) Focus on your Work: There will be plenty of distractions, in your home, where you work, with your mates anywhere, but your main focus should never be on other things. Focus on your writing because at that time, the most mattered element will be your writing.\n\nc) Working Conditions: I prefer to left alone while writing, a complete calm and peaceful place will boost up my ideas. Having supporter is very important. Sometime I found myself very itchy to share my ideas with somebody. At that time whatever concentration you give on your writing, will be far less than that itch.\n\nd) Choose and select wisely: There will be lots of characters running in your mind, while writing fiction, your focus should be on that one character whom you are describing at that particular frame of time. So choose wisely before selection.\n\ne) Believe in yourself: The greatest strength one has towards himself is his belief. I had to believe my instinct. Never try to think about the result. If you believe that you have given your best then it wont be that hard to digest if you fail. Because you know within that you did your best.\n\nHow much research do you do before writing the book?\n\nInteresting! Without research you cant go further. You have to do plenty of research because you have to make readers believe you. Stick to you. During Ensnared I did lots of research on “Aghori Practices, Tarot card reading, Black magic, White Magic and many more scary elements. The sources were Documentaries, movies, and some websites.\n\nWhat motivated you to write the book “Ensnared”?\n\nWell, I have an itch to do different. So I opted out Genres such as Romance. I started venturing how would thrill go with romance. This made me portray “Its Complicated” my first novel. But since I’d tried on romantic-thrill. I wanted to try something new. Horror-Thriller Genre always bewitched me. I love the part especially when the twist comes. So I thought why not to impersonate such a story, that would be full of twist, and every page would be filled with thrill. It will take you to the darkest phase of a life that you never ever imagined.\n\nCan you tell us more about your latest book “Ensnared”?\n\nNeil and Divya are perfect couple. Everything in their happy married life is turned upside down when Neil finds Divya behaving strangely. Similarly after sometime Neil’s behavior also gets affected. They are drawn towards an unnatural power that has ensnared them. Along with them their family and friends experience something which is unspeakable. Will they survive these hauntings? What is the secret behind their tragic fates? What will happen if they found themselves in a place from where they can’t escape? Every question has answers here. But can you handle the answers. If you can, then find it yourself.\n\nHow did you came up with the idea of writing Horror Thriller genre book?\n\nI just wanted to write a Horror Thriller, that’s it. Ha ha ha, jokes apart. My previous genre was romantic-thriller, I wanted to try something different this time, so I hacked down romance and replace it by a 6 letter haunting word “Horror”. I think people nowadays are attracted towards horror more. There are plenty of books that are on romance based. Where would you find horror? I want to define horror and make it that popular. So a day will come when a newbie author will redefine love because, everyone would be busy reading horror-thrillers.\n\nWho are your favourite authors?\n\nThere are plenty, I can talk all day but to name a few I love reading Agatha Christie, Paulo Coelho, Khaled Hosseini & Chetan Bhagat.\n\nHow much time do you dedicate for writing on a daily basis?\n\nI write only when a perfect plot is running in my mind. I do not stress myself every time to write. But what I love actually is to start early morning, as it is fresh, for 2-3 hours or less and at night before/after dinner, whatever suits me at that particular frame of time.\n\nWhat words of wisdom would you like to give to aspiring writers?\n\nAlways edit and proofread your book before publishing. Check proper punctuation and grammar. Above all don’t stress on writing do it whenever your mind is fresh. But do it, don’t deny writing. Make it a habit.\n\nRemember: If something’s troubling you and you’re unable to find a solution, write it down. Writing will help you in identifying yourself. So do write, not for others, only for yourself.\n\nYou can buy his book now:"
