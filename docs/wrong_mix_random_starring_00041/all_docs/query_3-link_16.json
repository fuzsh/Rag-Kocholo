        "text": "2022 Pineapple Award Winner\n\nCategory: Faculty\n\nNominator: Kanyanee Manapradit, Upoma Saha, Saheli San\n\nNomination: Professor Gulgin is very kind. She invited students for thanksgiving. We had tradition thanksgiving food and played games together. I was very impressed and would love to say thank you so much to her. Also it was my first thanksgiving here in US. All of my roommates left for their house celebrating Thanksgiving. I was staying upset in my hall. Because of Professor I was able celebrate the special day. I got to know that day, food and games. She personally came to pick us from our nearest bus stops. She was so kind and friendly. She introduced the culture of America. I like her so much. Thank you Dr. Gulgin.\n\nPersonal Statement: I think it takes a lot of courage for students to travel to another country and pursue further education. International students face challenges that others may never think about (language barrier, not owning a car, etc.). And, since international students can’t just jump in a car and go home to visit with family when they want, holidays can be especially hard because so many other students leave campus to be with family, dining options may be limited, and it can feel lonely. Thus, I decided to host a Thanksgiving meal and welcome anyone that wanted to come.\n\n2022 Pineapple Award Winner\n\nCategory: Staff\n\nNominator: Joseph Ohaeche\n\nNomination: I do think she is worthy of the Pineapple Award, for someone whom we have never actually connected or met in person, she has been selflessly dedicated towards assisting me in several ways and with several resources. Her assistance have come in many different amazing ways ranging in; KIND: Her words of encouragement when I was literally at my lowest sure gave me the needed boost of confidence needed to keep doing my best academically and also adapting to the whole new cultural and academic change (even though she not aware of what importance this played for me at that point till this moment).WITH RESOURCES: She always,(no matter the timing of the day) responded to my emails with (so much empathy) and provided different resources to help me with whatever issues/concerns I had at the moment. She single handedly had to make lots of calls to help with a good portion of my Winter Tuition (as I had difficulties getting funds from home due to some banking regulations with Forex in my home country). All of this she has done, even though I do feel is really not her responsibility, but she did with an open heart to help me feel comfortable adapting to living and schooling here.\n\nPersonal Statement: Growing up my family use to host international students each summer and my grandparents would also serve as host parents to international students attending Hillsdale College. Due to both of these experiences I have wonderful memories of getting to know students from all over the world. Those experiences growing up really helped shape me and my appreciation for students who travel abroad and study internationally. I’m always blown away by international students determination, resiliency and graciousness for their experiences. I consider it a huge privilege to be able to serve as an advocate to international students within my role, as a Student Support Manager, on campus.\n\n2022 Pineapple Award Winner\n\nCategory: Community Member\n\nNominator: Esther Noah, Abena Pinameng, Chibuzor Okoroafor\n\nNomination: From the time we met Kim and her family, they took us in like their own family. They gave me blankets, bedspreads, pillow covers, pillow, and some groceries to use while I settle in. They pick us up for church service every Sunday and send us to their house for lunch after church or take us out to a restaurant. They take us out shopping and sometimes bring us groceries in the middle of the week. After the international student office secured a date at the social security office, Kim picked me up from my apartment, drove me to their office, waited for me to complete my registration, and drove me back to campus. She also connected me to Anna Miller, a health administration to help me with an assignment (interview). The Johnston's include us in every plan they make for their family and make sure it favors us. Almost every friend I have made outside of campus is through them. Currently, they are helping all of us get our Drivers License. What I love the most about them is the way they grant us open access to their house, check up on us every week and continually keep us in their prayers. I can't imagine how life during the winter would have been for me as an international student if I had not met this lovely family.\n\nPersonal Statement: We're so blessed to be able to be a part of Neighbors International and the relationships we've been able to have with students because of this organization. Jim and I have always been interested in missions and have considered serving somewhere in our retirement. But God opened this door for us and brought \"the world\" to our home! Bringing four students to us from Ghana and Nigeria this year has been sheer joy. These kids worship with us each Sunday! So we're not only \"a family\" but we're able to share our faith together as well. Our eyes have been opened to beautiful cultures that are vastly different than our own... and yet connect our hearts over so many laughs, tears, prayers, food, games & experiences! It's often said that when you have children you experience your own childhood all over again. Having an International \"Friendship Family\" with our GVSU students is like experiencing life in Michigan, USA again! It is a pleasure & privilege beyond what we ever imagined. Thank you for providing us with this experience... we are very grateful! We sure do love you Nicholas, Chibuzor, Abena and Esther!\n\n2022 Pineapple Award Winner\n\nCategory: Student\n\nNominators: Shweta Terkar, Divyangi Rathore, Lohith Tummala, Vamsi Paturi, Brooke Schaut, Pravalika Kurella, Manjusha Borra, Kaylan Vanguri, Adilakshmi Jammigumpula, Ramya Narne, Rupesh Siddagunta, Venkata Kandimalla, Prashanth Rangavajhala, Venkatasiva Boyalla\n\nNomination: Nikhila is always ready to help. She treats everyone with respect. Nikhila is so strong and interactive with everyone and makes everyone feel comfortable when she is around. Nikhila embraces diversity and cultural inclusivity among her peers. She goes above and beyond what is expected to provide support and guidance to international students. She is very kind, generous and shows love towards the people who are new to the place or area, helps them all the possible ways she can.\n\nPersonal Statement: Grand Valley State University provided me many opportunities to network with people from all over the world. I consider myself blessed to have many friends at GVSU. Collaborating with people from many places, cultures, languages, and lifestyles has been a wonderful experience that has also helped me learn new things. Helping others and making new connections will help me stay positive and motivated.\n\nWinter 2021 Pineapple Award Winner\n\nCategory: Faculty\n\nNominator: Marigold Cobbina\n\nNomination: She has been a great mentor and friend. She always check up on me and ask about my needs. She is a very understanding supervisor as well and showed me both but kindness. She always tries to educate me on American culture and also learn from mine.\n\nPersonal Statement: I am honored to have been nominated by Marigold Cobbina for this award. She is a remarkable young woman that I’ve grown to value, loved and appreciate. Not only does she serve as my GA, but because of her culture and mine, we are connected beings. Additionally, having traveled to Ghana multiple times, I understand some of the nuisances and experiences Marigold brought with her. Amazingly, when I think of Marigold, and when I close my eyes, I see Ghana! Ghana is a beautiful country with a rich history. It’s people are welcoming and have embraced me and the students that travel with me with opened arms. They eagerly share their resources with us. Reciprocity is a part of the exchange as we too share our resources with them.\n\nWinter 2021 Pineapple Award Winner\n\nCategory: Faculty\n\nNominator: Divya Rudhrashetty\n\nNomination: Professor Jerry Scripps has always motivated and supported me through out the academic year. He makes students feel comfortable in his classes and makes his lectures interesting. He is kind, helpful and truly cares about his students.\n\nPersonal Statement: I have had the good fortune to travel to a few places in Europe. I would love to visit more countries but in lieu of that, it has been wonderful to get to know so many international students. They are so brave to come here to study and have many interesting things to share about their home countries. It is satisfying to learn something new as I struggle to overcome the cultural differences. For instance, in class I was trying to make an analogy using cooking with curry because there are so many Indian students in my class. I found out that curry is not that universally used in India, so my analogy fell a little flat. At least we had a good laugh at my expense.\n\nWinter 2021 Pineapple Award Winner\n\nCategory: Faculty\n\nNominee: Getrude Muthiani\n\nNomination: Being an international engineering student, adjusting to the workload of the course could be a bit challenging. Dr. Kandalaft was one of the professors who made me continue believing in my abilities and not give up on the course as a whole. He was willing to work with me at my pace he ensured to treat me as any other student, without partiality. This helped since being an international female student in the course could be a bit tough. He saw the potential in me, despite the times I would be struggling; he would encourage me as well as all the students in the class. He is a good professor and wants the best for his students.\n\nPersonal Statement: International Students contribute to the diversity and internationalization of their classrooms, campuses, and communities. They add different perceptions in the classroom and improve the common understanding and appreciation of the variances found around the world. Therefore, it is critical to embrace international students and to provide support and extra help specially that language can be a barrier for some of them. As faculty member, I try to listen to their problems and provide all the help needed for the class and any emotional issues that they might face being away from home.\n\nWinter 2021 Pineapple Award Winner\n\nCategory: Faculty\n\nNominator: Kushal Shrestha\n\nNomination: She is a perfect mentor. I couldn't have gone through my last semester without her encouragement and support. She's a professor every department needs. People like her are the reason students are motivated.\n\nPersonal Statement: In 1994 I was an international student at my alma mater and I remember how nerve wracking and generally alien those first few months were. Getting used to being so very far away from the familiar comforts of home, trying to make new friends, and finding your academic footing all at the same time was a disorienting experience. So when I interact with international students in my classes or as advisees at GVSU, I strive to create a stress-free and very positive environment where they can feel comfortable. I want them to know that I am there to help them navigate the academic and the inter-cultural. Because I remember what it felt like when even the most mundane act of ordering a sandwich in the university cafeteria seemed like trying to answer a series of questions in Klingon!\n\nWinter 2021 Pineapple Award Winner\n\nCategory: Staff\n\nNominator: Kartikey Tapiawala\n\nNomination: Coming to this school as an transfer international student has been a complicated process in the least and having an advisor that is always there for you and going above and beyond for you by reaching out to other people in the faculty for what you need. She's always willing to work with you and is excited to see your progression at and outside of GVSU.\n\nPersonal Statement: As an academic advisor, I am typically most involved with International Students when they first come to Grand Valley. However, that isn’t always the case, and many times I have students that I work with until they graduate. Even if it is just a simple class check in, I find working with international students very rewarding. I never got the chance to study abroad, or be an international student during my education, but I do try to imagine what it is like to be in a different country, away from your family, and working hard to navigate college life. I feel like many times students just need an advocate, and I am happy to help.\n\nWinter 2021 Pineapple Award Winner\n\nCategory: Community Member\n\nNominator: Kingsley Ikeata\n\nNomination: In every definition and qualification of the word, Amy and John are family. The last 2 years of knowing this family reaffirmed by faith in people and humanity. They not only opened their home to me, but made sure I understood that I am every bit of the family. From introducing me to other family members to giving me a room to always come back to whenever I want.\n\nAmy has been active in my academic, spiritual , and social life. She actively worked to get a placement for my internship, and even when it did you work out due to Covid-19, she extended the same effort by recommending me for full-time employment in her organization. Honestly, this page will never be enough to accommodate the many good deeds this family has done for me. They are so invested, my mother gave her a Nigerian name. We celebrated so many American holidays together, from the super bowl to Christmas. I can continue to make the humble case that nobody deceive the recognition more than Amy and John.\n\nPersonal Statement: It has been an honor to get to be part of Kingsley’s journey. We met him through Neighbor’s International as his Friendship Family. It has been so fun to add another member to our family for the time he has been here. We have been able to share our American holidays and traditions with him including how to prepare for Michigan winters as well as play in the lakes! We have loved learning about the traditions and culture of Nigeria as well. Often when we are together we get the chance to call and say hi to his family in Nigeria which has been fun. It’s great to know we have friends there now. We are very proud of Kingsley for his courage and his hard work. He is going to do great things!\n\nWinter 2021 Pineapple Award Winner\n\nCategory: Student\n\nNominator: Anusha Yalamanch\n\nNomination: Jeevan deserves this award for the hospitality he has shown towards me. He helped me tons from the initial days of my life in United States and in GVSU. He helped in finding my stay and made it ease for me to adjust and regulate myself during lockdown period. As a senior student he helped in studies by clearing doubts in situations when professors aren't available at particular times. He is very friendly in nature and helps every international student. Being far away from home he helped to overcome my home sick fear and helped and encouraged me to grow both professionally and personally. Because of Jeevan I have met a native family who really became very close and they treat me like their daughter. So I think Jeevan perfectly deserves Pineapple Award.\n\nPersonal Statement: God helps me each and every minute in my life and education, I try to help people around me within education, and even personally If I can, my involvement with international students is great, I meet a lot of students from India and other countries here in GVSU"
