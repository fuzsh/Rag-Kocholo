        "text": "June 5, 2024\n\nThe Spice Gate has a lot going for it: A really unique world and lore, solid commentary on class and intriguing characters. I was initially very intrigued, but I admit I had some trouble with this book.\n\nIt's a world built on spices: There are eight kingdoms, each one specialized on the production and trade of one particular spice. Travel, and as such trade, between these kingdoms is only possible through the mysterious spice gates, which allow almost instantaneous but also very painful jumps through space, basically. They're magic portals provided by a godlike creature called the Mouth. Apart from these gates, there's no way to get from one kingdom to the next because of the hellish outerlands surrounding them, which noone can survive.\n\nOur protagonist, Amir, is one of the people who can actually travel the spice gates, because not everyone can. This ability makes him a carrier, one who travels constantly in order to allow the trade of spices - even if it hurts every single time. He's also in love with the princess of one of the kingdoms, and his desire to visit her is what kicks of the plot of this book: His princess clearly has some secrets, and then there's a dying man sending him on a quest into a mysterious ninth kingdom, which is said to be nothing but a myth.\n\nThe unique setting is what's really interesting about Prashanth Srivatsa's debut novel. The lore is just fascinating. Sadly, the world building is rather rough. There is a lot of info dumping especially in the beginning chapters of the book, and a lot of it told in a not very engaging way (for example: One character telling the other character something both of them already know, you know that one). There is so much information thrown at the reader that I was just confused at some point. It took me a while to really understand what was going on.\n\nThe writing is generally solid, but the dialogues especially felt very wooden, stilted and lifeless. Srivatsa uses some exclamations and expletives that feel not only very repetetive but almost disruptive (and sometimes don't make sense, i.e. the use of \"Gates!\", which are just objects and not ones this society worships either).\n\nThe characters are interesting on paper, but I never really felt emotionally attached to any of them, not even Amir. I thought him inconsistently written at times, and the characters in general don't feel fleshed out. Their relationships aren't written in an engaging way either. The romance between Amir and his princess felt fake to me until the end because I felt nothing between them and Harini barely has a personality. There is a lot of tell as we are told he loves her, but there's no actual show. I probably would have preferred there to just not be a romance. I also felt like there was so much potential to explore interesting character dynamics - Ilangovan, for example, has been talked about so much it's close to hero worship on Amir's part, and then when we finally meet the big pirate king, he's just.... kind of a dude who's there.\n\nSo yes, this novel has a really great premise, an amazing world and great commentary. But I sadly didn't care about the characters nor particularly engaged with the plot, so I found myself skim reading at some point because I did want to find out the conclusion.\n\n2,5 stars, rounding up because of the unique setting.\n\nMany thanks to HarperCollins and Netgalley for the arc!\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\nThank you to NetGalley and Harper Voyager for the e-arc in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.\n\n2.5, rounded up\n\nThe Spice Gate has a really punchy premise that combines high fantasy worldbuilding with political critique. Amir is a “Carrier”; someone born with a mark identifying him as an individual who is capable of travelling through the Spice Gates, portals to other realms. Each realm cultivates a unique spice native to them, and trades it for a high price. Yet, the Carriers in The Spice Gate who make this lucrative trade possible are fated for a life of slavery and poverty. Amir is enraged by the injustice of his world and longs to escape it, with his mom and brother in tow. Basing a universe on the spice trade is very clever, and got me really excited about this book.\n\nUnfortunately, for me this novel did not meet the big expectations it set for itself. The opening of this book is in a rush to get started, making it not as engaging as it could be. It contains a lot of info-dumping without a lot of explanation; it feels like it’s trying to get the worldbuilding out of the way so it can tell its story. For example, take this sentence from roughly page two: “Of course, Amir was not certain if Ilangovan was even in Vanasi — no one could ever really know where he’d be when he was not in the Black Coves; the renegade Carrier was as much a spirit as a pirate. But there was one thing Amir was certain was in Vanasi: the Jewelmaker’s Poison” (citation below). This is so much lore about the world to absorb so early in the novel. It does all get explained later, but as you’re beginning a book you need something (often characters) to ground you in the world.\n\nThis brings me to the other issue I had with this novel: I didn’t really care about the characters. I did find that as I kept reading I started to like Amir a bit more, but I still feel like he’s not super engaging. His initial argument with Hasmin felt really stilted. His dialogue in general felt stilted. The use of “ho” as an expletive (in the linguistic/grammatical sense) would have felt more natural had Amir’s style of speech been more fantasy-esque. As it is, Amir talks like a modern person, which made the interjections of “ho” feel really awkward. It took me out of the world instead of further immersing me.\n\nThis book did have some very good moments of tension. Amir being chased by Fylan and then not making it back to the Gate in time to return to Raluha with the Carriers was so well written. I really enjoyed that part. I think several more rounds of editing and/or beta reading could have made this a pretty good book.\n\nPrashanth Srivatsa. The Spice Gate (Kindle Locations 99-101). Kindle Edition.\n\nWant to read\n\nDecember 10, 2023\n\nholy shit, this cover is exquisite\n\nApril 3, 2024\n\nI received an advanced reader's copy of this book.\n\nWelcome to a world of spice. Spice is everything-money, magic, medicine, drugs, religion and regular old seasoning. I have never read a book that described scents and taste so elaborately. If only the relationships were described that well.\n\nAmir has been born with the spice mark on his throat so he must be a Carrier--someone who transports the spices to the eight kingdoms through a magic portal. The work is hard and the transport painful, but Cariers are the only ones who can do it naturally without Poison which is not made in any of the kingdoms. Despite everyone's dependence on spice, Carriers are the lowest in society presumably because of a bad past life.\n\nAmir wants to save his family from their harsh life but it seems more an obligation than devotion. All we know about his mother is that she is pregnant with an illegitimate child and cooks well. His younger paints. His father deserted the family years ago.\n\nAmir is in love with a princess who is beautiful, kind and cares for her people just like all good princesses.\n\nThere is a large cast of bad guys whose motivation is to keep things the way they are.\n\nThe second thing that bothered me was the book seemed very critical of the caste system and the religion that instills it (presumably Hinduism since the author is Indian). Maybe it's because I'm western but the religion in this book did not quite make sense. The god is some cross between the asteroid monster and Jabba the Hut creature that poops out spice. It supposedly created spice and the gates so that people would have order so that civilizations could be created. In return the god seems to be a prisoner of the mysterious ninth kingdom. It really didn't make sense to me but I tried to just go with the flow because I did like Amir and wanted to see how he would end up.\n\nJanuary 27, 2024\n\nGet ready to be swept away by a mesmerizing tale of adventure, intrigue, and self-discovery! In a world where spice is power and freedom comes at a steep cost, Amir's journey will captivate and inspire you. With a richly woven narrative, this book masterfully explores the complexities of power dynamics, addiction, and the human spirit. I was particularly struck by the way the author wove themes of social justice and resistance into the story, making it a thought-provoking and timely read. You'll be drawn to the vivid characters, heart-pumping action, and mythical world-building that will leave you breathless. This story has it all: gods, assassins, throne-keepers, and slaves, all vying for control in a world where the spice trade holds the keys to power. Amir's transformation from a downtrodden Spice Carrier to a hero who must choose what kind of world he wants to live in will leave you cheering. I loved how the book kept me on the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next. Do yourself a favor and dive into this epic tale – your imagination will thank you!\n\nThank you Netgalley and Harper Voyager for the advance copy ♥️\n\nJuly 23, 2024\n\nThe Spice Gate opened and welcomed me to a fascinating world of adventures, quests, magic, rich aromas, and love. For a debut novel, the world-building is particularly well done. Typically, I find extensive world-building to be a distraction from the main plot. While books like Dune, LOTR, and ASOIAF are not up my alley, this novel handled it skillfully in the first few chapters, setting the stage before diving into character development and the plot.\n\nThe story follows the protagonist, Amir as he tries to escape his poverty ridden town to in search of a better life for his family. The detailed descriptions of the kingdoms and characters made them easy to visualize, and I feel the story could be adapted into a movie. The names of the characters were especially satisfying, blending Indian influences with a touch of Mughal and fantasy elements, making them roll off the tongue easily (eg: Illindhi, Fylan, Talahshukh, Madhyra etc).\n\nWhile the pacing felt slow initially, it picked up after a few chapters and became very engaging. The characters were so well-developed that I found myself thinking about them even when I wasn't reading, especially Amir and his emotions throughout the story.\n\nAs a tea lover, a book that devotes almost a chapter about the flavor and aroma of ginger tea, has my heart.\n\nOverall, The Spice Gate by Prashanth Srivatsa impressed me with its vivid world-building and engaging characters. 10/10 recommend! (Extra points for the amazing cover)\n\nJune 14, 2024\n\nTell me a fantasy story is based on something other than medieval Europe and you’ll have my attention. Tell me it’s based on Indian culture and oh boy I’m going to obsess over it.\n\nOk, I’ll obsess over the story in a moment but first, let me gush about the writing for a second. Srivatsa’s prose in the Spice Gates is phenomenal! So much in fact that I’m honestly shocked that this is his debut novel because if he’s already on that level at his worst I can’t wait to see him with a decade of experience under his belt. He is one of these authors whom I like to call painters in the sense of him being able to paint incredibly vivid images with his words. I could feel, sense, and most importantly, smell and taste the world as I was reading. Truly I can’t describe how good the writing is.\n\nAs for the story itself, this is very much a fantasy story. What I mean by that is if you’re the type of reader who wants his fantasy worlds to have so many details to dig into then you’ll really enjoy the Spice Gate. This is not the type of book that you can read while a part of your mind is thinking about the errands you have to run. This, as any great fantasy novel should, demands your attention. The world is incredibly well detailed and the time and care Srivatsa put into planning and building this world will become very clear very fast.\n\nAnother reason why the Spice Gate demands attention while reading it is the themes. This story deals with heavy themes such as class and religion and I think Srivatsa did an incredible job exploring these topics while also driving the plot forward, focusing on his character work, and introducing us to the world. I think choosing spice as the narrative key was a very smart choice from the author. I won’t get much into this because 1) spoilers and 2) it’s more my personal interpretation, but as someone who loves to read about history I know how something as trivial as spice can change the entire world order. If you don’t believe me, I encourage you to look into the European colonial era and you’ll see the real-world equivalent of spice addiction.\n\nAs for our protagonist, Amir, what I can say here while keeping this review spoiler-free is that I LOVED the internal struggles he had to process throughout the story. But I think the part I appreciated the most was that Srivatsa was able to balance working on Amir’s character arc and making it a focal point while also keeping the sense of the grandeur of the world present. Throughout the story and despite Amir being the focus and my investment in his story, I couldn’t help but feel that he is just one person in a colossal world that could crush him at any moment and not even notice his destruction. That’s such a delicate balancing act and I really hope readers notice how incredibly difficult it is to pull it off and how talented the author has to be to keep that balance maintained throughout the story.\n\nThe Spice Gate is an incredible debut by Prashanth Srivatsa. It’s a colorful, epic, heartfelt, and intelligently written story that will open your eyes to the endless possibilities of fantasy once more authors can introduce their unique cultural backgrounds into the genre. At the end of my review, I can’t help but echo my initial thoughts: if that is how Srivatsa’s debut looks like I sure can’t wait to see what he does next.\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\n3.5 ⭐️’s rounded up!\n\nTo start: Srivatsa’s writing is absolutely phenomenonal throughout. The imagery was so vivid at every turn - I could really visualize each part of the story. Srivatsa’s technique is especially prevalent when describing the sights and smells of the world. The bazaars, the spices, the environment - it all was so intriguing from the get go. I also enjoyed the opportunity to dive into a fantasy story that was based on a culture other than medieval England! The inclusion of classic Indian dishes, phrases, and clothing made the story that much more immersive and it really was a breath of fresh air to read something new!\n\nNow, onto the story itself. As with many fantasy stories, this one is on the denser side. The world building is super in-depth and thought out, but there were a few times when I had no clue what was going on, so it was definitely a “trust the process” kind of book. Many times, it’s paid off! Sometimes, however, it didn’t and I was left more confused than anything. I felt this way specifically about the last chapter of the book (not the epilogue); I think the conflict was resolved too quickly here, which is ironic considering I thought some parts were too drawn out. I also didn’t really understand how Amir killed the Mouth (the world’s God), and that’s a confusion I’m still left with - at the tail end of 400 pages, I think this affected my opinion of the overall story a little. I also think the story suffered from too many “here’s the new conflict or obstacle that our protagonist must overcome” scenarios. This, for me, contributed to the drawn-out feeling I had while reading some parts of the story.\n\nBack to the world building! The world building was heavily dependent on themes of religion and class, and I think Srivatsa explored these well. It was really interesting to read about myth and religion and how that can negatively inform class division and create servant classes that are justified by those beliefs. I think these themes were treated carefully and they seemed realistic to me. I also enjoyed the exploration of (spice) addiction and how that can affect how a world operates - if anything, I’d have liked to see this more!\n\nThe characters: aside from the sometimes bogged down story, the characters are where the book fell a little flat for me. I didn’t really care about any of them. Amir, the main character, wasn’t likable or unlikable per se, but his constant internal struggle got a little old after a while. I also feel like this is a plot driven story where Amir is mostly pushed around by events and circumstances, rather than him making big decisions or “leading” the story himself. This made him “meh” to me as a reader. I also didn’t care about his relationship with Harini because the reader sees none of this in real-time. Amir tells us they’ve had great times together, but that’s all we get, so this part of the “love story” was a little lackluster.\n\nThe end: in addition to the confusion of how Amir killed the Mouth (which he himself doesn’t understand - this seems like an authorial way to escape having to explain things…), I feel a little empty about the end. I agree that destroying the spice gates made sense for the story, but I think more exploration of the world after such a monumental shift is needed. It is hinted that this shift if difficult to handle, but it definitely needed more! Maybe this will be explored in a sequel? Or maybe the readers have the freedom to imagine how it all works out in the end? 🤷🏼‍♀️\n\nDefinitely some high points in this story, and I’m glad to have read it! I’d love for a map or an extensive index to be added to the book for ease of reading. I love fantasy and I probably would have come across The Spice Gate on my own eventually, but I’m grateful for the advanced reader copy and GoodReads giveaways!\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\nA Sensory Feast of Fantasy (5/5 stars)\n\nPrashanth Srivatsa's debut novel, The Spice Gate, is a whirlwind adventure that tantalizes the senses and ignites the imagination. Step into a world where eight vibrant kingdoms, each defined by a distinct spice and culture, are linked by mystical portals. These Spice Gates, however, are not freely accessible. The burden falls upon the marked ones, the gatecaste, who carry the weight of both spices and societal oppression on their backs.\n\nAmir, our protagonist, is a Spice Carrier yearning for a life beyond servitude. His journey takes a dramatic turn with the emergence of a mysterious new spice, throwing the delicate balance of power into chaos. Srivatsa masterfully weaves a narrative that is both thrilling and thought-provoking. The world-building is sumptuous, with each kingdom bursting with sensory details that bring the story to life. You can practically smell the heady cardamom of Zairza or feel the fiery kick of chilies from Dharia.\n\nBut The Spice Gate is more than just a culinary adventure. It's a story that delves into the complexities of social justice and the fight for freedom. Amir's determination to carve his own path is both inspiring and relatable. The supporting characters are equally well-developed, each with their own motivations and agendas that add depth and intrigue to the plot.\n\nSrivatsa's prose is captivating, drawing you deeper into this world with every turn of the page. The action sequences are heart-pounding, while the quieter moments resonate with emotional truth. The Spice Gate is a debut that announces the arrival of a major new talent in fantasy fiction. This is a novel that will stay with you long after the last page is turned.\n\nHighly recommended if you like:\n\n• Unique and richly-developed fantasy worlds\n\n• Stories that explore themes of social justice and rebellion\n\n• Strong protagonists with relatable struggles\n\n• Action-packed adventures with a touch of mystery\n\nFull disclosure: I was an alpha reader on Prashanth's Spice Gate. And it was one of the most rip-roaring fantasies I've had the pleasure of reading. Seeing it transform from it's initial variations to the draft we have in front of us as readers has been a journey that was in many ways as exciting as Amir's.\n\nFans of food, colors and the deep riches of the different world cultures will love the story of Amir's travels and his long journey home.\n\nApril 30, 2024\n\nAmir is born to a life of slavery. He is gatecaste and branded with the spicemark, so his only purpose in life is to carry spices through the gates that connect the eight kingdoms. Passing through a gate is like being torn apart, and he will do anything to prevent his younger brother from suffering the same fate. In pursuit of this goal, he’s soon caught between the machinations of the abovefolk and the outlaws. Myth bleeds into reality, and he stumbles upon a monumental discovery that will irrevocably upset the balance of power.\n\nInspired by Indian myths, this is an engrossing and adventurous debut. The complexities of the Spice Trade contribute to the vast and rich world-building, and the idea of spices as a source of power and magic is uniquely fascinating. Amir won’t be bound by a life of dead dreams and subjugation, and his struggle has significant emotional impact. This is a sweeping, smart, and heartfelt tale that is perfect for those who enjoy action-packed epic fantasy about family, survival, and the steadfast strength of the oppressed.\n\n(This review was originally written for Library Journal magazine.)\n\nMay 15, 2024\n\nWhat's a fantasy fiction if it doesn't open up your mind to new ideas? Without getting into any major spoilers I'd like to mention that just the premise of basis everything on spice trade is exciting - probably something that did happen in some distant past. A completely new magic system, intricately written characters, exploring distinctly different kingdoms and all this at an extraordinary pace makes the spicegate a very interesting and refreshing read!\n\nJune 2, 2024\n\nA bit lost for words, and not for the best reasons either. Review to come! ✨\n\n(FINAL REVIEW:)\n\nThis book is a bit of a paradox for me because I was enamored with the way the different worlds were depicted and the importance of the spices to their respective kingdoms, but was so annoyed with the protagonist and how he flipped flopped on his stance so often that it left me confused as to how he came to his final decision. 🤨\n\nThe story follows Amir, a Carrier from the kingdom of the spice saffron, Raluha. He’s from the gatecaste, the people who can traverse the gates for the highly sough after spices of other kingdoms, but at the great cost of pain. As a westerner, I probably will never understand the caste system, but as a POC reader, I can see how the prejudices have taken a toll on Amir and have shaped his view of the “abovefolk.” He’s tired of being seen beneath others simply because of the mark that ousts him as a Carrier. The doctrine that the world’s religion he’s grown up with believes he deserves his status in life, while he and some other Carriers believe there’s more to life than simply one’s position in the order of things. The book deals a lot with this theme to the point it starts feeling a bit preachy, but other than this, my other main issue with the book is that Amir is CONSISTENTLY changing his mind and stance on the rebellion he accidentally finds himself a reluctant participant in. It was so much flipping back and forth that I honestly couldn’t keep track of his reasonings and how he came to his final conclusion. 🫨\n\nThe side characters were good, but there wasn’t really a whole lot to them in the first place. Kalay is the abovefolk assassin he lectures to the majority of the book that acts like a contrast to his personal view; his love interest in the princess, Harini, of another kingdom is too fairytale-like for my liking; Hasmin is just the stereotypical a-hole who just refused to see a different perspective no matter how much it literally gets punched into him; and Karim bhai just acts more like his moral compass than anything. The latter I honestly found myself more interested in because of his complex beliefs and background. 😐\n\nAll in all, the beauty of the world, its wonderful world building, and use of the different spices just felt horribly juxtaposed to characters that I found myself not really caring for. I’m honestly sad that I didn’t enjoy it as much as I was hoping to. But regardless, thank you to Harper Voyager and NetGalley for accepting my request to read this eARC in exchange for an honest review. 🫶🏼\n\nPublication date: June 25!\n\nOverall: 3/5 ⭐️\n\nJune 6, 2024\n\n3.5 ⭐\n\n“The Spice Gate” is an adult fantasy novel written by Prashanth Srivatsa. A book with a fascinating premise and a beautiful cover, which unfortunately did not fully convince me. I appreciated the evocative and lyrical prose, the extremely large, complex and well described world building, and the powerful story with a decidedly epic atmosphere. The narration proceeds slowly, with sometimes long chapters, taking its time to explore and set events in motion. What left me rather lukewarm were the characters, in my opinion superficially and coldly drawn. I could not bond with them, they conveyed nothing to me, and this made me indifferent to their events. I'm very sorry for this feeling, because otherwise I enjoyed the novel very much.\n\nThank you to the Publisher and NetGalley for giving me an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.\n\nJune 3, 2024\n\nThanks to NetGalley and Harper Voyager for early access to this book!\n\nI enjoyed this book once I got about half way through. It took me awhile to understand what was happening and really grasp the conflict of the story. I found some of the character relationships a bit underwhelming, particularly the relationship between Amir and Harini. It just didn’t really do anything to the story for me. The plot was super fun and unique once I got into the book and I enjoyed the story!\n\nShelved as '2024'\n\nJune 4, 2024\n\n📱 Thank you to NetGalley and Harper Voyager\n\nRead\n\nFebruary 18, 2024\n\nThe intrigue of this book is insane. I was totally enthralled by all the magic and mystery of this book. The beautifully written characters and storyline were so incredible and I couldn’t believe the marvels I was reading about. The adventure of that these strong characters are embarking on is truly amazing, and I enjoyed learning about the mythical land they were apart of. Thank you Avon and Harper Voyage for sending me an ARC of this book.\n\nJune 17, 2024\n\nThanks to the publisher for the ARC. The plot of this book and most of the worldbuilding were fantastic (pun intended). The one complaint was in the religious aspect of it as I just found the god to be gross and that bothered me continually throughout. The kingdoms and cultures and peoples were beautiful. The plot kept me guessing until the very end and I had to know what would happen next. Overall a very good read.\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\n(3.75 ⭐) The Spice Gate was a colorful & creative standalone epic fantasy – while the world building wasn’t quite integrated smoothly and the dialogue was a bit awkward at times, I really appreciated the vision and journey.\n\nIn a land of eight distant kingdoms, spices are both power and balance. Each kingdom cultivates one critical spice, and each kingdom is connected to the others only through the magical Spice Gates, a gift from an ancient and powerful god.\n\nAmir is a Carrier – the spicemark on his shoulder distinguishes him as a person who can travel through the Gates and transport spices from kingdom to kingdom. Though Carriers are critical to every aspect of society, they are a terribly oppressed group, essentially treated as slaves. Amir experiences extreme pain, both from moving through space in moments and from the sacks on his back, and he fears for the day his kid brother will enter the trade.\n\nHe dreams of escaping the kingdoms and their cruel royalty altogether, and all he needs is one vial of the Poison (which will help his spicemark-less pregnant mother travel through the gates alongside her sons to live among rebellious pirates). But as Amir searches for his freedom, he gets sucked into a deeper conspiracy – and perhaps a revolution against everything he thought was true about his world.\n\nI think this book has a challenging start - there’s a lot of info & lore tossed at you all at once in a bit of a clumsy way - and I can see a lot of readers DNFing this one. However, if you’re comfortable diving into new fantasy worlds and open to being a bit confused throughout the first chunk, I think it’s worth it.\n\nIt’s a story about fighting back against oppression & the costs of revolution and reshaping, what it means to re-evaluate ancient traditions through a more just lens, and about what it means to be a good parent, child, and sibling.\n\nThe romance element here is between Amir and Harini, a young woman who is also a throne keeper. Harini very readily dismisses the way she has been raised to view the world (we see this briefly in a flashback) and is wholeheartedly there for Amir. In my opinion, the nature of Amir and Harini’s relationship is a little too fairytale-esque when paired with the more brutal elements of their hierarchical world. I just don’t buy that Harini is SUCH an inherently good soul that she is able to immediately see past everything she has been told.\n\nAs far as the writing goes, I generally found it quite compelling. The dialogue was the biggest issue (differentiating between character voices, leaning into cliches, mixing words so it felt partially fantastical and partially modern, and so on). But the descriptions of places and the inventiveness of the magic system really let the author’s creativity shine, and I thought the action scenes were well done.\n\nMy favorite elements were most definitely the mythological ones. The description of the ancient god was visceral and chilling. And the beasts who prowled the outer forests were just as good. The sensory elements (how the spices smelled - how they brought up emotions & memories - the tastes of food) were really beautiful, too.\n\nCW: death (parent), classism, murder, gore, animal death, grief, abandonment, addiction, mental health, vomit, excrement\n\nFollow me on TikTok for book recommendations!\n\n(I received a free advance reader copy of this book; this is my honest review.)\n\nMay 19, 2024\n\nARC provided by the publisher in exchange for a fair review.\n\n“The shadows within the towers spoke of strange secrets, of alchemy and spells and the abodes of reclusive chroniclers, astrologers, and mantravaadis whose rooms reeked of ink, coffee, and sacred ash, and whose windows were curved into the roofs so that they had a clear view of the nights skies with stars that shone upon Vanasi brighter than on any other kingdom.”\n\nThis is the tale of Amir, a Gate caste, or Carrier, the lowest of the low born in a society that depends on Carriers to carry, and his personal rebellion to find a better life for his family. Carriers are born with the spicemark upon their skin that allows them to travel through gates to far flung empires to keep the spice trade, upon which all wealth is built, alive. But they are repressed, beaten and cursed upon at every turn by those who desperately need them. The author has woven the depth of the injustice of the lower castes just as strongly into the fabric of the story as he has portrayed the incredibly lush world. We follow Amir as he travels from kingdom to kingdom carrying spices all the while seeking knowledge that will set him and his family onto the path of freedom from their oppressors. He is not seeking to change the world, only to save his small family. And in that is the problem I had with the story. There was a whole will he or won’t he arc going on in the story. He has role models who have stood up to the oppressors, his own morality is telling him to do more but he still rails against taking the next step to think outside his own box. The author did not do enough to instill in me the belief that Amir was so stuck in his own reality that he could not think outside of it.\n\n“A revolution in the Bowl cannot come to pass until each bowler revolts against their self first.”\n\nAnd this is why I spent the entire book just not really meshing with Amir as a character. I kept rooting for him to think bigger as horrible things continued to happen to those around him. But he just didn’t fully grasp the concept until circumstances forced him to make decisions that would affect everyone. I did though think that the secondary characters really shone in this story, my favorite was Karim bhai, a mentor to Amir. His motivations were clear, and he was strongly in the camp of trying to make the world a better place within the sphere of his influence, which he had been cultivating his entire life. The worldbuilding was fantastic. The kingdoms came alive not only visually, but in scents and sounds. I appreciated that their distance from each other was not lines on a map but in the way the trees grew, or the people dressed, or the buildings were built to represent the individual climates. And the writing style was also a win for me, descriptive, without being too flowery, with a fine balance between imagery and dialogue. The plot moved forward in a clear forward motion and when we finally got to the intrigue it was also done well. Overall, the worldbuilding won me over and if the author were to pursue more books in this world, I will read them, and I do recommend this book. 6.9 on the cawpile table rounding to a solid 4.0\n\nJuly 7, 2024\n\nmy blog // my twitter\n\nThank you to Netgalley and Harper Voyager for sending me this ARC in exchange for an honest review! 💖\n\nThe Spice Gate is a colorful debut that ultimately dragged on for too long—though I look forward to Prashanth Srivatsa’s future works.\n\nAs is typical of high fantasy stories, the worldbuilding is dense and potentially overwhelming. Amir is a Carrier, an underdog in a society in which the magical spice trade is instrumental to each kingdom and each individual’s lifeways. It is also a system that is heavily class-divided, and I enjoyed Srivatsa’s use of characters from all castes to critique the creation of subservient groups, especially the lens of myth and religion through which some justify sustaining these systems. Amir was relentless in insisting the system was unjust, even as he acknowledge the beauty and opulence these divisions could foster, and I found it realistic that he clashed with others who shared his ideals but not his vision for realizing them.\n\nSrivatsa ensured that within the wide cast of characters, each had something to contribute; Karim bhai’s compassion, for instance, or princess Harini’s frustrating resolve. In such a multilayered world and among such robust characters, however, I felt that Amir almost fell out of the picture. He was frequently dragged along by conflicts, and it seemed like despite his convictions, he rarely acted; much of his complexity stayed internal or confined to his dialogue. It sounds harsh, but I would’ve liked to see him grow more of a spine by the end, without sacrificing his sense of smallness that reinforces the improbability of his mission.\n\nDespite the meticulousness of the worldbuilding, I often lost sight of the plot. Many times I was able to trust the process and come to an understanding of the snowballing conflicts, but by latter half of the book, I could tell I was just trying to power through. Some of that was likely due to my ambivalence toward Amir, but I also think Amir’s heroic scene should’ve been expanded, and earlier extended scenes could’ve been omitted/shortened.\n\nAll that said, Srivatsa’s language was enriching, clever, and well-suited for the high fantasy genre. I would certainly another one of Srivatsa’s books, I just think that The Spice Gate missed the mark for me.\n\nJune 15, 2024\n\nI'm sitting around a 3.5 star rating for this one.\n\nOverall, this book was fine, but I think it could have been better.\n\nSrivatsa's prose was impeccable, though! He painted a really great picture of the world, the different kingdoms that we saw, the spices, etc.\n\nI do think some of the characters could have used a bit more oomph. Some felt a bit archetype-ish, which is fine, I just would have preferred more complexity. For example, Harini felt a little too perfect, especially as we got more of her toward the later portion of the book.\n\nNow, Amir as the main character. He was an unwilling hero who just wanted freedom for his family, and was pushed into this political conflict without much choice. We got a lot of his internal conflict and confusion, though that back and forth could get grating at times even if it was understandable. There was a side character that kept implying Amir's fate was to be a savior for his people, and I didn't love that aspect. He didn't feel like he had enough agency throughout the story to then also be given the burdens of heroism by friends, enemies, and a god. Honestly, there were points where I wondered why the character he was traveling with needed him?\n\nMy main issues with the book that kept it from getting a higher rating were pacing, and world building elements. There was a big lull for me in the mid portions of the book that kept making it hard for me to pick back up. There were also moments where the tension was high, but would get interrupted with explanations or memories, therefore cutting the tension immediately.\n\nThe worldbuilding in all was actually not too bad. As I said previously, the author is great at painting the imagery of the world with his prose. But I did find myself confused by some of the historical and political references, and the magic system. I have questions that were never answered, and likely won't be since I think this is a stand alone. But I'm also so grateful it's a stand alone! More single book fantasies, please!\n\nCWs: slavery, oppression/caste system, battle scenes, murder, death of parent, harm to children, bodily fluids\n\nI don't regret reading The Spice Gate, I just wish it was a little stronger.\n\nThank you to Harper Voyager for the ARC!\n\nJuly 16, 2024\n\nI voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book. All thoughts and opinions are my own.\n\n3-3.5 stars for this one.\n\nThe Spice Gate is an ambitious epic fantasy debut with an incredible world building. The setting is mesmerizing. The eight kingdoms' economies and societies depend on the Spice trade that happens through the Spice Gates and the Carriers. Carriers are people born with a mark and are seen as inferior. They're treated inhumanely. They travel through the Spice Gates and carry spices between kingdoms. They suffer a great deal of pain to travel through the Gates apart from the torture they endure by the abovefolk--the ones who live above the Carriers. The premise sounds super intriguing and unlike anything else. However, there was a lot of info dumping. Pages and pages of descriptions that were well written but it was too much.\n\nThe main character was Amir whose family has struggled very much. His father left them, a d his mother was left with raising two boys. Like the other Carriers and their families, they endured a lot, but sadly, that's all I can say about Amir. He loves a noble lady and his family, and he really tries to help both. But he didn't have anything distinctive about him. I couldn't tell you if he's a introvert or extrovert for example. I found him very passive. Towards the end, he makes some decisions that aren't forced on him, but I couldn't really feel invested in him because I didn't get to know him much. In fact, I didn't look forward to any character.\n\nThe plot was slow in the first half. Amir was unsure and indecisive and unaware of much. Things sped up somewhat in the second half, but the info dump continued so it was a bit hard to get excited over the few things that happened.\n\nHowever, not all books need to be character-driven and not all books need to follow the same storytelling principles. The worldbuilding was beautiful (though, I do wonder why the Spice Gates were full of feces from some point??!!! That part didn't get.) If you enjoy non-Western settings, South Asian settings, epic fantasy, and would like to try a non-character-driven book, I recommend this one.\n\nThis is also the August pick for a box, and I renewed my sub. I hope the edges are beautiful.\n\nFebruary 2, 2024\n\nIf your scriptures tell you to treat someone as sub-human, are they meant to be followed? Should a world be allowed to continue to thrive, exist, as long as some of its inhabitants are in subservience, in misery?\n\nPrashanth Srivatsa's rousing feat of imagination, \"The Spice Gate\" tackles the above questions while giving us a thoroughly magical secondary world, where Spices hold power, and multiple kingdoms are entrenched in political turmoil and an uneasy truce over the control of said spices. In \"The Spice Gate\", Amir is a spice-carrier, a gatecaste, is branded by birth to do one job and one job only - to carry spices across portals to kingdoms. Amir hasn't known a better life, but boy, does he want it! If not for him, but for his mother, and even more so, for his brother, whom he fears would meet the same fate as him. But when Amir stumbles upon a super-spice, that might just topple the balance of power across Kingdoms, his fate dangles precariously.\n\nThe book doesn't waste any time plunging us into the fraught, often brutal world, giving us searing insights into Amir's struggles and his personal stakes. Page by page, chapter by chapter, Prashanth deftly weaves one story thread upon another, presenting us with a great mosaic, a vast canvas of a world that feels utterly lived in, but also immensely alien. Amir is a protagonist constantly worth rooting for, and cheering for, but it's also some of the other characters you'll come to love and want to spend more time with. The absolutely riveting climax would leave you gasping for breath, and the book will certainly leave you wanting for more.\n\nJuly 13, 2024\n\nThe Spice Gate by Prashanth Srivatsa is a fantasy unlike anything I have personally read before. We enter into a world where spices are the currency and entry into a new city through a can only be entered by carriers. However, something is amiss. With a world full of spices, assasins, kings, queens, and immortal creatures, this book takes a reader into a world that is intriguing as well as mesmerizing.\n\nAmir is a carrier and wants a better life for himself and his family. Carriers are an essential part of all eight kingdoms but are treated as outcasts. They carry precious spices, but they themselves don't have them for their households. Will Amir be able to figure out a way for the betterment of his family?\n\nI was intrigued by the premise of this book when I requested this on Netgalley. The world building of this story is amazing. I loved that part of the book. However, I wish that this book would have been a duology, and the author had developed the world and characters a bit more. The initial 30% of the book I struggled with because there was so much information dumped. I had a hard time following the characters. I persevered, and I am glad that I did, though. Everything becomes a little later. It's a prose heavy story, and the reader needs a bit of patience. I would be definitely keeping this author in my wishlist for their future books.\n\nThank you, Avon and Harper Voyager, for this book.\n\nJune 30, 2024\n\nA brilliantly crafted world! I absolutely love the unique elements of this book. The spice trade, the caste system, the portals, all of it!\n\nIf you read and liked Spin of Fate by A. A. Vora, you absolutely need this book in your life. The conflicts within society and within the main character are similar, though each book is truly unique.\n\nAmir is young, naive, and sees everything though a limited view. However, he does grow as he understands more of the world around him. He champions against systemic injustice, and though he doubts himself often (and waffles when choosing a side), it is because he truly wants what is best for his world. He just doesn’t know what that is.\n\nThis book speaks heavily to societal indoctrination and division. How people at all class levels begin to believe the same rhetoric, whether it is damaging or beneficial to themselves.\n\nI feel like there were a lot of loose ends and individual storylines that weren’t resolved. I’m kind of glad for it, as it allows the readers to shape the world for themselves. I also appreciate the lack of villain redemption arcs. That would have been unbelievable in context, and I’m glad the reader chose to show the villain still pursuing his own agenda.\n\nOverall, this was unique, thought-provoking, and fun. I really enjoyed the read!\n\nThanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the advance copy to read.\n\nJune 10, 2024\n\nThank you NetGalley and Harper Voyager for the arc!\n\nI was super excited about this story. The premise sounded unbelievable and I was so excited for such a unique world. The world is one of the coolest things about this book. There are kingdoms all based on the spice they grow and import with magic gates connecting them. The world operates on a caste system with Amir, a carrier of spices, on the bottom.\n\nI struggled with understanding the why and becoming fully immersed in the story. There was so much world building in this story which did help set up this world nicely. however I feel like there where areas that needed more detail such as the God of the gates and the ‘why’ of the story. Also the dialogue was a bit of a struggle. I wish there was a bit more continuity with the speech of characters as well as the general type of speech (modern vs. fantasy).\n\nThere was so much potential in this story and world. Generally I think there needed to a bit more reworking or edits to make this story really flow and shine! I would love to see more by this author as I think there is so much potential for a really amazing story.\n\nJuly 15, 2024\n\nHello, I'm Prashanth Srivatsa, and the author of The Spice Gate.\n\nThe Spice Gate is out in the world this week, and I just wanted to thank everyone who has been such an instrumental part of this journey.\n\nThe Spice Gate is my debut, and it is a book that is close to me. It features a reluctant protagonist with a lot of heart, a host of companions with myriad eccentricities, a ton of delicious food, endless adventure, and a passable representation of Indian culture. Indian culture cannot be homogenized, nor can it be fully represented in any single novel. I have only written what I know or have studied.\n\nGoodreads is ultimately a reader platform, so I do not expect to linger here for much longer (except to occasionally review my own readings). But I hope all of you find something to take away from The Spice Gate, even if it's only to remember to add ginger to your tea.\n\nMuch love,\n\nPrashanth\n\nMay 5, 2024\n\nI very much enjoyed this debut novel by Prashanth Srivatsa! The world-building is rich and well written. The author clearly spent a lot of time in this world and thinking of how everything connected. I also loved Amir as the main character - he was easy to root for and had a good narrative voice. He was an underdog the entire story and his spirit and drive were endearing.\n\nAlso Karim bhai - what a great side character! As the book went on, I loved every moment he was on page.\n\nI did have a hard time in the first few chapters. The world building is not well paced at first - everything is introduced very quickly without any time to breathe. This improved a lot and by the middle, the pacing was perfect. Otherwise, the only other piece I would've liked more of was Amir and Harini's relationship.\n\nThank you to Harper Voyager and Goodreads for the Advanced Readers Copy of this book.\n\n3.5/5\n\nMay 17, 2024\n\nThank you to NetGalley and Harper Voyager for this eARC. All opinions are my own.\n\nThe Spice Gate has an excellent premise with our main character born at the very bottom of the caste system, yet responsible for carrying spices, the be all end all for this universe, through the spice gates to the different kingdoms.\n\nI love a book with an unlikely underdog fighting the system. The world was very unique with a religion that governed everything and everyone.\n\nThe pacing starts slow with a lot of world building but picks up about 1/3 into the story. Where this book didn’t work for me was in the characters. None of them made me care. Even our main character Amir was just kinda meh. I think I get what the author was trying to convey but it just fell a little flat for me.\n\nOverall the story was too much tell and not enough show for me to really connect."
