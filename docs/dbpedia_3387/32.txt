Esther Spencer: Billy Two Hats? How did you get a name like that?

Billy Two Hats: Well, my mother was a Kiowa and I don't know who my father was except he was white. My mother didn't know too much about him neither, except she told me he was kind of important. She said that in his room he had two hats - one for special and one for ordinary. That impressed my mother a whole lot. And when I was a kid it impressed me.
