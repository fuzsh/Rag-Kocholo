        "text": "NOTE: The below Blu-ray captures were taken directly from the Blu-ray disc.ADDITION: Kino Blu-ray (January 2024): Kino have transferred Ted Kotcheff's Split Image to Blu-ray. It is cited as being from a \"Brand New HD Master  From a 2K Scan of the 35mm Interpositive\". This is the first time this film has been available in a widescreen release. I wouldn't say the 1080P is overly remarkable but it suffices in exporting a clean, reasonably detailed, image. There are a few impressive close-ups. Overall, a fine HD, if les-dynamic, presentation.\n\nNOTE: We have added 70 more large resolution Blu-ray captures (in lossless PNG format) for DVDBeaver Patrons HERE\n\nOn their Blu-ray, Kino use a DTS-HD Master 2.0 channel track (24-bit) in the original English language. Split Image has only a few aggressive moments - a few chase and kidnapping scenes - that come through with depth. The score was by Bill Conti (The Big Fix, Betrayed, The Seduction of Joe Tynan, Neighbors, The Right Stuff, Rocky, Harry and Tonto, For Your Eyes Only) and adds to the film in subtle ways. Included are traditional spirituals He's Got The Whole World In His Hand, Rise and Shine give God your Glory, Glory! and Rock My Soul In The Bosom Of Abraham with dialogue sounding clean and consistent in the lossless transfer. Kino offer optional English subtitles on their Region 'A' Blu-ray.\n\nThe Kino Blu-ray\n\noffers a new commentary by film historian / filmmaker Daniel Kremer. He discusses his own film with a cults as a storyline, 2015's Raise Your Kids on Seltzer, and two other 'cult' related films; Ralph L. Thomas' 1981 Ticket to Heaven and John A. Alonzo's, 1980 Blinded by the Light with Kristy and Jimmy McNichol. He also mentions the excellent Martha Marcy May Marlene directed by Sean Durkin and starring Elizabeth Olsen. Daniel talks mostly about director Ted Kotcheff and his penchant for a theme of social climbing in his films, his appreciation for Canadian art and cinema and Canadian filmmakers (Norman Jewison, Arthur Hiller etc.) in general plus an 'auteur argument' for Kotcheff among many other details. Daniel is excellent filling the, almost, 2-hours. Super commentary - as was his extensive work on another Canadian-born filmmaker in the 'Directed by Sidney J Furie' boxset from Imprint. There is also a remastered theatrical trailer that has noticeable damage and trailers for other films.\n\nCults are fascinating from a sociological standpoint, using religious behavior, mind control and brainwashing to ensnare susceptible individuals. Ted Kotcheff's Split Image is very intriguing. James Woods, as the deprogrammer, was always memorable as another of the actor's tough but slimy characters, Karen Allen seductively glows, Peter Fonda embodies the transparently charismatic and controlling 'leader', Elizabeth Ashley and Brian Dennehy are effective as the privileged, upwardly mobile, parents and Michael O'Keefe as the fun-loving jock son who falls prey to the youth-oriented religious commune and especially Karen Allen's Rebecca (formerly Amy.) It's a film I had seen back in the 80s and there were plenty of scenes I remembered. I was very pleased to see the Kino Blu-ray\n\nand I suspect I will watch it again. It made me also want to re-watch Martha Marcy May Marlene. For those keen on the topic or are fans of the cast, Split Image is recommended!"
