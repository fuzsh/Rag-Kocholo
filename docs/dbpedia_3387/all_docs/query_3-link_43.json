        "text": "Ted Kotcheff directed this curious western in Israel two years after making the excellent Wake In Fright (1971) in Australia. It’s about the friendship of old Scottish outlaw Arch Deans (Gregory Peck) and young hot-blooded half-breed Billy Two Hats (Desi Arnaz Jr) as they are chased across the frontier by dogged Sheriff Gifford (Jack Warden).\n\nFor much of the film, Deans is unable to walk so Billy drags him around the desert while the older man reclines in a cot. This creates lots of opportunities for the Scottish rascal to regale his companion with monologues, and Peck’s voice is such a gorgeous instrument that some of the chatty bits are entertaining.\n\nHe also cuts a great figure with his thick black beard and sloppily bundled clothing, even when confined to the cot.\n\nPeck and Arnaz Jr are, in many ways, very good. It’s just that their very casting is unusual, to say the least.\n\nAlan Sharp’s script wanders a little too much, ultimately saying nothing. That criticism would not be so severe were it not for the fact that in saying nothing, Sharp is not very entertaining either.\n\nOne of the three producers was Norman Jewison.\n\nArch Deans\n\nGregory Peck\n\nBilly Two Hats\n\nDesi Arnaz Jr\n\nSheriff Henry Gifford\n\nJack Warden\n\nCopeland, Saloon Owner\n\nDavid Huddleston\n\nCopeland’s Squaw\n\nDawn Little Sky\n\nEsther Spencer\n\nSian Barbara Allen\n\nSpencer\n\nJohn Pearce\n\nIndian Leader\n\nVince St. Cyr\n\nIndians\n\nHenry Medicine Hat\n\nZeev Berlinsky\n\nAntony Scott\n\nDirector\n\nTed Kotcheff\n\nVideo"
