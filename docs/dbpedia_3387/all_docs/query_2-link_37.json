        "text": "“\n\nThe night our parents were murdered... Kimiko just stopped talking. Can't talk. She's never made a sound since. In the camp, we were alone week after week, just the two of us, for years. We... came up with a language so we could get through it. I-It saved us. Both of us.\n\n―Kenji Miyashiro to Frenchie, explaining the sign language he uses to communicate with his sister.[src]\n\n”\n\nKenji Miyashiro, also known as Mouse, is a supporting character of the Amazon series The Boys. He was Kimiko Miyashiro's younger brother.\n\nThe Boys Series[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nAt a young age, Kenji, along with his older sister, Kimiko, were abducted by the Shining Light Liberation Army. Their parents were killed and they were forced to join the army. After that, Kimiko stopped talking altogether and she formed a secret sign language with her younger brother to communicate. They looked out for each other and protected each other.\n\nAfter Kimiko was taken to the U.S. and successfully turned into a Supe from Compound V, the terrorists took Kenji and injected him with Compound V to do the same. He gained the ability to move things and people with his hands. He started to agree with the ideologies of the Shining Light Liberation Army after witnessing atrocities committed by American superheroes and became an active terrorist, now labeled “The Supe-Terrorist”.\n\nSeason Two[]\n\nHe went on a boat to the U.S. and Kimiko recognized him in video footage, where he is seen flipping over a boat onto the harbor. Kimiko tracks him down and they reconnect, thrilled to see that the other is safe. Once Kimiko realizes that he doesn’t want to abandon The Shining Light she helps The Boys capture him.\n\nHe gets handcuffed and The Boys try to take him to Grace Mallory and the FBI. Both Kimiko and Frenchie try to reassure Kenji that they are not enemies, however Kenji dismisses it and uses one of his exposed fingers to manipulate an energy drink left by Frenchie in order to free himself. While en-route, the group gets disrupted by a helicopter reporting the boat as stolen and they are all under arrest. Kenji attempts use the distraction to attack Butcher, but gets disrupted by Kimiko and knocks the helicopter into the water. Eventually, the Boys are intercepted by The Deep, forcing the group to escort Kenji through a storm drain. The Seven arrive and pursue The Boys, with Homelander cornering Hughie. The Boys free Kenji so he can save Hughie from Homelander, as Kenji brings the roof down on Homelander.\n\nKenji then tries to escape once again but he gets stopped by Kimiko. The two then are chased onto the rooftops of apartment buildings by Stormfront, who willfully murders any civilians unlucky to be anywhere near her. Kenji attempts to run away, but he goes back to help Kimiko when Stormfront catches her and attempts to break her neck. Stormfront then breaks Kenji's wrists, disabling his powers, and then kills him by brutally breaking his neck as Kimiko watches. Kenji's death is publicized afterwards, with him being branded as a \"The Super-Terrorist\" and the murders committed by Stormfront blamed on him.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nKenji has a big heart when it comes to his older sister. He also believes that the terrorist organization he's a member of is doing the right thing - that they are fighting for justice against the 'Americans' that attacked and destroyed his home. Later on, despite his numerous attempts to escape, Kenji still loves his elder sister more than anything when he returns to save her life from Stormfront, instead of escaping.\n\nPowers and Abilities[]\n\nPowers[]\n\nTelekinesis: Kenji was capable of moving objects with his mind. He was powerful enough to psychokinetically influence materials as heavy as a small ship freighter, and was even able to subdue Homelander beneath large amounts of concrete rubble. However, because his power was often channeled through his hands, he could easily be subdued by binding and covering his wrists, palms, and fingers. After his wrists were broken by Stormfront, Kenji's telekinetic abilities were neutralized.\n\nSuperhuman Strength: Kenji possesses superhuman durability, making him more durable than humans. He was able to jump great heights from building to building using his super agility and physical strength of his legs. Kimiko struggled to restrain his arms in the boat and later he was also able to push Stormfront away, a supe with extreme strength and durability.\n\nSuperhuman Durability: Kenji possesses superhuman durability, making him more durable than humans. He withstands being hurled into concrete walls by Stormfront's plasma, managing to survive without any injuries.\n\nSuperhuman Speed: Kenji possesses superhuman speed, enabling him to run faster than humans and some Supes. He outruns Kimiko Miyashiro, a Supe with superhuman speed.\n\nSuperhuman Agility: Kenji possesses superhuman agility, causing him to be more agile than humans and some Supes. He nimbly jumps from far-distancing rooftops to evade Stormfront.\n\nSuperhuman Hearing: Kenji possesses superhuman hearing, allowing him to hear better than humans. Like all Supes, he can hear higher frequencies that humans cannot.[1]\n\nAbilities[]\n\nMultilingualism: Kenji could fluently speak English, Japanese and Sign Language.\n\nWeaknesses[]\n\nBiological[]\n\nBrute Force/Limited Durability: Despite being more durable than humans, Kenji can still be stunned, knocked unconscious, and killed by extreme force. Kimiko forcefully puts him in a chokehold, causing him to go unconscious. Later, Kenji is overpowered by Stormfront, who breaks both of his wrists before snapping his neck.\n\nHand Usage Required: By restraining his hands, Kenji's telekinetic abilities can be rendered incapacitated. The Boys take advantage of this weakness by duct-taping his hands and chaining them together. Moreover, Stormfront breaks Kenji's wrists, leaving him completely incapable of using his powers.\n\nHigh Frequencies: Due to being a Supe, Kenji is susceptible to high frequencies. When a high frequency is playing, it can induce immense pain and temporarily neutralize him.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nKenji was credited as \"Skinny Man\" in \"The Big Ride\".\n\nThe character does not exist in the comics, and the Female is by all accounts an only child."
