        "text": "Later this year, Australians will vote in a referendum about whether to enshrine an Indigenous Voice to Parliament in the constitution.\n\nThe Voice is a proposed independent and permanent advisory body that would advise policymakers on matters affecting the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.\n\nThe scope of issues on which the Voice would provide advice has been a source of conflict in recent debates.\n\nIn the lead-up to the vote, here are all your questions answered.\n\nWhat is the proposed Voice to Parliament?\n\nThe would be a body advising the government on issues particularly impacting First Nations Australians. It would not have the power to veto laws.\n\nThe Voice would make representations to both the Australian parliament and executive government on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The parliament makes laws, while the executive government develops laws and policies and administers them.\n\nMany details on how the body would function will be worked through after the referendum, but:\n\nMembers would have fixed-term dates to \"ensure accountability\"\n\nIt would be gender balanced and include youth members\n\nIt would draw on representatives from all states and territories\n\nIt would include representatives from specific remote communities\n\nWe still don't know whether members would be democratically elected or appointed.\n\nThe form the Voice could eventually take remains in the hands of parliament and would be determined after a successful Yes vote.\n\nAccording to the Yes side’s proposed constitutional amendment, the parliament would retain power over the \"composition, functions, powers and procedures\" of the Voice.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nIt's official: You will have a say on the Voice to Parliament. Here's what to know\n\nHowever, according to the Voice’s , members of the Voice \"will be chosen by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people based on the wishes of local communities”.\n\nThe Voice would also be allocated enough funding to allow it “to research, develop and make representations” to both the parliament and government, the Voice website says.\n\nThe scope of issues on which the Voice would provide advice has been a regular source of conflict in recent debates.\n\nMembers of the No camp have frequently suggested that its remit would essentially be boundless and would include defence and monetary policy.\n\nYes campaigners have stressed that the Voice , such as poverty, incarceration, child removal, and poor health and educational outcomes.\n\nOthers in the 'progressive no' camp have suggested that , and instead have called for seats in parliament and a treaty.\n\nThe Voice wouldn’t be the first Indigenous advisory body set up by an Australian government.\n\nThe Hawke government established the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) in 1990, but it was abolished in 2005.\n\nAt that time, the Howard government was able to do this because ATSIC wasn’t enshrined in the constitution.\n\nWhat is a referendum?\n\nA referendum is a question put to eligible Australian voters that has the power to change the constitution, the body of rules that sets out how the country is governed.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nWe're headed for a referendum this year. How do they work?\n\nHolding a referendum is the only way for the government to amend the constitution.\n\nWhat is the Voice referendum?\n\nThe Albanese Labor government has committed to enshrining an Indigenous Voice to Parliament in the Australian Constitution. To do this, it must hold a national referendum.\n\nAustralians will be asked to vote Yes or No to changing the Constitution, formally recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Peoples of Australia and setting up a Voice to Parliament.\n\nIf a Yes vote is successful, an Indigenous Voice along the lines of that described above will be established permanently, or at least until another referendum is held.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThe Voice Referendum question has been announced. This is what it means\n\nThe decision to enshrine the Voice in the constitution is based on recommendations from the Uluru Statement from the Heart, which came out of a long consultative process with Indigenous groups.\n\nHowever, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s decision to pursue a constitutional amendment is contested by his political opponents.\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton has previously suggested that his side would support a Voice legislated by parliament. However, the Liberal Party’s Coalition partners, the Nationals, have said they don’t support a Voice legislated by parliament.\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton has previously suggested that his side would support a Voice legislated by parliament.

If an eligible person fails to provide a valid and sufficient reason why they didn’t vote, they may be fined.\n\nAustralia's referendum history. Source: SBS News\n\n, each needing both an overall majority and a majority in most states.\n\nThe Voice will be the nation’s first referendum in almost a quarter of a century and, if successful, it will be the first time Australians have voted to alter their constitution since 1977.\n\nWhat is the Indigenous Voice to Parliament referendum question?\n\nThe question Australians will be asked to vote on in the Voice referendum was announced by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on 23 March.\n\nA Proposed Law: to alter the Constitution to recognise the First Peoples of Australia by establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice. Do you approve this proposed alteration?\n\nWhen is the Voice to Parliament referendum?\n\nThe Voice to Parliament referendum will occur on 14 October 2023.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the date of the referendum on 30 August 2023 in Western Australia. Source: AAP\n\nWhat is the 1967 referendum?\n\nIn 1967, Australia voted to remove two provisions in the Australian constitution that discriminated against Aboriginal people.\n\nThe first of these provisions related to what is known as the ‘race power’:\n\nThe Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:- …(xxvi) The people of any race, other than the aboriginal people in any State, for whom it is necessary to make special laws.\n\nThe proposed amendment was to remove the words “other than the aboriginal people in any State” from this section.\n\nThis gave the federal government, rather than state governments, the power to make laws for Indigenous Australians.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThe key to Australia's most successful referendum\n\nBefore the 1967 referendum, there were state-by-state differences in the laws that applied to Indigenous people.\n\nFor example, in NSW, Victoria and SA, Indigenous people were able to marry freely and vote freely (from 1962), but those living in WA and Queensland could not.\n\nAt the time, advocates for a Yes vote sought to put pressure on the federal government to use its new power to provide positive policies for Indigenous people.\n\nThe second provision altered by the 1967 referendum related to counting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in official population numbers.\n\nIt sought to remove the following section from the Australian constitution:\n\nIn reckoning the numbers of the people of the Commonwealth, or of a State or other part of the Commonwealth, aboriginal natives should not be counted.\n\nThe referendum was overwhelmingly won by the Yes side, with over 90 per cent of Australians in support.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThe legacy of the pioneers of the 1967 Referendum, 56 years on\n\nAs well as the legal changes it brought about, the referendum quickly took on an important symbolic value and it was followed by campaigns such as the 1972 Aboriginal Tent Embassy and the land rights movement.\n\nReferencing the changes to Section 127, the final paragraph of the Uluru Statement from the Heart reads: “In 1967 we were counted, in 2017 we seek to be heard.”\n\nIt gave Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people the vote\n\nIt officially granted Indigenous people citizen rights\n\nIt gave equal rights in Australia\n\nNone of these ideas about the 1967 referendum are strictly true.\n\nWhat is the Uluru Statement from the Heart?\n\nThe is the culmination of a series of dialogues held with First Nations representatives, which arrived at a consensus about what constitutional recognition should look like.\n\nIt is that calls for the establishment of an Indigenous Voice to Parliament enshrined in the constitution and a Makarrata commission for the purpose of treaty-making and truth-telling.

Truth and Treaty are the subsequent steps for national reconciliation outlined in the Uluru Statement from the Heart.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nYes or No? Here are the key arguments for and against the Voice\n\nThe Yes camp says that entrenching the Voice in the constitution means that future governments won't be able to remove it, which they see as a positive.\n\nOn the other hand, the No camp sees the idea of constitutional change as a negative.\n\n“Putting a Voice in the Constitution means it’s permanent. We will be stuck with negative consequences,” the official No pamphlet reads.\n\nThe No pamphlet also says a Yes vote would be risky because \"no issue is beyond its reach\", including “the economy, national security, infrastructure, health, education and more”.\n\nThe No camp also argues that a constitutionally enshrined body “for only one group of Australians means permanently dividing Australians\".\n\n“This goes against a key principle of our democratic system, that all Australians are equal before the law,” the No pamphlet reads.\n\nThe No pamphlet also says that Australians are being “asked to sign a blank cheque” as details about the Voice “would only be worked through after Australians have voted\".\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThe Yes and No campaigns are ramping up with TV ads.

As opposed to the 'conservative No' camp, which argues that a constitutionally enshrined Voice goes too far, the 'progressive No' say it doesn’t go far enough.\n\nThey take issue with the fact that the Voice will only have advisory powers, with the parliament and legislature maintaining ultimate decision-making authority.\n\nThey say that recognition of sovereignty and truth-telling is the key to real change.\n\nSenator Lidia Thorpe, for example, has attacked the Voice to Parliament as\n\nIn a self-released Voice pamphlet, Thorpe say the Voice is “not a step in the right direction, but \"another powerless advisory body\" and that it’s a \"destructive distraction\" and would \"absolve the government of its continued crimes\".\n\nIndependent Senator Lidia Thorpe and Warlpiri elder Ned Hargraves speak during a press conference at Parliament House.

Section 51(xxvi) allows parliament to make special laws for people of \"any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws\".\n\nAnother prominent piece of misinformation that has emerged is that the Voice will lead to policies that favour Indigenous people, such as land tax, property rights, and non-Indigenous people losing their properties or having to pay rent.\n\nAccording to RMIT CrossCheck, the Voice is not designed to enable any such policies: the constitutional change would not convert private land to native title, and the Voice would have no formal power to force policy changes or control Australia’s land and resources.\n\nThere have even been claims the United Nations will control all land in Australia if the referendum is successful.\n\nRMIT CrossCheck investigated suggestions of the UN using the voice to upend sovereignty and found the claims were incorrect.\n\nAustralia is a voluntary member state of the intergovernmental organisation, and the UN is not authorised to intervene in matters that fall under the domestic jurisdictions of its members.\n\nWhat will happen if the Voice referendum fails?\n\nIf a No vote is successful, an Indigenous Voice will not be enshrined, and the constitution will remain unchanged.\n\nIt’s unlikely another referendum will be held on the question in the short-term. Albanese framed the referendum as a in April.\n\n“If this isn't successful, it's not like a month later there'll be another referendum around,\" he said.\n\nIn August, Albanese suggested an alternative form of recognition would not be implemented if the Voice referendum is not successful.\n\nThe Voice is one of three aspects of the Uluru Statement from the Heart – alongside Truth and Treaty – that Albanese’s government committed to after winning the 2022 federal election.\n\nA No vote in the Voice referendum wouldn’t automatically impede the government from following through on its commitment to processes like establishing a treaty.\n\nBut some advocates for the Voice have suggested that its establishment is .\n\n“I just don't know how we will be able to do that when we are still voiceless in the community,” Sally Scales, a member of the Voice referendum group, told SBS News in May.\n\n“How would we be able to do a Treaty process if we don't have a voice to have that negotiation with government?\"\n\nAre there versions of a Voice to Parliament elsewhere in the world?\n\nNorway, Finland and Sweden designed to ensure Indigenous perspectives are presented to their governments for consideration on issues affecting these communities.\n\nThe Sámi people are indigenous to an area that covers parts of the three countries.

As such, voters face the increasingly urgent challenge of separating fact from fiction.\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) – the independent federal agency in charge of organising, conducting and supervising the referendum – has launched a specific to the referendum, to track and counter misleading claims.\n\nOne common disinformation claim about the referendum is that the AEC is compromised by corruption, mismanagement and bias, and the referendum will be 'rigged' as a result.\n\nThe AEC has directly responded to these claims online, reminding people it is “the neutral body administering elections to world leading integrity standards”, and doesn’t “advocate how people should vote, just that they do vote”.\n\nThe AEC explains on its website that the Voice referendum will be run using the same infrastructure as federal elections, which includes more than 100,000 temporary staff counting the votes under the supervision of both AEC staff and independent scrutineers. Independent experts have also told SBS News that the AEC has a respectable track record.\n\nAnother claim about the referendum is that, by accepting a tick on the ballot paper as a formal Yes vote, but not accepting a cross as a formal No vote, the AEC is favouring a Yes vote.\n\nIt’s worth pointing out this isn’t a new rule – the AEC says it has followed legal advice about ticks and crosses on referendum ballot papers for more than 30 years.\n\nParliament is ultimately responsible for setting how ticks and crosses are interpreted, and the AEC has \"made no decision\" on the matter, AEC commissioner Tom Rogers has told SBS News.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nAEC battles threats to staff, 'bonkers' Voice vote conspiracies on social media\n\nA federal court ruling on 20 September 2023 affirmed this decision, saying it has been legal precedent across six referendums.\n\nFederal court judge Steven Rares said that a cross could indicate agreement, disapproval or an unwillingness to answer the question at all, while a tick was not similarly ambiguous, either indicating approval or an affirmative response.\n\nFurthermore, the overwhelming majority of voters follow the instructions to write Yes or No on the ballot paper. In Australia’s last referendum, the rate of informal votes (which aren’t counted) was 0.86 per cent. The AEC says even among those, “many would have no relevance to the use of ticks or crosses”.\n\nThe AEC has repeatedly urged Australians to write either \"Yes\" or \"No\" in English, in full, on their ballot papers to ensure their vote would count.\n\nWhen will we know the results of the referendum?\n\nThe counting process for the referendum will be similar to that employed for votes for the House of Representatives in a federal election, with the key difference being people are only answering Yes or No on one ballot paper in the referendum.\n\nThe streamlined counting process (federal election vote counting needs to take preferences into account) means it’s likely we’ll know the result on the night.\n\nHowever, the AEC uses the slogan ‘right, not rushed’ on its website and says if the overall result is close, it may require up to 13 days after polling night for the result to be known. This is the time frame the AEC allows for postal votes to come in.\n\nAs for the mechanics of the vote count, the AEC says every vote cast on the day of the referendum will be counted that night.\n\nMost of the votes counted at early voting centres and a small number of postal votes will be counted as well.\n\nResults will be uploaded to the AEC's Virtual Tally Room as they're counted, both on the day of the referendum and the days following.\n\nThe AEC says it will only declare the referendum result when it’s “mathematically impossible for any other result to occur\".\n\nWhat happened at the last referendum?\n\nThe last time a referendum was held . It had two questions, and both failed to get anywhere near enough Yes votes to pass.\n\nAustralians were asked to vote Yes or No on altering the Constitution to establish a republic - replacing the Queen and governor-general with a president - as well as altering the Constitution to add a preamble..\n\nThe push for Australia becoming a republic was led by Malcolm Turnbull, with former prime ministers Gough Wihtlam, Bob Hawke and Malcolm Fraser also arguing Australia's head of state should be an Australian. The official No campaign argued that the system proposed would create a \"politician's republic\" and was undemocratic.\n\nThere was no majority for Yes in any state. Overall, 54.9 per cent voted No to the republic, and 60.7 per cent to the preamble.\n\nAfter successive Labor and Liberal prime ministers have said they wouldn't revive the republic debate, there was speculation Anthony Albanese would push for an Australian head of state once he became prime minister.\n\nThe Republic Movement has said it has paused much of its campaigning until after the Voice referendum.\n\nI've received a text message about postal voting. What should I do?\n\nSome Australians have recently reported receiving a text message urging them to vote No, and also to apply to make a postal vote.\n\nThe text message includes a link to a website authorised by the Liberal Party. The website lists some of the reasons a person may seek to vote via post and has an 'apply' button beneath them.\n\nUpon clicking on it, people are asked to provide details including their name, address, email address and phone number.\n\nWhen being asked for the last of these details, people are informed by submitting one's details \"you will be providing this information to the Liberal Party of Australia and the Nationals, who will contact you regarding the referendum\". Upon giving that information, the page redirects to the AEC's postal vote application.\n\nThe Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has confirmed to SBS News that messages from registered political parties do not have to comply with the Spam Act.\n\nACMA advised complaints relating to such messages should be directed to the authoriser.\n\nPolitical parties sending physical postal vote applications to people who request them or providing a link to the AEC's online application form is not illegal.\n\nHowever, Electoral Commissioner Tom Rogers last year described the practice as \"potentially misleading\" and the \"number one complaint\" received in regard to the federal election.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nText messages? Referendum postal votes from a political party? Is any of this allowed?\n\nThe AEC refers to it as sending \"third-party postal vote applications\".\n\nThe Liberals are not the only party who have used websites to get voters to register for postal votes through them. For last year's federal election, Labor set up the website howtovote.org.au for that purpose. The website is no longer active.\n\n\"This is an application with no ballot papers involved,\" Australian Electoral Commission spokesperson Evan Ekin-Smyth said.\n\n\"If a political party receives a postal vote application, they're obligated to send it swiftly back to the AEC.

The constitution recognises the the states as independent, sovereign entities, with guaranteed powers of self-government.\n\nThe territories, on the other hand, are ultimately controlled by the Commonwealth, which can pass laws for them and even override laws passed in territory parliaments.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nState and territory ballots will be counted differently at the Voice referendum – is that fair?\n\nIn fact, between 1911 and 1977 people living in territories couldn't even vote in referendums.\n\nBetween 1901 - the year of federation - and 1911, the Northern Territory and ACT were part of South Australia and NSW, respectively. As such, their residents had the same voting rights as those of any state.\n\nHowever, when the Northern Territory and ACT became federal territories in 1911, their residents lost those rights.\n\nIt wasn't until a successful referendum in 1977 that they won them back, via an amendment that required referendum questions to be put to electors \"in each State and Territory\".\n\nHowever, that amendment didn't alter the requirement for a majority of states to vote Yes for a successful referendum.\n\nHow to spot misinformation and what to do about it?\n\nExperts are warning of an \"incredibly large volume\" of mis- and disinformation that is circulating in the referendum campaign.\n\nMathew Marques, a senior lecturer of social psychology at Melbourne's La Trobe University, said there are two key questions to ask yourself - what is the source, and how is the content being communicated to you?\n\nREAD MORE\n\nVoice to Parliament: How to spot misinformation - and what to do about it\n\n\"If you’re able, I would start off by checking the source of the information. For you, is it a trustworthy source? Is it likely to be an impartial source?\"\n\nThen, check whether the content has any \"hallmarks of persuasive language\" that might \"draw you in\".\n\nWhen you see misinformation on a particular platform, it is worth flagging and reporting it with the platform.\n\nThis article was originally published on 29 August.
