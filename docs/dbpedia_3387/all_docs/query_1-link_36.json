        "text": "In late 1920s Chicago, Illinois, jazz star VELMA KELLY sings and performs as a dramatic scene unfolds: ROXIE HART, a married woman, has come home with her boyfriend, FRED CASELY. Fred tries to end the affair, but Roxie becomes enraged, shooting him in cold blood (\"All That Jazz\").\n\nThree hours later, Officer FOGARTY and the police arrive, and Roxie convinces her husband AMOS to lie and say that he killed the \"burglar\" - when really, he arrived home and heard the story from Roxie. She sings her husband's praises - until a policeman reveals the man's identity and Amos recognizes Fred Casely, the man who sold them their furniture, and certainly no burglar (\"Funny Honey\"). Amos realizes his wife lied to cover up her affair, and he turns against her. In a fit of rage, Roxie confesses to the affair and the murder. She is taken away by the police.\n\nAt the Cook County Jail, six \"merry murderesses,\" including Velma, LIZ, ANNIE, JUNE, MONA, and HUNYAK - who insists she is not guilty - tell their bloody tales (\"The Cell Block Tango\"). Then, the Keeper of the Keys MATRON \"MAMA\" MORTON introduces herself, reminding the women that she's willing to do them favors if they do favors for her (\"When You're Good to Mama\"). As Mama introduces Roxie to her fellow prisoners, she asks about Roxie's defense for the trial. Roxie doesn't have one, so Mama suggests the best criminal lawyer in Chicago, BILLY FLYNN. After a bit of sweet-talking, Roxie convinces Amos to foot the lawyer's very expensive bill.\n\nFor his part, Billy insists that his motives are pure (\"All I Care About\"), yet when Amos meets with him it becomes clear that Billy intends to get every bit of money and publicity possible out of the case. Billy rewrites the story of Roxie's life, casting her as an innocent girl swept up by life in the big city. There is one pivotal point of the story that Billy drives home to reporters: Fred reached for the gun, and Roxie, in self-defense, did too (\"We Both Reached for the Gun\").\n\nThe REPORTERS love the story, including famed columnist MARY SUNSHINE, and Roxie is thrilled with her newfound fame (\"Roxie\"). Velma, realizing she is yesterday's news, desperately pitches an idea to Roxie: why don't the two of them do a double act when they get out? (\"I Can't Do It Alone\"). Roxie rejects the idea. When Billy drops Roxie for a hot new case - pineapple heiress KITTY, who killed her boyfriend HARRY and his girlfriend after finding them together - Roxie realizes that fame fades quickly. She and Velma lament their lost spotlight (\"My Own Best Friend\"). However, Roxie has a plan: she faints. When she \"comes t,\" she informs Billy and the reporters that she is going to have a baby.\n\nReporters swarm Roxie as she thoroughly enjoys the frenzy her announcement has caused (\"Me and My Baby\"). Amos excitedly proclaims himself the father, but no one seems to notice. He sadly muses that no one ever seems to notice him (\"Mister Cellophane\").\n\nBilly visits the jail to meet with Roxie, but runs into Velma, who is also his client. She tells Billy that she has been practicing what she will do for her trial, and she shows him her routine (\"When Velma Takes the Stand\"). Meanwhile, Roxie has been practicing her own trial routine, and she confesses to Billy that she is nervous. Billy advises her to \"razzle dazzle\" the courtroom (\"Razzle Dazzle\"). Roxie does just that, and the jury finds her not guilty.\n\nThe trial's conclusion leaves Roxie disappointed as the crowd rushes off to the next big scandal; she was hoping this would be her big break. However, she's quickly thrust back in the spotlight when she teams up with Velma, performing a new act that takes Chicago by storm (\"Nowadays\"). The two \"scintillating sinners\" become stars (\"Finale\")."
