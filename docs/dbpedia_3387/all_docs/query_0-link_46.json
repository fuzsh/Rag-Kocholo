        "text": "From Henry Hathaway, the acclaimed director of The Shepherd of the Hills, Rawhide, The Sons of Katie Elder, Nevada Smith and True Grit, comes this western odyssey about an aging gunfighter (Gregory Peck, The Big Country, Billy Two Hats) whoâ€™s released from jail and looking for revenge. Clay Lomax (Peck) did seven years in Canyon City Jail after his partner, Sam Foley (James Gregory, Clambake), shot him in the back during a bank robbery. The ex-con is suddenly saddled with Decky Ortega (Dawn Lyn, Walking Tall), a six-year-old orphan whose mother was his old girlfriend. With no one else to care for the feisty little girl, Clay is forced to take her on the trail of ruthless vengeance that leads to the climactic shoot-out. The stellar cast includes Patricia Quinn (Zachariah), Robert F. Lyons (Platoon Leader), Susan Tyrrell (Flesh+Blood), Jeff Corey (Jennifer), Rita Gam (Night People), Paul Fix (Man in the Shadow) and Arthur Hunnicutt (Broken Arrow).\n\nPress & Exhibitors\n\nBelow please find additional information and promotional materials for this film.
