        "text": "Gaby Cara speaks to her nonna in fluent Italian, but only because she spent a year in a Tuscany when she was nine.\n\n\"We were in this tiny little village, and because I was so young, I just picked up Italian really quickly,\" Gaby says.\n\nFor her dad Bruno, a second-generation Italian-Australian, this was a dream come true.\n\n\"I always wanted the kids to experience the culture, and to learn the language at a level where they could communicate freely,\" he says.\n\nGaby and her sister Alexia, who was five at the time, attended the local school in picturesque Panzano.\n\nAlexia soaked up the new language \"like a sponge\".\n\n\"She had a real Tuscan inflection. It was actually beautiful,\" Bruno says.\n\n\"Roots migration\", or going to the homeland for an immersive cultural and linguistic experience, is how the Cara family managed to buck a rather alarming trend.\n\nLosing your language\n\nItalians are losing their language at a faster rate than any other ethnic group in Australia.\n\nIn the last 15 years or so there's been a drop of around 80,000 people speaking Italian at home.\n\nAccording to Census data, there were almost 354,000 people who spoke Italian at home in 2001. By 2016, that had fallen to around 272,000.\n\nThe Greeks share a similar migration trajectory to the Italians, but \"there are some factors that have helped the Greeks maintain their language more,\" says Antonia Rubino, senior lecturer in Italian Studies at the University of Sydney.\n\n\"One is the lack of this distinction between dialect and standard Italian.\"\n\nMany post-war Italian migrants spoke dialect as their first language, and often did not pass on Italian to the second generation, Dr Rubino explains.\n\n\"The Greeks also had the church,\" she says.\n\nThe Greek Orthodox church is central to the family and has played a major role in the transmission of culture and language, whereas \"Italians very often attended the local Catholic church which was mainly in English,\" she says.\n\nBut the Greeks are not far behind the Italians when it comes to language loss.\n\nThat's because it takes only three generations for many migrant families to lose the languages they come with.\n\n\"Australia is in many ways a graveyard of languages,\" says Ingrid Piller, professor of applied linguistics at Macquarie University.\n\nThis term was coined by American linguist Joshua Fishman to apply to the US, but Australia also fits the bill.\n\nLike the US, we're an English dominant country where language diversity is not valued, according to Dr Piller.\n\nThe 'monolingual mindset'?\n\nThis attitude is reflected in our education system.\n\n\"Australia is one of the most multilingual countries in the world,\" says Ken Cruickshank of the University of Sydney.\n\nYet, language education is not seen as a high priority and \"languages are not part of the core curriculum in any state apart from Victoria in the primary schools,\" he says.\n\nIn fact, he says, \"we come lowest of all OECD countries in the provision and uptake of languages\".\n\nThe result is that a bilingual child has a five in six chance of losing their heritage language by the time they finish high school, according to Dr Cruickshank.\n\nOr put simply, multilingual kids go to school to become monolingual, in the majority of cases in Australia.\n\nThis monolingual mindset is totally out of sync with our multilingual reality â€” around 300 languages are spoken in Australia on any given day.\n\nThere are two ways people can lose the languages they speak.\n\nThe first is through linguistic colonisation, which is what's happened to many Indigenous and minority languages around the world.\n\nThe second is linguistic assimilation.\n\nThat's when immigrants lose their languages as they gradually shift towards the dominant language, English â€” itself a migrant language.\n\nEmbracing language\n\nBut many, like the Cara family, are resisting what feels like an inevitable process of assimilation.\n\nNii Laryea Tetteh is 25, and is working hard to improve his use of the language he spoke as a child, called Ga, which is from his parents' home country Ghana.\n\nGrowing up black in Australia, Nii was subjected to comments such as, \"you look like Nutella,\" or \"you're black because you got spray painted\".\n\n\"You just want to fit in, so you do things like straighten your hair, the typical Aussie things like drinking, going to the pub,\" Nii says.\n\nHe also stopped speaking Ga.\n\nBut working on construction sites as a carpenter, he noticed Arabic being spoken around him, and he began to ask himself, \"why am I disadvantaging myself by hiding my language?\"\n\nFor Nii, speaking Ga is about being true to himself.\n\n\"No matter what I did, there'd always be someone or one person that would do something to remind me that I wasn't from here, like even your close friends,\" he says.\n\nNii now speaks Ga with his mum as much as possible, and is excited that he recently managed to have a phone conversation solely in Ga for the first time with his grandmother in Ghana.\n\nSpeaking to grandma in language might seem like a trivial event, but these transnational connections, together with opportunities to use Ga at home, constitute what linguists call \"language ecology\", a supportive language environment that will make all the difference to Nii's efforts to reclaim the language of his childhood.\n\nLanguage ecology is exactly what Billy Jangala Williams has been largely denied.\n\nBilly always spoke a smattering of Gamilaraay words, but growing up Aboriginal in small town Collarenebri in north west NSW, \"language was in some ways the most difficult thing to access\".\n\n\"My mob were told you can't talk it, don't you dare speak that, even don't say you're Aboriginal, even that far.\"\n\nNow 45, he's started formal lessons in Gamilaraay, and feels the gravity and enormity of the task.\n\nFor Billy, speaking his language is about identity.\n\n\"There's also a sense of connection, and maybe a healing that happens as well,\" he explains.\n\nHolding onto his language involves much higher stakes for Billy compared to Gaby and Alexia, or Nii.\n\nGlobally, there are at least 60 million people who speak Italian, and around 1 million speak Ga.\n\nBut according to the 2016 Census, there are only 105 speakers of Gamilaraay.\n\nAnd that raises an important question for all of us living in multicultural Australia.\n\nIf language is key to people's cultural identity, doesn't it make sense that we value our rich multilingualism?\n\nGaby appreciates how important knowing Italian is.\n\nHer language not only connects her to her nonna, but also gives her an understanding of different cultures.\n\n\"When we were younger, we didn't think anything of going to Italy,\" she says.\n\nShe's now 30, and understands that living in Italy as a kid was also about experiencing a different culture, which is why she's determined to pass Italian on to the next generation.\n\nThat would mean that four generations of Caras speak Italian â€” a small yet significant contribution to countering the image of Australia as a \"graveyard of languages.\""
