        "text": "Explore the vast world of mushrooms, including dependable criminis, meaty morels, and more.\n\nPrized for their versatility and meat-like heft and texture, mushrooms are popular worldwide—and they come in many forms. Different types of mushrooms for cooking include basic buttons, meaty king oysters, and elusive honeycomb-like morels. Below, we’re diving into the various edible mushroom varieties, from the most common mushrooms (i.e., the ones you’ll find on a slice from the local pizza shop) to the wild fungi you might spot at the farmers market.\n\nOnce you’ve learned about all the different types of mushrooms, it’s time to get cooking. Fold pulled oyster mushrooms into tacos or buttons into quesadillas, toss crispy shiitake mushrooms with creamy pasta carbonara, or sauté a mix of mushrooms to make vegan cheesesteaks. Mushrooms also add juiciness to burger patties and a boost of umami to stir-fries and noodle dishes. Still hungry? We’ve got lots more mushroom recipes."
