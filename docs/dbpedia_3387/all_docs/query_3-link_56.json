        "text": "Doubleheader To Feature Stanford vs. Ohio State & UCLA vs. Creighton\n\n8/5/2024 12:00:00 PM\n\nSan Francisco, Calif. – The Chase Center announced on Monday, August 5 that the venue will host the Invisalign® Bay Area Women's Classic on Friday, December 20, 2024. The women's college basketball doubleheader will feature Stanford facing The Ohio State, followed by UCLA taking on Creighton. Both games will be televised by FOX Sports. Game times will be announced at a later date.\n\nCreighton will travel to the Bay Area coming off its most successful three season run ever, earning three straight NCAA Tournament appearances for the first time in program history. The highlight of their trio of seasons came in 2022 as Creighton advanced to the Elite Eight, victorious over Colorado, Iowa, and Iowa State during the 2022 NCAA Tournament. The Bluejays see the return of veteran starters Mallory Brake, Lauren Jensen, Morgan Maly and Molly Mogensen, each of whom played a key role in the Bluejays' successful run. Head Coach Jim Flanery enters his 23rd season at Creighton and is the school's all-time victory leader (402 wins).\n\nUCLA enjoyed a historic 2023-24 season, highlighted by the program's first ever victory over UConn, a nine-week run at No. 2 in the AP Top 25, and a +13.9 rebounding margin, the best in the nation. The Bruins see the return of All-Pac-12 duo Kiki Rice and Lauren Betts and add incoming transfer Timea Gardiner, who was the Pac-12 Sixth Player of the Year for the 2023-24 campaign. Under Head Coach Cori Close, the Bruins have made back-to-back Sweet 16 appearances and have been to seven of the last eight NCAA Tournaments. Close boasts an all-time record of 287-140, trailing only UCLA legend Billie Moore (296-181) in the all-time wins' category as she enters her 13 season at the helm of the Bruins.\n\nThe Stanford Cardinal returns to Chase Center five years after their 97-71 victory over the University of San Francisco in 2019. Ahead of the 2024-25 season, the Cardinal have returned nine players and added transfers Tess Heal, the 2023 West Coast Conference Newcomer of the Year at Santa Clara, and Mary Ashley Stevenson, the 2024 Big Ten Media Freshman of the Year at Purdue. Head Coach Kate Paye guides Stanford into its inaugural ACC season. Formerly a two-time WBCA Assistant Coach of the Year under Tara VanDerveer, Paye leads a team that compiled a 30-6 record last season and ended the season ranked ninth nationally.\n\nHeading into the 2024-25 season, the Ohio State Buckeyes have a new look with former Big Ten Freshman of the Year Cotie McMahon as well as All-Big Ten honoree Taylor Thierry, as the duo was second and third scoring on the team last season and served as the team's top two rebounders. During the 2023-24 season, Ohio State had 15 consecutive Big Ten wins, going undefeated in January and February, marking the program's second-longest conference winning streak. Head Coach Kevin McGuff, entering his 12th season with the team, was named Big Ten Coach of the Year by both the conference's coaches and media.\n\nThe Invisalign® Bay Area Classic will be a single-admission doubleheader, and each fan will only need to purchase one ticket to gain admission for both games. Tickets go on sale tomorrow, August 6, at 12 p.m. with an exclusive presale event for Golden State Valkyries season ticket deposit holders. On Wednesday, August 7, Chase Center Insiders will have presale access beginning at 10 a.m. before tickets go on sale to the general public on Thursday, August 8, at 10 a.m. Tickets can be purchased at chasecenter.com.\n\nAlign Technology, makers of the Invisalign System of clear aligners, will partner to bring the Invisalign® Bay Area Classic to Chase Center for an event that will bring smiles and competitive play from elite athletes.\n\nFor more information on Chase Center, please visit chasecenter.com."
