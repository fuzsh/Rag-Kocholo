The Italian premiere of Pascal Dusapin's Medeamaterial, the now famous operatic adaptation of Heiner MÃ¼ller's work of the same title, has been awarded the Franco Abbiati Prize. This is the first time this prize, universally considered as the Oscars for opera in Italy, has been given to a contemporary French work. The 2017 production, directed by Pamela Hunter and conducted by Marco Angius, was commissioned by the Teatro Comunale in Bologna.

The Franco Abbiati Prize, awarded under the patronage of the President of the Republic of Italy and the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage, Activities and Tourism, was founded in 1980 as a tribute to the great musical critic of the Corriere della Sera newpaper.
