        "text": "Pianist Emanuele Arciuli has established himself as one of the most original and interesting performers on today’s classical music scene. His repertoire ranges from Bach to contemporary music, with a strong affinity for composers from the United States. Having gained the respect of distinguished composers such as Helmut Lachenmann and George Crumb, Emanuele Arciuli has had many new works written for him, including piano concertos by Michael Nyman, Lorenzo Ferrero, Filippo Del Corno, Michele dall’Ongaro, Carlo Boccadoro, and Louis W. Ballard, whose Indiana Concerto he premiered in 2008 with the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. Also a writer and musicologist, Arciuli published Rifugio Intermedio, a book about contemporary piano music in Italy and the United States, in 2006. His newest comprehensive book on American piano music, Musica per pianoforte negli Stati Uniti, was recently published in Italy and presented at the MiTo Settembre Musica Festival in Torino by Enzo Restagno. In May 2011, Emanuele Arciuli was awarded the most important Italian critic’s prize, the Premio Franco Abbiati. The jury stated, “This pianist from Bari has been an authoritative figure on the multifaceted horizon of all things modern for years, all the while preserving a connection to tradition.” He is a professor at the conservatory in Bari and a frequent guest professor at the Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music and other American universities."
