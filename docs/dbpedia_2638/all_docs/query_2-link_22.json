        "text": "SOMETHING is obvious after a rocky start of the season, something that can be corrected and that if solved can play in our advantage for the rest of the season : we don’t have a fixed starting 11.\n\nBesides from the obvious “undisputable starters” like Abbiati, Abate, Nesta, Thiago Silva, Van Bommel and Ibrahimovic who don’t have a replacement as good as they are ( with Abbiati’s lack of response this season Amelia might get a few chances though), we have a rotating squad. Aquilani, Robinho, Cassano, Pato, Nocerino, Boateng, Emanuelson, Gattuso, Ambrosini, Seedorf, Taiwo, Antonini and Zambrotta, these are a few of the names in our squad who don’t have a secured spot in Allegri’s formation, not because they are not good, but rather because they are not outstanding in their respective positions. Cassano ? not enough stamina, Binho ? while his workrate has been undispensible for us, coming out of an injury seems to slow him a bit, Pato ? we all know the deal with Pato not being able to come out of his shell and finally blossom. Everyone has his ups and downs and thats why they are not starters.\n\nThis is a huge disadvantage because we don’t have one precise style of play. Our style depends on the players that Allegri picks to be on the field. If Binho enters we have pace, if Cassano is in we have more creativity, if none are there we look stagnant, Antonini and Bonera in defense ? we might as well put a couple of fire hydrants on the pitch (although this far they have been a slightly better version of themselves, SLIGHTLY) etc etc. The possible formations are far too many, this means Allegri has one question : Who’s playing next match ? Easy to say pick this and that, but remember he’s the one that sees them train everyday so the choices are up to him and should he choose wrong something like what happened in the first half versus Lecce can happen, or worst, remember the Juve match ?\n\nAC Milan-Parma FC: Official line-ups\n\nAllegri nominated for Coach of the Year Award\n\nIt’s like Allegri has one equation to solve but he has many variables in that equation. Far a greater challenge that what it looks like considering the talent at his disposal is more limited than shall we say Real Madrid, Barcelona, Chelsea or Manchester City. Although this might seem unusual it’s rather characteristic of Allegri. He hasn’t the best starting record with Milan nor Cagliari but remember that last year once he discovered the secret formula, Milan were on track to their first scudetto in a while. All we can hope for is for our summer arrivals to fit in well in Allegri’s scheme. Some of those players are allegedly the replacements for our aging “Senators”, Nocerino for Gattuso, Aquilani for Pirlo and Boateng for Ambro some might say, but each player has a unique characteristic, characteristics with whom Allegri will need to work.\n\nHowever, this unfixed starting eleven we’re dealing with has an upside : many of our players seem to be getting some well deserved rest. Rotation might seem like a not so good idea, but down the road it will allow our team to play more fresh and efficient football.\n\nThus far this season we have seen the best of Milan and the worst of Milan : an almost perfect defensive night at Barcelona and a train wreck against Napoli or Juve; a Milan side that didn’t bring any spark to the game, and an unbelievable 2nd half against Lecce or the great match we had against Parma. Certainly a beginning of a campaign full of emotions on and off the pitch but it’s about time to get serious and do not let any point get out of our hands. Let’s seize the moment and not let our midfielders great form be wasted and since Zlatan seems to be almost always on fire, all we need is our defense to be as great as last year’s to achieve our goals.\n\nThere’s also the UCL theme on the table, with our very beloved team tied up in the first spot of a group containing the best team in the world (Barcelona) right now and two barely known clubs (BATE and Viktoria Plzn ) and I do believe we can steal that first place slot. Even though many don’t think so, I have a very very good feeling about us going far in this competition this year, it’s only a matter of Allegri not doing the same mistakes he did last year, and if one thing we know is that Allegri rarely does the same mistake twice. By the playoffs round we should have our entire squad back again (Flamini who many don’t like and Gattuso ) and Allegri we’ll have plenty more confidence and trust in some of the new players.\n\nThere’s also the “Silva” incident that I wanted to talk about. There has been a few rumours about Silva leaving Milan next year, and even if this seems to be a concrete possibility, I’d rather take Silva’s word intead of the media’s. Last year he claimed he wanted his number to be retired at the end of his career but in order for this to happen, he’ll need to show Milan a lot of love and fidelity. The other two players that got their numbers retired are Maldini who played for 25 years with our club and never he spoke of leaving, and Franco Baresi who stuck with the club even when we got relegated in the 80’s. “With great comes a great responsibility” goes the saying and “to be respected you need to show respect” and while many can be bought by money or glory, I think Thiago is made out of champions’ material. To me Thiago Silva is a pure representation of the two quotes above, he is class and elegance on it’s own, he’s a man of his word. And even though Berlusconi and Galliani seem to be rather calm by these rumours I’d like to see what Barcelona’s president would say if someone offered 25 million for Pique, Busquets or Iniesta…\n\nWith our midfield gaining practice and getting to know each other, our defense getting back to their usual level and our attack as good as last year, the road ahead seems good but with a few obstacles in our way. We just reduced our difference with the top of the table to 2 points and knowing Juve they’ll probably slip a few times in the near future. It might have seemed far-fetched a few weeks ago but Milan seem to be on their way back to that great form we had last year.\n\nForza Milan!\n\nFollow me on Twitter @Fr_vasquez"
