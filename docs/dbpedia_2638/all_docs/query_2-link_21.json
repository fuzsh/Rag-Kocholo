        "text": "CARLO FUMAGALLI/Associated Press\n\nAC Milan have contributed more than their fair share to the pantheon of legendary footballers. Throughout the club’s illustrious history, however, there were also players who didn’t quite hit such prestigious heights.\n\nThese players weren’t necessarily global superstars of their era nor are they remembered with quite the same reverence. But within the collective consciousness of Milanisti, they live on thanks to their talent, contribution, loyalty and love for the shirt.\n\nSome of these cult heroes provided Milan’s fans with brief individual moments of joy, others provided years' worth of memories. Some were admired for their skill, others for their work ethic.\n\nPicking a team from Milan’s cult heroes is a hard task given the sheer quantity of players to choose from, but that’s exactly what we here at Bleacher Report have done.\n\nRead on to find out who made the cut, and don’t hesitate to join the debate if one of your favourites has been left out.\n\nANTONIO CALANNI/Associated Press\n\nGoalkeepers\n\nEnrico Albertosi (1974-1980)\n\nThe eccentric Albertosi joined Milan at 34 years old. Despite his advanced age, he didn’t miss a league game in his first five years with the club before helping them to a Scudetto in 1979.\n\nGiovanni Galli (1986-1990)\n\nA European Cup winner in both 1989 and 1990, Giovanni Galli was an important yet understated component in one of Milan’s greatest-ever teams.\n\nDefenders\n\nFilippo Galli (1981-1996)\n\nA versatile defender, Filippo Galli found it difficult to obtain regular football with Milan as he had to compete with Mauro Tassoti, Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi and Alessandro Costacurta. He nonetheless served the club well during a 15-year spell.\n\nJaap Stam (2004-2006)\n\nBy the time he joined Milan, Stam was arguably beyond the peak of his powers, but he remained a solid influence for two seasons before returning to the Netherlands with Ajax.\n\nAngelo Anquilletti (1966-1977)\n\nAn effective defensive full-back, Anquilletti played an important role in helping Nereo Rocco’s Milan side to European Cup victory in 1969.\n\nSerginho (1999-2008)\n\nA voraciously energetic full-back, Serginho patrolled Milan’s left touchline with attacking intent, earning the nickname \"Concorde\" for his speed.\n\nMidfielders\n\nRomeo Benetti (1970-1976)\n\nAn uncouth hard man and Milan captain, Benetti was feared by opponents and loved by team-mates for his relentless graft and unapologetically ferocious tackling.\n\nDino Sani (1961-1964)\n\nA player of immense technical gifts, Sani was the lesser known of Milan’s playmaking forces in the 1960s, where he created quietly in the shadow of Gianni Rivera.\n\nAlberigo Evani (1980-1993)\n\nA disciplined and intelligent player, Evani starred on the left side of midfield for Sacchi’s Milan and scored the winning goal in the 1989 Intercontinental Cup victory over Atletico Nacional.\n\nJuan Alberto Schiaffino (1954-1960)\n\nA 1950 World Cup winner with Uruguay, Schiaffino’s signature saw Milan break the world transfer record at the time. The skilled inside forward would go on to win three Scudetti with the Rossoneri.\n\nForwards\n\nAngelo Sormani (1965-1970)\n\nThe Brazilian-born Sormani made his name in Italy, particularly enjoying his spell with Milan, where he would spend more time than with any other club. A hulking centre-forward, he won almost everything there was to win during his five years at San Siro.\n\nHernan Crespo (2004-2005)\n\nAlthough Crespo only spent one season with Milan, he left an indelible mark. He hit 18 goals, one of which was a stunning chipped effort in the 2005 Champions League final defeat to Liverpool.\n\nVI-Images/Getty Images\n\nChristian Abbiati’s career is a testament to self-sacrifice. After arriving from Monza in 1998, he enjoyed four fruitful years before being benched in favour of Dida. However, instead of leaving at the first attempt, he remained loyal to Milan.\n\nEventually the agile shot-stopper would reclaim his spot between the posts, and in 2013 he would break the legendary Sebastiano Rossi’s record for most goalkeeping appearances for the club, per Football Italia.\n\nNow aged 38, Abbiati is still on the club’s books though currently finds himself behind Gianluigi Donnarumma—a player 22 years his junior—in the pecking order.\n\nPASCAL PAVANI/Getty Images\n\nAn attacking midfielder of impeccable technique, Dejan Savicevic arrived at Milan in 1992 from Red Star Belgrade for a fee of £9.4 million, which at the time represented serious money.\n\nHe was already a star after featuring at the 1990 World Cup with Yugoslavia and winning the 1991 European Cup with Red Star, though he never quite established himself in the same way with Milan, primarily because he was often marginalised by coach Fabio Capello.\n\nThe languid Montenegrin was still able to leave an emphatic mark on the club with his finest moment being a lustrous lob over Barcelona’s Andoni Zubizaretta in the 1994 Champions League final.\n\nThat finish embedded his exquisite quality within the hearts and minds of Milanisti.\n\nGonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images\n\nMassimo Ambrosini joined Milan at the end of an incredible era. The club had dominated Italian football throughout much of the early 1990s, and the enthusiastic young midfielder was expected to be a part of the next cycle of success.\n\nHe played a part in Milan’s Serie A title win in 1999 but would then struggle to regain a regular starting berth due to the intertwined brilliance of Andrea Pirlo, Gennaro Gattuso and Clarence Seedorf.\n\nEventually Ambrosini forced coach Carlo Ancelotti to bring in the \"Christmas Tree\" 4-3-2-1 formation so that he could utilise the player alongside Gattuso and Pirlo, with Seedorf playing a more advanced role alongside Kaka.\n\nFollowing Paolo Maldini’s retirement, Ambrosini took the club captaincy, outlasted his aforementioned team-mates and went on to make 489 appearances in all competitions for Milan.\n\nLUCA BRUNO/Associated Press\n\nPietro Paolo Virdis was a rare breed of striker; a clinical concoction of elegant finishing with both feet and imperious aerial ability. The combination made him a perfect poacher in and around the opposition penalty area.\n\nAfter failing to make an impact with Juventus, Virdis suffered injury problems at Udinese before signing for Milan in 1984, where he would experience his prime playing years.\n\nIn 1986-87, he was at his ruthless best, scoring 17 times to finish the season as Serie A’s top goalscorer, while in the following campaign, he helped the club to their first league title in nine years.\n\nLuca Bruno/Associated Press\n\nWith his shaggy hair, short stature and pristine white boots, Marco Simone always stood out on a football pitch. However, beyond the foppish appearance lay a forward of class and efficiency.\n\nA potent taker of chances, Simone was also an ample creator who relished playing in more expansive roles. His ball control and link-up play enabled him to occupy deeper and wider positions, a trait that made him all the more appreciated at Milan.\n\nHis versatility and undeniable quality ensured he got regular game time despite the fact he had to compete with three different FIFA World Player of the Year winners—Marco van Basten, Roberto Baggio and George Weah—during his time with the Rossoneri.\n\nArguably Simone’s best season with the club came in 1995-96, when he hit 21 goals in all competitions whilst aiding Milan to the Champions League final, which they ultimately lost to Louis van Gaal’s precocious Ajax side."
