        "text": "Cut out of the will of the very wealthy Tuscan businessman Buoso Donati, who died unexpectedly in his home, the man’s relatives turn to Gianni Schicchi, a wheeler-dealer who is famous for nonchalantly navigating the quibbles of the law. Schicchi is initially uninterested but he accepts the job on the insistence of his daughter Lauretta, who is in love with Rinuccio, Donati’s young nephew. Since there is no official communication of Donati’s death, Schicchi tells them to hide the body and he takes the place of the dead man to dictate a new will. But his clients don’t know that Schicchi is so crafty that he, in turn, has organized the perfect scam...\n\n“Right from the start, I said, ‘I’m only going to make this movie if I can shoot the entire film live.’ And that’s what happened! This was the only way the performers could have the chance to express themselves in front of the movie camera in the most involving, compassionate, and direct way possible. This is what I was looking for: to turn an opera into cinema. I chose Puccini because his composing style is already cinematographic in itself and the story Forzano invented is a perfect narrative plot, worthy of a commedia all’italiana by Monicelli. Following this inspiration and letting myself be guided by intuition, I created my first musical film, that lives thanks to the expertise of a fantastic crew who embraced the project and supported it with great passion.”"
