LUKE’S LED BY ROBERTO ABBADO\n\nAND BROADWAY STAR BEBE NEUWIRTH\n\nSATURDAY, JUNE 23 at 8:30 PM\n\nKATONAH, NY – On Saturday, June 23, Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts opens its 67th annual Summer Music Festival with an evening of Mendelssohn. Celebrated violinist Gil Shaham opens the program with Mendelssohn’s Violin Concerto in E minor, Op. 64. The Orchestra of St. Luke’s, conducted by Roberto Abbado, will continue the evening with selections from Mendelssohn’s masterful incidental music to A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Broadway luminary Bebe Neuwirth will read excerpts of Shakespeare’s play to contextualize the symphonic piece.\n\n“I am so pleased to present this work on the grounds of Caramoor,” says Michael Barrett. “The setting here is perfect for a piece where strange and supernatural things could occur. Caramoor is the perfect summer place for the suspension of our disbelief, and the full participation of the imagination. The beauty of Shakespeare’s poetry is certainly an additional delight for what I think will be a perfect evening: nature, music, poetry, and a feeling of youthful wonder permeating it all.”\n\nTICKETS\n\nTickets for Caramoor’s Opening Night concert are $15, $21, $36, $51, $66, and $85 and may be purchased at the Caramoor Box Office, 914.232.1252 or ordered online at www.caramoor.org.

LUKE’S\n\nNow in its 37th season, Orchestra of St. Luke’s (OSL) is one of America’s foremost and most versatile ensembles. OSL was formed at the Caramoor International Music Festival in the summer of 1979, after evolving from St. Luke’s Chamber Ensemble, which was established at The Church of St. Luke in the Fields in New York’s Greenwich Village in 1974. Dedicated to engaging audiences throughout New York City and beyond, OSL performs approximately 70 concerts each year and holds a summer residency at the Caramoor International Music Festival. OSL’s Principal Conductor is Pablo Heras-Casado.\n\nABOUT CARAMOOR\n\nCaramoor is the legacy of Walter and Lucie Rosen, who built their summer home – now known as the historic Rosen House at Caramoor – and filled it with their treasures. Walter Rosen was the master planner for the Caramoor estate, realizing his dream of creating a place to entertain friends from around the world. Their musical evenings were the seeds of today’s Caramoor International Music Festival. Witnessing the pleasure their friends took in the beauty of Caramoor – the house with its art collection, the gardens, and the musical programs on summer evenings –the Rosens established a public charity to open Caramoor to the community in 1946. Lucie Rosen survived her husband by seventeen years. During those years, she expanded the Music Festival. The Spanish Courtyard was used as a setting for musical events, as it is today, and, under her direction, the great stage of the Venetian Theater was built.\n\nCaramoor is a performing arts center located on a unique 90-acre setting of Italianate architecture and gardens in Westchester County, NY. It enriches the lives of its audiences through innovative and diverse musical performances of the highest quality. Its mission also includes mentoring young professional musicians and providing educational programs for young children centered on music. It is often described as “A Garden of Great Music”, where audiences are invited to come early, explore the beautiful grounds, enjoy a pre-concert picnic, and discover beautiful music in the relaxed settings of the Venetian Theater, Spanish Courtyard, Music Room of the Rosen House, and the magnificent gardens.\n\nWith its unique heritage, Caramoor remains a place where magical summer days and nights are shared and enjoyed by thousands. “Caramoor is the loveliest Festival of them all.” – The New York Times\n\nConcert Venues and Gardens\n\nMost Summer Festival concerts take place in two outdoor theaters: the 1714-seat, acoustically superb Venetian Theater and the more intimate, romantic Spanish Courtyard. Caramoor’s gardens are also well worth the visit and include nine unique perennial gardens. Among them are a Sense Circle for the visually handicapped, a Butterfly Garden, Tapestry Hedge, and the Iris and Peony Garden.\n\nGETTING TO CARAMOOR\n\nBy car from the West Side of Manhattan and New Jersey, take the Saw Mill River Parkway north to Katonah.
