        "text": "In hindsight, the 2005 derby was a shocking and enduring exception, a mischaracterisation. The rivalry known as the Madonnina in honour of the golden statue of the Madonna atop Milan’s whiter-than-white cathedral has personified her class and grace. It has reflected the city’s strong corporate identity and wealth as the home to Italy’s stock exchange. It has routinely provided a reminder of Milan’s status as a fashion capital.\n\n“Right now, Milan is the biggest football city in Europe and probably the world,” Shevchenko said on the eve of the 2005 quarter-final. It was not hyperbole then and maybe it isn’t now either. In the ‘show us your medals’ stakes, only the city of Madrid can line up more Champions League trophies than Milan and, in the Spanish capital, it’s totally one-sided. Real Madrid have 14 of them gleaming resplendently in their backlit cabinets, while Atletico, as Cristiano Ronaldo likes to remind them, have diddly squat.\n\nMilan, by contrast, counts 10 to its name and they’re slightly more evenly distributed. Seven are housed in the Casa Milan offices in Portello. Three are upstairs at Inter HQ on Viale della Liberazione. As Zara tends to do with Prada and Armani, Real have periodically taken things from Milan in order to keep up appearances. Imitation is, after all, the highest form of flattery, whether it’s appointing Sacchi as director of football or the dons Fabio (Capello) and Carlo (Ancelotti) as coaches. Game recognises game.\n\nAnd to think, for all the grandeur now associated with calcio Milanese, its origins can be traced back to a butchers shop on Mansfield Road in Nottingham in the late 19th century. The moustachioed Herbert Kilpin was one of football’s pioneers. Walking past the Arboretum, a bucket of pig’s blood in his hand, he was suddenly transfixed by a group of lads kicking a pig’s bladder around. Kilpin joined in and over a couple of post-match pints decided to form a team in the colour of the “most heroic figure in Europe”: a freedom fighter he called ‘Gary Baldy’. Giuseppe Garibaldi was in the process of unifying a country of city-states into the single entity we now call Italy, his devotees taking Sicily wearing the colour of red that Nottingham Forest wear in the Premier League today.\n\nRather than stay in the family business, Kilpin wanted to take a butcher’s hook — “look'”in cockney rhyming slang — at Italy. He worked in the textiles industry, playing football and cricket when he wasn’t down the factory. Back then, the nascent power base of Italian football had two poles. One was in Genoa, the other in Turin, which is where Kilpin first pitched up. Drawn to Milan more and more for work, Kilpin ripped yarns rather than spun them. He’d hit the American Bar and Spaten where the beers and whiskeys were good, and ended up assembling a motley crew of Brits, Swiss and Italians to take on Juventus and their Notts County uniforms, as well as the team founded by the naval doctor James Richardson Spensley, known as Genoa Cricket and Football club.\n\nKilpin’s team is what we know today as AC Milan (or AC as the kids around the world like to call them — even though you’d never call Liverpool or any English club ‘FC’, but let’s leave that culture war to my colleague Michael Cox). “We’ll be a team of devils,” Kilpin vowed. “Our colours will be red like fire and black like the fear we will invoke in our opponents.”\n\nThey played at Trotters, a stable with plenty of fields for the thoroughbreds that were trained for horse racing to go out to pasture. Within 10 years of their foundation, Milan won the league three times. But the club unexpectedly started losing members in 1907. The Italian Football Federation had brought in one of those nativist rule changes that put a stop to teams signing up any new foreign players. Milan protested by sitting out the following season. They were defending champions and it was a big deal. It opened up a rift within the club.\n\nMore than 40 members broke away and did so under the assumption that, in a new team, the foreign players signed would be foundational rather than additional. The ‘splinterists’ met at the Caffe Commercio and Orologio restaurant on Piazza Duomo and were of an artistic disposition — painters and poets. This played into stereotypes of Milan as the team of the working class, the casciavit (screwdrivers), while their offshoots were bauscia (social climbing; blowhards).\n\nTheir leader, Giorgio Muggiani, was a Don Draper-like figure. He designed advertising campaigns for Cinzano, Pirelli and Martini and, considering the team he founded would later become known as ‘Pazza’ (crazy), it makes complete sense that they were established by mad men. Pointedly, the club was to be called Internazionale “because we are brothers of the world”, Muggiani announced shortly before the clock in the Orologio struck midnight. “This splendid night will give the colours to our emblem”, which he of course designed. “Black and blue against the golden background of the stars.”\n\nOriginally, they played by the grand Naviglio canal. Giorgio Paramithiotti, Inter’s first president, was a useless player and got a reputation for bringing bad luck on matchdays, which meant his role was limited to skippering a boat to fish out lost balls. In a case of nominative determinism, Inter fielded the first all-foreign XI in the history of Serie A in 2006, then became the first club to win the league under foreign ownership in 2021. But all that was years away.\n\nTo understand this rivalry, always bear this in mind: Inter were created from Adam’s rib. They were made from AC Milan. The same but different. Mythologically speaking, it goes some way to explaining why, unlike in Rome where you leave Roma for Lazio or vice-versa under threat of death, playing for Milan and Inter is begrudgingly swallowable. The five Cevenini brothers — five! — switched between both teams in the early years. So, too, did the player after whom San Siro is named, the superstar of the interwar period Giuseppe Meazza. The list of people to have crossed the divide is as long as it is high profile: Roberto Baggio, Christian Vieri, Hernan Crespo, Mario Balotelli. Best of all, it is captured in the video of Zlatan Ibrahimovic staring admiringly at the original Ronaldo before one derby.\n\nZlatan was at Inter at the time and had grown up idolising Ronaldo when he played for the same club. Ronaldo left Inter for Spain (Madrid, of course), as would Zlatan, (Barcelona) only to return to Italy with Milan (where Zlatan is now). This season is no different as Inter’s current utility defender Matteo Darmian and playmaker Hakan Calhanoglu both have pasts with their opponent.\n\nIn a city as business-oriented as Milan, relationships can be transactional. Quite literally so if we reflect on the swap deals between the two clubs at the turn of this century when Inter absurdly sent Clarence Seedorf and Andrea Pirlo to Milan in return for Francesco Coco, Drazen Brncic and Andres Guglielminpietro in order to derive an accounting benefit that didn’t come close to balancing out the talent deficit it incurred.\n\nWhile the Madonnina can, at times, feel like that Spiderman meme (where two Spidermen point at each other), division matters. One of the great comedy skits in Italy during the golden age of this rivalry was the Ufficio Facce. It involved a group of guys — comics who supported AC Milan — standing at a bar and guessing someone’s faith or politics by the look on their face as they walked through the door. “He’s got the face of an Interista!”.\n\nNo one looked more like one than Giuseppe “Peppino” Prisco, Inter’s silver-tongued legal counsel. Fans still sing his name today, which is some achievement for a lawyer. Prisco personified what it meant to be an Interista. “If my son had supported Milan, I would have asked for a DNA test because at that stage I would no longer be able to trust my wife,” Prisco said. “In Milan, there are two teams and two teams only: Inter and Inter’s Primavera (the Under-19s).”\n\nFamilies have been split by the derby. Brothers have found themselves on the wrong side of the tracks. Franco Baresi went down to Serie B with AC Milan in 1980, the same year his brother Giuseppe won the Scudetto with Inter. Filippo Inzaghi, the hero of Milan’s last Champions League triumph in Athens in 2007, has informed his younger brother Simone, the current coach of Inter: “I’m happy for him and he deserves to make this semi-final, but I am tied to Milan and will always be their supporter.”\n\nFor all the mixing, no derby in football is defined more by dynasty than the Madonnina. Milan were the first team from Italy to win the old European Cup. Hoisting it over his head at Wembley in 1963 was Cesare Maldini, the skipper of Rocco’s great side. That stirred something within Inter, who were bankrolled by an oil man, Angelo Moratti, and coached by the proto-Mourinho Herrera.\n\nThey became champions of Europe the following year, a staffetta (relay) that tracked the national team’s awkward alternation of the clubs’ legendary No 10s: Gianni Rivera (Milan) and Sandro Mazzola (Inter). In the swinging 1960s, the trophy swung back and forth between cousins as the city of Milan came to be represented in five finals over the decade.\n\nIt ensured Milan and Inter would always measure themselves on success in Europe, something that was passed down from father to son — from Cesare to Paolo Maldini and Angelo to Massimo Moratti, both of whom would build on their inheritance. Paolo eclipsed his old man and became indelibly linked with his club and this competition. Only the late Paco Gento (six with Madrid) has more winners’ medals (five) than him — although Paolo, the competitor that he is, still rues the finals he lost in 1993, 1995 and, of course, 2005 when Milan were 3-0 up at half-time against Liverpool in Istanbul.\n\n“I was chatting to Zvonimir Boban (former Milan player) and Ricky Massara (Milan’s sporting director) and came to this consideration,” Maldini, who is now Milan’s technical director, said. “I’m the biggest loser in the history of the game. I’ve won lots, but I’ve lost loads, too. Three Champions League finals, three Club World Cup finals, a World Cup final, a European Championship final, a World Cup semi-final. I could go on.”\n\nIt’s a reminder of the longevity of Milan’s domination in the quarter of a century of Silvio Berlusconi’s ownership. Love him or hate him, Il Cavaliere (The Knight) was a visionary. The game as we know it today first appeared in his mind in 1987. Milan were ahead of their time. Sure, Berlusconi invested a billion back when a billion was a lot of money. Sure, the Pope found the world transfer record he paid Torino for Gigi Lentini in 1992 to be immoral. But Milan’s strength derived from their organisation and clairvoyance. Sacchi’s tactics changed the game. MilanLab (the high-tech scientific research centre) prolonged the careers of Hall of Famers. Scouts uncovered Ballon d’Or winners like Kaka before anyone had even heard of them.\n\nInter tried to keep up. In response to the Milan of the Three Dutchman (Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard) came the Inter of the Three Germans (Lothar Matthaus, Andreas Brehme and later Jurgen Klinsmann). But for a long time, Milan operated on the premise that whatever they can do, we can do better. When Inter won the league in 1989 with a record points total in the era of two points for a win, Milan one-upped them by winning the European Cup at the Camp Nou.\n\nThe trend continued for a long time even after Massimo Moratti brought Inter back into the family’s control in 1995. Moratti was possessed by a Todd Boehly-esque flair for stockpiling and indulging absurdly talented players — Alvaro Recoba, to name just one — without winning the prizes he cared about most. It was maddening and the Pazza Inter contrasted starkly with the calm assurance embodied by personalities like Ancelotti at Milan.\n\nIn all, Inter went 18 years without winning the league and even when they were able to sing about retaining the title in 2007, Milan lifted the Champions League again. “You can shove the Scudetto up your a***!” was the banner Maldini’s team-mate Massimo Ambrosini held aloft on an open-top bus parading through the city.\n\nMoratti’s last roll of the dice was to hire peak Mourinho who, in 2010, did what no one had done before or since in Italy: the treble. To quote the Special One, everyone else that year won “zeru tituli”. Nothing. Nada. Niente. The triplete was, in his eyes, the one ring to rule them all — and Interisti never tire of brandishing it at Milanisti (and Juventini) together with the mantra of “Mai in B”. Inter have come close but somehow never suffered the indignity of relegation.\n\nAfter watching Javier Zanetti mess up his timeless hair-do by resting the Champions League trophy on his side-parting, a fulfilled Moratti emulated his father and sold up after lavishing €1.2billion of the family fortune on the club he likened to a favourite daughter who he loved to spoil rotten. Berlusconi cashed out of Milan shortly afterwards, unable to compete with the oil and gas of Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi.\n\nBereft, the Milanesi entered the wilderness but have stepped back into the light. Inter overspent to do it and find themselves in financial bother. Milan cut back, got smarter and are built to last. As was the case in the 1960s, one has spurred the other on. Inter’s Scudetto in 2021 was followed by Milan’s in 2022 and when the Champions League draw pitted them on the same side of the bracket, a Euro Derby in the semis felt inevitable.\n\nThe last one at this stage of the competition was 20 years ago. A Shevchenko away goal was all that separated the two teams. That and Christian Abbiati’s thigh denying Mohamed Kallon in stoppage time. Inter have tried to erase all memory of it for the simple reason that being knocked out by their cousins was more than elimination. In some ways, it was their relegation.\n\n“We realise your dreams” was the choreography in Milan’s Curva Sud at the following derby, with the Champions League trophy at its front and centre. Whoever loses this tie will descend into a summer-long nightmare.\n\n(Top photo: AMA/Corbis via Getty Images)"
