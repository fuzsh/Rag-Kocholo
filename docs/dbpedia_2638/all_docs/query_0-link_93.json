But the time was not right yet, seeing that in May 1945, with a message broadcast by the Voice of America , he declined La Scala en- sembleâs invitation to conduct it once again: although he was profoundly moved by the ges- ture, he would never go back so long as there was a monarchy, explicitly accused of âbeing an accomplice to the crimes committed by the Fascists in its name.â âI will be happy to re- turn amongst you as the citizen of a free Italy, and not as a subject of the king and the princ- es of the House of Savoy,â was how he ended his message. These were harsh words, that undeniably triggered the bitter protests of the monarchists. Not to mention the many who over the years accused him of having been an accomplice to the air raids on Italyâs cities. But in the end, Toscanini did return, and he did so even before the popular referendum that was held to decide whether Italy was to become a Republic, or remain a monarchy. And his message was heard by the listeners of the Voice of America, although the parts that related to the Savoys were cut . Political conve- nience had had the upper hand, and the follow- ing year Toscanini wanted to express, through his daughterWally, the hope that âfinally those around himwould only speak of him as an art- ist; that, by putting aside the politics that had taken him away from his country, his country would be willing to welcome back only a mes- senger of art, and that it only desired to see and wait for him with that identity.â âItaly is free. Toscanini may return,â were the words written on the pamphlet that ap- peared in Milan in April 1946. On May 11 his wishes finally came true. Corriere della Sera critic Franco Abbiati crowned the event with great, understandable emphasis: âToscanini came by La Scala last night like the wise old man of the fables who returns to his love who once wept for him, but now finds him safe and strong in faith and in his teachings.â Afterwards, Toscanini went back to conduct- ing in Europe, and at La Scala in particular, al- most each year, although he mainlyworked for the NBC Symphony Orchestra for the rest of his days. He spent his last years between Villa Pauline in Riverdale and his homes in Italy, in Milan and on the Isolino on Lake Maggiore. Politics no longer interfered much with his desire to finally be considered a âmessenger of artâ and nothing more than that, as he had always demanded and hoped for.
