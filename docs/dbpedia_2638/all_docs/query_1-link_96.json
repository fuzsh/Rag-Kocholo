        "text": "TENTH EDITION OF THE FESTIVAL DEDICATED TO THE COMPOSER FROM BERGAMO\n\nFrom 14 November to 1 December 2024\n\nCelebratory programme with two masterpieces: Roberto Devereux and Don PasqualeZoraida di Granata is the rare word staged for #donizetti200\n\nLU OpeRave returns in a new venue\n\nThe programme includes renowned stars such as Javier Camarena, Roberto de Candia, John Osborn and Jessica Pratt, alongside other established younger performers and students of Bottega Donizetti.\n\nOn the podium, in addition to musical director Riccardo Frizza, we will see two emerging conductors such as IvÃ¡n LÃ³pez Reynoso and Alberto Zanardi.\n\nThe operas will be directed by Stephen Langridge, AmÃ©lie Niermeyer, Bruno Ravella and Mattia Agatiello.\n\nÂ«This is the tenth edition of Donizetti Opera,Â» emphasises artistic director Francesco Micheli, Â«the tenth year we have worked on the construction of a monument to this artist whose greatness is still to be explored, a monument the first piece of which we are proud, and grateful, to have been able to build. On the one hand, we have sought to trace the origins of the man and the artist, presenting his works â both the best- and lesser-known ones â in philologically unexceptionable editions that are consistent with the execution practice of the time. On the other hand, we wanted to combine Donizettiâs revolutionary theatricality with the present time, since we believe that no theatre is as contemporary, vital and necessary as Donizettiâs. we always have the same purpose, today as ten years ago: to popularise Donizettiâs operas, and to spread the beneficial contagion of our love for him in Bergamo, in Italy and throughout the worldÂ».\n\nIn the words of the UNESCO Intangible Heritage committee, explaining the reason for its addition to the list: Â«Italian opera singing is a physiologically controlled way of singing that enhances the carrying power of the voice in acoustic spaces such as amphitheatres and churches. Performed by people of all genders, it is associated with specific facial expressions and body gestures and involves a combination of music, drama, acting and staging. Transmitted orally between a maestro and pupil, the practice promotes collective cohesion and sociocultural memory. It is a means of free expression and intergenerational dialogue and its cultural value is recognised at national and international levelsÂ».\n\nThe American Friends of the Donizetti Opera Festival keeps committed with promoting such intangible heritage in the United States.\n\nThe commission of the 42nd edition of the \"Franco Abbiati\" Music Critics Award has awarded the opening title of Donizetti Opera 2022, La favorite, directed by Riccardo Frizza and staged by Valentina Carrasco, the Abbiati Award for \"Best Show of the Year.\"\n\nThis is the first time that a production from the Bergamo festival, under the direction of Francesco Micheli, has received the highest recognition among the categories considered annually for this prestigious award. In 2020, L'ange de Nisida received the \"Special Award,\" while in 2016, soprano Carmela Remigio and conductor Corrado Rovaris were recognized for their performance in Anna Bolena, the first title staged by the festival.\n\nÂ«I am very happy for this recognition - says Riccardo Frizza, the festival's musical director and conductor for La favorite. It acknowledges the dedication of everyone who makes the festival possible and the choices made over the years with Francesco Micheli. Our commitment is to present Donizetti and his operas with the execution quality and dramatic dignity they deserve. In La favorite, no one has ever taken a step back, from Valentina Carrasco and her entire team to the cast, especially Annalisa Stroppa and Javier Camarena, from the technicians to the orchestra, the chorus, and the wonderful 'favorites' of all ages. We have faced difficult moments in recent years, but the festival has never stopped, and this award, in the year of Bergamo Brescia Capital of Culture, makes me even prouder to be a resident of Brescia in Donizetti's cityÂ»."
