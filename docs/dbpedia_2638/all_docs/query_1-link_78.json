        "text": "Pianist Emanuele Arciuli’s repertoire ranges from Bach to contemporary music, with an emphasis on composers from the United States. Round Midnight Variations, a group of 16 compositions that were written for Arciuli by composers such as Crumb, Babbitt, Kernis, Rzewski, Torke, Daugherty, Bolcom and Harbison, has sparked the interest of international critics. His recording of the variations, which was released by Stradivarius under the title ‘Round Midnight – Hommage to Thelonious Monk in May 2011, has likewise been celebrated by the international press. His numerous recordings (Chandos, Stradivarius, Innova, Vai, Bridge, Wergo, etc.) include Gates to Everywhere, the complete piano works of Berg and Webern, the world premiere of Bruno Maderna’s Concerto for Piano and Orchestra, and a lot of American music. His CD dedicated to George Crumb was nominated for a Grammy Award, and his CD with works by Adams and Rzewski won the Italian critics’ award for Best Record in 2006. Walk in Beauty, a 2cd box just released by Innova, features music by JL Adams, Bresnick, Daugherty, Gann, Garland, Higdon, Ballard, and others.\n\nHis comprehensive book on American piano music, Musica per pianoforte negli Stati Uniti, was recently published in Italy. In 2011, Arciuli was awarded the Italian critic’s prize, the Premio Franco Abbiati. In winning this prize, he follows Maurizio Pollini, Radu Lupu, and Zubin Mehta. The jury stated, “This pianist from Bari has been an authoritative figure on the multifaceted horizon of all things modern for years, all the while preserving a connection to tradition.”"
