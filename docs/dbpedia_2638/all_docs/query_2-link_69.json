Ricordi & Co., Milan. Verdi had paid the artist for terra-cotta sculptures of himself and his wife, and was surprised to find this bust in bronze. In a letter to Verdi of 8 December 1873 (Autograph: St. Agata) Cesare De Sanctis explained, quoting Gemito: \"I had done what I could to make the bust work out in clay, but I remained dissatisfied. . . . I couldn't make another one, because the Maestro wasn't around. . . . Then I had an idea: fire and clay would betray me and ruin my work; even if it were successful, it could not withstand the open air. Therefore, another material — bronze! . . . Thus nothing would destroy my work . . . for which the Maestro so generously compensated me. Now he will even be able to put his bust in the garden. Wind, water, and sun cannot harm it. ...

All prejudices and errors would vanish before your powerful words. Cesare De Sanctis to Giuseppe Verdi 3 May 1872 (Luzio, Carteggi Verdiani, vol. I, p. 152).\n\nThis is a book by Verdi, his friends, and his collaborators. It is not a book about Verdi. In order to present facts instead of opinions, I have attempted to assemble all available source material concerning one of his greatest works, Aida. The letters and documents in this collection, presented chronologically, span a period of twenty-three years and pertain to the genesis, the development, and the first productions of this opera, as well as to significant historical events that affected its fate. The few letters not dealing directly with Aida reflect Verdi's wide range of interests, everyday activities, and thoughts and moods during this time. Choosing these letters from the many that exist was no easy task. But I hope they will link the past to the future and deepen the perspectives of the collection. This book is a result of a lifelong and ever-growing admiration for Giuseppe Verdi, the man and his work. Actually my enthusiasm began some fifty years ago, when Giuseppe Verdi Briefe, edited by Franz Werfel and translated into German by Paul Stefan, added depth and dimension to my youthful enjoyment of the Verdi operas my father conducted in Dresden. And then, in 1941, personal conversations with the dedicated and erudite Werfel provided further insights into the composer's life and work. We had met on the occasion of the first American performance in this century of Verdi's Macbeth, which I staged at the Forty-fourth Street Theatre in New York with a company of then unknown youngsters under my father's direction. (This was also the first American performance of Verdi's 1865 revision of Macbeth. The original 1847 version of the opera was first performed in the United States at New York's ix\n\nx\n\nPREFACE\n\nNiblo's Garden in 1851). The production was declared a \"smash hit,\" but in its wake the first volume of Verdi letters in English translation, appearing a few months later, was not. The young firm of L. B. Fischer, which, in exile, continued some activities of the distinguished German publisher S. Fischer, had decided that Franz Werfel's selection of Verdi letters, translated by Edward Downes, would be its first publication. Arturo Toscanini gave a hundred copies of the book to the members of his NBC Symphony Orchestra, but not many others were sold. For years this important publication was out of print, and various efforts to have it reprinted were futile. When, in 1969, a student of mine suggested a new edition to some two dozen American publishers, the few who replied stated that \"there is no market for Verdi letters in this country.\" A number of people who have made this publication possible think differently and share my belief that Verdi letters enlighten professionals and laymen alike — not only about his own compositions, but also about the creation and production of any opera. In spite of its shortcomings, Charles Osborne's Letters of Giuseppe Verdi, mainly based on Werfel's edition, yet claiming to be \"the first book in the English language to be devoted to Verdi's letters,\" enjoyed much success. In a review of this book Philip Gossett describes the lamentable state of Verdi research: The enormous number of errors in translation and commentary is itself distressing, but worse is the very conception of the edition and the attitude it assumes towards the problems surrounding the Verdi correspondence. Because so many of them intimately relate to the creation of his operas, Verdi's letters hold a special fascination. In correspondence with his librettists, his publishers, critics, and artists, Verdi struggles with the preparation of librettos, compositional problems, aesthetic attitudes, details of production and costumes, in short, all stages in the making of an opera. His extensive personal correspondence . . . documents most aspects of Italian life from 1840 through 1900. In both his business and personal correspondence, Verdi emerges as perhaps the most appealing human being among major composers of the nineteenth century: fiercely independent, a true patriot, full of shrewdness and common sense. In the absence of a complete edition of his correspondence, we must turn to hundreds of separate publications, often in obscure, regional periodicals or newspapers. Many important letters remain unpublished. Even restricting our inquiries to major editions, difficulties abound. A fundamental source, / Copialettere, published by Gaetano Cesari and Alessandro Luzio in 1913, has two parts. The first is a transcription of five note books containing Verdi's drafts for some of his business correspondence, contract negotiations, and dealings with impresarios, to which he also attached some letters received. Running from 1844 through 1901, these letters represent a minute (and often dry) portion of Verdi's letters. There are furthermore large lacunae, no letters being entered (or at least edited here) from May 22, 1858, to September 20, 1867, or from February 9, 1875, to January 1877. The editors assert they will omit \"writings absolutely superfluous for illustrating the personality of the Maestro or the world with which he was in\n\nPREFACE\n\nxi\n\ncontact\" (page xix). With some twenty of eighty written pages unaccounted for in the first book and some fifty of 127 in the second, we might wonder whether we would share their view of what is superfluous. . . . In any event, we must remember these are drafts, not letters sent. Though they may sometimes be identical to the actual letters, often there are divergencies. The second part of I Copialettere poses more serious problems. Luzio and Cesari offer here selected letters to illustrate specific aspects of Verdi's life, works, and character. Though these are more intimate documents, they are casually presented. The editors have felt free to quote only portions of a letter, to divide the same letter into various parts and print these in different sections of the volume, and to suppress information (particularly surrounding the letters to Opprandino Arrivabene). Thus the documents in this part must be used with extreme caution. . . . With few exceptions, scholars have failed to probe the Verdi correspondence. Those communications which seem of greatest interest, letters between Verdi and his librettists, have gone largely unread. The letters of Verdi to Antonio Ghislanzoni, the librettist of Aida, have been available since their publication in I Copialettere in 1913, and have been cited again and again by, among others, Edgar Istel, Franco Abbiati, and Saleh Abdoun. But no commentator has mentioned that their published order (many are dated only with days of the week) is largely wrong. Yet if one reads the letters and seeks to understand them, their correct order is perfectly apparent. If letters dealing with the creation of Aida have been misunderstood, what can we hope for the rest? (The Musical Quarterly, 1973, 59, no. 4, pp. 633-39)\n\nIn view of the popularity of Verdi's operas and the vast amount of literature about him, the scarcity of published and translated correspondence as well as related documents is surprising. Not only do his own words answer questions that arise concerning the performance of his works, but they also sharpen the image of his life, his art, and his reactions to his own time. He expressed his ideas very clearly, but they are still very little known. Too much has been said about Verdi and too little by Verdi himself, although he was as prolific a correspondent as he was a composer. His letters offer infinitely more authentic and revealing insight into his creations, his character, and his intentions than does any biography. For it is inevitable that even the most thoughtful and objective writers are influenced by their own tastes and opinions. Reacting to irresponsible reporting. Verdi himself remarked: \"Such writing cannot be but a bundle of errors, even when one is inspired by the protagonist, because there is always an amour propre involved, or at least a vainglory, which hides what is bad and enlarges what is good. There are so few honest men, so few highminded men. And, as a result, those writers copy what others have said on the same subject; and what they don't know, they invent.\" (Verdi to Opprandino Arrivabene, 8 February 1878.) Unfortunately we have too many Verdi biographies of this kind, marred by scholarly vanity and presumption, as well as by arbitrary, undated, and inaccurate excerpts from his letters — coglionerie\n\nxii\n\nPREFACE\n\n(bullshit), as Verdi himself called such stories by i nostri riparatari (our repairmen). Judging fact to be more interesting, poetic, and dramatic than much fiction, and inspired by the correspondence of great personalities from different times and backgrounds, I determined to study as many Verdi letters and documents as I could. This led to six stimulating and adventurous years of research and discovery that were not without trial and error and the constant reminder that the more we learn the more we realize how little we know. In 1970 I spent part of a sabbatical leave from Indiana University at the Istituto di Studi Verdiani in Parma. The wealth of documents, scores, and reference books contained in the spacious rooms of the Palazzo Marchi, the seat of the institute, was impressive. Since its founding in 1959 this organization had collected some four thousand photocopies of published and unpublished Verdi letters, acquired from individuals and institutions in Europe, Egypt, and the Americas. But this large collection represents only a relatively small portion of the many thousands of letters he wrote during his long life, which are now scattered all over the world. Impressed by the amount of authentic documentation, I was, however, shocked by the many inaccuracies in published transcriptions. As I began to decipher Verdi's handwriting, it became apparent that quite a number of publications do not adhere to the original text and that the only reliable source is the autograph. This is not an unusual experience. Jacques Barzun has aptly recorded the same problems in his introduction to New Letters of Berlioz 1830–1868, pp. xv–xvi. For a short while I entertained the naive idea of trying to collect all the letters that Verdi had ever written. But I concluded that even a trained musicologist could not begin such a complex task at my age and expect to finish it. Others must eventually discover, transcribe, and publish a good deal of Verdi's correspondence in an accurate and responsible manner. \"Your feelings about the art, to which you are giving so much splendor, are so right and deep,\" Giuseppina Strepponi wrote to her future husband on 5 July 1854, \"and you express them with such truthfulness that your letters, written with a golden pen, should really be published if this were the moment for it. In time, this moment will come\" (Luzio, Carteggi, vol. IV, p. 184). Verdi in a letter to the Director of Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt in Stuttgart dated 21 June 1895 (Cesari and Luzio, I Copialettere, p. 403) wholeheartedly disagreed: \"It's quite enough that the musical world has tolerated my music so long! Never shall I condemn it to read my prose!\" And in a letter to Opprandino Arrivabene dated 18 October 1880: \"What need is there to go and drag into the open a composer's letters? They are always written in haste, without care, without attaching any importance to them, because the composer knows that he has no reputation to sustain as a writer. Isn't it enough that they boo him for his music? No, sir! The letters too!\n\nPREFACE\n\nxiii\n\nOh, fame is a great nuisance! The poor little great famous men pay dearly for popularity! Never an hour of peace for them, neither in life nor in death!\" (Alberti, Verdi intimo, pp. 260-61). For obvious reasons posterity begs to differ with Verdi's condemnation of such publications, if sensationalism is avoided. This would not add an iota to our understanding and appreciation of Verdi's healthy and genuine art. Therefore rather than speculate about his intimate personal life, I chose to collect and translate material concerning specific works and to start with Aida. Initially conceived as a book in which Verdi through his letters would speak as his own interpreter, the manuscript grew in scope. Unexpected discoveries of unpublished letters and documents kept postponing publication, while my research in all its phases took place under a lucky star. Since 1970 various grants and fellowships, gratefully received from Indiana University, The American Council of Learned Societies, and The American Philosophical Society, allowed me to work in Europe, mainly in Italy, for five to six weeks every year. While performing my duties at Indiana University, I organized, evaluated, and translated the photocopies of autographs and other papers I was privileged to bring home. Dr. Lawrence Baldassaro helped with the first translations of Verdi's letters. These letters steadily accumulated after his departure from Indiana University and Thomas Holliday, a student of mine, became an intelligent and efficient assistant. When he too left the campus, this book was greatly enhanced by the dedicated collaboration of Dr. Michael Pisoni, whose idealistic commitment and faithful perseverance were priceless. Dr. Gabriella Carrara Verdi, whose family inherited Verdi's estate and archives at St. Agata, agreed with my plan to transcribe and translate significant letters and related documents. Thanks to her trust and generous cooperation, previously unpublished letters and documents of particular interest can be included in this collection. In Milan, Dr. Giampiero Tintori, director of the Museo Teatrale alla Scala, and the well-known musicologist Dr. Guglielmo Barblan of the Conservatory provided useful information. Visits to the Nationalbibliothek in Vienna and the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris were less rewarding but were informative and inspiring. In 1971 I happened to meet Lucien Goldschmidt, a New York autograph dealer, who recognized me after we had served together in the U.S. Army in World War II. He referred me to Herbert Cahoon of the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York, who graciously sent me photocopies of the autographs of the twenty-five letters from Verdi to Antonio Ghislanzoni, which The Mary Flagler Cary Music Collection of the Pierpont Morgan Library had acquired in 1968 from a dealer in England. The major \"find\" of this year, however, was in Milan, where a dear, old friend, attorney and music enthusiast Alfredo Amman, president of the Società del Quartetto, introduced me to Signora\n\nxiv\n\nPREFACE\n\nLuciana Pestalozza of the House of Ricordi, who authorized Maestro Fausto Broussard, an archivist and editor of the firm, to open a vault which contained, among other treasures, 1,471 letters written by Verdi to his publishers between 1845 and 1900, as well as most of his autograph scores. The House of Ricordi photocopied for me hundreds of letters from Verdi and other correspondents concerning Aida. Only a small portion of these letters had been published — in most instances only partially and often incorrectly — by Franco Abbiati in his biography of Giuseppe Verdi. The Verdi Institute in Parma has photocopies of the entire Aida correspondence that was kept in the archives of the Cairo theatre, where Aida was premiered on 24 December 1871. Soon after these photocopies were made, the original documents were destroyed in a disastrous fire on 28 October 1971. Most of these letters were published in the Quaderno 4 dell' Istituto di Studi Verdiani con documentazione inedita sulla genesi dell' \"Aida\" a cura di Saleh Abdoun and, with a few exceptions, are translated here. In 1972, when I was seeking information about Verdi's correspondents, I spent time in Hamburg with the German Egyptologist Professor Dr. Wolfgang Helck, as well as at the Biblioteca della Cassa di Risparmio e Monte di Credito su Pegno in Busseto, the Biblioteca del Senato, the publishing firm of Treccani, and the German Historical Institute in Rome. Professor Giuseppina Allegri Tassoni in Parma furnished important data on the scenic designer Girolamo Magnani, but my efforts to obtain authentic production records of the first Aida performances at La Scala in Milan, in Parma, and in Naples were unsuccessful. However, I did acquire from the Ricordi Archives additional correspondence between Verdi's collaborators and his publishers. Useful material was also obtained from the Museo Teatrale alla Scala in Milan, where the Third International Verdi Congress took place. In London, Frankfurt, and Rome, meetings with the well-known autograph dealers Hermann Baron and Hans Schneider acquainted me with the locations of significant documents. In Zurich the distinguished musicologist Professor Dr. Erwin R. Jacobi offered generous hospitality and advice. In Rome I was introduced to Countess Elena Carandini Albertini, a granddaughter of Puccini's librettist and Arrigo Boito's friend Giuseppe Giacosa, who invited me to consult all of Verdi's letters to Boito. The Countess asked me to suggest an Italian institution to which she might donate these treasures. I suggested the Verdi Institute in Parma and now 141 formerly inaccessible autographs of Verdi's letters to his librettist for Otello and Falstaff, as well as of his letter to Vincenzo Luccardi of 5 June 1872, are in the care of the Institute. Many previous attempts to obtain biographical data on Draneht Bey, the Khedive's intendant in Cairo at the time of the Aida premiere, had been fruitless. In 1973, however, the crescendo of good fortune continued when\n\nPREFACE\n\nxv\n\nmy former colleague Professor Andreas Nomikos suggested I contact his friend, Draneht's grandson, Peter Emmanuel Zervudachi in Vevey, Switzerland. M. Zervudachi provided the answers to my biographical inquiries and also the extraordinary bonus to study, translate, and publish Draneht's hitherto unpublished correspondence, for which I am deeply obliged. In Tutzing near Munich, Hans Schneider showed me 277 letters from Verdi to Giulio Ricordi — letters that once were part of the collection in the Ricordi Archives in Milan. How they found their way to Germany was a mystery their present owner could not explain. He speculated that in the early years of this century Giulio Ricordi's son Tito II might have been responsible for selling them. To prevent the further commercial exploitation and possible disappearance of these precious autographs and to make them available for publication, I tried, unsuccessfully, to interest several individuals and institutions in the United States and abroad in purchasing them from Hans Schneider. Plans by the Italian government to acquire Herr Schneider's Verdi letters for the Institute did not materialize. However, additional discoveries in the Ricordi Archives, at St. Agata, and elsewhere helped to compensate for this disappointment. In Busseto Professor Corrado Mingardi, librarian of the Biblioteca della Cassa di Risparmio e Monte di Credito su Pegno, showed me 333 letters from Emanuele Muzio, Verdi's student and lifelong friend, many of them written from America. Photocopies of these letters were made for the collection of the Institute of Verdi Studies in Parma as well as for mine. A visit with Dr. Rodney Dennis, curator of manuscripts at the Houghton Library of Harvard University, led to the addition of the photocopies of eighteen letters from Verdi to Edoardo Mascheroni, the first conductor of Falstaff, to my collection. In 1974 I found letters and documents, particularly in Vevey and St. Agata, that answered many questions and closed many gaps in the Aida correspondence I had collected and translated to this point. In Vevey M. Zervudachi entrusted me with Draneht's entire Aida correspondence, which I deciphered, transcribed, and translated. The work I was permitted to do in Verdi's own library at St. Agata was especially rewarding, and Dr. Gabriella Carrara Verdi was extremely helpful. Continued biographical research at municipal offices and state archives in Milan and Rome led to more information. In Naples, however, my efforts to track down material were thwarted. The Teatro San Carlo has no archive and the organization of the Lucchesi Palli library requires more time than I could afford. At the Conservatory in Bologna, however, photocopies of ninety-four autograph letters from Verdi and his wife to Maria Waldmann became available within a few hours. In 1975 Dr. Michael Pisoni again was of great assistance in the completion of notes and translations. My sister and her French husband, Martial Singher,\n\nxvi\n\nPREFACE\n\nhelped to transcribe and translate Camille Du Locle's Scenario (Document III), and also to solve other riddles. From the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., my investigations led to the State Department and the National Archives. At the Library of Congress I had the good fortune of meeting Charles Jahant, a visitor to the Library, who answered at least a dozen questions concerning even secondary artists in the nineteenth century. In writing he later generously gave me much information unavailable elsewhere. The hospitality of the German Historical Institute in Rome under the direction of Professor Dr. Reinhard Elze, and its Music Division headed by Dr. Friedrich Lippmann, provided ideal conditions for extended studies. The director of the Theatre National de 1'Opéra in Paris, Professor Rolf Liebermann's introduction to Mlle. Martine Kahane, the curator of the Bibliothèque-Musée de 1'Opéra, augmented my collection and helped to answer several queries. In Busseto Dr. Gabriella Carrara Verdi photocopied some thirty additional unpublished letters from Giulio Ricordi to Verdi and his wife for which I am especially grateful to her; and in August 1976 she informed me of a sudden discovery in Paris, closing a lacuna that has disturbed Verdi scholars for years (See Documents I and II).\n\nMost of the autographs I transcribed and translated have been fairly well preserved and are not too difficult to read if one has a good knowledge of Italian and French. Paul Draneht's letters in M. Zervudachi's possession are copies of the original letters Draneht wrote or dictated. The document, written by hand in copying ink, was pressed through rollers onto very thin, absorbent paper. Such copies of Draneht's letters exist on hundreds of brittle and disintegrating pages in Vevey. Verdi, on the other hand, drafted many of his letters in simple notebooks approximately seven inches wide and nine and one-half inches long. His wife did the same. These copybooks, which are kept at St. Agata, were the basis for Gaetano Cesari and Alessandro Luzio's I Copialettere di Giuseppe Verdi, and Alessandro Luzio's Carteggi Verdiani now out of print. Unfortunately Cesari and Luzio's many errors of transcription were repeated in the editions of Werfel, Abbiati, and others. Abbiati not only perpetuated the errors of his predecessors, but — with all his apparent dedication to his subject and access to many of Verdi's autographs — added many of his own. In Verdi's letter to Giulio Ricordi of 7 October 1870, for example, Abbiati (vol. III, p. 401) misread quart' atto as quartetto. There is no quartet in Aida, as we know it, and never was. Abbiati's pronouncement that \"nothing more was said about an Aida in Vienna; the time was lacking for adequate preparation\" (see note 1, Verdi to Maria Waldmann of 5 June 1875) is one of\n\nPREFACE\n\nxvii\n\nmany false and misleading bits of information. In Jacques-Gabriel Prod'homme's transcription of Verdi's letter to Du Locle of 26 May 1870 even the scarcely infallible Luzio (vol. IV, p. 9n) noted this amusing misreading: \"Now let us consider the general feminine situation in Egypt, and then we shall decide.\" Verdi, who was interested in the Khedive's money rather than his harem, wrote le condizioni pecuniarie. The same Prod'homme said Du Locle died ten years before he actually did and declared that \"Madame Verdi had created La Traviata and died three years later than the maestro\" (The Musical Quarterly, 1921, 7, no. 4, p. 76). To point out the many errors committed in the Aida literature alone would fill another book. Verdi research needs unbiased and accurate presentations of fact without emotional interpretation and superfluous comment. Most of the letters I have collected, selected, and translated will be selfexplanatory and will enable the reader to draw his or her own conclusions. Since so many published transcriptions and the resulting translations are inaccurate, all translations in this book are based, whenever possible, on the autographs or photocopies of them. When autographs of Verdi's draft and the actual letter were available, the final text of the letter was used. In the translation of Verdi's letters I have tried to maintain his distinctive, very simple, and straightforward style, which contrasts strikingly with the Victorian flavor of some of his contemporaries' correspondence. The speech of a man who was proud to remain a peasant to the end of his days must not be edited or romanticized. By the same token, neither Muzio's clumsy style nor Teresa Stolz's unsophisticated writing has been improved. To the best of my knowledge this is the first English translation of the fourteen documents in this collection. Eight are published for the first time. Brief as they are, the biographical notes on the correspondents provide some hitherto unknown details. Discrepancies in dates and conjectural dates given by various biographies and dictionaries caused problems and I was amazed to learn how little is known about even such prominent personalities as Count Opprandino Arrivabene, Draneht Bey, and Giuseppe Piroli, who deserve to be remembered. The word \"missing,\" which occurs with unfortunate frequency in my notes, indicates that a letter or document is, to the best of my knowledge, unavailable at this time. Many of these letters and documents may one day be discovered. The absence of the many letters Ghislanzoni wrote to Verdi during their collaboration and the severe gaps in the Ricordi letters to Verdi are particularly disturbing. But I am confident they are not lost. Dr. Gabriella Carrara Verdi assures me that Verdi destroyed all the musical sketches he jotted down for Aida like any others. It seems incredible, however, that none of the scenic designs for the first Italian productions of Aida are extant, and I\n\nxviii\n\nPREFACE\n\nwould welcome learning the location of such and any other material not included here. This volume is as complete as I have been able to make it at this time; but it is by no means exhaustive and it invites further research. The purpose of this project hardly needs to be stressed. Glimpses that letters and documents such as these afford into the minds and workshops of the masters deepen our understanding of their creations. But unfortunately there is little concern and respect for the specific wishes of the authors. It is difficult, if not impossible, to destroy the power of operas like Carmen, Tosca, and Aida, even in the most mediocre or misguided performances. The popularity of such works is their greatest enemy. In 1969, for instance, when I staged Aida at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples and asked for the Chorus of Ethiopian Prisoners that is clearly marked in the score, I was informed they had always been eliminated and substituted with supers — si è sempre fatto così. The late Wieland Wagner, one of the most gifted and controversial stage directors of our age, decided that the triumphal scene in Aida should take place at night (1961 Deutsche Oper Berlin program and Goléa, Gespräche mit Wieland Wagner, pp. 57-63). Had Verdi been alive, he might have taken Wieland Wagner to court. Those who consider Verdi bullheaded or old-fashioned because he fought for integrity in the performance of his works and forbade the eccentricities to which they and others are subjected today should be reminded of some of Hofmannsthal's letters to Strauss (Strauss and Schuh, eds.), of Pfitzner's Werk und Wiedergabe, or, more recently, of Stravinsky's writings. I had the honor to be associated with Stravinsky and remember his outburst \"I h-h-ate interpretation!\" (Horgan, Encounters with Stravinsky, p. 116). Toscanini and my family were admired for their research and Werktreue, which, far from being conventional or pedantic, resulted in surprising musical and dramatic effects. Yet although we wish we could hear Aida as it sounded under Verdi's baton, few of us would care for the melodramatic style in which the opera was visually produced at that time. Giulio Ricordi's exhaustive production book may therefore be of relatively little value to us, since many of his stage directions are now taken as much for granted as Felix Mottl's annotations in Wagner's scores. Nevertheless Ricordi's disposizioni sceniche for Aida — as well as for Otello — remain professional documents with which every conscientious artist should be acquainted. In the pages that follow it is Verdi who consistently holds the reader's attention. I do not indulge in hero worship of him at the expense of Mariette and Du Locle, whose vital roles in the creation of Aida come to life in these letters and documents. But I feel today, as Franz Werfel (Werfel and Stefan, Verdi: The Man in His Letters, p. 79) felt fifty years ago, that \"at such a moment as this,\" in which \"vulgar disbelief in all higher levels of existence is rising in a torrent, a life full of truth and without illusions, like that of the poet\n\nPREFACE\n\nxix\n\nand farmer Giuseppe Verdi, seems a very star in the murk. Especially the young artist, the musician, writer, singer, actor, who is at the beginning of his career, can find in Verdi's letters, if he knows how to read them aright, mysterious sources of strength like those of a radium bath.\" Indiana University, 1976\n\nHans Busch\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nPERMISSIONS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe story of my struggle to obtain permission for the publication of previously published as well as unpublished materials from all over the world could constitute a book. Although many individuals and institutions seemed to consider them an unnecessary formality or a simple matter of scholarly courtesy, questions arose in some cases, causing legal consultations, tedious world-wide correspondence, and delays. When publication of some of the more interesting pages in this volume was threatened, the former Dean of Faculties at Indiana University, Vice Chancellor Henry H. H. Remak, arranged a meeting with Professors Arghyrios A. Fatouros and Maurice J. Holland of our Law School, whose solid information and advice solved the problem. Indiana University Chancellor Herman B Wells's personal introduction to His Excellency Dr. Ashraf Ghorbal, the Ambassador of the United Arab Republic of Egypt in Washington, D.C., was also deeply appreciated at that moment of crisis. Indiana University's Vice President Robert M. O'Neil, an authority on copyright law, offered exceptionally careful and cautious advice. Dr. David Fenske, the head of our Music Library, gave much of his time in helping me to understand and follow it. Caught within the intricacies of complex international copyright situations, I once again appealed to my great, old friend Avv. Alfredo Amman in Milan. His colleague, Avv. Giorgio Jarach, a specialist in Italian copyright law, provided clear and definite answers which were confirmed by the appropriate Italian agency, the Società Italiana degli Autori ed Editori in Rome. The three major owners of thus far unpublished autographs — Dr. Alberto Carrara Verdi and family at St. Agata, G. Ricordi & C. in Milan, and M. Peter Emmanuel Zervudachi in Vevey — authorized publication of the autographs in my translation, as have the other owners. All sources are identified in xxi\n\nxxii\n\nPERMISSIONS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nthe List of the Letters and the Key to the Abbreviations. All quotations in notes and footnotes were authorized by the authors and/or their respective publishers. I thank all those, dead or alive, named or unnamed, who have promoted my labors. In addition to the friends, colleagues, and institutions already mentioned, I received advice and assistance in varying degrees from Hans Apel, Willi Apel, Barbara Baugh, Claudette Beaulieu, Teresita Beretta, Sir Rudolf Bing, Beverly M.

Walter Kaufmann, Tibor Kozma, and Oskar Seidlin, three friends and distinguished colleagues at Indiana University, contributed essential suggestions, and I am particularly grateful to Walter Kaufmann for photographing the music examples and diagrams in Verdi's and Giulio Ricordi's letters. Close ties of friendship to J. Hellmut Freund of the S. Fischer Verlag in Frankfurt inspired this project from its inception. As a frequent collaborator and honest critic my wife has stood by me in this endeavor beyond words of gratitude. Last, but not least, I want to thank Alexander Graham Bell for having sufficiently delayed his invention of the telephone to enrich us with the gift of this correspondence. The inventors of the Xerox machine, however, seriously merit my appreciation, for without their revolutionary product this volume could not have materialized.\n\nEDITORIAL NOTES\n\nSince this volume focuses on the opera Aida, it seemed advisable to make some editorial omissions in the letters and documents. But the meaning is not distorted by any of these omissions, which are indicated by bracketed ellipses [. . .]. Letterheads indicating the positions and addresses of the senders — such as Camille Du Locle's Théàtre Imperial de 1'Opéra-Comique, Cabinet du Directeur — are excluded, and dates and salutations of the letters are given in a uniform style. A comma follows all salutations, and Verdi's frequent abbreviations, such as C. for Caro or G. for Giulio, do not appear in the translations. The typically formal closings of all the letters are almost always omitted. (Verdi frequently ended his letters with addio, addio, and without exception, even when writing to his most intimate friends, signed himself G. Verdi.) Dates within editorial brackets do not appear on the autograph but were indicated either by a postmark on the envelope or by other circumstances. Undated letters — some spuriously dated by Luzio and others — are placed where they seem logically to belong. In formal letters, or when addressing strangers, Verdi sometimes dated his letters at nearby Busseto rather than at St. Agata. During the years of the Aida correspondence, Verdi's homes were at St. Agata and in Genoa. We may assume, therefore, that any letter he addressed from Busseto during that period was actually written at St. Agata. After careful consideration I decided against a strict adherence to the haphazard and inconsistent original punctuation, particularly in Verdi's letters and in his quotations from Italian texts. Whenever authentic paragraphing could be reliably established from the autographs, or assumed from the transcriptions, it was maintained in translation. In a few instances one or several dashes after a period in an Italian letter suggested the beginning of a new paragraph in the English text. xxiii\n\nxxiv\n\nE D I T O R I A L NOTES\n\nNone of the poetry quoted by Verdi, Ghislanzoni, and others is translated. For the sake of clarity and consistency the names of the characters in Aida, though often abbreviated in the original letters and documents, are spelled out and capitalized in the translation of the letters. In the autographs (of Verdi's letters in particular) underlining was used for emphasis, for foreign words, and for quotations. In this translation, most foreign words are italicized and underlining indicates emphasis. In a few instances when a foreign word seemed to have been underlined for emphasis, the word is italicized and underlined. Exceptions to the italicizing of foreign words are words that are frequently used in English, such as libretto or cello (plurals are anglicized as librettos and cellos) which appear in roman. Some French words underlined in the Italian letters are translated and, therefore, not underlined. An exception is the French term mise-en-scène, which refers to all but the musical elements of theatrical production. Since an equivalent term does not exist in English — \"stage direction\" does not denote all the visual and technical components implied by mise-en-scene — I use the French term. Verdi used it in his letters rather than the Italian messa in scena. Frequent and sometimes consistent misspelling of names, such as Verdi's misspelling of Draneht as Draneth or of Waldmann as Waldman, Valdman, or Waldaman, of Mendelssohn, Schumann, and Wagner, are corrected except in a few instances, where sic is used. In the creative development of Aida, the spelling of the names of some characters underwent a few changes — from Rhadamés or Radamés to Radames, Ramphis or Rhamphis to Ramfis, and Amounasro or Amunasro to Amonasro. The various spellings appear in the translated documents but are eliminated in the letters. To avoid confusion caused by the fact that at the time of their association with Aida both Auguste Mariette and Paul Draneht had the Turkish title Bey, I have, with all due respect, stripped them of this honor. All female singers are consistently referred to as la Stolz, la Waldmann, etc., as they are in most of the Italian correspondence. Similarly the Scala Opera House or Teatro alia Scala in Milan is referred to as La Scala. In keeping with the original correspondence, the French and Italian names of opera houses, such as OpéraComique, Théâtre-Lyrique, Teatro Fenice, Teatro San Carlo, are not translated; but the Théàtre Italien or Théàtre des Italiens in Paris, called Teatro Italiano by Verdi, is referred to as the Italian Theatre in the translation. I follow Verdi's spellings of St. Agata and St. Donnino. Biographical notes are provided for all major correspondents. When the years of birth and death of other persons mentioned in the letters could be credibly ascertained, they are given in parentheses in the notes. In a few instances, however, such dates could not be obtained. Since the Franco-Prussian War was actually a war in which all the German\n\nE D I T O R I A L NOTES\n\nxxv\n\nstates were allied with Prussia, the Germans rather than the Prussians are mentioned in the notes pertaining to that war. In the lists of the letters and documents, asterisks indicate, to the best of my knowledge, first publications. The language and location of the autographs I translated are given in the List of the Letters. Whenever autographs were unavailable, I translated from the Italian and French publications, which are referred to in parentheses. I also cite the English translations of Verdi letters that appear in the Werfel-Stefan and Charles Osborne books, in The Musical Quarterly, and in Opera News.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nABBREVIATIONS\n\nAutographs LANGUAGES\n\nIt.

Giuseppe Verdi to Domenico Morel\n\n\"This opera is certainly not one of my worst,\" Verdi wrote 2 with admirable modesty following the European premiere of Aida at La Scala in 1872. A hundred years later this noble work is still one of Verdi's greatest gifts to all whose lives are enriched by his art. Thomas Mann observed that some humans have an instinctive sense of their own longevity and, therefore, take more time for their achievements than their less fortunate fellows. Certainly Verdi took a remarkably long time to achieve artistic maturity. His early works are permeated with the characteristics of the so-called bel canto opera — in which Rossini, Bellini, and Donizetti all too often did not care to remember Mozart's rich orchestration, reduced the libretto to providing a pretext for beautiful melodies, and the singer to a laryngal athlete. From these restricted beginnings, Verdi — aware of the dramatic potential of opera and the growth of orchestral polyphony in his time — gradually developed his distinctive style. Aida represents this fulfillment and the first step toward the solitary heights of Otello and Falstaff. The correspondence concerning Aida extends from 1868 to 1891. In its early stages it kept the mails and wires — which functioned with enviable speed and dependability in those days — very busy between St. Agata or Genoa, and Paris, Cairo, Milan, or a little village above Lake Como. After the initial productions of Aida in Cairo, Milan, Parma, Padua, and Naples, the letters pertaining to the opera were not as frequent, since Verdi was then occupied with the Requiem and, later with Otello and Falstaff. None of his works, however, evoked as much correspondence over as many years. A drama unfolds in the following pages which at times seems like a very human comedy fraught with emotions and errors. Set against a background of li\n\nHiINTRODUCTIO politics and backstage intrigues of every conceivable kind, a large cast o characters revolves around Verdi, who stands fast, neither proud nor humble, as he had said of himself. 3 Yet even he, in rare instances, gives in to compromise and has no other choice but to join the risata final of his ownFalstaff. Five major personalities, in addition to Verdi, emerge as the principals and dominate the action of the drama at various times: Auguste Mariette, Camille Du Locle, Antonio Ghislanzoni, Paul Draneht, and Giulio Ricordi. They enter and leave the stage at given times, but the presence of Giulio Ricordi is always felt. Several no less prominent dramatis personae — particularly Verdi's wife, Giuseppina, the conductor Franco Faccio, and the singers Teresa Stolz and Maria Waldmann — play active roles in certain scenes; and some of Verdi's closest friends, although not always directly involved with the action, receive his meditations on the pathos of life and death and on the events of his times. The rest of the cast is made up of a variety of individuals, most in pursuit of selfish interests and ambitions. The remarkable series of events begins in Egypt in 1868 and reaches a climax with the European premiere of Aida in Milan in 1872, a glorious summit with Verdi's final victory at the Paris Opera in 1880, and a tranquil end in his winter quarters at Genoa in 1891. In a letter to the conductor Michael Costa dated 6 July 1867 4, Verdi revealed his state of mind at a critical time in his life: \"I had planned to write you sooner, in order to thank you for the great care given the production of Don Carlos in London, but tragic family circumstances5 prevented me from doing so. You will probably be surprised that I am writing you a letter, for the first time in so many years, when I should have written you several times for my other productions. But at that time, in the midst of my career, I refrained from doing so because I feared a letter of sincere admiration for you might be confused with the kind that many others usually write, scattering incense to obtain assistance and protection. Now that this career has ended, or almost, such doubts melt away, and this perhaps mistaken pride of mine is gone. You, whom I know to be as great an artist as a man of upstanding character, will understand this pride and will not be shocked by it.\" \"Now that this career has ended, or almost . . . \" How amazing that Giuseppe Verdi could write such words three summers before he embarked on Aida and twenty-five years before he finished Falstaff! When he wrote that letter to Costa, four months after the ill-fated premiere of Don Carlos in Paris, Verdi was fifty-four years old. The objections of the Catholic Church, as represented by the Spanish-born Empress Eugenie, and other circumstances contributed to the unfavorable reception at the Opera, and Verdi was even accused of imitating Richard Wagner. He never wrote for the Opera in Paris again. And he had ample reason to despise the theatre per se, where he had\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nliii\n\nknown more than his share of frustrations and humiliations. His \"years on the galleys,\" when he had to compose for a living, were past. Despite the bitter experience of Don Carlos in Paris, Verdi stood at the height of a firmly established career, a wealthy and independent man, reluctant to involve himself in the theatre any longer, and ready to retire to his farm for the rest of his days. He had earned his privacy. His pride and his humility — to which he himself would not admit — made him prefer talking to his trees at St. Agata to showing himself in public. At work in his fields he could even forget the maledetta musica — a curse he had uttered in a letter to Leon Escudier on 8 February 1856.6 What made him return to the stage? La Forza del Destino, it seems, played a decisive role in the composer's destiny. After the debacle of Don Carlos at the Opera, Verdi appeared to be determined to settle a score and set out to prove his point by personally supervising every phase and detail in the preparation of his revision of La Forza at La Scala. The success of this production, which opened on 27 February 1869, must have restored his faith in the ultimate victory of his unflinching battle for integrity and perfection in all elements of the musical drama. The Leonora of this performance, Teresa Stolz, a thirty-five-year-old soprano from Bohemia, would be Verdi's first Aida in the same opera house and an intimate friend until his death. Formerly she had lived with Verdi's close friend, the conductor Angelo Mariani, to whom she was engaged to be married. In The Man Verdi Frank Walker — more thoroughly and impartially than any other biographer — investigates the sad and complicated story of Verdi's break with Mariani, his later infatuation with Teresa Stolz, and his wife's reactions to this relationship. Also complicated and confusing were Italy's manifold political struggles — from the country's Risorgimento to the end of the Church State on 20 September 1870 and the proclamation of Rome as the capital of the finally united kingdom under Victor Emanuel II. On the European scene of the time the destinies of Italy and France were largely interdependent. When the Second Empire collapsed after France's defeat at Sedan in 1870 and more bloodshed followed in a civil war, no one could have been more keenly and more passionately afflicted than Giuseppe Verdi, who rose from Italian patriot to citizen of the world. A thoroughly practical and modern man, rather than the stereotype of a romantic genius, he was fully aware of scientific and technical progress, which he applied to his farm. The war in France was to postpone the world premiere of Aida in Cairo and, consequently, the European premiere at La Scala. POT Aida, however, this tragedy turned out to be a blessing, because it enabled Verdi to make improvements in the score, to orchestrate it with leisure, and to plan its production with care. In the midst of these delays he was urged to succeed Saverio\n\nliv\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMercadante as the director of the conservatory in Naples, the most reputable in Italy. Realizing that theory and academic life were not for him, he refused. But later he reluctantly agreed to preside over a government commission established for the reform of the conservatories and professional orchestras. Verdi did not like to leave his farm at St. Agata, although he was attracted to the circle of congenial friends and other charms that a city like Naples had to offer. He was a peasant of the North. And if he left his native soil of the Po Valley in the cold and foggy winter for a comfortable apartment in Genoa, he did so mainly, if not solely, for the sake of his wife. Except for occasional vacations in Paris, Cauterets (a spa in the Pyrenees), Tabiano (a spa in the Appenine hills not far from St. Agata), and, later, in Montecatini, most of his travels were dictated by professional considerations and were limited to cities in Italy and to Paris, London, St. Petersburg, Madrid, Vienna, and Cologne. A positive aspect of the Don Carlos premiere in Paris was Verdi's friendship with Camille Du Locle who collaborated on the French libretto for the opera. About to become co-director of the Opéra-Comique in July 1870, Du Locle tried to persuade Verdi to write for his theatre. It was not meant to be, but Aida was born in the meantime. Some phases of the opera's genesis are still shrouded in mystery. The correspondence proves, however, that Du Locle was instrumental in the realization of unusual ideas and actions by two other key figures: Ismail Pasha, the Khedive and Viceroy of Egypt, who remained remote and lofty behind the walls of his exotic palace in Cairo or on the Nile with his harem; and the eminent French Egyptologist, Auguste Mariette, who created the original plot, sets, and costumes. Like his friend Du Locle, Mariette was a dreamer, and he was easily pushed aside by the powerful intendant Paul Draneht, who bought prima donnas and milk cows for the Khedive in Europe. Their letters tell much of the story. But two recent publications 7 inform us of all that is known about the sad circumstances that, in 1876, caused Verdi to initiate legal procedures against Du Locle to secure repayment of a substantial loan. For the Khedive's Italian opera house in Cairo, built by Italian architects and inaugurated in 1869 by an Italian company, Verdi wanted to write an Italian opera. For this reason he asked Antonio Ghislanzoni to furnish Italian lyrics based on Mariette's original French outline and Du Locle's scenario. As Verdi's letters to Ghislanzoni reveal, a great deal more had to be done in the four months of their collaboration. The letters and documents telling the story of this masterwork should not only set some records straight but also open a few new vistas. The correspondence begins with a few lines from Verdi to Du Locle at a time when the veteran composer could not have imagined the consequences of his friend's voyage to Egypt with Auguste Mariette as his guide.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIv\n\nNOTES 1.

I am writing to you immediately in Paris so that if you arrive on the 20th, as you say you will, this letter of mine may be among the first to reach you; let me cordially take your hand and tell you welcome home. When we see each other, you must describe all the events of your voyage, the wonders you have seen, and the beauty and ugliness of a country which once had a greatness and a civilization I have never been able to admire. [. . .] 1. Auguste Mariette had collected material for a short story — La Fiancee du Nil — during an archaeological trip through Upper Egypt in 1866. Quite possibly during Mariette's visit to Paris for the Exposition in 1867 and during Camille Du Locle's voyage to Egypt in 1868, the two discussed this plot for the operatic stage. See Verdi's letter to Giulio Ricordi of 25 June 1870, Document I, and Ursula Giinther, \"Zur Entstehung von Verdis Aida,\" Studi Musicali (Firenze: Leo S. Olschki Editore, 1973), Anno II, n. 1 pp. 15-71.\n\nVerdi to Paul Draneht1 Genoa, 9 August 1869 Monsieur le Bey, I am aware that a new theatre will be opened in Cairo on the solemn occasion which will celebrate the cut through the Isthmus of Suez. Although I deeply appreciate that you, Monsieur le Bey, wanted to give me the honor of writing a hymn to mark the date of the opening, I regret that I must decline this honor, because of the number of my current activities and because it is not my custom to compose occasional pieces. [. . .] 1. Paul Draneht, general manager of the Cairo Opera, whose original letter to Verdi is missing. This response was drafted in French by Verdi's wife, Giuseppina.\n\n3\n\n4\n\nLETTERS\n\nVerdi to Camille Du Lode 1 Genoa, 8 December 1869 [. . .] Helas, it is neither the labor of writing an opera nor the judgment of the Parisian public that holds me back but rather the certainty of not being able to have my music performed in Paris the way I want it. It is quite singular that an author must always see his ideas frustrated and his conceptions distorted! In your opera houses — I say this without the slightest sarcasm — there are too many know-it-alls! Everyone wants to judge according to their own ideas, their own tastes, and, what is worse, according to a system, without taking into account the character and individuality of the author. Everyone wants to express an opinion, to voice a doubt; and the author who lives in that atmosphere of doubt for any length of time cannot help but be somewhat shaken in his convictions and end up revising, adjusting, or, to put it more precisely, ruining his work. In this way one ultimately finds in one's hands not a unified opera but a mosaic; and beautiful as it may be, it is still a mosaic. You will argue that the Opera has produced a string of masterpieces in this manner. You may call them masterpieces all you want, but permit me to say that they would be much more perfect if the patchwork and the adjustments were not felt all the time. Certainly no one will deny genius to Rossini. Nevertheless, in spite of all his genius, in Guillaume Tell one detects this fatal atmosphere of the Opera; and several times, although less frequently than with other authors, one feels that there is too much here, too little there, and that the musical flow is not as free and secure as in the Barbiere. By this I don't mean to disapprove of what you people do; I only mean to tell you that it is absolutely impossible for me to subject myself again to the Caudine Yokes2 of your theatres, when I know that a true success is not possible for me unless I write as I feel, free from any influence and without considering that I am writing for Paris rather than for the world of the moon. Furthermore, the artists would have to sing not in their fashion but in mine; the entire company, \"which also in Paris has a great deal of ability,\" 3 should have just as much good will; everything should depend on me, after all, and only one will should dominate everything: my own. This may seem somewhat tyrannical; perhaps it is. But if the work is unified, the idea is ONE, and everything must converge to form this ONE. Perhaps you will say that nothing bars the way to obtaining all this in Paris. No. In Italy one can have it, at least I always can; in France, no. If, for example, I present myself in the foyer of an Italian theatre with a new opera, no one dares express an opinion of it, or a judgment, before having understood it well; and no one ever ventures ridiculous questions. They respect the work and the author, and they let the public decide. In the foyer of the Opera, on the contrary, after four chords they whisper all over the\n\nLETTERS\n\n5\n\nplace: \"Ola, ce n'estpas bon . . . c'est commun . . . c'est n'estpas de bon gout . . . ca n'irapas a Paris!\" What do such poor words as commun . . . bon gout . . . Paris mean, if you are dealing with a work of art that must be universal! The conclusion of all this is that I am not a composer for Paris. I do not know if I have the talent, but I do know that my ideas in matters of art are quite different from yours. I believe in inspiration, you in workmanship. I am willing to discuss your criterion, but I need the enthusiasm you lack in feeling and in judging. I want art in any of its manifestations, not the arrangement, the artifice, and the system that you prefer. Am I wrong? Am I right? However it may be, I am right in saying that my ideas are quite different from yours; and I add that my backbone isn't as flexible as those of many others, so that I shall not yield and deny my convictions, which are most profourid and deeply rooted. Also, I would very much regret writing an opera for you, my dear Du Locle, which you would perhaps have to put aside after one or two dozen performances, as Perrin4 did with Don Carlos. If I were some twenty years younger, I would tell you: \"Let's see if, later, your theatrical affairs take a turn and conform more with my ideas.\" But time is passing rapidly, and for now it's impossible to understand each other, unless something unforeseen happens, which I cannot imagine. If you should come here, as you have caused my wife to hope, we shall speak further of this and at length; 5 if you don't come, it's probable that I'll make my way to Paris at the end of February.6 If you should come to Genoa, we could no longer offer you ravioli because we no longer have our Genoese cook; but at any rate, you won't die of hunger, and — this much is certain — you will find two friends who are very fond of you and to whom your presence will be the greatest gift. [. . .] 1. On 1 November 1869, before the opening of the Suez Canal on 17 November 1869, the theatre in Cairo was inaugurated with a performance of Verdi's Rigoletto, conducted by Emanuele Muzio, the composer's former student and close friend. At the same time Du Locle was pleading with Verdi to write another opera for Paris. At the Opera, Verdi's Jerusalem (a revision of / Lombardi alia Prima Crociata) had been premiered in 1847, Les Vepres Siciliennes in 1855, and Don Carlos in 1867. At the Theatre-Lyrique Verdi's second version of Macbeth had been produced in 1865. 2. At the Caudine Forks, two narrow passes in the southern Apennines, the Roman army was defeated by the Samnites in 321 B.C. and suffered the humiliation of having to file below a yoke. 3. Verdi seems to quote from a missing letter Du Locle had written him. 4. Emile Perrin, Director of the Opera. 5. On Christmas Eve 1869, Verdi wrote to Du Locle: \"You will find me at the port of Genoa, where I shall receive you with open arms.\" (Autograph: Bibliotheque de 1'Opera, Paris) Thus we may assume that Du Locle arrived in Genoa (via Marseilles or Nice) before the end of the year 1869. During this visit Du Locle, quite possibly, brought Verdi an invitation to write an opera for Egypt. See Verdi's letter to Giulio Ricordi of 25 June 1870 and Giinther, p. 24. 6. In spite of Du Locle's visit in Genoa, Verdi and his wife went to Paris, but not until 26 March 1870. See Verdi's letter to Du Locle on the same date.\n\n6\n\nLETTERS\n\nEmanuele Muzio to Giulio Ricordi1 Cairo, 7 January 1870 Dearest friend, [. . .] Here they change their minds from one moment to the next. [. . .] The season proceeds very well, but since H.H. 2 has left for Upper Egypt, taking his harem along, the theatre is not very much frequented; he will be back in eight days, and so we shall see the theatre repopulated. On New Year's Eve we had a fire in the theatre, right in the clock,3 which was suddenly all aflame. The firemen, pumps, and water arrived at once; otherwise the fire would have spread to the roof and destroyed the whole theatre.4 The fright of the audience, artists, choristers, and ballet is not easily described. Scared wives and husbands rushed to the stage; but about an hour later the performance was resumed, and it ended before empty seats because there was no audience left. 1. Verdi's music publisher in Milan. 2. Abbreviation for His Highness, the Viceroy of Egypt. Mariette's reference in French is S.A. for Son Altesse. At this time the Viceroy was Ismail Pasha, who was born in Cairo on 31 December 1830 and on whom the Sultan of Turkey bestowed the title Khedive, i.e., August, in 1869. The son of Ibrahim Pasha (an adventurous Turkish potentate, warrior, and statesman) and the nephew of Said Pasha (who ruled Egypt from 1843 to 1863), Ismail was educated in Paris. On his return to Egypt in 1849 he was entrusted by his uncle with important missions to the Pope, to Napoleon III, and to the Sultan of Turkey. In 1861 he led an army of 14,000 men to suppress an insurgence of slaves in the Sudan. This recurring hostility with the Ethiopians may have contributed to his decision to have the story of Aida made into an opera. At the death of Said Pasha on 18 January 1863 Ismail Pasha became his uncle's successor as Viceroy, with fourteen wives and countless concubines. As an autocrat with extravagant ideas and ambitious plans for the progress of his country, he modernized and enlarged commerce and industry, reformed and augmented Egypt's political administration, its courts, schools, and universities, and brought his country to the attention of the world with the inauguration of the Suez Canal. He assisted the eminent Egyptologist Auguste Mariette in founding and directing a museum for the preservation of Egyptian antiquity; and under his direct orders the Cairo Opera was built by Italian architects in only six months. \"My country is no longer in Africa,\" he once said. \"I have made it part of Europe.\" The prominent critic Filippo Filippi, in Musica e Musicisti (Milano: Libreria Editrice G. Brigola, 1876), pp. 378-80, describes Ismail Pasha as \"a small man, chubby like all Turks, dragging his feet slightly when he walks. His face is alert, gentle, with tiny eyes which do not stare, but speak volumes. . . . He spoke with animation about Italian music, the Cairo theatre, and the artists, saying very sensible things. He referred to Verdi with pride, as an inferior speaking of a superior, with unlimited deference and gratitude.\" Under Ismail's reign, the Egyptian cotton market profited considerably as a result of the American Civil War; and during the Franco-Prussian War, Egypt was to remain neutral. Ismail's love of splendor and luxury, however, and his ambitious though irresponsible undertakings were to destroy the economy of his country. In 1876 the European powers intervened in the affairs of the bankrupt nation by putting Egypt under joint French and British control. On 26 June 1879 Ismail Pasha was forced to abdicate; and four days later he sailed with his harem to Naples, where the King of Italy offered him residence. The former Khedive was permitted to end his days in\n\nLETTERS\n\n7\n\nConstantinople, where he died on 2 March 1895. In spite of his abdication, Ismail was interred in Cairo. 3. The clock above the proscenium, a common feature in Italian theatres. 4. One hundred and one years later, on 28 October 1971, the Cairo theatre was totally destroyed by fire.\n\nVerdi to Camille Du Lode Genoa, 23 January 1870 Most Wretched Du Locle! You have forgotten to send me Wagner's literary writings. You know that I also want to acquaint myself with this side [of the man], and so I ask you to do what you haven't done. [. . .] I continue to think that Nero might be a subject for a grand opera, done in my own way, of course. It would thus be impossible at the Opera but most possible here. [. . .]\n\nVerdi to Giulio Ricordi [Genoa,] 3 February [1870] [. . .] In writing an opera it is not the labor of composition that burdens me; it is the difficulty of finding a subject to my liking, a poet to my liking, and a performance to my liking that holds me back! * And, on the other hand, where to write? In France? Poor me! Every time I have set foot in those theatres I have had a fever. I don't know what would happen now that I am more difficult. [. . .] 1. As early as 1 January 1853 Verdi had written to his friend Cesare De Sanctis"
