He is Music Director of the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma and he holds the same position at the Orchestra Mozart. He is also Artistic Advisor of the Mahler Chamber Orchestra.\n\nHe was Chief Conductor of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam and he previously held prestigious roles at musical institutions like the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the Orchestre National de France, the Royal Opera House of London, the Teatro Comunale di Bologna, and Zurich’s Opernhaus. The Berliner Philharmoniker, the Wiener Philharmoniker, the Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks, and the Orchestra Filarmonica della Scala are just a few of the renowned symphonic institutions he works with.\n\nSome of the numerous and important new productions he has conducted include the Falstaff staged by Carsen (in London, Milan, and Amsterdam); the Parsifal staged by Herheim opening the 2008 Bayreuther Festspiele (one of the very few Italian conductors to have been invited to the Wagnerian festival); the Parsifal staged by Girard at the Metropolitan Opera in New York; four operas at the Salzburger Festspiele (Elektra, La bohème, Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, Il Trovatore).\n\nHe conducted two Milan's Teatro alla Scala season openings: La Traviata in 2013 and Don Carlo in 2008. From 2016 he opened every year the Opera di Roma season with Tristan und Isolde, La damnation de Faust, Rigoletto, Les Vêpres Siciliennes, and Il barbiere di Siviglia; in 2020 he also conducted in Rome a new Rigoletto at the Circo Massimo, I Capuleti e i Montecchi and Zaide at the Teatro Costanzi, and concerts with the Orchestra Sinfonica Nazionale della Rai in Turin.\n\nAt the beginning of 2021 he returned on the podium of the Berliner Philharmoniker; then he will conduct a new production of La traviata at the Opera di Roma and concerts leading the Mahler Chamber Orchestra, the Staatskapelle Dresden, the Orchestre National de France, the GUSTAV MAHLER JUGENDORCHESTER, the Dresdner Festspielorchester, and the Münchner Philharmoniker.\n\nDaniele Gatti was awarded the Premio “Franco Abbiati” from Italian music critics as best conductor in 2015, and in 2016 he was awarded the Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur from the French Republic for his work as Musical Director of the Orchestre National de France. He has recorded under Sony Classical, RCO Live and C Major.\n\nDaniele Gatti appears with the GUSTAV MAHLER JUGENDORCHESTER already for the third time after 1998 and 2012.\n\nMarco Borggreve"
