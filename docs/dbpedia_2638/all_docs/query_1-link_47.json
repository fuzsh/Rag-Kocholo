        "text": "CHRISTIAN ABBIATI is likely to get an extension, Amelia will be replaced by Agazzi and Gabriel could leave to Catania.\n\nThe season ends in two days and Milan already have some ideas regarding the next year. Even though the position of the coach is unclear, Adriano Galliani knows what he’s going to do with the players whose contract expire on June 30 2014.\n\nMilan have three goalkeepers with expiring contracts and while Ferdinando Coppola, who hasn’t played even a second this season, could be on his way and perhaps retire, first choice Christian Abbiati looks set to stay for an additional year.\n\nBerlusconi: “Seedorf wasn’t a mistake, he could stay”\n\nHachim Mastour promoted to the first team\n\nAccording to today’s edition of La Gazzetta dello Sport, Abbiati will stay at Milan and he has an agreement in principle about a renewal. Abbiati recently said that this season has been “one of the worst” he has had in his 13 Milan seasons. Abbiati is 36-years-old and the Rossoneri still consider him a reliable goalkeeper and also an important dressing room figure.\n\nSecond choice Marco Amelia is ready to leave the club and his agent has said this week that they’re not expecting an extension. “He experienced the season as a player towards the end of his contract and he knows Milan are very unlikely to renew,” agent Franco Zavaglia said. “We are looking to find a solution. It is natural to think about future prospects, because so far no meeting has been scheduled, no negotiations, so we just have to pack our bags. Unfortunately these are the sensations we are getting and they can’t just take us for a ride. It is a difficult moment for the club, so we can only adapt.\n\n“Torino and Cagliari were interested in January, but now we have to get back to work to find him the right club.” Michael Agazzi is sure to arrive this summer to replace Amelia and compete with Abbiati; Gabriel, 21, could join Catania on loan."
