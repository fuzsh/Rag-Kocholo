The presence in the volume’s title of Pierre Bourdieu, the leading cultural sociologist of the late twentieth century, signals the editors’ intention to synthesize recent advances in social science with recent advances in musicological and other scholarship on opera. Through a focus on opera in Italy and France, the contributors to the volume draw on their respective disciplines both to expand our knowledge of opera’s history and to demonstrate the kinds of contributions that stand to be made by different disciplines to the study of opera. The volume is divided into three sections, each of which is preceded by a concise and informative introduction explaining how the chapters in that section contribute to our understanding of opera. v i c to r i a j o h n s on is Assistant Professor of Organizational Studies at the University of Michigan. ja n e f. f u lc h e r is Professor of Music (Musicology) at Indiana University. t h o m a s e rt m a n is Associate Professor of Sociology at New York University.\n\nCAMBRIDGE STUDIES IN OPERA Series editor: Arthur Groos, Cornell University\n\nVolumes for Cambridge Studies in Opera explore the cultural, political and social influences of the genre. As a cultural art form, opera is not produced in a vacuum. Rather, it is influenced, whether directly or in more subtle ways, by its social and political environment. In turn, opera leaves its mark on society and contributes to shaping the cultural climate. Studies to be included in the series will look at these various relationships including the politics and economics of opera, the operatic representation of women or the singers who portrayed them, the history of opera as theatre, and the evolution of the opera house.

I don’t mean simply that it is endlessly productive of arguments, though that is true. Opera fans debate favorite performances, praise or decry new productions in extravagant terms, and ally themselves passionately with Mozart or Verdi. Opera companies are equally ripe with controversy, dubious over conductors who seek too much authority, contentious about roles and repertory. Opera critics delight in provoking clashes over whether celebrity singers are past their prime, whether theatrical spectacle has triumphed regrettably over music, and whether restaging old favorites is driving out innovation. All these and other arguments are simply evidence that opera commands the passions of its varied participants. In the language of Pierre Bourdieu, it is a field of serious play to which they are committed. The controversies reflect artistic taste, but also relationships of art to audience, to money, and to social organization. And herein lie some contradictions that shape the field of opera as a field of careers and companies, not only compositions and performances; and a field embedded in several changing contexts as far beyond the opera hall as nationalist politics and globalization, changing media and class structure, and shifting structures of patronage. This book reflects the interest of opera as a social phenomenon. This is an interest that extends beyond aesthetic evaluations and the engagements of fans, critics, or performers. But social studies of culture need not ignore aesthetics and can contribute to the understanding of fans, critics, and performers. The chapters in this book are informed by serious understanding of opera as music and theatre even while they enrich such understanding by considering other dimensions and contexts of opera. The opera field, for example, is simultaneously structured by art and commerce: opera is expensive and yet ostensibly an art produced xxi\n\nxxii\n\nForeword\n\nfor art’s sake. Opera is an insider’s art yet closely attentive to box-office receipts. Its fans master mountains of detail, like baseball fans with their statistics, cricket fans with their histories. They volunteer as docents to be close to stars and opera houses. They listen to broadcasts preceded by pedantic prefaces. Yet its musical leaders and business managers alike curry contacts among patrons, hire publicists to reach beyond the cognoscenti, market their wares widely, and worry anxiously if single ticket sales don’t make up for any slip in pricey subscriptions. Carreras, Domingo, and Pavarotti are all wonderful tenors who have sung difficult roles with distinction, and that isn’t why they went on tour and recorded as the Three Tenors. In fact, opera companies and houses have long been business institutions.1 This is not an innovation in itself, though the forms of business organization have changed over opera’s history. The patronage of the Doge or the Medici has unsurprisingly given way to that of capitalist corporations. The rise of the middle class changed the pattern of ticket sales (and also the meaning of being an opera fan). Recordings now rival performance in the economy of opera. And of course these changes affect even the aesthetic content and experience of opera. The experience of listening, for example, is transformed by the availability of recordings; so too even the performers’ sense of pitch. And films of opera add still another dimension to this (and this hardly exhausts the range of interesting ways in which opera appears in film and has influenced the development of film and other genres).2 Art is sometimes seen (and artists sometimes portray their world) as the inverse of economic life. As Pierre Bourdieu famously wrote, however, the idea that the world of art is the economic world reversed reveals not the absence of strategic, even economic, interests in art but a systematic opposition between capacities to mobilize cultural and economic capital.3 It is not, in other words, that those with cultural distinction do not want more of it and thus deploy their resources strategically to secure it. Nor is it even that they don’t want cash. Neither is it the case that the rich have no need of strategies to secure cultural prestige or to pass their wealth on to their children by making\n\nForeword\n\nsure they gain intellectual credentials and the patina of artistic taste. It is the case, however, that cultural and economic capitals are distinct and are accumulated by contrasting strategies, even though ultimately it is crucial that each can be converted into the other. Moreover, for this to work it is also important that the nature of values be misrecognized – as though there is no culture in the economy and no material interest in culture. It is no accident that I have cited Pierre Bourdieu twice in just a few paragraphs. He was an important inspiration to the present project. Indeed, before his fatal illness intervened, Bourdieu planned to attend the conference on which the book is based and offer introductory remarks. He was and is much missed. His work has been influential nonetheless.4 Not least, it is important for elaborating an approach to the different “fields” of social life that stresses their differentiation from and relations to each other (and thus often boundary struggles); the importance of emotional commitment of participants to social fields and their capacities for practical action within them; the importance of struggle over resources and prestige within fields; and the organization of fields by the way they relate to the accumulation of capital (including not only on an axis of greater or lesser capital but also in terms of the differentiation of forms of capital). The idea of field is not simply a corrective to individualistic accounts of production. We should agree that “art worlds” require many more collaborators and participants than only the frontstage figures commonly credited with genius. But the notion of field goes further to posit a determinate relationship to a larger field of power and contestation – as opera is related to money and politics and social prestige. It posits an internal organization in terms of specific struggles for distinction (and possibly other “stakes”). And it is this which organizes ideals of purity, of art for art’s sake, and denigrations of mere journalists in relation to literature, mere decorators in relation to painting, popular music in relation to serious music (and more narrowly instrumental purity in relation to singing). Opera is at once a challenge to these ideals of aesthetic purity and a terrain of struggle over them:\n\nxxiii\n\nxxiv\n\nForeword\n\nPoetry is contrasted to the work of mere hack librettists; “true opera” is contrasted to operetta and musical drama; performers and scholars both take pains to distinguish themselves from fans (even while they rely on them). And the oppositions are reproduced in fractal images on a smaller scale: proper musicologists distinguish themselves from literary scholars poaching on operatic turf, and both sometimes from sociologists. These ideals, moreover, reflect not simply timeless truth but an organization of knowledge in the modern era through the practical struggles that form fields and construct their specific species of capital. Bourdieu stressed, in other words, the extent to which all of us in practical action shape trajectories through contradictory social pressures and opportunities. Like the innumerable operatic heroes and heroines (and sometimes comedic minor characters) who navigate seemingly improbable plots to conclusions that appear almost inevitable, we derive our identities and biographies from the ways in which both our origins and our actions – and those of others – situate us in relation to basic social contradictions. And so too opera itself has a history and social identity shaped by its often contradictory relations to its social context and organization conditions. It is “delightfully contradictory” as I said at the outset because it illuminates a great deal. Consider, for example, opera’s locations in relation to the class structure (or in Bourdieusian terms to the accumulation of different quantities of capital). Opera is impossible to place – or rather, it occupies multiple places at the same time and shifting ones through history and in different contexts. In the contemporary United States opera is often seen as the epitome of “high art” – a special taste requiring significant cultivation and economic as well as cultural capital (and indeed it has been among the last of the major performance arts to surrender the notion that audiences should dress formally). But it does not look so in Italy or Argentina. And in many settings seating – and (more often in earlier years) standing – arrangements offer striking indices of class relations. Opera is popular and high art at once, and a source of insight into the way the distinction itself is deployed both by social analysts and by aesthetes and consumers. Notoriously expensive to stage, opera is\n\nForeword\n\nparticularly dependent on patronage. Yet it is also successful enough at securing both patronage and paying customers to be less dependent on state subsidies than most forms of “classical” music. Opera is also interestingly contradictory in geopolitical terms. It is among the art forms with the strongest national traditions. These include aesthetic traditions, such as preferences in composers, differences in singing styles, greater or lesser emphases on spectacle, and patterns in popular plots and settings. Opera also figures in national political traditions in extra-aesthetic ways, however, as crowds at opera houses have reveled in a populist response to The Marriage of Figaro, found occasions to express contempt for unpopular ministers, and sparked influential riots. Yet at the same time, opera was a pioneer in globalization. Singers learned multiple languages and along with conductors and instrumentalists often moved from one nation to another. There is today a global operatic circuit traveled in different forms (and with different privileges) by stars, less famous performers, and indeed fans. I won’t go on. The point is simply that while there are virtues to social studies of all genres and fields of art, there are some sources of distinctive interest to opera.5 Just as internally the tensions among music, theatre, and poetry shape opera, so various other contradictions shape its relations to social contexts. As articles in this book reveal, the relation of opera to politics is rich and instructive. So are opera’s relations to economics and business, to transcultural relations, and to the social organization of cultural life more generally. At the same time, culture is communication and creativity and important for the ways in which it represents the rest of society. Opera is of interest not only for its institutional organization and its relation to other social fields but for its portrayal of social and political relationships. Operas variously evoke and comment on social life in specific cities and countries and in entire eras. As essays in the first part of this book detail, they reveal much about themes from empire to gender. But the role of operatic representations is not merely to represent; opera is not only a tool for historians looking for indices as to how eighteenth-century French or Italian people thought about\n\nxxv\n\nxxvi\n\nForeword\n\nempire or gender. Operas, because they were seen by so many people and because they offered “schemas” for grasping social relations, played a constitutive as well as a reflective role. The way “the people” were portrayed on the operatic stage in ancien r´egime France was part of the way in which what we might call the “social imaginary” of a monarchical society was reproduced.6 As Bourdieu stressed, it would be a mistake to think that because much cultural work is creative, its function is all the production of new social relations. On the contrary, creative work is usually harnessed by the operatic field – as by the literary and other fields – in the service of social reproduction.7 Once again, we see the relevance of Bourdieu’s work. I cannot take the place of Pierre Bourdieu, or say what he might have said. But I do want to pay brief homage to him and suggest the importance of his work for projects such as understanding not only the relationship of opera to society but opera as a social phenomenon. Bourdieu was a remarkable scholar – deeply educated in theory but always in pursuit of empirical knowledge, passionate about the importance of both art and science yet reasoned in his approach to them, a thinker who transcended disciplines without giving up intellectual discipline. He was trained initially in philosophy but gave up the “caste profits” available to philosophers for the more mundane but empirically informed approach of sociology. His sociology was never simply contained by academic boundaries, though, and he made fundamental contributions to anthropology, education, and literary studies, as well as to intellectual life broadly understood. Bourdieu wrote more extensively on literature and painting than on music, more on museums than theatres, but his analyses of the development of the ideal of the pure aesthetic and of the relationship between cultural and economic capital are of potentially great importance in music scholarship as well. The time seems ripe for this undertaking. Musicologists have questioned ideologies of the pure aesthetic – without abandoning aesthetic concerns – and begun to ask increasingly interesting questions about the nature of listening, the social organization of both performances\n\nForeword\n\nand audiences, and the social impact of music. Social science should prove helpful. At the same time, many (I’m afraid not enough) social scientists have tried to throw off the common allergy to aesthetics that has impeded the integration of cultural and social analysis. Too often they may have embraced approaches to aesthetics that seem oldfashioned to scholars of music or art, but not always, and in any case there is an important revolution simply in bringing aesthetic concerns – and thus concerns for experience, meaning, and judgment – into the heart of social science. This offers the potential for social analyses of cultural productions that are not simply reductions to social causes and effects. Equally, a rich study of opera’s involvements in social contexts means going beyond the reading of libretti for an exploration of social significance. Obviously scholars have also studied riots outside opera houses and social pressures influencing taste in operas. But too few studies work adequately on music and staging as well as verbal content (just as too much music scholarship treats libretti and theatre as poor cousins).8 I think of some of this as the Tamu-Tamu effect. It happened that I was at the 1973 premiere of this late Menotti opera, since it was commissioned by the International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences. The opera concerns the displacement of Southeast Asian refugees into an American suburb to disturb the serene obliviousness of its residents and comment on global conflicts (this was the era of the Vietnam War). Its politically correct libretto and dramatic action are perhaps no more absurd than those of many operas. But note that the way in which Menotti sought to have relevance to the time, to politics, and to social science was overwhelmingly contained within libretto and dramatic action; the music had a supporting role. Menotti also chose a staging that made a minimal break between audience and action. He did not find in opera a specific form of expression that gave him any more license to explore controversial themes than did the form of academic paper, welcoming address, or ordinary theatre (and this may be less a matter of his choices than of the times). In this, the premiere of Tamu-Tamu was significantly different from, say,\n\nxxvii\n\nxxviii\n\nForeword\n\nthe famous Paris staging of The Marriage of Figaro. Mozart’s music was not only more beautiful and interesting (forgive the gratuitous evaluation) but played a more important role. Right from the overture, it opened up a space in which the radical content of Beaumarchais’s play could be presented without similar repression. The opera created a liminal space, more distant from political critique than the spoken word theatre, more outside of everyday life, and yet able to engage its categories.9 Of course music did far more than that; it served also as more than just an aid to memory, more than an added aspect of entertainment. It was and is also part of the meaning of the opera, and certainly part of what makes Mozart’s opera endure beyond Beaumarchais’s play. Conversely, the libretto is less than meets the eye. In the obvious sense, potentially controversial parts of the play were dropped from the opera. But it is crucial to recognize both that audiences knew this and were able to supply some of the missing content, and that the very omissions signaled the significance of the unstageable actions. This is a relatively commonplace bit of opera history; I don’t claim to adduce new facts. I want merely to illustrate the importance of working beyond the confines of a conception of social significance or impact which focuses on manifest content – of either operas or responses to them. I would note also, finally, a minor bit of the Tamu-Tamu story that suggests the renewed relevance of an old issue in a changed context. The soprano Menotti chose to sing the lead was Sung Sook Lee. TamuTamu gave her a big break and she went on to a distinguished international career. At the height of it, however, she converted to evangelical Christianity (reversing some of Menotti’s East comes West imagery) and announced she could no longer sing opera, which she regarded as inherently profane, but only sacred music. Of course opera had run afoul of clerical disapproval before. Indeed, it is a musical tradition that has proved interestingly refractory to religious appropriation (though a genre of sacred opera was created to provide for performances during Lent). One of the senses in which opera has generally been “popular” rather than high art is precisely that it has been profane. This is a different axis from that usually used to distinguish popular from high art,\n\nForeword\n\nbut the history which it calls to our attention is in fact very relevant, even if forgotten by most sociologists thinking about the categories. This reminds us again that the operatic tradition is not just internal, not something that can be grasped only by attending to opera. Attention is also required to operas intertwining with other cultural traditions, including in such oppositions as profane or secular to sacred. And as Lee’s example suggests, this is not just textual but a matter of the lives and careers of artists. The very notion of tradition needs interrogation. When we speak about the development of the Italian opera tradition (or later the French or German) and on this basis also make claims about what constitutes “real” opera, we need not only good and plentiful facts, and also careful considerations of just what we mean by Italian, French, or German at different points in history or from the different perspectives of performers, patrons, and audiences. We need also care in considering just how tradition – literally, passing on or handing over – is accomplished. What are the different roles of explicit teaching and of imitation? What is the relationship of tradition over time to integration at one time – as among the many different crafts involved in producing an opera? How are the parts of tradition that result in or depend on written records to be related to those that do not? How do elite and popular participants in tradition influence it (and each other)? Is it always innovation that is in need of explanation or should analysis focus as much on the recuperative, reproductive capacity of tradition? My point is not, alas, that social science has the perfect theory of tradition and musicologists need only to import it. Rather, the point is that opera is a terrific site for the interrogation of what tradition means and how its different dimensions interrelate. Conversely, of course, there is the curse of becoming “classical” and all the debates about the relationship of old to new in operatic repertoires. What does it mean for so much of the core repertory to have been composed by the nineteenth century, and for that composed later to fare so much better with conservatories and critics than broader publics? What are the implications of the aging of opera audiences in many countries?\n\nxxix\n\nxxx\n\nForeword\n\nThere are many more questions, of course, and undoubtedly many will be stimulated that neither I nor the contributors to this volume have imagined. This is just one of the many reasons that I am very pleased that the Social Science Research Council was able to organize the conference from which this book developed. I would also thank NYU for the use of its magnificent Villa La Pietra, allowing us to meet in the vicinity of Florence during the opera festival. I would like to thank the editors for helping to establish the link between the ephemeral event and enduring scholarship. In Pierre Bourdieu’s memory I am pleased to note their passion for their intellectual undertaking, their openness to perspectives from numerous fields, and their willingness to see how claims to disciplinary boundaries and professional expertise are also claims to specific forms of capital and can sometimes be blinkers as well as aids in the pursuit of knowledge. They and the contributors have used disciplinary expertise but also transcended its limits. Craig Calhoun Social Science Research Council\n\nn ot e s 1 See Beth L. Glixon and Jonathan E.

Throughout its history, creators and audiences alike have understood opera as a multi-media art form, one that includes music, text, visual elements, and (often) dance. Because of the great expense of opera performance, local political and economic elites have wielded considerable power over its creators, with the strength of these ties depending on the demands of artistic and institutional conventions. Though the distribution and differentiation of labor in opera performance has varied somewhat according to the historical moment, it has nearly always included – even at its sparest – singers, a stage with a set, instrumentalists, and an audience. And even in the context of quite modest production values, opera has required an enormous variety of material and human resources. The complexity entailed by opera’s combination of multiple artistic media – a complexity which arguably surpasses that of any other art form – means that the study of operatic history demands the analytical tools of a variety of academic disciplines. Nevertheless, until recently, scholars for decades pried opera apart into the discrete fragments most susceptible to their preferred methods of analysis: music, words, singers, theatres, directors, audiences. The operatic unity thereby lost is not the unity of words and music, nor is it the sense of dramatic unity sometimes invoked by critics in favorable reviews of individual opera performances. It is, rather, the original historical unity of the specific practices comprising the production and consumption of something conventionally labeled “opera.” Over the last decade and a half, however, the terrain of opera studies has been dramatically altered by an explosion of interest in opera across 1\n\n2\n\nVictoria Johnson\n\ndisciplines as well as by an increased interdisciplinarity in approaches to opera. In the wake of the cultural and historical “turns” that transformed the humanities and social sciences in the 1970s and 1980s, musicologists in particular have turned in increasing numbers to the study of opera, and in doing so they have often drawn heavily on the methods of literary criticism and cultural history. Scholars in a range of disciplines beyond musicology have also made important contributions to this wave of new work on opera. Despite this blossoming of opera studies, however, scholars from the various disciplines concerned have had few opportunities to juxtapose and compare their differing approaches to their common object. The present volume aims to create just such an opportunity and, at the same time, to extend it to a broad audience of readers. The short introductions to each of this volume’s three sections discuss and compare the various approaches taken by the contributors to the task of re-embedding opera in its social, political, and cultural contexts of creation and reception. In the present introduction, however, I have a different purpose: to situate the current major themes and methods in opera studies through a brief examination of the recent history of the academic disciplines involved, including musicology, history, literature, and sociology. To this end, I offer a series of maps: first, a map of the current division of academic labor in the study of opera; next, a map of the recent intellectual developments – the so-called “turns” – that have helped to transform opera studies in highly promising ways; and, finally, a map of the major paths of inquiry evident in recent work on opera. Depending on the reader’s disciplinary home turf, the territory covered in this introductory essay may at times be quite familiar; more often, I hope, the reader will find the brief introductions to the concerns and recent histories of less familiar disciplines useful and informative. O P E R A A N D T H E D I V I S I O N O F AC A D E M I C L A B O R\n\nFor more than a century, musicology has been the natural repository of opera scholarship, despite the somewhat marginal position accorded the operatic form in a discipline that has often considered “pure” music\n\nIntroduction\n\na more legitimate concern.1 Opera has, until relatively recently, been thought of by many musicologists as a poor relation in the musical family, in large part because of its commingling of music and text. It is precisely this textual element, of course, that has sometimes made opera seem more accessible to non-musicologists than purely instrumental music. For example, literary scholars concerned with drama have occasionally opened libretti to ponder such questions as how Shakespeare’s plays were altered when they were wedded to music or how the dominant literary conventions of a given historical epoch were translated into the libretto form.2 But, in a parallel to the somewhat marginal status of opera among musicologists, the libretto has long occupied a marginal position among the genres studied by scholars of literature, in part because of a perceived subordination of text to music and the concomitant decrease in the libretto’s value as “pure” literature.3 Other academic specialists who might fruitfully contribute to the study of opera have been even less attentive than musicologists and literary critics to the history of opera. The most important reason for this inattention is the timidity with which non-musicologists approach musical works. The apparent non-representational nature of music (itself the subject of centuries of heated debate) and the technical difficulty of learning to read music have combined forcefully to discourage scholars not fluent in the language of music from putting their analytical tools to work in this area. And a further obstacle to the production of rigorous non-musicological work on opera, as the historian William Weber has pointed out regarding his own discipline, is the long-standing habit among humanities scholars of examining artistic movements from within a narrow “history of ideas” paradigm.4 This paradigm has limited the ability of historians to examine thoroughly the relations between the political and the philosophical ideas of a historical era and the translation of these ideas into artistic movements, including those that have structured the world of opera over the centuries. Where opera has seemed to bear explicit political messages, or where its composers were themselves directly implicated in national politics, historians have indeed ventured to comment on opera.5 But they have largely remained unable or unwilling to come to terms with\n\n3\n\n4\n\nVictoria Johnson\n\nthe importance of opera as a site of social, cultural, and political interaction in modern European history. Still other disciplines have been no more proficient or prolific in the analysis of opera, sometimes for the same reasons that confront historians, but sometimes for reasons specific to particular disciplinary trajectories. For example, despite Max Weber’s early contribution to the sociology of music and Theodor Adorno’s extensive mid-century writings, sociologists have shied away from examining the specifically musical content of musical works in favor of explaining the social and economic structures behind their production.6 In this sense, sociologists have been no more confident than historians about directly confronting the difficult questions surrounding the relation between musical content and social context. Despite the textual element of opera, this sociological reluctance towards the study of music in general has done nothing to encourage attention within the discipline to the operatic form. And there is a further obstacle to the study of opera facing sociologists, an obstacle that derives from the discipline’s own history. Having once (in the 1960s) taken up the gauntlet thrown down by the Frankfurt School in its diatribes against the American “culture industry,” sociologists of art have for decades been engaged, on the one hand, in the fruitful work of specifying the precise mechanisms by which commercial interests shape popular culture, and, on the other, in documenting the liberating powers of popular culture.7 “High” culture forms such as opera have largely remained in the shadows, except when they have appeared in their modern incarnations in organizational studies of non-profit institutions.8 European and American operatic history has therefore received almost no attention at all from American sociologists since at least World War II.9 Disciplinary divisions of labor, internal disciplinary concerns, and the apparent impenetrability of musical works have thus served to hamper the analysis of opera production and consumption by specialists in literature, history, and sociology who in principle have much to contribute to such an analysis and whose own disciplines stand only to gain thereby. In the last twenty-five years, however, a set of linked transformations in scholarly concerns and methods throughout the\n\nIntroduction\n\nhumanities and social sciences has laid the groundwork and provided the inspiration for a wave of innovative new works on opera, including musicologist Jane Fulcher’s The Nation’s Image: French Grand Opera as Politics and Politicized Art (1987), musicologist Carolyn Abbate’s Unsung Voices: Opera and Musical Narrative in the Nineteenth Century (1991), and literary critic Herbert Lindenberger’s Opera in History (1998). The Cambridge Opera Journal, launched in 1989 with an inaugural issue featuring contributors from the disciplines of philosophy, musicology, literary criticism, and history, heralded – and has since nurtured – the new spirit of opera scholarship. These scholarly undertakings, and others like them, bear witness to the interest within many disciplines in new kinds of cultural and historical analysis as well as to a new degree of disciplinary cross-fertilization. The intellectual developments that made these and other similarly innovative works possible are often referred to today as the cultural and historical “turns.” In the following section, I briefly trace the origins and effects of these developments in history, sociology, literary criticism, and musicology – all key disciplines in the study of opera – before examining the major lines of inquiry that have emerged in opera studies with the help of the turns. THE TURNS IN THE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES\n\nThese turns, by no means smooth or unilinear processes, are the unevenly achieved result of a set of loosely linked critiques of traditional methods and objects of study that cut a swath through a wide range of disciplines from the 1970s onward. However contradictory and fitful these developments have been, their end product has been a massive reorientation of scholarly concerns and methods in history, sociology, and literature. History History’s “cultural turn” took place in the 1970s and 1980s and had its origins in a reaction to two important currents of historical\n\n5\n\n6\n\nVictoria Johnson\n\nscholarship: traditional political history and the social history inaugurated by the Annales school in the 1930s and carried on in a more Marxist vein by a second generation of French historians such as Albert Soboul and George Rud´e.10 The success of this reaction is evident in the broad influence of the school of historical studies known as the New Cultural History, whose most prominent representatives are the French historians Roger Chartier and Jacques Revel and the American historians Natalie Zemon Davis, Robert Darnton, and Lynn Hunt. In the 1970s and 1980s, these French and American scholars found themselves dissatisfied with the huge gaps left in the explanation of historical processes and events by historians’ dependence on two sources of historical information: on the one hand, the published, learned texts of politically and socially prominent figures, and on the other (with the inception of the Annales school), quantifiable information about social and economic life. Influenced by E. P. Thompson and Michel Foucault, among others, the new culturally oriented historians began to explore alternative ways to capture the experience of the past by mining unconventional historical sources such as accounts of popular festivals or visual representations of public and private life. These sources guided scholars toward new answers to old questions – particularly those that have never ceased to surround the causes, trajectory, and effects of the French Revolution – and they often raised utterly new questions as well. A central accomplishment of the New Cultural History has been to show how cultural practices are embedded in a relation of mutual constitution with social and economic structures, an approach that stands in stark contrast to traditional understandings of the historical role of “culture” once prevalent among left-leaning and conservative historians alike.11 The cultural turn in history was accompanied by another kind of turn, this one – strange as it might seem – historical. Unhappy with the Annalistes’ failure to take seriously the power of actors to alter social structures, historians such as Pierre Nora and Lynn Hunt made the event and other processual and temporal categories central to historical analysis and explanation.12\n\nIntroduction\n\nSociology Like history, American sociology has also undergone both a cultural and a historical turn, though these were initially separate lines of influence which have only in the past decade begun to join into a single current of sociological inquiry. Sociology, deeply historical in the hands of its founding fathers, had by the 1960s become focused on contemporary American social structure and social problems. However, a new school of sociology, initiated in large part by the historian and sociologist Charles Tilly, imported some of the concerns and methods of the Annales school (itself deeply sociological in its methods) into the study of perennial sociological questions such as the origins of revolutions and the nature of modernization.13 Tilly, along with Theda Skocpol and other influential historical sociologists, has since trained several generations of students to think about sociological questions from a historical perspective.14 However, some of these students (and in fact some of the teachers) came to believe that historical sociology as practiced in the 1970s was not “historical” enough. A major complaint of this “third wave” of historical sociologists was the ahistoricity of the quantitative and comparative methods initially developed in order to help legitimize historical sociology as a sociological subfield.15 In the 1990s, historical sociologists such as Andrew Abbott and William Sewell, Jr., argued that historical sociology had not yet taken time and temporality seriously, while Craig Calhoun suggested that historical sociology had allowed itself to be “domesticated” instead of using its tools to analyze the “historical constitution of basic theoretical categories.”16 This historical turn in American sociology was accompanied by a cultural turn. By the time Tilly began trying to acquaint sociologists with historical methods and concerns, American sociology had already experienced a small revolution against the dominant sociological paradigm of the mid-twentieth century, American structuralfunctionalism. Sociologists of culture were appropriating the revision of Marxism generated from within British Cultural Studies, along with the work of anthropologists such as Clifford Geertz, as they attempted\n\n7\n\n8\n\nVictoria Johnson\n\nto develop convincing critiques of the critics of mass culture.17 Some sociologists of culture gradually began to revise their own assumptions about their central concept and to expand the definition of culture to include practice, discourse, and symbols. From France, the various poststructuralist critiques of Levi-Straussian and Saussurian structuralism, especially those of Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu, made their way into American studies of popular culture and also inspired culturalist studies of social spheres that had previously been considered outside the purview of cultural sociology, such as banking, railroads, or the insurance industry. For certain American sociologists, “culture” has become as ubiquitous and powerful a tool for explanation as it has for the founders and the inheritors of the New Cultural History, no longer viewed as a mere emanation of economic and social structures nor as a severely circumscribed sphere of artifacts in modern society. The multiple influences of poststructuralism, Geertzian anthropology, feminism, and cultural studies have combined to produce a set of aligned, if not always compatible, definitions of culture in sociology as a potential locus of political struggle and as a producer in its own right of social and economic structures. Literary criticism For its part, the discipline of literary criticism, by definition already a deeply “cultural” one in the narrower sense, underwent a historical turn marked by the ascendancy of the “New Historicism” in the early 1980s. Literary criticism’s historical turn was, in spite of individual differences in emphasis and outlook, above all a reaction to the brand of literary analysis that had dominated since the late 1920s, the “New Criticism.”18 American literary scholars working in this tradition, whose foremost representatives were Cleanth Brooks, John Crowe Ransom, and Robert Penn Warren, chose to bracket the historical context of literary works in favor of attention to the texts alone. These scholars shared a conviction that literary works held the key to appropriate understanding between their covers and that criticism should be deployed for the close analysis of texts without recourse to\n\nIntroduction\n\nextra-textual information. Attention to historical context was largely eschewed in the quest to understand the work on its own terms, an approach which often served to identify innovation or creativity as emanating from the author alone. The “New Historicism” marked one current of reaction to this sort of autonomous understanding of the text. Scholars working in this vein began to explore the historical contexts in which literary works were created to examine how their authors were beholden to contemporary modes of discourse and other collective social phenomena for the structure and content of their supposedly autonomous literary creations.19 Meanwhile, another strain of reaction to the New Criticism was triggered by the influential reinterpretation of Saussurian semiotics by Roland Barthes, which opened up a whole new range of “texts” to be “read” by critics, including pictures, social practices, and the objects of daily life.20 To this expansion of subject matter, British Cultural Studies and the many varieties of French poststructuralism contributed a revised understanding of the individual text as permitting multiple and equally valid readings and as thus exhibiting “multivocality.” By the 1980s, the kind of textual interpretation practiced by the New Criticism had largely been replaced by a new flexibility (or laxness, depending on one’s perspective) of method, a new set of questions, and a new range of literary “sources.” As we shall see, it was these developments in literary theory that were to have the heaviest impact on the study of opera, contributing to a wave of new works on the subject in the 1980s and 1990s, both within musicology and beyond its borders. Musicology It has frequently been noted that musicology has been the discipline most resistant to, and even ignorant of, the dramatic changes in the humanities and social sciences that began to make themselves felt in the 1970s.21 The transformations in methods, sources, and concerns that were profoundly altering the study of literature hardly touched musicology for at least a decade, as the discipline remained curiously\n\n9\n\n10\n\nVictoria Johnson\n\nimpervious to the kind of cross-pollination that made sociologists and literary critics alike claim Raymond Williams and Roland Barthes as their own, or that made Foucault at one and the same time an anthropologist, a literary theorist, a historian, and a sociologist. One of the long-standing exceptions to this rule of disciplinary insularity, Leo Treitler, has suggested that musicology, troubled by its lack of documentary sources before the medieval period – compared, for example, to the ancient documentation available to scholars of literature and the visual arts – has been resistant to the new academic currents because it has focused most of its energy on securing its own tradition through the painstaking reconstruction of historical facts and sources.22 Though these studies have vastly expanded our historical record of musical life, they have usually made only a limited contribution to questions about the place of music in the history of human societies. While many musicologists have moved beyond the traditional “internalist” study of musical works to the documentation of extra-musical phenomena such as markets and politics, many of these same musicologists have continued to treat the musical works themselves as objectively autonomous entities, rather than examining the way such autonomy is socially constituted (or blocked). Like nonmusicologists who may romanticize music as a fundamentally difficult and mysterious art form, musicologists have often implicitly endowed music with a timeless autonomy that discourages them from posing questions about the relations between musical form and content and extra-musical context at all. Gradually, however, beginning in the mid-1980s, a series of unusual conferences and the research of a few bold musicologists resulted in the publication of several pathbreaking volumes that have questioned the assumptions behind the dominant concerns and methods in American musicology as well as exploring possible approaches to questions rarely posed by musicologists about music/society relations. These works include (but are not limited to) Contemplating Music: Challenges to Musicology ( Joseph Kerman, 1985); Music and Society: The Politics of Composition, Performance and Reception (edited by Richard Leppert and Susan McClary, 1987); Feminine Endings: Music, Gender and Sexuality\n\nIntroduction\n\n(Susan McClary, 1991); Disciplining Music: Musicology and Its Canons (edited by Katherine Bergeron and Philip V. Bohlman, 1992); Musicology and Difference: Gender and Sexuality in Music Scholarship (edited by Ruth A. Solie, 1993), and Classical Music and Postmodern Knowledge (Lawrence Kramer, 1995). The titles of these books clearly signal that musicology itself has undergone a turn of sorts in the last fifteen years. And while musicology might appear to be a discipline that is cultural and historical by definition, it has acquired a new historicism and culturalism that have transformed research methods and concerns. Many musicologists have become more truly “historical” in their methods and conclusions by building contingency, path dependence, and links to non-musical features of given historical conjunctures into the analysis of the musical work itself. Whereas they had previously been (and many still are) more comfortable identifying the historicity in a work as a question of strictly musical influence, a handful of musicologists are now working to re-embed musical life and musical works in their specific extra-musical historical conjunctures. This re-evaluation of the social processes shaping the history of musical works has also led to a revision of musicological assumptions about the nature of “culture” by encouraging the analysis of music as social practice and discourse rather than as a set of largely self-contained artifacts. These currents in musicology, which have touched methodology and subject matter alike, parallel and draw on the developments of the last three decades in sociology, history, and literary criticism. Musicologists have found inspiration in sociology and cultural history for analyses of canon construction, for studies of the economic, political, social, and cultural structures in which musical life is embedded, and for investigations into the social functions of classical music. In a move reminiscent of Pierre Bourdieu’s French application in Distinction (1979) of anthropological methods usually reserved for “primitive” cultures, some scholars of Western classical music have begun to take their cues from the subfield of ethnomusicology.23 Following the lead of the New Cultural Historians, musicologists have explored the ways in which music not only mirrors, but also contributes to,\n\n11\n\n12\n\nVictoria Johnson\n\nthe production and reinforcement of social structure, social practices, and systems of meaning. And just as cultural historians have expanded the repertoire of legitimate archival sources, musicologists have supplemented the common tools for studying music – namely, the analysis of scores and the interpretation of biographical details of composers’ lives – with such unorthodox sources as pictorial representations of musical production and consumption.24 In a similar vein, composers’ sketches for works in progress, used heretofore in a fashion that has tended to buttress the notion of the isolated, inspired, creator, have been recast as evidence for the contingent, even haphazard, nature of musical composition.25 Musicologists have been more directly influenced by developments in literary criticism than by those in any other discipline, in part because the literary concern with a particular form of artistic creation demonstrates most directly the possible advantages for the study of music of applying the assumptions and methods of the new culturalist work in sociology and of the new cultural history. But besides mediating between musicology and these other disciplines, literary criticism has itself been the source of a number of promising new approaches to the study of music. Theories of reception in music have been modeled on literary reception theory to reveal the multiple meanings available to listeners and to contest the usefulness – and sometimes the possibility – of reconstructing artistic intentions. Feminist scholars have examined the distribution of gender work in various musical cultures, and some have argued for the interpretation of musical works as themselves “gendered” or as reflecting and reinforcing gender hierarchies in the extra-musical world.26 Semiotics has made great strides with some musicologists, who have employed its principles and methods to examine how “linguistic” codes tie musical works to their social contexts through the notes themselves.27 It is important to note that these developments represent a double movement away from traditional musicology. First, progressive musicologists have firmly embedded what is often known, misleadingly, as “musical culture” or “the music world” into a larger and more complex set of social structures, thereby paving the way for the historicization\n\nIntroduction\n\nof the implicitly claimed autonomy of this sphere. And more daringly, they have bared the musical work itself to the new ways of thinking about history and culture, dismantling the ideas that musical works are inherently autonomous and that they are locked in an eternal and insulated dialogue among themselves. Such traditional approaches to the study of music have in some quarters given way to an assessment of the ways in which even “pure” music is the carrier of extra-musical symbols and codes and is the producer of meaning and social structure. A P P R OAC H I N G O P E R A A F T E R T H E T U R N S\n\nBoth directly and indirectly, the turns have helped effect a profound transformation in opera studies. Opera scholarship within musicology, for example, has been a major beneficiary of the new movements in that discipline in part because musicologists specializing in opera, given their inevitable confrontation with the text of the libretto, have been more likely to be aware of developments in literary criticism than have musicologists specializing in instrumental music. Another group of musicologists working on opera has found in cultural history the inspiration and models for approaching opera with new methods and questions. And beyond musicology, the expansion of acceptable subject matter in both literary criticism and cultural history has freed scholars in those fields to take opera seriously as a topic of intellectual inquiry. A review of opera scholarship published in all disciplines in the last decade and a half reveals three major lines of inquiry, which can be roughly classified as the “critical” approach, the “systems of meaning” approach, and the “material conditions” approach. The “critical” approach, pursued mainly by musicologists and literary critics, involves a search for present meanings, either social or personal, in operatic works. The “systems of meanings” approach, practiced mainly by musicologists and historians, betrays the influence of the New Cultural Historians in its concern with the historical meanings available to the creators and consumers of operatic works. Practitioners who are primarily engaged in the second line of inquiry often also take up the third line of inquiry (although the opposite is not as likely). This third\n\n13\n\n14\n\nVictoria Johnson\n\nline, the “material conditions” approach, involves the reconstruction and analysis of the organizational, political, and professional structures underpinning opera production and consumption in specific historical contexts. The “critical” approach in opera studies traces its roots to a work that long predates the “turns”: Joseph Kerman’s pathbreaking Opera as Drama, first published in 1956 and reissued in 1988. As the musicologist Susan McClary has noted, early critical works such as Kerman’s “remained more or less isolated voices calling for the grafting of critical projects onto the mainstream of the profession.”28 It was not until the 1980s and the pioneering work of McClary herself that musicologists began to question traditional musicological approaches to opera, which privileged close readings of musical passages and excluded considerations of the music’s expression of social relationships and meanings. McClary’s innovative writings, which deal with both instrumental and operatic works, have centered on the expression of gender relations in these works. Musicologists inspired by her critical approach have often similarly focused on gender and sexuality in opera. Aiding this double shift toward criticism and gender issues in musicological studies of opera was a spate of books on opera by literary critics, among the most influential of which has been Catherine Cl´ement’s Opera, or the Undoing of Women, first published in French in 1976 and published in an English translation, with a foreword by McClary, in 1988. This work draws on anthropology, semiology, and psychoanalysis to analyze the fatal end that awaits the heroines of so many operas. Arguing that the sumptuous music accompanying their deaths encourages forgetfulness of the true nature of the events unfolding on stage, Cl´ement focuses her analysis on the frequently morbid plots: “What awarenesses dimmed by beauty and the sublime,” she asks, “come to stand in the darkness of the hall and watch the infinitely repetitive spectacle of a woman who dies, murdered?”29 Cl´ement’s and McClary’s studies have inspired a wave of research on representations of sexuality and gender in opera. And encouraged, perhaps, by the success of literary critic Wayne Koestenbaum’s The Queen’s Throat, research on sexuality and gender has expanded beyond\n\nIntroduction\n\nspecifically feminist criticism to include analyses of lesbian and gay musical experiences and musical meanings.30 By searching for such unorthodox meanings, this work on gender and sexuality goes beyond traditional musicological readings of musical scores and libretti. But it is not the subject matter – gender and sexuality – that distinguishes these studies from other scholarship on opera, both past and present. More significant for our purposes here is their treatment of operatic works not as historical artifacts but as texts that invite contemporary and often avowedly personal readings.31 The second line of inquiry evident in recent opera scholarship – one that is quite distinct from the “critical” approach – is largely the product of the transformation of political and cultural historiography in the last three decades, although it also owes a good deal to the comparativist Edward Said’s work on orientalism and opera.32 Studies in this vein, which have come primarily from musicologists and historians, focus on reconstructing the “systems of meaning” (musical as well as extra-musical) that have shaped the production and reception of operatic works in specific historical contexts.33 It is no accident that some of the musicologists most attentive to the turns in cultural and political history are scholars of French opera, since it is historians of France (British and American as well as French) who have been the prime catalysts for this set of turns. The musicologist Jane Fulcher, for example, states at the outset of her 1987 study of French grand opera that she is offering “not narrowly a ‘reception history’ but . . . a cultural history. For what interests me,” she writes, “is how grand opera was implicated in a social and cultural context – how it arose within these larger structures and in turn reacted back finally upon them.”34 Similarly, in her book French Cultural Politics and Music from the Dreyfus Affair to the First World War, Fulcher offers an analysis of Gustave Charpentier’s opera Louise that again shows deep affinities with the defining concerns of the New Cultural History: By focusing on stylistic codes of meaning as understood within the period, this study seeks to avoid imputing political meanings on the basis of our current perceptions of political homologies or metaphors. Such an\n\n15\n\n16\n\nVictoria Johnson “essentialist” approach . . . must be replaced by the historical and anthropological study of meaning. We must attempt to excavate the systems of meaning in which specific works were both conceived by composers and then understood by audiences of the time – which were not necessarily identical. In the case of Louise, we shall find that the two were indeed substantially different; moreover, the context of performance played a central role in determining how the contemporary public and critics “read” the work . . . [A]lthough politics was not always present in the messages or modes of communication of the music, it affected conditions of both presentation and reception.35\n\nLike many cultural historians working today, Fulcher’s explicit purpose is to reconstruct, as far as possible, past “systems of meanings” – what sociologists often refer to as “cultural schemas” – in order to understand the constraints and possibilities shaping musical expression and reception at particular historical conjunctures. Otherwise, one runs the risk of reading into musical works what was not there for the composer, or – since the relevance of the composer’s intentions have been called into question by so many scholars – for both initial and subsequent historical audiences. In his 1995 study of musical reception in Paris between 1750 and 1850, Listening in Paris, the historian James Johnson – taking aim at Susan McClary – points out the stakes of the same problem far more polemically: I cannot doubt McClary when she claims to hear a narrative of rape and murder in Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony . . . [b]ut such a view of musical meaning, which I think neglects the actual musical features that frame our perceptions and delimit possible musical content, is arguably as one-sided as its opposite extreme, which dismisses listeners’ own aesthetic and ideological expectations as irrelevant in deriving some supposedly fixed musical meaning.36\n\nAt least in part, the third major line of work in opera studies sidesteps such contentious debates by turning from the works themselves to the material conditions of operatic production and reception. Among the most prominent research in this line is a series of institutional studies of Italian operatic history by the historian John Rosselli, including The Opera Industry in Italy from Cimarosa to Verdi: The Role of the Impresario;\n\nIntroduction\n\nMusic and Musicians in Nineteenth-Century Italy; and Singers of Italian Opera: The History of a Profession. A 1998 volume on Opera Production and Its Resources (part of a series entitled History of Italian Opera), edited by the musicologists Lorenzo Bianconi and Giorgio Pestelli, similarly aims to document the organizational and professional contexts in which operatic works have historically been created and consumed. A major and quite recent contribution to the institutional approach is Beth and Jonathan Glixon’s 2006 study Inventing the Business of Opera: The Impresario and His World in Seventeenth-Century Venice. Although a great deal of such work has centered on Italian opera, a handful of historians and musicologists have posed the same questions in studies of French operatic history. In an early article on the eighteenth-century Paris Opera (one that can itself be considered a contribution to the cultural turn in French history), the historian William Weber, for example, argues that the unusually dated repertoire on offer to the Parisian public up until the mid-1770s was the result of a combination of institutional factors, including royal cultural policy, the geographical concentration of the French aristocracy in and around Paris, French musicians’ educational and career trajectories, and the relative expense of the dominant French operatic genre (trag´edie lyrique).37 And the musicologist Elizabeth Bartlet employs painstaking archival research to uncover the precise institutional processes by which the repertoire of the Paris Opera was altered during the French Revolution.38 Since scholars concerned with the reconstruction of systems of meaning often ground this project in the reconstruction of the organizational and professional structures shaping production and reception, these second and third approaches – the “systems of meaning” approach and the “material conditions” approach – are more closely linked with each other than is either with the “critical” approach. Nevertheless, while practitioners of the first approach have already seen their efforts brought together in several interdisciplinary edited volumes, no similar volume has jointly presented the efforts of opera scholars working in multiple disciplines who are committed to reinscribing opera in its historical circumstances of production and reception.39 It is for this reason that we have chosen to focus here on interdisciplinary\n\n17\n\n18\n\nVictoria Johnson\n\ncontributions to the second and third approaches. In order to take advantage of the potential for cross-national comparisons offered by the history of opera, we have brought together scholars of Italy and France, yet for the purpose of maintaining focus we have limited the countries represented to these two. The first section of the volume (“The Representation of Social and Political Relations in Operatic Works”) presents readings of French and Italian operas that firmly ground these works in their specific historical contexts, while the second section (“The Institutional Bases for the Production and Reception of Opera”) is devoted to studies primarily concerned with understanding the conditions shaping the production and reception of operatic works in France and Italy. The third section of the volume (“Theorizing Opera and the Social”) brings together three essays explicitly addressing the question of how best to approach the analysis of the social dimensions of operatic works and practices. The questions addressed by the contributors to this volume include some of the most central in opera studies today. By what methods should we analyze and interpret operatic works and operatic practices? Is meaning in opera fixed or malleable? Do composers’ intentions matter, and if so, can we know them? Where does the operatic “work” to be analyzed actually reside – in the score and libretto, in operatic performances, or perhaps nowhere? And how, if at all, are social relations represented in operatic works? An edited volume cannot pretend to offer tidy solutions to such complex puzzles. But by juxtaposing a variety of disciplinary approaches to a wide historical range of operatic works and practices, we hope to introduce readers to some innovative ways of thinking about these pressing questions. We also hope to provoke new questions entirely.\n\nn ot e s 1 Joseph Kerman’s Opera as Drama (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1956), which located opera’s dramatic power largely in its music, did much to galvanize and maintain interest in opera despite the genre’s\n\nIntroduction\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5 6\n\nsubordinate status in musicology. Regarding the status of opera vis-`a-vis “pure” music, see Susan McClary, “Foreword: The Undoing of Opera: Toward a Feminist Criticism of Music,” pp. ix–xviii in Catherine Cl´ement, Opera, or the Undoing of Women, trans. Betsy Wing (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1988), p. xii; see also Susan McClary, “Turtles All the Way Down (On the ‘Purely Musical’),” pp. 1–31 in McClary, Conventional Wisdom: The Content of Musical Form (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000); and Carolyn Abbate and Roger Parker, “Introduction: On Analyzing Opera,” in Carolyn Abbate and Roger Parker, eds., Analyzing Opera: Verdi and Wagner (Berkeley: University, of California Press, 1989), pp. 1–24; see pp. 3–4.

The strongest sociological tradition in the study of art consumption (as opposed to production) has come from Marxian cultural sociologists generally grouped under the rubric British Cultural Studies; key works include Simon Frith, Sound Effects: Youth, Leisure, and the Politics of Rock’n’Roll (New York: Pantheon, 1978); Dick Hebdige, Subculture: The Meaning of Style (New York: Methuen, 1979); Paul Willis, Profane Culture (London: Routledge, 1978); and Stuart Hall, Culture, Media, Languages (London: Hutchinson, 1980). Art consumption studies in the USA have been deeply influenced by British Cultural Studies; see, for example, Janice Radway, Reading the Romance: Women, Patriarchy and Popular Literature (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1984); and Elizabeth Long, Book Clubs: Women and the Uses of Reading in Everyday Life (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003). 8 Examples of such studies include Richard A.
