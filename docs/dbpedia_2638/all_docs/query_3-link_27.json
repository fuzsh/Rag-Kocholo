        "text": "There is a common thread that unites music and engineering, a recurring theme that characterises two worlds that at first sight appear to be miles apart: manufacturing. The process that lies behind the creation of an instrument is comparable to that behind the creation of a machine, because every single component is designed to ensure impeccable overall performance. Precisely because of this fascinating link, Carraro has been supporting Amici della Musica since 1986.\n\nWhat is Amici della Musica (Friends of Music)?\n\nAmici della Musica is a cultural association that was established in Padua in 1957; for more than fifty years, it has served as a point of reference for chamber music in Italy. Every year, it organises a season of concerts in the Padua Conservatory of Music's Pollini auditorium. This rich calendar of events enables visitors to listen to music by some of the biggest artists on the international concert scene.\n\nThe musical events are accompanied by the educational projects offered by the association. Indeed, for a number of years now, Amici della Musica has been bringing music into schools, with concerts, seminars and meetings, along with special discounts and promotions dedicated to young people so they can enjoy music outside of the classroom too.\n\nThe Amici della Musica association is founded on the union of two very prominent traditional organisations in the Padua region: the Società Bartolomeo Cristofori, known for the concerts of the Cesare Pollini musical institute and the Centro d'Arte degli Studenti dell'Università di Padova (the students' art centre at Padua University).\n\nThese two prestigious associations have brought a number of leading names to Padua, including Alfred Corton, Walter Gieseking, Arthur Rubinstein, Edwin Fischer, Egon Petri, Maurizio Pollini, Rudolf Serkin, the Busch Quartet and the Pro Arte Quartet.\n\nThe structure of the organisation was redefined in 1979, at which time the students' art centre chose to become autonomous. The latter now focuses its attentions on new developments in music and on jazz, although over the years, it has continued to work closely with Amici della Musica on a cultural and organisational level."
