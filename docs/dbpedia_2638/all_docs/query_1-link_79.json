        "text": "Born in 2012, the Guadagnini Quartet became the winner of the Piero Farulli Prize just two years later, within the XXXIII Franco Abbiati Prize. The Guadagnini Quartet has already performed in the most important concert halls in Italy for prestigious concert seasons, including Società del Quartetto di Milano, Amici della Musica di Firenze, Accademia Filarmonica Romana, Teatro \"La Fenice\" in Venice, Stradivari Festival in Cremona for the inauguration of the new Arvedi Auditorium at the Museum of the Violin, Unione Musicale in Turin, Società Umanitaria, Bologna Festival, Musica Insieme Bologna, MiTo Settembre Musica, Amici della Musica di Padova, IUC in Rome, Lucca Classica, Ravenna Festival, and Ravenna Musica, Scarlatti Association in Naples, Teatro Ponchielli in Cremona, Camerata musicale barese, Amici della Musica di Palermo, as well as in important concert halls in France, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Finland, Hungary, Japan, China, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn 2015, the quartet performed with pianist Beatrice Rana at the Italian Cultural Institute in Paris, where they were invited the following year as ensemble in residence, premiering two pieces dedicated to the quartet by Silvia Colasanti and Domenico Turi.\n\nIn 2016, the quartet undertook a national tour promoted by CIDIM, debuted at Teatro La Pergola in Florence for Amici della Musica, and at the Festival dei 2Mondi in Spoleto, playing a prominent role in \"Tre risvegli,\" a new work of musical theater by Silvia Colasanti with text by Patrizia Cavalli, directed by Mario Martone, featuring actress Alba Rohrwacher in the lead role. That same year, they were selected by the Stauffer Foundation in Cremona to represent Italian excellence in China at the Shanghai Exhibition Center, where they also held masterclasses and performed in various concerts.\n\nAmong their numerous artistic collaborations are notable partnerships with artists such as Louis Lortie, Beatrice Rana, Avi Avital, Enrico Bronzi, Federico Colli, Krzysztof Jablonski, Quartetto di Cremona, Gabriele Pieranunzi, and Giorgia Tomassi. In the field of music education, the quartet collaborates with Giovanni Bietti, Sandro Cappelletto, and Oreste Bossini.\n\nThe Guadagnini Quartet has recorded Paolo Cavallone's composition \"Mercutio\" and Raffaele Bellafronte's \"For Five…\" for Tactus with guitarist Davide Di Ienno. In November 2017, a CD dedicated to Brahms and Dvořák was released as a supplement to Amadeus magazine, and in 2022, Brilliant Classics released an album dedicated to the composer Wolf-Ferrari, featuring pianist Costantino Catena, which received critical acclaim and enthusiastic reviews.\n\nAs winners of international awards, the quartet completed an advanced training cycle at the \"W. Stauffer\" Academy in Cremona, studied with Hatto Beyerle, the historic violist of the Alban Berg Quartet, and participated in sessions of the European Chamber Music Academy (ECMA), of which Beyerle is the founder and artistic director. They also received instruction from Maestro Patrick Juedt and attended advanced courses for string quartets with Maestro Günter Pichler at the Accademia Chigiana in Siena and ProQuartet in Paris.\n\nThe quartet has performed on RAI 5 in the program \"Inventare il tempo\" and \"Musica da Camera con vista\" on RAI 3 alongside Corrado Augias and Giovanni Bietti in the program \"Visionari.\" They are regular guests on music-focused broadcasts and radio stations such as RADIO3, Radio Vaticana, Radio Classica, RSI - Radio della Svizzera Italiana, and RAI Cultura.\n\nAmong their upcoming commitments for 2024/2025 are a complete cycle of Shostakovich's string quartets and a debut in Colombia for masterclasses.\n\nIndividually, all members engage in teaching activities at the Conservatories of Cesena, Livorno, Pesaro, and Foggia. The quartet, in addition to regularly conducting masterclasses in Italy and abroad, including in China and Japan, also follows free courses in String Quartet at the Conservatory of Cesena.\n\nThe Guadagnini Quartet plays four modern string instruments: Fabrizio plays a 1962 Marino Capicchioni built in Rimini, Cristina plays a 2006 Massimo Nesi built in Florence, while Matteo and Alessandra play two instruments by Brescian luthier Filippo Fasser, a 2012 viola, and a 2016 cello.\n\nThe Guadagnini Quartet endorses Jargar Strings from Denmark."
