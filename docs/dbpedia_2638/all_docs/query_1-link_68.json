        "text": "Baritone & piano performance by Priante & Burnside duo.\n\nAbout the artists:\n\nVito Priante performed throughout the world for opera companies, festivals and venues including La Scala, Bayerische Staatsoper, Semperoper Dresden, Vienna Staatsoper, Rome Opera, Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, Palau de les Arts Reina Sofi­a Valencia, and many others. Nel 2009 he was awarded the XXVIII Franco Abbiati Prize for Best Male Voice for his interpretation of the title role in Dallapiccola’ s Il Prigioniero at Teatro alla Scala in Milan, Harding/Stein. In 2017 he was awarded the BBC Music Magazine Awards “Opera Award” for his interpretation of Leporello in Don Giovanni conducted by Currentzis.\n\nIain Burnside is one of the UK’s best-known musicians. Iain has worked with a huge number of international singers, notably Dame Margaret Price, Rosa Feola, Ailish Tynan, Joyce DiDonato, Laurence Brownlee, Roderick Williams, and Bryn Terfel, among many others. Innovative programme planning has led Iain to expand his concert work into a hybrid form of music theater, creating staged work around Brahms (Shining Armour), Wagner (The View from the Villa) and Gurney (A Soldier and a Maker). He has broadcast extensively on both radio and TV, notably as host of BBC R3’s acclaimed Voices series. In addition to a long association with London’s Guildhall School, Iain is Visiting International Artist at the Royal Irish Academy of Music, Dublin. He is Artistic Director of the Ludlow English Song Weekend and Artistic Consultant to Grange Park Opera, Surrey."
