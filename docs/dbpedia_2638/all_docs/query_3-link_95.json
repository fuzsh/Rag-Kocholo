        "text": "Juventus 0 vs. AC Milan 1​\n\n18.4.2010 - Serie A, Round 34\n\nMassimo Ambrosini (sent off 31)\n\nGennaro Gattuso (35)\n\nThis was a really important victory when Inter were in hot pursuit of us. Although Inter won their battle, I could now look forward to some easier matches.\n\nInter 1 vs. AC Milan 1\n\n21.4.2010 - Champions League, Semifinal leg 1\n\nDiego Milito (pen58) Alessandro Nesta (sent off 41)\n\nAndrea Pirlo (pen91)\n\nA match against our arch rivals in the Champions League was in many ways a very important battle. The away match should be played without having scored many goals against us and maybe we could score a single away goal. Both things successfully, and I was very happy with the match\n\nAC Milan 1 vs. Udinese 0\n\n24.4.2010 - Serie A, Round 35\n\nKlaas-Jan Huntelaar (13)\n\nAC Milan 1 vs. Inter 0\n\nPato (66) Sulley Muntari (Sent off 63)\n\nChristian Chivu (Sent off 68)\n\nAfter a fortunate goal, two red cards against Inter and some shots at the post, we could finally be sure that we had reached the final. The enthusiasm was indescribable, and for the first time we had beaten our rivals in this season, but also reached the final.\n\n​\n\nWe are still in first place in the league two points ahead of Inter, and with three matches left we have a good opportunity to keep our rivals behind us.\n\nMay update coming soon ...\n\nEnd of season​\n\n​\n\n2009-2010​\n\nSeason Overview\n\nSerie A\n\nAfter a long fight against our rivals Inter, we won Serie A. The last match agianst Palermo was the decisive match, and with the 2-0 win, we secured the title. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Pato were with their many goals, instrumental in that we secured the trophy and beat our arch-rivals who else had sided in the lead Serie A for many years.\n\nView attachment 77052 View attachment 77053\n\nItalien Cup\n\nWe had no major target to win this tournament because we was more concentrated on the league and Champions League, but still it was a bit disappointing effort when we went out in the second match. The disappointment wasn't smaller, as the defeat was against Inter who went all the way and won the trophy.\n\nView attachment 77054\n\nChampions League\n\nWhat a tournament. I saw the group as an easy task, but it was much harder than I had expected. Marseille, Standard Liege and CSKA Moscow was all smaller team then us. But while it looked like easy opponents we lost two, played a draw and won two. But 7 points was enough, and we won the group.\n\nThen it went very good and we beat both Shahktar, Real Madrid and Inter before we should face Chelsea in the final. And in the final, we with a little luck beated Chelsea, and could then lift the trophy and call ourselves \"The World's Best club team.\"\n\nView attachment 77055 View attachment 77056\n\nTactic, Team and Transfers\n\nTactic\n\nThroughout the season, I have tried to create the perfect 4-1-2-1-2 tactic to this AC Milan team. Therefore I have adjusted the tactic and team options several times during the season to match the club's players best abilities.\n\nAlthough its a very narrow tactic, i still want to play creative, and that have succeeded quite well. Ronaldinho, Salihovic and Pirlo has been responsible for most of the creative football on the team and their performances have been fine. In addition, my wingbacks, Kolarov, Zambrotta and Mongongu are a huge part of my tactic. They must participate a lot in the offensive, and to create some chances with crosses and passes towards the middle.\n\nOf cause my biggest star has been Pato, who scored an incredible amount of goals in the first half of the season, and reached number one on the top scorer list in Serie A sometime in november. Throughout the season I have used him as a poacher on the right side of my attack, and mostly Klaas-Jan Huntelaar on his left as Advanced Forward. This attack couple has worked really well, and as it looks now, I have no intention to replace them next season.\n\nView attachment 77057 View attachment 77058\n\nPlayer performences\n\nMy biggest stars has this season been Pato, Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Pirlo, Kolarov and Thiago Silva. Generally I do not think there have been some big disappointments, and the entire team keeped fit throughout the year. I have been very aware that all players should have playing time, and therefore I have rotated much in starting line-up, but when the big games should be played, there was always the same starting 11th on the pitch.\n\nView attachment 77038 View attachment 77039 View attachment 77042 View attachment 77046 View attachment 77049\n\nTransfers\n\nAt the beginning of the season I bought some players who would lift the level up, on a older team. Especially Kolarov and Salihovic should play a central role on the team, and they have done excellently. At the bottom I have posted screenshots of the rest of my transfers.\n\nView attachment 77059\n\n​\n\nPre-season 2010-2011 coming soon..."
