        "text": "Parma vs Juventus 1-2\n\nTopic: Serie A 2005-2006\n\nFifth wins out of five matches played by Juventus who beat Parma 2-1 at Tardini on the fifth week’s early match. The Bianconeri lead the game during the whole match, although it’s the home side who are first to take the lead on 14’ minutes with Delvecchio. Camoranesi earn the draw and Vieira scores the winning goal.\n\nTurnover at Parma for Capello’s side. Emerson and Nedved are at rest and are substituted respectively by Giannichedda and Mutu. In attack Capello lines up the new Trezeguet-Zalayeta partnership. Italy’s champions set up the game but it’s Parma who take the lead on their first attack. It’s 14’ minutes when Bresciano crosses to Corradi who passes back to Delvecchio and the latter nods it in (1-0). The Bianconeri, before Parma’s advantage, had attacked with Zalayeta, whose fine pass both Trezeguet and Camoranesi got anticipated on (7’) and then with the Frenchman’s attempt on goal which had ended high over the crossbar (10’). They insist with Camoranesi who heads the ball over the crossbar (16’ minutes) and engages the goalkeeper from the distance with a central shot (25’), while Mutu shoots a couple of free kicks from the edge of the box which are both hit back. Parma get dangerous on 28’ minutes with Morfeo’s free kick deflected on the goalline and on 39’ minutes with Simplicio’s shot on goal cleared by Abbiati. Juventus earn a draw one minute before the end of the first half: Vieira serves Camoranesi and the latter’s fantastic right-footed shot beats Lupatelli (1-1).\n\nDuring the break, Capello replaces Giannichedda with Emerson and also Zalayeta with Ibrahimovic and Mutu with Nedved. The second half’s tempo is faster. At the start, Abbiati is worried by Delvecchio and Bresciano, then it’s the Bianconeri’s turn to attack with Mutu first, whose shot ends high over the crossbar (8’) and then with Camoranesi, whose shot on goal is finally cleared (12’). On 19’ minutes, Vieira passes to Ibrahimovic but his cross for Trezeguet misses the target. On 27’ minutes, Bresciano puts the ball in and Pisano’s attempt on goal is wide of target. On 29’ minutes, Juventus get close to scoring when Nedved’s shot is intercepted by Trezeguet who is eventually anticipated by Contini in front of the net. On 35’ minutes it’s another scoring occasion for Juventus: Zambrotta crosses for Camoranesi who misses the post for little. Two minutes later and it’s time for the deserved advantage, signed by Vieira, who’s at his third goal in five matches: the Frenchman starts the action, assists Ibrahimovic then moves forward to receive the cross shot from the Swede and nods it in. It’s 2-1.\n\nPARMA – JUVENTUS 1-2\n\nGOALS: 14’f.h. Delvecchio, 44’f.h. Camoranesi, 37’s.h. Vieira\n\nPARMA: Lupatelli; Bonera, Cardone (2’s.h. Couto), Contini, Pasquale; Bresciano (31’s.h. P.
