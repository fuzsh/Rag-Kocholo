        "text": "GOALKEEPERS\n\n1-Dida. Age 31. After a shaky start to his career at Milan, the Brazilian has been the first choice throughout Carlo Ancelotti's reign and is widely regarded as one of the top keepers in the world. Superb on his line and dominating the penalty area.\n\nChampions League\n\nLiverpool green light to defend title\n\n10/06/2005 at 15:12\n\n17-Christian Abbiati. Age 27. Former Italy Under-21 keeper who was a young member of Milan's title-winning side in 1999. Abbiati's career has been at a standstill for the past three seasons after he lost his place to Dida. His future probably lies away from Milan but he would be an able deputy for the Brazilian if called on.\n\nDEFENDERS\n\n2-Cafu. Age 34. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said Cafu \"must have two hearts\" after one of the Brazilian's best performances this season when he showed that despite his age he remains one of the fittest and quickest fullbacks around. A major contributor to Milan's attacks he can however leave gaps behind him. The only man to play in three successive World Cup finals.\n\n3-Paolo Maldini. Age 36. Now operating at centre-half rather than left-back, Maldini aims to captain his side back to the top of Europe for the fifth time in his career, after European Cup wins in 1989, 1990, 1994 and 2003. Despite his years shows no signs of losing the qualities that have made him one of Europe's top defenders over the past 15 years.\n\n13-Alessandro Nesta. Age 29. \"Signor Cool\" - Nesta's reading of the game is what makes him such an outstanding defender with his ability to intercept meaning he rarely has to show his ability in the last-ditch tackle. As strong in the air as on the ground. Milan's defence never looks as secure when he is missing.\n\n4-Kakha Kaladze. Age 27. Georgian who has emerged as the successor to Maldini at left-back and hopes eventually to move across into the centre defence when the captain finally retires. The former Dynamo Kiev defender's progress has been hampered by injury problems in the past two seasons.\n\n14-Dario Simic. Age 29. An excellent man-marker, Simic was part of the Croatian team that finished third at the 1998 World Cup. After a promising start to his career at Milan, with him playing a major part in the 2003 Champions League triumph, the Croatian has had to settle for a back-up role. Can operate at right-back or in the centre of defence.\n\n31-Jaap Stam. Age 32. The powerful former Manchester United defender was signed from Lazio during the close season but injuries restricted the Dutchman's appearances in the first half of the campaign. After some impressive displays in Europe has come in for some criticism during Milan's recent slump in form.\n\n5-Alessandro Costacurta. Age 39. The former Italy international, once partner of Franco Baresi in the Milan defence, is looking to add to his career triumphs of seven Serie A titles and four European Cups. His contract will see him still a Milan player at the age of 40 and while he is these days used only for cover he rarely lets Ancelotti down when called upon to fill in.\n\n26-Giuseppe Pancaro. Age 33. After six seasons with Lazio, Pancaro joined Milan last season and surprised many by becoming a regular in the 'scudetto' winning side. Has struggled with injuries this season but when fit offers a more attacking option to Kaladze on the left.\n\nMIDFIELDERS\n\n8-Gennaro Gattuso. Age 27. Hard-tackling workhorse. Gattuso is the perfect complement to the creative touches of Clarence Seedorf and Andrea Pirlo in midfield. A fiery player who can also deliver the right pass at the right time, the former Glasgow Rangers midfielder has become a firm favourite among Milan fans.\n\n10-Rui Costa. Age: 33. The arrival of Brazilian Kaka last season saw former Fiorentina favourite Rui Costa often relegated to the bench and he is no longer a first-choice for Ancelotti. But he is still capable of making the difference with an incisive through ball or a smart change of direction but lacks the pace now to really penetrate opposition defences.\n\n20-Clarence Seedorf. Age 29. Seedorf has won the Champions League with three different clubs -- Ajax, Real Madrid and Milan and he is a player who often rises to the big occasion. His form has suffered in the latter part of this season but on his day he is vital for Milan with his bursts down the left and his powerful, long-range shooting.\n\n21-Andrea Pirlo. Age: 26. A deep-lying midfielder, with his quick, precise passing he is the pivot around which Ancelotti's team turns and the man who turns defence to attack. Milan struggle without him or when he is marked out of a match. First-choice penalty taker.\n\n23-Massimo Ambrosini. Age 27. Injured his left thigh against Lecce on Sunday and is now a doubt for the final. With Ancelotti's preference for three-man midfield based around Pirlo, the hardworking Ambrosini has been restricted to the bench for much of the past two seasons. Robust and aggressive, he is the perfect man for when the midfield battle gets gritty.\n\n27-Serginho. Age 33. The speedy Brazilian can operate anywhere on the left and even as a support striker. Frustratingly inconsistent, he can come into his own as a late substitute when his winding runs are a threat to tired defenders.\n\n32-Cristian Brocchi. Age 29. A useful back-up man, the former Inter midfielder can also fill in at right-back. Brocchi's main weapons are his running and a willingness to scrap for the ball. Happy if he gets a place on the bench.\n\n24-Vikash Dhorasoo. Age 31. A free transfer signing from Lyon, Dhorasoo struggled to break into the starting line-up during his first season but has showed up well on the rare occasions he has been given a chance. Offers an alternative to Seedorf on the left of midfield.\n\nFORWARDS\n\n7-Andriy Shevchenko. Age 28. The European Footballer of the Year has recovered from the fractured cheekbone which kept him out of action during a crucial stage of the season. At his best the Ukrainian international can do it all -- run with the ball, swerve round defenders, score from inside or outside the area or lob the keeper. A natural finisher who scored the decisive penalty when Milan beat Juventus in a shoot-out to win the European Cup in 2003.\n\n9-Filippo Inzaghi. Age 31. Another injury-plagued season for Inzaghi whose goals played a major role in the 2003 Champions League triumph. Unlike Shevchenko, Inzaghi plays on the limit of offside, using explosive speed to latch on to a pass or a cross and score from close range. Has returned to action just in time or the final.\n\n15-Jon Dahl Tomasson. Age 28. A free transfer signing from Feyenoord, the former Newcastle United striker has never been a regular at the San Siro but has made a useful contribution scoring some vital goals. His last-minute goal against Ajax in the quarter-finals two years ago was crucial, as was his injury time strike in the 2-0 win over PSV Eindhoven in the semi-final, first leg. Unselfish, he gives strong support to Shevchenko.\n\n11-Hernan Crespo. Age 29. Despite his 16 goals in all competitions, including the two goals in the 1-0 wins over Manchester United, the striker on loan from Chelsea still looks well short of the player who was such a fearsome presence for Parma and Lazio five years ago.\n\n22-Kaka. Age 23. Made a stunning impact last year, during his first season with the club, as his creative input helped Milan to the Italian title. Operating behind the main strikers, has struggled to build on that exciting debut campaign and cope with the close attentions of man-markers. Nonetheless in tight games he can be the man whose moment of inspiration changes a game.\n\nChampions League\n\nJohansson backs Liverpool\n\n07/06/2005 at 08:46\n\nChampions League\n\nJohansson backs Liverpool\n\n29/05/2005 at 11:52"
