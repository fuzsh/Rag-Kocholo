        "text": "LONDON — Only in Italy is defending revered so highly.\n\nA.C. Milan, itself steeped in European glory, on Wednesday celebrated a goalless tie against Barcelona in the San Siro like a triumph. The heroes of the hour were, undoubtedly, the goalkeeper Christian Abbiati, whose saves were acrobatic, defiant and brave, and Luca Antonini, whose timing in the tackle reminded us of the great Milan defenders, Franco Baresi and Paolo Maldini.\n\nOne block by Antonini midway through the first half encapsulated defense as art.\n\nThe left back had seen his goalkeeper sprawl at full stretch to turn away a shot from Lionel Messi. As the ball ran loose, Antonini sensed the danger and seized the moment in the blink of an eye.\n\n“I saw Alexis Sánchez starting his run for the ball,” Antonini later said on television. “I was prompt enough to start running. He is very fast, but I managed to take him.” Correction: The Italian took the ball, not the man. Antonini threw his entire body between Sánchez and the ball, won it as clean as a whistle and raised his hand as if he had scored a winning goal.\n\nThe home crowd, 70,000 of them, roared approval.\n\n“I did celebrate,” admitted Antonini. “I thought it was an important action at a key moment.”\n\nAnd then this 29-year-old Italian defender summed up the meaning of denying the best attack in the world a shot on his goal. “I always watched Barcelona’s stars on television, and play them on video,” he said. “But Milan proved we can hold out against them.\n\n“We have to play with the same spirit in the second leg in Barcelona. We have to repeat this performance next week.” There, in a sentence, is the Italian view of Barcelona. Holding Messi and Sánchez and Xavi and Co. is a measure of self-esteem. In truth, had Robinho and Zlatan Ibrahimovic not squandered easier chances than Barça had, this might have been the complete Italian job on the current European champion.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
