I am honored to announce that I have been named the winner of the prestigious Franco Abbiati award, in the category of Best Female Singer, here in Italy.

This great honor was bestowed upon me by the Associazione Nazionale Critici Musicali, and I am a most grateful recipient. Thank you so very much!
