Born in St Petersburg, Olga Peretyatko began her career in the children’s choir of the Mariinsky Theatre, before studies in Berlin and training with the Opera Studio at the Staatsoper Hamburg. Her victory in the Operalia competition propelled her to the forefront of the stage, a position she has held ever since. The soprano is now one of the most fervent representatives of bel canto in the world, but also a personality with unerring adaptability and intense acting, making the most eminent opera programmes a delight. A Franco Abbiati Prize, notable roles in Le Nozze di Figaro, Die Zauberflöte and Anna Bolena, as well as an enlightened interpretation of the Four Women (Les Contes d’Hoffmann) have confirmed her international reputation in recent years.
