        "text": "AKA Samuel Shepard Rogers III\n\nBorn: 5-Nov-1943\n\nBirthplace: Fort Sheridan, IL\n\nDied: 27-Jul-2017\n\nLocation of death: Midway, KY\n\nCause of death: Lou Gehrig's Disease\n\nGender: Male\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Playwright, Actor\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: Buried Child\n\nPlaywright and movie star Sam Shepard worked as a ranch hand in his teen years, and after high school he briefly attended college, majoring in agriculture, but dropped out to join a traveling theater group. He sidestepped the Vietnam-era draft by claiming to be a heroin addict, and by 1963 he was working as a busboy in a Greenwich Village bar, doing plenty of drugs and becoming involved in the city's off-off-Broadway theater scene.\n\nShepard's first few short plays were savagely reviewed in major papers, but won good notices in the alternative paper The Village Voice. He won three consecutive OBIEs for writing in the mid-1960s, and contributed a few comic sketches for the limply plotted \"erotic musical\" Oh! Calcutta!, which starred Bill Macy on Broadway. He won the Pulitzer Prize for his 1979 play Buried Child starring Mary McDonnell, and Drama Desk honors for his 1986 play A Lie of the Mind starring Harvey Keitel and Amanda Plummer. At last count, Shepard has won ten OBIEs.\n\nHis first film credit as writer was Me and My Brother, starring beat poets Allen Ginsberg and Peter Orlovsky as themselves. His other screenplays include Michelangelo Antonioni's Zabriskie Point, Wim Wenders' wandering Paris, Texas starring Harry Dean Stanton, Robert Altman's Fool for Love starring Shepard and Kim Basinger, and his study of the difference between the real west and the Hollywood west, Don't Come Knocking starring Shepard and his longtime love Jessica Lange.\n\nHe made his debut as a screen actor in 1970's little-seen Brand X with Sally Kirkland and Abbie Hoffman. His best film performances include the fading mysterious farmer infatuated with Brooke Adams in Terrence Malick's masterpiece Days of Heaven, the lover of miracle-worker Ellen Burstyn in Resurrection, the reporter who falls for the unjustly declared insane Frances Farmer in Frances, the testosterone-drenched astronaut Chuck Yeager in The Right Stuff, the distant commander of a military mission gone wrong in Black Hawk Down witj Ewan McGregor, and Ryan Gosling's devoted father in The Notebook.\n\nHis sister is singer-songwriter Sandy Rogers, best known for writing the songs in Fool for Love and her album Green Moon. His other sister, Roxanne Rogers, is an erstwhile actress best known for the low-budget film Slow Moves. His son, Jesse Mojo Shepard, is named after the outlaw Jesse James and a Cajun good luck charm, and is the author of Jubilee King. Sam Shepard also plays the drums, and has performed with Bob Dylan and T-Bone Burnett.\n\nFather: Samuel Shepard Rogers VI (military officer-farmer, b. 3-Feb-1917, d. 1984 fire)\n\nMother: Jane Elaine Schook Rogers (b. 16-Jul-1917)\n\nSister: Sandy Rogers (singer-songwriter)\n\nSister: Roxanne Rogers (stage director)\n\nWife: O-Lan Jones (actress, m. 9-Nov-1969, sep. 1982, div. 1984, one son)\n\nSon: Jesse Mojo Shepard (author, b.
