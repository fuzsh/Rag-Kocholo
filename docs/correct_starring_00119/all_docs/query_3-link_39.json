        "text": "The idea of genius is mentioned so frequently that it sometimes feels like its lost all meaning as a signifier of greatness. Such was not the case for legendary playwright, screenwriter, and actor Sam Shepard, who passed away at the age of 73 following a battle with ALS. For Shepard, genius didn’t even begin to cover it — his enviable, prolific creative life never stopped moving forward or transmuting. As the author of more than 40 plays (including 1978’s BURIED CHILD, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Drama), the screenwriter behind enigmatic cult films such as ZABRISKIE POINT and PARIS, TEXAS, and as a performer working with iconic directors like Terrence Malick and Ridley Scott, Sam Shepard embodied both the vanishing cowboy archetype of America’s past and the punk playwright of its future. That Shepard was able to straddle those lines without ever being anyone besides his authentic self is nothing short of incredible.\n\nBorn in Fort Sheridan, Illinois, Shepard’s upbringing in a transient military family with “a dedicated alcoholic” as a father would go onto inform much of his later work, especially his iconic Family trilogy. The theater bug first bit Shepard (who was studying to be a veterinarian at the time) in 1961, when he joined Bishop’s Company Repertory Players, a traveling company. This decision would eventually bring him to New York City, and Greenwich Village, where he first worked as a busboy at the iconic Village Gate nightclub. Here, Shepard began his work as a playwright in earnest, and his first two plays, COWBOYS and THE ROCK GARDEN, were produced in 1964. Over the next four years, Shepard’s staged plays would win six OBIE Awards (including an unprecedented three awards in 1967 for CHICAGO, ICARUS’ MOTHER, and RED CROSS) and in 1968, Shepard received grants from both the Rockefeller and Guggenheim Foundations to continue his work as a playwright.\n\nShepard’s first cinematic work came in 1970, as one of many screenwriters credited on Antonioni’s ZABRISKIE POINT. Around that time, Shepard found a kindred spirit in punk priestess Patti Smith — though Shepard was already married to actress O-Lan Jones, his romantic and creative partnership with Smith would manifest itself in 1971’s COWBOY MOUTH, which he co-wrote and co-starred in with Smith. They remained friendly even after their romance ended, with Shepard contributing banjo to Smith’s 2007 cover of “Smells Like Teen Spirit.” Here’s Smith on Shepard from JUST KIDS —\n\n“When we got to the part where we had to improvise an argument in a poetic language, I got cold feet. “I can’t do this,” I said. “I don’t know what to say.”\n\n“Say anything,” he said. “You can’t make a mistake when you improvise.”\n\n“What if I mess it up? What if I screw up the rhythm?”\n\n“You can’t,” he said. “It’s like drumming. If you miss a beat, you create another.”\n\nIn this simple exchange, Sam taught me the secret of improvisation, one that I have accessed my whole life.”\n\nIn 1974, Shepard joined the Magic Theater in San Francisco as their playwright-in-residence. Shepard would create his most iconic plays while working at the Magic — CURSE OF THE STARVING CLASS, BURIED CHILD, and TRUE WEST — though not before taking some time to tour as a member of Bob Dylan’s Rolling Thunder Revue (and serving as one of the de facto screenwriters for Dylan’s never-officially-released RENALDO AND CLARA.) With the Family trilogy, Shepard was able to peel back the skin on the working-class American nuclear family in a way never before seen in American theater, and his themes of isolation, wanderlust, class, emasculation, and shame are timeless in their universality. 1978 marked a major turning point for Shepard — BURIED CHILD debuted to spectacular praise before eventually winning the Pulitzer for Drama in 1979, and Shepard made his Hollywood breakthrough thanks to a tragic, restrained performance in Terrence Malick’s DAYS OF HEAVEN.\n\nShepard would continue expanding his work in the film industry in the 1980s, especially following the beginning of his twenty-seven year romance with Jessica Lange in 1982 after they co-starred in FRANCES. Shepard and Lange would remain frequent collaborators throughout their relationship, starring in COUNTRY, CRIMES OF THE HEART, and DON’T COME KNOCKING together. In 1983, Shepard moved into the director’s chair for his newest play, FOOL FOR LOVE, which was later turned into a film by Robert Altman. Despite a lifelong fear of flying, starring as Chuck Yeager in THE RIGHT STUFF brought Shepard his first taste of critical acclaim as an actor, and he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1984. That same year, Shepard turned his MOTEL CHRONICLES into PARIS, TEXAS for director Wim Wenders — it won the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 1985, and has become one of the most beloved films of the last forty years.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, Shepard became an in-demand actor while continuing to work as a screenwriter, playwright, and teacher. I first fell in love with Shepard as one of cinema’s finest ne’er-do-well husbands in STEEL MAGNOLIAS, where he brings a great deal of gravitas to what could be an otherwise forgettable role opposite Dolly Parton. In 1987’s BABY BOOM, Shepard plays THE platonic ideal of a romantic comedy “new man” alongside Diane Keaton — it’s one of the most lived-in romantic relationships in any rom-com. More recently, Shepard’s work as a beleaguered father in the criminally underrated COLD IN JULY was key to that film’s success — Shepard’s presence in any movie always lended the whole undertaking more credibility.\n\nSam Shepard never stopped creating — his latest collection, THE ONE INSIDE, debuted in February, he appears in the final season of BLOODLINE on Netflix, and will appear in NEVER HERE later this year. For Shepard, the drive simply to see what would happen next kept him going professionally and personally, as he told the New York Times in 2012:\n\n“In real life we don’t know what’s going to happen next. So how can you be that way on a stage? Being alive to the possibility of not knowing exactly how everything is going to happen next — if you can find places to have that happen onstage, it can resonate with an experience of living.”\n\nShepard’s death feels emblematic of the loss of a certain kind of American dude — that rare mix of an Old West cowboy, a downtown poet, the wisest barfly you could ever meet, and the best single dad on your block. Shepard came of age in a time when one could be a musician, an actor, a poet, and a playwright without question, and his long, storied career — one that refused to be kept in a neat little box — is the stuff that dreams are made of. Shepard’s staggering creative output should serve as a message to writers that in order to survive as a creative, you must, above all else, keep creating, and keep putting words on the page.\n\nShepard is survived by his three children, Jesse, Hannah, and Samuel. And lest we let anyone besides Shepard get the last word in —\n\n“I hate endings. Just detest them. Beginnings are definitely the most exciting, middles are perplexing and endings are a disaster. The temptation towards resolution, towards wrapping up the package, seems to me a terrible trap. Why not be more honest with the moment? The most authentic endings are the ones which are already revolving towards another beginning. That’s genius.”\n\nA long reading from Sam Shepard at Trinity College in 2012\n\nShepard on his Family plays from PBS: Great Performances\n\nThe 1986 Rolling Stone Interview\n\nIt’s one of cinema’s most iconic images: two young men and a young woman race down a bridge, cackling and having the sort of fun that only seems possible on celluloid. Without the presence of legendary French actress Jeanne Moreau, the infectious joy felt in this moment from Francois Truffaut’s JULES ET JIM would feel tempered somehow. But with Moreau leading the charge, it’s pure bliss as we zoom down the bridge, gasping right along with the lovers. Moreau brought that sense of bliss to even her darkest roles, and it feels as if a bright light has been extinguished with her passing — as a major star of French New Wave, saying goodbye to Moreau feels like saying goodbye to another major piece of that cinematic movement.\n\nAn award-winning actress, singer, and filmmaker, Jeanne Moreau was born in Paris and raised there and in Vichy before a performance of ANTIGONE at sixteen set her on the path of an actor. Much of Moreau’s early work took place on stage — in 1949, she made her debut at Comédie-Française in A MONTH IN THE COUNTRY, and her reputation within the theater world only grew from there. In 1958, Moreau moved from the stage to the cinema, with two major roles in Louis Malle movies: ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS and THE LOVERS. These performances became the catalyst to Moreau’s life in film, as she found herself perfectly positioned for the incoming French New Wave — she became one of the movement’s most iconic stars thanks to her smoky voice, vivacious grin, and that kind of cool girl French attitude most of us only can dream of.\n\nJeanne Moreau’s filmography is in and of itself an incredible film school syllabus: JULES ET JIM for Truffaut, a meta-cameo in A WOMAN IS A WOMAN for Godard, Antonioni’s LA NOTTE, THE TRIAL and CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT for Orson Welles, Jacques Demy’s BAY OF ANGELS, DIARY OF A CHAMBERMAID for Luis Bunel, THE LAST TYCOON for Eliza Kazan, QUERELLE for Rainer Werner Fassbinder, NIKITA for Luc Besson, and UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD for Wim Wenders are only some of Moreau’s incredible credits throughout her nearly seventy-year career. It’s no surprise that Orson Welles once called Moreau “the greatest actress in the world” given her endless curiosity as an actor. At one point, Moreau was considered for Mrs. Robinson in THE GRADUATE, a move that would’ve undoubtedly made her a superstar stateside as well.\n\nBut Moreau wasn’t satisfied with only being in front of the camera — she directed two features in the late 1970s, LUMIERE and THE ADOLESCENT, as well as a documentary about actress Lillian Gish. And, Moreau was an accomplished singer too: after decades of singing on film for various roles, she released several albums throughout the 1990s, eventually performing with none other than Frank Sinatra at Carnegie Hall. In 2001, Moreau was also the very first woman inducted into France’s Academy of Fine Arts, nearly 200 years after the organization’s founding.\n\nMoreau was acting up until 2015, with her final role in THANKS TO MY FRIENDS marking her 145th credit as an actor. Like Sam Shepard, Moreau was always moving forward, and never stopped in one place for too long —because Moreau was always willing to evolve with the times, she became timeless. This is echoed in Moreau’s own mantra: “The life you had is nothing. It is the life you have that is important.”\n\nEven after such a storied career and countless tributes and awards, Jeanne Moreau knew that reveling in nostalgia for the French New Wave that made her an international star would only mean stagnation for the rest of her creative career:\n\n“Nostalgia for what? Nostalgia is when you want things to stay the same. I know so many people staying in the same place. And I think, my God, look at them! They’re dead before they die. That’s a terrible risk. Living is risking.”\n\nRoger Ebert interviews Jeanne Moreau about her directorial debut in 1976\n\nA rare, candid interview about love, work, and war with the New York Times in 2001\n\nMoreau talks with Hans Ulrich Obrist in 2012"
