        "text": "When lauded actor, director, and playwright Sam Shepard passed away earlier this year, he left behind a rich and varied legacy, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of pilot Chuck Yeager in “The Right Stuff,” forty-four plays, as well as several books, including short stories, essays, and memoirs, and a Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1979 for his play “Buried Child.” He also left behind at least one new feature, Camille Thoman’s feature debut, “Never Here.”\n\nThe film follows Mireille Enos as Miranda, an installation artist whose latest project involves photographing strangers. It’s an intriguing premise, but one made even more compelling by Miranda’s own complex life — the kind that few people would want documented, oddly enough — including a secret love affair that leads to Miranda posing as a witness to save her man. Along the way, she becomes entangled in some very unexpected consequences, at least one of which involves Shepard’s mysterious character.\n\nThe film’s official synopsis touts its status as a “taut psychological thriller, with sumptuous imagery and sonic clues that steadily seep into the subconscious mind,” and the film’s first trailer pushes that to wild new ends. Check out the first trailer for “Never Here,” courtesy of EW, below. The film will hit theaters on October 20."
