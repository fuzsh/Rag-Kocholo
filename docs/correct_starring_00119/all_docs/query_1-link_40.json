        "text": "Sam Shepard: biography\n\nSam Shepard's biography begins when he was born on 5 November 1943 in Fort Sheridan, Illinois. He was an American actor, playwright and theatre director. Shepard is most acclaimed for his playwriting and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1979 for the play Buried Child (1978). Shepard's plays often take a dark and modern look at the American West, distorting the familiar images of cowboys and homesteads. Sam Shepard had written over 50 plays and several books, both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nSam Shepard was born into a military family which meant that he moved across the United States while young. The family moved to an avocado farm in Duarte, California. In California Shepard took on various ranch jobs including sheep shearing and orange picking. He briefly attended Saint Antonio college studying agriculture before dropping out and moving to New York in 1962.\n\nIn 1963 Shepard started writing a series of one-act plays in off-off-Broadway productions. The plays brought Shepard attention and, in 1966, he won the OBIE Awards for the plays Icarus's Mother (1965), Red Cross (1966) and Chicago(1965). In 1971 Shepard moved to England and lived there for the next three years while continuing to write and produce plays in London. He returned to the United States to become Playwright in Residence at the Magic Theatre in 1974.\n\nOff-off-Broadway: productions that are shown in small theatres away from New York City's famous theatre district, Broadway. These theatres usually have less than 100 seats.\n\nTowards the late 1970s, Sam Shepard's plays broached more conventional subjects, particularly family drama. Three such plays were Curse of the Starving Class (1977), Buried Child (1978) and True West (1980), Buried Child won Sam Shepard the Pulitzer Prize. Shepard also began acting again during this productive period, notably in the films Days of Heaven (1978) and The Right Stuff (1983).\n\nSam Shepard continued to write plays and act to great acclaim up until the twenty-first century. From the 1980s onwards Shepard also turned his hand to writing prose fiction with books such as The Motel Chronicle (1983) and Hawk Moon (1985). Sam Shepard died on the 27th July 2017 from ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis).\n\nThe plays of Sam Shepard\n\nSam Shepard wrote over fifty-five plays in a career spanning fifty-three years. This section will look at some of Shepard's most successful plays.\n\nBuried Child\n\nSam Shepard's 1978 play is perhaps his most successful, first opening at the Magic Theatre in San Francisco and winning the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. The play also garnered Shepard national attention. The play takes place during an economic slump in rural America and deals with a family's struggle to deal with the mythic American Dream. The family are headed by the alcoholic Dodge and his wife Halie. Their farm is struggling when their grandson Vince returns only to not be recognised by his family. Vince's return causes the family to unearth a grievous secret.\n\nThe American Dream is the idea that anybody is able to become successful in the United States of America. There is a suggestion that there are no social barriers that cannot be overcome by hard work and ambition.\n\nTrue West\n\nProduced during Shepard's run as playwright in residence at the Magic Theatre in 1980, True West is considered the final part of his 'family trilogy'. the story concerns two brothers who have been long parted and consider each other rivals. Austin is a clean-cut screenwriter and successful, While his older brother Lee is a vagrant and a thief. While Austin is housesitting for their mother he attempts to write a screenplay but is constantly distracted by Lee. The play focuses on the power struggle between the two brothers as they collaborate on the screenplay.\n\nFool For Love (1983)\n\nLike many of Shepard's most successful plays, Fool For Love premiered in San Francisco's Magic Theatre. The play focuses on the intense but highly troubled relationship between May and Eddie. The story begins when cowboy drifter Eddie turns up at a motel that May is staying in. The play was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize and won the OBIE award for Best New American Play. The play was later adapted to film with Shepard himself playing the role of Eddie.\n\nSam Shepard: books\n\nSam Shepard was not only a prolific playwright but also often wrote prose and several memoirs. This section will look at some of the books written by Sam Shepard.\n\nMotel Chronicles and Hawk Moon (1985)\n\nTwo books that were republished together in 1985, Motel Chronicles and Hawk Moon is a mixture of autobiography, poetry and fiction. It details events in Sam Shepard's early life and his time as a playwright. It includes childhood memories of his time in Illinois and his life as a teenager in rural California where Shepard took on an assortment of menial jobs. These memoirs are interspersed with poetry and dialogues. Parts of the book feature in the Wim Wender's film Paris, Texas (1984), which Shepard wrote the screenplay for.\n\nDays Out of Days (2010)\n\nDays Out of Days is a collection of short fiction written in Sam Shepard's later years. The stories are largely set in the American West, like many of his plays. The book also includes song lyrics and dialogues unused previously by Shepard. The book had been lauded for its lyricism and its attention to detail, which are considered trademarks of Sam Shepard.\n\nSam Shepard: director\n\nSam Shepard had not begun his career with the ambition to direct, however that changed towards the late 1970s. Shepard thought it necessary that his own direction was needed to carry out his visions for the plays he wrote. Sam Shepard only directed plays that he himself had written and never adapted the plays of other writers.\n\nFrom the 1970s onwards directed the majority of the plays he wrote, with some notable exceptions. His more conventional family trilogy, also his most successful plays, was directed by more accomplished directors that Shepard trusted. One such director was Robert Woodruff, who directed the highly successful Buried Child.\n\nSam Shepard also turned his hand to directing for film. Twice Shepard went behind the camera for the films Far North (1988) and Silent Tongue(1993). Silent Tongue is a drama set in the west starring Shepard's then-wife, actress Jessica Lange. Far North has been described as an American western horror. Neither film found Shepard the success he had writing plays or acting himself.\n\nSam Shepard: actor\n\nSam Shepard was an actor in over fifty films and also had substantial roles on television. On top of his success writing and directing plays, Shepard was also an accomplished actor. Shepard was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He was nominated for his role as the test pilot Chuck Yeager in the Philip Kauffman film The Right Stuff (1983).\n\nShepard's first film role of note was in the Terence Malik drama Days of Heaven (1978). Shepard played a dying farmer caught in a love triangle between himself Richard Gere and Brooke Adams. Shepard also starred in a leading man in Robert Altman's adaptation of his own play Fool For Love (1986).
