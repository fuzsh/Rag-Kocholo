        "text": "SAM SHEPARD: STALKING HIMSELF\n\nA documentary film / autobiography of Sam Shepard, with selections from his plays and prose in performances by Ethan Hawke, Ed Harris, Gary Sinise and Vincent D’Onofrio. Shepard takes us on a quest into the idea of self, family and identity and a journey into the heartland of America – the landscape, the anxieties, and the music. The Signature Theatre presents a full season of Shepard’s plays, spanning thirty years of writing. In his only extensive interview on film, Sam Shepard speaks eloquently about the process of writing and the origins of his work.\n\nThe official website for the film is HERE.\n\nPremiered on PBS’ Great Performances"
