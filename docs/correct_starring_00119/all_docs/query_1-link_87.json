One really great thing happened was that I discovered Chekhov’s short stories.”\n\nSam Shepard\n\nWhen I was in film school back in the early eighties I don’t think there was anyone cooler than Sam Shepard. He had toured with Bob Dylan in early 70s, become a well-known New York City playwright in late 70s, and in the 80s became a screenwriter and a movie star.\n\nThe above scene is from The Right Stuff (1983) for which he received an Oscar-nomination for his role as pilot Chuck Yeager. Others may know of Shepard for his roles in Black Hawk Down, Days of Heaven, Francis, or most recently in TV program Bloodline—or his long relationship with actress Jessica Lange.\n\nBack in 2011 in a post called Sam Shepard’s Start I pulled an extended quote where he talked about his early roots:\n\n“I got a job delivering papers in Pasadena, and pretty soon, by reading the ad sections, I found out about an opening with a traveling ensemble called the Bishop’s Company. I decided to give it a shot, thinking that this might be a way to really get out. At the audition they gave me a little Shakespeare thing to read—I was so scared I read the stage directions—and they hired me. I think they hired everyone.\n\n“We traveled all over the country—New England, the South, the Midwest. I think the longest we stayed anywhere was two days. It was actually a great little fold-up theater. We were totally self-sufficient, we put up the lights, made the costumes, performed the play, and shut down. Anyway, one day we got to New York to do a production at a church in Brooklyn and I said, ‘I’m getting off the bus.’\n\n“…I was staying on Avenue C and Tenth Street with a bunch of jazz musicians, one whom happened to be Charlie Mingus’s son. We knew each other from high school, and he got me a job as a busboy at the Village Gate. The headwaiter at the Gate was a guy named Ralph Cook. Ralph was just starting his theater at St. Mark’s in the Bowery, and he said he’d heard that I’d been writing some stuff, and he wanted to see it. So, I showed him a few plays I’d written, and he said, ‘Well, let’s do it.’ Things kind of took off from there. New York was like that in the sixties. You could write a one-act play and start doing it the next day. You could go to one of those theaters—Genesis, La Mama, Jusdon Poets—and find a way to get in done. Nothing like that exists today.”\n\nPulitzer Prize winning playwright Sam Shepard (and actor/screenwriter/director)\n\nPlaywrights at Work\n\nI hope those of you starting out find that helpful and track down more of Shepard’s theater and film work. A good place to start would be his play Buried Child for which he won a Pulitzer Prize in 1979. Shepard also wrote the script for Paris, Texas — winner of the Palme d’Or at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival."
