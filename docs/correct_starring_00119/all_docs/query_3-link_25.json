        "text": "Sam Shepard‘s death Thursday spurred an outpouring of old Hollywood memories from some of the industry’s biggest stars, including Alyssa Milano, Antonio Banderas and Jason Alexander.\n\nShepard died at his Kentucky home surrounded by loved ones, his family announced Monday. The celebrated playwright and actor had been battling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, family spokesperson Chris Boneau told ABC News. He was 73.\n\nOver the course of his prolific career, Shepard wrote more than 40 plays and won the Pulitzer Prize for his drama, Buried Child, in 1979. He is one of the most influential early writers in the Off Broadway movement, and had a particular knack for capturing the darker side of American family life. (Common themes included combative spouses, siblings struggling to find their identities and the failed American Dream.)\n\nShepard also displayed his talents on-screen as well, most notably in his Oscar-nominated role in 1983’s The Right Stuff, as well as 1986’s Crimes of the Heart, 1989’s Steel Magnolias and 1999’s Dash and Lilly. He most recently starred in Netflix’s 2015 Bloodline and had a role in this year’s Never Here, which hit theaters this past June.\n\nHe has worked with actors ranging from Julia Roberts, Diane Keaton and Sissy Spacek to John Malkovich, Meryl Streep and Richard Gere.\n\nTrending\n\nShepard had a high-profile romance with Oscar-winning actress Jessica Lange from 1982 to 2009, and the pair welcomed two children. The actor also has a son from a previous relationship.\n\nHe is survived by his children – Jesse, Hannah and Walker Shepard – and his sisters, Sandy and Roxanne Rogers."
