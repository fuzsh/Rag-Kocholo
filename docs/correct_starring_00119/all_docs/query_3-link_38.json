        "text": "I recently purchased a used copy of This So-Called Disaster, a documentary with such an unclear storyline that it’s difficult to get out of your head. The film documents the last few weeks of rehearsal for Sam Shephard’s 2000 play “The Late Henry Moss,” starring Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, James Gammon, and Woody Harrelson. From what I gathered from the rehearsal footage the play follows a drunken old man (Gammon) who may or may not be deceased. His two sons (Penn and Nolte) seem to have some resentment toward each other as well and that’s about all I could really make out of the plot. This is why the documentary was so fascinating to me; it was like being a voyeur on a dream production. The actors are some of the best ever and I have always admired Sam Shepard, a native of the West that seems as if he were born two centuries too late.\n\nThe film explores the rehearsal period extensively, inter-cutting interviews with the cast and Shepard, who also wrote the play based on experiences he had with his father just before he died in 1984. The play took more than a decade to write and was tossed aside multiple times. Clearly Shephard’s passion for this particular production exceeds his dedication to any of his pervious works. There is a focus in his direction that appears to engulf him. His eyes are transfixed on his actors and he examines them with such definite attention. He may scratch his face or brush back his hair but he will not take his eyes away from the stage as he watches his work turn to life. Insightful interviews lead to confessions about the relationship between he and his father, leading up to the final meeting between father and son.\n\nWhat is so fascinating about the documentary is hard to explain. It is exhilarating to observe such amazing actors prepare for Shepard’s play. Penn brings an intensity on such a consistent basis that it’s difficult to imagine the man even sitting down to memorize his lines; they seem imprinted in his head. We get to see Nolte barking his dialogue with a concentrated anger, often having the appearance that he is intoxicated, but we realize it’s all just part of the act. The actor that seems to have the most complex role in the play is James Gannon, who plays the late Henry Moss himself. The man is a true alcoholic, complete with a poisoned soul and a disorganized consciousness. Throughout the play he must present himself in disarray, shedding all of his motor skills from scene to scene.\n\nBut the truly interesting element of This So-Called Disaster is the man behind the play; Sam Shepard. I have always been fascinated by his acting (I thought he was particularly strong in Hamlet with Ethan Hawke) but I remained curious about his plays. It never dawned on me to go and seek out a Shepard play somewhere on or off Broadway. I prefer the movie theatre and that’s just how I am. But this documentary really sparked my interest because the stage is where most great actors get their start, not being discovered by some model scouts in a mall somewhere in the Midwest. The stage is live. It’s real. It’s acting from the soul. You can see just how fierce and raw the performances are just by viewing their performances. And there’s Sam Shepard, concentrating on every beat, every mannerism, and every spoken word, seeking perfection from his story.\n\nThis So-Called Disaster blends the rehearsal footage with interviews with Shepard, as well as a brief biography. The editing and storyline of the documentary is unorthodox in that the cutaways often don’t come at any particularly appropriate time. We often are confused about the linear story of “The late Henry Moss” and are forced to gather what we can along the way. It makes the feature more interesting I think. But what the Shepard interviews do so well is chip away at him and his past. Slowly we see new layers to him, some things that he wants us to know and others that we can only imagine. His father is certainly heavily based on Henry Moss, the reckless drunk who is unsure if he is even alive anymore, but the Penn and Nolte characters are more ambiguous. Shepard did not have a brother. Instead he had two sisters. Gammon speculates that the two brothers represent two sides of Shepard. We may never know.\n\nIt is emotional to sit with Shepard out on a porch overlooking the desolate land of the Midwest as he recounts certain moments in his past. As a character study alone This So-Called Disaster does some fine work examining the background of a playwright. It is interesting to listen to the story of Shepard’s father, who led a very troubled life, culminating with his untimely death. Shepard even shares his last encounter with his father, one that is touching in the way that it’s told so humbly. The most stirring sequence may in fact be the film’s closing, a montage of photographs of Shepard and his late father, perhaps in better times but probably not. We know Shepard’s demons are there. We see them being presented on stage at a feverish pitch, only we may never know just how deep they go."
