        "text": "JEFFREY BROWN:\n\nAmong them, \"Buried Child,\" which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1979, and \"True West\" and \"Fool for Love\" both nominated for Pulitzers.\n\nShepard appeared in a film version of \"Fool for Love\" in 1985.\n\nSAM SHEPARD:\n\nOK, twice.\n\nBorn Steve Rogers in 1943, Shepard was the son of an Army officer who Sam later described as — quote — \"a drinking man, a dedicated alcoholic.\"\n\nAnd many of Shepard's characters are loners and drifters. In a 1998 documentary on \"Great Performances,\" Shepard spoke of his writing and coming to terms with his own family history.\n\nSAM SHEPARD:\n\nIt suddenly occurred to me that I was maybe avoiding a territory that I needed to investigate, which is the family. And I had avoided it for quite a while, because, to me, there was a danger in — I was a little afraid of it, you know, particularly my old man and all that emotional territory, you know?\n\nI didn't really want to tiptoe in there. And then I thought, well, maybe I better.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN:\n\nMany others would follow, including the recent Netflix series \"Bloodline.\"\n\nA man of many roles and talents — he published a work of fiction earlier this year — Shepard wrote more than 45 plays in all. Many of them continue to be performed regularly around the country and abroad. Shepard had three children, two from his 30-year relationship with the actress Jessica Lange.\n\nSam Shepard died Thursday at his home in Kentucky of complications from ALS, known as Lou Gehrig's disease. He was 73 years old.\n\nAnd now to some thoughts from another leading playwright, screenwriter and actor, Tracy Letts. He won a Tony Award for his performance in a revival of \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" and the Pulitzer Prize for his drama \"August: Osage County.\" Sam Shepard appeared in the 2013 film version.\n\nTracy Letts, thanks for joining us.\n\nWhat did Sam Shepard bring to American theater? How do you define that voice?\n\nTRACY LETTS, Playwright:\n\nSam's voice was very singular. It was very distinctive, like all great writers.\n\nAnd he synthesized a lot of different elements, European avant-garde, rock 'n' roll, cowboy movies, poetry, and a working-class sensibility. He synthesized all of that.\n\nAnd when it came out in his writing, it was such a new and exciting and individual and true voice.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN:\n\nI wonder what stands out to you in terms of the writing or structure of the plays?\n\nI read an interview he did where he talked about, in the early '70s, discovering the Greek tragedies and how really they were accessible and rather straightforward family dramas full of an idea of destiny. Does that sound right to you?\n\nTRACY LETTS:\n\nYes, I think the moment at which he started to become a more mainstream writer, or at least his avant-garde sensibilities started to include classic family drama, what American family drama is based on, of course, the Greeks, and at the point which he started to bring that into his work, that is the point at which he seemed to find greater success, though he never lost his avant-garde sensibilities and his poetic voice.\n\nTRACY LETTS:\n\nWell, I love the early work.\n\nI love some of the early rock 'n' roll work like \"Tooth of Crime,\" but \"Buried Child\" certainly seemed to be — really seemed to be what he was getting at. And a lot of the plays after \"Buried Child\" seemed to continue to explore some of the themes. \"Buried child\" is a great, great American play.\n\nTRACY LETTS:\n\nOh, certainly not.\n\nI think it's one of the — not only one of the reasons he was such a singular talent himself, but it speaks to the influence he had. Certainly, you know, I'm speaking to you from Chicago. This is home of Steppenwolf Theatre and Remains Theatre.\n\nAnd so much of that theater, I mean, Sam Shepard was the perfect playwright. I think, to this day, he's one or two on our list at Steppenwolf of most produced playwrights, because he was writing about people from the middle of the country, people we knew, that you could make great drama, and you didn't have to do it on the East Coast, and you didn't have to do it with an Ivy League education.\n\nThat meant the world to me and hordes of actors here in this part of the country."
