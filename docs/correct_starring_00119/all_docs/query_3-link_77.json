        "text": "raisers.\"\n\nSmith fell deeply in love with Shepard . . . she was so infatuated with the playwright that she even staged her own public rite d'amour by having an Italian gypsy named Vali give them both tattoos (hers was a lightning bolt [on her knee], his a hawk moon) while Sandy Daley made a film of it. . .\n\nAt each stage of her life Smith managed to align herself with a man whose interests reflected her own. Now that she was attempting to combine music and writing, Shepard was an ideal partner, for not only did he dream of being a rock and roll star himself, he also approached his plays almost as improvisational jazz; he was less interested in plot and characterization than in convulsive bursts of imagery.. He encouraged Smith to do lyrics for his play The Mad Dog Blues, while she urged him to write the prose poems that later appeared in Hawk Moon, which he dedicated to her. \"Sam loved my writing more than anyone I ever knew,\" Smith explained. \"He wasn't so supportive of some of the other things I was doing, like my singing and stuff, but he made me value myself as a writer.\"\n\nShepard was in the audience, along with Smith's other \"favorite guys\" -- Robert Mapplethorpe and Brice Marden -- when she made her public debut as a poet at St. Mark's Church on February 12, 1971. . . .\n\nSmith had no time to savor her success, for the relationship with Shepard had reached new heights of hysteria. Sometimes they lived in his room at the Chelsea, other times they stayed at the loft [the one Patti shared with Mapplethorpe], but no matter where they were, their activities and conversations were marked by a theatrical frenzy that was too intense for real life. \"I think Sam was terrible jealous of her talent,\" explained Ann Powell, Smith's friend from Scribner's. \"I remember a terrible scene when he destroyed some of her drawings, and she was absolutely crushed about it.\" Fittingly, the most accurate picture of their relationship is Cowboy Mouth, a play they wrote together in two nights by shoving an old typewriter back and forth between them. Smith's character, Cavale, is a deranged woman who kidnaps Slim from his wife and baby and attempts to turn him into a \"rock-n'-roll Jesus with a cowboy mouth.\" Slim accuses Cavale of ruining his life by continually tempting him with seductive dreams of stardom. \"You're twisting me up,\" he screams. \"You're tearing me inside out!\" In between shouting matches, Slim and Cavale order food from the Lobster Man, who eventually sheds his shell to become the rock-n'-roll savior himself. The play ends as Cavale sits at the edge of the stage delivering another monologue, and the Lobster Man points a gun to his head and pulls the trigger."
