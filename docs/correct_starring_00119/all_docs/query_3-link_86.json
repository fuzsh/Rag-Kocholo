        "text": "It's an absolute thrill for me, personally,\n\nto sit and talk with you.\n\nOh, thank you.\n\nI could talk about a million...\n\nYour writings, your movies, and, obviously\n\nyou're here for Cold in July, which is\n\na great, fun ride, where you don't know\n\nwhere it's going at any turn,\n\neven in the end.\n\nYeah.\n\nI don't know where I was, and I kind of just\n\nwanted to see more of it.\n\nSo, it's excellent.\n\nAnd I remember seeing here,\n\na couple of years ago, Mud.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nYeah. What about McConaughey? Huh? How do you\n\nfeel about that?\n\nWell, he's getting better and better.\n\nYeah, I'd say he's kind of having a McConaughssaince.\n\n(laughing)\n\nIt's really great to see an actor find himself, you know.\n\nIn his sojourn, you know.\n\nHave you seen Dallas Buyer's Club?\n\nNo, I haven't, but I can imagine.\n\nYeah. That's great he's getting all kinds\n\nof accolades.\n\nYeah.\n\nFor you, what is it that makes you gravitate\n\ntowards the parts that you do.\n\nI mean, recently, I, obviously saw you in Mud,\n\nand then you were in Osage County,\n\nand you're in this one.\n\nWhat is it that kind of drags you out of your house\n\nand makes you want to do a role?\n\nWell, it's usually the script.\n\nBut, sometimes it's just an actor you want to work with,\n\nor a director you want to work with, or,\n\nmaybe even a cinematographer, you know.\n\nMmm-Hmm.\n\nMaybe it's a whole variety of impulse, impulses, you know?\n\nDo you think you could ever do just the writing,\n\nand not the acting?\n\nWell, I did.\n\nI know, you've done it all. That's what I mean.\n\nDid you feel like, at a certain point,\n\nwhat made you get back into acting?\n\nIt's kind of a mystery to me that people find it\n\nso confusing that you act and you write.\n\nIt's been done for centuries, you know.\n\nIs it the same process for you, when you're writing\n\nand when you're acting?\n\nBasically? Same kind of...\n\nKind of...you know.\n\nBut because of the circumstances of each one.\n\nOne when you're sitting alone, normally, in a kitchen\n\nor something, with a typewriter.\n\nAnd the other one is you have to work with\n\na lot of other people.\n\nAnd those circumstances change the way you get into it.\n\nMmm-Hmm. And how is it working on this one in particular?\n\nOh! Well, one thing nobody talks about, hardly,\n\nis the budget was unbelievably low. Like, when we\n\nwere going into a gun fight scene,\n\nthey give you three cartridges, and they say,\n\nMake sure you make each one of these count.\n\nBecause it's going to be a big gun fight,\n\nbut you only have three cartridges.\n\nSo, things like that.\n\nOr, shooting bottles off the top of barrels,\n\nand what you don't see is a girl standing at the\n\ntop of a ladder with a fishing pole with fishing line.\n\nAnd she's popping each one of the bottles off\n\nas you shoot.\n\nWow, you didn't feel that at all.\n\nThat kind of stuff, you know. Yeah, right.\n\nSo it's very much a handmade movie.\n\nDo you still not fly?\n\nNo, I work a lot in Ireland, so...\n\nYou have to .\n\nI have to.\n\nHas it gotten easier?\n\nGotta get across the pond somehow.\n\nYeah. You don't want to be on the QE2?\n\nYeah (laughs).\n\nDo you have another book in you, do you think?\n\nYeah, I'm working on a book now.\n\nYou are?\n\nMmm-Hmm.\n\nExcellent.\n\nYeah, but, I'm determined to try to write some sustained\n\npiece of prose instead of something that's all broken up.\n\nStories and stuff like that.\n\nAnd, do you have to say no a lot?\n\nDo people come after you for, I would imagine, you'd\n\nbe very much in demand.\n\nIt's like your presence, I feel like, improves\n\nevery movie.\n\nOh, thanks. No, I mean I try not to be in situations where\n\nI'm being grabbed at, you know?\n\nAnd, for the most part, you can avoid them, you know?\n\nNot here, but elsewhere.\n\nHow do you avoid it?\n\nYou don't here.\n\nYou don't here.\n\nNo.\n\nHow is it here?\n\nIt's chaotic, crazy.\n\nEveryone sees your hair and you're\n\nimmediately recognized.\n\nYeah, well, it's just growing out, actually,\n\nfrom Cold in July.\n\nDid you have another thing that you're working on?\n\nFilm-Wise?\n\nYeah.\n\nI worked with Jeff Nichols on Mud, so I'm doing\n\nhis next movie.\n\nOh, you are?\n\nYeah.\n\nGreat. I look forward to that.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd this one, especially. Really fun,\n\ngreat character.\n\nEspecially that ending, but I'm not gonna give it away.\n\nOh, the ending is great, isn't it?\n\nIt's great. It's great.\n\nSomething happened, but he doesn't know what it is.\n\n(laughs)\n\nDidn't Dylan write that? I think so.\n\nYou still friends with him?\n\nYeah. I rarely see him, but I'm still friends with him.\n\nDo you see any of the people from that time?\n\nYeah.\n\nSo I guess it's kind of as cool as we imagined\n\nto be Sam Shepard, as it is to be Sam Shepard.\n\n(laughs)\n\nWell, it's great to see you.\n\nIt's a personal treat for me.\n\nThanks.\n\nIt's great. I'm just such a fan of all your stuff.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nI mean, I know you hear it all the time,\n\nbut I'm just gonna say it again.\n\nAppreciate it."
