        "text": "Zara Woodbridge, the daughter of Australian tennis doubles champion Todd, has taken another step towards forging her own career as a professional sportsperson.\n\nThe 14-year-old is a talented golfer and on Wednesday was included in Golf Victoria's six-girl state team.\n\nWoodbridge, from Royal Melbourne Golf Club, is the youngest player to represent Victoria in this year's Australian amateur championships and interstate series matches in South Australia in April.\n\nThat she was selected over some players three years older is an indication of how highly Golf Victoria considers her potential.\n\nShe took up the game aged seven, when her family lived next to a golf course in Florida in the US while her father was on the professional tennis circuit.\n\nShe says she liked watching tennis as a youngster, but never pursued playing seriously.\n\nTodd Woodbridge is a low handicapper at Royal Melbourne and has performed as \"caddie daddy\" for his daughter on occasions."
