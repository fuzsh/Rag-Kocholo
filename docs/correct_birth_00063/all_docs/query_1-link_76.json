        "text": "Tipping Point is the hit UK gameshow that has smashed TV ratings here as Aussies flock to Nine on weekdays at 5pm to play along with the homegrown version.\n\nNow, former-tennis-ace-turned-host Todd Woodbridge reveals he got the ultimate tick of approval for his new role from none other than Gold Logie-winning Sale Of The Century host Tony Barber!\n\n“When you see people who have worked in the industry for 20 or 30 years enjoying making a new show, you kind of know you’re onto a winner,” Todd, 53, tells Woman’s Day exclusively.\n\nWhen it comes to the show’s instant success, he’s not afraid to admit that his relaxed hosting style plays a part.\n\n“I think [it’s a success] because it’s new. And I don’t think I’ve tried to be somebody else,” he says.\n\nFRIENDLY RIVALRY\n\nHe’s not the only one in the hosting game though. And of his ratings opponent and host of Seven’s The Chase, Larry Emdur, 59, Todd reveals, “I wouldn’t call it a rivalry – I’ve known Larry the entire time I’ve worked in television.\n\n“I remember when I started with Seven back in 2006. He actually sent me a note the night the first episode was going to air, welcoming me to the five o’clock slot and hoping that we both could stay in there for many, many years together. I think that tells you everything about Larry.\n\n“So you know, there’s healthy competition from our networks. But when you’ve worked in the spaces that he and I have, we understand how important it is just to go and do your job well. And I think he’s a champion.”\n\nBut could Todd beat Larry in a Tipping Point showdown?\n\n“Um, probably not!” he laughs. “But maybe I’ve got the advantage in the sports, who knows. Both shows are successful in their own right.\n\n“And I’m pretty pleased that we’ve been able to create a show that the audience is enjoying as much, as opposed to going down that competitive route. This show has brought back a family-orientated feel.”\n\nTODD’S TOP TIPS FOR WINNING ‘TIPPING POINT’\n\nTodd’s got the top Tipping Point tips!\n\n• Know your trivia: Study up on your general knowledge. And if you really want to do well… mythology seems to get most people, and there are always mythology questions!\n\n• Study the board: You need to study the board. Study the shelves. And don’t go away from your plan when you get on the show."
