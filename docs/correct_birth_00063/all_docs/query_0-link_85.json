I'd like to\n\nexpand this with some nice info in an eMail which I kept an year ago - but\n\ncould not find on-line now. I had to do some research for a friend. His family is related to the\n\nWeizmanns from Motol. Chaim Weizmann, the first president of modern Israel,\n\nwas born in Motol, in today's Belarus. Searching for Weizmanns and Motol, I\n\ncame across this. The author of the eMail.mentioned quoted his uncle Aaron.\n\nAaron - believed to live across from the Weizmanns in Motol - said that\n\n\"the Weizmanns were so rich\" that....\n\n\"they had sugar in their tea every day.\" !!\n\nCertainly many of us take some things for granted nowadays - sugar, for\n\nexample. Extracting and refining sugar from sugar beet was the activity of\n\nsome of my family members. Probably, the Weizmann's sugar came from sugar\n\nbeet, too. By the way, I remember the tradition of cube-in-teeth and tea- in- tall-\n\nglasses (with and without handles) for family members originating as North\n\nas Vilna Gubernia and as South as Kremenchug, Ukraine.

You should change the spelling of LANDSLITE to LANDSLAYT (YIVO\n\northography), or at least to the German spelling LandsLeit. LANDSLITE is\n\natrocious! 2. I don't think that there is any connection between BRONSTEIN and\n\nBORNSTEIN. BORNSTEIN is sometimes spelled BORENSTEIN, but (as far as I\n\nknow) NEVER BRONSTEIN. They are completely different names (IMHO).\n\n3. In connection with the names Taiz or Deitz, see my attached file\n\nLandslayt.txt. That file contains a wealth of info on Teitz's from\n\nVileika. This info has lain dormant in my files for YEARS. This is the\n\nfirst time that I've ever disclosed it.\n\n4. Izenstatt is usually spelled Eisenstatt, and sometimes Aizenstat.\n\n5. Similarly, Inbinder is usually spelled Einbinder or Ainbinder. I know\n\nthat there was a Jack Einbinder in New Haven, Connecticut, whose\n\nbrother-in-law, Itzki Abelson, was from Dalhinev/Dolginovo.\n\n6. Please add a note to the webpage explaining that the \"Jewish\n\nScientific Institute (the I.V.A. in New York)\" is now called the YIVO\n\nInstitute for Jewish Research (www.yivoinstitute.org). The letters\n\n\"I.V.A.\" are really the Hebrew letters YUD (Yiddisher) VOV\n\n(Visnshaftlikher) and ALEPH (Institut) -- i.e., the Yiddisher\n\nVisnshaftlikher Institut, or the Yiddish (Jewish) Scientific Institute\n\n-- which was YIVO's original full name.\n\nRespectfully submitted, Jason I Alpert (Yos'l)\n\n~~~~~~ TOP of Landslayt.txt File ~~~~~~ ==== Landslayt (Expatriates) from VILEIKA (WILEJKA), Belorus ====\n\n================================================================\n\nNote that ADDRESSES and PHONE-NUMBERS given below are very OLD.\n\nMany of them are probably no longer current nor valid.\n\n================================================================ 1. Chava Teitz Her husband was: Frankel, Morris (Murray)\n\n65-24 162nd Street\n\nFlushing, New York 11365\n\n718-591-1847 Morris was an electrician, and was formerly secretary of the now defunct\n\nVILEIKER INDEPENDENT BENEVOLENT SOCIETY Morris was born about 1905. He was NOT from Vileika. (Only his late first wife Chava was from Vileika.) ****** Jason's Contacts with Morris Frankel ******\n\nll/25/1984: Jason first met Morris when Jason visited with him at the above address. (Jason had been told about him by the management of the New Montefiore cemetery in Pinelawn, NY. See footnote below.) Jason bought from Morris three copies of the Vileiker Yizkor-Book (\"Memorial Book of the Kehillah of Vileika\"). 01/27/1985: Jason had Telcom with Morris; then, sent him a letter.\n\n08/04/1985: Jason had another Telcom. Morris said that he'd just turned 80; that a relative of his first wife (Chava Teitz) is to arrive soon in NYC, & that he'd try to contact person who may still have Vileika records. 7/20/1986: Jason had another Telcom with Morris. Morris said that he was suffering with spinal problems that affect his legs (he needed to use a cane). (Jason told him about Zalman Alpert.)\n\nDuring this telephone conversation, Morris supplied Jason with the following information about the three brothers of his late wife Chava Teitz:\n\n~ Robert Teitz had had a leather-tanning business in Boston.\n\n~ Sam (Shmuel) Dietz had been a wealthy builder in New York City, and had been a personal friend of Mayor Jimmy Walker.\n\n~ Itche Teitz had died in Guadalhara, Mexico, about 1983. Itche had had two daughters. One was married to a policeman in Santa Barbara, California. The second daughter was married to an engineer in Mexico City.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------- 2. Rabbi David F. Mashitz\n\n1667 East 19th Street\n\nBrooklyn, NY\n\n718-336-1604 Rabbi David's son, Rabbi Judah Mashitz (phone 718-645-7357), is a friend of radio personality Dov Shurin (FYI: Dov's grandfather, HoRav Yaakov Kaminetzky was from Dalhinev / Dolginovo). Jason first spoke with Rabbi David Mashitz on 7/1982 (possibly abour some real-estate problem of his former synagogue in Far Rockaway, NY).\n\n11/28/1984: Jason had another telephone conversation with Rabbi David Mashitz. He said that he was born in Vileika, and that his father had been the Rabbi of Vileika. He also said that he'd known Alperowicz's, as well as Szaja Ejdelman (father of Anya Edelman-Beatus, below) in Vileika.\n\n02/21/1987: Jason met for the first time in person both the father David and the son Judah at David's synagogue, which was at the above address (East 19th Street). Jason was accompanied by Dov Shurin and \"Uncle\" Lybush Halpern. 08/18/1989: Jason had a telephone conversation with Rabbi David Mashitz. Genealogist Randy Daitch (of the Dejcz family from Sharkovshchizna) was also on the telephone line.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------- 3. Ben-Ami Perlov\n\n41-35 70th Street\n\nJackson Heights, NY\n\n718-458-9024 Ben-Ami is a son of the Yiddish writer Yitzchak Perlov, who was born in Vileika. There is a write-up on Yitzchak Perlov on page 196 of the Vileiker Yizkor-Book (mentioned above). 08/27/1985: Jason had a telephone conversation (1x) with Ben-Ami Perlov, and discussed Vileika. Ben-Ami said that he had worked several years as a typesetter for the FORWARD newspaper, and that now he has a retail store of Video products. --------------------------------------------------------------- 4. Isaac Alpert (Aizik Alperowicz), Jason's late father\n\nJason's late father Aizik worked in Vileika, before emigrating to Auburn, Maine, in 1926. He'd worked for Anya Edelman-Beatus's father, Szaja Ejdelman (Shaya Eydelman). He was a \"bukh-HAL-ter\" (accountant or comptroller) in Szaja's huge lumber exporting business. See the file Beatus.txt for more details. Aizik was also on the \"Direktor'n Rat (Governing Board) of the VILEIKER YIDDISHER KO-OPERATIVER FOLKS-BANK (Jewish Cooperative Peoples' Bank, which is I guess like an American Credit Union). Jason used to have an official Letter-of-Introduction that the bank had given to Aizik, authorizing Aizik to negotiate a long-term loan (\"lang-terminike hal-vo-e\") for the bank from the American \"landslayt\". This historical document even had the official rubber-stamp of the Vileiker Folks-Bank. Unfortunately, this document has been lost.\n\n======== Miscellaneous Notes about Vileika ========\n\nVileika and Kurenitz are about 10 kilometers apart, Jason believes.\n\nMany Jews from Vileika, Kurenitz, and Krasne settled in New Haven, Connecticut and in Lewiston-Auburn, Maine. (Jason was born in Lewiston, Maine.) The New Montefiore cemetery on Wellwood Avenue in Pinelawn, LI, NY (mainly in Block 9) contains the burial places of many Vileiker Jews -- including some of Jason's cousins (such as Sylvia Levine, whose son is married to actress Eva Marie Saint). ~~~~~~ END of Landslayt.txt File ~~~~~~\n\n~~~~~~ TOP of Beatus.txt File ~~~~~~ ================================================================\n\nNote that ADDRESSES and PHONE-NUMBERS given below are very OLD.\n\nMany of them are probably no longer current nor valid.\n\n================================================================ Information below is from an old 3x5 index-card in Jason I Alpert's files:\n\n[Some updates, added in year 2002, are included -- Jason I Alpert]:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnya (Mrs Zigmund) Beatus\n\n1130 Brighton Beach Avenue\n\nBrooklyn NY 11235\n\n718-646-2703 Anya (nee Ejdelman or Edelman): daughter of Szaja Ejdelman (Shaya Edelman) of Vileyka. She married Ziggie, and they emigrated to the USA before Holocaust. Szaja Ejdelman owned a large lumber-exporting business in Vileyka. Anya remembers Jason's father, from when he worked for her father Szaja. Anya was about 14 years old when Jason's father left Vileyka, in Dec. 1926, for the USA. Szaja's wife may have been aunt of Jason's father (needs investigation). 01/20/85: Jason visited Anya and Ziggie (both lx) at above Brooklyn address. They gave Jason a copy of an English translation of a Yiddish article that was printed in the Vileiker Yizkor-Book (\"Memorial Book of the Kehillah of Vileika\"). Web: Go to http://www.jewishgen.org/wconnect/wc.isa?jg~jgsys~yizkor and search for text \"vileyka\", type of search: \"Town - Exact Spelling\".\n\nThis article described the travails of Ejdelman family under Soviet exile in Siberia. (Szaja died there, but the rest of family survived. In effect, the exile to Siberia saved them from extermination by the Nazis, who invaded Vilejka in 1942.) (2002 Note: This document was later lost when Jason vacated his 100 Forsyth Street apartment on March 14, 1997.)\n\n08/18/89: TelCom with Anya. Randy Daitch was also on the line. [Note: This is the Randy Daitch of the \"Daitch-Mokotoff Soundex\" at http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/database.html] SEE: File of CORRESPONDENCE-Current with Edelman family.

See below.\n\n10/28/1984: Jason had a second telephone conversation with Joseph Cohen.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------- Jack and Mary Leff\n\n750 Pelham Parkway South\n\nBronx, New York 10462 Telephone 718-931-2652 Jack's late brother, Herman Leff, was married to the former Libby Shelnitz -- who is an aunt of our Henry Kaplowitz . In other words, Herman Leff is Henry's uncle by marriage. Jack and Mary's children are Maxine and Pamela.\n\n08/22/1982: Jason first telephoned and spoke with Jack and Mary. Mary said that she was a member of the Krasner Fareyn. She said that her maiden name was Alperovitch (Alperowicz), and that she was a cousin of Joseph Cohen (above). She said that she is also a cousin of a Samuil (Sasha) Alperovitch. (Jason thinks that he once may have had a 3x5 index-card for Sasha, but cannot now find the card.)\n\n09/16/1984: Jason had a telephone conversation with Jack Leff and his daughter Pamela. (Mary had passed away June 1983.) They expressed their fervent desire to investigate the condition of the grave -- in the Krasner cemetery -- of Mary's grandfather, Mordechai Kagan (pronounced Kahan). Jason suggested that they enlist the help of Samuil (Sasha) Alperovitch, who at the time still had a brother living in nearby Minsk.\n\n02/16/1985: Jason mailed letter to Jack and Pamela. (Jason has no copy thereof.) 09/01/1985: Jason told Jack about a telephone conversation that he'd had that day with a \"Rabbi Besser.\" (Maybe that had something to do with the Krasner cemetery? Jason doesn't remember.)\n\n08/24/1986: Jason had a telephone conversation with Pamela. Then Jason mailed her some information.

I (Jason I Alpert) knew Kalman and Mary well. (I was born in Lewiston, Maine, March 8, 1940.) My mother worshipped her Aunt Mary, and repeatedly took me to visit her. Many years ago, I spent a few hours with Kalman Scolnik at 210 Ash Street. I picked his brain in compiling our family tree. Unfortunately, Kalman has passed on, and the piece of paper containing that family-tree has been lost. Some things survive in my memory, to wit: Kalman said that our ultimate ancestor was named Eliyahu Der Vilner (meaning Eliyahu from the City of Vilna). This is undoubtedly the Eliyahu Zaludik that is listed on Dave Fessler's excellent family-tree (see below). (And, no -- this is NOT the Vilner Gaon.) Kalman lived to the age of perhaps 110 or 120. In case you want to try to figure out his exact age, consider this: Kalman once told me that he (Kalman) was born in Kurenitz (Kurenets in Belorus) \"the year of the big fire.\" Kalman also told me that he'd had a brother who'd changed his name to Alperowicz (a very popular family-name in Kurenitz), and that this brother had then moved (from Kurenitz) to Bobruisk (Belorus). Someone should try to locate any descendants of this displaced family-member ...\n\nKalman's wife (and first-cousin) was Mary. \"Aunt Mary\" was a sister of my grandfather (Eliyohu-Shlomo or \"E-le-SHLEY-me\") Gurewitz. My mother Dorothy Gurewitz Alpert (Eleshleyme's daughter) used to address her as \" Mi-YA-she\" (probably from the Russian name Mar-ya-sha)\" My mother OB\"M passed away Feb 1991.\n\nKalman and Mary's two unmarried sons, Bill and Eddy, still live at 210 Ash Street in Lewiston. Bill and Eddy probably possess a treasure-trove of information that could be used for family genealogical research. By this I mean correspondence from pre-war Europe. This is because the Scolniks have lived at 210 Ash Street in Lewiston \"forever\", and that address has for many years served as a rally point for separated and dispersed family members to seek each other. (According to Dave Fessler's family-tree, Bill was born in 1913, and Eddy in 1917 -- so I wouldn't procrastinate contacting them.)\n\nFor example, cousin Ida Manpel Rubin (see below) once told me the story of how she'd been reunited with her brother Elye after the Holocaust. She said that Elye had written to the Scolniks at 210 Ash Street saying that he was still alive. He'd survived the Nazis, and was living in Russia. (The only American address that he had was 210 Ash Street.) The Scolnik's contacted Ida in NYC upon receipt of this letter (more about this below). Nevertheless, Ida disliked her uncle Kalman. She called him \"a miyeser shlang!\". (Perhaps she was jealous of his great wealth???) Ida (Chaya-Hinda) MANPEL was born in Dalhinov (Dolginovo), which is now in Belarus. Ida emigrated to the USA, where she married Israel \"Tulie\" RUBIN. They lived in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nI used to have a b/w photo of Ida Manpel and her parents and siblings, sent from Dalhinov to my grandfather Louis Sam Gurewitz in Auburn, Maine. It was sent before she emigrated to the USA. Does anyone have a copy of this priceless photo? I doubt that Ida is still alive. You could check with her son Lewis -- with whom I once played chess while the Rubin family lived on (367?) Miller Avenue in the East New York section of Brooklyn -- around 1954 or so. Here is his address: Rubin, Lewis MD (Urologist)\n\n2320 Bath St # 309\n\nSanta Barbara, CA 93105 Phone: 805-682-7661\n\nAfter Ida Manpel emigrated to the USA, her brother Elye Manpel remained behind in Dalhinov (Dolginovo). Elye was there during the Holocaust. Fortunately, Elye caught the very last train that managed to leave Dalhinov before the Nazis arrived, and thus miraculously escaped the invading Nazis. MANY YEARS LATER, a letter from him was received by the Scolniks at 210 Ash Street in Lewiston. He was (is?) living in the Russian city of Orel (pronounced Aryol). I am attaching a file named Manpel.GIF. This is an image of Elye's address written in Cyrillic characters. Here is my transliteration of the Cyrillic version, and it may be WRONG.\n\nElye Manpel\n\nKomsomolskaya Street 46, Apt. 3\n\nOrël, Russia 302001 (ANSI character-set, used in Windows)\n\nOrl, Russia 302001 (ASCII character-set, used in DOS)\n\nI believe that Elye was Ida's YOUNGEST sibling. Therefore, he might still be alive. Someone should try to locate him, and any possible descendants (as well as Kalman's brother in Bobruisk, mentioned above) ...\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLewis Rubin's older brother is Seymour, and the oldest is Jackie.\n\nI found these 2 addresses for Seymour on the Internet.\n\nI don't know if either is correct. Rubin, Seymour\n\n2085 Rkwy Pkwy\n\nBrooklyn, NY 11236\n\n(718) 763-5419 Rubin, Seymour\n\n4218 Bedford Ave\n\nBrooklyn, NY 11229\n\n(718) 769-2444 I also found Jackie's address on the Internet. I KNOW that this address is correct, because I used to visit Ida there.\n\nRubin, Jack\n\n2896 W 8th St\n\nBrooklyn, NY 11224\n\n(718) 373-2049\n\n(718) 373-0230 Since Jackie Rubin is occupying his parents' apartment, and since he is the oldest son -- I would think that he might be in possession of old family photos and correspondence from pre-war Eastern Europe. (Similar situation to Bill and Eddy Scolnik, above)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***** More About the Family ***** During the years 1953-1956 (when I first came to NYC from Maine to study in a yeshiva), I used to regularly visit cousin Ida Manpel-Rubin and her husband Israel (Tulie), and their three sons.\n\nThey lived in the East New York section of Brooklyn, at 367 ? Miller Avenue.\n\n(Later, they moved to 2896 West 8th Street in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn.) After visiting with Ida, I would walk over to (129?) Miller Avenue, and visit with cousin Sadie (Mrs Jake) Friedland, and her daughter Pauline. (I was just 13 or 14 years old. Ida and then Sadie would both feed me well.) I believe that Sadie had a sister (Becky Williams?) maybe in Far Rockway,NY. Besides their daughter Pauline, Sadie and Jake had a son named Al Friedland. Al married his second-cousin Estelle (nee Gurewitz), from Ithaca, New York (more below). -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy grandfather Louis Sam (Eleshleyme) Gurewitz (changed from Zaludik) had these siblings (as far as I recall): 1. Mary (Maryasha), who married her first-cousin Kalman Scolnik.\n\n(They lived at 210 Ash Street in Lewiston, Maine, as mentioned above.)\n\n2. David, of Lewiston, Maine. He never married.\n\n3. Harry, of Ithaca, New York. [I recall now that Mary's husband Kalman couldn't stomach Mary's brother Dovid. Dovid would have to sneak over to 210 Ash St. for a meal when Kalman wasn't home. Maybe this is one of the reasons that cousin Ida Manpel-Rubin didn't like him. (As I mentioned above.)\n\nI never met Harry Gurewitz. According to my records, Harry's daughter Estelle married her second-cousin Al Friedland. They had three children: Rickie, Phillip, Jay Lee, and Lisa Sue.\n\nI don't remember if I ever met any of Estelle's children. I MAY have met Estelle and Al Friedland, possibly at Sadie's home on 129 Miller Avenue in Brooklyn. I don't remember.) I vaguely remember that family members would stay with Estelle, whenever they visited Florida. (Why pay for a hotel?)\n\nMy records show her address as: Estelle Friedland\n\n17521 N. E. 1st Court\n\nNorth Miami Beach, Florida 33162 But I couldn't find it on the Internet. I am fairly sure that her husband Al Friedland has passed away. I don't know about her. The children are probably alive.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------- A 3rd son of Kalman and Mary Scolnik is Sam Scolnik. Sam is married to the former Mary Abromson.

The name was really Zheludek (Ida even wrote Zheludek for me on a paper.)\n\nAlso, As a child, I once questioned \"Uncle Dovid\" (as I used to fondly address him) as to why the family name had been changed from Zheludek to Gurewitz. His reply was something like: \"Vos bin ich shul-dik vos der ta-te hot amol ge-ton?\" -- which gave me the impression that he couldn't, or didn't want to, explain why his father Yosef (after whom I'm named), had changed the name. Well, this is confirmed by Dave Fessler's family-tree. Only there, the name is spelled Zaludik -- which is probably more correct.\n\nThere is a Yizkor-book commemorating a TOWN named ZHELUDOK. See\n\nhttp://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/zaludok/zheludok.html\n\nMany years ago I skimmed through this book. In it I found some cousins of\n\nmine (from a different side of the family, not related to the Scolniks and Zaludiks) named ALPEROWICZ (ALPEROVITCH) and SZYFMANOWICZ (SHIFMANOVITCH). (Lyuba SZYFMANOWICZ died in the Holocaust according to page 314 in this book.)\n\nIt doesn't make sense for a family-name (surname) to be identical to a town name. Someone from Vilna might be named Vilner (not Vilna). Someone from ZHELUDOK might be named ZHELUDKER. That's why I think that Zaludik is correct. An alternate spelling might be Zaludok or Zaludek.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to Lester Solnin (changed from Sosensky) and Marian Anderson, Dave Fessler of Houston, Texas, has a large amount of information. They sent me a paper copy of Dave's family-tree, which is entitled \"Descendants of Eliyohu Zaludik. It is a masterpiece ...\n\nThey also sent me a digitized image (Paperport .MAX file) of a 1-page Report, which is information extracted from Dave's family-tree (database).\n\nDave's email address is dfessler@houston.rr.com. -------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpeaking of \"Sosensky\", I vaguely recall seeing a photo of an old bearded man. I think he was a cousin named Sosensky.

Julius was born circa 1897. At that time, Julius's telephone was 933-1062 (now area-code 718).\n\nOn 5/15/1986 I spoke with Julius by phone.

She is the daughter of Rivka nee Volozhinski from Volozhin (Rivkas' mother was from the Bunimovitz family of Volozhin). Breines' father was Mordechai Kur who's' father was a well-respected scribe (writer of Torah books) in Vileyka; (Yehoshua Koor). Rabbi yakov Landu Z\"L ABD bnai Brak wrote about Yehoshua Kur in the yizkor book for kurenets; ' Amongst the shoemakers I must tell about Moshe the Shoemaker from Dolhinov Street. He was a spiritual Jew and would read with excitement from the Torah. HE was also a Kaidanov Hasid. His father was Reb Yoshua, the writer from Vileyka. The son of Moshe, Shlomo Chaim studied Torah in our minyan, and when he arrived at the age where he would be taken to the army, he escaped and went to London. His last name was Koor and from what I heard he became a Hazan in one of the synagogues in London, where he later passed away \"*\n\nI received emails form other members of the family; Dear Eilat\n\nWonderful to hear Breines story\n\nMy grandfather - Shlomo Hayim, son of Moshe and cousin of Breine had family both in England and in Russia\n\nShlomo Hayim had 4 children\n\nMarie - married name Coleman - Stephen's mother\n\nHenry- my father\n\nHanna - married name Mather\n\nLily/Leah- married name Broza\n\nI moved to Israel from England about 25 years ago. I live in Efrat about 20 minutes from Jerusalem but work in Jerusalem and commute every day. I have an elder brother Shlomo who lives in Petach Tikva near Tel Aviv and a younger brother Jonathan who lives with my mother in Netanya. My parents came to Israel in 1983 to retire. My father passed away in 1988.\n\nDanny Koor\n\nEilat\n\nMy cousin Danny Koor has been in contact with you, and has sent me all the details he has received from you so far.\n\nWe share the same grandfather Shlomo Chayim, or Solomon Koor as he was known in England. My late mother Marie, and Danny's late father Henry were brother and sister, together with 2 surviving sisters Hannah and Lily.\n\nThe family lived initially in the East End of London, moving to Notting Hill in the 1920's, where\n\nmy grandfather eventually became minister of Notting Hill Synagogue until he died in May 1946.\n\nStephen Coleman Back to Breine story...The parents of Breine came from very respected religious families and a matchmaker arranged their marriage as the custom of Jews in 1900. The relatives from the groom side said that Rivka did not come to the marriage with the appropriate dowry but she had other qualities to compensate for it. The oldest boy; Avraham was born in 1910, Eliezer was born in 1922\n\nHe was \"Tamid Chacham\" a Yeshiva \"Bachur\". A distant cousin; Arie Shevach remembers that there was a time whene Eliezer had to serve in the Polish army c 1937. He was station near Krasne and the rabbi of Krasne ordered the family to prepare Kosher food for Eliezer and he would deliver it to Eliezer everyday. Arie was about 12 years old and was getting ready for his Bar Mitzva and Eliezer helped him with some of his studies. .\n\nAfter the Soviets took control of the area in September of 1939 and instituted a communist rule in the area Breine.'s oldest sister who owned a coffee store in Horodok knew that she would be classified unfavorably as 'capitalist\" so she moved to Vileyka. Vileyka, one of the region's main towns, became an important place for the Soviet municipal authorities and She worked for them.\n\nWhen the German invaded the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941 The Soviet officers and official evacuated the area and crossed by trains the old border (the pre 1939 Poland/ Soviet union border) . Some of them insisted that Breine's sister, along with other Jews in the town who worked for the Soviets, leave with them because they knew what the impending German invasion would mean for them. (in some cases the Soviet officials actually pushed Jews they encountered around town onto departing trains without leaving them a moment to return to their homes and families. One Jewish woman, Dora Rabinovitz told me that that she came to Vileyka to work that day wearing a light summer dress and, by chance, carrying a picture of her family in her pocket. She was pushed onto a train and sent to the cold of Russia for more then two years and was the only member of her family to survive E. D)\n\nBreine.'s brother Eliezer was studying in a yeshiva in Poland. In 1939, when the area was given to the Soviets the whole yeshiva received illegally acquired papers from the Japanese ambassador in Lithuania. With these papers, the residents of the yeshiva were allowed to immigrate to China before the German invasion. In China, Breine.'s brother contacted their other brother back in the area of Horodok who subsequently traveled all the way to China so as to bring him back to Poland, where he would later perish in German hands. (He might have never left for China, his brother might have taken him from Lithuania back to Horodok the Soviets would never let anyone without papers go all the way to China and back the papers were very very hard to obtain)\n\nDuring the German occupation Breine and her family first went to a former Christian neighbor and asked him to hide them. However, because they had previously given him their possessions for safe keeping, he was loathe to the idea of saving those who may later ask for his newly acquired, albeit on loan, goods. So, when they asked to be let in, he threatened to kill them\n\n.\n\nBreine and her family escaped the killing of the jews in Horodok and went to Krasne. Threr was a large German camp in Krasne and they needed many Jewish workers and the Kur family as many other Jews assumed that the Germans will keep them alive as long as they weorked for them. Breine worked with other Jewish women and children to lay new train tracks. German soldiers routinely routed out and murdered Jews who were weaker or more feeble than the rest. The food given daily to the Jews who worked for the Germans consisted of one piece of bread with marmalade, and on occasion, a soup made from discarded potato peals. Often, the garbage of non-Jews was served to the Jews as food. Once, Breine saw the German soldiers throw a live dog into the soup they were serving and then forced the Jews who had witnessed the event to eat the soup. At another time, a Jewish child returned to ask for an extra helping of soup. Instead of granting his request, the German soldiers put the child into the boiling soup. On one occasion, she spotted some mouldy bread in the garbage and treasuring it, picked it out of the trash, eating a little and saving the rest for her family. Some German soldiers saw her and abused her for taking the bread.\n\nThere was one Jew from Horodok who would tell the Germans which Jews were wealthy, in hopes of being spared by the soldiers. Nevertheless, he was later killed by the German soldiers Breine and her family thought that the Germans needed them as workers so they worked very hard because they thought it would be their ticket to survive. At one point they realized that they should go into hiding in a hidden ditch they had dug for that purpose. Many Jews resorted to living in ditches to escape the Germans. The ditches varied in size - some holding five, others ten, and still others, up to twenty people. While they were in hiding in the ditch and fearful of the German soldiers they knew were near, one of the young girls (about 10 years old) in the ditch with Breine. and her family started crying for water. A man in the ditch started choking her to silence her. Breine prevented him from killing the girl by pushing him away and placing her hands over the girl's mouth. The young girl is now a doctor in the U.S..\n\nThey had large amounts of gold and while hiding out in the ditch, they decided that the best thing to do would be to offer the wealth to the Germans in return for a promise of security. B was on her way to deliver the gold and solicit such a promise when Zemitre, a Christian from the village, came to her and challenged the logic of her mission. He said, \"Are you crazy? Why are you going back to them? They're killing everyone.LOOK AT THE FIRE, YOU JEWISH BROTHERS ARE BEING BURNED RIGHT NOW\" He then took B. to his barn and hid her in the area used for storing hay, where she remained for a week.\n\nB.'s family didn't know what had happened to her after she left the ditch. Although everyone left the ditch while B. was still missing, her family, because they were worried about her whereabouts returned to look for her. Tragically, her family was killed upon their return while the rest of the people who had left the ditch survived.\n\nA neighbor of the Christian who had saved B. had also taken the risk of hiding a fugitive Jew. When the other neighbors found out they attacked and killed him, and burnt down his house. After this incident, B.'s host was afraid and forced her to leave. For a time she hid where she could, moving from place to place, and eating what she could find, including grass and garbage.\n\nOne farmer who was out searching for eggs in his yard discovered B. in hiding. He immediately knew who she must be. Terrified, she told him that she knew the location of a large quantity of gold and promised to lead him to it, should he chose to spare her from the Germans. The farmer told her to that he did not need her gold, he will help her but she must wait where she was and left since this occurred shortly after they sloutherred the Jews of Krasne many of the Jewish bodies were left in different areas were they were killed and the Germans were worried that disease would spread yet they did not want to touch the remains and all their Jewish slave workers were killed by them they ordered the local population to get rid of the budies and the man was ordered to do it. B. was certain that he had gone to fetch German soldiers. However, after ten minutes the farmer's wife appeared and offered B. a bowl of soup and a spoon. B. hadn't eaten in a long time, and ravished with hunger, drank the soup straight from the bowl. The farmer's wife cried to seeing her desperate condition.\n\nB. stayed with the farmer and his wife, living exclusively in their barn for one week. She remained in hiding in the barn because there were many Germans in the area. She was never allowed in the house. Later, they made her a nanny to their children, although she continued to sleep in the barn. Most of the neighbors were never aware of her because of the lengths that B. and the family went to in keeping her presence a secret.\n\nThrough rumors that had spread among the non-Jewish farming residents of the area, Isaac Noll, a Jewish member of the partisans, found out that there was a Jewish girl surviving alone in the area. (B. remarks that it was amazing that the residents had not yet turned her in). Isaac asked them where they could find her and they told her Maruska Kamarouski had her staying with him. Before the German troops began slaughtering the Jews, many young Jewish men realized what was about to transpire and escaped deep into the surrounding forest where they joined forces with partisan groups already established by Soviets, and especially former Soviet prisoners of war who had been treated as badly as the Jews under the Germans. Together, they began ambushing and killing German soldiers. Much of the local population was afraid of the partisans because the partisans made it clear that anyone found collaborating with the Germans would be killed.\n\nWhen B. initially tried to join the partisans they would not accept her because she came empty handed. However, a younger first cousin of hers (his father was the brother of Breine's mother), Mayer Vol (previously known as Volojinski) ambushed a German and stole his weapon, which he then gave to B. so that she would be accepted in by the partisans. Now this cousin lives in Windsor, Canada.\n\nBreine. returned armed to the partisans, who let her in, and B. became a member of the Atriad Staritsky. This group of partisans hid out in the forest between the towns of Baranovic and Vollojny, remaining closer to latter. B. stayed in the forest for one and half years. After staying for awhile with the partisans she came to understand that the Germans were losing the war because, for the first time, she had access to radio broadcasting, and in 1944 they began seeing Allied planes fly overhead.\n\nBreine didn't fight with the partisans, but facilitated their goals in other ways, tending to the livestock and helping out with the cooking. After the war she received medals for her participation in the resistance, but hadn't killed anyone and so felt as though she didn't deserve them.\n\nBreine felt that Jews and Soviets alike were treated equally within the partisan ranks and generally, got along well. She does recall one instance, however, when a Jew by the name of Fole Parovsky went to town to find food with two Soviets, and never returned. The two Soviets claimed he had been killed by German soldiers. However, one partisan by the name of Jaunsh didn't believe their story and started investigating only to find that the Soviets had killed Fole. The partisans had a trial and found one of the Soviets guilty. He was subsequently killed. B. can only speculate on his motivation, but believes it may have been anti-Semitism. However, this was a rare case.\n\nIn the evenings, the partisans would make communal fires and sit around and sing together. They would sing so loudly and happily that B. would be afraid that the German soldiers would find them. However, her cousin Isaac reassured her that they were too scared of the partisans to come to the forest that was controlled by the Russian partisans.\n\nOnce the partisans caught a German soldier. This particular German soldier was a special target of their anger because he carried with him numerous photographs of Jews he had killed, (They used to send the pictures to Germany) They ordered everyone to watch while they killed him. Breine covered her face, refusing to watch. However, her cousin chided her, telling her she was crazy to feel any sympathy to Germans who mercilessly killed so many Jews.\n\nThere was a woman named Yokha Rubenshik from Minsk who was a partisan member. When the Germans packed the Jews into train cars to be killed, she and her siblings where among those on the train. Yokha, realizing what their fate must be, pushed her younger brother out of the train. He eventually survived the war and became a dentist. She survived because she worked for the Germans and then escaped. Later, she joined the partisans and was sent by them back to Minsk where she recruited twelve more Jews. Together, this fugitive band removed their stars of David and escaped. However, while they were escaping a German soldier came by. Yokha approached him and spoke to him Russian, knowing that he would recognize her Yiddish accent if she spoke in German. She acted very self-assured and invited the German to eat with her. She emphasized that she had ham to eat and told him to meet her at a particular place and time later that evening. Meanwhile, the other Jews escaped.\n\nTowards the end of the war, when the Germans were clearly losing, a boy from Minsk named Moshe managed to round up thirty Germans who thought they were surrendering and would be made POWs.\n\nWhen the commanders told the partisans that the area was free of German troops, forty Jewish partisans decided to re-enter the city of Volozhin, the closest town. Upon returning they found that many homes and been burnt down and destroyed. Also, this town, previously famous for its large Jewish population had been repopulated by Christians. When the Christians saw that Jews were returning they began to weep and were afraid. However, the group of forty Jews were still scared to disband and live separately, and so they re-occupied only three houses in the town. Because there were so few Jews that had survived the war, this group of survivors became like family to one another.\n\nIt was while staying in this house that B. met her husband to be. He had spent the war as a soldier in the Red Army in Russia, although he was originally from Breine's hometown of Horodok. As soon as he heard that his home region had been freed by the Red Army, he boarded a train and returned. When he had left for Russia he left behind a wife and two children, who were to perish in the Holocaust. His first wife's name was Blumke, she was a beautiful woman (one of her brothers survived the war and lives iin Israel). Because of her beauty, the Germans wanted to take her to work for them and send her children to be killed, but she insisted on accompanying her children. Everyone knew this story about Blumke and her children and so were able to tell her husband what had happened when they eventually met up with him upon his return.\n\nBreine's future husband returned to find Christians living in his old house. As soon as they saw him, one of the Christians went to look for an axe with which to kill him. Understanding what they were about to do, Breine's future husband jumped out of a window in the house and went for the Soviet police. After this incident, he was too afraid to ask any Christians about what had happened to his family, and couldn't find any Jews in the town. However, he did eventually learn that there were a few Jews living in Volozhin.\n\nWhen he arrived in Volozhin and met B., he immediately asked her to marry him. Since B. had come from a religious family she had never looked at another man before him. After getting married they stayed in Volozhin for one year and began selling things from a horse and carriage. Breine's first son was born there. However, like all the other Jews living in Volozhin, B. and her husband wanted to leave.\n\nAll of a sudden, Breine's sister who had traveled on a train to Siberia before the German invasion, returned. Her sister had written a letter to a Christian neighbor named Yokobovsky inquiring about her family. Breine happened to return to Horodok with her husband to visit and was given the letter. She responded to her sister's letter from Kemarov, Siberia, writing that the rest of the family had died, but not to grieve because she was still alive. Upon getting the letter, her sister fainted and was taken to the hospital where she spent two months. After recovering, she returned to Volozhin with a Jewish man she had met in Siberia, and lived with Breine. and her husband.\n\nShortly after they arrived in Volozhin they decided to leave for Germany. From Germany they believed they would be able to travel to other countries. They had terrible associations with the town of Volozhin and the surrounding area and couldn't wait to leave. However, when they arrived in Germany they found themselves marooned in refugee camps for a year and a half, which, compared to other fellow refugees, was a short time. As refugees, however, they were allowed to stay in real homes and apartments, which had previously been inhabited by members of the SS.\n\nPart of the problem was that no country wanted to accept them. Although they received free food and goods from the U.S., they were barred from emigrating there. B.'s husband said he didn't want to go to the U.S. anyway and preferred instead to move to Israel where he felt there would be more of an assurance that what had happened to them in Poland would not reoccur.\n\nEventually they were able to travel on a ship named the Queen Anna Maria to Israel. In Israel they lived first in a refugee camp named Binyamina in very difficult conditions in tents. Later, they settled in Brandeis in Israel. .\n\n- Thursday, May 29, 2003 at 21:36:30 (PDT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGood evening Eilat, May 24, 2003\n\nI am reading your interesting website about kurenets & its region around & I appreciate the great work you did & probably are still doing. 1) I am the daughter of Yente Dinerstein from Kurenets, who lives in Israel together with her sister Rachel Dinerstein (we recently spoke about a chapter from her manuscript, that was translated to English & appears on the Internet).\n\nI was once in contact with Steven Rosen, as he started a list of Dinersteins & once we were even receiving copies of those e-mails through my daughter's e-mail address in the Technion where she studied.\n\nI would like to have again this contact & will appreciate to get those e-mails again & if possible also the e- mail address of Steven.\n\n2) It is difficult to enter your website, is there any change ?\n\n3) I found in your website about Kurenets some mistakes : in the directory of business, there was not mentioned the business of my grandmother Sarah Dinerstein, who had a shop in the center of the market in Kurenets.

Moshe's parents met when his father attended the Volozhin Yeshiva and he had a \"Keset\" (room and board) at the house of of the Weisbord family in Volozhin.\n\nEster nee Weisbord had four sisters;\n\n1. ? Married a Persky in Volozhin and had two daughters; Gitel born c 1912 and Zila born c 1916. Gitel was married before the war. The family perished in Volozhin.\n\n2. Shoshke married Yisrael Mayzel and lived in Horodok. At one point they immigrated to the U. S and some of their children were born there. The family returned to Horodok were the mother died. some of their children went to Cuba and in 1950 went to Luisiana.the rest of the family perished in Horodok.\n\n3. Bela, a twin sister to Ester went to Louisiana (Shreveport) she had a family there.\n\n4. Chana married a lampart and perished in Volozhin.\n\nMoshes' father; Yosef Baran had a brother; Hirshel Leib Baran who moved to Kurenets after his wife died. one of his sons also moved to Kurenets. Hirshel perished in Kurenets. His son escaped to the forest and was later killed. Moshe had twin sisters; Mina and Musha, they were born in 1928 his brother Yehoshua was born in 1922.\n\nIn 1928 the family moved to Rakov. The father had a leather factory there. Yakov Lifshitz was Moshes' teacher in Rakov. Pruma nee Shulman lifshitz (Yakov's wife) was his teacher in Horodok.\n\nThe family lived in Rakov until 1932 and then returned to Horodok.\n\nMoshes' father and one of his sisters perished in the holocaust. Moshe, his mother, his brother Yehoshua and the other sister were sent to the work camp in Krasne.\n\nOne time when Moshe was working on the rail road for the Germans two Jews from Warsaw were working near by. They were ordred to put away some Russian weapon that the Germans found.Moshe and the guys were able to hide some of it and take it to the Ghetto. in January of 1943 a Jewish woman asked Moshe to help her to escape with her two children (7 and 9) she told him that she knew of a forest were other Jews from the area were hiding and she would take him there if he would help them.\n\nMoshe took his weapon and escaped with the woman and her children. They arrived in the area of Kramnitz near Ilja and found the Jews. Since Moshe had weapon he became a member of the partisan unit Hanokem (Masitel) the leader was Lunin and the Komisar was Patashkevitz.\n\nMoshe was able to help his mother, sister and brother escape from the Krasne camp on March 17,1943 two days before the camp was annihilated. Moshe served with the partisans until 1944. in the spring of 1944 when the Germans knew that they had lost the war in the East (Of Europe) they started a huge blockade against the partisans. Moshe and his unit were hiding in the marshes for many days.\n\nMoshes' Mother; Ester was the only Jewish mother in Horodok who survived the Holocaust. after the war ended the family was on the way to Israel when the family of Ester's sisters in Shreveport, Louisiana found out that they survived. They pleaded with them to join them in the U. S. They were well of and helped them to settle in America.\n\nToday Moshe lives in Pittsburgh next to his sister. Yehoshua lives in Los Angeles.\n\nMoshe told me that some years ago he visited Yisrael Garber the son of the Shochet of Hordok who now lives in New York. Yisrael had a movie that was made in Horodok in 1933 by Dov Shapira who was born in Horodok.\n\nDov left Horodok when he was 13. He did well in America and in 1933 he and his wife came for a visit and Gave large sums of money to the Rabbi of Horodok for the community. They also gave five dollars to each person even to the little children. They also made a film of their visit. Moshe knew that the film must be for more then a personal use. He transferred it to a video and send copies to Horodok people in Israel and also gave copies to Jewish organizations. the video Horodok could be ordered for $30 at;\n\nhttp://www.brandeis.edu/jewishfilm/titlepricestart.html\n\n\"Image Before My Eyes,\" is the name of a 90-minute film about Jewish life in the Pale of Settlement between the two World Wars. The video includes some, but not all, of the footage from the Horodok silent video, as well as some different footage of what was obviously the same visit. This excerpt also includes interviews, segments on other locations and on other topics, including the wooden synagogues, of which so very few remain. The modern parts are in color, and the entire 90-minutes is also available through The National Center for Jewish Film at Brandeis.\n\nhttp://www.brandeis.edu/jewishfilm/titlepricestart.html\n\nMoshe told me that there are other videos of\n\nResistance and Stories of Jewish Partisans that he (and some other partisans from the area of Horodok and other areas ) detail their battle first for survival and then for revenge in the towns and forests of Poland, Lithuania, and Belarus between 1941 and 1945.\n\n.\n\n- Wednesday, May 14, 2003 at 21:32:32 (PDT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ Searching for the Kantorovich family from Slonim/Belarus and also for Keylman/Keilman family from Gorodki/Belarus.(near Vilejka)\n\nOne of my great-greatgrandfathers, the head of department of the railway company ( St. Petersbourg to Warschau ) in Vilnius, Jakob David Kantorovich was born in Slonim ( b. ca. 1825/30, d. ca. 1903 in St. Petersbourg/Russia ).

In fact, many of Byelorussia's largest cities - Minsk, Vitebsk, Mogilev, Gomel, Bobruisk, Orsha - had Jewish majorities. The invading Germans began the murder of Byelorussian Jews soon after their arrival. Jews who were not killed during the initial operations were forced to move into ghettos. These ghettos were systematically liquidated from the fall of 1941 to the fall of 1943. German authorities a lso accused the Jews of being the driving force behind the Soviet partisan movement, whose members began to operate in growing numbers behind German lines in the spring of 1942. For example, Wilhelm Kube, the Commissar General for White Ruthenia, equated Jews with partisans in the same report in which he proudly told his superiors about the murder of 55,000 Byelorussian Jews during a ten-week period in the spring and summer of 1942. (3) Most Nazi crimes in Byelorussia, particularly the murder of Byelorussian Jewry, were committed by mobile forces. Units belonging to two of Heydrich's Einsatzgruppen - A and B - were operating in Byelorussia. They received assistance from regular German police battalions and Waffen-SS units. To be sure, some of the Einsatzgruppen headquarters became stationary at the end of 1941 for the purpose of establishing an SS/police structure in the occupied Soviet Union. Yet, the occupiers' killing opera tions never really lost their mobile character throughout the occupation owing to the expanse of the areas to which these forces were assigned. After the war, members of the Einsatzgruppen were the subjects of several trials, most notably that of Otto Oh lendorf and 20 other officers before a U.S. military tribunal from July 1947 to April 1948. (4) Beginning in 1950 West German courts also tried Einsatzgruppen men. (5) In addit ion to the courts, historians also began to investigate the Einsatzgruppen and publish their findings. (6) While the history of the Einsatzgruppen is by now well-documented, the same cannot be said for most of the indigenous units who assisted the Germans in the murder of Soviet Jews and gentiles. Some - like the Arjas Commando, the Kaminsky Brigade an d the SS unit \"Druzhina\" - have attained great notoriety. However, historians have paid little attention to the large numbers of lesser-known indigenous \"security\" forces without which the Germans would have encountered greater difficulty in liquidating entire ghettos and staging massive murder and pillage operations disguised as anti-partisan actions. The Germans established two types of local units: the Schutzmannschaft and the Ordnungsdienst. The forme r generally operated in areas under civilian administration and fell within the SS/police command structure; the latter was established in army and army group rear areas and placed under the authority of local and district military commanders. Historians have only recently begun to study the Schutzmannschaften and the Ordnungsdienst.

His mother was Shula nee Gelfand his father was from the Greniman family and they lived for many generations in Disna. In the early 1920s Disna as well as much of now western Belarus became part of Poland. The Greniman family did very well financially. In 1939 when the Soviet Union and Germany split Poland the area of Disna became part of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Soviets did not look favorably upon people who were well of, They classified them as enemy of the people . Every one advised Boris to move away if he wanted to avoid being sent to Siberia. Boris moved to Vilejka. Later on he joined the Red Army and was in the area of Bialistok when Germany invaded Russia in June of 1941.\n\nBoris walked for more then three weeks from Bialistok to Vileyka as the Germans were rapidly taking over much of the area and all the Red Army soldiers they encountered were killed or taken as p.o.e.s.\n\nSome time after he arrived in Vileyka he received a secret note from his brother who was living in the ghetto of Danilovitz. Boris was able to escape from Vileyka and enter the Danilovitz ghetto.\n\nBorris asked the young people in the Danilovitz ghetto to join him and escape to the forest. Together with his brother he escaped and joined the partisans. They established Nekama a Jewish otriad under the Soviet Partisans. Most of the people in Nekama were Jews who escaped from the Vilna Ghetto.\n\nAfter the war ended Boris received an important appointment from the Soviets. After some years he led a group of Jews out of the Soviet Union to Poland and then to the west. Boris story is written in many Yiddish articles and some books. .\n\n- Monday, May 05, 2003 at 21:19:25 (PDT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTown-Uyezd-Guberniya-Surname-Given Name-Father-Relationship-Age This-Age Last-Reason Left-Year-Comments\n\nDisna/ Disna/ Vilnius date;15/ December/ 1850\n\nRevision List\n\nGREYNOMAN Manko Shlioma Head of Household 38 died in 1840\n\nGREYNOMAN Abram Manko's Son 14 in 1850\n\nGREYNOMAN David Abram Head of Household 46 28\n\nGREYNOMAN Basa Itsyk Wife 41\n\nGREYNOMAN Movsha David's Son 7 died 1848\n\nGREYNOMAN Chaim David's Son 16\n\nGREYNOMAN Rocha David's Daughter 12\n\nGREYNOMAN Movsha Abram Head of Household 27 died 1846\n\nGREYNOMAN Abram Movsha Son 15\n\nGREYNOMAN Zlata Simen Wife 46\n\nGREYNOMAN Beyla Movsha Daughter 12\n\nGREYNOMAN Rivka Movsha Daughter 11\n\nGREYNOMAN Iosel Greynom Head of Household 68 died 1845\n\nGREYNOMAN Greynom Iosel Son 51 35\n\nGREYNOMAN Pinkhus Greynom Grandchild 12\n\nGREYNOMAN Wulf Iosel Head of Household 41 25\n\nGREYNOMAN Yankel Wulf Son 17 1\n\nGREYNOMAN Anshel Iosel Head of Household 48 32\n\nGREYNOMAN Abram Anshel Son 25 9\n\nGREYNOMAN Zalman Anshel Son 21 5\n\nGREYNOMAN David Anshel Son 12\n\nGREYNOMAN Yankel Anshel Son 8\n\nGREYNOMAN Shmerko Abram Grandchild 5 died 1842\n\nGREYNOMAN Itsyk Benya Son 20 4\n\nGREYNOMAN Gena David Daughter-in-law 20 Itsyk's wife\n\nGREYNOMAN Kasriel Benya Son conscripted 1849\n\nGREYNOMAN Srol Benya Son 7\n\nGREYNOMAN Sora Shlioma Wife 38 NameBorn Residencein Ghetto SourcePublicationPage TownUyezdGuberniya MonthYear\n\nGREINEMAN, Aron 1934 Rudninku 10 - 1 Vilna Gaon State Museum of Lithuania Vilnius Ghetto: Lists of Prisoners Volume 1 233 Vilnius Vilnius Vilnius May 1942\n\nGREINEMAN, Benjamin 1905 Rudninku 10 - 1 Vilna Gaon State Museum of Lithuania Vilnius Ghetto: Lists of Prisoners Volume 1 233 Vilnius Vilnius Vilnius May 1942\n\nGREINEMAN, Cilia 1914 Rudninku 10 - 1 Vilna Gaon State Museum of Lithuania Vilnius Ghetto: Lists of Prisoners Volume 1 233 Vilnius Vilnius Vilnius May 1942\n\nGREINEMAN, Sabina 1933 Rudninku 10 - 1 Vilna Gaon State Museum of Lithuania Vilnius Ghetto: Lists of Prisoners Volume 1 233 Vilnius Vilnius Vilnius May 1942\n\nGELFAND Sinai Moys Antokolskaya Street, 4 1915 68\n\nVilniusVilniusVilnius Vsia Vilna (City Directory)\n\nGELFAND C M\n\nPiramontskaya Street, 39 1915 68\n\nVilniusVilniusVilnius Vsia Vilna (City Directory)\n\nGELFAND Ya O Pogulanskaya Street, 21 14-22 1915 68\n\nVilniusVilniusVilnius Vsia Vilna (City Directory)\n\nGELFAND Mikhel Dav Stefanobskaya Street, 32 1915 68\n\nVilniusVilniusVilnius Vsia Vilna (City Directory)\n\nGELFAND Rozal Bor Tambovskaya Street, 13 83 1915 68\n\nVilniusVilniusVilnius Vsia Vilna (City Directory)\n\nGELFAND A\n\nZavalnaya Street, 29 1915 68\n\nVilniusVilniusVilnius Vsia Vilna (City Directory)\n\nGELFAND David Iosel Zhmudsky Lane, 6 1915 68\n\nVilniusVilniusVilnius Vsia Vilna (City Directory)\n\nGELFAND Ya O postal stationary store Pogulanskaya Street 21 14-22 1915 169 postal stationary store VilniusVilniusVilnius Vsia Vilna (City Directory)\n\n.\n\n- Monday, May 05, 2003 at 19:17:21 (PDT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBoris Green is one of the few living Jewish Partisan leaders from WWII.

Six million Jews were killed in the Nazi Holocaust. Poland's pre-war Jewish community of 3.5 million was reduced to 300,000.\n\nOrganizers of the march, which was part of Holocaust Remembrance Day, said there were fewer marchers than in recent years due to security concerns over the recent war in Iraq. The event also marked the 60th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, which has become a symbol of Jewish resistance against rule by Nazi Germany.\n\nOn April 19, 1943, Jewish fighters launched a desperate last stand against German occupying forces to resist looming deportations to death camps. They held off the Nazis for several weeks with homemade explosives.\n\nAlso marching was Norman Frejman, 72, who as a child survived the Warsaw Ghetto, deportation to the Majdanek death camp and slave labor in Germany.\n\n\"God wanted me to survive: All my family perished either in the Warsaw Ghetto or in the camps. I am getting old, so I had to come here to see it once again. This is hallowed ground, because the ashes of Jews are scattered here,\" he said. \"I also wanted to attend the 60th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. This is very near to me,\" said Frejman, who left for the United States after the war and lives in Florida.\n\nHolocaust Remembrance Day is marked on a different day each year because it is linked to the 27th day of the Hebrew month of Nisan, when the uprising began. In Israel, sirens brought the country to a standstill for a two-minute silence and flags were at half-mast for the memorial.\n\n.\n\n- Tuesday, April 29, 2003 at 08:59:17 (PDT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttp://www.thejewishexchange.com/images/holidays/yomhashoah/sixmillion.html?source=tea Jewish Exchange Holocaust Presentation (IsraelNN.com) The Jewish Exchange offers Internet viewers a Holocaust Day presentation, a time for reflection - Tuesday, April 29, 2003 at 08:14:29 (PDT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWilejka was part of Poland between 1921 and 1939;\n\nPoland emerged as a bourgeois republic under the influence of the great revolutionary movement which swept the whole of Eastern and Central Europe in the years 1917-19. Although the reborn state did not solve the basic economic and social questions, its legislation granted equal rights to all citizens irrespective of nationality and religious convictions. This was guaranteed by its constitution adopted by the Sejm in March 1921 . Thus were abolished the legal norms inherited from the partitioning powers, which gave different legal status to various groups of society. However some questions as laid down in the constitution lent themselves to various interpretations. In 1931 the Sejm passed a law which abrogated expressis verbis all regulations which were discriminatory on grounds of religion, nationality and race. In this respect independent Poland fulfilled the people's hopes. The matter was different in the field of economic relations. In the inter-war period Poland found herself in an extremely difficult situation. Leaving aside the fluctuations of economic development experienced by all capitalist countries (a particularly deep drop in production, employment and incomes was noted in the first half of the 1930's), the average increase in the number of places of work was far behind the population growth. Overpopulation of the countryside became more acute, which in turn brought about the shrinking of the internal market and the resultant impoverishment of petty tradesmen and craftsmen. Unemployment in towns took on catastrophic dimensions. In these circumstances, especially in the 1930's, the pauperization of those strata which earned their living from small shops increased. Economists spoke of the overcrowding of trade and crafts. According to the 1931 census of the nearly 32 million Polish citizens, 10 per cent (or some three million) were Jews. Of this figure 42 per cent worked in industry, mining and crafts and 36 per cent in trade and kindred branches. Other occupations played a lesser role in the Jews, occupational structure. In some branches of the economy Jews constituted a majority. This concerned above all the retail trade where 71 per cent of all tradesmen were Jewish. In the clothing and leather industry this percentage was almost 50. Typical Jewish occupations were tailoring and shoemaking. However in the conditions of massive unemployment, in spite of the over abundance of certain specialties in crafts, they had no chance of finding employment. At the same time there was a growth in the number of merchants and craftsmen of other nationalities. In the countryside, the expanding cooperative movement became a serious rival to the private merchants. It would be wrong to assume that the concentration of Jews in certain branches of the economy and their pauperization were the result of a deliberate policy on the part of the state. It is true that the administration was unfavorably disposed towards employing other than Polish nationals in state enterprises, especially those of military importance (for example railways and armaments factories) and therefore removed Jews from these establishments. However, the direct reason for anti-Jewish discrimination has to be sought in the past, in the relations which had been formed in the period of the partitions. The overcoming of the traditional occupational and social structure of the Jewish community could be accomplished only by the acceleration of the economic development of the country as a whole and also by the creation of conditions favoring the acquiring of new trades which had not been popular among the Jewish community. This problem was also perceived by some Jewish organizations which undertook actions aimed at training young people in various specialties. This was done most often by the Zionist organizations which in connection with their Palestinian plans attempted to prepare groups of settlers having definite trades. However the scope of this action was very modest indeed since it depended on winning financial means as well as those willing to go to Palestine. Similar undertakings could not be carried out on a mass scale without appropriate assistance from the state in a situation where the government found it difficult to acquire sufficient financial resources for the most urgent needs. What is more, even if money had been available, the specialists trained in this way would not have been able to find employment anyway.\n\nThe same objective reasons made it impossible to overcome the concentration of Jewish laborers in small enterprises and workshops, while it should be borne in mind that over 70 per cent of the Jewish urban proletariat were employed in such small establishments.\n\nThis adverse situation was also affected by some traditional customs and religion. Since Jews observed Sabbath, it was difficult to employ in one enterprise both Jewish and Christian workers without disorganizing the rhythm of production. Even Jewish entrepreneurs unwillingly employed a Jewish labor force. Of course not all of them were Orthodox Jews and not all of them refused to work on Saturdays. However those who wanted to work on Saturdays were treated with suspicion by their employers who feared lest they belonged to a socialist or communist organization and one day might organize the factory work force in struggle for their interests. In smaller establishments, in which the owner himself took part in both the production process and management, work on Saturdays was suspended. The Jewish question in inter-war Poland was above all a social problem. Without solving the problems which were common to all working people, there was no chance of changing the lot of the Polish Jews. And the capitalist system provided no prospect of a radical overcoming of backwardness and increasing the number of jobs, despite efforts on the part of the state undertaken in particular in the second half of the 1930's.\n\nThus emigration continued. There are no exhaustive data on this subject. However, it is known that between 1927 and 1938 nearly 200,000 Polish Jews left Poland, of which number 74,000 went to Palestine, 34,000 to Argentina and 28,000 to the United States. The largest waves of emigration were recorded in the 1920's. Following the great slump, after 1929, those countries which up till then accepted immigrants, introduced new, ever more severe restrictions on immigration. This concerned, among other countries, the United States. For this reason in the 1930's overseas emigration limited in scope while the number of those going to Palestine increased. According to the most reliable calculations, between 1919 and 1942 almost 140,000 Polish Jews went to Palestine, that is, some 42 per cent of the total number of immigrants accepted by that country; the largest intensification of Palestine-bound emigration took place in the years 1933-36 when the number of emigrants amounted to 75,000.\n\nIn the difficult economic situation and the changes in legal and political status of Jews after Poland had regained her independence, various programs of activity were formed. The traditional program of the Agudat Israel, which boiled down to the observance of religious prescriptions, loyalty towards the state and the expectation of the Kingdom of God, could not suffice. Although the position of this party among the petite bourgeoisie was maintained by the authority of the zaddikim (a particularly important role in the leadership of the Agudat Israel was played by the famous zaddik of Gora Kalwaria who was however criticized by many), its attempts at consolidating a specific kind of ideological ghetto (the isolation of the Jews from the goyim) resulted in a gradual decrease of its influence. Step by step the party moved towards the acceptance of the prospect of building a Jewish state in Palestine.\n\nOn the other hand, the influence of the workers' parties continued to be strong. The most important role was still played by the Bund, some concepts of which were close to those of the radical left wing, though its members represented a whole variety of views. The Bund differed from the program put forward by the communists in that it demanded cultural and national autonomy for national minorities, especially for the Jews, and perceived the necessity of organizing the whole of the Jewish proletariat in one, separate national party. Many Bund leaders saw the need for dictatorship by the proletariat (the Bund program adopted in 1930 mentioned the possibility of such dictatorship). The party was decidedly opposed to the conservatives and discarded religion. It accused the Agudat Israel of defending the interests of the propertied classes to the detriment of the needs of the masses. The most outstanding leaders of the Bund were Victor Alter (1890-1941), Henryk Erlich (1882- 1941) and Samuel Zygelbojm (1895-1943).\n\nThe Bund, like the illegal Communist Party of Poland to which many Jews also belonged and the Polish Socialist Party, saw the only chance of solving the Jewish question in Poland in building a socialist society without man's exploitation by man. It sought its allies among workers of all nationalities living in Poland. It opposed all concepts of emigration since it perceived the impracticability of the idea of organizing emigration of a several million strong nation. The socialist leaders considered the Palestinian campaign to be an element weakening the forces of the proletariat fighting for a change in social relations and as a solution which at best could constitute a chance for only few.\n\nA radical social program was also voiced by the left wing of the Po'alei Zion which saw prospects for the Jews in a socialist revolution and in introducing cultural and national autonomy. For the future, it accepted the idea of building a socialist Jewish state in Palestine and therefore it supported the Palestinian campaigns. Its leading members were Antoni Budhsbaum, Szachna Sagan and Jozef Witkin-Zerubavel (1876-1912). A much smaller following was enjoyed by the right wing of the Po'alei Zion which concentrated above all on Palestinian works, that is all activity aimed at forming. a future Jewish state, including education of qualified farmers, workers and soldiers.\n\nAll the workers, organizations, irrespective of the differences that separated them, cooperated in many important issues. They undertook a common struggle against campaigns organized by the right wing of the National Democratic Party. In Warsaw they even formed an underground organization the task of which was to put up armed resistance to the nationalist militants. Both Jews and Poles connected with the workers, movement took part in its work. http://members.core.com/~mikerose/history2.htm\n\n)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI called Bushke nee Katzovitz Bloom(in Israel), the granddaughter of Feiga nee Deutch and Shlomo/Shloime Gitlitz of Dolhinov.\n\nShe told me that Feiga and Shlomo Gitlitz children were;\n\n1. Shimon Gitlitz who perished in Dolhinov and has one son; Yechezkel, in Israel.\n\n2. Abba Gitlitz who perished in Dolhinov with his wife and three sons.\n\n3. Yosef Gitlitz and family perished in another town\n\n4. Batia nee Gitlitz Lipkin? came to Israel before the war and has family in Israel\n\n5. Chana nee Gitlitz Katzovitz had two daughters; Bushke Bloom and Chaia Barzam with her first husband and one daughter; Sara nee Forman with the second husband; Yaakov Forman son of Leibe, Chana and the daughters survived the war and the daughters with their families live in Israel.\n\n6. Chaia Sora nee Eidelman was a teacher and also the head of a school. They did not live in Dolhinov. Her husband was from another place (maybe Volozhin) He was also a teacher and they lived in other places until the war. They came to be with her mother in Dolhinov and perished with their son Gdalyau and Feiga nee Deutch in Dolhinov\n\n7. Ytzhak Gitlitz was in Israel. died in an accident. He had a family in Israel.\n\nFeiga nee Deutch and Shlomo Gitlitz were well to do family in Dolhinov.\n\nFor some years they owned two homes in the best location in Dolhinov.\n\nShlomo was a Blacksmith and in the big yard of his home farmers from the entire area come to fix their tools. He had some special machines for sharpening the tools.\n\nSince Bushke and Chaia lost their father at a very young age they lived with their mother Chana at their grandparents home.\n\nAt age 13 Bushke was sent to a high school in Vilna. Very few families from the area were able to sent their kids to Vilna since it was so expensive. From that time on Bushke would only return to Dolhinov on vacations. as you know she later went to a college in Grodno.\n\nBushke told me that after they escaped to the forest in early 1942 and the winter was so cold she went to kurenetz were the Jews were not put in a ghetto. She was able to walk around since she had light hair and did not look Jewish. in the forest near Kurenets she ran in to my grandfather's first cousin; Nachum Alperovitz (who looked Jewish) She asked him to help her and he took her to his parents home. (If you were caught helping Jews who escaped from other places the Germans would kill you)she lived there for a while and later moved with Bluma who was a tailor and moved to Kurenets from Dolhinov.\n\nIn Kurenets Bushke met with some youth who joined the partisans (amongst them she remembered my mothers' first cousin; Zalman Uri Gurevitz who would also visit Dolhinov during vacations to be with his relatives there and Yosef Norman from Vileyka and also Rivka nee Alperovitz Gilat and others from the Alperovitz family she could not remember their first names.)\n\nLater on she went to the Knahinina camp and she received food there from Zalman Uri Gurevitz.
