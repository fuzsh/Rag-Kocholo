        "text": "John Patrick McEnroe, Jr. is an American tennis player, professional from 1978 to 1992, born February 16, 1959 in Wiesbaden (Germany).\n\nLefthanded, he dominated tennis in the early 1980s. His biggest challenge was Björn Borg, Jimmy Connors and Ivan Lendl.\n\nHis playing style was mainly oriented attack, including the serve and volley. Her technique, based on a great economy of gesture, his touch and his eye make a single player in tennis history. Some tennis experts do not hesitate to use the term \"genius\", as the technique McEnroe was permanently marked by inventiveness and simplicity. That is one of only two players (with Stefan Edberg) to have been number 1 worldwide singles and men's doubles.\n\nHe is a member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame since 1999.\n\nBiography [edit] McEnroe was born in 1959 in Wiesbaden, West Germany [1], Kay and John Patrick McEnroe Tresham his father, who is of Irish descent and was at the time stationed in the United States Air strength. The family moved to Douglaston in Queens neighborhood in New York, where the father works by day as a publicist and takes classes at Fordham Law School at night. He has two younger brothers, Mark (born 1964) and former professional tennis player Patrick (born 1966). Altor his nephew is also a good tennis player and her niece Eddie professional golf player. He had three children with Tatum O'Neal, Kevin, Sean and Emily he has custody and with Patty Smyth (not to be confused with Patti Smith) two other, Anna and Ava. They all live in the top four floors of a building overlooking Manhattan's Central Park. He began playing tennis at eight years in the Douglaston Club with his brothers. At nine, his parents enrolled at Eastern Lawn Tennis Association and he plays fast and national regional tournaments. At twelve, he joined the Port Washington Tennis Academy on Long Island. McEnroe graduated in 1977 at the Trinity School in New York.\n\nCareer [edit] During his career started in 1974 to double the U.S. Open, he won 104 singles titles (including 77 [2] recorded by ATP), including 7 Grand Slams. He has never won by the cons of Roland Garros, which he played the final in 1984 against Ivan Lendl. He approaches this final favorite, undefeated since the start of the year, and after beating Lendl in the finals in both previous tournaments, which is more on clay at Forest Hill and the World Team Cup. McEnroe remained well over five consecutive victories against Lendl. Yet Lendl wins the match, despite losing the first two sets, and triumphant in his first Grand Slam final after four unsuccessful. McEnroe will lose two more games this year, Vijay Amritraj against Cincinnati on hard and cons Henrik Sundström Davis Cup in Gothenburg on clay, making him the record holder for winning percentage in a season with 82 wins only 3 defeats. Neither Jimmy Connors in 1974 or Roger Federer in 2005 have done better. John McEnroe confessed later that he thought for weeks for this final loss, one of the few major titles to his name missing.\n\nAs for the Australian Open, at the time he was in season and major players competing for the only Grand Slam where feasible. Until 1987, the tournament was played at Kooyong Stadium, on grass courts. McEnroe does not attend regularly, his best performance was a semifinal in 1983, lost against Wilander.\n\nIn 1986 he made a break from mid January to early August, during the break he married Tatum O'Neal. After the U.S. Open in September 1987, he received a two month suspension for insults and bad behavior, it does not return until April 1988.\n\nJohn McEnroe has been an outstanding player in doubles, especially with its preferred partner Peter Fleming (58 tournaments won overall). His record in total is very flattering, with 81 titles including nine Grand Slam, which has long been the most successful player in the history of double before he was dethroned in 2004 by Todd Woodbridge (83 titles total). It also has 7 wins in a row (record) from 1978 to 1984 at the Masters, always with Peter Fleming. In mixed doubles, he won Roland Garros in 1977 with Mary Carillo. In total, he has won 186 tournaments in all competitions (an absolute record in the Open era), plus five Davis Cup (1978-1979-1981-1982-1992) and two World Team Cup in 1984 and 1985 (World Cup Team takes place on clay in Dusseldorf). Finally, it was No. 1 worldwide singles for 170 weeks, not consecutive between 1980 and 1985, when it began its slow decline. He is currently the only player to have achieved the world leader in singles and doubles during the same season in 1984.\n\nHe played with a wooden racket until late 1982.\n\nHe played 25 years in Grand Slam tournament between his first round loss in two U.S. Open in 1974 and the semifinals in mixed doubles at Wimbledon in 1999.\n\nHe holds the record for distance between two Grand Slam titles in men in the Open era: mixed doubles in tennis Internationaux de France in 1977 and twice at Wimbledon in 1992, 15 years.\n\nPersonality [edit] He is known for his bad temper: he would frequently get angry against the referees and linesmen for games played and cons photographers, cameras and microphones. Described as a perfectionist enraged by the American journalist Richard Evans, McEnroe could not tolerate failure. He confessed one day dreaming of a match where he would commit no errors. We still do not know today if his endless discussions with the referee fell under the mad desire to win every point, bad faith, or simply that his glance out of the ordinary judge him the ball better than the professionals of the arbitration. This strong personality earned him being excluded at the Australian Open 1990 at the eighth-final 6-1, 4-6, 7-5, 2-4 Mikael Pernfors cons. In this match, McEnroe was successively taunted a linesman, smashed a racket and insulted the referee [3].\n\nHe had already been well remarked at Wimbledon in 1981 against Tom Gullikson, he told the umpire: \"You Can not Be Serious!\" (\"You can not be serious!\") [4]. At Roland Garros in 1984, he contested a ball apostrophising contested the referee, spectators and cameramen to the point that his opponent Jose Higueras asked on his knees to the referee to give him the point [5]. In 1986, at the Open de Paris-Bercy, he told the referee during a match against Sergio Casal: \"You never arbitrate any of my games\" that have prevented the defeat grading required to participate in the Masters and he received a suspension [6]. Also very angry at Roland Garros in 1988 on a set point in favor of Ivan Lendl [7]. In Stockholm in 1984 semi-final against Anders Jarryd, he told the official: \"All referees in Sweden are as good as you? No errors so far in this match, no? You have not reversed anything, no errors whatsoever! \"Referee\" Second service, please. \"McEnroe:\" Answer my question, the question, asshole! \"(in:\" Answer my question, The Question jerk! \") [8]. During this match, he broke the glass tumblers with his racket and sent a ball on a viewer [9].

This will be his last appearance in a Grand Slam.\n\nIn 2006, with his Swedish partner Jonas Bjorkman, he won the tournament in San Jose, still won his last title on the main circuit, and played his last doubles match in Stockholm in October, reaching the quarterfinals. It was McEnroe's first title since the Paris Masters in November 1992 with his brother Patrick. With this victory McEnroe won titles (in duplicate) in four different decades and Tom Okker exceeds the second place as many doubles titles (79) the first being Todd Woodbridge (83) who is himself a specialist in double and an honorable singles player.\n\nIn 2010, he opened the John McEnroe Tennis Academy [13].\n\nSenior Circuit [edit] He won 8 times the trophy at Roland Garros legends, including his last 6 editions, combined with Yannick Noah in 2005, Anders Jarryd in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and Andrés Gómez in 2010.\n\nMcEnroe played on two rounds Seniors, Merrill Lynch Tour of Champions and the Outback Champions Series.
