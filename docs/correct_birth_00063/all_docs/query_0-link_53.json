        "text": "Todd Woodbridge formed half of arguably the most successful doubles combination in history, pairing with compatriot Mark Woodforde to win 11 Grand Slam doubles titles and five straight Wimbledon titles as well as an Olympic gold medal at Atlanta in 1996 and Silver medal at the Sydney 2000 Olympics.\n\nWhen Todd and Mark won the French Open in 2000, the Woodies broke the record of 57 career doubles titles held by Peter Fleming and John McEnroe and Bob Hewitt and Frew McMillan. All up, the pair won 61 career doubles titles making them the most successful doubles team in men’s tennis history. Todd Woodbridge has also notched up Australian Davis Cup records for the most ties played (29), most years played (12) and the most doubles victories (23). When Todd retired from professional Tennis in 2005 his achievements included having represented Australian for more years (14 years) and in more ties (32) than anybody in the history of Australian Davis Cup. Todd Woodbridge is the most successful doubles player in history winning 83 career titles, a record nine Wimbledons and a total of 22 Grand Slam titles.\n\nThe tennis ace has been a long-time supporter of Challenge thanks to his former Florida neighbour golfer Robert Allenby, who is the charity’s patron. Challenge a non-profit organisation that provides children living with cancer and other life-threatening blood disorders with the opportunity to put their illness aside and interact with other children in similar circumstances.\n\nSince 2006 Todd has worked as a TV commentator around the world. In addition Todd has held various roles with Tennis Australia including the appointment in 2009 as Coach to the Australian Davis Cup Team. Todd regularly speaks to corporate audiences around the world particularly as an entertaining after dinner speaker, recalling stories from his playing days along with commentary about the current and up and coming Tennis legends."
