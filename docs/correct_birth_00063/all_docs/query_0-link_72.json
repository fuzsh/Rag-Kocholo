When I got to GSSHS in 1A in 1960, I was shocked to find other brighter kids. I spent my first High school year at the Annexe, previously the Midland Primary School.\n\nI eventually left school at the end of Year 10 in 1962 for although I had done only professional subjects and I intended to be a teacher, my parents decided that I should leave school and get a job in an office as my sisters had. I had no commercial subjects so when I won a scholarship to Hartills’ Commercial College I studied typing, shorthand and bookkeeping for five months. I applied for a job at the Shell Co of Aust Ltd where I worked as a junior clerk for six months. I then decided to join the army when I was 17 and trained in Mosman, Sydney. I was going to be posted to Bendigo in Vic to become a draftswoman. I thought Bendigo would be boring so I applied for a discharge which was granted because I was considered “unlikely to become a suitable soldier.”\n\nI began working as a clerk at the State Housing Commission then transferred to the Education Department as a clerk.\n\nThen followed a disastrous marriage at 18. Had a beautiful son at 19.\n\nI worked in several places as a clerk Western Machinery Belmont for 6 1/2 years, Midland Brick, Midway Ford then Volvo Trucks. I still wanted to be a teacher so I sat a mature age entrance exam for Mt Lawley Teachers’ College. I was successful and moved into a ghastly SHC flat in Lockridge with my son so I could complete the course on limited funds thanks to Gough Whitlam. I also divorced my first husband while at college because I could get a divorce for $250 as a supporting parent. In 1977 I graduated and was posted to Beachlands Primary School in Geraldton.\n\nThe principal at the time was Garry Grainger who I married before the end of the year. (At the Registry Office in Geraldton in our lunch hour.) The then superintendent, Malcolm McGowan, gave me a transfer for a wedding present. Garry was being transferred to Leeman as principal. Our son was born in April 1978 and I went on maternity leave. In those days it was politically preferred to give teaching jobs to new graduates so it took me several years to get a teaching job. I wouldn’t accept a job created by my husband as I had received my first appointment on my own merits and I expected to get back the same way, I worked in several different jobs; Check out Chook, Receptionist Bookkeeper at Caves House, successful Real Estate Representative I did get a job at Margaret River Primary School in 1989 and reluctantly began teaching Year One. I was frightened of the position at first but eventually gained confidence and became very popular with parents. I loved it.\n\nMany of my ex year one students are my friends on FB.\n\nI took up painting in 1997 and mostly concentrated on paintings of the Busselton Jetty which I loved. I was a founding member of the Busselton Jetty Preservation Committee. I sold 16 paintings in one weekend. Four of my Jetty paintings are in the Justice complex in Busselton in the police section. Many were acquired by Shires, schools, etc. and I won many awards.\n\nWe bought a funeral parlour in Donnybrook and converted it into an art gallery and tea rooms,” Gallery Dono Arte.”\n\nMy husband and I retired in 1997. We decided to tutor as a way of giving back. I was creating a worksheet on the computer when I came up with an idea for a reading programme. We spent the next eight years sitting at computers and writing the programme. My painting took a back seat as I had only so much creative energy. Macmillan published it as Reading Keys. We still have so much belief in our programme but Macmillan did not market it efficiently and they eventually stopped selling it. We taught so many kids to read with it. The Department of Child Protection used to withdraw kids from their schools and drive them to our home for tuition. The teacher of one of our students, an autistic boy, came to see what we were doing and burst into tears when she heard him read one of our books. He had never read for her before.\n\nThey loved our programme and us. One seventeen-year-old was so happy to read her first book with us. Macmillan published 96 of our reading books, plus teacher’s books, comprehension and word activity cards. We self-published a word book, too, an important part of the programme.\n\nWe have now retired and no longer tutoring.\n\nMy time at Govo etched positive memories that are as vivid today as when they were created. Like the day that one out of 300 paper planes launched from a popular third-floor classroom flew like a soaring eagle across to the other end of the hockey field. A unique design seemingly capable of disrupting the avionics industry, never to be found again. Or the science project that required the construction of either an electronic egg timer, or some other lame device that was equally useless to me, so I handed in a digital capacitance meter that I built from scratch and was reprimanded for building a mains-powered appliance against the rules of the project. (In hindsight, it was illegal!)\n\nDespite the best efforts of my (patient) teachers, my lack of focus during year 11 and 12 saw me unable to attend Uni. However, I was motivated to learn about technology and other topics that were of interest. I pursued my electronics hobby and taught myself how to fix things without schematics, which resulted in my first electronic service business in 1984. I had a parallel fascination for Light Emitting Diodes and took every opportunity to study their operation.\n\nIn 1996 I sold the service business and started a private company to commercialise my first invention using initially LED’s, then electroluminescent technology.\n\nSubsequent perseverance landed me on national TV across the USA on the Home Shopping Network, selling my invention via 8 minutes of live broadcast to a 186 million audience. I was then able to get this and other inventions into Home Depot and Walmart. However, soon after, a dishonest agent in Nevada robbed me of much of the profits, with the FBI involved and unable to recoup any of the defrauded payments I was further motivated to succeed, and in 2009 I immersed myself into “lighting Class” LED’s, which had just become commercially viable.\n\nThe LED lighting business gained traction and I was grateful to be named “Curtin Growth Entrepreneur of the Year” in 2013.\n\nI used my knowledge of LEDs to distribute a technical booklet in 2014 that was acknowledged by the Lighting Council Australia. I was then invited to provide input at forums in Canberra to assist the Government’s transition to LED lamps. We won a global tender to manufacture and deliver all the LED lighting for the biggest shopping mall in Pakistan, as well as The World Bank Headquarters in Islamabad and then an 18-hole golf course in Lahore. We developed new LED lights for sports ovals and have since upgraded many sports/AFL ovals around Australia. Our innovative approach to LED tunnel lighting was rewarded by winning the Northbridge Tunnel (WA) and Eastlink Tunnel (Vic) lighting upgrades, along with a subsequent invitation to audit 15km of tunnels needing an upgrade to LED in Brisbane.\n\nAs at 2020, the business operates in Midvale, only a few kilometers from Govo. Our business manufactures LED lighting for roadways, mine sites, sports ovals, tennis courts, office buildings, shopping malls, hotels and, would you believe it, schools!\n\nOne takeaway from my time since Govo is the realisation that if you do your best and still don’t succeed academically, there is still no limit to what you can achieve when you leave school, as long as you are prepared stay motivated even when the odds are against you. I view all my (many) failures as a learning experience and do not waste time pondering on “what could have been”.\n\nAnd finally, we are all given the same 24 hours every day. It’s what we do with those hours that determines whether our dreams become reality.\n\nRobert (Bob) PEMBER\n\nInternational expert in labour statistics\n\nGSSHS 1960-64\n\nI am not a celebrity or an A list member, but I have had an interesting life. I was School Captain (Head Boy as some used to call it) in 1964 and editor of Quartania in 1963 and 1964, representing the school in debating, rowing, hockey, etc etc. My school blazer had enough school representation badges to make a North Korean general envious.\n\nI have been asked to indicate what have been my greatest successes. I would have to say having a wonderful wife and family, my success in rowing and the incredible experiences I had in my working career. I have described some of these below.\n\nAt school in the early 1960s, one of the GSSHS teachers was Berry Durston who rowed for Australia at the 1960 Rome Olympics. He inspired my interest in rowing and set up a rowing group at GSSHS, one of the first (or perhaps even the first) government school in WA to do so.\n\nAt the beginning of 1965, I was lucky enough to be one of six students in Australia to get a 4-year salaried Cadetship in statistics. This allowed me to attend the University of Western Australia from 1965 to 1968 and complete a Bachelor of Economics with Honours.\n\nDuring those years, I rowed in three intervarsity lightweight fours, was club secretary for three years and won the Phil Durston Consistency trophy for most events won in State competition. Apparently, I am the only UWA rower in the last 100 years to win this trophy twice consecutively.\n\nWhile at GSSHS, another student named Peter Pearson joined the school rowing group, and the crew for which I was Stroke. When we got to university, we rowed together in a coxless pair, but I also rowed in other crews (fours and eights). Peter and I rowed for four years together at the University of WA and did rather well – being State Coxless Pair champions in 1967 and 1968 and rowing in the 1967 Australian National Championships in Penrith NSW. Both Peter and I received Rowing Half Blues and I also got a Rowing Full Blue from UWA.\n\nIn 1969, my wife and I moved to Canberra to work in the then Bureau of Census and Statistics (now Australian Bureau of Statistics). While there I completed a second degree as Bachelor of Arts in Computing in what is now the University of Canberra.\n\nAfter six years in Canberra, my wife, three sons and I moved to Malawi (Africa) where I worked with the International Labour Office (ILO), not realising that this would lead to almost 30 years working in international aid in labour statistics, initially as a national expert in Malawi, Tanzania and Botswana and then as regional expert for Africa based in Addis Ababa, regional expert for Asia/Pacific based in Bangkok and finally as Senior Statistician in ILO Geneva during which time I wrote many academic and technical papers, revised the UN Statistical Commission’s guidelines on labour statistics in population census, represented ILO on many international technical committees and conferences relating to labour statistics, provided technical assistant to many countries in Asia, Africa, South America, the Caribbean and the Pacific. This career involved visits to over 130 countries and exposure to a richly varied and extremely interesting range of cultures.\n\nI retired in 2007 and, after a few consultancies to Greenland, Caribbean, Qatar and UN New York, I have now settled into a peaceful rural life in Bungendore NSW, only a few hundred metres from the top of the Great Dividing Range and surrounded by mobs of kangaroos. My wife and I are content.\n\nRosslyn Marshall (nee Pavy)\n\nStudent at GSSHS: 1967 to 1971\n\nTeacher at GSSHS: 1981 to 1986 and 1989 (for a term)\n\nGreatest achievement: Providing Professional Learning to teachers\n\nCareer\n\nAfter graduating from UWA in 1974 with an Arts degree majoring in History, I took a graduate diploma in Education at the West Australian Secondary Teachers’ College and joined the ranks of WA’s first group of teachers to begin their career four year trained. I was a secondary school classroom teacher for 22 years, followed by 10 years as an Education Officer at the John Curtin Prime Ministerial Library at Curtin University and a further 9 years at Wanneroo Regional Museum also as an Education officer.\n\nIn four different government high schools, including Governor Stirling, I taught HASS subjects such as Modern History and Politics and Law. While in schools I also took on a variety of extra-curricular roles including Year 8, Year 10 and TAGS Coordinator, and, acting Head of Learning Area. Outside of school I was a very active member of the executive of three teacher professional learning bodies– the History Teachers Association of WA (HTAWA), the Professional Teaching Council of WA (PTCWA) and the Political and Legal Educators Association of WA (PLEAWA). Despite having left classroom teaching in 2000, I have remained a very active member of the PLEAWA executive and was recently awarded a life membership for my service to the association.\n\nIn 2000 I took up a position at Curtin University, teaching at the John Curtin Prime Ministerial Library (JCPML) where I designed and delivered history and drama education programs, to years 5 to 12 students, based on the life and times of WWII Prime Minister John Curtin. Some highlights of my time at the JCPML include developing a set of WW2 archival history boxes that could give country students an experience similar to city students, the creation of an online tool to help teachers develop their students’ skills in cartoon interpretation, involvement in the National History Challenge for schools and participation in the Sir Charles Court Young Leaders program, a history and leadership camp for Year 10 students. I was also awarded a Parliamentary Scholarship which allowed me to spend a week in Canberra studying the federal parliament in action.\n\nAt the JCPML I worked with a small team of dedicated people in an institution that was using leading edge technology to make archival materials available to the world in a format that was extremely user friendly, well before other institutions were doing the same. It also gave me the rare privilege of meeting a number of former Prime Ministers of Australia including Gough Whitlam, Malcolm Fraser, Paul Keating and Julia Gillard.\n\nIn 2010, changes at Curtin University and in the WA curriculum meant that the education programs at the JCPML would fold up within a few years. Having completed a Museum Studies qualification I was well placed to secure an Education Officer position when it came up at the Wanneroo Regional Museum (WRM). In this new position I designed and delivered local history programs for years 1 to 3, quite a different scenario from my previous teaching positions. It was a huge amount of fun and I got to work at variety of locations including two heritage homes. There was also an opportunity to design more education boxes, this time about World War 1.\n\nWorking at Curtin University and the Wanneroo Regional Museum gave me opportunities to reinvent myself as a teacher. While I missed teaching in the classroom, I didn’t miss the marking, the structured timetable or the mountains of administration that go with it. What I loved about Curtin and Wanneroo was the opportunity to be creative mostly on a timeline that suited me and in time blocks that often exceeded two hours – quite different from a school. I could work within a curriculum but not be confined by it.\n\nMr Murray was born in Perth on 16.1.1942. He is married with three children – two sons and a daughter, all adults. Mrs Murray is a professional artist and freelance art teacher.\n\nMr Murray did his secondary education at Governor Stirling Senior High School. He was school captain in his final year.

He remains a member of the JCA and has been awarded honorary life membership in recognition of his service.\n\nMr Murray has continued his interest in matters of legal education and judicial professional development since his appointment to the Bench in 1990. He has not kept a curriculum vitae in relation to such matters, but over the years he has presented, to seminars and conferences of lawyers, papers concerned with such matters as the art of advocacy, preparation for trial and for appeals, and the law of evidence.\n\nExamples include a paper given at the 36th Australian Legal Convention in 2009 on communication with juries and jury management, a paper presented in 2010 to the WA Chapter of the Australian and New Zealand College of Forensic Psychiatrists on the challenge of presenting expert evidence to the Courts in a variety of contexts, and a paper given at the Judges’ Conference held in Wellington, New Zealand, in January 2011, on the sentencing of mentally impaired offenders.\n\nFor many years, his Honour participated annually in the Young Lawyers Advocacy Weekend, sponsored by the Law Society, and he has regularly given an annual presentation to the WA Bar Association’s Bar Readers Course on preparation for, and the conduct of, a civil or criminal trial.\n\nOn 19 May 2011, his Honour gave the Sir Ronald Wilson Lecture.
