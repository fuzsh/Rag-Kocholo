Alex de Minaur was still a boy – in the full sense of the word – when he made his choice.\n\nAn opportunity arose to play the game he loved, full-time, for his country. The responsibilities were all carefully explained to him and his family: training on court in the morning, then gym, then distance learning, training again, then back into the gym.\n\nEat, sleep, study. Hit, run, lift. Yesterday, today, tomorrow. And the next.\n\n“We came to a conclusion: ‘If I want to go down this route, I have to do everything in my power to make it. There’s no half-hearting this,’ ” says the 24-year-old de Minaur from a hotel room in Paris. “From that day onwards, everything I’ve ever thought about or done in my life has been about making it on the tour. I was 12.”\n\nTwelve.\n\nThis is what the best athletes invariably do, of course. Start early and commit completely. Shed distractions and sacrifice indulgences. Their decision is reaffirmed daily, too, with every practice they make, every sleepover they miss. Call it the repeated abdication of adolescence. Occasionally, de Minaur considers what he gave away, but his default lens is clear-eyed pragmatism – and pretty much has been ever since he made his fateful childhood choice.\n\n“Even then I could understand my path and my priorities; now, a couple of years down that path, you realise what you’ve given up, and a few of the things you’ve missed out on,” he says wistfully. “But the toughest thing would have been to make those sacrifices and not get the reward.”\n\nHe needs improvement, but has plenty of time to put all the pieces of his puzzle together: most important of all, making his serve and forehand weapons to hurt the biggest brutes on tour. He’s doing it the right way,\n\naccording to Todd Woodbridge, making a virtue out of focus and tenacity. When players look at their draw, they don’t want to see him in their section. “Because you have to beat Alex de Minaur,” the former doubles champion and Nine commentator adds. “He will not go away.”\n\nIt’s 9.30am in Paris, where de Minaur has just arrived after playing in Basel. Last October was fairly typical for him, insofar as he played all over the world – not just France and Switzerland but Shanghai and Tokyo, too. Yet he seems fresh, if a little confused about the date. “I flew in two days ago. Wait, Friday?” he asks, laughing. “No, one day ago, yesterday, Saturday. Sorry, too many places!”\n\nIt’s a hectic schedule, but he consciously creates time to switch off. His tennis player girlfriend, Katie Boulter, 27 – a Brit ranked 57 in the world – came from London to meet him in the City of Light, taking coffee in the suburb of Bastille and dinner with his team in Soho. They checked out a few furniture stores, too, since they’re soon moving into an apartment together near Wimbledon. Otherwise they’re ships in the night, often connecting on FaceTime to binge Netflix, counting down together – “Three, two, one …” – before hitting play on whatever series they’re watching. (Right now it’s Beckham.)\n\nThey met four years ago, before the Australian Open, when they were staying at the same South Yarra hotel and he found the pluck to ask her out for a latte. (“We were able to click early on and it’s been a very effortless, easy road,” de Minaur says, “which you cherish when your life is full of stress.”)\n\nBoulter says de Minaur was somewhat impatient as a competitor back then, desperate to push on, push hard, make headway fast. “But I think he’s learnt\n\nthat things don’t just happen overnight, that there’s a process, and it takes time to get where you want,” she says. “In this game it’s an inch at a time.”\n\nThe choice was obvious. His soccer coach was upset, voicing his displeasure not only with Esther, but taking the unusual extra step of visiting the tennis academy one day and begging Gutierrez to convince his star student to abandon tennis for the round ball game instead. It fell on deaf ears.\n\n“It was the aspect of being out there by yourself, and having to find a way to problem-solve, to beat your opponent,” de Minaur explains. “You don’t need to rely on anyone in tennis, because you can’t rely on anyone. It’s all about being tough in the moment, and finding ways, and digging deep. There’s no place to hide.”\n\nThings got serious at 12. The global financial crisis came to Spain, and hit the family’s car wash business. De Minaur had started playing a little internationally, but tennis is expensive. At the top, the riches are astronomical, but at the bottom it’s the costs that rack up. That’s when Tennis Australia got involved.\n\nTodd Woodbridge was responsible for the best junior talent in the country at the time: the pipeline that would eventually feed Australia’s teams for the Davis Cup and Billie Jean King Cup. He invited de Minaur to Roland Garros in Paris, to meet him at the French Open. He came with Gutierrez, who spoke no English, meaning young de Minaur had to translate. They played a few games together on clay. “Even then, against an adult, he was astute, creating a way to get an opening or win points,” Woodbridge says. “I just remember how\n\nimpressed I was by his maturity and worldliness. I knew he was going to be a good pro, even at 12.”\n\nAustralia offered to support him, but it would mean returning to Sydney to train, and so they did: the whole family up and shifting. Again. “That move for me was brutal,” de Minaur says, shaking his head. “All my relationships, all my friends, I was leaving all of that behind to go somewhere I essentially didn’t remember at all, on the other side of the world. I remember the last day that I was at the tennis club in Alicante: my last training session, before leaving the next day. It brought tears to my eyes.” He knew he wasn’t moving countries to enjoy suburban life and throw himself into new friend groups; he was going to immerse himself in one of the most taxing solo sports you can pursue.\n\n“When I needed that help – and I was no one – Australia was there to help me out.”\n\nAlex de Minaur\n\nLoading\n\n“The toughest thing for me was when he had to give up physical school when we moved to Australia,” says his mum, Esther. “I thought he was too young at 12 to lose the last bit of his ‘normal kid’ life.”\n\nStill, he thrived, and became a vaunted junior star. Within a few years the world economy had rebounded, and at 16 the family returned to Alicante once more. Spain wanted him to play for them, and their national program made constant overtures, but the rejections were firm. “I’ve always believed that one of the most important qualities of any human being is loyalty, and when I needed that help – and I was no one – Australia was there to help me out,” de Minaur says. “And to me that meant more than anything else.”\n\nHe got his first call up for the Davis Cup team when he was 17, as a so-called “orange shirt” boy – not really to play but to run errands and listen and assist the team, which at that point included Nick Kyrgios, Bernard Tomic, John Millman, Sam Groth and James Duckworth. He loved every minute, and one year later made his Davis Cup debut in Brisbane. He was 18, and playing against Germany’s Alexander Zverev, who was then the No. 4 player in the world. He ended up losing 7-6 in the fifth set. It’s still one of the most heartbreaking matches of his career.\n\n“Devastating,” he says. “But I became the 109th player to represent Australia at Davis Cup.”\n\nTo mark the moment, he had “109” tattooed on his chest, over his heart, at a tattoo parlour in Essendon. (Hewitt’s former coach, the legendary Tony Roche, had told de Minaur that if he ever got his number tattooed, the elder statesman would follow suit. Roche dutifully got the number 54 inked on his wrist.) “From that moment onwards, I was all in,” says de Minaur. “That just lit a fire in my belly, and it grew stronger and stronger as years went by, realising what it meant to be Australian. All the pride and history and culture in tennis in this country, I wanted to be a part of that.”\n\n“It’s hard for you to believe you’re going to break through. But that’s the only way it’s going to happen.”\n\nAlex de Minaur\n\nDe Minaur’s remarkable rise began a handful of years ago, in 2018, when he climbed from 208 in the world to No. 31, was voted ATP Newcomer of the Year, and shared his first Newcombe Medal with Ash Barty. The climb since has been slower. Meticulous and methodical. For a while, the focus was squarely on his physique, and working with his trainer, Emilio Poveda, to gain muscle without losing speed or endurance. He used to weigh all of 69 kilograms, but as his gym program swelled from two hours a day to three, he’s closer now to 76.\n\nHe already knows how to “construct” points through tactical acumen and doggedness; extra strength should hopefully win him a few more “free” points with topspin and heat, so he can be aggressive against the ropey\n\nhydraulics of big defensive baseliners. Injury prevention work has been crucial, too. The more matches you play, the more opponents you face, the more challenges you meet. His girlfriend – as a player herself – is well positioned to judge his development over the four years since they met. “He can now grow facial hair – joking! It’s been fun for me to watch him grow, and get more experience, and the confidence I’ve always believed he should have. He’s stepping into those shoes.”\n\nHe doesn’t exactly enjoy all that training. What he loves most is going to bed each night knowing he’s done everything in his power to become the best version of himself. “The hardest thing in sport is probably doing all that work and not getting the result,” he says. “It’s tough to see the journey when the wins aren’t coming.”\n\nFor a long time, that was de Minaur’s reality. A little over a year ago, for example, he was ranked 25 in the world, but could not break through against the best players. His record against the top five, in particular, was a dismal 0-18. Belief didn’t come easy. “You’ve got this wall in front of you, and you try to break through it 18 times. On your 19th go, it’s hard for you to believe you’re going to break through. But that’s the only way it’s going to happen.”\n\nIt finally happened in Paris against the unorthodox Russian counter-puncher and world No. 3, Daniil Medvedev. “After that, I was able to do it again and again, and show that I’m good enough to bring that level day in and day out. It’s all about breaking through those bubbles.”\n\nHis mental game requires constant vigilance. De Minaur plays tennis 48 weeks of every year, and most weeks end with a loss. Few sports are played between the ears as much as tennis, with so many quiet moments between sets, games and points, alone with your demons. “All these thoughts are creeping into your head; they weren’t there two hours ago, and now they’re flooding your mind,” he explains. “You have a course that you’re trying to navigate – these lines you’re trying to stay between – and the biggest thing I’ve learnt is that it’s normal to deviate a little from time to time, as long as you rein it back in and go where you’re supposed to go.”\n\nHe spent years working with a sports psychologist in Spain, but the past 18 months has focused instead on reading, whether Atomic Habits: Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results by James Clear, or Stolen Focus: Why You Can’t Pay Attention by Johann Hari.\n\nLife is good. I ask how he spends his earnings, hoping there’ll be at least one frivolous answer. Turns out he has a taste for classic cars. His first was a 1973 Mini. It turned 50 on December 28. He wanted to hold a birthday party for it. Seriously. “When I go to Spain, that’s my daily driver,” he says, grinning. “That’s the newest car I’ve got. It brings a smile to my face, and to other people’s faces when they see me rock up somewhere in a tiny green matchbox.” His more earnest response is that he can’t make too many silly purchases, or have too many extravagances. “I see myself as the provider of my family, and I need to make sure that they’re okay and they’ve got everything they need. Every decision I make is going towards our future together.”\n\nHis immediate future is uncertain. Three years ago at this time, de Minaur was in hot form but strained a stomach muscle. The past two years, he made it to the final 16 of the Australian Open, but was comprehensively sat down by Jannik Sinner, then by Djokovic. Yet he doesn’t see any added pressure in the home grand slam. “Instead of pressure, I get all these amazing people supporting me and having my back from the first point to the last,” he says. “I know the only thing I’ve gotta do is give 150 per cent – and that’s just a given – and they’ll support me no matter what. I just see it as excitement.”\n\nHe knows he’s a leader now, all humble and hungry and hard-working. He seems like an antidote to Nick Kyrgios; no public spats with Hewitt or admissions he doesn’t train as much as his peers from this 24-year-old.\n\n“Everyone’s a different human being, through different life experiences, and they create different personalities and values,” says de Minaur, sensibly refusing to be drawn on his compatriot. “I haven’t been given an amazing body, or amazing talent, or the ability to achieve things without working. I don’t have that luxury. And so I’ve told myself – since day dot – that I’m going to give everything. You don’t take the lift to the top level, you take the stairs, step by step. And when you get there, you appreciate it a whole lot more.”\n\nTo read more from Good Weekend magazine, visit our page at The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and Brisbane Times."
