        "text": "NEWPORT, R.I. — The Bryan brothers haven’t lost a match at the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships in almost a dozen years. Sure, the fact they haven’t played a match here for a decade certainly has something to do with that streak. But another part of it is they won the doubles championship the last two times they were here.\n\nBob and Mike Bryan, the No. 1 doubles team in the world, took the title in 2001 and 2002. This summer, they’ll be back to try to do it again.\n\n“It’s been a long time. We’re really looking forward to it,” Mike Bryan said of returning with his twin brother to this year’s tournament. “It’s a great tournament. We have a good time there, it’s beautiful and I don’t think we’ve lost a match there for a while. We’d love to try to win it again.”\n\nWithout question, it will be the team to beat in the doubles draw. Together, they’ve won a record 77 ATP World Tour doubles titles since turning pro in 1998.\n\n“We always love playing there. Back in the day, early in our career, we felt like we had some really big breakthroughs there,” Bob Bryan said last week, while the two were on vacation in London. “Obviously it’s beautiful and the fans are great, and there’s a ton of history there. I think everyone has a good time when they play there, and we’re no exception.”\n\nThe brothers have won 11 Grand Slam titles, tied with Hall of Famers Mark Woodforde and Todd Woodbridge — also known as “the Woodies” — for the most in the Open Era. The Bryans very well could have the record by themselves by the time they get here in July.\n\n“That would be great. We’re kind of looking at that as our next huge goal, to break that record,” Mike said. “That’s kind of the last big one that’s on the horizon. Obviously we want to get Olympic gold, but to be ahead of ‘the Woodies’ with 12 would be just awesome. It would be an unbelievable feeling.\n\n“We’re not planning on stopping anytime soon, so we’ll have a lot more cracks, but to do it sooner than later would be nice.”\n\nThe same could be said of an Olympic gold medal, something the Bryans fell just short of in the 2008 Games in Beijing. They lost in the semifinals to eventual gold medalists Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland.\n\n“It would mean a lot. To finish your career with an Olympic gold medal is huge. That’s what everyone looks at when they come by your trophy case,” Bob said. “We’re gearing our schedule toward playing well in London. It’s a big focus for us for the year. It would mean everything.”\n\nThat gold medal is a big reason why the Bryans decided to play Newport this summer, since the Olympic tennis tournament will be played on the grass courts at Wimbledon.\n\n“We want to stay sharp for the Olympics, and we want to stay sharp on the grass after Wimbledon, so we wanted to try and squeeze in another event,” Mike said. “We’re going to go home for a little while then zip over there. We’ve had a lot of good memories there, and I think it’s going to really help our tennis before the Olympics.”\n\nOther players, Bob said, may have similar ideas.\n\n“It’s a very unusual, unique year, with the Olympics being on grass and so close to Wimbledon. A lot of players don’t really know what to do,” he said. “There’s a little clay-court season that starts up after Wimbledon, and there’s hard courts. Newport falls on the perfect time for some grass-court action, and I think it will draw a good field.\n\n“I think there will be a lot of last minute wild-card requests from some big names who want to get some extra matches before the Olympics.”\n\nThe Bryans, identical twins from Camarillo, Calif., have held the No. 1 doubles ranking since Aug. 16, 2010. They’ve been in the top 10 since September 2002, and in their careers have spent hundreds of weeks ranked No. 1. Getting there was tough, but staying there has been even more of a challenge.\n\n“The game’s getting better every year, and when you’re playing teams, they’re trying to take your top spot and they’re usually playing pretty loose with no pressure and they play their best tennis,” Mike said. “You’ve got to bring it every day. We’ve still got to try to find ways to improve. We’re always trying to push the bar higher.\n\n“We finished No. 1 in ’03, but if we still played the same way that we did in ’03, we wouldn’t be in the top 20.”\n\nWhen they first started out, being the top-ranked doubles team in the world wasn’t something they spent a lot of time thinking about.\n\n“When we came on the tour, we just wanted to win our first Challenger,” Mike said of the ATP Challenger Tour, which is akin to the minor leagues. “Then you win your first (ATP World) Tour event, and once you win your first Slam, you kind of set your sights on No. 1. It’s kind of baby steps.”\n\nBaby steps are something with which Bob soon will be very familiar. His wife Michelle gave birth to the couple’s first child — a daughter named Micaela — the day after Bob and Mike lost in the final of the Australian Open in January.\n\n“I made it back from Australia and the baby was born 24 hours later,” Bob said. “I made it back at the buzzer.”\n\nLast week’s holiday in London was a family affair, as Micaela, who has her own Twitter account (@MicaelaBryan), came along. She was in Monaco last month when her dad and uncle won the Monte Carlo Masters, their 77th career title together — Mike has two more titles he won with other partners when his brother wasn’t available. As Bob and Mike posed for photos with their newest trophies, they laid the newest member of the family inside one of them.\n\nAs the brothers showed in Monte Carlo, they don’t plan to let family interfere with tennis.\n\n“We’re still very professional and we have our eye on what we need to do to win matches and win tournaments. We’re not going to sacrifice time on the court or time in the gym — ever,” Bob said. “What we do on the court is a couple hours a day, and we do an hour in the gym, so we have many hours a day to take care of the baby and go to the parks.\n\n“There’s a lot of downtime on the Tour. It’s not all busy.”\n\nThere’s a good chance Micaela will accompany Bob and Mike to Newport this summer. Perhaps she’ll even get chance to be photographed with another trophy."
