        "text": "Childhood and becoming “Coco”\n\nWhen Cori Dionne Gauff was barely school age she held a tennis racket and told her parents that she wanted to be the best player in the world. Her parents, Corey Gauff and Candi Odom Gauff, had been accomplished collegiate athletes. Father Corey played basketball for Georgia State University. Candi Odom attended Florida State University on a full athletic scholarship, competing in hurdles and heptathlon.\n\nBy the time Gauff was seven, she was training with a tennis pro two hours a day, several days a week. Mindful of the precedent Richard Williams had set with his tennis prodigy daughters, Venus and Serena, Corey Gauff suggested that the family move from Atlanta, where he was a vice president of a health care firm and Candi Gauff was a teacher, back to Delray Beach, Florida, home to some of the best tennis training camps in the world. Delray Beach was also Candi and Corey Gauff’s hometown. Candi Gauff homeschooled her daughter, who has two younger brothers, Codey and Cameron.\n\nAt age 10, Gauff was learning her sport at a French academy run by a tennis pro who had spent years working with Serena Williams. At 13, Gauff was the youngest U.S. Open junior girls finalist in history; in 2018, at 14, she became one of the youngest winners of the French Open junior girls tournament.\n\nIn July 2019 The New York Times published this headline:\n\nCori Gauff, 15, Seizes Her Moment, Upsetting Venus Williams at Wimbledon\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nAs a teenager and a relative newcomer to the international tennis scene, Gauff was still known by her birth name. But at home she had long been known by another moniker. She talked to Sports Illustrated Kids about her nickname, saying that sharing the same name as her father got confusing within the family: “I believe it was my aunt who said, ‘Oh, we should just call her Coco.’ When my dad was growing up, people used to call him Co.…Ever since then, I’ve been going by Coco.”\n\nSoon, there would be no more headlines about Cori Gauff.\n\nProfessional career\n\nThe win against Venus Williams in the first round of Wimbledon was a bit of a surreal moment for both players. Gauff was 15; Williams was 39. Gauff defeated Williams in straight sets in a stunning upset. When the competitors met at the net for the traditional handshake, Gauff tried to make the moment special. “I was just telling her thank you for everything she’s done for the sport,” Gauff said at the time. “She’s been an inspiration for many people. I was just really telling her thank you.”\n\nDespite her age, Gauff demonstrated skills that both set her apart and made her worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as other tennis prodigies, including Tracy Austin, Jennifer Capriati, and Andrea Jaeger. Tennis commentators have remarked on Gauff’s poise under pressure and the sheer power of her physical skills—her serves sometimes travel at 120 miles (193 km) per hour. Yet her professional career has not been without its setbacks. Since defeating Williams in the first round at Wimbledon, she has found herself ousted in the first round at the 2022 Australian Open and at Wimbledon in 2023.\n\nStill, Gauff has shown consistent improvement in her game on the world stage. She competed for her first Grand Slam title in the 2022 French Open finals against Iga Swiatek, who soundly beat her 6–1, 6–3. She has won four tournaments since turning professional in 2018, including the 2023 DC Open in Washington, D.C., followed by a win in the Cincinnati Masters. The summer of 2023 had her playing her best tennis as she entered one of the world’s most prestigious tournaments played in New York City at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.\n\nIn the final of the 2023 U.S. Open, Gauff lost the first set to Aryna Sabelenka of Belarus before staging a stunning come-from-behind win that ended with her on her knees and in tears at the Arthur Ashe Stadium. Gauff’s U.S. Open win – her first Grand Slam victory – put her in the company of Tracy Austin, who was 16 when she won the U.S. Open in 1979 and Serena Williams who won the Open at 17 in 1999."
