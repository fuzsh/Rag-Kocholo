        "text": "Stills from Zero Dark Thirty by Jonathan Olley / ©2012 Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. All rights reserved. Actor Stephen Dillane by The heated topic of the ethics of torture has spilled over into the upcoming confirmation hearings for current White House anti-terrorism chief John Brennan, who has been nominated by President Obama to be the next CIA director. A controversial pick, Brennan has been criticized for defending some “enhanced interrogation” tactics under the Bush administration, including some tactics that appear in the film. ABC News’ Z. Bryon Wolf suspects that Brennan is the inspiration for the unnamed “National Security Advisor” (Stephen Dillane) who explains to a CIA agent the President’s hesitancy to act on “partial intelligence.” While Brennan has expressed disapproval of the Bush techniques, here’s what he told CBS in a 2007 interview: “There has been a lot of information that has come out from these interrogation procedures that the agency has in fact used against the real hard-core terrorists,” he said. “It has saved lives.” Bill Harlow, a fellow CIA member, denies that Brennan had anything to do with the techniques used during 2002-2003. Washingtonian magazine has suggested that Tom Donilon may also have partly inspired this character.\n\nCIA Director (James Gandolfini) – Leon Panetta\n\nOne of the last bits of casting news revealed ahead of the release of Zero Dark Thirty was that James Gandolfini would play the role of Leon Panetta, the director of the CIA who oversaw the Bin Laden raid. While the credits list Gandolfini only as “CIA Director,” and he is never named in the film, Gandolfini himself has acknowledged that he plays a barely veiled version of the current Secretary of Defense. Anticipating that Panetta would not be impressed with the how he was going to look on screen, Gandolfini has said, “I sent a note to Leon saying, ‘I’m very sorry about everything. The wig, everything.’ ”\n\nAbu Ahmed (Tushaar Mehra) - Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti\n\nOne of the more obvious correlations between character and real-life inspiration is the key suspect in Maya’s hunt, Bin Laden’s courier, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. Just as in the film, “Kuwaiti drove a white S.U.V. whose spare-tire cover was emblazoned with an image of a white rhino” and was eventually tracked down to the compound where Bin Laden was hiding.\n\nAmmar (Reda Kateb) – Unknown\n\nSeveral possible inspirations have been suggested for the al-Qaida captive who is waterboarded in the movie’s opening scenes. Slate’s Emily Bazelon noted that he might most closely resemble Hassan Ghul, who told interrogators valuable information about Kuwaiti, and may have been subjected to some rough treatment—though the C.I.A. says he was not waterboarded.\n\nIn his opposition to the film’s torture scenes, Senator John McCain reportedly linked Ammar to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, noting that the “enhanced interrogation techniques” did “not provide [them] with key leads on bin Laden’s courier, “Abu Ahmed.” (In the film, Ammar eventually does provide them with that information.) However, whether it was misreported, or whether McCain misinterpreted the movie, this is a strange suggestion: There’s nothing in the movie to link Ammar with Mohammed, and in fact Mohammed is discussed as a separate character (referred to as “KSM”) in the movie.\n\nMeanwhile, Toby Young at The Telegraph states that Ammar is a composite of three Al Qaeda suspects, though how he arrived at this conclusion is unclear. Black Hawk Down author Mark Bowden also calls him a composite, and links him with a source named Mohammed al-Qhatani.\n\nDEVGRU - SEAL Team 6\n\nCredited in the movie by its formal abbreviation, the compound raid crew of DEVGRU (a shortening of the long-winded United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group) is represented by several actors including Chris Pratt (who plays “Justin”) and Joel Edgerton (who plays a squadron team leader named “Patrick”). With the exception of Bissonnette and Nicholas Cheque, who was killed in December 2012 during a rescue mission in Afghanistan, the squad’s members remain anonymous. Update, Jan. 16: While Cheque was named as a member of Seal Team 6, the government has never confirmed whether he was involved in the Bin Laden raid.\n\nThe Wolf (Fredric Lehne) – “Roger”\n\nThat CIA Counterterrorism chief we see practicing a Muslim prayer in his office—The Wolf, as he is named in the movie—is likely based on a man known by his cover name “Roger.” Roger, as described in a Washington Post profile, is a “collection of contradictions”—among them his conversion to Islam despite overseeing the death of Islamist militants. (His marriage to a Muslim woman was the catalyst for this conversion.) Unloved by most of his colleagues, some deem Roger responsible for the December 2009 Khost incident depicted in the film, which left seven CIA employees dead at the hands of an improperly vetted suicide bomber. Jennifer Matthews, who was one of the employees killed, was his protégé, and an unnamed source has cited Roger’s hiring of her as an example of the problems with the functioning of the counterterrorism system.\n\nThe dog - Cairo\n\nNot all of the heroes that night were human. Cairo, a Belgian Malinois, was with the SEALS during the compound raid, clad in special dog armor that can “withstand clouds of hot shrapnel,” and ready to sniff around for explosives or a secret hiding place for Bin Laden. For his bravery, Cairo earned a meeting with the President himself (described at length in the New Yorker) and was named Time’s Animal of the Year in 2011."
