        "text": "Declassification of documents has given rise to the allegation that the Central Intelligence Agency may have conducted unethical research targeting detainee subjects. That allegation is examined using document analysis and the development of research goals and roles as defined in the Common Rule. This article sets aside issues as to whether enhanced interrogation techniques described in the declassified documents rise to legal definitions of torture. Instead, it presents a post hoc ethics review raising questions addressed by Institutional Review Boards recommending the filing of a for-cause noncompliance complaint with the Office for Human Research Protection against the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nWe examine how the tracking of rendition aircraft has provided a much fuller understanding of the CIA's rendition, detention and interrogation programme. In particular, we show how this illuminated the role played by European states. Through various investigative methods, new rendition aircraft were identified, significant amounts of flight data were gathered, and data on all known and suspected rendition flights were collated into one public, searchable database. We show that examining logistical elements of covert programmes can prove fruitful for security and human rights research. Furthermore, we demonstrate the benefits of close academic–practitioner collaboration in the field of human rights.\n\nIn the weeks following the events of September 11, 2001, the Bush administration granted the CIA authority to set up detention facilities known as ‘black sites’ outside the United States, and to employ new interrogation procedures on suspected terrorists taken into custody. Recently released legal memoranda by the US Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel condoned the use of several interrogation techniques (such as water-boarding and prolonged sleep deprivation), which the US itself had previously condemned as torture. This paper examines the legal rationalizations the Bush administration advanced to circumvent international and national laws prohibiting torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. It also juxtaposes these rationalizations with medical evidence of the physical and psychological effects of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. Finally, it recommends several prohibitions and safeguards that the Obama admin...\n\nIt has now been more than three years since the summary of the US Senate report on CIA abuses (the ‘Torture Report’) reminded the world that after September 11, 2001, the CIA, through its ‘Rendition, Detention, and Interrogation’ (RDI) program, kidnapped, held in secret prisons, and systematically tortured people worldwide. This paper argues that is it important to have accountability and redress for the torture perpetrated by US officials and their foreign counterparts because: (1) it is required by international and US law; (2) impunity for such crimes will encourage their future perpetration; and (3) the victims deserve redress. Although the optimal venue to prosecute these crimes would be US courts, such prosecutions are unlikely to happen. Many legal scholars have called for invoking universal jurisdiction as a legal basis for international prosecutions; however, this paper argues that because of UJ’s weaknesses, it should be used only as a last resort. Traditional jurisdiction holds more promise for successful prosecutions and litigation. Since the RDI program involved 54 countries, there are many States that could prosecute, and many have already shown their willingness to do so. The paper concludes with clear prescriptions about which bases of traditional jurisdiction hold the most promise for obtaining redress for the victims and accountability for the perpetrators of the CIA's torture program.\n\nFacing an ostensible ‘threat-deficit’ at the end of the Cold War, some in America began to question the role of, and even need for the CIA. The events of September 11, 2001, however, catapulted the CIA into a frontline role in America’s War on Terror. But what has been the nature of this role? In this paper, using the CIA programmes of ‘Extraordinary Rendition’ and ‘Drone Strikes’ as focal point, it is argued that the CIA has been used by Presidents Bush and Obama as a tool of a fundamentally ‘Orientalist’ foreign policy that has sought, in vein most of the time, to control the most pernicious aspects of globalisation. Furthermore it is argued that this has brought the CIA’s dual-functions of intelligence analysis and covert operations into tension with each other and with ethics. Part 1, explores the relationship between intelligence and American national culture in relation to the notions of American ‘Exceptionalism’ and ‘Orientalism’, before linking them to processes of ‘globalisation’. Part 2 analyses the formation of the CIA’s rendition programme and the use of torture. Part 3 explores the continuity in Orientalist logic within the CIA’s use of drones and the ‘kill-not-capture’ doctrine of Obama, before concluding."
