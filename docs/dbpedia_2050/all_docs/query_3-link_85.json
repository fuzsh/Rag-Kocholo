        "text": "In Chicago's Little Palestine, locals protest and mourn amid Gaza war\n\nStanding outside his local mosque in suburban Chicago, Robhi Gharallah observed that Israel's war in Gaza is on everyone's mind in his neighbourhood.\n\n\"We're praying. We're protesting. We're raising funds. We're doing all we can for Gaza,\" Gharallah said after Friday prayer.\n\nBut Gharallah said there is one action he and his neighbours are uncertain about - and that is how to vote in the upcoming presidential election.\n\nGharallah lives in Bridgeview, Illinois, an area informally known as Chicago's Little Palestine. It is in Cook County and is home to an estimated 22 518 Palestinian Americans - one of the largest Palestinian communities in the US.\n\nBut he said Palestinian Americans are facing a dilemma in the next election, with both the Republican candidate Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Kamala Harris showing staunch support for Israel.\n\n\"There is no good in Ammar nor Amira,\" Gharallah said, using male and female names in Arabic to represent Trump and Harris.\n\n\"We are American citizens, and we want to vote, but we don't know for whom. Whether you vote for this one or this one, it's the same thing. And if you don't vote, it's like you don't exist [politically].\"\n\nBridgeview was in the national spotlight this month, as the Democratic National Convention arrived in Chicago.\n\n- Al Jazeera\n\nIsrael carries out West Bank air strike; Palestinian Authority says 5 dead\n\nIsrael said on Monday it carried out an air strike on the occupied West Bank, while the Palestinian Authority reported five killed in the incident.\n\n\"A short while ago, an aircraft struck an operational centre in the area of Nur Shams,\" an Israeli military spokesperson said, without providing a casualty count or specifying who was targeted.\n\n\"Five citizens were killed and others were injured,\" the official Palestinian news agency Wafa said.\n\nA correspondent for Wafa reported hearing four loud explosions and said Monday's strike targeted a house in the Nur Shams refugee camp.\n\nThe camp near Tulkarem has been the target of multiple Israeli army operations.\n\nFourteen people died in one two-day Israeli operation in Nur Shams in April, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent.\n\nIn July Israeli forces bulldozed the main street in Nur Shams during a raid that lasted 15 hours.\n\n- AFP\n\nGaza talks are making progress despite Israel-Hezbollah fighting, US says\n\nThe White House said Monday that Gaza truce talks in Cairo have made progress and were expected to continue at a working level for several days despite clashes between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah.\n\n\"There continues to be progress, and our team on the ground continues to describe the talks as constructive,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.\n\n\"So despite the rocket and drone attack by Hezbollah over the course of the weekend, which Israel did a terrific job defending against, it has not affected the actual work on the ground by the teams trying to get this ceasefire deal in place,\" Kirby said.\n\nThe United States has repeatedly voiced optimism for talks on reaching a truce proposed by President Joe Biden in the more than 10-month conflict, despite repeated differences voiced between Israel and Hamas.\n\n- AFP\n\nIsraeli hardliner Ben-Gvir repeats call for prayer at Al-Aqsa mosque compound\n\nIsrael's hardline Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir repeated a call for Jews to be allowed to pray at the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, drawing sharp criticism for inflaming tensions as ceasefire negotiators seek a deal to halt fighting in Gaza.\n\n\"The policy allows prayers on the Temple Mount, there is equal law between Jews and Muslims - I would build a synagogue there,\" Ben-Gvir was quoted as saying by Army Radio in a post on social media platform X, following an interview on Monday.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office immediately put out a statement restating the official Israeli position, which accepts decades-old rules restricting non-Muslim prayer at the mosque compound, known as Temple Mount to Jews, who revere it as the site of two ancient temples.\n\n\"There is no change to the status quo on the Temple Mount,\" Netanyahu's office said.\n\nThe hillside compound, in Jerusalem's Old City, is one of the most sensitive locations in the Middle East, holy for both Muslims and Jews, and the trigger for repeated conflict.\n\nBen-Gvir, head of one of two hardline religious-nationalist parties in Netanyahu's coalition, has a long record of making inflammatory statements appreciated by his own supporters, but conflicting with the government's official line.\n\n- Reuters\n\nMedia groups call on EU to suspend treaty, impose sanctions on Israel\n\nSome 60 media and rights organisations on Monday urged the European Union to suspend a co-operation accord with Israel and impose sanctions, accusing it of \"massacring journalists\" in Gaza.\n\n\"In response to the unprecedented number of journalists killed and other repeated press freedom violations by the Israeli authorities since the start of the war with Hamas, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and 59 other organisations are calling on the European Union to suspend its Association Agreement with Israel and to adopt targeted sanctions against those responsible\", the groups said in a joint statement.\n\nThe call came ahead of a meeting by EU foreign ministers in Brussels on 29 August. The period following Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and Israel's devastating retaliatory assault on the Gaza Strip \"has been the deadliest for journalists in decades\", the letter said. \"More than 130 Palestinian journalists and media professionals have been killed by the Israeli armed forces in Gaza since 7 October. At least 30 of them were killed in the course of their work, three Lebanese journalists and an Israeli journalist have also been (killed) during the same period\", it says.\n\n\"The targeted or indiscriminate killing of journalists, whether committed deliberately or recklessly, is a war crime\", it said. EU's association agreements with non-member countries are treaties that govern bilateral relations, including trade. The agreement's Article 2 stipulates \"respect for human rights and democratic principles\", said Julie Majerczak, the head of RSF's Brussels office.\n\n\"The Israeli government is clearly trampling on this article. The EU, which is Israel's leading trade partner, must draw the necessary conclusions from this and must do everything to ensure that the (Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu government stops massacring journalists and respects the right to information and press freedom by opening media access to Gaza,\" she said.\n\n- AFP\n\nNo agreement in Gaza ceasefire talks in Cairo; process to continue, sources say\n\nThere was no agreement on Sunday in the Gaza ceasefire talks that took place in Cairo, with neither Hamas nor Israel agreeing to several compromises presented by mediators, two Egyptian security sources said, casting doubt on the chances of success in the latest US-backed effort to end the 10-month old war.\n\nA senior US official, however, described the talks as \"constructive\", saying they were conducted in a spirit on all sides to reach \"a final and implementable agreement.\"\"The process will continue over the coming days through working groups to further address remaining issues and details,\" said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, adding that the teams would remain in Cairo.\n\nMonths of on-off talks have failed to produce an agreement to end Israel's devastating military campaign in Gaza or free the remaining hostages seized by Hamas in the militant group's Oct. 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war. Speaking at a news conference in Halifax, Canada, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Washington was still \"feverishly\" working in Cairo to get a ceasefire and a hostage deal. Key sticking points in ongoing talks mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar include an Israeli presence in the so-called Philadelphi Corridor, a narrow 14.5-km-long stretch of land along Gaza's southern border with Egypt.\n\nMediators put forward a number of alternatives to the presence of Israeli forces on the Philadelphi Corridor and the Netzarim Corridor which cuts across the middle of the Gaza Strip, but none were accepted by the parties, Egyptian sources said. Israel also expressed reservations on several of the Palestinian detainees Hamas is demanding the release of, and Israel demanded their exit of Gaza if they are released, the sources added.\n\nThere has been much back and forth between the teams from Israel, the United States and Egypt since Thursday to narrow the remaining gaps, the senior U.S. official said, in preparation for Saturday, when Qatar and Egypt met with senior representatives of Hamas to walk through the proposal in detail. On Sunday, senior officials from Israel joined the talks to address outstanding issues with the support of mediators, the senior US official said but did not provide a definitive assessment on whether there was a breakthrough or not.\n\nHamas said Israel has backtracked on a commitment to withdraw troops from the Corridor and put forward other new conditions, including the screening of displaced Palestinians as they return to the enclave's more heavily populated north when the ceasefire begins. \"We will not accept discussions about retractions from what we agreed to on 2 July or new conditions,\" Hamas official Osama Hamdan told the group's Al-Aqsa TV on Sunday.\n\n- Reuters\n\nLebanon ministry says 3 dead in Israeli strikes in south\n\nBeirut – Lebanon's health ministry said three people were killed on Sunday in Israeli raids in the country's south, after Israel launched strikes against Hezbollah, which announced a wide-scale attack on Israel.\n\nAn \"Israeli drone strike on a car in the village of Khiam\" killed one person, the health ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe Amal movement, a Hezbollah ally, later announced a fighter from Khiam had been killed.\n\nThe health ministry said that \"the Israeli occupation attack on the village of Tiri\" killed two people, without saying whether they were fighters or civilians.\n\nIt had earlier also reported two people including a Syrian man were wounded in \"a series of Israeli raids\" in the south.\n\nIsrael launched air strikes into Lebanon on Sunday, saying it had thwarted a large-scale Hezbollah attack while the Lebanese group said it had carried out its own raids to avenge a top commander's killing.\n\nThe Iran-backed movement has exchanged regular fire with Israel in support of its ally Hamas since the Palestinian militant group's 7 October attack on Israel sparked the Gaza war.\n\nBut fears of a wider regional conflagration soared after an Israeli strike on Beirut's southern suburbs in late July killed top Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, prompting vows of revenge.\n\nThe cross-border violence since October has killed some 605 people in Lebanon, mostly Hezbollah fighters but including at least 131 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nOn the Israeli side including in the annexed Golan Heights, authorities have announced the deaths of at least 23 soldiers and 26 civilians.\n\n- AFP\n\nUN, Lebanon PM urge de-escalation after Israel-Hezbollah strikes\n\nBeirut, Lebanon – The United Nations and Lebanon's prime minister urged de-escalation on Sunday after Israel struck Lebanon and Hezbollah said it launched attacks on Israeli positions, in a major escalation of cross-border hostilities.\n\nThe office of the UN special coordinator for Lebanon and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) \"call on all to cease fire and refrain from further escalatory action\", a joint statement said, describing the latest developments as \"worrying\".\n\n\"A return to the cessation of hostilities, followed by the implementation of UN Security Council resolution 1701, is the only sustainable way forward,\" the statement added.\n\nThe resolution ended a 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah and called for the Lebanese army and United Nations peacekeepers to be the only armed forces deployed in south Lebanon.\n\nLebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati on Sunday told ministers at an emergency meeting that he had been holding \"a series of contacts with Lebanon's friends to stop the escalation\".\n\n\"What is required is to stop the Israeli aggression first of all, and to apply Resolution 1701,\" a statement from his office said. Mikati also emphasised Lebanon's \"support for international efforts that could lead to a ceasefire in Gaza\", according to the statement.\n\nIran-backed Hezbollah has exchanged regular fire with Israel in support of its ally Hamas since the Palestinian militant group's 7 October attack on Israel sparked the Gaza war.\n\nCalls have mounted for the full implementation of the UN Resolution 1701 as a way of ending the current violence.\n\n- AFP\n\nAir France says suspending Tel Aviv, Beirut flights at least until Monday\n\nParis – Air France is suspending flights to Tel Aviv and Beirut scheduled for Sunday and Monday after Israel launched air strikes into Lebanon, the airline said.\n\n\"Flights today and tomorrow are suspended,\" a spokesperson for the French carrier said, adding that the suspension could be extended depending on the situation in the Middle East.\n\nAir France, which usually runs a daily service to both cities, had already halted flights to Beirut between 29 July and 15 August, but has kept flying to Tel Aviv.
