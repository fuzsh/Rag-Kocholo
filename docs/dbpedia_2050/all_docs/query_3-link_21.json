        "text": "Iraq's U.S.-appointed Governing Council member Mahmoud Othman says the Oil Ministry has been asked to gather information on allegations that Saddam's regime bribed prominent foreigners with oil money to back his regime. Othman also says a judicial probe may follow after information has been gathered by the ministry, but no formal investigation has been launched yet.\n\nThe comments by U.S. officials on al Qaeda's suspected ambitions for Iraq came on the same day of yet another bomb explosion.\n\nThis one - a roadside bomb - blew up in Baqouba, in central Iraq, wounding 10 Iraqis.\n\nWednesday, a suicide bomber sped through a security barrier in the heart of Baghdad and blew up a van disguised as an ambulance in front of a hotel, killing three people - including a South African - and wounding 17.\n\nAlso Wednesday, some 10,000 people in the town of Nasiriyah staged a protest to demand the resignation of the U.S.-appointed provincial governor.\n\nThe demonstration is seen as the latest sign of the growing empowerment of Iraq's majority Shiites who were repressed for decades by Saddam Hussein's Sunni-dominated regime.\n\nSunni insurgents loyal to the captured dictator are blamed for much of the ongoing violence in the country, such as Wednesday's suicide van bombing in an upscale Baghdad neighborhood.\n\nThursday's bomb in Baqouba exploded during the morning rush hour.\n\nCapt. Sabri Salar Hussein of the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps said eight corps members were injured in the blast along with two civilians.\n\n\"I accuse criminal and terrorist elements from the remnants of the former regime and terrorists who came from overseas for this act,\" Hussein said. \"This act will never terrorize us and we will keep persuing those terrorists.\"\n\nOne of the injured, corps member Younis Ali, said the bomb was placed in an abandoned cart. \"When we got closer to the cart, the explosion took place,\" he said. \"I could only see the smoke then.\"\n\nThe violence and the wider Shiite demands for early general elections have become the biggest headaches for the U.S.-led coalition administration as it nears a self-imposed deadline to hand over power to an unelected Iraqi government on July 1.\n\n\"No to Israel! No to imperialism! No to America!\" the crowd chanted in Nasiriyah, about 215 miles southeast of Baghdad, demanding that provincial governor Sabri al-Roumaith step down.\n\nCoalition officials said the governor left his office to defuse tensions after failing to placate the crowd but did not resign.\n\nTens of thousands of Shiites have held protests in various cities in Iraq this month to support al-Sistani's refusal to accept a U.S. plan to select a transitional government through an interim legislature chosen in regional caucuses before the planned July 1 hand over of power.\n\nHe is demanding direct elections but Washington cites the ongoing violence and the lack of electoral roles as a reason to delay elections until 2005.\n\nA United Nations team arrived Tuesday in Baghdad to determine whether it was safe for another U.N. team to come to Iraq to study prospects for an early elections.\n\nIt is hoped that the team's decision would end the deadlock between Washington and the Shiites. Al-Sistani has indicated that he will respect a U.N. decision."
