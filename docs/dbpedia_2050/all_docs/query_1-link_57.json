A three-judge bench, comprising Justice Javed Iqbal, Justice Khilji Arif Hussain and Justice Anwar Zaheer Jamali, was hearing the missing persons’ case. During May 2’s hearing, Jahangir appeared before the court on behalf of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) and stated that according to her information, a plan to amend the Anti-Terrorist Act to try terrorists in military courts was being considered. She asserted that such a recommendation had been given by three retired judges. Justice Javed Iqbal later said that the apex court did not interfere in the Government’s affairs and added that the courts had never encouraged mischief mongers, regretting that “criminals were released because Police in most of the cases failed to provide evidence”. He asked the interior minister not to take the directions of the apex court lightly. At the outset of the proceedings, Rehman Malik told the court that Balochistan was a victim of international terrorism.

After a tip off about Maoists having assembled there, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Jharkhand Jaguar, Jharkhand Armed Police (JAP) and District Armed Police personnel went to Urumuru village, but returned after not finding anyone. While the SFs were returning from Urumuru the Maoists ambushed them at Dhardhariya hills under Senha Police Station in the District. \"The Police had information that the Maoists were holding a meeting at Hurmu village on top of a hill, but when the Police party comprising CRPF and District Police reached the spot there was no sign of any Maoist movement,\" Inspector General of Police (IGP, Operation) R K Malik said. When the party was descending from the hill, they fell into an ambush laid by the Maoists, who had planted Improvised Explosive Device (IED) in and around an area of two kilometres, each at a distance of 1.5-2 feet, the IG said.

State Home Secretary U. N. Behera said, “The State has already formed 50 SOG units comprising 1,800 jawans [troopers]. Another 1,800 jawans will be recruited under the SOG units.” “We have plans to recruit another 5,000 constables to fill up the vacancies. The Government has already given the financial approval,” Behera added. Apart from raising the SOG units, the Government is also planning to set up four counter-insurgency anti-terrorists (CIT) schools in the State. Behera said the proposed CIT schools would impart training to the troopers of Odisha Police. The schools would come up at Chandaka, Rourkela and Koraput. Similarly, Police training schools would also come up at Bairi and Sambalpur. The Odisha Government has also decided to urge the Centre to initiate steps in providing an 18-seater chopper to the State. “We have started negotiating with the Pawan Hansh. During our proposed meeting with the cabinet secretary, we have decided to raise this issue,” said a senior officer. Five battalions of the Border Security Force (BSF), seven battalions of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), 50 units of the SOG, four battalions of the India Reserve Battalions (IRB) and personnel of one Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA) battalion have been put into service across the Maoists-infested Districts in the State.
