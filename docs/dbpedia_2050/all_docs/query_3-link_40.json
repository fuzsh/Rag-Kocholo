        "text": "Year Captured: 2002\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 1590 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nAbu Zubaydah, believed to be a senior Al Qaeda leader, was captured in a raid in late March 2002, during which he was injured by gunfire. As he recovered, he initially cooperated with the FBI, identifying Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. Once the CIA took custody, it implemented its new interrogation program. Zubaydah was kept naked, hooded and sleep deprived in an all-white room with loud music or noise and bright lights. He was slammed against a concrete wall. He was placed in a large confinement box -- the size of a coffin -- for 266 hours, and in a smaller box, two-and-a half feet long and wide, for 29 hours. Interrogators grabbed his face and slapped him. The first time he was waterboarded, the session lasted two-and-a-half hours, and led to coughing, vomiting, and \"involuntary spasms of the torso and extremities,\" according to CIA documents. The Senate report notes at least one record of Zubaydah receiving \"rectal fluid resuscitation\" for \"partially refusing liquids.\" One of his eyes began to deteriorate, causing some concern because, as a CIA cable noted, \"[w]e have a lot riding upon his ability to see, read and write.\"\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nOn Aug. 10, 2002, six days into the CIA procedures, the interrogation team said it was \"highly unlikely\" that Zubaydah had any useful information, according to CIA documents. According to the Senate report: âAt no time during or after the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques did Abu Zubaydah provide information about operatives in, or future attacks against, the United States.â Abu Zubaydah is currently in detention in Guantanamo Bay. He ultimately lost the damaged eye.\n\nYear Captured: 2002\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 1370 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nNashiri was subjected to nudity and left standing with his arms shackled over his head for at least 16 hours. He also was subjected to rectal feeding of Ensure, \"in a forward-facing position with head lower than torso,â according to CIA documents. The CIA didn't glean much information from Nashiri, but by December 2002 interrogators reported to headquarters that he was \"cooperative and truthful\" and wasn't withholding any important threat information. Headquarters was unconvinced, however, and sent another officer who had not been trained as an interrogator to question Nashiri. The chief of the entity that managed the detention and interrogation program objected, saying that the officer was untrained. The chief also reported that he had heard that the officer âwas too confident, had a temper and had some security issues.\" The officer placed Nashiri in a standing stress position for two-and-a-half days. At a later point, he put a pistol near Nashiri's head and operated a cordless drill near his body. The report documented other unapproved techniques, including slapping Nashiri on the back of the head; implying that his mother would be sexually abused in front of him; blowing cigar smoke in his face; forced bathing with a stiff brush; and forcing him into stress positions that caused cuts and bruises and threatened to dislocate his shoulder.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nThe Senate report noted that Nashiri did not provide âany additional threat information during, or afterâ the unapproved interrogations. His interrogator was suspended for a year and later retired. Nashiri remains in detention in Guantanamo Bay.\n\nYear Captured: 2003\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 1280 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nOnce thought to be the 20th 9/11 hijacker, al-Shibh was subjected to harsh treatment before his interrogations began. He was shaved, shackled with his arms over his head and kept naked in a white room with bright lights and loud music. His interrogations involved the full range of CIA tactics: He was subjected to sleep deprivation for more than 72 hours and kept on a liquid diet. He was slapped in his face and stomach. Al-Shibh was thrown up against the wall, forced into cramped boxes and put into stress positions. The CIA also approved waterboarding \"as appropriate to [his] level of resistance.\" Some of the techniques were used to punish al-Shibh before questions were even asked of him, for example, when he complained of stomach pain, when he failed to address an interrogator as \"sir,\" or when he had a \"blank stare\" on his face, according to CIA documents.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nAl-Shibh was interrogated for five months by an unnamed foreign government before being handed over to the CIA. He provided useful information that was deemed \"generally accurate,\" including intelligence about potential terror attacks. \"Overall, he provided what was needed,\" the CIA said at the time. After that, CIA headquarters requested that EITs continue to be used against him. The interrogations led to visions, paranoia, insomnia and attempts at self-harm. A CIA psychologist noted that al-Shibhâs two-and-a half years of \"social isolation\" was having a \"clear and escalating effect on his psychological functioning.\" He was later sent to Guantanamo Bay, where he was placed on anti-psychotic medications, and where he remains. He is currently being tried by a military commission for his alleged role in 9/11.\n\nYear Captured: 2003\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 1280 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nA high-value detainee, Hambali, also known as Riduan bin lsomuddin, is accused of being a top Al Qaeda member responsible for the October 2002 bombings in Bali, which killed more than 200 people. He was subjected to the CIAâs enhanced interrogation techniques almost immediately, despite his cooperation before they began. The Senate report found that in Hambali's case, these techniques most likely included sensory deprivation, loud noise in a white room with bright lights, cold temperatures and being left standing shackled.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nHambali provided information that was later determined to be fabricated. A CIA cable noted, \"He had provided the false information in an attempt to reduce the pressure on himself ... and to give an account that was consistent with what [he] assessed the questioners wanted to hear.\" A cable noted that the CIA \"assesse[d] [Hambali]'s admission of previous fabrication to be credible.â He is currently in detention in Guantanamo Bay.\n\nYear Captured: 2003\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 1260 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nThe mastermind of 9/11 cooperated during his interrogation the first day, according to the Senate report, but the CIA disregarded that intelligence, because the agency assumed he would lie. CIA interrogators then applied the full scale of enhanced interrogation techniques to Mohammed, including rectal rehydration without medical need. He endured sleep deprivation for seven-and-a-half days -- about 180 hours. Interrogators also threatened his children. Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times. During sessions on March 12, 2003, a CIA medical officer said that \"we are basically doing a series of near drownings.\"\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nThe CIA noted that the enhanced interrogation methods led Mohammed to \"clam up.\" A March 14, 2003 cable said that the \"overall view seems to be\" that waterboarding \"is not working in gaining [his] compliance.\" After this and other similar communications, waterboarding continued for another 10 days. Mohammed was ultimately handed over to the military. He is in detention in Guantanamo Bay, on trial by a military commission for his role in the 9/11 attacks.\n\nYear Captured: 2003\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 1260 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nHawsawi was doused with water while lying on his back, in a way that approximated waterboarding, according to the Senate report. CIA headquarters had not approved water dousing for him. An interrogator who did not participate in the water dousing sessions said in an email that the treatment Hawsawi described to him âcould be indistinguishable from the waterboard.â As the interrogator wrote, âI have serious reservations about watering them in a prone position,â adding, âIf one is held down on his back, on the table or on the floor, with water poured in his face I think it goes beyond dousing.â The CIA inspector general later investigated the incident, and concluded that what happened to Hawsawi reflected âthe way water dousing was done at [Detention Site Cobalt],â and that the procedure was developed with guidance from both CIA attorneys and the CIAâs Office of Medical Services. At one point, Hawsawi was one of two detainees given a rectal exam with \"excessive force.\" Hawsawi was later diagnosed with chronic hemorrhoids, an anal fissure and symptomatic rectal prolapse, the report said.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nItâs not clear what information Hawsawi may have provided the CIA -- details remain classified. He was ultimately transferred to Guantanamo Bay, where he remains in detention. He is currently on trial by a military commission for his alleged role in the 9/11 attacks.\n\nYear Captured: 2003\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 1240 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nBefore questioning began, Jaza'iri was subjected to sensory deprivation -- shaved, exposed to loud noise in a white room with bright lights and kept naked in the cold. According to CIA records, he was shackled \"hand and foot with arms outstretched over his head (with his feet firmly on the floor and not allowed to support his weight with his arms).â Under interrogation, he was subjected to near-constant questioning, sleep deprivation, a liquid diet and continued sensory deprivation, according to the Senate report. He also was âbathed,â according to the Senate report, a term used to describe water dousing. Jazaâiriâs interrogators never sought authorization to use water dousing against him.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nJazaâiri provided corroborating information, but nothing he offered was considered âunique or new information,â according to the Senate report. According to the Rendition Project, Jazaâiri is no longer in CIA custody, but his whereabouts are unknown.\n\nYear Captured: 2003\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 1180 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nBaluchi was subjected to âenhanced interrogation techniques,â although details on which specific techniques he was put through are unknown.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nBaluchi, who was suspected of planning an attack on the U.S. consulate in Karachi, was picked up by Pakistani authorities acting on their own intelligence. He was interrogated by Pakistani authorities for several weeks, and provided extensive information on the planning, targets and method of attack, before he was handed over to the CIA. The agency said that both Baluchi and another detainee, Khallad bin Attash provided \"new information\" on the Karachi attack plans after undergoing enhanced interrogation techniques, but the Senate report said that isnât true. That assertion was repeated by President George W. Bush in a Sept. 6, 2006 speech saying that \"terrorists held in CIA custody ... helped stop a planned attack on the U.S. consulate in Karachi using car bombs and motorcycle bombs.\" Baluchi remains in detention at Guantanamo Bay. He is on trial by military commission for his alleged role in the 9/11 attacks.\n\nYear Captured: 2003\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 1180 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nAttash was approved for a series of techniques, including facial grabs, slaps, walling and water dousing.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nBin Attash, like Ammar al-Baluchi, was picked up by Pakistani authorities with whom he cooperated before he was handed over to the CIA. The CIA said that both Baluchi and Attash provided \"new information\" on attack plans in Karachi after undergoing enhanced interrogation techniques. That statement was repeated by President George W. Bush in a Sept. 6, 2006 speech saying that \"terrorists held in CIA custody ... helped stop a planned attack on the U.S. consulate in Karachi using car bombs and motorcycle bombs.\" The Senate report, however, said that isn't true. Attash, also known as Wallid bin Attash, is currently in detention in Guantanamo Bay.\n\nYear Captured: 2003\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 1180 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nAlso known as Abu Hudhaifa, Saidi was stripped and shackled naked in the standing position with hands above his head even before the interrogation began. He would later be subjected to 66 hours of standing sleep deprivation. But the CIA discontinued the treatments after his leg began to swell. He was also kept naked and subjected to dietary manipulation. Saidi also was immersed in ice-water baths while also being doused with water, though those were not approved by CIA headquarters. One CIA psychologist reported: âI heard [Abu Hudhaifa] gasp out loud several times as he was placed in the tub.â CIA records showed that he was shivering, and interrogators worried his body temperature would drop too low. The Senate report says it could not locate any records or requests to use any techniques against Saidi.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nSaidi was released, the Senate report notes, âbecause the CIA discovered he was likely not the person he was believed to be.â He was handed back to Algeria, which allowed him to go free, according to the Rendition Project.\n\nYear Captured: 2003\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 1180 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nKhan was stripped and shackled naked in the standing position with his hands above head. Later, he was subjected to sleep deprivation, nudity, dietary manipulation, the Senate report said, and according to his own account, an ice water bath. Khan fought back against his detention, attempting to harm himself and refusing food. For a while, he agreed to take in nutrients intravenously, the Senate report said, although the CIA maintains he was always uncooperative. After about three weeks on hunger strike, CIA interrogators subjected him to involuntary rectal feeding and hydration. They also pureed the contents of his lunch tray, which included hummus, pasta with sauce, nuts and raisins, and fed it into Khanâs rectum.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nAn unidentified foreign government initially held Khan. While in detention, he provided âextensive information,â according to the Senate report. After he was handed over to the CIA and subjected to its techniques, he offered nothing more. The Senate report notes that the CIA âinaccurately attributed informationâ Khan provided to the foreign government to its interrogations of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. He has been transferred to Guantanamo Bay, where he remains.\n\nYear Captured: 2003\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 1150 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nAlso known as Abu Zubair, bin Amin was subjected to stress positions designed to cause pain in the joints, including one in which he was forced to kneel on the floor. At one point, the CIA chief of interrogations placed a broomstick behind his knees. The stress position was approved; the broomstick was not. Little more is known about what was done to him in custody.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nBin Amin, a member of the Southeast Asian terror group Jemaaah Islamiyah and an admitted Al Qaeda operative, is considered a high-value detainee by the U.S., according to the Department of Defense. He was later transferred to Guantanamo Bay, where he remains.\n\nYear Captured: 2003\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 1100 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nBefore he was handed over to the CIA, Lap, also known as Lillie, cooperated with unnamed investigators and aided in the capture of another operative the CIA had been seeking, Riduan bin Isomuddin, also known as Hambali. Once he was in CIA custody, but before questioning began, Lillie was subjected to the standard sensory deprivation procedure, and left standing naked and shackled with his hands above his head. Interrogators were approved to use EITs on him, but gathered little information of value.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nA 2004 CIA cable noted that \"Lillie is of limited value,\" adding that \"[h]is English is very poor, and we do not have a Malay linguist.\" He remains detained in Guantanamo Bay.\n\nYear Captured: 2004\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 940 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nA Pakistani, Ghul was initially captured in Iraqi Kurdistan in 2004 and sent from U.S. military custody to CIA custody, where for two days he cooperated, offering information on the \"facilitator\" who led the U.S. to Osama bin Laden, according to the Senate report. \"He sang like a tweetie bird,\" one officer said. Once in CIA custody, Ghul was subjected to multiple âtechniques.â He was shaved, stripped and placed in standing position against a wall with his hands above his head for two hours. He also endured 59 hours of sleep deprivation at one point, which led to hallucinations. A CIA physician assistant reported \"notable physiological fatigue,\" including \"abdominal and back muscle pain/spasm, 'heaviness' and mild paralysis of arms, legs and feet [that] are secondary to his hanging position and extreme degree of sleep deprivation.\"\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nOnce in CIA custody, Ghul provided no additional information and only repeated what he had already told the U.S. military. Still, on May 5, 2011, the CIA said that Ghul provided \"tier one\" information about bin Laden. Itâs not clear where Ghul was transferred. He may have been killed in a drone strike in 2012.\n\nYear Captured: 2004\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 920 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nGul was initially implicated in a plot by a source whose account was later determined to be fabricated. His sleep deprivation led to âfrightfulâ hallucinations, the CIA reported. In addition to âcontinuous sleep deprivation,\" Gul was also subjected to \"facial holds, attention grasps, facial slaps, stress positions, and walling, until he experienced auditory and visual hallucinations.â A CIA cable noted that he was \"not oriented to time or place,\" and that he saw \"his wife and children in the mirror and had heard their voices in the white noise.\" He was also made to use a diaper. A CIA cable noted that \"[Gul] asked to die, or just be killed.\" Beginning on July 22, 2004, techniques used on Gul were individually approved by the Justice Department.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nGul was determined not to be a senior Al Qaeda member, as initially believed. The chief of the detention facility wrote that \"there simply is no 'smoking gun' that we can refer to that would justify our continued holding of [Janat Gul].\" Interrogators further noted, \"Team does not believe [Gul] is withholding imminent threat information; however team will continue to press [Gul] for that during each session.\" He was handed over to an unnamed foreign government, and ultimately released, according to the Rendition Project.\n\nYear Captured: 2004\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 810 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nMasri, an Egyptian, was initially detained by a foreign government, with whom he cooperated. When he entered CIA custody, he offered to continue cooperating, saying he was afraid of being tortured because he had been tortured before in a third, unidentified, country. The then CIA sought approval to use \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" against Masri. All techniques used on him were individually approved by the Justice Department.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nMasri was implicated in connection to a plot by a source whose account was later determined to be fabricated. The CIA eventually transferred Masri to the country where he had previously been tortured. (The name of the country was redacted.)\n\nYear Captured: 2004\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 730 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nGhailani, one of the U.S. governmentâs high-value detainees, was a Tanzanian indicted in absentia for the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. He was arrested in Pakistan before being handed over to the CIA. He was subjected to \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" because, according to a CIA cable, his previous interrogation by an unnamed foreign government had been âineffectiveâ since Ghailani âdenied knowledge of current threats.â The Senate report notes that sleep deprivation led Ghailani to experience auditory hallucinations. EITs used on Ghailani were individually approved by the Justice Department.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nThe Senate report notes that the CIA's assessment of Ghailani's knowledge is \"speculative.\" Ghailani was implicated in a plot by a source whose account was later determined to be fabricated. He was initially transferred to Guantanamo Bay and set to be tried by a military commission. Once President Barack Obama took office, his trial was moved to a federal court. He was convicted of conspiracy in 2010 and sentenced to life in prison. Ghailani did not say that he was tortured during a tribunal at Guantanamo, so that didn't come up in the federal trial. But according to Human Rights Watch, he wrote in more recent court filings that he had been â a victim of the cruel âenhanced interrogation techniques,ââ and that he had not been afforded due process rights.\n\nYear Captured: 2003\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 720 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nWhen he first entered CIA custody, Abu Hazim, also known as Abu Hazim al-Libi, had a broken foot. A note in his âinterrogation planâ recommended that he not be subjected to walling, stress positions or cramped confinement. In fact, the regional medical officer recommended that he avoid \"all weight bearing activities\" for five weeks, according to the report. One cable noted that he should be \"seated, secured to a cell wall\" while undergoing sleep deprivation. Thatâs not what happened. In addition to multiple other techniques -- facial grabs, poor food and continued nudity -- Abu Hazim was subjected to at least 52 hours of standing sleep deprivation, according to CIA records. He was also subjected to repeated walling, the report said, and water dousing -- with his injured foot wrapped in plastic. One CIA linguist said Abu Hazim was subjected to water dousing in a way that looked a lot like waterboarding: \"When water dousing was used on Abu Hazim, a cloth covered Abu Hazim's face, and [redacted] poured cold water directly on Abu Hazim's face to disrupt his breathing.\" A physician's assistant removed the cloth when he turned blue. A CIA inspector general investigation later concluded there was no corroboration of the linguist's account, and no action was taken.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nAbu Hazim was ultimately sent back to Libya while it was still under the control of Muammar Gaddafi. Since he had fought against the regime, he was arrested and tortured, according to the Rendition Project. After the fall of Gaddafi, he led the Libyan National Guard.\n\nYear Captured: 2002\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 690 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nNajar, also known as Najjar, was a Tunisian captured in Pakistan. He was not suspected of having information on a terror plot or even a role in planning one, but CIA interrogators hoped he might know something about Osama bin Laden or other Al Qaeda operatives. He was kept shackled and hooded in his cell, subjected to loud music, cold temperatures and isolation in total darkness. He was also subjected to sleep deprivation and forced to wear a diaper. At one point, he was left hanging in handcuffs for 22 hours a day for two consecutive days.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nMore than one month into the \"enhanced interrogation techniques,\" CIA interrogators reported that Najar was \"clearly a broken man\" and \"on the verge of complete breakdown\" and would do whatever the CIA asked, according to agency documents. His interrogation became the model for others treated at a black site, identified as \"Cobalt\" in the Senate report. The CIA distributed one intelligence report from what it gathered from Najar that remains classified. Najar is currently reported to be in Afghan custody.\n\nYear Captured: 2002\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 540 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nRabbani, also known as Abu Badr, was arrested in a case of mistaken identity by Pakistani authorities, who believed that he was a man named Hassan Ghul. âInterestingly, he denies being Hassan Ghul â claiming Hassan Ghul is someone else,â a CIA cable noted. Rabbani was arrested with his driver, Muhammad Madni, who told the officers that Rabbani was a âmajor al Qaeda [facilitatator],â the CIA said. Rabbani was subjected to forced standing, attention grasps and left in a cold cell without blankets. Little more is known about his treatment, apart from that he was subjected to techniques without the approval of CIA headquarters.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nAfter more than 18 months, Rabbani was transferred out of CIA custody to the Department of Defense. He is currently detained in Guantanamo Bay.\n\nYear Captured: 2002\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 510 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nBahir was arrested with Gul Rahman, who died in custody after less than 20 days. Bahir was also subjected to the CIA's \"enhanced interrogation techniques,\" but the Senate report provides no details on what happened to him. He later told the Associated Press that during his detention, he was âleft naked, sleeping on the barren concrete.â He also said interrogators tied him to a chair and sat on his stomach. He said he was hung naked for hours. Bahir said he fought back, throwing his latrine bucket at the guards, and threatened to kill them. In return, he was âroughed up,â the AP said, and doused with water.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nAfter a stint in Defense Department custody at Bagram Airbase in Afghanistan, Bahir was released in 2008, according to the Rendition Project.\n\nYear Captured: 2003\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 480 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nAlso known as Abd al-Karim, Al-Shara'iya had a broken foot when he was captured, and it was recommended that he not be subjected to âextended standing for a couple of weeks.â The CIA noted in his âinterrogation planâ that he shouldnât be subjected to walling, stress positions or cramped confinement. Regardless, Abd al-Karim endured two 45-minute sessions of cramped confinement and repeated walling, the report said, as well as a stress position that, according to CIA documents involved his \"head on [the] wall, bent at waist, shuffled backwards to a safe, yet uncomfortable position.â He was also made to walk for 15 minutes every half-hour for a night and morning, according to CIA reports. Al-Sharaâiya also told Human Rights Watch that he was waterboarded in CIA detention. The CIA has no record of the procedure being used against him. Officials, including President George W. Bush, have said that only three detainees were waterboarded by the CIA: Abu Zubaydah, Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. But Al-Sharaâiya later told interviewers that he was hooded and strapped to a wooden board in detention. âThen they start with the water pouring,â he said. âThey start to pour water to the point where you feel like you are suffocating.\" He added: âThey wouldnât stop until they got some kind of answer from me.â He said it happened numerous times.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nA few days after being forced to walk and stand on his broken foot, a CIA cable said that Al-Shara'iya would, at best, have permanently limited motion and arthritis for the rest of his life. He was ultimately returned to Libya, where he was imprisoned for having fought with a resistance group against Muammar Gaddafi. He was sentenced to life in prison, but then released as the Libyan uprising began in 2011, according to the Rendition Project.\n\nYear Captured: 2005\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 460 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nAl-Libi, a Libyan detainee, was interrogated for more than a month by the CIA with \"enhanced interrogation techniques,\" although the Senate report doesnât offer additional details. Several times, al-Libi complained of hearing loss, for which he was punished with additional âtechniques.â Interrogators thought he was trying to resist interrogation, although it turned out later that wasnât the case. When he arrived later at Guantanamo Bay, he was fitted for a hearing aid.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nEventually, the CIA stopped interrogating him because âCIA officers stated that they had no intelligence to demonstrate that Abu Faraj al-Libi continued to withhold information.â The agency's medical officers were also concerned that continued interrogations âmay come with unacceptable medical or psychological risks.â He is currently being held in Guantanamo Bay.\n\nYear Captured: 2005\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 280 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nAt one point during his CIA questioning, al-Iraqi was doused with 44 degree water for 18 minutes. He was also left shackled in the standing position for 54 hours, leading to swelling in his lower legs that required him to be given a blood thinner and spiral ace bandages. âHe was moved to a sitting position, and his sleep deprivation was extended to 78 hours. After the swelling subsided, he was provided with more blood thinner and was returned to the standing position.â His sleep deprivation was extended to 102 hours. After four hours of sleep, he was subjected to another 52 hours of deprivation. At that point, CIA headquarters intervened, noting that detainees need a minimum of eight hoursâ rest between sleep deprivation sessions lasting longer than 48 hours. Iraqi suffered from an edema on his head from the walling; abrasions on his neck and blisters on his ankles from the shackles. It's not clear where the neck abrasions came from.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nA draft of the Dec. 13, 2005 president's daily brief (PDB) said that al-Iraqi provided \"almost no information that could be used to locate former colleagues or disrupt attack plots,\" which, the report notes, was the information that justified the EITs. That information was deleted from the draft after one of the interrogators objected. \"If we allow the Director to give this PDB, as it is written, to the President, I would imagine the President would say, 'You asked me to risk my presidency on your interrogations, and now you give me this that implies the interrogations are not working. Why do we bother?' We think the tone of the PDB should be tweaked,\" the interrogator wrote. Iraqi was ultimately handed over to the U.S. military. His current whereabouts are unclear.\n\nYear Captured: 2004\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 260 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nLittle is known about Ibrahim -- apparently, even by the CIA. He was subjected to sleep deprivation for three days, exceeding the 48 hours approved by CIA headquarters, and possibly other techniques. Five days into the interrogation, according to the Senate report, interrogators sent a cable to CIA headquarters asking for information that would âdefinitively link [Ibrahim] to nefarious activity or knowledge by [Ibrahim] of known nefarious activities of Al Qaeda members, if this is possible.â His interrogators continued to subject him to its interrogation techniques while they waited for a response.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nTwo debriefers told CIA headquarters that Ibrahim was âat best â¦ a low-level facilitator,â an assessment the agency initially rejected. Ultimately, however, the CIA determined that it was âuncertainâ whether he should be detained at all. His current whereabouts are unknown.\n\nYear Captured: 2007\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 240 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nRahim was the CIAâs last detainee, captured in 2007. He had an initial conversation with CIA interrogators, during which he declined to answer questions about threats to the U.S., or where top Al Qaeda leaders might be located. He was deemed uncooperative, and the CIA decided to place him through its enhanced interrogation program. Michael Hayden, then the director of the CIA, wrote a letter formally asking the president for an executive order that would allow the U.S. to interpret the Geneva Conventions to allow Rahim to be interrogated using its techniques. Six of the techniques -- sleep deprivation, dietary manipulation, facial grab, facial slap, abdominal slap and attention grab -- were cleared by the president's office of legal counsel, and the executive order was issued the same day, July 20, 2007. For sleep deprivation, Rahim was shackled in a standing position, wearing a diaper, and fed only water and liquid Ensure meals. He was subjected to 104.5 hours of sleep deprivation from July 21 to 25, 2007, but it was stopped when he began to have \"visual and auditory hallucinations.\" He was then allowed to sleep, but when a psychologist said that he had been faking his symptoms, he was subjected to an additional 62 hours of sleep deprivation. A third session was stopped after 13 hours, because there was a limit of 180 hours in a 30 day period. He was later subjected to a fourth session for 104 hours. There would be four more sessions lasting for 138.5 hours in November 2007.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nThe CIA described Rahim, an Afghan, as \"one of a handful of Al Qaeda facilitators working directly for bin Laden and Zawahiri,\" but because they wanted to subject him to their âenhanced interrogation techniques,â CIA interrogators waited a week to get approval for their methods before speaking with him, the Senate report said. The resulting interrogation, the Senate report said, âresulted in no disseminated intelligence reports.â Rahim is currently detained in Guantanamo Bay.\n\nYear Captured: 2003\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 150 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nAsadallah, also known as Muhammad Umar 'Abd al-Rahman, was stripped and left naked and shackled in the standing position, with his hands above his head before questioning even began. He was later subjected to water dousing, nudity and cramped confinement even though his interrogators hadnât sought or received authorization from CIA headquarters, according to the Senate report. He was also made to kneel in a stress position despite complaining of discomfort. Although he had a sprained ankle, Asadallah was left in the standing sleep deprivation position. He was also put into a âsmall isolation boxâ for 30 minutes without authorization or concern for how it might affect his ankle, the Senate report said.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nWhen the program first began, the CIA told the Justice Department that it would only use \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" on detainees who knew about imminent threats, or were directly involved in planning attacks. Asadallah was only suspected of knowing the location of top Al Qaeda operatives, including Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri. But he, along with at least five others, were still subjected to the CIAâs âenhanced interrogation techniques.â Later, on July 20, 2007, the Justice Department would expand its policy to allow the use of the CIAâs techniques for people suspected of knowing the whereabouts of top Al Qaeda operatives. Asadallah was rendered to detention in Egypt before being released in 2010, according to the Rendition Project.\n\nYear Captured: 2004\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 130 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nTurki is one of two detainees who was a former CIA informant, who at the time of his capture was working for an unnamed foreign government. (His name is a pseudonym.) Turki had been trying to contact the CIA for weeks with information before his capture. Before questioning began, he was subjected to sensory deprivation -- shaved, exposed to loud noise in a white room with bright lights, kept naked in the cold, and shackled, according to CIA records, âhand and foot with arms outstretched over his head (with his feet firmly on the floor and not allowed to support his weight with his arms).â Under interrogation, he was subjected to near-constant questioning, sleep deprivation, a liquid diet and continued sensory deprivation, according to the Senate report.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nWhen he was first rendered to the CIA, the agency was aware that Turki worked for a foreign partner government, according to the Senate report. But his messages to the CIA warning about future attacks hadn't been translated. Once they were, and headquarters determined he shouldn't be in custody, he was held for several more months before being released.\n\nYear Captured: 2004\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 130 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nAl-Magrebi was one of two detainees who were former CIA informants. At the time of his capture, he was working for an unnamed foreign government. (His name is a pseudonym.) He had been trying to contact the CIA for weeks with information before his capture. In CIA custody, he was subjected to at least 24 hours of sleep deprivation, during which he was left standing shackled, with his hands above his head. In this position, detainees were usually nude.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nThe CIA was aware that Magrebi worked for a foreign partner government, according to the Senate report. Once his messages were translated by headquarters and it became clear he should not be in custody, he was held for several more months before being released.\n\nYear Captured: 2003\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 80 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nBefore his questioning began, al-Barq was subjected to what would become a standard procedure for several detainees. He was subjected to sensory deprivation -- shaved, exposed to loud noise in a white room with bright lights, kept naked in the cold and shackled, according to the CIA records, âhand and foot with arms outstretched over his head (with his feet firmly on the floor and not allowed to support his weight with his arms).â Under interrogation, he was subjected to near-constant questioning, sleep deprivation, a liquid diet and continued sensory deprivation, according to the Senate report. According to CIA records, at one point during his questioning, Barq told interrogators, âWe never made anthrax,â but was told that they wouldnât stop until he âtold the truth.â Crying, Barq said, âI made the anthrax.â The interrogators asked if he was lying, and he said he was. They then âdemonstrated the penalty for lying,â and Barq replied, âI made the anthrax,â but then recanted. Two days later, CIA records say, Barq said he lied about making anthrax âonly because he thought thatâs what the interrogators wanted.â\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nAl-Barq said he was given $1,000 by an Al Qaeda operative to buy a house in Karachi where biological weapons could be produced. He also talked about the groupâs ambitions to build a biological weapons program, but the Senate report said: âNeither of these reports is cited in CIA records as providing new or unique information.â A Palestinian, Barq was sent to Jordan, and ultimately to Israel, where he reportedly remains in detention.\n\nYear Captured: 2002\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 70 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nShaukatâs detention was previously undisclosed by the CIA, and it is unclear what was done to him. In one cable, the CIA reported he was \"tired from his regimen of limited sleep deprivation,\" and that he was subjected to unapproved techniques.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nShaukat was not determined to have much critical information. His involvement with Al Qaeda members was âlimited to personal relationships with former neighbors,â according to the Senate report. The Rendition Project, which has tracked CIA detainees, said that Shaukat was transferred out of CIA custody in either December 2002 or January 2003. Itâs not clear where he is now.\n\nYear Captured: 2002\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 50 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nAl-Hamiâs detention by the CIA was unknown until the Senate report. Most of what was done to him remains classified, but the Tunisian was subjected to \"enhanced interrogation techniques,\" including 72 hours of sleep deprivation that was not authorized by CIA headquarters.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nThe CIA determined that he was not a member of Al Qaeda. After being transferred to Defense Department custody and spending seven years in Guantanamo Bay, al-Hami was ultimately released in 2010 and sent to to Slovakia.\n\nYear Captured: 2002\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 50 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nA Yemeni, Bihani was detained because he was believed to have been present in a suspected Al Qaeda guest house, although he was not suspected of having much useful information on Al Qaeda. His detention by the CIA was not known until the Senate report. Bihani was subjected to \"enhanced interrogation techniques,\" including a period of 72 hours of sleep deprivation before his interrogation.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nAll other information about Bihaniâs detention in the Senate report is classified. In a letter to his lawyer, Bihani said he was kept in tight restraints and left hanging for days. He was beaten on the way to interrogations, he said. âSometimes they would put a weapon on my head threatening to kill me using some provocative statements,â he said. He is currently detained in Guantanamo Bay.\n\nYear Captured: 2003\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 50 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nWhen Khan, an Afghan national also known as Majid Bin Muhammad Bin Sulayman Khayil, was first picked up, the CIA wasnât sure he posed a threat. He was subjected to \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" anyway, including two periods of standing sleep deprivation, one for 56 hours and another for 21 more hours. He developed âdisturbingâ hallucinations, the report said.\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nAfter about a month, the CIA determined that he \"does not appear to be the subject involved in ... current plans or activities against U.S. personnel or facilities.\" The CIA then transferred him to U.S. military custody where he would be held for four more years, despite âsignificant intelligence,â according to the Senate report, that Khan had been implicated by someone with a vendetta against his family.\n\nYear Captured: 2002\n\nDays Held by CIA: Approx. 10 Days\n\nWhat Was Done\n\nRahman was subjected to the a number of \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" -- nudity, light deprivation, sleep deprivation, dietary manipulations, facial slaps, cold cells and showers. But he was also subjected to what a CIA interrogator referred to as a âhard takedown,â and in a cable, ârough treatment.â In November 2002, Rahman was left shackled lying on a concrete floor in only a sweatshirt. He was found dead the next day. The likely cause of death was hypothermia, but the Senate report said that other contributing factors included dehydration, lack of food and immobility due to \"short chaining.\"\n\nWhat Came Next\n\nRahman died after fewer than 20 days in custody. The officer who ordered Rahman to be shackled to the floor later received a $2,500 \"cash award\" from the agency for his \"consistently superior work.\" The officer would later be formally certified as a CIA interrogator, the Senate report said, but was allowed to skip the practical section of the training because of his past experience."
