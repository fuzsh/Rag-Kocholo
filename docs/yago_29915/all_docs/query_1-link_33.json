        "text": "01 of 13\n\nJohn Krasinski's Wife, Emily Blunt\n\nJohn Krasinski's character Jim Halpert is not the only one who lived happily ever after. In real life, Krasinski is madly in love with fellow actor Emily Blunt.\n\nThe pair first met in 2008 and dated for two years before getting married in 2010. They welcomed their first daughter, Hazel, in 2014 and followed up with another baby girl named Violet in 2016.\n\nAs if their union wasn't powerful enough, their chemistry proved to be just as strong on-screen when they starred in A Quiet Place together in 2018. The film — also directed by Krasinski — was such a hit, they followed up with a sequel in 2020.\n\n02 of 13\n\nSteve Carell's Wife, Nancy Carell\n\nOne of Hollywood's longstanding couples, Steve Carell and his wife Nancy Carell have been married since 1995. Though the two both hail from Massachusetts, they didn't meet until Nancy took one of her future husband's improv classes in Chicago — and the rest is history.\n\nAn accomplished actress and comedian in her own right, Nancy not only played Michael Scott's love interest, Carol, on The Office, but she also has credits in Anger Management, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Bridesmaids and Angie Tribeca, among other works.\n\nThe Carells share two children: daughter Elisabeth Anne, 23, and son John, 20.\n\n03 of 13\n\nJenna Fischer's Husband, Lee Kirk\n\nJim Halpert and Pam Beesly will always have a place in our hearts but like Krasinski, Jenna Fischer — who played the soft-spoken secretary Pam — is also happily taken.\n\nThough Fischer and Lee Kirk had known each other in passing, they got to know each other more after she pitched him a project that later wasn't picked up. They then began working on The Giant Mechanical Man and Fischer felt her feelings for Kirk change.\n\n\"Our meetings started turning into dates,\" she told Vulture. \"It was very romantic and sweet. It was a lot of dinners with wine and going to see movies, while pretending like we were developing a movie when in fact we were essentially developing a relationship.\"\n\nThe rom-com wasn't the only project the two worked on together: Kirk made a guest appearance in season 6 of the hit show, playing Clark, Pam's lactation consultant in the episode \"The Delivery.\"\n\nThe pair got married in 2010 and have since welcomed two children: Weston Lee in 2011 and Harper Marie in 2014.\n\n04 of 13\n\nAngela Kinsey's Husband, Joshua Snyder\n\nAngela Kinsey, a.k.a. Angela Martin, is married to actor and Joshua Snyder.\n\nThough the two keep the details of their relationship relatively private, they aren't shy about vocalizing their love for one another on social media, often sharing family pics of their happily blended family.\n\nFollowing their wedding in 2016, Kinsey told Martha Stewart Weddings, \"Our wedding was more than just two people coming together, it was a family coming together. Josh and his sons and my daughter and I.\"\n\n\"We were so proud of our children. They each wrote something to say during the ceremony,\" she continued. \"They wanted us to know how much it means to them that we were becoming a family. It was truly moving.”\n\n05 of 13\n\nMelora Hardin's Husband, Gildart Jackson\n\nOn The Office, Melora Hardin played Michael Scott's tightly wound, inconsiderate, crude and toxic boss-turned-lover, Jan Levinson.\n\nIn real life, however, Hardin is a proud mama to two daughters — Rory Jackson and Piper Quincy — whom she shares with her husband of 27 years, fellow actor Gildart Jackson.\n\n06 of 13\n\nRainn Wilson's Wife, Holiday Reinhorn\n\nDwight Schrute may have been a bonafide cynic, but Rainn Wilson certainly was smitten on sight when he first laid eyes on his wife, Holiday Reinhorn.\n\n\"I don’t believe in love at first sight — it simply doesn’t make sense — but that’s what happened to me,” he wrote in his memoir, The Bassoon King.\n\n“I’ve been deeply in love with her ever since. For the record: Holiday is just awesome. Dark sense of humor and dangerously smart.”\n\nThe two dated for four years and got married in 1995. They welcomed their son Walter McKenzie Wilson in October 2004.\n\n07 of 13\n\nKate Flannery's Boyfriend, Chris Haston\n\nThe set of The Office turned out to be an extra special place for Kate Flannery, who met her boyfriend, NBC photographer Chris Haston, while playing Meredith Palmer.\n\n“He is the greatest,” she shared in 2019. “I’m so lucky, I have amazing support.”\n\n“Chris and I, we’ve been together for 13 years,” she added. “I’m a late bloomer in love, in career, in everything. I say later is better because you’re more calm, wiser, you get to enjoy it all with more gratitude.”\n\n08 of 13\n\nAmy Ryan's Husband, Eric Slovin\n\nAmy Ryan played the love of Michael Scott's life, Holly Flax, on the hit show.\n\nLike her character, the actress is relatively guarded about her love life. Though she has been married to writer/producer Eric Slovin since 2011, not much is known about their relationship.\n\nThe pair welcomed a daughter named Georgia Gracie in 2009.\n\n09 of 13\n\nBrian Baumgartner's Wife, Celeste Ackelson\n\nBrian Baumgartner, who played the not-so-bright office accountant Kevin Malone, married his wife Celeste Ackelson back in 2014.\n\nNaturally, his some of his former castmates were in attendance. Jenna Fischer, John Krasinski, Oscar Nuñez and Angela Kinsey were all present for the intimate backyard nuptials, TMZ reported at the time.\n\n10 of 13\n\nPaul Lieberstein's Wife, Janine Poreba\n\nPaul Lieberstein's Toby Flenderson was the bane of Michael Scott's existence. However, he had more than one role on the show. Outside of acting throughout its nine-season run, Lieberstein was also a writer, producer and showrunner on the comedy.\n\nHe leads a quiet private life with his wife Janine Poreba, whom he married in 2008.\n\n11 of 13\n\nEllie Kemper's Husband, Michael Koman\n\nEllie Kemper didn't join the cast of The Office until much later into the show's run, however, her turn as ditzy office secretary Erin Hannon was memorable.\n\nAnd though she had a rollercoaster love life on the show, in real life, she has been happily married to writer Michael Koman since 2012.The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt star met her husband on the set of Late Night with Conan O'Brien, but they didn't start dating until much later.\n\nThe pair have two kids together — sons James and Matthew — who were born in July 2016 and September 2019, respectively.\n\n12 of 13\n\nIdris Elba's Wife, Sabrina Dhowre Elba\n\nAware of the \"effect I have on women,\" Idris Elba's character Charles Miner didn't stray too far from the actor's real-life effect on the ladies.\n\nIn April 2019, hearts across the globe broke as the former Sexiest Man Alive officially tied the knot with Somali-Canadian model Sabrina Dhowre. The lovebirds had been together for about two years.\n\n\"It was love at first sight,\" the actor shared on The View. \"I went out on my only day off, true story, it was a Sunday night, I went to this party and there she was. The rest is history.\"\n\n13 of 13\n\nOscar Nuñez's Wife, Ursula Whittaker\n\nThough Oscar Nuñez and his wife Ursula Whittaker are often pictured on red carpets and have done some interviews together, these lovebirds also keep the details of their union under the radar.\n\nWhile fans remember Nuñez as the know-it-all, supremely sarcastic accountant in The Office, Whittaker is also an established actress; she has credits in Veep, Grey's Anatomy, ER and Veronica Mars."
