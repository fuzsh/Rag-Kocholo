Just watch small children before they are 'socialized'. In the clip below, 2024 Oscar winner Da'Vine Joy Randolph delivers an impassioned speech on the importance of having a strong sense of self-belief and a drive to express individuality. Clearly, our individuality must be preserved in the face of the accelerated development of AI. In March, we celebrate Albert Einstein's birthday. He made a major contribution to humanity while being hugely underestimated as an individual - at first. March 14 (3.14) is noted as Pi Day - Pi being a mathematical term used in measuring circles and similar forms. The result being a constant number. Humanity may be considered to be a dynamic - not a constant - within the circle of life. This dynamism is a gift. It allows us to be aware, choose and act. For the good of all. It all starts with you. The individual. 𝙃𝙤𝙬 𝙙𝙤 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙬𝙖𝙣𝙩 𝙩𝙤 𝙗𝙚 𝙨𝙚𝙚𝙣? 𝘼𝙣𝙙 𝙬𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙖𝙧𝙚 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙜𝙤𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙤 𝙙𝙤 𝙖𝙗𝙤𝙪𝙩 𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙩? #wef #financialtimes #thenewyorker #atlantic #irishfilm\n\nPeople can be so amazing. I love this story. It's nearly impossible to keep up with all that's happening in our world and so often it's gloom and doom. It used to be you could watch the nightly news for 30 minutes and get it all in one quick go. Now, the news cycle is 24/7 and people are doom scrolling to be sure they're not missing anything. But that's a slow drain on your energy and it just feeds stress. It can also feed the feelings of division. It can be hard to quit doom scrolling and some even have greater anxiety when they stop. Instead, might I suggest setting a timer for 30 minutes? When it goes off, pause what you're watching and look for some good news. Not only will that give you a break, but it sets an algorithm so when you go back to watching/listening, your options will include wonderful stories, good news, and maybe even a puppy or two. Take care of yourself and your mental health by balancing and expanding what you are taking in. What we consume - mentally as well as physically - impacts our lives and our health. #mentalhealth #holidaystress #politics #coaching #Christmas #health #news #goodnews\n\nApplause and Timing There is an oft unspoken skill that performers seem to know, but have no memory of being taught. That is because this is something that we do not experience in rehearsal, only in performance: riding the wave of laughter and applause. We may not know what a certain audience will find funny and we are often surprised if there is applause during a performance. We expect applause at the end, but how to know the right moment to leave the stage? When do we come back for a second or third bow? We learn this skill only by performing before a live audience. Mid-performance, the skill is to ride the wave of applause or laughter and then, just as the wave begins to wane, jump in and continue decisively and with vocal strength. There is a sweet spot to hit that is somewhat intuitive. If we ignore the audience and keep talking or jump in too soon…Read on: https://lnkd.in/dB2km6am #TheresaDavis #UVA #UVADrama #Theater #TEDx #TEDxCharlottesville #TEDTalks #PublicSpeaking #Presence"
