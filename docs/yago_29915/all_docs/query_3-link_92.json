        "text": "Steve Carell is an American actor and comedian, best known for basically just being the best. Awesome Steve Carell stories can be found all over the web from fans, colleagues, and critics alike. Carell got his start at Second City in Chicago, and eventually landed a gig as a correspondent on The Daily Show for five years before he was cast as the loveable but simple Brick Tamland in Anchorman. Shortly after that, everything changed for Carell.\n\nIt was in 2005 that both The Office and The 40 Year-Old Virgin debuted, and skyrocketed Carell to stardom. Since then, Carell has gone on to star in Evan Almighty and Little Miss Sunshine as well as the Despicable Me series. He's won multiple Golden Globes and was nominated as \"America's funniest man\" by Life magazine. But most importantly, he's a great guy.\n\nHe's very real and down to Earth. He's a dad and a husband. He wears cargo shorts and loves his parents. He does charity work and knows what it's like to work crappy jobs. Oh, and he's basically the funniest person on the planet. Check out all the times Steve Carell was the best!"
