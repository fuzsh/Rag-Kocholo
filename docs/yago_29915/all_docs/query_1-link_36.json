        "text": "What is Nancy Walls' net worth?\n\nNancy Walls Carell is an American actress, comedian, and writer who has a net worth of $80 million. Though, it should be noted that the majority of Nancy Wall's net worth is attributable to her husband since 1995, Steve Carell. The two met at The Second City improv group in Chicago. As an actress, comedian, and writer, Nancy is known for her work on \"Saturday Night Live,\" \"The Daily Show,\" and \"The Office.\"\n\nEarly Life\n\nNancy Ellen Walls was born on July 19, 1966 in Cohasset, Massachusetts. She grew up in the area with her sister Tish, and attended high school in Cohasset, before enrolling at Boston College. After obtaining her degree, she moved to Chicago, Illinois and began taking classes with The Second City in Chicago, an improvisational comedy troupe. There, she met her future husband and collaborator, Steve Carell.\n\nCareer\n\nWhile taking classes and doing comedy with The Second City, Walls also worked as a bartender at a bar across the street for extra money. Like many other alumni from The Second City, Walls joined the cast of \"Saturday Night Live\" after honing her comedy chops in Chicago. She was on \"SNL\" for one season from 1995 to 1996. From her time on the show, she is best known for her impression of CNN anchor Bobbie Battista. She appeared in 20 total episodes of the show.\n\nWalls's next major gig came in 1999 when she was hired to be a correspondent on the satirical news program \"The Daily Show\" hosted by Jon Stewart. She joined the show during Stewart's first season as host, as it had previously been hosted by Craig Kilborn. She appeared in 90 total episodes of \"The Daily Show\" from 1999 to 2002. In 2003, she landed a small role in the film \"Anger Management\" as a flight attendant. In 2005, she had a role in \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" as a health clinic counselor. The film starred her husband, Steve Carell.\n\nWalls had a recurring role on the popular comedy series \"The Office\" starring her husband, Steve Carell. She appeared as character Carol Stills in seven total episodes from 2005 to 2013. Stills is a real estate agent and the former girlfriend of her husband's character, Michael Scott.\n\nIn 2009, she voiced the character of Helen Goode on the animated series \"The Goode Family.\" She remained on the show for 13 total episodes. It is also the first production on which she is credited as Nancy Carell rather than Nancy Walls. In 2011, she landed a small role in the film \"Bridesmaids\" starring Kristen Wiig. She appears as the tennis partner of one of the main characters of the film. In 2012, she appeared in the film \"Seeking a Friend for the End of the World\" as character Linda Peterson.\n\nAlong with her husband, Walls began developing a comedy series for TBS called \"Angie Tribeca.\" They had pitched the show to TBS in 2014 and TBS initially ordered 10 episodes of the show. The show is a parody of the police procedural genre and starred Rashida Jones as the main character. Originally, \"Angie Tribeca\" was intended to premiere in late 2015. However, it was announced that the first season would actually be released through video on demand in 2016. The first season of the show premiered in January 2016, followed by the second season in June of that year. The third season premiered in April 2017 followed by the fourth and final season in December 2018. The series was cancelled after four seasons in May 2019. In general, the show received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike. Walls and Carell created the show and wrote all four seasons. She also appeared in two episodes of the show in 2017.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nWalls met Steve Carell while she was taking classes at the famed The Second City comedy troupe in Chicago, Illinois. He was teaching a class she was taking and the two hit it off. While they have both since admitted to being shy and timid about expressing interest in each other, they eventually began dating and then got married on August 5, 1995. Their wedding took place at a church in Massachusetts. They have since had two children together. Their daughter, Elisabeth, was born in 2001 while their son, John, was born in 2004.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn 2010, Nancy and Steve paid $6 million for a home in LA's Toluca Lake neighborhood. They bought the home from the estate of the late actor Jonathan Winters. They proceeded to tear down the existing home and built a 6,600 square-foot mansion. The traditional style house home has 6 bedrooms, and 5 bathrooms. The entry to the home has a double gated circular drive that leads to the front door. The home features a traditional design with large kitchen, open living room and formal dining room, and the master suite is located upstairs. The home is surrounded by dense, mature shade trees. The backyard features a free form swimming pool with pool house and tennis courts.\n\nIn 2012 they sold a former Toluca Lake home for $5.1 million.\n\nBack in their native Massachusetts, Nancy and Steve own a four-bedroom home in the town of Marshfield. They also own and sometimes personally operate the Marshfield Hills General Store. The store is primarily managed by Nancy's sister."
