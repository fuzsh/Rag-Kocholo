        "text": "What would you say are the best episodes of The Office? Everyone has their own opinion and list, but are there some we can all agree on?\n\nThe Office is without a doubt one of the greatest sitcoms of all-time. It was such a strong cast of characters. Of course, nobody could do it quite like Steve Carell’s Michael Scott. There are so many iconic episodes and scenes to consider, but are these the five best episodes of The Office?\n\nWhat Are The Best Episodes Of ‘The Office?’\n\nWhile everybody has their favorite episodes of the show, that doesn’t mean they’re necessarily the “best.” There’s an important difference there. For example, my favorite episode of South Park is “AWESOM-O” but I wouldn’t say it’s the best or greatest episode of the show (that would probably belong to “Scott Tenorman Must Die“). So, we must understand the difference between our personal favorites and what’s the best. Personal biases must be put aside.\n\nThat was a challenge for me. Some of my favorite episodes and what I think are the best episodes of The Office aren’t going to make the list. I have to put my bias aside and consider what the majority would deem to be the best of the best. Unfortunately, that meant my favorite episode “Gossip” (Season 6 Episode 1) won’t be making the list. It kills me every time Michael calls Stanley’s wife. Every single time. Likewise, “Gay Witch Hunt” (Season 3 Episode 1) didn’t make the final five and will instead be an honorable mention. You really get a sense of Michael’s ignorance in that episode and it’s a great character builder that also has a ton of laughs at Michael’s expense.\n\nDespite a few of my favorite episodes not being included on the list, I stand by the final five. I think the majority of fans would agree that these episodes deserve to be in the Top 10 and then where they fall within there is up for debate. I did do something kind of controversial, though. I’m counting the double episodes as one episode. They’re the same thing, just broken up in two halves for the sake of time. To me, and this list, they are considered one singular episode. Don’t like that? Create your own list! See what made the final five best episodes of The Office below! Do you agree?\n\nAre These The 5 Best Episodes Of ‘The Office?’"
