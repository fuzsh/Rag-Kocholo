        "text": "Many of us know that Steve Carrell, famous for his roles in The Office, Crazy Stupid Love, and Evan Almighty, is from Massachusetts.\n\nHe still has ties to the Bay State, including his 171-year-old general/candy store in Marshfield.\n\nAlthough I am a big Steve Carrell fan, I am apparently not a big enough fan, because this was news to me.\n\nApparently, according to a Boston Uncovered article, Steve purchased the Marshfield Hills General Store in 2008 for a half-million dollars. Along with his ties to small towns in Massachusetts, his wife Nancy is actually from Marshfield, making the purchase a no-brainer.\n\nA few years ago, he was at the store discussing the purchase and how important small town meet-up places were. That was a driving factor. He wanted to keep the small town meetup space alive.\n\nAlthough Steve is the owner, he never plans on running the store. Instead, Steve's sister-in-law manages the store with nine employees, while Carrell continues to act.\n\nIn true Carrell fashion, he says that the free candy is the biggest perk to owning the store.\n\nOf course, on the shelves of this general store, you will find candy and other general items, but there is also a display of The Office merch for sale.\n\nThe Marshfield Hills General Store is located at 165 Prospect Street in Marshfield Hills, Massachusetts. If you are a Steve Carrell fan and are ever near Marshfield, you should check it out.\n\nYou never know when Steve Carrell will pop in. After all, he is the owner, so it could be anytime."
