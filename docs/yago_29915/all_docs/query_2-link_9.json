        "text": "NBC’s The Office (streaming now on Peacock) has had a huge cultural impact which still lingers, a decade after the last episode aired. It popularized the mockumentary style of sitcom which was later utilized in everything from What We Do in the Shadows to Parks and Recreation, and beyond.\n\nThe show is based on the short-lived BBC series of the same name, created by Stephen Merchant and Ricky Gervais, and ran for more than 200 episodes. Over the course of nine seasons it told the stories of the ordinary people at the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the paper company Dunder Mifflin. From 2005 to 2013, the world fell in love with Michael Scott, Jim Halpert, Pam Beesly, and the rest of the employees of Dunder Mifflin Scranton, transforming them into household names and global celebrities.\n\nRELATED: Every Hilarious The Office Halloween Episode You Have to Rewatch\n\nThey became so beloved and their lives so familiar that even now, people yell at John Krasinksi’s (Jim Halpert) real world wife for not being Pam. To clear up any confusion the next time you run into one of our favorite Office-mates in the real world, they are real people and these are their actual partners.\n\nThe Office Stars and Their Real-life Partners\n\nWho is Steve Carell's Wife? Nancy Walls Carell\n\nMichael Scott had a number of romantic interests throughout the life of the show and one of them was his real-life wife. Carell is married to Nancy Walls Carell, a prolific comedian herself. She was a member of Chicago’s The Second City and an SNL cast member for one season from 1995 to 1996.\n\nOn The Office, Walls Carell played a temporary romantic partner and recurring character as the real estate agent Carol Stills. Walls Carell also covered the 2000 presidential election as a correspondent on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and co-created the show Angie Tribeca, starring another Office alum, Rashida Jones.\n\nWho is Jenna Fischer's Husband? Lee Kirk\n\nOne half of television’s favorite couple, Jenna Fischer has made a career out of making the world believe she was in love with John Krasinski’s Jim Halpert. In the real world, Fischer was married to director James Gunn from 2000 to 2008.\n\nDespite their divorce, Gunn and Fischer have maintained a friendly relationship, with Fischer even being responsible for casting Rainn Wilson in Gunn’s bloody hero flick Super. Fischer remarried to screenwriter Lee Kirk in 2010. Kirk guested as Clark in the Season 6 episode “The Delivery: Part 2” and directed the Season 9 episode “Vandalism.”\n\nWho is John Krasinski's Wife? Emily Blunt\n\nContrary to the desires of overzealous fans everywhere, Krasinski is married to actor Emily Blunt. They started seeing one another back in 2008 and married two years later. After The Office wrapped, Blunt and Krasinksi co-starred in the inventive blockbuster horror A Quiet Place, but that barely scratches the surface of Blunt’s credits.\n\nShe’s been a working actor for 20 years and has roles in notable films like The Devil Wears Prada, Looper, and Edge of Tomorrow. Recently, Blunt portrayed Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer in Christopher Nolan’s eponymous Oppenheimer.\n\nWho is Rainn Wilson's Wife? Holiday Reinhorn\n\nWilson has been married to writer Holiday Reinhorn since 1995. The duo met while taking the same acting class at the University of Washington in the 1980s. They lost touch afterward but Wilson found her contact information in the White Pages (remember those?) and reached out. The rest is history.\n\nReinhorn’s short story collection Big Cats was published in 2005 by Free Press, an imprint of Simon & Schuster. The couple have a son named Walter.\n\nRELATED: The Funniest Quotes from The Office That We Still Use Daily\n\nLeslie David Baker (Stanley Hudson)\n\nLeslie David Baker is known to be married but details aren’t publicly available.\n\nWho is Brian Baumgartner's Wife? Celeste Ackelson\n\nMalone was everyone’s favorite lovable buffoon (and least favorite accountant) for the duration of The Office. He got married to Celeste Ackelson in 2014, a year after the show wrapped up. Details about Celeste’s personal life and work aren’t publicly known, but many of Baumgartner’s coworkers from The Office came out for the big day.\n\nWho is Angela Kinsey's Husband? Joshua Snyder\n\nKinsey was previously married to writer and producer Warren Keith Lieberstein, brother of Paul Lieberstein, who played Toby on the show. The pair married in 2000 and divorced 10 years later.\n\nKinsey married Joshua Snyder in 2016. Snyder is also an actor, best known for roles on General Hospital: Night Shift, One Tree Hill, Days of Our Lives, and CSI: NY. Together, Kinsey and Snyder run a website and YouTube channel called Baking with Josh & Ange, where you can find guest appearances from other Office alums.\n\nWho is Kate Flannery's Partner? Chris Haston\n\nFlannery is in a long-term relationship with NBC photographer Chris Haston. The duo both worked on the set of The Office in different capacities and hit it off. Flannery invited Haston to one of her comedy shows (just like she did to everyone on set). He showed up and asked her out afterward. The two have been together ever since.\n\nYou can catch a glimpse of Haston as Meredith’s dance partner at Dwight and Angela’s wedding in the series finale.\n\nPhyllis Smith (Phyllis Vance)\n\nPhyllis Smith was working as a casting associate, finding actors for The Office when she was accidentally cast herself. Smith’s soft-spoken demeanor made her a comforting influence on a show that could be chaotic, and won her a role as Sadness in the Disney-Pixar film Inside Out. No relationship information is publicly known.\n\nCreed Bratton (Creed Bratton)\n\nThe man, the myth, the legend…\n\nAs far as we can tell, Creed isn’t married. And he wouldn’t tell us if he was.\n\nWho is Oscar Nunez's Wife? Ursula Whittaker\n\nOn The Office, Oscar had a secret relationship with State Senator Rob Lipton (to Angela’s great shame) but in the real world he’s married to Ursula Whittaker. A native of Los Angeles, Whittaker attended the University of Southern California where she received a degree in American Literature with a minor in film and television.\n\nAn actor herself, Whittaker has had roles in Malcolm in the Middle, Veronica Mars, ER, Grey’s Anatomy, Veep, and more.\n\nMindy Kaling and B.J. Novak?\n\nKaling has a close and somewhat unconventional relationship with Office co-star B.J. Novak, who played her on-screen love interest Ryan Howard. The duo’s real-life relationship sometimes mirrored the on-again, off-again rollercoaster nature of their on-screen relationship.\n\nKaling has described it as “romantically charged camaraderie with loud arguments.” The status of their relationship seems almost as unknown to them as it is to us. Neither are married.\n\nB.J. Novak and Mindy Kaling?\n\nSee above.\n\nEd Helms (Andy Bernard)\n\nHelms has become a mainstay of modern comedy with roles in The Hangover, The Lorax, and We’re the Millers, to name a few. In a 2018 episode of the Anna Farris podcast Unqualified, Helms said, “I’ve been married a couple of years and she’s fabulous, and she enjoys a lot more anonymity than I do.”\n\nAdditional details are lacking and that’s by design.\n\nWho is Paul Lieberstein's Wife? Janine Poreba\n\nYou’ll recognize Lieberstein as Michael Scott’s archnemesis, Toby. You may not have known that Lieberstein was also a writer and producer for The Office and served as showrunner for several seasons.\n\nLieberstein is married to Janine Poreba who had a guest role as Amy in the Season 4 episode “Dunder Mifflin Infinity.” She is an educator specializing in English as a second language, and the two were married in 2008 at the New York restaurant Battery Gardens.\n\nCraig Robinson (Darryl Philbin)\n\nRobinson has brought his signature style of comedy to a wide range of movies and TV shows including Hot Tub Time Machine and everything Judd Apatow makes from now until the Sun explodes. He also toyed with Andy Samberg’s Jake Peralta in nine episodes of Brooklyn Nine-Nine. (NINE-NINE!!)\n\nRELATED: How Did Brooklyn Nine-Nine End? Twisty, Heist-Filled Series Finale Explained\n\nNo current relationship information is known, but as of 2016 Robinson was unmarried, saying, “In L.A., I was dating this girl, and she moved in for a while. That ended bad. And now I’m just kind of fine,” according to the New York Times. The only domestic partners he says he needs are his two turtles.\n\nWho is Ellie Kemper's Husband? Michael Koman\n\nKemper’s Erin Hannon arrived at The Office as the new receptionist when Pam quit to work for the short-lived Michael Scott Paper Company. Throughout the series, she had relationships with Andy, Gabe (Zach Woods), and Pete (Jake Lacy), but in real life she’s married to Michael Koman.\n\nOn an episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Kemper revealed the engagement before announcing her dream of Dolly Parton performing at the wedding. “Dolly, if you’re watching, I will pay for at least your way there on airfare, one way. You can take home any leftover cake. There will probably be a free brunch the next day and you don’t have to play “9 to 5” if you’re sick of it.\"\n\nKoman is a writer, having worked on The Colbert Report, Saturday Night Live, and co-created the show Nathan for You. The duo were married in July 2012 and Kemper did get to meet Dolly a few years later when she guest-hosted on The Today Show."
