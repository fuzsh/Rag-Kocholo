        "text": "Helmed by the prolific American director Leo McCarey (Duck Soup; The Bells of St. Mary’s; An Affair to Remember), The Awful Truth—a breezy, talky comedy that set a high standard for screwball in the 1930s—centers on Jerry and Lucy Warriner (Cary Grant and Irene Dunne), an upper-crust couple who begin divorce proceedings when each suspects the other of being unfaithful. Over the 90 days that it takes for their split to be finalized, both Warriners become involved with other people—but by the film’s end, the pair must face up to the “awful truth” about their feelings for one another.\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon or iTunes.\n\nScenes from a Marriage (1973)\n\nIn 1973, Scener ur ett äktenskap, a six-part miniseries from the director-screenwriter Ingmar Bergman, premiered on Swedish television, with Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson as the couple at its center. Cut for theatrical release in both Sweden and the United States a year later, it traces in devastating detail the contours of a 20-year relationship (the action starting a decade in): contentment, indiscretions, divorce, remarriage, clandestine reconciliation, and all.\n\nFor Bergman, Kim Davies notes on Bright Wall/Dark Room, Scenes from a Marriage feels almost light: “Discussion of God is kept to a minimum, death hardly makes an appearance let alone receives a screen credit, and the deep questions of life are shunted in favor of the immediate questions of life—who is going to tell their parents about the breakup? Which of them will be paying for their daughter’s school trip? Will Johan stay the night or just for dinner?” Yet the discussions that it conjures wield a profound weight of their own, demonstrating what rich and urgent drama can be culled from the most ordinary circumstances.\n\nHow to Watch: Buy it on Amazon.\n\nKramer vs. Kramer (1979)\n\n“Kramer vs. Kramer wouldn’t be half as good as it is—half as intriguing and absorbing—if the movie had taken sides,” Roger Ebert observed in 1979. Helmed by director and screenwriter Robert Benton, who based his script on Avery Corman’s 1977 novel, the film centered instead on two characters, Ted (Dustin Hoffman) and Joanna (Meryl Streep), with a great deal to learn: Joanna about herself, which she does largely offscreen, and Ted about being a father. (Three food scenes—two with French toast, one with ice cream—help to chart his progress with their young son, Billy, played by Justin Henry.) An instant classic, Kramer vs. Kramer swept the 1980 Academy Awards, nabbing best picture, best director, best actor (for Hoffman, his first), best supporting actress (for Streep, her first), and best adapted screenplay.\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon, iTunes, or YouTube.\n\nShoot the Moon (1982)\n\nHow to Watch: While not officially available to stream, the full film isn’t difficult to find online.\n\nHeartburn (1986)\n\nAdapted from Nora Ephron’s eponymous 1983 novel, Heartburn recounts with certain slight modifications the events that precipitated her divorce from journalist Carl Bernstein in 1980. The film, Ephron’s second collaboration with director Mike Nichols, stars an acerbic Meryl Streep as Rachel Samstat, a food writer, and Jack Nicholson as Mark Foreman, a political columnist revealed to be having an affair. “One day, I was sitting at the typewriter writing something else, and started writing a novel about the end of my marriage,” Ephron recalls in the 2013 documentary Makers: Women Who Make America. (She died in 2012.) “I’m really not interested in women as victims; so one of the things I like about Heartburn is that it is basically: Look what happened to me, and guess what? I get to have the last laugh because I get to be funny about it.”\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon with Epix, iTunes, or YouTube.\n\nWaiting to Exhale (1995)\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon, iTunes, or YouTube.\n\nThe Squid and the Whale (2005)\n\n“Two contrasting things kept me from writing this story,” Noah Baumbach said of his wonderfully wry The Squid and the Whale in 2009; “on the one hand, everyone deals with divorce—it’s too universal. On the other, it’s too specific to my family, and won’t resonate beyond that. Unconsciously, at some point I just let go and thought, Let’s see what happens.” Starring Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney as the sparring, intellectual parents to two adolescent sons (Jesse Eisenberg and Owen Kline), The Squid and the Whale responds to some of Baumbach’s own experiences as a product of divorce in the 1980s. But yet, much like Kramer vs. Kramer, the film refuses to choose between Mr. and Mrs. Berkman, looking instead to how their boys, Walt and Frank, negotiate confused allegiances of their own.\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon, iTunes, or YouTube.\n\nA Separation (2011)"
