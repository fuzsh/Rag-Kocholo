        "text": "Source: Brides\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nThe couple that laughs together stays together right? This is certainly true for Golden Globe-nominated actor Steve Carell and his wife Nancy, who are still going strong after more than 21 years of marriage. The couple, and creative partners, are gearing up for the premiere of their new show Angie Tribeca and took a moment to dish on the secret to their long running marriage.\n\n“She makes me laugh more than anybody,” the 53-year-old former Office star gushed about his actress/comedian/writer wife in an interview with Entertainment Tonight. With Nancy’s impressive resume including iconic shows like The Daily Show, Saturday Night Live, and The Office, we can’t say we’re all that surprised. Combine Nancy’s impressive resume with Steve’s small-screen success and we can’t believe we’ve had to wait so long for the two to co-create a TV show.\n\n“We didn’t start thinking we’re going to write a show. We just came up with this name that was really dumb and it just kept making us laugh… and the more we talked about it, the more it made us laugh!” the actor admitted.\n\nSee More: The Best TV Wedding Dresses\n\nWhen asked about the upcoming Golden Globes, for which Steve is nominated for his role in The Big Short, the actor was quick to admit the real motivation for wanting to the award, joking that if he won, he “might finally gain my wife’s love and approval.” Nancy was quick to joke back, telling her hubby, “Well you already won one, so that was good for 10 years, but it’s worn off.” [Steve took home a Golden Globe for Best Actor in 2006 for his role on The Office.]\n\nThe funny duo met at Second City in Chicgo when Steve was Nancy’s teacher. “I beat around the bush and said something stupid like, ‘Well, you know, if I were to ever ask someone out, it would be someone like you,'” the Foxcatcher actor told Details. “It’s so stupid, but it was all self-protection. She was the same way: ‘If somebody like you were to ask me out, I would definitely go out with him. If there was a person like you.'”\n\nThe pair was reunited when they were both correspondents on The Daily Show, which is where the finally ended up getting together, tying the knot in 1995."
