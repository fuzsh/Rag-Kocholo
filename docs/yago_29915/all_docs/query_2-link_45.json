Besides her professional portfolio, she is the super wife of actor cum comedian, Steve Carell. The duo have enjoyed an enviable relationship for over 2 decades. Read all about their cute love story.\n\nNancy Carell Bio\n\nNancy Ellen Carell (Wells) was born in Cohasset, Massachusetts on July 19, 1966, into a family of 8, with her parents, Robert and Carol Wells. She attended Cohasset High School and then Boston College, where she was a member of the improv troupe My Mother’s Fleabag. Nancy graduated from college in 1988.\n\nCareer\n\nNancy began her comedy career as a member of The Second City comedy troupe. She featured on the television show, Saturday Night Live in the mid-nineties, from 1995 to 1996. During this period, she impersonated people such as Cokie Roberts, Diane Sawyer, Kathy Ireland, Martha Stewart, Sharon Stone. However, she is best known for her impersonation of CNN anchor Bobbie Battista.\n\nAfter her time on Saturday Night Live, Nancy became a correspondent for the satirical late-night news television program The Daily Show. She held this position from 1999 to 2002 and appeared in 90 episodes.\n\nNancy Carell also acts in both film and television.

The series which debuted on January 17, 2016 also starred Rashida Jones.\n\nPlus, Nancy Carell would love to write full-time when her children reach adulthood.\n\nHer husband, Steve Carell\n\nOnce named as America’s Funniest Man in Life’s Magazine, Steve has been nominated for the Golden Globes nine times. American actor, comedian, producer, writer and director. Born August 16, 1962 in Concord, Massachusetts, USA.\n\nVersatile in his roles, he is known as Michael Scotts The Office, wrestling coach and convicted murderer John Eleuthère du Pont in the 2014 drama film Foxcatcher.

Steve Carell was inducted onto the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2016 for his contributions to the motion picture industry.\n\nTheir beautiful love story\n\nA marital union spanning more than two decades in an industry renowned for its rocky relationships is worthy of acclaim. It’s just a far cry from the pattern that’s been seen in Hollywood with celebrity marriages and relationships where separation and divorce are more like a default setting in such unions.\n\nThis is not to say that marriage is problem free or has had its storm free sail, but it is more like a survivor amidst all the inconveniences and many challenges that such a union battles. Nancy Carell and Steve Carell have been married since 1995 and have remained one of show business’s strongest couples. Let’s take a look at their cute love story.\n\nHow did they meet?\n\nThe beautiful love story presented in the troupe, The second city where Nancy was a student in a class taught by Steve. However, contrary to what you might think, the two comedic forces didn’t get along at first, despite being attracted to each other. Steve revealed that asking her out was kind of a herculean task as he kept beating around the bush for a long time.\n\nHe first thought that the lady he was interested in (Nancy) hated him because she acted calm around him even though he knew at first sight that she was his. But the truth was that she was just as nervous as he was and was just trying to act cool.\n\nStill, the thought of possibly being rejected brought to mind his memory of the first girl he called out on a date in eighth grade. He received a NO for an answer, and from that time until Nancy’s acceptance, was cautious in his journey.\n\nHe didn’t start off on a fancy note but said something like if he had to ask someone out, it would be someone like her. Stupid right? But guess what? Nancy was right to give him a more awkward answer. She replied that if someone like Steve asked her out, she would definitely go out with him. If ever such a person existed and was certain, Steve was there of course. They were already in love with each other but didn’t know how to present their case.\n\nIn any case, this was only the beginning of their happily ever after. They then won a date and had their first date at the Green Mill jazz club. The tandem bonded on August 5, 1995. The journey was characterized by endless happiness.\n\nFamily life, children\n\nThe couple share the same sense of humor, although Steve doesn’t think his wife is an easy laugh. He counted that as one of the many reasons he loves her. He considers Nancy the best indicator of the quality of jokes and says she challenges him intellectually and comically. Comically because she’s not someone who’s going to laugh at everything everyone does.\n\nHe then added that Nancy Carell, his wife is the smartest and funniest person he has ever met. And that he had never assumed that such a smart and attractive woman would be remotely interested in him.\n\nShe played her husband’s love several times. For example, in The Office where she portrayed a friend of hers and appeared with him on a number of shows, including The Daily Show\n\nNancy Carell said of her husband that he was very funny and didn’t try so hard. They have two children, daughter Elisabeth (born May 25, 2001) and son John “Johnny” (born June 2004).\n\nPredictably, their children seem to have inherited their parents’ sense of humor, described by their parents as very pure and honest in an interview.\n\nThe super-cute couple own a home in Los Angeles, as well as Marshfield, Massachusetts, where they have the option of escaping celebrity life during the summer. The duo also own The Marshfield Hills general store which they bought in 2009."
