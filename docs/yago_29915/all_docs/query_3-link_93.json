        "text": "After her major feature debut in 2005’s The Sisterhood of Travelling Pants, Blake Lively hopped over to television as the lead in Gossip Girl, the CW teen drama fixture that ran for six seasons. Though busy with the show, Lively was still able to turn in a few memorable appearances in films, like the Certified Fresh crime saga The Town and Green Lantern, where she would meet future husband Ryan Reynolds.\n\nThough Gossip Girl ended in 2012, it would be several years before her film career would resume in earnest, starting with the romantic fantasy The Age of Adaline. But it would be shark movie The Shallows that would propel her to movie stardom. 2018’s A Simple Favor, where she goes tête-à-tête with Anna Kendrick, was another critical and box office hit. And in 2020, Lively starred in The Rhythm Section, where she goes on a one-woman mission to take down those responsible for a plane crash that killed her family. In her most recent film, It Ends With Us, Lively plays the brave Lily Bloom, who moves to Boston to fulfill her lifelong dream of starting her own business. See where the rom-com places as we rank Blake Lively’s best movies (and her worst) by Tomatometer! —Alex Vo\n\n#1\n\nThe Town (2010) 92%\n\n#1\n\nAdjusted Score: 101736%\n\nCritics Consensus: Tense, smartly written, and wonderfully cast, The Town proves that Ben Affleck has rediscovered his muse -- and that he's a director to be reckoned with.\n\nSynopsis: Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) leads a band of ruthless bank robbers and has no real attachments except for James (Jeremy...

After... [More]\n\nDirected By: Woody Allen\n\n#6\n\n#6\n\nAdjusted Score: 71350%\n\nCritics Consensus: Reverential and offbeat, the road trip film Private lives of Pippa Lee takes emotional detours and is elevated by great performances, particularly that of Robin Wright-Penn.\n\nSynopsis: Pippa Lee (Robin Wright Penn) is a middle-aged woman married to a much older man named Herb (Alan Arkin), a... [More]\n\nDirected By: Rebecca Miller\n\n#7\n\nAdjusted Score: 69414%\n\nCritics Consensus: The workable chemistry among the four leads combined with the enriching message make for a winning Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2.\n\nSynopsis: Following freshman year at college, best friends Tibby (Amber Tamblyn), Lena (Alexis Bledel), Carmen (America Ferrera) and Bridget (Blake Lively)...

[More]\n\nDirected By: Justin Baldoni\n\n#9\n\nThe Age of Adaline (2015) 55%\n\n#9\n\nAdjusted Score: 62935%\n\nCritics Consensus: The Age of Adaline ruminates on mortality less compellingly than similarly themed films, but is set apart by memorable performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.\n\nSynopsis: Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively) has miraculously remained a youthful 29 years of age for nearly eight decades, never allowing herself...

[More]\n\nDirected By: John Krasinski\n\n#12\n\nAccepted (2006) 38%\n\n#12\n\nAdjusted Score: 42312%\n\nCritics Consensus: Like its characters who aren't able to meet their potential, Accepted's inconsistent and ridiculous plot gets annoying, despite a few laughs.\n\nSynopsis: After receiving his latest college rejection letter, senior Bartleby Gaines devises a novel way to fool everyone into thinking he... [More]\n\nDirected By: Steve Pink\n\n#13\n\n#13\n\nAdjusted Score: 40466%\n\nCritics Consensus: Like many anthologies, New York, I Love You has problems of consistency, but it isn't without its moments.\n\nSynopsis: On the eve of her wedding, a Hasidic woman (Natalie Portman) considers a romance with another man, in one of... [More]\n\n#14\n\n#14\n\nAdjusted Score: 31764%\n\nCritics Consensus: All I See Is You hints at a number of intriguing questions with its premise, but they dissolve in a stylish yet empty psychodrama that fails to connect.\n\nSynopsis: Gina is a beautiful young woman who's still haunted by the accident that took her sight years earlier. Living in...
