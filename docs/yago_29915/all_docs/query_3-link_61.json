As I shook her hand I went, 'I think I like you.'\"\n\nTwo years later, they were wed in Italy. They now have two kids together, Hazel and Violet.\n\nIn 2018, 10 years after they met, they combined their personal and professional relationships when they costarred in \"A Quiet Place,\" which Krasinski also directed.\n\n\"I've always been the biggest fan of her, but not into you're in the room when she does what she does do you know why she's so phenomenal,\" he told Jimmy Fallon ahead of its release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDax Shepard and Kristen Bell: 17 years\n\nShepard and Bell have been together since 2007. They got married in a low-key courthouse ceremony in 2013, and they share two kids.\n\nThey have no shortage of heartwarming quotes and advice about love, from never walking out on a fight to advocating for couples therapy, but Shepard's advice about keeping the spark alive is one of our favorites.\n\n\"Your lady wants to know that you're still very interested in her as a human being, that there are still questions that you haven't asked,\" Shepard said on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" in 2018. He continued, \"Go to dinner and ask questions and spend the time as if you just met this person at a bar. That's what's exciting I think.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJustin Timberlake and Jessica Biel: 17 years\n\nTimberlake and Biel haven't always been on the strongest ground — they broke up for three months in 2011, before giving it another shot. Luckily, the second chance took and they've been together ever since.\n\nEven though they went through a rough patch, Biel was never in doubt. She still keeps an email she sent to her producing partner early in their relationship that said, \"I will marry this man,\" according to an interview with James Corden in 2017.\n\nAfter their wedding in 2012, Biel gave birth to their son Silas in 2015. In 2020, the two welcomed their second child, Phineas, after a secret pregnancy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Legend and Chrissy Teigen: 18 years\n\nThis power couple met on the set of Legend's music video for \"Stereo\" in 2006, and they have been together ever since, give or take a 30-minute breakup in 2007.\n\nSince then, they've gotten married, starred in another music video together, had four adorable kids, and created an empire.\n\n\"There are some famous couples I look at and I'm like, 'Ugh, we get it. Stop trying so hard, you're so lame.' I think people definitely think that about us,\" Teigen joked to Vanity Fair in December 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMatthew McConaughey and Camila Alves: 18 years\n\nMcConaughey and Alves have been together since 2006, tying the knot in 2012. The low-key couple reside in Texas, and they have three kids together.\n\nIn 2016, the \"Interstellar\" star shared the story of his proposal with Esquire. \"I remember hitting the knee, looking into her eyes. I remember her face. I remember this smile coming up from her feet. I remember her having to catch her breath,\" he said. \"And she didn't say yes right away. And then the whole family was going, 'Jeezus, she's gonna say no.'\"\n\nBut she accepted.\n\nOf Alves herself, he added, \"A good woman gives a man courage and confidence — the courage to have the confidence to go and do it, to not be worried as much or consider as much what the rest of the world thinks.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSterling K. Brown and Ryan Michelle Bathé: 18 years\n\nBrown, who is celebrating his first Oscar nomination this year, met Bathé when they were students at Stanford University in the late '90s. They eloped in 2006 and then had a larger ceremony in 2007, according to People.\n\nThe two costarred on \"Army Wives\" in 2012, and Bathé later had a recurring role on Brown's smash hit \"This Is Us.\" She appeared in the past timeline as the mother of a friend of Randall, played by Brown.\n\n\"If nothing else, Sterling and I have always had laughter. Even in the bleakest of times, we have always been able to laugh. We laugh at ourselves, we laugh at each other, we laugh with each other about ourselves,\" Bathé told InStyle in 2019, adding that their two sons keep them laughing as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi: 19 years\n\nDeGeneres met de Rossi in 2004 and the two tied the knot in 2008.\n\nIn October 2016's issue of People magazine, where DeGeneres was featured on the cover, she opened up about being married to her \"best friend.\"\n\n\"Portia and I constantly say to each other, 'We are so lucky.' Sometimes it's lying in bed at night before I go to sleep, and I just say thank you to whatever, whoever is out there,\" she said.\n\nIn 2023, de Rossi planned a surprise vow renewal ceremony at her 50th birthday party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton: 20 years\n\nPrince William and Kate met as students at St. Andrews University in 2004. They parted ways in 2007 briefly, only to get back together later that year. They got engaged in 2010 and had a totally over-the-top royal wedding in 2011.\n\nAnd though they are royals, Kate and William made it clear that they have a fun-loving relationship like everyone else.\n\n\"Obviously we both have a very fun time together, both have a very good sense of humor about things, we're down to earth, we take the mickey out of each other a lot, and she's got plenty of habits that make me laugh that I tease her about,\" Prince William said while discussing their engagement.\n\nThey have three children: George, Charlotte, and Louis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeil Patrick Harris and David Burtka: 20 years\n\nThe power couple have two very different recollections of their meeting on 9th Avenue between 44th and 45th Streets in NYC. Harris remembers meeting a \"James Dean-type guy in a leather jacket\" who barely gave him the time of day, while Burtka remembers being friendly and vaguely familiar with Harris' work, they later told Out magazine.\n\nThey later went on a date to see the film \"Taking Lives\" in 2004 and the rest is history. The pair welcomed twins Harper and Gideon in 2010 and were married in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeth Rogen and Lauren Miller: 20 years\n\nRogen and Miller's first date was straight out of a rom-com — they made grilled cheeses at 4 a.m. and played Spanish Scrabble until sunrise, they told Haute Living Magazine in 2015.\n\nThe couple has collaborated on a cause near and dear to their hearts by founding Hilarity for Charity, an organization dedicated to raising awareness about Alzheimer's disease among millennials.\n\nRogen's secret for their successful marriage? \"We watch a lot of television,\" Rogen told ET.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMatt Damon and Luciana Barroso: 21 years\n\nDamon met his wife in Miami while she was tending bar. They were married in 2005 and have been together since. They have three daughters together, in addition to Barroso's daughter from a previous relationship.\n\nWith him shooting movie scenes all around the world, you could imagine how difficult things could get. Luckily, they've got it all figured out.\n\n\"We have a two week rule,\" he told Your Tango in 2015. \"I'm not away for more than two weeks. I think you need to be with the person you love as much as possible. My wife is my soul mate. I don't like being apart from her.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdam and Jackie Sandler: 21 years\n\nThe Sandlers met on the set of Adam's 1999 film \"Big Daddy,\" in which she had a small role as a waitress. They married in 2003.\n\nSince then, Jackie has appeared in many of her husband's films, including \"50 First Dates,\" \"I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry,\" \"Just Go with It,\" \"Murder Mystery,\" \"Hubie Halloween,\" and most recently \"You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah.\"\n\nIn that last film, the Sandlers made it a family affair, with their two daughters Sadie and Sunny starring as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey: 21 years\n\nThe \"Iron Man\" star has credited his wife, Susan, whom he calls Suzie Q. (and even has a tattoo of the nickname dedicated to her), with helping him overcome his drug addiction. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Susan told Robert that if he wanted to be with her, he'd have to be completely sober, and she'd break up with him if he relapsed. They began dating after meeting on set in 2003.\n\n\"Addiction was so foreign to me,\" she said. \"I was incredibly ignorant of the hold it had on people.\"\n\nBy 2005, they were married.\n\n\"Susan, you are my bedrock, touchstone and lucky stars to boot,\" the two-time Oscar nominee wrote on Instagram to celebrate their 17th wedding anniversary in 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Corbett and Bo Derek: 22 years\n\nCorbett and Derek have been together since 2002, after they met on a blind date. They moved in together that same year and live together on a 130-acre ranch on the California coast. They tied the knot in December 2020 after 18 years of dating.\n\nIn 2010, Corbett told People that being with him takes \"infinite patience and almost zero ego.\" And while they've been together for almost two decades, he insists that, \"We're too old for soulmates. She's [63] and I'm [58]. Soulmates is for Romeo and Juliet. This is, 'Hey, I try not to fart too loud in your presence.'\"\n\nIn 2008, Derek, for her part, said that Corbett is \"just fun, so much fun. I'm very happy now,\" according to The Daily Mail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSacha Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher: 22 years\n\nWith Cohen taking on notorious roles, such as Borat, their marriage is far from ordinary.\n\n\"Instead of asking, 'Are you going to pick up the dry cleaning?' I'd ask, 'Are we getting sued by somebody?' or 'Is there a warrant out for your arrest?'\" Fisher told Square Mile magazine in 2016.\n\nDespite her constant worries, she's still game for the wild adventures her husband takes them on. She even helped him sneak in his banned Ali G costume to the Oscars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarrison Ford and Calista Flockhart: 22 years\n\nFord and Flockhart may be two A-list actors, but that doesn't mean that Ford didn't need a little help winning her over. He apparently got some wingman help from actor James Marsden, who had dinner with the future couple first, according to a 2013 interview with Playboy.\n\nIt didn't take long for Ford to be totally smitten.\n\n\"I'm in love,\" Ford told Hello! magazine in 2003. \"Romantic love is one of the most exciting and fulfilling kinds of love and I think there is a potential for it at any stage of your life. I was not surprised that I was able to fall in love, and I wasn't surprised that I did.\"\n\nThey married in 2009 in a casual ceremony.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaggie Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard: 22 years\n\nThe two actors began dating in 2002, and have been together ever since. They got married in 2009 and share two daughters.\n\nThey've also worked together — Sarsgaard appears in his wife's directorial debut, \"The Lost Daughter.\"\n\nIn 2019, they gave Architectural Digest a peek into their Brooklyn, New York, apartment, and it confirmed they seem like a couple we'd want to hang out with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeBron James and Savannah Brinson: 22 years\n\nThe NBA superstar and his wife began dating in 2002, while they were still teenagers — they had their first date at an Outback Steakhouse, she told Cleveland Magazine. They even went to prom together.\n\n\"I guess you could say he was a pretty good date,\" Brinson said in a speech at YWCA's Circle 2017. \"After all, we're still going on more dates, three kids, and 15 years later.\"\n\nThey were married in 2013 and now have three children: LeBron Jr., Bryce Maximus, and Zhuri.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaya Rudolph and Paul Thomas Anderson: 23 years\n\nThe \"SNL\" star and the critically beloved director have been in a relationship since 2001, and have four kids together: Pearl, Lucille, Jack, and Minnie.\n\nThough the two have never officially tied the knot, Rudolph considers Anderson her husband, because \"people know what that means.
