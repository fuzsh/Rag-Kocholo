        "text": "Steve Carell’s painful shouts of “Kelly Clarkson” during the waxing scene in “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” is one of the funniest in the actor’s 2005 breakout film.\n\nAnd who can forget Carell’s scene-stealing turn as the annoying anchorman tormented by Jim Carrey in 2004’s “Bruce Almighty”?\n\nCarell, 48, has racked up six Emmy nominations for his role as cringe-inducing boss Michael Scott on “The Office.” And then there are the comedies like “Date Night” with Tina Fey and “Dinner for Schmucks” with Paul Rudd, where Carell displays skill and versatility, seamlessly jumping from subtle, ironic comedy to full-on slapstick and then back again.\n\nIn real life, however, Carell is seemingly ordinary and humble, nothing like that dynamic comedian on screen.\n\n“I’m a little more shy in person than people necessarily expect me to be. I don’t tend to be ‘on’ all the time,” Carell said. “I don’t think I’m naturally a comic per se or trying to be funny, which is sometimes off-putting to people, because sometimes people will expect me to be much funnier than I am.”\n\nIn fact, Carell said he’s not even the funniest guy in his own house. After all, he’s got some competition on the home front: He is married to “Saturday Night Live” alum Nancy Walls, who had a bit part in the Kristen Wiig hit “Bridesmaids.” Carell and Walls married in 1995 and have two children, Elisabeth Anne, 10, and John, 7.\n\n“I think my kids are way funnier than I am. And my wife is really funny, too. Every night, I read with my daughter when I’m putting her to bed, and my wife reads to my son. And she’ll be telling him stories and doing different characters, and I hear them laughing through the door. She’s really, really funny,” Carell said.\n\nFit, tan and well-rested, Carell met reporters in a suite at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Manhattan, N.Y., to promote his new romantic comedy, “Crazy, Stupid, Love.”\n\nIn it, Carell plays a sad-sack husband whose perfect life is disrupted once he learns his cheating wife (Julianne Moore) wants a divorce. Desperate to get his groove back, he enlists the help of ladies’ man Ryan Gosling, who transforms Cal from hapless to hopeful. It’s a role that makes good use of Carell’s deadpan humor and everyman demeanor.\n\n“I thought the script was great and inventive. It took a subject matter that is well tread and put a different spin on it. It’s surprising, and more than anything else, it’s human. I thought the story was very real and very funny at the same time, and that’s a fine line to walk when you want something to be both funny and dramatic at the same time. And those are the things that appeal to me.”\n\nAlso an executive producer on the film, the first one for his new company, Carousel Productions, Carell said one of his goals was to never have the film fall victim to cliches or conventions of the genre.\n\n“I think movies about love can easily become cliche, pedestrian and cloying and manipulative, especially when you go into the dramatic side of it,” he said.\n\nSo Carell hired a pair of directors who color way outside the lines: Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, the duo who helmed the under-watched “I Love You Phillip Morris” and wrote the pitch-black “Bad Santa.”\n\n“I found that those guys had that same barometer and same awareness of never wanting to go into a manipulative moment. Because a comedy which then becomes a drama can be manipulative if it’s not earned,” Carell said. “I felt –– and they agree –– that all those more serious moments had to be earned, and the characters had to be grounded, and you had to relate to them.”\n\nLike his character, Cal, in “Crazy, Stupid, Love,” Carell is a family man in a long-running marriage, a rare feat in Hollywood. Unlike his character, though, Carell’s domesticity is thriving. He met Walls in Chicago, when both were working with the Second City comedy troupe.\n\n“I was very fortunate to marry who I married. I lucked out. She is the right person for me, and I think I’m the right person for her ... I continue to learn new and wonderful things about my wife, and it’s good that I like the things I’m learning,” he said.\n\nCarell has four more feature films on tap, including the comedy “Great Hope Springs” with Meryl Streep; the magician comedy “Burt Wonderstone”; and the pre-apocalyptic comedy “Seeking a Friend for the End of the World” with Keira Knightley. Also, a sequel to last summer’s animated hit “Despicable Me” is in the works.\n\n“I have not read the script yet, and I’m supposed to see it when I get back to Los Angeles in a few weeks,” Carell said. “They’ve actually picked a release date –– the July 4 weekend in two years.”\n\nWorking steadily since the 1980s, Carell’s career has grown incrementally. He’s now at a stage where he can pick and choose roles.\n\n“To have the luxury to do that is remarkable ... I just don’t want to be pretentious about, ‘Yes, I need to move into the more dramatic roles and express myself and prove to everyone I am capable of doing it.’ I think that’s a bad reason to choose roles. I don’t have any big master plan. I’m just kind of sampling things that appeal to me.”\n\nCarell said he would love to team up with his wife on a project.\n\n“I’m a big fan of hers. I think she’s smart and funny. She’s a great writer. I want to encourage her to write some stuff because I think that’s something she hasn’t done and she’d be good at,” Carell said."
