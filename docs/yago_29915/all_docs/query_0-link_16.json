        "text": "Steve Carell and wife Nancy Carell's (nee Walls) 27-year-long marriage is steeped in their love of comedy. And when both Carells are two of the funniest people in Hollywood, it's easy for their relationship to blossom.\n\nIn the early '90s, the pair met at the legendary Chicago comedy club The Second City during improv classes.\n\nAt the time, Steve was a teacher and regular performer, and Nancy was a student who bartended across the road from The Second City.\n\nCarell told The Guardian about his awkward first impression of Nancy.\n\nREAD MORE: Love Stories: How Tina Turner's husband Erwin Bach saved her life\n\n\"She kind of checked all the boxes in my head, but I thought she hated me because she was very quiet around me,\" he said.\n\n\"I thought she for sure knew that I was full of it, and I later found out that she was just as nervous as I was and trying to act cool.\"\n\nHe believes part of the reason their bond is so strong is because of her sense of humour.\n\n\"My wife is way funnier than I am. As much as I don't really feel I share a sense of humour with my family, I definitely share one with her – we find the same things funny.\"\n\nThe two circled each other for months before one asked the other on a date. Steve told Ellen he frequently visited the bar Nancy worked at, and the two flirted back and forth for weeks.\n\nREAD MORE: Dog owner surprises millions with simple sign\n\n\"We were both very, very timid, sort of nervous, shy people around each other,\" he told Ellen.\n\nWhen he finally asked her out, it was in a very roundabout way.\n\n\"The conversation would go something like, 'Hey, you know, if I were ever to ask a woman out, it would be someone like you. Exactly like you,'\" he laughed.\n\n\"And she'd say, 'If a guy like you were ever to ask a woman like me out, I would definitely do that.'\"\n\n\"Other people at the bar must have been like, 'Just do it! Put us all out of our misery.' And finally, we did. It was great.\"\n\nEventually, the two both made it big on the comedy scene. Steve and Nancy were both cast members on Saturday Night Live and held correspondent positions on The Daily Show.\n\nThe couple also worked together on several projects such as The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Angie Tribeca and The Office, in which Nancy played the love interest to Steve's character Michael Scott.\n\nREAD MORE: Woman explains why she has never kissed her boyfriend of two years\n\nAccording to The Office stars Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey, Steve loved working with Nancy.\n\n\"Steve's face would just light up every time she came to set, either if she was in a scene or if she was just coming by with the kids for a visit,\" said Fischer on the Office Ladies podcast.\n\n\"I mean, his adoration of her was just – would go all across his face.\"\n\nNancy and Steve wed in a summer ceremony at a Massachusetts church in 1995.\n\n\"It was over 100 degrees and humid, and the church didn't have air conditioning, and I was sweating bullets. I'll never forget it,\" he recalled.\n\n\"She was walking down the aisle and I immediately stopped sweating. I was full of this sense of calm because I knew that person was going to be my partner and have my back, and I'd have hers. I was literally feeling empowered. It was a feeling like I was more powerful because she was part of my life.\"\n\nSince then, the couple have had two children together: Elisabeth, now 21, and John, 18.\n\nREAD MORE: Actress reveals dark parallels with film that made her star\n\nSteve and Nancy are both incredibly family-oriented. Nancy soft-retired after the birth of her children, and Steve has said his children completely changed the trajectory of his career.\n\n\"I'll never forget the first audition after my daughter was born. I nailed it because I didn't care anymore. All I wanted to do was get home to my baby and it changed my perspective on my career and on the world, on who I was.\"\n\nAccording to The Things, Steve loved his family so much, he always made sure the cast and crew of The Office began work on time so he could get home in time for family dinner.\n\n\"Having children is by far the most important and best thing that we ever did,\" he told The Guardian.\n\nThough, when asked about the secret to his strong marriage he said, \"there's no secret – I think you get lucky.\"\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here."
