Jim Halpert and Michael Scott from The Office—reunited on the red carpet for the New York City premiere of the movie IF, which was written and directed by John with Steve starring as Blue.\n\nDuring their May 13 meet-up, the A Quiet Place director and 40-Year-Old Virgin star—both clad in dark-colored suits—wrapped their arms around each other in an embrace while sharing a smile. The pair also posed with the rest of the film's cast, including Ryan Reynolds, Fiona Shaw and Bobby Moynihan.\n\nWhile this was the first time John, 44, and Steve, 61, hit the red carpet together since The Office‘s 2013 series finale, the two have kept in touch over the years. In fact, John had his former Dunder Mifflin boss in mind when it came to casting his new movie."
