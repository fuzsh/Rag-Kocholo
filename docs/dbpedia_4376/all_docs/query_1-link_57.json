        "text": "The City-County Planning Commission includes twelve (12) citizen members appointed to four year terms. The Mayor of Bowling Green appoints four members, the Warren County Judge-Executive appoints four members and the Mayors of Plum Springs, Oakland, Smiths Grove and Woodburn appoint one member each. Please click the about tab to learn more about what all is under the umbrella of the CCPC organization.\n\nThe twelve planning commissioners have oversight of staff and budget, are the administrative body that implements the communityâ€™s vision based on the Comprehensive Plan, and advises the governmental bodies on land use and policy Issues. While the Planning Commission as an organization and the planning commission as a board are the same, the largest amount of board activity typically seen on television usually involves public hearings and making recommendations on zone changes, future land use, right-of-way closings and other application specific requests. For rezonings, the commissioners hear a case, make a decision in the form of a recommendation, and then pass that recommendation on to the appropriate legislative body for final approval. Some decisions such as future land use map amendments are final action by the planning commission. There are usually some organizational business items (financial reports, personnel actions, project updates, etc.) either toward the beginning or end of each meeting."
