        "text": "Article 2. Ballots.\n\n§ 24.2-612. List of offices and candidates filed with Department of Elections and checked for accuracy; when ballots printed; number required.\n\nImmediately after the expiration of the time provided by law for a candidate for any office to qualify to have his name printed on the official ballot and prior to printing the ballots for an election, each general registrar shall forward to the Department of Elections a list of the county, city, or town offices to be filled at the election and the names of all candidates who have filed for each office. In addition, each general registrar shall forward the name of any candidate who failed to qualify with the reason for his disqualification. On that same day, the general registrar shall also provide a copy of the notice to each disqualified candidate. The notice shall be sent by email or regular mail to the address on the candidate’s certificate of candidate qualification, and such notice shall be deemed sufficient. The Department of Elections shall promptly advise the general registrar of the accuracy of the list. The failure of any general registrar to send the list to the Department of Elections for verification shall not invalidate any election.\n\nEach general registrar shall have printed the number of ballots he determines will be sufficient to conduct the election. Such determination shall be based on the number of active registered voters and historical election data, including voter turnout, and shall be subject to the approval by the electoral board.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provisions of this title, the Department of Elections may print or otherwise provide one statewide paper ballot style for each paper ballot style in use for presidential and vice-presidential electors for use only by persons eligible to vote for those offices only under § 24.2-402 or only for federal elections under § 24.2-453 . The Department of Elections may apportion or authorize the printer or vendor to apportion the costs for these ballots among the localities based on the number of ballots ordered. Any printer employed by the Department of Elections shall execute the statement required by § 24.2-616 . The Department of Elections shall designate a representative to be present at the printing of such ballots and deliver them to the appropriate general registrars pursuant to § 24.2-617 . Upon receipt of such paper ballots, the electoral board or the general registrar shall affix the seal of the electoral board. Thereafter, such ballots shall be handled and accounted for, and the votes counted as the Department of Elections shall specifically direct.\n\nThe general registrar shall make printed ballots available for absentee voting not later than 45 days prior to any election or within three business days of the receipt of a properly completed absentee ballot application, whichever is later. In the case of a special election, excluding for federal offices, if time is insufficient to meet the applicable deadline established herein, then the general registrar shall make printed ballots available as soon after the deadline as possible. For the purposes of this chapter, making printed ballots available includes mailing of such ballots or electronic transmission of such ballots pursuant to § 24.2-706 to a covered voter, as defined in § 24.2-452 , who has applied for an absentee ballot pursuant to § 24.2-701 . Not later than five days after absentee ballots are made available, each general registrar shall report to the Department of Elections, in writing on a form approved by the Department of Elections, whether he has complied with the applicable deadline.\n\nOnly the names of candidates for offices to be voted on in a particular election district shall be printed on the ballots for that election district.\n\nThe general registrar shall send to the Department of Elections a statement of the number of ballots ordered to be printed, proofs of each printed ballot for verification, and copies of each final ballot. If the Department of Elections finds that, in its opinion, the number of ballots ordered to be printed by any general registrar is not sufficient, it may direct the general registrar to order the printing of a reasonable number of additional ballots.\n\nHistory.

The new primary date set by the State Board of Elections shall not be less than thirty days after the Board votes, in open meeting, to set such new date. The State Board of Elections may vote, no later than May 12, 2001, to postpone the June 12, 2001, primary for these offices without deciding a new date. Any meeting called for the purpose of postponing the primary date or setting a new primary date may not be called with less than seven-days notice to the public and the interested parties. The State Board of Elections shall, at the same time that it sets the new primary date, approve a revised schedule of filing dates for such primary and specify which previously filed documents shall continue to be acceptable despite their referencing the June 12, 2001, primary date.\n\n“§ 4.

That the provisions of this act shall expire on January 1, 2002.”\n\nActs 2019, cc. 668 and 669, cl. 2 provides: “That the provisions of this act shall apply to elections beginning with the general election on November 3, 2020.” Acts 2020, c. 1201, cl. 3 repealed clause 2 of Acts 2019, cc. 668 and 669.\n\nThe 2003 amendments.\n\nThe 2003 amendment by c. 1015, inserted the third paragraph; and in the fourth paragraph, substituted “30” for “thirty,” and “45” for “forty-five.”\n\nThe 2009 amendments.\n\nThe 2009 amendment by c. 522, in the fourth paragraph, substituted “In” for “or (ii) in,” inserted “the electoral board shall make printed ballots available” and made a related change.\n\nThe 2010 amendments.\n\nThe 2010 amendments by cc. 449 and 645 are identical, and in the fourth paragraph, rewrote the first sentence, which formerly read: “The electoral board shall make printed ballots available for absentee voting at least (i) 45 days prior to any November general election or special election held at the same time and (ii) 30 days prior to any other general, special, or primary election” and inserted “excluding for federal offices” and added the last two sentences.\n\nThe 2011 amendments.\n\nThe 2011 amendments by cc. 427 and 458 are identical, and inserted “or within three business days of the receipt of a properly completed absentee ballot application, whichever is later” in the first sentence in the fourth paragraph.\n\nThe 2012 amendments.\n\nThe 2012 amendment by c. 353 deleted former clause (iii), pertaining to single paper ballot styles for congressional district offices, in the first sentence of the third paragraph, and made related changes.\n\nThe 2013 amendments.\n\nThe 2013 amendment by c. 684 inserted the third and fourth sentences in the first paragraph.\n\nThe 2014 amendments.\n\nThe 2014 amendments by c. 540, effective April 3, 2014, and c. 576, effective April 4, 2014, are identical, and in the last paragraph, deleted “paper” following “number of” and substituted “printed” for “paper and voting equipment.”\n\nThe 2015 amendments.\n\nThe 2015 amendment by c. 313 substituted “Department of Elections” for “State Board” throughout the section; and in the third paragraph, deleted the designation “(i)” following “may print or otherwise provide,” and substituted “only for federal elections under § 24.2-453 ” for “clause (iii) or (v) of subsection B of § 24.2-416.1 or (ii) one statewide paper ballot style for each paper ballot style in use for Governor, Lieutenant Governor or Attorney General only for use as the early absentee ballot specified in § 24.2-702 ” at the end of the first sentence.\n\nThe 2016 amendments.\n\nThe 2016 amendments by cc. 18 and 492 are identical, and substituted “general registrar” for “electoral board” throughout the section; added the second sentence in the second paragraph; substituted “or the general registrar shall affix the seal of the electoral board” for “shall affix its seal” in the third paragraph; substituted “general registrar” for “local electoral board” and for “local board” in the last sentence of the last paragraph.\n\nThe 2017 amendments.\n\nThe 2017 amendments by cc. 167 and 356 are identical, and inserted “based on the number of active registered voters and historical election data, including voter turnout, and shall be” in the second paragraph.\n\nThe 2019 amendments.\n\nThe 2019 amendments by cc. 668 and 669 are identical, and in the fourth paragraph, substituted “subdivision A 2” for “subdivision 2.”\n\nThe 2020 amendments.\n\nThe 2020 amendments by cc. 1149, 1151, and 1201 are identical, and substituted “covered voter, as defined in § 24.2-452 , who has applied for an absentee ballot pursuant to § 24.2-701 ” for “qualified absentee voter who is eligible for an absentee ballot under subdivision A 2 of § 24.2-700 ” at the end in the fourth paragraph in the penultimate sentence.\n\nLaw Review.\n\nFor Article, “Lessons from Improvements in Military and Overseas Voting,” 47 U. Rich. L. Rev. 833 (2013).\n\n§ 24.2-612.1. Ballots; death, withdrawal, or disqualification of candidates.\n\nIn the case of the death, withdrawal, or disqualification of any candidate, other than a party nominee, who has qualified to have his name printed on the ballot for any election other than a presidential or primary election, the Department of Elections shall take into account the time available before the election and the status of the ballots for the election and shall have authority to direct the electoral boards on how to proceed to print the ballot without the candidate’s name, correct the ballot to delete the candidate’s name, or provide notice to voters of the death, withdrawal, or disqualification of the candidate. If ballots are not corrected to delete the candidate’s name, the general registrar shall provide a list of candidates who have withdrawn to be posted in each polling place and to be available to the public. If election information is posted on the official website for the county or city, notice of the candidate’s withdrawal shall also be posted on that website.\n\nThe Department shall have like authority in the case of the death, withdrawal, or disqualification of a party nominee subject to the provisions of Article 5 (§ 24.2-539 et seq.) of Chapter 5.\n\nHistory. 1995, c. 329; 2017, c. 346.\n\nThe 2017 amendments.\n\nThe 2017 amendment by c. 346 substituted “Department of Elections” for “State Board of Elections” throughout, added last two sentences to the first paragraph, and made minor stylistic changes.\n\n§ 24.2-612.2. Notice of withdrawal of candidates.\n\nA candidate who has qualified to have his name printed on the ballot for an election shall not be deemed to have withdrawn from such election until he has submitted a signed written notice declaring his intent to withdraw from such election and that notice has been received by the general registrar. Such notice shall be provided to the general registrar of the county or city in which he resides. In the case of an election held in more than one county or city, the recipient general registrar shall notify the appropriate general registrars of the candidate’s withdrawal.\n\nThe Department shall include in its candidate guidance documents the requirements and process for candidate withdrawal.\n\nHistory. 2017, c. 346.\n\n§ 24.2-613. Form of ballot.\n\nThe ballots shall comply with the requirements of this title and the standards prescribed by the State Board. The names of all candidates to appear on the ballots shall be in the same font, size, and style.\n\nFor elections for federal, statewide, and General Assembly offices only, each candidate who has been nominated by a political party or in a primary election shall be identified by the name of his political party. Independent candidates shall be identified by the term “Independent.” For the purpose of this section, any Independent candidate may, by producing sufficient and appropriate evidence of nomination by a “recognized political party” to the State Board, have the term “Independent” on the ballot converted to that of a “recognized political party” on the ballot and be treated on the ballot in a manner consistent with the candidates nominated by political parties. For the purpose of this section, a “recognized political party” is defined as an organization that, for at least six months preceding the filing of its nominee for the office, has had in continual existence a state central committee composed of registered voters residing in each congressional district of the Commonwealth, a party plan and bylaws, and a duly elected state chairman and secretary. A letter from the state chairman of a recognized political party certifying that a candidate is the nominee of that party and also signed by such candidate accepting that nomination shall constitute sufficient and appropriate evidence of nomination by a recognized political party. The name of the political party, the name of the “recognized political party,” or term “Independent” may be shown by an initial or abbreviation to meet ballot requirements.\n\nExcept as provided for primary elections, the State Board shall determine by lot the order of the political parties, and the names of all candidates for a particular office shall appear together in the order determined for their parties. In an election district in which more than one person is nominated by one political party for the same office, the candidates’ names shall appear alphabetically in their party groups under the name of the office, with sufficient space between party groups to indicate them as such. For the purpose of this section, except as provided for presidential elections in § 24.2-614 , “recognized political parties” shall be treated as a class; the order of the recognized political parties within the class shall be determined by lot by the State Board; and the class shall follow the political parties as defined by § 24.2-101 and precede the independent class. Independent candidates shall be treated as a class under “Independent”, and their names shall be placed on the ballot after the political parties and recognized political parties. Where there is more than one independent candidate for an office, their names shall appear on the ballot in an order determined by the priority of time of filing for the office. In the event two or more candidates file simultaneously, the order of filing shall then be determined by lot by the electoral board as in the case of a tie vote for the office.For the purposes of this subsection, “time of filing for the office” means the time at which an independent candidate has filed his petition signature pages with a number of signatures at least equal to the number required for the office pursuant to § 24.2-506 . In the case of an office for which no petition is required, “time of filing for the office” means the time at which the candidate has filed his completed statement of qualification pursuant to § 24.2-501 .No individual’s name shall appear on the ballot more than once for the same office.\n\nOn any ballot, all offices to be elected shall appear before any questions presented to the voters.\n\nIn preparing the printed ballots for general, special, and primary elections, the State Board and general registrars shall cause to be printed in not less than 10-point type, immediately below the title of any office, a statement of the number of candidates for whom votes may be cast for that office. For any office to which only one candidate can be elected, the following language shall be used: “Vote for only one.” For any office to which more than one candidate can be elected, the following language shall be used: “Vote for not more than _______________ .”\n\nAny locality that uses machine-readable ballots at one or more precincts, including any central absentee precinct, may, with the approval of the State Board, use a printed reproduction of the machine-readable ballot in lieu of the official machine-readable ballot. Such reproductions shall be printed and otherwise handled in accordance with all laws and procedures that apply to official paper ballots.\n\nHistory. Code 1950, §§ 24-215, 24-217; 1970, c. 462, §§ 24.1-111, 24.1-113; 1971, Ex. Sess., c. 119; 1972, c. 620; 1973, c. 30; 1974, c. 428; 1980, c. 639; 1981, c. 425; 1993, c. 641; 2000, cc. 282, 514, 866; 2002, c. 738; 2008, c. 544; 2010, c. 204; 2014, cc. 540, 568, 576; 2016, c. 493; 2017, cc. 352, 364; 2018, cc. 464, 537; 2019, cc. 99, 283, 289.\n\nCross references.\n\nFor constitutional provisions as to ballots, see Va. Const., Art. II, § 3.\n\nEditor’s note.\n\nActs 2016, c. 493, cl. 2 provides: “That the provisions of this act shall apply to all elections occurring after July 1, 2016.”\n\nThe 2000 amendments.\n\nThe 2000 amendments by cc. 282 and 866 are identical, and added the present second paragraph and the last two paragraphs.\n\nThe 2000 amendment by c. 514, effective January 1, 2001, added the present third paragraph, and deleted the former third paragraph, referring to the prohibition against names of political parties appearing on ballots.\n\nThe 2002 amendments.\n\nThe 2002 amendment by c. 738, in the third paragraph, inserted the third to fifth sentences, and inserted “the name of the ‘recognized political party’ ” in the last sentence; and in the fourth paragraph, inserted “ ‘recognized political parties’ shall be treated as a class; the order of the recognized political parties within the class shall be determined by lot by the State Board; and the class shall follow the political parties as defined by § 24.2-101 and precede the independent class” at the end of the third sentence, and inserted “and recognized political parties” in the last sentence.\n\nThe 2008 amendments.\n\nThe 2008 amendment by c. 544 substituted the introductory paragraph for the former introductory and the second paragraphs, which read: “The ballots shall be white paper without any distinguishing mark or symbol and shall contain the names of all the candidates qualifying to have their names printed on the official ballot as provided by law. Their names shall be printed in black ink, immediately below the office for which they have qualified as candidates. The names on the ballot shall be in clear print; each name shall be on a separate line; and the type used in printing the ballots shall be plain roman type, not smaller than twelve-point pica. Immediately to the left of and on the same line with the name of each candidate shall be printed a square, not less than one-quarter, nor more than one-half inch in size, printed thus: • JOHN DOE\n\n“However, the provisions of this title pertaining to ballot squares shall not be applicable to punchcard or mark sense ballots.”\n\nThe 2010 amendments.\n\nThe 2010 amendment by c. 204 inserted “and also signed by such candidate accepting that nomination” in the penultimate sentence of the second paragraph.\n\nThe 2014 amendments.\n\nThe 2014 amendments by c. 540, effective April 3, 2014, and c. 576, effective April 4, 2014, are identical, and deleted “and § 24.2-640 ” following “for the purpose of this section” in the third sentence of the third paragraph; in the fifth paragraph inserted “printed” and substituted “for whom votes” for “who” and “cast” for “voted for”; deleted the sixth paragraph which read “At any precinct at which mark sense ballots are used, the mark sense ballot may be used in lieu of the official paper ballot with the approval of the State Board”; in the sixth paragraph substituted “that” for “which,” “machine-readable” for “mark sense” twice and for “paper,” “a” for “the mark sense ballot or,” and made a stylistic change; and added the last paragraph.\n\nThe 2014 amendment by c. 568 in the fifth paragraph substituted “For any office to which only one candidate can be elected, the following language shall be used: ‘Vote for only one.’ For any office to which more than one candidate can be elected, the” for “The.”\n\nThe 2016 amendments.\n\nThe 2016 amendments by c. 493, added subsection designators; in subsection C, inserted “except that the names of candidates for school boards elected pursuant to § 22.1-57.3 shall appear on the ballot in an order determined by the priority of time of filing for the office.

State Bd. of Elections v. Forb, 214 Va. 264 , 199 S.E.2d 527, 1973 Va. LEXIS 290 (1973) (decided under former § 24.1-111 as it stood before the 1980 amendment).\n\nConstitutionality. —\n\nPolitical party member failed to show that the state’s tiered ballot ordering law imposed more than the most modest burdens on the constitutional rights to free speech, free association, and equal protection, since all parties were subject to the same requirements and none were automatically elevated to the top of the ballot, the member was not denied access to the ballot, there was no denial of the right to vote, and the tiered ballot allocated any benefit of positional bias in a neutral and nondiscriminatory manner. Sarvis v. Alcorn, 826 F.3d 708, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 11094 (4th Cir. 2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 1093, 197 L. Ed. 2d 182, 2017 U.S. LEXIS 1386 (2017).\n\nWhen Virginia amended subsection B of § 24.2-613 in 2000 to expand the categories of offices for which official ballots would include party identifiers while continuing to ban party identifiers for candidates for local offices, it did not violate the right to association protected by U.S. Const. amend. I, XIV, or the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Marcellus v. Va. State Bd. of Elections, 849 F.3d 169, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 2928 (4th Cir. 2017).\n\nPurpose for which independents deemed political party. —\n\nFormer § 24.1-111 provided a practical, reasonable method for determining the order and manner in which names of candidates are placed on a ballot. Only for the purpose of implementing that method, and for no other purpose, are independents deemed a political party. State Bd. of Elections v. Forb, 214 Va. 264 , 199 S.E.2d 527, 1973 Va. LEXIS 290 (1973) (decided under former § 24.1-111 as it stood before the 1980 amendment).\n\nThe ballot does not describe the independents as a political party; former § 24.1-111 forbids such description. State Bd. of Elections v. Forb, 214 Va. 264 , 199 S.E.2d 527, 1973 Va. LEXIS 290 (1973) (decided under former § 24.1-111 as it stood before the 1980 amendment).\n\nNor does position on the ballot suggest that an independent candidate shares the philosophy or platform of any other independent candidate. State Bd. of Elections v. Forb, 214 Va. 264 , 199 S.E.2d 527, 1973 Va. LEXIS 290 (1973) (decided under former § 24.1-111 as it stood before the 1980 amendment).\n\n§ 24.2-614. Preparation and form of presidential election ballots.\n\nAs soon as practicable after the seventy-fourth day before the presidential election, the State Board shall certify to the general registrar of each county and city the form of official ballot for the presidential election which shall be uniform throughout the Commonwealth.

Falls Church Taxpayers League v. City of Falls Church, 203 Va. 604 , 125 S.E.2d 817, 1962 Va. LEXIS 193 (1962) (decided under prior law).\n\nCity charter referring to “separate ballot box” for freeholders. —\n\nIn light of the broad statutory authorization relating to the use of voting machines, provisions in a city charter referring to the use of a “separate ballot box” for freeholders in a bond election should not be read as invalidating the use of voting machines with a special setting made to record the vote of a freeholder. Falls Church Taxpayers League v. City of Falls Church, 203 Va. 604 , 125 S.E.2d 817, 1962 Va. LEXIS 193 (1962) (decided under prior law).\n\nOPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nDirect recording electronic machines. —\n\nLocal electoral boards are prohibited from borrowing or leasing direct recording electronic machines. Further, this section prohibits local boards from purchasing, borrowing, or leasing direct recording electronic machines for use at polling places on election day to demonstrate to voters how to operate the equipment pursuant to § 24.2-647 . See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. G. William Thomas, Jr., Chairman, Electoral Board for the City of Richmond, 08-030 (6/16/08).\n\n§ 24.2-626.1. Acquisition and use of accessible voting devices.\n\nThe governing body of any county or city shall provide for the use of a voting or counting system in all elections that shall:\n\nProvide for at least one voting system equipped for individuals with disabilities at each polling place, including nonvisual accessibility for the blind and visually impaired, in a manner that provides the same opportunity for access and participation (including privacy and independence) as for other voters; and\n\nProvide alternative language accessibility when required by § 203 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. § 10503).\n\nHistory. 2007, cc. 939, 943.\n\nEditor’s note.\n\nActs 2007, cc. 939 and 943, cl. 2 provides: “That the State Board of Elections shall be authorized to determine the equitable allocation of any federal or state funds made available to implement the provisions of this act among the counties and cities of the Commonwealth.”\n\nAt the direction of the Virginia Code Commission, “52 U.S.C. § 10503” was substituted for “42 U.S.C. § 1973aa-1a” to conform to the editorial reclassification of Title 52, U.S.C., effective September 1, 2014.\n\n§ 24.2-627. Electronic voting systems; number required.\n\nThe governing body of any county or city that adopts for use at elections ballot scanner machines shall provide for each precinct at least one voting booth with a marking device for each 425 registered voters or portion thereof and shall provide for each precinct at least one scanner. However, each precinct having more than 4,000 registered voters shall be provided with not less than two scanners at a presidential election, unless the governing body, in consultation with the general registrar and the electoral board, determines that a second scanner is not necessary at any such precinct on the basis of voter turnout and the average wait time for voters in previous presidential elections.\n\nThe local electoral board of any county or city shall be authorized to conduct any May general election, primary election, or special election held on a date other than a November general election with the number of voting systems determined by the board and the general registrar to be appropriate for each precinct, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A.\n\nFor purposes of applying this section, a general registrar may exclude persons voting absentee in his calculations, and if he does so shall send to the Department a statement of the number of voting systems to be used in each precinct. If the State Board finds that the number of voting systems is not sufficient, it may direct the general registrar to use more voting systems.\n\nHistory. 1985, c. 458, §§ 24.1-203.1, 24.1-203.2; 1993, c. 641; 1996, c. 271; 1997, cc. 304, 336; 2010, c. 214; 2014, cc. 540, 576; 2015, cc. 667, 740; 2016, cc. 18, 464, 492.\n\nEditor’s note.\n\nActs 2016, c. 464, cl. 2 provides: “That the provisions of this act shall become effective on July 1, 2020.”\n\nThe 2010 amendments.\n\nThe 2010 amendment by c. 214 added subsection D.\n\nThe 2014 amendments.\n\nThe 2014 amendments by c. 540, effective April 3, 2014, and c. 576, effective April 4, 2014, are identical and, in subsection A, substituted “that” for “which,” “machines” for “voting systems” and “devices,” deleted “mechanical or” following “elections,” and inserted “recording”; in subsection B substituted “that” for “which,” “ballot scanner machines” for “any electronic system which requires the voter to vote a ballot which is inserted in an electronic counter,” and “scanner” for “counting device”; in subsection C substituted “counting machines” for “marking devices” and deleted “of this section” at the end.\n\nThe 2015 amendments.\n\nThe 2015 amendments by cc. 667 and 740 are nearly identical and added the second sentence of subsection B.

State Board approval process of electronic voting systems.\n\nAny person, firm, or corporation, referred to in this article as the “vendor,” manufacturing, owning, or offering for sale any electronic voting or counting machine and ballots designed to be used with such equipment may apply to the State Board, in the manner prescribed by the Board, to have examined a production model of such equipment and the ballots used with it. The Board may require the vendor to pay a reasonable application fee when he files his request for testing or certification of new or upgraded voting equipment. Receipts from such fees shall be credited to the Board for reimbursement of testing and certification expenses. In addition to any other materials that may be required, a current statement of the financial status of the vendor, including any assets and liabilities, shall be filed with the Board; if the vendor is not the manufacturer of the equipment for which application is made, such a statement shall also be filed for the manufacturer. These statements shall be exempt from the provisions of the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (§ 2.2-3700 et seq.). The Board shall require, at a site of its choosing, a demonstration of such equipment and ballots and may require that a production model of the equipment and a supply of ballots be provided to the Board for testing purposes. The Board shall also require the vendor to provide documentation of the practices recommended by the vendor to ensure the optimum security and functionality of the system.\n\nThe Board may approve any kind of electronic voting system that meets the following requirements:\n\nIt shall provide clear instructions for voters on how to mark or select their choice and cast that vote.\n\nIt shall provide facilities for voting for all offices at any election and on as many questions as may be submitted at any election.\n\nIt shall be capable of processing ballots for all parties holding a primary election on the same day, but programmable in such a way that an individual ballot cast by a voter is limited to the party primary election in which the voter chooses to participate.\n\nIt shall require votes for presidential and vice presidential electors to be cast for the presidential and vice presidential electors of one party by one operation. The ballot shall contain the words “Electors for” preceded by the name of the party or other authorized designation and followed by the names of the candidates for the offices of President and Vice President.\n\nIt shall enable the voter to cast votes for as many persons for an office as lawfully permitted, but no more. It shall prevent the voter from casting a vote for the same person more than once for the same office. However, ballot scanner machines shall not be required to prevent a voter from voting for a greater number of candidates than he is lawfully entitled to.\n\nIt shall enable the voter to cast a vote on any question on which he is lawfully permitted to vote, but no other.\n\nIt shall provide the voter with an opportunity to correct any error before a ballot is cast.\n\nIt shall correctly register or record and accurately count all votes cast for candidates and on questions.\n\nIt shall be provided with a “protective counter,” whereby any operation of the machine before or after the election will be detected.\n\nIt shall be provided with a counter that at all times during an election shall show how many persons have voted.\n\nIt shall ensure voting in absolute secrecy. Ballot scanner machines shall provide for the secrecy of the ballot and a method to conceal the voted ballot.\n\nIt shall be programmable to allow ballots to be separated when necessary.\n\nIt shall retain each printed ballot cast.\n\nBallot scanner machines shall report, if possible, the number of ballots on which a voter undervoted or overvoted.\n\nAfter its examination of the equipment, ballots, and other materials submitted by the vendors, the Board shall prepare and file in its office a report of its finding as to (i) the apparent capability of such equipment to accurately count, register, and report votes; (ii) whether the system can be conveniently used without undue confusion to the voter; (iii) its accessibility to voters with disabilities; (iv) whether the system can be safely used without undue potential for fraud; (v) the ease of its operation and transportation by voting equipment custodians and officers of election; (vi) the financial stability of the vendor and manufacturer; (vii) whether the system meets the requirements of this title; (viii) whether the system meets federal requirements; (ix) whether issues of reliability and security identified with the system by other state governments have been adequately addressed by the vendor; and (x) whether, in the opinion of the Board, the potential for approval of such system is such as to justify further examination and testing.\n\nIf the Board determines that there is such potential and prior to its final determination as to approval or disapproval of such system, the Board shall obtain a report by an independent electronics or engineering consultant as to (i) whether the system accurately counts, registers, and reports votes; (ii) whether it is capable of storing and retaining existing votes in a permanent memory in the event of power failure during and after the election; (iii) the number of separate memory capabilities for the storage of recorded votes; (iv) its mechanical and electronic perfections and imperfections; (v) the audit trail provided by the system; (vi) the anticipated frequency of repair; (vii) the ease of repair; (viii) the anticipated life of the equipment; (ix) its potential for fraudulent use; (x) its accessibility to voters with disabilities; (xi) the ease of its programming, transportation, and operation by voting equipment custodians and officers of election; and (xii) any other matters deemed necessary by the Board. Failure by an applicant to cooperate with the consultant by furnishing information and production equipment and ballots requested shall be deemed a withdrawal of the application, but nothing in this section shall require the disclosure of trade secrets by the applicant. If such trade secrets are essential to the proper analysis of the system and are provided for that reason, the consultant shall subscribe to an oath subject to the penalty for perjury that he will neither disclose nor make use of such information except as necessary for the system analysis. The report of the consultant shall be filed in the office of the Board.\n\nIn preparing the reports cited in subsections C and D, the Board shall require, as a condition of certification, that the system is comprehensively examined by individuals including at least one expert in election management and one in computer system security. The Board shall develop, in conjunction with the above listed individuals, a specific set of items to be examined and tested as part of the certification process to further elaborate on the requirements identified in this section.\n\nIf the Board determines that there is potential for approval of the system and prior to its final determination, the Board shall also require that the system be tested in an actual election in one or more counties or cities. Its use at such election shall be as valid for all purposes as if it had been legally approved by the Board and adopted by the counties or cities.\n\nIf, following testing, the Board approves any voting system and its ballots for use, the Board shall so notify the electoral boards of each county and city. Systems so approved may be adopted for use at elections as herein provided. No form of voting system and ballots not so approved shall be adopted by any county or city. Any voting system and ballots approved for use by the Board shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this title and any applicable federal laws, and their use in any election shall be valid.\n\nA vendor whose voting system is approved for use shall provide updates concerning its recommended practices for optimum security and functionality of the system, as may be requested by the Board. Any product for which requested updates are not provided shall be deemed non-compliant and may be decertified at the discretion of the Board.\n\nThe Board shall have the authority to investigate, at its discretion, any voting system certified in Virginia to ensure that it continues to meet the standards outlined in subsections C and D. The Board may, at its discretion, decertify any voting system based on significant problems detected with the voting system in Virginia or on reports provided by federal authorities or other state election officials.\n\nHistory. 1985, c. 458, §§ 24.1-207.1; 1986, c. 558, § 24.1-206.3; 1993, c. 641; 1994, cc. 287, 742; 2001, cc. 640, 641; 2003, c. 1015; 2004, cc. 409, 993, 1010; 2007, c. 794; 2008, c. 703; 2014, cc. 540, 576; 2020, c. 294.\n\nThe 2001 amendments.\n\nThe 2001 amendment by c. 640 added the last sentence in subsection B.\n\nThe 2001 amendment by c. 641 added the last two sentences in subsection B.\n\nThe 2003 amendments.\n\nThe 2003 amendment by c. 1015, inserted the second and third sentences in subsection A.\n\nThe 2004 amendments.\n\nThe 2004 amendment by c. 409 inserted subsection B1 and made minor stylistic changes.\n\nThe 2004 amendments by cc. 993 and 1010 are identical, and substituted “that” for “which” in subsection B; in subsection C, added present clause (viii) and redesignated former clause (viii) as (ix) and made a related change; and inserted “and any applicable federal laws” in subsection F.\n\nThe 2007 amendments.\n\nThe 2007 amendment by c. 794 added the last sentence to subsection A; and added subsection G.\n\nThe 2008 amendments.\n\nThe 2008 amendment by c. 703, in subsection C, inserted clause (ix), redesignated former clause (ix) as clause (x) and made related changes; added subsections D1 and H; and added the last sentence in subsection G.\n\nThe 2014 amendments.\n\nThe 2014 amendments by c. 540, effective April 3, 2014, and c. 576, effective April 4, 2014, are identical, and deleted “hereinafter” following “corporation” in subsection A, inserted “in this article,” and substituted “machine” for “system” and “equipment” for “system” twice; rewrote subsection B; redesignated subdivision D 1 as subsection E and redesignated the remaining subsections accordingly; in subsections G and H substituted “voting” for “electronic” throughout the subsections; and deleted “annual” preceding “updates” and “to the State Board” following “updates” in subsection H, inserted “as may be requested by the Board,” and substituted “requested” for “annual.”\n\nThe 2020 amendments.\n\nThe 2020 amendment by c. 294, added a new subdivision B 13 and redesignated former subdivision B 13 as subdivision B 14.\n\n§ 24.2-630. Experimental use of approved systems.\n\nWith the approval of the State Board, the governing body of any county, city, or town may provide for the experimental use at an election in one or more election districts or precincts of a voting or counting system which it might legally adopt without a formal adoption thereof, and its use at such election shall be valid for all purposes.\n\nHistory.
