And immerse yourself in Kentucky’s complex Civil War stories at sites ranging from battlefields to cemeteries to house museums.\n\nKentucky was shaped by its many waterways, and visiting Ohio River towns like Paducah, Maysville and Ashland will offer a glimpse into how the river brought life to the young state. Learn about Kentucky coal mining history and the important role coal has played in Kentucky’s industrial and cultural heritage by visiting Appalachian Mountain mining towns like Benham and Lynch.
