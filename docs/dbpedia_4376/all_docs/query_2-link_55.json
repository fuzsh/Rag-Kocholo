Woodburn turns the lessons he learned from Wooden into lessons we can all use.”\n\n– Ken McAlpine, novelist and winner of three Lowell Thomas Awards\n\n\"Woody Woodburn brings to life the magic that was John Wooden. Wooden & Me captures the imagination and ignites the soul like only the wisdom of the Wizard of Westwood can.”\n\n– Jonathan Gold, sports journalist and radio host of The Bruin Report\n\nFor more reviews and interviews with Woody about Coach, go to the WOODEN & ME Media page:\n\nHello and welcome!
