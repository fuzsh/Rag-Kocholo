        "text": "Henry! I put your tent to the test last summer hiking 270 miles over 20 days on the John Muir Trail. I couldn't be happier with this piece of perfection. My buddy brought along his Notch and is also incredibly happy. When I was hiking I took video every mile of the way, cut each mile into 1 second clips, and compiled that into an 8 minute video that documents the entire 270 miles of hiking. I thought I'd share with you since it features your awesome tents in several scenes. I hope you enjoy.\n\nKeep up the awesome work!\n\nZach\n\njust want to say THANK YOU for an incredible tent! My notch kept me safe and warm through my AT thru hike, absolutely loved every night in it, except when it fell over in SNP and I got deluged in rain, but that was my fault incredible products and thank you so much! SUPER AWESOME GNARLY 7 OUT OF 5 STARS\n\nJacob\n\nHenry,\n\nI'm officially a thru-hiker now! Finished the AT earlier this week. First and foremost let me say thanks for your help and your great product - the Protrail, My Protrail stood up to some mighty heavy winds, heavy rain, and even a tiny bit of snow. I drove my tent stakes into some rocky ground and only marginally bent one stake (which is still usable). Overall I was very happy with with it and look forward to using it again in the future.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nMark\n\nTarptent Team,\n\nI just wanted to send my thanks for making the most amzing backpacking tents around. I've been using my tarptent for several years in the high Rockies of Colorado. My friends are always amazed by the light weight, spacious tent that packs up so small. It's been robust and dries quickly after rain. All the doubts about not having a footprint or rainfly or free-standing tent are put to rest -- it just works, and it works well.\n\nI just spent a rainy night with my two small kids at 10,200 ft, with temperatures just around freezing. The Tarptent did it's job, and kept us all dry through the night.\n\nCheers to the Tarptent team. You make an awesome product.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nMark Hinton\n\nTimnath, CO\n\nI ordered a tent from Tarptent and my wife and I were not 100% satisfied it met our needs. Called and spoke with Henry Shires and he graciously told me to send it back for a refund. I inquired about other tents and Henry guided me to the Saddle 2. Tarptent staff then seam sealed and shipped it the same day! Our trip was the following Friday and we received our Saddle 2 on Thursday! Thank you Tarptent! You guys are the best! We used the Saddle 2 on our 4 day 3 night trip to Dolly Sods, WV. Apparently the wettest place on earth! First night we were in a hard downpour for an hour. Saddle kept us dry and as my wife put it “snuggie.” The second night it was foggy, a 20 foot fog, AND it rained all night. There was some condensation but any tent would have some in those conditions. The venting system on the Saddle 2 is remarkable and it kept us warm and dry. Thanks to Henry for suggesting we get the partial solid sides! It was a great addition as the temperatures dipped into the 40’s and the side helped keep us warm. The third night it finally cleared up in the afternoon and we had our first sunny partial day and clear night! We camped on a high plateau overlooking a valley about 400 feet below. As we sat eating our dinner in the dimming light we could see the fog beginning to form in the valley. By 9 pm our plateau was submerged in fog. You could look up into the sky and see stars but looking at the tree near us 10 feet from the tent it was difficult to make it out. The Saddle 2 again did its job and kept us dry and warm. Thank you Tarptent for making such lightweight and remarkably weatherproof tents! The craftsmanship on these tents is unparalleled and the customer service is exceptional! I will be purchasing a one person tent in the near future for solo trips and Tarptent is my only choice!\n\nBill Ketner\n\nThe 26 oz, all-in-one, waterproof shelter stands out on a few levels. The price point is exceptional, especially considering that it's American made. And compared to other ultralight shelters, pitching the ProTrail is as easy as any staked setup we've used.\n\nFor traveling by bike, the ProTrail is a brilliant option as it packs down to near nothing. I was able to fit the entire setup into one side of my Porcelain Rocketpartial frame pack.\n\nPatrick Murphy GearJunkie\n\nI have owned my Tarptent Double Rainbow (DR) for four years. It’s seen it all- wind, snow, rain (total downpours), heat, and uneven or “unfriendly” ground for pitching. Last summer, I used it to train for and hike the Oregon section of the Pacific Crest Trail. This tent is a workhorse. It withstands everything you throw at it, and it looks nice in the field… when you can see it. One of the things I love best about the DR is its color and ability to blend into its surroundings. This makes the DR great for stealth camping, something I appreciate as a solo female hiker.\n\nThat said, when recently building a backpacking kit to keep at my cabin in Montana, I thought it would be fun to try some different gear that’s currently on the market. One new thing I bought was the Copper Spur UL2 Platinum Tent by Big Agnes for $599. I was curious and excited to see what a $600 tent bought. As it turned out, not much. Upon opening the box, the first thing I noticed was how the Big Agnes, although comparable to the DR in size, was not nearly as compact. It was considerably bulkier and I knew it would take up much more space in my backpack. Remember- this came straight from the factory too. I could only imagine how bulky it’d be once I started packing it! I also noticed right away the material used to construct the tent. It seemed extremely delicate compared to the DR. It was not hard to imagine how easy it would be to rip. This is coming from a person who is very careful with her gear too. Already I was beginning to rethink my decision about not buying the DR, but I decided to pitch the Big Agnes in my living room anyway. Setting it up wasn’t too bad, but without the fly on the tent, you have ZERO privacy. There is nowhere to hide to change clothes, take a sponge bath, or even just lie on your sleeping bag and read. Also, the fly takes a little time to put on, and I was imagining how wet this tent would get when pitching it in the rain. I live in a rainy climate, so this was a major concern. I’ve pitched my DR in the pouring rain many times and am always impressed with how dry the inside remains. At this point, I knew I was packing the $600 tent back up to return to REI and re-ordering the $289 DR instead, but still, I climbed inside to see what the living space was like. Decent enough; however, the zippers were a giant pain. They repeatedly got stuck in the fabric and didn’t close completely. I was imagining being on a long distance hike and having to deal with this every time I opened and closed my tent. No thanks. In all the times I’ve zipped and unzipped my DR, I’ve never once had a problem. I also didn’t like that they didn’t close completely. Bug season anyone? So, back in the bag and back to REI the $600 tent went. I promptly ordered my DR and when it arrived the other day, I was so happy knowing one of the most important pieces of gear in my backpack is also one of my most trusted- and that’s the Tarptent Double Rainbow. Honestly, I don’t think there is a better two-person tent on the market- and Tarptent’s customer service is the best.\n\nLisa Goyne\n\nHi Tarptent - Just wanted to let you know that the MoTrail performed flawlessly on my AT thru hike this year. I slept in it well over 100 out of 150 nights on the trail and could not have been happier. It held up in all weather conditions and I never once got wet during rainstorms. It even stayed stable in 60+ mph wind gusts. On clear nights, I loved having the option to tie back all the flaps and have the feeling of sleeping under a tarp while staying safe from mosquitoes.\n\nA lot of other hikers were intrigued by your design and I expect this tent to become extremely popular in the next few years on the trail.\n\nThanks again!\n\nDan\n\nPatagonia WINDS & rain vs. the Notch---Winner: the Notch\n\nTHANK YOU! Got hit with must have been 60 mph gusts (the guy lines were buzzing!). Everyone was piling rocks on top of their stakes. Me too even with 8\" stakes. Used 2 extra side lines off the handy top hooks. Maybe didn't need them, but I wasn't taking any chances. No problem for the Notch. This was followed by 2.5 days of torrential rain. Ironically I was offered a large octagon tent by worried, kind Refugio rangers, which I tried, until I saw it was leaking and I hastily went back to my Notch which kept me dry and helped dry out some of my wet gear. Because of the Notch's light weight and it's ability to keep my down bag & coat dry, I was able to do the \"O\" trek (12 days for me). Good job on that tent design.\n\nI don't usually write any reviews but I was very happy with the tent and it just doesn't look as impressive as it actually is. People who really need something light like me with bad knees, need to know about your tents. --and you can add that to the mix tt-item too :)\n\nJill Sazanami\n\nHey there!\n\nJust got back from a 2 week trip in the Pecos wilderness, NM. We got hit by some WEATHER… in the form of epic thunderstorms and torrential rain. We were at high elevation and it was cold. It was myself, my dog, and 2 kiddos ages 10 & 12. If we had gotten wet it could have been serious. I cannot say enough about the Tarptent Hogback. I was able to carry it myself along with all of the group gear as the kids only carry their things and a bit of food. It stood up to all the weather that came our way, kept us dry even when water was flowing UNDER the tent, and was a spacious place to spend a rainy day. Another incredible feature is that there is little to no wind flapping sound when the tent is exposed to high winds. That horrible flapping sound that you get with some tents in the wind can be stressful AND keep everyone awake. I slept like a baby through several storms with no tent wind noise. Your product is truly awesome and I have sent a review to all of our backpacking friends that are parents!\n\nI broke one of the corner triangle struts by accidentally dropping a rock on it. Can I order this piece to repair the tent? [Ed: yes, no charge]\n\nThanks so much,\n\n-Melissa Stolasz\n\nPS… the tent was even awesome with a broken corner!\n\nThanks for the great tent! It's nice to finally have a tent that allows me to really stretch out and not be touching the walls or mesh anywhere. It's less weight and the same packed volume as my old two person, but feels like a portable barn inside by comparison. It has stood up very well to alpine weather with the third pole and without. It has also been a casualty management and warming area with enough room that I don't have to straddle the patient anymore, enough space for a rescuer working on each side, and not crouching at all when sitting (this is a huge improvement to my wilderness practice, thank you!!!).\n\nThe next adventure with the Cloudburst 3 will see my girlfriend and I caribou hunting in the Yukon and a trek around Tombstone Territorial Park.\n\nLooking at the Stratospire 2 for a Patagonia trek and maybe a PCT trek next year.\n\nSo, thanks for making such great tents and keep up the good work!\n\nCheers,\n\nJon\n\nHenry, Thank you for helping me pick out the Notch earlier this year. I've taken it on several trips and love how it's durable, lightweight, and so easy to set up, adjust, and pack up, compared to my previous solo tent. I am also impressed by its strength in high winds. For that situation, I don't bring extra guylines, I just place a rock over each stake, and relax in my tent, knowing my trekking poles aren't going to snap. Thanks for sharing your amazing engineering talents!\n\nHeidi\n\nJust wanted to let you know how happy I am with my Double Rainbow. I just completed a 5 day backpacking trip though the Enchantments Wilderness area outside of Leavenworth WA. We had some unexpected bad weather with snow, high winds and rain and my Double Rainbow had no problems. Very satisfied. Thanks for taking the time to make such a quality product.\n\nJim Hite\n\nDear Henry and Team,\n\nI just returned from a rather epic 9000 mile walking pilgrimage from Liechtenstein to Jerusalem and back. I crossed the Alps, the Carpathians, the Caucasus, the Taurus and the Negev desert. I climed the highest peak in Armenia and stood at the lowest place on earth. I was awed by a flash flood in Jordan and hit by a car in Italy. Over a period of 15 months I left my foot prints in 26 countries. And what about those 458 nights? Well, most of them I spent in my Tarptent Rainbow.\n\nI want to congratulate you on your product and say a big thank you. I had lots of gear, but the Rainbow never weighed me down and withstood not few adversities. Even the \"paper-like\" ground sheet (which I find indispensable) is still with me after all this time. The one thing that suffered most and the one tiny detail that could be improved is the pack sack. It could be a little wider. In that way it would maybe experience a little less strain when packing and therefore last longer. In my case the top ripped after about 5000 miles. I had it fixed and the whole part with the string to close the sack came off 2000 miles later. But that is just the pack sack. The tent is great! Again, thank you and keep up your excellent work!\n\nCheers,\n\nFr. Johannes\n\n4kmh.com - A Pilgrimage to Jerusalem and beyond\n\nPurchased my SS2 Tarptent in 2012 I have used it in snow, rain and desert winds. My stuff sack blew away on a recent trip to J-Tree and it was immediately replaced for $5 plus postage. I love my tent and the Tarptent service!!!\n\nJohn Loud\n\nHave over 2300 miles logged with my protrail and its still going strong!! Just wanted to give thanks for such an awesome product!\n\nThe picture was taken at Red river gorge in Kentucky. Great products! Can't wait to buy another tarptent for the fam!\n\nChad Relinski\n\nDuring my five weeks in the Cordilleras Blanca & Huayhuash, I experienced a wide range of challenging conditions. High winds, rain, snow and an apparently short-sighted burro that mistook the vestibule of my shelter for a urinal. Throughout it all the ProTrail held up like a champ, although it did have a lingering funky smell thanks to the aforementioned quadruped (sorry Henry :-))!\n\nDonkey jokes aside, if you are looking for a reasonably priced, lightweight, functional one person shelter for three season conditions, I highly recommend the Tarptent ProTrail.\n\nCam \"Swami\" Honan\n\nProTrail Review\n\nWe went wild camping with our 3yr old in the Scottish Highlands a few weeks back. The Hogback tent was awesome, no worries at all with the mesh inner and plenty of space for us and a fidgety 3yr too! Thanks guys!\n\nAn Outdoors Family\n\nI bought your Notch Tarptent a few years ago when I was still section-hiking the Appalachian Trail. Since then, I finished the AT in 2014 and thru-hiked the Colorado Trail last year. I plan to hike the John Muir Trail in July.\n\nAs a testimonial, your Notch tent is absolutely great. It’s compact, light, sturdy, and waterproof. I slept through many a rainy nights and never got wet. Before I bought, I did a thorough comparison to other tents and besides the benefits I already mentioned, your tent was the best buy for the money. I wouldn’t own any other tent while backpacking.\n\nRex Cowden\n\nHi all,\n\nI recently completed a 12 day hike along the Croajigalong/Nadgee (Vic/NSW Aust) coast with my new Moment DW and I wanted to let you know- I love it. I had completed half of the walk two years before using tarps as shelter and while I love camping this way I found some aspects a bit wearing by the end of it. At 151cm and slight build weight was also a major consideration.\n\nThe DW was perfect- it's light, set's up/ breaks down quickly- much needed after a long hard hike. Unfortunately this meant I made the afternoon tea a lot as the others took at least 30 minutes longer to get their tarp/mosquito net/ ground sheet up. It has a lot more room then you think at first, once you get the knack of adjusting the ground sheet. We had every type of weather, including a set up in heavy rain, followed by a windy torrential night and the DW was by far the driest place to be. The ventilation system works really well, although the local wildlife did figure it out- possums have no fear!\n\nI know it has snow loading so I am looking at a hike in Tasmania or the high country next to give that a go.\n\nThanks for a great product- it lived up to all expectations and I couldn't be happier.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nNicole Coote\n\n​Hi there,\n\nI've had my TarpTent StratoSpire 2 for about four years now, and just got back from another excursion made more satisfying by this excellent piece of gear, and so I wanted to drop a line and say thanks.\n\nThis recent trip was a 60-mile, 6-night outing on the Pecos River in desert west Texas. There were 13 people in our party, in eight canoes and kayaks. We had heavy winds, heavy rain, and lightning storms our first three nights out, and despite my having to employ creative guyline tie-offs to creosote bushes, mesquite roots, rock fissures, small boulders and ice-laden coolers (the primitive campsites along the Pecos are for the most part flat, soil-less, limestone shelfs) the tent performed beautifully. It even managed to stay upright and dry in 50 mph gusts that snapped the poles on my buddy's REI Half-Dome our first night on the river.\n\nI've attached some recent pics of the tent: three from a solo canoe trip in October 2015 on the Cumberland River in Kentucky, where I live, and four from the Pecos River trip in May 2016. Feel free to use any of these photos in the Gallery on your website, and feel free as well to use any or all of this email as a Testimonial.\n\nI've owned and used a good number of tents over the years, and this one has consistently been the most satisfying to use. It's just a really well-engineered product. If I ever manage to wear it out, my next tent will certainly be another TarpTent.\n\nThanks,\n\nBrad Tyer\n\n​Everyone at Tarptent,\n\nI am extremely pleased with the repair of my Double Rainbow. Cheap, fast and well done, I cant ask for more. Thanks for such great customer service. I would buy another Tarptent, but with repairs like this one, I will never have too.\n\n-Andrew\n\nHenry and the Tarptent team,\n\nWe used the Double Moment on our thru hike of the PCT last summer (2015). We had it mailed to Kennedy Meadows and happily carried it with us until the Canadian border. This shelter kept us dry, ventilated, and comfortable during hail, snow, dumping rain, and heavy wind. We even set it up during a major thunderstorm in the High Sierra and were impressed that the interior was dry when we climbed inside. We really appreciated the peace of mind brought to us by the D.M.'s clever design and quick setup. The tent is still in great shape and will accompany us on many future adventures. Thank you for making such a well-designed, reliable piece of gear.\n\nWe've attached a couple of photos of the tent at Guitar Lake (below Mt. Whitney) and Aloha Lake in the Desolation Wilderness.\n\nAmy from Michigan & Fabien from France\n\nHi TarpTent team :-)\n\nI'm sending you a picture of my Rainbow in the wild, it was an early & frosty morning in Gironde, France.\n\nI'm actually kicking the first Europe tour by footbike, solo and in autonomy, and have developed tight bonds with my mono wall shelter, along the 5000km we have ran so far together :-)\n\nAfter descending France and Spain, I'm now heading towards Italy, and the Balkans, then I'll be heading up to Finland and Norway. Hope the Rainbow keeps shining!\n\nCheers, aka La Trottineuse\n\nUsed our Cloudburst3 for a 5 day trip in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Awesome tent!\n\nBrian R\n\n​Hi Henry,\n\nJust a quick email to say how well our Stratospire 2 worked on our TGO challenge over the last couple of weeks.\n\nMy girlfriend and I used it for many consecutive wild camping nights including a high camp on the Cairngorm plateau! Genius design Henry, it worked a treat.\n\nHere it is on a lovely but remote camp half way through.\n\nAll the best\n\nAllan Land\n\nHi Henry,\n\nI've just returned to NZ after a month on the road in Canada with that DW Moment. It arrived in Vancouver in plenty of time, thanks.\n\nThe tent was great. Definitely met or exceeded my expectations. I was always a bit reluctant, given that I've grown up a few blocks from the old Macpac factory, but really this tent was in a different league to the \"Macpac sololite\", in terms of ventilation, geometry, and ease of setup, despite their visual similarities. At 6' 3\" it was a fraction small for me, but then I realise you noted that on your website. It was a compromise I made knowingly in the name of weight saving. I would have got the Double Moment if I didn't already have a Macpac Mineret. And the colour is perfect. I apologize for needlessly fussing about that, you must have thought I was nuts. For some reason it comes across as being completely grey on my computer screen, when in fact it was almost exactly the kind of green/grey I would have wanted. Not sure what can be done about that except maybe add a description or a colour code on the website. Anyway, thanks for a great tent. It is on its way to Tibet shortly.\n\nRegards\n\nOlly Powell\n\nDear Tarptent\n\nI and four friends just returned from a winter hike in North Carolina on the Art Loeb Trail. Our plan was to hike the entire 30 miles of the trail but a sudden unexpected (not forecasted) winter storm caused us to bail out early. I carried my Rainbow that I've owned for about a year and a half and my friend Patrick was carrying his just purchased Rainbow on it's maiden voyage.\n\nDay one was cold but no problems. We woke on day two to heavy overcast skies and snow mixed with sleet. We hit the trail and after about an hour the storm moved in with a vengeance. 40-50 mph winds pounding us with horizontal rain and sleet. This along a 6,000 ft ridge top trail. We decided to make camp mid afternoon on the back side of a ridge to try and get out of the direct windblast in a small grove of trees, the only place we could see in the fog and wind. We pitched our tents and hunkered down inside them for the next 17 hours until the storm had passed. At first the wind was slamming the side of my tent so hard it would buckle and hit me in the face if I was sitting up. I decided to get back out in the storm and tie the tent to the tree beside me which solved the problem. Other than having to tie it off to a tree the Rainbow performed flawlessly in the most extreme conditions I've ever experienced in a tent. It never leaked, the rain/sleet/snow did not come in under the tarp which I was concerned about but it was never an issue.\n\nPatrick was also impressed with how durable and how well his Rainbow performed. In those conditions you need equipment that will take a beating, because, in this case our lives depended on it.\n\nThanks for a great product,\n\nCharles Hill\n\nGrayson, GA\n\nJust ordered a cloud 3 tent from your website. I did an online search for USA made tents and you guys came up. Looking forward to dragging this thing all over Montana and beyond. I can't wait to get it. Thanks for keeping the work here in the USA. I'm glad to support your company.\n\nMiles M.\n\nTaking my Protrail from Denver to Salida on the CT next month!\n\nAlex B.\n\nI absolutely love my ultralight Tarptent, great American quality at a great price. If you're in the market for a tent, look no more. My 1 person Rainbow Tarptent has plenty of room for me at 6'4\" 270 no problem, and if need be a 2nd person is doable. Thank you Tarptent for the wonderful product, and I thank you for being American made keep up the great work...\n\nBrian P.\n\nI just wanted to thank Henry at Tarptent. I needed a tweak to my double rainbow setup and he made it happen. It is incredible to be able to talk to a live person that gets the trail culture. Excellent customer service! I will shout Tarptent from the mountain tops!\n\nErin W.\n\nExploring Pisgah National Forest with my Notch. Great trip, great tent. Loved the dual vestibules and the ventilation kept me from having any condensation problems in the 20 degree weather.\n\nMichael S\n\nLove my new Moment DW!\n\nWhile having backpacked with others for years, I am new to going solo and also trying to go as light as the often drizzly Pacific Northwest allows. Another woman I know recommended the Moment DW. After comparative research, this tent had more to offer than all other one person similar style tents and I am even more impressed after an inaugural trip for my 54th birthday. I'm 5'3\" and had ample headroom sitting up and more floor space than I really needed (not complaining at all)! Love the way that either end of the tent can be used as the head or foot depending on terrain with doors opening in opposite directions (brilliant!). The vestibules are also very roomy (without even adjusting inward for even more room-as shown in the video). Everything is just perfect with the tent, and I so appreciate your team having it seam-sealed and delivered in record time for my birthday.\n\nThank you so much!\n\nSylvia McKenzie\n\nReally enjoy using the StratoSpire II. Easy set up and lots of room! Not too heavy for miles of backpacking either!\n\nJeremiah M.\n\nGot a Double Rainbow a couple years ago. Have used it from Rocky Mountain National Park to the Appalachian Trail... One word: Awesome!\n\nJeff & Wendy S.\n\nMy boyfriend and I bought the StratoSpire 2 for our hike on the AT, It worked out amazingly and we stayed dry. Thought I would share this picture with you, I thought it turned out awesome! Thank you so much for making these tents! They are well worth the price!\n\nLiza W.\n\nHenry Shires & Crew,\n\nI completed my thru hike of the AT last year (2014) and am finally getting around to letting you know how much I loved my Notch. I squeezed it into tiny openings in thick pines, set it up in high winds and driving winds and it never let me down once. At one point I camped on top of a mountain in New Hampshire and woke to find it was pouring down rain, the worst storm I saw on the trail. Turns out I was set up in a depression and my tent was sitting in about 2 inches of water. The bottom of my Notch did not let one drop of water through and I woke up warm and dry in the morning. I've recommended the Stratospire 2 to some friends of mine who are planning an ADT through hike because I know it will be well made and a great tent.\n\nThank you for the peace of mind I got from having such a reliable sturdy tent on trail.\n\nDrew \"Mr. Jingles\" Harlacher\n\nI wanted to say we are very impressed with the Stratospire 2. Very spacious, solid, and half the weight of our North Face tent. Thank you for answering our questions and can't wait to put miles behind us!!!\n\nJeremy M.\n\nDear people at Tarptent,\n\nLove your product.\n\nThe Double Rainbow proved well in the Patagonian mountains. Please find a picture attached, maybe for the website gallery, you're free to use it.\n\nlocation: Mount Tronador, ascent from Argentina\n\nBR, Jorrit\n\nDear Henry & Tarptent-Team,\n\nI want to thank you for the awesome tent you developed. After 3 weeks of rain, wind, and sometime both in stormy conditions, my Moment DW is still in perfect shape.\n\nI think I have finally found a companion for the next few years.\n\nSadly my trip to Iceland ends soon but I'm looking forward to the next trip with the Moment DW.\n\nGreeting from Iceland,\n\nValerian\n\nI have just come back from a quick overnighter and this is now the third time that I have used your tent (a ).\n\nI was very sceptical about using a single walled tent in good ole New Zealand but I can report to you that I have not had any issue with condensation at all...of course there was some, funnily enough on the first and second days (late January).\n\nBut last night the inside of the tent was almost completely dry!! I had the foot end \"wings\" opened all night and had a high pitch with the double trekking pole set up I am using.\n\nI just love this tent, it is super light, I have (as per your suggestion) added extra seam sealing to the floor to stop slipping, and it works. I have added tie outs to the side panels and 4 extra light weight stakes. All of this does add a little bit of extra weight but still it is well under 1kg. the Tent is fantastic Henry and I am very pleased with my purchase and will likely buy more of your products in the future.\n\nPlease don't stop with your R&D and keep bringing out more variety and even more lighter/cooler/user friendly/innovative tents in the future.\n\nCheers\n\nJames Talbot\n\nThanks for a great product!\n\nI wanted to write in and let you know how much I enjoy my Stratospire 2 tent. I've used it a dozen times in various weather and can't rave enough about the durability, quality, and build. I didn't opt to buy the solid interior along with the mesh as I wasn't sure how it would fair in cold/snow conditions. However, now that I've tested it I will definitely be purchasing the solid interior for cold weather.\n\nThanks for a great product!\n\n-Kevin\n\nHere are few shots of the Double Rainbow in action at 12,600 ft on Lake Fork Peak in the Wheeler Wilderness, New Mexico. The lamb wouldn't leave the tent alone! She liked to bite and pull the arch pole and the bottom hem of the vestibule :)\n\nBesides the abuse the little miss dished out, the tent also withstood four days and nights of high winds and heavy thunderstorms of rain and hail...absolutely no problems! Thanks for making a superb product, and please enjoy the photos\n\nYour friend,\n\nAdam Simms\n\nSanta Barbara, CA\n\nHello,\n\nRecently I bought a Stratospire 1 tent for hiking the Israel trail.\n\nI used it on two nights, and it functioned wonderfully. During one of the nights I had 50 km/h wind, in a very exposed place, and the tent stood wonderfully, even after one of the stakes pulled out.\n\nI am sending several pictures for your Gallery. Although the scenery is less inspiring then in some of the pictures there, I think I have not seen pictures from the holy land there. The first two were taken on Thirsty Snake Ascent on the Israel trail in the Negev region. The second two were taken at the top of the Scorpions ascent, again, on the Israel trail.\n\nThanks,\n\nGreat tent, I expect to use it far more,\n\nYitzhak Cohen, Gedera, Israel\n\nDear Tarptent,\n\nI just took the Scarp 1 on a ski tour of the Spearhead Traverse in the Whistler Backcomb area. We had 60 mph winds and snow and the tent performed like a 4 season champ! Thank you for the great design.\n\nI have included a couple of photos with the hope that you might put them in your photo gallery to demonstrate this. Enjoy!\n\nsincerely yours,\n\nChristopher Ward\n\nTualatin, Oregon\n\nHenry and Company,\n\nJust wanted to let you know how pleased I am with the Moment DW. I have very little backpacking experience but I needed a lightweight tent for a bike tour. I just completed a 5 day trip from coastal CT to Quebec. The tent fit perfectly on a rear rack, set up in the dark in minutes, kept the mosquitos at bay and kept me dry in 2 windy squalls- what more do you need. I also learned, with the help of your video how to waterproof seams. I applied this handy technique to all of my bike bags as well.\n\nThanks for a good product,\n\nKen Larsen\n\nHenry and team,\n\nI bought a Double Rainbow earlier this year and have used it in all conditions from Southern California desert to heavy snow. It worked great in each case. The design and workmanship is great in all respects and I wanted to thank all of you for producing an excellent product that is as good in the execution as it is in concept. Because of the good experience I have had with the Double Rainbow I just sent in an order for a Hogback for trips with more people, some of whom like to sleep in the famed \"starfish\" position. Attached are a couple of pictures of my Double Rainbow on a snow camping trip.\n\nCraig Reynolds\n\nJust got back from 3 nights in the Ishi Wilderness where we had the chance to test out the Stratospire 2 in wind, rain, hail, and snow. It was amazing! Worked so well I think my friend who already owns the Hogback is going to get the Stratospire also. If you are interested in any photos of the tent in the field let me know what size and I can email them to you.\n\nThanks again from a happy customer,\n\nKevin English\n\nDuring my planning for a back country hiking trip in the Weminuche Wilderness in Colorado. I wanted to get my base pack under 10 pounds. Being in my mid-fifties and planning a hike of over 60 miles in very rough terrain and over 15,000 feet of climbing in under 6 days I needed all the help I could get.\n\nThe addition of the Tarptent Notch to my back cut in half the weight of my old tent and the Notch saved plenty of space in my ultra-lite pack.\n\nThe Notch is the perfect combination of ultra light weight, easy of setup and tear down. The Notch has all the necessities a hiker needs for three season backpacking.\n\nThanks for a great tent.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCharlie Bise\n\nHi Guys\n\nJust a quick note to let you know how happy I am with my Stratospire 1.\n\nHere a couple of pics you may like to see of it pitched in a few different locations, even a tent platform on the Overland Track in Tasmania Australia.\n\nRegards\n\nDanny G\n\nHey everyone at Tarptent!\n\nI just wanted to thank you guys for the awesome work on the Double Rainbow and getting it to me so quickly. It performed spectacularly when we camped out at Granite Pass in the North Cascades in Washington this past weekend (08/10/2013-08/11/2013). The thunderstorms were directly on top of us and we got slammed with a downpour of rain and lots of lightening (scary! 30+ strikes a minute at times... this was the storm that caused 8 rock/mudslides on SR 20, the road we took to get there and needed to take to get home... had to take a 7.5hr detour instead of 2.5hr normal). The Double Rainbow was more than up for the challenge of the storm and shrugged off the rain nicely. The tent is palatial, especially for us (both of us are only 5'6\" tall) and I love how easy it is to pitch.\n\nAs I mentioned, I planned this trip to propose to my girlfriend during the meteor shower, and although we didn't see any shooting stars, we were treated to an intense lightning show all night. Thanks for helping make this possible by getting such a high quality tent out to us so quickly! I've attached a couple of pictures of the Double Rainbow in use, and it would be awesome to see it in your gallery!\n\nSincerely,\n\nAndy Nam\n\np.s. SHE SAID YES!!! :o)\n\nHaving bought a used Scarp 1 ages ago I finally got a chance to use it in anger this weekend at Allt Sheicheachan, near Blair Atholl. To say i LOVE this tent is an understatement! Wish I'd bought one years ago!\n\nStuart F.\n\nThe Stratospire 1 stood strong in a stiff wind and rain in the Peak District National Park, England.\n\nElton O\n\nJust finished up Big Bend National Park outer mountain loop with the StratoSpire 2. Loved the tent and was warm every night. Kept dry during a short rain. Great tent and very well built. I had lots of room for storage under the two vestibules. Thanks Tarptent!\n\nMatthew H.\n\nJust some backyard camping after seam sealing my new Protrail. Looking forward to using this tent a lot more come June and the AT!\n\nJeffrey O.\n\nHi! We recently walked at Wilson's Promontory, Mt Stirling and the Great Ocean Walk - all in Victoria, Australia. We took along the Stratospire which is a fabulous tent - very roomy for two people and gear in the tent with heaps of space in the vestibules for packs, boots, poles etc. I haven't hiked for a long time so was really impressed with the comfort and spaciousness of this home-away-from-home. The weather in the various places was overcast, cloudy, cold, sunny, raining, by the ocean, in the mountains and on ocean cliffs. At Johanna Beach on the Great Ocean Walk (106 klms from Apollo Bay to the Twelve Apostles) there was steady rain at night but inside we remained nice and dry because we kept the tent ventilated. This is really easy with the two openings/vestibules. All you have to do is camp in an appropriate site, identify where the weather is coming from and open the other side of the tent. Just watch the video by Geolyn and this will be confirmed. Also, I have to admit I walk with an experienced 4 season walker and Tarptent expert! This picture is of the tent at Devil's Kitchen on the last night of the Great Ocean Walk.\n\nAnn D.\n\nI took my new ProTrail to Nevada's Ruby Mountains for a four day grouse hunt... No rain or snow, but some really high winds at night. Super comfortable!\n\nJoe R.\n\nI just wanted to thank Henry at Tarptent. I needed a tweak to my double rainbow setup and he made it happen. It is incredible to be able to talk to a live person that gets the trail culture. Excellent customer service!\n\nI will shout Tarptent from the mountain tops!\n\nErin W.\n\nOwn the Stratospire2 and protrail and love them\n\nEdmarla R.\n\nOur ProTrails are at work in the North Cascades with the boy scouts!\n\nStephen S.\n\nThe pictures do not do mother nature justice – it was cold, wet, windy (abt 50 mph), hail, sleet, lightning – had it all. Truthfully it was exactly the reason why I decided on the roomy – comfy Cloudburs – so I could stay comfortable if the weather went South (North really). It was the best tent for the occasion by far.\n\nAlex W.\n\njust ordered a cloud 3 tent from your website. I did an online search for USA made tents and you guys came up. Looking forward to dragging this thing all over Montana and beyond. I can't wait to get it. Thanks for keeping the work here in the USA. I'm glad to support your company.\n\nMiles M.\n\nMade our first bivouac in the French Pyrenees with our two kids and the Hogback. Very light and very spacious. Thanks for making it!\n\nEmmanuel O.\n\nDear Tarptent team,\n\nI've never been much of a camper or tent user; not because I didn't want to, simply the opportunity never really presented itself. Now, with my self-sustaining bicycle fundraiser through Europe, I am camping a lot, and loving it.\n\nYour double-rainbow tent, my first tent ever, is my home away from home during this 10 week-long cycling adventure. It was a gift from my boyfriend in the USA, sent to me while I was in Peru earlier this year (and unfortunately subject to extra taxes there, but that's a seperate story!).\n\nI simply wanted to thank you for creating this exceptional product. It's light weight, easy to set up and packs perfectly with the rest of my bike gear. It is my continued pleasure to use it during this trip!\n\nAlso, inspired one morning (this was while camping in Southern France a few weeks back) by a curious ladybug, I snapped a few shots featuring the bug and my double-rainbow. I thought you might enjoy seeing these photos :)\n\nWith kind regards from Hungary,\n\nKasia Szewczyk\n\nI'm cycling through Europe for World Literacy Canada this summer! Read more at: www.ridetoread.wordpress.com\n\nSent with a smile from my iPhone\n\nI love your tents! I have a family of five (three small ones), and the hogback is the only one I've seen that could meet our needs and still be lightweight for transport.\n\nYucca P.\n\nI have the Hogback, great for backpacking with little ones. I have also had 4 grown men in it, about my size (6'3\" 200lbs) and it sleeps cozy, but with enough room. Vestibule room can be a little challenging, with the 4 packs if they need to stay out of the weather. Overall great buy, haven't heard of another tent of the same size with same or less weight. My go to tent for family or friends backpacking trips.\n\nGarrett T.\n\nTop notch customer service. I've talked to Henry several times on the phone, before, during, and after my AT thru-hike. He's been nothing but supportive, and helpful, and truly stands by his product. My Rainbow held up great on the AT, and though it suffered some damages, Tarptent fixed them for me.\n\nAnthony O.\n\nLoving the Double Rainbow\n\nAmber S.\n\nI just spent two weeks thru-hiking the JMT with the Double Rainbow and absolutely loved it. It's a great lightweight tent that offers a ton of flexibility and room to live.\n\nDrew R.\n\nJust came back from a 3 week backpacking trip in Hawaii. The Rainshadow 2 performed beautifuly!\n\nHere's a pic of it in Waimanu valley. Thanks again for the great bug-free ultralight shelter!\n\nDanny D.\n\nFirst adventure out in my new Rainshadow 2. Loved the tent and Mt. Hood.\n\nCaryn E.\n\nHere is a picture I took on a bike tour across Alaska in 2013. Henry set me up with a Double Rainbow and carbon fiber pole. It worked great! Atigun River and the Brooks Range in the background on the tundra. Thanks for great American made product.\n\nJeff Frye\n\nThank you for helping me to wash my tent. Having thoroughly gone over my tent, I’d like to say that your attention to detail on the Double Moment is superb! You’ve clearly done your homework, and then some. During our hike on Mt Adams, my girlfriend, Lisa, and I celebrated her 40th birthday. She stated that she thinks that I’m a genius for thoroughly researching tents, and deciding on a Tarptent. I did, of course, let her know who the real genius is!\n\nHere are a few pics of the area. I’ll be sure to send more from our future travels.\n\nThank you for the amazing tent, and all of your help!\n\nTim\n\n2015 AT thru with the ProTrail. Fantastic, even in the harshest weather.\n\nBombproof, super fast set up, and spacious (and I'm 6'3\"). You can't go wrong.\n\nGrant L.\n\nHello Tarptent,\n\nThought I'd send this image as the location is quite different to anything else in your gallery.\n\nRuth and I are really pleased with the StratoSpire 2. So far it has performed in the outback and high country snowstorms.\n\nThis is off track walking in Browns Creek gorge, Southern Grampians National Park, Victoria, Australia.\n\nThe 2 person Moment DW looks great.\n\nAll the best\n\nMichael Hampton\n\nLove my ProTrail!!!\n\nTodd B.\n\nHowdy.\n\nLast fall I bought a Moment DW and promptly took it on a bikepacking trip into the Canadian Flathead.\n\nWe had 7 days of rain and snow and I wore my shell pants and jacket the entire time. We couldn't have picked a worse weather window. Oh well, at least we finished the trip.\n\nThe Moment DW was rad. It rained every single night, twice the rain was a deluge of Old Testament proportions. I stayed dry. So did my down bag and mattress. The vents worked. It was a little cramped as I am a rather large human but I didn't buy the tent to hang out in, I bought it to keep me sheltered and that is exactly what it did.\n\nThanks for making a well-designed, affordable product that works as advertised. I'm looking forward to using this thing in warmer weather to keep the bugs off.\n\nAgain, thanks.\n\nBiggermig\n\nHello Tarptent crew!\n\nI just wanted to sent you guys a picture of my tent on my last trip to Isle Royale!\n\nI really love the tent: setup and tear down are almost pleasurable and you have great space for packs in the vestibules. Great design. I want to pick up one of your 4 person tents at some point but I have to figure out how to justify it to my wife...\n\nKeep up the great work!\n\nNick Brunette\n\nI just completed a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail and I used a Tarptent Contrail the whole time. I didn't have any backpacking experience before starting the trail, so I was heavily reliant on internet reviews and recommendations.\n\nI chose the Contrail because of all the recommendations I read and it performed great. I was a little skeptical at first about the durability and whether it would last the whole trip as it was so light. My doubts were unfounded. It is so well-made and it survived a variety of conditions. I also found it to be highly versatile and I could always make it work in less-than-ideal tent spots. The bathtub design always kept the water out. I loved the fact that the bug netting kept all the mosquitos out at night. I could hear them buzzing, but they weren't getting at my blood.\n\nSo, just wanted to say thank you for making such a great product. I couldn't have picked a better shelter for the last five months.\n\nErich \"Reboot\" Renken\n\nAT Thru-hiker GA->MA, 2013\n\nHenry and Crew,\n\nMany thanks for a GREAT tent. I value the experience and thought you have put into your products.\n\nI now have your Single Rainbow, \"trading up\" my old NorthFace Tadpole. The Rainbow is awesome.\n\nPhoto below of the Rainbow at 10,000 on Mauna Loa looking to 14,000' Mauna Kea two days ago on July 9. … Next week off to the JMT and PCT.\n\nAloha,\n\nLee\n\nNorth Kohala, Hawaii\n\nMy buddy and I recently came up with a cool way to pitch two notch tents on a single wood platform. This was on the AT in the White Mountains of NH. Thought you might enjoy - great tents!!\n\nKevin Webb\n\nThanks for a great tent!\n\nI've had my Double Rainbow several years, and some of my friends have bought them after seeing mine. I just want to share a couple of photos from the Benton Mackaye Trail last week, featuring 4 Double Rainbows. They were spread so far apart I couldn't get all in one photo.\n\nJakebrake, aka Bill Strickland\n\nDear Henry and the Tarptent Team,\n\nI just wanted to say THANK YOU! for the great tents you make.\n\nI use the Scarp II now for several years, but last months we were really putting it to its limits. During a ski mountaineering tour, we decided to leave some equipment behind on the Aletsch glacier (Switzerland) to spend some nights in a hut and to have less weight in the bags. After three days with heavy winds and quite a lot of snow, we worried if we could find the tent again and whether it was still intact, and we have been positively surprised.\n\nI was really proud of my little tent and want to share a photo.\n\nCheers,\n\nTimo\n\nI just got back from a Philmont Trek during which I used my Tarptent Notch.\n\nI love this tent! I received a lot of compliments on the tent from other scouters during the trek. The attached photo is of my Notch at sunrise at Clayton Lake State Park, New Mexico .\n\nThanks again for a great product,\n\nTom Matches\n\nFirst night out in my Tarptent Notch, appropriately at High Cup Nick in the North Pennines.\n\nLoads of headroom, lightweight, airy, robust, pitched in two minutes. What's not to like ? It weathered a storm and sheep nibbling at the guys too (bet they don't have the latter in Nevada where it's made !)\n\nStan A.\n\nHello,\n\nI ordered a Hogback tent from you in the spring, and have had a couple adventures in the Rockies with it. Also spent a couple weekends out camping near Fort McMurray, and camped at a huge outdoor rock festival outside of Edmonton.\n\nJust to let you know that I am extremely pleased with this tent. What was odd is that considering I live in a very remote location in Northern Alberta the tent arrived less than a week after you shipped it. That is unusually fast for Canada Post, I was actually shocked.\n\nI went on two backpacking trips with the Hogback as our shelter. First trip was the Skyline Trail near Jasper, AB and the second one was on the historic Berg Lake Trail around Mount Robson, BC (Wow is the only way to describe that trail).\n\nI noticed a big weight savings from our previous tent (a Marmot limelight 3p – 7lbs) not to mention it packed down into a tiny bundle. We ran into heavy rains and strong winds with no problems whatsoever.\n\nThe optional cross pole worked great, it helped keep the tent rigid in even the biggest gusts.\n\nIt was my first time ever seam-sealing a tent, but I guess I did a good enough job as on both treks nothing inside the tent even got damp. Even though we needed a trench at one campground to divert water away from running directly under the tent from poorly located tent pads, we stayed dry and warm inside the tent.\n\nOne thing that I really enjoyed about the tent was that in high winds, the fabric came close enough to the ground that it wouldn't draw heat out and allow moisture to blow in from the outside. The old Marmot Limelight was very 'airy' with a couple of spots where the wind would easily sail right through bringing cold rain with it.\n\nSetup is a breeze, and though I haven't tried to go for your 2-minute time I could get it up fast in a storm without any drama. The carbon fiber posts in the corners are a brilliant design. We slept three of us on the second trip in the Rockies to Mount Robson plus our gear. It was a little squishy as my tentmates were a good bit bigger than me, so we put our bags under a siltarp for the rest of the trip. That made the tent very roomy for three.\n\nNeedless to say I haven't felt more confident about my choice of tent. Thanks for making an outstanding product. Here's a shot of the tent set up above Berg Lake.\n\nThanks again!\n\nCheers,\n\nChris Watton\n\nDear Tarptent,\n\nThanks for an amazing product. I completed my 2013 NoBo thru hike August 19.\n\nI started February 24 thus obviously I hiked in a great deal of bad weather. I spent very few nights in shelters preferring to stay warm and cozy in my Notch which I nicknamed \"The Spa.\" I joked with fellow hikers that when I returned home my family may not appreciate my new found love of sleeping in my tent.\n\nAfter many months I found I slept even better in my tent in the rain than any hotel room bed or hostel. I perfected my stealth camping techniques loving the solitude of my tent.\n\nLook forward to using this same tent on the PCT next year. I bought my son the exact same tent and will look at purchasing a two man when my wife and I hike together.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSamson\n\nBill Wasser\n\nMadison, MS\n\nWanted to first say thanks for the great equipment. Secondly, I have a picture of my Notch at Rae Lakes I took on a JMT thru back in 2012. If you want to use it you're more than welcome to do so. If not, I thought you might like to see some of your gear in action.\n\nI hope to be taking it to Patagonia next February and it will certainly see some time in Colorado this summer!\n\nThanks again\n\nGreg Padgett\n\nI just finished thru hiking the PCT using your Sublite from Kennedy Meadows to Canada. What a wonderful tent! The tent was easy to put-up and was very stable in winds. It kept me dry and had very little condensation. I love this tent!\n\nTed Mason (Happy & Big Wuss)\n\nThank you so much for the great service and the awesome product! I've been out and about all summer, and my Double Rainbow has been a cozy home away from home. I've attached a photo of its most scenic resting spot of the summer, at Sahale Glacier in North Cascades National Park.\n\nI was very glad to have the ability to pitch it free standing on that slab of rock!\n\nZach H.\n\nI wanted to thank you for making a wonderful product that I called \"home\" for six months on the Appalachian Trail. The spacious and amazingly lightweight Contrail was my private mansion. Not only was I comfortable inside my tent, but all my stuff fit inside as well. When my husband visited me on the trail, we were able to fit both of us in on rainy nights in Maryland.\n\nI have used my tent for section hikes in the past and wondered if it would stand up to the rigors of a thru hike. It did! From soft meadows and bare dirt in GA to a fall off of Dragon's Tooth in VA to thunderstorms and hail in Maine, my tent never wore out. And I didn't even use a footprint to spare the flooring.\n\nWhen I had a question about my tent, you answered promptly and have given me excellent advice (like how to wash poison ivy oils off the inside of my tent). Thank you, Mr. Shires, for a great product and for your personal service!\n\nWarmly,\n\nSlow n' Steady/ Janet Steinert\n\nI love my Scarp1's, often think about something else, but remember, I own the best already. In my opinion, cannot be beat.\n\nBobby M.\n\nLeaving for southern France in 10 days. My Cloudburst 3 is always with me ;-)\n\nHenri N.\n\nGood morning!\n\nI am writing to let you know that I completed my approximately 500-mile hike of the A.T., from Springer Mountain, Georgia, to Damascus, Virginia, earlier this week--arriving in Damascus on June 15--one day ahead of schedule and one day before my 65th birthday. I celebrated with a huge veggie burger, a side order of onion rings, and a super-sized Coca-Cola at the Blue Blaze Cafe before my wife joined me there.\n\nAs you may recall, I purchased the Notch tent from you several months ago. The tent performed essentially flawlessly throughout my six-week journey. The only issue I had was some mud splatter penetrating into the vestibules during heavy rains but this was quickly remedied by extending my poncho over any gear I had stored in the one vestibule and by applying my backpack rain cover over the pack stored in the other vestibule--no rain ever penetrated the interior bathtub floor of the tent.\n\nIt was quick to set up, quick to take down, and very light weight. Indeed, the only tent I saw that could compare was the Zpac two-person tent, which costs twice as much due to its cuben-fiber material and it was more cumbersome to set up.\n\nOne of the people I ended up hiking with for nearly 400 miles (\"Sandpiper\") also carried a Tarptent. She had the Rainbow (which was the other model I was considering) and she loved it. I do like the interior space of the Rainbow (or, even more, the Double Rainbow), but having two vestibules in the Notch versus the one in the Rainbow proved helpful at times.\n\nAnyway, many thanks to you and to your employees for making such a fine product(s).\n\nSincerely,\n\nDave Startzell (aka-\"Ghost\")\n\nDear Henry Shires and the Tarptent Staff,\n\nJust finished my thru-hike of the Pacific Crest Trail and wanted to express my appreciation for the quality of your tents.\n\nLeaving on my adventure I opted for the Double Rainbow because, despite owning several single person tents, my Double Rainbow was lighter and took less pack volume. Glad I did because the extra space came in handy when my girlfriend joined me on two separate week long visits.\n\nThe Double Rainbow held up well, was easy to setup even in high winds, and provided lots of room for a small weight. I had zero problems with the tent and only one small worn seam that needed sewing on the stuff sack. A much different experience than I had with a competitors tent on the Appalachian Trail in 2010.\n\nI am placing an order today for extra tent stacks to replace the ones that came with my girlfriends tent because; they too are strong, light and durable. Attached are a couple campsite photos from the PCT. Thanks for making such great products.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Klebes, AKA - PaPa Smurf (PCT2012, AT2010, LT2009)\n\nI want to thank you for sending the Notch so quickly.\n\nI have just returned from a five day backpack trip in the Southern Sierra and can't say enough about how well the tent served me. I have a background in precision machine work, and appreciate well designed, well built equipment.\n\nWe had high winds the first night and the tent was perfect. The addition of the two extra anchor points helped greatly. Moreover, as the trip unfolded, I kept noticing \"little\" things about the design of the Notch that made using the tent all the more wonderful. For example, using elastic material for the mesh tie-backs works brilliantly when it's the middle of the night, and an old fellow like me needs to exit the tent without cussing at it. I also appreciate the ease of setup; from out of the pack to ready to use in under five minutes every time.\n\nI look forward to many more trips with this tent.\n\nGratefully Yours,\n\nLarry Wylie\n\nBishop, CA\n\nSatisfied customer!\n\nFor three years now, I use a Scarp 1 to trek through the Scottish Highlands early spring. Of course it's well made, solid and functional, but above all: it's a home to me. It feels snug and safe inside in cold, windy or rainy weather.\n\nHere are two pictures, use em if you want to.\n\nYou can read reports of my trips here.\n\nCheers!\n\nKlaas\n\nHaarlem, Netherlands\n\nHenry,\n\nYou sold me a Squall 2 late last year for a trip we just took to the Lost Coast. We were fine the first two days of the trek and the last three it rained. Your tent held up and perfectly light for the 50 mile trip. Attached is a picture of us at Miller Flat.\n\nGreat stuff. Keep up the good work.\n\nSteve\n\nDear Henry,\n\nWe (me and my girlfriend) have purchased the Tarptent StratoSpire II late last year and unfortunately only used it twice so far (due to our busy schedules and very nasty weather that prevented us from doing overnight hiking trips).\n\nWe would like to share with you that we love the tent!!! The ease and consequent speed of pitching it, is just awesome. The space inside is enormous which comes in very handy in the wet mid-European climate.\n\nAs an architect, I would like to say, that I have never seen such an effective and at the same time very beautiful tent design.\n\nEverything I have researched about the Stratospire II before purchasing it held up to my very high expectations and in parts even surpassed it. The tent is very well made and despite its lightness, it is very robust. Even as it is labeled as a \"3 Season Tent\" (we have the inner net version), we have our used it during snow in about 20°F conditions here in the German Vulkaneifel and it performed stellar (apart from quite some condensation in the morning - our own fault, as we used snow to cover up the outer shell to the ground, resulting in not enough air circulation during the cold night).\n\nAs in any perfect design there is probably nothing to add or to take away to make this tent better. However, I just have one very little suggestion: I think it would be really great to add a two way zipper to the outer shell openings this should not add too much weight, but it will open a lot of additional ventilation possibilities for the user.\n\nThank you and everybody else at Tarptent very much for making such a great piece of \"American Engineering\" that enriches our outdoor experience here in Germany.\n\nBest,\n\nMark from Germany\n\nThis is not a glamor shot of my \"Notch\" near Manning Park Canada after serving me for 300+ nights on the Te Araroa and the Pacific Crest trail...It got frayed a little mainly by my stupidity but was still doing what it needed to do..Protect from Mosquitos and the weather..\n\nHeres the KICKER...Ordered exactly the same tarpetent as I'm convinced that it's a waste of my time to look for better for my style of hiking..During the ordering process mentioned about the old one being frayed plus a few burnholes etc..Tarptent suggested they have a look at it and they did...Arrived today completely refurbished and waterproofed at a minimal shipping and service charge....For sentimental value alone I would have kept his tarp but now it has a whole new life ahead..\n\nThanks Tarptent beyond KUDOOS...CDT....?????\n\nEdward I.\n\nThanks for the Amazing Tent\n\nTarptent,\n\nI recently purchased a Contrail, it arrived two days before I flew out to Seattle to spend 7 days in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in the Cascades.\n\nI'd like to say Thank you for making such a great tent. Some nights I had to pitch it on less-than-ideal terrain, which lead to my sleeping pad sliding a bit\n\nIt held up to two unexpected thunder storms, without sealed seams. My friend neglected to bring the rain fly for his tent and sprinted up to the Contrail during a storm; It can certainly accommodate two people in the rain without much of a problem.\n\nIt was a very tough, back-country, trip and having something as light as a bivy+tarp that I could sit up in was a blessing.\n\nGiven the weight and price point, I couldn't be happier.\n\nHere are a few pictures of the Contrail in action.\n\nGood work guys.\n\nRegards,\n\nBrian\n\nThank you (for the Notch)!\n\nI figured it out and have tested it pretty well on two trips now. The first trip was in high force winds with hard rain in unprotected tundra. Can't argue with any tent that keeps you dry in that!\n\nThe second was on a river trip with a friend.\n\nI'm much happier with this newer tent than my original squall, though I don't think I can just call it a glorified tarp anymore. It has sure grown up!\n\nThank you for producing great tent options. I included a picture of my Notch with my friends original Moment. Feel free to include it on your website if you would like.\n\nIris Hartshorn\n\nAnchorage, AK\n\nI wanted to send you all a picture of our Scarp 2 setup on Steamroller Pass overlooking the Clear Glacier.\n\nIt is far and away the best tent I have ever owned. It is lightning fast to set up, very comfortable and feels secure in the wind.\n\nUnfortunately it's a little crowded for two people and two 70lbs dogs (Before I was married I thought dogs could sleep in the vestibules. I have been corrected). So We'll be looking forward to that Hogback you're sending to Anchorage.\n\nThank you for making such a great product in the USA.\n\nRhett Paulson\n\nAnchorage, AK\n\nLife in a Tent\n\nThis might seem a bit fanatical, but I am really impressed with my TarpTent Double Rainbow. Like a turtle shell, this is the home we carry with us every where. It has served us well for nine months in nearly every country in Latin America, throughout the US and across Russia.\n\nThis page is dedicated to the Double Rainbow and a few of the many places that it has protected us.\n\nManny Dilks\n\nI received delivery of my Notch tent on Friday, March 8 and couldn't wait to try it out. A friend of mine and I went snowshoeing in Dolly Sods Wilderness, WV this past weekend. The tent was awesome and was exactly what I've been looking for in a lightweight tent.\n\nI only have one complaint, why couldn't you have made this tent years ago?\n\nI attached a photo from this past weekend.\n\nThank you for such a great tent,\n\nSteve Weber\n\nI completed the southern half of the AT this year and I gotta tell you that the Notch is the only piece of gear I had that I have no complaints about. I had it set up in some horrible conditions and it was absolutely bombproof.\n\nThanks for making such a great product.\n\nVince Vilcinskas\n\nMarshall, NC\n\nI just wanted to drop you a quick note letting you know that I just returned from my REI Adventure Trip along the Bechler River in Yellowstone.\n\nI appreciate you taking my call personally the Sunday before I left and answering all my questions!\n\nI cannot say enough how stellar the Rainbow Tarptent performed. From the speed and simplicity of setup to even more critical - dryness!\n\nWe had heavy Thunderstorms overnight Two of the 4 nights....and even though a few folks in our group got wet in their tents from REI (Half Domes I think) - I was Bone Dry the entire trip!\n\nI am currently airing my Rainbow out here at home relaxing from the trip and wanted to send you a personal Thank You - for making such a great Product. I shared my story about your Customer Service as other folks on the Trip inquired about the Tent.....\n\nAttached is a picture from one of the Camp Sites along the Bechler River, Yellowstone....Enjoy!\n\nBrian Dunn\n\nHarleysville, PA\n\nHi all,\n\nI wanted to write this email long ago, but then forgot about it... till now! :)\n\nI bought your Scarp 1 tent back in summer 2011, its main aim was to travel from Ireland to New-Zealand for a 5 to 10 day treck in end november/early december the same year. It took me a few times to succeed in setting it up, but once I got the trick, it was really easy to set it up! I used it a couple of times over there, and managed to set it up on my own with no trouble. It rained lightly one night, but most of the night though, and it kept me and my stuff dry, so I was quite happy (it also offered me a precious protections against the nasty kiwi sandflies!).\n\nIt's also been used for a 10 day trek accross Corsica (France) during summer.\n\nI love the space in there, it's meant to be a 1 person shelter, but two can squeeze in it, especially because there's enough room for keeping backpacks on both vestibules. It's light, takes no room, easy to set up once you know how it works, easy to fold up, and so spacious, plus it's obviously made from good materials!\n\nOne of the best buy I've done in years, I've already recommended you, and will keep doing so!\n\nHere are a few pictures from the trek in New-Zealand (Nelson Lakes NP, Southern Island). A big thank you to you all, and all the best for the future.\n\nAurelie, from France\n\nI received my Notch and have taken a weekend packing trip in the Georgia Appalachians near Neel's Gap.\n\nThe Notch was perfect. We set up in rain without getting the tent interior wet at all.\n\nYour design is incredibly efficient, smart, and accomodating for the tent resident once inside. There is generous space exactly where needed without wasted fabric. Movement within the tent is comfortable due to your design and the ability to snug up the rain fly from within the tent is great when a rain blew up again in the night. I was camping low at a creek side with temps in the high 30's and upon rizing I couldn't find a drop of condensation under the rain fly.\n\nExcellant ventilation options. I got the half solid /mesh wall interior and was glad I did. It simply gives me more options with extending the hiking season and avoiding cold damp draft blowing over my head and down bag at night. I struggled with the decision of all mesh or half mesh here in Georgia, but after using the Notch and comparing to my trips with another brand solo all mesh interior tent, I much prefer the half solid interior.\n\nThe setup of the tent is a breeze and the trekking pole support structure gives the Notch a sturdy feel.\n\nI had packers that passed my site, come over and ask what tent this was...I guess it makes quite an impression.\n\nI'd have to add that the 2 entrance doors and the 2 big vestibules gave me total access and adjustability to stow gear, batten down one side against a changing wind/rain direction while leaving the other side open. With a directonal rain, I can see the option of adjusting one trekking pole to a lower height and snugging the tarp to the ground while leaving the other pole at its normal setting to maintain good airflow.\n\nWow, the most adjustable, usable tent ever!\n\nThank you, Henry for such a smart, superlight, adjustable, and comfortable tent. I have backpacked all over the U.S including Alaska and in Canada for over 40 years and like many folks have experienced the evolution of gear and fabrics available for backpackers. I am 100% satisfied with my Notch and can't wait for my next trip in the mountains with it.\n\nHenry Hibbs\n\nWatkinsville, Georgia\n\nHi Henry,\n\nYou probably don't need another e-mail from me, but I just got back from my first hike with the StratoSpire 2. I used it on a new section (for me) of the AT from Springer Mtn to Woody Gap -- 21 miles. It was a dream to set up, to get in and out of with the two doors, and of course, the minimal weight was fantastic!\n\nI look forward to another trip with it in a few weeks.\n\nI am attaching a photo of my camp the first night.\n\nAll the best, Mike\n\nMichael L. Arnold\n\nAthens, Georgia\n\nDear Henry & Co.:\n\nI bought a used Tarptent Rainbow last year as part of an intensive effort to lower my base weight. I did a good deal of research and looked at various products - I came to the conclusion that your Tarptent products represented excellent value and was fortunate when one came available on a backpacking board. I'll note that it didn't escape me that when Tarptent products go up for sale as used gears, they are usually sold very quickly and for asking price.\n\nI used the tent on several backpacks last year and this year and have been thrilled with its performance, comfort, and (of course) light weight. But after this past week, I needed to write and thank you. I took a group of Scouts (my son's Patrol) up into the Cottonwood Lakes / New Army pass area in Inyo Natl Forest / Sequoia Natl Park last week. The weather was great for most of the trip, but our last night at Chicken Springs Lake (~11,300 ft) we were hit by a potent thunderstorm. For over an hour from about 9:30 to 10:30 we had (in addition to the requisite lightning and thunder) a torrential downpour accompanied by gusts of wind from the north, east, and then west. I'm fairly certain some of the gusts exceeded 40 mpg. They were strong enough to nearly collapse a couple of brand x tents that the boys had, and partially pulled up two of my tent stakes despite the fact that they had rocks on top of them.\n\nDespite all this, the only water that got into the Rainbow was some splashing along the back side (I didn't quite have it staked down low enough) and a very fine spray that got thru when a few particularly gargantuan raindrops hit the tent itself. Even with winds coming from east or west (the tent was lined up N-S since that was the prevailing wind direction earlier), I felt safe and secure, and stayed dry and warm. Thanks for making such a quality product at a reasonable price.\n\nMy best wishes to you and all those who help produce this great backpacking tent.\n\nDuane Bindschadler\n\nHello Henry\n\nI wanted to thank you for all your help and generocity with your time. Our family greatly appreciates it. We LOVE our Hogback. My husband used to be a buyer for Neil's Gap on the Appalachian Trail and is a bit hard to please (he's a total gear snob). He is also 6'4\" and that makes for a bit of a cramped tent for him. Add in a 220 lb Mastiff, a 40 lb Doberman-mutt, a 7 year old, and myself and you have a bit of an interesting situation to try and gear up for. As a long distance backpacking family, we are all thoroughly happy with what you guys have done.\n\nPictures:\n\nThe Hogback is at Yocum Ridge on the Timberline Trail around Mt. Hood in Oregon.\n\nThe motley crew which is our family is pictured after completing the Big Loop around the Three Sisters in central Oregon. The Mastiff was just a puppy then, you tent still fits him now that he is quite a bit bigger.\n\nLastly, thank you so much for helping us in our son's wish to break the PCT thru hiker record. When we started backpacking with The Barracuda (as he is known most everywhere now) at 4 we never thought it would turn into this, but we are proud to support him wherever he decides to walk. He is a bit determined and has firmly decided we are going to do it. A smaller TarpTent is our last piece of gear. If you would like to see our progress in this endeavor, we blog about our family at Endofordinary.blogspot.com.\n\nHappy Holidays!\n\nThanks Again,\n\nBrynn Dahlquist\n\nWhite Salmon, WA\n\nTook this photo of our Rainshadow 2 on the Vermillion Coast of France, thought we'd share.\n\nIt was too rocky to get any stakes into the ground, but it held up really well with just rocks. We have had this tent for three or so years now, have used it on multiple excursions in multiple countries and we love it!\n\nNext we're taking it to the North Rim and Long Range traverse in Gros Morne National Park of Newfoundland.\n\nThanks!\n\nAmanda Gresens and Matt Rogers\n\nNew Paltz, NY 12561\n\nThanks for spending phone time and getting our Cloudburst 3 with extra pole and footprint to us super fast!\n\nTwo Days of very foul weather put it to the test with cool temps and wind driven rains to drizzle at St. Regis Pond in the remote wilderness of the Adirondacks. No complaints- tent is as advertised and more-\n\nA pleasure to wait out the rain and stiff winds in the Cloudburst 3- could not be happier\n\nJohn Scholl\n\nGetting ready for a canyon trek and thought I would send a note on the sublite on the JMT.\n\nWe had a typical trip in July-Aug for 15 nights great hike. I added a few tie outs etc and always add guy lines for prayer flags and clothes.\n\nI used the sublite to hide from the bugs several nights and one record hot day for a high siesta where there were no trees.\n\nHad two severe storms, one below Muir Hut and one at Whitney. I used extra guy lines and was fine in both cases. A lightning hail storm blew up at Whitney and we had to scramble down to camp for the evening. At the lake below Whitney many other tents and poles were damaged in severe winds which was pushing the dome type tents down. I had wind blow rain in through the mesh, but used my polycro tarp and made a shield along the edge. This worked fairly well. I saw a rainbow there which also survived. Even made my soup inside with the jetboil since the storms went on for quite a while. (Normal routine is I reach out and fire up the jetboil outside for soup or coffee).\n\nHave now used for many trips in the Grand Canyon, Rockies and Great Lakes with good results. Zippers I think starting to get worn from all the grit although I wash after each trip.\n\nAnyhow, love the sublite. Only drawback is long fabric drying time when it gets really rainy. Also have a Double Rainbow which is great for two.\n\nJohn\n\nLebanon, OH\n\nHello Henry,\n\nI just wanted to thank you for prompt shipment of my Notch. I seam sealed it and took it on a trip to the Beartooths north-east of Yellowstone. The first night there was a major 6 hour downpour. I didn't get a drop on me! And it's amazingly light.\n\nFor a 61yo, that's a major factor in continuing to hike. I'm thrilled.\n\nRobert Miller\n\nChicago, IL\n\nVery pleased with the StratoSpire 2 tent!\n\n( photo at Parakai Campground north west of Auckland)\n\nThanks.\n\nSusan Jackson\n\nAukland, New Zealand\n\nGreetings from Hobart, Tasmania - where you will find some of the best wilderness walking in the world!\n\nI bought a Contrail from you last year. ( My mate bought a Moment in the same order.) The Contrail didn't get much use during our winter but I have just had the pleasure of taking it on a 10 day and then a 15 day summer hike. It was magnificent. Easy to put up. Heaps of space. Stood up to terribly strong winds that toppled trees in the vicinity. Kept me dry and was so easy to carry!\n\nCongratulations on a truly superb piece of gear. I'd recommend this tent to anyone. Keep up the great work.\n\nCheers\n\nAdam Croser\n\nHobart, Tasmania\n\nI just wanted to write in with praise for the Moment. I purchased it for my AT thruhike this year, and it served me well from Georgia to Maine. The inside of that tent quickly became my portable, collapsable home and place of solace, and I can't remember regretting my purchase even once along the entire way. At 6'3\" I was worried about feeling cramped in an ultralight single person tent, but I found the Moment so spacious and comfortable that I would march right past empty AT shelters in favor of even the most marginally acceptable tract of land to pitch. Of course, with the 2 leisurely minutes it takes to set up this tent (if even that), the Moment made setting up camp a breeze. I don't think it would be at all inaccurate to say that for every one night I was begrudgingly forced to spend in a shelter, I spent 10 happy inside your wonderful tent! After using it well over a hundred times, the tent pole finally broke in the 100-Mile Wilderness -- I was HEARTBROKEN at the thought of not being able to use my tent for my last few days on the trail, because the freedom, privacy and comfort it represented had gone such a long way towards helping to define what my thruhike experience had been all about. Luckily another hiker rescued with me a splint! What a shame it would have been not to have been able to set up next to Rainbow Lake and drift off to sleep by the sound of loons.\n\nThe Moment is the first tent I've ever purchased, and honestly, for my needs, I don't see a reason to buy something else anytime soon. I have a feeling it will be with me for a long time to come. Just need to replace that pole -- how can I go about doing that, incidentally?\n\n[Ed: Replacement poles can found under \"Extras\" in the webstore]\n\n- Chris \"Buck\" Wilhelm\n\nThis past May, I used my new Notch at Kings Canyon National Park, California. It performed flawlessly. It snowed on our group at Upper Paradise Valley on the Rae Lakes Loop. I've attached a picture of the snow covered Notch if you would like to include it in the gallery on your website. I noticed that you did not have a snow picture for the Notch. My friend, Billy Peacock, took the photo of my tent on May 26, 2012, and concurs with it being included in the gallery if you like.\n\nLast week I returned from a trek at Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico. My son and I shared a Double Rainbow. We have owned it a few years, and it has protected us in many less than ideal conditions: heavy rain, windy dust storms, and sleet. I noted two other DRs on the trail as well.\n\nThanks for making terrific gear!\n\nSincerely,\n\nRoyce Bowden\n\nStarkville, MS\n\nDuring our honeymoon in Hawaii, we used our Double Rainbow for the first time on a great backpacking trip on the Kalalau Trail on Kaua'i. It is a really tough hike and we were very happy that the Tarptent was easy to set up after the long journey in to the gorgeous beach where we camped. The tent was perfect for the two of us! We're really looking forward to using it again on backbacking trips closer to home on the East Coast this winter.\n\nWe're really happy we found your great product! Here is a picture of our camp spot under the waterfall at the end of the Kalalau Beach.\n\nAll the best!\n\nShane & Cheryl Rauch\n\nCharles Town, WV\n\nHey Henry, just wanted to say thanks for building such quality, affordable products over the years. Been really enjoying my Contrail. Never seems to fail me.\n\nHere's my campsite last October in Canyonlands...\n\nBest wishes this year for you,\n\nDan Briggs\n\nValrico, FL\n\nThe tent has been fantastic - Double Rainbow. I've attached a picture, in case you'd like to post it. It's at Truchas Lake in Santa Fe National Forest, NM.\n\nWe actually didn't camp there - breaks the rules, too close to the water, not that there was probably anyone else within 100 miles of us. But we carried the tent down there to just to take a nice picture with it. Thanks,\n\nTom Ingling\n\nDallas, TX\n\nThought you guy's might like these pic's of my Moment in the snow on new years weekend 01-01-2011. We had a tarp over both tents, when in the middle of the night it snowed about 18\" and collapsed one of my trekking poles, burring my friends tarp tent, and leaving the rest of the snow up against my Moment,but it held up solid like a rock. This was my 4 time in the snow with my Moment, this thing is a BOMBER TENT AND I LOVE IT ! ! !\n\nJack Elliott\n\nBakersfield, CA\n\nHenry & Co.,\n\nI want to thank you and your staff for developing such innovative and lightweight shelters. My wife and I recently purchased a Rainbow and we couldn't be happier.\n\nAfter testing it in Glacier National Park in shoulder season, we were warm and excited to enjoy a night in the wilderness made of both simplicity and elegance--in large part due to our TarpTent.\n\nBasically, all I want to say is this: \"Thank you.\" The Rainbow is an excellent, simple product that performs wonderfully.\n\nIt's funny; when I first started preparing for backpacking, I was always intrigued by ULers, but never thought I had the income to afford such a hiking profile. Now, you have made my push for lighter, more purposed gear an attainable goal. And on top of that, my wife is happy too! (I don't want to set up this binary where she is the comfort-oriented one and I am the Spartan--the truth is too complicated for those kind of oversimplifications.) Regardless, your Rainbow tent has performed beautifully, and I thank you for being involved in the lives of your customers and critics.\n\nSeriously, your presence on the BPL forums and your accessibility is a big part of what made me push for a TarpTent upgrade with my wife.\n\nI'm sorry that this is long-winded. All I meant to say is this: \"Thank you.\" Let us know if you are ever in Glacier or the Flathead. It's a beautiful place to be, and we are blessed beyond imagining to live here.\n\nJoin us if you can,\n\nClayton Mauritzen\n\nKalispell, MT\n\nDear Henry,\n\nLoving the Scarp II so far. Have been through spring snowfall in the Cascades and windy passes of the Coast Mountains of British Columbia and love the tent in every aspect--weight, sturdiness, ease of setup, the works. Regards,\n\nTerry Woodburn\n\nPortland, OR\n\nI love my Sublite. I used it on a two thousand mile, six week bicyle trip this summer on the northern tier bicycle route from the washington coast, through the washington cascades, idaho, montana, north dakota, minnesota, and to madison wisconsin, camping 95% if time and it was great. Lightweight and very durable. Super easy set up and tear down. It was a great investment. We got hit by some very hard, cold rain in the cascades. Through montana, we got rained on six or seven nights in a row and actually sat through three tornado warnings in North Dakota and Minnesota. The sublite was great. the only time I got wet was a couple of nights when I set up in a hurry in the rain and didnt stake it out correctly. The sublite was great though. Especially in the high winds and rains of the tornado warnings. It definitely kept me warm and dry. I'm taking in out again for a three week thousand mile solo trip. Cant wait. By the way, on my trip, we ran into quite a few other cyclists. Everyone was really impressed with the sublite, so hopefully you may be getting a few more orders. Thanks again.\n\nDave Orduno\n\nChico, CA\n\nHey Henry, I came back from hiking Longs Peak yesterday and wanted to let you know that this tent is solid.\n\nThe forecast was calling for 25-35mph steady winds with gusts near 60. I camped at the Boulderfield (12,400') and pitched the tent at the best angle to minimize the wind resistance...at that time. About 7:30pm, they wind direction shifted to the broad side of the tent, so I guyed out the wall to a large rock. Around 9pm the winds picked up and seemed to come at me from all directions, staying fierce all night. At times it almost felt like my sleeping pad was lifting off the ground, but the Rainbow held strong.\n\nThanks for building such a great product!\n\nRick Howell\n\nLittleton, CO\n\nI bought the Contrail from you last year and have now used it extensively including an 11 day trip along the North Boundary of Jasper National Park in Alberta. I wanted to take the time to write you and let you know how impressed I am. You have created a fantastic product that compares to any double wall free-standing tents I've used. It is also a third of the weight of any tent I have or have used. The 11 day trip where I used this tent had all sorts of weather including freezing nights (snow), rain, and wind. Me and my gear stayed dry and comfortable the entire time with loads of room left over inside. I'm also impressed with how small this tent folds up. I did find the tent a little difficult to setup at first but now have it down to under a minute. I still find it hard to setup on uneven terrain but have helped that by bringing along some extra rope and stakes to get creative in the setup. That being the only downside, this is one of the best backcountry tents I've ever used.\n\nWith that said, I'm also purchasing a Rainbow so that I can have a more free-standing tent in some of the tighter spots I camp at.\n\nI wanted to thank you and the team for such a wonderful product and will recommend this tent to anyone I know.\n\nDan Ducholke\n\nCalgary, Alberta, Canada\n\nFirst and foremost, I would like to say that I spent many hours researching tents before making my Tarptent purchase. I traveled to many stores and was allowed to setup many tents.\n\nIn the end I purchased my Scarp 2 having never seen or setup the tent. My three main reasons were: 1. Weight, 2. mix tt-items and 3. It was made in the good ole USA. The third reason being maybe the most important to me!\n\nI instantly set it up as soon as it was unpacked and, having briefly run through the included paper work, found it to be a no hassle setup.\n\nI seam sealed the tent and then packed it way for my first trip, which was on January 20th 2012. A hike along the Ohlone Wilderness Trail in the East Bay area of the San Francisco Bay. The trail travels from Mission Peak in Fremont to Lake Del Valle in Livermore Ca.\n\nNot hitting the trail head until 4pm on Friday night meant we would be camping just off Mission Peak that first night. This night would be the defining night for the whole trip. The sun soon set and as it did the weather quickly changed. Before my partner and I were to the backpackers camp site, the wind and rain were battering us so bad that we were leaning so far toward that had it not been for the wind we would have fallen on our faces. Less than this and we would of been blown over backwards. Upon reaching our site we quickly setup camp, even with the darkness, wind and rain the tent setup fairly easy. Had I lost my grip on it though it would quickly have blown away to be lost forever. I used the crossing poles for extra stability and they quickly proved their worth.\n\nThe tent was extremely stable and kept us completely dry in pouring rain that for the most part was sideways due to the extremely strong winds.\n\nAfter the first night the rest of the trip was a cake walk. Upon returning home and checking the weather recording station on the next peak over, I found out that the wind speeds were 43.5 mph with gusts up to 54.7 mph.\n\nBecause of the first night, I am writing this review. I will never hesitate to recommend this American built product to anyone. If they decide to purchase another product then shame on them, because you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make them drink.\n\nI will soon be buying the single man version of this tent, the Scarp 1. Keep up the great work and Thank You for a great product.\n\nChris Hyde\n\nJust returned from three weeks hiking in New Zealand with my new Moment tent.\n\nJust wanted to say thank you for such an exceptionally well designed tent and offer some comments to people considering this Tarptent.\n\nI spent ten nights in the tent in various weather: hot and cold; wet and dry; windy and calm, high humidity and low humidity.\n\nThe Moment is the easiest tent I have ever erected, and even on impractical locations I found I could achieve a very good pitch. On this point, the floor of the Tarptents far exceeded the durability and waterproofing that I expected.\n\nFor a shelter that weighs virtually nothing the interior space is very very large and long. My pack took up only half the vestibule which left the other half for easy access. One stormy night I was pitched in a wide open valley and found that the Moment handles gale force winds admirably and is not a noisy shelter to sleep in. Although possibly not required, I added two 1.5mm guy ropes most of the time, as I found the shelter moves from side to side in high winds.\n\nI have found that once you have some experience with judging what the climatic conditions for the night might be, then it is easy to adjust the features of the Moment to suit.\n\nThe two most relevant considerations in the Moment are adjusting for protection against cold wind on the one hand and managing condensation on still nights on the other. Firstly, the height of the side walls can be lowered to block on the windward side and either side of the shelter allow you to build a low wall of clothing etc to block the reminder of the wind. On nights when condensation would be expected, I found that if you promote all the venting options that the Moment provides, then this is not an issue. On sites where there is no air circulation, I did find that condensation does become a problem.\n\nFor a tent of this type ( 1 person single skin ) I cannot find a single flaw in the design, but would add that the top cap on the peg/stakes pull off quite easily when trying to remove them from hard compacted ground. This could be remedied by riveting the cap to the peg/stake.\n\nI also own the Scarp 1, which I plan only to use when the weather is colder.\n\nYou will be pleased to know Henry, that I would like to purchase a Sublite Sil for shorter trips when rain is not predicted.\n\nNick Beer\n\nMelbourne, Australia\n\nOn Oct 13, 2010 I successfully completed my thru-hike of the PCT after 5 months on the trail!\n\nThank you for making an awesome tent in the form of my 1-man Rainbow! It was a home, a shelter, and a reliable comfort throughout my journey.\n\nBlessings\n\nTristan Oliver AKA Shake 'N Bake\n\nMy PCT website\n\nSanta Barbara, CA\n\nWe couldn't have been more pleased with the Tarptent Rainshadow 2.\n\nAlthough Tag-along and I slept in it more than 140 nights, this lightweight (43 ounce) single wall tent held up well and never let us down. That's in spite of the fact that 2009 AT hiking season broke east U.S. rainfall records.\n\nThe three-person design provided comfortable inside bug free space for both of us and all of our gear. With noseeum netting on both ends and along the lower sides, it is well-ventilated shelter. As a result, we had few issues with condensation.\n\nCarrying a few small eyehook screws allowed us to easily set-up on tent platforms. We never found any need to carry a protective ground sheet.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\n\nDane Ward\n\nRising Fawn, GA\n\nHi, my name is Colin\n\nI recently purchased a rainbow.I followed your instructions for sealing the seams and took it with me on the Georgia section of the Appalachian trail.\n\nThe last night me and a friend were at Addis gap. About an hour after dark a thunderstorm hit hard. My friends tent was leaking bad [ not a tarptent product ] he quickly became soaked. Just when he believed things couldn't get worse the temperature dropped fast. He began to shake from cold uncontrollably. He then came over to my tent were I was dry and asleep. He asked if I had room for him. I replied yes and he dove in cold, wet and shaking. I gave him my dry shirt and rain suit to try and hold in his body heat. Then I tried to warm him with my body heat and sleeping bag. After about two hours we finally got him warm and the storm passed.\n\nSo I would highly recommend this unit to anybody looking for a lightweight, waterproof tent that two can use in an emergency. This is a great product and I am looking forward to using it a long time.\n\nColin Jenkins\n\nMy wife and I bought the Double Rainbow a while back and have used it now for over a year.\n\nWe live and do most of our hiking/backpacking in Alaska. Other than that we have also used it on a Pacific coast biking trip. Throughout all that we have put it through a lot of use and used it in almost every weather situation you can think of.\n\nI have recommended this tent and company to everyone that I know and will continue to do so. For the weight, this tent can't be beat.\n\nNick Gillespie\n\nAnchorage, Alaska\n\nI just wanted you to know I took my tent out, for its first time, over the weekend. It worked fantastic!\n\nI was never hot, nor did I have inadequate air in the tent, nor did I have condensation.\n\nIt rained and poured a good chunk of the weekend and had gusts of wind up to 50mph at times. We were camping on a hilltop of a forest line (360 view). The hill got almost a cloud-like fog. You could wave your hand in front of your and it would get totally covered in mist. The temp was 30s-low 40s until Sunday and we got to mid 70s and sunny...that's Ohio for ya.\n\nMy tent was dry and a great sanctuary from the elements when it came time to rest. Just what I was looking for.\n\nPlenty of room in my Scarp 2 for a 6'2\" 285lb man and all of my gear.\n\nAlso, my friends were envious of the fact I could flip my tent, air it out and then fold it down into my backpack in short order. I was packed ahead of everyone and used the extra time to them tear down.\n\nYou have a great product, and I love that it's made right here in good old USA. May your company grow leaps and bounds.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDan Drake\n\nPowell, OH\n\nJust returned from a 3 day hike on the AT near Damascus, Va.\n\nI'm happy to report my Rainbow performed flawlessly. It pitched easily, remained taut, and had no condensation inside despite occasional rain showers during the night. Temps were in the low 50's with little breeze except for when it was raining hardest. I'm amazed at how well the Rainbow vents and kept my dry.\n\nI couldn't be happier with it especially after trying several other solo shelters, none of which were large enough for me and my gear and had severe condensation issues.\n\nIt's a solo hiker hotel and at 2 lbs 2oz it's so light I hardly knew I was carrying it.\n\nThanks for all the work you put into creating such a great solution for solo backpacking.\n\nCharles Hill\n\nGrayson, GA\n\nI recently ordered a Sublite after having owned a Rainbow for a couple of years. The Rainbow's a great tent but the lure of an 18 oz tent was just too much to pass up. I couldn't be happier! On a recent backpack on one of the Grand Canyon's tougher routes, the Sublite proved to be extremely easy to set up, spacious (for my needs), and very very stable in high winds when camped on an exposed ridge as a cold front moved in. (In fact, my friend's Sierra Designs Clip Flashlight blew over - with twisted poles - the same night that I had the best sleep of our trip!) As much as I love my Rainbow, I definitely didn't miss carrying the extra pound on my back - not to mention the extra three or four pounds I would have carried had I used another manufacturer's tent!\n\nThanks for making such a super product!\n\nJohn Melville\n\nBaltimore, MD\n\nGreetings,\n\nI wanted to let you know that I had a chance to use my new Contrail this past weekend. I took a 3 day trip into the Pecos Wilderness located in the Sangre De Cristo Mountains north of Santa Fe, NM. I practiced the set-up and take down a few times at home, after seem sealing, and thought it was a breeze. However, it wasn't until I was setting up at the same time as my \"tent friend\" that I realized how easy it really was. I had it fully pitched before he had the pole in his tent. The next morning I had it back in my pack before he had his rain fly off. My buddy came down with a severe case of tarp envy. The Contrail is very convenient to use and has plenty of room to spare inside. I need the comfort of bug and critter protection, and can't imagine a better tent than the Contrail for the weight, volume, and ease of set-up. Also, the Pecos Wilderness is exceedingly muggy this time of year due to frequent and heavy thunderstorms. Nevertheless, I had zero condensation inside due to the great ventilation.\n\nThanks for the Contrail, it has really improved my backpacking experience.\n\nScott\n\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico\n\nJust finished up Big Bend National Park outer mountain loop with the StratoSpire 2.\n\nLoved the tent and was warm every night. Kept dry during a short rain. Great tent and very well built. I had lots of room for storage under the two vestibules.\n\nThanks Tarptent!\n\nMatthew H.\n\nDear Henry,\n\nI bought a Rainbow Tarptent last November and actually used it for the first time on December 1st.\n\nFour of us went up a trail near Snoqualmie Pass, Wa. expecting 3\" of snow overnight. What we got was actually closer to 5'! The Tarptent withstood the load!\n\nThis adventure turned into a 4 day rescue ordeal and we were in a pickle to put it mildly.\n\nEverything we had was wet, all of our clothes, our bags, tents etc., we were cold, I got frostbite and eventually lost a toe.\n\nThe four of us survived in one 2-man tent while the Tarptent held all of our gear snug and secure. When we finally got rescued, my gear, along with the Tarptent was cached on the mountain.I considered this gear to be lost and a litter recovery mission at best.\n\nYesterday, 9 months later, my gear was recovered and the Tarptent had withstood this test of time on the mountain with no damage whatsoever. It was actually slept in for the second time last night and it is as new.\n\nThere is a slight mildew odor in the stuff sack from being packed wet for so long along with wet dirty clothes but was not noticeable when pitched. This was money well spent.\n\nThank you for making such a great product.\n\nChris Van Over\n\nMarblemount, WA\n\nHello,\n\nI purchased a Rainshadow 2 tent a few months ago and I just want to tell you how thrilled I am with this tent. I have used it twice in the Montana Beartooth Wilderness and once in the South Dakota Black Elk Wilderness. It is easy to set up, easy to pack, has room for three with plenty of gear storage, and has a great vestibule design. The waterproofness of the silnylon is superb as I experienced on the last trip with my teenage son and daughter. I made the mistake of choosing a very attractive flat spot for pitching the tent that was also a low spot. We had an hard thunderstorm early that evening that resulted in at least 3/8\" of standing water in places under the tent from runoff of the surrounding rocks and high ground. The amazing thing was the standing water did not penetrate the tent floor and we stayed completely dry! We joked about the \"water bed\" we were sleeping on until the water finally soaked into the ground after several hours.\n\nI have owned several tents over the past 40 years but never one as water-proof or as well designed as the Rainshadow 2. It holds up great in high elevation (10,000 feet) winds, ventilates well (even in the mid-day sun!), provides good headroom (we sat up and played card games for 2 hours in the rain one evening), and the tent is spacious for three and incredibly luxurious for two. I also really like the flexible vestibule design that can be opened up for ventilation or closed in a few seconds for cool weather and rain. Combined with the ultra lightweight I don't think this tent can be beat for functionality at any price. Our backpacking trips this year have been more enjoyable thanks to the Rainshadow 2.\n\nIf I ever wear this tent out I will certainly purchase another one from you. Thank you for designing and manufacturing such a great tent.\n\nKind regards,\n\nFrank Schaner\n\nBillings, MT\n\nI want to say thanks for the rainbow tent you sold to me: it's great! I used it on a 14 day bike trip in Morocco and liked it very much. It's amazing what value you provide for such a light tent. It's well-built, has good materials and some clever features. Thanks again!\n\nI don't have a fancy photo of the tent that I can send to you, but more than one fancy memories of using it. Keep up the good work!\n\nDirk Bernhardt\n\nBerlin, Germany\n\nHello-- I ordered a Contrail Tent from you guys last year in preparation for my thru-hike on the Appalachian Trail. At first the tent was on my list of gear with major issues to resolve. It leaked, through the screen around the floor, whenever it rained. I called it my \"bathtub,\" and was extremely grateful to have my Thermarest as a floatation device. Because of my Thermarest, my sleeping bag stayed relatively dry.\n\nThen I met a couple of guys on Avery Peak in the Saddleback Mountains, Maine. They fiddled with my tent showing me how to add guy lines, pulling the tent walls out, making them taut. We used rocks instead of stakes. They were puzzled with the way the line on the front, left side was attached. They thought the design bad. I contemplated taking that line apart and fiddling with it but I am a knuckle head and would no doubt make it even worse. After that, although it took extra time to set up, my tent improved with the extra guy-lines and I rode out some major thunderstorms.\n\nLater, in Vermont, I hiked into camp and found that there were two other hikers with Tarp Tents! We could have made a nice advertisement for you. Sky Dog had a Contrail like mine and his was set up so beautifully I asked him to look at my tent. He noticed the left guy line was tied incorrectly and redid it. Since then the tent worked splendidly. My Contrail went off the gear issues list and onto my FAVORITE equipment list.\n\nIt took me 166 days to hike the entire AT from Maine to Georgia and my favorite nights were the nights I slept under the stars in my Contrail. I pitched it in the rain, on high peaks in the wind, brushy stealth spots along the trail and even in the snow. It is a palace of a little tent. Good Times! Thank you for a great product.\n\nYours,\n\nBirdy AKA\n\nKaren Mansfield\n\nChicago\n\nI'd like to thank you for the outstanding customer service and the outstanding product that you put out. My wife and I thru-hiked from GA-ME this 07 season and could not have been happier with our choice to use the Double Rainbow. We battled many rainstorms and some seriously cold nights and hid from mosquitoes with stealth quality. We met plenty of other Tarpte"
