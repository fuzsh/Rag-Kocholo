        "text": "General Course Description\n\nWoodburn Golf Club is a community-run, 9-hole executive (3 par 3s and 6 par 4s) public course just beyond the Woodburn Outlet Mall, about 30 miles south of downtown Portland. Woodburn Golf Club is an unusual course and, if you check all attitudes (except to have fun) at the gate, you might have a delightful experience. Although there is a clubhouse, it is generally closed and payment is on the honor system. The layout is pasture, back and forth in a square with the fairways and rough cut the same (which is deep for a fairway, but has gotten shorter in recent years). Other than some big trees, there are no real obstacles. The greens are sand, which do not hold, are very inconsistent, and can be like putting on cement when wet. But because it is so unusual, and everyone who is there wants to be there, it is fun to play. You will have more fun if you check the local rules (lots of relief, from lots of places, and you may be allowed an automatic 2-putt). It is truly a club, owned by members and run (including maintenance) by members. Flat and short, an easy walk.\n\nCourse History\n\nOpened in 1925. In the 2000s the direction of the 4 holes that define the edge of the property were reversed to avoid slicers hitting their balls onto Highway 219. Otherwise, the course has not been altered. It is the only sand greens course in Oregon.\n\nWhy It Is There\n\nVance Yoder and several of his golf buddies wanted a place to play, as the closest course in the early 1920s was in Salem. In 1925, they formed an association and purchased and leased 30 acres (the leased property was subsequently bought). Memberships were sold and a Salem pro, Gene Sharkey, was hired to design the course. Sand greens were installed (requiring exclusively Columbia River sand) and sheep were used to keep the grass mowed. Originally, 100 shares of stock were sold. That same number exists today and is held by about 20 people. But the course is the center for a geographically wide number of golfers and has very active and well-populated men’s and women’s clubs whose goals are more about having fun and being with each other than scoring. And these clubs help to annually improve the course.\n\nI Wish I Would Have Known Before I Played\n\nThe greens do not hold because of the sand surface, and the fairway grass is a little long. To get and stay on the green with your approach, use the 1 to 2 bounce rule: let the ball will bounce 1 or 2 times before it reaches the green. Note on the par-4, 7th hole the dogleg left starts at about 100 yards from the pin, and on the short par-4, 8th hole the hard dogleg right starts at about 50 yards from the pin (and there is OB up the right).\n\nDid You Know\n\nYou are in charge of maintaining the green if you putt. After you putt, you are required to smooth the green with a carpet dragger to get rid of your footprints (a circular walk from the hole out seemed to work best).\n\nWhy Play This Course\n\nAn unusual experience, in a very laid back and friendly atmosphere. A great place to take out someone who is learning to play, while experienced golfers can practice (and try shots they normally would not have). For the price, a fun adventure.\n\nGeneral\n\nType: 9-hole public executive course\n\nPrice: $\n\nPhone/webpage: None\n\nAddress: 7899 Highway 219 NE, Woodburn, Oregon 97071\n\nOwner: Woodburn Golf Club, Inc.\n\nDesigner: Gene Sharkey\n\nPros: None\n\nPractice Facilities: None\n\nPro Shop: There is a cabin that is the clubhouse that is open on occasion.
