Your responsibilities and registration obligations\n\nIn order to use Store Mapper or certain parts of it, you may be required to register for a user account on Store Mapper; in this case, you agree to provide truthful information when requested, and -- if a minimum age is required for eligibility for a user account -- you undertake that you are at least the required age.

You agree to immediately notify the site administrator of any unauthorized use of your user account, user name or password.\n\n6. Your conduct\n\nYou agree that all information or data of any kind, whether text, software, code, music or sound, photographs or graphics, video or other materials (\"content\"), made available publicly or privately, will be under the sole responsibility of the person providing the said content, or of the person whose user account is used. You agree that Store Mapper may expose you to content that may be objectionable or offensive. The site administrator will not be responsible to you in any way for content displayed on Store Mapper, nor for any error or omission. By using Store Mapper or any service provided, you explicitly agree that: (a) you will not provide any content or conduct yourself in any way that may be construed as: unlawful; illegal; threatening; harmful; abusive; harassing; stalking; tortious; defamatory; libelous; vulgar; obscene; offensive; objectionable; pornographic; designed to interfere with or disrupt the operation of Store Mapper or any service provided; infected with a virus or other destructive or deleterious programming routine; giving rise to civil or criminal liability; or in violation of an applicable local, national or international law; (b) you will not impersonate or misrepresent your association with any person or entity; you will not forge or otherwise seek to conceal or misrepresent the origin of any content provided by you; (c) you will not collect or harvest any information about other users; (d) you will not provide, and you will not use Store Mapper to provide, any content or service in any commercial manner, or in any manner that would involve junk mail, spam, chain letters, pyramid schemes, or any other form of unauthorized advertising or commerce; you will not use Store Mapper to promote or operate any service or content without the site administrator's prior written consent; (e) you will not provide any content that may give rise to the site administrator being held civilly or criminally liable, or that may be considered a violation of any local, national or international law, including -- but not limited to -- laws relating to copyrights, trademarks, patents, or trade secrets.\n\n7. Submission of content on Store Mapper\n\nBy providing any content to Store Mapper, you agree to submit content in a format determined by the site administrator, and not in a manner that undermines the integrity of the content itself. You agree to follow Counter Tools’ formatting and content guidelines for data submission as well as the restrictions specified above in section 6.\n\n8. Indemnification\n\nYou agree to indemnify and hold harmless the site administrator and the site administrator's representatives, subsidiaries, affiliates, related parties, officers, directors, employees, agents, independent contractors, advertisers, partners, and co-branders, from any claim or demand, including reasonable legal fees, that may be filed by any third party, arising out of your conduct or connection with Store Mapper or service, your provision of content, your violation of these Terms of Use, or any other violation by you of the rights of another person or party.\n\n9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES\n\nYOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF STORE MAPPER AND OF ANY SERVICES OR CONTENT PROVIDED (THE \"SERVICE\") IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED TO YOU \"AS IS\", AND THE SITE ADMINISTRATOR EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER IMPLIED OR EXPRESS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE SITE ADMINISTRATOR MAKES NO WARRANTY, EITHER IMPLIED OR EXPRESS, THAT ANY PART OF THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, VIRUS-FREE, TIMELY, SECURE, ACCURATE, RELIABLE, OR OF ANY QUALITY, NOR IS IT WARRANTED EITHER IMPLICITLY OR EXPRESSLY THAT ANY CONTENT IS SAFE IN ANY MANNER FOR DOWNLOAD. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT NEITHER THE SITE ADMINISTRATOR NOR ANY PARTICIPANT IN THE SERVICE PROVIDES PROFESSIONAL ADVICE OF ANY KIND AND THAT ANY ADVICE OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION OBTAINED VIA STORE MAPPER MAY BE USED SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND THAT THE SITE ADMINISTRATOR WILL NOT BE HELD LIABLE IN ANY WAY. Some jurisdictions may not allow disclaimers of implied warranties, and certain statements in the above disclaimer may not apply to you as regards implied warranties; the other terms and conditions remain enforceable notwithstanding.\n\n10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n\nYOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE SITE ADMINISTRATOR WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES; THIS INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF THE SITE ADMINISTRATOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM (I) THE USE OF SERVICES OR THE INABILITY TO USE SERVICES, (II) THE COST OF OBTAINING SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND/OR SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY TRANSACTION ENTERED INTO ON THROUGH SERVICES, (III) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR DATA TRANSMISSIONS, (IV) STATEMENTS BY ANY THIRD PARTY OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY USING SERVICES, OR (V) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO SERVICES. In some jurisdictions, it is not permitted to limit liability and, therefore, such limitations may not apply to you.\n\n11.
