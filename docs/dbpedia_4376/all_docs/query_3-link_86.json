        "text": "Woodburn, located in Marion County, Oregon holds history dating back to 1871. By 1889 it had been officially incorporated and acted as a strategic connector for travelers between Salem and Portland – providing easy access through Interstate 5. Today the city hosts an estimated population of 26k citizens within its boundaries that straddle multiple transportation routes such as 211 & 214 state highways plus Union Pacific & Willamette Valley Railway freight lines; making Woodburn part of the larger Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA).\n\nIn the 1840s, when many settlers were looking for a new life in Oregon’s fertile lands and temperate climate, it was no surprise that Woodburn soon emerged on French Prairie. It all began with Eli C. Cooley from Missouri who traveled across America to find his destiny here; he’d been followed by Bradford S. Bonney of Massachusetts who claimed land there just one year later – both securing Donation Land Claims recognized under Congress’ 1850 Act as the U.S annexed much of Pacific Northwest and established the Oregon Territory two years prior then-forth creating what is now known today as Woodburn!"
