I will be teaching a physical tactics class for the IPFW Police Dept on March 29th for their officers. So far this year WPD has worked 202 incidents.\n\nAudience:\n\nDeputy Clerk Palmer told council that she has been approached by several citizens who would like to go back to the community taking care of the pots and having it be a competition for the Day in the Park festival. She told council that everyone enjoyed doing it and it cost the city nothing. She will be attending the next Woodburn Community Association meeting to request that change. Mayor told her it was a project of the Main Street Committee.\n\nMayor:\n\nMet with Kristi Sturtz about the environmental review. By August we should know if we have the Main Street grant. Our Allen County TIF district went through. The city had closing on the land in the Industrial Park that was sold to RAMCO. Mayor would like to instruct Donovan to survey the rest. A purchase agreement was presented to council from North American Cold Storage Councilman Voirol made a motion to accept the agreement for $153,750 with our lawyers changes, Councilman Renner 2nd, all approved, motion carried. The mayor went to road school last week to get ERC certified to enable the city to apply for road grants. Surveyor Adam Frymouth is submitting a claim from Dozerwerks for the excavating at the ditch during the flooding. The mayor and Ryan Walls went to look at bucket trucks selling at the Fort Wayne Vehicle Auction and then back to Pampered Coach to look at a truck that is available. Ryan’s recommendation is to try it out for a day or two to see if it fits our needs.\n\nTreasurer:\n\nResident, Casey Cobbs, is requesting a sewer discount due to frozen pipes and excess water usage. Council decided to place on hold until Mr. Cobbs could come and explain the situation. Warrants were presented, Councilman Rice made a motion to approve, Councilman Abbott 2nd, all approved, motion carried. Ordinance # 14-1313 was introduced for the 2nd reading, Councilman Abbott made a motion to read by title only, Councilman Rice 2nd all approved, motion carried.

Meeting minutes from the March 3, 2014 were presented for changes or corrections. Councilman Abbott made a motion to approve. Councilman Voirol 2nd, all approved (Councilman Rice abstained because he was absent) motion carried.\n\nSuperintendent Walls – Absent\n\nCouncilman Abbott:\n\nA resident called because the curbs and lawn are getting tore up due to the plowing.\n\nCouncilman Rice:\n\nWanted to know if the tower that fell over out at the shop was intentional. No a guide wire snapped.\n\nCouncilman Renner:\n\nObserved other cities and in comparison thought Woodburn’s streets looked much better.\n\nCouncilman Gerig – No Report\n\nCouncilman Voirol – Would like council to consider using the money from the sale of land in the Industrial Park for the cost of the Chlorine swirl.\n\nCouncilman Rice made a motion to adjourn, Councilman Renner 2nd, all approved, motion carried at 8:00 p.m. Minutes prepared by Clerk-Treasurer Holly Sarrazine."
