        "text": "The 2nd Annual Marion-Polk Child, Youth & Family Services Summit was a success! Professionals and advocates gathered at the Salem Convention Center to explore resilience and belonging.\n\nInspiring workshops and panels left us motivated to continue supporting our community's children and families!\n\nDr. Joe Morelock, WESD Superintendent, summed it up perfectly: \"The summit reinforced the importance of community collaboration and reminded me that together, we can truly make a difference in the lives of children and families.\"\n\nRecently, WESD collaborated with the Oregon Department of Transportation, the Association of General Contractors, and the Asphalt Pavement Association of Oregon on a billboard contest promoting work zone safety. The contest garnered 86 submissions, all of which were designed by high-school students in the region. Two standout designs were selected as winners. These billboards are now posted near Eugene, Salem, and Portland, Oregon, and serve as a testament to the power of collaboration and spreading awareness about work zone safety.\n\nThe 2024 WESD School Safety Summit was a highly anticipated event that took place on February 13, 2024, at the Marion Center - Willamette ESD. The event was hosted by the School Safety Team within the School Improvement Services Department at WESD. The summit aimed to shed light on the interconnectedness of physical, psychological, and emotional safety in K-12 settings."
