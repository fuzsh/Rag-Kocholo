        "text": "Belle Passi is one of Oregon's ghost towns, situated about a mile south of Woodburn and consisting now principally of the pioneer cemetery known as the Belle Passi Cemetery. The name came before the public in February 1942, as the result of the erection of an historical marker by members of Belle Passi chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution of Woodburn. The marker commemorates the establishment of a pioneer community that eventually succumbed because of the development of Woodburn. The post office at Belle Passi was established on June 15, 1860. The name was changed to Gervais on November 5, 1871. This shows the marker in April 1965. Source: Salem Public Library OTB.4.4"
