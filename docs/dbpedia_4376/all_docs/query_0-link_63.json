        "text": "2011 Best of Grants Pass\n\nI had to go through last year’s issues of the Sneak Preview to see exactly what happened in the placid, little town of Grants Pass.\n\nThe election in November produced a new County Commissioner (Simon Hare) and retained the incumbent sheriff (Gil Gilbertson). Since then, County Commissioner Dwight Ellis resigned to find a more placid (there’s that word again) lifestyle, leaving the remaining two commissioners (Hare and Sandi Cassanelli) to find a replacement. When that ended up in useless bickering, Ellis has again ridden to the rescue and agreed to take part in the process.\n\nIn February, the City Council voted to allow a cell tower in a residential neighborhood, forcing the Peaceful Pink People to appeal to the State.\n\nIn March the State Elections Division upheld a decision that City Manager Laurel Samson violated some “rules” during the 2009 public safety election. The headline of my story was “much ado about nothing,” and I stand by that opinion.\n\nIn May the City astounded everyone with a proposal for a sales tax in Grants Pass. Yeah, good luck on that one. And in June, we wrote about possible contaminants in the Rogue River due to the removal of Gold Ray Dam.\n\nAll in all, a fairly exciting year. No earthquakes or tsunamis … just your run-of-the-mill craziness in Josephine County. Which is why I want everyone to relax, take a deep breath, and enjoy this 25th running of the “Best of the Rogue Valley.”\n\nWe received 318 ballots this year, and we want to thank everyone for taking the time fill them out. Granted, this type of survey is not totally accurate and is subject to a certain amount of ballot stuffing, but all of that is taken into consideration by our team of professional ballot counters. The results are as close to reality as we can get in an imperfect world, and they also achieve an important goal—recognizing and naming as many individuals, businesses and organizations in the community as we can. And that’s a good thing.\n\nBut enough of the rhetoric and on with the show … the 2011 “Best of the Rogue Valley.”\n\nDEMOGRAPHICS\n\nWe asked the question, “Ducks, Beavers or Others,” figuring it would provide some kind of hint as to what kind of people answered this survey. The results were 54% Ducks, 29% Beavers, and 17% “Others,” with the Raiders gaining the most “other” votes.\n\nMEDIA\n\nFAVORITE RADIO STATION\n\nMarconi didn’t know the can of worms he was opening when he postulated the possibility of sending signals by radio telegraphy. Little could he know that the invention would make millions of dollars for professional haranguers like Howard Stern and Rush Limbaugh.\n\nHere in the Rogue Valley, we keep our haranguing on the radio to a minimum, which is why our readers once again gave their voice of approval to KAJO and KLDR, owned and operated by the Wilson family. They were awarded 37% of the votes, with Jefferson Public Radio coming in third with 19%.\n\nOther favorites included:\n\nKBOY: 9%\n\nKDOV: 6%\n\nKRWQ: 6%\n\nKISS-FM: 5%\n\nKRRM: 4%\n\n102.7 “The Drive”: 4%\n\nKROG: 3%\n\nKZZE: 2%\n\nKCNA: 2%\n\nAll others: 3%\n\nFAVORITE DJ\n\nThere’s a conspiracy theory going around that when the aliens landed at Roswell, N.M., in 1947, they inserted their brains into radio disc jockeys around the world, spreading their message of rock ‘n’ roll, which was invented on their home planet. More on this theory later.\n\nOne deejay able to thwart the advances of the alien takeover was KAJOs Carl Wilson, who has won this event five times in the last 25 years. There ain’t an alien alive that would dare mess with ol’ Carl. We don’t call him “the Rock” for nothing … so thanks for saving humanity, dude.\n\nOther deejay stalwarts featured:\n\nJeanette Stark of KLDR.\n\nDon Matthews of JPR.\n\nJason Allen of KRWQ.\n\nCassie Callas of KLDR.\n\nGemineye at KISS-FM.\n\nBEST LOCAL TV NEWS STATION\n\nOkay, how many people saw me interviewed on Channel 10 while spending a day at Grants Pass Downs in June? The reporter even zoomed in on my stat sheet where it showed me winning $1.75 for the day. Last of the big-time spenders, I’ll tell ya.\n\nOnce again this category was a runaway as NewsWatch 12 (KDRV) continues to impress viewers with their coverage of the news.\n\nKOBI/Channel 5 and KTVL (Channel 10) also received their fair share of votes.\n\nFAVORITE TV SPORTS REPORTER\n\nThe local guys don’t get to cover the perp walks of Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, but they’re on the scene when our local high school teams make a run for the state championship. And seriously, isn’t that more interesting, anyway?\n\nTopping the list for 2011 was Joe Camarlinghi of KOBI, who’s been with Channel 5 since 2007.\n\nOthers mentioned a lot were:\n\nChris Leone of KDRV.\n\nChris Breece, who does weekend sports for KDRV.\n\nFAVORITE REPORTER AT THE DAILY COURIER\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the local daily started in 1885 as the Grant’s Pass Courier, then became the Rogue River Courier from 1886 until 1919. It was changed to its current nomenclature “to avoid confusion after the town of Woodville changed its name to Rogue River.”\n\nToday, it is the second oldest, continuously running newspaper in the entire state of Oregon, and our readers appreciate their efforts, naming quite a few reporters. Topping the list was Zach Urness, a sports reporter who also writes “Zach’s Adventures,” taking readers to outdoor destinations in Southern Oregon and Northern California.\n\nOthers mentioned a lot were:\n\nNatural resources reporter Jeff Duewel.\n\nCity editor Kevin Widdison.\n\nCounty reporter Stacy Stumbo.\n\nEntertainment editor Edith Decker.\n\nPolice/courts reporter Shaun Hall.\n\nCity reporter Jim Moore.\n\nLifelines reporter Kathleen Alaks.\n\nNews editor Patricia Snyder.\n\nBEST ADS IN THE SNEAK PREVIEW\n\nWhenever we ask the question “Favorite part of the Sneak Preview?” there are “x” number of people who invariably answer, “The ads.” So here’s your chance to single out your favorites for recognition. While the overwhelming choice was “coupon ads for restaurants,” we were actually looking for something a little more specific.\n\nTaking down top honors in this category was the back page ad for Roe Motors, written by Ross Roe and laid out by yours truly. Ross and I have been collaborating on that back page spread for the last 24 years, and I suppose I should buy him lunch one day.\n\nAlso receiving their fair share of votes were:\n\nThe ads for Martin Printing.\n\nClub Northwest ads.\n\nThe Barnstormers’ ads.\n\nThe ads for Wildlife Images.\n\nThe Evergreen Federal ad with the bear on a motorcycle.\n\nThe Kitchen Company ads.\n\nPEOPLE/BUSINESS\n\nBEST NEW BUSINESS IN TOWN (LAST YEAR)\n\nAnyone who opens a new business in this economy is a true hero and an eternal optimist. But seriously, the only reason we’re in this economic mess is that we all got a little greedy back during the housing bubble, and the house of cards came tumbling down. We just got to hang in there and support each other.\n\nAnyway, winning this category for 2011 was Sleadd’s Adventure Depot, a “toy and hobby shop” at 420 SW 6th where you can find slot cars, train sets, remote-control helicopters, nerf guns, Lego sets and more.\n\nFive different restaurants were also mentioned, which included:\n\nBlack Bear Diner.\n\nHannah’s Restaurant.\n\nYogurt Hut.\n\nChik-n-Ribs.\n\nPita Pit.\n\nMOST COMMUNITY-INVOLVED BUSINESSPERSON\n\nThis was an interesting category, as Grants Pass is home to an extraordinary number of businesspeople who devote themselves to the betterment of this community. Two of those are Cliff Bennett and his son Travis who get up every morning at 5:00 to water and plant fifty flower baskets scattered throughout downtown Grants Pass. The Bennetts have provided this beautification program to local residents for the last ten years and should be honored for it.\n\nOthers included:\n\nBrady Adams of Evergreen Federal.\n\nRoss Roe and Steve Roe at Roe Motors GM.\n\nDave Thomason of Taprock and Elmer’s.\n\nGiff Gates of Gates Furniture.\n\nRick Chapman of Plaza Sewing.\n\nFAVORITE HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER (GRANTS PASS)\n\nYour time in high school only lasts four years but for many it’s a defining moment in their career as a human being. Why else would high school reunions be so popular?\n\nBy definition, we all probably exhibited a certain amount of adolescent behavior at that time, and we should thank our teachers for putting up with us. At GPHS, that list would include Marty Zottola, who teaches Advanced Humanities, college writing and English.\n\nAlso high on the list were:\n\nTeri Houghton, English.\n\nKate Skudstad, Theater.\n\nShaun Gross, Math.\n\nBob Gulden, English and Journalism.\n\nAndy Frye, History.\n\nFAVORITE HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER (JOSEPHINE COUNTY)\n\nOn the county side of the high school ledger, our readers most often named Sherry Zottola, a language arts and drama teacher at Hidden Valley, followed by:\n\nGreg Patch, science at North Valley.\n\nJames Speelman, agriculture at HVHS.\n\nRobert Jackson, PE/Heath at Hidden Valley.\n\nStuart Burgess, social studies, HVHS.\n\nFAVORITE LOCAL SPORTS COACH\n\nWhether they win the state championship or come in last in their league is irrelevant to the real task: teaching kids to play together as a team and exhibit good sportsmanship. And in that regard our readers named Marlo Manzanares, the swimming coach at GPHS, as number one.\n\nThe list also featured:\n\nJohn Musser, GPHS football.\n\nChristy Pitts, GPHS Royalettes.\n\nTodd Willaman, North Valley football coach.\n\nBill Cowell, GPHS basketball.\n\nFrank Pagni, GPHS bowling.\n\nFAVORITE PRINCIPAL\n\nWhen the latest natural disaster hits (a plague of locusts, a 9.2 earthquake, etc.), everyone else in school is allowed to go crazy, bemoaning their fate and generally acting like a human. The principal, however, has got to keep it together and be totally in charge, instilling confidence, directing traffic, and laying down the rules.\n\nWho to turn to when disaster strikes? Our readers most often mentioned Ernie Baldwin, principal of Grants Pass High School, followed by:\n\nRyan Thompson, Allendale Elementary.\n\nGeorge Personius, Highland.\n\nDennis Misner, Hidden Valley High School.\n\nRené Cardiff, South Middle School.\n\nJessica Durant, Manzanita Elementary.\n\nFAVORITE INSTRUCTOR AT RCC\n\nRogue Community College could easily be the best value for higher education in the entire state. With two campuses in Grants Pass and Medford, and a partnership with Southern Oregon University, not to mention a dedicated faculty, you can’t ask for much more.\n\nAnd when it comes to dedicated faculty, our readers named quite a few, including this year’s winner Lutz Kramer, a Humanities instructor who also won this award back in 1993.\n\nOthers landing near the top were:\n\nBobbi Kidder in theater.\n\nMidge Shaw in the Tutoring Center.\n\nPete Ridgeway in the Automotive Department.\n\nKate Campbell in music.\n\nJohn Salinas, science.\n\nCUTEST BABY BORN IN LAST YEAR\n\nWe received an extraordinary number of submissions for this category, and in the end our team of pediatric professionals chose Calum Yarrish as number one. See all their photos on the front page for the complete list.\n\nFAVORITE DENTIST\n\nThey greet you in the mirror every morning with a beautiful smile, and three times a day they take complete responsibility for making sure your food is properly chewed. So, hey, show ‘em a little respect and visit your dentist.\n\nAll of the local dentists were mentioned by our readers at least once in this category, with the final nod going to Greg Bigelow, who is a 4-time winner of this event, dating back to 1988.\n\nIt was a tough battle for the top, and the Top Five were:\n\nSteven Rogers.\n\nRichard Miller.\n\nMatt Johnston.\n\nMart Erickson.\n\nAlso mentioned a lot were:\n\nTyler Wright.\n\nTim Dwyer.\n\nPeter Pastrell.\n\nDan GaRey.\n\nSara Riechers.\n\nFAVORITE DOCTOR\n\nYou could have all the money in the world, live in a beautiful mansion, own expensive cars, and have your own private golf course in the backyard, but if you ain’t feeling well, it’s all for naught. You might as well be holed up in a compound in Pakistan, hiding from Navy Seals.\n\nVisiting your family doctor and learning how to stay healthy is extremely important. Thirty-two different doctors were mentioned by our readers, with number one going to Dan Gleffe, a family practitioner who graduated from the University of Michigan Medical School in 1984.\n\nOthers high on the list were:\n\nSteve Marshak, pediatrician.\n\nTamara Medley at the Women’s Health Center.\n\nHeather Kahn, family practitioner.\n\nLorene Hamilton, M.D.\n\nDerrick Sorweide, D.O.\n\nBernie Hill, M.D.\n\nEdmund Glovinsky, D.O.\n\nFelicia Cohen, OB/GYN.\n\nFAVORITE OPTOMETRIST/OPTICIAN\n\nYour eyes are basically an extension of your brain, so it semi-behooves you to treat them right. Not staring into the sun right before a solar eclipse should be at the top of the list, and visiting an eye doctor or optometrist every year or two would be a close second.\n\nWho to see (no pun intended)? Our readers most often mentioned Michael W. Schwartz, O.D., although the battle at the top was an eye-opener. They included:\n\nMark Maffett, M.D., P.C., of Cascade EyeCare Center.\n\nScott Walters, O.D., of the Eye Care Group.\n\nDennis Kantor, O.D., of Exclusive Eyewear.\n\nRussell Leavitt, M.D., P.C., of Cascade.\n\nKenji Hamada, O.D.\n\nFAVORITE NATUROPATHIC DOCTOR/ACUPUNCTURIST\n\nSurgery and a lifelong addiction to pharmaceutical drugs are not always the best solution to perfect health. Sometimes it just comes down to nutrition and lifestyle, with an emphasis on preventive medicine. And when our readers want to learn more about naturopathic medicine, they most often turned to Ellen Heinitz of the Naturopathic Medical Clinic, followed by:\n\nKristin Plunkett.\n\nStephanie Hansen Love.\n\nAcupuncture is another alternative to relieving symptoms and maintaining health. Our readers were most impressed with the work of Greg Doss of the Acupuncture and Herbal Medical Center and Janet Moret of River of Wellness. Also mentioned a lot were:\n\nRáven Sárá of the Acupuncture & Herb Clinic.\n\nDeborah Lang of River of Wellness.\n\nLisa Berger of Shen Ming.\n\nEllen Leonard of Acupuncture at Riverside.\n\nPaula Edwards at the Naturopathic Medical Clinic.\n\nKim Bibeau of Kaizen Healing Arts.\n\nFAVORITE MASSAGE THERAPIST\n\nYou just spent the entire afternoon helping your buddy Sisyphus try to roll an immense boulder up a hill, and the damn thing kept rolling back just as you got to the top. Being a former king, he tried to blame it all on you. By the end of the day, every muscle in your body ached, and the only cure was a visit to your favorite massage therapist.\n\nOur readers were able to name quite a few, including the number one choice, Sabina Hillman, of Body Evolution Massage, followed by:\n\nCharlotte Sperisen.\n\nJocelyn Vodovoz.\n\nSheri Vorberg.\n\nCara Brown.\n\nSuzanne Rosa of Cloud 9 Massage.\n\nFAVORITE HAIR STYLIST\n\nOut of the blue, Hollywood called and asked you to emcee the Oscar awards next year, and you’re already freaking out about your hairdo. Forget the fact that millions of people, not to mention George Clooney, will be listening to your introductions and one-liners … what’s most important is that you look good.\n\nWhere to go when the Academy calls for you? In this popular category, 38 different hair stylists were named, so the competition was tough. It also turned out to be extremely close, so the award goes to the Top Three: Linda Whalen of Action Hair Designs; Kari Heglin of Shear Pleasure; and Carrol Oyler of Carrol’s Image Connection.\n\nThe Top Ten featured:\n\nGary Poulton.\n\nTraci Brown of Personal Touch.\n\nJackie Simonsen of Spa at Club Northwest.\n\nPeggy Hayes of Cinderella Beauty Salon.\n\nKelly Horban of Endulgence.\n\nHolly Riley.\n\nRichard Elling of Park Avenue Salon.\n\nBEST PLACE TO GET FACIALS/SKIN CARE TREATMENT\n\nIn this helter skelter world of tsunamis, Navy Seal attacks, phone hacking in Britain, and bad reality TV shows, you need a little pampering. Nothing says it quite like a facial, where you just lie back and have your face transformed in a tranquil atmosphere of total serenity. (I missed my calling; I should write ad copy for Vanity Fair.)\n\nAnyway, who are our readers most impressed with when it comes to facials? The majority said The Spa at Club Northwest, although quite a few were mentioned, including:\n\nAesthetiSpa.\n\nLa Bella Faccia.\n\nAmbiance.\n\nEn Vogue.\n\nSkin Rejuvenation.\n\nAvenue Salon.\n\nBEST AUTO REPAIR SHOP\n\nThe first car I ever bought was a ’49 Packard in Yellowstone Park the summer of 1969. Four of us chipped in on it, and while driving it home from St. Anthony, Idaho, it broke down on us. Turned out it was unfixable, and the guy gave us half our money back. Doesn’t seem right, does it?\n\nWhere would our readers recommend we go if the same thing happened today? Many of the local repair shops were mentioned, with Tom’s Auto Service getting the number one nod. It was extremely close at the top, however, and the Top Five were:\n\nExtreme Auto Repair.\n\nHuck’s Garage.\n\nStar Automotive.\n\nTowne Center Auto Repair.\n\nOthers high on the list were:\n\nBridge Street Auto Repair.\n\nRoe Motors GM.\n\nAuto Smith.\n\nJim Sigel Chevrolet.\n\nMock’s Ford.\n\nHenderson’s.\n\nFAVORITE AUTO BODY SHOP\n\nIn 1985 I finally bought my first new car, and two months later an idiot dinged it in a parking lot. I went and had the door repainted, but the color didn’t match. I had to endure a mis-matched door for the next eight years because I was too cheap to have it done right.\n\nWhere to go in order to do that? This one ended up in a tie between Apland’s Auto Body (2163 Spaulding) and DJ’s Bump & Paint at 3235 SW G, followed by:\n\nHam’s Auto Body.\n\nMock Ford.\n\nRoe Motors GM.\n\nValles Auto Body.\n\nFAVORITE CAR SALESMAN\n\nI still remember the scene in Breaking Away, where the teenage son is helping his car salesman dad at the lot and tells an unsatisfied customer he can have a refund. “REFUND!” the dad screams, then has a heart attack and is taken to the hospital.\n\nThings aren’t nearly that drastic here in the Rogue Valley, and our readers appreciate all the hard work that car salesmen put in. Topping the list for 2011 was Kevin Newins of Wheeler Toyota.\n\nThe Top Five included:\n\nFred Shepherd at Roe Motors.\n\nLon McKellar of Quality Cars.\n\nMike Reese of Glenn Reese Auto Sales North.\n\nScott Gigstad at Mock’s Ford.\n\nJoe Bouquet at Roe Motors.\n\nFAVORITE CPA/ACCOUNTANT\n\nHave you ever seen a college textbook on Accounting? It’s about as thick as a New York City phonebook and details all the mistakes people can make when they try to do their taxes and bookkeeping by themselves.\n\nWhere to go if you flunked Accounting 101? This one ended in a tie between Ken Behymer (237 SE J) and Cynthia Harelson (318 NW A), followed by:\n\nRandy Jentzsch.\n\nBobbie Winters.\n\nDavid Raskin.\n\nKathleen Kelly.\n\nFAVORITE ATTORNEY\n\nOkay, did you hear about the new sushi bar that caters exclusively to lawyers? It’s called “Sosumi.” Or did you hear about the terrorists who took a whole courtroom full of lawyers hostage? The threatened to release one every hour until their demands were met.\n\nSeriously, though, we love our attorneys, especially when they’re there to bail us out of bad situations. The lawyer jokes always refer to the other guy’s lawyer.\n\nTwenty-five different attorneys were mentioned in this survey, with the top spot going to Richard Lane, followed by:\n\nBen Freudenberg.\n\nChris Mecca.\n\nPat Kelly.\n\nDennis James.\n\nMatt Galli.\n\nDan Simcoe.\n\nBill Ransom.\n\nJason Hayward.\n\nFAVORITE POLICEPERSON\n\nWe live in a society full of rules, and the only way to ensure the success of such a system is to have a dedicated group of people to enforce them. The best police officers, though, are ones who realize that “the law” should never trump “the people,” and that every situation needs to be approached with some flexibility. That’s my soapbox for the day.\n\nThis is always a popular category with our readers, and 21 different police officers were mentioned, including this year’s winner, Officer Pete Jenista of Grants Pass Public Safety. Others mentioned a lot were:\n\nGP Officer Mike Miner.\n\nSheriff Gil Gilbertson.\n\nGP Officer Kevin Blaich.\n\nGP Community Service Officer Lyle Brown.\n\nJo Co Officer Ernie Fields.\n\nGP Officer Scott Hyde.\n\nK-9 officer Jeff Gaunt.\n\nFAVORITE MUSIC INSTRUCTOR\n\nFrom the mating calls of crickets to the piano concertos of Chopin, music has been soothing souls since the beginning of time. Where to go when you want to join the music? Our readers were most often impressed with the work of Laura Boldon, who is the Orchestra Music Director at Grants Pass High School.\n\nAlso receiving lots of votes were:\n\nPaul Hendershott, guitar.\n\nJoann Pilcher.\n\nLarry Cavalier.\n\nFAVORITE DANCE INSTRUCTOR\n\nIn lieu of dancing the Hayden Tango my entire life, I’m tempted to take at least one dance lesson to learn some basic steps. Dance, however, comes in all sizes and shapes, and our readers were most impressed with the work of Penny King at Stillpoint Dance Studio.\n\nFilling out the list were:\n\nKristen de Bellis of All That Jazz.\n\nNancy Gordon.\n\nLori Cangilose.\n\nChris, a Zumba teacher at Curves.\n\nFAVORITE LOCAL RESTAURANT OWNER\n\nGrants Pass has had a renaissance in restaurants over the last ten years, and we can thank a strong cadre of dedicated restaurant owners for that. Fifteen different people were mentioned in this category, with the top spot going to Tim and Sandra Mock at Aja (which is now located at 2030 NW Vine) and Cucina Mista (where Aja used to be at 118 NW E).\n\nOthers mentioned a lot were:\n\nBob and Darla Feil at Train Depot.\n\nGwen and Tawni Hendricks of The Vine.\n\nDave Thomason of Taprock and Elmer’s.\n\nChris Parker at Herb’s LaCasita.\n\nKeturah Alger at Laughing Clam.\n\nBret Musselman of 115 Broiler.\n\nStephanie Jones of Circle J.\n\nFAVORITE WAITPERSON\n\nThey say that ocean fishermen, loggers, aircraft pilots, ranchers and roofers have the five most dangerous jobs in the world, but those guys wouldn’t last a week as a waitperson. They’d buckle under the pressure and would go back to their day jobs.\n\nThis is another popular category, as our readers mentioned 25 different waitstaff as their favorite. Taking down the top nod was Debbie Kelly at Herb’s LaCasita, followed by:\n\nMelissa Carnes at Train Depot.\n\nMarci Fenton at The Vine.\n\nDotti Kochis at 115 Broiler.\n\nDebbie Hamblin at the Powderhorn.\n\nKaren Brown at Elmer’s.\n\nShelly Chapman at the Mediterranean Bar & Grill.\n\nJoe Gomez of G Street Bar & Grill.\n\nFAVORITE BARTENDER\n\nSo a hotdog walks into a bar and orders a beer. The bartender replies, “Sorry, we don’t serve food here.” Or … a gorilla walks into a bar and orders a beer. The bartender gives him a mug and says, “That’ll be five bucks.” As the gorilla reaches for his pocket the bartender says, “You know, we don’t get many gorilla customers in here.” The gorilla shrugged and replied, “At five bucks a beer, it’s no wonder.”\n\nWhere do our readers go when they want to hear great jokes like that? The competition was intense, but in the end Marty Thomas of Blondie’s pulled out the win.\n\nOther popular bartenders are:\n\nWillie Evans of the Wonder Bur.\n\nKari Musselman of 115 Broiler.\n\nBob Lewis of The Cedarwood.\n\nFAVORITE CHEF\n\nThey rarely make an appearance except at the end of the night when the customers gives them a standing ovation, but it’s the chef in the kitchen that makes or breaks a restaurant. Quite a few were mentioned by our readers, and the top nod goes to both Justin Gibson of 115 Broiler and Dennis Hanson of Taprock Northwest Grill.\n\nAlso mentioned a lot were:\n\nSandy Mock at Aja.\n\nGordon Pitts at The Vine.\n\nBruno Jappert of Morrison’s Lodge.\n\nCUTEST PET\n\nIt was a tough decision this year, but Bonnie (the dog) and Cosette (the cat), belonging to the Drevets family, were named “cutest pets” by our expert panel of judges, followed by:\n\nTurbo the dog.\n\nFluffy the dog.\n\nHunter the cat.\n\nStevie the cat.\n\nBly the dog.\n\nFAVORITE NUTRITION COUNSELOR\n\nStaying healthy, or even recovering from an illness, can be as simple as eating the right things. Where do our readers recommend we go to get the right advice? Number one on their list was Danielle Wirkkala of “the new well,” a weight loss and wellness center at Club Northwest.\n\nAlso receiving their fair share of votes as “Favorite Nutrition Counselor” were:\n\nRob Pell at Sunshine Natural Foods.\n\nRay Spencer at The Herb Shop.\n\nDiane Seehawer.\n\nCynthia O’Dell.\n\nFAVORITE LANDSCAPER/GARDENER\n\nGetting your yard and garden looking good may require a little bit of work, but at the end of the day it’s all worth it. Living in a beautiful surrounding can work wonders for your soul.\n\nAnd when our readers want some uplifting work done in their yard, they most often turned to Jack Sutters of All American City Landscaping, followed by:\n\nRené Paré of Mountain View Landscaping.\n\nRandy Furtado.\n\nGrow’s Landscape Maintenance.\n\nTed Smith of Fall River Landscaping.\n\nFAVORITE CARPET CLEANERS\n\nYour daughter gave you a puppy for Christmas, and it took over two months to train the darling little animal not to do its thing on the carpet. Now that he knows to scratch at the door when nature calls, who do you call to have the carpets cleaned? Taking down the number one spot in the category was Al’s Carpet Cleaning & Restoration.\n\nThey were followed closely in the balloting by:\n\nKleen-Masters.\n\nK&L Chem Dry.\n\nAll Pro Carpet Cleaning.\n\nStanley Steemer.\n\nAmerican Carpet Cleaning.\n\nFAVORITE HOUSE CLEANERS\n\nYeah, that party you threw at the house for all your buddies from work was fun, but now you have to get the house clean before your significant other gets back from that seminar. Who to call? Our readers were able to name a few, including the number one choice, Peggy Best of Helping Hands.\n\nOthers on the list included:\n\nMiracle Workers.\n\nThe Cleaning Crew.\n\nMolly’s Cleaning Service.\n\nSouthern Oregon Cleaning Services.\n\nFAVORITE STORE DOWNTOWN\n\nThere’s talk of creating a “plaza” in downtown Grants Pass, and while it sounds like a good idea, I’m not sure of the logistics. Where would they place it? G Street would be the most obvious choice since that is the historic “downtown,” but how would it work? This may require a little more thought.\n\nIn the meantime, our readers mentioned 27 stores downtown that they thought were doing a good job. Winning this category again was The Kitchen Company, which recently moved across the street to 301 SE 6th.\n\nThe Top Ten were:\n\nNever a Bum Steer.\n\nGrants Pass Pharmacy.\n\nGates Furniture.\n\nShop River Rock.\n\nListen Here Music.\n\nPrimrose Lane.\n\nBlind George’s.\n\nLa Bella Casa.\n\nTierra del Sol.\n\nSavannah Faire.\n\nFAVORITE STORE OUTSIDE DOWNTOWN\n\nOkay, Fred Meyer’s, Wal-Mart and Bi-Mart all got their share of votes, but we were looking for the smaller, more intimate stores that reflect the community. Winning that category was Emilia’s Closet, located at 1545 NE F in Parkway Village.\n\nAlso mentioned a lot were:\n\nRogue River Florist.\n\nThe Dollar Store.\n\nBath Thyme.\n\nFashion Bug.\n\nJudy’s Florist & Gifts.\n\nDan’l Boone’s Trading Post.\n\nJan’s Hallmark Store.\n\nProbst Flower Shop.\n\nJC Penney’s.\n\nRoley’s Pacific Supply.\n\nGIFT STORE WITH MOST UNIQUE GIFTS\n\nVariety is the spice of life, and when our readers want to find a lot of different, interesting gifts, they once again turned their attention to the selection at Hellgate’s River Rock Gift Shop, located at 966 SW 6th Street.\n\nThe list also included:\n\nNever a Bum Steer.\n\nSavannah Faire.\n\nJan’s Hallmark.\n\nReal Deals.\n\nElegance.\n\nTierra del Sol.\n\nGrants Pass Pharmacy.\n\nOregon Store.\n\nBEST STORE TO SHOP FOR MOTHER’S DAY\n\nIf it’s something you want to buy for Mom, our readers most often turned to both The Kitchen Company and Grants Pass Pharmacy, with River Rock and Savannah Faire not far behind.\n\nTOY STORE WITH MOST UNIQUE GIFTS\n\nWhile toys are a great way to keep kids occupied, they’re also meant to help teach them how the world works. From Legos to Barbie dolls, they’re a microcosm of the real world.\n\nWhile a lot of readers mentioned Wal-Mart and Toys R Us in the survey, the most support was shown for Cat & the Fiddle, located at the corner of 5th and G, and Sleadd’s Adventure Depot at 420 SW 6th,\n\nBEST PLACE TO BUY FURNITURE FOR YARD/GARDEN\n\nAn ideal yard/garden would be an extension of the house, complete with chairs, tables, pottery, statuaries, the works. Where to go when you want to properly outfit that extra “room?” Many people picked Fred Meyer’s in this category, followed by:\n\nDiamond Home Improvement.\n\nChet’s Garden Center.\n\nGates Furniture.\n\nWal-Mart.\n\nChris Hart Studio.\n\nRedwood Nursery.\n\nBEST PLACE TO BUY FLAT SCREEN TVs\n\nThose big, ol’ hunker TV sets may be a thing of the past. We just bought a flat screen TV, and I carried it with one hand. To replace the old one required two people to safely lift it. Technology is a wonderful thing, especially on backs.\n\nAnyway, the votes were spread out fairly evenly on this category between four different stores:\n\nWal-Mart.\n\nPhoto Den.\n\nFred Meyer’s.\n\nCostCo.\n\nBEST PLACE TO BUY STUFF FOR SWIMMING POOL/SPA\n\nAh, nothing like jumping in the pool on a hot summer day … and relaxing in the spa late at night to soothe those aching bones. And when our readers wanted to make sure the pool/spa were in tip-top shape, they chose the friendly confines of both Jerry’s Pool/Spa (555 NE F) and Paradise Pool & Spa Supplies at 1578 NE 7th.\n\nOthers mentioned were:\n\nAction Pools & Spas.\n\nWal-Mart.\n\nGrants Pass Pool Service & Sales.\n\nFred Meyer’s.\n\nBEST STORAGE UNITS\n\nThe ability of the average human being to collect “stuff” knows no bounds. Once the attic, garage, basement and off-shore safe deposit boxes are filled up, we’re forced to turn to storage units. And trust me, it doesn’t take long.\n\nWhen and if that day happens, our readers had few suggestions, starting with Parkway Mini Storage, a state-of-the-art facility located at 1100 SE Milbank Road.\n\nThe list also featured:\n\nLee’s Mini Storage.\n\nMill Street Mini Storage.\n\nBooth Street Self Storage.\n\nA+ Mini Storage.\n\nFoothill Mini Storage.\n\nBEST SELECTION OF WOMEN’S CLOTHES\n\nI really doubt if Lady Gaga is going to talk many women into wearing some of the crazy stuff she comes up with, like a dress with Christmas tree bulbs flashing all around it. Fashion for most women is just a little more functional than that.\n\nAnd when it comes to shopping for women’s clothes, our readers named quite a few places, starting with Emilia’s Closet and Fred Meyer’s, and followed by:\n\nJC Penney’s.\n\nFashion Bug.\n\nTierra del sol.\n\nRoss Store.\n\nVan Olpton’s Boutique.\n\nGoodwill Store.\n\nBEST SELECTION OF MEN’S CLOTHES\n\nIf there’s a Lady Gaga, where’s Mr. Gaga? And what does he wear, an outfit with the heads of golf clubs glued to it?\n\nAnyway, when it comes to men’s clothes, our readers most often chose Fred Meyer’s, with the rest of the votes spread out evenly between:\n\nJC Penney’s.\n\nWal-Mart.\n\nRoss Store.\n\nRoley’s Pacific Supply.\n\nGoodwill.\n\nBEST PLACE TO BUY SHOES\n\nThe first time a caveman wrapped a piece of mastodon leather around his feet, a huge technological leap occurred in the history of mankind. Today, we now obsess over our shoes (just ask Imelda Marcos), and luckily our readers can direct you to two stores downtown which are right next to each other: Norris Shoes at 133 SW G, and Never a Bum Steer at 125 SW G.\n\nThe list also included:\n\nFamous Footwear.\n\nFred Meyer’s.\n\nVan Olpton’s.\n\nShoes Right Here.\n\nWal-Mart.\n\nBEST PLACE TO BUY EARRINGS\n\nJewelry is the spice of life, and earrings are a perfect accent, almost like bookends to the unique human face. And where to go for those perfect bookends? Our readers were able to name 15 different places, starting with Hart Jewelers downtown.\n\nAlso mentioned a lot were:\n\nKing Jewelers.\n\nNever a Bum Steer.\n\nJC Penny’s.\n\nRue 21.\n\nFashion Bug.\n\nBead Merchant.\n\nShop River Rock.\n\nHARDEST WORKING FLORISTS\n\nWhen you think about it, every flower we see was once growing wild in the woods and valleys. It is one of mankind’s accomplishments that we have taken the best and brightest from the plant kingdom and turned them into beautiful bouquets.\n\nShowing their appreciation, our readers voted Judy’s Grants Pass Florist & Gifts as their favorite this year. The votes were, however, very close, and they included:\n\nRogue River Florist.\n\nProbst Flower Shop.\n\nChet’s Garden & Pet Center.\n\nAlbertson’s\n\nBEST PLACE TO BUY FLOWERS/SHRUBS FOR THE GARDEN\n\nA garden is not just something beautiful to behold but is home to a myriad of animals, from birds and spiders to ladybugs and butterflies. With a little creativity, you can also keep the “bad” animals out without resorting to a lot of pesticides.\n\nRunning away with this category again was Chet’s Garden Center at 229 SW “H” Street, which also offers expert advice and follow-up service.\n\nThe list included:\n\nGreenleaf Greenhouse.\n\nMurphy Country Nursery.\n\nThe Grange Co-Op.\n\nFred Meyer’s.\n\nRedwood Nursery.\n\nDiamond Home Improvement.\n\nBi-Mart.\n\nSandy’s Nursery.\n\nBEST PLACE TO GET FAMILY NEWSLETTER PRINTED\n\nSure, you can just slap something together and have a hundred copies made of your annual family newsletter, but what fun is that? You need a printer who can help you find graphics, maybe assist in laying it out, and then printing it up on full-color glossy paper. Now we’re talkin’!\n\nAnd in that regard, our readers picked both Martin’s Design & Print Studio (111 SE G) and Ray’s Printshop (405 Union Avenue) as their favorites.\n\nThey were followed by:\n\nApple Press.\n\nMacGraphically Yours.\n\nLogan Design.\n\nStaples.\n\nGROCERY STORE WITH FRIENDLIEST CHECKERS\n\nGrocery shopping is actually a social event, as you will regularly run into friends and acquaintances, exchanging hugs and war stories in the aisles. The checkers are like the emcees, keeping everything running smoothly and making sure there are no party crashers.\n\nWho do our readers think have the friendliest checkers? The competition was tough among the top four, with Safeway eking out a win, followed by:\n\nAlbertson’s.\n\nFred Meyer’s.\n\nRay’s Food Place.\n\nGrocery Outlet.\n\nGooseberries.\n\nBridge Street Market.\n\nBEST PLACE TO BUY/RENT SCUBA EQUIPMENT\n\nPut on the scuba equipment and head to the bottom of the ocean, and you are literally in another world. It is almost an out-of-the-body experience, and our readers appreciate the efforts of both Coral Sea Scuba and Sundance Divers, which received all the votes in this category.\n\nBEST PLACE TO BUY “STUFF” FOR THE KITCHEN\n\nYes, you could sit and watch the Food Channel all day and fantasize about becoming an Iron Chef … or you could just go out and stock your kitchen with all the “stuff” necessary to make that happen. And according to our readers, the best place to start would be The Kitchen Company, located downtown at 212 SW 6th, which overwhelmingly won this event again.\n\nOthers on the list were:\n\nWal-Mart.\n\nFred Meyer’s.\n\nBEST PLACE TO BUY HERBS/SUPPLEMENTS\n\nIf you want to stay healthy the natural way, I would recommend researching all the available literature for the best combination of herbs and supplements for your particular body type and lifestyle. My favorite is drdavidwilliams.com.\n\nWhere to go locally? Most readers mentioned The Herb Shop at the corner of 5th & G, with Sunshine Natural Foods at 128 SW H as their favorites.\n\nAlso included were:\n\nFarmer’s Market.\n\nFred Meyer’s.\n\nthe new well.\n\nBEST PLACE TO GET YOUR BOAT SERVICED\n\nWhether out fishing or just relaxing on the lake, your boat can quickly become your best friend. What to do you when your little buddy is ailing? A lot of people called Lewis Enterprises at 214 NE Hillcrest, where Boatnik legend Jeff Lewis runs the show, and Rogue River Boat Shop at 1815 SW Bridge Street.\n\nFAVORITE GAS STATION\n\nIt wasn’t shocking to me to learn that the reason for the recent high gas prices is because speculators back in New York have been driving the price up. I mean, these are the same kind of people who caused the housing bubble/crash, and as long as they can make some quick short term profit, they couldn’t care less what happens to the rest of us.\n\nWhew! It was good to get that off my chest. Now I think I’ll go fill up the car. Where would our readers recommend? The top choice this year was the station at Fred Meyer’s, just off the GP Parkway.\n\nThe list also featured:\n\nAlbertson’s.\n\nThe ARCO Station at 7th & “M.”\n\nLarry Henderson’s “A” Street Chevron.\n\nFairgrounds Shell.\n\nLonnie’s Shell.\n\nChevron Station on Redwood Highway.\n\nFAVORITE STORE IN MEDFORD/ASHLAND\n\nYes, Virginia, sometimes it is good to get out of good ol’ Grants Pass and visit the rest of the world. And when our readers take the precipitous leap of visiting our neighbors to the south, where do they most like to go? For the tenth year in a row, the runaway winner of this event was CostCo, followed by:\n\nMacy’s at the Mall.\n\nTarget.\n\nBarnes & Noble in Medford.\n\nLowe’s in Medford.\n\nPaddington Station in Ashland.\n\nKohl’s in the Mall.\n\nDeja Vu in Ashland.\n\nPOLITICS\n\nFAVORITE CITY COUNCILOR\n\nThis is always a fun category because at almost every meeting the eight City Councilors stick their necks out and take stands on local issues that they feel are important. Like society at large, there is rarely a unanimous decision, and that is a good thing.\n\nIt was also good to see that all eight councilor received votes in this category, and we will list the top four here:\n\nKris Wodburn.\n\nDan DeYoung.\n\nRichard Michelon.\n\nRick Riker.\n\nFAVORITE COUNTY COMMISSIONER\n\nDwight Ellis certainly threw county government a curveball when he decided to announce his early retirement a couple of months ago. Out of fairness, he removed himself from the debate on whom to replace him, but after the other two commissioners, Simon Hare and Sandi Cassanelli, couldn’t agree on a candidate, he volunteered to help out. It only makes sense. Who better to decide what candidate would best represent his views than Ellis himself?\n\nAmazingly, this category ended in an exact tie between Dwight Ellis and Simon Hare. Even more amazing … former commissioner Dave Toler garnered more votes than Sandi Cassanelli.\n\nMOST EFFICIENT CITY OFFICE/DEPARTMENT\n\nGovernment employees have been taking a beating in the media lately, but seriously, they’re there to do jobs that we hired them for, and they take it very seriously. So cut them some slack!\n\nThis year, our readers with most impressed with the efforts of the Grants Pass Public Safety Department, which is responsible for both police and fire. They were followed by:\n\nParks Department.\n\nWater Department.\n\nCommunity Development.\n\nAdministration.\n\nMOST EFFICIENT OFFICE/DEPARTMENT IN COUNTY\n\nOn the County side of the ledger, the ballots ended up in a tie between the Sheriff’s Office, which has to operate under a greatly reduced budget, and the County Clerk, which runs the local elections very efficiently.\n\nOthers mentioned were:\n\nPublic Health.\n\nParks Department.\n\nPlanning.\n\nPublic Works\n\nThe Library, which actually is now run by a nonprofit group, was also recognized.\n\nA VERY UNSCIENTIFIC POLITICAL POLL\n\nAh … my favorite part of the Best of the Rogue Valley. Being a political animal and having worked for a market research company in Denver for 14 years, I always find these answers fascinating. So let’s get it on …\n\n1. Do you support a specialized sales tax in Grants Pass? This idea was broached by staff last winter after the City Council asked them to find permanent funding for the Department of Public Safety. Unfortunately, it is so riddled with loopholes, restrictions and exceptions that not a whole lot of people took it seriously, our readers included.\n\nYes, good idea: 11%\n\nNo, bad idea: 89%\n\nShould the cell tower in northwest Grants Pass have been approved? This also came to the City Council last winter, as AT&T wanted to put a 90-foot cell tower in a field off Hawthorne Street directly across from a residential neighborhood. The local residents naturally complained, but to no avail as the City Council approved the siting. The case is being appealed to LUBA, but apparently not everyone in town agrees with the neighbors.\n\nYes, it should have been approved: 61%\n\nNo, it should not have: 39%\n\nShould people who disrupt public meetings be asked to leave? You’d think in a civilized society, this wouldn’t have to be asked, but some people just don’t know how to be civil. I’d name names, but I’m pretty sure you know who you are.\n\nYes, they should be asked to leave: 86%\n\nNo, they should not: 14%\n\nAre the County Commissioners doing a good job? There’s a lot of turmoil right now surrounding a replacement for retiring Dwight Ellis, but have the commissioners been generally taking care of business? Our readers had mixed feelings.\n\nYes, doing a good job: 52%\n\nNo, they’re not: 48%\n\nPatience is one of those virtues that every loyal reader of the Sneak Preview learns to cultivate at least once a year. It’s been a long five weeks since Part I of the “Best of the Rogue Valley” was published, and we’re glad to report that everyone waited patiently and there were no incidents of rioting or looting in Josephine County (as opposed to what happened when “The Best of London” came out a little late).\n\nBut enough of this long-winded introduction. Let’s move onto the real stuff—Part II of the “Best of the Rogue Valley,” featuring restaurants and entertainment. As always, multiple ties will be awarded in any category where the votes had a difference of five or less at the top.\n\nRESTAURANTS\n\nBEST NEW RESTAURANT\n\nAs opposed to last year when only three new restaurants popped up in Josephine County, this year there were EIGHT! Who said there was a recession, anyway? I think the media is just making it all up.\n\nTaking down the top spot for 2011 was an exact tie between Hannah’s Restaurant, featuring authentic Southern cooking at the corner of 5th & H; and Black Bear Diner, which opened at 1900 NW 6th Street, right near the Caveman Statue.\n\nComing in a close third was Chik-n-Rib, located at 407 NE 7th, followed by:\n\nCucina Mista (118 NW E), Sandy and Tim Mock’s Italian Restaurant located where Aja used to be.\n\nPapa’s Smokin’ BBQ (1720 Redwood Avenue).\n\nFour Seasons at 122 K Street.\n\nPita Pit (330 NE Beacon).\n\nCowboy Camp Café, located at 221 SW G.\n\nBEST PLACE TO MEET FRIENDS FOR BREAKFAST\n\nWhen you wake up and your stomach is already growling, you know it’s time to have some breakfast. And the best way to drown out the rumblings from down under is good conversation with friends.\n\nWhere do our readers go in that regard? This year was a 3-way tie between the Powderhorn Café at 321 NE 6th; Elmer’s Restaurant (175 NE Agness), and Black Bear Diner.\n\nIt was a vicious battle for the top, however, and other popular restaurants included:\n\nTrain Depot, located at 577 NE F.\n\nThe Gold Miner Restaurant at 786 SE 7th.\n\nTaprock Northwest Grill (971 SE 6th).\n\nShari’s, at 190 NE Agness.\n\nThe Black Forest, at 820 NE E.\n\nTee Time, at 117 SE H.\n\nHerb’s LaCasita, at 515 SE Rogue River Highway.\n\nDella’s, located at 1802 NW 6th.\n\nBEST PLACE TO MEET FRIENDS FOR LUNCH\n\nThis was probably the most popular category in the restaurant section of this survey, as 34 different establishments were named. Lunch apparently is one of those times when we love to socialize (“let’s do lunch,” etc.) and get out of the house.\n\nTopping the list for 2011 was Taprock Northwest Grill at 971 SE 6th, which has attracted quite a loyal lunch following in the last two years.\n\nI’ll admit that the Top Five were very close, and they included:\n\nThe Train Depot.\n\nCircle J Café (located at 241 SW “G).\n\nRosso’s Delicatessen at 225 SE 6th.\n\nWild River Brewing & Pizza Company, at 595 NE “E.”\n\nOthers featured a lot were:\n\nBlack Bear Diner.\n\nDella’s.\n\nElmer’s.\n\nThe Powderhorn Café.\n\nLaughing Clam, at 121 SE “G.”\n\nMediterranean Bar & Grill at 219 SW G.\n\nBEST STEAK & EGGS\n\nThey say you’re supposed to load up on protein at breakfast. If that’s really the case, then steak & eggs is the perfect meal. And in that regard, our readers named both Train Depot and Black Bear Diner as their favorites.\n\nComing in a close third was Elmer’s, followed by:\n\nHerb’s LaCasita.\n\nTee Time.\n\nShari’s.\n\nGold Miner’s Restaurant.\n\nPowderhorn Café.\n\nBEST REUBEN SANDWICH\n\nAt chef school, they actually give degrees in Reubenology, because this isn’t just any ordinary pastrami sandwich … it’s a Reuben.\n\nWhich restaurant went to the top of the class this year with regard to this sandwich? Most of our readers saved their accolades for both 115 Broiler, located at 117 NE D Street; and Circle J Café.\n\nOther top Rueben sandwiches included:\n\nTaprock Northwest Grill\n\nRosso’s.\n\nApplebee’s.\n\nBluestone Bakery at corner of 6th and D.\n\nFAVORITE DINNERHOUSE\n\nGoing out for dinner can be a cause for celebration or for just wanting to get out of the house. Either way, diners in the Rogue Valley have a great selection to choose from. Ending in a tie for first were Aja, at 2030 NW Vine; Taprock Northwest Grill (971 SE 6th); and 115 Broiler, at 115 NW D.\n\nAlso mentioned a lot were:\n\nThe Vine, located at 1610 Allen Creek Road.\n\nSummer Jo’s, at 2315 Upper River Road Loop.\n\nLaughing Clam.\n\nR-Haus, located at 2140 Rogue River Highway.\n\nBlondie’s Bistro (226 SW G).\n\nHannah’s Restaurant.\n\nMOST ROMANTIC RESTAURANT FOR LUNCH\n\nWhen it comes to romantic lunch spots, you don’t need Edith Piaf at the piano singing “La Vie en Rose,” but you do want an ambiance that isn’t all hectic and stressful.\n\nAnd when it comes to that, our readers named both The Vine (1610 Allen Creek Road) and Summer Jo’s 2315 Upper River Road Loop) as their number one choice.\n\nBlondie’s Bistro, at 226 SW G, was also mentioned a lot, followed by:\n\nTaprock Northwest Grill.\n\nRosso’s.\n\nHannah’s.\n\nMediterranean Bar & Grill.\n\nMOST ROMANTIC RESTAURANT FOR DINNER\n\nSometimes, instead of sitting there and checking out the scores on Sports Center with one eye, you want to gaze lovingly into the eyes of your significant other and talk about important things, like the Yankees/Red Sox series … just kidding.\n\nIn this category, our readers named both The Vine and Hannah’s Restaurant as being particularly romantic.\n\nThe Top Nine were actually pretty close, and they included:\n\nSummer Jo’s.\n\n115 Broiler.\n\nTaprock Northwest Grill.\n\nAja.\n\nR-Haus.\n\nBlondie’s.\n\nMorrison’s Lodge, located at 8500 Galice Road.\n\nBEST STEAK DINNERS ON MENU\n\nI went on the Internet to check out the leading cattle producers in the world and was shocked to see that India led the way. I always thought cows were sacred in India, and that they could practically get elected president if only they had the right slogan. “Got milk?” would be a good one.\n\nAnyway, when the slogan becomes “Where’s the beef?” our readers once again named 115 Broiler, located at 115 NW D, as their number one choice, followed by:\n\nApplebee’s.\n\nBlondie’s Bistro.\n\nR- Haus.\n\nSizzler.\n\nTrain Depot.\n\nRogue Riviera (outside Gold Hill).\n\nBEST SEAFOOD DISHES ON MENU\n\nOceans cover 75% of the world, and it’s almost amazing that humans are notoriously close to depleting some of the fish stock. I mean, a single (or married) cod produces 9 million eggs per spawning season, and we have somehow depleted them. As a species, we border on being idiots.\n\nWhen it comes to enjoying some great seafood, though, our readers are pretty smart, naming both Aja and the Laughing Clam, at 121 SW G, as their favorites.\n\nAlso mentioned a lot were:\n\n115 Broiler.\n\nSummer Jo’s.\n\nTaprock Northwest Grill.\n\nThe Vine.\n\nHannah’s.\n\nR-Haus.\n\nBEST PASTA DISHES ON MENU\n\nPasta comes in a variety of different shapes and is basically unleavened dough of wheat, flour, water, and sometimes eggs. Add some meat and sauces to it, and it borders on being a perfect dish.\n\nWhere do our readers go to seek perfection? This year they chose the friendly confines of both The Vine, in the Allen Creek Shopping Center; and Cucina Mista at 118 NE D, as their favorites.\n\nOther favorite pasta providers were:\n\nThe Bistro, at 1214 NW 6th.\n\nRosso’s.\n\nTaprock Northwest Grill.\n\nThe Train Depot.\n\nG Street Bar & Grill.\n\n115 Broiler.\n\nApplebee’s.\n\nSummer Jo’s.\n\nBEST SOUPS AND SALADS\n\nThey can either accompany a meal or be a meal unto themselves, so what more could you ask for? Our readers didn’t mess around, as they named Rosso’s Delicatessen at 225 SE 6th as their favorite, followed by:\n\nCircle J Café.\n\nTrain Depot.\n\nBlondie’s.\n\nTaprock.\n\nSummer Jo’s.\n\nShari’s.\n\nElmer’s.\n\nBluestone Bakery.\n\nBEST CHICKEN DISHES ON MENU\n\nMy daughter got up this morning and complained that someone ate all the eggs, so I simply went out to the chicken coop and collected four of them. Having chickens comes in handy at times. I also showed the eggs to our dog, Brody, and said, “Some pets pull their weight around this house.” He felt guilty, then went out and retrieved the morning paper for me. Now we’re talkin’, boy!\n\nWhere to go when you’re hungry for a really great chicken dish? Topping the charts this year was a tie between Applebee’s and Taprock Northwest Grill.\n\nThey were followed by:\n\nRosso’s.\n\nHannah’s.\n\nThe Vine.\n\nSummer Jo’s.\n\nAja.\n\nFAVORITE MEXICAN RESTAURANT\n\nIt’s a slice of Mexico City every time you walk into a Mexican restaurant here in the Rogue Valley. Not just the cuisine, but the atmosphere and the staff combine to make it a fun, south-of-the-border experience without the expensive plane ticket.\n\nAll of the local Mexican-style establishments were mentioned this year, and winning this category was Casa Amiga, located at 1720 Redwood Avenue.\n\nComing in a close second was Si Casa Flores at 202 Beacon Drive, with Taqueria Mexico (137 SE H), placing third.\n\nThe list also included:\n\nEl Patron (799 Rogue River Highway).\n\nTacos Locos in the Allen Creek Shopping Center.\n\nLa Burrita, at 941 SE 7th.\n\nEl Paraiso, located at 201 E. Park Street.\n\nAngela’s Hacienda, which recently reopened at 111 NE Hillcrest.\n\nKalypsso Latin Cuisine, at 775 SE 6th.\n\nLas Fajitas, in Parkway Village.\n\nBEST CHILE RELLENOS\n\nThis is a dish that originated in the city of Puebla, which is also famous for being the site of the battle on Cinco de Mayo, 1862, when the Mexican army kicked butt on the French. You take a roasted pepper (Poblano, Anaheim, pasilla or jalapeño) and stuff it with all kinds of interesting things, and voilà (excuse my French), the end result is exquisite.\n\nWhere to go for great chile rellenos? Our readers most often named Si Casa Flores and Casa Amiga, followed by:\n\nTaqueira Mexico.\n\nEl Paraiso.\n\nEl Patron.\n\nLa Burrita.\n\nBEST MARGARITAS\n\nA lot of Mexican bartenders try to take credit for this cocktail, but it probably got its start as the “Daisy” during Prohibition in the U.S. The drink was remade with tequila instead of brandy. Margarita, by the way, is Spanish for the word “daisy.”\n\nWhere to go for that perfect daisy? Our readers once again were most impressed with the margaritas at Si Casa Flores, although quite a few people raved about the concoctions at Angela’s Hacienda, which has returned to the scene after a few years off.\n\nOther favorites include:\n\nTaqueira Mexico.\n\nCasa Amiga.\n\nLa Burrita.\n\nEl Paraiso.\n\nLas Fajitas.\n\nHerb’s LaCasita.\n\nFAVORITE ASIAN RESTAURANT\n\nThe first “Asians” crossed over into America about 25,000 years ago via the Bering Strait, setting up their first sushi restaurant at an Eskimo village in Alaska. Since then, the Rogue Valley has seen a proliferation of outstanding Asian restaurants, covering the full spectrum of choices.\n\nTaking down the number one spot this year was the triumvirate of Pongsri’s, a Thai restaurant in its new location at 323 NE E; Hunan Garden, located in the Grants Pass Shopping Center; and Hong Kong, at 820 NW 6th.\n\nOther favorites included:\n\nMatsukaze, located at 1675 NE 7th.\n\nThai BBQ at 428 SW 6th.\n\nMusashi Sushi Bar & Japanese Cuisine, located at 314 SE H.\n\nRoyal Barge, at 120 SW H.\n\nSunflower Thai Cuisine (1571 NE 6th).\n\nChina Buffet, at 144 SE 7th.\n\nFour Seasons at 122 SE K.\n\nAja (2030 NW Vine).\n\nA Taste of China (211 NE A).\n\nChina Hut (1434 NW 6th).\n\nShiki Sushi Bar, at 125 SE G.\n\nBEST THAI DISHES\n\nWhen you break it down into restaurants that cater to Thai cuisine, this ended in a tie between Thai BBQ and Pongsri’s, although I am happy to report that Royal Barge and Sunflower also have a huge cadre of loyal and happy followers.\n\nBEST JAPANESE DISHES\n\nI’m still mad at Japan for beating our women’s soccer team in the World Cup last month, but how can you stay mad at a country that just suffered a devastating earthquake, tsunami, and the breakdown of a nuclear power plant? You can’t, so you go, Japan!\n\nHere in the Rogue Valley, our readers definitely love their Japanese-style restaurants, once again naming Matzukaze as their favorite, followed by:\n\nMusashi.\n\nShiki’s.\n\nAja.\n\nFAVORITE ITALIAN RESTAURANT\n\nPoor Italy. It’s one of the most beautiful and fun countries in the world, and they have a president who controls most of the newspapers and TV stations and who messes around with underage girls. I mean, at least Monica was 24-years-old, dude.\n\nWe all love our Italian restaurants, however, and in this category our readers named The Vine as their number one favorite. This category was actually very close between the Top Five, which included:\n\nThe Bistro.\n\nCucina Mista.\n\nRosso’s Delicatessen.\n\nOlive Garden in Medford.\n\nBEST SELECTION OF PIZZAS\n\nWatching a video of professional pizza makers is fascinating stuff. They roll the dough around in their hands to make a huge pie, then literally throw it 20 feet in the air, catching it behind their backs, etc.\n\nHere in the Rogue Valley, our pizza guys don’t get that crazy, but they do make some mean pizza. Topping the charts this year was Abby’s Legendary Pizza (in the Williams Plaza and on NE Beacon), although the competition was pretty tough between the top four, which included:\n\nPapa Murphy’s (1011 NE 7th and 263 Rogue River Hwy).\n\nWild River Brewing Co., located at 595 NE E.\n\nCircle J Café.\n\nOthers mentioned a lot were:\n\nPapa John’s, located at 107 SW 4th.\n\nThe Bistro.\n\nThe Vine.\n\nFigaro’s.\n\nDomino’s.\n\nBaldini’s in Merlin.\n\nBEST BUFFET/SALAD BAR\n\nSometimes looking over a menu can be stressful. The names and descriptions all seem to blend together in your left brain, and what you need is to see what you’re going to be eating. That’s where a buffet and salad bar comes in handy … by going straight to the source.\n\nFor our readers, this category once again ended as a tie between J.J. North’s, located at 1150 NE E in the Grants Pass Shopping Center, and Sizzler, at 1871 NE 7th.\n\nAlso mentioned a lot were China Buffet and Abby’s Pizza.\n\nBEST VEGETARIAN DISHES\n\nHuman beings are natural omnivores, but for a long time the only food items we regularly had access to were vegetables and fruit, so we probably lean toward that orientation (although a balanced diet that includes some carnivorous delights is not a bad thing).\n\nMany restaurants in the Rogue Valley offer vegetarian dishes to complement their omnivorous menu, with Blondie’s Bistro and The Vine receiving a lot of attention from our readers.\n\nAlso mentioned were Abu’s Oasis Deli, located at 1330 NW 6th Street; and Sunshine Natural Foods at 128 SW H, followed by:\n\nCircle J Café.\n\nThai BBQ.\n\nRosso’s.\n\nPongsri’s.\n\nBEST RESTAURANT TO TAKE THE ENTIRE FAMILY\n\n“Get that ol’ station wagon loaded up, and let’s head out to dinner!” Grandpa said one night after scratching off 300 lottery tickets. “I just won $74, and the treat’s on me.”\n\nWhere to go when Grandpa strikes it rich? This one ended up as a tie between Black Bear Diner on the north end, and Wild River on F Street.\n\nThe list also included:\n\nTaprock Northwest Grill\n\nJJ North’s.\n\nSizzler.\n\nElmer’s.\n\nTrain Depot.\n\nDella’s.\n\nBEST BBQ DISHES\n\nI was at a restaurant a few years ago and got to hear an argument about what was better—Texas-style barbecue or North Carolina barbecue. It got pretty heated, and I thought they were going to take it outside, but someone across the room offered to buy them a couple of shots of bourbon if they’d shut up, and they went for it. Then they argued about what was better—Kentucky Bourbon or Tennessee Whiskey. You can’t win!\n\nOur readers certainly appreciate the efforts of our local barbecue providers, reserving their number one choice for Chik-n-Rib, which recently opened at 405 NE 7th. They were followed by:\n\nPapa’s Smokehouse on Redwood Avenue.\n\nHannah’s Restaurant.\n\nLeo’s BBQ.\n\nTrain Depot.\n\nRESTAURANT WITH MOST EXOTIC MENU\n\nIt’s always fun to step outside the box and create a menu with a little more flair, something that you don’t find everywhere. And in that regard, our readers were most impressed with the selection at Hannah’s Restaurant, with its concentration on authentic Southern cooking; and the Mediterranean Bar & Grill, with offerings from southern Europe.\n\nAlso mentioned a lot were:\n\nAja’s.\n\nAbu’s Oasis Deli.\n\nMusashi.\n\nHunan Garden.\n\nChina Buffet.\n\nKalypsso.\n\nBlondie’s.\n\nRESTAURANT WITH BEST DESSERTS\n\nI grew up in a family with nine kids, and we all ate dinner around a huge table. Somehow, my mom always had a dessert ready for us every night, and how she never got nominated for sainthood is beyond me.\n\nOur readers would certainly like to nominate some local restaurants for desserthood, including this year’s winner, the Powderhorn Café at 321 NE 6th, where their award-winning pies are all the rage.\n\nOthers high on the list were:\n\nBlondie’s Bistro.\n\nBlack Forest.\n\n115 Broiler.\n\nShari’s.\n\nHannah’s.\n\nChocolate Affair.\n\nBEST PLACE TO BUY PASTRIES\n\nThey come in all shapes and sizes, from tarts and cakes to scones and cream puffs, but one thing is for sure … we all love them.\n\nWhen it comes to finding the perfect pastry, our readers most often turned to the creations at the Fourth Street Deli & Bakery, located at 200 NW 4th Street. They were followed by:\n\nBluestone Bakery and Café.\n\nChocolate Affair.\n\nShari’s.\n\nThe Donut Shop.\n\nSaturday Grower’s Market.\n\nRESTAURANT WITH BEST APPETIZERS\n\nInstead of just making a decision off the huge entrée available, it’s sometimes best to check out some of the competition. That’s where appetizers come in. They tip you off as to exactly what is happening in the kitchen and how to best make the all-important decision on which entrée to order.\n\nAnd when it comes to great appetizers, our readers most often chose the selection at Applebee’s, located at 250 NE Agness Avenue. The list also included:\n\nMediterranean Bar & Grill.\n\nAja.\n\nLaughing Clam.\n\nBlondie’s Bistro.\n\n115 Broiler.\n\nHannah’s.\n\nTaprock Northwest Grill.\n\nBEST ICE CREAM/YOGURT/GELATO\n\nWhile a soothing, tasty ice cream dish is good almost anytime, it’s especially appropriate after a spicy meal. Where to go when you want to soothe that palate, or just taste something outstanding? In this category, our readers most often named the new Yogurt Hut, which opened a few months ago at 162 NE Beacon.\n\nThe list also included:\n\nBaskin-Robbins at 300 Union Avenue.\n\nDairy Queen.\n\nBlind George’s.\n\nGrants Pass Pharmacy.\n\nRESTAURANT WITH FRIENDLIEST WAITSTAFF\n\nIt’s an unenviable assignment, trying to keep everyone happy during every second they’re in the restaurant, but our ever-friendly waitstaff are up for the occasion. Thirty-five different restaurants were mentioned in this survey, which is a testament to how friendly they are.\n\nTopping the list for 2011 were the friendly folks at the Train Depot, who narrowly edged out Taprock Northwest Grill in this year’s balloting.\n\nThey were followed by:\n\nThe Vine.\n\n115 Broiler.\n\nCircle J Café.\n\nPowderhorn.\n\nLaughing Clam.\n\nElmer’s.\n\nAja.\n\nHerb’s.\n\nBEST “QUICK SERVICE” RESTAURANT\n\nApparently, a few people objected to the term “fast food,” claiming that it has gotten a bad rap in this country lately. Most fast food restaurants have upped their game dramatically in the last decade with regard to nutrition and wholesome ingredients, so we’ve opted for a new nomenclature: “Quick Service” restaurants.\n\nTaking down the top spot in this category for 2011 was both Carl’s Jr., at 6th & Hillcrest and Terry Lane & the Parkway, and Casablanca Coffee & Grill at 686 Union Ave.\n\nThe Top Five included:\n\nJimmy’s Drive-In.\n\nJack in the Box.\n\nArby’s.\n\nOthers receiving a lot of votes were:\n\nBurger King\n\nTaco Bell.\n\nDairy Queen.\n\nCarl’s Jr.\n\nSonic Drive-In.\n\nMcDonald’s.\n\nWendy’s.\n\nBEST SELECTION OF SANDWICHES\n\nThey can be anything from Dogwoods, wraps, melts, burritos, pasties, etc., but one thing is for certain … we love them. And when it comes to a great selection of sandwiches, our readers again turned to the Pita Pit, located at 330 NE Beacon, follwed by: on G Street, followed by:\n\nCircle J Café\n\nSubway Sandwiches.\n\nQuizno’s.\n\nMillie’s.\n\nThe Vine.\n\nRosso’s Delicatessen.\n\nWild River.\n\nBEST SELECTION OF BURGERS\n\nAs I’m writing this, I’m waiting for my family to get it together to leave for dinner. Being hungry, just the thought of a big juicy cheeseburger makes me want to start gnawing on my arm … pass the ketchup, please.\n\nIn lieu of that, our readers would much rather visit Jimmy’s Classic Drive-In, located at 515 NW E, which was once again voted “Best Burgers,” followed by:\n\nCarl’s Jr.\n\nBurger King.\n\nWild River Brewing Co.\n\nJack in the Box.\n\nWonder Bur Café.\n\nDairy Queen.\n\nWendy’s.\n\nSonic Drive-In.\n\nMcDonald’s.\n\nBEST FRENCH FRIES\n\nWhen stationed in Germany in the army, my buddies and I used to go to Heidelberg and walk the Hauptstrasse, which was almost a mile-long pedestrian-oriented street jammed with tourists and students. We were semi-poor G.I.s, so I practically lived on pom frites, which is what the Germans called French fries. That diet probably did wonders to my G.I., but it was a lot of fun!\n\nWhere to go when I want to relive the good old days in Germany? Most readers steered me to the “sweet potato fries” at Circle J Café, located at 241 SW G.\n\nOthers garnering a lot of votes from local G.I.s were:\n\nWild River Brewing Co.\n\nJimmy’s Classic Drive-In.\n\nDairy Queen.\n\nCarl’s Jr.\n\nMcDonald’s.\n\nWendy’s.\n\nBEST WINERY/BEST PLACE TO GO WINE TASTING\n\nThese were actually two different categories until we realized that they overlapped each other. So we combined all the results into one grand overall category, and the winner was Troon Vineyard, located at 1475 Kubli Road in the Applegate Valley.\n\nAlso landing at the top of the list were:\n\nSchmidt Family Vineyards in the Applegate Valley.\n\nBridgeview Winery in Cave Junction.\n\nElegance Wine Shop in downtown Grants Pass.\n\nRosella’s Vineyard in the Applegate Valley.\n\nWooldridge Creek Winery in the Applegate Valley.\n\nDel Rio Vineyards in Gold Hill.\n\nOregon Outpost in downtown Grants Pass.\n\nBEST FAMILY-OPERATED RESTAURANT\n\nWhen I was in grade school, my best friend’s family owned a bar and grill with an apartment above, where they lived. While my 10-year-old buddy didn’t go down and serve drinks or wait on tables, I always thought it was kind of neat that the family all chipped in toward the success of the business.\n\nWinning this category for 2011 was the Powderhorn Restaurant at the corner of 6th and E, where Kathy, Tina and the crew still keep the family spirit alive.\n\nOthers in the mix were:\n\nHannah’s Restaurant.\n\nTrain Depot.\n\nThe Vine.\n\n115 Broiler.\n\nAja.\n\nSi Casa Flores.\n\nMatsukaze.\n\nFAVORITE BARISTA (COFFEE SERVER)\n\nIt’s amazing how friendly and upbeat every barista I’ve ever met is. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that they have access to caffeine on a minute’s notice! That would make anyone happy.\n\nAnyway, a number of baristas were named in this category, including this year’s winner, Nicole from Rogue Coffee Roasters.\n\nFAVORITE COFFEEHOUSE\n\nTwenty-five years ago, when the Sneak Preview first started, there were exactly zero coffee stands in Grants Pass. Today it seems as if they’re at every street corner, with everyone wanting to capitalize on our craving for caffeine. That’s not a bad thing. The quality of coffee has gone up dramatically during that time, and we can thank our local coffee purveyors for that.\n\nWho do our readers first want to thank when it comes to coffee? Once again they voted Dutch Brothers, who opened 23 years ago, as their favorite.\n\nComing in second was Rogue Coffee Roasters, followed by:\n\nBluestone Bakery.\n\nHuman Bean.\n\nEthereal Café.\n\nCopper Barrel.\n\nRESTAURANT WITH BEST OUTDOOR SEATING\n\nMy wife and I have an outdoor patio where we enjoy dinner every night during the summer, so I understand the motivation behind everyone who answered this question. There’s nothing more fun than communing with nature and enjoying lunch or dinner.\n\nAnd when it comes to that, Taprock Northwest Grill, with its wrap-around deck overlooking the river, Riverside Park and the Caveman Bridge, won this category going away.\n\nOther outstanding outdoor seating areas included:\n\nSummer Jo’s.\n\nR-Haus.\n\nGalice Resort.\n\nO.K. Corral.\n\nBEST RESTAURANT OUTSIDE GRANTS PASS\n\nAs a great American once said: “Sometimes in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to get the hell out of Dodge and visit restaurants outside Grants Pass. We, of course, hold these truths to be self-evident, that we are endowed by our Creator with the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of different restaurants.”\n\nOkay, I kind of got out of control there, but you know what I mean, and when it comes to that our readers most often picked the Olive Garden and McGrath’s in Medford, although Morrison’s Lodge outside Galice came in a close third.\n\nAlso mentioned a lot were:\n\nThe Jacksonville Inn.\n\nPorter’s in Medford.\n\nThe Galice Resort.\n\nBella Union in Jacksonville.\n\nThe Roadhouse Grill in Medford.\n\nPeerless Restaurant in Ashland.\n\nENTERTAINMENT\n\nBEST ROCK/BLUES CONCERT IN GRANTS PASS LAST YEAR\n\nTaking down the number one spot in this category was folk-rock singer/songwriter Marc Cohn, who made an appearance at the Rogue Theatre. Cohn is best known for his song “Walking in Memphis” from his 1991 album Marc Cohn.\n\nBEST “CLASSICAL” CONCERT LAST YEAR\n\nMany of the Rogue Valley Symphony concerts, under the direction of Martin Majkut, were named by our readers. Topping the list was the February concert featuring soloist Elinor Frey on cello.\n\nAlso mentioned a lot was the Jefferson Baroque Orchestra concert in November, “A Special Evening of Antonio Vivaldi,” with John Taylor on mandolin,\n\nFAVORITE CONCERT AT THE BRITT FESTIVAL\n\nOur readers love the Britt Festival in Jacksonville, and they named quite a few performances, including this year’s favorite, Michael Franti and Spearhead.\n\nOthers mentioned a lot were Alison Kraus and Styx.\n\nFAVORITE CONCERT IN THE PARK\n\nLocal funk/soul band Funktional Fusion won this category, followed by the Southern Oregon Jazz Orchestra.\n\nMOST FUN PLACE FOR FIRST FRIDAY ART NIGHT\n\nYou don’t have to have a degree in art to appreciate the First Friday Art Night. Many of the events offer food, refreshments and entertainment, and often the artist is there to explain some of the finer details of his or her work. All in all, it’s one big social event that introduces everyone to the scintillating and colorful world of art.\n\nAccording to our readers, a good place to start (or end) the evening is the Grants Pass Museum of Art on G Street, which won this event for 2011. Also mentioned a lot were:\n\nElegance.\n\nKitchen Company.\n\nAll along G Street.\n\nFireHouse Gallery.\n\nLaughing Clam.\n\nGlass Forge.\n\nFAVORITE LOCAL ARTIST\n\nTaking down the top spot in this category was Del Hearn, who also won in 2005. Del specializes in alykd oil paintings, and he has lived in the Rogue Valley since 1971.\n\nThe list also included:\n\nJanet Higgins.\n\nJulie Bickle.\n\nJanet Gogue\n\nJeff Gogue.\n\nJudith Spahn.\n\nFAVORITE PART OF THE “BEAR HOTEL”\n\nBrady Adams’s Evergreen Federal Bank is famous for its displays of public art, including all the various Bear Fests that have adorned downtown Grants Pass over the last ten years. The “hotel,” which has been designated as a museum by the City of Grants Pass, serves artists, nonprofits and bank customers, while housing event displays. It is open for public tours by appointment and open tours during events.\n\nMost popular with our readers was the Christmas on Mars display, followed by:\n\nAll the bears.\n\nThe murals.\n\nFinding Bigfoot.\n\nThe tee-pee.\n\nThe Wild Bunch bears on motorcycles.\n\nWinterfest.\n\nFAVORITE ANIMAL AT WILDLIFE IMAGES\n\nIt’s one of the most famous wildlife rehabilitation and education centers in the country, established by J. David Siddon and his son Dave in 1981 on 24 acres twelve miles west of Grants Pass. Their passion is to rehabilitate and return injured wildlife back to their homes in the wild, and over the last the last thirty years they have released 35,000 animals back to their natural habitat.\n\nThe center is open to visitors year round, rain or shine, with 90-minute tours available. Many of our readers have obviously taken that tour because almost all of the animals at Wildlife Images were mentioned. The winners were Clark and Katrina, two adorable cougars that are permanent residents of the facility.\n\nOthers mentioned a lot were:\n\nLakota and Tundra, two grey wolves.\n\nThe eagles.\n\nThe five black bears and two grizzlies.\n\nThe otters.\n\nThe owls.\n\nBEST SPORTING EVENT IN JOSEPHINE COUNTY LAST YEAR\n\nWho needs the Super Bowl or World Cup when equally exciting sporting events take place locally on an almost daily basis? Topping the list in this category was the run that the Hidden Valley Volleyball Team made in the state tournament. Coach Dan Jackson guided them to a third place finish at the state tournament, chalking up a 27-2 record.\n\nOther exciting events included:\n\nThe Boatnik Race.\n\nHorse racing at Grants Pass Downs.\n\nGPHS football.\n\nKinder soccer.\n\nFAVORITE JETBOAT DRIVER AT HELLGATE EXCURSIONS\n\nThey know the Rogue River like the back of their hands, they’re on a first-name basis with practically every osprey, beaver and otter in the Valley, they know all the latest jokes, and they can execute flawless 360° wheelies with the greatest of ease. By the time you’re done with the trip, the boat driver has practically become your best friend. And when it comes to that, driver Derek Kellenbeck was voted this year’s favorite.\n\nOthers included:\n\nDonnie Brent.\n\nBeau Dunson.\n\nCraig Lawless.\n\nRick Olsen.\n\nBEST FITNESS CLUB\n\nYou could have all the money in the world and live in the nicest house on the planet with all the toys you ever wanted, but if you don’t have your health, it’s all meaningless. The best way to ensure that is to watch what you eat, stay away from cigarettes, try not to get stressed out … and exercise at least 4-5 times a week. I realize that’s easier said than done, but there are quite a few fitness clubs in the area that are willing to help you start.\n\nWinning this category for the umpteenth time in a row was Club Northwest, located on NW Vine Street, where they have programs and exercise regimens for people of all levels. Grants Pass Family YMCA also received a lot of votes, as did Thrive, Anytime Fitness, and Curves for Women.\n\nBEST BARNSTORMERS’ PLAY LAST YEAR\n\nThey’ll be celebrating their 60th year in 2012 and they are officially the oldest, continuously running community theater in the state of Oregon. Last season was a particularly exciting one, and our readers were most impressed with the production of Chicago, a musical that takes place in the Roaring 20s.\n\nOthers high on the list were:\n\nOn Golden Pond.\n\nScapino.\n\nA Child’s Christmas in Wales.\n\nBEST OLD TIME RADIO PLAYERS’ SKIT LAST YEAR\n\nEvery two months the “Players” reenact a radio show from the 1930s-40s, complete with creative sound effects and the requisite melodrama/humor. Topping the charts this year as favorite skit was last February’s “The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet: Buying a Valentine.”\n\nComing in second was “My Friend Irma.”\n\nBEST THEATER PERFORMANCE (FEMALE)\n\nRogue Music Theatre featured Annie Get Your Gun in August 2010, and our readers didn’t forget the effort turned in by Jocelyn Vodovocz as Annie. Jocelyn was also recognized for her work in the Barnstormers’ production of the musical Chicago.\n\nOther top female roles included:\n\nGeneva Hughes in the Barnstormers’ On Golden Pond.\n\nLynn Beach in the Barnstormers’ Look Homeward Angel.\n\nJaneen McGinnis in the Barnstomers’ I Hate Hamlet and Noises Off.\n\nJulia Cuppy as Dorothy in RMT’s The Wizard of Oz.\n\nElla Sachs as Clara in Stillpoint’s The Nutcracker.\n\nBEST THEATER PERFORMANCE (MALE)\n\nThe Barnstormers presented an unforgettable performance of On Golden Pond last fall, and Kent Prickett was recognized as number one by our readers for his role as Norman Thayer.\n\nOther great performance included:\n\nHeath Koerschgen for his role as Butler in Rogue Music Theatre’s Annie Get Your Gun.\n\nEric Epstein in the Barnstormers’ Scapino.\n\nAdam Cuppy in RMT’s Wizard of Oz.\n\nJohn Stuart in the Barnstormers’ Look Homeward Angel.\n\nColin Hewitt in the Barnstormers’ A Child’s Christmas in Wales.\n\nAdam Gross in 111 Evelyn’s Peter Pan.\n\nBEST DIRECTOR (LOCAL THEATER)\n\nThe competition was tough for this one, but Russell Lloyd ended on top with his work on the Barnstormers Scapino.\n\nAlso mentioned were:\n\nTricia Drevets for the Barnstormers’ On Golden Pond.\n\nBurt Eikelberry for the Barnstormers’ Look Homeward Angel.\n\nShane Skinner for RMT’s Annie Get Your Gun.\n\nSusan Cohen for the Barnstormers’ Noises Off.\n\nBEST PLAY IN ASHLAND THIS YEAR\n\nThere was a collective groan heard throughout southern Oregon when the Angus Bowmer Theatre at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland cracked a beam in June and had to be shut down for six weeks. The Festival brings in $170 million a year to the southern Oregon economy, and the last thing we needed was for our bread and butter to suffer. The Festival responded by erecting a 600-seat tent theater in Lithia Park, and the show definitely went on.\n\nAs far as this season is concerned, our readers are most impressed with To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nOthers included:\n\nThe Language Archive.\n\nAugust: Osage County.\n\nBEST LOCAL MUSICIAN/SINGER\n\nWhether they’re kickin’ out the jams with rock ‘n’ roll or waltzing away with classical tunes, local musicians entertain us on a daily basis with their talents and creativity. A number of them were named by our readers, including this year’s winner Jen Ambrose, who plays a “stylistic blending of folk, blues and world music.”\n\nOthers mentioned a lot were:\n\nMegan Sdudstad of Funktional Fusion.\n\nJohn Trujillo.\n\nDave Vestyns.\n\nCharles Wright.\n\nMike Smith.\n\nKristy Lee Cook.\n\nBEST LOCAL ROCK ‘N’ ROLL BAND\n\nThey’re actually more of a funk/soul band, but Funktional Fusion won this category for 2011, followed by:\n\nRiver City Rhythm & Blues.\n\nJen Ambrose Band.\n\nBroadway Phil & the Shouters.\n\nMr. J.\n\nBEST PLACE TO HEAR KARAOKE\n\nA karaoke bar is the ultimate definition of spontaneous fun as total strangers get up before a crowd and start singing to background music while words to the song scroll across the screen.\n\nWhere to go when you want to have some go ol’ karaoke fun? Most people mentioned Shenanigans (at Herb’s LaCasita), which has karaoke Friday through Wednesday nights, followed by JD’s Sports Pub & Deli.\n\nBEST NIGHTCLUB TO HEAR LIVE MUSIC\n\nThe scene for live music in Grants Pass is not overwhelming, but there are still a few places where you can party with live music. The number one spot according to our readers is the “G” Street Bar & Grill, followed by:\n\nLaughing Clam.\n\nJD’s Sports Pub.\n\nCedarwood Tavern.\n\nBEST ENTRY IN THE 2011 BOATNIK PARADE\n\nIt’s probably the biggest parade in all of southern Oregon, and if you’re not there watching it, then you’re probably a part of it. Topping the list for the 2011 event was the entry by Dutch Brothers.\n\nOthers mentioned a lot were:\n\nWildlife Images.\n\nSt. Anne’s Church.\n\nGrants Pass High School Marching Band.\n\nThe YMCA.\n\nThree Rivers Community Hospital.\n\nSouth Middle School Marching Band.\n\nBEST BAR TO MEET FRIENDS AFTER WORK\n\nBlue collar, white collar, or any color in between, once 5:00 rolls around you’re ready to PAR-TAY! Or at least hang out at the bar and talk about what a doofus your boss is.\n\nWhere do people most like to meet after work? The top two choices with our readers were the Laughing Clam and Blondie’s Bistro, which are across the street from each other on G Street.\n\nThe Top Ten in this category were:\n\nHerb’s LaCasita.\n\nJoe’s Place.\n\nCedarwood.\n\nG Street Bar & Grill.\n\nTaprock.\n\nH Street Bar & Eatery.\n\nJD’s Sports Pub.\n\nWonder Bur.\n\nBEST BAR TO MEET FRIENDS LATE AT NIGHT\n\nIt’s probably not something you want to do every night, but hitting the bars to connect with friends can be very healthy when practiced in moderation. There, that’s my public service message for the day.\n\nAnd when it comes to fun bars where friends can meet late at night, there was a three-way tie between the Wonder Bur, G Street Bar & Grill, and Herb’s Shenanigans/Outback Lounge.\n\nOthers mentioned a lot were:\n\nCedarwood.\n\nLaughing Clam.\n\nJD’s.\n\nBAR WITH MOST ROMANTIC ATMOSPHERE\n\nBars aren’t all loud music, football games on TV, pool tables and raucous laughter. There are also places where you can relax and have a refreshing drink while carrying on a scintillating conversation with your significant other or close friends. Topping the list in this category was both Hannah’s Restaurant and Blondie’s Bistro, followed by:\n\n115 Broiler.\n\nThe Vine.\n\nMediterranean Bar & Grill.\n\nG Street Bar & Grill.\n\nBAR WITH BEST LATE NIGHT MENU\n\nThe munchies can attack at any time, and you gotta be prepared. Luckily, there are quite a few bars to help out in that assignment, starting with the G Street Bar & Grill, which won our readers’ hearts (and stomachs).\n\nOther favorites included:\n\nTaprock.\n\nJoe’s Place.\n\nBlondie’s.\n\nJD’s.\n\nLaughing Clam.\n\nHannah’s.\n\nFAVORITE PART OF THE GROWERS MARKET\n\nNow in its 33rd year, the Saturday Growers Market has evolved into not only a great place to buy fresh produce and crafts, but a social scene and gathering place for many in the community.\n\nThe variety at the market is endless, but our readers most appreciated the selection of organic produce that was available. Also important are:\n\nThe people and social scene.\n\nTamales.\n\nDonuts.\n\nCrafts.\n\nEarl’s Eggs.\n\n3-Mile Farm.\n\nBEST SWIMMING HOLE\n\nTo the person who wrote, “Not telling,” we appreciate your candor and desire to skinny dip in peace. Quite a few people, however, gave away their secrets, including those who voted the Illinois River as their favorite.\n\nIt was followed by:\n\nTurtle Lane.\n\nApplegate River.\n\nCaveman Pool.\n\nSchroeder Park.\n\nGriffin Park.\n\nLake Shasta.\n\nFAVORITE CITY PARK (OTHER THAN RIVERSIDE)\n\nThere are certain reasons why we pay taxes: police and fire protection, good roads, good schools, water and sewer, public health protection, and parks. No urban environment would be remotely livable without a good system of parks, and in lieu of hosting bake sales every week to pay for maintenance, we all chip in and enjoy the beauty together. That’s America.\n\nAnyway, when it comes to City parks, everyone knows that Riverside is the crown jewel. After that, our readers most often appreciated the Reinhart Volunteer Park, followed by:\n\nLawnridge Park.\n\nCroxton Memorial.\n\nOgle Park.\n\nFor all those who mentioned Indian Mary, Tom Pearce, Schroeder and Griffin Parks, you should be aware that those are County owned.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThere we go … 144 categories and another year under my belt. Looking forward to 2012! If you have any suggestions for new entries next year, write to me at This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. —C.H.\n\n2012 Best of Grants Pass\n\nBefore jumping into this 26th annual readers' survey, let's review some of the more momentous events of the last year. In a supreme example of irony, two female political figures—County Commissioner Sandi Cassanelli and City Manager Laurel Samson—were ousted from their jobs. Now, to fill the gender void, two women are running for the open County Commissioner spots. It will be interesting to see how that plays out.\n\nWe did a special report in November about dwindling funds at the Animal Control Center. That facility is something I think most people feel is important to the community. The commissioners could put an extremely small tax increase on the ballot to pay for the Animal Shelter, and I think it would pass.\n\nIt took about a month, but in December the toxic oil spill at the River Road Reserve got a cleanup. The area next to it is part of the Josephine County Food Bank, but unless the City wins the lottery, the rest of the 248 acres won't be developed anytime in the near future.\n\nIn February, we reported on the County's efforts to supplement its dwindling finances by advocating a Forest Management Plan that would set aside \"x\" acres of forest land for conservation and \"y\" acres for timber harvesting. It may be a few years away, but the plan has the potential to replace all the lost federal largesse we used to get.\n\nIn March, we did a followup to the Raphael Amoroso story, in which we admitted that our original reporting might have been a rush to judgment. Raphael had been picked up by police in October for a DUI after seen hanging out in the high school parking lot, and a subsequent search of his home found guns and incendiary literature. His neighbors testified to his character and claimed he was being railroaded. The case is still in federal court.\n\nIn the May primary, 14 candidates vied for the two open county commissioner positions. There will be no incumbents on the ballot, as newcomers Toni Webb and Keith Heck will face off in Position 2, while Cherryl Walker and Bob Just will battle for Position 3.\n\nIn that same primary, voters soundly rejected a proposal for a property tax increase that would fund law enforcement. Then on May 31, 39 inmates were released from the Josephine County, and that night four scumbags robbed the offices of UCAN, a non-profit agency whose sole mission is to help low income people and those just barely hanging on.\n\nNow back to more important things ... the 2012 \"Best of the Rogue Valley.\" We received over 400 ballots this year, and we congratulate everyone who took the time to fill them out. Those who only answered three or four categories were put into the \"suspicious\" stack, but everyone else did an admirable job.\n\nThe reason we have 144 categories is because we want to try and recognize as many people, businesses and organizations as possible. We like to spread the wealth around. That being said, let's proceed.\n\nDEMOGRAPHICS\n\nWe asked the question, \"Favorite TV Show,\" figuring this would give us an insight into the minds of our readers. The results were all over the board and we didn't even start writing them down until they notched two mentions. The top seven were: The Big Bang Theory, NCIS, Dancing with the Stars, House Hunters, Modern Family, American Idol and Downton Abbey. It's obviously a very well-rounded group of respondents.\n\nMEDIA\n\nFAVORITE RADIO STATION\n\nI went on Google and typed in \"Radio Stations Grants Pass Oregon,\" and unbelievably there are 51 of them in the region, from Cave Junction to Hornbrook. Make that 52 since the list did not include Don Monette's new station KCMD.\n\nAnyway, taking down top honors again in the category were the friendly folks over at KLDR and KAJO, which has been entertaining and informing local listeners since August 15, 1957.\n\nOther favorites included:\n\nJefferson Public Radio.\n\nKRRM\n\nKDOV\n\nKRWQ\n\nKISS-FM\n\nKCMD\n\nFAVORITE DJ\n\nIn 1959 the most famous deejay of all time, Alan Freed, lost his job at WABC in Cleveland when it was learned that he accepted money (payola) from artists to play their songs on the radio. He was basically a scapegoat since practically everyone was doing the same thing at that time.\n\nHere in the Rogue Valley, payola is not an issue, although sometimes I feel like paying them money not to play some of the music I hear. Topping the charts for 2012 was Jeanette Stark, a stalwart at KDLR who also won this in 2000 and 2010.\n\nThe list also included:\n\nCarl Wilson of KAJO\n\nCassie Callas at KLDR\n\nGemineye at KISS-FM\n\nChris Barnett at KLDR\n\nDon Monette at KCMD\n\nBEST LOCAL TV\n\nNEWS STATION\n\nEvery night they present a cross section of life in the Rogue Valley, from local heroes to scurrilous villains, keeping us apprised of community events as they happen.\n\nWinning this category for the umpteenth time in a row was NewsWatch 12 (KDRV).\n\nThey were followed by KOBI/Channel 5 and KTVL (Channel 10).\n\nFAVORITE TV\n\nWEATHER PERSON\n\nOne thing you can say about the Rogue Valley: we don't have to worry about hurricanes or tornadoes. Sure, we have occasional floods and fires, and the rare earthquake, but for natural disasters caused by weather, we're fairly insulated.\n\nAnd when we have to rely on someone to tell us to \"head to the hills,\" we most often turn to Scott Lewis of KKRV, Channel\n\nAlso high in the ranking were:\n\nJeff Heaton of KOBI-5\n\nKevin Lollis, KTVL-10\n\nLindsay Matherly, Channel 10\n\nMilt Radford, KDRV-12\n\nFAVORITE REPORTER AT THE DAILY COURIER\n\nWell, heck, I just Googled \"Most Distrusted Professions\" and learned that politicians were number one, bankers #2, and journalists #3. Sad, isn't it? They spend their entire waking hours trying to keep you informed of the news, and this is the thanks they get.\n\nLocally, our intrepid reporters at the Courier diligently strive to dispel that stereotype, and leading the way is Health & Business reporter Lindsay Cathey, followed by:\n\nZach Urness, sports\n\nShaun Hall, police/courts\n\nKathleen Alaks, Lifelines/Entertainment\n\nPatti Richter, Education\n\nStacey Stumbo, County\n\nEdith Decker, Features Editor\n\nFAVORITE PART OF THE SNEAK PREVIEW\n\nTo all those who said \"all of it,\" we thank you profusely, but we were hoping to break this thing down. While \"The Best of the Rogue Valley\" held the home field advantage and garnered many votes, we were looking at the other 95% of the paper. Winning the most support again was The Profile, featuring a light-hearted interview with local personalities.\n\nOther favorites include:\n\nKudos & Klunkers\n\nThe covers stories\n\nLetters (and the editor's responses)\n\nBusiness Grapevine\n\nAll of the ads/coupons\n\nThe Calendar of Events\n\nDoug Beacham's articles\n\nPEOPLE/BUSINESS\n\nBEST NEW BUSINESS IN TOWN (LAST YEAR)\n\nThe vast majority of people in this country have 9-5 jobs but practically everyone \"dreams\" of owning their own business. It's a risky proposition, though, and if you don't do your homework, it can end ugly. Our hats are off to anyone who even attempts it.\n\nOur readers also appreciate their efforts, naming quite a few new businesses in town, including this year's winner, The Twisted Cork, a restaurant and bottle shop located at 210 SW 6th Street (in the old Kitchen Company building).\n\nAlso mentioned a lot were:\n\nHome Depot.\n\nRiver's Edge (new and improved at 1936 Rogue River Highway)\n\nMaurice's, a clothing store in the Grants Pass Shopping Center\n\nGoodness Gracious Café & Catering at 221 SW G\n\nMaMosa's, a restaurant the recently opened at 118 NW E\n\nThe Vietnamese Food Cart\n\nRed Heels Salon at 221 NE D\n\nAdorn Me Fashion Boutique & Gifts at 543 NE E (Suite 206)\n\nFAVORITE BUSINESSPERSON\n\nThey may technically be the CEO/boss/jefe, but most of them put in longer hours than their employees and take an active interest in every aspect of the business, from greeting customers and cleaning the bathrooms to public relations.\n\nLanding at the top in this category for 2012 were Frank Wright and Roy Heinzle of the Kitchen Company, who have turned their store into a mecca for food lovers in southern Oregon.\n\nThe Top Ten included:\n\nCliff Bennett of Chet's\n\nBrady Adams of Evergreen Federal\n\nScott and Annette Draper at Club Northwest and Spa at Club Northwest\n\nGiff Gates of Gates Furniture\n\nTom Hart, Jr., at Hart Jewelers\n\nDave Thomason at Taprock Northwest Grill\n\nSteve Roe at Roe Motors GM\n\nMichelle Belcher of Grants Pass Pharmacy\n\nRick Chapman of Plaza Sew 'n' Vac\n\nFAVORITE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER (CITY)\n\nWe all remember that first day of elementary school. Landing on the moon would have been infinitely easier—at least there wouldn't have been scary-looking figures of authority ready to swallow you up for every little mistake. Then you met your first teacher, and he/she immediately put you at ease, introduced you to fellow classmates, and the vistas of a new life suddenly opened up.\n\nQuite a few teachers were mentioned in this category, including this year's winner Connie Hagerman, a first grade teacher at Lincoln.\n\nOthers receiving lots of votes were:\n\nCarla Healey, a kindergarten teacher at Allendale\n\nHolly Rousaville, a Title 1 teacher at Allendale\n\nAbby Harden, first grade at Redwood\n\nKelly Moodie, music teacher at Lincoln\n\nLaura Richardson, second grade teacher at Riverside\n\nFAVORITE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER (COUNTY)\n\nOn the Three Rivers School District side of the ledger, the winner was Sharon Fisher, a 2nd grade teacher at Madrona, followed by:\n\nCecilia McKee, kindergarten teacher at Jerome Prairie\n\nKari O'Brien, 3rd grade at Ft. Vannoy\n\nCarrie Simpson, 3rd grade at Madrona\n\nFAVORITE SCHOOL JANITOR\n\nIn first grade, you see men and women going around sweeping up the halls and cleaning your rooms, and you think to yourself, \"I thought Mom was supposed to do that!\" Just kidding, of course.\n\nSweeping the honors in the category for 2012 was Mike DeLay, head custodian at Jerome Prairie Elementary.\n\nFAVORITE HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE\n\nTo the enterprising writer who requested that we add the category, \"Favorite Brain Bowl Participant\" or \"Favorite Math Club Member,\" all we can say is, \"Maybe next year.\" For now, we're sticking with the athletes. And in that category, GPHS baseball player Matt Cole took down top honors, followed by:\n\nTony Shriven, GPHS basketball\n\nChad Lowe, GPHS football\n\nRashaun Sells, GPHS softball\n\nTyler Bennett, GPHS baseball\n\nFAVORITE INSTRUCTOR AT RCC\n\nRogue Community College was established in November 1970 by the voters of Josephine County. In 1996 the boundaries were extended to include all of Jackson County, and today it \"provides a wide range of educational programs, job-training opportunities, and greater college access for students throughout the Rogue Valley.\"\n\nThe faculty, of course, is excellent, and our readers recognized quite a few including this year's winner, Midge Shaw, in the Humanities Department.\n\nThe list also included:\n\nWayd Drake, Humanities and Drama\n\nSandy Contreras, Health/PE\n\nCynthia Charat, Humanities\n\nDebbie McLennan, Mathematics\n\nAnn Hackford, Nursing\n\nFAVORITE DENTIST\n\nIt may cause a panic attack just thinking about dental work, but taking care of your teeth is one of the best investments you can make when it comes to eliminating pain down the line. Just ask my third molar, which I had to have removed while in basic training in the army.\n\nThe ballots were coming in fast and furious with this category, and bunched up at the top was a 3-way tie between Don Lanahan, Steven Rogers and Matt Hill, followed by:\n\nGreg Bigelow\n\nRichard Miller\n\nPeter Pastrell\n\nMatt Johnston\n\nMart Erickson\n\nSara Riechers\n\nMichelle Johnson\n\nTim Dwyer\n\nRay Sutton.\n\nFAVORITE DOCTOR\n\nIt's one of mankind's higher calling—spending your life making sure that we all stay healthy and then healing us when things turn south. Our readers certainly appreciate their efforts, as they named 35 different doctors in this survey.\n\nTopping the charts this year was Heather Kahn, a family practitioner who also won this category in 2007.\n\nAlso mentioned a lot were:\n\nEdmund Glovinsky, DO\n\nTamara Medley at the Women's Health Center\n\nDan Gleffe, family practitioner\n\nEric Perry, MD\n\nRon Sinclair, MD\n\nFelicia Cohen, OB/GYN\n\nDerrick Sorweide, DO\n\nEd Groenhout, MD\n\nFAVORITE NATUROPATHIC DOCTOR/ACUPUNCTURIST\n\nOccram's Razor tells you to always search for the simplest solution to any problem. That stomach ache you have might not be an ulcer which requires surgery; it just might be an imbalance of beneficial flora in your bowels which needs some adjustment. That is the whole basis behind naturopathy, and when our readers are looking for their favorites, they most often chose Ellen Heinitz and Kristen Plunkett of the Naturopathic Clinic.\n\nAcupuncture, meanwhile, is an alternative medicine methodology that originated in ancient China 2500 years ago ... you know, when Europeans were living in crude huts without a clue about medicine other than herbal remedies.\n\nOur readers were able to name most of the area's acupuncturists in this survey, reserving their number one choice for Janet Moret of River of Wellness.\n\nFAVORITE CHIROPRACTOR\n\nIt was a long day of unloading anvils, safes and refrigerators at the factory, and your back seems a little out of whack. Where to go? Our readers most often chose both Glen Litwiller and Edward Welch as their favorite, followed by:\n\nOwen Martin\n\nKevin Teagle\n\nRyan Baker\n\nDavid Krauss\n\nDavid Willing\n\nTodd Harris\n\nFAVORITE HAIR STYLIST\n\nYou were on your way to meet the future in-laws for the first time, and your significant other insisted that you ride in his convertible with the top down. \"Come on honey, it will fun.\" By the time you got there, you looked like you'd just crawled out of a dipsy dumpster. Desperate, you called your favorite hair stylist for a quick once-over.\n\nAnd when it comes to making sure your hair always looks perfect, our readers were able to name 39 different hair stylists. So once again, we're going with a three-way standoff between Kathy Johnson at Roberta's Shear Pleasure; Amy Taradash at the Spa at Club Northwest; and Ashley Lawson at RockStar Hair Studio.\n\nThe top of the list also included:\n\nCarrol Oyler of Carrol's Image Connection\n\nRon Gillaspie at Gillaspie's Hair Design\n\nShawna Maddox at Shine\n\nTraci Brown of Personal Touch\n\nSally Roudebush, Progressive Beauty Center\n\nLinda Whalen of Action Hair Designs\n\nBEST PLACE TO GET MANICURES/PEDICURES\n\nOkay, I hang my head in shame for labeling this category \"Best Place to Get Medicures/Pedicures.\" My proofreader (wife) didn't even catch it. And what's amazing is that back in 2010 when we ran this category, the same mistake was made. And to everyone who circled \"medicures\" with about nineteen exclamation points, thank you for your attention to details.\n\nAnyway, who are our readers most impressed with when it comes to manicures/pedicures? The number one choice was Forever Nails, located at 1634 Williams Highway, followed closely by Spa at Club Northwest.\n\nOthers bunched up near the top were:\n\nAmbiance Hair & Nail Studio\n\nDa-Vi Nails\n\nAvenue Salon\n\nEn Vogue\n\nLa Belle Vie Salon\n\nIndulgence\n\nFAVORITE AUTO MECHANIC\n\nAmerica has a love affair with their automobiles and when the relationship goes sour, you both agree to talk to a therapist, in this case your mechanic. \"He doesn't give me enough oil,\" the car complains. \"She doesn't give good gas mileage,\" you counter. Being a professional, the mechanic puts you both back on track.\n\nWinning this category for 2012 was Ken Cook of The Shop.\n\nThe field was very crowded, however, and the top vote-getters included:\n\nTom Hill at Tom's Auto\n\nJim Lefeber at Star Automotive\n\nLarry Anberg at Revolvo West\n\nGary Smerdon\n\nFrank Miranda at Extreme Auto\n\nHuck Webb of Huck's Garage\n\nMike Dunbar of Bridge Street Auto\n\nBEST PLACE TO BUY USED CARS\n\nAs much as you want to, sometimes you just don't have the money to spring for a brand new car. Buying a used car is chancy, however, because you never know if the previous owner used it to go fishing at the tip of the Baja every spring. That's where a knowledgeable car salesman comes in handy.\n\nAnd in this category, the friendly folks at Mock's Ford came in first, followed by:\n\nRoe Motors GM\n\nWheeler Toyota\n\nQuality Used Cars\n\nJim Sigel\n\nBest Used Cars\n\nAnd craigslist\n\nBEST PLACE TO BUY TIRES\n\nThe vulcanization of rubber was developed by Charles Goodyear in the year 1839, and the first practical pneumatic tire was developed by John Boyd in Ireland in 1887 to \"prevent the headaches his son had while riding a bicycle on rough roads.\" By the 1920s synthetic rubber was developed in the laboratories at Bayer, and today over one billion tires are produced annually in over 400 tire factories.\n\nA certain percentage of them end up here in Grants Pass, and according to our readers the best place to buy them is at Les Schwab, with two locations at 1694 NW 6th and 320 Union Avenue.\n\nThey were followed in the balloting by:\n\nExpert Tire\n\nTowne Center Tire Factory\n\nQuick Lane Tire & Auto\n\nRiver City Auto & Tire\n\nFAVORITE ATTORNEY\n\nYou really didn't mean to burn the neighbor's house down when the charcoal grill got out of control. It was the neighbor's fault for not properly pruning his shrubs and leaving combustible material on the ground. He sued you anyway, so where do you go? Many of our readers most often named Jack Davis, followed by:\n\nChris Mecca\n\nBen Freudenberg\n\nLynn Myrick\n\nJim Dole\n\nClaudia Browne\n\nWalt Cauble\n\nDan Hughes\n\nRichard Lane\n\nFAVORITE POLICEPERSON\n\nHere's a rhetorical question: do policemen get a panic attack when they're off duty and driving 74 miles an hour down the Interstate and see a police car off to the side with a radar gun? Kind of like does a tree falling in the forest make a noise if no one is around to hear it? Just askin'.\n\nAnyway, our readers were able to put the radar gun on 19 different officers this year, including the year's winner, Officer Joe Robles of Grants Pass Public Safety.\n\nOthers high in the standings were:\n\nGP Public Safety Director Joe Henner\n\nGP Officer Scott Hyde\n\nGP Community Service Officer Lyle Brown\n\nGP Officer Pete Jenista\n\nSheriff Gil Gilbertson\n\nCounty patrol officer Joel Heller\n\nBEST FINANCIAL ADVISOR\n\nOkay, you just won the lottery, and you're trying to decide where to invest that $35 you got on the scratch-off ticket. Just kidding ... let's assume just for assuming sake, that the amount was $1 million. Who would you turn to for advice? Our readers were all over the board on this one, naming quite a few. In the end, Ken Guerra of Independent Financial Group was the top vote-getter. He was followed by:\n\nJeff Voigt of Pfs Investments\n\nJon Mainard of Financial Network Investment\n\nRick Wilson of Ameriprise Financial Services\n\nBrian Sachs of Edward Jones\n\nJohn Beckstead of Edward Jones\n\nRodger Jordan of Lpl Financial\n\nJason Lewis of Allstate Financial Services\n\nNelson Maler of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney\n\nFAVORITE VETERINARIAN\n\nHaving your dog or cat come down sick is almost as painful as when it happens to you. When my cat Mau Mau lost four kittens giving birth in the vet's office three years ago, I was freaking out that something might happen to her. A great vet is worth his or her weight in gold.\n\nThere were quite a few bunched up at the top, so we'll name the top four in alphabetical order.\n\nRussell Codd of Lincoln Road Vet Clinic\n\nHeidi Buehner-McKenzie of Allen Creek Vet Hospital\n\nRon Guzman of Riverside Vet Clinic\n\nJean Manhart of Pacific Vet\n\nOthers mentioned a lot were:\n\nBob Cole of the Animal Clinic\n\nLorain Abel of Cedarview Vet Hospital\n\nCharles Meyer of Applegate Animal Clinic\n\nFAVORITE LOCAL RESTAURANT OWNER\n\nBack when I first visited Grants Pass in 1976 there were about five restaurants in town. Today, there are over one hundred, and I think that's a good thing. A little healthy competition is what keeps restaurant owners on their toes.\n\nOur readers agree, and they named 25 different people in this survey, with the top nod going to Bob and Darla Feil of the Train Depot. Bob and Darla also did a service to the community recently by re-opening River's Edge on the banks of the Rogue River.\n\nOthers mentioned a lot were:\n\nDave Thomason of Taprock and Elmer's\n\nEmilio Guerrero of El Patron\n\nGwen and Tawni Hendricks of The Vine\n\nBret Musselman of 115 Broiler\n\nTina Gotchall of the Powderhorn\n\nAdam Wehab of Abu's Oasis Deli\n\nTim and Sandra Mock of Beacon Bar & Grill\n\nFAVORITE WAITPERSON\n\nThese people are the ultimate multi-taskers and someone you'd want in a foxhole during a battle. They have peripheral vision, engaging personalities, can handle stress, and can hold everything together when mere mortals are reaching for the razor blades.\n\nTwenty-eight different waitpersons were mentioned in this survey, and the top choice for 2012 was Marty Thomas of River's Edge who, ironically, won for \"Favorite Bartender\" in last y"
