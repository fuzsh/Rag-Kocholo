Landmark History

Over three centuries ago Furneau Southall established his three-hundred acre plantation on the very spot that the Chickahominy Indians had resided on in the years before the westward expansion of the English settlement at Jamestown. The flowing waters of Piney Springs have made this a desirable habitation for centuries. The original log portion of Piney Grove was built about 1790 when this was one of the many seats of Virginia’s prominent Southall family: Today Piney Grove is the best preserved example of Early Log Architecture in Tidewater Virginia. Nearby Southall properties included Mt. Airy, Milton and Vaughn’s: Further a field were the Southall homes of Chatsworth, Reveille, Westham and Young’s Island.

During the second quarter of the eighteenth century Furneau Southall served as deputy-sheriff of Charles City County, under Otway Byrd, son of William Byrd III of Westover. During the American Revolution Southall served on the Charles City County Committee of Safety with John Tyler of Greenway, father of President John Tyler of Woodburn and Sherwood Forest: He also held a captainship of one of the Charles City County companies under Benjamin Harrison of Berkeley. Furneau Southall was also responsible for the local administration of the first Federal Census in 1790.

During the late eighteenth century residents of the plantation included Furneau Southall, his wife and seven children, as well as sixteen slaves - Amy, Bess, Bristol, Critty, Dick, Dublin, Jack, Kate, Lucky, Nutty, Patsey, Pompy, Peter, Rippons, Rose and Silvia. Personal property tax lists reveal the handsome herd of cattle that once grazed on the property and an inventory of Furneau's estate details the furnishings of the plantation house, contents of the library and other luxuries, such as the chariot.
