        "text": "Wild Bunch has addednew films from James Gray, Darren Aronofsky, Marco Tullio Giordana and Rintaro, among others, to its slate ahead of Berlin's European Film Market.\n\nGray's Two Lovers reunites the director with Joaquin Phoenix and also stars Gwyneth Paltrow, Vanessa Shaw and Isabella Rossellini. The romantic drama is produced by 2929 Entertainment and co-financed by 2929 and Wild Bunch. The companies have split territories with Wild Bunch handling Latin America, German speaking Europe and Asia. The film should be ready for Venice or Toronto.\n\nAronofsky's The Wrestler, previously at Summit when Nicolas Cage was attached, is now with Wild Bunch. Mickey Rourke now stars as a faded wrestler trying to reconnect with his estranged daughter while resisting the urge to return to the ring. Rounding out the cast are Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood.\n\nSangue Pazzo is the latest from Giordana and stars Monica Bellucci, Luca Zingaretti and Alessio Boni. As with the director's The Best Of Youth, the film is in two parts and follows the saga of two actors before, during and after the years of Italy's fascist era. Ready for Cannes, the film will be released by 01 Distribuzione in Italy and Ocean Films in France.\n\nFrom Japan's Rintaro comes the animated Yona, Yona Penguin, a fable about a young girl in a magical world. The film is a combination of 2-D and 3-D animation and is available from Wild Bunch worldwide excluding North America, Asia and France.\n\nFor the second year in a row, Wild Bunch will again forego a conventional place at the Berlin Film Festival.\n\nThe company will once again be housed inside a purpose-built cabana on the same piece of land as last year, strategically located between Potsdamer Platz and Martin Gropius Bau and in honor of Steven Soderbergh's Che Guevara films, the cabana's facade will be festooned with a Cuban theme and graffiti to 'make you think you're in Cuba,' says Wild Bunch's Vincent Maraval.\n\nWith Soderbergh in attendance, Wild Bunch will screen a ten-minute promo reel of the first section of the director's Che two-parter, El Argentino. A few images of the second film, Guerilla, may also be shown says Maraval. El Argentino is slated to be ready for Cannes.\n\nFurther, the first promo reel of Howard McCain's sci-fi project Outlander will also be screened.\n\nAlso now on Wild Bunch's slate are South Korean thrillerSeven Days , which has had success in its home territory since its November release. The film is directed by Shin-yeon Won. Wild Bunch is handling sales outside Asia but does not intend to show the film for now as it is aiming for a Cannes slot. In a deal at the AFM, Summit acquired the remake rights with Wild Bunch set to release the eventual remake in its distribution territories.\n\nFrom Finnish director Jukka-Pekka Valkeapaa comes The Visitor about a young boy and his mother whose lives are disrupted by a mysterious stranger. The film was first discovered during the Cannes Film Festival's Atelier program.\n\nThe Country Teacher is from Czech director Bohdan Slama whose last film, Something Like Happiness, took major awards in 2005 in San Sebastian. A love story about friendship, jealousy and compassion, the film is eyeing a Cannes slot.\n\nA first feature from Afghanistan's Barmak Akram, Kabuli Kid is set in modern-day Kabul and could be referred to as the Afghan Central Station. France's Fidelite Films is producing while Winged Migration cinematographer, Laurent Fleutot, shot the film.\n\nCamino , by Spain's Javier Fesser is inspired by the true story of a 14-year-old girl who died in Pamplona in 1984 and who is currently in the process of being canonized. The story is set against the mysterious and little-seen world of the Opus Dei and, according to Wild Bunch, is in the same controversial vein as Peter Mullan's The Magdalene Sisters.\n\nFinally, Wild Bunch will handle video and TV sales on 1993's animated Ocean Waves from producer Studio Ghibli.\n\nOther films on the slate include Philippe Muyl's Magic!, Bruno Podalydes' star-studded Park Benches, Arnaud Desplechin's A Christmas Tale and Antoine de Maximy's Hollywood: I'm Sleeping Over Tonight; all of which were debuted at the recent Unifrance Rendez Vous with French Cinema in Paris."
