        "text": "As the second big name sporting documentary to play at Cannes - following James Toback's marvellous Tyson - Maradona has a lot to live up to. Unfortunately, it fails on almost every level.\n\nEmir Kusturica's film about the self-proclaimed 'greatest footballer of all time' does little to shed light on the tiny Argentinian's incredible talent, or his legendary dark side.\n\nMany of the film's problems arise from Kusturica's lack of access. Over the course of the three years of the film's production, he seems to spend very little time with Diego, ignored on some occassions, barely given the time of day on others.\n\nThe filmmaker therefore feels he has to pad proceedings out with scenes from his own past films. However, these desperate attempts to draw parallels between artist and subject seem both self-indulgent, and worse still, irrelevant.\n\nCombined with Kusturica's intrusive and at times plain bonkers narration, it makes for a film that sheds little light on this most remarkable of little men.\n\nThat's not to say Maradona doesn't contain moments of insight. He genuinely opens up about his drug addicted past, and when talking about his children, seems like a genuinely sympathetic, if still slightly crazy, character. And whether in Bueons Aires, Naples or Belgrade, the obsession for the man is still undeniable, and Kusturica certainly captures the fan's fervour.\n\nBut the fact remains that we never truly get under Diego's skin, and the result is that Maradona remains as much a mystery as a marvel. Oh, and a warning to English football fans. The film contains countless shots of the infamous 'Hand of God' goal, and even more of the 'Goal of the Century' that followed, both of which are still as painful to watch today as they were 22 years ago."
