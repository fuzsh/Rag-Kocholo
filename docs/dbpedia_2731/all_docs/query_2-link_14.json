        "text": "Little Homages Throughout The Town\n\nThere are little homages to the movie all throughout the town like music plays from the movie. You have alleyways dedicated to movie stars and cleverly labeled names. They even have George Bush (the former American President) displayed behind bars via a painting in one of the buildings.\n\nThere is an Ivo Andric Library named after a famous writer that the director of the film, Emir Kusturica loved. Milorad Cavic, the Serbian swimmer in the 2008 Olympics, he has a pool named after him here. The director even lives in the town still. There is a street dedicated to Nikola Tesla, and another to Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, Diego Maradona, and Novak Djokovic.\n\nI don't speak or read Cyrillic, so to be honest it was a bit of a tough one to navigate the town, but that also sparks joy in me - figuring out the puzzle of travel.\n\nThere is also the Stanley Cubric Theatre where the first screening of ‘Life is a Miracle’ was played. They also have tennis courts, a ski area across the valley, a childrens playground, and the red and white limousine that was used in the film as well.\n\nAccommodation Review\n\nDrvengrad means timber town, and you can stay in these fully functioning timber houses. They also have newly built and renovated accommodations with more head room and modern comforts as well.\n\nThe aesthetic in the remodeled areas are ones of neutrals and cozy comforts to reflect the calm peaceful setting outside. The hallways could do with a bit of cleaning, and there are no elevators to get to your rooms in any of the buildings. The rooms are clearly labeled and utilizes a traditional key.\n\nThe rooms are spacious, with cozy blankets, firm mattresses and even some herbally infused soaps that are left in the room for you with a book in syrillic that explains different medicinal properties of plants for you to read.\n\nThe bathrooms are spacious, with modern toilets, roomy shower with a rainfall shower head, heated tile floors, and a towel warmer.\n\nDon’t make the mistake I did, let in some fresh air, then leave and forget to turn the light off. There are no bug screens and I had a whole family of flying critters in my room that I spent a good hour swatting with a towel in order to sleep and not be creeped out one would fly into my mouth or ear (#mouthbreather).\n\nThe Wi-Fi is strong, and you can control the temps of the room easily. I really felt cozy and calm in my room and really did enjoy that part of the stay.\n\nRestaurant Review At Drvengrad\n\nDrvengrad means timber town, and you can stay in these fully functioning timber houses. They also have newly built and renovated accommodations with more headroom and modern comforts as well.\n\nThe aesthetic in the remodeled areas are ones of neutrals and cozy comforts to reflect the calm peaceful setting outside. The hallways could do with a bit of cleaning, and there are no elevators to get to your rooms in any of the buildings.

There are no bug screens and I had a whole family of flying critters in my room that I spent a good hour swatting with a towel in order to sleep and not be creeped out one would fly into my mouth or ear (#mouthbreather).\n\nThe Wi-Fi is strong, and you can control the temps of the room easily. I really felt cozy and calm in my room and really did enjoy that part of the stay.\n\nWhen we arrived in Drvengrad it was evening, but the sun hadn’t set yet - it was the beginning of October so the sun was setting a bit earlier each day. We got our stuff into our rooms and immediately headed to dinner. We chose Viscounts Restaurant and I was really excited, despite the cool welcome we got from the receptionist staff (maybe they had a bad day, who knows).\n\nDinner was horrible - I got the pasta carbonara (how do you mess that up) - it tasted like they put a 1/4 cup of salt into my dish folks. I am pretty forgiving when it comes to food I don’t have to cook, but this…..(shivers)…..I took a few bites and had to stop - it was bad.\n\nI did notice that food throughout the Balkans is REALLY salty. I don’t know if that is because the majority of people smoke, and you have the ability to taste your food adequately, so they just add a ton of salt to make it work - or what was happening. This was by far the saltiest food I’ve had though.\n\nMy friends I was traveling with also had the same experience with their dishes and food choices. One of them ended up getting pretty sick that night and was worshiping the toilet, without even indulging on the brandy (that legit tasted like gasoline smells).\n\nThe Visconti also has options for Pizza, Fish, pork and sausage dishes, soups and chowders, salads, desserts, vegetables, fries, potatoes, and spinach.\n\nBeware of the stray dogs, they can get pretty aggressive when you feed them even a morsel apparently. It made me really miss my dogs at home, and it was really really difficult to not scoop them up, give them a bath, and feed them meat. Although with how salty the food was, it probably wouldn’t have been good for them anyway.\n\nThe breakfast had plenty of options, salt optional, and lots of varieties of juices, tea, and coffee there. The other bars and restaurants there - we didn’t try though. If you end up visiting and want to give it a try you also have Kapor Bar, Ćorkan’s Cake Shop (Ćorkan), Konak Pizzeria and Cafe, and Lotika Restaurant.\n\nOther Activities Near Drvengrad\n\nTara Canyon is stunning, located in Montenegro, it is a great spot to stop while you are in the area as it is the deepest canyon in Europe. There are a few bars lining the busy roadways, and even a zip line that can take you across the canyon!\n\nIt does require that you bring cash, and apologies that I can’t remember quite what it cost, but I believe 30 Euros would be plenty but bring small bills. The bars also require cash, and you cannot use ANYONE’S restroom unless you buy something from their shop - they do guard it and the shops are so small you can’t sneak in. Not that I know anything about trying to sneak into a questionable bathroom in the middle of no where (ahem).\n\nStopic Cave is a bit of a drive from Drvengrad but just look up pictures and go. It is a giant limestone cave, with colorfully lit lights, and is the most visited cave in Serbia. I personally didn’t get to visit, and was completely gutted, but at this point in the trip - after all the driving from Dubrovnik we had done - jet lag and exhaustion was starting to hit hard so we opted to just relax. If you end up going, let me know what you thought in the comments below.\n\nSmestaj\"Iver\" - Mećavnik is a ski resort that is across the valley from Drvengrad. The mountains look fairly decent with a few runs. The slopes are steep and you can stay at Hotel Iver located right on the mountainside. They have a pool, sauna, fireplace, Turkish bath, salt room, and gym and the hotel only houses 50 guests so you really have a chance to unwind and enjoy some serene solitude skiing here. They do have ski equipment you can rent here.\n\nAt the bottom of the valley you have Nature Park \"Sargan-Mokra Gora\". This is where you will find the eight-train railway, with vintage trains you can ride in. You can book through Serbia Railways via email (reserve it that way) and then pay 1000 red or 8.5 Euros to ride the train. It lasts about 2.5 hours and has 5 stops that are about 5-15 min each depending on the stop. Make sure to arrive early as is a very popular thing to do for locals in the summer (arrive at least 40 min early).\n\nThings To Know Before Visiting Drvengrad\n\nMost of the places in and surrounding Drvengrad deal only in cash. They do take cards at the reception desk and the restaurants - everything else is in cash. They prefer Serbian Dinar because they aren’t exactly friends with the European Union (because of the Yugoslavian Wars).\n\nAmerica bombed Belgrade in the 1990s over the Bosnian wars, and people still aren’t huge fans of Americans here and you can certainly feel it. Understandable, but when we visited, the war in Ukraine was also still going on and sanctions against Russia were escalating. There are a lot of Russians that visit this area as well, due to many of the signs being in Cyrillic.\n\nGoogle Translate is going to be your best friend here, as there are very few signs in English (again, understandable - just providing the information). Use the picture feature and it will help you navigate around the area. It will also help with ordering food and getting checked in. I don’t think people there want to admit they speak English - or at least the ones that we encountered anyway.\n\nIt gets COLD here in the mountains of Serbia - so make sure you have at least a fleece jacket and some warm pants and gloves. The showers get toasty warm, and you can put your clothes and PJs on the towel warmer to warm them up before bed (#lifehack).\n\nThere is plenty of parking here, but if you are driving please please be fully alert on the roads - they are NOT the best, full of potholes, and people are a bit crazy with the driving. If you speed and get pulled over, you basically will need to bribe the cop, so don’t speed.\n\nGoogle Maps isn’t super reliable in the Balkans, it will take you on the shortest route, but that doesn’t always mean the safest route. A good rule of thumb is to only go on the roads that have actual names to them - if you turn onto any dirt road or a rural area road just try to find a different route. There were a few times when a large truck nearly slid back into me and the 4 cars behind me on a steep incline that said it was a road. Another time Google Maps took us over a partially collapsed bridge and an abandoned road that only hikers used and nearly left us stranded in a giant mud puddle in the middle of the mountains with no cell signal. It can get narly out there folks, so again, only go on roads that have names and after we started following that rule we didn’t have any issues whatsoever.\n\nFinal Thoughts On Drvengrad\n\nWhile I wouldn’t rave to my friends about visiting Drvengrad, nor would I recommend going there for anything to eat in particular - I do see the appeal of a quiet moment in the mountains away from the city. The adventure of driving there is something I will never forget, and it was a taste of Serbia, and realize that it doesn’t represent the country as a whole.\n\nTravel is subjective, and maybe the people I encountered had a bad day, maybe someone died, or maybe they had relatives killed in the bombing of their capital - you just never know. So while my visit felt like a train wreck of heebie-jeebies of cold stares, salt licks, and the insect apocalypse in my room (my own fault on this last one) - I do think if I avoided the restaurants, got food elsewhere, and then just enjoyed the stars, friends, and cozy rooms it would have been a relaxing and enjoyable stay enjoying this quirky little town.\n\nThat being said, let me know in the comments below if you would visit Drvengrad. Have you been there before? I would genuinely love to hear about others' experiences.\n\nNo matter what I hope you have a grand adventure on your next trip!"
