Following the construction of the high damn, it was discovered that Nubia and its antiquities were facing the threat of flooding. Dr. Tharwat Okasha the then Egyptian culture minister, spearheaded a worldwide campaign to rescue the Nubia antiquites to which the UNESCO responded positively. Among the salvaged antiquities were the Ramses II Temple in Abu Simbel which was moved to a mountain beyond water level.\n\nCutting the monument into slabs, to be raised by giant cranes and transported by huge tractors to the new site, was an unprecedented architectural process. Canadian director john Patrick feeney shot the stages of the temple relocation. But he discovered that his documentary was lacking information and illustrations on the history of building the monument. There was need for information covering 3500 years since Ramses II commissioned the construction of the temple to immortalize his era and deeds.\n\nBicar drew illustrations depending on historical and geometrical information provided on this grand architectural structure. It took him more than two years to complete those works during which he visisted Nubia and Thebes. He moved between the two towns on a Nile boat.\n\nAbu Simbel is the only Egyptian temple hewn out of mountain rocks. Like wise, the sphinx is the only statue carved from a solid rock. So the Ramses II temple in Nubia is more akin to the hewn statue that to architecture. This makes it of an artistic and historical value far higher than the rest of the ancient Egyptian antiquities.\n\nThe film sequence provides an impressive picture of civilization which is a source of pride for Egypt. Depending on drawings on papyri, the first steps of design were initiated, through which we got a glimpse of architects and scientists, their costumes and workplaces. Inside the palace hall, we see the king, his wife Nefertari and entourage celebrate the start of work, dancers sway to music. The scene is then shifted to the mountain whose rocks will be immortalized. We see the dawn and the sun rises to symbolize the beginning of work on the pristine rocks, workers engrave the faÃ§ade of the temple and make it a smooth surface on which the camera takes the viewer to follow four statues of Ramses II in black, later colored in red to conform with the artistic rules followed by pharaohs in stone engravings. The film traces the temple being hewn out of the rocks and artists' paintings on its walls; it reaches the climax at the inauguration ceremony where tunes of tambourines and drums fill the air. The sun rises and the magnificent king basks in the sacred moment for which he has built the temple. The holy of holies is bathed in the light of the rising sun. The screen is overwhelmed in sunshine for the first time and we see in the clear lights the beauty of colors and the brightness as though the smell of their paint is still wafting around.\n\nThen we are taken to see the temple with its yellow rocky colors covered in waves of sand as some European tourists look at the great monument in awe.\n\nBicar's works, commissioned for the documentary demonstrate mastery of his art and craft. Like the ancient Egyptian architect, Bicar shows brilliance and precision. It is a great work of creativity. By drawing on imagination and consulting books of history. He has breathed life back into a full era of ancient history. Thus, the era appears vibrant with hundreds of fine details. Reference: \"BIKAR.\" A book by Sobhy EL Sharouny (2002). BIKAR. Dar el Shorouk.\n\nDr. Tharwt Okasha, ex minister for culture and founder of the Academy of Arts, commented on the loss of the Eighth Wonder 2002:\n\n\" ... I never forget the day I assigned to Canadian filmmaker John Feeney the task of a documentary film to be called \" The Eighth Wonder \". It took Feeney, four years of preparation. He painstakingly researched every detail of the historical building of the temples of Abu Simbel. The acclaimed Hussein Bicar, one of Egypt's foremost painters painted the plates for the film having been entrusted with recording the stages of construction of the original temples, which remain the pride of human civilization, together they brought to life the daily labor of bringing to life this monument of ancient architectural genius. This film has disappeared from the face of the earth in a mysterious way and no trace of it is found , but Bicar's paintings remain as an immortal artistic record of the saving of the temples of Abu Semble , as Michelangelo's creation epic on the roof of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican\n\nThe film was produced under the supervision of the Director of the Egyptian Center for Documentary Film, Hassan Fouad. And the historical material was prepared by Dr. Shehata Adam\n\nThe film script was a collaborative effort between Bicar and John feeney. The music score was composed by an Italian musician, inspired by Pharoanic tunes which Bicar performed on the Mandolin. The commentary of the film was in English and Arabic and was produced in cinema laboratories in Rome for showing in movie theaters in Egypt and in Egyptian cultural centers abroad. It was shown in the Berlin festival for documentary films in 1973. A copy of the film was dedicated by directorJohn Feeney to The New Zealand Film Archive before passing away in 2006.\n\nThe Eight Wonder\n\nDirector: John Feeney\n\nCountry of Production: Egypt\n\nYear of production:\n\nDuration: 13 minutes\n\nAbout The Resistance (Work In Progress)\n\nSpecial screenings Competition\n\nDirector: El Tornillo de Klaus (Alicia V Palacios Thomas and Pablo CristÃ³bal)\n\nSynopsis: A group of young people called the âGuarimberosâ devote themselves to the rehabilitation of the only movie theater in Amantea, a small town in southern Italy.\n\nRead More\n\nAbout The Resistance (Work In Progress)\n\nSpecial screenings Competition\n\nDirector: El Tornillo de Klaus (Alicia V Palacios Thomas and Pablo CristÃ³bal)\n\nsynopsis:\n\nA group of young people called the âGuarimberosâ devote themselves to the rehabilitation of the only movie theater in Amantea, a small town in southern Italy.\n\nDuration: 50 minutes\n\nYear of Production:\n\nCountry of Production: Italy\n\nAbout the director (s):\n\nEl Tornillo de Klaus is Spanish filmmaking duo of Alicia V Palacios Thomas and Pablo CristÃ³bal.
