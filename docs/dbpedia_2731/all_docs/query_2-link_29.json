        "text": "Synopsis\n\nSoccer icon Diego Maradona hit the big screen in Cannes on Tuesday in an exuberant documentary depicting him as a rebel fighting Western imperialism first through football, now through friendship with Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez.\n\nCANNES: Soccer icon Diego Maradona hit the big screen in Cannes on Tuesday in an exuberant documentary depicting him as a rebel fighting Western imperialism first through football, now through friendship with Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez.\n\n���Maradona���, by Serbian director Emir Kusturica, got its premiere just days after another sporting ���bad boy���, boxer Mike Tyson, turned up in Cannes for a flattering film on his own rise from mean streets to global notoriety. Maradona, notorious for his post-football descent into drugs, is perhaps best known for his role in knocking England out of the 1986 World Cup in a 2-1 victory.\n\nHe scored both goals, the first infamously helped by the ���Hand of God��� and the second so stunning it has been called the ���Goal of the Century���. For Kusturica, that victory was a triumph by the ���third world��� over the West, which he said imposes its rule on countries like Argentina and Serbia, using weapons such as the International Monetary Fund and NATO bombs.\n\n���I cannot understand why the earth was not knocked off its axis after the match when a billion people like me jumped for joy,��� he told reporters after he and the footballer briefly showed off their soccer skills for the benefit of photographers. To ram the point home, Kusturica���s film shows the ���Goal of the Century��� again and again, each time transforming the sequence into animated scenes in which Maradona slaloms past cheating opponents such as Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair or George Bush.\n\nThese short scenes are accompanied by the Sex Pistols��� thumping punk rock anthem ���God Save The Queen���. Kusturica, who has twice won the Palme d���Or top prize at Cannes for ���When Father Was Away on Business��� and ���Underground���, a film about the disintegration of Yugoslavia, shows Maradona warts and all in his new 90-minute film.\n\nHe dwells at length on the player���s struggle to fight his cocaine addiction and shows him brawling on the soccer pitch. But he asks no probing questions and never tries to make him back up his staunch political views. Kusturica makes it clear that for him, as for millions of other football fans round the world, Maradona is a hero.\n\nAnd Maradona clearly took to the Serb too, visiting him in his home in Serbia, inviting him onto his television show and telling reporters Tuesday that he had ���opened his heart to him���.\n\nThe film at times seems like a mutual appreciation society for the footballer and the director, who provides the commentary and appears in many of the scenes. Explaining his frequent on-screen presence, Kusturica explained ���there were times when I couldn���t find Diego in Buenos Aires,��� so had to fill in.\n\nThe documentary shows Maradona hobnobbing with Chavez, the left-wing president of Venezuela, and Cuba���s Fidel Castro, and wearing a T-shirt with a picture of a blood-spattered US president George Bush.\n\nAsked why it focuses so much on politics, the Argentinian said: ���Even if you���re a footballer you have the right to state your opinion on someone who���s a murderer,��� referring to Bush. Maradona became addicted to drink and drugs and saw his weight balloon after he retired in 1997.\n\nBut despite his excesses, Diego Armando Maradona, born into poverty in 1960 in Buenos Aires, continues to enjoy the adulation of millions of Argentinians and has managed successful stints as a television presenter. In March 2007, Maradona was readmitted to an Argentine hospital for treatment for hepatitis and the effects of alcohol abuse, then released and re-admitted.\n\nA year ago he insisted his drinking and drug abuse were behind him. His extraordinary talents put him on a level with Pele, the Brazilian previously widely accepted as the best player ever. Kusturica���s film is being screened in Cannes outside of the competition.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nTata Consumer Products needs a Starbucks ‘shot’ to increase its market value exponentially\n\nPorts to power, what companies facing insolvency mean for Adani Group\n\nA list of 20 large-cap stocks where you have lost money big time.\n\nThe challenges dotting India’s push for 6G leadership\n\nAre Yamaha dealer IPO investors and Sir Isaac Newton on the same page?\n\nThe many gaps in conflict of interest allegations against Sebi chief, other Indian regulators\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
