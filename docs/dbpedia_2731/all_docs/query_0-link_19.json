In the case of the Berlinale International Jury I served on in February, we didn’t need persuading - it was part of the deal. It wasn’t even the elephant in the room, since everyone we met mentioned it all the time. It may even be the main reason why a critic experienced in watching long subtitled films was selected to be on this prestigious jury - a very rare occurrence at A-list festivals these days. The film in question was Lav Diaz’s Lullaby to the Sorrowful Mystery, and it was successful - our jury awarded it the Silver Bear Alfred Bauer prize for “a feature film that opens new perspectives”. Diaz himself thanked the jury for its “endurance”. The length of a film is, of course, partly dependent on the culture it comes from. Hollywood used to prefer 90 minutes, now 1 20 minutes. Bollywood films are routinely over 180 minutes. But why is watching long films regarded as something to be endured? Why this talk of marathons, as if it were a sport involving necessary pain to achieve a goal? Whenever someone asks me how I can sit still for so long, I tend to say, “You’ve probably done it yourself,” and we usually discover that the questioner has. If you’ve binge-watched, say, all five series of The Wire, then, arguably, you’ve watched a film drama that’s approaching 60 hours in length - far more than an average working week - a fact that makes watching Lullaby seem a lightweight experience in comparison. Purists will argue that watching The Wire in dribs and drabs at home is nothing like watching cinema, that only by seeing a film uninterrupted, in a well-attended auditorium does one give proper respect to the work. They’re right to some extent - and Mark Cousins discusses this in his column this month (see page 12)- but I’m not so sure cinema always needs such reverence. An old-style intermission such as the one Tarantino built into his 70mm film print screenings of TheHatefiil Eight, can work either way. I found Tarantino’s film (a mere three hours and seven minutes in 70mm), satisfying before the interval, but less so afterwards, whereas the one-hour break offered at our Lullaby screening was to me entirely refreshing to the film. Experience in binge-watching box-sets may be why watching a long film - when you actually sit down, prepared to go the distance - no longer feels so daunting for many people. Lullaby is now the longest film I’ve seen in a single day, overtaking the more intense seven- and-a-half-hour experience of Bda Tarfis Sdtdntango why is watching long films regarded as something to be endured? Why this talk of marathons, involving necessary pain to achieve a goal? more than a dozen years ago, which I found frustrating because, while I loved it deeply, I lacked the energy to savour every moment as much as I wanted. The analogy with long-form TV drama works, I believe, because all long films tend to be episodic in structure. Jacques Rivette’s near-i 3-hour Out i, for instance - which, to my mild shame. I’ve yet to see - has eight distinct episodes, according to Tony Rayns (‘Out in the open’. Home Cinema, S&S, March). What’s curious about watching long films are the rhythms and rituals you develop. Self-consciousness is part of the package. Obviously, you need to concentrate when there’s a lot happening, and can let the film wash over you when something more stately is going on. You’ll find too that you can be more generally contemplative watching very long films, a very enriching feeling. Physically you’ll want to make sure you don’t get dehydrated or hungry, that your stomach doesn’t audibly rumble or worse. It’s difficult to choose the right moment to skip out to the loo, but a v^de-shot crowd scene that seems like it wants to take its time might be good, even if you still run the risk of missing something. You can create your own stepping stones by checking the time every once in a while; you’ll do it less frequently when the film has your full attention. All this becomes obvious once you’re in the experience. There is the question of whether extended length makes a film more memorable. I would say certain images remain in your mind for longer, something that partially compensates for the obvious time commitment required. When it comes to Diaz, there may be a difference between the phenomenon of seeing a Diaz film for the first time and seeing a second or third film by him, in that the initial experience constitutes an unusual cultural immersion, whereas any subsequent viewings will bring the critical faculties of comparison to bear. “Look at him, he’s like a trained athlete,” mocked one of my fellow jurors gently at me as we went into the screening of Lullaby. But I’d say we can all do the heavy watching now, whether it’s TV series or marathon movies, and the rewards are, perhaps, those of a more texturally weighty, novelistic form of cinema. © April 2016 | Sight&Sound | 5 Rushes NEWS AND VIEWS IN THE FRAME ALL THE WORLD’S A SCREEN Language is no barrier to loving Shakespeare - as shown by the global popularity of his plays as a source for cinema Lear and present danger: Kurosawa Akira’s Ran By David Thompson “Perhaps the most successful Shakespeare film ever made was the Japanese Macbeth, Throne of Blood. This had hardly any words, and none of them by Shakespeare.” That was the judgement of Peter Hall in 1969, a year after he produced a critically panned film version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream While Hall, for all his famous honouring of the text, failed to make the greatest of dramatists come to life on film, in Throne of Blood (1957) Kurosawa Akira boldly applied the visual artistry he displayed in the Seven Samurai (1954) to create a poetic and thrilling adventure out of the Bard’s bloody tragedy Of around 200 sound films made from Shakespeare’s plays, about 50 are in a foreign language. In the silent era, filmmakers had no particular issue with the verse, since title cards could be easily translated and of necessity often consisted of a simple precis. Shakespeare adaptations were plentiful in France and Italy, and Germany produced two feature-length films - Othello (ig22) with Emil Jannings, and Hamlet (igio) with Asta Nielsen. The androgynous Nielsen was not just indulging in some fashionable cross-dressing, as Sarah Bernhardt had done. She played the character as a melancholic princess, required for the purposes of succession to pose as a man and guard her secret from the object of her love, Horatio. In Russia, Shakespeare became especially popular following the death of Stalin, under whom the censor was dismissive of Hamlet’s “indecisiveness and depression” as “incompatible with the new Soviet spirit of optimism, fortitude and clarity”. When Grigori Kozintsev made his epic ’Scope version of Hamlet (ig64), he showed Elsinore as a veritable prison, the court a hotbed of murderous intrigue and his hero oppressed by a new dictator in the shape of Claudius. Kozintsev maximised the elemental aspects of Shakespeare even further in his King Lear (i 970). He placed the waning king in a world populated by the oppressed poor, the homeless victims of civil war ON OUR RADAR BFI Flare London’s LGBT festival turns 30 this year and, to celebrate, there’s an enticing selection of great new films, including Barbara Hammer’s documentary about poet Elizabeth Bishop, ‘Welcome to This House’ (rights The programme also revives films from its archive, among them Silas Howard and Harry Dodge’s 2001 feature ‘By Hook or by Crook’. Howard, the first transgender director of the TV series ‘Transparent! will also attend to discuss his career. Criterion The US home cinema label that set the bar for high-quality, extras- laden DVD and Blu-ray packages is launching in the UK on 18 April, with five titles: silent slapstick ‘Speedy’, classic screwball ‘It Happened One Night’ documentary ‘Grey Gardens’, Roman Polanski’s ‘Macbeth’ and Sydney Pollack’s ‘Tootsie’. 6 I Sight&Sound | April 2016 LISTOMANIA COURTROOM FILMS Excellent fancy: Shahid Kapoor in the title role of Vishal Bhardwaj’s Haider who share his crowded hovel. Kozintsev strove to stay faithful to Shakespeare’s text by using Boris Pasternak’s translations - curiously dismissed by Andrei Tarkovsky as “staggeringly inaccurate” (Tarkovsky produced Hamlet on stage himself, and was planning a film version before his death). The powerful music Shostakovich composed for Kozintsev’s films set a standard few could match, though Takemitsu Toru came close in his Mahlerian score for Kurosawa’s Ran (1985). Like Throne of Blood, this transferred Shakespearian characters to a medieval Japanese context. While the three witches in Macbeth had become a single ghost out of Noh theatre, this Lear was based on a real historical figure, a ruthless warlord who divided his kingdom among three sons. Ran was clearly as much an expression of an ageing director’s inner turmoil as an epic nihilistic drama, but it remains one of the most imposing Shakespeare adaptations from any source. The country outside Britain that has most frequently adapted Shakespeare to the screen is India, for which presumably a colonial inheritance can be thanked. There are examples going back to the 1940s, but within the last decade there have been two lavish Bollywood musical treatments of Romeo and Juliet, arguably aesthetically closer to the New York of West Side Story (1961) than to an imaginary Verona. One director, Vishal Bhardwaj, has made raw, compelling crime dramas out of Macbeth, Othello and Hamlet- Maqbool (2004), Omkara (2006) and Haider {2014), respectively. The last is especially striking for its use of the 1995 Kashmir conflicts as a background, with its young hero a student who turns revolutionary in his quest for the truth about his father’s death. Clothing Shakespearean plots in familiar cinema genres has long been Hollywood’s ploy to avoid confusing an audience with a text full of idioms and meanings lost over 400 years. Many foreign-language adaptations have also enjoyed this lack of responsibility, from Italian westerns {Johnny Hamlet, 1968) to wuxia epics (Feng Xiaogang’s version of Hamlet, The Banquet, 2006). My personal prize goes to Aid Kaurismaki’s Hamlet Goes Business (1987), a hilarious, deadpan take, set in a family-run rubber-duck company and adding an unexpected twist to its morbid conclusion. As a nod to Kozintsev, Kaurismaki even makes ironic use of Shostakovich on his soundtrack. © O Ran is rereleased in the UK on 1 April. ‘Shakespeare on Film’ runs at BFI Southbank, London, from 31 March - 31 May.

April 2016 | Sight&Sound | 7 RUSHES OBJECT LESSON SWEET DREAMS From the family-size Malteser box to Cdine and Julie’s magic bonbons, confectionery is integral to the experience of movie-going By Hannah McGill The association between eating sweets and watching movies dates back to the nickelodeon theatres of the early 20th century, which were quickly recognised as prime retail opportunities by popcorn and candy vendors. The concession stand soon became a vital aspect of cinema business, and to this day is often a more reliable source of income than the films themselves. Arguably, the historic link between indulgent foodstuffs and movie viewing contributes to the enduring perception of cinema as a lesser artform, the function of which is to be buzzily calorific rather than nourishing. In Cdine and Julie Go Boating (1974), however, Jacques Rivette gives the maligned sweetie a more creative role. Sweets are not an accompaniment to cinematic escapism, but the key to it: only by consuming coloured candies can Cdine and Julie access the alternate reality in which they get to watch other lives play out. The idea is a faintly druggy one, of course - although this pair are portrayed more as gauche, curious children than intoxicated hipsters. It clearly draws on Alice in Wonderland, references to which abound throughout the film: Alice too can move between realms and manipulate her own corporeal form by eating sweetmeats. But the sweeties are also part of a battery of feminine objects - lipsticks, dolls, tarot cards, sick room flowers, gloves - that are toyed with and subverted by Cdine, Julie and the ghosts they encounter. Munching and watching, thrilled by the turns in the narrative, the two women are a happy caricature of absorbed spectatorship. But they are also the very definition of active spectators. They literally place themselves within the story, identif3dng with the narrative strongly enough to affect it. Sugar rush: Celine andJulie Go Boating (1974) Female consumers of soft-centred melodrama, the film suggests, need not be considered passive: there are sweet things the eating of which can confer insight and creative power. The idea that misery befalls those who succumb to sweet temptations is an inheritance from myth and fairytale - Persephone baited with pomegranate seeds. Hansel and Gretel ensnared by the gingerbread house - given its most vivid cinematic life in the two versions of Roald Dahl’s story, Wz’/Zp Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (ig-ji) and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (200^). Failure to properly manage one’s appetites spells susceptibility to decadence and danger. Sofia Coppola’s Marie Antoinette (2005), though it largely pleads sympathy for its much maligned subject, also emphasises her lack of social perspective by surrounding her with sweetmeats. A boy aptly named Hansel is tempted via a trail of Gummy Bears into a relationship that will cost him more than his heart in Hedwig and the Angry Inch (2001). The freaky sweetshop in The Wicker Man (1973), with its skulls, toads, chocolate rams’ heads, life-sized iced babies and “lovely March hares”, provides one of the early indicators that all is not as it should be on Summerisle. In Life Is Sweet (1990) chocolate provides routes to self-denial, self-indulgence and self-abasement alike for the miserable Nicola. And in Dusan Makavejev’s stomach-churning satire Sweet Movie {igy 4) the association between sugary stuff and 8 I Sight&Sound | April 2016 THE FIVE KEY... FILMS ABOUT WITCHES Arguably, the link between indulgent foodstuffs and movies contributes to the perception of cinema as a lesser arfform corruption goes still further, with juxtaposed imagery of food, sex, defecation and death; the female body presented as if for consumption; and a female serial killer who uses sweets to lure her male victims to their deaths. A sugar rush needn’t always leave a nasty aftertaste, however. Perhaps in recognition of the historically symbiotic relationship between candy and cinema, and certainly as a specific sop to paying commercial interests, a weakness for sweets has sometimes been used to humanise a character. Reese’s Pieces encourage us to love the alien in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (igSi); a Baby Ruth bar turns Sloth from a monster to a friend in The Goonies (i 985); and a free-spirited lady chocolatier brings sex and sweetness to the lives of abstemious bores in Chocolat (2000). The notion of sweets as a source of subversive female power is given free rein in Candyman (1992), in which the ghost of a murdered slave steals children and leaves a calling card of razorblades in candy wrappers. As his story is revealed, the film’s murderous monster becomes its tragic hero; and his vengeful mantle passes to the ghost of his victim, Helen, whom he seduces with the phrase “Sweets to the sweet...” As Candyman has punished the descendants of those who lynched him, Helen punishes her unfaithful husband and the patriarchy that protects him. The industries of slavery and romance, after all, owe even more to sugar than the movies do. © Forget your toil and trouble, and enjoy a spell of relaxation with this coven-ready list of screen sorceresses By Nikki Baughan For his first feature The Witch (reviewed on page 66), the writer-director Robert Eggers has mined historical documents from America’s colonial past to craft the story of a family torn apart by accusations of witchcraft in the Puritan heartland of early i /th-century New England. While Eggers’s film is being praised for its terrifying authenticity, the shadowy figure of the witch has long been a source of fascination to filmmakers, across myriad nationalities and genres. Whether she be crone or hag, enchantress or vamp, one thing remains constant: a witch’s power, of either the practical or seductive variety, should never be underestimated, as these five examples show. 2 Suspiria (1977) The nightmarish imagery of giallo master Dario Argento’s study of occultism in 1970s Germany conjures up a vision of witchcraft rooted in ancient European tradition. An innocent American student (the wide- eyed Jessica Harper) enrols in a German dance studio only to discover it is run by a coven of grotesque harridans. It’s a visceral culture clash that’s not soon forgotten. 4 The Craft (1996) Adolescence and the occult are natural bedfellows, mood swings and sexual awakenings being their own kind of powerful black magic. Filmmaker Andrew Fleming makes the most of this beguiling thematic symbiosis, allowing his teen coven to wreak increasing amounts of havoc on their high- school contemporaries until their abilities threaten to overwhelm their true sense of self. I Haxan: Witchcraft Through the Ages (1922) Danish director Benjamin Christensen’s film recounts the history of European witchcraft from the Middle Ages and, thanks to its procession of potent images, still packs a punch almost a century after release. It’s also a deft psychological exploration of hysteria - the hysteria of the grief-stricken woman, branded as a witch after the death of her lover, and of those eager to blame such emotions on the occult. 3 The Witches of Eastwick (1987) The witches of George Miller’s mid-8os camp classic are a triptych of singletons (Cher, Michelle Pfeiffer and Susan Sarandon) who use their combined power to summon their dream man - who turns out to be the devil (Jack Nicholson). Despite somewhat chauvinistic assumptions about women’s priorities, the film uses the supernatural effectively to poke fun at the traditional relationship between the sexes. 5 Drag Me to Hell (2009) The witch in Sam Raimi’s schlocker is the very definition of a crone - a haggard, twisted old woman who unleashes a powerful curse on the young loan officer (Alison Lohman) who evicts her from her home. While Raimi’s on-the-nose B-movie pastiche is played for laughs, the fact that the witch’s ancient powers easily best the exuberance of youth is terrifying for a modern horror audience.

ARROWFILMS.CO.uk RUSHES INTERVIEW AFTERSHOCK Alice Winocour: ‘I don’t want my film to be looked at only because it’s a female thing’ With a film she co-wrote in the running for an Oscar and her second feature as director on release, Alice Winocour is on a roll By Simran Hans Writer-director Alice Winocour cut her teeth at La Femis (class of 2002), Paris’s most prestigious film school, where she met fellow filmmaker Deniz Gamze Ergiiven. While she found funding for her debut Augustine (2012), a period drama about female hysteria set in 19th-century Paris, Ergiiven struggled to finance her first feature. In 201 5 they co-wrote, and Ergiiven directed. Mustang, a drama about the physical and mental oppression of five sisters in a Turkish village. The only film by a female director nominated for an Oscar in 2016, in the Best Foreign Language Film category, it will be released in the UK in May. Winocour’s new film Disorder^ldLjs with similar themes of paranoia and bodily disconnection, though her focus has shifted from the feminine. Matthias Schoenaerts is Vincent, a soldier-turned-bodyguard sent to protect a Lebanese businessman’s trophy wife (Diane Kruger), all the while suffering the after-effects of a stint in Afghanistan. Schoenaerts inhabits the role of a man moving through a world he no longer understands; Winocour makes the audience inhabit his perceptions. Her camera shifts erratically, juddering or moving as though it’s being dragged through molasses; the dizzying, dreamlike effect is doubly unsettling when coupled with the distorted electronic score by French techno DJ Gesaffelstein (ne Mike Levy). Simran Hans: What inspired you to make a film about trauma? Alice Winocour: I had a special relationship with the subject: I suffered myself from PTSD. When I gave birth to my daughter I almost died, and I woke up in the hospital and didn’t know where I was. I remember feeling vertigo; I only had memories of the sounds of this experience. At first when I write something I need to be really connected to the subject in a very intimate way; it was the same with my first feature, Augustine, which was about hysterics, and women expressing rebellion with their bodies. I imagined this soldier coming back from war and you never know if there is a real threat around the house, or if it’s the effect of his paranoia. To me, doubt is the major ingredient for the paranoid thriller - 1 really wanted the audience to feel this vertigo as the character. That’s why we worked to make the sound so weird, so that you never know if it’s a dream, a nightmare or reality. SH: What were your reference points? AW: I was really inspired by narratives such as [Jeff Nichols’s] Take Shelter [2011] or The Conversation [1974], by Coppola- where the audience is in the head and in the body of the character. I also thought a lot about Antonioni’s La notte [1961]- the party was inspired by that movie. I was also really inspired by the work of Don McCullin - you know, the one who did the picture for Blow-Up. SH: Can you tell me about Gesaffelstein and the work you both did on the sound design? AW: I’m a fan of electro music and of Gesaffelstein I suffered from PTSD. When I gave birth I almost died, and I woke up in the hospital and didn’t know where I was in particular. I found his music was kind of violent but at the same time exhilarating. There’s just something about it that feels like the end of the world and everything falling apart that’s at the same time almost religious. Also, I thought we had to recreate - because there are no flashbacks in the film - the mental landscape of soldiers coming back from war, and that’s what I think the music is like. SH: I love the casting of Matthias Schoenaerts as a sensitive thug. Did you have him in mind when you were writing? AW: I had seen Bullhead [2011] and I was amazed by his performance. I wrote for him because I knew he had this animality. I wanted to work with him with these borderline states - you needed to see in his eyes that he was coming back from another world, that he was not there any more, so he was not sleeping on the shoot - only two hours a night. He got very close to his own demons. There’s this sequence when the two main characters are watching TV together and I was always saying to Diane that this was the sex scene. Of course they’re not having sex but there is this Matthias Schoenaerts in Disorder intimacy - the world is falling apart around them and they are sharing this little moment together. I really wanted the last shot of the film to be in this no man’s land. I like this idea of paranoia in love. He’s always expecting danger behind him but at the end it’s love that is coming up behind him. SH: How did Mustang, which you co-wrote with Deniz Gamze Ergiiven, come about? AW: We went to the same school. La Femis, but we really met in Cannes. We were both selected for LAtelier [a workshop that puts young filmmakers in touch with industry professionals] and we were the two women and the ten others were men. Deniz said something really funny about this - when we met it was like we were coming out of the same spaceship. I can only write with people I feel this immediate connection with. The idea of rebelling against a patriarchal society was a theme I could recognise from my first feature. I wanted to describe men looking at women as both the object of desire and the object of fear. It’s grounded in the reality of today’s Turkey but also we thought about it as a fairytale. It’s also about liberating yourself from your own family. SH: Is it important to direct your own writing? AW: Yeah, it’s important. I was inspired by the idea of directing an action film. There should be no boundaries for women directors now. We can direct any type of film. SH: There shouldn’t be boundaries for female directors, but there are. What are the biggest challenges you’ve faced? AW: It surprised me that people in Cannes were surprised that a woman could express violence. People were always telling me that I was like the French Kathryn Bigelow - 1 really like her work, but sometimes I feel I’m more different from her than from a male director. I don’t want my film to be looked at only because it’s a female thing. I didn’t want to make a female thriller - 1 just wanted to make a story that’s important to me. © © Disorder is released in the UK on 25 Februaiy and is reviewed on page 74 April 2016 I Sight&Sound 1 11 RUSHES GUILTY PLEASURES There’s nothing like bunking off to go and sit in an empty cinema on a Tuesday afternoon to rejuvenate your love for film By Mark Cousins I usually plan what I’m going to say in this column, but this time I haven’t Instead, I’m going to start with the following situation and see where it leads me: last Tuesday afternoon, I saw TheHatejulEightm an Odeon in Edinburgh, and I was the only one in the cinema. I’d walked 3.8 miles, from my flat to an Odeon in a retail park near where the great filmmaker Bill Douglas was bom. Tarantino’s film feels like a long, wide display, and yet only I witnessed it. It was like being alone on a mountain top. I loved the experience. The film itself had its great pleasures (and some pains), but how I saw it made it special. My expectation built as I walked from busy central Edinburgh, through housing estates and the green belt. As the trailers ran, and I realised that as yet no one else had shown up, I got excited. It was such an ordinary Eebruary day, people were shopping or working, and I’d bunked off to see something extended, extravagant, visual and almost sadistic in its demand that I submit to its impositions. You could psychoanalyse this experience. I’m sure, but I would sum up my pleasure as Tuesday afternoon-ness’. As the lights went down, I realised that it was the collision between this ordinary day and this luminous cinerama that I was about to see that I liked so much. Maybe collision’s the wrong word: let’s say the ‘dissolve’ between Tuesday aftemoon-ness and Tarantino-ness. Recently I tried to describe how colour works best in film when it’s a world shift (‘Elying colours’, S&S, Eebruary), and that’s what happened to me last Tuesday. I’m not exactly talking about escapism here, because I’m lucky enough to have a good life, so it’s not one that I have the desire to escape. It’s more like feeling the world change around you, as it does in the revolving kiss in Hitchcock’s Vertigo (1958), as it does in Ovid’s Metamorphoses. The key phrase is ‘around you’, I think. I never get excited when I watch a film at home, on my TV; even less so on my computer. Such viewings are embedded in my ordinary life, of course, so should pass the Tuesday afternoon-ness test. But they aren’t a world shift. And - confession time - 1 don’t always get the feeling at film festivals these days. I’m spoilt, of course. I’ve run many film festivals and attended many more, mostly as a director. And I passionately believe that film festivals are necessary because the market fails to bring us the variety of films that are being made. They are, to grab a phrase from Paul Schrader, the spice of life not the meat and potatoes. So why am I raising doubts about them? The simple answer is that, in almost all cases, when I go to a film festival now. I’m working, and Tuesday aftemoon-ness is about not working. Also, there are the crowds. I know that part of the creed of film-going is the pleasure of seeing a movie, especially a comedy, with others - the collective laughter or thrill -but I think Maybe my best way to see a film is to have lots of nothing before it and more nothing after it, as fit’s an oasis in the desert I value being away from the numbers a lot, again because everyday life is so busy. My The Hatefal Eight QxpQrimcQ has made me think that maybe my best way to see a film is to have lots of nothing before it and more nothing after it (see my heretical verdict on Q&As, ‘Not so grand inquisitors’, S&S, December 2013), as if it’s an oasis in the desert. When you’re a filmmaker, film festivals are frenzied kingdoms of the lanyard. Is there one, somewhere, that’s more like a desert? Trappist, Bressonian or deadpan days interrupted by explosions of cinema, of life? Eilm festivals always aim to be Dionysian, but could a few of them be Apollonian? I know this sounds jaded or misanthropic, two things which I ain’t. I love films more than ever, I sit closer to the screen than ever, I cry at them more than ever. Life toughens you up, it’s said. Your skin gets thicker, your armour more robust as you batter through. But something like the opposite happens. Battering tenderises many people, like it tenderises beef. And so you become more sensitised to Tuesday afternoon-ness, and Tarantino-ness. You’re more attuned to their frequencies, so background noise interferes. It’s a roar. Eilm festivals are a roar. And, to contradict myself, I love roars. I love sensory overload, dancing to loud music, the sea on a stormy night, the madness of Mad Max: Eury Road, the fury of the trafficky ordinary street on which I live. But backgrounds assert. David Lynch has a way of scoring the visual noise of a room. If it has big patterned wallpaper or is full of people, or has a fire with big flames, or is very cluttered, he’ll give it an eight or nine. It’s his way of saying how much more a room can take, or how calm you feel within it. Such scoring is useful, I think. Tuesday is a one, Tarantino is a nine. Add them together and you get... © 12 I Sight&Sound | April 2016 RETURNING TO CINEMAS IN A NEW 4K RESTORATION “A FILM BORN OF RARE GREATNESS- IMPOSSIBLE TO EORGET” ★★★★★ “KUROSAWA’S LAST GREAT FILM... MAGNIFICENT” ★★★★★ ★★★★★ Philip Kemp, Total Film ★★★★★ Time Out Little White Lies a film by AKIRA KUROSAWA OFFICIAL SELECTION CANNES CLASSICS FESTIVAL DE CANNES IN CINEMAS APRIL 1 ON BLU-RAY & DVD MAY 2nd I PRE-ORDER NOW The Industry BUSINESS NEWS & OPINION DEVELOPMENT TALE COURT Trial run: Vira Sathidar as Marathi folk-singer Narayan Kamble in Court For Chaitanya Tamhane, getting his debut feature Court made was a trial - but he’s been vindicated by festival juries and the box office By Charles Gant The Mumbai-born director Chaitanya Tamhane received early encouragement when his 2011 debut short Six Strands wdiS selected for international film festivals, including Rotterdam and Edinburgh. But he soon discovered that making the next step was not so easy It took the generous intervention of a friend to set him on a path that would lead to international acclaim for his feature Court, which was India’s submission for the Foreign Language category in this year’s Oscars. “I was completely broke,” Tamhane explains. “I had no money to survive. And that’s when I started getting a lot of pressure from my family. I hadn’t moved out of my parents’ house, and they were really worried for me. I didn’t want to assist anybody, even in a film-related scenario, if it meant I wouldn’t get to do my own work.” He did, however, have the germ of an idea. “I was watching this American TV show called The Defenders, something like that. We see these very dramatic portrayals on TV, with these slick lawyers. I randomly started wondering what it must be like to attend a case in a lower court in Mumbai. I did just that, and I was utterly fascinated. It was nothing like anything I’d seen, even in Indian films and TV shows. It was completely chaotic. It was theatre of a very different kind.” Tamhane had met actor Vivek Comber when he directed him in a play in Mumbai called Grey Elephants inDenmark Now, in 2011, the pair met again, and Comber immediately sensed something was wrong. “I’m in a bit of trouble right now,” Tamhane told him, “because it’s time when I have to step up and find a real job.” Instead, Comber agreed to fund his friend (“I needed a little less than $ 300 a month to survive”), with no strings attached, so he could develop his screenplay idea. Tamhane spent the next year visiting the court, interviewing lawyers and judges, reading books about the judiciary. He knew that he wanted to give texture to the characters of his defender, prosecutor and judge, presenting their lives outside the courtroom, but had yet to find a story hook. Then he became interested in local activists and protest singers who were using the Marathi-language folk music of Maharashtra state as a form of dissent. He also read about the condition of the sewer workers, who are principally drawn from India’s lowest social strata. “There is absolutely no attention paid to their health and safety. A lot of them work on a contract basis, so the municipal corporation is not liable if they die.” Suddenly Tamhane had his story: a privileged lawyer who is also an outsider (played by Comber) defending a Marathi folk-singer accused in a Mumbai lower court of inciting the suicide of a sewer worker. When the script was finally ready, Tamhane and Comber, serving also as producer, took the project to the National Film Development Corporation of India for funding, but were turned down. “Then we tried going to NFDC Bazaar, which is for international co-productions, and that didn’t work out,” Tamhane says. “We had no contacts in the industry, we didn’t know anybody. It wasn’t like we could approach nine different people. It is difficult to get funding for these kind of films.” Comber then committed to financing the film himself. Apart from Comber and theatre actress Ceetanjali Kulkarni, as his courtroom adversary, Tamhane cast non-professionals in every role. “Bollywood has a very strong influence on the acting style and the way people work here, so I wanted to move away from that,” Tamhane says. “I knew I would have to cast real faces of 14 I Sight&Sound | April 2016 Mumbai for the city to come alive.” Led by a casting director with a theatre background, a 1 2-person team sourced actors by going to railway company amateur theatre groups, schools and banks, and handing out fliers at tea stalls across Mumbai. “The criterion was that these people should be interested in acting, but they shouldn’t be actors. Actors are not welcome. The cast is very diverse, so it needed a very diverse approach. It was like a social project.” Meanwhile an initial hope that Court could be shot on the fly for $ 2 50,000 proved unrealistic. “We realised this film actually requires complete control. It’s a difficult film to execute because it’s real locations, which in Mumbai are very chaotic. You need to get permissions from four different agencies. And it will require a lot of junior artists [ie extras], and we are doing synch sound, which also means controlling the environment. And because these will be non-professional actors saying scripted lines, and such long, uninterrupted takes, we can only shoot one scene a day. And then for the courtroom, we were not happy with any of the options, so we built a set from scratch.” Shooting required maximum patience. “We would do 30, 35 takes, going up to 65 takes. If one thing goes wrong, you have to start all over again. The edit process was more of a hunting adventure for us: finding just the right take with the right in and the right out that fits in rhythmically and does justice to the character and When we were close to release, we had won 17 international awards, and nobody cared. It doesn’t mean anything the entire scene. You have your fingers crossed, because there’s just no escape. Most of the scenes except for the courtroom scenes have no cuts.” CourtwdiS accepted into the 2014 Venice Film Festival, winning two major prizes, and thereafter cut a swathe through the international festival circuit - but distribution in India remained a challenge. “The definition of arthouse in India is very different,” Tamhane explains. “For an Indian audience. The Lunchboxwould be very arthouse. We don’t have arthouse screens. When we were close to release, we had won r 7 international awards by then, and nobody cared. It doesn’t mean anything.” Salvation came when, three weeks before the planned self-distributed release last spring. Court unexpectedly won Best Feature Film at India’s National Film Awards. “It’s like the Indian Oscars,” says Tamhane. “You get the award from the president of the country. So that suddenly became a very big deal.” Cowrf opened in 1 50 cinemas, a mix of major cities and venues in the state of Maharashtra where it could ride the local ‘Marathi pride’ wave, achieving 100,000 admissions. Home entertainment, however, is a whole other story. “People don’t trust websites with their credit cards here,” Tamhane says. “Piracy is very normal. It’s a tough battle to fight.” © © Court is released in UK cinemas on 25 March and is reviewed on page 62 THE NUMBERS YOUTH/A BIGGER SPLASH By Charles Gant With cinema audiences for foreign-language films declining in English-speaking markets, it’s probably no coincidence that many European filmmakers are working with international casts. Last year’s Cannes saw instances of that with Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Lobster, Matteo Garrone’s Tale of Tales and Paolo Sorrentino’s Ybutfi.This last, starring Michael Caine, Harvey Keitel and Rachel Weisz, arrived in UK cinemas courtesy of StudioCanal exactly two weeks ahead of the same distributor’s A Bigger Splash - directed by Luca Guadagnino and starring Tilda Swinton, Ralph Fiennes, Matthias Schoenaerts and Dakota Johnson. English-language doesn’t necessarily mean more box office: Sorrentino’s This Must Be the Place (2011), starring Sean Penn, remains one of his lowest-grossing films in the UK, while Guadagnino’s London-set debut The Protagonists (1999) was not released here. For StudioCanal, according to distribution boss John Trafford-Owen, language wasn’t a specific factor in the acquisition of either Youth or A Bigger Splash, and “It didn’t matter where the director was from.” That said, the film’s casts were pluses in both instances, and Italian dialogue would have necessitated some different choices, notwithstanding Swinton’s achievements with Italian in Guadagnino’s I Am Love (2009). In the case of Youth, StudioCanal had a strong relationship with co-producer Number 9 Films (Stephen Woolley, Liz Karlsen), and the film’s likely appeal to an older audience offered an identifiable target. With A Bigger Splash, which StudioCanal itself co-produced, the overall package of script, director and cast was strong. The distributor released both titles in the pre-Bafta corridor, thus making them eligible for awards consideration, but no nominations resulted. The consequence was a highly competitive environment, especially for Youth, which landed in busy Going swimmingly: A Bigger Splash late January, but there were also upsides. “I’m not saying that Sir Michael wouldn’t have supported the film otherwise,” Trafford-Owen says, “but it does give people a focus.” As for A Bigger Splash, which landed in UK cinemas just two days before the Baftas ceremony, many of the awards titles were by then beginning to fade. “The Revenant had taken £20 million,” says Trafford-Owen. “It was still doing well, but there was definitely a gap for an upmarket arthouse film, and this was it.” At press time. Youth had grossed £794,000 and looked set to fall short of The Great Beauty's £1 million haul - although Trafford-Owen says it has “good run-on capability with the older audience, with weekday matinees”. A Bigger Splash earned £748,000 in its first ten days, and will easily sail past I Am Love’s £927,000. Meanwhile, StudioCanal is not about to vacate the foreign-language space, having released both The Assassin and A War in January, with Jacques Audiard’s Dheepan to follow in April. “It’s very important as a company that we keep a mix of films, from Paddington to A Girl Walks Home Alone at Nigfit,” Trafford-Owen says. “More and more tentpole titles find their way into the independent chains, and then there are also live events in cinemas. It doesn’t get any easier, but it Just means we have to be smarter, identify the films that can perform to the highest level, and back them accordingly.” © ITALIAN DIRECTORS AT THE UK BOX OFFICE Film Year Gross Life Is Beautiful 1999 £3,083,174 Cinema Paradise 1990 £1,512,905* The Great Beauty 2013 £1,000,997 Gomorrah 2008 £944,551 1 Am Love 2010 £926,655 Youth 2016 £793,557+ A Bigger Splash 2016 £748,428+ The Leopard (rereleases) 2003/2010 £452,514 The Consequences of Love 2005 £450,581 Mediterraneo 1993 £384,153 ^Includes subsequent rereleases; ^grosses at 22 February April 2016 I Sight&Sound 1 15 Festivals BERLINALE TELLING TALES New horizons: Mia Hansen-Love’s Things to Come, stars Isabelle Huppert as a woman coming to terms with the changes taking place in the world around her Story was king at Berlin this year, a festival whose finest films eschewed stylistic innovation in favour of novelistic ambition By Jonathan Romney When you compile a festival overview, you hope that you can pin down a story, however slender or artificial - a narrative thread to knit together a whole spread of disparate films. This year, I can’t help thinking that the story in the Berlinale was story itself. Even someone like me, who instinctively recoils at the film industry tenet that “it’s got to be about story”, had to admit that this year’s festival was exceptionally rich in films that grappled with the fundamentals of telling tales. That doesn’t mean there was a huge amount of stylistic innovation involved: some of the best films felt very rooted in tradition, but managed to say something about the contemporary experience in a specific idiosyncratic way. Two of the best Competition films were the work of a pair of French writer-directors who have always felt like cinematic novelists in the best sense, insofar as they habitually explore the interlinked fortunes of complex characters who don’t reveal all their secrets easily, but emerge gradually, sometimes obscurely, just as people do in the real world. Andre Techine’s Being 17, co-written with Girlhood director Cdine Sciamma, is perhaps not his most involving exercise in this mode, but it’s powerful and beautifully worked through. It’s about the simmering hostility, then rapport between two teenage boys (Kacey Mottet Klein and Corentin Fila - both superb), which unfolds against an imposing Pyrenean backdrop. Even better was Mia Hansen-E0ve ’s Things to Come. Having established herself as a leading young voice in French cinema, she follows her club-culture frieze Eden (2014) with a film about an older person at once looking back and forward, balancing her past idealism against the uncertain values of a new generation. Isabelle Huppert is Nathalie, a philosophy teacher and editor who sees the world changing around her. Kurosawa Kiyoshi’s Creepy With a troubled mother to attend to (the sublime Edith Scob) and a husband (a terrific Andre Marcon) with a bombshell to drop, Nathalie visits the radical commune of an ex-student. It’s all delivered in a loose narrative package that’s full of witty digressions, although it’s more tightly structured than Eden. Huppert gives one of her best, certainly most relaxed, recent performances in a film which, in its modest but controlled way, does something truly radical - puts an intellectual middle-aged woman centre-stage and lets her fly. Two genre treats. Playing out of Competition was Creepy, Kurosawa Kiyoshi’s thriller about a cop and his very weird neighbour. Kurosawa praised the Master of Suspense in the documentary Hitchcock/Truffaut (201'^), and Creepy USQS his lessons to mischievous effect - although the film arguably runs into a brick wall when it gets into what you might call its Park Chan-wook hysterical phase. Then there was Competition feature Midnight Special by Jeff Nichols, one of the most dedicatedly no-nonsense yarn-spinners in US cinema. Some colleagues didn’t go for it, and I can see why: it starts in one genre (the gritty thriller mode of back roads and cheap motels) before dramatically and unexpectedly crashing the barrier into another (visionary science fiction). That dissonance may not play so easily these days, but Nichols is simply recovering some of the possibilities of what certain Spielberg and John Carpenter films did 16 I Sight&Sound | April 2016 Eight hours that shook the world: Lav Diaz’s revolutionary epic A Lullaby to the Sorrowful Mystery in the 80s, and doing it with fabulous audacity. And how often do you see a film in which the weirdest eyes on screen aren’t Michael Shannon’s? The Competition had its share, as ever, of solemn duds, of which Michael Grandage’s literary anecdote Genzhs was the most preposterous, and Denis Cote’s boutique melodrama Boris Without Beatrice (so pallid it should have been called Borscht Without Beetroot) the most glossily ponderous. But a stand-out for me was Letters from War, by Portuguese director Ivo M. Ferreira. It’s based on the correspondence of novelist Antonio Lobo Antunes, stationed as a military doctor in Angola in 1971, as Portugal attempts to maintain its grip on the colony. As he grows disillusioned with the colonial mission, we hear his letters to his wife, read in voiceover by Miguel Nunes, but more often by Margarida Afila-Nova - as if Maria-Jose is living through her husband’s experience at a distance. Meanwhile, the doctor’s African experience is reconstructed minutely in stark black and white, shot with breathtaking richness of texture by Joao Ribeiro. This is the most beautiful war film I’ve seen since The Thin Red Line, but it also feels coolly analytical, a worthy film to consider alongside Miguel Gomes’s more playful musing on Portugal’s African misadventure. Tabu (2012). It was also good to see the return of Rafi Pitts - the Iranian director of 2006’s It’s Winter - exploring new territory in Soy Nero, a modem Candide-style story about a young Mexican (Johnny Ortiz) trying to secure US residency, initially by focusing on not getting deported, then by enlisting in the US army: a real-world issue given a dream-like fabulist slant. Also striking was Tomasz Wasilewski’s United States of Love, the interlocking stories of four women in early 90s Poland, a perplexingly constructed jigsaw, shot by the celebrated Oleg Mutu in an icily bleached-out palette. And one to note from the Panorama section was All of a Sudden, the first German feature by Turkish director Asli Ozge. It’s about a young man whose privileged life starts showing cracks when a woman is found dead in his apartment. Ozge picks over familiar tropes in her dissection of small-town bourgeois self- interest, but it’s done with elegance and rigour. Now for a film less interested in story than in investigating the intricacies of the self- although technically it qualifies as a biopic. Terence Davies’s A Quiet Passion is about the life and travails of the poet Emily Dickinson. While you can’t imagine this director ever making a film not entirely suffused with his distinctive cultural and emotional sensibilities, this one gives you the Full Terry and then some - not least because it dares go so far in the direction of intensity and austerity. Its formal, sometimes theatrical register will require a leap of faith for many viewers, but what’s remarkable also is the lightness - especially when a quietly exuberant Dickinson exchanges crisp one-liners, halfway between Austen and Dorothy Parker, with her friend Miss Buffam (played by Catherine Bailey). Those scenes are like a scintillating scherzo offsetting the solemn and heart-wrenching movements that follow in this chamber symphony. Cynthia Nixon is magnetic as a mercurial, self-possessed Dickinson. The big event in Competition - the mountain you had to choose whether or not to scale - was Lav Diaz’s ‘A Lullaby to the Sorrowjul Mystery’ seems as much akin to Peter Brook’s epic theatre as to any cinema the eight-hour A Lullaby to the Sorrowful Mystery, the latest from world-class duration champ Lav Diaz. As a member of Meryl Streep’s Competition jury, this magazine’s editor was bound by omertd not to reveal how the judges planned their toilet breaks, but Lullaby was as demanding as you’d expect - and barring stretches where it slackened out, mesmerising.

All of a Sudden Asli Ozge r — A multi-strander set ostensibly during the Philippine Revolution of 1896-97 - although Diaz plays wonderfully fast and loose with visual and verbal anachronism - it involves a group of characters crossing paths in a forest, some of them historical figures, some borrowed from a 19th-century Philippine novel, and others supernatural, notably three half-horse beings who pull the narrative strings with the grace and malice of Shakespearean fairies. Every new Diaz film seems to retest the limits of filmic narrative, and while Lullaby isvit perhaps his most revelatory, its grappling with the complexities and legacies of history seems as much akin to Peter Brook’s epic theatre as to any cinema we normally see. And so to the deserving Golden Bear winner. Fire at Sea by documentary filmmaker Gianfranco Rosi. Here’s one film less interested in telling a story as such than in describing a state of affairs. It’s about the situation on the island of Lampedusa where, opening titles tell us, 400,000 migrants have arrived in the last 20 years, with a further 1 5,000 dying at sea. The film is partly a portrait of Lampedusa community - of a fishing family, of the DJ who plays traditional songs by request, and in particular of a nervy boy called Samuele, seen wreaking havoc on cacti with his hand-made catapult. Then there’s the local doctor, whose duties form the link between the community and the migrants, whose agonies become more tangible as the film goes on. We see rescue missions intercepting boats crammed with dehydrated, petrol-burned migrants, who come to huddle on shore in thermal foil capes; we hear an extraordinary sung-spoken litany in which a Nigerian man narrates flight via Libya (“The sea is not a road... Oh, but today we are alive”); we are shown dead bodies in the junk- strewn hold of a boat. There’s no doubt a debate to be had about the fact that the most direct testimony to the suffering is provided by the doctor who has witnessed it for so long C‘It leaves you with emptiness in your gut”), but Rosi, who shot the film himself, offers no commentary or coercive narrative structuring. This is a deeply troubling, yet surprisingly beautiful work that you can’t help but describe - hackneyed though the phrase is - as a wake-up call for a Europe increasingly deadened to compassion. © April 2016 | Sight&Sound 1 17 THINGS FALL APART In Ben Wheatley’s ‘High-Rise’, an adaptation ofJ.G. Ballard’s novel of societal collapse in a 70s tower block, Tom Hiddleston plays an ordinary man forced to take sides when class tensions lead to anarchy. Here the actor reflects on issues of role-playing and identity By Nick James Not for the first time in recent years, Tom Hiddleston seems to be everywhere. By the time you read this, you may have seen him as Jonathan Pine, the chameleon-like lead character in the John le Carre spy thriller The Night Manager, a six-part BBC television series directed by Su- sanne Bier. It’s only a few months since we saw him lead Mia Wasikowska into a mud-oozing gothic mansion in Guillermo del Toro’s Crimson Peak. Coming soon is his in- carnation of the great, haunted country singer-songwrit- er Hank Williams in I Saw the Light. But when 1 met him for lunch in a quiet backroom of Shoreditch House in the first week of the New Year, our principal topic was his central role in Ben Wheatley and Amy Jump’s bravura adaptation of J.G. Ballard’s High-Rise. Hiddleston was on a break from filming the King Kong reboot Kong: Skull Island. “I’m half-way through,” he told me. “Day 42 of 7 5, so I’ve been off officially for two weeks but you can’t let it all go, there’s an internal ten- sion, you can’t power down just yet.” 1 got to have lunch with him in part because we became friendly in 201 1 on the set on Terence Davies’s The Deep Blue Sea, and 1 met him again in 2013 when Sight & Sound presented Jim Jarmusch’s Onfy Lovers Left Alive, in which he plays Tilda Swinton’s vampire lover, at the BFl London Film Festival. 1 hadn’t seen him since then, and the one change 1 noticed when he arrived was that he’s acquired HOME TRUTHS Tom Hiddleston says he was drawn to his role as Dr Laing in High-Rise (right) as a result of his fascination with the discrepancy between the surface identity we present to the world and the inner vulnerability we all feel. ‘We all strive for consistency,’ he says, ‘but life isn’t consistent’ 18 I Sight&Sound | April 2016 April 2016 | SightSiSound 1 19 HIGH-RISE TOM HIDDLESTON In the war, Ballard wandered into a casino that had been bombed and in that moment he realised that reality was a stage set that could be dismantled at any time ANARCHY IN THE UK Hiddleston with Elisabeth Moss (above), who plays the ‘uncorrupted innocent’ Helen Wilder, a woman trying to avoid the chaos that is taking over the block of flats © serious biceps, as if he might himself wrestle with Kong’s thumb or wield Thor’s hammer. As the names above show, since 2007, when he made his feature debut in Joanna Hogg’s Unrelated, the actor has worked with an unusually impressive list of auteur directors - and 1 haven’t even mentioned Woody Allen, for whom he played E Scott Fitzgerald in Midnight in Paris (201 1). It’s this parallel career with some of the world’s best directing talent from someone who is perhaps best known for playing Loki with such outright glee in Thor (2011) and The Avengers (2012) that makes him of special interest. For me, his particular quality lies in part in his ability to show exterior charisma and internal angst at the same time. But that’s a simplification that doesn’t ac- count for his extraordinary, complex ability to constant- ly morph and yet be an everyman. High-Riseis, of course, one of J.G. Ballard’s most impor- tant novels. To adapt it has been a pet project of veteran producer Jeremy Thomas for decades, but previous ver- sions involving Nicolas Roeg and later Richard Stanley did not get off the ground. Only now, with Wheatley at the helm, has it come to fruition. The story of the production is told through interviews with the cast and crew starting on the opposite page, but the book’s basic premise concerns the opening of a huge modern- ist tower block in the 1970s, built by architect Anthony Royal (Jeremy Irons). Here the inhabitants are largely se- cluded from the outside world and live according to their social class, with the poorest members at the bottom of the building and the upper classes at the top. Tom Hid- dleston’s Dr Robert Laing moves into an apartment on the 2 5th floor (half-way up the social strata - Royal lives in the penthouse) and soon gets involved with Charlotte (Sienna Miller), an aide of Royal’s, and encounters docu- mentary filmmaker Richard Wilder (Luke Evans), who has been demoted to the second floor and seeks to agi- tate for social change in the building. The situation in the building degenerates by degrees from apparent propriety to chaos and violence. Nick James: Tell me about your High-Rise character. Tom Hiddleston: 1 became a student of Ballard for about three months. 1 met Ben Wheatley when he came to see me on stage in Coriolanus. He’d already asked me to play Dr Laing, but it had also come through Jeremy Thomas - we had our relationship from Onfy Lovers Left Alive [which Thomas produced] and we liked each other enormously. They both came to the first preview, which had its own terrors - the first time you perform any play there’s an insane amount of adrenalin. Then Ben and 1 had lunch - this is December 201 3 - and 1 knew that they planned to make it in the summer, but 1 was the first actor to attach to the project. It meant that 1 had a much longer period than everyone else to prepare. 1 went to To- ronto to work with Guillermo del Toro on Crimson Peak, but 1 would email [screenwriter] Amy Jump and we’d talk about the adaptation, the book and the script, and 1 asked Ben to send me films. What 1 always do is try to paste the inside of my brain with images and music and films and books and give myself a sense of the tone of what we’re making. 1 need to build an imaginative framework within which 1 can then swing freely. Ben asked me to watch [Bernardo Bertolucci’s 1970 film] The Conformist. Somehow if that trickled down into what 1 was doing that would be useful. He sent me a lot of German prog- rock and Amy sent me books on psychological theory from the 60s and 70s. NJ: You read R.D. Laing? TH: 1 did. Most people think Ballard probably didn’t base the character on the real Laing, but the fact that he called him that is still interesting. Laing was in the Zeitgeist of progressive philosophical thought at the time Ballard wrote the book. 1 also read a lot of Ballard, including 20 I Sight&Sound | April 2016 ‘A PROPHETIC FUTUROLOGIST’ It took producer Jeremp Thomas 40 pears to bring ‘High-Rise’ to the screen. Below, from the set in Northern Ireland, kep members of the team discuss their role in bringing J.G. Ballard’s apocalpptic vision to life By Neil McGlone Ben Wheatley (director): I was looking along my bookshelf and I saw High-Rise. I’d read it when I was a student and really liked it. It was one of the cornerstone books for me, along with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Naked Lunch and On the Road. I’d been involved in a film called Vbu’re Dead... [1999], which was influenced by High- Rise. You’re Dead... is about a bank heist that goes wrong and they all stay in the building and cannibalise each other. Ballard was definitely in the front of the mind for that. I thought, “No one’s done High-Rise; why haven’t they done it? It’s weird.” Jeremy Thomas (producer): My son, who is a director’s agent and works with a colleague of Ben Wheatley’s agent, rang me up and said that Ben was interested in High-Rise and had discovered that I had the book rights. So I met with Ben and saw that he’s a natural. BW: I was over at Jeremy’s within four days. He’d actually seen Sightseers [2012] a week before. If I’d gone to see him a month before, he’d have gone: “Who the fuck’s this?” JT: Often on film projects you have an eye-opening moment, whether it’s a change of heart or, “Oh well, I was thinking of this when in fact that’s a better idea.” We had to adapt it in the period. I had been working on this project for so long that looking at the 70s from the beginning of the 2000s was a different tack, but it certainly clicked, yes. BW: [Setting it in the past] was the first thing we wanted to do with it. The book is so 70s that it suffers once you start to adapt it into the future. It doesn’t make sense anymore and the politics of it start to dissolve. JT: If you talk about class in the last few years there’s been more of a conflict between the middle classes and the super-rich. There wasn’t so much of that in the 70s, but Ballard was already thinking of it. He was very much a prophetic futurologist and he was thinking about the gated community with special living areas for rich people. BW: I went to see Tom Hiddleston on stage in Corioianus, which was terrifying because I was watching it thinking, “I’m going to have to talk about this with him. It’s going to be like an A-level.” But it was great and then we had a lunch and he’s so sharp. Dr Laing is a tricky role and he’s got to literally be balls out emotionally. He has to go there physically. We needed a partner who would do that with us. It’s a big responsibility and a lot to study to understand the context of the role. It’s not Just something you can rock up and do. He’s like a precision tool. When he’s focused he’s on it, like a laserbeam. Laurie Rose (cinematographer): There was a decision across the board to do the 70s with the very lightest touch in terms of design, costume, hair, make-up etc. We shot on new digital cameras, but I did use lenses made in the 60s and 70s. Nick Gillespie (camera operator): Ben wanted a specific look that would not only resemble the 1970s but also suit the camera story. Having the option of some soft lenses with lots of little imperfections in them was key to this. Following what we’d learned from A Fieid In England [2013], we developed more lenses for High- Rise. We also experimented with old-school video cameras, and literally manipulated smoke and mirrors to get specific shots. We tested all these weird lenses built out of bits of old magnifying glasses and mouldable polymer solutions, until we had a whole set of High-Rise macros [close- up settings], each for a different set-up: actors’ eyes, skin, fingerprints, concrete. 1970s kitchen appliances, insects, animals and water were all things we could look at. BW: For me and [screenwriter] Amy Jump it was the idea that the children of the tower become us, or me anyway. As a 40-odd year-old man. I’m one of the kids that run around in the tower. We didn’t want it to look like the greatest hits of the 70s, but we did want it to feel alien. The 70s were the last time there was a chance of Miracles of Life, his autobiography, which I found fasci- nating. I reread Concrete Island, High-Rise, Crash and lots of interviews with him. The most fascinating aspect was seeing Laing in High-Rise in the context of Ballard’s own life and work. Let me unpack it for you. Laing is a single bachelor, a physiologist, someone with a professional detach- ment about the machinery of the human body, electro- chemical signals to the brain. His job is to disassemble the machine parts of how our anatomy fits together and be detached about it. He moves into the high-rise to get away from the Dickensian gloom of the city, to escape real life. At the beginning of the novel he’s recovering from a recent divorce and is persuaded to buy an apart- ment in the building by his sister. In the film, Laing is re- covering from his sister’s suicide. What appeals to him is that the flat represents his 2,000th share of the cliff-face, a piece of the sky in which he can hide. He’s a grey man in a grey suit who can paint his apartment grey and fit in. He doesn’t want to cause problems, he just wants his well-appointed slot halfway up. 1 read a couple of things into all of that. It fascinated me that Ballard had a British upbringing in Shanghai that was not actually a British upbringing at all but a sort of colonial imagining of what being British meant. As a child he had a more vivid experience of Shanghai than most. There’s all the random violence he saw when the Japanese invaded and he was put in the internment camp. In a paragraph in Miracles of Life, he describes wan- dering into a casino that had been bombed and deserted, and he says that, in that moment, seeing those ornate candelabra smashed on the gambling tables and these beautiful gauze felt chairs on the floor, with everything covered in dust, he realised that reality as a construct was a stage set that could be dismantled at any time. Later, when he comes to Britain in the early 50s, he doesn’t recognise the place he was educated to believe in. It’s drab, it’s depressing, people are still on rationing, it’s dreary, brown and not epic. Thereafter he always felt like an outsider. He went to Cambridge to read medicine and stayed there for the first couple of years, which is ba- sically a study in anatomy, and then gave it up because that was all he wanted to know. So it’s no accident that Laing is a physiologist. The book is a kind of exploration in stripping away the mask of civilisation and seeing the darker impulses and urges beneath. NJ: What made Laing attractive as a character to you? TH: I’m fascinated by the discrepancy between the con- struction of identity as presented on the surface and the interior vulnerability and turbulence that we all feel. Identity is often a mask concealing less predictable, less conformist feelings and instincts. We all strive for con- sistency, but life isn’t consistent. As a role, Laing was a specific challenge because he’s detached, yet when life in the building begins spiralling out of control he has to make a stand and come down on one side of the line or the other, even though professionally he would say it’s just neurons firing in the brain. Ben and 1 talked about the veneer of elegant sophistication and control versus a much more chaotic and out-of-control interior life. NJ: The film begins with a fiash-forward of Laing after that interior iife has let rip. TH: It’s true to the book. The first line of Ballard’s High-Rise is, “Later, as he sat on his balcony eating April 2016 | Sight&Sound | 21 HIGH-RISE TOM HIDDLESTON I know the film is provocative, challenging and rebellious and it’s dividing people already, but the provocation and the challenge is there in the material Ballard knew what he was doing THE ROYAL FAMILY Jeremy Irons as Anthony Royal, the architect who designed the tower block in High-Rise, with his wife Ann, played by Keeley Hawes O the dog, Dr Robert Laing reflected on the unusual events that had taken place within this huge apartment building during the previous three months.” That shot was Ben’s way of honouring that great opening line, one of the best in fiction. One really interesting conversation 1 had with Amy on email was about a central chapter in the book, when Laing, after a long night of surviving - there have been beatings in the corridor, with rape and theft on a grand scale - he looks in the mirror and sees his own image. There’s mud and dirt and shit on his clothes, and his face is covered with sweat and grime, and he hasn’t slept - he’s got bloodshot eyes - and he looks at his watch and he’s got to go to work. So he puts on a crisp white shirt, a new suit and picks up his briefcase and walks outside, and, in Ballard’s words, the air was filled “with knives”. The air is too clean and the light is too bright and it precipitates a kind of mild nervous breakdown where, as he tries to get to his car, he can only get as far as an unfilled concrete ornamental lake in the middle of the square and he starts to feel the walls of the lake rising up above him as if he’s going to be consumed. It instigates such deep terror in him that he runs back, goes all the way up to the 2 5th floor, rips off his suit and puts on his sweaty clothes that he’s been wearing all night and feels a profound sense of relief. A new truth about himself has begun to emerge. He’s reassured by the odour of his clothes. He no longer believes in the construct of whoever Dr Laing is outside. NJ: The reviews from the Toronto Film Festival were very divided: some raves, some put-downs. Has this film got a particularity to it? TH: 1 know it’s provocative, challenging and rebellious and it’s dividing people already, but the provocation and the challenge is there in the material. Ballard knew what he was doing. He’s challenging people’s prejudices and their capacity to handle life. There’s no redemption at the end of High-Rise, no neat closure, but Ben’s been really faithful to the book while putting his own stamp on it. NJ: Given that class is at the centre of this film and seems again to be a burgeoning political and cultural concern, I wonder what your line is on what you have in common with a number of successful British actors at the moment, that you share a certain privileged background? TH: It’s a delicate line to tread because 1 never want to contribute to any conversation that becomes divisive or prejudicial in any direction. N J: But you do seem to go out of your way in some of your choices of roles to avoid the posh stereotype. TH: 1 became an actor to prove I’m not that stereotype. Those labels that are easily attached to people are so superficial. But there’s a lot of that about. There’s justified and correct concern about equality of opportunity. The arts, and every other profession, should not be exclusive to one social grouping. 1 don’t identify with the divisive conversation, but 1 can see why Ben cast me as Laing. N J: But how does the perception of you change when, say, you’re cast as Hank Williams in / Saw the Light TH: When 1 was cast, a lot of people were up in arms on that forum of diplomacy and democracy called the in- ternet. People were very concerned about a British actor playing an American icon. 1 saw that as irrelevant. If you’re an actor it’s your job to commit to playing all kinds of characters. 1 understand casting to type, but ‘type’ is much more fluid and mutable than we give people credit for. We all contain multitudes, it’s just the actor’s profes- sion to play upon that. If you’re a good enough actor, with enough commitment and compassion and craft, you can create a character that people believe. 1 wanted to do I Saw the Light for a couple of reasons. To make a film about music was very inspiring. Within Mark Abraham’s screenplay there were two narratives: one about the nature of performance. Hank Williams’s 22 I Sight&Sound | April 2016 O modernity. As far as I’m concerned histoty kind of stops in 1990 and there are no more eras. I wanted to take those bits of the futuristic 70s and the kitsch stuff and make an alternate version of it. That was the dream. You want to see the building as quick as possible and feel the scope of it and get it out of the way. You feel the thrusting modernity of it. It’s like these people are fucking and they come out and they go to work and they drive off in their Triumph Stags and they stomp about. They’re kind of proto-yuppies. Luke Evans (playing Richard Wilder): Wilder is the agitator, the one who brings up the questions, and as much as he’s slightly crazy, he has moments of pure clarity, which is an interesting thing to play. He has an animalistic feeling about him. He’s passionate and driven. We had to start at the end of the film, where he just gets more deranged, crazy and bloodied. We had to shoot those end scenes in the first week. It’s very difficult because you have to have an idea of what level ten is, so that you can then start backtracking and work out what level you should be in a given scene. You’re constantly referring back to shots that are already done so that you know you can give it some sort of Journey. Elisabeth Moss (playing Helen Wilder): In a way she’s the Virgin Mary of the building. She has been very put upon for quite a few years and when eveiything in the building starts to hit the fan, so to speak, she sinks into this deep lonely depression, bunkers in and tries to avoid the whole situation. In my eyes, she’s the uncorrupted innocent. It doesn’t mean that she doesn’t also go a little bit mad, but she’s not guilty. Mark Tildesley (production designer): We had to get Jeremy Irons [playing architect Anthony Royal] in and out in two weeks. So we had to destroy the swimming pool to start with. We filled it with car bits and tyres and black oil. We built a tank and sank him into it. He’s buried in the dark water. It’s a very beautiful shot. We’re shooting in the formerly glorious Bangor Castle Leisure Centre, something Ben found with Jeremy. Half of it was built in 1973 and our stoiy is in 1975, so it’s perfect. We needed a squash court, a swimming pool and a gymnasium. There were pieces here already and it provided a big space for us to build our sets. We have two bases - one here, and one at the Stena ferry link in Belfast, where we built the foyer and penthouse. We have a penthouse lift, which was quite fun - completely glass, mirrored only. Initially we tried not to be too on the money in terms of the 70s because it ends up looking like a commercial. Inevitably, the film does go insane towards the end. So we sort of had to pace it a bit and try to pull things back and make it feel slightly like there’s some sense of normality, so the impression of the way society breaks down in the flats is more powerful. BW: It’s the first time I’ve ever worked with a lot of sets, which was really exciting. It was amazing when we found the leisure centre because it had just been closed. It’s next to a police station so it never got damaged. Then we found a supermarket and all of a sudden it was all smiling on us. Then we had Stena, the big empty ferry terminal, so it gave us two massive spaces. I just found the scale of it fantastic to work in. 0 Doctor in the house: a frame from Ben Wheatley’s storyboard for High-Rise showing Dr Laing relationship with his public persona, where he was always expected to be available. And another about his private life, where he was a very different man. He was loved for being mischievous and rock and roll, but he also had a tormented private life. Mark’s suggestion is that the heartbreak, pain and sadness that captured so many peo- ple’s hearts in the music came from a very honest place. If an artform is authentic, people can smell it, people can root it out, they know it’s coming, they know it’s truthful. There was something in there 1 could relate to. 1 wasn’t born in Alabama in 1923, 1 haven’t got spina bifida, and during the course of playing Hank Williams 1 discovered I’m not an alcoholic - 1 don’t have that gene, happily. The circumstances of his upbringing were completely unlike mine, but 1 understood him and 1 really related to him. 1 related to being on stage and feeling that unique energy of the connection between the performer and an audience and also the professional requirement to de- liver even when you’re in a dark place. 1 also felt a bizarre responsibility to commit to his truth. The rest of it was just graft and practice and changing the way 1 looked and sounded, the way 1 played the guitar, sang and spoke and not stopping until it became second nature. My family has often asked me the same question: “Why do you have to go so far afield, to be so hard on yourself?” It’s to do with trying to prove that I’m not who you think 1 am. If, as you say, class is an issue that’s coming back, the thing 1 feel most passionate about is inequality. Difference is necessary. There’s that Groove Armada song that goes, ‘If everybody looked the same, we’d get tired of looking at each other’. We should cel- ebrate our diversity in every facet, but there should be more equality of opportunity. NJ: To come back to High-Rise, given that it’s a period piece, how do its politics reflect today’s situation? TH: During the last general election, 1 was in Morocco doing The Night Manager and 1 stayed up all night watch- ing the results come in. 1 found the intensity of the debate across the country fascinating. It relates to High- J?zse because there was a huge amount of justified anger about inequality. 1 found that passion reassuring. High-Rise is about the rebellion of breaking out from whichever floor you’re positioned on in the building. Wilder, in a career-defining performance by Luke Evans, is obsessed with going higher up. On one level that’s an admirable ambition, but you also have to take into ac- count the astonishing cruelty he shows in abandoning his wife and children. You could argue that architect An- thony Royal’s optimistic vision was for everyone to be happy, but it’s all come down like a house of cards. There’s a debate happening now about the position of Labour in the political spectrum and what Jeremy Corbyn is doing - and everyone has an opinion about that and about the overwhelming Conservative majority and what that means for who we are at this point. The terrify- ing spectre of UKIP and Nigel Farage seems thankfully to have fallen away, but the same idiocy is rearing its head in America as we near the election. The expression of these terrifying opinions, the intensely debated dialogue, with so much anger from both parties, the jostling of people trying to win the argument as to which side gets to define the status quo, Hz^/z-Rzse speaks to all of that. © O High-Rise is released in UK cinemas on 18 March and is reviewed on page 64 April 2016 | Sight&Sound | 23 BALLARD ON FILM MAVERICK TO MAINSTREAM J.G. Ballard’s work was always laden with cinematic influences, but his own impact on film culture took rather longer to be felt, emerging gradually from the margins of the avant garde By Roger Luckhurst From his first stories in the 1950s, J.G. Ballard’s science fiction was saturated in cinema. The stories about Vermilion Sands, a decadent, end-times desert resort of artists and chancers, flit with characters straight out of Fellini or Antonioni. There’s also a touch of Bonjour Tristesse (1958) about it, though - dirty old David Niven on the Riviera - and this is typical of Ballard’s film taste. The high was always mixed with the low; he borrowed from everyone and anyone, the channels always open. Ballard had remained a marginal maverick for much of his career, regarded as a somewhat hopeless obsessive. His autobiographical novel Empire of the Sun (1984) changed all that, and Steven Spielberg’s adaptation in 1987 gave Ballard a further boost. He always remained steadfastly loyal to his adaptors, even Spielberg, who perhaps symbolically cut Ballard’s cameo in the crowd from the cinema version. Empire of the Sun seemed to explain Ballard’s compulsions and repetitions in a graspable frame of war-trauma, a psyche constructed from his time interned in a prisoner-of-war camp in Shanghai. After this book, rather weirdly, Ballard risked approaching the status of national treasure. Ballard’s early writing for the pulp magazines stood out for their refusal of expansive American science fiction or space opera (Robert Heinlein was the presiding god of all that at the time. Starship Troopers coming out in 1959). Instead, Ballard offered a precise, intensive prose focused on what he called “inner space”. The first film adaptation of one of his stories. Thirteen to Centaurus’ (1965) for the Out of the UnknownTV series, turned the attention of its astronauts from stellar distances to the interior landscape of madness. His stories and early novels were often set in a heightened present, alienated and tilted towards entropic exhaustion. He was not interested in the future, he always said, but the next five minutes. In the early 1960s, the new young editor of New W&r/ds magazine, Michael Moorcock, declared Ballard “the voice” of New Wave science fiction. The term was borrowed, of course, from that rebellious War child: Steven Spielberg’s adaptation of Empire of the Sun (1984) brought Ballard to wider attention generation of French writers and filmmakers then becoming international stars. When Ballard wrote strident manifestos in New Worlds, he denounced both realism and science fiction and pointed instead to Chris Marker’s La Jetee^igSi), a post-apocalyptic time-travel narrative teased out from stills of hyper-modem Paris. There is a continuum between Ballard’s fiction about urban sprawl Jonathan Weiss’s The Atrocity Exhibition (2000) and catastrophe with Godard’s Alphaville (1965) or WeekendiigGj), or the science- fictional tones of Alain Resnais’s early work or Marker’s provoking cine-essays. Ballard was also clearly influenced by the further reaches of the avant garde: he hung out with William Burroughs when the latter was in London and toying with film-splicing (as in the mesmeric The Cut- Ups from 1966). Ballard also borrowed a still from Steve Dwoskin’s Alone (ig 6 f), the masturbating woman featuring in one of Ballard’s strange anti-advert collages that he published in underground journals. Ballard admired Dwoskin’s The Bathroom (1968), and § was evidently delighted his girlfriend Claire | was being pursued as Dwoskin’ s next naked 5 female star. The multimedia Arts Lab world | in Camden was Ballard’s milieu in the late | 1960s; it was where he staged his exhibition | of crashed cars. But typically, he also lavishly | praised Mondo Cane (19 6 2), that delirious « collage of tasteless, depraved found and | mockumentary footage. Ballard watched I 24 I Sight&Sound | April 2016 it over and over, he said, and it fed into The Atrocity Exhibition, his most provocative experimental work, written between 1966-70. This collection of ‘condensed novels’, featuring the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Vietnam horrors, Marilyn Monroe and the violent death of James Dean, was an echo chamber of the 1960s, a traumatised reflection on our emergent condition of media saturation. ‘Why 1 Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan’ recognised the arrival of a new kind of vacuous media politician. His American publisher famously pulped the first edition there, appalled by the obscenity and worried about libel. Sections of it were involved in prosecutions under the Obscene Publications Act in England. It is uncanny how closely Ballard’s obsessions match the experimental work of Bruce Conner, whose key films of the time. Report (igGy) and Marilyn Times Five (1973), tinkered with images of Kennedy’s assassination and Monroe’s body. Conner compulsively edited and re-edited versions of these pieces for years on end. Celebrity, of sources, including Ballard drives around the Westway and environs in a bulky American car, while Gabrielle Drake (sister of singer-songwriter Nick) explores the erotic conjunction of sex and technology. This was evidently part of Ballard’s researches into the car crash - and came two years before the novel Crash, in which he made the bold decision to name the narrator ‘James Ballard’. What an avant-gardist! Yet, just to trip you Ballard’s stories were often set in a heightened present He was not interested in the future, he said, but the next five minutes up, in 1970 Ballard got his one and only screenwriting credit, for his treatment for Val Guest’s When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth His name appeared on screen as ‘J.B. Ballard’. The 1 970s is the era of lost or vanished Ballard projects on film. The producer Jeremy Thomas finally got to make Ballard’s High- Rise with Ben Wheatley 40 years after the book was published, but in the late 1970s there had been an attempt to shoot the book with Nicolas Roeg. Roeg’s fractured editing, anxious male protagonists and fascination with perverse sexuality always make him seem very Ballardian, at least at his peak in the 70s. It would have been a fascinating prospect. The novelist and filmmaker Chris Petit was also operating in a similar psychic terrain as Ballard. Radio On (1979) is an echo-box of sources, including Ballard, and Petit eventually made a short film directly about Ballard in 1990. It is sometimes known under the suggestive title. The Unmade Films ofJ.G. Ballard Petit filmed Ballard again as part of the subverted documentary, London Orbital (2002), one of his Tuned in: Chris Petit’s Radio On (1979) is an echo-box death and the ceaseless circulation and reproduction of images - this was also the aesthetic of Andy Warhol’s Factory films from the same period. I’m not sure Ballard could have seen Conner’s films, which emerged from the San Francisco found-footage movement, but the parallels are instructive. The maverick filmmaker Jonathan Weiss did eventually make a feature-length film of The Atrocity Exhibition (2000) using the same dense overlay of found footage and archly staged, indigestible dialogues lifted directly from the text. Like the obsessives that fill the book, Weiss had worked on this project for years in almost complete isolation from the film industry - and indeed from film itself, the traditions of which he openly disdained in his rebarbative interviews. His Atrocity Exhibition thus felt oddly out of time, unwilling to engage with the history of avant- garde cinema. As it fell between the cracks, Weiss continued to rail against all-comers for failing to appreciate his masterpiece. Long before this, in 1971, Ballard appeared as himself in Harley Cokeliss’s short film version of a chapter of The Atrocity Exhibition, called Crash!. Ballard looks brooding as he Out of the Unknown episode Thirteen to Centaurus’ April 2016 | Sight&Sound | 25 BALLARD ON FILM O collaborations with the writer lain Sinclair. 1 am always rather amused at Ballard’s steadfast resistance to the Sinclair shtick of lost, vanished or fugitive London writers and fictions. Ballard’s West London is full of dual carriageways, shopping malls and suburban tracts of housing. He celebrates these anonymous spaces, while Sinclair digs into the histories of specific places, conjuring ghosts. In his BFl Film Classic on the various versions of Crash, Sinclair evidently admires Ballard, but can’t quite see beyond the loud shirts and resolutely populist tastes of the man. He won’t conform to Sinclair’s model of the London writer. Of course, the greatest Ballardian of the 70s was the Canadian outsider David Cronenberg. The paradox of Cronenberg’s career is that he is at his most Ballardian in his early films, and least so by the time of his one direct Ballard adaptation. Crash, in 1996. Shivers, which came out almost simultaneously with High-Rise in 1975, is pure Ballard: hyper- modern spaces of research institutes and apartment complexes, where uncontrollable sexual urges are directed by slithery parasites. Ballard’s most enduring insight was the exploration of the violent psychopathology produced by the empty spaces of modernity itself - no longer the madness of the gothic past but the hubris of the modernist attempt to erase that primal past. Cronenberg got this Ballardian insight right, from Crimes of the Future (ig-/o) to Scanners (ig 8 i). Cronenberg’s Crashwas obligingly condemned as “pornography” by Evening Standard critic Alexander Walker, who railed against “some of the most perverted acts and theories of sexual deviance 1 have ever seen propagated in mainline cinema”, and the film soon ended up a target of right-wing populism when the Conservative home secretary suggested local councils ban the film. Ballard was plainly delighted, and was typically loyal to Cronenberg. He beamed next to the director at Cannes, at home in the brash Riviera where he set his late novels Cocaine Nights (1996) and Super-Cannes {2000). But there is a suffocating tastefulness to the adaptation that chokes any sense of transgression from the film. The stars who lined up to appear in this ‘shocker’ are far too beautifully lit and composed to ever capture the stench of semen and engine coolant that suffuses the novel. After 2000, a number of short adaptations have popped up around the world - a Portuguese version of the short story ‘Low- Flying Aircraft’, an American rendering of ‘Minus One’ a very good 30-minute TV drama, based on ‘The Enormous Room’ - with Antony Sher vanishing into the infinitely expanding spaces of his suburban home. Ballard continues to inspire artists too.
