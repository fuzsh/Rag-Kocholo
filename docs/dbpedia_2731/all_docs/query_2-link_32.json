        "text": "PARIS - Atom Egoyan's \"Adoration\" will compete next month at this year's streamlined Cannes Film Festival, as will Clint Eastwood's \"Changeling\" and Wim Wenders' \"Palermo Shooting.\"\n\n\"Adoration,\" starring Toronto actors Scott Speedman and Rachel Blanchard, is about a young man obsessed with the idea that he is the spawn of two historical figures and is Egoyan's first feature length film since \"Where The Truth Lies,\" which also screened at Cannes.\n\nEastwood and Steven Soderbergh will headline the competition at this year's pared down version of Cannes, which features fewer big-name directors and more emerging voices from across the globe, organizers said Wednesday.\n\nEastwood will show \"Changeling,\" a mystery set in 1920s Los Angeles and starring Angelina Jolie as the mother of a kidnapped child. Soderbergh, the director of the lighthearted series that began with \"Ocean's Eleven,\" gets serious with his four-hour-long marathon, \"Che,\" about Argentine revolutionary Ernesto Guevara.\n\nOrganizers did not say which films would open and close the festival, which runs May 14-25. Organizers said they would announce the movies that snag the coveted slots later.\n\nHarrison Ford dons his khakis in the latest instalment of Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones series, which will be screened out of competition. \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" also stars Australian actress Cate Blanchett.\n\nWoody Allen's Spanish-set \"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\" will play in the same category, as will Serbian director Emir Kusturica's \"Maradona,\" a documentary about Argentine soccer legend Diego Maradona. Kusturica has won the Palme d'Or, Cannes' top prize, twice, in 1985 and 1995.\n\nOrganizers said the 61st edition of the French Riviera festival will mark a shift in the spirit of the event, known for its mix of Hollywood blockbusters and small art-house films.\n\nThey said they had pared down the offerings in the main competition from 22 last year to 20 this year and nixed some of the sideline events to put the spotlight back on cinema.\n\nThis year, smaller productions by lesser-known directors appear to have the upper hand over blockbusters. Organizers explained that many of the festival's favourite star directors - like Britain's Stephen Frears (\"The Queen\") and Spain's Pedro Almodovar (\"Volver\") -- are currently working on new movies.\n\nThe main competition lineup includes movies by art-house directors from Belgium, Turkey, France, Argentina, Brazil and Italy. Eight of the directors have never appeared in Cannes' main competition before.\n\nBrazilian director Walter Salles (\"The Motorcycle Diaries\") is showing \"Linha de Passe,\" the story of brothers trying to scrape their way out of poverty. Argentina's Lucrecia Martel makes her debut at Cannes with \"La Mujer Sin Cabeza\" (The Woman without a Head), which explores the psychology of a woman disturbed after she hits and kills a dog with her car.\n\nWenders, who won the Palme d'Or for his melancholic 1984 movie \"Paris, Texas,\" will screen \"The Palermo Shooting,\" a drama with a multilingual, multinational cast.\n\nAmerican screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (\"Adaptation\") makes his directorial debut with \"Synechdoche, New York,\" starring Philip Seymour Hoffman.\n\nSean Penn, the American actor-director, leads the jury, which also includes actress Natalie Portman. The Palme d'Or and other awards will be announced May 25.\n\nThough festival regular Quentin Tarantino (\"Pulp Fiction\") is not presenting a new movie, the 1994 Palme d'Or laureate will give a master class on moviemaking to students and film buffs."
