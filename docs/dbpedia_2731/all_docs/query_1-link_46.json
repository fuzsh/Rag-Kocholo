        "text": "October 25 – saturday\n\n25 OCT. 10.00 – Culturgest (small auditorium)\n\nLisbon Docs – Public Pitching Session II\n\n(10h00/14h30)\n\n25 OCT. 14.30 – Culturgest (large auditorium) | 20 OCT. 17.30 - Londres (room 1)\n\nThe Tailor (El Sastre) CI\n\nÓscar Perez\n\n30´ Spain 2007\n\nIn the Raval neighbourhood of Barcelona, Mohamed, a Pakistani tailor, and Singh, is Indian employee, work together. Mohamed is a temperamental man who is only interested in business and religion. The confrontation between his values and the ones of his clients couldn’t be funnier.\n\nAll White in Barking CI\n\nMarc Isaacs\n\n73´ UK 2007\n\n“You are what you eat,” the saying goes. In the London district of Barking, an area that has some of the highest levels of immigration, not everyone eats the same. “I don't like their food”, the butcher says, “because I'm not used to it.” An elderly couple doesn't like the cooking smells wafting in from their Nigerian neighbours… But when invited for dinner at their houses, they quietly clean their plates. A film about immigration and racism in contemporary England.\n\n25 OCT. 15.00 - Londres (room 1) | 21 OCT. 22.45 – Culturgest (small auditorium)\n\nGallivant DF\n\nAndrew Kötting\n\n100´ United Kingdom 1996\n\nA film where director Andrew Kötting reunites his 85 year old grandmother, Gladys, with his 7 year old daughter, Eden, two human beings on the verge of fragility: one limited by her age, the other suffering from Joubert’s syndrome (with learning and expression difficulties and few hopes of living through adulthood), in a intense journey through the British coastline. A trip that shows not only a world of adventures and episodes, but also a deep glance over the various symptoms of British society in the 1990’s.\n\n25 OCT. 15.30 – São Jorge (room 2) | 19 OCT. 15.30 – São Jorge (room 2) | 18 OCT. 15.30 – São Jorge (room 2)\n\nDocs 4 Kids\n\nThe Red Race\n\nChao Gan\n\n70´Germany/China 2008\n\n- Special workshop for children at the São Jorge Cinema Theatre\n\nFollowing every day of a group of Chinese children from impoverished rural provinces that have the dream of becoming gold medalists, The Red Race shows us the physical and emotional aspects of competition at his highest level. After the media and sports hegemony revealed by the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, we take an insight on the other side of success.\n\nAge: from 8 to 12 years old\n\nCoordinator: Maria Remédio; limited registrations\n\nInformation and registration:\n\n+351 96 327 12 55 mail: escolas@doclisboa.org\n\n25 OCT. 16.00 - Londres (room 2) | 18 OCT. 21.30 - Museu do Oriente | 24 OCT. 14.30 – Culturgest (large auditorium)\n\nCrime and Punishment (Zui Yu Fa) MC\n\nZhao Liang De\n\n123´ China/France 2007\n\nFilmed in the border regions between North Korea and China, Crime and Punishment follows the daily life of young Chinese guards based at a police station. In this place, we meet several characters, from petty thieves to people who need social and economic assistance. We also observe the competition for promotion that is developed between the young recruits as the end of the year approaches and the officers are due to retire.\n\n25 OCT. 16.15 – Culturgest (small auditorium) | 17 OCT. 21.30 - Museu do Oriente | 22 OCT. 16.00 - Londres (room 2)\n\nThe Last Lumberjacks MC\n\nYu Guangyi\n\n90´ China 2006\n\nThe portrait of the lives of a group of loggers in the Heilongjiang Province of China, facing harsh weather conditions during their work in the old woodcut industry. Documenting a mode of production that is disappearing due to civilization’s progress, The Last Lumberjacks depicts how forests have been exploited for a living over more than a century in this region, using ancient techniques from one generation to another.\n\n25 OCT. 16.30 – Culturgest (large auditorium) | 18 OCT. 23.00 - Londres (room 2)\n\nHunger R&E\n\nSteve McQueen\n\n92´ United Kingdom 2008\n\nThe first long feature film by British artist Steve McQueen examines Bobby Sand’s last months of life, an IRA activist that decided to protest 27 years ago against the conditions of prisoners in Northern Ireland’s Maze prison. This movie is an account of the 1981 hunger strike that Sands lead at the time as a protest for special category status for republican prisoners. This political gesture made him a symbol of the Republican army’s fight, particularly after his death. In Hunger there is no simplistic notion of “hero” or “martyr”, both being questioned and evaluated.\n\n25 OCT. 17.30 - Londres (room 1) | 23 OCT. 16.30 – Culturgest (large auditorium)\n\nI Would Love To Share Spring Time With Someone\n\n(J’aimerais Partager le Printemps avec Quelqu’u) R&E\n\nJoseph Morder\n\n85´France 2008\n\nThe Festival Pocket Films challenged French director Joseph Morder to make a movie diary with the camera of a cell phone. For three months, he filmed several personal events, somewhere between his own narrative and juvenile fascination for a new way of filming and a private and intimate insight to his quotidian. Not only considered as an exceptional film in France, J’aimerais Partager le Printemps avec Quelqu’un was also the first long feature film made with a cell phone that got a wide distribution in French movie theatres.\n\n25 OCT. 18.15 - Londres (room 2) | 20 OCT. 18.30 – Culturgest (large auditorium)\n\nSinai Field Mission RW\n\nFrederick Wiseman\n\n127´ USA 1978\n\nThe routine activities of the American assignees who work on the U.S. Sinai Field Mission, the early warning system established in 1976 to help facilitate the disengagement between Egypt and Israel after the 1973 war. The film focuses on surveillance operations and strategic passes of the Mission in all of the Egyptian and Israeli surveillance station, as well as their relationship with UN soldiers and the quotidian of the 163 American soldiers that were sent to the Sinai Desert. A military world obsessively focused on war – a fact that becomes a crying irony during the ordinary moments where nothing warlike happens.\n\n25 OCT. 18.15 – Culturgest (small auditorium) | 24 OCT. 21.00 - Londres (room 2)\n\nUn Voyage au Portugal DF\n\nPierre Primetens\n\n13´ France 2001\n\nPierre’s mother died when he was five years old. His father never spoke to him about her. At 26 years old, he discovers his mother’s Portuguese family...\n\nMemories of a Tropical Jew\n\n(Mémoires d’un Juif Tropical) DF\n\nJoseph Morder\n\n80´ France 1988\n\nA mixed exercise of self-reflection and a personal chronicle where director Joseph Morder recalls his youth in Guayaquil, Ecuador, where his Jewish parents settled after they left Poland. In a movie with no scenes from Ecuador, the heat of August in Paris brings memories to the filmmaker, in a time where he’s involved in a love affair. Morder also builds a small piece of “fictions” with little details while still making an intimate journal of his quotidian.\n\n25 OCT. 18.30 – Culturgest (large auditorium)\n\nGravura SE\n\nJorge Silva Melo\n\n80´ Portugal 2008\n\nThis documentary is about Gravura, the Portuguese engraver cooperative that was established in 1956 by a group of artists. Through almost three-dozen statements from some of the participants in the cooperative, the film depicts their history, its consequences and their origin among the opposition movements during the Portuguese dictatorship in an improvised garage. A unique time for friendship and learning in a political era of artistic forms.\n\n25 OCT. 20.30 - Londres (room 1) | 19 OCT. 14.30 – Culturgest (large auditorium)\n\nA Tale of the Wind (Une Histoire du Vent) DF\n\nJoris Ivens and Marceline Loridan\n\n80´ France 1988\n\nJoris Iven’s last film, directed with Marceline Lorrigan. After Pour Le Mistral (1966), Ivens tries once again to capture the “invisible”: the wind. Going back to China, Une Histoire du Vent pursues this element not only as natural phenomenon, but also as an illustration and metaphor for the changes in Society and Culture. A film where the poetic farewell of an author finds a feeling of hope in the vast landscapes of Gobi’s desert and in the reflection on the importance of art and culture.\n\n25 OCT. 21.00 - Londres (room 2) | 20 OCT. 18.30 – Culturgest (small auditorium)\n\nThe way of a warrior I\n\nAndreas Pichler\n\n88´ Germany/Italy/Switzerland 2008\n\nThe story of Michael Notdurfer, a young German missionary who abandoned Europe at 20 years of age to travel to Bolivia and played, at 29, a decisive role in the guerrilla group National Liberation Front. What is there in common between the catholic ideals and the armed movements who fight for social justice?\n\n25 OCT. 21.30 – Culturgest (large auditorium)\n\nSESSÃO DE ENCERRAMENTO\n\nCLOSING SESSION\n\n– awards ceremony and film projection Maradona by Kusturika\n\nEmir Kusturica\n\n90´ Spain/France 2008\n\nIn this film, Emir Kusturica celebrates the incredible story of Diego Maradona: sports hero, living God of football, brilliant artist, champion of the people, fallen idol and an inspiration to millions throughout the world. From Buenos Aires to Naples – as well as Cuba – Emir Kusturica traces the life of this extraordinary man, from his humble beginnings to his worldwide fame, from the most spectacular rise to the tragic fall. A unique documentary about “the player of the century”, filmed by his greatest fan.\n\n25 OCT. 21.30 – São Jorge (room 3) | 24 OCT. 24.00 – São Jorge (room 1)\n\nDisobedience (Desobediência) M\n\nLicínio Azevedo\n\n92´ Mozambique/Portugal 2002\n\nRosa, a Mozambican peasant woman, is accused of causing her husbands’ suicide and being possessed by a “husband-spirit” that made her disobey to her true husband. In the funeral, a letter is found and read in front of everyone: the suicidal determines that the five children he had with Rosa must be delivered to his twin brother and not allowed to live with the woman who ruined his life. To prove her innocence, she recovers her children and the few possessions the couple had, submitting herself to two trials: first a healer, then a court of justice. She’s found innocent in both, yet in order to keep a family’s secret hidden, she must be found guilty. The dead relatives then take revenge on her in an excruciating way.\n\n25 OCT. 21.30 - Museu do Oriente | 17 OCT. 16.30 – Culturgest (large auditorium) | 19 OCT. 16.00 - Londres (room 2)\n\nMum (Mama) MC\n\nde Zhang Yuan\n\n90´ China 1990\n\nZhang Yuan’s first feature film is also the first Chinese independent film since 1949, financed at the time with the support of some business friends and revealing the filmmaker’s appetite for controversial subjects in Chinese society. A movie which focuses on a mother’s relationship with her 11 year old handicapped son.\n\n25 OCT. 22.00 – São Jorge (room 1) | 23 OCT. 21.30 – São Jorge (room 3)\n\nNight Lodgers (Hóspedes da Noite) M\n\nLicínio de Azevedo\n\n53´ Mozambique 2007\n\nIn the colonial years, the Grande Hotel in the city of Beira was the largest in Mozambique: 350 rooms, luxurious suites, an Olympic-sized swimming pool… Currently, 3500 people inhabit the building, which is in ruins and has no electricity or running water. Some have been living there for twenty years. In addition to the rooms, the foyers, corridors, service areas and the basement of the hotel – where it’s always night time – also serve as residences.\n\n25 OCT. 22.30 - Londres (room 1) | 23 OCT. 21.00 – Culturgest (large auditorium)\n\nPlaying (Jogo de Cena) CE\n\nEduardo Coutinho\n\n105´ Brazil 2007\n\nAnswering to an advertisement in a newspaper, eighty-three women tell their life stories in a studio. In June 2006, twenty-three of them were selected and filmed at the Glauce Rocha Theater, in Rio de Janeiro. In September of that same year, professional actresses played the stories told by the chosen appliers. Their images cross: who’s the “real character”? Who’s the “actress”? What is, after all, representation?\n\n25 OCT. 23.00 – Londres (room 2) | 17 OCT. 22.30 - Londres (room 1)\n\nAka Ana R&E\n\nAntoine D’Agata\n\n60´ France 2008\n\nThe work of one of the most controversial and provocative photographers in France: Antoine d’Agata wrote a “documentary screenplay” inspired by Oshima’s Empire of the Senses (1976), then shot it in a four-month stay in Japan between September and December 2006. He himself is the principal character in this film, Aka Ana, which was shot on digital video. It is a private, autobiographical diary that explores the transgression, joy and violence of his nights in Japan, facing the ghost of pornography.\n\n25 OCT. 23.30 – São Jorge (room 3) | 16 OCT. 23.00 – São Jorge (room 1)\n\nThe Mistery of Samba\n\n(O Mistério do Samba) HB\n\nLula Buarque de Hollanda and Carolina Jabor\n\n88´ Brazil 2008\n\nPremiered in the last edition of Cannes Film Festival, this film is a fair and thrilling tribute of singer Marisa Monte to the traditional samba of Velha Guarda (Old School), a project that goes back to the year of 1998 when the artist started her research for the album Tudo Azul. Prepared with a tape recorder, the Brazilian artist is followed by the pair of directors Lula Buarque de Hollanda and Carolina Jabor around the streets of Oswaldo Cruz, a neighbourhood on the North of Rio de Janeiro, taking statements from the samba veterans who made the history of Portela, the dance school that has won more titles in the Carnaval of Rio de Janeiro than any other.\n\n25 OCT. 24.00 – São Jorge (room 1) | 22 OCT. 23.30 – São Jorge (room 3)\n\nA Televisão nos Bairros M\n\nMoira Forjaz, Licínio Azevedo & Miguel Arraes\n\n20´ Portugal/Mozambique 1980\n\nIn the early years of Mozambique’s Experimental Television, public “screenings” were made throughout several neighbourhoods. Usually, a small TV device was put in a huge sports centre so that the population could contact with this novelty. Moira Forjaz filmed one of these exhibitions and interviewed locals. Licínio Azevedo and Miguel Arraes edited the movies.\n\nTreatment for Traitors M\n\nde Ike Bertels (from filmed material by Ruy Guerra)\n\n53´ Netherlands 1983\n\n1982. The socialistic government of Mozambique – at that time a young independent country in southern Africa - organized a meeting of great political importance. President Samora Machel and his governments’ leaders held a session for a week with thousands of collaborators: people who betrayed their compatriots, sometimes even tortured them by order of Portugal at the time of its colonial domination of Mozambique. They are known as “the compromised”. They voluntarily joined the ANP fascist party or became agents of the secret police PIDE, or even soldiers in the colonial army."
