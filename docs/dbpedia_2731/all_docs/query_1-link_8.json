        "text": "Given his God-like status in his native Argentina, his legendary play on the soccer field, and an arguably equally highlight filled life off the pitch, it’s remarkable there hasn’t been a biopic about Diego Maradona yet. There’s hasn’t even been a decent, comprehensive documentary (don’t even bring up \"Maradona By Kustrica,\" Emir Kusturica‘s filmsy hangout video that he called a movie). But that’s all about to change from a director who has been behind some of the most acclaimed docs in recent years.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Amy’ Director Asif Kapadia To Helm Martin Scorsese-Produced Rolls Royce Drama ‘Silver Ghost’\n\n\"Senna\" and \"Amy\" director Asif Kapadia will helm \"Maradona.\" Production is already underway on this one, which has access to Maradona’s personal archive of videos, which promises to help paint the portrait Maradona deserves. Even if you’re not familiar with soccer, his story is fascinating, a literal rags to riches tale that also has shades of controversy (\"Hand of God\") and drug abuse, but genuine, unbelievable sports talent. Maradona’s story is incredible, and that it’s in the hands of Kapadia is exciting stuff."
