        "text": "Thinking further about the construction and representation of national identities along with the implications of casting, I draw upon the acclaimed film, from Mexico’s Golden Age of Cinema, María Candelaria (Xochimilco) (1943, dir. Emilio Fernández) for its problematic depiction and “whitening” of indigenous bodies. María Candelaria was the first Mexican film to be screened at the Cannes Film Festival in 1946, where it won the Grand Prize of the Festival for director Emilio Fernández. The film is considered to be a classic of Latin American cinema and the first one to break through language and culture barriers to win at Cannes. Director Emilio Fernández stands as a national icon for Mexican film and is “intensely nationalistic and overly sympathetic to the Indian whose culture has been under relentless attack from the mestizo and creole sectors of Mexican society” (Mora 57-8). Fernández is tied to a nationalist project in that his “oeuvre is popularly perceived within Mexican culture as forming ‘the Mexicanist cinemematic text,’ as an unproblematic extension of cultural nationalism, consolidating national identity through indigenism education and the fatherland” (Tierney 33). Viewing the film through this lens of the cultural and national project of representing “Mexicanness” complicates traditional readings of the film by suggesting the conflict inherent in the casting of the actress Dolores del Río as María Candelaria and the representations of Mexicanness through its fraught depictions of indigenous culture.\n\nThe protagonist, María Candelaria (Dolores del Río), an indigenous woman, lives in a shack by the river’s edge and is ostracized by the town. It is not clear why Maria is disliked but the film alludes that she is deemed immoral, despite her pious and virtuous lifestyle, because of the “sins” of her deceased mother who is implied to have been a “loose” woman. In this way, Maria is immediately presented at the Other and stands for a larger representation of the fraught relationship between indigenous peoples and the mestizo communities. The conflict of the film centers on the town’s mestizo overlord, Don Damián (Migual Inclán) whom Maria refuses to sleep with to pay off a debt she owes him. Coming to her aid is an affluent, European artist who is on a quest to discover absolute beauty, which he finds in Maria through her “pure” indigenous features. This “male-as-savior” role that the artist occupies, in combination with his European origins, presents a conquest scenario that mirrors the narrative of La Malinche. María Candelaria agrees to pose for the artist however, after refusing to pose nude, Maria abruptly departs, leaving the portrait unfinished with only her face completed. The artist substitutes another body (an unnamed women who poses nude) to complete the portrait. This transfer and replacement of the female body raises larger questions for commodification of women within the film. When the portrait is completed, seemingly featuring Maria in the nude, the town riots against Maria to punish her for her moral deviance resulting in Maria being stoned to death. Once again, it is through the colonization and subsequent “de-flowering” by the European savior that causes her demise.\n\nWhat is most interesting about the film is its casting of Dolores del Rio, who was initially a Mexican film actress who became a star of Hollywood films during the silent era, as the body of an indigenous woman and serving as a marker of “authentic” Mexicanness. Her lighter skin tone, which is what allowed for her crossing into the Hollywood cinema, serves to create an apparent visual contrast to the darker tones of the other actors in the film who represent the mestizo community. The effect is a “whitening” of the indigenous body and the featuring of that body as an example of “pure beauty.” Combined with the soft-focus, high-key lighting, and framing of the cinematography, Del Rio is depicted as an angelic, fragile icon of indigenous culture along with the association with whiteness and moral superiority. The influence of Hollywood cinema’s depiction of Otherness also serves a role in the creation of this Mexican nationalist film in that del Rio’s performance,\n\nconsists of a number of stock “Mexican peasant” traits as seen in the western: heavy-accented misuses of English/Spanish, stooping, cowering and exaggerated submissiveness around “white” or mestizo characters. (Tierney 85)\n\nDespite these complexities in the representation of indigenous bodies, the film has been revered for its “authentic” depiction of Mexican indigenous culture. I find it problematic that the film is considered to be Fernández’ most famous indigenist film and is cited to be a realistic depiction of the indigenous when it actually serves to undermine these efforts. María Candelaria serves to reinforce generic constructions of Mexicanness resulting in a romanticization of national identity. Do the plays we have read featuring indigenous bodies work to combat this representation of “authentic” and “pure” Mexicanness?\n\nWorks Cited\n\nMaría Candelaria (Xochimilco). Dir. Emilio Fernández.
