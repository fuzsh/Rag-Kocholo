        "text": "In Review: imagineNATIVE Film + Media Arts Festivsal 2010\n\nimagineNATIVE film + media arts festival had an impressive line up of films this year. Here is my recap of the films I was able to screen.\n\nBoy\n\nNew Zealand\n\nDirector: Taika Watiti\n\nSynopsis: The year is 1984 at the height of “Thriller”-mania in the beautiful Waihau Bay on the east coast of New Zealand. Eleven-year-old Boy spends his days idolizing Michael Jackson, talking to a goat, and taking care of his strange little brother Rocky (who has magical powers) and a band of deserted cousins. Boy’s other hero is his absent father, Alamein. But when Alamein suddenly arrives back in town, Boy is forced to reconcile his imagined idol with the reality of who his father is – a childish wannabe gangster just released from prison. This heartwarming and funny coming-of-age story finds hope in the pain of the disillusionment through the optimism and whimsical imaginings of a young boy.\n\nMy thoughts: Really enjoyed watching the children (Boy, Rocky and gang); to me, they steal the spotlight. Boy is certainly a coming-of-age film but from a different perspective, which I like. Waititi does a great job of incorporating Boy’s Michael Jackson fantasies and his wish his father, Alamein, would fulfill them. But alas! Alamein has a lot of growing up to do. I like the honesty in the story but also its sense of humour. Great homage to Michael Jackson’s music videos from the 1980’s. All in all, a very charming film.\n\nReinprinsessen (Reindeer Princess)\n\nNorwayDirector: Nils John Porsanger\n\nSynopsis: Ena II is the fastest reindeer in the world. Anne Risten is the lone female in the male-dominated sport of competitive reindeer racing. As a team, they are determined to be unbeatable. But as the racing season ramps up, both are met with unexpected challenges along the way.\n\nMy thoughts: An interesting look at a sport I had never heard of before. What makes this even more interesting is seeing Anne Risten and Enna II race. Anne Risten is quite determined to win and continue racing but her aging reindeer is not able to keep up. A nice introduction to the world of reindeer racing and the bond these animals form with those that train and care for them.\n\nColombia\n\nDirector: Cineminga Collective\n\nSynopsis: In this region of Colombia plagued by drug traffickers and paramilitary squads, Rober de Jesús Guachetá believed in the power of education. At 41 years old, Rober was a visionary. His goal was to build a community-based school where Human Rights and Sustainable Development would be taught alongside Family Planning. An advocate for the people, Rober was committed to exposing corruption within his community. But it was this undeniable crusade for truth that led to his brutal, cold-blooded murder. Intimate interviews and shocking archival footage breathe life into this powerful story of one man’s search for justice.\n\nMy thoughts: This film shows the dangerous realities indigenous people often face in an effort to maintain their traditions and teach them to the new generations. Unfortunately, this story is too common in such communities in Central and South America. Guachetá was one of many indigenous leaders who’s been killed in the past decade because they spoke openly about wanting changes in their communities. The locals want to and continue to have control of their education and keep their history alive. Thus, Guachetá’s death has not been in vain. A not-so-short film that I wish the authorities or “powers that be” would see in Colombia.\n\nMexico\n\nDirector: Carlos Efraín Pérez Rojas\n\nSynopsis: Since 2003, the Mexican government has been pushing to build the La Parota hydro-electric dam in Guerrero, which would flood several communities south of Acapulco, dislocating the Indigenous people who live there. As many campesinos rise up in opposition to the dam, tensions run high in the communities and violence escalates.\n\nMy thoughts: Another documentary from Latin America that shows us the struggle between small indigenous communities and the multinational corporations looking to make another buck. It was great to see some of the elder women talk about candidly about the problems such projects like La Parota bring to their communities. As one puts it, “where do the plan to relocate us?” The government just keeps lying about their intentions to help the locals. “The project has no benefits for us”, says another elder. “Los campesinos no queremos este proyecto.” What is even more tragic is that some of those protesting the hydro-electric dam are being killed; not unlike Guachetá was in Colombia. Of course, the representatives for La Parota project explain it as a benefit to the municipality and community as a whole. What I like about this film is that it shows how organized communities can have their say. It’s also great to see them speak about how they have been living off the land for many years and that they will keep living off this land. The opposition continues…\n\nAll of the films at this year’s festival had an interesting story to share. This is but a small sample of the many that played. Hope you got to see these and many others.

These women have too much to live for. Lumpectomies, mastectomies, chemotherapy, radiation, egg extraction, treatment schedules – who’s got the time?\n\nREAD MORE\n\nLATIN-AFRO-SOUTH ASIAN FESTIVAL BEGINS TONIGHT AT LULA LOUNGE\n\nLCCA, CANORAA & ROZINA KAZI PRESENT A CONTEMPORARY ARTS FESTIVAL\n\n“LATIN-AFRO-SOUTH ASIAN FESTIVAL”\n\nOctober 22, 2010 – LULA LOUNGE – Music, Dance and Video\n\nOctober 30, 2010 – TRANE STUDIO – Music and Dance\n\nNovember 5, 2010 – GLADSTONE HOTEL – Music and Dance\n\nIn case you didn’t know… “The Latin-Afro-South Asian Festival is a 3-day contemporary multi-disciplinary arts festival presented by the Latino Canadian Cultural Association, CANORAA and ROZINA KAZI that shows the fusion between the different cultures and roots of the Latin American, African and South Asian artists involved and the influence of the multicultural society where they work and reside.
