        "text": "Product Leadership\n\nLead and democratize compute with Intel x86 and XPU\n\nAs we transform beyond a PC-centric company to address the needs of the new data-centric world, we have expanded our product offerings to provide end-to-end solutions, scaling from edge computing to 5G network, cloud, and the emerging fields of AI and autonomous driving.\n\nIntel is at the forefront of developing new semiconductor technologies, products, and solutions as building blocks for an increasingly smart and connected world across a broad spectrum of markets.\n\nOpen Platforms\n\nStandards accelerate innovation\n\nAround the globe, companies are building their networks, systems, and solutions on open standards-based platforms such as Linux, Android, and others. Intel has helped set the stage for this movement, with our historic leadership in developing standards for the world’s companies to use.\n\nThese open platforms are constantly innovated by the world’s developers, expanding their capabilities while increasing their stability, reliability, and security. In addition, microservices have enabled the development of flexible, loosely coupled services connected via APIs to create end-to-end processes.\n\nIntel uses industry collaboration, co-engineering, and open-source contributions to accelerate software innovation. Optimized for Intel hardware, Intel software connects millions of developers to develop and evolve new technologies, solve critical problems, and create opportunity. We also deliver a steady stream of open-source code and optimizations for projects across virtually every platform and usage model.\n\nWe are committed to co-engineering and jointly designing, building, and validating new products with software industry leaders to accelerate mutual technology advancements and help new software and hardware work seamlessly together.\n\nManufacturing at Scale\n\nCreate world-changing technology and at-scale manufacturing with IDM 2.0\n\nWe have always been in the business of defying physics and building the future, and that’s not going to change. Intel is and will remain a leading developer of process technology and a major manufacturer of semiconductors. We are also a leading provider of silicon globally.\n\nTo meet the accelerating global demand for semiconductors and advance our IDM 2.0 strategy, we are expanding our manufacturing capacity, starting with approximately a $20 billion fab investment in Arizona and New Mexico, a more than $20 billion fab investment in Ohio, the acquisition of Tower Semiconductor, and plans to invest as much as 80 billion euros in the European Union over the next decade along the entire semiconductor value chain.\n\nIDM 2.0 is a differentiated and winning manufacturing strategy that’s only available to Intel. IDM 2.0 will give us the ability to design the best products and manufacture them in the best way possible, every time. It means leading in process, product, supply, and costs.\n\nDiscover your place in our​ world-changing work.\n\nAt Intel, we innovate, we inspire, and we lead by bringing people together from across the globe, united in pushing the boundaries of technology.\n\nTo us, those boundaries are opportunities.\n\nOpportunities to show what we’re capable of.\n\nOpportunities to develop life-altering breakthroughs.\n\nOpportunities for us to shine, to keep learning, and to further our careers.\n\nIt’s these opportunities that attract people like us. Because people like us believe our work can change the world.\n\nFrom the challenging and rewarding work, to the supportive benefits and programs, to the inclusive, welcoming environment, Intel is committed to helping every one of us learn, grow and thrive at work and beyond. Because that's how we solve the most complex problems to improve the lives of every single person on the planet.​\n\nThat’s what drives us.\n\nThat’s what sets us apart.\n\nThat’s what makes us Intel.\n\nLearn more"
