A UBI number is sometimes called a tax registration number, a business registration number, or a business license number. Use the Business License Application to apply for a UBI number.\n\n​\n\nWhen can I use my UBI number?\n\nAs soon as the UBI is issued, you may begin using it for business purposes.
