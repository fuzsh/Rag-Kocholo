        "text": "I am so proud to announce that Vista Unified continues to build upon our reputation of excellence and innovation. We began this year focusing on Finding Joy in our Flow. What we mean by this is that the systems we have built are not only focused on amplifying and elevating the achievement of all students, but also ensuring that our learning environments are deliberately designed to promote joy, a sense of belonging and connectedness to each other. Students, teachers, staff, and community partners spend a large part of their lives together, so it makes sense for us to carefully cultivate a sense of community that is joyful. What is most inspiring to me is that we, as a community, are truly creating joyful experiences for students. It is in this spirit that we share the The Power of Community Year In Review 2024 that highlights the many different examples of student success as a result of the dedication and love our teachers, staff, parents, and partners have invested to make Vista a joyful community. - Dr. Matt Doyle, Superintendent\n\nYear In Review 2024 booklets (English) (Spanish)"
