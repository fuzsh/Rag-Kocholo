        "text": "Employee giving and engagement campaigns\n\nEach year, we run three company-wide campaigns to give employees additional opportunities to give back to their communities and to each other.\n\nEmployee giving campaign: This campaign encourages employees to make charitable donations to a cause aligned with their passions.\n\nEmployee assistance fund: This primarily employee-funded program provides one-time grants to help employees facing unexpected hardships, as well as emergency grants to those who were displaced from their homes due to natural disasters or other catastrophes.\n\n#GiveTime campaign: We participate in the international movement called #GivingTuesday, a day focused on the spirit of giving. Our #GiveTime campaign encourages employees and customers alike to volunteer time and share their experiences on social media, encouraging others in turn to give back in their communities.\n\nOur business resource groups provide another avenue for employees to engage with the community and grow professionally.\n\nThis link takes you to an external website or app, which may have different privacy and security policies than U.S. Bank.
