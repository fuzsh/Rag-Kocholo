With a total population of over 310,000, Santa Ana is Orange County’s second largest city and serves as the county seat. The City comprises more than 60 distinct neighborhoods. The Santa Ana Unified School District is the local school district that serves the majority of our community. Additionally, there are six neighboring school districts that serve portions of the city, including Garden Grove, Tustin, Orange, Irvine, Newport-Mesa, and Huntington Beach Unified School Districts.\n\nHistory\n\nIncorporated in 1886, Santa Ana has established itself as Orange County’s government powerbase and is colloquially known as Downtown Orange County. Santa Ana's centralized location places the City less than 30 minutes from most Southern California destinations, including four airports. Its density and transportation infrastructure enable residents and employees to embrace a sustainable lifestyle by commuting to work via bus, train, bicycle, or on foot. This convenience attracts a diverse population that appreciates Santa Ana's distinctive housing choices, energetic nightlife, and cultural amenities like the Artist’s Village, Discovery Cube Orange County, Heritage Museum of Orange County, the Santa Ana Zoo at Prentice Park, and more. Santa Ana has a large and diverse business base, with over 30,000 businesses who employ over 150,000 people. Santa Ana is the corporate headquarters of several large companies, including Behr Paint and First American Financial Corporation. In 2016, Standard and Poor’s assigned the City of Santa Ana an AA issuer credit rating.\n\nDowntown\n\nSanta Ana is downtown for the world famous Orange County, California. It is the County Seat, the second-most populous city in Orange County, and is home to a vibrant evening scene and arts community. Over 1,400 City employees work hard every day to deliver efficient public services in partnership with our community to ensure public safety, a prosperous economic environment, opportunities for our youth, and a high quality of life for residents.
