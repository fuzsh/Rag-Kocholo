        "text": "Sacramento, CA - As uncomfortably difficult as it is to read, the report issued by the Sacramento County Grand Jury identified accurate shortcomings with regard to SCUSD’s past practices in special education. The notion that we are failing to provide appropriate educational services to our most vulnerable students and those with disabilities is unacceptable to every educator and administrator in Sacramento City Unified. The report is a sobering reminder that our students and families deserve better and we must do better by them.\n\nDear Sac City Unified Families,\n\nAs you are likely aware, according to the National Weather Service, temperatures over 100 degrees are expected Tuesday through Thursday this week in the afternoon and evening.\n\nPlease make sure you and your child(ren) stay well hydrated and use caution when exercising or spending time outdoors in the afternoon.\n\nSacramento, CA - This afternoon, the State Board of Education (SBE) approved Sacramento City Unified School District’s request for a waiver of the penalty for not providing the minimum number of instructional days and minutes during the 2021-2022 school year.\n\nApproval of the waiver means we will be adding eight (8) instructional days to the 2024-2025 calendar and moving the first day of school to Monday, August 19, 2024.\n\n5:00 p.m. Closed Session\n\n6:30 p.m. Open Session\n\nAgenda\n\nThe meeting agenda is posted the Friday before the meeting.\n\nWatch the Meeting\n\nCable Viewing\n\nThis meeting of the Sacramento City School Board is being videotaped in its entirety and will be cablecast without interruption on Metro Cable 14, the government affairs channel on the Comcast and SureWest Cable Systems."
