        "text": "Mission Statement:\n\nTo create and sustain an educational community where each child, respecting their exceptionalities, are: welcomed, valued, appropriately supported, made to feel safe, can equally participate, and expected and challenged to learn and achieve.\n\nSpecial Education Information and Resources\n\nWhat is Special Education?\n\nPer California Education Code 56031 (paraphrased):\n\nSpecial education means specially designed instruction to meet the unique needs of the student with a disability and may include speech-language pathology (SLP) &/or other related service. Individuals with special needs shall be grouped for instructional purposes according to their instructional needs.\n\nAcronyms List\n\nTop of Page\n\nWhat is Inclusion?\n\n“Inclusion is a way of thinking – a deeply held belief that all children, regardless of ability or disability, are valued members of the school and classroom community.”\n\n– Causton-Theoharis & Theoharis, 2008\n\nInclusive education is about developing and designing schools, classrooms, programs and activities so that all students learn and participate together. Inclusive schools are characterized by a sense of community, high standards, collaboration, cooperation and flexible staff roles and responsibilities.\n\nLegal support for inclusion is a cornerstone of the reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) which provides that children with disabilities are entitled to receive special education services and that children are placed, to the maximum extent appropriate, in classes with typically developing peers, also known as the least restrictive environment (LRE), in order for them to receive a free appropriate public education (FAPE).\n\nBenefits of Inclusion:\n\nFor Students with Special Needs\n\nEstablishes higher expectations for academic, social and vocational outcomes\n\nIncreases confidence and independence\n\nExpands range of friendships\n\nPromotes pro-social behaviors\n\nProvides greater integration into the community\n\nFor Educators\n\nInspires a collaborative team model and encourages innovative and creative instructional strategies\n\nModels acceptance of the full range of human experience\n\nEncourages self-reflection and expansion of teacher skill-sets\n\nFosters differentiated instruction benefiting all learners\n\nFor Peers, Families and the Community\n\nAdvances District-wide Welcoming Schools philosophy\n\nCultivates appreciation for students’ gifts instead of their challenges\n\nDemonstrates respect for diversity allowing all students to feel welcomed and celebrated for their unique qualities\n\nResearch-based support for inclusive education:\n\nTime spent engaged in the general education curriculum is strongly and positively correlated with math and reading achievement for students with disabilities (Cole, Waldron, & Majd., 2004; Cosier, Causton-Thoeharis & Theoharis, 2013)\n\nStudents without disabilities made significantly greater progress in reading and math when served in inclusive settings (Cole, et.al., 2004)\n\nStudents with autism in inclusive settings scored significantly higher on academic achievement tests when compared to students with autism in self-contained settings (Kurth & Mastergeorge, 2010)\n\nStudents with intellectual disabilities that were fully included in general education classrooms made more progress in literacy skills when compared to students served in special schools (Dessemontet, Bless, & Morin, 2012)\n\nPaths to Improving Education: Why Inclusion?\n\nTop of Page\n\nHistory of Inclusion in BUSD\n\nIn 1993 the District formed the Inclusive Education Taskforce to develop the implementation of inclusive education. In 1996 the task force became the Inclusive Education Advisory Committee.\n\nIn 2003 Dr. Kathleen Gee & Dr. Diane Ketelle conducted a comprehensive Special Education study.\n\nGee Ketelle Report\n\nThe findings and recommendations from this report were presented to the BUSD Board to assist in the strategic development and planning for the District.\n\nBUSD Inclusion Executive Summary\n\nA handbook was developed as a resource to support parents, teachers, administrators and support staff involved with the inclusion of students with disabilities.\n\nBUSD Inclusion Handbook\n\nIn 2009 The Civil Rights Project, in association with the University of California Berkeley Law School published a report titled, “Integration Defined: Berkeley Unified’s Strategy to Maintain School Diversity” that reviewed the history of desegregation efforts in BUSD and analyzed the current school based assignment procedures.\n\nBUSD Integration Defined Civil Rights Project\n\nTop of Page\n\nSpecial Education Eligibility – a two-prong determination:\n\nPer California Education Code 56026 (paraphrased):\n\nA student is considered an “individual with exceptional needs” if they satisfy all of the following:\n\nIdentified by an individual education program (IEP) team as a child with a disability in one or more of the 13 federal categories\n\nAND\n\nTheir impairment requires instruction and services which cannot be provided with modification of the regular school program in order to ensure that the individual is provided a free appropriate public education (FAPE)\n\nA medical diagnosis of a specific condition may inform the IEP team about which category may be considered as the area of suspected disability. However, a comprehensive evaluation must be conducted to determine if the student meets both prongs of the eligibility criteria for Special Education and related services.\n\nThe 13 Federal categories of eligibility for Special Education include:\n\nCharacteristics associated with Autism (AUT)\n\nDeaf (Deaf)\n\nDeaf-Blind (DB)\n\nEmotional Disturbance (ED)\n\nHard of Hearing (HH)\n\nIntellectual Disability (ID)\n\nMultiple Disabilities (MD)\n\nOther Health Impaired (OHI)\n\nOrthopedic Impairment (OI)\n\nSpecific Learning Disability (SLD)\n\nSpeech or Language Impaired (SLI)\n\nTraumatic Brain Injury (TBI)\n\nVisual Impairment including Blindness (VI)\n\nStudents whose educational needs are due primarily to:\n\nLimited English proficiency\n\nLack of instruction in reading or math (“per NCLB”)\n\nTemporary physical disabilities\n\nSocial maladjustment\n\nEnvironmental, cultural, or economic factors are not individuals with exceptional needs.\n\nWhat if my child has a medical diagnosis of dyslexia?\n\nPer California Education Code 56337.5 (a-c) (paraphrased):\n\nA student who is assessed as having dyslexia and who meets both prongs of the eligibility criteria listed above may be considered a student with a specific learning disability (SLD) and may receive special education and related services.\n\nIf a student exhibits characteristics of dyslexia or another related reading function is not found to be eligible for special education and related services, the student’s instructional program shall be provided in the regular education program.\n\nIt is the intent of California Legislation that program guidelines be developed for specific learning disabilities, including dyslexia and other related disorders, to be available for use by teachers and parents in order for them to have knowledge of the strategies that can be utilized with pupils for the remediation of the various types of specific learning disabilities.\n\nLegislation regarding dyslexia (AB 1369)\n\nWhat if my child has a diagnosis of ADD/ADHD?\n\nPer California Education Code 56339 (a-d) (paraphrased):\n\nA student who is adversely affected by a suspected or diagnosed attention deficit disorder (ADD) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and who meets both prongs of the eligibility criteria listed above may be considered a student with an other health impairment (OHI) and may receive special education and related services.\n\nIf a student with ADD &/or ADHD is not found to be eligible for special education and related services, the student’s instructional program shall be provided in the regular education program.\n\nIt is the intent of California Legislation that Districts promote coordination between special education and regular education programs to ensure that all students, including those with ADD &/or ADHD, receive appropriate instructional intervention.\n\nIt is also the intent of California Legislation that regular education teachers and other personnel be trained to develop an awareness about ADD &/or ADHD and the manifestation of those disorders, and that adaptations that can be implemented in regular education programs to address the instructional needs of pupils having these disorders.\n\nTop of Page\n\nSpecial Education Services\n\nSpecial Education Related Services are determined by an IEP team based on a student’s individualized needs.

recommendation for expulsion are the same for children with and without disabilities.
