        "text": "For the last 25 years Iâve focused on making learning and decision-making delightful (as the founder of Jellyvision) and creating unique games that bring people together (as the founder of Jackbox Games). Â\n\nI am now returning to an initiative I first piloted with a group of young journalists in 1993 to work toward a better way for the American democracy to solve its biggest problems. There was barely an internet then. But now we have the technology in place and a greater need than ever to find a way for Americans to come together.\n\nIâve spent the last 20 years helping improve the patient experience with digital health solutions as co-founder of Emmi Solutions and Analyte Health. Before that, I was a proud member of the original Jellyvision creative team and helped launch the first âYou Donât Know Jackâ games. Before thatâ¦.I was a Hollywood film editor. (Careers are squiggly paths, not straight lines.)\n\nI believe that when we, as Americans, are divided into political factions, we are weakened. Unifying our country based on our shared goals and beliefs is not just a naive hope â it is critical to a strong future. Letâs do this.\n\nDeadlocked in a heated argument over the most minor details are where Iâve found my clients for much of my career. I began my path as an attorney in litigation and eventually transitioned to employment law. My job was guiding the opposition to see my clientâs point of viewâ¦and in some cases pulling my client closer to the middle ground without losing value. From a BIPOC perspective, I am keenly aware of the voices often excluded from national conversation. I vibe with Unify Americaâs mission to bring more people to the table. Letâs really see whatâs important to most of us.\n\nMy career path has been a very squiggly line. I started as an attorney and then went around several curves into nonprofit leadership roles for Books & Breakfast, the Frances Willard House Museum and Archives and my local elementary school PTA. My next turn was into grassroots community organizing, and I recently completed a certificate in Corporate Social Responsibility. Throughout it all Iâve also raised four daughters (my house is currently full of teenagers.) The common theme guiding all of my work is a passionate belief that all stakeholders should have a meaningful voice in the forces that shape their lives, and itâs whatâs drawn me to Unify Americaâs mission to participate directly and collaboratively in solving our countryâs challenges.\n\nSince I was 8 years old, Iâve been actively engaged in the United States political system. Iâve spoken at city council meetings, walked doors for candidates, and volunteered with local campaigns. After graduating from Michigan State University with a degree in Cultural Anthropology, I created content for âThe Lost Geographer Podcastâ and was on staff at Kalamazoo Valley Community College.\n\nI grew up in a politically-divided household. My father, a retired police officer, is conservative and my mom, a graphic designer, is quite liberal. Together, they taught us that itâs possible to value shared goals and our shared humanity over a perceived difference. As our Community Organizer, Iâm excited to focus my skills to welcome Americaâs problem solvers and consensus builders to help make our shared goals into shared solutions.\n\nIâve spent my academic and professional career leading and supporting projects that help improve how we think, relate, and solve problems across differences. Iâve published graduate research on improving deliberation design, led Gnomi, a news app that used A.I. to grade media bias, and worked across the political bridge-building field with organizations like AllSides, Listen First Project, Bridge Alliance, and Braver Angels.\n\nAt Unify America, I get to dedicate my passion for improving collective decision-making and contribute to a vision of 21st century policymaking that empowers and inspires citizens to work together and solve our shared problems.\n\nI love to experience new places and learn from people with different backgrounds. I grew up in rural Vermont, home to maple syrup and Town Meeting Day. I moved across the country to attend college in Portland, Oregon, where I voted in my first presidential election via mail-in ballot. After college, I spent four years in Barcelona, teaching English and earning a Masterâs Degree in Public Policy. Iâve lived in Seattle for over a decade now, working in technology and advocating for prison and immigration reform.\n\nEach place Iâve lived has expanded my horizons. Living in Spain, I experienced a country where health care was accessible by all, regardless of health insurance or immigration status. This experience shaped my vision of a just and equitable society and allowed me to reflect on what I could do to contribute. Today, I get to combine my love for software development with my passion for working with people to move our society forward toward common goals.\n\nIâve spent my career building marketing strategies and co-creating communities through storytelling. Iâve led and worked alongside teams responsible for social media, content creation, advertising, public relations, and communications.\n\nAfter a stint as a strategic management consultant and a creative magazine leader, I co-founded an Ohio-based marketing agency in 2017, focused on amplifying people and organizations on a mission.\n\nMy family roots are in the deep red of South Georgia. I started my career in the very blue Boston, and, today, my home is in purple Ohio. Iâm thrilled to work with you, website bio reader, and prove that our different perspectives wonât make us weakerâtheyâll make us stronger.\n\nAll my life Iâve loved âmaking stuffâ. Growing up, a lot of the stuff I made was notoriously useless: wallets made from scraps of felt, a portrait of âPhysically-Fit Santaâ, a putt-putt golf course no one wanted to play. But there was joy in making them.\n\nâMaking stuffâ took a new form for me while studying at Amherst College, where I majored in Film and Media Studies. After graduating in 2019 I went to HOLLYWOOD, and (very) slowly started making my way up the ladder: learning on the sets of music videos, commercials, and short films. And then a global pandemic hit, so I made my way home to Connecticut, where I created videos for nonprofits dedicated to social justice.\n\nFinally, it seems, I can put my âmakingâ to good use. I can set up a camera, try to tell a story, and, if Iâm lucky, share it with you. Because those small, hopeful steps towards a kinder world? Thereâs joy in making them too.\n\nBefore joining Unify America, I served as Chief Creative Officer for Jellyvision, whose software helps millions of Americans make better decisions about their employer-provided benefits. It was no small task, given that most people would rather chew tree bark than think about health insurance.Â\n\nGetting people to pay attention to complex topics like âmedical benefitsâ and âsaving democracyâ is hard. Even when people want to get smarter or make a difference, life doesnât always make it easy. Everybodyâs busy, and Netflix and TikTok arenât going to watch themselves. Iâm interested in creating entertaining and unique new ways for people to spend time with their fellow Americans, learn a little something, and become better equipped to help keep our country intact.\n\nIâve devoted my career to researching and using communication to promote political engagement and collaborative problem solving. I completed my graduate education in communication at the Pennsylvania State University. For the last decade, Iâve served at Wabash College as a professor and the founding Director of Wabash Democracy and Public Discourse, a program devoted to designing and facilitating public deliberation events in local communities. Iâve partnered with communities across the Midwest and organizations like Indiana Humanities, the National Science Foundation, the Kettering Foundation to host deliberations and produce positive change.\n\nMy experience hosting deliberations has taught me that when we come together, listen to one another, and consider new possibilities, we can find solutions that we never thought possible. Democracy requires all of us and everyoneâs voice matters. It takes hard work, but Iâm confident that we, the people, can move forward and unify towards a better future.\n\nMy lifelong love for design has equipped me with a wide range of skills in advertising, graphic design, UI/UX, photography, illustration, and marketing. As a former marketer in the eLearning and Gamification industry, I have extensive knowledge in how to teach Americans in an effective and enjoyable way. Additionally, growing up in a pivotal swing state, Ohio, has given me a unique perspective on the political divides in the U.S.\n\nIn my current role as a Marketing Manager, I am a nonpartisan voice dedicated to helping citizens bridge political gaps through patient, respectful conversations, which I believe are essential in the face of increasing distrust for the government and polarization between political parties.\n\nWhat makes me tick?Â Getting the job done!Â How, you may ask? Through relationships and teamwork!Â Throughout my career I am most proud of the relationships I have built with colleagues, clients, partners, students, educators, board members and donors.Â My recent background is in marketing and recruiting students for academic programs in the Washington, DC area.Â When I believe in something I am at my best engaging folks and spreading the good word whether it's through digital marketing or old-fashioned word of mouth.Â Mission-driven work is my jam!\n\nIn recent years my views have been marginalized as they have been for many others and I have steadily made an ascent away from the epicenter of political mudslinging and now reside comfortably in the country replacing policos with cows for neighbors.Â And then along came Unify America like a beacon of light.Â As Engagement Manager, I am so excited to get back out there and play a part in ensuring everyoneâs voice is heard. No matter what!\n\nIâve always been a person to speak up and especially for myself. I love having discussions where I can genuinely express my feelings and be heard. Iâm probably what one would consider as a person who thinks everywhere but in the box.\n\nMy employment ventures originally started in Administration for over fifteen years. I transitioned to Healthcare and obtained my Nursing and Pharmacy Technician and licenses due to my love for the Geriatric community. My passion to bring individuals whoâs had traumatic/life - changing experiences the best empathic care that would make them feel strengthened and whole again. I wanted them to not only know but feel through my care that the preservation of their quality of life was just as important to me as it was to them. They were my âGemsâ of life.\n\nAt Unify America, Iâm able to be a seed that has been planted in a world thatâs about to change like never before. The vision for all citizens peacefully problem-solving to make the world a better place. I love it and lâm thrilled to be on board!\n\nI have fond memories from my early, formative years of conversations with my father about ethics, faith, and God. He was partly an educator with a Ph.D. in world religions and partly a Protestant minister. He encouraged the asking of big questions without ever insisting on rigid beliefs. This enhanced my natural curiosity to explore complex issues without clear answers.\n\nLearning together how to live together and peacefully navigate our inevitable disagreements in a diverse democracy raises questions without one correct answer. The pursuit of potential answers is what drew me to Unify Americaâs work. Engaging in such exploration with wonderful people inside and outside our organization is energizing.\n\nAs a member of the Deliberative Democracy team, I bring a background in education, social services, and some community organizing. I aspire to use these educational and people skills to help bridge the gap between more abstract theories of democracy with real-world decision-making.\n\nI spent the first 17, and the last 6, years of my life in Montana. Growing up and living in a small town very much shaped the person I am today: open, honest, and family-oriented. Those three things are also what brought me to Unify America. I love that our mission is to make our country better for future family generations through open and honest communication!\n\nWhen Iâm not nerding out over books or history or politics, I love to be outdoors as much as possible. That being said, I hate the cold and winter weather Iâve been accustomed to for many years. Give me a mountain, snacks, and all of the sunshine possible!\n\nI have spent almost 20 years in the technology and software engineering space. From employee #2 of a successful tech startup to Director of Engineering for an international nonprofit, I have experienced many organization types, built diverse and high-performing teams, and architected reliable, performant, scalable software solutions. I love using technology to make peopleâs lives easier and automate away the mundane so people can focus on the extraordinary.\n\nIn addition to my passion for software engineering, I love exploring the intersection of technology and government, power dynamics, and citizen engagement. My doctoral dissertation looked at social media use in the context of deliberative democracy. I have peer-reviewed work on the power dynamics of technology-influenced civic engagement from quantitative and qualitative lenses. I came to work at Unify America, so I could move beyond theory and into the practice of leveraging technology to bring the promise of scaled deliberative democracy into the real world.\n\nAs a Political Science Ph.D. student at The Ohio State University concentrating on American Politics, Political Methodology, and Political Psychology, Iâm interested broadly in public opinion, race politics, unorthodox political attitudes, and radicalization. When Iâm not engaged in independent or collaborative research projects, I like to travel to body art conventions and find cute dessert shops.\n\nâ\n\nMy work as a graduate student is mainly theoretical. It informs other academics, but I get to apply the research and methodological skills Iâve honed to aid real-world decision-making at Unify America. I hope my work for the Deliberation Research team empowers citizens to look beyond partisanship and to work together to solve the collective problems we face as a nation.\n\nI first got involved with campus and community organizingâ¦by accident. In 2014, I was a sophomore in college sitting in my Public Health class, and our student-run nonprofit made an announcement about several public interest campaigns they were launching. At the time, I didnât think filling out an interest form would turn into a full-fledged career in nonprofit work.\n\nâ\n\nSince that classroom announcement in 2014, Iâve organized and trained students and community members across eight states to run nonpartisan issue-based campaigns that win (and many times not so much, but made progress).\n\nâ\n\nMany donât expect me to do this type of work. Heck, I got into this work not knowing what advocacy, policy, or even making change meant.\n\nâ\n\nWhatâs kept me grounded, despite often questioning my life choices, are people. Through relationship building and listening, we can identify shared world visions and the endless ways to work towards those visions together.\n\nâ\n\nWhen Iâm not talking about social change, you can find me in the mountains, paddle-boarding, or testing out a new recipe I found on Instagram.\n\nMy first job out of college was working for a grassroots public deliberation initiative. The opportunity to work alongside fellow community members as we imagined new solutions to complex problems was impactful and left me with a lasting belief in deliberationâs transformative potential. After spending two years in graduate school studying cities, culture, and politics in 20th-century American History, Iâm excited to tap into bridge-building work with Unify. It is a privilege to work alongside others committed to designing and implementing deliberative strategies that equip communities to solve problems in ways that didnât previously seem possible."
