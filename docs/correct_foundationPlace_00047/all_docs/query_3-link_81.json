        "text": "“Dear Members of the Rialto Unified Educational Community: At its regular meeting on May 8, 2024, the Board of Education took action to place Superintendent Dr. Avila on non-disciplinary paid leave effective immediately. Dr. Edward D’Souza has agreed to serve as Acting Superintendent. Dr. Ed D’Souza knows our District and has over 40 years in education with a demonstrated commitment to student achievement and equity. The Board is confident in Dr. Ed D’Souza’s ability to lead the District at this moment and deeply appreciates his willingness to do so. We know that many of you will have questions. This action, however, is a confidential personnel matter. As a result, to respect the Superintendent's employee privacy rights, the Board, its individual members, and District staff will refrain from providing comment. The Board will provide updates and discuss and address these matters through its designated spokesperson when it is appropriate.\" — Rialto Unified School District Board of Education"
