An email has been sent to your VUSD account with important information. Please read this email carefully, as well as the documents attached to it.\n\nIt’s very important that you read the Open Enrollment Packet by clicking here. You can also view a Medical Plan Comparison sheet by clicking here.\n\nMost premiums (Payroll deductions) will be changing, so please view the new Rate Sheet by clicking here. These new Payroll deductions will start on your September paycheck (September deduction pays for October benefits).\n\nThis year’s Open Enrollment will be “Changes Only.” That means that you only need to take action if you want to make a change to your benefit plans (change from one plan to another) or change your covered dependents.\n\nIf, after reading the Open Enrollment material, you want to change from one plan to another, or change your dependents, please complete the appropriate form(s) based on the scenarios below.\n\nI want to change from my current High Kaiser plan to the Low Kaiser plan\n\n• Kaiser Low Enrollment Form\n\nI want to change from my current Low Kaiser plan to the High Kaiser plan\n\n• Kaiser High Enrollment Form\n\nI want to change from Kaiser to an Anthem medical plan\n\n• Anthem Enrollment Form\n\nI want to change from an Anthem medical plan to the Kaiser High plan\n\n• Kaiser High Enrollment Form\n\nI want to change from an Anthem medical plan to the Kaiser Low plan\n\n• Kaiser Low Enrollment Form\n\nI want to change from one Anthem plan to a different Anthem plan\n\n• Anthem Enrollment Form\n\nI want to add/delete dependents on my current medical plan (not changing plans, just changing dependents)\n\n• Member Change Form\n\nI want to change from one dental plan to the other dental plan\n\n• Delta Dental Enrollment/Change Form\n\nI have benefits through my Spouse, Military, etc., and I want to Waive benefits through VUSD.\n\n• Please Contact the VUSD Benefits Office for details (Jarrod Madrusso or Claudia McIntyre)"
