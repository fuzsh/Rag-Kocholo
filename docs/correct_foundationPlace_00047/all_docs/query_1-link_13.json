        "text": "Overview\n\nIn general, companies that do the following are required to have interstate Operating Authority (Docket number) in addition to a USDOT number:\n\nTransport passengers in interstate commerce (for a fee or other compensation, whether direct or indirect)\n\nTransport federally-regulated commodities owned by others or arranging for their transport, (for a fee or other compensation, in interstate commerce)\n\nFMCSA operating authority is often identified as an \"MC,\" \"FF,\" or \"MX\" number, depending on the type of authority that is granted. Unlike the USDOT Number application process, a company may need to obtain multiple operating authorities to support its planned business operations. Operating Authority dictates the type of operation a company may run and the cargo it may carry.\n\nTypes of Authority\n\nReady to Apply?\n\nFiling Fees\n\nApply for Authority\n\nHow Long Does the Process Take?\n\nHow Do I Check My Application Status?\n\nTransfer of Operating Authority Registration\n\nWho Does Not Need Authority?\n\nAll of this also dictates the level of insurance/financial responsibilities a company must maintain. Carriers not required to have operating authority include:\n\nPrivate carriers (carriers that transport their own cargo)\n\n“For-hire\" carriers that exclusively haul exempt commodities (cargo that is not federally regulated)\n\nCarriers that operate exclusively within a federally designated \"commercial zone\" that is exempt from interstate authority rules. A commercial zone is, for example, a geographic territory that includes multiple states bordering on a major metropolitan city, such as Virginia/Maryland/Washington, DC\n\nTypes of Authority\n\nThe type(s) of Operating Authority requested will impact the type and level of insurance that is required by FMCSA. Therefore, carefully select only the type(s) of Operating Authority relevant to the business. FMCSA does not refund application fees. Descriptions of the different types of interstate Operating Authority are as follows:\n\nReview Types of Authority\n\nFiling Fees\n\nAction Fee Permanent Authority $300.00 Notice of Name Change $14.00 Reinstate Authority $80.00\n\nNOTE: Separate fees must be submitted for each kind of authority sought. Please note that there are NO REFUNDS for mistaken applications.\n\nApply for Authority\n\nUnified Registration System (first-time applicants)\n\nFirst-time applicants, who have never registered with FMCSA before and have not been issued a US DOT number, need to register via the new Unified Registration System as of December 12, 2015. To register, click here.\n\nApplicants who are already registered for a USDOT number, or who are applying for an additional authority, can apply online using FMCSA’s legacy registration system with a credit card.\n\nCredit Card via US Mail\n\nIf you are already registered with FMCSA, but wish to add an operating authority, you can register using a form and credit card via US Mail. Credit card payments and completed applications should be mailed to:\n\nFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration\n\n1200 New Jersey Avenue SE, MC-RS\n\nRoom W65-206\n\nWashington, DC 20590\n\nCheck via US Mail\n\nIf you are already registered with FMCSA, but wish to add an operating authority, you can register using a form and a check via US Mail. Payment may be combined. Applications and other filings accompanied by improper fees will not be accepted. Please note: submitting payment by check through the mail may delay the processing of your form by 6-8 weeks, due to mail times before and after the check is cashed by the bank. We don’t recommend this method.\n\nChecks should be made payable to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.\n\nApplications and payments should be sent to:\n\nFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration\n\nP. O. BOX 6200-33\n\nPortland, OR 97228-6200\n\nExpress Mail\n\nApplications and payments should be sent to:\n\nU.S. Bank Government Lockbox\n\nAttn: Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration 6200-33\n\n17650 NE Sandy Blvd.\n\nPortland, OR 97230\n\nHow Long Does the Process Take?\n\nURS applications (new applicants only) may take 20-25 business days, unless they are subject to further review by the agency, in which case it could take an additional 8 weeks or longer\n\nUS Mail carrier applications (existing carriers) may take 45-60 business days\n\nHow Do I Check My Application Status?\n\nTo check whether your operating authority has been issued(granted),\n\nGo to the SAFER website\n\nSee bold heading “FMCSA Searches”\n\nClick on “Licensing & Insurance”\n\nEnter MC Number or USDOT Number in the appropriate box and click “search”\n\nClick “HTML”\n\nScroll to bottom and click on “Authority History.” This page will display the granted date of the operating authority"
