        "text": "The Long Beach Community College District (LBCCD) Citizens’ Oversight Committee (COC) is now accepting applications from community members for two vacancies: one Community-at-Large member, and one representative who is an active member of a bona fide taxpayers’ association. The application period to apply to become a member of the COC will run through Fri., Sept. 6, 2024.\n\nCitizens’ Oversight Committee applicants must be at least 18 years of age and reside within the LBCCD boundary, which includes the cities of Avalon, Lakewood, Long Beach, and Signal Hill.\n\nLong Beach City College (LBCC) has regained “large college” status after declines caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Campus leadership and staff has worked hard to boost enrollment with comprehensive outreach campaigns, determined efforts to improve college completion, and the creation of an inclusive/anti-racist environment are among the many efforts that have led to LBCC being one of the few community colleges in California to recapture their pre-COVID enrollment numbers.\n\nTo continue to advance Long Beach City College’s (LBCC’s) vital mission of providing affordable higher education options for local residents, returning veterans, and college students seeking job training and preparation for successful careers, the Long Beach Community College District (LBCCD) Board of Trustees took action last night to place a $990 million facilities bond proposal on the November 5, 2024 General Presidential Election ballot. The Board’s vote was unanimous, with all five trustees voting in favor of the resolution.\n\nIt is an exciting Summer for Long Beach City College (LBCC) Vikings Water Polo Head Coach Chris Oeding, who was first inducted into the USA Water Polo Hall of Fame on June 7, and will now head to Paris for his third trip to the Olympics as a coach.\n\nSince 2000, Oeding has served as head coach for the LBCC water polo and swimming programs, leading them to six state championships. In 2013, he joined the staff of the US women’s national team as an assistant coach, a role he has served in for five World Championships."
