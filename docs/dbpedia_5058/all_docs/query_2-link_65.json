        "text": "ROD LAVER ARENA — “Another Raducanu is on the verge of glory” the headlines breathlessly proclaimed as Dayana Yastremska, a qualifier, booked her place in the Australian Open semi-finals.\n\nShe is the first woman to do so at the major since Christine Dorey in 1978, a reminder that even in the wildly unpredictable world of women’s tennis, coming from qualifying to the latter stages of a grand slam is a rarity.\n\nAs such, the comparisons to Emma Raducanu, who went all the way to win the US Open title in 2021, the first ever to do it as a qualifier, are inevitable.\n\nBut they do a disservice to the turmoil that Yastremska, a former world No 21, has been through over the last three years.\n\nShe hit her career-high ranking here in Australia back in 2020 after reaching the final of Adelaide, only denied a fourth WTA title by Ash Barty.\n\nBut her tale of woe began in November 2020 when she tested positive for a banned steroid and was, when the result was confirmed, provisionally suspended six weeks later.\n\nThe Ukrainian desperately tried to have the provisional suspension lifted by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), “resolutely determined” to clear her name, but CAS ruled against her and she was suspended for the duration of the investigation.\n\nIt took more than five months for a tribunal to return a “no fault or negligence” verdict and declare Yastremska immediately eligible to return to competition.\n\nDespite still being ranked in the top 40 on her return, Yastremska’s form deserted her and when eventually the protection afforded to her place in the standings dropped off, she lost her place in the top 100, sinking as low as 158 last summer.\n\n“I think that I have a dream since I’m a child, and that’s what was moving me forward no matter what happens,” Yastremska said.\n\n“I had a lot of difficult situations… but for now I can say… I [am] relaxed. I don’t have much to say. Just relaxed, and I try to enjoy what I’m doing.\n\n“I was putting a lot of pressure on myself, responsibility. Now I just took everything out of my bag, and I’m trying to enjoy it.”\n\nAdded to that, Yastremska is from Odesa in Ukraine. Since February 2022, the city has been bombed by Russian attacks targeting grain storage, port infrastructure and cultural heritage sites, described by the UN as a possible war crime.\n\n“When I was in Brisbane, the rocket arrive on my grandmother house,” Yastremska added.\n\n“It’s tough emotionally to play, but the worst thing is you feel like you were already accepting this, what is happening.\n\n“And people are starting to forget about what is going on. It’s tough to play, but after two years you get to manage already how to deal with all the emotions and with everything that is going on inside.”\n\nA year ago, the plight of Ukraine was a major focus at the Australian Open. An exhibition event featuring the likes of Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray and Coco Gauff helped the grand slam events raise more than $$3.5m (£2.7m) in aid.\n\nBut both Marta Kostyuk and Lesia Tsurenko, the Ukrainian Nos 1 and 2 have expressed disappointment that “for a lot of people, it’s over” and Yastremska has been using the post-match invitation to sign the camera as a moment to send a message to the people of Ukraine.\n\n“I’m very proud of them. They really deserve a huge respect. I always try to write something for Ukraine, about Ukraine,” Yastremska said.\n\n“I think it’s my mission here. If I do well, I can get… [it’s] tough to express. I’m just trying to give the signal to Ukraine that I’m really proud of it.”"
