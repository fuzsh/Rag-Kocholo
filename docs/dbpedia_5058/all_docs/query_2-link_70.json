Who will be the next unknown Sim with the talent, passion, and determination to take them from rags to riches and make their dreams come true? Name Starlight Shores Game The Sims 3: Showtime Housed residents 70 Onomatology\n\nStarlight Shores is a world in The Sims 3: Showtime expansion pack. It was announced officially in an EA press release.\n\nOverview[]\n\nStarlight Shores is a city that was shipped with The Sims 3: Showtime. It is loosely based on a Californian-type urban area, specifically Hollywood. It has a park, coffeehouses, Show venues, etc., and some of the rabbit holes were combined with venues or a new shell to the outside was added.\n\nThere is also a beach with houses along the coastline. The houses seem to be between modern and old styled. Most of the very expensive houses have families living in them. There is one unique house that consists of two lots. The first lot being big, with the main house and a pool, and the second lot being small, has a poolhouse and garage. The lots are neatly placed that it appears to be one long lot.
