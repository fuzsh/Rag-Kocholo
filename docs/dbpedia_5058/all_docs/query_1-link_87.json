        "text": "Nokia Cloud Signaling Director (CSD) simplifies interoperability, enables massive scalability, and secures signaling in 5G networks, and addresses the challenges of 4G traffic growth.\n\nWhat is Cloud Signaling Director?\n\nThe CSD is Nokia’s cloud-native software that provides control for the 5G’s HTTP/2 signaling, both within the 5G core and between the 5G core and untrusted peer networks & untrusted slices (e.g., enterprise, IoT).\n\nIt provides three important 5G core network functions:\n\n5G Service Communication Proxy (5G SCP)\n\n5G Security Edge Protection Proxy (5G SEPP)\n\n5G Binding Support Function (5G BSF)\n\nIn 4G networks, CSD implements 4G’s Diameter Signaling Controller (DSC).\n\nNokia CSD can be deployed in any environment, as a CNF, VNF, or PNF. It is designed for extremely high performance, using the Agile Rules Processing (A.R.T.) engine. CSD supports every standard signaling model, as well as non-standard models.\n\nPerformance, automation and new business drive 5G signaling\n\nIn 5G networks, signaling changes from Diameter to 5G’s HTTP/2 and JSON. The challenges in deploying your 5G core include:\n\nFully utilizing the 5G core’s Service Based Architecture (SBA), including dynamic configurations, massive scaling, and resilience.\n\nEnsuring interoperability across the 5G core, both within and between networks.\n\nBuilding in security from the start for internal and external threats.\n\nPopular LTE services are driving rapid growth of Diameter traffic\n\nIn 4G networks, Diameter-based control plane traffic is escalating as consumers embrace advanced mobile broadband services. This growth results in an increasingly complex control topology and creates inefficiency and unpredictability.\n\nTo deliver the rich, secure experiences your customers want, you need an intelligent product that brings greater flexibility to the signaling control plane.\n\nExtensive signaling experience\n\nCSD draws on our deep knowledge of signaling. We develop the signaling capabilities of our packet core, IMS, and policy and charging control solutions in house. Our products are designed to work successfully in any multivendor environment. We have used our experience to help dozens of service providers around the world with their specific signaling needs.\n\nFor more details on how the CSD provides signaling in a 5G Core, visit our 5G Signaling page."
