        "text": "Roger Federer’s possible return to tennis is ‘not off the table’ two years after his retirement at the 2022 Laver Cup, according to reports.\n\nSwiss legend Federer ended his career two years ago and played his final professional match alongside Rafael Nadal in doubles at The O2 in London.\n\nThe 43-year-old, considered by most to be among the greatest players of all time, is loved by the entire tennis community and many are keen to see him come back.\n\nIt has now emerged that there is ‘optimism’ Federer could return to the tennis world, the Daily Express reported on Thursday, on the day of the icon’s birthday.\n\nThey claim that Federer’s return is ‘not off to the table’ although did hint that it may be in a ‘non-playing role’ with a comeback likely to ‘pull on his heartstrings’.\n\nFederer is adored all across the ATP Tour – but particularly in Great Britain – where he has landed a record eight Wimbledon titles in the men’s singles.\n\nThe 20-time major champion is part of the ‘Big Three’ era of tennis, dominating the sport alongside his rivals Nadal and Novak Djokovic for around two decades.\n\nNadal, 38, is still playing but there has been huge speculation over his retirement and the Spaniard himself has been very open about plans to hang up his racket.\n\nIt was thought that 2024 would be Nadal’s final year in tennis – but he made somewhat of a U-turn after the French Open – before pulling out of the US Open.\n\nDjokovic, 37, has no desire whatsoever to retire and is keen to continue fighting the new generation of top players including Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.\n\nThe Serbian recently clinched Olympic gold at Paris 2024 and if he lands the US Open title next month, his tally of Grand Slam singles trophies will become 25.\n\nThat would move him clear of women’s tennis legend Margaret Court and see Djokovic emerge as the only player in the sport’s history to win 25 major titles.\n\n‘I don’t have retirement close in my mind, to be honest,’ Djokovic said in July ahead of the Olympic tennis tournament at Roland-Garros.\n\n‘Even though I know a lot of people would love me to retire so this era is done. But I think as long as there’s at least one of us left competing, the era is still going.’\n\nMORE : Classy Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek will follow their French Open triumphs by striking Olympic gold in Paris\n\nMORE : Novak Djokovic has ‘great motivation’ to equal Roger Federer’s Wimbledon record"
