Examples of most MODS data elements are also presented. The elements and attributes are listed in the same order as is presented in the MODS schema.\n\n<titleInfo>\n\nAttributes\n\ntype - This attribute is applied when it is necessary to identify what type of title is recorded. For the main title (MARC 21 field 245), no type is indicated. The following values may be used with the type attribute:\n\nabbreviated (equivalent to MARC 21 field 210)\n\ntranslated (equivalent to MARC 21 field 242, 246)\n\nalternative (equivalent to MARC 21 fields 246, 740)\n\nuniform (equivalent to MARC 21 fields 130, 240, 730)\n\nauthority - The name of the authoritative list for a controlled value is recorded here. An authority attribute may be used to indicate that a title is controlled by a record in an authority file (e.g. authority=\"naf\"). A list of authority files is maintained at: www.loc.gov/marc/sourcecode/authorityfile/authorityfilesource.html.\n\ndisplayLabel - This attribute is intended to be used when additional text associated with the title is needed for display. It is equivalent to MARC 21 field 246 subfield $i.\n\nxlink - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nID - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nlang - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nxml:lang - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nscript - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\ntransliteration - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nSubelements\n\nThe following subelements are defined for \"titleInfo.\" They are enumerated below.\n\n<title>\n\n<subTitle>\n\n<partNumber>\n\n<partName>\n\n<nonSort>\n\nExamples\n\n<titleInfo type=\"alternative\" displayLabel=\"also known as:\"> <title>Bush Cheney</title> </titleInfo> <titleInfo> <title >Bush-Cheney 2000</title> </titleInfo> <titleInfo type=\"alternative\"> <title >George W.

The following values may be used with it:\n\npersonal\n\ncorporate\n\nconference\n\nauthority - The name of the authoritative list for a controlled value is recorded here. An authority attribute may be used to indicate that a name is controlled by a record in an authority file (e.g., authority=\"naf\"). A list of authorities is maintained at: www.loc.gov/marc/sourcecode/authorityfile/authorityfilesource.html.\n\nxlink - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nID - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nlang - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nxml:lang - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nscript - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\ntransliteration - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nSubelements\n\nThe following subelements are defined for <name>. They are enumerated below.\n\n<namePart>\n\n<displayForm>\n\n<affiliation>\n\n<role>\n\n<description>\n\n<name> <namePart>\n\n\"namePart\" includes each part of the name that is parsed. Parsing is used to indicate a date associated with the name, to parse the parts of a corporate name (MARC 21 fields X10 subfields $a and $b), or to parse parts of a personal name if desired (into family and given name). The latter is not done in MARC 21. Names are expected to be in a structured form (e.g. surname, forename).\n\nAttribute\n\ntype - The following values may be used with the type attribute:\n\ndate\n\nfamily\n\ngiven\n\ntermsOfAddress\n\nThe attribute \"date\" is used to parse dates that are not integral parts of a name. Dates that are part of a name, e.g. dates within a conference name, do not use this attribute to separate the date, since it is an integral part of the name string. The birthdate associated with a personal name, however, is not an integral part of the name but added to distinguish the name from others, so it does include a separate namePart with type=\"date\". This attribute is not used when parsing the components of a corporate name.\n\n\"termsOfAddress\" is used to record titles and enumeration associated with a name, such as Jr., II, etc. It is roughly equivalent to MARC X00 fields, subfields $b and $c.\n\nNote that \"family\" and \"given\" are not used in MARC 21.\n\n<name> <role>\n\nDefinition: A term(s) that designates the relationship (role) of the entity recorded in name in relation to the resource.\n\nApplication: \"role\" is a wrapper element that may contain a value in coded or textual form. <role> is equivalent to a MARC relator code or its textual form.\n\nSubelement\n\n<roleTerm>\n\n\"roleTerm\" contains the textual or coded form of a relator/role. An authority should be indicated if using a coded form for role. If the textual form is from a controlled list (e.g., the MARC relators list), an authority attribute may be indicated (but is not mandatory). If both a code and a term are given that represent the same role, use one <role> and multiple occurrences of <roleTerm>. If different roles, repeat <role><roleTerm>.\n\nAttributes\n\ntype - This attribute may be used with the following values:\n\ntext - This value is used to express role in a textual form.\n\ncode - This value is used to express place in a coded form. The authority attribute may be used to indicate the source of the code.\n\nauthority - The name of the authoritative list for a controlled value is recorded here. A list of codes for authorities is maintained at: www.loc.gov/marc/sourcecode/relator/relatorsource.html. To indicate the MARC relators list, use authority= \"marcrelator.\"\n\nExamples\n\n<name type=\"personal\"> <namePart type=\"termsOfAddress\">Dr.</namePart> <namePart>Brown, B.

It may also be applied to electronic resources that are collections in the sense of a made-up multipart group of items.\n\nmanuscript - This attribute is used as manuscript=\"yes\" when the resource is written in handwriting or typescript. MARC 21 Leader/06 values \"d\", \"f\" and \"t\" designate manuscript items (combined with other type of resource information).\n\nValues\n\nThe following values may be used with <typeOfResource>:\n\ntext (for \"language material\"; includes MARC 21 Leader/06 values \"a\" and \"t\").\n\ncartographic (includes MARC 21 Leader/06 values \"e\" and \"f\").\n\nnotated music (includes MARC 21 Leader/06 values \"c\" and \"d\").\n\nsound recording - This value by itself is used when a mixture of musical and nonmusical sound recordings occurs in a resource or when a user does not want to make a distinction between musical and nonmusical.\n\nsound recording-musical - This is roughly equivalent to MARC 21 Leader/06 value \"j\" and is used when a resource is predominately a musical sound recording.\n\nsound recording-nonmusical - This is roughly equivalent to MARC 21 Leader/06 value \"i\" and is used when the sound recording is nonmusical in nature.\n\nstill image (includes MARC 21 value \"k\") - Note that Leader/06 value \"k\" in MARC 21 is defined as \"Two-dimensional nonprojectible graphic\" so that this is not an exact equivalent. Slides and transparencies are also considered still images in MODS, although in MARC 21 they are coded as Leader/06 code \"g\" (projected medium).\n\nmoving image (includes MARC 21 Leader/06 value \"g\") - Note that value \"g\" in MARC 21 is defined as \"Projected medium,\" so this is not an exact equivalent. It includes motion pictures and videorecordings, as well as television programs, digital video and animated computer graphics, but not slides and transparencies. It does not include moving images that are primarily computer programs, such as computer games or computer-oriented multimedia (these are included in \"software, multimedia\").\n\nthree dimensional object (includes MARC 21 Leader/06 value \"r\").\n\nsoftware, multimedia (includes MARC 21 Leader/06 value \"m\") - This value is appropriate for any electronic resource without a significant aspect that indicates on of the other <typeOfResource> categories. It includes: software, numeric data, computer-oriented multimedia and online systems and services.\n\nmixed material (includes MARC 21 Leader/06 value \"p\") - This value uses the same definitions as value \"p\" (It indicates that there are significant materials in two or more forms that are usually related by virtue of their having been accumulated by or about a person or body. Mixed material includes archival fonds and manuscript collections of mixed forms of materials, such as text, photographs, and sound recordings.)\n\nSubelements\n\nThere are no subelements defined for <typeOfResource>.\n\nExamples\n\n<titleInfo> <nonSort>The </nonSort> <title>new naval and military map of the United States</title> </titleInfo> <typeOfResource>cartographic</typeOfResource> <genre>map</genre>\n\n<titleInfo> <title>Camp Council meeting; speech by Dewey Rodgers</title> </titleInfo> <typeOfResource>sound recording-nonmusical</typeOfResource> <genre authority=\"marcgt\">speech</genre>\n\n<titleInfo> <title>Glove</title> </titleInfo> <physicalDescription> <form authority=\"gmd\">[sound recording]</form> </physicalDescription> <typeOfResource>sound recording-musical</typeOfResource>\n\n<titleInfo> <title>[Portrait of Django Reinhardt, Aquarium, New York, N.Y., ca.

Places as subjects are included under <subject><geographic> or <subject><hierarchicalGeographic>. <place> is used in connection with the origin of a resource, i.e., publication, issuance, etc.\n\nSubelement\n\n<placeTerm>\n\n\"placeTerm\" is used to express place in a textual or coded form. If both a code and a term are given that represent the same place, use one <place> and multiple occurrences of <placeTerm>. If different places, repeat <place><placeTerm>.\n\nAttributes:\n\ntype - This attribute may be used with the following values:\n\ntext - This value is used to express place in a textual form (may be place of publication as expressed in MARC 21 field 260 subfield $a).\n\ncode- This value is used to express place in a coded form. The authority attribute may be used to indicate the source of the code.\n\nauthority - This attribute may be used with the following values:\n\nmarccountry - This value is used with the MARC country codes (as used in field 008/15-17). A listing of the MARC country codes is online at: www.loc.gov/marc/countries/\n\niso3166 - This value is used with country codes from ISO 3166. A listing of the ISO 3166 country codes is online at: www.iso.ch/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/index.html\n\n<originInfo>\n\nDates\n\nNote that there is no wrapper element for dates.\n\n<originInfo>\n\nDefinition: the date that the resource was published, released or issued.\n\nApplication: \"dateIssued\" is equivalent to dates in MARC 21 field 260 subfield $c. It may be in textual or structured form. <dateIssued> may be recorded according to the MARC 21 rules for field 008/07-14 with encoding=\"marc.\"\n\nAttributes\n\nencoding - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\npoint - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nkeyDate - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nqualifier - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\n<originInfo>\n\nDefinition: the date of creation of the resource.\n\nApplication: \"dateCreated\" may be in textual or structured form. This type of date is recorded in various places in MARC 21: field 260 subfield $g, for some types of material in field 260 subfield $c, date of original in field 534 subfield $c and date of reproduction in field 533 subfield $d. If creation date is also the origination date as used in MARC 21 field 260 subfield $c, use the <dateIssued> element or repeat both <dateCreated and <dateIssued>.\n\nAttributes\n\nencoding - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\npoint - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nkeyDate - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nqualifier - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\n<originInfo>\n\nDefinition: the date on which the resource was digitized or a subsequent snapshot was taken.\n\nApplication: \"dateCaptured\" is particularly useful for Web resources because of their changeability. This could be a date that the resource was captured or could also be the date of creation. This is roughly equivalent to MARC field 033.\n\nAttributes\n\nencoding - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\npoint - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nkeyDate - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nqualifier - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\n<originInfo>\n\nDefinition: a date in which the content of a resource is valid.\n\nApplication: \"dateValid\" is roughly equivalent to MARC 21 field 046 subfields $m and $n.\n\nAttributes\n\nencoding - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\npoint - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nkeyDate - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nqualifier - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\n<originInfo>\n\nDefinition: a date in which a resource is modified or changed.\n\nApplication: Note that dateModified is used for modification of the resource, not of the metadata.

It may be expressed in textual or coded form. If in coded form, the source of the code is contained in the value of the authority attribute. If no authority is given, it is assumed that the content is textual. (Alternatively, instead of using a textual form, the content may be in coded form with an authority attribute, and an XSLT stylesheet may be used to translate the code into a textual form.) If there is more than one representation of the same language, e.g. using different forms of the same language (code or text) or from different authorities, <languageTerm> is repeated within the <language> container. If the content of the resource is in more than one language, <language> is repeated.\n\nAttributes:\n\ntype - This attribute may be used with the following values:\n\ntext - This value is used to express language in a textual form.\n\ncode- This value is used to express language in a coded form.\n\nauthority - This attribute may contain the following values:\n\niso639-2b - A bibliographic language code from ISO 639-2 (Codes for the representation of names of languages: alpha-3 code).

Après un long et périlleux voyage via l'Afghanistan, ces derniers pénètrent dans une contrée sauvage, le Kafristan, où des villageois sont en guerre contre une ville rivale. Tous deux s'engagent dans la bataille.Au cours des combats, Dravot reçoit une flèche en pleine poitrine, mais continue à lutter. En réalité, la flèche s'est plantée dans la catouchière. Mais aux yeux du peuple, il passe pour un être surnaturel, le dieu Sikander, fils d'Alexandre le Grand.

The word 'library' may eventually be dropped from our vocabulary, to be replaced by the 'idea store'. Books are being displaced by computers, multimedia content, playgrounds, thematic displays, and cafes. This is proving extremely propular, given the surge in client population.

An authority attribute may be used to indicate that a subject is controlled by a record in an authority file. A list of authorities is maintained at: www.loc.gov/marc/sourcecode/subject/subjectsource.html. This attribute is equivalent to MARC 21 field 6XX, second indicator value or content of subfield $2. If the subject string is formulated according to the Library of Congress Subject Headings (or LC Name Authority File), the value of the authority attribute is \"lcsh.\" A subject thesaurus that does not include names but has an implied authority for names uses the designation for that thesaurus (i.e., \"lcsh\" means LCSH plus NAF). Specify authority at the highest level if there are subelements; optionally it may also be specified for a subelement. Authority is not applicable to the subelement <hierarchicalGeographic>.\n\n xlink - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\n ID - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\n lang - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\n xml:lang - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\n script - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\n transliteration - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nSubelements\n\nThe following subelements are defined for <subject>.

If there is an uncontrolled term, <topic> is used (since <subject> is a binding element). <topic> is equivalent to MARC 21 fields 650 and 6XX subfields $x and $v (with authority attribute defined) and MARC 21 field 653 with no authority attribute.\n\nNote that form subdivisions in LCSH are coded as <topic> because it was felt that the distinction was too difficult to make.\n\n<subject>\n\n<geographic>\n\n\"geographic\" is used for geographic subject terms that are not parsed as hierarchical geographics. If the geographic name is part of a corporate body (i.e., United States. Senate), it is coded as <name>, not <geographic>. <geographic> is equivalent to MARC 21 field 651 and 6XX subfield $z.\n\n<subject>\n\n<temporal>\n\n\"temporal\" is used for chronological subject terms or temporal coverage. It may be expressed as a controlled subject term or as a structured date using the same data definition as MODS dates. <temporal> is equivalent to MARC 21 fields 045 and 6XX subfield $y.\n\nAttributes\n\nencoding - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\npoint - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nkeyDate - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\n<subject>\n\n<titleInfo>\n\n\"titleInfo\" includes a title used as a subject. All subelements and attributes used under the top-level element <titleInfo> may be used with this subelement.

It may also include the full call number if desired. This is equivalent to MARC fields 050-08X, subfields $a and $b.\n\nAttributes\n\nauthority - The name of the authoritative list for a controlled value is recorded here.

It is thus fully recursive.\n\n<relatedItem> is equivalent to several fields in MARC 21. It includes the following:\n\nname/title added entries (fields 700, 710, 711 that include subfield $t); type=\"constituent\"\n\nseries statements (fields 440, 490, 8XX); type=\"series\"\n\nlinking entry fields (fields 76X-78X); various types\n\noriginal version note (field 534); type=\"original\"\n\nSince <relatedItem> may include any MODS element as a subelement, it may describe a constituent item if that is desired. This may be suitable, for instance, for complex objects that require specific descriptive information for constituent parts, but that are considered intellectually one object (e.g. a CD with several tracks, digitized or analog). Many of the MODS elements used here as subelements have mappings in the MARC 21 76X-78X fields, while others do not.\n\nAttributes\n\ntype - The value of the type attribute describes the relationship between the <relatedItem> and the resource being described in the MODS record. This attribute may contain the following values:\n\npreceding - Information concerning a predecessor to the resource (Equivalent to MARC 21 field 780).\n\nsucceeding - Information concerning a successor to the resource (Equivalent to MARC 21 field 785).\n\noriginal - Information concerning an original form of the resource (Equivalent to MARC 21 fields 534, 786).\n\nhost - Information concerning a host or parent resource for the resource described; this may be a parent collection (Equivalent to MARC 21 fields 760, 772, 773).\n\nconstituent - Information concerning a constituent unit of the resource. This allows for more specific parsed information than may be used in <tableOfContents>. (Equivalent to MARC 21 fields 762, 770, 774; fields 700, 710, 711 with subfield $t).\n\nseries - Information concerning the series in which a resource is issued.\n\notherVersion - Information concerning another version (i.e. change in intellectual content) of the resource (Equivalent to MARC 21 field 775).\n\notherFormat - Information concerning another format (i.e. change in physical format) of the resource (Equivalent to MARC 21 field 776).\n\nisReferencedBy - Citations or references to published bibliographic descriptions, reviews, abstracts, or indexes of the content of the resource (Roughly equivalent to MARC 21 field 510, but allows for additional parsing of data).\n\nxlink:href - This attribute is used for an external link, including a link to a related record, if applicable. Use <identifier> for a URI for the related resource itself.\n\ndisplayLabel - This attribute is intended to be used when additional text associated with the related item is needed for display. It is equivalent to MARC 21 fields 76X-78X subfields $i and $3.\n\nID - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nSubelements\n\nSince any MODS element may be used under <relatedItem>, the following subelements may be used. See the definitions in the guidelines under applicable top-level elements.

Use the authority attribute to designate the source of the code. <physicalLocation> typically includes specific information used to locate a resource within a collection, such as the name or code of an institution/repository, and perhaps subcollection, or shelf number.\n\n<physicalLocation> is equivalent to MARC 21 field 852 subfields $a, $b, $j, and $e. If information equivalent to these subfields is included, it is given in a string and is not parsed. Fuller holdings information may be included in the MODS <extension> element using an established XML holdings schema.\n\nData previously encoded in <location> (MODS version 2) now are recorded in <physicalLocation>.\n\nAttributes\n\ndisplayLabel - This attribute is intended to be used when additional text associated with the physical location is needed for display.

It is equivalent to MARC 21 field 856 subfields $y and $3.\n\ndateLastAccessed - This attribute is intended to express the date that a digital resource has been accessed remotely. This may be useful to a user trying to access the site because of the volatility of Web content. There is no encoding scheme specified for use with this attribute, however, a structured date is recommended. There is no MARC equivalent for \"dateLast Accessed\".\n\nnote - This attribute includes notes that are associated with the link that is included as the value of the <url> element. It is generally free text.\n\naccess - This attribute indicates the type of resource that the user or aggregator will access when following the URL link. It is particularly useful to provide a flag in the context of OAI service providers harvesting metadata. The following values may be used with the access attribute:\n\npreview - indicates a link to a thumbnail or snippet of text\n\nraw object - indicates a direct link to the object described (e.g. a jpg or pdf document). Used only when the object is represented by a single file.\n\nobject in context - indicates a link to the object within the context of its environment (with associated metadata, navigation, etc.)\n\nusage - This attribute indicates how the object represented by the link will be used. Aggregators may use it to determine which URL is most appropriate for end-user display, which in most cases is the object in context (which may be marked as such using the access attribute). The following value is defined (other possible values have not yet been identified):\n\nprimary display - indicates that the link is the most appropriate to display for end users\n\nExamples\n\n<location> <physicalLocation authority=\"marcorg\">DLC MicRR Microfilm 82/528 MicRR</physicalLocation> </location>\n\n<location> <physicalLocation>Library of Congress Manuscript Division</physicalLocation> </location>\n\n<location> <physicalLocation displayLabel=\"Correspondence\">National Archives and Records Service.

It may be used as a top level element to designate physical parts or under relatedItem. It may be used under relatedItem for generating citations about the location of a part within a host/parent item. When used with relatedItem type=\"host\", <part> is roughly equivalent to MARC 21 field 773, subfields $g (Relationship information) and $q (Enumeration and first page), but allows for additional parsing of data. There is no MARC 21 equivalent to <part> at the <mods> level.\n\nTo indicate part names and numbers that are subordinate to the title as distinct intellectual items, use <title> with <partName> and/or <partNumber>. When there is a separate intellectual entity with its own identity that is part of a larger work, use <relatedItem type=\"host\"><part> to show the location of the part within that host item.\n\nAttributes\n\ntype - A designation of a document segment type. Suggested values include volume, issue, chapter, section, paragraph, track. Other values may be used as needed.\n\norder - an integer that designates the sequence of parts.\n\nID - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nSubelements\n\nThe following subelements are defined for <part>. They are enumerated below.\n\n<detail>\n\n<extent>\n\n<date>\n\n<text>\n\n<part>\n\n<detail>\n\n\"detail\" contains numbering and type of designation of the part in relation to the host/parent item in which a host item resides.\n\nAttributes\n\ntype - The type of part described. Suggested values include part, volume, issue, chapter, section, paragraph, track. Other values may be used as needed.\n\nlevel - Describes the level of numbering in the host/parent item. This is used to ensure that the numbering is retained in the proper order. An example is: \"v.2, no. 3\".\n\nSubelements\n\n<number> - Contains the actual number within the part. <caption> - Contains the caption describing the enumeration within a part. This may be the same as type, but conveys what is on the item being described. <title> - Contains the title of the part. Only include if this is different than the title in <titleInfo><title>.\n\n<extent>\n\n\"extent\" contains the measured units making up the part, such as pages, minutes, etc.\n\nAttribute\n\nunit - Suggested values include page, minute, etc.\n\nSubelements\n\n<start> - Contains the beginning unit of the extent within a part (e.g., first page). <end> - Contains the ending unit of the extent within a part. <total> - Contains the total number of units within a part, rather than specific units. <list> - Contains a textual listing of the units within a part (e.g., \"pp. 5-9\".)\n\n\"date\" contains date information relevant to the part described.\n\nAttributes\n\nencoding - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\npoint - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nqualifier - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\n<text>\n\n\"text\" contains unparsed information in textual form about the part. When used in relatedItem type=\"host\", it is equivalent to MARC 21 field 773 subfield $g.\n\nExamples\n\n<titleInfo> <title>Dana</title> <subTitle>an Irish magazine of independent thought</subTitle> <partNumber>Vol. 1, no. 4</partNumber> </titleInfo> <part> <detail> <title>Wayfarers (Poem)</title> </detail> <extent unit=\"pages\"> <start>97</start> <end>98</end> </extent> </part>\n\n<titleInfo> <title>Washington observer</title> </titleInfo> <part> <detail type=\"page number\"> <number>3</number> </detail> <extent unit=\"pages\"> <start>3</start> </extent> </part>\n\n<titleInfo>\n\n<title>Hlisen Sunnuntai-lehti. no. 78 20.02.2006</title> </titleInfo> <genre>newspaper</genre> <relatedItem type=\"constituent\" ID=\"MODSMD_ARTICLE1> <titleInfo> <title>Nuppineula.</title> <genre>article</:genre> <part ID=\"DIVL15\" type=\"paragraph\" order=\"1\"/> <part ID=\"DIVL17\" type=\"paragraph\" order=\"2\"/> <part ID=\"DIVL19\" type=\"paragraph\" order=\"3\"/> </relatedItem> <relatedItem type=\"constituent\" ID=\"MODSMD_ARTICLE2> <titleInfo> <title>Is meidn rukouksen waikutuS.

It may be used for elements that are local to the creator of the data, similar to MARC 21 9XX fields. In addition, it may be used to extend MODS for various purposes when another XML schema may handle the type of information. For instance, holdings information for the resource may be included in <extension> with a link to an XML holdings schema (such as the Z39.50 XML Holdings Schema).\n\nAttributes\n\nThere are no attributes defined for <extension>.\n\nSubelements\n\nThere are no subelements defined for <extension>.\n\nExamples\n\n<extension xmlns:dcterms=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" > <dcterms:modified>2003-03-24</dcterms:modified> </extension> [Uses extension element to include a Dublin Core element for date resource was modified.] [Alternatively, the XML definition may be at the top of the document.]\n\n<extension><holdingsStructure xmlns: \"http://www.portia.dk/zholdings/Holdings7/\n\nHoldingsSchema7EsnC2\"> <holdingsStatement-4> <holdingsSiteLocation-6 institutionOrSiteId-27=\"TxDaS\"> <subLocation-35 institutionOrSiteId-27=\"North Library\"/> </holdingsSiteLocation-6> <localHoldings-10> <copyView-12 copyNotes-74=\"arranged on shelf by title\"> </copySummaryEnumeration-62> <primaryEnum-87> <unstructured>v 1-24 1994-2000</unstructured> </primaryEnum-87> </copySummaryEnumeration-62> </copyView-12> </localHoldings-10> </holdingsStatement-4> </holdingsStructure></extension> [Uses extension element to include holdings information about a journal using the Z39.50 XML Holdings schema]\n\n<recordInfo>\n\nDefinition: information about the metadata record.\n\nApplication: \"recordInfo\" is a wrapper element that contains subelements relating to information necessary for managing metadata.

It should be repeated for each code or name recorded.\n\nAttribute\n\nauthority - The name of the authoritative list for a controlled value is recorded here. A listing of authority values is found online at: www.loc.gov/marc/sourcecode/organization/organizationsource.html. If \"marcorg\" is used, the value in <recordContentSource> is from the MARC Code List for Organizations. If the authority attribute is not included, the value is presumed to be textual (i.e. a name of an institution).\n\n<recordInfo>\n\nDefinition: the date on which the record was first created.\n\n\"recordCreationDate\" is roughly equivalent to MARC 21 field 008/00-05.\n\nAttributes\n\nencoding - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\npoint - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nkeyDate - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nqualifier - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\n<recordInfo>\n\n\"recordChangeDate\" may serve as a version identifier for the record. It is roughly equivalent to MARC 21 field 005.\n\nAttributes\n\nencoding - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\npoint - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nkeyDate - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\nqualifier - See the Attributes used throughout the schema for description.\n\n<recordInfo>\n\n<recordIdentifier>\n\n\"recordIdentifier\" contains the system control number assigned by the organization creating, using, or distributing the record. It is roughly equivalent to MARC 21 field 001. There should be only one <recordIdentifier> in a record.\n\nAttribute\n\nsource - This attribute contains the code or name of the organization whose system control number is located in the <recordIdentifier> element. It is roughly equivalent to MARC 21 field 003, except that MODS does not mandate the use of a code from the MARC Code List for Organizations. A listing of source values is found online at: www.loc.gov/marc/sourcecode/organization/organizationsource.html.\n\n<recordInfo>\n\n<recordOrigin>\n\n\"recordOrigin\" is intended to show the origin, or provenance of the MODS record. This might include what methods were used to prepare it (machine generated or human prepared), or what transformations had been applied (i.e., the result of converting an existing MARC 21 record to MARCXML and to MODS). It can be free text or an institution may establish locally-controlled values for machine processing and consistency. There is no MARC equivalent to <recordOrigin>.\n\n<recordInfo>\n\n<languageOfCataloging>\n\n\"languageOfCataloging\" applies to the language of cataloging in a record. It is roughly equivalent to MARC 21 field 040 subfield $b, except that authorities other than ISO 639-2b may also be used. Language may also be recorded at each top element level to indicate the language of the metadata in a particular element.\n\nSubelement\n\n<languageTerm> \"languageTerm\" contains the language(s) of the content of the resource. It may be expressed in textual or coded form. If in coded form, the source of the code is contained in the value of the authority attribute. If no authority is given, it is assumed that the content is textual. (Alternatively, instead of using a textual form, the content may be in coded form with an authority attribute, and an XSLT stylesheet may be used to translate the code into a textual form.) If there is more than one representation of the same language, <languageTerm> is repeated. If the content of the resource is in more than one language, <language> is repeated.\n\nAttributes:\n\ntype - This attribute may be used with the following values:\n\ntext - This value is used to express language in a textual form.\n\ncode- This value is used to express language in a coded form.\n\nauthority - This attribute may contain the following values:\n\niso639-2b - A bibliographic language code from ISO 639-2 (Codes for the representation of names of languages: alpha-3 code). The bibliographic language codes are identical to both NISO Z39.53 and the MARC Code List for Languages.\n\nrfc3066 - A language identifier as specified by the Internet Best Current Practice specification RFC3066. This value includes an ISO 639-1 (alpha-2) or ISO 639-2 (alpha-3) language code with optional secondary subtags.\n\nExamples\n\n<recordInfo> <recordCreationDate encoding=\"marc\">030211</recordCreationDate> </recordInfo>\n\n<recordInfo> <recordCreationDate>October 8, 2002</recordCreationDate> <recordOrigin>machine generated</recordOrigin> </recordInfo>\n\n<recordInfo> <recordContentSource authority=\"marcorg\">DLC</recordContentSource> </recordInfo>\n\n<recordInfo> <recordContentSource>Library of Congress</recordContentSource> </recordInfo>\n\n<recordInfo> <recordIdentifier source=\"dlc\">85753651</recordIdentifier> </recordInfo>\n\n<recordInfo> <recordIdentifier>2001627090</recordIdentifier> </recordInfo>\n\n<recordInfo> <languageOfCataloging> <languageTerm authority=\"rfc3066\">en </languageTerm> </languageOfCataloging> <languageOfCataloging> <languageTerm authority=\"rfc3066\">fr</languageTerm> </languageOfCataloging> </recordInfo> [The cataloging of the resource is in both English and French.]\n\n<recordInfo> <recordChangeDate encoding=\"iso8601\">20020311</recordChangeDate> </recordInfo>\n\n<recordInfo> <recordChangeDate encoding=\"iso8601\">20000406144503.0 </recordChangeDate> </recordInfo>\n\n<recordInfo> <recordCreationDate encoding=\"w3cdtf\">2001-07-12</recordCreationDate> </recordInfo>\n\n<recordInfo> <recordContentSource authority=\"marcorg\">DLC</recordContentSource> <recordChangeDate>June 24, 2001</recordChangeDate> </recordInfo>\n\n<recordInfo> <recordContentSource>Université René Descartes Bibliothèque </recordContentSource> <recordOrigin>human prepared</recordOrigin> <languageOfCataloging authority=\"iso639-2b\">fre</languageOfCataloging> </recordInfo>"
