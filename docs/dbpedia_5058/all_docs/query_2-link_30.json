        "text": "When much of human activity moved online during the height of the pandemic, tech companies were thriving. Call it the COVID tech bubble. Now we’ve hit the COVID tech bust.\n\nBy the second half of 2022, tech companies had initiated significant layoffs -- something that had followed an extended period of frenzied tech hiring and attention to employee experience. Standard explanations for the cuts were that companies hired too many during the pandemic and they were looking at the specter of a recession in the months ahead. It sounds a lot like the dot-com boom and bust of yore. Not all companies are impacted equally. It’s the ones that hired at an accelerated rate during the boom that seem to be hitting the brakes right now.\n\nAt the same time, IT pros with cybersecurity, cloud, and data analytics/machine learning skills have remained in high demand so far.\n\nIn this space, InformationWeek will document some of the more significant layoffs, updated regularly. Be sure to check back.\n\nHere's a look at the biggest tech layoffs so far:\n\nAugust 2024 Tech Layoffs\n\nBrave, August 28, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 27 people, 14% of workforce.\n\nThe web browser and search startup laid off 27 employees across multiple departments, which accounts for 14% of its workforce, according to TechCrunch. Though Brave confirmed the layoffs, it didn’t provide specific details about reason for the moves nor the total headcount remaining. According to TechCrunch, Brave's latest round of job cuts arrive almost 10 months after the company laid off 9% of its total workforce in October 2023. At that time, Brave said the cuts were due to “cost management in this challenging economic environment.”\n\nScale AI, August 27, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 1,300 people.\n\nThe data-annotation startup laid off at least 1,300 contract workers on Monday, according to employees familiar with the situation in a confirmation to Inc. According to the report, employees received an email from HireArt, a human resources software vendor that serves as Scale's HR department. “Today, August 26th, your employment with HireArt will be coming to an end, effective immediately; you no longer need to report to work. Your final pay will be issued by the end of the day on August 30th for your hours worked,” said the email, obtained by Inc. The majority of Scale's business comes from hiring freelance workers to train and refine generative AI programs in a process known as “tasking.” These contractors are reportedly paid hourly and often work for two of Scale's subsidiaries, Outlier AI and Remotasks.\n\n“Due to a shift in business strategy, Scale reduced its remote contractor headcount. These contractors were employed by HireArt and assigned to project-based work with Scale. This reduction was not a layoff and does not impact full-time Scale employees. Through HireArt, impacted contractors were given severance and offered COBRA coverage through the end of the month,” a Scale AI spokesperson said regarding the restructuring.\n\nApple, August 27, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 100 people.\n\nApple slashed nearly 100 roles in its digital services group, with the biggest cuts affecting the team responsible for its Apple Books app and Apple Bookstore, according to a Bloomberg News report on Tuesday. Though Apple declined to comment, the restructuring includes some engineering roles and other services teams like the one that runs Apple News, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. Amid its internal shift and focus on AI, Apple has been restructuring teams and priorities as it moves forward.\n\nIBM, August 26, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 1,000 people.\n\nIBM will completely eliminate its China-based R&D operation, impacting over 1,000 roles, according to Reuters. “These changes will not impact our ability to support clients across the Greater China region,” said an IBM spokesperson in a statement to Reuters confirming the cuts. The restructuring reportedly arrives amid IBM's struggles with slumping demand for its hardware and challenges in growth markets like China.\n\nTome Biosciences, August 26, 2024 announcement. Layoff of entire workforce.\n\nThe Genetic medicines startup is scaling back operations and laying off its entire 131-person staff amid financial struggles, according to BioPharma Dive. Tome said the impacted employees would lose their jobs by November, according to a Massachusetts state regulatory notice it filed. In an emailed statement to BioPharma Dive Friday, CEO Rahul Kakkar said Tome had scaled back operations and was in “ongoing confidential conversations with multiple parties.” In addition, Kakkar added: “Despite our clear scientific progress, investor sentiment has shifted dramatically across the gene editing space, particularly for preclinical companies.”\n\nKenko Health, August 23, 2024 announcement. Layoff of entire workforce.\n\nAfter running out of funds and failing to secure an insurance license from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), healthtech startup Kenko Health ended business operations, according to Inc42. Founder Aniruddha Sen announced the news to employees in an email. “Unfortunately, the company has run out of funds, and we were unable to infuse equity capital in time due to various internal reasons. Our company has been taken to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) by a debt fund that had extended a loan to us,” Sen wrote in the email. According to Kenko Health's LinkedIn profile, about 200 employees will be impacted by the shutdown.\n\nReceived, August 23, 2024 announcement. Layoff of entire workforce.\n\nThe New York-based billing and accounts receivable platform is shutting down business operations, according to Fintech Futures. In a LinkedIn post announcing the news, CEO Roi Ben Daniel said the team came to the decision “after realizing we’re not on the right growth trajectory.” Around 50 employees will be impacted by the shutdown, according to Received's LinkedIn profile.\n\nRedfin, August 22, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 82 people, 2% of workforce.\n\nIn an effort to regain its footing in a slumping housing market, the Seattle-based real estate company laid off 82 employees, according to GeekWire. The layoffs affected Redfin’s Concierge service, which helps homeowners improve their home’s appeal before putting it on the market. Support and sales managers within Redfin's real estate brokerage were also impacted by the layoffs. “As we hire more Redfin Next agents and our current agents become more entrepreneurial and self-sufficient, Redfin needs less support and managerial staff,” a spokesperson said in a statement obtained by GeekWire.\n\nKaiyo, August 21, 2024 announcement. Layoff of entire workforce.\n\nThe furniture resale platform is withholding customer funds as it prepares to shutdown business operations, according to The City. Customers reportedly received an email from Kaiyo that read: “Currently, Furnishare DBA Kaiyo is in the initial phase of doing an orderly wind down of the Company. Due to the current situation, we are not able to complete your payout at this time.” Customers will receive guidance on how to file a claim in the future, according to Kaiyo. The number of impacted employees remains unclear at this time.\n\nSkip the Dishes, August 20, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 800 people.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post on Tuesday, CEO Paul Burns announced Skip the Dishes is laying off 800 Canadian employees along with its parent company, according to CBC. The cuts will impact 100 Canada-based workers with Skip the Dishes, while 700 operations employees based out of Canada who work for its owner, Just Eat Takeaway.com, will also be laid off, Burns said. “Decisions that impact people’s jobs are never simple or easy, however the measures we took are necessary to ensure we have the right resources and organizational structure in place to drive sustainable growth. A more focused approach will also ensure we continue to provide an enhanced offering to customers and exceptional service to all our stakeholders,” Burns wrote in the post.\n\nFive9, August 20, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 190 people, 7% of workforce.\n\nThe San Ramon, Calif.-based contact center products vendor announced plans to reduce its workforce by 7%, according to CRN. CEO Mike Burkland revealed the restructuring plans in an email to employees that included a regulatory filing. The move is reportedly “part of the Company’s broader efforts to drive balanced, profitable growth, further supporting our positive, long-term outlook and focus on increasing shareholder value,” according to the filing. “Looking forward, Five9 is focused on driving shareholder value by increasing revenue, improving profitability, investing in our key strategic initiatives, and delivering for our customers. I have enormous confidence in Five9 and each of you as we continue to align and execute as one team,” Burkland wrote in the email. The cuts will impact around 190 employees.\n\nGoPro, August 19, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 139 people, 15% of workforce.\n\nOn Monday, the company known for making action cameras said it would layoff about 15% of its workforce this year, as part of a restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses, according to Reuters.

Layoff total unconfirmed.\n\nThe proptech company is ending business operations in the US, though its sister company Madlan will continue operating in Israel, according to Calcalist. The move was reportedly initiated in response to the crisis in the US real estate market, which has experienced two difficult years due to high interest rates and other factors.\n\nRegrow Ag, August 16, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 19% of workforce.\n\nThe agriculture resilience platform is laying off 19% of its workforce, according to a LinkedIn post from co-founder Anastasia Volkova announcing the cuts. The move appears to be in response to macroeconomic conditions, though specific factors leading to the decision have yet to be confirmed. “For our customers and the remaining team, I have no doubt we’ll achieve everything we intend to and more for the environment while transforming the food system for future generations,” Volkova wrote in the social media post.\n\nFormlabs, August 15, 2024 announcement. Layoff of around 40 people.\n\nThe 3D printing firm laid off a “small number” of employees in an effort to reach efficiency goals, according to TechCrunch. A spokesperson for Formlabs reportedly confirmed the cuts, adding that the layoffs occurred in waves over the past two years, and as recently as the last few weeks. “While we continue to grow revenue and lead in the additive manufacturing market, we occasionally must make the difficult decision to part ways with a small number of colleagues who are in departments that are below our efficiency goals and/or who are not in the right roles,” the spokesperson said in an exclusive statement to TechCrunch.\n\nMister Spex, August 15, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 130 people, 10% of workforce.\n\nThe German eyewear retailer initiated a restructuring program known as “SpexFocus” within the company, which means it will layoff 10% of its workforce and close all eight of its international branches, according to Business Insider.

As a result of the merger, ByteDance's Indonesian e-commerce business had about 5,000 employees. The cuts will reportedly impact e-commerce, advertising, and operations teams, which will be equal to about 9% of the arm’s employees. According to Bloomberg, ByteDance’s TikTok is grappling with a divest-or-ban law in the US. TikTok is also going through a restructuring effort after laying hundreds of employees in its marketing and operations teams globally last month, but the layoffs are not related to its legal and political troubles.\n\nPaytm, June 10, 2024 announcement. Layoff of 3,500 people.\n\nAmid an ongoing restructuring effort, Paytm laid off 3,500 employees in its sales division according to Mint.

Layoff of over 1,000 people.\n\nThe New York-based rideshare service is laying off more than 1,000 drivers to adopt a contractor model similar to Lyft and Uber, according to TechCrunch. Revel reportedly launched and now operates several EV charging stations across the five boroughs, in addition to starting an all-Tesla, all-employee ride-hail service, amid an effort to guarantee utilization. After successfully piloting its new model in Late February with 100 Revel drivers, the company has since decided to hire 100 more. “The reason we ran this pilot in the first place was just increasing feedback from our driver pool, as well as in our recruitment efforts,” Haley Rubinson, vice president of corporate affairs at Revel, said in a statement to TechCrunch. “The leading reason people didn’t want to join Revel was the lack of flexibility. Now there really is the opportunity to serve more of the city’s for-hire vehicle population.”\n\nThe updated model will reportedly take effect after September 12, which gives the current drivers on Revel’s payroll the option of staying on with the company as independent contractors moving forward. According to TechCrunch, drivers can sign up to rent from Revel’s fleet of Teslas for $10 per hour, which includes auto liability insurance, vehicle cleaning and maintenance and a full day of battery charging. The company is seeking ways to grow the business and offer riders an improved service without accumulating more assets, so Revel will open up the platform to drivers with their own EVs in 2025.\n\nOda, June 5, 2024 announcement.

In addition, Toshiba said it would relocate office functions from central Tokyo to Kawasaki, and target an operating profit margin of 10% in three years, according to Reuters.

The restructuring would reportedly cost the company $8 million to $9 million, including severance and benefits payments. In addition, Chief Commercial Officer T.J. Clark will be replaced as part of the move. “We believed the headwinds we were experiencing were beginning to ease, and kept a close eye on our targets.

The layoffs will also include ending relationships with the majority of its contract workers immediately. “Today, we stand at the crossroads of two realities: the core of our business has never been stronger across technology, product, industrialization, and commercialization; yet at the same time the capital markets perception of our company has never been more challenging,” Founder and CEO Austin Russell said in a letter to employees that was posted to Luminar’s website.

Layoff of 500 people.\n\nJust weeks after parting with 14,000 employees, or 10% of its global workforce, Tesla announced that it will layoff 500 more employees and several executives, according to The Information. The cuts will directly impact the majority its Supercharging team, including the departure of Rebecca Tinucci, Tesla’s senior director of EV charging, who oversaw the 500-person team. According to The Verge, Tinucci led the rollout of Tesla’s Supercharger network during her six-year tenure, which included efforts to get other companies to adopt to adopt the North American Charging Standard (NACS) developed by Tesla. In pursuit of taking over the EV charging space, Tesla announced that is was opening up its more reliable Supercharger stations and network to other automakers in November 2022. Ford, GM, Volkswagen Group, BMW, and several others were reportedly part of the roster set to adopt Tesla’s charging standard for their future EVs. However, that strategy appears to be taking a serious hit as a result of the layoffs.\n\nTesla's layoffs reportedly included Daniel Ho, a ten-year Tesla veteran who served as director of vehicle programs and new product initiatives, and as program manager for the Model S, 3, and Y vehicles. The team Ho led is also being cut as a result of the restructure.

Though Google did confirm the cuts to TechCrunch, it did not specify the teams, roles, or how many employees were impacted as a result of the move. This is the second round of layoffs in April that were initiated, and neither announcement arrived with a specific total of impacted employees. On April 17, Reuters reported cuts at Google that were made in an effort to trim costs.\n\nPrioritizing investments that can enable Google to capitalize on future opportunities appears to be the crux of the moves. “To best position us for these opportunities, throughout the second half of 2023 and into 2024, a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, remove layers, and align their resources to their biggest product priorities. Through this, we’re simplifying our structures to give employees more opportunity to work on our most innovative and important advances and our biggest company priorities, while reducing bureaucracy and layers,” said Google spokesperson Alex García-Kummert.\n\nReorganizations are part of Google's normal business model, but the company did confirm that the layoffs were not company-wide. According to TechCrunch, some of the layoffs at Google seem to have been confirmed in a WARN notice filed on April 24. WARN, or the California Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, requires employers with more than 100 employees to provide a 60-day notice in advance of layoffs.

While several official headcount details remain scarce, Getir did confirm 1,500 layoffs in the U.K. in an announcement shared with journalists. The layoffs will reportedly impact at least 1,100 employees in Germany, but that number could potentially settle closer to 1,800 cuts. In November 2023, Getir picked up 2,300 employees after it acquired FreshDirect in the U.S., but this number could also grow given Getir's activity in the U.S. prior to that acquisition.

A Google spokesperson reportedly said the layoffs are not company-wide and that affected employees will be able to apply for internal roles, though a headcount including the impacted teams was not confirmed. “Throughout the second half of 2023 and into 2024, a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, remove layers and align their resources to their biggest product priorities,” the spokesperson added.

Layoff of 614 people.\n\nBack on February 27, we reported that the tech giant is ending its extensive, but secretive autonomous EV project that included hundreds of layoffs, according to Bloomberg.

Bloomberg broke the story last night, which included smartwatch projects as new wrinkle in the restructure.\n\nIts EV project was canned because of indecision among executives about budgeting and overall direction, while the display project ended due to engineering, supplier and financial hurdles. 371 employees were reportedly released at Apple’s main car-related office in Santa Clara, California, which included dozens more at several satellite offices. However, an Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the number of employees affected by the job cuts.\n\nLightspeed Commerce, April 3, 2024 announcement.

In addition, its physical stores technology teams will be impacted by the move. According to the report, Amazon said it’s shifting its focus to self-serve digital training and training programs run by external partners. “The changes we are making are preparing the organization for the future, aligning with our strategy and priorities, and reducing duplication and inefficiency,” wrote SVP Matt Garman in a statement obtained by GeekWire. While the cuts will impact global operations, the heaviest concentration of AWS roles reside in Amazon’s hometown, which means that the decision is likely to have a disproportionate impact on the company’s Seattle workforce.\n\nGhost Autonomy, April 3, 2024 announcement.
