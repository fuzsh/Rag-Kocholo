        "text": "India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has hailed Monday’s consecration ceremony as “the beginning of a new time cycle” in a speech to thousands of guests outside temple’s complex.\n\nMinutes before his speech, Modi broke an 11-day religious fast that he had undertaken to prepare for the festivities. He unveiled a statue of Lord Ram, one of Hinduism’s most revered deities, in a consecration ceremony watched by millions.\n\nModi did not directly mention the Babri Masjid in his speech, nor the country’s Muslims, many of whom feel pain and sadness at the events that have unfolded in Ayodhya.\n\nThe chief minister of Uttar Pradesh state, where Ayodhya is located, has called the Ram Mandir India’s “national temple” and one that celebrates the country’s “pride.”\n\nAdityanath has governed India’s most populous state since 2017, when the Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) appointed him leader after claiming victory in state polls that year.\n\nBut the appointment of Adityanath, a Hindu priest, indicated to some experts that it was yet another sign of the BJP’s Hindutva ideology – which strives to make secular India the land of the Hindus.\n\nAdityanath has since become one of the country’s more polarizing political figures.\n\nSince he took office, the state has already passed legislation that, critics say, is rooted in Hindutva ideology. It has protected cows, an animal considered sacred to Hindus, from slaughter, and made it increasingly difficult to transport cattle.\n\nAdityanath has been a vocal advocate for the construction of the Ram Temple and attended the consecration ceremony inside the building.\n\nMeanwhile, the chief of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the right-wing parent organization of the BJP, declared the temple “has become a symbol of a new India that will stand tall.”\n\nIndian news channels have devoted a tremendous amount of time to cover every detail about the Ram Temple, from counting the number of sweets that are being made in celebration, to documenting all the religious events that have preceded its inauguration.\n\nThe front page of the country’s leading newspapers on Monday were dedicated to the temple’s opening.\n\n“Long wait ends, Ayodhya in euphoria on eve of new dawn,” the Times of India said.\n\nThe Indian Express said: “Ayodhya wears festive look. Stage set for Ram Temple consecration today.”\n\nNews anchors meanwhile are in the ancient city, interviewing crowds, filming the festivities and speaking with politicians ahead of the event.\n\nAyodhya, an ancient town of about 76,000 people in the electorally significant state of Uttar Pradesh, is an important Hindu pilgrimage site and sees millions of visitors each year.\n\nThe town has recently undergone a large infrastructural makeover, including the construction of a new international airport, renovation of the railway station and the opening of new roads and highways.\n\nSome of the city’s historic and religious sites have also been restored, according to local media reports, while new hotels, food courts and multi-storey carparks scattered throughout the city.\n\nSome leaders within Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party have called Ayodhya India’s “Vatican City,” vying to make it the religious capital of the country.\n\nAnalysts say Uttar Pradesh’s BJP chief minister, the hardline Hindu monk Yogi Adityanath, has relied on a mixed strategy of economic reform and religious polarization to attract votes.\n\nAt the same time he has implemented policies that critics say favor Hindus and discriminate against minorities, particularly Muslims.\n\nA statue of one of Hinduism’s most revered deities has been consecrated at a new temple in an historic and controversial ceremony that was presided over by by India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nThe idol of Lord Ram was unveiled at the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir on the site of a 16th century mosque that was demolished by Hindu hardliners in 1992.\n\nDepicted as a young boy, the statue of black stone was adorned with gold jewelry, gemstones, diamonds and flowers. Modi placed offerings at the idol’s feet as priests chanted and prayed.\n\nAt the climax of the consecration a military helicopter flew over the temple, throwing flower petals over the vast building and the crowds of dignitaries below.\n\nThe temple in Ayodhya is the crowning glory of Modi’s Hindu nationalist ambition and is expected to boost his credentials in this year’s election.\n\nMonday’s ceremony was attended by famous celebrities, politicians and industrialists, who flew across India to witness the event.\n\nRam (also known as Rama) is one of the most important gods in the Hindu pantheon, a figure revered for his heroic deeds, virtue and chivalry. An avatar of Vishnu, he is especially well known for being the central character in the epic poem the Ramayana.\n\nMuch like Homer’s Odyssey, the Ramayana recounts Ram spending years in the wilderness trying to make his way home and claim his rightful role after being exiled.\n\nAlong the way he meets his wife Sita who is kidnapped by the demon king Ravana. With the help of his brother Lakshmana and the monkey god Hanuman, Ram defeats Ravana and rescues Sita.\n\nThe couple’s triumphant return to Ayodhya – and the victory of good over evil – is celebrated each year during the Diwali festival of lights.\n\nAn idol of Lord Ram, one of Hinduism’s most revered deities, will be unveiled inside the sanctum sanctorum of the temple, in consecration ceremony conducted by Modi and broadcast to millions.\n\nMore than 7,000 people have been invited to attend the ceremony in person, including high-profile politicians who are flying in from across the vast country to take part.\n\nSome 100 chartered planes are expected to land in Ayodhya on Monday, with hotel prices surging and last-minute bookings costing upwards of $1,200 per day, according to local media reports.\n\nGifts have been arriving in Ayodhya from artists and jewelers ahead of the inauguration, including a 2,100 kg (about 4,630 lbs) gold bell, a giant lamp weighing 1,100 kg (about 2,425 lbs), and an incense stick 108 feet long which will burn for more than a month.\n\nSince January 16, priests have been conducting prayers and performing rituals as workers move the idol into the temple’s complex. Senior leaders of the BJP have given numerous television interviews about the events, with Indian news channels running 24/7 coverage about the temple’s festivities.\n\nAhead of the event, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been fasting and praying in an 11-day ritual steeped in Hindu religious symbolism.\n\nWhile announcing his decision to undertake the religious ritual, Modi said: “The Lord has made me an instrument to represent all the people of India during the consecration.”\n\n“I seek blessings from all of you,” he added.\n\nModi’s embrace of Hindu religious ceremonies while in government is significant because India was founded by figures like Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru to be a deliberately diverse but secular nation where all religions were equal under the law.\n\nModi rose to power in 2014 with a pledge to reform the country’s economy and usher in a new era of development – but throughout his political career he also heavily pushed a Hindutva agenda, an ideology that believes India should become a land for Hindus.\n\nWhile in power, Modi’s party rallied to build the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya in another promise to his core voters, a move seen by many as favoring the country’s Hindu majority.\n\nMonday’s temple’s opening is widely expected to boost his chances of winning a rare third term in a general election expected later this year, having made true on his promise to millions of voters.\n\nIndia’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is preparing to inaugurate a vast Hindu temple on the site of a 16th century mosque that was demolished by a large crowd of Hindu hardliners in 1992.\n\nThe controversial ceremony at the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir in Ayodhya, expected to be attended by thousands of dignitaries, is a crowing moment for Modi’s Hindu nationalist ambitions as he seeks to win a rare third term in just a few months time.\n\nBut for many of the country’s Muslims, the temple’s inauguration is a painful reminder of the religious divisions that they fear are deepening in India as Modi pulls the country away from its secular foundations.\n\nHere’s what you need to know:\n\nThe controversy: The site of the temple was once home to the Babri Masjid, a 16th century mosque, built during Mughal rule. But many Hindus believe the mosque was built on the ruins of a Hindu temple, allegedly destroyed by Babar, the first Mughal emperor of South Asia. In 1992, spurred on by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and other right-wing groups, Hindu hardliners attacked the mosque with hammers, triggering widespread communal violence that killed more than 2,000 nationwide. India’s Supreme Court in 2019 granted Hindus permission to build the temple on the contested site, ending the dispute. It was seen as a victory for Modi and his supporters but was a blow to many Muslims for whom the destruction of the Babri Masjid remains a source of deep tension and loss.\n\nThe unveiling of a new idol: An idol of Lord Ram, one of Hinduism’s most revered deities, will be unveiled inside the sanctum sanctorum of the temple, during the during the Pran Pratishtha or consecration ceremony presided over by Modi and broadcast to millions. More than 7,000 people have been invited to attend the ceremony in person, including many high-profile politicians and celebrities who are flying in from across the vast country to take part.\n\nPain and anxiety among India’s Muslims: Ayodhya is home to some 3 million people, including about 500,000 Muslims – and some of them are fearful of attacks on the day of the temple’s inauguration. As crowds arrive for the ceremonies, there is apprehension among Ayodhya’s Muslims, who fear a repeat of 1992’s violence. Many have shared messages of support to one another on social media, with WhatsApp messages urging the community to refrain from traveling on public trains and buses for their own safety.\n\nTens of thousands of pious Hindus are thronging the small town of Ayodhya in a bid to catch a glimpse of the much-anticipated Ram idol in the new temple.\n\nThe temple doesn’t open to the public until Tuesday but it is expected to draw vast crowds once that happens.\n\nAmong those who made the journey is 90-year-old Urmila Chandravanshi, who has traveled more than 700 kilometers from the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh.\n\nClapping and chanting “victory to Lord Ram,” she said she was thrilled to be in Ayodhya and credits Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the opening of the temple.\n\nSaffron flags are flying high and marigold flowers adorn building entrances as groups make their way through the streets of the ancient town.\n\nDasharath Singh Rajput, who has also traveled from Chhattisgarh, applauded Modi for undertaking his 11-day religious ritual.\n\nDressed in a large coat with a saffron shawl draped around his neck, a color associated with Hinduism, he praised Modi for his politics.\n\nAnother devotee, Anupawananda Swami, 86, called the temple’s opening a “grand success” and said he was happy that Modi has been building temples around India.\n\nThe site of the temple was once home to the Babri Masjid, a 16th century mosque, built by the Mughal empire that ruled India from 1526 to 1858.\n\nBut the location has been disputed for decades.\n\nMany Hindus believe the Babri Masjid was built on the ruins of a Hindu temple, allegedly destroyed by Babar, the first Mughal emperor of South Asia. The site is significant to them because they believe it’s the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of Hinduism’s most important deities.\n\nHindu nationalist groups had for years campaigned to demolish the mosque to build a temple in its place. In 1992, spurred on by the BJP and other right-wing groups, Hindu hardliners attacked it with hammers, triggering widespread communal violence.\n\nDozens of temples and mosques were also targeted in a series of revenge attacks that killed more than 2,000 people nationwide. The violence was some of worst seen in India since the bloody clashes that accompanied partition following independence in 1947.\n\nIn the following years, Hindu nationalists rallied to build the Ram Mandir on the site of the destroyed mosque, setting the stage for an emotional and politically charged showdown that lasted decades.\n\nIn 2019, India’s Supreme Court granted Hindus permission to build the temple on the contested site, ending the dispute.\n\nIt was seen as a victory for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his supporters but was a blow to many Muslims for whom the destruction of the Babri Masjid remains a source of tension and an example of how India’s centuries of Islamic history is being eroded by Hindu nationalist revisionism.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court delivered its verdict, Modi said the decision had “brought a new dawn” for the nation and would lead to the “creation of a new India.”\n\nBut critics say the verdict tore India away from the secular founding principles and that the building of the temple in Ayodhya is the crowning achievement in the BJP’s multi-decade campaign to transform the country.\n\nThe 2019 Supreme Court order that paved the way for the construction of the Ram temple also said authorities must set aside land for a mosque to be built about 25 kilometers (15 miles) away.\n\nBut construction of the mosque is not expected to begin until May, and Ayodhya’s Muslims continue to feel a sense of hopelessness.\n\nSaffron flags are flying in the majority Hindu town of Aydohya as excited locals prepare to host Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the inauguration of a new multimillion dollar temple.\n\nBut like many of the town’s 500,000 Muslims, 65-year-old Maulana Badshah Khan says he’ll be staying at home.\n\nHe fears a repeat of the religious violence that erupted more than 30 years ago, when Hindu nationalists destroyed the Babri Masjid, a 16th century mosque, triggering riots across the country.\n\nOn Monday, Modi will officially open the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir, a lavish temple built on the same site that analysts say is a monument to Hindu nationalist ambition.\n\nKhan says he believes the celebration is a clear sign of how Muslims is becoming marginalized under the leadership of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\n“The wounds of Babri Mosque’s demolition will always be there. Even if we feel despondent about voicing them,” said Khan.\n\n“The temple holds the symbolic value of showing the Muslims their place in New India.”\n\nRead more here:\n\nThe BJP’s main opposition, the Indian National Congress, has announced it will boycott the inauguration, claiming the event is being politicized by the BJP.\n\nResponding to the Congress’ decision to miss the ceremony, BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi told reporters it was driven by “jealousy, malice and inferiority complex towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” adding that the party is opposing the “country” and “god.”\n\nSome prominent Muslim lawmakers have also criticized the inauguration of the temple, lamenting the loss of the Babri mosque where their ancestors recited the Quran hundreds of years ago.\n\n“Young people, we have lost our Masjid (mosque) and you are seeing what is being done there,” said Asaduddin Owaisi, chief of the All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen political party, to his followers during a speech earlier this month. “Don’t you have pain in your hearts?”"
