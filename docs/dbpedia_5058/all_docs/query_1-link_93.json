A paradisiacal beach perfect for disconnecting and relaxing in the shade of its palm trees or for practicing a wide range of activities.\n\nAlthough the main attraction of Punta Cana is enjoying its idyllic beaches at one of its all-inclusive resorts, there are several places that are worth a visit. To the south of the Samaná peninsula, the Los Haitises National Park is characterized by its \"mogotes\", small elevations 30 or 40 meters high. It is a true jewel of nature where you can admire mangroves, tropical birds, manatees or discover caves adorned with pre-Columbian cave paintings.\n\nAnother must-see place is the Ojos Indígenas ecological reserve, made up of more than 1,483 acres of tropical forests and twelve freshwater lagoons, and the Seaquarium on Punta de los Nidos Beach, where you can interact with sea lions, sharks, and rays. Saona Island, the largest island in the Dominican Republic, is also worth a visit, a true paradise surrounded by idyllic beaches where you can disconnect from your daily routine.\n\nPunta Cana beaches\n\nBávaro Beach with direct access from the hotel - 800 m\n\nLos Corales Beach - 5,6 km\n\nEl Cortecito Beach 5 mi\n\nCabeza de Toro 8 mi\n\nJuanillo Beach 16 mi\n\nArena Gorda Beach 8.5 mi\n\nMacao Beach 13 mi\n\nPlaces of interest in Punta Cana\n\nThe Lakes Golf Course - 300 m\n\nKathmandu Park Amusement Park 8 mi\n\nManatí Park - 9.6 km\n\nIndigenous Eyes Ecological Reserve 14 mi\n\nBlue Hole 18 mi\n\nLos Haitises National Park 96 mi\n\nSanto Domino 128 mi\n\nSaona Island\n\nDirections\n\nPunta Cana International Airport 18 km away\n\nLa Romana International Airport - 81.4 km\n\nLas Americas International Airport - 181 km\n\nWhy choose the Barceló Bávaro Palace Hotel?\n\nThe most complete hotel in Punta Cana\n\nLocation\n\nSports facilities\n\nMeetings and Events\n\nIdeal for families and children\n\nSpa and Wellness\n\nCuisine\n\nThe Barceló Bávaro Palace is located near Playa Bávaro, one of the most charming beaches in Punta Cana.\n\nFor sports lovers, the Barceló Bávaro Palace has complete facilities where you can practice golf, soccer, baseball, as well as numerous water sports.\n\nThis luxury hotel in Punta Cana offers the perfect setting for celebrating weddings and has a personalized wedding planner service.
