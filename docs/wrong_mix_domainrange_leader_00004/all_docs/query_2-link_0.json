        "text": "On 20 November 1975, General Francisco Franco, Spain's dictator for almost forty years, died after a long agony. In the final days of his autumn, the old patriarch is believed to have sighed for the end, saying: ‘It is so difficult to die’.Footnote 1 Franco was succeeded by Prince Juan Carlos, grandson of the last Bourbon King of Spain, Alfonso XIII. Juan Carlos and his entourage began a delicate process of stealth reformism that brought down the dictatorship from within and restored democracy to Spain. Traditionally Spain's transition to democracy (1975–8) has been studied from the point of view of the elite orchestrating the process.Footnote 2 Classic historiography focuses mainly on Juan Carlos I, Torcuato Fernández-Miranda and Adolfo Suárez. From this central triad of study have diverged other histories also focused on ‘political figures’ such as Manuel Fraga, Alfonso Osorio or communist leader Santiago Carrillo.Footnote 3 In terms of methodologies, these histories were crafted largely taking account of politicians’ memoirs, on their recollection of events. Perhaps the most illustrative example of this is journalist Victoria Prego's Así se hizo la transición (1997), a chronicle of the process based on extensive interviews with the people in power at the time.\n\nOne of the main criticisms to this type of history is that it has made the history of the elites tantamount to the history of the regime change process, something which neglects the role of non-elite actors and non-individual actors. New historiographical trends have tried to reverse this by widening the methodological lens, focusing on the study of the transition's forces profondes, such as terrorism, international re-alignment and transnational socio-political movements.Footnote 4 One of the most interesting examples of this new scholarship is Charles Powell's analysis of the transition as part of Samuel Huntington's third wave of democratisation.Footnote 5 Another perspective is that of historical memory: in past years, historians have argued that Spanish transition was a manoeuvre by the elite and for the elite, and that due to this tacit ‘pact of forgetting’ (pacto de olvido) Spain did not experience post-dictatorship intergenerational justice like Argentina or Chile.Footnote 6\n\nThis article returns to the traditional study of the political figure, focusing on Miguel Primo de Rivera y Urquijo (1934–2018), third duke of Primo de Rivera, thanks to the unprecedented access to his personal archive.Footnote 7 Returning to this traditional approach, this article will provide a new perspective on the transition ‘from above’ and will further illustrate the role of the elite in promoting regime change. Whilst acknowledging that the transition did not only take place because of the elite's will but also due to a combination of social, economic and political events, it seeks to bring into the light the role of an individual who was central to the process but who, nonetheless, has not been widely considered by the scholarship. The case of Primo, furthermore, provides an insight into the actual democratic conviction of one of the key figures of the transition, refuting existing accounts about his last-minute opportunistic support for democratic transition.\n\nPrimo de Rivera belonged to an important family of the Franco regime. His uncle, José Antonio Primo de Rivera (1903–36), had founded the fascist party Falange Española in 1932 on which Franco had later built his own heterogenous Movimiento Nacional. Republicans rid Franco of a charismatic political rival by murdering José Antonio in 1936, but the dictator still used the powerful imagery of the martyred Falange leader to bind together the different ideological factions (fascists, Carlists, conservatives) within his Movimiento. The Primo de Rivera family played a key role in Franco's propaganda, representing a sort of blood alliance between two ideological elements (Franco's military conservatism and José Antonio's interwar fascism) which were actually at loggerheads.Footnote 8\n\nPrimo served as mayor of Jerez de la Frontera (1965–71), procurador [MP] at the Cortes (1965–77), member of the Council of the Movimiento Nacional (1971–7), member of the Council of the Realm (1971–7) and senator by royal appointment (1977–9), but he is best remembered for his role in passing the Political Reform Act (November 1976), which brought the regime to a juridical end and called for democratic elections. It was shocking that a Primo de Rivera supported the institutional suicide of the regime; in the words of Ignacio Sánchez-Cuenca, it was ‘fascinating and paradigmatic’.Footnote 9 However, this defence of democracy is not something that has attracted significant scholarly attention. Primo is often mentioned only in generalist accounts of the transition for anecdotal purposes – he was Don Juan Carlos's long-time friend and his memoirs constitute a rich source of stories.Footnote 10 His political role in the transition remains largely unstudied. A notable exception is Tom Burns, who in his study of Juan Carlos's early reign did point to the crucial role of Primo, whom he argued had used his influence on the Francoist entourages to ensure ‘Juan Carlos's ascension to the throne, the transformation of the Francoist regime and the consolidation of the monarchy’.Footnote 11 Nonetheless, even though Burns reveals more about Primo's role than other Hispanists, his account still lacks a detailed analysis of Primo's politics and actions during the transition.\n\nGenerally, historians have failed to nuance and contextualise Primo's role, merely explaining his actions with regards to a broader political and personal context.Footnote 12 The only biography of Primo, Del Franquismo a la Reforma (2019) by Spanish historian Manuel Ruiz Romero, is largely based on Primo's tenure as mayor of Jerez, using the city's archives. For his role in the transition, Ruiz Romero, just like Sánchez-Cuenca, relied on Primo's memoirs, No a las dos Españas, published in 2002. Seldom do memoirs provide a full account of events. No author can overcome the natural limits of human memory or escape the temptation to revendicate or justify past actions. Primo is no exception. His memoirs were published twenty-five years after the transition and at a complicated time for the author: in the long wilderness of the Socialist government (1982–96), he fell into oblivion and it is well known that one of his great friends, the king, did not bring him back from it. (Whether Don Juan Carlos could do so or not is a different question, but already in 1978 Primo noted that he was beginning to suffer ‘in my own flesh . . . the rather common ups and downs of His Majesty towards those loyal to him’).Footnote 13\n\nThere are few documents to refute the claims made in No a las dos Españas; Ruiz Romero recognised that this lack of ‘new historiographical elements’ makes it difficult to nuance Primo's political role and intellectual relationship with Falangism and democracy.Footnote 14 This might be the reason why his conclusions are very similar to other historians’. He presents Primo as a pragmatist reformer, a man who ‘progressively distanced himself from the more orthodox sectors’ and sought to navigate ‘an intermediary way’ between radical reformists (rupturistas) and Franco devotees.Footnote 15 This is more or less the same portrayal that Primo made of himself in his memoirs, the one which other historians have stuck to. Julio Gil Pecharromán, for example, interpreted Primo as a ‘blue reformist’ (reformista azul) – a young member of the regime who believed promoting democratisation was the only chance of taking political power from the hands of the previous generation of leaders.Footnote 16\n\nThus whilst the role of Primo in the transition is known to Spanish historians, the details of his politics and the evolution of his political thought remain unstudied. This article seeks to fill in this gap by interrogating Primo's personal private papers, to which the Primo de Rivera family has allowed access for the first time. The archive includes several folders (going back to 1964) containing handwritten notes (sometimes scribbled on the back of official papers), personal diary entries and written reflections, letters that have not seen the light of day until now, and even newspaper clippings with underlined paragraphs – which give a sense of what Primo was interested in. This brings forth a new body of sources to contextualise Primo's role in the transition and reveal new details about his political trajectory and the evolution of his political convictions. This article will thus seek to answer the following questions: what was the role of Primo in securing the transition from above? What do Primo's papers illustrate about the complicated relationship between Juancarlist reformists and the Francoist high echelons from 1969 onwards?\n\nAs it will be seen in this article, these sources reveal that from the beginning of his political career in the 1960s, Primo clashed with the world of the Falange and supported the restoration of democracy through the succession of Prince Juan Carlos. This rupture with Falangism and early support for Juan Carlos, as well as his actions in the key years of the transition (1975–6), show that he had always supported and worked towards a transition and that he was not a ‘possibilist’, as Ruiz Romero and Gil Pecharromán assumed, nor part of what Ángel Ruiz Carnicer argued was a group of young Franco devotees who claimed in their memoirs to have been ‘democrats avant la lettre’. Sánchez Cuenca too follows this argument about Primo being a Falangist who, writing in democratic times, attempted to ‘rationalise his past’, presenting himself as a long-time committed democrat.Footnote 17\n\nIn order to show this evolution, this article first explores Primo's relation with the world of the Falange in the 1960s, as well as the clashes he had with two of the Falange's most important factions. The second section analyses his manoeuvres within the high echelons of the regime to support Juan Carlos before and after his designation as heir in 1969. The third section traces the details of Primo's role in the dismantling of Francoist institutions in 1975–6, focusing on his time as member the Council of the Realm and his role in designating Adolfo Suárez as prime minister. As will be seen, Primo's support for the transition was not an opportunistic turn happening after Franco's death, but rather a long-thought-out and long-envisioned political plan."
