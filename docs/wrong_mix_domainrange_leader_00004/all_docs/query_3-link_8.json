        "text": "Rulers\n\nIndex Ro-Rz\n\nRo Jai Bong (b. Feb. 8, 1936 - d. April 23, 2024, Seoul, South Korea), prime minister of South Korea (1990-91).\n\nRoa, Jorge (b. April 23, 1858, Cali, Colombia - d. Nov. 30, 1927, Madrid, Spain), war minister (1909 [acting], 1918-21) and interior minister (1910-11) of Colombia. He was also minister to Spain (1927).\n\nRoa García\n\nRoa García, Raúl (b. April 18, 1907, Havana, Cuba - d. July 6, 1982, Havana), Cuban government official. He entered the political arena when he was elected a member of the students directorate in 1930; he was jailed in 1931 for anti-government activities and in 1933 joined the revolt (led by Fulgencio Batista) that overthrew the government of Gerardo Machado. After participating in a failed general strike against the Batista government, Roa fled to the U.S. and organized a Cuban revolutionary association. From 1948 to 1952 Roa served as director of culture for the Cuban government. With the return to power of Batista in 1952, Roa went into exile. After the 1959 revolution Fidel Castro named Roa foreign minister, a post he held until 1976. In this position he promoted a Cuban-Soviet alliance and, despite his contempt for U.S. policy, played a major role in negotiating two important agreements between Cuba and the U.S. The first accord in 1965 sanctioned the airlifting of Cuban emigrants to the U.S. In 1973 the countries signed an anti-hijacking agreement that permitted both countries to prosecute air and sea pirates where they landed for theft, illegal entry, or other crimes. Roa served as vice-president of the National Assembly and member of the Council of State until 1981.\n\nRoa Kourí, Raúl (b. July 9, 1936, Havana, Cuba), Cuban diplomat; son of Raúl Roa García. He was ambassador to Czechoslovakia (1961-63), Brazil (1963-64), France (1994-98), and the Vatican (2005-09) and permanent representative to the United Nations (1978-84).\n\nRoane, Archibald (b. 1759, Derry Township, Lancaster county, Pennsylvania - d. Jan. 4, 1819, Grassy Valley, near Knoxville, Tenn.), governor of Tennessee (1801-03).\n\nRoane, John S(elden) (b. Jan. 8, 1817, Wilson county, Tenn. - d.

A one-time leader of the Union of Young Communists, he went on to be a member of the Communist Party's Politburo and was considered at one stage to be a possible successor to Fidel Castro. But Castro, in a move that surprised many international observers, dismissed Robaina as foreign minister in 1999 after he had served six years in the post. The government said at the time only that there was a need for \"deeper, more rigorous, more systematic and demanding work in this area.\" Robaina then disappeared from public view and authorities never gave further details on why he had fallen from grace, until in 2002 he was expelled from the Communist Party for being \"disloyal to the revolution.\" It was explained that while he was foreign minister, he had unauthorized contacts with foreign officials and businessmen, and made unauthorized statements abroad. He was also criticized for making statements at home and abroad implying he might be in line for Cuba's presidency one day.\n\nRobalino (Gonzaga), César (Raúl) (b. Aug. 2, 1936, Guayaquil, Ecuador), finance minister of Ecuador (1976, 1981-82, 1993-94). He was also minister of natural resources and energy (1980-81).\n\nRobarts\n\nRobarts, John Parmenter (b.

He was elected leader of the Ontario Conservative Party in 1961 and served as the formidable premier of Ontario from 1961 to 1971. During his administration, Robarts used his common sense to preserve calm and balance. He was particularly dedicated in his approach to English-French relations and in helping to unite French Canada. Robarts became a legendary figure in Canada after serving as the levelheaded co-chairman of the 1977 Task Force on Canadian Unity. Deeply disturbed over the physical disabilities he suffered as a result of a stroke in 1981, Robarts took his life.\n\nRobati\n\nRobati, Sir Pupuke (b. April 9, 1925, Rakahanga island, Cook Islands - d. April 26, 2009, Auckland, New Zealand), Cook Islands politician. He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly in 1965.

During fighting with the Dey and Golah tribes, he became one of Buchanan's most efficient leaders and helped reduce the more threatening natives to submission. He then made efforts to improve relations with the natives and, after Buchanan died, he was appointed the first black governor of the colony. Although the colony of Maryland was not a part of Liberia until 1857, its governor, John Russwurm, gave Roberts full cooperation. The need for larger revenues made them decide to lay import duties on goods brought to Liberia, but this precipitated international difficulties as Liberia was not a sovereign country, nor a recognized colony of the United States. A visit to the U.S. by Roberts in 1844 brought no result. In 1847 he called a conference at which the new republic of Liberia of proclaimed; Roberts was elected the first president (reelected in 1849, 1851, and 1853). In 1849, during a visit to England, he secured British recognition of Liberia as an independent nation and signed a commercial treaty; later he visited France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Prussia and obtained further recognition of Liberia. From 1856 to his death he served as president of the new Liberia College. When Liberia came near to revolution during a financial crisis with regard to a British loan, he was again elected president in 1871 and reelected in 1873.\n\nRoberts, Oran M(ilo) (b.

Feb. 11, 1888, Abingdon, Va.), governor of Virginia (1836-37); brother of Thomas B. Robertson.\n\nRobertson of Oakridge, Brian Hubert Robertson, (1st) Baron, (2nd) Baronet (b. July 22, 1896, Simla [now Shimla, Himachal Pradesh], India - d. April 29, 1974, Far Oakridge, Gloucestershire, England), military governor (1947-49) and high commissioner (1949-50) of the British zone of Germany. He succeeded as baronet in 1933 and was created baron in 1961.\n\nRobertson of P.E.\n\nRobertson of Port Ellen, George (Islay Macneill) Robertson, Baron (b. April 12, 1946, Port Ellen, Islay island, Hebrides, Scotland), secretary-general of NATO (1999-2003). He was elected chairman of the Scottish Labour Party aged 29, and a year later won the parliamentary seat of Hamilton in a by-election. He was elected Britain's parliamentarian of the year in 1993 for his role in forcing the then conservative government into holding a national referendum over the Maastricht Treaty, the blueprint for Europe's single currency project. Ironically the man later to head Britain's armed forces pioneered the campaign to ban high-calibre pistols in Britain after a teacher and 16 children were massacred in the Scottish town of Dunblane in March 1996. He became defense secretary when Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labour Party swept to power in 1997. In 1999 Robertson became a familiar face during NATO's bombing campaign of Yugoslavia and emerged as leading contender for the post of NATO secretary-general. On Aug. 24, 1999, he received a life peerage; earlier in the month he was appointed to the NATO post, which he took up in October. During his watch, the alliance invoked its mutual defense clause for the first time since it was founded in 1949, when the allies immediately agreed that the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States were an attack on them all and offered the U.S. military help. Although the United States did not immediately call on alliance assistance with the war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban, NATO eventually did send forces to Afghanistan in August 2003. The 5,700-strong peacekeeping operation was NATO's first deployment outside Europe. Earlier in 2003 there was a crisis of alliance unity over the U.S.-led war in Iraq, which was opposed by France, Germany, and Belgium.\n\nRobespierre\n\nRobespierre, Maximilien (Marie Isidore de)1 (b. May 6, 1758, Arras, France - d. July 28, 1794, Paris, France), French politician. As a lawyer representing poor people, he already protested against royal absolutism and arbitrary justice. When the summoning of the Estates-General (which had not been called since 1614) was announced in 1788, he issued an appeal entitled \"To the people of Artois on the necessity of reforming the Estates of Artois.\" In March 1789 the citizens of Arras chose him as one of their representatives, and the Third Estate (the commons) of Artois elected him as the fifth of eight deputies from the province. He played a conspicuous role in the National Assembly that quickly replaced the Estates General, but he was kept out of the committees and from the presidency of the National Assembly (being elected as secretary only once, in June 1790). His passionate fight for liberty won him many enemies. After the National Assembly disbanded in 1791, he became the acknowledged leader of the Jacobin Club. On Sept. 5, 1792, the people of Paris elected him to head the delegation to the National Convention. He served twice as its president (August-September 1793, June 1794). At Louis XVI's trial, which began in December 1792, he spoke 11 times and successfully demanded the king's execution. On July 27, 1793, he became a member of the Committee of Public Safety, where his power and prestige grew. The committee inaugurated the Reign of Terror, by which both the extreme left, under Jacques Hébert, and the moderates, led by Georges Danton and Camille Desmoulins, were in turn arrested and guillotined (March-April 1794). When he seemed to threaten further purges in a speech, the Convention on July 27, 1794, ordered his arrest and he was summarily tried and guillotined.\n\n1 While his baptismal names appear to be only Maximilien Marie Isidore, some sources have Maximilien François Marie Isidore Joseph, which may be erroneous.\n\nH.J. Robichaud\n\nRobichaud, Hédard Joseph (b. Nov. 12, 1911, Shippagan, N.B. - d. Aug. 16, 1999), lieutenant governor of New Brunswick (1971-81). He was the first Acadian in the post.\n\nL.J. Robichaud\n\nRobichaud, Louis J(oseph) (b. Oct. 21, 1925, Saint-Antoine, N.B. - d. Jan. 6, 2005, near Saint-Antoine), premier of New Brunswick (1960-70). At the age of 27, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly and he became leader of the Liberal Party in October 1958. He became New Brunswick's first Acadian premier since Peter John Veniot in the 1920s, and the first to win an election. At a time when rural municipal and county governments in the Acadian north provided substandard services in everything from education to health care, teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, he created the controversial Equal Opportunity Program, changing the entire tax and social structures of the province, bringing responsibility for education, hospital services, welfare, and justice under the wing of the provincial government, ensuring that all New Brunswickers had equal access to these services. Known as \"Little Louis\" to many New Brunswickers because of his short stature, he is perhaps best known for introducing the province's Official Languages Act, which made New Brunswick Canada's only officially bilingual province. After a decade in power, his government was defeated in the 1970 election by the Conservatives led by Richard B. Hatfield. Robichaud resigned his seat shortly after. He was a member of the Senate from 1973 to 2000.\n\nRobie, Frederick (b. Aug. 12, 1822, Gorham, Maine - d. Feb. 3, 1912, Gorham), governor of Maine (1883-87); grandnephew of Enoch Lincoln and Levi Lincoln, Jr.\n\nRobin, Denis (b. Dec. 15, 1962, Romans, Drôme, France), prefect of Mayotte (2008-09).

June 25, 1967, Brignoles, Var, France), prefect of Martinique (2017-20). He has also been prefect of the départements of Corse-du-Sud (2020) and Côte-d'Or (2022- ).\n\nRobins, Charles A(rmington) (b. Dec. 8, 1884, Defiance, Iowa - d. Sept. 20, 1970, Lewiston, Idaho), governor of Idaho (1947-51).\n\nA.N.R. Robinson\n\nRobinson, A(rthur) N(apoleon) R(aymond) (b. Dec. 16, 1926, Calder Hall, Tobago, Trinidad and Tobago - d. April 9, 2014, Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago), president of Trinidad and Tobago (1997-2003). His political career began as a representative in the Federation of the West Indies (1958-61). He then served as finance minister in 1961-67, deputy leader of the People's National Movement (PNM) in 1967-70, and foreign minister in 1967-70 under the centrist PNM administration of Eric Williams. After the Black Power riots of 1970 he distanced himself from the PNM, becoming leader of the new Democratic Action Congress (1971-86) and chairman of the newly created Tobago House of Assembly (1980-86). As leader of the National Alliance for Reconstruction (NAR), formed in 1985 to bring together a number of left-wing parties, he won a landslide victory in the 1986 elections, ending 30 years of dominance by the PNM and becoming prime minister with portfolios for the economy and Tobago. With oil prices falling, the economy became depressed, putting a strain on the disparate NAR, which began to fracture. In April 1990 the currency was devalued and IMF financial assistance sought. He survived a coup attempt on July 27, 1990, when a group of armed black Muslims stormed the parliament building, holding him and several government ministers hostage for six days. He was shot in the legs during the insurrection, in which 24 people were killed, including a member of the military police. Defeated in 1991 by the PNM, led by Patrick Manning, Robinson returned to centre-stage in 1995, as adviser to the coalition government of Basdeo Panday. In 1997 he was elected to the largely titular position of president.\n\nRobinson, Aubrey Charles (b. 1875, Jamaica - d. 19...), commissioner of the Cayman Islands (1913-16).\n\nRobinson, Charles (b.

May 21, 1944, Ballina, County Mayo, Ireland), president of Ireland (1990-97). She represented Trinity in the Senate in 1969-89. Her spirited opposition to the Anglo-Irish accord of 1985 caused her to quit the Labour Party in protest. She was also a member of the International Commission of Jurists (1987-90). It was not without difficulty that the Labour Party enticed her to run for president against the seemingly unbeatable Brian Lenihan in 1990. Once decided, however, she put her usual zeal into the endeavour and stumped around the country for an unprecedented six months. She pledged to encourage the liberalization of Ireland's laws, targeting especially the illegality of divorce, contraceptives, abortion, and homosexuality. While she wooed her conservative country to a new agenda, she maintained her image as a mother and wife with traditional family values. Still, she seemed destined to lose to the enormously popular Lenihan, with bookkeepers' odds running against her at 1,000-1, until he was enveloped in a scandal in the final weeks of the campaign. Even a barrage of negative advertising could not shake Robinson's firm support, particularly from conservative, rural women. When the ballots were cast on November 7, no candidate won a clear majority, but when the second choices on ballots for marginal candidates were tallied, Robinson finished ahead of Lenihan, 52.8 to 47%. Her presidency ended the 45-year control of the office by the Fianna Fáil party. In office she did much to communicate a modern image of Ireland. Shortly before her term expired, she stepped down to become United Nations high commissioner for human rights (1997-2002). She was also special envoy of the UN secretary-general for the Great Lakes region (2013-14) and one for climate change (2014-16) and in 2016 was named UN special envoy on El Niño and climate (jointly with Macharia Kamau).\n\nRobinson, Moses (b.

In 1939 he enlisted as a private soldier in the Canadian army and rose to the rank of wing commander in the Royal Canadian Air Force. He landed in France with the Allied forces in 1944 and served throughout the European campaign. He was elected to the Manitoba legislature on Nov. 10, 1949, for the constituency of Winnipeg South and was reelected on June 8, 1953. He was named leader of the Progressive Conservative Party in Manitoba on June 18, 1954, and became leader of the official opposition in the legislature. At the general election on June 16, 1958, his party gained the largest number of seats in the legislature and Roblin was called upon to become premier and form a government. He won three more elections (1959, 1962, 1966) before resigning as premier in 1967 and from the legislature in 1968 to contest the federal constituency of Winnipeg South Centre. On March 23, 1978, he was appointed to the Senate; he was leader of the government in the Senate in 1984-86.\n\nRoblin, Sir Rodmond Palen (b.

He became an inspector of finances in 1958 and subsequently rose to high posts in the government accounting service. In 1958 he broke away from the SFIO to found the left-wing Autonomous Socialist Party (PSA), which in 1960 merged with smaller splinter groups to form the Unified Socialist Party (PSU), of which he later served as national secretary (1967-73). He ran unsuccessfully for the French presidency in 1969, receiving less than 3.7% of the vote. He served in the National Assembly in 1969-73 and 1978-81. In 1974 he and most of his party's membership joined the larger Socialist Party (PS, successor of the SFIO), which was led by François Mitterrand. He served on the party's executive committee from 1975. He failed to oust Mitterrand as PS leader at a chaotic party congress in 1979 and became, in effect, opposition leader within the PS. He abandoned his own bid for the presidency in 1981 to support Mitterrand's successful campaign and then served as minister of planning and regional development (1981-83) and minister of agriculture (1983-85). In an early bid for the presidency in 1988, he promised to \"govern differently,\" but when Mitterrand announced he would run for reelection, Rocard again gave up his own campaign. After Mitterrand was reelected, Rocard was named prime minister, heading a minority government. Mitterrand replaced him in 1991 with Édith Cresson. He briefly led the Socialist Party after its 1993 general election rout but was ousted a year later. He became a member of the European Parliament (1994-2009) and of the French Senate (1995-97).\n\nF. Rocca\n\nRocca, Francesco (b.

From 1945 to 1958 he served the party as deputy for Saône-et-Loire, later rose to third secretary, and in 1961 was named deputy to Secretary-General Maurice Thorez, whom he succeeded three years later. A loyal party member, Rochet took a cautious view of destalinization yet played an important role in developing the policy of a \"French road\" to power by collaboration with other leftist parties. The Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left succeeded in keeping Charles de Gaulle from an absolute majority in the first round of the 1965 presidential election.

Eisenhower two years later as chairman of a presidential advisory committee on government organization. In 1953-55 he served as undersecretary of the newly created Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. With the intention of seeking an elective rather than appointive office, he again retired from the federal government in 1956. In 1958 he challenged incumbent Averell Harriman for governor of New York and, in an otherwise Democratic year, won the contest by more than 500,000 votes. An undeclared candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 1960, he withdrew when it became clear that Richard M. Nixon would be the nominee. Reelected governor in 1962, 1966, and 1970, he inaugurated a dramatic growth in state services. With Nixon out of the contest in 1964, \"Rocky\" was again a favourite for the presidential nomination.

He was also finance minister of Brazil in 1891-92 and 1894-96. His term as president of Brazil was marked by vast improvements in reconstruction and sanitary matters, and it was largely during his term that yellow fever was stamped out. Rio de Janeiro was transformed into one of the most beautiful cities, and all the chief ports in the country were extended and improved. Through his foreign minister, José Maria da Silva Paranhos, border disputes were settled peacefully with Bolivia, Uruguay, and British and Dutch Guiana. After his retirement from the presidency he was sent on various missions by the Brazilian government. On March 3, 1918, as the only candidate, he was again elected president, the first man chosen for the post for a second term. But he was not able to assume office on November 15, the date set for his inauguration, because of illness, and he had not yet taken the oath of office when he died.\n\nRodrigues de Arias, Luís Galvez (b.

June 19, 1923, Borja, Paraguay - d. April 21, 1997, New York City), president of Paraguay (1989-93). He started his career in the army in February 1942, when he joined the country's military college as a cadet. He graduated four years later as a cavalry junior officer. At the time that Gen. Alfredo Stroessner seized power in 1954, Rodríguez was a captain. His rise in the army began in August 1961, when Stroessner promoted him to colonel and put him in command of the 1st Cavalry Division, on the outskirts of the capital, Asunción; it was the biggest and best equipped of all the army divisions. In May 1967 he became brigadier general and in May 1970 general. On Feb. 3, 1989, Rodríguez, who had become commander of the 1st Army Corps in 1982, staged a bloody coup, bringing to an end the nearly 35-year-old Stroessner dictatorship. Busy polishing up his image and patching up relations with the church, which was a firm critic of his predecessor, Rodríguez undoubtedly had a negotiating ability that military men did not usually possess. He succeeded in gaining the maximum breadth of political support for the coup and in defusing the country's explosive problem of landless peasants. On May 1, 1989, he was democratically elected president. In 1992 his opponents forced a constitutional amendment forbidding him or any blood relative from standing for president in the future. In exchange, he was to become a lifetime senator, giving him immunity from prosecution on charges of drug trafficking swirling around him since the 1970s. In 1993 he kept his promise to give up power and turn the presidency over to the civilian winner of a new election (Juan Carlos Wasmosy), then retired from the army and became senator for life.\n\nRodríguez (Ramírez), Antonio (d.

He was elected to Congress in 1990 and was its president in 1991-92. He resigned from parliament in 1994 to devote time to his first presidential race, which he lost to José María Figueres by only 20,000 votes. For the 1998 election, he began early and spent millions of dollars to build a powerful organization that stretched even to the most remote villages. He came under a cloud of suspicion for allegedly improper business practices and for his links to a shady Mexican political \"godfather,\" Carlos Hank González. Rodríguez denied any wrongdoing. He narrowly won against José Miguel Corrales. Rodríguez's victory was mainly due to voters' frustration with rising prices and dropping incomes under Figueres, and many hoped his business savvy and economic training would help them make ends meet. In 2004 he became secretary-general of the Organization of American States but resigned within a month, amid allegations of corruption back in Costa Rica. A former member of his cabinet reportedly accused him of accepting 60% of a $2.4 million \"prize\" from Alcatel, a French firm that won a $149 million cellular phone contract with the Costa Rican government in 2001. He was arrested on his return to Costa Rica on October 15. He was released from house arrest on Oct. 14, 2005.

Aug. 4, 1960, Valladolid, Spain), prime minister of Spain (2004-11). His grandfather was executed by the forces of fascist leader Francisco Franco during the 1936-39 Civil War. Spain finally began to emerge from dictatorship after Franco's death in 1975 and Rodríguez became a leader of the Socialist Party (PSOE) in the northern city of León three years later at the age of 18. At 26, he was the youngest-ever member of Spain's parliament where he came under the spell of the charismatic prime minister Felipe González. He remained one of González's staunchest supporters, despite a string of corruption scandals that tainted his last years in power. In July 2000 he was elected secretary-general of PSOE. 415 of nearly 1,000 votes were enough to narrowly beat nearest rival José Bono, the powerful president of Castilla-La Mancha region. As the youngest of four candidates in the ballot, he found it easy to paint himself as the champion of change. He faced one of the hardest jobs in European politics, to overcome the deep rifts within the once mighty party which had suffered a crippling general election defeat in March. He was liked by the media for smilingly answering reporters' questions and his trademark was his call for \"calm change.\" As head of the party's \"New Way\" group - which proposed internal reforms to win back the trust of voters - he associated himself with British prime minister Tony Blair whose \"New\" Labour Party triumphed in 1997 after a long spell in the political wilderness. He also praised the 35-hour week introduced by French Socialist prime minister Lionel Jospin. He won a surprise victory in the 2004 elections (days after a deadly terrorist attack in Madrid) and quickly fulfilled a campaign pledge to withdraw Spanish troops from Iraq. After being reelected in 2008, in 2011 he announced not to seek another term and, in the face of the European debt crisis, called early elections which his party lost heavily. He was party leader until February 2012.\n\nRodzyanko, Mikhail (Vladimirovich) (b. April 12 [March 31, O.S.], 1859, Popasnoye, Yekaterinoslav province, Russia [now in Ukraine] - d.

Jan. 2, 2001, Bethesda, Md.), U.S. attorney general (1957-61) and secretary of state (1969-73). He was assistant district attorney of New York county (1938-42, 1946-47) after service in the navy. He was chief counsel for the Senate war investigating committee in 1947-48, and from 1948 to 1950 chief counsel of the Senate's subcommittee on executive expenditure. He was named deputy attorney general under Herbert Brownell, Jr., in the original Dwight D. Eisenhower cabinet of 1953. When Brownell resigned Oct. 23, 1957, Rogers was designated his successor. He took office on November 8 and was confirmed by the Senate Jan. 27, 1958. In March 1958 he helped prepare the Nixon-Eisenhower personal agreement under which Vice-Pres. Richard M. Nixon would become acting president temporarily in the event of President Eisenhower's inability to act. On September 2 he recommended that the jurisdictional scope of the International Court of Justice be widened. The court itself, he said, rather than individual nations, should have the power to decide whether or not it had jurisdiction in a dispute. He served as secretary of state under President Nixon but was often overshadowed by Nixon and his national security advisor, Henry Kissinger. In December 1969 he made public a peace plan, soon known as the Rogers Plan, which envisaged Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank to its 1967 borders, with minor modifications for mutual security. Israel and Egypt rejected the plan. In August 1970 he brought about a truce in the war of attrition between Egypt and Israel.\n\nRogers-Wright, Cyril B(unting Oluworke) (b. June 13, 1910 - d.

May 27, 1885, Saint-Josse-ten-Noode [now in Brussels-Capital region], Belgium), interior minister (1832-34, 1847-52, 1857-61), cabinet chief (1847-52, 1857-68), and foreign minister (1861-68) of Belgium. In 1824 he was one of the founders of the journal Mathieu Laensbergh (later Le Politique), which became known for its Belgian patriotism and its criticisms of the Dutch administration, Belgium being at that time part of the unitary Kingdom of The Netherlands. When insurrection broke out in Brussels in August 1830, he mustered 150 Liégeois and marched with them to support it. He became a principal member of the provisional government formed in September; representing this, he went in October to Antwerp and arranged an armistice with the Dutch. Deputy for Liége in the new National Congress, he insisted on the proclamation of Belgian independence and on the establishment of a hereditary monarchy. He became governor of Antwerp in 1831 and minister of the interior in 1832. He carried the law for the construction of railways, the first in Europe, but disagreement within the cabinet led to his resignation in 1834, when he resumed the governorship of Antwerp. In 1840-41 he was minister of public works, education, and fine arts. Roman Catholic opposition kept him out of office from 1841 until 1847, when he formed a Liberal government. His electoral reform law (1848) did much to save Belgium from the revolutionary convulsions which shook other European nations that year. His education bill of 1850 created an alternative to the existing Roman Catholic school system. In his second ministry (1857-68), his envoy Auguste Lambermont negotiated the agreement with the Netherlands freeing Antwerp's maritime commerce from liability to tolls on the Scheldt River. Rogier retired in favour of Walthère Frère-Orban in 1868 but remained active in public affairs throughout the 1870s, being president of the Chamber of Representatives in 1878.\n\nRognon, Charles Amédée (b.

He was also mayor of Christiansand (1847, 1855, 1858).\n\nRogué, Jacques (Camille Marie) (b. March 31, 1898, Paris, France - d. July 4, 1980, Le Mans, Sarthe, France), governor of Chad (1943-49) and Mauritania (1950-52).\n\nRoh Moo Hyun\n\nRoh Moo Hyun, Revised Romanization No Mu-hyeon (b. Aug. 6, 1946, Kimhae, South Kyongsang province, Korea [now in South Korea] - d. May 23, 2009, Pusan, South Korea), president of South Korea (2003-08). He built a reputation as a human rights lawyer and was once arrested and had his lawyer's license suspended for supporting an outlawed labour protest. He entered the National Assembly in 1988 as an opposition member elected in Pusan, the nation's second-largest city. After splitting with Kim Young Sam's party in 1990, he failed in three elections for a parliamentary seat (1992, 2000) and mayor's job (1995) in Pusan running on the ticket of Kim Dae Jung's party, which was unpopular in the city and surrounding provinces. His futile attempts earned him the moniker \"Roh the idiot,\" but also brought him respect for challenging regional favouritism, the bane of South Korean politics. Roh, popular with young voters, was the underdog in the 2002 presidential race against main opposition Grand National Party candidate Lee Hoi Chang. Roh promised to improve relations with Communist North Korea and push for a more equal relationship with the nation's closest ally, the United States. Anti-U.S. sentiment rose sharply in South Korea ahead of the election, fueled by the acquittals of two U.S. soldiers whose armoured vehicle had killed two teenage girls. Roh, who once demanded an end to the U.S. presence, now said he supported it, but he still wanted to revise the legal code governing the 37,000 American soldiers in South Korea to give the host country more jurisdiction. He defeated Lee 49%-47%. In September 2003, he left the Millennium Democratic Party as his supporters broke away to form the Uri party after infighting. In March 2004, in the country's first presidential impeachment, the opposition-controlled parliament voted to strip him of executive powers on charges of illegal electioneering and incompetence, but the Constitutional Court reinstated him in May. He committed suicide by jumping into a ravine on a mountainside near his home.\n\nRoh Tae Woo\n\nRoh Tae Woo, Revised Romanization No Tae-u (b. Dec. 4, 1932, Dalsung, near Daegu, Korea [now in South Korea] - d. Oct. 26, 2021, Seoul, South Korea), president of South Korea (1988-93). Following the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, he joined the South Korean army and with his friend Chun Doo Hwan attended the Korean Military Academy, where they both graduated in 1955. Roh served in Vietnam in the 1960s and by 1979 he was a general in command of the 1st Division. In December 1979, Chun and some fellow officers launched a coup against the civilian government, with Roh giving them crucial support. Chun became president in 1980, and in 1981 Roh resigned from the military and joined Chun's government, serving as minister of political affairs (1981-82), sports (1982), and home affairs (1982-83). As head of the Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee in 1983-86, he oversaw South Korea's preparations for the 1988 Summer Olympic Games at Seoul. Chun chose Roh in 1985 to become the new chairman of the ruling Democratic Justice Party (DJP), and in June 1987 to be the DJP candidate in the upcoming presidential elections. Roh won the December 16 election because the opposition was split between Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae Jung. The moderate and conciliatory Roh orchestrated the retirement from politics of his unpopular predecessor Chun. He instituted democratic reforms, which contributed to the DJP failing to gain a majority of seats in 1988 parliamentary elections, but in 1990 he merged the DJP with two opposition parties to form a new majority party called the Democratic Liberal Party. In 1991 he signed an agreement with North Korea calling for nonaggression between the two Koreas, both of which were admitted to the United Nations the same year. After leaving office he was tried on charges of mutiny and sedition for his involvement in the 1979 coup and on corruption charges. Sentenced to 17 years in prison in August 1996, he was pardoned in December 1997.\n\nRohde, Ruth Bryan Owen, née Bryan (Owen from 1910, Rohde from 1936) (b. Oct. 2, 1885, Jacksonville, Ill. - d. July 26, 1954, Copenhagen, Denmark), U.S. diplomat; daughter of William Jennings Bryan. She was minister to Denmark (1933-36), the first woman to hold such a post in the American foreign service.\n\nRohee\n\nRohee, Clement (James) (b.

Nov. 28, 1887, Munich, Germany - d. July 1, 1934, Munich), German army officer. He joined the army in 1906. During World War I he was wounded three times and rose to the rank of major. After the war he remained on the staff of the army district command in Munich. In 1919 he joined the precursor of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. He helped Adolf Hitler to win the support of the army in Bavaria and provided him with the services of his own strong-arm squads, which, in October 1921, became the SA (the Brownshirts). He took part in the Munich (Beer Hall) Putsch of Nov. 8-9, 1923, was arrested, and in April 1924 sentenced to a short term of imprisonment. Hitler wanted the SA to remain subordinate to the party, while Röhm wanted it to be on equal terms with the party, and eventually to absorb or replace the regular army. In 1925 Röhm resigned the leadership of the SA and went to Bolivia, but returned late in 1930 at Hitler's request to reorganize the SA. When Hitler became chancellor in 1933, he temporized by including Röhm in his cabinet as minister without portfolio but then definitely subordinated the SA to the party and the army. Persuaded by Hermann Göring and Heinrich Himmler, the Führer finally decided to purge the SA chief. On June 30, 1934, Röhm was taken by Hitler personally from a hotel at Bad Wiessee, near Munich, on the pretext that he and the SA were preparing a putsch. He was shot without trial the next day.\n\nRoibu, Alexei (b.

He rose in the army to reach the highest rank, lieutenant general, in 1949, having played a role in suppressing the riots that followed the assassination of left-wing leader Jorge Eliécer Gaitán in April 1948. He was minister of posts and telegraphs (1949-50), commander of the armed forces (1951-53), and a member of the Inter-American Defense Board (1951-52) before taking power in a coup, welcomed by the people after four years of the brutal and authoritarian regime of Pres. Laureano Gómez and virtual civil war between Conservatives and Liberals. He promised justice, freedom, and order and had the support of both parties. However, he maintained rule by decree, censored the press, made the secret police ever-present, stirred up violence against Protestant churches and schools, and embezzled government money until he was ousted in a coup supported by Conservatives and Liberals. He went into exile in Spain. When he returned to Colombia in October 1958, he was impeached, and in April 1959 he lost his civil rights. He nevertheless re-entered politics, forming the Acción Nacional Popular (Anapo) in 1960. In 1962 he won 2.5% of the votes for president. The disintegration of the left-wing faction of the Liberal Party made Anapo the leading protest group of the lower classes. In 1967 a court ruled that he could not be deprived of his civil rights, and he ran again for president in 1970, being narrowly defeated by the National Front candidate, Misael Pastrana Borrero. Rojas claimed fraud and was arrested after civil disorders. In the presidential election of 1974, due to his ill health, his daughter María Eugenia Rojas de Moreno Díaz ran as the Anapo candidate, being soundly defeated.\n\nRojas Ruíz, Edgar, interior and justice minister of Bolivia (1982).\n\nRojas Saavedra, Patricio (b.
