        "text": "After finishing a recent reread of Antonio Mu√±oz Molina‚Äôs excellent Spanish-Civil-War novel, In the Night of Time (translated by Edith Grossman), I was browsing my shelves for something else to try when I stumbled across an exciting (re)discovery. It was a book that had slipped my mind, another novel dealing with the same era, and one I had intended to try several times over the years without ever getting around to it. However, where AMM‚Äôs novel was a dark, brooding work detailing a descent into chaos, my latest read turned out to be a far lighter affair, featuring a foreigner caught up in intrigue and turmoil. Sounds great, no? If only I‚Äôd picked it up in 2013 when I was sent it üòâ\n\n*****\n\nEduardo Mendoza‚Äôs An Englishman in Madrid (translated by Nick Caistor, review copy courtesy of MacLehose Press) begins with English academic and art expert Anthony Whitelands on his way to Madrid. He has been commissioned to examine the collection of an aristocratic Spanish family in the hope that some paintings can be sold to raise funds, enabling the family members to quietly slip out of the country before the inevitable bloodshed of the coming conflict begins. Whitelands has his own reasons for wanting some time abroad, and the warm welcome he receives from the Duke of Igualada, and his beautiful daughter Paquita, makes the job even more enjoyable.\n\nAlas, it isn‚Äôt long before this excellent adventure turns into a bit of a nightmare. After losing his passport (at a brothel), our friend comes to the attention of the British Embassy, and further mishaps see him hauled into the local police station to be interrogated by some rather important people. The truth is that Whitelands‚Äô innocent task turns out to be rather more complicated (not to mention illegal) than he‚Äôd imagined, involving a legendary lost painting, the charismatic leader of the Falange terrorist group and a Soviet spy eager to get rid of the interfering Englishman. And that‚Äôs before we even get to his women problems‚Ä¶\n\nAn Englishman in Madrid was the recipient of the Premio Planeta de Novela in 2010, an award that comes with a whopping ‚Ç¨601,000 in prize money, so I was expecting something fairly high-brow from Mendoza‚Äôs novel, but what I ended up reading was very different. It‚Äôs an engaging, entertaining and at times farcical novel, with the setting of the build-up to the Spanish Civil War little more than window dressing to the plot. While the writer sets the stage with protagonists from all sides of the political divide, the book is really all about Whitelands and his journey into the unknown.\n\nThe humour is evident from the first pages, with our hero writing a letter from the safety of his train carriage, breaking off with a married woman he has been too cowardly to dump in person. Once in the Spanish capital, he bumbles from incident to incident, trailed by police officers and sought out by people who want to ingratiate themselves with him (or get rid of him). Despite his virtually perfect Spanish, he frequently manages to get lost, stranded or penniless ‚Äì he‚Äôs not exactly spy material, but somehow he ends up in the middle of a conspiracy with all sides hoping to use him (including several women).\n\nIt‚Äôs only when it comes to art that Whitelands‚Äô true colours actually shine. Mention a painting, and the confused tourist becomes an academic with a razor-sharp intellect, ready to shoot down anyone who challenges his views, even the fiery Paquita:\n\n‚ÄúI detect a hint of irony in your voice,‚Äù said Anthony. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm probably boring you with my ramblings. But I must insist that you‚Äôre wrong. Experts‚Äô debates and theories may seem dull, and my articles definitely are, but art itself isn‚Äôt. Paintings mean things, just as much as poems or music do ‚Äì important things. I know that for a lot of people an old painting is nothing more than a precious possession, a collector‚Äôs item or an excuse to show off one‚Äôs knowledge in order to advance in the academic world, and I won‚Äôt deny that these factors exist and need to be taken into account. But above all, a work of art is the expression of something both sublime and yet at the same time deeply rooted in our beliefs and emotions.‚Äù\n\np.171 (MacLehose Press, 2013)\n\nIt‚Äôs for this reason that the visiting Englishman is of such importance. At the heart of the story lies a special painting, a possible unknown Vel√°zquez that has a different meaning for different people. For Whitelands, of course, it means fame in the art world; for some of the owner‚Äôs family members, it offers an opportunity to flee Spain. However, there are also those who hope to use the painting to fund their cause and bring the country closer to revolution‚Ä¶\n\nWhile An Englishman in Madrid finishes before the revolutionary action begins, the reader is introduced to several real-life figures who were to feature in the events later that year. One of the key characters of the novel is Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera, the Falangist leader (and Whitelands‚Äô main rival for Paquita), and he proves to be a fascinating character who is unable to decide what to do with his new acquaintance. We even catch a few glimpses of Franco himself, a brutal, brooding figure whom the Englishman is lucky enough to avoid (we sense this would not have been a happy encounter). Interestingly, where Mu√±oz Molina‚Äôs characters were overwhelmingly from the left, our time in Mendoza‚Äôs world is mostly spent with those on the right, making for an interesting overview of the complicated politics of the time.\n\nIn truth, though, In the Night of Time and An Englishman in Madrid are completely different books, and if you want a more apt comparison (albeit one only British readers of a certain age will understand), what Mendoza‚Äôs book reminds me of most is the BBC comedy series ‚ÄòAllo ‚ÄòAllo. This slightly dated (and very un-PC) sitcom featured a middle-aged caf√© owner living under German occupation in Vichy France, and An Englishman in Madrid is surprisingly similar in the way a man who just wants to get on with his life is constantly sidetracked by women and rival spy factions. Take the following scene, in which the Duke‚Äôs son comes to Whitelands‚Äô hotel room for an urgent discussion:\n\nAnthony closed the door, pointed to the only chair in the room, quickly pulled the cover over the bed, and sat down on it.\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bother,‚Äù said Guillermo del Valle. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only take a few minutes of your time. Are we alone? Yes, I can see we are. I meant, can we talk and be sure no-one will overhear us? As I told you, it‚Äôs a matter of extreme urgency.‚Äù\n\nJudging that this was hardly the moment to admit there was an adolescent prostitute hiding in the wardrobe, Anthony invited the newcomer to explain what it was all about. (p.226)\n\nThe parallels between Whitelands and the hapless Ren√© Artois include the frequent meetings with the authorities and various underground organisations (‚ÄúI shall say ‚Äòzis only once‚Ä¶‚Äù) and the way virtually every women he meets wants to jump into bed with him. Even the painting points to a connection ‚Äì once we eventually get to ‚Äòsee‚Äô the alleged lost Vel√°zquez, it‚Äôs *very* difficult not to think of it as the picture of The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies‚Ä¶\n\nAn Englishman in Madrid is unlikely to add too much to your knowledge of 1930s Madrid, and it can be overwhelmed by some heavy info-dumping in places, but overall Mendoza‚Äôs humorous spy novel is a delight, with Caistor doing an excellent job of maintaining the tone and ensuring the story manages the difficult balancing act between farce and thriller. I‚Äôm not totally convinced that it deserved a cash prize that would enable the writer to buy my house several times over, but it certainly made for an enjoyable few hours and shows that you shouldn‚Äôt be too hasty about culling your bookcases ‚Äì you never know when you might find time for those books lurking on the back shelves."
