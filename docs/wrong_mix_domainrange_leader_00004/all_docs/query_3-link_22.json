        "text": "On this date in 1923, two anarchists were garroted in the Catalan city of Terrassa.\n\nTerrassa was unwillingly under new management, having been occupied by the Captain-General of Catalonia Miguel Primo de Rivera* upon the latter’s coup just days prior to the events in this post.\n\nIn historical periodization, Primo de Rivera’s six-year dictatorship marks a last stage of the Restoration, a decades-long social struggle bridging the span between Spain’s twilight years in the imperial-powers club and the onset of the Spanish Civil War.\n\nSpain and especially the notoriously insurrectionary Catalonia had been riven by conflict in the first years of the 1920s. One of our principals for this day’s execution, Jesus Saleta, had been a leader of the intermittently outlawed anarchist trade union CNT,* whose gunmen fought ferocious street battles with police and company enforcers.\n\nHe was not averse to dirtying his own hands. In 1922, Saleta had stood trial (he was acquitted both times) for running a bomb factory and for orchestrating an attack on businessman Joan Bayes. After the murder of CNT executive Salvador Segui early in 1923, Saleta helped organize the reprisals. Tension and bloodshed rose throughout the year.\n\nOn September 18, he committed the crime for which he would die less than a week later: together with Pascual Aguirre and several other anarchists, he robbed a bank to finance his underground operations; a man was shot dead in the process. Saleta, Aguirre, and a third collaborator, Joaquin Marco, were arrested in the ensuing chase.\n\nMarco was acquitted — he had not been identified clearly enough — but both Saleta and Aguirre were condemned to the firing squad, a sentence the military unilaterally amended to the garrote on the grounds that shooting was too honorable a death for these terrorists.\n\nBoth went boldly to the scaffold on this date. (There’s a full narration of proceedings in a Spanish newspaper (pdf) here, and a plain-text equivalent here) “This is the way anarchists die!” a proud Saleta exclaimed to the executioner as he was seated.**\n\nThe cry “Viva anarchy!” was the last thing each man uttered as the metal ring wrung the life from his throat.\n\n* We’ve already met Primo de Rivera’s Falangist son in these pages.\n\n** The two were garroted by longtime executioner Gregorio Mayoral Sendino, assisted by Rogelio Perez Vicario [or Cicario]. The latter was assassinated in revenge by Barcelona anarchists on May 7, 1924.\n\nOn this day..\n\n1959: John Day Jr., Korean War casualty\n\n1948: Shafiq Ades\n\n1730: Cathrine M'Canna, mother's daughter\n\n1831: Slaves of Sussex County, for Nat Turner's rebellion\n\n1675: Katharina Paldauff, the Flower Witch\n\n1603: Marco Tulio Catizone, the false Dom Sebastian\n\n1884: Two Pennsylvania murderers\n\n782: 4,500 Saxons by order of Charlemagne\n\n1921: Jake Martin and Putnam Ponsell\n\n1947: Nikola Petkov, \"a dog's death\"\n\n1864: Six of Mosby's Rangers\n\n1994: Johannes van Damme, heroin smuggler\n\n“Above all, there was a belief in the revolution and the future, a feeling of having suddenly emerged into an era of equality and freedom. Human beings were trying to behave as human beings and not as cogs in the capitalist machine.\n\n-George Orwell, Homage to Catalonia\n\nOn this date in 1940, Catalan president Lluis Companys was shot by the Spanish fascists.\n\nCompanys had held that notional office for mere hours six years before — but he’s still the last to hold it in any form at all.\n\nPolitical exile was no unfamiliar terrain for Companys. As a young lawyer, his activism in the first two decades of the century had seen him incarcerated over a dozen times; in fact, his path to political respectability had entailed getting out of a Menorca prison in 1920 courtesy of the parliamentary immunity conferred by winning an election.\n\nAnd he’d drawn a long sentence for an attempted 1934 rising against a center-right government — the occasion when he had become the President of the Catalan Republic on October 6, and been dispossessed of both office and state by the very next day.\n\nThat prison sentence’s reversal by the new republican government in 1936 was a bit of Pyrrhic victory for Companys’s left-wing politics — inasmuch as said republicans’ ascent was also the trigger for the nationalist revolt that resulted in the Spanish Civil War and a military dictatorship lasting until the 1970s.\n\nAs the virtual personification of Catalan national aspirations, Companys remained head of the Generalitat de Catalunya from 1933 until his death — in prison, in exile, wherever Companys went he bore along the Catalan cause.\n\nAs such, he was in the thick of the civil war’s scrap for control of Barcelona: not only against the fascists but among the left parties whose fractious alliance tore apart in 1937.\n\nIt was truly a case of riding the tiger. Companys struggled to maintain the cooperation of his alliance even while the republicans’ Soviet sponsors excommunicated anarchist and anti-Stalinist elements internally. The dreadful spectacle of internecine street fighting among the anti-fascists in May 1937 fills the final tragic pages of Orwell’s Homage, decided by the inescapable materialist circumstances: “the Government could not afford to offend the Communist Party while the Russians were supplying arms.”\n\nFew sources direct much personal blame at Companys for what followed. Under Soviet pressure, he accepted the Communist police raids that had set off the street fighting, accepted the purges and the press censorsip, sacked anti-Stalinist minister Andres Nin from the government. (Nin was later “disappeared” and murdered.)\n\nWho knows but that even these evil days were not still the best that could be made of a bad circumstance: whatever they were, they were not enough for republican Spain or for Catalonia.\n\nWhen those dreams fell under the fascist advance little more than a year later, Companys couldn’t flee Franco far enough for safety. Soon after his 1939 escape to France, that country was overrun by militaristic rightists from the other direction — and the German occupiers happily handed Companys back to Spain as soon as they got their hands on him.\n\nCondemned after the formality of a perfunctory trial for “military rebellion” conducted on October 14, 1940, Companys was shot the very next morning Montjuic Castle. (See Franco: A Biography)\n\nSpain, where questions of Catalan sovereignty and the Franco years are both sensitive subjects, has never reversed the judgment (Spanish link) against Companys. However, a Barcelona promenade is named in Companys’s honor, as is a major stadium — actually the arena where the anti-fascist 1936 People’s Olympiad in opposition to the notorious master race spectacle of Berlin was to have taken place, before that whole Civil War unpleasantness.\n\nOn this day..\n\n1948: Arthur Eggers, by Earl Warren\n\n1794: Robert Watt, British Conventioner\n\n1660: John Carew, regicide\n\n1767: Tom, slave of the Baylor family\n\n1937: Panfiliya Tanailidi, Azerbaijani actress\n\n1651: James Stanley, Earl of Derby\n\n1942: Coastwatchers on Tarawa\n\n2012: Eric Robert, determined volunteer\n\n1964: Nguyen Van Troi, Viet Cong urban guerrilla\n\n1942: Three Doolittle raiders\n\n1896: Rainandriamampandry and Prince Ratsimamanga\n\n1917: Mata Hari, femme fatale\n\nThemed Set: Belles Epoque"
