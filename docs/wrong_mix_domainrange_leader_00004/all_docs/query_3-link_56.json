        "text": "Indonesian and French singer-songwriter (born 1974)\n\nAnggun Cipta Sasmi (Indonesian pronunciation: [aŋˈɡun ˈtʃipta ˈsasmi]; born 29 April 1974) is an Indonesian-French singer, songwriter, and television personality. Born in Jakarta, she began performing at the age of seven and recorded a children's album two years later. She rose to fame in 1989 as a teenage rock star and by 1993 she had released five Indonesian-language studio albums. Rolling Stone listed her single \"Mimpi\" as one of the 150 Greatest Indonesian Songs of All Time.\n\nAnggun left Indonesia for England in 1994 to pursue an international career. She later moved to France and recorded her first international album, Snow on the Sahara (1997). It was released in 33 countries by Sony Music and sold more than one million copies worldwide. Since then, Anggun has released another six studio albums—in English and French—and a soundtrack album to the Danish film Open Hearts (2002). Her singles \"Snow on the Sahara\", \"What We Remember\", \"The Good Is Back\", and \"Perfect World\" entered the Billboard charts in the United States while \"In Your Mind\", \"Saviour\" and \"I'll Be Alright\" charted on the Billboard European Hot 100 Singles. She represented France in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, with the song \"Echo (You and I)\".\n\nAnggun also ventured into television, becoming the judge for the Indonesian versions of The X Factor (2013), Got Talent (2014), and The Voice (2018); the pancontinental Asia's Got Talent (2015–2019); the French version of Masked Singer (2019–2022); and the Belgian version of StarMaker (2023). She also performed as the leading actress in musical theater show Al Capone (2023) and played supporting roles in the film Coup de foudre à Bangkok (2020) and TV series Profession Comédien (2021). Aside from her career in entertainment, Anggun has been appointed as the global ambassador of the United Nations twice, first for the International Year of Microcredit in 2005 and then for the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 2009.\n\nAnggun is one of the best-selling Asian artists outside Asia, with her releases being certified gold and platinum in some European countries. She is the first Indonesian artist to have success in European and American record charts. She has received a number of accolades for her achievements, including the Chevalier des Arts et Lettres from the Government of France, the World Music Award for World's Best-Selling Indonesian Artist, and the Asian Television Award for Outstanding Contribution to Asian Television Performing Arts. She also became the first woman from Indonesia to be immortalized in wax by Madame Tussauds.\n\nAnggun was born in Jakarta on 29 April 1974. She is the second child and first daughter of Darto Singo, a Javanese writer, and Dien Herdina, a housewife from the Yogyakarta royal family.[1][2] Her full name means \"grace born of a dream\". Despite being a Muslim, Anggun was sent to a Catholic school to receive a better elementary education.[3][4] At the age of seven, Anggun began receiving highly disciplined instruction in singing from her father.[5] She trained daily, learning various vocal techniques. To help further develop her career, her mother began serving as her manager, accepting singing offers and handling business concerns.[6] At the age of nine, Anggun learned to write her own songs and recorded her first ever studio album, Kepada Alam dan Penciptanya (1983), which featured children's music.[7][8]\n\nTransitioning into adolescence, Anggun was influenced by Western rock music artists.[3] In 1986, she released her second studio album and her first post-childhood recording titled Dunia Aku Punya. Although it was produced by Ian Antono, a famous Indonesian rock musician, the album was not a commercial success.[9] Anggun rose to fame three years later, after the release of the single \"Mimpi\"; the song was later ranked by the Rolling Stone Indonesia magazine as one of the 150 Greatest Indonesian Songs of All Time.[10] Anggun's success continued in the early 1990s with a string of hit singles such as \"Tua Tua Keladi\", \"Laba Laba\", and \"Takut\". Anggun also recorded the studio albums Anak Putih Abu Abu (1991) and Nocturno (1992).[2] The former earned her the Most Popular Indonesian Artist 1990–1991 award.[11]\n\nIn 1992, Anggun began a relationship with Michel de Gea, a French engineer, whom she had met the year before in Kalimantan while touring.[12] The couple married, despite a rumoured objection by Anggun's family, reportedly because they felt Anggun was too young.[12] De Gea later became Anggun's manager. The following year, Anggun became the youngest Indonesian singer to found her own record company, Bali Cipta Records, and took complete creative control over her work.[3] She produced her fifth and final Indonesian studio album, Anggun C. Sasmi... Lah!!! (1993), which yielded the hit song \"Kembalilah Kasih (Kita Harus Bicara)\".[9] By age nineteen, Anggun had sold over four million albums in Indonesia.[3][11] She began to feel dissatisfied with her success in her country and began considering an international music career. Anggun later recalled: \"[By the time] I was 20, I'd made five albums. I'd built my own record company. I'd produced my last album and produced some Indonesian acts as well. And I said to myself: 'I'm tired! I cannot achieve more than I already have. There's no challenge anymore'.\"[13]\n\nIn 1994, Anggun released Yang Hilang, a greatest hits album of her Indonesian popular songs. She later sold her record company to fund her move to Europe, and she moved to London for about a year.[13][14] In a 2006 interview with Trax magazine, Anggun admitted to experiencing \"culture shock\" and having some serious financial problems while trying to start her new life in Europe, saying \"I thought the money that I got by selling my record company was enough [to sustain life in London], but I began to lose money, little by little. I had to spend so much on taking cabs and eating! So I ended up taking buses everywhere and going to clubs to introduce myself as a singer.\" She also admitted that she \"had to convert from being a shy, introverted, 'real' Javanese woman to being an unabashed, fearless, 'fake' Javanese woman.\"[15]\n\nShe began writing songs and recording demos, but after a few months, all the demos she had sent to record companies in England were returned with negative replies.[15] She initially considered relocating to the Netherlands, due to a large number of Indonesian diaspora there, but she later decided to move to France.[15] In 1996, she met French singer Florent Pagny in Paris, who instantly became her mentor.[16][17] Pagny introduced her to French producer Erick Benzi, who had previously worked with Celine Dion, Jean-Jacques Goldman, and Johnny Hallyday. Impressed by Anggun's musical ability, Benzi immediately offered her a recording project. Later that year, Anggun was signed to Columbia France and Sony Music.[2] After learning to speak French, Anggun began working on her debut album with Benzi, alongside songwriters Jacques Veneruso and Nikki Matheson [fr].[18]\n\nIn June 1997, Anggun released her first French-language album, entitled Au nom de la lune. The album was a huge artistic departure from her earlier rock style, experimenting with world music and more adult contemporary sounds.[19] The album's first single, \"La neige au Sahara\", quickly became a hit in France, reaching number three on the airplay chart and number 16 on the sales chart, both compiled by the SNEP.[20] It became the most played French-language song of 1997, with a total of 7,900 radio airplays across the country, and was certified gold for shipment of 250,000 copies.[21][22] Two more commercial singles, \"La rose des vents\" and \"Au nom de la lune\", were released to modest chart success.[20] The album peaked at number 34 on the French Albums Chart and sold over 150,000 copies in France and Belgium.[20] Anggun received a nomination for Best New Artist at the 1998 Victoires de la Musique (the French equivalent of the Grammy Awards).[23]\n\nThe English version of the album, Snow on the Sahara (also titled Anggun in some markets), was released in 33 countries throughout Asia, Europe, and North America between late 1997 and early 1999.[24] American music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called the album \"a promising debut effort\" because \"she illustrates enough full-formed talent on the disc\".[25] The album's lead single, \"Snow on the Sahara\" reached number one in Italy, number five on the Japan's Tokio Hot 100, and number six on the UK Pop Club Chart.[26] The song was also used as the soundtrack for an international marketing campaign launched by the Swiss watchmaker Swatch.[16] The second single, \"A Rose in the Wind\" became a top-20 hit in Italy, while its Indonesian version, titled \"Kembali\", became a huge hit in Southeast Asia.[27] Snow on the Sahara has sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide and received the Diamond Export Sales Award.[28][29]\n\nIn North America, Snow on the Sahara was released in May 1998 by Epic Records.[7] Anggun went on an extensive tour for nine months in the United States to promote the album,[4] including as a supporting act for several artists such as The Corrs and Toni Braxton, as well as participating at the Lilith Fair, an all-female music festival founded by Sarah McLachlan.[8] She also appeared on American television programs such as The Rosie O'Donnell Show, Sessions at West 54th, Penn & Teller's Sin City Spectacular, and CNN World Beat.[18][30] As a result, the album peaked at number 23 on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums Chart and shipped 200,000 units.[4][31] The single reached number 16 on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play and number 22 on the Billboard Adult Top 40.[32] The album track \"On the Breath of an Angel\" was later used as the soundtrack of American television series Passions and television film The Princess and the Marine, both of which aired on NBC.[33][34]\n\nAfter divorcing Michel de Gea in 1999, Anggun worked on her next international album. Her second French album, Désirs contraires, was released in September 1999. It was an artistic departure from Au nom de la lune, experimenting with electropop and ambient elements as well as R&B music.[19] The album was again produced by Erick Benzi, but it featured some of Anggun's compositions. Désirs contraires went relatively unnoticed in France, peaking at number 48 on the albums chart and selling about 30,000 copies there.[20] The album's first single, \"Un geste d'amour\", reached number 62 on the French Singles Chart.[20]\n\nIt was the English version of the album that enjoyed more success. Chrysalis was released at the same time as Désirs contraires and represented a huge artistic growth for Anggun, who had co-written the entire album.[24] Distributed simultaneously in 15 countries, the album spawned the hit single \"Still Reminds Me\", which received high airplay across Asia and Europe.[24] It became her third number-one hit in Indonesia since her international career and her third top 20 single in Italy (peaking at number 17).[35] It also reached the top five on the Music & Media European Border Breakers Chart. She released a single especially for the Indonesian and Malaysian market, \"Yang 'Ku Tunggu\" (the Indonesian version of \"Un geste d'amour\"), which became another number-one hit for Anggun in the region.[27]\n\nAt the end of 2000 Anggun received an invitation from the Vatican, asking her to appear at a special Christmas concert alongside Bryan Adams and Dionne Warwick.[16] The following month, she started a tour across Asia and Europe, including her first-ever concert in France at Le Bataclan on 1 February 2001. The tour ended on 30 April 2001 at Kallang Theatre, Singapore.[16] In 2002, Anggun received the Women Inspire Award from Singapore's Beacon of Light award ceremony for \"her achievements as a role model for many young women in Asia.\"[36] The next year, she was honored with Cosmopolitan Indonesia's Fun Fearless Female of the Year Award.[37]\n\nDuring this period, Anggun also did a string of collaborations, soundtrack projects, and charity albums. These included a mixed French-English song with DJ Cam entitled \"Summer in Paris\" on his 2002 album, Soulshine;[38] an Indonesian-English song with Deep Forest entitled \"Deep Blue Sea\" on their 2002 album, Music Detected; and three collaborations in 2003, including with Italian rock singers Piero Pelù, Serge Lama and Tri Yann.[39] Her duet with Piero Pelù on an Italian-English song entitled \"Amore immaginato [it]\" became a hit in Italy, spending over two months at the top of Italian Airplay Chart, and sung it at Italian Music Awards in 2003.[26]\n\nAnggun participated in two Scandinavian movies: contributing the song \"Rain (Here Without You)\" for Anja & Viktor in 2001, and the entire soundtrack album for Open Hearts in 2002.[16] For Open Hearts, Anggun worked with two Danish producers, Jesper Winge Leisner [da] and Niels Brinck.[40] \"Open Your Heart\" was released as a commercial single from the soundtrack album and charted at number 51 on the Norwegian Singles Chart.[41] It also earned Anggun a nomination for Best Original Song at the Danish Film Academy's Robert Awards in 2003.[42] \"Counting Down\" was also released as a single and became a top-ten airplay hit in Indonesia.[27] Anggun left Sony Music in 2003 due to the company's structural change after a merger with BMG Music. She later moved to Montreal, Canada where she met Olivier Maury, a law school graduate, who became Anggun's manager. In 2004, Anggun and Maury were married in a private ceremony in Bali.[43]\n\nIn 2004, Anggun returned to Paris and landed a new record deal with Heben Music, a French independent label. She began working on her next album with several producers, including Jean-Pierre Taieb and Frederic Jaffre. Anggun, who composed mainly in English, enlisted the help of several well-known French songwriters, such as Jean Fauque [fr], Lionel Florence [fr; es], Tété and Evelyn Kral to adapt her English songs into French.[39] In late 2004, Anggun released her first solo French single in nearly four years, \"Être une femme\", which became Anggun's second top-20 hit in France and her first French single to chart on the Swiss Singles Chart.[44] Anggun's third French album, Luminescence, was released in February 2005.
