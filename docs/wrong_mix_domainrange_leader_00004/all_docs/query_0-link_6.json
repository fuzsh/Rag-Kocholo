        "text": "Eagle, James P(hilip) (b. Aug. 10, 1837, Maury county, Tenn. - d. Dec. 20, 1904, Little Rock, Ark.), governor of Arkansas (1889-93).\n\nEagleburger, Lawrence (Sidney) (b.

Jan. 25, 1935, Alcains, Portugal), president of Portugal (1976-86). He joined the army in 1953 and fought in the colonial wars in Africa. An opponent of Portugal's colonial policies, he supported the 1974 coup that ended the dictatorship. He returned to Portugal from Angola following the coup and served as the Armed Forces Movement's representative to the Portuguese television network. He retained that position until March 1975, when he was implicated in a counter-coup led by supporters of Gen. António de Spínola. Eanes was exonerated after an inquiry. He returned to the military and became an opponent of the nationalization program sponsored by the government of Premier Vasco dos Santos Gonçalves. He was instrumental in suppressing a far-left coup in November 1975 and for this role was promoted from a relatively unknown colonel to army chief of staff in December. On June 27, 1976, General Eanes was elected president. A non-party candidate supported by the Socialists, Popular Democrats, and Social Democrats, he won 61.5% of the vote. He was also chief of the armed forces general staff (1976-81) and president of the Council of the Revolution (1976-82). He was reelected as president on Dec. 7, 1980, with 56.4% of the vote. Legally barred from a third term, he was succeeded in 1986 by his former prime minister Mário Soares. During his presidency, Eanes upheld the new democratic regime amidst the debilitating squabbles of the political parties, and his honesty won him wide popular support. In 1986-87 he was leader of the Democratic Renewal Party.\n\nEardley, Richard R(oy) (b. Dec. 23, 1928, Denver, Colo. - d.

He was a member (1928-32) of the state House of Representatives but entered national politics when he was appointed (1941) to fill a vacant Senate seat after the death of Sen. Pat Harrison. He won election to the seat in 1942. During his long tenure as Democratic senator, he was notable for his staunch opposition to desegregation and became one of the most powerful men on Capitol Hill as chairman of the Judiciary Committee for 22 years, a position he used in killing 127 civil-rights bills. He also served on the Agriculture and Forestry Committee, chaired the Immigration and Naturalization Subcommittee, was adviser to the Senate Appropriations Committee, and in 1972 was elected president pro tempore of the Senate. A staunch anti-Communist, Eastland maintained that Communists had infiltrated civil-rights organizations, and he was ardently in favour of U.S. involvement in Vietnam to \"rattle the teeth of the Reds.\" When it became apparent that he could not rally the black vote for his reelection to the Senate, Eastland retired in 1978.\n\nEastman, (Theophilus) Ernest (b.

August 1591, Stony Stratford, Buckinghamshire, England - d. Jan. 7, 1658, New Haven [now in Connecticut]), governor of New Haven colony (1639-58). He was sent by King Charles I as an agent to the court of Denmark, where he remained several years. When he returned to London from his residence in Copenhagen, he became interested in the settlement of New England. He was one of the original patentees of the Massachusetts Bay Company. Having adopted firm Puritan beliefs, he joined his boyhood friend John Davenport and several Puritan followers in migrating to New England in early 1637. The group arrived in Boston in June, and he was chosen to be a magistrate. But instead of settling in Massachusetts Bay, they determined to establish an independent colony. Accordingly they selected a place called Quinnipiac in April 1638, bought the land from the Indians for thirteen English coats, and named it New Haven. The next year Eaton was elected governor of the colony, and he was reelected annually until his death. In 1643 he became an original commissioner in the New England Confederation, and 12 years later he and Davenport drew up a new legal code for New Haven colony. As governor, Eaton also became involved in various mercantile endeavours, some of which provoked tensions with the Dutch in neighbouring New Netherlands, but he soon abandoned them for agriculture.\n\nEbaka, Jean-Michel (b. 193... - d.

Feb. 2, 1915, Cape Town, South Africa - d. Nov. 17, 2002, Petah Tikva, near Tel Aviv, Israel), foreign minister of Israel (1966-74). Brought up in England, he used the surname of his mother's second husband Isaac Eban. In 1946 he worked with the Jewish Agency as a political information officer to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He also served as the liaison officer with the UN Special Committee on Palestine in 1947 and as a member of the delegation to the General Assembly that played a critical role in the passage of the UN resolution to partition Palestine. He adopted his Hebrew name Abba soon after Israel's independence in 1948. When the new state was admitted to membership in the UN in 1949, he became its permanent representative, and from 1950 he served concurrently as ambassador to the United States. He held both posts until 1959 when he was first elected to the Knesset and became a minister without portfolio. He was minister of education and culture in 1960-63 and deputy prime minister in 1964-65. As foreign minister, he sought to strengthen relations with the U.S. and to bring about Israeli association with the European Economic Community. When Israel was threatened with an Arab blockade in May 1967, he traveled to Paris, London, and Washington to seek a peaceful solution. When diplomacy proved fruitless, he supported the military decisions in the Six-Day War. His eloquent defense of Israel's actions before the UN Security Council and General Assembly was widely admired. He sat in the Knesset as a member of the Labour Party until 1988. He came out in favour of the establishment of a Palestinian state and berated right-wing Israeli politicians for believing they could hold onto the lands occupied in the 1967 war.\n\nEbanks, Donovan (W.F.)

He was also minister of cabinet affairs and administrative development (1984-93), minister of the public business sector (1993-99), and minister of state for administrative development and environment affairs (1993-97). He kept the business portfolio, in which he spearheaded Egypt's privatization program, until Pres. Hosni Mubarak, on beginning a new six-year term, appointed him prime minister.\n\nEbels, Edzo Hommes (b. June 20, 1889, Nieuw Beerta, Groningen, Netherlands - d.

June 23, 1870, near Karlstad, Värmland, Sweden - d. Dec. 6, 1944, Savage, Minn.), governor of Minnesota (1909-15).\n\nEberlein, Werner (b. Nov. 9, 1919, Berlin, Germany - d. Oct. 11, 2002, Berlin), first secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Magdeburg district (1983-89). He was best known to East Germans as the chief interpreter and adviser during the rule of Walter Ulbricht, under whose government the Berlin Wall was built. He served on the Politburo in the 1980s, and was accused after German reunification in 1990 of manslaughter for failing to act against the \"shoot to kill orders\" issued to border guards. Eberlein, seriously ill and wheelchair-bound for 11 years, was never prosecuted.\n\nEbert\n\nEbert, Friedrich (b. Feb. 4, 1871, Heidelberg [now in Baden-Württemberg], Germany - d. Feb. 28, 1925, Berlin, Germany), president of Germany (1919-25). In 1905 he became secretary general of the German Social Democratic Party, and he succeeded August Bebel as party chairman in 1913. On the day of the revolution when Emperor Wilhelm II abdicated (Nov. 9, 1918), Prince Max of Baden asked Ebert to replace him as chancellor. Ebert, who still hoped to establish a regency for the emperor, actually held office as chancellor for one day. On November 10 he set up an entirely Socialist government. Calling itself the Council of People's Representatives, the government derived its authority from the Workers' and Soldiers' Council, which claimed to speak for Germany and the German Republic but had been elected rather arbitrarily by the factories and regiments of Berlin alone. Ebert was determined to place power in the hands of a freely elected German parliament as soon as possible. Following the elections of January 1919, he was elected the first president of the republic. When, in January 1923, Germany was declared in default of coal deliveries under the reparations provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, France, wishing to settle the reparations question decisively, occupied the Ruhr territory. Ebert, like nearly all Germans, supported national resistance and the general strike in the Ruhr, which was directed toward ending foreign military control. But Germany suffered as a result of the strike. Inflation assumed staggering proportions, and the country experienced its most severe social and political crisis. Adolf Hitler nearly succeeded in seizing power in Bavaria. Chancellor Gustav Stresemann brought the crisis under control, yet much of the German right persisted in its defamation of Ebert. He died in office.\n\nEbert, Friedrich, byname Fritz Ebert (b. Sept. 12, 1894, Bremen, Germany - d. Dec. 4, 1979, East Berlin, East Germany), lord mayor of East Berlin (1948-67) and acting chairman of the Council of State of East Germany (1973); son of Friedrich Ebert (1871-1925).\n\nÉboué\n\nÉboué, (Adolphe) Félix (Sylvestre) (b. Dec. 26, 1884, Cayenne, French Guiana - d. May 17, 1944, Cairo, Egypt), French colonial administrator. He was first sent to Oubangui-Chari (now the Central African Republic), where he spent most of his career. During an extended leave in the early 1920s, he broadened his contacts with leaders in France, including Blaise Diagne, the first African deputy to the French National Assembly. Although he eventually reached the rank of administrator in chief in 1930, his promotions were slow - not because of his being black, he believed, but because of the low status of Africa and its administrators in the French colonial empire. He served as acting governor of Martinique (1933-34) and of French Sudan (1935) and finally in 1936 he was made a full governor in Guadeloupe, becoming the first black man to reach the highest level of the French colonial administrative system. In Guadeloupe he introduced many reforms associated with the Popular Front government in France, but he also made enemies there who probably influenced his transfer in 1938 to Chad, one of the poorest countries in Africa. As chef de territoire there (1939-40) he became the key figure in rallying to Gen. Charles de Gaulle that strategically located colony as well as all of French Equatorial Africa. This step enabled a French army to be formed under Gen. Jacques Leclerc, who later led it across 1,600 km of desert to make contact with the British 8th Army in Libya. In return, de Gaulle named Éboué governor-general over the entire federation (1940) and further honoured him in 1944 by holding the Brazzaville Conference (to discuss postwar colonial reforms) in his capital; he died a few months later. In 1949 he became the only black to be buried in France's Panthéon of heroes in Paris. His widow Eugénie Éboué-Tell (1891-1972) was elected a French deputy and senator from Guadeloupe.\n\nEbouka-Babackas, Édouard (b.

Nov. 5, 2006, Ankara, Turkey), prime minister of Turkey (1974, 1977, 1978-79, 1999-2002). He was elected to parliament as a Republican People's Party (RPP) member for Ankara (1957, 1961) and Zonguldak (1965, 1969). He was minister of labour in 1961-65 and in 1966 he became secretary-general of the RPP under Ismet Inönü, whose cooperation with the country's military government he opposed. He became RPP chairman in 1972 and prime minister in 1974. He declared an amnesty for all political prisoners and authorized (July 20, 1974) Turkey's military intervention in Cyprus after the Greek-led coup on that island. His request for a vote of confidence from the parliament in September 1974 failed. After further crises in 1977, during which he briefly formed a government, he was again prime minister in 1978, but acute economic and social difficulties led to the fall of this government in 1979. After a military coup in 1980 he was in detention and charged with \"acts of treason\" for failing to prevent nationwide street violence between the left and the right that led to the military intervention. He was imprisoned three times for continuing his political activities despite the ban, mainly through his wife Rahsan (1923-2020), a political force in her own right, who formed the Democratic Left Party (DSP) in 1985 and led it until 1987 reforms allowed him back into politics. In June 1997 he became deputy prime minister under Mesut Yilmaz and after the Yilmaz government was overturned on corruption allegations, Ecevit became prime minister again. His popularity was boosted in 1999 by the capture of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Öcalan. In 2002 he became ill but resisted calls for his resignation, and his party was obliterated in elections.

July 8, 2022, Cuernavaca, Mexico), president of Mexico (1970-76). He became the private secretary of the president of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in 1940. He rose rapidly in political circles and held several important posts in government and the PRI, including director of press and propaganda and president of the Federal Electoral Commission. In 1957 he became minister of education, in 1958 subsecretary of the interior, and in 1964 Pres. Gustavo Díaz Ordaz appointed him secretary of the interior, a post he held until November 1969. He was severely criticized for his harsh handling of the 1968 student demonstrations that culminated in the \"Tlatelolco massacre,\" in which more than 300 demonstrators were killed or wounded and thousands arrested. After becoming president, he moved sharply to the left, releasing most of the prisoners arrested in 1968, redistributing millions of acres among the landless peasantry, expanding social security, housing, and transportation programs, and pouring huge sums of money into public works. Reversing an earlier stand, he introduced a national family planning program to reduce population growth. His administration was plagued by runaway inflation, high unemployment, and illiteracy, and his leftist economic proposals alienated business interests, causing reduced domestic investment. A declining balance of trade forced the devaluation of the peso by 50% in 1976, producing insecurity and antagonism among his middle-class supporters. In foreign policy, he opened diplomatic relations with China and supported Latin American solidarity. He served as ambassador to Australia and New Zealand (1977-80) under his successor, Pres. José López Portillo. In 2004 a judge rejected a request for Echeverría's arrest on charges of genocide for allegedly ordering the killing of student demonstrators on June 10, 1971. On June 30, 2006, however, he was placed under house arrest on charges relating to his involvement in the 1968 massacre; he was released in 2009.\n\nEcheverría Castellot, Eugenio (b.

Sept. 28, 1949, Beirut), prime minister (1929-30) and president (1936-41, 1943) of Lebanon. A leading Maronite advocate, he became a senator in 1926 and as president it fell to him to sign the treaty with France ending the mandate. At the time of his death he was head of the National Bloc.\n\nEddé, Raymond (Émile), Arabic Raymun (Imil) Iddi (b. March 15, 1913, Alexandria, Egypt - d. May 10, 2000, Paris, France), Lebanese politician; son of Émile Eddé. His family had fled to Egypt after being condemned to death by the Ottoman authorities in the waning years of the empire. The family returned to Beirut in 1920. He succeeded his father as head of the National Bloc. A Christian, Eddé was a moderate who advocated coexistence with other political and religious groups in Lebanon. Eddé represented the Byblos district north of Beirut in the Lebanese parliament from 1953 to 1976, except for a one-year absence in 1964. He ran unsuccessful presidential campaigns in 1958 and 1976 and held various cabinet positions, including minister of interior, social affairs, and posts and telegraphs (1958-60) and of public works and agriculture (1968-69). Eddé went into self-imposed exile in 1976 after surviving three assassination attempts.

March 17, 1722, Eden House, North Carolina), governor of North Carolina (1714-22). He spent most of his appointed term as governor attempting to curb the threat of pirates, the most powerful of which at this time was Edward Teach (\"Blackbeard\"). Eden offered him the royal pardon if he would give himself up, whereupon he surrendered with twenty of his followers, but he soon returned to his old habits. Eden was rumoured to have a close personal relationship with Blackbeard and to have shared in his loot. Edward Mosely, a prominent colonist, declared that the governor could raise an armed posse to arrest honest men, but could not raise a similar force to apprehend Teach. For his accusations, Mosely was arrested, fined £100, and debarred from holding office for three years. Teach took over an island on the Carolina coast and set himself up as almost a prince, taxing the traders throughout his realm. The Carolinians despaired of help from their own governor, and got a small army from the governor of Virginia which killed Blackbeard in 1718. In 1719 Eden gave to the council a full account of his dealings with the pirate, which was approved by them. In 1718 Eden had been made landgrave of Carolina, a hereditary nobility provided for in the Fundamental Constitutions, written for the colony by John Locke.\n\nEdén, Nils (b.

Oct. 31, 1937, Norfolk Island), acting administrator of Norfolk Island (1928, 1929).\n\nJ. Edgar\n\nEdgar, Jim, byname of James Edgar (b. July 22, 1946, Vinita, Okla.), governor of Illinois (1991-99). The Republican won a seat in the state legislature in 1976, and in 1981, Gov. James Thompson appointed him secretary of state, where he garnered attention by pushing through an anti-drunk-driving law. In 1990, Edgar ran to succeed Thompson, with strong opposition from Democratic Attorney General Neil Hartigan. Ironically, Hartigan talked of cutting taxes and running government like a business; Edgar promised to make permanent the 1989 tax surcharge for education. Both favored an initiative requiring a 60% state House and Senate vote for a tax increase. Edgar narrowly won, 51%-48%. The first governor since the 1920s to have served in the legislature, he helped Republicans capture the state Senate in 1992. Entering 1994, Edgar did not seem invulnerable. But he won with a record margin, in part because of the issue stands of his opponent, Comptroller Dawn Clark Netsch. A lakefront liberal state senator for 18 years, Netsch proposed a big increase in state income taxes, together with property tax reductions, to finance education. Edgar bragged of increased education funding and a lower-than-national unemployment rate. Edgar won overwhelmingly, carrying 101 of 102 counties (losing one southern Downstate county by 3 votes), and saw Republicans sweep all the statewide offices and capture control of the state House. He entered 1995 in a position of political strength not equalled in the last three generations, hoping to cut state government employment further, implement tort reform, and try further reforms of the welfare system. In March 1995, he signed legislation that eliminated the AFDC program by 1999 and capped other welfare benefits.\n\nEdge, Walter E(vans) (b. Nov. 20, 1873, Philadelphia, Pa. - d.

Graduated from the Military Academy at West Point in 1908 and from the U.S. Army engineering school in 1910, he advanced through the grades to major general in 1942. Edgerton was assistant engineer of the Panama Canal from 1908 to 1909, then he was chief engineer of Alaska Road from 1910 to 1915, director of the War Department Sales from 1921 to 1923, chief of the Federal Power Commission from 1925 to 1929, and assistant professor of the Engineering School of the U.S. Military Academy in 1930. He returned to Panama as Panama Canal maintenance engineer from 1936 to 1940, then he was appointed governor of the Panama Canal Zone. During his tenure, several administrative changes occurred: the organization formerly known as the Bureau of Clubs and Playgrounds was designated the Panama Canal clubhouses; the special construction division and the special engineering division were consolidated under the title of the special engineer division. During his administration, also, the highway and railroad bridge across the canal at the existing Miraflores locks was officially opened to vehicular traffic in 1942, thus providing the first permanent bridge connection between the east and west banks of the canal since the canal was opened in 1914, and the excavation for the third locks project was initiated. Edgerton retired on April 30, 1949.\n\nEdgerton, Sidney (b. Aug. 17, 1818, Cazenovia, N.Y. - d. July 19, 1900, Akron, Ohio), governor of Montana (1864-66).\n\nEdhem Pasha, Ottoman official.

He was also known as an industrialist, being a director (1903-33) and president of the board (1934-49) of the ASEA company.\n\nEdusei, Krobo (b. 1915 - d. Feb. 13, 1984), Ghanaian politician. He belonged to a leading Ashanti family and joined Kwame Nkrumah's Convention People's Party when it was founded in 1949. Imprisoned by the British authorities, he became the party propaganda secretary; then, when Ghana gained independence in 1957, Edusei was appointed minister of the interior. He later became minister of transport and, in 1961, minister of industries. Nkrumah dismissed him in 1962 (when a scandal involving his wife's purchase of a £3,000 bed threatened his reputation) but later in the year brought him back into the government as minister of agriculture, a post he held until 1965, when he became chief of state protocol. After the fall of Nkrumah in 1966, Edusei lost office and in 1968 was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment. After his release he played some part in political affairs through the People's National Party until the fall of Pres. Hilla Limann in 1981 led to a further term of imprisonment. He was released shortly before his death.\n\nEdward VII\n\nEdward VII, in full Albert Edward (b. Nov. 9, 1841, London, England - d. May 6, 1910, London), king of the United Kingdom (1901-10). The second child and eldest son of Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, he was soon after his birth created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester (Dec. 4, 1841). In November 1858 he was made a knight of the garter and a colonel in the army. On March 10, 1863, he married Alexandra, eldest daughter of Prince Christian (later King Christian IX) of Denmark. Five children of this union survived to maturity (George, Duke of York, subsequently King George V, was the second son). The prince became a familiar figure in the sporting world. He was particularly given to racing, yachting, and game-bird shooting. His social activities involved him in several scandals. He succeeded to the throne as Edward VII following Victoria's death on Jan. 22, 1901, and was crowned on Aug. 9, 1902. His reign did much to restore lustre to a monarchy that had shone somewhat dimly during Victoria's long seclusion as a widow. In 1902 he resumed his tours of Europe. His geniality and felicitously worded addresses (conducted in French) during a state visit to Paris in 1903 helped pave the way, by winning popularity among French citizens of all ranks, for the Anglo-French Entente Cordiale of 1904. Relations with his nephew the German emperor Wilhelm II were not always easy, either officially or personally. Although incapable of prolonged mental exertion, Edward was fortunate in his judgment of men. His support for the great military reforms of the secretary of state for war, Richard Burdon (later Viscount) Haldane, and for First Sea Lord Sir John Fisher in his naval reforms did much to avert British unpreparedness when World War I started.\n\nEdward VIII\n\nEdward VIII, also called (from 1936) Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor, in full Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David (known as David within the royal family) (b. June 23, 1894, Richmond, Surrey, England - d. May 28, 1972, Paris, France), king of the United Kingdom (1936). The eldest child of George, Duke of York (later King George V), and Princess Mary of Teck (later Queen Mary), he became heir to the throne on the accession of his father (May 6, 1910), being created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester on June 23, 1910. In 1930 the prince's friendship with Mrs. Wallis Warfield Simpson of the United States began. By 1934 he was deeply in love with her. George V died Jan. 20, 1936, and Edward was proclaimed king. His attempts to gain the royal family's acceptance of Mrs. Simpson, who obtained a preliminary decree of divorce on Oct. 27, 1936, met with firm opposition, backed by the Church of England (of which he was the head) and most politicians in both Britain and the Commonwealth. Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin attempted to impress upon the king the peril to the integrity of the monarchy caused by the private friendship with a divorcée. Discussions of a morganatic marriage were pursued, but on December 2 Baldwin assured him that this was impracticable. It was doomed by being somewhat hurriedly and forcibly put to the dominions and by the explosion of the whole matter in the press and Parliament on December 3. The king submitted his abdication on Dec. 10, 1936, the only British sovereign ever voluntarily to resign the crown. The instrument of abdication was endorsed by Parliament on December 11. The new king, George VI, created his older brother Duke of Windsor (effective March 8, 1937). On June 3, 1937, Edward was married to Mrs. Simpson by a clergyman of the Church of England at the Château de Candé, Monts, France. He was governor of the Bahamas in 1940-45. After 1945 he lived in Paris.\n\nEdward Mutesa\n\nEdward Mutesa II, also called Sir Edward (Frederick William David Walugembe Mutebi Luwangula) Mutesa (b. Nov. 19, 1924, Kampala, Uganda - d. Nov. 21, 1969, London, England), kabaka (ruler) of Buganda (1939-53, 1955-66) and president of Uganda (1963-66). He was the only son of Daudi Cwa II, 35th kabaka of Buganda, by his Christian wife, Irene Drusila Namaganda. During the 1940s Mutesa, called \"King Freddie\" by the Western press, was essentially controlled by the British resident and his katikkiro (prime minister) and was personally rather unpopular. In the \"Kabaka crisis\" of 1953, when loss of the privileged position of the kingdom of Buganda within the protectorate of Uganda seemed imminent, he took an unyielding stand in meetings with the governor of Uganda so as not to alienate his increasingly suspicious and anti-British subjects. His key demands were for separation of Buganda from the rest of Uganda and a promise of independence. When he refused to communicate British formal recommendations to his Lukiko (parliament), he was arrested and deported. Buganda leaders engineered his return in 1955, ostensibly as a constitutional monarch, but one with a great deal of influence in the Buganda government. When Uganda became independent, Prime Minister Milton Obote first hoped to placate the Ganda by encouraging Mutesa's election as president (a non-executive post) in 1963. A conflict over the role and over the continued integrity of the Buganda kingdom within Uganda followed. When he tried to foment discontent between the traditionally stateless northerners and the southern \"kingdom\" members, Obote suspended the constitution. The conflict escalated rapidly, and Mutesa was forced to flee to Britain in 1966, where he died in exile (of alcoholic poisoning, foul play being suspected by some).\n\nEdwardes, George Warren (b. May 28, 1802 - d. Feb. 21, 1879, London, England), governor of Labuan (1856-61).\n\nEdwards, Edward I(rving) (b. Dec. 1, 1863, Jersey City, N.J. - d.

July 12, 2021, Gonzales, La.), governor of Louisiana (1972-80, 1984-88, 1992-96). The Democrat was first elected to Congress after the incumbent was killed in a car accident. A charismatic populist, he was first elected governor in 1972 by a narrow margin over Bennett Johnston and David Treen. Treen succeeded Edwards in 1979, but Edwards came back and beat Treen in 1983, then spent much of 1986 and 1987 under trial for bribery charges. He was acquitted, but suffered significant political damage. In 1987 he was able to win only 28% against Buddy Roemer, and withdrew and left Roemer to win without a runoff. In 1991, he improved only slightly, winning 34% in the primary; both times his platform was vintage Edwards - a state lottery, casino gambling in New Orleans, one-man state budgeting. But the political misfortunes of Roemer and the rally against David Duke returned Edwards to the governorship. In his last term Edwards got the legislature to approve casino gambling in New Orleans, after it already allowed riverboat gambling and video poker. He switched from a flat rate to a percentage tax on oil and gas, started two new Mississippi River bridges, and attracted new business that helped the state grow economically in the early 1990s. He got a larger share of state spending dedicated to education. In June 1994 he announced he was not running again in 1995. He was indicted in November 1998 and convicted in May 2000 of racketeering, extortion, mail and wire fraud, and conspiracy for demanding hundreds of thousands of dollars from applicants for riverboat casino licenses. In January 2001 he was sentenced to 10 years in prison and given a $250,000 fine; his son Stephen Edwards was sentenced to 7 years and fined $60,000.\n\nEdwards, Henry W(aggaman) (b.

June 19, 1983, Jerusalem), Israeli politician. He immigrated to Israel in 1934 and entered politics in 1969 as a Liberal member of the Knesset (parliament). He was a personal friend of Menachem Begin and, after the Likud victory in 1977, was appointed finance minister. Ehrlich implemented policies to encourage private enterprise and reduce government subsidies, but he was blamed for failing to control inflation. In 1979 he became a deputy prime minister, and in 1981 he became minister of agriculture as well and took over responsibility for settlement on the West Bank. But in most respects he was considered a moderate, and it was Ehrlich who led the attacks on former defense minister Ariel Sharon over the latter's conduct of the invasion of Lebanon in 1982. He died in office.\n\nEhrlichman\n\nEhrlichman, John D(aniel) (b. March 20, 1925, Tacoma, Wash. - d. Feb. 14, 1999, Atlanta, Ga.), U.S. political figure. He worked on two unsuccessful campaigns of Richard M. Nixon - the 1960 presidential and 1962 California gubernatorial races - and was a strategist in the successful 1968 presidential campaign, and in 1969 he went to the White House, first as counsel and then as domestic affairs adviser. Along with H.R. Haldeman, Ehrlichman became ensconced as one of Nixon's top advisers; the two became known as the \"Berlin Wall\" because they so successfully shielded the president from unwelcome intrusion. Ehrlichman also formed a group known as the \"plumbers,\" charged with the task of plugging information leaks and obtaining political intelligence. When the plumbers were caught in a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington, the White House immediately engaged in a cover-up. The scandal that ensued when the involvement of Nixon and a number of his aides was uncovered eventually led to the resignation from government of several officials, including Ehrlichman and Haldeman (1973), Nixon's resignation from the presidency (1974), and the conviction (1975) and imprisonment of Ehrlichman and others. He was convicted of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and perjury, also on charges stemming from another break-in. He spent 18 months in prison until being released in April 1978.\n\nEhrnrooth, Leo (Reinhold) (b. March 10, 1877, Helsingfors [now Helsinki], Finland - d.

Eichmann\n\nEichmann, (Otto) Adolf (b. March 19, 1906, Solingen [now in Nordrhein-Westfalen], Germany - d. May 31, 1962, Tel Aviv, Israel), German Nazi official. In November 1932 he became a member of Heinrich Himmler's SS elite organization and from January to October 1934 he was attached to an SS unit at Dachau and then was appointed to the SD central office in Berlin, where he was attached to the section that dealt with Jewish affairs. He advanced steadily in the SS hierarchy and, after the annexation of Austria (March 1938), was sent to Vienna with the mission of ridding the city of Jews. One year later, with a similar mission, he was sent to Prague. When in 1939 Himmler formed the Reichssicherheitshauptamt, Eichmann was transferred to its Jewish section in Berlin. In January 1942, at Wannsee, near Berlin, a conference of Nazi high officials was convened to organize schedules and logistics arrangements necessary to implement the \"final solution\" of the Jewish problem. Eichmann was to coordinate these arrangements; thus, although the fact that the \"final solution\" was mass execution had not become generally known, Eichmann had in effect been named chief executioner. Thereupon he organized the identification, assembly, and transportation of Jews from all over occupied Europe to their final destinations at Auschwitz and other death camps. Following the war, Eichmann was captured by U.S. troops, but in 1946 he escaped from the prison camp. Assuming the name Ricardo Klement, he moved to Argentina in 1950. He was arrested by Israeli secret service agents near Buenos Aires on May 11, 1960; nine days later he was smuggled out of the country and taken to Israel. The Israeli government arranged his trial before a special three-judge court in Jerusalem (April 11-Dec. 15, 1961), and he was sentenced to be hanged.\n\nEichmann, Franz August (b. March 29, 1793, Berlin, Prussia [Germany] - d.

March 24, 1874, Carrù, Piemonte, Italy - d. Oct. 30, 1961, Rome, Italy), president of Italy (1948-55). His career was almost entirely literary and academic until 1919, when he was nominated to the Italian Senate, an honorary body, in which he urged a liberal economic policy, free from protectionism. A staunch anti-Fascist, he fled to Switzerland in 1943, where, along with other exiled Italians, he advocated the idea of a European federation. Returning to Italy in 1945, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Italy. He was a member of the Constituent Assembly (1946-48) and in 1947 became deputy prime minister and minister of the budget, a new post in which he successfully curbed inflation and stabilized the currency. He was totally devoted to his cause during those strenuous times, so much that he would refuse to leave a cabinet meeting for any reason lest in his absence, even for a few minutes, some other minister might suggest a new expenditure which the treasury could not cover. In 1948 he became a member of the Senate of the Italian republic and on May 11 was elected president of the republic. His seven-year term ended in 1955 but, though 81 years of age, he offered himself for reelection. In the event he was overwhelmingly defeated by Giovanni Gronchi. He was then appointed senator for life, although he retired to private life.\n\nL.R. Einaudi\n\nEinaudi, Luigi R(oberto) (b.

March 28, 1969, Washington, D.C.), president of the United States (1953-61). He graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1915. In 1933 he became an aide to Douglas MacArthur, army chief of staff. Eisenhower was made chief of staff of the 3rd Army in 1941. During World War II, he became commander of the Allied forces in Europe (June 1942) and directed the Allied invasions of North Africa (1942) and Italy (1943). As supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, he planned the invasion of Europe that began when he ordered the landing in Normandy (June 1944) and ended after the Allies crossed the Rhine (March 1945), and Germany surrendered in May. He was named chief of staff in November 1945. He directed the demobilization of the wartime army and worked to unify the armed services. In May 1948 he left active duty. In the fall of 1950 Pres. Harry Truman asked him to become supreme commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and in early 1951 he flew to Paris to assume his new position. In June 1952 he retired from the army, returned to the United States, and began his presidential campaign actively. At the Republican convention in July, he won the nomination on the first ballot. His running mate was Sen. Richard M. Nixon of California. Democrats nominated Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson. The Eisenhower-Nixon ticket won handily, carrying 39 states and winning the electoral vote 442-89. In 1956, the Republican convention unanimously endorsed the Eisenhower-Nixon ticket on the first ballot, and Democrats again selected Stevenson. Eisenhower's great personal popularity brought about an even more decisive victory (457-73).\n\n1 Eisenhower's given name at birth was David Dwight, but his mother insisted that he be referred to as Dwight. When Eisenhower registered at West Point on June 14, 1911, as Dwight David Eisenhower the revised order of names had been long in use and may be regarded at that point as having become official.\n\nEisenhower, John (Sheldon Doud) (b. Aug. 3, 1922, Denver, Colo. - d. Dec. 21, 2013, Trappe, Md.), U.S. diplomat; son of Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was ambassador to Belgium (1969-71).\n\nEisner, Kurt (b.

A graduate of the National Defense College, he served as a paratrooper officer in 1956 Sinai campaign and the 1967 Six-Day War, and was a divisional commander on the Golan Heights in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. His tenure as IDF chief of staff (1978-83) was tainted by Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, during which Christian militiamen slaughtered hundreds of Palestinian refugees in camps surrounded by Israeli soldiers. Although censured for indirect responsibility in the incident, he was allowed to serve out his term before retiring from the army. He turned to politics in 1983, founding the Tzomet Party, and was elected to the Knesset in 1984. Known for his bluntness, he once said Arabs should be placed in a bottle like drugged cockroaches. He was agriculture minister in 1990-91, and deputy prime minister and agriculture and environment minister in 1996-99. Thereafter he left politics. Eitan, who was supervising construction of a breakwater at the Ashdod port, drowned after a wave apparently knocked him over.\n\nEitel, Tono, byname of Antonius Eitel (b.

According to the Colombo Telegraph website, she was born as a man, named Sattambige Don Neil Sriyaratne. Sriyaratne (b. 1960?) was in the news in 1997 as being arrested for impersonation, having been named Sri Lanka's female entrepreneur of 1995. Ekanayake would have been the first transgender person not just to hold a Sri Lankan governorship, but probably in any similar position globally. She denied the reports, however, noting she was a married mother of a child.\n\nEkandjo, Jerry (b. March 17, 1947, Windhoek, South West Africa [now Namibia]), home affairs minister of Namibia (1995-2005).

Previously, he served as public health and population minister (1964-65) and labour and social welfare minister (1965-72) in the government of Pres. Ahmadou Ahidjo.

He was elected to parliament in 1990 and 1992, but resigned his seat in protest in 1994 after being cleared of charges that he had stolen and publicized state secrets. He became chairman of the National Democratic Party (NDP) in April 1996. A public opinion poll conducted at the beginning of June 1996 showed 40% of respondents regarded Elbegdorj as the public official they approved of most. He was again elected to parliament in 1996.

His term was cut short by a banking scandal, which resulted in a no-confidence motion. When in 2004 neither the incumbent Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) nor the opposition Motherland Democratic Coalition won enough seats to form a government on their own, both sides agreed to form a \"grand coalition government\" with Elbegdorj as prime minister and MPRP chairman Nambaryn Enkhbayar as parliament speaker.

His rule saw massive battleground defeats in the war with the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which ended with Karabakh Armenians controlling both the province and huge swathes of Azerbaijan proper. Around a million people were made homeless by the conflict and 35,000 people died. Elchibey fled a military revolt in which rogue units marched on Baku in 1993. Heydar Aliyev, then parliamentary speaker, took over as interim leader under the constitution and was then voted in as leader; he soon signed a ceasefire with Karabakh. Elchibey, who spent four years in internal exile in his native village in the country's remote Nakhichevan region before returning to Baku in late 1997, accused Aliyev of usurping power. He and his pro-nationalist Popular Front political movement never recognized his rule.
