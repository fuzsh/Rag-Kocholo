After pro-Independence plays and their songs were banned, and newspaper editors and activist public speakers imprisoned, Indians’ boycott of British goods grew in popularity until–the last straw–the legalization of public floggings of Indian minors. The situation reached its boiling point in 1908 with the bombings of white officials. The Raj responded with increased martial law and intentionally inflaming Hindu-Muslim disunity while keeping the people of England in the dark about what was being done in their name half a world away.\n\nMr. Jeffrey Stanley\n\nPresenter Bio\n\nJeffrey Stanley was a 2018-19 Fulbright-Nehru Research Scholar in India, and serves as a Fulbright Scholar Alumni Ambassador.

Amid poverty and crime, their stories of resilience – and my own harrowing incident – magnified for me the connection between music and the human condition. Today, the words of El Sistema’s founder still guide my work: “reveal to children the beauty of music and music will reveal to them the beauty of life.”\n\nMs. Anne Fitzgibbon\n\nHarmony Program\n\nPresenter Bio\n\nAnne Fitzgibbon is a social entrepreneur with 25 years of experience in arts education, nonprofit leadership, and city government.

There is no doubt that it will be a new experience and an eye-opening moment for them which can shape their future lives too. However, it can also be a challenge for them as they are in a place where the culture is totally different from their home countries. It got even worse when the Covid-19 pandemic occurred and affected many aspects. In this study, there were 15 teachers in educational overseas contexts who have been awarded Fulbright scholarships and taught in their host countries (both from US to other countries and from other countries to the US). By using semi-constructed interviews, they have shared their bittersweet experiences, from adaptation to stress, and burnout to resilience. However, this unique condition did not reduce the fundamental values of the exchange program itself which is still noteworthy for deepening mutual understanding between their homes and host countries.\n\nRobby Anggriawan\n\nIllinois State University\n\nPresenter Bio\n\nRobby Anggriawan got his Fulbright Award in 2018 – 2020 at Illinois State University for Teaching and Learning, Curriculum and Instruction.

Pollutants most commonly monitored by these devices include, but are not limited to, particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) (Karagulian et al., 2019; Rai et al., 2017). There has been a particularly rapid, worldwide growth in ground-based networks of low-cost sensing devices for personal and community air quality monitoring in the past decade (2012-2022). At the same time, unplanned deployment of low-cost air quality sensors across the US has resulted in uneven spatial distribution of sensors, with least deployment (sensors per capita) observed in minority and low-income neighborhoods (deSouza & Kinney, 2021; Mullen, Flores, Grineski, & Collins, 2022). My work is motivated by global and local (US-centric) trends in ‘environmental racism’, defined as; ‘‘any policy, practice or directive that disproportionately affects or disadvantages (with malicious intent or not) individuals, groups, or communities.’ (Bullard, 1993). My research uses data from two sensor deployment experiments conducted in Santa Monica and Pittsburgh with funding from the Pardee RAND Graduate School. My preliminary findings aim to bridge the gap in literature between technical veracity of low-cost sensor data and opportunities and barriers to sensor deployment, access, and use – with a particular focus on their use in environmental justice communities.\n\nJalal Awan\n\nPardee RAND Graduate School\n\nPresenter Bio\n\nJalal Awan (he/him) is a doctoral candidate from Pakistan pursuing his Ph.D. in Policy Analysis at the Pardee RAND Graduate School and working as an assistant policy researcher at the RAND Corporation.

As a Fulbright Exchange scholar, he completed his M.S. in green technologies from the University of Southern California in December 2015. Awan is a member of IEEE, Six Sigma Green Belt from the American Society for Quality (ASQ) and holds the U.S. Green Building Council certification in Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED).\n\nForce-Driven Weave Patterns for Shell Structures in Architectural Design.\n\nSaturday, October 8 – 9:00 AM – 10:50 AM (Poster Presentation in Regency III & IV)\n\nPresentation Abstract\n\nThe use of lightweight carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) in the discipline of architecture opens new possibilities for the construction of architectural components. CFRP has been explored mainly in engineering fields, such as aeronautics, automotive, ballistic and marine engineering. CFRP has also been explored in the discipline of architecture in the construction of shell structures because of its high strength-to-weight ratio and low-cost. There is, however, limited research on how structural analysis can be used to inform weave patterns for shell structures using CFRP. This thesis addresses this gap by contributing a methodology for the creation of CFRP weave patterns from structural analysis and their validation through physical testing.\n\nMr. Khaled Benaida\n\nPresenter Bio\n\nKhaled Amir Benaida, I am an award-winning Architect and Designer.

The Rural Development Agency (RDA) of Laos uses their EmYouth program to empower rural community youth champions in wildlife conservation efforts. Through PYL, EmYouth cohort participants develop mindsets and skill sets to thrive as social innovators and influencers in the field of wildlife conservation regarding public health and illegal wildlife trade. In this study conducted in summer 2022, RDA EmYouth participants completed pre and post surveys for a 30-day PYL experience. The findings report the benefits of the program and provide insights for future testing. PYL is seeking other partners for testing in order to scale the impact of this program.\n\nDr. Marcia J.
