        "text": "In late 1936, two Irishmen arrived in the Spanish Basque Country. One was General Eoin O'Duffy, signing the terms of agreement for an Irish Brigade to support the military uprising against the Second Spanish Republic. Meanwhile, socialist republican George Gilmore journeyed across the Pyrenees in search of a Basque nationalist priest he had met four years earlier. While O'Duffy was drawn into the conflict by traditionalist monarchists from Navarre, his leftist opponents in Ireland mounted a pro-republic propaganda campaign focused on the war effort of the rival Basque nationalists. In effect, a civil war between Basques became entangled with the legacy of the Irish Civil War, as old rivals such as O'Duffy and Gilmore constructed alliances on opposite sides of the conflict as it played out in this small corner of Spain. This article places a new emphasis on the Basque dimension of Ireland's engagement with the Spanish Civil War and illustrates how it was shaped by earlier Basque-Irish relations.\n\n52 While O'Duffy claims that he later requested that this clause be withdrawn (see Crusade in Spain, p. 199), there is no evidence that this was ever formalised, and the Irish Brigade ultimately saw no combat on the Basque front.\n\n61 Pere Soler Parício, ‘Irlanda y la guerra civil española: nuevas perspectivas de estudio’ (Ph.D. thesis, Universitat de Barcelona, 2013), p. 511. According to Seán Cronin, Gilmore's broken leg was the reason why Frank Ryan ultimately led the group of socialist volunteers known as the ‘Connolly Column’ rather than him. Thus, one might say that the notorious Basque weather changed the course of Ireland's involvement in the Spanish Civil War: see Frank Ryan: the search for the republic (Dublin, 1980), p. 83.\n\n77 Irish Times, 18 Jan. 1937. While the Spanish Communist Party (P.C.E.) had fifteen seats in the Spanish parliament, the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party (P.S.O.E.) held ninety-nine and the Republican Left (I.R.) held eighty-seven. Both parties, among others that constituted the Popular Front, might have been distasteful to those whose opinion he sought to sway."
