La Barre de Nanteuil, Luc de (b. Sept. 21, 1925, Lhommaizé, Vienne, France - d. Aug. 14, 2018), French diplomat. He was ambassador to the Netherlands (1976-77) and the United Kingdom (1986-90) and permanent representative to the United Nations (1982-84).

La Borde, Auguste (b. June 10, 1815, Gatteville, Manche, France - d. ...), interim commandant of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon (1863-64).

La Bourdonnais, Bertrand François Mahé, comte de (count of) (b. Feb. 11, 1699, Saint-Malo, France - d. Nov. 10, 1753, Paris, France), French naval commander. He entered the service of the French East India Company as a lieutenant in 1718, was promoted to captain in 1724, and distinguished himself in the capture of Mahé on the Malabar Coast of southwestern India in 1726 so that the name of the town was added to his own. For two years he was in the service of the Portuguese viceroy of Goa, but he returned to French service in 1735 when he became governor of Île Bourbon (Réunion) and Île de France (Mauritius) in the Indian Ocean. His five years of actual administration of the islands was vigorous and successful. With the outbreak of war between France and Great Britain in 1740, he was put in command of a fleet in Indian waters. He saved the French outpost of Mahé and relieved the governor-general of French India, Joseph François Dupleix, at Pondicherry; he defeated British forces in two naval actions. His blockade of Madras by sea enabled the French to capture this important port in September 1746. But he quarreled with Dupleix over the conduct of affairs in India, and Dupleix removed him as governor. He set sail on a Dutch vessel to present his case at court, was captured by the British, but was allowed to return home on parole. Arrested in 1748, he was imprisoned in the Bastille for more than two years on charges of poor administration and embezzlement. He was tried in 1751 and acquitted, largely through pressure of popular opinion.

La Bretèche, François Régis de La Bourdonnaye, comte de (b. March 19, 1767, La Varenne [now part of Orée-d'Anjou, Maine-et-Loire], France - d. July 28, 1839, Drain, Maine-et-Loire, France), interior minister of France (1829).

La Ferronays, (Pierre Louis) Auguste Ferron, comte de (b. Dec. 4, 1777, Saint-Malo, France - d. Jan. 17, 1842, Rome, Papal State [now in Italy]), foreign minister of France (1828-29). He was also minister to Denmark (1817-19) and ambassador to Russia (1819-27) and the Papal State (1830).

P.F. La Follette

La Follette, Philip F(ox) (b. May 8, 1897, Madison, Wis. - d. Aug. 18, 1965, Madison), governor of Wisconsin (1931-33, 1935-39); son of Robert M. La Follette. In 1924-26 he was district attorney in Dane county. He ran five times for the governorship, winning three times. In his first term, as a Republican, he pushed through the legislature the first comprehensive unemployment insurance measure ever adopted by a U.S. state. But the cost of this and other welfare programs led to increased taxation, and the governor's position was further shaken when many of his Democratic supporters followed the leadership of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Former governor Walter J. Kohler rode the crest of a "taxpayer's revolt" that defeated a La Follette in Wisconsin for the first time in 40 years. By 1934 he and his brother Robert M. La Follette, Jr., were convinced that the New Deal was not going to make the basic changes in the structure of American life they thought necessary. The Republican Party, on the other hand, was in their eyes hopelessly reactionary. Consequently they formed a new Progressive Party, and in its first primary Philip was nominated for governor and Robert for reelection as senator. After their dual victory, they were at their peak. In 1936 the new party was the Farmer-Labor-Progressive coalition and as its gubernatorial candidate Philip won a third term. In early 1938 he made a series of radio speeches blasting President Roosevelt and the New Deal. On April 28 he announced the formation of the National Progressives of America. But the pragmatic New Deal had the loyalty of most American liberals who thought La Follette's party was only dividing the left. The governor's own reelection campaign foundered and he was defeated by Julius P. Heil.

R.M. La Follette

La Follette, Robert M(arion), byname Fighting Bob (b. June 14, 1855, Primrose, Wis. - d. June 18, 1925, Washington, D.C.), U.S. politician. He was a district attorney in Dane county (1880-84) and U.S. congressman from southwestern Wisconsin (1885-91) and developed a personality and style that made him a popular leader. He was a Republican but constantly at odds with the leaders of his party. In 1890 he was defeated for reelection in a Democratic landslide. Returning to Madison, he developed the political organization that would allow him to dominate Wisconsin politics until his death. He was elected governor in 1900 and reelected in 1902 and 1904. He was first elected to the Senate in 1905 (serving from 1906 to his death), at a time when that institution was widely believed to be a refuge for millionaires. He acquired instant fame as a new type of senator, one who was not controlled by "the interests," and in his first three years there he achieved the passage of laws aimed against the freight rates, labour policies, and financing practices of the railroads. The high point of his national popularity came in 1909-11 when he emerged as the leader of newly elected and newly converted progressives in Congress. He unsuccessfully ran for the 1912 Republican presidential nomination. In 1917 he was a leader of the anti-war movement. In the 1920s, as labour and farm groups despaired of the conservatism of Democrats and Republicans alike, he was frequently mentioned as a presidential candidate for a third party. Declining the pleas of the Farmer-Labor convention that he run in 1920, he accepted the Progressive Party's nomination in 1924. In the end he carried only the state of Wisconsin, but he placed second in 11 states and polled 4.8 million votes (about one-sixth of the national total).

R.M. La Follette, Jr.

La Follette, Robert M(arion), Jr. (b. Feb. 6, 1895, Madison, Wis. - d. Feb. 24, 1953, Washington, D.C.), U.S. politician; son of Robert M. La Follette. He was elected in 1925 to fill his father's unexpired term in the Senate and was reelected three times thereafter, serving until 1947. He generally supported Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, but fought some of Roosevelt's policies as the road to war, and especially opposed the Lend-Lease Act and the Neutrality Act. A champion of organized labour, he gained national prominence between 1936 and 1940 as chairman of a special Senate investigating committee, commonly called the La Follette Civil Liberties Committee, which exposed techniques used to prevent workers from organizing. He also drafted the congressional reorganization bill of 1946 that streamlined the legislative process in Congress. That same year, though, he was defeated in the Republican senatorial primary by Joseph McCarthy. He died of a self-inflicted bullet wound.

La Grandière, Pierre Paul Marie de (b. June 28, 1807, Redon, Ille-et-Vilaine, France - d. Aug. 25, 1876, Quimper, Finistère, France), governor of Cochinchina (1863-68).

La Harpe, Frédéric César de (b. April 6, 1754, Rolle, Vaud, Switzerland - d. March 30, 1838, Lausanne, Vaud), Swiss politician. Resenting the Bernese administration in his native Vaud, he went to St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1782, finding employment at the Russian imperial court as tutor to the future emperor Aleksandr and his brother Konstantin. After the outbreak of the French Revolution, he began to plot a Vaudois uprising. In 1794 he returned to Switzerland; failing initially to stir up a revolution, he went to Paris, where he sought French assistance. In 1797 he published his anti-Bernese Essai sur la constitution du pays de Vaud ("Essay on the Constitution of the Vaud") and on Dec. 9, 1797, on behalf of a group of refugees from the Vaud and Fribourg, he addressed a petition to the French Directory urging military intervention in Switzerland to secure Vaudois independence. France ensured its protection and the independence of Vaud was declared Jan. 24, 1798. After French troops invaded in March, La Harpe succeeded, with Peter Ochs, in creating a unitary government for Switzerland, and on June 29, 1798, he became a member of the Directory of the new Helvetic Republic. After securing the deposition of Ochs (June 1799), La Harpe sought dictatorial power but was himself deposed in the conservative coup of Jan. 7, 1800. Later, accused of conspiracy against the state and anti-French intrigue, he was forced to flee the country. With the fall of Napoléon in 1814, he secured from his protector and erstwhile pupil, Aleksandr I, a formal promise of Vaudois independence. In 1815 he made representations on behalf of Switzerland and his native canton at the Congress of Vienna. He served on Vaud's legislative council from 1817 to 1828.

Laar

Laar, Mart (b. April 22, 1960, Viljandi, southern Estonian S.S.R.), prime minister of Estonia (1992-94, 1999-2002). Many credit Laar for leading Estonia through lightning economic reforms that won Western praise and ultimately laid the groundwork for rapid economic growth and acceptance to European Union entry talks. But the reforms were tough, and Laar was hurt by murky deals involving the disappearance of millions of rubles meant to go back to Russia after the kroon national currency was launched, and by a multimillion-dollar Israeli arms purchase. In an emotional 1994 no-confidence vote, parliament removed the young historian from office amid opposition accusations of lying to the people. Five years later, he returned to the post, with the tasks of pulling the economy out of a slump and leading the country toward the European Union as his main policy goals. He toned down his free-market rhetoric, agreeing that social problems need more attention. In 2011-12 he was defense minister.

Born into an ancient noble family, he spent a period at court before going to America in 1777, where he fought against the British during the war of independence and became a hero and a friend of George Washington. In 1779 he went to France and helped persuade the French government to send a 6,000-man expeditionary army to aid the colonists. He returned to America in 1780 and, after the war was won, again to France in 1782. A liberal aristocrat, he supported the revolution in 1789 and in the National Assembly presented a draft of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, based on the U.S. Declaration of Independence. He was hailed as "the hero of two worlds." As commander of the newly formed National Guard of Paris, his troops saved Louis XVI and Queen Marie-Antoinette from the fury of a crowd that invaded Versailles on October 6, and he then carried the royal family to Paris, where they became hostages of the revolution. On July 17, 1791, Lafayette's guards opened fire on a crowd of petitioners demanding the abdication of the king, which destroyed his popularity, and in October he resigned from the guard. Hated by the Jacobins for his moderation, a bill of impeachment was passed against him in 1792 after the monarchy was overthrown. He left the country, was captured by the Austrians (then at war with France), and only released in 1797. He returned to France in 1799.

He was a member of the legislature of Saarland in 1970-75 and became a mayor of Saarbrücken in 1974 and that city's lord mayor in 1976. He became minister-president of Saarland after leading the Social Democratic Party (SPD) to an upset victory in the 1985 state election; he held the post until 1998. On Sept. 28, 1990, a congress of the SPD formally nominated him as chancellor candidate for the December 2 elections, the first after German reunification on October 3. The incumbent chancellor, Helmut Kohl of the Christian Democratic Union, campaigned as the "chancellor of unity," basking in the national glory. Lafontaine focused on the cost of unification and was concerned with matters affecting the ordinary citizen. But reunification itself was the dominant issue, and the SPD received only 33.5% of the vote. At the 1995 congress of the SPD, he unexpectedly declared his candidacy for party chairman and succeeded in defeating incumbent Rudolf Scharping. Often depicted as a modern-day Napoleon by cartoonists because of his small, rotund figure, pointed nose, and often superior manner, he brought the notoriously fractious party together and marched it out of the doldrums. Under his leadership, but with Gerhard Schröder as chancellor candidate, the party won the September 1998 elections, and he became finance minister. Britain bristled at his plans to align European tax rates, viewing it as an implied tax hike. "Is this the most dangerous man in Europe?" the tabloid Sun screamed in November 1998. He suddenly resigned from all posts in March 1999, citing the "poor teamwork" in Schröder's cabinet. In 2004 he strongly criticized Schröder's social policies; in 2005 he withdrew from the SPD to become a leading candidate of a new left-wing alliance in the September elections. He became parliamentary co-leader of the Left after the election; in 2007-10 he was co-chairman of the united party The Left. He left the party in 2022.

The following year she was one of the leaders of a two-month strike which paralyzed the Crédit Lyonnais and spread to other banks. She was Lutte Ouvrière's candidate in the 1974, 1981, 1988, 1995, 2002, and 2007 presidential elections.

N. Lamont

Lamont of Lerwick, Norman (Stewart Hughson) Lamont, Baron (b. May 8, 1942, Lerwick, Shetland Islands, Scotland), British chancellor of the exchequer (1990-93). He was elected MP for the London suburb of Kingston-upon-Thames in 1972. He was one of a minority of Conservative MPs to give public support to Margaret Thatcher during her campaign for the party leadership in 1975. She rewarded him with junior posts, first in opposition and then in government. Lamont was appointed financial secretary to the treasury in 1986 - its third-ranking minister. In 1989 Thatcher promoted him to her cabinet, with the job of chief secretary to the treasury, which made him the second-in-command to the chancellor of the exchequer. For the final year of Thatcher's premiership, Lamont worked closely with John Major, his immediate superior. Few were surprised when Major chose Lamont as the manager of his successful five-day campaign for the Conservative Party leadership and then rewarded him with the most important job in his cabinet: chancellor of the exchequer. In his first annual budget in March 1991, he showed boldness when he raised the value-added tax from 15 to 17.5% in order to fund a £140 reduction in each individual's poll tax bill. This move, combined with the government's decision to replace the poll tax from 1993, helped to remove the sting from one of the most disastrous decisions of the Thatcher era. He failed to be reelected to the House of Commons in 1997 and was made a life peer in 1998.

After entering the engineers in 1829, he was sent to Algiers (1830) as a captain in the Zouaves when that corps was first formed. In 1833 he played a prominent role in the creation of the Arab Bureau, which was to coordinate information on French Arab colonies. He distinguished himself at the taking of Constantine in 1837. He was promoted to colonel (1837) and rose rapidly to major-general (1840), lieutenant-general (1841), and general of division (1843). He served as governor-general of Algeria during the incumbent's absence in 1845-47. In France in 1846, he was elected deputy for Sarthe and submitted a plan for free, rather than military, colonization of Algeria. In 1847 he directed the operations which led to the submission of Abd-el-Kader. On Jan. 14, 1848, a month before the revolution in France, he was named Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour. On February 24, in the uniform of a colonel of the National Guard, he tried to stop the insurrection by proclaiming the king's abdication and the regency of the Duchess of Orléans, but the rioters would not listen to him. He served as minister of war (June-December 1848) and was sent on a diplomatic mission to Russia (1850-51). As one of the most conspicuous opponents of the policy of Louis-Napoléon, he was arrested (December 1851) and exiled; he refused to take an oath to the new constitution and was struck out of the French army list. He was allowed to return to France in 1857. In 1860 he took command of the papal troops against Piedmont but was severely defeated at Castelfidardo and returned to France.

Landon

Landon, Alfred M(ossman), byname Alf Landon (b. Sept. 9, 1887, West Middlesex, Pa. - d. Oct. 12, 1987, Topeka, Kan.), U.S. politician. In 1912 he attended the Bull Moose convention of the Progressive Party in Chicago that nominated Theodore Roosevelt for the presidency. He campaigned for Roosevelt in Kansas and his political affiliation remained with progressive Republicanism. He became head of the Republican state organization in 1928 and delivered the largest percentage of any state for Herbert Hoover's election victory. He was elected governor of Kansas in 1932, narrowly defeating Democratic incumbent Harry H. Woodring by 5,637 votes; he was the only Republican gubernatorial candidate west of the Mississippi to win office that year in the wake of the Democratic landslide. Reelected in 1934, he was the only Republican gubernatorial incumbent to win that year. This victory led to the "Landon Boom" and to his presidential candidacy of 1936. Although 16,679,543 Americans voted the Republican ticket, compared with Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt's 27,747,636, Landon won the electoral votes of only Maine and Vermont, giving him only 8 electoral votes to Roosevelt's 523. His two-state victory gave birth to James Farley's wisecrack, "As Maine goes, so goes Vermont" (as opposed to the earlier saying "As Maine goes, so goes the nation"). He never again sought political office but retained an interest in politics and in later years was referred to fondly as the "grand old man of Republican politics." The month before his death, Landon received President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan, who extended their warmest wishes in anticipation of his 100th birthday. Landon's daughter Nancy Landon Kassebaum (from 1996, Nancy Kassebaum Baker) (b. July 29, 1932, Topeka, Kan.) was a Republican senator from Kansas (1978-97).

B. Landry

Landry, (Jean) Bernard (b. March 9, 1937, Saint-Jacques de Montcalm, Joliette region, Que. - d. Nov. 6, 2018), premier of Quebec (2001-03). He first ran for the Quebec legislature in 1970, unsuccessfully, as the candidate of the Parti Québécois (PQ), a movement committed to winning independence for Quebec. He was elected in 1976, when the PQ came to power in the province. He rose rapidly through a number of cabinet posts to become Quebec's minister of finance in 1985. Later that year the PQ lost office, but in 1994 it was returned to power, and Landry was appointed deputy premier under Jacques Parizeau. When Lucien Bouchard took over as premier in 1996, Landry was made finance minister again in addition to the deputy premiership and other portfolios. Reviving the Quebec economy, weakened by years of political uncertainty, and restoring a sound basis to Quebec's public finances were tasks he considered essential to give credibility to Quebec's claims of statehood. His efforts were crowned with success when he balanced the books of the provincial government in 1999 for the first time in many years. He is considered a hardline supporter of independence, in the mould of Parizeau, as opposed to the "go-slow" approach of Bouchard, whom he succeeded as premier in 2001. Landry asserted that Quebec was more than a "distinct society" within Canada; it was a nation that deserved to be recognized as a state. But he had to contend with the province's English-speaking residents and immigrants, who were strongly opposed to separation. Another referendum would have to be held to win the right to negotiate independence (the last one failed in 1995), and he made it clear that a vote would take place only when conditions were ripe for its success. He lost the 2003 election to the Liberals under Jean Charest. In June 2005 he resigned as PQ leader and gave up his seat in the Quebec National Assembly.

Landry, Jeff(rey Martin) (b. Dec. 23, 1970, St. Martinville, La.), governor of Louisiana (2024- ).

G. Landsbergis

Landsbergis, Gabrielius (b. Jan. 7, 1982, Vilnius, Lithuanian S.S.R.), foreign minister of Lithuania (2020- ); grandson of Vytautas Landsbergis.

V. Landsbergis

Landsbergis, Vytautas (Vytautovich) (b. Oct. 18, 1932, Kaunas, Lithuania), Lithuanian politician. He was elected the first chairman of the nationalist organization Sajudis in November 1988. When Lithuania declared independence in March 1990, he was elected president. Moscow's response was to blockade the republic in an attempt to bring it to its knees. The blockade was lifted in June when Lithuania suspended the declaration pending independence talks. Lithuania was in a better position to negotiate independence than the other Baltic republics since only about 20% of the population was non-Lithuanian. He was sharply critical of the U.S., Britain, and other Western nations for their refusal to support self-determination for Lithuanians. It was cold comfort for him that the West saw Mikhail Gorbachev as the leader who was bringing democracy to the Soviet Union. Strengthening Gorbachev would only make it more difficult for Lithuania to break free. Landsbergis' task abroad - for example, he visited Britain in November 1990 and held talks with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher - was to counter the Western belief that Gorbachev was a democrat. In 1991 the Soviet Union recognized Lithuania's independence. In 1992, after Sajudis was defeated in parliamentary elections, he became the leader of the parliamentary opposition.

J. Lang

Lang, Jack (Mathieu Émile) (b. Sept. 2, 1939, Mirecourt, Vosges, France), French politician. In 1977 he was elected a municipal councillor in Paris. He was appointed minister of culture on May 22, 1981. With a style closer to that of the Latin Quarter than the Louvre, he was the most visible symbol of the new Socialist administration. His predecessors may have shunned controversy in a field supposedly above politics, but Lang denounced their culture as elitist and set out to steer it in a popular and Socialist direction. From the start he attacked France's staid cultural institutions, relaxed the government hold on radio and television, and brought cultural life into the workplaces and the provinces. At the same time Lang hoped to restore his country's role as a leader in world cultural life. A report commissioned by his ministry called for measures against the influx of foreign records and deplored U.S. influence on French film, television, and popular music. In December 1983 he toured Brazil as part of an attempt to revive links with Latin America. He stepped up French involvement in third-world cinema, was host to an international conference on "culture and development," and denounced U.S. "intellectual imperialism." He lost his cabinet seat in March 1983, but remained in the government as minister-delegate for culture (1983-84) and then returned to the post of minister of culture (1984-86). He later was minister of culture and communication (1988-92), minister of education and culture (1992-93), and minister of education (2000-02).

D. Lange

Lange, David (Russell) (b. Aug. 4, 1942, Otahuhu, Auckland, N.Z. - d. Aug. 13, 2005, Auckland), prime minister (1984-89) and foreign minister (1984-87) of New Zealand. In North Auckland, he ran unsuccessfully as a Labour candidate for parliament in 1976. He gained nomination to a safe seat in a 1977 by-election, which he won. He immediately made his mark as a quick-witted orator. In 1979 he was elected deputy party leader, just missed election to the top spot in December 1980, and watched Labour narrowly defeated in 1981. Sir Wallace Rowling ceded the party leadership to him in February 1983. He expected to confront Prime Minister Robert Muldoon's National Party in November 1984, but his moment came six months earlier when Muldoon called a snap election. Lange led Labour to a sweeping victory in the July 14 election and was sworn in as prime minister on July 26, becoming the country's youngest prime minister in the 20th century. He fulfilled Labour's campaign promise to deny New Zealand's port facilities to nuclear-armed and nuclear-powered vessels. The ban primarily affected U.S. warships and amounted to a fundamental shift in relations with the United States; New Zealand was effectively excluded from the ANZUS (Australia-New Zealand-U.S.) defense alliance. He was also forthright in confronting France after that nation's agents blew up the Rainbow Warrior, a ship belonging to the environmentalist group Greenpeace, in Auckland harbour. He pressed for an apology and reparations from France for the sinking of the vessel. At home, he initiated radical free-market reforms. The Labour Party won the election of August 1987, and Lange continued as prime minister (also taking the education portfolio) until 1989, when he resigned, citing health reasons. He was attorney general in 1989-90 and remained in parliament until 1996.
