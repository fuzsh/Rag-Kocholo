        "text": "BELMONT, Mass.—Somehow, a photo of Robert Aram Kaloosdian standing before Mount Ararat answers a definable cause.\n\nIt’s as if he were built into the infrastructure, following a lifetime of public service to the Greater Boston Armenian community and the diaspora at large.\n\nHe’s practiced law for more than 50 years and has devoted much of his life to the recognition and study of the Armenian Genocide.\n\nAdd the fact he was founding chairman of the Armenian National Institute and a founder of the Armenian National Assembly, and you may not have even scratched the surface. Maybe touched it.\n\nOf particular note in this Centennial year, Kaloosdian participated in defending a school curriculum guide against genocide deniers in federal court. If it wasn’t the genocide, it’s been his connections with Armenian independence, the Apostolic Church of America and many, many ties with the political elite both here and in Washington.\n\nFinally, after all these years, go ahead and add “author” to his resume. His one and only book is a remarkable and proud testament to his father’s village in Ottoman Turkey, called Tadem.\n\nIt’s a place that bore the brunt of massacre and hardship during the 1915 assault by the Ottoman gendarmes. The book has been a mission in waiting, ever since Kaloosdian’s younger days. He wanted to share the truth with his world, but more important, to give closure to that moment in his dad’s history and the 270 others who were butchered inside this locality.\n\n“It is difficult to understand the extent of the horror that befell such a small farming village by not only its government but also by its neighbors and friends who unquestionably obeyed their government and religious leaders,” Kaloosdian points out.\n\nIn all, 250 Armenian homes were burned, leaving another 100 wounded. His two trips to Tadem have remained etched in his mind. Pathetic yet poignant.\n\nA grandfather of five, Kaloosdian documented the collective memory of anyone and everyone he could reach who lived in this specific region.\n\n“The example that Tadem presents teaches us what a destructive weapon religious hatred and prejudice can be,” he says. “The destruction of a people does not rely on orders coming from a central authority.”\n\nIn his research, Kaloosdian discovers there were people who jumped at the opportunity to terrorize and murder the Armenians of Tadem. He found the origin of the “Armenian problem” not to be the sultan alone—but, rather, the locals who were given positive cover by the Ottoman authorities to subjugate the Armenian population.\n\nThe author tells the individual stories of these Tadem villagers and their extraordinary efforts to survive the genocide that exterminated the majority of this community.\n\nThrough descriptions of his father’s arduous journey from his ancestral homeland across Siberia to Japan, then to Seattle and America’s East Coast, Kaloosdian describes in detail individual choices made by his father as well as other Armenians, Turks, and Kurds.\n\nIn doing so, Kaloosdian effectively clarifies what genocide actually details. It’s a book anyone who knows or doesn’t know Armenia’s history would get to appreciate.\n\nThe jacket pulls the reader inside, showing the village of Tadem in remarkable clarity, done in color. A mere look would entice any reader to consider a possible visit.\n\nOver the next 300 pages, you get an overview of life in this town, its people and its history. It is not Erzurum or Van, Bitlis or Dikranagert. It is Tadem, and you may not have heard about this place had it not been for Kaloosdian’s dad Boghos. He dedicated this work to his beloved “Hairig.”\n\nCovered inside the contents is a rich repository of information that puts the reader right into the thrust of history, beginning with a Tadem childhood to its Educational Society, the deportation of women in this village, and the massacre of remnants.\n\nIt continues with Boghos’s journey to America, a retreat through chaos and revolution, and hits upon life in America—the early days, the foundry where he worked, the club he frequented and the people he befriended.\n\nYou’re about to revisit that devastating hurricane in 1938 that uprooted Watertown where he lived, and finally, a postscript of the destinies of Tadem survivors.\n\nIt’s a crossover between East and West—immigrant to citizen. Maps, testaments, and interviews make this a poignant read. It’s a work that probably wrote itself with Aram’s initiative.\n\nOne striking section of the book is about the women who survived the July 1915 deportation. I was particularly enamored by the immigration struggle; they were like so many others who came to America and cultivated a dream.\n\nOut of it came a son named Robert Aram who was encouraged to get an education and found his way to law school and ultimately success. We owe our survivors a debt of gratitude for their sacrifice, foresight, and resilience. Education was their mantra.\n\nWe owe the Boghoses of the world our survival, our success. This book is about Tadem. In fact, it’s about any village facing a cloud of despair and seeing the sun shine through on a tragic history that has since turned notable.\n\nWe applaud such an inspiring book.\n\nThe post Kaloosdian Hits Home with ‘Tadem’ Book appeared first on Armenian Weekly.\n\nPASADENA, Calif.—You’re three weeks away from your first trip to Historic Armenia, flying to Istanbul aboard a Turkish airliner from Boston, and news bulletins are reporting the upheaval in the country. Any cause for alarm?\n\nNot if you’re Matthew Karanian, a published author, and photographer whose book Historic Armenia has won its share of fan approval. Karanian focuses on Western Armenia after 100 years, giving particular notice to Ani, Kars, and the six Armenian Provinces.\n\nHe’s faced a number of obstacles during his various pilgrimages abroad.\n\nBut virtually nothing stands in his path to capture a worthy image.\n\n“Remember that I went to Van alone in 1997 when the PKK was shooting down Turkish military helicopters. By comparison, conditions today are mostly calm, mostly everywhere,” he vividly recalls.\n\nBy all standards, Karanian and other repeat visitors wouldn’t renege on a trip planned by Armen Aroyan, a veteran tour guide and Anatolian missionary. Everyone’s safety would be Aroyan’s utmost concern and any potential risk would be taken into consideration.\n\nA terrorist attack three weeks prior in Istanbul would result in increased security, insiders tell us.\n\n“Nevertheless, I would advise caution near the Turkish-Syrian frontier,” Karanian adds. “And I would avoid crowds and try not to offend anyone. It’s kind of like the advice I might give to someone who was planning to visit Los Angeles.”\n\nAs to what one might anticipate upon a maiden trip to Turkey, Karanian shares some of his own insight. Over the course of six trips, experience breeds knowledge.\n\n“Expect to be simultaneously angry and happy, angry and confused, angry yet proud,” he maintains. “The anger will diminish. With time, you might even be able to calm down enough to take some photographs and write about the place.”\n\nKaranian added, “Don’t expect a uniform attitude from the people you meet throughout today’s Turkey. You may encounter some coolness and even mild hostility in conservative regions such as Erzerum. But warm hospitality is the norm in the region of Van.”\n\n“Anticipate that Kurds in the rural eastern provinces will have a better understanding of Armenian history than will Turks living in the modern western region,” Karanian continued. “Don’t be surprised if everything reminds you of Armenia.”\n\nMy two trips to Eastern Armenia were both dynamic experiences. My first to Historic Armenia was now being made with some trepidation, given the potential risk and heartbreak. A chance to visit the homeland of my ancestors and walk the streets of my parents, though, was all too enticing.\n\nNo doubt, Van remains foremost on Karanian’s itinerary—the region, town, and lake. His favorite cat? Why, the Van cat of course!\n\nHe was a reluctant traveler to Adana and then to Van in 1997. Karanian had been working in Yerevan as a university professor when two of his Armenian-American friends decided to get married in Sis, the old Armenian capital located just north of Adana in today’s Turkey.\n\nHe knew Adana only as the site of the 1909 massacre of some 20,000 Armenians. The town was not on his radar. But he was in a wedding party, so…\n\n“I had no choice but to go,” he recalled. “It was a good choice for many reasons. Among them, this book might not otherwise exist. This was my first-ever journey to Historic Armenia.”\n\nOver the next 18 years and 6 trips, Karanian eventually traveled to all 6 provinces of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n“These six provinces are on the lands of Historic Armenia,” he points out. “They were home to a plurality and sometimes a majority of Armenians as recently as a century ago.”\n\nThe book was a tribute to his grandmothers and the many others who left their homeland behind a century ago. Karanian delves into the regions of Kharpert, Sebastia, Diyarbakir, Erzerum, Bitlis, and Van—places all included in a typical itinerary.\n\nSeeing the majestic church at Akhtamar, which was turned into a museum with a Turkish flag fluttering outside, might send palpitations to the heart. Karanian has mixed emotions about the landmark attraction.\n\n“Akhtamar simultaneously elicits joy and anger for me,” he reveals. “In that regard, the church is not unique among the Armenian sites of Western Armenia.”\n\nKaranian goes on to say that in Western Armenia, nothing disappoints, yet everything is disappointing.\n\n“It’s a difficult trip to make,” he notes. “Once you begin, don’t be surprised if you find your journey never ends.”\n\nKaranian is a second-generation Armenian American who practices law in Pasadena. He has worked in Armenia as an associate dean of the law program at the American University of Armenia. He was director of the university’s Legal Research Center and founded the Armenian Law Review in 2003 with his students.\n\nSince 1995, his research has taken him on journeys throughout Eastern and Western Armenia—from Artsakh to Javakh, Ani to Cilicia.\n\nA previous book, Edge of Time: Traveling in Armenia and Karabagh, was the world’s first commercial guide to the two republics. A year later, it was reprinted, due to popular demand.\n\nIn 1999, he collaborated with Robert Kurkjian to publish Out of Stone, an oversized hard cover photography book featuring the sites and people of Armenia and Artsakh.\n\nThe most recent work of Historic Armenia has gathered a lot of media hype. At a book signing and lecture in Washington, D.C. this past May, the response was overwhelming.\n\n‘Im Armenia’ and ‘Exploring Yerevan’ Make the City Fun for All Ages\n\nThe Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU) recently announced the launch of “Im Armenia” (My Armenia), a new travel app that takes children on a virtual journey through Yerevan and its surroundings. “Im Armenia” is the first travel guide to introduce children to the sites of Armenia in a fun and interactive way.\n\n“Im Armenia” teaches basic vocabulary words in Eastern Armenian and offers easy-to-navigate maps and colorful graphics of some of the country’s most popular tourist attractions, including Holy Etchmiadzin, the Matenadaran, Sardarapat, and Cascade. Users can take their own pictures, select photos from the gallery, and write their thoughts in a journal at each location.\n\nThe app can be used by children of all ages to prepare them for their trip to Armenia, to keep them engaged on their trip, and to spark curiosity about the country. “We just took our kids to Armenia for the first time and they loved using ‘Im Armenia’! They loved setting up their profile and reading about each site before getting there. It was fun and exciting for them to find some of the hidden symbols at each site,” said Maria Stepanian, a mother of children ages 11 and 14.\n\nDesigned for both iPhone and iPad, “Im Armenia” is available for download through the App Store for Apple devices and Google Play for Android devices. The app is currently available in English; plans are in the works to develop versions in French, Spanish, and other languages of the diaspora.\n\n“This beautifully illustrated app offers many ways to learn about Yerevan. We have plans to expand outside of the city and into the diverse regions of Armenia with future versions,” said Natalie Gabrelian, director of scholarships and alternative education at AGBU.\n\n“Im Armenia” is part of AGBU Education Innovation, a series of quality Armenian e-products for children, parents, and teachers that strives to make educational apps, e-books, and online language courses readily available to all. Earlier this year, AGBU Education Innovation released Exploring Yerevan: A Look Inside the City’s Past & Present, the second in its series of interactive e-books by the Armenian Virtual College (AVC).\n\nThe pioneering multimedia e-book series is designed to offer historical, social, and demographic information to readers interested in visiting Yerevan or learning about the city. The e-book offers a variety of information, ranging from city tours and hikes to cultural and social events. Videos, interactive maps, virtual visits, picture galleries, 3D and panoramic images and puzzles are used to introduce readers to the city and its surrounding areas.\n\n“With a groundbreaking presentation and a fresh wave of information, the Exploring Yerevan e-book is a perfect resource for anyone who wants to make the most out of their visit to Yerevan and learn about one of the oldest cities in the world. I am sure this book will acquire a broad readership and will contribute to making Yerevan one of the best touristic destinations in the world,” said Dr. Yervant Zorian, AVC founder and president.\n\nThe English version of the e-book will be accompanied by Eastern Armenian, Western Armenian, Russian, French, Spanish, and Turkish translations. Exploring Yerevan is preceded by the first AGBU AVC e-book, The Armenian Highland, released in 2014. Both books are available for free download and online browsing on computers and mobile devices through the Apple iBook store, the AVC website, and AGBU online bookstore.\n\nFor more information on Im Armenia, visit http://www.imarmenia.org.

That’s the ongoing tension in humanitarianism photography. … As viewers, part of the response we have is monetary, we want to do something to mitigate the suffering. But we also have to think about our own ethical positioning.”\n\nBalakian’s essay argues, among other things, that the Armenian Genocide gave rise to a visual culture of complexity defined by a salient contrast between the ad hoc images taken by non-professional eye witnesses during the genocide and the highly produced and scripted images for mass audience appeal taken by and for the Near East Relief during the period of the campaign of relief and rescue in the years following World War I. The essay features six important images.\n\nBalakian writes, “The two segments of visual culture in the Armenian case might be said to move from the raw to the cooked, and in doing so show us how the commercialism of a religious humanitarian movement articulates its visual project in contrast to the raw images taken of that same historical event under different conditions during the period of mass killing.”\n\nBalakian is Donald M. and Constance H. Rebar Professor at Colgate University.

Of those, she recorded one that, to this day, takes the breath away of those who are fortunate enough to hear it, across nationalities and languages. Her “Groung” (“Kroonk” in modern transliteration) is among the most stunning vocal performances made in the United States or elsewhere, and likely among the best-selling performances of Armenian-language music before World War II. And yet, little is known of the artist responsible for it.\n\nBorn in Bardizag (present-day Bahçecik, Turkey) on June 7, 1891, she emigrated to the U.S. in April 1896 and married the photo-engraver Aram Sarkis Panosian, 12 years her senior. She lived in Brookline, Mass., from 1908 until at least 1920. She is said to have toured with the great tenor and student of Komitas Vardapet, Armeneg Chah-Mouradian, in the late 1910’s to raise funds for Armenians. She was in Washington, D.C. in February 1920 at a benefit for the Near East Relief Campaign. She applied for a passport that same year, at age 29, to visit France to study, to Italy to see her brother, and to England and Egypt to “locate lost relatives.” Her application gives her height as 5’5″, her mouth as “medium,” chin as “round,” hair as “dark,” face as “round,” and nose as “straight.”\n\nRobert Karayan has noticed that she was profiled, in photo only, in an edition of “Hai Guine” (Armenian Woman), the first feminist bi-monthly journal of Istanbul, founded, published, and edited by Hayganouche Mark from 1919-33. Panosian and her then-14-year-old daughter returned through Ellis Island two and a half years later on Jan. 23, 1924, from the port of Cherbourg, France, to her husband at 520 E. 183rd St. in Manhattan. A few years later, she made another trip with her daughter Adiena (or Adrina), then still single at 22, and returned to New York through Gibraltar.\n\nAnd that, for the moment, is where her story seems to leave off. She died in 1986. However, I own two copies of her sublime masterpiece, and each are totally different takes—in different keys and one featuring bird-sound effects. Both are identical in every way visually, with the same catalogue and matrix numbers stamped into the shellac discs. Why would two different takes exist that appear to be identical? My theory, and it’s only a theory, is that Columbia sold so many copies of it that they wore out the original metal parts—the “stampers,” they’re called—and had to revert to an unissued “take” of the performance to keep up with demand for the recording. I do not know which is the first take released, and I do not know at present whether there is a third take in circulation. The recording stayed in print from its 1917 release until Columbia records deleted its Armenian-language recordings in 1931.\n\nAnd why would they have to keep a performance of a classically trained Armenian-language performance in print for more than a decade? Why would it have been so popular? For two reasons, I think. First, because the performance is so incredibly powerful. And second, because the lyrics, speaking to the loss and bewilderment and frustration of the Armenian-American Diaspora, were expressed so clearly to its listeners.\n\n“Crane, where are you coming from? I am servant of your voice. Crane, have you not news from our country? Hasten not to your flock, you will arrive soon enough! ”\n\nAnd yet, for nearly a hundred years, nothing has been written about this great artist and performer. It is, to me, amazing and terrible. It speaks to the core of not only the American or the Armenian but the human question: What is the nature of remembering? How could such a beautiful thing be left behind?\n\nYou can hear Zabelle’s “Groung” here:\n\nClick here to view the embedded video.\n\nContact the author at inagoski@gmail.com.\n\nSix years ago, when Publish America agreed to print Giants of the Earth, it culminated a personal project that took me on a 1969 mission into Turkish-occupied Western Armenia in search of an aunt lost in the 1915-23 genocide.\n\nIt was a mission of tragedy knowing that just 50 years earlier historic Armenia had been under the assault of the genocide-driven Ottoman-Turkish government.\n\nMy aunt died six years before I prayed at her mountaintop gravesite in Keghi province, overlooking a tributary of the Euphrates River.\n\nWhile encouraged to complete the memoir that remained unfinished after nearly four decades, it was at the urging of my late cousin, Rev. Vartan Kassabian, that I was inspired to complete the dormant project into published book format for future family generations.\n\nWhen the Baltimore publishing firm was absorbed last year by America Star Books, the 160-page memoir was temporarily shelved by the new company until recently. Thanks to the new publishing outlet, Giants of the Earth was placed on its online bookstore, citing generated public awareness and global interest in the 100th observance of the Armenian Genocide.\n\nThe genocide issue was addressed by Pope Francis of the Roman Catholic Church along with many world leaders who called on Turkey to recognize the Ottoman-Turkish genocide that resulted in the massacre of more than 1.5 million Armenians.\n\nMy mission took me to Sepastia, Erzerum, Lake Van, Bitlis, Moush, Bingol, Keghi, Khoops, Malayta, and Kharpert, and through the Pontic-Manzur mountains and across the Mourad River.\n\nWith the help of Kerrin Wuchter, a special services coordinator at Star Books, interested readers can now acquire Giants of the Earth by visiting http://www.americastarbooks.net/9781615820009.html.\n\nIn addition to Kerrin’s assistance, my longtime friend Hrayr Toukhanian, the noted film director and producer of “Assignment Berlin,” a docu-drama on the assassination of Talat Pasha, regrouped my previously produced 32-minute video encompassing my mission into barren Western Armenia. Without the support of Star Books Publishing and Toukhanian, this renewed project would not have seen the light of day. The abridged video can be viewed by going online to restored linkage: https://youtu.be/AiNDannZYRU\n\nHrayr’s film features the assassination of the despot Turkish Minister of the Interior Talat Pasha. It premiered here in 1982 at the Masonic Temple—focusing on the ARF’s assignment to Soghomon Tehlirian that he kill the mastermind of the Armenian Genocide. Avenger Tehlirian gunned Talat down on the streets of Berlin on March 17, 1921.\n\nThe 1982 produced movie on the killing of Talat was the first to show the story to public audiences on the silver screen and later developed as a full-length video.\n\nThe entire filming and production of “Assignment Berlin” took place in Detroit.\n\nNotables who have read Giants of the Earth and praised it include University of Michigan Professor Dennis Papazian, a former national grand commander of the Knights of Vartan; John Evans, former ambassador to Armenia; and U.S. Senator Carl Levin. In a speech on the Senate floor, the Michigan senator said that anyone who denies that Ottoman Turkey carried out a genocide “should read Giants of the Earth. It was genocide.”\n\nMitch Kehetian is a retired editor of the Macomb Daily and former board trustee at Central Michigan University.\n\nGoodbye, Antoura\n\nBy Karnig Panian\n\nTranslated by: Simon Beujekian\n\nStanford University Press, Redwood City (April 8, 2015)\n\nISBN 978-0804795432; Hardcover, 216 pages, $25.00\n\nSpecial for the Armenian Weekly\n\nWhen discussing the significance of publications about the Armenian Genocide during the Centennial year of the crime, it is vital to understand the importance and sheer value of memoirs and first-hand accounts of the time. Though often harrowing to get through, genocide memoirs prove to be important reading to those attempting to get a better understanding of the crime.\n\nSurvivor accounts not only allow readers to get an in-depth look at a genocide, but can also be interpreted as acts of resistance against the attempt at annihilation.\n\nThe year 2015 saw the publication of Karnig Panian’s story in English. Panian was a long-time educator and the vice-principal of Beirut’s Armenian Lyceum (Djemaran). Published twice previously in its native Armenian by the Hamazkayin Press and the Armenian Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia, the English translation of Goodbye, Antoura was published by Stanford University Press in April. Skillfully translated by Simon Beujekian, who translated Malkhas’s classic Armenian novel Awakening (“Zartonk”), which was recently published, the publication of Goodbye, Antoura makes Panian’s story available to a wider, English-speaking audience for the first time—something that was long overdue. With this publication, Panian’s story is added to a long list of survivor memoirs, which serve as historical proof in the face of the continued denial of the Armenian Genocide.\n\nThrough Prof. Keith Watenpaugh’s introduction and afterword, readers are able to place Panian’s story in the greater context of the Armenian Genocide and World War I, while Dr. Vartan Gregorian’s heartfelt foreword outlines the significance of the memoir as a way to never forget the suffering genocide survivors endured.\n\nPanian was born in Gurin (presently Gürün, Turkey) in 1910. Early on in the book, the reader is transported to Panian’s world of cherry trees and childhood bliss in his native village, a prosperous land of hardworking people and a thriving family. Panian’s descriptions of pre-1915 Gurin is nothing short of paradise: a Garden of Eden of sorts, seen through the eyes of a five-year-old completely immersed in Armenian life and brought up to possess a deep love for his family and his people. Panian’s Gurin is juxtaposed against the treacherous Syrian desert and the orphanage at Antoura, Lebanon—the horrors of which he would endure soon after.\n\nPanian’s descriptions of the hardships suffered in the Syrian desert at the hands of Turkish soldiers are deeply disturbing. Though he was only a young boy at the time of the deportations, he is able to recall and paint a grim picture of the physical and emotional despair he and so many others had to endure with great detail. “These people, who just weeks earlier had been prosperous, living in their homes, praying in their churches, working in their fields, and helping the less fortunate, had been turned into a race of emaciated semi-corpses. They were like plants that had been uprooted and cast aside, and they were now dying slowly, shriveling into nothing,” he writes, describing his forced march through the desert alongside his mother, sister, and grandfather.\n\nAfter the death of his family members in a refugee camp, Panian was taken to the Antoura Orphanage, where surviving Armenian children were systemically and brutally conditioned to be raised as Turks. The orphanage—which was used as a center for Turkification—was the brainchild of Jemal Pasha, one of the architects of the Armenian Genocide. There, orphan boys were completely dehumanized and stripped of their cultural and ethnic heritage—they were given Turkic-Muslim names and brought up to feel as though being Armenian was a shameful disgrace. “We were all humiliated, reminded that being Armenian was a punishable crime,” Panian writes in the pages describing the orphanage.\n\nBetween 1915 and 1918, 300 of the 1,200 Armenian orphans at Antoura died under deplorable conditions of famine, disease, and cruel forms of punishment. Despite the horror, though, Panian inspires his reader through his descriptions of the orphans’ desperate desire to hang on to their Armenian identities. “It had been three years since we had been moved to the orphanage, and, clearly, the administration’s attempt to Turkify us was a miserable failure. When we challenged the teachers or the headmaster, we never felt alone. We were one united front, struggling together.”\n\nPanian describes a group of boys who, even in the darkest and most hopeless of times, is able to endure and persevere through camaraderie. “In Antoura, we fought a battle against an enemy intent on destroying our identities. We didn’t have mothers or fathers, or even good teachers and educators, to guide and impart their wisdom. The older boys were our role models. We took our cues from them, realizing that they did their best to be good examples. They encouraged us to keep our language alive, pray to our God, and never forget that we were Armenian,” Panian writes.\n\nThough surely dark at times, Panian’s journey to salvation and his eventual transition into a leading intellectual and educational leader in the Armenian Diaspora is an adventure steeped in hope, courage, and optimism. His descriptions of the horrors he was forced to live, coupled with the hopefulness that his new life promised after Antoura, makes the English translation of Goodbye, Antoura an invaluable addition to the already rich library of genocide memoirs that give the survivors a voice.\n\nIn Goodbye, Antoura, Panian says the Ottoman Empire was “silently enacting its genocidal plan before the indifference of the world.” A century later, it is difficult for the world to remain indifferent to a story so brilliantly brought to life through his words.\n\nWhen the a cappella trio “Zulal” (meaning clear water in Armenian) first performed in the Chicagoland area in the fall of 2004 at Sts. Joachim and Anne Armenian Apostolic Church in Palos Heights, I was captivated by the artistry with which the singers Teni Apelian, Yeraz Markarian, and Anais Tekerian presented Armenian folk songs to the audience. With each song, the trio not only brought to life the songs of our ancestors but for a brief while we, the audience, were transported back to another time—as the singers described, “a simpler time.” In the winter of 2011, they again performed in Chicago, at the AGBU Chicago Armenian Humanities Festival. In May 2015, the trio performed in Washington, D.C., at the National Commemoration of the Armenian Genocide Centennial, and this past summer, they once again performed in Chicago, this time at St. Gregory the Illuminator Armenian Church. Songs sung in the various regions of historic and present-day Armenia, as well as in Javakhk, Georgia, reverberated through the church hall—songs such as “Tsolak and Shogher” by Komitas, “Akh Nino” (Van/Vaspurakan), “Kele Lao” (Talin), “Ha Nina” (Moush/Poulanouk), “Tamzara (Palu, Dikranakert), “Lachin” (Basen, Shirak Province, present-day Armenia), “Vai Leh [Yana Yana]” (Javakhk, Georgia). As I listened to the stories that introduced the songs, and then to the songs, and as I watched the manner in which the trio sang them—with such spirit, grace, and heart—I thought: Traveling from city to city, these singers are our modern-day ashoogh(s).\n\nAshoogh(s)\n\nWho were the ashoogh(s) of long ago, when did they first appear, and what did they do? G. Tarverdyan, in his book Hye Ashooghner [Armenian Troubadours] (Yerevan: State University of Yerevan, 1937), wrote: “Armenian ashoogh(s), fundamentally, came into existence in the 17th century. Before that period, in the Middle Ages, similar types of poet-singers and traveling singers or troubadours were called goosan(s). Generally, the goosan(s) were clergymen cloistered in monasteries, where they composed spiritual and personal dagh(s) (songs or poems) for themselves. Besides the clergy, though, there were also laymen… Without exception, they were literate and educated…”\n\nThe ashoogh(s) of long ago, when the world, especially to those living in the villages and remote areas of Armenia, was yet a wondrous mystery, served not only as traveling entertainers but also as teachers and historians, who through their songs and poems and stories captured the customs, ethics, and vernacular of the various Armenian regions. With great skill and artistry, they presented them in the oral tradition. At times, through their songs, poems, or stories, they also served as messengers, particularly in cases of alerting people, especially villagers in remote areas, to imminent danger.\n\nSusie Hoogasian-Villa, in her book titled 100 Armenian Tales and Their Folkloristic Relevance (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1966), wrote: “Patriotic literature in the form of the oral tradition was safer in Turkish Armenia where a large number of people would be reached by skillful storytellers.” Sometimes, the ashoogh(s) had the difficult task of informing family members that their loved one, who had gone to a far-away land in search of work, was dead.\n\nAn example of such a situation is described in Rafael Aramian’s short story titled, “She Took A Pitcher And Went For Water,” in the book, We of the Mountains – Armenian Short Stories, (Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1972). The main characters in the story are Komitas Vartabed (archimandrite), a widow, and her young hars (meaning bride in Armenian, also daughter-in-law). After telling the vartabed of their great concern for their loved one, who went away in search of work and was not heard from, Komitas promises to find out the fate of the woman’s son and the young bride’s husband. After many months, Komitas receives a letter to his inquiry from the Baku Diocese stating that “… Andranik Tekmekchyan, a wanderer, died in Baku last autumn. May the Lord bless his mother and widow…” As was their usual practice on Sundays, the peasants in the village, among them the widow and her hars, gather in the Sarigiugh church, where Komitas, the visiting clergyman, spots the two women in the distance kneeling along the wall. One was praying, the other—the young bride—was not. She was staring at Komitas, “her eyes demanding: ‘Have you brought word of him?’”\n\nInstead of beginning Holy Mass, Komitas Vartabed looks at the two women and sadly sings, barely above a whisper: “She took a pitcher and went for water. She did not find, she did not find her loved one… She took a pitcher and went for water.” Komitas was singing the song of a loved one lost—the same one he had heard the young bride in her tattered dress sing by the spring to her beloved husband gone for so long and so far away. It was a song Komitas had heard in many places—places such as the Aragats, Bingyol, and Sipan mountains. As she looks at the vartabed, intently listening to him, the bride rises and runs out of the church. Having finished the song, Komitas says a prayer for “the souls of all wanderers who had left for foreign parts and would never return to plough their fields, to tend their gardens, to water their oxen…” The mother whispers, “May the earth over his grave in a foreign land be light.” The young hars goes to the spring to fetch water so that if a wanderer should pass by she could offer him a cool drink.\n\nNext May (2016), Zulal will once again perform in Chicago (University of Chicago), and Teni Apelian, Yeraz Markarian, and Anais Tekerian will, through their stories and songs, for a brief while, transport the audience to another place and time, where village girls “cast fortunes by the moon’s light, morning smoke rises from the tonir, young brides weave golden threads through their hair as others spin wool into gossip…”\n\nLAWRENCE, Mass.—The smiling, beard-covered face of international super producer and musician Danny Bedrosian hides the tragedy his family faced. A native of Lawrence, his family was from the Kharpert province, which was known as the “Slaughterhouse Province” during the Armenian Genocide. It was one of the epicenters of the genocide. Over two-thirds of his family were killed.\n\nDanny’s great-grandfather Yeghia Bedrosian survived because he had already immigrated to America to make money for his family and village. Yeghia was a founding member of the Compatriotic Union of Habousi and a leader in educating the Armenian community.\n\nHis wife Serpouie was the sole survivor of her immediate family, losing her entire father’s family and her entire mother’s family in the genocide. Danny’s grandfather Garabed Bedrosian was also a genocide survivor and a leader in the Armenian community. He possessed a wealth of cultural knowledge and was a gifted painter and artist.\n\nLike his father, he utilized his skills to educate the community and serve the Compatriotic Union of Habousi. His wife, Sirvart (Azoian) Bedrosian, was the daughter of Manoog Azoian, a genocide survivor from Sarigamish-on-the-Tigris, and Khomour Goshgarian, who was one of the most important clairvoyants in the community in Kharpert city, and later in Lawrence, Mass.\n\nThey passed their knowledge to their son Bedros Bedrosian who became a gifted pianist, choir director, carpenter, singer, and educator. Bedros then passed his knowledge and pride in his Armenian heritage to his son, Danny Bedrosian.\n\nDanny takes great pride in his heritage. Recently he did DNA testing and learned that he is a descendant of the Orbelian Family. The Orbelians ruled areas of Armenia, the Kingdom of Georgia, and the Byzantine Empire. They are descendants of the Mamikonian family, who were the sparapets of Armenia.\n\nIt is believed that during the Safavid-Ottoman Wars, around 1415-1515, the Orbelians migrated to the Kharpert Plains. Their name was changed, which was sometimes done to protect the Armenian royal families from those who wanted to kill them off. Titles held by Danny’s ancestors included Lord of the Province of Siunik, Emperor of the Byzantine Empire, Governor of the Armeniac Theme, Marzban of Persian Armenia, Regent of Armenia, Prince of Taron, and Prince of Tayk.\n\nDuring one of his band P-Funk’s recent tours, he played Batumi, Georgia. He took the opportunity to share a paragraph about being a direct descendant of the royal Orbelians with the audience. There was an uproar of applause from the audience for Danny’s proficiency speaking Georgian and birthright.\n\nA Georgian news station then asked the leader of the group, George Clinton, “What is it like to have a KING in your band?”\n\nP-Funk, otherwise known as Parliament-Funkadelic or “pure funk,” is led by George Clinton. Between the ages of 16-20, Danny met and befriended George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic.\n\nHe began doing session work for Clinton and later was offered to play with Bo Diddley. After earning his college degree in Middle Eastern studies from the University of New Hampshire, he landed a job playing keyboards in the studio, and within months became a full-time musician with the band.\n\nDanny has played with them all over North America, South America, the Caribbean, Africa, East Asia, the Middle East, Australia, Europe, and New Zealand, and is featured on multiple releases and albums of both live and studio work. With Clinton, Danny has performed for crowds in the hundreds of thousands all over the world.\n\nDanny’s talents and reputation as well as opportunities as a keyboardist with P-Funk have led him to work and play with some of the biggest artists in the world in multiple genres and industries, including Shavo Odadjian (System of a Down), Kendrick Lamar, Ice Cube, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Fishbone, Queen Latifah, Paul Schaffer & the CBS Orchestra, Erykah Badu, RZA, Snoop Dogg, Chuck D, Flavor Flav, Samuel L. Jackson, Sly and the Family Stone, Ed Bradley (from “60 Minutes”), the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, members of the Meters, members of the JB’s, and many more.\n\nDanny is also a musical star in his own right. He founded the groups Sweet Motha Child, Som’n Fierce, and Secret Army, which have released dozens of albums and had dozens of tours around the world. He also runs the production and publishing company BOZFONK.\n\nHis credits include multiple television appearances on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Jimmy Fallon, the Late Show with David Letterman, the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, the Jools Holland Show, the BET 25th Anniversary Show, the Monique Show, and MTV on five different continents, to name but a few. Additionally he has appeared on more than 80 albums, 11 DVD releases, 8 singles, 6 EPs, and 5 major book releases.\n\nBlending music and history, Danny put together an Armenian Genocide Centennial Concert in 2015. The performance was a 2-hour epic with music spanning 3,400 years of Armenian history as well as a lecture series and a film. Danny led the lecture series himself.\n\nDanny also proudly notes that his father’s cousin, Steve Bedrosian, is a Cy-Young Award winning pitcher who played in four World Series with three wins. During his career he played for the Braves, Phillies, Giants, and Twins. His son, Cameron Bedrosian, currently plays for the L.A. Angels.\n\nThe future is bright for Danny Bedrosian. In 2015 he released his 11th solo album entitled, “The Clock.” He has dozens of concerts scheduled for the remainder of that which include performances at the Howard Theater in Washington D.C., B.B. King’s in New York City, and the local Toad’s Place in New Haven, Conn.

The book was edited by Yetvart Chopurian, and first published in 1921 in Istanbul, under the title ‘Քսան Կախաղանները’ (the Twenty Executions) in memory of the 20 executed members of the Social Democratic Hunchakian Party… From our point of view, this book is about a second confrontation, the confrontation of social democrats and socialists in Turkey with their own history, their unknown, unspoken legacy which they either ignored or were unaware of. […] Therefore, we kindly ask your permission to use your art work as the cover which, we think, will give an exceptionally great meaning to our [task].”\n\nAttached to the letter was a copy of Yetvart Chopurian’s book published in 1921, a Turkish translation of the book, and the initial cover design, where the painting is partially displayed. After studying the documentation, I found it appropriate to grant permission to the publishing house to use the image as is, uncut and unedited as book cover art, as well as the name of the artist, Daniel Varoujan Hejinian, the year of creation, and the history of the painting to be published on the first page of the book.\n\nIn 1976, I graduated from Gegharvest-a-Taterakan Institute, now the Yerevan Academy of Fine Arts, and as a theme for my dissertation I chose the Armenian Genocide. My painting depicted “The Twenty Executions” (Քսան Կախաղաններ). The idea for this gigantic work came to my mind from my early school years, when annually on June 15, all the pupils would gather in the yard of Giligian Varjaran to evoke the memory of the 20 martyrs, and listen to the powerful patriotic speech of the schoolmaster.\n\nAs a graduate from Aleppo’s Giligian College, I decided to donate the painting to Aleppo’s Hunchakian Center. At my request, the same year and with the support of the “Spyurki Gomideh,” the painting was shipped from Yerevan to Aleppo. As of today, I haven’t received any official confirmation related to the painting. Yet 40 years later, echoes of the Twenty’s came from Istanbul.\n\nOn Nov. 7, the book Paramaz: Twenty Executions of Bayazit, published by the Evrensel Publishing House, was at the 34th Istanbul Book Fair, the largest book fair in Turkey. On Nov. 8, it was presented at the publisher’s special event, a panel discussion organized by Evrensel on the topic of “The Armenian Genocide in its 100th Anniversary.”\n\nOne-hundred years have passed since Paramaz and his 19 comrades’ lifeless bodies swayed under Istanbul’s gray sky, but their ghosts still roam the streets of the slumbering city, penetrating into the subconscious of generations, to ensure that the dust of years of denial and ignorance can’t bury the past. Sooner or later Turkey will confront its history by recognizing the Armenian Genocide, as an echo of long-delayed justice.\n\nBRYN MAWR, Pa.—Filmmaker Stephanie Ayanian is on a long, yet relentless journey toward fruition.\n\nAyanian is a year into her hour-long documentary called “A New Armenia,” combing the roads and byways for engaging stories about Armenians in the diaspora.\n\nShe’s 50 percent there and keeps the flickering flame of expectation burning at both ends. Hopefully, viewers may get to see it as a celebrated primetime feature on PBS sometime over the next year.\n\nWith a proposed budget of $760,000, tens of thousands of miles logged, and up to 3 crew members, the question remains. Will it end up in a primetime PBS slot or will public television stations across the United States screen it independently?\n\n“If for some reason PBS doesn’t wish to air it on prime time, there are a number of other public television distribution models we will pursue,” says Ayanian. “We’ve never had an issue getting our films screened on public television. Every film we have ever made for public television (five total) has screened broadly across the United States on PBS stations.”\n\nThe feedback from PBS executives was pretty straightforward. Make sure the film is relevant to non-Armenian audiences. PBS is watched by 211 million Americans, with a primetime audience that is larger than many featured networks combined.\n\nThe glass remains half full when you’re a film producer laden with optimism. Ayanian follows her path with a work that is destined to capture an audience and bring awareness to our rich culture.\n\nThe nutmeg here is how far the nation has advanced since 1915. These are stories about human beings who have interesting lives, some famous while others not, many who are working hard to impact American culture as well as their own heritage.\n\nOver the past year, Ayanian and her crew have been able to research and develop 11 stories. They have completed filming two of them, and are in the midst of six others. Three other stories are in the waiting stages.\n\nHer travels have gone universal, covering such areas as Boston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, New York, and Armenia.\n\nAyanian has encountered national organizations, scholars, churches. She’s attended events, read books and newspapers, watched films. All represent a relevant commodity in her pursuit.\n\n“The inspiration,” she says, “comes from everywhere. It evolves in the lives of individuals, stories of people willing to share their dreams, those who’ve overcome adversity to succeed.”\n\nShe calls it a “labor of love,” yet Ayanian knows nothing comes easy. She’s halfway there…and counting. With an estimated budget of $760,000, funding is a concern. But people are buying into it (see http://www.storyshopfilms.com/anewarmenia).\n\n“Although my filmmaking partners are not Armenian, they have sacrificed a lot to make this film,” Ayanian says. “I expect that of myself, as I am Armenian, and I expect to put in ‘volunteer’ time on this project. Each has gone above and beyond the call because they love this project, believe in its stories, and have a great deal of respect for the Armenians.\n\n“It’s hard to qualify how much has been invested into this film but I think it’s safe to say about 3,000 hours of volunteer time as a partnership toward making this a reality,” she adds.\n\nHer subjects remain just as enamored. A photo of prominent musician Richard Hagopian and his grandson Andrew is but one example. All are fascinating stories about interesting people and their families.\n\n“Richard is a gem of a human being and has tremendous talent,” Ayanian describes. “Others have shown me what it really means to be Armenian. They are talented, humble, and thoughtful—and they have maintained our Armenian culture in America.”\n\nProducing a work of this magnitude is one objective. Marketing it is another. After filming comes the editing process, then distribution and outreach. Screenings, discussions, and live cultural events like music, dance, and cuisine are planned.\n\n“These events are intended to draw a non-Armenian crowd to enjoy an immersive cultural experience with Armenians that will evolve into a lasting impression,” Ayanian points out.\n\nBoth Ayanian’s grandparents are genocide survivors. She and her partners have made multiple films that have been screened across the United States, shown internationally at festivals, winning awards.\n\nA successful Kickstarter campaign has been complemented by benefactors and donors who have bought into the project. For areas outside the country, the film will be available on DVD and Blu-ray. It may also be considered for film festivals and public screenings and events.\n\n“We lack a film that documents and celebrates the joys, struggles, and values of these Armenian Americans,” Ayanian maintains. “We’re peeking into their kitchens imparting thousand-year-old recipes. We’re sharing social and religious traditions with laughter and solemnity, huddling with business leaders as they bring honor and financial security to their families and communities.”\n\nThe audience will be introduced to the genocide for a foundation of understanding, then meet survivor families, delving into their lives and accomplishments.\n\n“Where are we now, 100 years after the genocide?” Ayanian wonders. “We are thriving, but what does the future hold? No one was tackling these questions in this way. So my partners and I started developing ‘A New Armenia.’ We’re looking at what it means to be a survivor and the challenges we face in America generations after arriving here.”\n\nWith the plethora of films, books, and events marking the Centennial, Ayanian sees this project as being different from the rest. It’s more of an opportunity to celebrate what we’ve accomplished as strong, vibrant communities.\n\nAyanian holds an undergraduate degree in film and video from Penn State University and a M.F.A. in film and media arts from Temple University.\n\nShe’s a former member of the AGBU Young Professionals in San Francisco and Philadelphia, where she met her husband and settled down after graduate school.\n\nShe previously worked as a senior producer/director for Penn State Public Broadcasting, where she was a producer and director of “Liquid Assets.”\n\nAs an independent producer, her film “Kinderwald” was an Official Selection of the Munich International, Seattle International, Slamdance, and Napa Valley film festivals.\n\nOne surprising element to this filmmaker is her athletic prowess. She played basketball in the Pan American Games in Yerevan in 2001 with a team from San Francisco. It was an unforgettable experience to say the least.\n\nAsk Ayanian about specific role models and her response is all-encompassing and magnetic. “Any Armenian American who works hard to build a dream. I’m inspired by writers, filmmakers, musicians, artists, dancers, chefs, doctors, lawyers, businesspeople, and scientists who share their stories. It thrills me to watch people create, think, and share their gifts with others.”\n\nAward-winning author Chris Bohjalian’s latest novel, The Guest Room, a book that touches upon several issues including human trafficking and sexual slavery, is scheduled to be released on Jan. 5, 2016.\n\nThe Guest Room is a captivating thriller about a party gone horribly wrong, after which two men lie dead in a suburban living room, two women are on the run from police, and a marriage is on the brink of collapse.\n\nThe novel features two 19-year-olds from Armenia, abducted as teenagers, held captive as sex slaves in Russia throughout their adolescence, and then brought to New York City. The Guest House follows one of the girls’ (Alexandra’s) story, as she escapes sexual slavery and tries to stay in alive in Manhattan with, essentially, no identity. The book also chronicles the story of the Chapman family, and the nightmare they face after one fateful night.\n\nBohjalian is the critically acclaimed author of several novels, including the New York Times bestsellers The Sandcastle Girls, Skeletons at the Feast, The Double Bind, and Midwives. His novel Midwives was a number one New York Times bestseller and a selection of Oprah’s Book Club. His work has been translated into more than 25 languages, and 3 of his novels have become movies (Secrets of Eden, Midwives, and Past the Bleachers).\n\nThe book can be pre-ordered on Amazon.\n\nBohjalian will conduct the first leg of his book tour for The Guest Room, Jan. 4-22, 2016.\n\nMon., Jan. 4 at 7 p.m.\n\nWarwick, Rhode Island\n\nBarnes & Noble\n\n1350 Bald Hill Road\n\n(401) 826-8885\n\nTues.

A first-hand account of the aftermath of the 1909 Turkish massacre of 30,000 Armenians, the volume is a must-read for those who want to understand the struggle for human rights in the Ottoman Empire at the turn of the 20th century and the backdrop to today’s political climate and events in Syria, Iraq, and Turkey. The official publication date will be March 8, 2016, coinciding with the 2016 celebration of International Women’s Day.\n\nAt age 31, Yessayan journeyed to the scene of the 1909 massacres of Armenians in Adana to provide relief for the victims and to observe conditions. She returned to Constantinople (Istanbul) and penned In the Ruins, which heralded a new literary form. A literature of testimony, Yessayan documents the voices of the survivors who tell her their horrific stories and describe their emotional turmoil and terror.\n\nFrom her earliest years, Zabel Yessayan championed social justice and women’s rights. Even as a young woman, she fought against the injustices she saw at school, refused to accept the restrictions placed on girls in her community, and demonstrated a fierce determination to succeed in the literary world at a time when few women were allowed entry. In addition to In the Ruins, she authored several novels, short stories, newspaper articles, and a memoir.\n\nAIWA previously released two other books in English translation by Zabel Yessayan: The Gardens of Silihdar, a memoir of Yessayan’s childhood in the city of Constantinople, and My Soul in Exile and Other Writings, a collection that highlights her novel about an artist who returns home to the Ottoman capital where she confronts feelings of alienation and isolation. These three Yessayan volumes contain some of her best and most influential works and provide a picture of the scope, breadth, and historical significance of her writing.\n\nThe Yessayan books are the latest releases in AIWA’s “Treasury of Armenian Women’s Literature” series, which makes available English-language translations of works by pioneering women authors who wrote in Eastern or Western Armenian. The translation and publication of In the Ruins was made possible by a generous grant from the Gulbenkian Foundation. The book includes an appendix with selected articles and letters by Yessayan that elucidate the events of 1909 and their immediate aftermath.\n\nIn December 1990, David Kherdian’s The Dividing River / The Meeting Shore was published by Santa Fe’s Lotus Press. Now, Beech Hill Publishing Company is releasing the 25th Anniversary Edition of this masterwork, with a new 36-page companion booklet of ephemera: a new foreword, a new interview with David Kherdian, and 7 previously unpublished poems that sprung from the same poetic wellspring as the original.\n\nIn the foreword, Mado Spiegler writes, “The Dividing River / The Meeting Shore is a complex work, a ‘metaphysical’ poem in 41 numbered ‘movements’; not a love song, though it is about the experience of love, nor a dirge, although it is about the experience of loss, but a multifaceted meditation, on the mystery of individual lives, and the mystery of friendship, especially the kind of fated friendships in which the lack of superficial ‘compatibility’ goes together with deep connection that lives on the long arc of destiny.”\n\nIn discussing his work in the interview included in the booklet, David Kherdian notes, “The reservoir these poems come from is very deep, and also distant in time, and of course I never before evaluated or brooded over the childhood friendship I had with my friend, because the chronological movement of our lives does not lend itself to backward glances, certainly not in a sustained, deliberate, and loving way. Loss does that, time does that, and one’s conscience slowly awakened over time does this as nothing else can.”\n\nReflecting on his friend’s passing, Kherdian adds, “When someone we love dies, something in us goes that way too, like a man standing on shore waving goodbye to a departing vessel. And, too, your friend takes with him what he knew and remembered of you, so that is also stripped away, and we are smaller for it. In the end we must remember ourselves, but all those who remember and knew us are involved in that remembering. These poems touch that eternal place in us, where the horizontal bar of life is intersected by a vertical light outside of time.”\n\nSpecial for the Armenian Weekly\n\nScout Tufankjian received photographic repute by becoming the only independent journalist to follow then-Senator Barack Obama from his initial candidacy through to his victory on election night in 2008.The images she captured during the campaign produced the bestselling book, Yes We Can: Barack Obama’s History-Making Presidential Campaign. Her picture of Michelle and Barack Obama in warm embrace became the most liked picture on Facebook and the most re-tweeted picture in history.\n\nTufankjian’s latest collection is There is Only the Earth: Images from the Armenian Diaspora Project; though categorizing it merely as a collection of photographs would be a simplification of the scope and narrative of her work. Tufankjian trekked to five different continents over the course of four years and bore witness to the eclectic, multi-faceted, enduring Armenian Diaspora. Communities from Calcutta to Ethiopia are showcased—the similar chestnut-tinted smiling faces of young Armenians clearly transcend global coordinates.\n\nTufankjian does not consider herself a writer; instead she imparts her storytelling via carefully cultivated images. The narrative she weaves does not need words or paragraphs, though it speaks volumes. There is Only the Earth highlights the theme of survival, with individuals and communities sharing a different understanding of what being Armenian is to them. Published in April 2015 in commemoration of the Centennial of the Armenian Genocide, its pages are filled with photographs and short blurbs, featuring personal narratives of what each pocket of the diaspora means to the individual witnessing it. Looking forward and beyond 1915, the book mirrors the true strength and resilience of the Armenian people. It was Tufankjian’s wish for the book to become a way to celebrate our survival and accomplishments as a people at the same time that we were mourning our losses.\n\nAs an Armenian reader, no matter how underwhelmingly patriotic one might be, it would be taxing to remain indifferent while flipping through the pages of this culmination of Tufankjian’s work documenting the diaspora. One of the reasons There is Only the Earth is so impactful is because it does not lend its side to any summary or definition of what being Armenian should feel like. The pictures range from isolated moments to public experiences, with the underlying theme being presence: We are here, we have remained, we will flourish. Armenians from different regions show how their upbringing has guided their own self-narrative, how the diaspora has moulded their individual identity, and how their own identity has moulded the diaspora itself.\n\nTufankjian was born in Boston to an Armenian-American father and an Irish-American mother. She grew up isolated from the hubs of the Massachusetts-Armenian community. Armenian magazines and newspapers became her muse while connecting to various Armenian realities outside her family and friends. The multi-layered nature of Armenian identity fascinated Tufankjian, enough so that she decided to travel across the world and visit Armenian communities along the way.\n\nThere is Only the Earth is a beacon of hope and light, in a history that has too often been described by its own native sons and daughters as dark, dim, and depressing. Her book is the story of survival; the story of always remembering, but never letting the narrative take the better part of us; the story of “we are still here”; the story of “we never left.”\n\nWith the vast Armenian Diaspora being showcased, on the anniversary of the Genocide Centennial no less, Tufankjian has forced the reader to respect the past, appreciate the present, and—out of a visceral spite to succeed—look forward to the future.\n\nThe experience of discovering the book, for an Armenian reader, is one that can be likened to greedily digging through an old photo album found in a distant relative’s house—seeing your own visage in the beautiful and carefully curated pages, while simultaneously discovering branches of your extended family tree you were not even aware had blossomed from the same trunk."
