        "text": "We know most of our readers by now are familiar with AGBU’s educational, cultural and social programs in Armenia. Each year, with the input of many individuals, every long-term project improves and expands. For this, we owe a debt of gratitude to our donors for their generosity, to our directors and staff in Armenia and the United States for their vision and administration and to the government of Armenia for their assistant and support. In the past few years, through the generosity of new donors, AGBU has extended its assistance to a variety of other institutions. These one-time grants offer new technology, renova­tion and construction, and the advancement of locally initiated programs in Armenia. Along with the projects listed below AGBU has in 1997 allocated funds to heat 200 schools in Yerevan and has made grants to the State Engineering University, Manuscript Library (Matenadaran) and two new cultural groups producing television programs, films and theatrical musicals.\n\nThe American University of Armenia’s mission is to develop the next generation of entrepreneurs, public servants, technical wizards and educators. Today, over 550 Business Management, Engineering, Political Science, Conservation and Environmental Science, and Public Health alumni, with their added English and computer skills, are working in an impressive number of fields: the government ministries of Economy, Industry and Trade, Finance, Energy and Fuel, Foreign affairs and Health; United Nations, U.S. Embassy, and World Bank; Coca Cola Bottling, Midland Armenia Bank, Central Bank, Johnson & Johnson, KPMG Auditing and Consulting Group, Mars Corp., Cargo Terminal— just to name a few. AUA expanded its departments in 1997 to include Masters of Law and Judicial and Legal Training programs. The participants include not only students new to the field but a number of judges and practicing lawyers enrolled for continuing education. The LLM curriculum emphasizes international commercial law and comparative constitutional law.\n\nThe AGBU and the AUA Board of Directors have begun a major campaign to raise $25,000,000 to endow the University’s various departments, extension courses and research centers. To date, $6,000,000 has been contributed by generous worldwide donors.\n\nThe Armenian Philharmonic Orchestra, under the sponsorship of AGBU, once again had an outstanding year. Offering two concerts per week throughout the year to standing-room audiences, the orchestra has also performed at special festivals and concerts honoring the music of foreign and local composers and featured a number of guest soloists from around the world.\n\nA new computer laboratory has been established at the National Academy of Sciences through an individual gift made to AGBU for this specific purpose. The academy, through its internet and website, is now in direct contact with other institutions around the world.\n\nNork, Arapkir and Malatya Children’s Centers in Yerevan serve over 5000 students, ages five to eighteen years old. Classes in music, dance, visual arts, language, history and physical training are offered daily from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. Since there is a substantial waiting list, applicants are tested before acceptance and must continue in their chosen area of study for two years before moving on to another field. For many of the children, these years of training, lead to future careers. AGBU donors, along with their contributions for operating costs, are funding the renovation of all three centers. Like all poorly constructed Soviet structures, the centers need new roofs, plumb­ing, heating, and interior repair. When complete, programs will be expanded to offer evening classes and cultural perfor­mances for parents and neighborhood residents.\n\nIn partnership with the Shirak governor’s office, AGBU is sponsoring the reconstruction of School #14 in the heart of the city.\n\nAlmost destroyed in the 1988 earthquake, the 700 student capacity school is being completely rebuilt and is expected to be finished by the beginning of the 1998 school year.\n\nThe Gyumri Academy, once a communist headquarters, was opened officially in October, 1997. Severely damaged in the 1988 earthquake, AGBU funded the complete restoration of the 60,000 sq. ft. building located in the center of the city. Officially registered as an institute of higher education, Gyumri Academy offers instruction in all the arts for students eighteen years or older and includes space for the Gyumri Philharmonic, Chamber Orchestra and Choir.\n\nThe Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Center, with its 22 bed facility at Erebuni Hospital, continues to serve some 1200 patients a year. Over 4000 children and adults with birth defects, burns, a variety of injuries and deformities and work/war disabilities have been successfully treated since the opening of the center in 1991. Volunteer sur­geons and nurses from the U.S. have joined the PRSC’s staff of three surgeons, anesthesiologist and nurses for two and three week working visits in the past six years. The Ultrasound Center, funded by Mr. and Mrs. Nazar Nazari- an, has recently expanded to include a third ultrasound machine, ATL Ultra mark 9. Under the supervision of Dr. Levon Nazarian of Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, physicians received U.S. training prior to establishing the Center. The Ultrasound Center, administered by Dr. Hamayak Sisakian, Dr. Gayane Bostanjian and Dr. Ashot Papoian, serves patients referred by the doctors of Erebuni and other hospitals throughout Armenia.\n\nOver 1000 pensioners and orphans are served a daily 1200 plus calorie meal daily at the Nork, Sevan, Hrazdan and Etchmiadzin Soup Kitchens. Many of the recipients now take their more than ample portions home to share with their friends and extended families. With a generous grant from AGBU’s Marseille Chapter the Nork Center Kitchen, dining hall and restrooms were recently renovated. The Etchmiadzin facility has been given to the Araratian Diocese (which oversees all AGBU’s Soup Kitchens) and will soon undergo renovation. With both the Nork and Etchmiadzin buildings under AGBU’s direct management (instead of renting facilities as previously) both service and food have improved considerably.\n\nThe education of sixty seminarians at the Sevan Seminary is supported by a select group of AGBU donors. Under construction, a new dormitory and chapel is also being funded by a major AGBU donor. Opened in 1991, this year the first class of seven graduates are working in Holy Etchmiadzin and the Araratian Diocese, all of whom will be ordained in early 1998."
