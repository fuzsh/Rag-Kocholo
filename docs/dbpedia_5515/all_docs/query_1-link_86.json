        "text": "A meeting with the Shirak diocese Primate Archbishop Mikayel Ajapahyan was held to honor outstanding women of the Shirak province. The Primate mentioned the big role and essential contribution of Shirak's women to the social, economic and political life of Gyumri and the Shirak province. Armenia was one of the first countries that, in the first decade of the XIX century, gave women the right to vote. During the Soviet era most of the high positions in this province were held by women. For many years the leader of the leading party was Ms. Donara Harutyunyan, whose contribution to the city development is hard to overstate. Today’s Shirak's Governor is a lady, a fact that is frequently mentioned in Strasbourg at the European Union. Ms. Lida Nanyan is officially acknowledged as one of the best governors in Armenia. The deputy governor, Ms. Kirakosyan is a lady, too. Two villages in the Shirak region have elected female village supervisors.\n\nThe Primate also acknowledged the key role of women in child education and their importance to the family. He praised their devotion and dedication to the church, today and in history, noting that only the women stayed with Jesus Christ after he was crucified."
