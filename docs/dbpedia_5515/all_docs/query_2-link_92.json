There is also ample information concerning the settlements of the Armenian Diaspora.\n\nIn 2022 the RAA specialists continued finalizing the plans and measurements (using Archicad-20) drafted during research trips. We also compiled lists of inhabited places and architectural monuments of Nakhijevan, Artsakh and Northern Artsakh with accurate geographical coordinates.\n\nDuring the year, efforts continued for the preparation of Parspatunik (Gharadagh), one of the forthcoming volumes of the RAA 36-volume series entitled History of Armenia. Two other works, Artsakh Atlas (in English and Russian) and Armenian Fountains (in Armenian, Russian and English), by Samvel Karapetian of blessed memory, were prepared for publication. Another work by the merited monumentologist, Hambardzum Yeramian (in Armenian), was almost entirely edited and will soon be ready for publication.\n\nThe articles to be included in the 17th and 18th issues of the journal Vardzk were edited and proofread.\n\nThe content of the website artsakhmonuments.org was supplemented with English-language information based on Samvel Karapetian’s work, Mravakank.\n\nWEBSITES AND PROGRAMMING\n\nDuring the year, we continued the creation of electronic versions of the RAA publications (in a pdf format) to be presented online on our website (https://www.raa-am.org). Thanks to collaboration with Vardan Kocharian, a programmer and a long-time partner of the RAA, a search system was introduced into these electronic publications, making it possible to find the given personal name, toponym or any other word in all the available publications at once.\n\nAlso, work is in progress for creating a huge database of unique videos mostly taken during RAA research trips, for the purpose of preservation and internal use.\n\nIn 2022 the RAA completed the creation of the website artsakhmonuments.org, on which the foundation had started working within a grant awarded by Flanders Chancellory and Foreign Office, Belgium.\n\nAlso, we continued work at the website armenianmonumentsimages.com: our efforts were particularly focused on the addition of photo captions and the update of the available ones.\n\n3D MODELLING\n\nIn 2022 the RAA specialists successfully continued the 3D modelling of different monuments of the historical Armenian city of Ani for a book (Ani: 3D Modelling) devoted to its virtual reconstruction.

The publication of these works was sponsored by Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation.\n\nWEBSITES AND PROGRAMMING\n\nDuring the year, the RAA website www.armenianarchitecture.am was enriched with new data.\n\nAlso, the digitization of the RAA publications continued to increase the number of our electronic books which are available at raa.am (raa-am.com).\n\nThe RAA specialists continued the construction of a thesaurus of internal use which is going to be a database of unique videos mostly shot during our research trips in different districts of Western Armenia. These videos reveal the state of Armenian cultural monuments in these historical Armenian lands; also, they contain interviews with locals who speak about the Genocide of 1915 and the subsequent destruction of Armenian cultural heritage.\n\nThanks to a grant awarded by the RA Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sport, between June and November 2021, we completed the modernization of the RAA website www.raa-am.org (the work was carried out by Armen Gevorgian and Hrak Kulumian).\n\nIn 2021, within a grant awarded by Flanders Chancellory and Foreign Office, Belgium, RAA Foundation started a new project aimed at the construction of a webpage of Artsakh monuments (the project will be implemented thanks to the support of the RA Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sport).\n\nAlso, the foundation continued work at the website armenianmonumentsimages.com: our efforts were particularly focused on the addition of photo captions and the updating of the available ones.\n\nCURRENT ACTIVITIES AND FORTHCOMING BOOKS\n\nOne of the most important aspects of the activities of the foundation is, indeed, the collection of information relating to historical Armenian villages, towns and monuments from the Armenian periodic press as well as from various published and unpublished sources (such as archive documents kept in the Armenian National Archives, the Matenadaran /Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts/, and the Museum of Art and Literature after Yeghishe Charents).\n\nSuch information is also collected from foreign (Georgian, Persian, Turkish, Russian, English, French, etc.) publications, thanks to which, the RAA’s unique archives are daily enriched with data relating to any place or monument in Historical Armenia. There is also ample information concerning the settlements of the Armenian Diaspora.\n\nIn 2021 the RAA specialists continued finalizing the plans and measurements (using Archicad-20) drafted during the research trips in 2019. Within this work, we also finalized the draft measurements of Gagkashen Church and a number of other monuments in Ani City, and finally processed the available 3D images. Besides, using a glass negative from Armen Hakhnazarian’s archives, we created a final 3D reconstruction of the dioctahedral dome of the church of Aghjkaberd Fortress in Ani. All these materials will be used in a forthcoming RAA publication, Ani: 3D Modelling.\n\nDuring the year, efforts continued for the preparation of two volumes of the RAA 36-volume series entitled History of Armenia, Parspatunik (Gharadagh) and Khnus (both in Armenian). In early 2022, the foundation will publish the 5th volume of this series, Khnus by Raffi Kortoshian.\n\nThe late Samvel Karapetian’s work, The Microtoponyms of Artsakh (in Armenian), has been finally prepared for publication, and hopefully, will see the light in the first quarter of 2022. During the same period, the RAA will also publish Vardzk no. 16 [in Armenian].\n\nThe English translation of The Mayors of Tiflis (by Samvel Karapetian), one of the volumes of the series of RAA Scientific Researches, has been finally edited and designed. The editing of the English translation of another volume of this series, Akhaltskha (by Samvel Karapetian), will soon be completed.\n\n3D MODELLING\n\nIn 2021 the RAA specialists successfully continued the 3D modelling of different monuments of the historical Armenian city of Ani and started the preparation of a book (Ani: 3D Modelling) devoted to the virtual reconstruction of the city. The work was particularly focused on the completion of the 3D modelling of Gagkashen (St. Grigor Lusavorich) Church, the small size models of Ani Cathedral and the church of Tigran Honents Monastery. Also, the donor portraits of the cathedral and Gagkashen Church were made, and further work was carried out to create an accurate virtual reconstruction of the domes of the cathedral and the church of Aghjkaberd Fortress.\n\nSo far the 3D modelling of the following monuments of Ani has been carried out: the cathedral, the churches of Gagkashen, Sourb Arakelots (Holy Apostles), Sourb Prkich (Holy Saviour), Yourahatuk (Unique), Hovvi, Karakhoran (Four-Apse), Bazmakhoran (Multi-Apse), Bakhtaghek, Vimapor (Rock-Cut) as well as the Domed Church of the Citadel, the church of Aghjkaberd Fortress, Tigran Honents Monastery, Kusanats Convent, Paron’s Palace, a guest house and a bridge.\n\nIMAGE DIGITIZATION\n\nDuring the year, 140,000 images were digitized, thanks to which, now the RAA database contains a total of 659,000 images (645,000 at the end of 2020).\n\nGRANTS\n\nIn 2021, within a programme of cultural grants implemented by the RA Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sport, RAA Foundation was awarded a grant for the modernization of its website, www.raa-am.org. The work was carried out within 6 months, between June and November 2021.\n\nThe foundation also received another grant from Flanders Chancellory and Foreign Office, Belgium, for the construction of a webpage of Artsakh monuments (the project will be implemented with the support of the RA Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sport). The project will be completed within 2 years.\n\nIn order to support the RAA activities, Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation has awarded us a grant which will be allocated in 4 instalments from September 2021 until March 2023. Thanks to this grant, in 2021 we published a booklet and the journal Vardzk (for details, see the section of Publications).\n\nRESTORATION ACTIVITIES\n\nWithin its partnership with reArmenia, which is a collaboration and fundraising platform, RAA Foundation has embarked on the restoration of St. Hakob (Jacob) Monastery (Metsaranits Sourb Hakobavank) located in Kolatak Village, Martakert District, Republic of Artsakh. The work will be carried out from 2022 until 2024, being supervised by the RAA specialists Samvel Ayvazian, an architect-restorer, and Ashot Hakobian, an assistant architect. Within the implementation of the project, the RAA representatives had a meeting with Gayane Casnati, an Italian architect and an expert, also participating in an event held by reArmenia on 9 October 2021. Besides, a number of press conferences were held to raise awareness of the project.\n\nFor the implementation of the project, on 6 December 2021, fundraising was officially launched on reArmenia.
