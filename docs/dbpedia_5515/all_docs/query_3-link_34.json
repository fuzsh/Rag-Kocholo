        "text": "History\n\nThere is a Cyclopean fortress almost 4km to the east of Amberd. It was poorly located, while Amberd was placed in an ideal spot. Some may suggest that because there are many other Cyclopean fortresses around Amberd, it may have been Cyclopean, too.\n\nMany archaeological excavations proved this guess to be wrong. T. Toramanyan and H. Orbeli claimed that the fortress was built in primeval times or BC. Beginning in the 10th century, Cyclopean fortresses were typically mass-inhabited. Armenian castle-building was just developing in the 10th century.\n\nArshakuni and other dynasties could have 70-80,000 men in their armies. Armenians were able to battle near enemy borders, even compelling them not to enter their lands. During the Bagratuni (Bagratid) dynasty, each battle took place with the help of fortresses. These battles were more minor in scale.\n\nBagratuni kings often had 30,000-man armies. Beginning with King Ashot Yerkat, when Armenians were banishing Arabs from Armenia, the Bagratunies were able to build many castles and fortresses to strengthen their country. Many of these castles were built in mountainous areas.\n\nIn the 11th century, the local diocese was moved from Byurakan to Amberd, mainly because the Byurakan fortress was ruined at the beginning of the 10th century.\n\nMany middle-age fortresses were built by the wealthy king, Ashot Yerkat. Many people credit him for Amberd; it is called the fortress of Ashot Yerkat. This monarch had already banished the Arabs and used his wealth to strengthen and fortify many other large fortresses, including Amberd, during ten years of peace. He organized and strengthened the Armenian military force, making the country a real military camp.\n\nNo one could attack the Armenians and their fortresses. Ashot Yerkat had everything he needed to defend his land. The people loved him and called him Yerkat, which means ‘Iron.’\n\nAll of this information about Ashot and the fortresses being built by him are just a guess; nobody can prove them to be fact. Some historians say that Aragatsotn was in the east of the Shirak kingdom. The enemy should have been passing Aragatsotn before reaching the capital of the Bagratunies. Based on this information, the most probable time frame in which Amberd was built is likely the 10th century.\n\nThe first written notes about Amberd relate to the 11th century. The Middle Age historian Vardan Bardzraberdci said: ”King Gagik died in 444 and gave the kingdom to his three sons: Hovhannes, Abbas, and Ashot. He gave the crown to Hovhannes. He also gave him the Ani and Shirak kingdoms, Amberd, lowland Ararat, Kayan, Kaytson, and Tavoosh provinces. The other regions he gave to Ashot and Abbas.”\n\nAmberd was a significant fortress during Gagik’s time. This is likely why Amberd was given to Hovhannes-Smbat after his father’s death.\n\nThe Pahlavuni dynasty’s role was vital in the Bagratuni kingdom. They were the most faithful princes of Bagratid kings, protecting the country. Because of this, Amberd was entrusted to the Pahlavunies.\n\nThe Pahlavunies’ role grew in the 11th century. This role grew even more during the reigns of both Hovhannes-Smbat and Gagik II. Hovhannes-Smbat was a very effeminate ruler, so the Pahlavunies took the kingdom into their hands.\n\nOne of the Pahlavunies, Vahram Pahlavuni, was a very patriotic prince. During his time, Byzantine aggression increased. Vahram demolished the Byzantine army with a brilliant victory. The Byzantines could not invade Amberd or the Bagratunies’ capital, Ani. In the last years of Vahram’s life, he devoted his attention to the Amberd fortress.\n\nIn 1045, Gagik II was called to Constantinople. Emperor Monomakh compelled him to abandon Ani in order to give it to the Byzantines. The inhabitants of Ani wanted to give Ani to the Georgian king Bagrat IV; the castle was given to Bagrat’s mother, Queen Mariam.\n\nAll nine fortresses were given to Georgians except for Amberd. At the time, Vahram was still living there. He did not want to give anything to the Georgians or the Byzantines. Amberd remained Vahram’s castle till his death in 1048, under Dvin’s walls. His son Grigor died with him.\n\nZakare and Ivane Zakarians liberated Amberd and the whole Aragatsotn province from Seljuk Turks who had invaded it in the 1070s. Amberd was given to Vacheh Vachutian.\n\nVacheh called himself Amberdci, a word in Armenian that means “a man from Amberd.” Vacheh used to live in Amberd, and it became his administrative center. Many of the buildings of Amberd relate to this period, including a new room on the east side of the fortress, new gates, a pond, restoration of the bathhouse and chapel.\n\nVachutian Vacheh is famous based on lapidary inscriptions. His wife was named Mamakhatun; she also participated in the construction of many beautiful buildings. Vacheh and Mamakhatun supported the construction of various churches in the region.\n\nQurd Vachutian, Vacheh’s son, left Amberd. Vardenis village, located in front of Mount Ara, became a governmental seat. The King of Kilikia, Hetum I, came to Qurd when Hetum was visiting Möngke Khan.\n\nAfter the Mongolian invasions, Qurd Vachutian was the first person who called himself an Amberdci, allowing the Vachutians to regain the fortress. When Qurd Amberdci died around 1343, his son Chrqeen became the lord of Amberd province.\n\nThe fact that the Vachutians were given Aragatsotn province and Amberd proved that the Vachutians were very faithful and powerful vassals of the Zakarians. Aragatsotn was essential during the Zakarian and Bagratuni dynasties as it was the southeastern military base.\n\nAmberd’s role increased as a protective fortress during the Zakarian dynasty. During the Vachutians’ rule, Amberd became their administrative center because it was in the middle of the province. In the 14th century, “the province of Amberd” meant “the province of Ararat.” The Vachutians strengthened it and built more extensive fortifications and many other buildings. It should be noted that while this was the case, the real owners of Amberd were the Zakarians.\n\nFood\n\nHarisa, also known as qashika, is a delicious Armenian dish with ancient origins. Mkrtich Khrimian (Khrimian Hayrik) told a story about harisa in his book. A pot of harisa would be placed into a furnace overnight and served the following day. The name of the dish comes from the phrase “hari sa,” which means “mix this.”\n\nWomen in Amberd made wrapped dolma with grape or cabbage leaves. Dolma has been cooked since the beginning of Armenian history and is believed to have originated in Armenia.\n\nPanrakhash is a rural, primitive dish served for a typical, everyday dinner. It was and still is cooked in all Armenian regions, and there are many variants. Panrakhash can be made with fried onion or hot red peppers and garlic. It can be made with eggs, cheese, dry lavash, and bread and is cooked in water during preparation.\n\nWater\n\nWater was of paramount importance to the life of Amberd and for fortresses in general. No fortress would be built before the water supply issue had been resolved. Clay pipes brought water into the fortress from a distance of several kilometers, but enemies could obstruct these during a siege. For this reason, the issue of reservoir construction in all medieval fortresses became a matter of special concern.\n\nIn case of a failure of the pipes or their detection by enemies, the defenders needed another water reservoir, so many secret paths were built to bring water from Amberdadzor. One begins inside Amberd, south of the fortress, and reaches the river.\n\nNatural stones were used to construct these secret paths—hewn from the rock if needed. This was a regular and extensive road. The entrance starts inside the enclosure, then goes down, turns west, and continues to the river. To make the entrance of this secret path safer and more protected, special walls were built on two opposite cliffs that guard the way. Secret paths acted as a means of communication with the outside world during the fortress siege.\n\nLifestyle\n\nCenturies ago, guests entered the castle via broad stone stairs leading to the upper floors’ staterooms. A guest would enjoy cool water brought in from distant mountain springs. They could relax after a tiring journey among luxurious carpets and tapestries.\n\nWhen the first star showed up in the sky, the aroma of resins streamed from censers. Amber wine imported from Ashtarak or Vagharshapat gardens was poured into fancy cups and painted bowls for the guests to enjoy.\n\nAmberd had an important military role. The Seljuks strengthened the fortress, rather than destroying it when they conquered the land. Meliqshah had wanted the fortress destroyed when he took possession of it. Nizam al-Mulq did not let him do that because the fortress created a robust defensive border for the Seljuks. Meliqshah decided to strengthen the fortress instead, providing a garrison and food for its inhabitants.\n\nThe name of the fortress\n\nScholars believe that “Anberd” was the fortress’s original name, and the name “Amberd” appeared later. The name “Anberd” is used in some inscriptions; only once have we seen “Amberd.” Almost all authors of the Middle Ages used “Anberd,” with the exception of Grigror Pahlavuni.\n\nAcademician Gr. Ghaphantsyan believed that Anberd became Amberd due to assimilation. He said that the word “Anberd” means “fortress of God,” as “An” means “God” in the region’s ancient language of Khurit, and “berd” means “fortress” in Armenian.\n\nThe Khurits were pagans, and there was no fortress-like Amberd at that time, so this may not be the case. The variant of “Anberd,” which means “without fortress,” is incorrect. Amberd means “fortress in the clouds” and is more likely to be the intended meaning.\n\nMount Aragats\n\nMount Aragats is the highest point in the South Caucasus Mountains at 4,090 meters. It is a permanent home for mountaineers and has unique natural features, including sub-alpine and alpine zones and four peaks. The northern peak is 4090m, the western is 4080m, the eastern is 3916m, and the southern peak is 3879m high.\n\nThere is a legend about Mount Aragats. According to this legend, St. Grigor Lusavorich climbed to the mountain to say a prayer. At that very moment, a beacon of light came down upon him from heaven. The legend says the heavenly light still appears, but only chosen people can see it.\n\nYou can see the beautiful mountain lake Kari on Aragats, located 3250m above the sea. All Armenians adore Mount Aragats. They are grateful to the mountain; some say thank you to it every day.\n\nThe new entrance of Amberdadzor\n\nThe most significant building of the second period is the double entrance of Amberd, with its rectangular tower. It is located 30 meters north of the former gate and connected to the old gate from the west side by walls and conical pyramids. From the west side, the wall continues to the northern part of Amberd.\n\nThis was a strong defense measure for the fortress. Its structure is similar to the Arkhashan gate in that they both employ a two-centered arch and are protected by a quadrangular tower on one side and an enclosure on the other. A tower-like building at the entrance of the tower, now mainly destroyed, was built to protect the gate.\n\nThere are two holes in the external wall of this building. They present as tiny slits on the outer wall and widen as they travel inwards so that one soldier can stand by one hole and shoot with a wide horizontal range without sacrificing the reliable protection of the building’s walls. A rectangular tower protects the western gate.\n\nExamples of so-called Cyclopean masonry can also be found among the enclosures, but they are mostly made of lime mortar and ashlars. Construction with small stones and hard lime mortar is typical of the second construction period. The voids, or empty spaces, between the rows’ walls are also filled with lime mortar, and master’s signs can be found on specific stones.\n\nIn the first period, the fortress was made of processed basalt stones bound with hard lime mortar. The stones weren’t closely fitted together, and most had rounded corners; the junction areas between the stones were filled with lime mortar. During this period, the only entry to the fortress was from the southern side, from inside the fortress: One had first to enter the gates of the Amberd Gorge and then enter the fortress from that door. This entry is small and is safely protected by the basalt door, which rotates around an axis supported by thick logs that enter into the special matching holes on the inside walls.\n\nThe bathhouse\n\nThe bath house is located about 70 km from the fortress, near the eastern enclosure, and is a vital part of Amberd. Bathhouses were common in big cities; Ani had seven, while Dvin had four or five.\n\nIt is constructed using polished basalt and clay. During the time period it was built, no clay was used in residential areas or government buildings, so this is very unusual. The entrance to the bathhouse had low stairs, and tiny red squares were embedded in the walls.\n\nThe layout of the bathhouse is a rectangle with three rooms: a fireplace room, bathroom, and cloakroom.\n\nThe cloakroom and bathroom each measure 25 m2. The fireplace room is vaulted and small, while the other rooms are domed with open skylights to let in light. Hot air and smoke traveled into the bathhouse from the firehouse and vented through four clay pipes to the roof.\n\nThe cloakroom’s tiled floor was raised to allow piping, which heated the building. Waste was removed through a different set of pipes.\n\nScientists believe the bathhouse was constructed sometime between the 10th and 12th centuries.\n\nThe bridge and the watermill\n\nAmberd’s church inscription mentions the existence of a bridge, a watermill, and a gristmill. The roads to Amberd are between two rivers overflowing in the spring. During that season, it would be tough to cross without a bridge. The ruins of this bridge no longer exist.\n\nAmberd had several watermills. The inscription reads, “…jaghacn karmnchin vera…” In old Armenian, there was a watermill on the bridge, differentiating this particular watermill from the others in the region.\n\nThe houses\n\nAmberd was initially built as an apartment for Amberd’s lords. The homes had expansive rooms and southern-oriented windows, allowing light and warmth.\n\nThese houses have ruins; some of the walls are still visible. These walls were likely covered in wooden logs but were made with polished basalt. These houses were built long before the fortress existed.\n\nThe apartment complexes\n\nDuring the 1963 excavations, an apartment complex was unearthed near the western enclosure that, judging from archaeological materials, dates back to the thirteenth century. The complex consists of an oblong rectangular/quadrangular habitable room (30 square meters). The walls are built of half-hewn large basalt stones bound with earthen mortar. The enclosure acts as one of the walls of the room. Two other smaller buildings were unearthed adjacent to this room, natural auxiliary buildings. In 1964, excavations were conducted in a part of another apartment complex on the southern edge of the fortress that unearthed a ton-ratoon—a traditional Armenian bread bakery—and a small, luxurious living space (eight square meters). The walls are built of carefully hewn, 50 cm high basalt stones. An ornately sculptured belt stretches upward from the first row of the walls. The room is cobbled. It is noteworthy that the walls of this luxuriously constructed room were also built without any lime mortar. It must have been included in the apartment complex because a lot of household articles, including large amounts of pottery items, were discovered here.\n\nDuring the excavations conducted in 1963-1964, the following items were unearthed:\n\nMany beautiful khachkars (cross-stone)\n\nTriangular sculpted stone found in the vicinity of the church\n\nA bronze candlestick\n\nA shield found in the Citadel\n\nThe water cleaning-filtering cask\n\nA lance\n\nA circular lance\n\nLances found in 1968\n\nA tetrahedral arrowhead\n\nA rhomboid arrowhead\n\nA big ax\n\nIron knives\n\nStonemason’s hammer\n\nA hackle\n\nParts of a sickle\n\nA bronze tap\n\nThe excavations carried out in Amberd in the year 1936 and during 1963-1968 have produced abundant archaeological material, much of which is pottery. Though the excavations were not carried out on a large scale, the findings stand out with their number and significance.\n\nAmberd now\n\nIf you are a tourist who wants to visit Armenia, you should definitely visit the ancient fortress of Amberd. It is a fantastic place that shows the power and glory of its kings and lords.\n\nA trip to Amberd can be a wild adventure, mostly because reaching the fortress is difficult in the cold seasons. The perfect time to visit Aragatsotn province is late spring, summer, and early autumn.\n\nAmberd is reachable by car, autobus, and bicycle from Armenia’s Capital of Yerevan or many other regional cities and towns. The roads in Armenia have been recently renovated and are in excellent condition. The highway to Aragats was included in this renovation.\n\nAs the road to Amberd starts to ascend, you will pass through an old village with an ancient graveyard full of stone markers. As you continue, you will see only stones and lots of them. The temperature will begin to drop as you get closer to the fortress. The wind is pretty strong and cold at an altitude of more than 2,000 m.\n\nThere are some gorgeous mountain streams on the way to Amberd. Located on a cliff and visible from afar, the fortress stands harmonious with its surroundings. The view is breathtaking."
