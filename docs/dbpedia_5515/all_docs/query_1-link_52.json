        "text": "Back to Catholicos of All Armenians\n\nHis Holiness Karekin II, the Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians, was born in the village Voskehat, near Etchmiadzin, in 1951, and was given the baptismal name Ktrij.\n\nHe received his elementary education in his native village, subsequent to which, in 1965, he was admitted to the Kevorkian Theological Academy in Holy Etchmiadzin, where he graduated with distinction. Upon graduation he taught New Testament Studies and was an Assistant at the Seminary. Having been ordained a deacon before his graduation, he was ordained a celibate priest in 1972 and was given the name Karekin.\n\nFollowing his ordination to the Holy Priesthood, the late Catholicos Vazken I, of blessed memory, arranged for the young priest to pursue higher religious education at the local faculty of Divinity in Vienna, Austria. In 1975, the future Catholicos served at the Church in Germany as a pastor, while continuing his theological studies at the University of Bonn. After four years in Germany, he returned to the Holy See, and was sent by Catholicos Vazken to Zagorsk, Russia, to pursue his studies at the doctoral Faculty of St. Serguey Monastery’s Academy of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nFollowing his studies in Russia, His Holiness was appointed to be the assistant to the Vicar general of the Araratian Patriarchal Diocese in 1980. In April 1983, he became the Vicar General of the same Diocese. In October of the same year, he was ordained a Bishop and in 1992, he was elevated to the rank of Archbishop. In 1990, he was a candidate to the Armenian legislature.\n\nIn 1989, Bishop Karekin Nersissian created the Vazkenian Seminary in Sevan to educate young men in religious studies, completing a five-year course prior to the entrance to the Theological Academy at Holy Etchmiadzin, where they would study for one additional year. Additionally, through his efforts, the former Communist Pioneer Palaces were converted into church-sponsored youth centers for religious and artistic education of young men and women.\n\nIn 1990, His Holiness created the Christian Education Center, which organized Christian Education courses in 56 public and Sunday schools throughout the Diocese.\n\nIn 1995, Archbishop Karekin Nersissian was a prime candidate in the Catholicossal Elections, but he withdrew his candidacy in favor of Catholicos Karekin I, of blessed memory. In 1998, the late Catholicos appointed him as Catholicossal Vicar General.\n\nSince 1990 he was a member of the Supreme Spiritual Council of the Catholicosate of All Armenians.\n\nOn October 27, 1999, as a result of the closed secret ballot election held in the Cathedral of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, Archbishop Karekin Nersissian was elected the 132nd Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians and was consecrated on November 4, 1999.\n\n* * *\n\nSince his election, His Holiness has begun the difficult work of the restructuring and reorganization of internal church life, the revitalization of the theological seminaries of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, strengthening Christian education, and the reconstruction of churches and monasteries. Special emphasis has been placed on the preparation of a new generation of clergy to serve Armenian faithful throughout the world.\n\nDuring the first year of his pontificate, His Holiness founded the Theological-Armenological Center, named after His Holiness Karekin I, of blessed memory. It is currently housed in the Alex and Marie Manoogian Treasury-Museum of the Mother See. Clergy, intellectuals and artists have the opportunity to make use of the rich literary resources of the Center.\n\nShortly following his enthronement, His Holiness made his first pilgrimage to Jerusalem to visit the Holy Shrines, Churches and places. During his stay, he presided over the Christmas Celebrations in the Holy City.\n\nHis Holiness has paid pontifical visits to the Dioceses of the Armenian Church of Shirak and Artsakh (July and September 2000), Western and Eastern Dioceses of the USA, Diocese of Canada (May 2001). During the pontifical visit to North America His Holiness presided over the diocesan festivities, dedicated to the 1700th Anniversary of Proclamation of Christianity as the National Religion of Armenia. During that period His Holiness has had meetings with His Excellency George W. Bush, President of the United States of America, and Mr. Kofi Anan, Secretary-General of the United Nations. His Holiness was officially received in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate during his visit. To honor the 1700th Anniversary of Armenia's conversion to Christianity, and to welcome His Holiness Karekin II to the United States, the House of Representatives passed a resolution (with the Senate concurring) on May 23, 2001. His Holiness has paid pontifical visits also to Austria (November 2001) and France (December 2001). During the pontifical visit to France His Holiness had a meeting with His Excellency Jacques Chirac, President of France.\n\nPlacing importance on the fostering of ecumenical ties, His Holiness has paid visits to the sister churches and their heads, among them – the Russian Orthodox Church and her leader, His Holiness Alexy II, Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia; the Georgian Orthodox Church and her leader, His Holiness Ilia II, Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia; the Romanian Orthodox Church and her leader, His Holiness Patriarch Teoctist; the Coptic Orthodox Church and her leader, His Holiness Pope Shenouda III; His Holiness Abuna Paulos, Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church; the Roman Catholic Church and her leader, His Holiness Pope John Paul II, and His Holiness Patriarch Maxim, Head of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.\n\nOn the occasion of the Armenian Pontiff’s visit to the Vatican (November 2000) during the solemn ecumenical celebration, Pope John Paul II returned to His Holiness Karekin II the relics of St. Gregory the Illuminator, the first Catholicos of the Armenian Church. The Armenian Pontiff and the Pope have signed a joint communiqué, in which the massacres of Armenians by the Turkish state and authorities in the early part of the 20th Century are characterized as Genocide.\n\nAmong the representatives and heads of other religions, His Holiness has had meetings with Sheikh Tantawi of Al Azhar, Mufti of the Arab Republic of Egypt; and Sheikh Ul-Islam Allah-Shukur Pashazade, the Spiritual Leader of Moslems of the Caucasus. During the meeting of His Holiness Karekin II and Allah-Shukur Pashazade, (November 2000) held by the mediation of His Holiness Alexy II, a joint communiqué has been signed in favor of the peaceful resolution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.\n\nIn August 2000, His Holiness participated in the \"Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders,\" held at the United Nations headquarters in New York City. He delivered an address to the assembly entitled “Towards Forgiveness and Reconciliation”.\n\nNumerous newly built churches have been consecrated, foundations of new churches have been blessed, and reconstruction of historic monasteries and monastic complexes has been completed during the leadership of His Holiness. Among them are the Church of Holy Resurrection in Spitak; the Church of St. Sarkis in Nork District, Yerevan; the Church of St. Trdat in Vayk; the Church of St. Sarkis in Tashir; the Church of St. Anna in Malishka; the Chapel of St. Mary in Aghavnadzor; the Church of Holy Savior in Charentsavan; the Church of St. Gregory of Narek in Alaverdi; the Church of St. Mesrob Mashtots in Kapan; the Church of St. Mary in Arinj; the Church of St. James (Hakop) in Gyumri; the bell tower of the diocesan headquarters Church of St. Sarkis in Yerevan; the Church of Holy Resurrection in Dvin; the Church of St. Katharine in St. Petersburg; the Church of St. George in Mughni; the Monastic Complex of Saghmosavank (Monastery of Psalms”); the Monastic Complex of Kecharis in Tsaghkadzor; the Church of St. Yeghishe in London; the Church of the Holy Cross in Aparan and the Monastic Complex of the village Marmashen. A new open-air Altar bearing the name of the Armenian King Tiridat III and near it the new entrance to the Mother See bearing the name St. Gregory the Illuminator, were built on the grounds of the Mother See in celebration of 1700th Anniversary of Proclamation of Christianity as the Official Religion of Armenia.\n\nIn September 23, 2002, His Holiness presided during the consecration ceremonies for the St. Gregory the Illuminator Mother Cathedral built in Yerevan on the occasion of the 1700th Anniversary of the Great Conversion of the Armenians. The Cathedral, which bears the stamp of three Armenian Pontiffs, is the largest Armenian Church in the world, dedicated to the memory of Saint Gregory the Illuminator, and a gift to the over 1 million people of the capital city of Yerevan. Also, in September 2001, the activities surrounding the 1,700th Anniversary reached their peak when His Holiness blessed the Holy Chrism for the entire Armenian Church, which is used to consecrate churches, baptize infants, and ordain priests.\n\nDuring the 1,700th Jubilee Year, one of the most important events was His Holiness’ pilgrimage to Der Zor, Syria, in April 2001. It was in this desert where countless numbers of Armenians perished as they were exiled out of the historic homeland during the Armenian Genocide. On April 24, Commemoration Day for the victims of the Armenian Genocide, His Holiness celebrated a solemn Divine Liturgy in the Church of Holy Martyrs.\n\nIn July 2001, His Holiness called upon Armenian youth from throughout the world to unite together in Holy Etchmiadzin for a Youth Pilgrimage. Over 2,000 young men and women from within Armenia and the Diaspora participated in this historic event.\n\nAlso in September, His Holiness was host to countless leaders of Christian Churches, who came to participate in the 1700th Anniversary activities. Among those who visited were His Holiness Baselios Mar Thomas Mathews II, Catholics of the East, Catholicos of the Apostolic Throne of St. Thomas and Malankara Metropolitan; His Beatitude Petros VII, Patriarch of Alexandria and All Africa; His Holiness Teoctist I, Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church; His Holiness Alexy II, Head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia; His Holiness Pope John Paul II, Patriarch of the West and Bishop of Rome, Head of the Roman Catholic Church; His All Holiness Bartholomew I, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, and Dr. George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury and Head of the Anglican Church.\n\nAmong the most important and vital steps taken during the pontificate of His Holiness is the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of the Republic of Armenia and the Holy Armenian Church, in March 2000, which has become the basis of an agreement which clarifies and regulates the Church-State relationship. Within the framework of a memorandum, a Cooperative Agreement on the spiritual service of the Armenian Church in the National Army of the Republic of Armenia was signed in September 2000, which established the field of spiritual service in the armed forces. And finally, a historic agreement between the Armenian Church and the Government of the Republic of Armenia was signed in August 2002, stating that Armenian Church History will be taught in all public schools of the Republic.\n\nHis Holiness Karekin II is a member of the Board of Trustees of the “Hayastan” All Armenian Fund, and an Honorary Member of the Board of Directors of the Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU).\n\nHis Holiness has been awarded an Honorary Doctorate of the State University of Artsakh.
