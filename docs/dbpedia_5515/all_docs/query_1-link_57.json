        "text": "Description:\n\nThe Yereruyk basilica (Ереруйкская базилика) is one of the rarest, and earliest Christian architectural monuments and archaeological sites in Armenia that dates back to the 5th century. It is located 8km South of Ani, the ancient Armenian capital. This monument was included in the UNESCO World Heritage tentative list in 1995. Along the way, include a visit to the Jrapi Caravanserai as well. This is a unique tuff-stone structure that was built to shelter people that traveled along ancient caravan routes.\n\nDescription:\n\nYou will have the chance to meet with a local clergyman who represents the Shirak region diocese on this tour. We will take you on a tour of two of Gyumri’s central churches, explore exclusive areas that are customarily closed to the public, and learn about the significance behind particular manuscripts and unique religious art works.\n\nDescription:\n\nThis tour explores the monastery complex of Harich (Аричский монастырь) and the village of Harichanaq. Discover for yourself what life is like in one of the oldest villages of the Shirak region, Harich, which lies on the western slope of the Aragats Mountains. After visiting the church, walk the streets of the village and learn of its history. Later in the day, we will travel a short distance to visit a fascinating cemetery, which according to villagers has been around long before the 7th century.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe monastic complex, known as Marmashen Vank (Монастырь Мармашен) is located on a bluff overlooking the left bank of the Akhurian River, 15km northwest of Gyumri in the Shirak region. An inscription on the south wall of the main church beholds engravings, revealing that it was built between 986 and 1029 by Price Vahram Pahlavuni. The village of Marmashen is known for its cross-stones and the monastery complex with King Argishti I inscriptions."
