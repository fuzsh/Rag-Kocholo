        "text": "Getting to Gyumri independently from Yerevan is easy enough. You can either take a marshrutka (minibus) or a train. Marshrutkas depart regularly from outside Zoravor Andranik metro station, and the ride lasts a few hours. The train, meanwhile, departs at 8am.\n\nYou can also get to Gyumri directly from Georgia, such as Tbilisi or other towns near the border.\n\nWhile I’d been considering going there on my own, I also wanted to make sure to visit the Black Fortress and one of the main monasteries out of town. Even if I were to surpass the language barrier and strike a deal with a taxi driver in town, I estimated that the taxi fare to see the extra sites would come out to around the same as a group tour.\n\nTherefore, I opted for the day tour with One Way Tour. They informed me that only an Armenian language tour would be available, but I didn’t mind as I was mainly concerned with transport.\n\nRiding with the Armenian language tour was a unique experience. Unlike with the English/Russian tours, the driver was blasting Armenian folk songs (or at least modern renditions of them) for the entire day.\n\nIt was rather annoying in the beginning, especially in the early morning, as I was hoping to do some reading on the bus. But I got used to it by afternoon, and it was fun to see the passengers clapping and singing along.\n\nWhile I couldn’t understand a thing the tour guide was saying all day, I was pleasantly surprised to find several English speakers on the tour with me. One woman was even kind enough to translate the important and interesting bits of information to me for most of the day!\n\nFor whatever reason, accommodation prices in Yerevan are considerably higher than those of nearby Tbilisi. This is in spite of most other things, like food and transport, costing the same amount. If budget isn’t an issue for you, then you should base yourself in the city center (within the circle or just outside of it).\n\nYerevan makes a great base from which to explore many other parts of Armenia. If you’re doing an extended stay in the city and want to save some money, staying outside the center will be fine. Just make sure that you’re within close distance of a metro station.\n\nI stayed at Glide Hostel which I’d highly recommend for budget travelers. I opted for the private room with a private bathroom, but they also have some shared bathroom and dorm options available.\n\nThe guesthouse is located about 5 minutes on foot from Baregamutyun Station, the northernmost metro station. But you can still walk to the city center in about 30 minutes if the weather is nice. The staff were friendly and helpful, and a tasty breakfast was provided each morning.\n\nBooking.com"
