        "text": "Post-Soviet Years (1991-2004)\n\nHis Holiness Vasken I\n\nHis Holiness Karekin I\n\nHis Holiness Karekin II\n\nDuring the period of Soviet Communism, almost all the Armenian churches were closed down in Armenia, Artsakh and in all the republics of the Soviet Union. Some of the churches were destroyed, most of them were turned into public buildings and storehouses, while some notable monasteries were preserved as historical monuments. All religious activity was prohibited. After World War II, the Church was authorized to re-open several churches and reconstruct some historical monasteries. During the early Soviet years, the church and clergy were persecuted, following World War II, they were merely tolerated with limited rights. During this time, the Armenians living in the motherland and throughout the Soviet Union were devoid of Christian Education and spiritual freedom. Armenians living in the Diaspora were limited in their direct contact with the Mother Church and the clergy were cautious in their ability to openly interact with the Catholicosate of All Armenians.\n\nHis Holiness Vasken I\n\nThis situation changed in 1991, when after the collapse of the Soviet Union the Armenian nation obtained independence and proclaimed the second independent Republic of Armenia. His Holiness Vasken I, Catholicos of All Armenians of blessed memory, was present on the floor of the parliament the day that the referendum for freedom was voted on, and he blessed the members of the first government and the first page of its history starting a new beginning of close cooperation between the Church and the State. With independence of the nation, came the freedom of the Armenian Church to openly serve her faithful worldwide.\n\nA new spiritual awakening commenced in the newly independent Motherland and that national awakening was expressed in all walks of life. The great achievements made by the efforts of His Holiness Vazken I, sought to answer the needs of the faithful.\n\nIn Armenia, with the new law \"Freedom of Conscience\", the Armenian Church undertook the sacred obligation of illuminating the life and soul of our nation with the light of the Holy Gospel. The call for additional clergy for the Diaspora was quickly addressed as a high priority. Naturally, with their first breath the nation thirsted for spiritual nourishment. The evidence of it was the call for re-opening of numerous churches, the desire to recognize and celebrate church-national feasts, the demand of the necessity to recognize the Mother Church, and the quick reaction of elation and support from the Diaspora. The Church also needed to impart to the new generation of faithful, the role and significance of the Armenian Church in the life of the nation.\n\nRecovery within the country started with the re-opening of Churches. From 1988 to 1989, 25 monasteries and churches were returned; 19 in Armenia and 6 in Artsakh.\n\nEducation was an important aspect for the faithful. On October 20 1990, the Bible Association of Armenia was founded with the blessing of His Holiness, Vazken I which started to prepare for publication a new translation of the Bible into Eastern Armenian. To organize the educational works, in 1990, under the presidency of Vazken I, the Christian Preaching Center was established in the Headquarters of Araratian Diocese, with the initial purpose of organizing religious preaching and spiritual courses at schools and educational institutions in different regions of Armenia. The center has since become the Christian Education Department of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin.\n\nTo quickly reach a wider audience, electronic media was used. The \"Khoran Lusoy\" religious program was regularly produced and broadcast on Public Television.\n\nIn the days following independence, attention was also turned to the preparation of activities for the celebration of the 1700th Anniversary of the Proclamation of Christianity as the State Religion of Armenia. Within the frameworks of these events, it was planned to build the St. Gregory the Illuminator Mother Cathedral in Yerevan: the ground blessing ceremony was conducted by His Holiness Vazken I on March 31, 1991.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union there was a need to reconstruct the canonical and administrative life of the Armenian Church. According to the traditional order of the Church an Episcopal meeting was called and held on February 14, 1991. The Episcopal meeting, held under the presidency of His Holiness Vazken I, established \"Armenian church regulations over the Churches of the Republic of Armenia and Soviet Union\". These regulations consisted of 94 articles and were adopted on March 2, 1991, by the 1758th Encyclical of the Catholicos of All Armenians was put into practice in Armenia and in the interior Dioceses of the Soviet Union.\n\nOn March 20 of the same year, the Supreme spiritual Council was re-established. The interior Dioceses were organized according to the regulations as follows:\n\n1. Araratian Pontifical Diocese\n\n2. Diocese of Shirak\n\n3. Diocese of Gougark\n\n4. Diocese of Syunik\n\n5. Diocese of Artsakh\n\n6. Diocese of Georgia\n\n7. Diocese of Russia and Nor Nakhitchevan\n\n8. Region of the Ukraine\n\n9. Pastorate of Moldavia\n\nIn all these Dioceses, the spiritual life started to be organized little by little. Under the guidance of the Church, numerous religious organizations were founded.\n\nAs the year 2001 approached, work continued on organizing the world-wide events and celebrations of the 1700th Anniversary of the Proclamation of Christianity as the State Religion of Armenia. The planning of activities was a central focus for His Holiness Vazken I. In 1994 from May 6 to 9, under the presidency of Vazken I, despite his failing health, planning meetings were held with the leaders of the Hierarchical Sees were they discussed the projects and activities for the 1700th anniversary.\n\nIt is unfortunate that these favorable historical times came only during the last years of the Pontifical reign of His Holiness Vazken I, as all the above-mentioned successes were achieved through his strength and self-sacrificing devotion. His Holiness Vazken I, died on August 18, 1994 after 39 years of Pontifical enthronement. He is indeed one of the builder Catholicoi of the Armenian Church.\n\nThe worthy successor of Vazken I, was His Holiness Karekin I, Catholicos of All Armenians of Blessed Memory (1995-1999). The short Pontifical reign of His Holiness Karekin I was also full of successes.\n\ntop of page\n\nHis Holiness Karekin I\n\nMany positive opportunities and resources were available to His Holiness Karekin I. The newly independent state did all it could to support all the actions of the Church and soon the achievements registered during the Pontifical enthronement of Karekin I were clearly evident.\n\nOn May 30, 1996 considering the new territorial divisions of the Republic of Armenia and the necessity to strengthen the religious and pastoral activities of the Church, reforms were made in the sphere of the Dioceses of the Armenian Church. Within the territories of Armenia new Diocese were created: the Dioceses of Gougark, Armavir, Kotyak, Aragotsotn and Gegharkounik. From the January 1997 meeting of the Supreme Spiritual Council, the decision was made to create separate Dioceses for the Diocese of Nor Nakhitchevan and Russia, the Armenian Diocese of Southern Russia, and the Armenian Diocese of the Ukraine.\n\nThere was a significant increase in the number of members of the Brotherhood of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, who, apart from their spiritual service in the Dioceses, went abroad to study in numerous higher educational institutions. The reopening of the original Gevorgian Theological building, that was returned to the Armenian Church during the years of Vazken I, was a memorable event. The Seminary building was closed and confiscated from the Church in 1917, and after 80 years it was re-opened on September 18 it with attendance by the first president of the Republic of Armenia Mr. Levon Ter-Petrosian.\n\nOn October 4, 1997 under the initiative of Karekin I, Catholicos of All Armenians the ground blessing of the new seminary dormitories was held. The structure was built to increase the capacity and improve the living conditions of the students of the Seminary.\n\nTo expand the cultural mission of the Mother See the Publishing-house started its work with new speed. In addition to the current publications such as the \"Etchmiadzin\" monthly, yearly calendar and prayer books, publishing commenced on literary studies and books on religion, philosophy, history.\n\nThe Armenian Church released from the restrictions of Communism started to freely preach in the Armenia. To organize those actions in a more effective way on November 1996, the Center of Christian Education and Preaching (now called the Christian Education Center) was founded with the blessing of Karekin I, Catholicos of All Armenians. The activities of the center centered on:\n\n1. Preparation of teachers\n\n2. Broadcasts on Radio and TV\n\n3. Publications\n\n4. Preparation of text-books and guide-books\n\nIt has its branches in all the Dioceses of Armenia and in Artsakh.\n\nTo help quickly expand the educational activities to the youth, in 1997, through the support and sponsorship of the three North American Dioceses: The Eastern and Western Diocese of the United States and the Canadian Diocese, schools were opened in Gyumri, Stepanavan and Itchevan.\n\nOn September 7, 1996, the relics of Catholicos Khoren Muradbekian were moved from the courtyard of the St. Gayane Church to the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin. His Holiness Khoren I had been murdered in 1938, and the Church had not been allowed to conduct a funeral service. His Holiness was reburied near the entrance of the Mother Cathedral and a proper burial service was conducted. His tomb was sealed and he took his proper place beside the tombs of the other Catholicoi.\n\nThe Armenian Church also engaged in social service projects.\n\nIn March 1997 World Councils of Churches launched a program in Armenia called \"the Armenian Round Table\". The office was established in the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin with the aim of implementing various projects on Christian education and church building in coordination with the Armenian Churches and NGO’s and to represent them to individuals and donor organizations.\n\nConstruction activities continued, the most significant of which was the construction of the St. Gregory the Illuminator Mother Cathedral in Yerevan. On April 7, 1997 Karekin I, Catholicos of All Armenians, blessed and consecrated four cornerstones for the Vestry in the names of St. Mark, St. Luke, St. Paul and St. Gregory the Illuminator and at the end of July he blessed twelve stones in the names of the twelve apostles for the foundation stones.\n\nFrom 1995 to 1997, important lands surrounding the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin were legally transferred back to the Armenian Church, including the Gevorgian Theological Seminary building and the adjacent park, and the territories surrounding the St. Gayane and St. Hripsime monasteries.\n\nDuring the Pontifical reign of Karekin I, Church-state relations strengthened.\n\nOn November 13, 1997 through the joint initiative of His Holiness Karekin I, and then Republic of Armenia Minister of Defense Vzaken Sargsian, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed signed between the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin and the Defense Ministry of Armenia, in which the sphere, goals and objectives and structure of an Armed Forces Ministry was specified and agreed upon.\n\nThis was the first time in history that the Armenian national Army had Army Chaplains assigned to within their ranks. In some units of the Army, chapels were built to allow for private prayer and meditation and the libraries of the Army were given spiritual literature. The Army Chaplains delivered lectures, counseled soldiers, organized pilgrimages and watched instructive films, while also conducting sacraments, services and other church ceremonies.\n\nUnfortunately, the illness of His Holiness Karekin I did not give him an opportunity to accomplish all that he wished within the short years of his enthronement. His Holiness Karekin I died on June 29, 1999.\n\ntop of page\n\nHis Holiness Karekin II\n\nIn October 1999 His Holiness Karekin II was elected to serve as the 132nd Catholicos of All Armenians, and the years of his enthronement have excelled in progressive and energetic activities.\n\nIn order to bring the life and works of the Mother See to the faithful, one of the focuses of His reign has been to make Pontifical visits to all the Armenian Diocese throughout the world and within Armenia. To strengthen the position of Armenian communities, official receptions and visitations have been made and held with various levels of religious and world leaders as well as government officials. (Press Releases)\n\nThe year 2001 was rich in church rites and ceremonies dedicated to the 1700th anniversary of Armenia’s adoption of Christianity as the state religion; it was a year full of spiritual and scientific-cultural ceremonies world-wide. Within the frameworks of celebrations of the 1700th anniversary, many conferences were held, exhibitions were opened, pilgrimages were organized to the sacred sanctuaries and a number of books and albums were published. A service of Blessing of the Holy Oil (Muron) was held, the St. Gregory the Illuminator Mother Cathedral of Yerevan was consecrated, Episcopal ordinations were held and numerous religious leaders and heads of state came to honor the Armenian Church.\n\nFrom the beginning of his Pontifical reign, His Holiness Karekin II gave great attention to the organization of the Brotherhood of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin. Recurring Brotherhood meetings were held to discuss different issues concerning the role of the Armenian Church in social life and the life and activity of the monastery.\n\nHis Holiness, signifying the necessity of having clergymen prepared to serve the varying needs of our faithful world-wide, initiated a program of sending members of the Brotherhood abroad to continue their theological education in higher educational institutions.\n\nAs a result of the spiritual awakening the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin became one of the larger employers within Armenia. Over 2500 people work in the various departments and programs of the Mother See and the individual Dioceses in Armenia.\n\nAnother priority identified by His Holiness was Church building. From 1999 to 2004 in all the Armenian Dioceses numerous new churches were built and consecrated, and many destroyed churches were reconstructed and sanctified.\n\nCoordination between Church and State was increased. Work between the church and state authorities was carried out in the areas of cultural and economic projects as well as social aid.\n\nWithin the frameworks of that close cooperation more than 180 monasteries, churches and church properties were returned to the Mother See.\n\nOn September 14, 2000 by the efforts of His Holiness Karekin II, an agreement on the service of the Army Chaplains was affirmed with the parameters outlined and signed by the Mother See and the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Armenia. The guidelines provided an opportunity to organize the issues concerning the rights and responsibilities of the Army Chaplains. Also, the agreement outlined the authority and responsibility of a Prison Ministry Program.\n\nDuring the time of communism, buildings called Youth palaces were constructed throughout Yerevan, in order to spread the doctrine of the communist party and atheism to the children of Armenia. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, these \"Youth palaces\" were abandoned, although some remained in operation with volunteer staffs.\n\nSeeing an opportunity for the Church to provide services to the youth, His Holiness, who was then the Vicar of the Araratian Pontifical Diocese, made proposals to government officials to acquire the buildings in Yerevan. His Holiness’ idea was that in utilizing these same buildings, the youth could continue to be served by the Armenian Church.\n\nIn 1993, with the help and sponsorship of the Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU), the Armenian Church acquired management rights of three of the buildings, one each in the Yerevan suburbs of Nork, Arabkir and Malatia. They were renamed \"Youth Centers\" or \"Hayortats Tner\". After-school programs were immediately started, and youth turned to the centers as a learning base and social gathering place.\n\nUnder the auspices of the Youth Centers are also the home for the aged in the city of Etchmiadzin, the guest house for the Youth Centers and the \"Masis\" boarding house in Aghveran. The home for the aged is located on V. Kostanian street in Vagharshapat. The architectural design drawings have been completed, and in 2006, the renovation work shall commence. The institution is capable of housing 40 senior citizens.\n\nIn 1992, The Mother See in partnership with and through the sponsorship of the AGBU opened the first of eventually six Soup Kitchens to be operated in Armenia.\n\nSeeing a need to serve and assist the most vulnerable members of society, the Soup Kitchens were opened to address the growing poverty problems that the government was not able to manage. As Armenia continues in her rebuilding and recovery, there continues to be large segments of society who are unable to adequately feed themselves on the small pensions provided by the government.\n\nThrough the office of social service, food and clothes are distributed to the families belonging to the vulnerable class of the society, and toys are distributed through some of the kindergartens.\n\nIn the area of public health, an important mission is carried out through the former Proctology Institute, now called the St. Nerses the Great Medical Center. In 2001, the AGBU generously donated the institute to the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin. The donation allows the Armenian Church to continue in her service to the people, and expand the area of social service.\n\nHis Holiness continued the tradition started during the Pontifical reign of His Holiness Vazken I by organizing various celebrations and events in honor of notable Armenians who have contributed to the education and culture of the nation.\n\nOver the passing years, the publications of the Mother See were associated with the 1700th Anniversary of the Proclamation of Christianity as the State Religion of Armenia. Many books were published dedicated to the history, religion, traditions and mysteries of the Armenian Church. To avail these publications to guests and foreign readers, some of these books were translated into Russian, English and French.\n\nSignifying the role of television in the realization of spiritual preaching and interpretation of church life, the Pontiff of All Armenians transferred the \"Shoghakat\" TV studio from the Araratian Pontifical Diocese to the Mother See, expanding its activities.\n\nIn the TV studio of the Mother See, numerous films and programs are made dedicated to the history, traditions and mysteries of the Armenian Church, as well as to the other spheres of social life from the spiritual viewpoint.\n\nEvery week there are telecasts on National Television, and on the eve of church feasts and events clips are shown on different stations.\n\nThe computer department was also established in the Mother See to provide computer support and communication services to the internal departments of the Mother See allowing for a network to receive world information.\n\nTo present the Armenian Church on the World Wide Web as completely as possible, in 2002 an Internet Department was established to create the official website of the Armenian Apostolic Church. The website will contain necessary information about the history, spiritual heritage and current status of the Armenian Church, as well as the works of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin."
