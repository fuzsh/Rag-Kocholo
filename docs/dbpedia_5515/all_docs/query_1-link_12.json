        "text": "Gyumri is rich in churches. It is a city of old and new churches. In addition to the Armenian Apostolic Churches, Catholic and Russian churches have been built here.\n\nDprevank\n\nThe first church in Gyumri, Dprevank, was built in the 7th century, but, unfortunately, it has not been preserved. It was demolished in the 19th century to build a Russian fortress on the same site. Many churches were built in Gyumri in the 19th-21st centuries: St. Amenaprkich, St. Astvatsatsin or St. Seven Wounds, St. Nshan, Armenian Catholicos of the Holy Martyrs, St. Gregory the Illuminator, St. Michael the Archangel, Kumayri Basilica, St. George the Greek, Armenian Catholic Alexandra Russian, St. Cross of the Catholics, Russian of St. Arseni, Chapel of St. Sargis, as well as St. Hripsime (1991), St. Sargis (2008), St. Hagop (2002). Like all churches in Armenia, each of these churches has its own unique features and history.\n\nHoly Savior Church\n\nThe 19th century Holy Savior Church is located in Vardanants Square in Gyumri. It was built in the style of Ani Mother Cathedral. The architect is Master Tadeos Antikyan. It is said that he went to Ani by car every day to study the Catholic Church in detail, so that the Holy Savior would be as similar as possible to the Mother Cathedral.\n\nThe church was built with the help of a benefactor from Gyumri as well as the people Gyumri.\n\nSt. Astvatsatsin or St. Seven Wounds Church\n\nIn Vardanants Square there is also the 19th century St. Astvatsatsin or St. Seven Wounds Church, which is the head of the Shirak Diocese. It is named the Seven Wounds after the icon of the Virgin Mary “Seven Wounds”, painted by Luke the Evangelist.\n\nThe picture shows the Virgin Mary being wounded seven times out of the seven torments of Jesus. The church is built of stone. In its place there used to be a wooden chapel, where the icon was once found. The church functioned even during the years of the Soviet Union, when all the churches in Armenia were closed, except for the Mother Cathedral of Etchmiadzin.\n\nSt. Hakob Church\n\nSt. Hakob Church was built in 2002 in the newly built Ani district of Gyumri. This district, founded after the devastating earthquake of 1988, was quite far from the city’s churches. And after the earthquake, it was especially needed.\n\nSt. Hakob Church was built in the style of the medieval Ani St. Apostles Church, it is larger than the main church of St. Seven Wounds in Gyumri. The prayer hall of the church is very spacious, it can accommodate 500 people."
