Our program also exists because we realize that not all foods are beneficial, and it is important that children have access to proper nutrition. A balanced diet allows for steady growth and encourages healthy eating habits, which is crucial for young children in their developmental years.\n\nOur nutrition program has and continues to benefit kindergartners and parents in several ways. The most rewarding aspect of servicing these kindergartens is knowing that by providing proper nutrition, we are additionally increasing the attendance and enrollment rates in the kindergartens. In turn, this allows parents who often cannot provide daily meals for their children to have peace of mind that their children are being taken care of at kindergarten while they are working to provide for their household.\n\nBecause of our Angel Donors, who donate a set amount of allowance (monthly or annually) via our Angel Program, the children that attend the following kindergartens are able to receive the proper nourishment they deserve."
