He received his primary education at the Nersisian College of Istanbul. In 1969, his family repatriated to Armenia and settled in the city of Gyumri, where he continued and finished his primary education.\n\nIn 1978 he entered the Gevorkian Theological Seminary at the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin. In 1979 he deferred the continuation of his education to serve in the Soviet army. After the completion of his tour of duty, he continued his studies at the Seminary. He was ordained to the diaconate in 1985, by the Grand Sacristan of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, Archbishop Hoosik Santourian.

On 3 June 1996, by the Pontifical Encyclical of the Catholicos of All Armenians, Karekin I, he was appointed to serve as the Primate of the Diocese of Gougark.\n\nSebouh was consecrated as a Bishop on 15 June 1997 by Karekin I.
