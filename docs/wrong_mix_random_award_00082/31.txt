Former EastEnders star Chris Coghill has admitted that he struggled to find work following his controversial role as Tony King.

The actor joined the cast of the BBC One soap in July 2008 as paedophile Tony, who became involved in a child abuse storyline with Whitney Dean. His career hit a quieter spell afterwards but he is now returning to screens with a new role in ITV's Home Fires, playing a nice guy farmer.

Coghill told The Sun: "EastEnders killed my career a bit but to play Tony was such a great acting part because it was so far removed from myself.

"I play wrong 'uns in everything! When I got the script for this [Home Fires] I was like, 'Oh, he's really nice, let's look at the next episode. Oh, he's still really nice, and the next one - oh, gosh he's still really nice!'"

Coghill's EastEnders storyline sparked more than 200 viewer complaints to the BBC and Ofcom, though the broadcasting regulator eventually ruled that the issue was handled "appropriately and sensitively".

Whitney's story also inspired several victims of child abuse to inform the police and Coghill admits he is proud to have been part of the plot.

He said: "I got a massive array of people coming up to me and saying, 'I think you're brilliant in EastEnders and what you're doing is really important'.

"As a direct result of that storyline, about ten people said, 'That happened to me', and went to the police and there have been quite a few convictions.

"Being an actor doesn't really change people's lives but without being a w**ker, that did. And I'm proud of that."
