        "text": "Christopher Cazenove, who has died aged 64 after falling ill from septicaemia in February, always dreamed of being a film star, although his father – a brigadier in the Coldstream Guards – wanted him to follow in his footsteps. In the event, when Cazenove fulfilled his acting ambitions, he did so by a military route, making his name as the blue-eyed, clean-cut hero Lieutenant Richard Gaunt in The Regiment (1972-73).\n\nThe drama series traced the fortunes of the Cotswolds Regiment at the turn of the 19th century – from the Boer War to service in India – through the lives of two families, the Gaunts and the Brights. Cazenove's fame was confirmed when he was featured on the cover of Radio Times, and television was the medium in which he achieved his greatest success, above all in the glossy American soap opera Dynasty.\n\nThe old Etonian seemed happy to become typecast playing aristocrats. On television, he was also seen in Jennie, Lady Randolph Churchill (1974) as George Cornwallis-West, a Scots Guards captain and second husband of Winston's mother, and The Duchess of Duke Street (1976-77) as the wealthy Charlie Tyrrell, who has an affair with Louisa Trotter (Gemma Jones), the cook who becomes owner of the upper-class Bentinck Hotel.\n\nBut it was Dynasty that brought Cazenove international fame when he played Ben Carrington (1986-87), the evil brother scheming to steal back the family inheritance from Blake, played by John Forsythe, who died on 1 April. One of the \"dynamite\" storylines saw the pair in an oil rig explosion.\n\nDespite the confidence that might have come from such success and his private education, Cazenove admitted: \"I'm really an awfully uptight sort of person, partly a result of my upbringing. I think I worry terribly about things and I wish I could feel more relaxed socially – and in my work. Which is why I'd really prefer to play character parts. You acquire another personality when you put on false noses or beards.\"\n\nCazenove was born in Winchester, Hampshire, to a family with Huguenot ancestors who fled religious persecution in France. He was brought up in Somerset and attended Eton college, where he was known as a prankster. \"I was a rule-breaker,\" he recalled, \"and my first 'job' with Ranulph Fiennes was to mount a dustbin on top of the school hall.\" Once, he received a birching from the headteacher.\n\nOn leaving Eton after his A-levels, Cazenove worked as a nanny, then a chauffeur and handyman. He realised his acting ambitions when he trained at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School and worked with repertory theatre companies, making his stage debut in Man and Superman at the Phoenix theatre, Leicester, in 1967.\n\nWhile at the Pitlochry Festival theatre (1967-69), he played Hamlet. His first London appearance was as Courtenay in The Lionel Touch (alongside Rex Harrison, Lyric Theatre, 1970). In the West End, Cazenove acted John Watherstone in The Winslow Boy (1971) and Richard in Joking Apart (1979), before being cast as James Sinclair in the shortlived Broadway play Goodbye Fidel (1980).\n\nBut the actor who once described his favourite place as \"in front of a camera\" preferred performing on screen. His film debut was as Marc Antony's servant, alongside Charlton Heston, in Julius Caesar (1970).\n\nAfter his initial television success, Cazenove had a string of film roles but never gained top billing. He was Eric Hansen in the Victorian British Army swashbuckler Royal Flash (1975), the plantation owner Robert Proudfoot in the colonial drama East of Elephant Rock (1977) and the Zulu War hero Lieutenant Coghill in Zulu Dawn (1979).\n\nIn Heat and Dust (1982), Cazenove played another colonialist, a man whose wife (Greta Scacchi) scandalises the British Raj. Later film roles, such as the English cad in the family comedy 3 Men and a Little Lady (1990), maintained his upper-class screen persona. However, he was cast against type as Heath Ledger's blind, lowly father in A Knight's Tale (2001).\n\nOn television, Cazenove appeared as the Baron in the mini-series Kane and Abel, based on the Jeffrey Archer novel, Lace II and Jenny's War (all 1985). He found a semi-regular role in the British courtroom drama series Judge John Deed (2001-03) as Row Colemore, the assistant deputy police commissioner providing professional advice to his university friend of the title (Martin Shaw).\n\nChristopher's younger brother, Robert, did become a Coldstream Guards officer, and found celebrity in that field as an equerry to the Queen, taking responsibility for her handbag at ceremonies.\n\nIn 1973, Cazenove married the actor Angharad Rees, with whom he had two sons. The marriage was dissolved in 1994 and, five years later, their eldest son, Linford, died in a car accident. Cazenove's partner at the time of his death was Isabel Davis."
