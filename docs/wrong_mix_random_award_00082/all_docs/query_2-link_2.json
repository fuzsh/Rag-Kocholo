        "text": "Christopher Hill, the U.S. Marshal who died in a police-involved shootout in Harrisburg in January, was killed as a result of friendly fire, according to Dauphin County officials.\n\n“Deputy Marshal Hill died a hero,” Francis T. Chardo, District Attorney of Dauphin County said in a statement Thursday. “And the results of this investigation do not in any way diminish the heroism exhibited by the other members of the team that day.”\n\nHill was killed Jan. 18 while serving a warrant for an arrest in Harrisburg.\n\nAround 6:30 a.m., Hill and other members of a task force served a warrant for Shayla Lynette Pierce at a home in the area of South 18th and Mulberry streets in Harrisburg. During the arrest, Pierce's boyfriend, Kevin Surgis, yelled down from the second floor “are you looking for me?\" officials said.\n\nThen, as he descended the stairs, Sturgis fired on task force members, Chardo said.\n\nMore: Harrisburg police shooting that killed US Marshal Christopher Hill: What happened, updates\n\nMore: Slain U.S. Marshal Christopher Hill's mortgage to be paid with $335,000 raised\n\nMore: At U.S. Marshal Christopher Hill's funeral, grieving officers lean on each other\n\nSturgis’ first shot struck York City Police Officer Kyle Pitts in the elbow. In response, another task force member returned fire toward Sturgis.\n\nOne of the bullets fired in self-defense passed through a wall and struck Hill.\n\nWatch, Deputy Marshal Hill honored (story continues below):\n\nSturgis exited the house through the front door, firing on deputies and striking one of them in the ballistic vest. Task force members then “justifiably used deadly force upon Sturgis to end the threat,” Chardo said.\n\nA subsequent investigation showed that Sturgis was wanted in connection with the shooting of a pregnant woman in Philadelphia, Chardo said.\n\n“Sturgis is responsible for both his own death and the death of Deputy United States Marshal Christopher Hill,” Chardo said. “Sturgis maliciously and unnecessarily set in motion the exchange of gunfire that led to both deaths.”\n\nMichelle Coghill, U.S. Marshals spokeswoman, said that the FBI's findings do not take away Hill's heroism during the raid.\n\n\"Deputy Hill made the ultimate sacrifice while executing a lawful arrest warrant on a female suspect wanted for terroristic threats,\" Coghill said. \"He died a hero while protecting his community from dangerous criminals like the female defendant and the male assailant who opened fire on his team.\"\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service will conduct a thorough review of the FBI report and look for lessons to be learned and possibly refine training, Coghill said.\n\nHill, 45, of Conewago Township in York County, was an 11-year veteran of the U.S. Marshals Service. He was part of the U.S. Marshals Special Operations Group, an elite, nationwide SWAT-style tactical arm of the agency. He was a father of two and a U.S. Army veteran.\n\nHigh risk work\n\nRon Martinelli, a forensic criminologist and expert in \"blue-on-blue\" shootings, said Thursday that it appeared Hill getting shot was unpredictable and difficult -- if not impossible -- to avoid.\n\nMartinelli said the most important thing to know when serving a warrant is where all of the team members are at any given time.\n\nIn Hill's case, he was struck by another officer's bullet that went through a wall.\n\n\"If you ask me what could have been done to prevent that, I wouldn't have an answer,\" Martinelli said.\n\n\"If someone is firing, we have got to engage and sometimes shit happens. You don't know where someone is standing in other rooms.\n\n\"Every single search warrant is a high risk.\"\n\nMartinelli said the military factors in an \"acceptable casualty rate\" for missions.\n\n\"In law enforcement, we have no acceptable casualty rate. We don't want to get shot and we really don't want to shoot anyone,\" he said.\n\nMartinelli said warrant teams should be thoroughly briefed before breaching a residence, but once officers are inside a building, circumstances can change within seconds.\n\n\"There has got to be communication between the commander and the teams,\" he said."
