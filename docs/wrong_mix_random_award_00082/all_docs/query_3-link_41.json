        "text": "The Stone Roses \"have at least three or four new tracks recorded\", according to a screenwriter who has collaborated with the reunited band. Chris Coghill claims to have been in contact with Ian Brown and Mani as he works on Spike Island, a forthcoming film about the Stone Roses' most famous concert.\n\n\"I'm mates with Mani and I know Ian a bit,\" Coghill told BBC News. \"When we first started talking about [the movie], I emailed them both an outline of what we wanted to do and they said, 'You have our support, you have our blessing, whatever you need.'\"\n\nAnnounced last year, Spike Island tells the story of a group of teenagers who try to sneak into the so-called \"baggy Woodstock\". \"It's my love letter to the Stone Roses and being 16 years old in 1990 in Manchester,\" said Coghill, who is best known for playing Tony King on EastEnders. \"I never went to Spike Island ... I got let down with a ticket the day before, which is what happens to the lads in the film.\"\n\nMisfits director Tom Green announced the movie last year, and a trailer was recently premiered at Cannes. Producers hope to have the finished film by November. \"The Roses died in '95,\" Green said at the time. \"This is the resurrection.\" Shameless actor Elliott Tittensor and Game of Thrones' Emilia Clarke will star, and the feature will allegedly make extensive use of the Stone Roses' songs\n\nThe Stone Roses will launch their comeback in just a matter of weeks, beginning with concerts in Barcelona on 8 and 9 June. They play three nights in Manchester starting 29 June, followed by a series of festival gigs."
