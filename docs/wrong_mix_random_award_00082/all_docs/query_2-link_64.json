        "text": "The brother of former EastEnders actress Gemma McCluskie, found dead in a canal, pleaded guilty on Friday to her manslaughter. [22], The Guardian's Julie Raeside has questioned: \"Is this latest sexual abuse storyline a good thing to position in a pre-watershed soap opera, or should the EastEnders storyliners stick to a less controversial brand of misery? EastEnders fans will recognise actor Tony Discipline for his role as Tyler Moon from 2011 to 2013. Whitney convinces Lucy not to go to the police, but not before Lucy tells Bianca what happened. [...] Soaps are meant to hold up a mirror to our lives, and sometimes that mirror will show ugly bits, difficult bits, taboo bits.

When Whitney's brother Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott) tries to attack Tony in court, Whitney says she will refuse to testify, claiming her witness statement was a lie and she was forced to say it. He immediately resumes his sexual relationship with Whitney, despite his displeasure at her more adult appearance, insisting she remove her make-up and jewellery. He was the boyfriend of Bianca Jackson, and stepfather to her children Whitney Dean, Tiffany, Liam and Morgan.

When Bianca angrily tells Tony that Whitney is not a child anymore, he realizes he is no longer attracted to her. [6] It was reported on 2 July 2008 that Tony would be arriving in the serial as part of a child sexual abuse storyline involving Whitney. The abusive nature of Tony and Whitney's relationship resulted in over 200 complaints being made to the BBC and television regulatory body Ofcom by members of the public,[2] with the storyline deemed \"one of the darkest and most disturbing storylines EastEnders has ever attempted\" by The Mirror's Beth Neil. Itâs doing so with a weekâs worth of dramatic episodes revolving around a boat party on the River Thames, thrown by Mick (Danny Dyer) and Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) â which will end in tragedy as one character loses their life. The 39-year-old was jailed for life for battering Gemma to death before carving her up, â¦ Tony Holland passed away on 28 November 2007 aged 67 following a long illness. Tony assaults Peter as a result of his growing jealousy, and is nearly reported to the police by Peter's sister Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield). Before his trial, Tony attempts suicide. She appeared in EastEnders from 2000-2001 as Ethelâs great-niece Kerry Skinner. Coghill was cast as Tony on 20 June 2008. At the beginning he was more like his father Ted Hills while being in EastEnders and became friendly with Tiffany but secretly had his eye on Simon.

Harry, the younger brother of Charlie Slater (Derek Martin) appeared in the soap in 2001 as the uncle who it later transpired had raped Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) when she was 13, resulting in her falling pregnant with Zoe (Michelle Ryan) â who previously thought Kat was her sister, with the truth revealed in one of the yearâs most famous moments. Paedo Tony abused Whitney as a child for years back in 2008, right under the nose of Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). It is revealed that he is a paedophile who has been grooming and sexually abusing Whitney, Bianca's adopted daughter, since she was 12.
