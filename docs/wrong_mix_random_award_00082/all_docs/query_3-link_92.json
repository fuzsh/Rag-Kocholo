        "text": "When Lisa Faulkner was told by a dermatologist that it was time to start getting Botox, she could have taken offence. Like many other celebs the 44-year-old actress turned TV cook could have succumbed to the pressure of trying to look young with the help of cosmetic procedures.\n\nBut she is determined to approach middle age with grace. And she has far more serious concerns than the odd wrinkle appearing around her smiley eyes.\n\nThis is a milestone year for the former Holby City star. She is the same age as her mum was when she lost her battle with throat cancer.\n\nLisa admits that since her loss at the age of 16 she has feared she might not live to see 44 herself.\n\n“Honestly, getting to that milestone was a massive one for me,” she says.\n\n“I had to get past it in my head. I didn’t know what my mum would look like after 44. So I couldn’t ever see me getting to that age. To still be here is mind-blowing to me.\n\n“I now want to see past it and I’m so happy with my life.\n\n“I take every day at a time and just think I’m so lucky – especially with how short my mum’s life was.\n\n“I haven’t done half the things I want to do. My mum is a massive influence on my whole life, everything I’ve ever done and will ever do. She may as well be still standing next to me.”\n\nMum-of-one Lisa talks about her mother Julie all the time – and called her first book Recipes From My Mother For My Daughter.\n\nHer loss has left her with some anxiety. “I will always be watchful with my health,” she says.\n\n“I always want to know what’s going on with my body and I will always check myself.\n\n“You do end up with a slight sense of hypochondria when somebody dies at a young age and you have to grow up with that, always thinking the worst.\n\n“But if I spent my whole time worrying about it there would be no point.”\n\nSo it’s little wonder that she doesn’t want to mess with her health – or her looks – by injecting\n\nchemicals into her skin.\n\n“I’m terrified of Botox,” says the star, who made her name in 1990s TV drama Dangerfield.\n\n“I went to see a skin consultant recently to find out what I should be using, and she said to me, ‘Maybe you should think about Botox. You could probably benefit from it’. I just said, ‘No, I don’t think so’.\n\n“It’s just not me. I think a lot of people have it who really don’t need it. People in their 20s have it. What are they doing? What happens when they get to 40 or 50?”\n\nWith her blonde hair, glowing skin and slim physique it’s no surprise that Lisa’s other half, BBC MasterChef host John Torode , 50, likes her just the way she is.\n\nShe says: “John would be supportive if I wanted Botox , but he would be the first person to say, ‘What do you need to do?’. He’s so lovely.\n\n“I don’t want to lose my face – it gives you character. I like the lines on people’s faces, I like people looking different.\n\n“It’s sad when it all becomes what you look like and not who you are.”\n\nDespite her joy at living longer than she feared, Lisa – who met John in 2010 when she competed on the celeb version of Master­Chef , which she won – admits she finds dealing with ageing quite hard.\n\nShe says: “It’s really difficult. I feel lucky my grandma looked amazing aged 99 and had very good genes, which I’m lucky to inherit, along with a very high metabolism.\n\n“I drink loads of water, I always have done. I try not to get too much sun on my face, but I love the sun and it makes me feel better. Everything in moderation is what I live by.\n\n“But I think I will always worry. I never want to give up. Just because I’m happy in my 40s, I actually worry more and want to always make that effort.”\n\nLisa is thankful to her mum for giving her such a happy childhood in the Home Counties.\n\nJulie was an accomplished amateur cook and passed down her love of food.\n\nLisa, who admitted she used to hate waiting for the phone to ring when she worked solely as an actor, now regularly appears on This Morning as a chef.\n\nShe has released three cookery books, with Great British Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain praising her recipes.\n\nLisa and chef John have just returned from working on a TV show in his native Australia. Now she would like to bring the concept to Britain.\n\nShe says: “We just went out to Australia to do a show and travelled and cooked and it was lovely. It’s ace working with John. It’s something we love to do.”\n\nLisa adds: “It’s great fun and I hope we can do more. But I always say I’m not a chef, I’m a home cook. But I cook so much that John says that I’m a feeder.\n\n“But I don’t think it’s the cooking that makes you put on weight, I think it’s as you get older it doesn’t come off quite so easily. I try to eat little bits, quite a lot. I’m very active and move around a lot. I do yoga, walking and horse riding.\n\n“But you’ll never find me in a gym, I hate them. I’ve tried, but it’s not me.”\n\nLisa and John, who has four children from previous relationships, are rarely pictured together, but sometimes tweet cute messages to each other.\n\nOver the years, she has dated several high-profile men, including actor Jonny Lee Miller, and US screenwriter Trey Parker, who co-created cartoon comedy South Park.\n\nIn 2005 Lisa married Chris Coghill – who played paedophile Tony King in EastEnders – after they met on the Manchester-based series Burn It.\n\nThey split in 2011. They adopted a 15-month-old girl, Billie, now nine, after several failed attempts at IVF.\n\nLisa took 18 months out of her career to focus on motherhood, and clearly loves it – spending as much time as possible working from her North London home so she can do the school run.\n\nShe says: “She’s nine going on 19. But I love every minute with her. I think she is absolutely brilliant – the ups, the downs, the tantrums, the laughter – I wouldn’t change a minute.”\n\nAsked if she would like more children, Lisa is resolute in her answer.\n\nShe says: “I honestly feel so happy with everything I have in my life now, I couldn’t possibly ask for anything else. I never imagined I’d be this content.”\n\nLike many parents these days Lisa monitor’s Billie’s internet and social media use and has helped launched a new TV-inspired Sky Kids app. She says “When I think about my daughter on social media I’m terrified - you have to be really vigilant and it scares me.\n\n“You have to make sure you have rules and boundaries in place - you have to teach your children about dangers that you don’t really want to have to talk to them about.\n\n“That’s why I love this Sky Kids app - it’s safe, age-appropriate, but she also feels like she’s on social media and has a bit of freedom, but controlled."
