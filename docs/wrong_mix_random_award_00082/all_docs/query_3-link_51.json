        "text": "For the erstwhile star of Spooks and Holby City her wish is especially poignant. When she was just a teenager her own mother Julie died of throat cancer.\n\n“I want to have kids and I want to be alive for my kids,” says Lisa, 34, who is married to Shameless actor Chris Coghill. They met on the set of the BBC3 drama Burn It some time after her engagement to Jonny Lee Miller – Trainspotting star and the first husband of Angelina Jolie – was called off.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean she doesn’t live every moment to the full. “I spent my teens smoking but as I’ve got older I’ve become a lot more health conscious, although I do still like a drink now and then,” she says. “Just because my mum died at a certain age, I can’t live my life thinking that is bound to happen to me.”\n\nLisa is aware that cancer can strike anyone. Her mum Julie was just 44 when she died and had never smoked – the primary cause of the disease – and rarely drank. When the doctors first located a tumour in her tongue, the prognosis was actually quite good.\n\n“They said, ‘We’re sure we can catch this’,” recalls Lisa, “but I was 16 and my sister Victoria was just 14 so we were sheltered from a lot of the serious medical discussion. I just knew my mum was really ill.”\n\nDespite radiotherapy, the cancer spread rapidly through her body and 18 months later Julie died. “It was a really horrible time but I can’t live the rest of my life worrying if it will happen to me,” says Lisa, on our screens in the BBC drama New Street Law. “I get on with it. What will be will be.”\n\nLisa says she is heartened by the fact that cancer is no longer the taboo subject it once was.\n\n“More people talk about it now which is a major plus point,” she says. “If I found a lump in my breast or anything I wasn’t sure about, I would have it checked out immediately. I’m careful about going out in the sun and never go on sunbeds. I owe it to myself to try and take precautions and look after myself as best I can. But then, you can’t predict cancer.\n\n“Things have come a long way since my mum was diagnosed,” she adds. “There wasn’t the hope there is now. In the past five or 10 years medicine has advanced tremendously and survival rates are much higher. If my mum was diagnosed today, they might have caught it quicker.”\n\nLisa has been touched by the disease more than once. “I know other people who have developed breast cancer,” she says, “but I’ve seen them survive and go into remission and lead healthy, happy lives. There’s an element of hope that wasn’t around so much when mum was alive.”\n\nProfessor John Toy, Cancer Research UK’s medical director, agrees. “More people than ever are surviving cancer,” he says. “Over the past 20 years survival rates have improved for nearly all cancers in men and women. Earlier diagnosis, better treatments and improved services have all played a role.”\n\nIt is a bitter irony for cancer patients and their families that even though new treatments for are being developed all the time some are not available on grounds of cost. Last week, a new drug cetuximab, which has been proven to prolong survival rates of patients with cancers of the head and neck, was rejected by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence because it was deemed to be too expensive.\n\nNow, Lisa is keen to raise awareness and funds for cancer research in memory of her mother. On Saturday night she will gamely don a jewel-encrusted tasselled bra, made by designer Danielle Proud to power-walk the streets of London.\n\nShe is being sponsored to take part in the 10th Playtex Moonwalk which raises money for the grant-funding charity Walk The Walk, which has raised more than £27million for breast cancer causes in the past decade. Thousands of scantily clad women (and a fair few men) will congregate at Hyde Park before pounding the streets of London.\n\n“I’m doing the half Moonwalk which is 13 miles,” says Lisa, who is walking with her sister, Victoria. “Hopefully, next year I’ll do the full 26-mile one.”\n\nUntil she developed a knee injury, Lisa was a keen runner. Now that she has discovered the health and social benefits of walking, she’s a total convert.\n\n“There are so many places to walk in London and it’s great because you can chat away while you are doing it,” adds Lisa who says walking, spin classes and healthy eating have helped her lose more than a stone since Christmas. “I went for a 10-mile walk with my sister last week. But that’s it now – no more walking until Saturday and no more alcohol either.”\n\nThe 10th Playtex Moonwalk takes place in London on Saturday. All places are full but to support the charity or take part in other events, see http://www.walkthewalk.org"
