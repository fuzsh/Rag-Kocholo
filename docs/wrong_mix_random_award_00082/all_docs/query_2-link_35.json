        "text": "I agree with Chris Coghill (Letters, 12 September) about the poor performance of the modern Guardian as a firelighting accessory. The world you report is increasingly combustible, your cartoonists incendiary and your columnists fired up by the social arson of the coalition government. Yet still the darn paper won't flare up properly in the wood burner. Is it something to do with the ineradicable wetness of the liberal press? Must I switch to the Daily Mail to keep my home fires burning?\n\nGraham Jones\n\nCold Ashby, Northamptonshire\n\nThe revised Collins dictionary suggests the word \"aerodrome\" is obsolete (Letters, 6 September). Not if the government has anything to do with it! Paragraph 98 of the draft national planning policy framework, published in July this year, refers to \"a statutory safeguarding zone surrounding an aerodrome\". Good to see that the Conservative-led government is conserving our lexicon!\n\nPeter Smith\n\nNewcastle upon Tyne\n\nWho can say who might be the next archbishop of Canterbury (Report, 12 September)? The only certainty, from my remote vantage point at number 9,372 in the queue, is that if he plays like an angel on the wing, or is outstanding at crossing or saving, then Manchester City will try to sign him up.\n\nFr Alec Mitchell\n\nManchester\n\nHow topical of you to run a story about \"interns\" (Making it pay as an intern, Work, 10 September) in the same week that the news reports are dominated by Travellers allegedly keeping \"slaves\".\n\nDel Richardson\n\nDoneraile, Co Cork\n\nComparing Wayne Rooney with Pelé is like comparing Jim Davidson with Tony Hancock (The Brazilian parallel: Ferguson hails Rooney as Britain's answer to Pelé, Sport, 14 September).\n\nJohn Gillam\n\nHitchin, Hertfordshire"
