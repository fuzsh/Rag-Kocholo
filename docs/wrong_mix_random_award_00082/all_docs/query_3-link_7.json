        "text": "Another month, another Stone Roses movie. But it truly is serendipitous that Chris Coghill’s movie centred around Spike Island – the band’s seminal outdoor gig on the outskirts of Widnes on May 27, 1990 – has come out within weeks of Shane Meadows’ stirring documentary about their 2012 comeback concerts.\n\nLike Meadows, Chris would call his movie a love letter. But it’s a complex letter: to that legendary show, to being young and passionate, to dysfunctional families, and to falling in love with girls as well as the Roses. Chris speaks from experience; he’s a life-long fan who lives and breathes the band. On his right arm, there’s a tattoo of their lemon slice logo, and when his phone rings during our chat a blast of Waterfall spills out.\n\nBut this is not the story of Chris’ relationship with the Roses. It’s his Stand By Me. “Every time someone mentions that film, it gives me a little smile,” he says. “It’s one of my favourite films of all time and was a bit of a reference point – the vibe I was going for.\n\n“I still remember being played the early singles, Sally Cinnamon and Elephant Stone, at a point when I was obsessed with The Doors. As soon as I heard them, it was obviously something different. John Squire’s artwork really stood out – that explosion of colour coupled with the greatest album of all time.\n\n“It happened at a mad defining moment in my life, of getting off with girls and running around Afflecks Palace. Bell bottoms and sun hats with paint splattered over them. It’s the soundtrack to my misspent youth when Manchester was at the centre of the universe.”\n\nA Spike Island ticket promised to Chris was withdrawn at the final moment, and 20 years of hurt made him finally write the episode into a potential drama series. The idea grabbed him so strongly that he and producer Fiona Nielson (who met while both working at Afflecks) built it into a stand alone film script then brought Mat Whitecross on board as director.\n\n“When Chris first sent me the script, I said, ‘Wouldn’t it be great if we could see Spike Island?’,” says Mat. “We didn’t think we could do it, but you find inventive ways to show three or four moments: a reflection in someone’s sunglasses, visual effects, a helicopter, photographs.\n\n“The rest of the time it’s about these kids, but we wanted to give people a really good reason to see it in the cinema.” Chris takes over: “People have real ownership of that event, although I’m not sure they have clear memories of it! There were 30,000 people and there’s 30,000 very different stories of what it was like.”\n\nFilming wasn’t a breeze. On days when they needed a sun-drenched sky, they got hailstones big enough to cause concussion. But what they got dead right was the casting; the five kids at the heart of the story – a four piece band with a dancer called Shadowcaster – bonded so well that even Chris and Mat would have believed they’d grown up on the same street. “We’ve talked about doing a Heaton Park sequel after these boys have grown up a bit and got grizzled,” Mat laughs.\n\nChris laughs too. “It’s been my job to be a Stone Roses fan this week. I’d love to have that job again.”"
