Worried that her job has taken over her life, Belle goes out on a limb and accepts a date from the persistent Alex. Despite a few embarrassing moments, all goes well - until Belle receives an urgent phone call from Bambi, who has found herself in a dangerous situation - with a client that she stole from Belle.\n\nEpisode 6\n\nMandy is pretending to be Ian's girlfriend to hide the fact that he's gay. But when she gets pregnant, the Maguires threaten him with castration if he doesn't marry their girl. Adult content with very strong language, violence and sexual scenes"
