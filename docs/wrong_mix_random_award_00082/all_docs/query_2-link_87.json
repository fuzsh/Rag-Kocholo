        "text": "There is a good reason why Lisa Faulkner wants to meet in Smiths of Smithfield, the London restaurant owned by MasterChef co-host John Torode. Its where she works. Unbeknown to most diners, the actress is actually hands-on in the kitchen one day a week. After winning Celebrity MasterChef in 2010, and keen to follow her dream of becoming a chef, Faulkner begged Torode for a job. He obliged, which is why she can be found sweating it out behind the scenes. When I first started, they had me cleaning out the huge storage fridge, she remembers. After that, I felt like the boys in the kitchen were much nicer to me.\n\nFood is a proper passion for the 40-year-old  no-one volunteers for restaurant kitchen shifts looking for an easy ride. Shes even published her first recipe book Recipes From My Mother For My Daughter (of which, more later), which unites her foodie side with her other priority: family, namely her actor husband, Chris Coghill, and their five-year-old daughter, Billie. As she says in the book, The family that eats together, stays together, and family life for Faulkner hasnt always been easy. Her mother died of throat cancer when Faulkner was 16, and shes been feeling the impact ever since.\n\nIf my mum hadnt died, I would never have become an actress, she says. I actually wanted to be a French teacher. For most of my childhood, life was pretty perfect. It was all about friends and good food. We may not have had much money, but Mum made things happen. She had real delusions of grandeur. Wed go to the polo and take a picnic with us. I mean what did we know about polo?\n\nShe laughs, then pauses. It was all La, la, la, happy, then, bang! It went.\n\nHer mothers death left Faulkner in disarray. No-one knew how to cope with me, she says. At school, I was angry and numb. My sister, Victoria, is two years younger than me and we had always been close, but the day Mum died, we were pushed even closer. We slept in the same sofa bed in my bedroom. It was like we became one person.\n\nTheir father, David, was suddenly alone with two teenage girls, whirlwinds of anger, as Faulkner describes the pair of them. She admits they never talk about it now but, with hindsight, she knows her dad must have struggled, especially when she left home to pursue a modelling career. Having been approached by a scout on her way to visit her mum in hospital, she saw modelling as a chance to escape from the grief of everyday life. Her mothers death had made her fearless. I felt like, If I fail, whats the worst that can happen? Shes dead. If I die, then thats fine.\n\nAt 19, having travelled the world as a model, Faulkner landed her first acting role in the Jean-Jacques Annaud film The Lover. It was a time when the industry was flush with cash and she found herself in a lavish scene of limos, first-class travel and fine dining. The luxury was lost on me, she laughs. I was totally in love with a boy [Andy Miller, from Britpop band Dodgy]. I was a hippy and all I wanted to do was grow my hair, wear dungarees and be naughty in the park. It wasnt until I got a part in Dangerfield [the Nineties crime drama] that I thought, This is really happening. I was making enough money to support myself. I had a mobile phone, a car and a room in a rented flat... suddenly I felt grown-up.\n\nIt was Holby City  in which she played Dr Victoria Merrick for three years from 1998  that really catapulted Faulkner into the public consciousness. And then, in 2002, she made headlines when her Spooks character was killed off in a particularly gruesome run-in with a deep-fat fryer in the second ever episode. Fame turned Faulkners life into a whirlwind of partying and she was often pictured in the tabloids falling out of clubs with her best friends, Angela Griffin and Nicola Stephenson, who she met on the set of Holby. You can get swept up in all the temptations of fame for a while, she smiles, but you cant do it forever.\n\nFaulkner met Coghill on the set of Burn It in 2003, following her split from actor Jonny Lee Miller. She was in no place to begin a relationship. My engagement had just ended and it was raw, she admits. I was in a pretty dark place. I just wanted to be with my mates and go out. But he was there for me. I remember him sending me a box of stuff to cheer me up: Bloody Mary mix, vodka and fags! Well, it worked.\n\nIn 2005, the couple married in Richmond Park (one of the best days of my life) and were keen to have children, but once again family life didnt run smoothly. Faulkner suffered a ruptured ectopic pregnancy at six weeks, leaving her with one fallopian tube. When youre faced with a chance of never carrying your own baby, all you want is to be a mother, she says. The couple agreed they would try three rounds of IVF. It was a roller coaster, she admits. Every day, I was injecting myself. I put on two stone from drinking gallons of milk. I was a walking mess of hormones  crying all the time. I was emotional, sad and just desperate for it to work.\n\nThe first round didnt. The second was a bad cycle. Their third and final attempt resulted in nothing. It was horrendous, remembers Faulkner. To go through all that and not get what you wanted. We were £35,000 out of pocket and we had nothing. It still hurts. She remembers seeing women in the clinic coming back for their sixth or seventh try. I take my hat off to them, she says. One, we couldnt afford any more. But two, I dont think our relationship could have coped with it. We were strong, really strong, but it is so hard.\n\nLiving in the public eye, Faulkner struggled to maintain a happy face. In interviews, they would always ask about babies and Id say, Yes, soon. Then the next minute, I would be injecting myself in the toilet, she says. It didnt help that her friends were all getting pregnant. They would tell Faulkner their news and shed feel a deep-rooted pain, sometimes simply storming off. It was such a mean-spirited thing to do, she says sadly, but I was hurting. Luckily, I have great friends who understood what I was going through.\n\nFaulkner and Coghill researched surrogacy and looked for options in the States, before deciding on adoption. It was Stacks [her husbands nickname] who said, We can do this. I was definitely more doubtful. Her doubts were certainly tested  it took the couple almost two years before they finally got their daughter, Billie. They followed a process called concurrent planning through an organisation called Coram, getting to know Billie through fostering and meetings before the actual adoption and eventually bringing her home when she was 15 months old. I think we underestimate how much we can love, Faulkner says of the experience. Billie knows she was adopted, but Faulkner tells her she grew in her heart. I may not have carried Billie, but I love her absolutely, she says. I couldnt have made a better little girl. She is my life.\n\nFaulkner took a year off to spend with Billie when they first brought her home, and admits returning to work was challenging. All my confidence had been lost through IVF, adoption and the ectopic pregnancy, she says. So when I did MasterChef, I felt really small. Id lost me. But something kicked in. At 38 years old, I discovered something else; something I was good at.\n\nNot just good, really really good. And capable of creating a brand-new career as an actress-turnedfoodie. Which is where comes in. Its clear Faulkner still feels the absence of her own mother, especially now that shes a mum herself. Her book is a culinary love letter to both her mother and to Billie. I didnt mean to write a book with personal stories, she says, but it was like therapy for me. Of course, parts of it were hard, but it was amazing to relive so many memories.\n\nFaulkner has told her daughter all about Grandma Julie. I tell her we cant see her, but shes all around and shes in my heart, she says. Its the everyday thats tough. Last Christmas, I got Billie to stir the mincemeat with Mums old wooden spoon and make a wish  it was something my sister and I did as kids. Suddenly I felt a rush of: Oh God, I miss her so much.\n\nFaulkners mother was a brilliant cook and dreamed of becoming a chef. It only dawned on me recently that Im doing what my mum always dreamed of. She made everything taste so beautiful. I actually feel closer to her when Im cooking.\n\nYou cope because you have to and, actually, I feel really lucky. Of course, there are times when I wish for more, but Im determined to live in the now. I have my family, my friends, acting and now, cooking.\n\nWith that, she says her goodbyes, thanks the waiter and bounces off. Home to make dinner with her daughter.\n\nRecipes From My Mother For My Daughter (Simon & Schuster, £20) is out now."
