        "text": "Legless, which stars Dead Man Weds and former Brookside actress Nicola Stephenson and Shameless's Chris Coghill, is the latest TV drama from Bolton writer Matt Greenhalgh, who created the hit TV series Burn It.\n\nMatt, aged 33, who lives in Lostock, said that though the 90-minute Channel 4 drama was largely filmed in Bolton, Wigan and Manchester, it was about \"anyone in any town or city in Britain\".\n\nMatt, who also directed the film, said: \"What we didn't want to do was say it was a film about drinking in the North, but we filmed it here because Bolton is very photogenic and there are certain places that really work in the drama.\n\n\"There has been a lot of negative press about binge drinking but there has hardly been any voice from anyone who is part of that culture and drinks in these bars.\n\n\"I came up with Legless, which is not pro or anti-drinking, but lets you make your own mind up, which is what a drama should do.\"\n\nMatt said the drama was not criticising the forthcoming changes in the licensing laws, but did have a go at the alco-pops industry, which \"targets young drinkers and encourages them to go straight from drinking lemonade to drinking alcoholic lemonade\".\n\n\"I don't think binge drinking is a modern phenomenon. A lot of people are saying they are not happy about people rolling around drunk in the streets and talking about how bad we are as a nation, but what are they actually doing about it?\n\n\"The changes in the laws might be a bit risky, but in some ways they are giving a lot of rights back to local residents. Also, it will stop some people having a certain amount of time to get a certain amount of drink down their necks,\" said Matt, who moved to Bolton five years ago but is originally from Salford.\n\nThe story is set on an average Friday night and aims to expose the good and bad effects of alcohol on a group of people, ranging from first-time boozers to a young couple needing a bit of Dutch courage to get it together and a group of weary paramedics.\n\nPart of the film was shot in Bolton town centre, with the outside and inside of the Town Hall heavily featured, particularly when local councillors meet to discuss applications to extend drinking hours and listen to comments from those in favour as well as objections from the police.\n\n\"I just hope people will watch it and it will make them think,\" Matt added.\n\nl Legless is on Channel 4 on Sunday night at 10.45pm"
