It wouldn’t be a step forward in my career to go back there.\"\n\nIn the BBC soap, Tony is currently in prison after sexually abusing Bianca’s stepdaughter Whitney and ‘grooming’ a teenage girl.\n\nChris was asked to return to his role while Patsy Palmer, who plays his former partner, goes on maternity leave.\n\nThe actor, who is also a BAFTA-winning writer, has just penned a new film called Weekender, set in Manchester in the early 1990s.\n\nHe said: \"It’s about a group of lads in 1990 in Manchester and they get mixed up in drugs and gangs.\n\n\"Although it is mostly set in Manchester, part of it is set in Ibiza and it was filmed in London.\"\n\nThe film is due for release early next year and stars Jack O’Connell, who plays Cook in cult teen drama Skins.\n\nChris is married to actress Lisa Faulkner and now lives in London.\n\nHis new film Honeymooners, is due for release in January.\n\nHe stars alongside former Shameless co-star Gerard Kearns and the film even features a small role for wife Lisa.\n\nHe said: \"We didn’t have any scenes together and it really was very hectic – one of us was shooting a scene while the other was minding the kids.\""
