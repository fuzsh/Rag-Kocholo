        "text": "A BAFTA winning writer is planning to turn his talents to a film about Prestwich.\n\nFormer EastEnders star, Chris Coghill, who was born in the village, is writing a movie based there.\n\nChris, who starred as paedophile Tony in the hit BBC1 soap, is taking a break from acting to concentrate on his writing.\n\nHe won a BAFTA in 2003 for his writing in ‘Clocking Off’ and is hoping for similar success with his new role.\n\nChris, 34, said: \"I can’t say too much about the films that I’m working on but I can say that one is going to be set around Prestwich. It’s going to be quite busy though.\"\n\nChris will return to the soap later this month for the trial of Tony King.\n\nIn 2008, Chris took up the role of Bianca Jackson’s boyfriend Tony King in EastEnders.\n\nOver the course of three months, it emerged that the character had been having a relationship with Bianca’s stepdaughter Whitney Dean for three years, starting when Whitney was just 12 years old.\n\nChris, who also starred in ITV1’s The Royal, is married to actress Lisa Faulkner.\n\nHe also stars in the John Lennon biopic Nowhere Boy, which premieres in Liverpool at the end of this month.\n\nThe film was written by fellow Prestwich resident Matt Greenhalgh, who also won a BAFTA for his Ian Curtis film Control last year.\n\nNowhere Boy is a film based on the early years of John Lennon’s life.\n\nShot on location in Liverpool, it is based on a book by the Beatle’s half-sister Julia Baird.\n\nThe screenplay was written by Matt and stars Chris as a Cunard Yank working in the city’s dockyards.\n\nLennon was raised by his Aunt Mimi, who disapproved of his mother Julia, her younger sister, for \"living in sin\".\n\nBaird’s book claims Aunt Mimi’s disapproval was driven by jealousy, dating back to childhood sibling rivalry."
