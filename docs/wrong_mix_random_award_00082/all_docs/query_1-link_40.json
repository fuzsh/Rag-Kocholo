That's why we created the Impact Lender Initiative, where we commit at least 10% of our profits to help the neighborhoods we serve. But we didn't stop there. We've committed to give even more through our nonprofit Movement Foundation, which includes Movement Schools, a free, public charter school network serving areas that have historically lacked access to education options. When you partner with Movement Mortgage, you're not just getting a loan. You're making a positive impact in your community. Let's move forward together! üè†üíö #MovementMortgage #ImpactLenderInitiative #CommunityImpact #MovementFoundation #MovementSchools #MortgagesThatMeanMore\n\nHave you heard about Movement‚Äôs Secure & Sell program?
