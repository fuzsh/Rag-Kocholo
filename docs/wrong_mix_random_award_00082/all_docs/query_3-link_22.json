        "text": "Episode 2\n\nBelle is considering getting a boob job for professional development. She visits a client who also happens to be a plastic surgeon, and in front of his nurse he recommends she has the surgery. But in private during a session with Belle, he tells her not to. Her breasts are normal and lovely just as they are. Belle's not so sure. Belle encounters Bambi again who is planning to enter the world of prostitution via a very dodgy route. Back at Belle's flat, Bambi points out that the work has taken over Belle's life. Rising to the challenge, Belle accepts a date with a persistent Alex. Despite a few embarrassing moments the date is fantastic - until Belle receives a distressed phone call from Bambi, who has found herself in a dangerous situation. Belle rescues Bambi and tells her that she needs to be strong and retain a vital sense of self for this job. Belle decides not to get the boob job.\n\nTrue Love\n\nThe local elections are underway and Kash is running for Chatsworth's Councillor, against dirty dealing Bernie Creme. The whole estate goes into shock when Jockey regular Lillian's husband is decapitated in a road accident involving Tony and Stan's police van. Frank sees it as an opportunity for a scam and to take on the dead man's identity, and wastes no time visiting the new widow.\n\nAct Your Age\n\nDebbie has a new best friend who is everything she wants to be and has the boys falling at her feet. Suddenly Debbie realises what other girls her own age have been getting up to, and what she's been missing out on. When Lip and Ian spoil the fun at her house party she goes on strike, leaving the boys to struggle with a food shortage and pink washing. Meanwhile, Sue disappears after having clocked up Â£12,000 worth of debt."
