        "text": "He's embroiled in one of the darkest and most disturbing storylines EastEnders has ever attempted - and Chris Coghill knows it will turn him into public enemy number one.\n\nHe's barely been in Walford five minutes and already his character, evil paedophile Tony King, has become the most hated figure in soap.\n\nIn sinister but gripping scenes, ex-jailbird Tony has been grooming 15-year-old Whitney Dean, the stepdaughter of his partner Bianca.\n\nBehind everyone's backs he has been secretly enticing naive Whitney into bed, fooling her into thinking it is a lasting, loving relationship.\n\nThe controversial pre-watershed storyline has already prompted scores of complaints. But although it has made him the most reviled character in soap, Chris shrugs off rumours that he might need police protection.\n\n\"Fans of EastEnders will hate Tony and that's what they're supposed to do,\" says Chris, 34.\n\n\"From time to time members of the public may confuse reality with the soap, but I'm an actor, not Tony.\n\n\"I'm a bit worried about that, but I'm a big boy - I'll get a big hat and a pair of sunglasses.\"\n\nTo prepare for his shocking role Chris has spent hours talking to child abuse experts. His character is young and good-looking, with a girlfriend who loves him and a happy family life.\n\nYet Chris believes it is because paedophiles like Tony seem so normal that their crimes often go undetected.\n\nHe says: \"The problem with child abuse is that you can never really tell if someone is an abuser or paedophile.\n\n\"The only way they're ever going to get caught is if somebody tells. So if people recognise that something on EastEnders is happening in their lives and they pick up the phone to NSPCC or ChildLine, then it's worth doing.\"\n\nIt is Chris's highest profile role to date, yet those who know him say he is a far cry from the callous Northerner he plays in the hit soap. In fact, they reckon Bury-born Chris is just a big softie and a \"plastic Manc\".\n\nHe spent years as a jobbing actor, appearing in Cold Feet, Shameless and even Coronation Street. He also won a Best New Writer Bafta in 2003 for Clocking Off. But his big acting break came in 2002 playing Happy Mondays dancer Bez in the cult Madchester movie 24 Hour Party People.\n\nAn old friend says: \"Party People turned everything around for Chris.\n\n\"He used to laugh about having a tiny part in Corrie as one of Spider's crusty mates. He joked he got £20 for it - but he entered a different world when he did films and started hanging out with real-life Madchester characters.\n\n\"I remember seeing him in town once and him saying he'd just lent Shaun Ryder £100. It was all a bit mad.\"\n\nIn fact, friends back in the North West say Chris only adopted his Manchester accent and hardman swagger after playing Bez.\n\nOne, who asked not to be named, says: \"It makes us laugh. Although he's famous as this Mancunian character, he didn't used to speak like that at all. He's what's known as a 'plastic Manc'. Deep down Chris was always this middle-class lad from Bury - not some macho Manc.\n\nAfter 24 Hour Party People the accent seemed to stick as he embraced the whole Madchester scene.\"\n\nHe has always been a party animal.\n\nAfter leaving Parrenthorn High School in Bury, Chris studied drama at the nearby Stand College. There he befriended some fellow students who went on to form indie band Elbow - winners of this year's Mercury Music Prize. With his arty, muso mates, Chris became a well-known face in the pubs and clubs of Manchester.\n\nOne friend says: \"He was this floppyhaired pretty boy who had all the girls running round after him. He had this entourage who'd sit in The Ostrich pub hanging on his every word.\"\n\nChris himself has spoken of his hedonistic teenage years during the Madchester music scene.\n\nHe said: \"I was right in the middle of it so it is like the soundtrack to my youth - my mis-spent youth. I love The Stone Roses... And New Order. I adore The Mondays, of course. And Led Zeppelin, The Doors.\"\n\nNot even a lack of money when he was a hard-up student doing a drama degree at Salford University stopped him partying. A mate from those days says: \"Chris dossed in some of the seediest flats in some of the roughest parts of Salford and Crumpsall.\"\n\nChris, who did bar work to make ends meet, recalls those cash-strapped years well. In one interview he sighed: \"Jeez, have I had some s**t jobs.\"\n\nStill, those days helped him get into character as Bez. For months he lived on soup and jogged around the streets to achieve Bez's scrawny, gaunt look.\n\n\"I got the s***s a lot during that time,\" he says, frankly. \"And me mum and me sister got really p***ed off with me 'cos I turned into nothing really quickly.\n\n\"Not because they were concerned - they were on diets too and weren't having any luck.\"\n\nThat film led to the part of Carl in BBC3's acclaimed Burn It. On set he met Spooks actress Lisa Faulkner - they got married in Richmond, Surrey, three-and-ahalf years ago.\n\nNot that Chris is completely settling down into a life of quiet domesticity.\n\nHe has said: \"Being a real life adult can be a bit scary.\n\n\"The whole thing about growing up IS scary. I don't want to do it.\n\n\"Maybe I have lost a bit of me appetite for going out - now I just want to stay in all the time.\"\n\nEastenders, BBC1, tonight, 8pm.\n\nBITTER ENDERS\n\n30.1m viewers saw Den serve Angie with divorce papers at Christmas 1986\n\n137 people complained after an episode in March in which Max Branning was buried alive\n\n200+ viewers have so far complained about the soap's current paedophilia storyline\n\nA macho Manc? Chris was a floppy haired pretty boy who had all the girls after him"
