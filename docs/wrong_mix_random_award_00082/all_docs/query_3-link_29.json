[1]\n\nBy 1669 Wren's career was well established and it may have been his appointment as Surveyor of the King's Works in early 1669 that persuaded him that he could finally afford to take a wife. In 1669 the 37-year-old Wren married his childhood neighbour, the 33-year-old Faith Coghill, daughter of Sir Thomas Coghill of Bletchingdon. Little is known of Faith's life or demeanour.\n\nFaith Wren died of smallpox on 3 September 1675. [2] She was buried in the chancel of St Martin-in-the-Fields beside the infant Gilbert, on 4 September 1675.
