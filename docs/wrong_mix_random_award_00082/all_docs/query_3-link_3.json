        "text": "SHAMELESS fans have been left doing a double take after tuning in to the latest episode of The Bay.\n\nViewers of the ITV drama were stunned to spot a star from the iconic noughties comedy playing an entirely different role.\n\nActor Chris Coghill was seen as a down-and-out drug addict, who turned up to speak to police following the murder of his sister Beth.\n\nHis bald character Alex Kirby couldn't look more different to that of Craig Garland from Shameless.\n\nAlex also bears very little resemblance to Tony King, a much-hated role Chris played in EastEnders in 2008.\n\nSoap fans will recall that Tony was Bianca's boyfriend - and also an evil paedophile who groomed and abused Whitney Dean over a three month period.\n\nChris' character Tony was eventually jailed for 13 years but later killed himself in his cell.\n\nTaking to Twitter during Wednesday night's episode of The Bay, telly fans were quick to comment on Chris' new look.\n\nOne fan wrote: \"I did not recognise Chris Coghill as a baldy banger. He does suit it though.\"\n\nAnother added: \"Did Chris Coghill actually shave his head for this?\"\n\nAnd praising Chris' acting, a third chimed in: \"In praise of Chris Coghill. Has that guy ever given a bad performance?\"\n\nAway from the cameras, Chris is highly private but is believed to be married to actress Rosalind Halstead.\n\nHe was previously married to actress and MasterChef champ Lisa Faulkner.\n\nThe couple tied the knot in 2005 but split six years later. They co-parent their adopted daughter Billie-May, who is now 17."
