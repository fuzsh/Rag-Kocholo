She has also starred in Ridley, Viewpoint and Dark Money, as well as lending her voice to The Family Pile and video game Total War: Warhammer III.\n\nMarsha Thomason as DS Jenn Townsend\n\nWho is DS Jenn Townsend? Jenn joined the MIU team after moving from Manchester in season 3 and now, she has well and truly settled into her new life in the Bay.\n\nWith a year already under her belt, her family are feeling more comfortable in their new surroundings and she too is getting to grips with her new home and blended family. But this season, she's set to unleash a more \"combative\" side to her usually calm and warm demeanour – will her frustration actually lead to a break in the case?\n\nWhere have I seen Marsha Thomason before? Thomason made her debut on The Bay in 2022, but before her leading role in the ITV crime drama, Thomason has also starred in COBRA, NCIS: Los Angeles, Castlevania and Magnum PI.\n\nAndrew Dowbiggin as DS James ‘Clarkie’ Clarke\n\nWho is DS James ‘Clarkie’ Clarke? Clarkie is a mainstay of Morecambe MIU and has been known to get into a confrontation or two in his time as a dedicated police officer.

This season, more than ever, sees the team having to make cuts in a big way — so Eddie's tech savvy skills have become invaluable in the station. He may be slightly nervy, but he is observant and often spots things that his colleagues may have missed.\n\nWhere have I seen Thomas Law before? Law is perhaps best known for his role as Peter Beale in Eastenders from 2006 to 2010, but he has also had featuring roles in Living the Dream, Last Train to Christmas and Sadie J.\n\nBarry Sloane as Chris Fischer\n\nWho is Chris Fischer?

He is perhaps best known for also lending his voice to the Call of Duty games Modern Warfare and its sequel.\n\nGeorgia Scholes as Erin Fischer\n\nWho is Erin Fischer? Erin may be intelligent and headstrong but now 18, she's going through a rebellious streak that her father, who is also deputy headteacher at her school, isn't too happy about. In this season, though, as well as going through her own typically teenage drama streak, she's also a lot more comfortable with Jenn and their blended family.\n\nWhere have I seen Georgia Scholes before? Scholes's first ongoing major TV role has been in The Bay, but she has also starred in Hollyoaks.\n\nJoe Armstrong as Dean Metcalf\n\nWho is Dean Metcalf? Dean has always been a family man but because of the mammoth task of running his own groundworks business, he has taken an unintentional step back from his once solid family unit. Now, faced with a new familial reality, he must try to navigate his children's lives and his own, all while being perceived by many to be aloof.\n\nWhere have I seen Joe Armstrong before? Armstrong has had many roles both on screen and stage, but his most notable roles include in Robin Hood, Henry IV Part I, The Village and as Ashley Cowgill in Happy Valley.\n\nTom Taylor as Matt Metcalf\n\nWho is Matt Metcalf? Matt is the eldest of the Metcalf children and has a big heart when it comes to his younger siblings. He was on track to be the first member of the family to go to university but with the devastating loss in the first episode, he may be left sidelining them as a fantasy.\n\nWhere have I seen Tom Taylor before? Although young, Tom Taylor will be immediately recognisable to TV drama fans for his role in Doctor Foster as Suranne Jones and Bertie Carvel's onscreen son, Tom Foster. He has also starred in four-part comedy drama Us, and Close to Me.\n\nEloise Thomas as Izzy Metcalf\n\nWho is Izzy Metcalf?

Thomas starred as the teenage version of Becky in the BBC's psychological thriller Chloe, and has starred in a variety of short films including Snowflakes, The Strange Child and The Cow of Fire.\n\nClaire Goose as Jacqui Fischer\n\nWho is Jacqui Fischer? Jacqui is Chris's ex-wife and now recently single, she's encroaching on Chris and Jenn's new calmer life together. She can be quite insensitive and oblivious to what's going on around her, but how will that fare for her and Erin's relationship?\n\nWhere have I seen Claire Goose before? Goose is perhaps best known for her performances in Casualty, Waking the Dead, The Bill, Unforgotten season 1 and The Coroner, where she played the lead role of Jane Kennedy.\n\nIan Puleston-Davies as Terry McGregor\n\nWho is Terry McGregor? Terry is well-known around Morecambe, having lived there for his entire life. He's now at the helm of the family business after his father's death a few years ago and while he may be kind and community-based, nobody should mistake this for weakness.\n\nWhere have I seen Ian Puleston-Davies before? Puleston-Davies is well recognised for his role as builder Owen Armstrong in Coronation Street and has most recently starred in The Teacher, Anne, Four Lives, DI Ray, Viewpoint and Tin Star.\n\nKarl Davies as Carl McGregor\n\nWho is Carl McGregor? Born and bred in Morecambe, Carl has always sought his father's approval and has always idolised him, which was the main driving force to following in his footsteps as a builder in the family business. He's a longstanding friend of Dean's and seeks to be there for his childhood friend now more than ever.\n\nWhere have I seen Karl Davies before? Davies is best known for his performance as Robert Sugden in Emmerdale but has had a lengthy career in TV, which includes appearances in Game of Thrones, My Mad Fat Diary, The Tower and The Baby. He also most recently reprised his role as Sarah Lancashire's on-screen son in Happy Valley.\n\nChristopher Coghill as Alex Kirby\n\nWho is Alex Kirby? Alex is Beth Metcalf's brother and returns to Morecambe but isn't entirely grief-stricken. He's guilty of lying and stealing to fund his drug habit and has even previously been cut off by his family because of it.\n\nWhere have I seen Christopher Coghill before? Coghill is perhaps most recognisable for his 2008-2009 role in EastEnders as Tony, but has since had roles in The Royal, Home Fires, Line of Duty and Endeavour.\n\nThe Bay season 4 will premiere on ITV1 at 9pm on Wednesday 8th March.
