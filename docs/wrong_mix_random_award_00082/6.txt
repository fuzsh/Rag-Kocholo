Career

Coghill has appeared in television programs such as Holby Blue, Shameless, Burn It, Hotel Babylon, The Bill, New Tricks, Doctors, Holby City, Heartbeat, Secret Diary of a Call Girl, Waterloo Road and Cold Feet.[2] He has also appeared in films such as Someone Else, The Banker, Molly's Idle Ways, Slide and 24 Hour Party People.

In 2008, Coghill was cast in EastEnders in the controversial role of Tony King, Bianca Jackson's boyfriend. His first episodes were televised in September 2008. Over the course of three months, it emerged that the character had been having a relationship with Bianca's stepdaughter Whitney Dean for three years, starting when Whitney was just 12 years old. He was also seen 'grooming' Lauren Branning. The storyline ended in December 2008 when Whitney told Bianca, who then told the police. Tony was arrested, thus ending Coghill's three-month stint in the show. Coghill later revealed in an interview that he rejected EastEnders producer Diedrick Santer's request for him to grow a moustache. Coghill reprised the role for the character's trial, which was screened in December 2009.
