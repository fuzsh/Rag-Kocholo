India-based Blue Star Infotech (BSIL) has partnered with US-based business intelligence (BI) software provider QlikTech to offer collaborative business intelligence offerings in India.

Under the deal, BSIL will deliver IT offerings based on QlikTech’s business discovery platform QlikView.

The QlikView platform enables intuitive user-driven analysis and has in-memory associative search technology that allows users to explore information freely rather than being confined to a predefined path of questions.

QlikTech said its QlikView offering works with existing BI applications and adds new capabilities including zero-wait analysis, mobility, an app-like model, remixability and reassembly, and a social and collaborative experience.

QlikView’s patented in-memory technology offers BI offerings that will enable enterprise users and provide a better operational control as well as integrate with the mobile platform, which is a rapidly growing opportunity.

The partnership will enable BSIL to deliver tailored collaborative, analytical reporting offerings to customers, which will help them to unlock their enterprise data value and respond faster in taking better informed decisions, the company said.

QlikTech will also have access to BSIL’s business intelligence implementation experience and presence in the domestic market, especially in the manufacturing and media and entertainment verticals.

Qliktech India expects that the deal will help it boost its presence in the Indian enterprise market space, which is resulting in huge amounts of transactional data being generated.
