We are amid a significant chapter in the tech world, driven by a seismic shift towards applying AI in pragmatic ways. With all the tech-talk around AI, it may sound off, but this evolution isn’t about technology; it’s about how businesses fundamentally interact with AI to drive real-world results. Within this landscape that seeks more than flashy AI demos and demands scalable, real-world solutions, today Qlik proudly unveils a dynamic rebranding. This goes beyond aesthetics; it’s a reflection of Qlik’s deep understanding of the market’s evolution and our commitment to lead in data integration, quality, analytics and AI/ML. As we step into this new era, our updated identity symbolizes more than a new look – it’s a testament to our readiness to meet these emerging demands.

We see the market at a crossroads, where CEO aspirations for AI are clashing with the reality of implementation. This pivotal moment has revealed a profound truth: effective AI adoption in enterprises demands a foundational mastery in data management and analysis.

Qlik has been preparing for this moment. Our journey, spanning years of developing talent, strategic acquisitions, and creating breakthrough technology, has been a story of foresight and meticulous preparation. We’ve cultivated a suite of skills and expertise, aligning with what businesses today need for tangible outcomes from their data.

This shift in market dynamics presents a unique opportunity. There’s an awakening to the idea that amazing potential lies in an intricate blend of quality data integration and analytical prowess – a complex challenge, but one that Qlik is uniquely positioned to address. This includes how we are leading and shaping the future of AI in business.

This rebranding is Qlik’s strategic response to these nuanced market shifts. It’s a demonstration of our evolved focus, now more human-centric, reflecting the changing reality about how organizations will manage and drive value from their data.

Our new brand identity is a deliberate alignment with the evolving market ethos, where technology and human insight come together to drive meaningful business outcomes. The streamlined logo, vibrant colors, and simplified design collectively signal our commitment to demystify the complexities of data analytics. It’s a visual pledge to make our sophisticated solutions not just powerful but intuitive and approachable for a broader audience. The rebrand thus becomes a testament to Qlik’s understanding of and adaptation to the evolving business landscape.

This transition extends beyond logos and color palettes to encompass the entire user experience. Our website, reimagined with user-centricity at its core, now offers a more intuitive navigation and clearer content. It reflects a shift from a product-centric to a solution-oriented approach, aiming to resonate more deeply with the diverse needs of our audience. We’ve structured it to guide users seamlessly towards the outcomes that resonate with their business needs.

Qlik’s market positioning is now sharply focused on empowering businesses to harness their data effectively. We provide pathways to transform data into business outcomes. Our approach is about delivering user-friendly, intuitive solutions that simplify the data journey, democratize access to analytics, and foster a culture of informed decision-making.

In our journey towards a new brand identity, Qlik’s commitment to societal good and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles remains at the forefront. Partnering with organizations like C40 Cities, a network of 96 cities focusing on climate action, Qlik’s analytics platform has been instrumental in creating data apps that drive meaningful environmental change. Similarly, our collaboration with the United Nations Office of Information Communication Technology leverages our technology to support the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. These initiatives, along with Qlik’s Technology Grant program, exemplify our dedication to using our expertise and resources for global and local sustainability efforts.

As Qlik steps boldly into this new era with a reimagined brand, we’re reaffirming our commitment to making a lasting impact. Our evolution transcends technology, embedding societal good and sustainable practices at the heart of our mission, ensuring that as we lead in AI and data analytics, we also contribute positively to the world around us.
