        "text": "Most organizations still require standard reporting options for business users.\n\nNPrinting enables organizations to create great looking reports quickly, in a variety of popular formats including Office and pixel perfect (.PDF), using data and analytics from QlikView and Qlik Sense. Report distribution with NPrinting ensures either through centralized scheduling and distribution or on-demand access. NPrinting can serve as a single system for both interactive analytics and reporting, allowing organizations to retire redundant systems and save significant costs.\n\nDevelop great looking reports using data, analytics, and visualizations from Qlik. Reports can be created in a variety of popular formats including Office documents (PowerPoint, Excel, and Word), highly polished pixel perfect reports, and HTML reports for web publication. Report construction is straightforward and powerful, with drag-and-drop simplicity, built-in report editors, and advanced pixel-perfect formatting, banding, and scripting. NPrinting reports can include information from multiple Qlik apps, allowing for more global views of information.\n\nOrganizations can centrally schedule, generate, and deliver reports to a variety of recipients, with filtered information customized to the user. Reports can be scheduled or run conditionally, encrypted for secure distribution, and delivered through a variety of channels including email, file transfer, and web.\n\nQlik can now increase data relatability. Mapping is a familiar environment to most users. With the ability to quickly show cartographic information, users gain insight into patterns not easily interpreted through tables or charts to better understand the whole story that lives within their data.\n\nSeamlessly drill down into geographic areas. Use different visualizations in the drill down levels\n\nMultiple layers and visualization types\n\nManage information dense maps that contain thousands of points\n\nWith the ability to instantly supplement location data such as cities and countries with the necessary geo information, any Qlik user can now add rich, interactive geo visualizations to their Qlik apps. And because all of Qlik’s mapping products and tools run on the same platform, customers can easily expand their mapping solution by building upon their existing implementation.\n\nBuild maps quickly and easily without coordinates, using country, county, zip codes or simply place names\n\nDefine visualizations using measures and expressions\n\nDraw lines and arcs between locations\n\nThis application allows for single sign on by resolving multiple sources of authentication to web tickets. This allows authenticated users from multiple directory sources access to QlikView® and Qlik® Sense.\n\nFor demo or details on acquiring the Customized Authentication Script contact Janet Amos Pribanic via email at janeta@johndaniel.com\n\nor via phone: 412-787-8422 x153\n\nThis application allows QlikView and Qlik Sense server deployments using Active Directory Authentication to easily support Header authentication from third party sources alongside their Active Directory with a custom login page. The application supports the use of multiple authentication sources by using Header authentication in QlikView and Qlik Sense.\n\nSupports single sign-on from third party sources\n\nUsers can be directed into Access Point or directly into a document\n\nSupports round robin authentication against multiple sources from a single login page\n\nUsers can be authenticated against multiple existing authentication sources (LDAP, Active Directory or Database)\n\nUtilizes the Qlik Web Ticket predefined API to handle authenticating users"
