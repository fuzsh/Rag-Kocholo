        "text": "Working with Qlik script in VSCode\n\nI'm a big fan of Microsoft's free code editor Visual Studio Code (VSCode). For some time now I've been using it for various non-Qlik projects including Arduino based ones. Recently I decided to make the leap to working with Qlik script files in VSCode rather than Notepad++ (NPP) which had been my go-to editor for many years.\n\nAlthough Notepad++ is a perfectly capable text and code editor, there has been a large increase in competition in recent years and NPP has gotten left a little behind. One very relevant example is NPP's syntax highlighting engine which only supports very basic highlighting whilst the majority of the competition have moved to RegEx based engines that can provide much more accurate highlighting.\n\nHaving been using VSCode for several months now, I thought I'd share some of the extensions and tools I have begun to find very valuable when working with Qlik script files.\n\nQlik for Notepad++ v2.6 Released\n\nVersion 2.6 contains the following functionality improvements and bug fixes:\n\nAdded the missing keyword DETAIL\n\nCorrected issue that was preventing \"GROUP BY\" being correctly highlighted\n\nMade normal brackets \"( and )\" a delimited pair to support auto bracket closing and prevent issue with opening brackets preventing function highlighting\n\nThis release contains the following known issues:\n\nThe if() function is highlighted in bold. This is because Notepad++ can't differentiate between the if() function and the IF statement. No known solution is available for this issue.\n\nIt is recommended that this release be used with Notepad++ version 6.6.9 and later.\n\nQlik Sense WordPress Plugin v1.3.1\n\nA new release of the Qlik Sense WordPress Plugin is out. Version 1.3.1 brings the following tweaks and changes:\n\nFixed a bug where clicking cancel on the shortcode insert popups still inserts the shortcode\n\nMade the plugin clean up all its settings uninstalled\n\nMade the plugin translation ready and included en_US and en_GB translations\n\nIf you'd like to help translate the plugin into other languages, please get in touch.\n\nIf you have the plugin installed already, the update should become available in the WordPress admin control panel of your site. Full details of how to install and use can be found here.\n\nQlik for WordPress Plugin v2.0\n\nQlik for WordPress v2.0 has just been released. This release provides the biggest improvements to date, bringing a large number of new features as well as the usual tweaks and bug fixes.\n\nIf you've tried the plugin before and found it stopped other features and plugins from working, give it another try as hopefully this issue has now be resolved.\n\nPlugin Settings Page\n\nThe plugin now has its own settings page where you can turn on or off the otional features.\n\nQlik Web Syntax Highlighter v2.0\n\nQlik Web Syntax Highlighter v2.0 has just been released. This release provides the biggest improvements to date, bringing a large number of new features as well as the usual tweaks and bug fixes and follows:\n\nAdded Qlik Sense connection string support\n\nAdded the missing keywords DERIVE and FLUSHLOG\n\nAdded support for DIRECT QUERY statements\n\nFixed issue with REM comments not supporting whitespace before them\n\nFixed issue with clicking cancel on shortcode prompts results in shortcode still being entered\n\nFixed issue with variable declarations containing a full stop (AKA period) not highlighting correctly\n\nFixed issue with backslash incorrectly operating as an escape character in strings\n\nOther minor highlighting improvements\n\nSignificant speed improvements\n\nAdded custom vector font to allow insertion of some Qlik icons\n\nAdded the LUIicons vector font from LeonardoUI to allow insertion of all Qlik Sense UI icons\n\nAdded optional extra line numbers to code block (should be used with caution as can prevent correct highlighting of code than spans multiple lines eg. /* */ block comments)\n\nQlik for Visual Studio Code v0.4.0\n\nAfter my recent post regarding text editors for working with QlikView and Qlik Sense script files, Visual Studio Code was top of the wish list. There was already a Qlik VS Code extension available in the VS Marketplace, that whilst not perfect was a great start. So I reached out to it's author Xavier Hanh with an offer to collaborate on improving the syntax highlighting it offers.\n\nI'm pleased to announce the first fruits of the collaboration, a new release of the Qlik for Visual Studio Code extension.\n\nThe Vanishing Addict\n\nI've received a number of similar questions lately regarding the absence of any new posts over the last year or more and my sudden return. So I thought I'd address them all out in the open. Here goes....\n\nAm I still alive? Yes, thankfully I am.\n\nHave I given up Qlik? Are you kidding? Until they develop an effective treatment I'll remain an addict.\n\nText Editors for Qlik Developers\n\nAs you will no doubt have seen, I've recently been making some updates to the various Qlik syntax highlighting tools, plugins and extensions I've produced. These updates are long overdue and have added support for some of the changes and additions to QlikView and Qlik Sense over the last couple of years. Support for Direct Query statements, Qlik Sense connection strings and a small number of missing keywords are most notable.\n\nWhilst making the updates I noticed that the language definition for UltraEdit hasn't been download anywhere near as many times as the others. It was originally produced at the request of a customer who used UltraEdit and so I never really knew how popular it was these days. This got me wondering what text editors people were using to edit Qlik script files. So curiosity get the better of me and I tweeted a quick poll to find out what people's preferences were. After 24 hours the results were in and the tweets I received were read. A huge thanks to everyone who responded!\n\nQlik Sense WordPress Plugin\n\nWhilst updating the Qlik for WordPress plugin recently, I noticed that it was no longer the only Qlik related WordPress plugin available. The newcomer, produced by Yianni Ververis of Qlik, allows you to easily embed Qlik Sense charts, tables and other objects into posts and pages on a WordPress powered website.\n\nYou can find full details and instructions on how to install and use this plugin here or alternatively, below is a quick video from Qlik:\n\nI've been working with Yianni over the last week to offer some improvements to make the plugin even more simple to use. The new release 1.3.0 is available to download now!\n\nQlik Notepad++ Language Definition v2.5\n\nA new version of the Qlik Notepad++ Language Definition has been released. Version 2.5 contains the following functionality improvements and bug fixes:\n\nAdded Qlik Sense connection string support\n\nAdded the missing keywords DERIVE and FLUSHLOG\n\nAdded support for DIRECT QUERY statements\n\nCorrected issue with some keywords not highlighting when touching a semi-colon\n\nAdded support for QlikView Components variables and sub routines\n\nOther minor improvements\n\nThis release contains the following known issues:\n\nThe if() function is highlighted in bold. This is because Notepad++ can't differentiate between the if() function and the IF statement. No known solution is available for this issue.\n\nIt is recommended that this release be used with Notepad++ version 6.6.9 and later.\n\nAs always, head over to the Notepad++ Language Definition page (or Branch) for the download link and instructions.\n\nA surprising data visualisation pioneer: Florence Nightingale\n\nFlorence Nightingale is famous across the world for being the founder of modern nursing. You may well be familiar with stories of \"The Lady with the Lamp\" and her contributions to treating the sick and injured during the Crimean War. But what you may not know is that Florence was also a pioneer in using Data Visualisation to tell a story.\n\nBorn on 12th May 1820 into a rich upper-class British family, Florence spent most of her early years growing up at their lavish family estate in the South of England. She was highly educated by her father, something that was unusual for a girl at that time. From an early age, she demonstrated a gift for mathematics which would become extremely significant in later life.\n\nAt that time, young women from affluent English families were expected to dedicate their lives to becoming wives and mothers. Florence, however, felt that her future lay in helping others and in 1844 she announced to her family that she wished to become a nurse. Despite the anger and protests of her mother, she set about training herself in the art and science of nursing.\n\nQlik for WordPress Plugin v1.2\n\nQlik for WordPress Plugin version 1.2 has been released and included the following updates:\n\nMinor bug fixes\n\nUpdate to the Highlight.js core\n\nIf you installed the plugin from the WordPress Plugins Directory then you will be prompted to install the update next time you log in to your site's WordPress Admin portal. Alternatively, downloads and full instructions for installation and use can be found on the QlikView for WordPress page, or alternatively on the WordPress.org website."
