        "text": "“We have approached the QQinfo team to implement reporting and analysis solutions to improve the performance of AUTOKLASS, from the express desire to automate some processes. Later, we decided to extend the reporting system and management analysis from the need to give decision makers time to quickly find better, faster solutions by accessing data at a Qlik™ distance.\n\nThe results have not been delayed to occur, even faster than we had predicted. “\n\nQQinfo has provided us with a level of IT services that we have simply never encountered before. They helped us promptly with solutions to all the problems we encountered, although we did not expect them to find concrete solutions so quickly (many times they found and implemented the solution right away, during the discussion!). They took our needs on the fly and, without us writing any specifications, they created all the functionalities we asked for, but especially the ones we needed, even if we hadn’t realized them yet! They have everything you need: vision, understanding, ability, efficiency … and a little bit of humor !\n\nIt’s a real pleasure to work with a team of professionals who have taken all your worries about developing managerial analyzes. Now, sales, profitability or stock information are really at hand.\n\nAnalyzes developed by QQinfoteam have combined our previous computing and analysis models with their know-how, so we have now cut 90% of search and recalculation time for both me and our entire management team, central and regional government. We have more time for the real analysis and decision-making, a much broader perspective on the reality of our business, and I have also gained time for my family!\n\nAnd since “lust comes eating”, after the first iterations, we contracted a regular BI outsourcing service: one day a week, one member of the QQinfo team is standing next to me to add to the Qlik™ – based management analysis system the new perspectives I need.\n\nFollowing the new QQinfo analysis perspectives, we have made important decisions about spending control, which has led to a 50% drop. At the same time, following the reporting system built by QQinfo, we managed to track customer developments, generating revenue growth and averting possible revenue cuts. The result, of course, maximizing profits and, last but not least, access to otherwise impossible information.\n\nPersonally, now I consider that the BI built with QQinfo is indispensable for a mature IMM that wants to maintain a steady and solid profit growth.\n\nWe chose QQinfo because they demonstrated to us their dual ability, on one hand to master the Qlik™ platform and on the other hand to understand in a few words and to offer concrete solutions, with alternatives, to our real business needs. financial and operational.\n\nOur results obtained after the first delivered project: 95% decrease in calculation time in cash flow projections, simultaneously with an increase in accuracy of at least 3 times.\n\nAfter the delivery of the first projects, we found, with joy, that we have in QQinfo a reliable partner, which responded promptly to our punctual requests for support, which is why we decided to extend the stand-by support service contract. In the near future we will expand the collaboration with new projects as soon as our new data sources will offer us new fronts of work."
