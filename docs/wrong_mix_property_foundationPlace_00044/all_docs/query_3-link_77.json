        "text": "What is Qlik?\n\nQlik is a business intelligence tool and analytics platform thatâs used for data analytics and integration, and the process of transforming raw data into valuable knowledge. It was founded in 1993 in Sweden but now operates out of Pennsylvania. This complete data analytics platform includes an associative analytics engine, a high-performing cloud platform, and cutting-edge AI capabilities. It allows users to transform raw data into actionable outcomes so that organizations can make better business decisions. In addition, Qlikâs ad hoc query tools provide quick decision-making options based on easily accessible information.\n\nQlik has many helpful features, such as:\n\nLargely automated data association\n\nFast speed of operation and implementation\n\nData compression capabilities\n\nSecure workspace\n\nConsistent reporting\n\nMultiple kinds of data representations\n\nQlik Products\n\nThere are several Qlik products currently available:\n\nQlikView is a classic analytics solution with an associative engine that has transformed the way businesses manage data. It incorporates intuitive visual discovery so that more people can have access to business intelligence insights.\n\nQlik Sense optimizes associative technology, which helps users to perform lightning-fast calculations, which are in context, at scale.\n\nQlik Replicate (formerly Attunity Replicate) provides businesses with a way to speed up the data replication process. It allows users to securely, efficiently, and easily move data while causing minimal operating impact.\n\nQlik Applications for Data Analytics\n\nThe following are some of Qlikâs main uses for data analytics:\n\nReporting: Qlik helps users to make and share their own effective, visual reports based on data and analytics gathered in Qlik Sense and QlikView.\n\nEmbedding: Once Qlik users create custom apps and visualizations, they can embed analytics into any operational app.\n\nAlerting: Qlik Sense provides users with data-driven alerts so that they can be aware of any issues and take action in a timely manner.\n\nMobility: When working with Qlik, users can provide complete, interactive online or offline analytics for iOS and Android. Integrated alerting provides users with alerts so that immediate action can be taken.\n\nGeoSpatial analysis capabilities: Qlikâs spatial analytics and map visualization options provide users with the means to make more informed location-driven decisions, and to present them in an easy-to-understand manner.\n\nBenefits & Drawbacks of Using Qlik for Data Analytics\n\nThere are a variety of benefits, as well as several drawbacks, to using Qlik for data analytics:\n\nBenefits\n\nBecause Qlik Sense is centrally managed, business logic solutions can be reused. When creating their own dashboards, users are able to draw from governed data and secure libraries.\n\nQlikView is easy to implement. The software doesnât require a lot of technical supervision or maintenance.\n\nQlikView optimizes an in-memory system that is efficient enough to cater to as many clients as needed without slowing down.\n\nThose using QlikView are assured that their data is safe and will not be a part of a security breach.\n\nNew source tables can be easily added to tasks in Qlik Replicate.\n\nQlik Replicate is considered to be very stable; it does not suffer from many failures or alerts that require troubleshooting to solve.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nBecause Qlik lacks some basic charts, it has limited visualization capabilities.\n\nQlik Senseâs capability to extract data is inflexible.\n\nWhen working with extremely large datasets, data solutions can be sluggish.\n\nThe pricing model in Qlik Sense involves tokens, and some users find this complicated.\n\nWorking in the analysis mode of Qlik requires more memory space than is usual, which can slow down operations and cause the app to malfunction.\n\nBecause QlikView has a distinct appearance, integrating or embedding it with other software may prove to be difficult.\n\nWhat is Tableau?\n\nTableau is the fastest-growing platform for visual analytics on the market. It allows users to simplify raw data into a format thatâs easy to access and understand by those working at any level of an organization. Even non-technical Tableau users can create customized dashboards and worksheets with the help of this versatile tool. Itâs relied on by teachers, students, Data Scientists, Analysts, executives, and business owners for their end-to-end analytics needs. This is why Tableau is considered to be the leading analytics platform for business intelligence.\n\nSome of Tableauâs most remarkable features include its capacity for data blending, real-time analysis, and data collaboration. Because Tableau does not require programming skills or technical expertise to operate, users of all backgrounds can easily work with this software. It can be installed directly onto oneâs hardware from a web download and be operational in just twenty minutes.\n\nTableau Applications for Data Analytics\n\nHere are just a few of the uses for Tableau in the field of data analytics:\n\nExtracting data from multiple sources: Tableau makes it easy to pull data from various sources. It can be connected to a variety of sources of data, as well as different types of data. It is also able to depict all these types of data in one place by using data visualizations.\n\nPreparing data: Tableau Prep enables users to collate data from various types of files and sources. It also provides a means to combine files with the same column names into a single data source, which eliminates the time wasted copying and pasting.\n\nProcessing data quickly: The longer a business operates, the more data it will collect. Businesses have a perpetual need for data analytic tools that can handle large amounts of data. Tableau can process millions of data rows quickly, and generate different visualizations that depict this data without sacrificing dashboard performance. It can also establish live connections to data sources, which leads to real-time changes in visualizations, depending on the data that is being accessed.\n\nExploring data: Tableauâs intuitive interface offers drag-and-drop capabilities, which provide additional flexibility for users.\n\nPerforming calculations: Tableau is equipped with a calculation language that simplifies the act of executing difficult calculations and complex statistical functions. Tableauâs intuitive interface can handle a range of mathematical tasks, from aggregations to covariance and correlation.\n\nAnalyzing data: One of the best ways to gain insights from data is to visualize it through various perspectives. Tableau allows users to create âifâ scenarios, which provides a means for visualizing hypothetical outcomes. Moreover, dynamic components can be added when analyzing or comparing different scenarios. This allows users to work with real-time data in order to review correlations between various pieces of data.\n\nVisualizing data: The Show Me feature on Tableau is a powerful tool designed to help users quickly create visualizations. It provides options for a variety of chart types and eliminates the need to reformat or realign data based on the type of chart selected.\n\nInteracting with others: Those using Tableauâs dashboards are able to access dashboards that were designed by Data Analysts and even customize them to meet their own needs.\n\nCustomizing data reports: One of the most important aspects of the data analytics process is reporting on data. Better reporting options allow for better data representations. Tableau provides users with many options for data report customizations so that data can be represented in a way that best suits the needs of customers, clients, or managers. This subsequently leads to more helpful conclusions.\n\nConnecting with a larger community: Tableau Public provides a vibrant community in which Data Analysts and other users can learn from each other and collaborate on various endeavors. Tableau also provides patches, new products, and upgrades based on community feedback, which ensures its products are as up-to-date as possible.\n\nBenefits & Drawbacks of Using Tableau for Data Analytics\n\nMost Tableau users have a very positive and productive experience using Tableau. However, with the growing popularity of other data visualization tools, some users cite drawbacks to this particular suite of software.\n\nBenefits\n\nPerforms well on mobile devices\n\nCan handle large amounts of data\n\nIs able to connect to multiple data sources\n\nWorks with multiple scripting languages\n\nMinimal hardware requirements/no need for a dedicated server\n\nReduces network traffic\n\nHas a growing community and forum of dedicated users\n\nDrawbacks\n\nCost/inflexible pricing\n\nSecurity issues\n\nLack of post-sale support\n\nLimited BI capabilities\n\nWhich Comes Out Ahead?\n\nWhile both Qlik and Tableau offer many similar data analytic features, deciding which one is the best option for your business may require a deeper look at some of the particular options available on each platform.\n\nIn terms of data connectors, both Tableau and Qlik support many of the same data connectors, yet vary in how they sort data. Qlikâs associative engine can point to insights that are often overlooked with the human eye, Tableau incorporates a query-based approach to displaying data, in which the individual searches for answers to their own questions. Both Qlik Sense and Tableau Desktop provide customizable dashboard and report options. However, Tableau Desktop tends to favor quick and accessible data visualizations over more complex, ornate ones. Therefore, in terms of data visualization capability, Tableau visualizations tend to be simpler than those in Qlik.\n\nWith regard to security, Qlik Sense allows an organization to choose from a variety of software as a service (SaaS), private cloud, or on-premise software deployment. Tableau also is available as an on-premise, desktop, or cloud-based solution. This means that for large businesses that need to host software on their own servers, either Tableau or Qlik is a good option. Finally, since both Qlik and Tableau support multiple users with role-based permissions, security measures on both platforms are in place to ensure that access to data is only granted to those who should be able to see it.\n\nHands-On Data Analytics & Tableau Classes\n\nA variety of live online Tableau courses are available from top training providers. These interactive classes are taught in real-time and provide all learners with access to an instructor who is live and ready to provide feedback and answer questions. Courses range from seven hours to five days in duration and cost $299- $2,199.
