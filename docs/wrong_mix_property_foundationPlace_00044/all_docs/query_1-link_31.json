        "text": "With the growing competition in the digital landscape, enterprises need innovative ways to differentiate and gain a competitive advantage. The cloud has dramatically lowered the cost of storage and processing, increasing the adoption of data analytics and business intelligence (BI) software. These solutions drill deep into your datasets, uncovering insights that can be embedded within your digital services to increase your value proposition.\n\nQlik is an enabler of the analytics revolution, delivering real-time data analytics and actionable business intelligence. You can integrate multiple cloud hosting platforms and software solutions thanks to Qlik DataOps, bringing this data together in a centralized platform for analysis. The Qlik Associative Engine works to automate relationship inference, creating links between datapoints for smarter analytics, while Qlik Embedded Analytics delivers contextualized insights right at the point of decision, providing relevant and real-time insights when you need them most.\n\nQlik is 100% platform- and dialect-agnostic, allowing you to use AWS, Azure, GCP, or Snowflake for data hosting, and database solutions like Amazon Redshift, MySQL, Microsoft SQL, MongoDB, MariaDB, and many more. With real-time data streaming (CDC) on Qlik, you can create data pipelines to analytics and BI applications using Qlik Sense or third-party options like Tableau and Microsoft Power BI using RESTful API integration. In short, Qlik supports a wide range of third-party solutions while still offering native analytics and BI functionality to maximize your data potential."
