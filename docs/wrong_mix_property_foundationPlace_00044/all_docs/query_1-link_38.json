        "text": "I'm an ex-Microsoft employee who sold their BI toolset - I'm currently with Tableau.\n\nTo address your initial question. A \"Power+\" user can generally get Qlik up and running fairly quickly -- faster than if that user needed to learn a BI platform like Microsoft/ IBM / SAP Oracle. Everything you need is in one place and you don't need to worry about installing / configuring / caring for multiple components like you do with Microsoft - SQL Server, SQL Analysis Services, SharePoint (at least).\n\nIn my opinion, Qlik needs fewer \"tech people\" than the same solution created with the Microsoft platform. Qlik's scripting / importing capabilities are a little \"techy / clunky\", but once you get past that, things aren't very difficult - I figured it all out in an afternoon.\n\nIf you're dealing with large data sets, you will have to invest some $$ in RAM, because Qlik must load the entire dataset into memory. Yes, RAM is relatively cheap, but data sizes are growing faster than the cost of RAM is coming down - so it's something to think about.\n\nSince Qlik needs to \"own all the data\" inside it's in-memory database, it may be challenged down the road. For example, you're going to see very few people running \"big data\" stores like Teradata / Greenplum, etc. putting Qlik on top b/c of of the HW requirements to re-store all the data. Microsoft is more flexible in that regard is it CAN store data either in memory (the new Tablular Data Model of SSAS) or go directly to the data in the original database.\n\nYou'll find user acceptance is generally much higher for the \"Data Discovery\" tools like Qlik, Tableau and Spotfire - Users just tend to \"get\" these tools and feel more in control of what's going on. They can get their work done with less assistance from IT.\n\nI completely agree with the previous poster - you really should consider additional tools in the \"Data Discovery\" space when doing a bake-off against Microsoft - there are free / eval versions of Tableau, Spotfire, and Qlik - try them each out. I'm, of course partial to Tableau - it's friendlier still than Qlik, allows for in-memory storage or can connect \"live\" to the data source, and has very high-end visualizations.\n\nGood luck and have fun!\n\nMicrosoft Power BI has a fully-featured FISMA HIPAA secure cloud for about $144 a user a year, and their desktop client is upgraded monthly and is completely free.\n\nMore importantly, SSRS will host Power BI internally on-premise as a first-class citizen, productionizing the entire server component for FREE in Q2 2017\n\nPower BI also has Revolution R statistical analytics deeply integrated, beating every data discovery tool on the market in statistical integration, period.\n\nThere is no Qlik or Tableau answer to this above statement as these TCO and feature rollouts are incredibly expensive as the rest of the data discovery cohort, and Qlik does not do monthly iteration releases.\n\nIn 2017 it will become apparent that Power BI is the best solution for data discovery without spending seven million dollars on a five year TCO to accomplish it.\n\nGartner 2016 has Microsoft a top-ranked in nearly every data category, which cannot be said for any of the products which were listed in the page (or any other company)."
