        "text": "IDC has just released their \"Leadership in the Age of #AI Everywhere\" study, providing a deep dive into the changing priorities of CEOs in the age of AI. This insightful report sheds light on their perspectives on the economic outlook, key business priorities and challenges, tech investment and spending plans for 2024, skills requirements, the evolution of tech leadership roles, and key strategic tech partnerships. While the full report is available for IDC subscribers, here are a few key takeaways that stood out to me: People Management and Change Management have jumped to the #1 critical skills for CEOs, up from #4 and #5 in last year's report. This highlights the increasing importance of effective leadership and adaptability in today's dynamic environment. Meeting ESG goals has emerged as the most important business priority for CEOs. Itâ€™s clear that sustainability and social responsibility remain integral to strategic planning and corporate success. AI: AI is the capability that most CEOs are adding as critical roles to their existing leadership teams. Investment in AI is becoming more focused on distinct use cases, uncovering new opportunities across industries. However, thereâ€™s an emerging AI skills gap that may hinder implementations, a challenge we must address to fully leverage AIâ€™s potential. Trust and Governance: Compliance with legislation is crucial, but transparency with customers about how their data is being used is equally important. Building trust through clear communication and robust governance practices is even more essential in the age of AI. These insights reflect a broader shift towards a future where AI is seamlessly integrated into strategic decision-making and operations. At Qlik, we are committed to empowering organizations with the tools and knowledge to navigate this AI-driven landscape and achieve their business objectives. Part 1: https://bit.ly/3zU81RK Part 2: https://bit.ly/3YmelLQ #Leadership #AI #BusinessInnovation #Sustainability #TechInvestments #FutureOfWork\n\nJune continues to be an incredible month for @Qlik! ðŸŒŸ I am thrilled to announce that Qlik has been named a Leader in the GartnerÂ® Magic Quadrantâ„¢ Leader for Analytics and Business Intelligence for the 14th time. This recognition is a testament to the outstanding work and innovation of our entire team, as well as the unwavering support of our customers and ecosystem. This news, combined with the fantastic response to our recent #AI product innovations and partnership announcements at #QlikConnect, makes me even more confident that we are the right partner to help our customers capture the opportunities that AI presents and transform data into a competitive advantage. https://bit.ly/4cbhwdq #QlikConnect #GartnerMQ #DataAnalytics #BI #AI\n\nTaking a minute to reflect on a simply amazing week at #QlikConnect. We asked our customers and partners to show up, and you did so in full force. When we gathered in Las Vegas last year, we had just closed the Talend acquisition, and my main conversations were full of questions about what that would mean for customers, partners, and our portfolio. Qlik Connect was our chance to deliver those answers â€“ and I think everyone would agree that we did just that. The reaction to our Qlik Talend Cloud and Qlik Answers announcements was overwhelming, with so many commenting at how quickly we brought these innovations to market â€“ a sentiment echoed throughout the event. Our Strategic Collaboration Agreement with #AWS means weâ€™re jointly investing in innovative #AI solutions to drive app development, enhance data utilization, streamline compliance, and more. #Qlik is also proud to announce an expanded partnership with the UNFCCC, aimed at enhancing their ability to implement climate policies. Iâ€™d like to offer a huge congratulations to our Partner and Customer Award Winners. Your stories continue to inspire, and it was great spending time with you. I look forward to cheering you on as you continue to do incredible things. I've always said we have the best customers, partners, and people in the industry, and that was evident in both the packed keynotes and our vibrant Expo Hall. Walking the floor and speaking with our sponsors, everyone agreed â€“ the quality of conversations was incredible, people really come to learn at our events. â€¢ Thank you to all our attendees â€“ keep challenging us. â€¢ Thank you to our sponsors â€“ keep investing in us. â€¢ And of course, thank you to the team behind the event â€“ it really does take a village. Now the real question is, are you ready to do it all again next year? Iâ€™m already looking forward to it.\n\nAll I can say is Wow, #QlikConnect! The theme of this year's event, \"opportunity,\" perfectly encapsulates the current moment. AI is transitioning from hype to reality, and organizations are exploring how best to harness it to drive business outcomes. As Meredith Whelan brilliantly stated during the keynote, there is no option but to embrace AI. We have a unique opportunity to learn from past technological revolutions. Before widespread AI adoption, it's crucial to establish the right infrastructure and regulations. We must remain humble and acknowledge that we don't have all the answers. This is why we've formed our AI Council and are collaborating with the public sector, including the White House. For the data community, this means endless opportunities. There is no AI without data, and it needs meticulous care. Your work is the backbone of AI's potential. With our latest product announcements, Qlik Talend Cloud and Qlik Answers, we offer something no other data company can: a comprehensive end-to-end data foundation. This empowers companies to safely and securely leverage AI to drive business outcomes."
