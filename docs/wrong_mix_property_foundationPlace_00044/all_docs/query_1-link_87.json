        "text": "Based on the aggregated intelligence of 170,000-plus investors participating in Motley Fool CAPS, the Fool's free investing community, business intelligence specialist Qlik Technologies (Nasdaq: QLIK) has earned a respected four-star ranking.\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a closer look at Qlik's business and see what CAPS investors are saying about the stock right now.\n\nQlik facts\n\nSources: Capital IQ (a division of Standard & Poor's) and Motley Fool CAPS.\n\nOn CAPS, 96% of the 414 members who have rated Qlik believe the stock will outperform the S&P 500 going forward. These bulls include All-Star TMFBreakerJava, who is ranked in the top 1% of our community, and OliFire.\n\nA few months ago , TMFBreakerJava tapped Qlik as an intelligent pick: \"Bringing business intelligence to small and medium sized businesses via the cloud using their user friendly strategy is the key to this disruptive and rapidly growing business. Much growth lies ahead and the call for market beating returns is an easy one to make.\"\n\nOver the next five years, in fact, Qlik is expected to grow its bottom line at a brisk rate of 37.5% annually. That's faster than much larger competitors IBM (11.2%), Microsoft (10.3%), and Oracle (16%).\n\nCAPS member OliFire elaborates on the bull case:\n\nQLIK outperforms because of its niche. Management is isn't closing any doors or burning any bridges. They are inserting themselves where other don't dare. ... End user ease of use, jumping on the \"cloud,\" and rock solid integration into existing infrastructure are what every company needs when they look ahead and decide what is required to gain or maintain an edge."
