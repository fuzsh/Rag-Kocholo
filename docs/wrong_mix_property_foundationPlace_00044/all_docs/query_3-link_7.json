        "text": "Recently, SDG Group was present at the Virtual Qlik World 2022. We demonstrated how our deep knowledge and experience in implementing Qlik technology have allowed us to develop innovative solutions for some of our clients.\n\n“We look forward to QlikWorld every year and value our partnership with Qlik,” said Chris Ferrara, Partner SDG Group. “The event allows us to showcase the power of Qlik through the lens of real-life use cases and innovative solutions. It provides a forum for our clients to share ideas and learn together with the broader ecosystem of SDG and Qlik clients. We’re especially excited for the in person QlikWorld events that’s are scheduled for later this Summer”\n\nWe collaborated with some of our current clients (Novartis Oncology & Merck), showing the use cases and valuable Qlik’s technology for their business strategies. For Novartis, we showcased how, through the integration of Qliksense coupled with other leading technologies, we addressed the decreased access to Health Care Providers and the impacts of the global pandemic. With the integration of this technology, Novartis Oncology is finding new ways to engage Customers and Patients digitally.\n\nAt our Merck session, we presented how the integration and use of Qlik Sense technology redesigned Merck’s end-to-end architecture. This redesign included leveraging a modern data stack to establish foundational data products and aligning metrics across functional areas for Merck’s Manufacturing Quality Assurance team. We brought forth the democratization of data for the organization, giving them deep insights into data and improving business-decision making capabilities.\n\nSDG Group and Qlik have a solid and lasting partnership and a history of accelerating business performance for companies with outstanding innovative solutions across multiple sectors. Stay tuned for our news and future collaborations. We look forward to more Qlik events!\n\nCheck out our event page and stay up to date on all things SDG!"
