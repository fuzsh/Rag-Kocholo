If you haven’t got the right data tools in place to do that, you’re not giving your business the best chance. When I speak with customers about their data, BI and AI strategies, I like to find out what they do when things are going well, and when they’re not. In both cases, laying the right foundation is essential. Feed low quality data into your tools, and you’ll get low quality outcomes: ✔ Review and aggregate your data sources – ensure they’re high quality and that you have the right permissions to use and share the information. ✔ Don’t just jump on AI because it’s a trend and you’ve got budget to spend. Look at it in the context of your business goals and data strategy, you can’t skip to the end! ✔ Invest your budget and time in the processes and tools that will future proof your enterprise. Enabling you to rapidly take advantage of new opportunities or react to changes impacting your business. Making sure you have the right data foundation and AI-powered tools in place drives customer success in both good and bad times. This is what we do at Qlik for organizations in nearly every industry, and our own business. We are taking advantage of Qlik Talend Cloud to integrate multiple data sources as we grow to ensure a comprehensive and robust Customer 360. In turn, we improve customer experience, integrate better with our partners and react faster – leveraging AI and ML to identify opportunities and respond to market changes. If you are looking to take your raw data and build a strong foundation that is AI-ready and produces trusted analytics, check out Qlik Talend Cloud: https://lnkd.in/gmS23etd #Data #DataAnalytics #BusinessIntelligence #AI #CustomerSuccess"
