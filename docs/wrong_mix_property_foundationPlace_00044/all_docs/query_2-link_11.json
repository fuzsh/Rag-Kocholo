There are a lot of resources to help you develop your Qlik scripting capabilities including:\n\nQlik Continuous Classroom (https://learning.qlik.com)\n\nQlik Community (https://community.qlik.com)\n\nQlik Product Documentation (https://help.qlik.com)\n\nIn terms of your sample data question. If you are creating a Qlik Sense app you can use the Qlik Data Manager to link your data.\n\nThis is excellent because not only will it try and analyse your data and make useful suggestions to link fields, it will also build the script which you can then review and use as a basis for developing your own understanding further.\n\nLooking at your sample data, one option might be a simple key field between a couple of the tables. Here is one example of how this could work.\n\nRod"
