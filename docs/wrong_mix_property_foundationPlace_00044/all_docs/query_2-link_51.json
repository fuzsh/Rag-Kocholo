        "text": "Staige presentation\n\nStaige is made up of pre-existing Qlik capabilities, new tools designed specifically for the suite and connectors to generative AI platforms.\n\nPreviously existing Qlik tools that help users develop trusted data for their AI include Insight Advisor, an AI assistant that enables customers to ask questions and receive responses that include relevant text and visualizations; AutoML, a tool to perform predictive analysis; and automated generation of SQL code, which enables developers to save time as they build and train AI models.\n\nConnectors link to generative AI platforms including Amazon SageMaker, ChatGPT, exprt.ai and Hugging Face.\n\nIn addition, Qlik said it plans to add a connector to Microsoft Fabric and develop support for vector databases. Vector databases enable users to store unstructured data that, once given structure by being assigned a vector, can be combined with traditional structured data to provide more comprehensive information.\n\nFinally, new tools that are part of Staige include the following:\n\nCapabilities that enable users to develop dashboards and natural language insights with just a few clicks.\n\nKey driver analysis that automatically identifies what is having the most impact on an outcome.\n\nNatural language processing capabilities that enable users to generate scripts without writing code.\n\nAI-generated insights that surface and summarize findings within a user's dashboard.\n\nA generative AI support chatbot built with capabilities from Ada.\n\nNone of the individual AI capabilities in Staige demonstrate significant innovation, according to Donald Farmer, founder and principal of TreeHive Strategy.\n\nHowever, as a whole, Staige is an important addition for Qlik customers, he continued.\n\n\"Staige represents an evolution and consolidation of Qlik's existing AI capabilities into a more holistic platform rather than introducing brand new generative AI capabilities,\" Farmer said. \"It's significant in providing an integrated AI platform but not radically new capabilities. The emphasis is on accessibility, governance and scaling existing AI.\"\n\nRegarding the new capabilities, he added that they show steady progress but aren't breakthroughs.\n\n\"New capabilities like AI-assisted scripting, analysis types and key driver analysis seem more incremental,\" Farmer said.\n\nMike Leone, an analyst at TechTarget's Enterprise Strategy Group, similarly noted that Staige isn't made up of capabilities that markedly advance what data consumers can do with AI.\n\nIt's launch does, however, signal Qlik's commitments to AI and enabling its customers to use generative AI to improve their business.\n\n\"Staige highlights Qlik's continued emphasis on enabling customers to boost productivity and efficiency with generative AI, while simplifying the on ramp and reducing risk,\" Leone said. \"[It shows] Qlik's belief that generative AI will change the way businesses operate. And by providing â€¦ access to generative AI capabilities and tools, customers are enabled to embrace AI on their terms.\"\n\nWhile Staige provides a secure environment for generative AI use and will help the vendor's customer develop and train AI models, Qlik is not the only analytics vendor building environments for generative AI.\n\nIn the nearly 10 months since OpenAI launched ChatGPT -- which represented a significant improvement in generative AI and large language model capabilities -- dozens of analytics and data management vendors have unveiled plans to add generative AI capabilities to their platforms.\n\nSome have simply revealed plans that integrate their tools with those from OpenAI and other generative AI developers. Others, such as Databricks and Snowflake, have added generative AI knowledge and tooling by acquiring other vendors.\n\nStill others, including Domo, are building complete environments within their platforms where users can build generative AI models and enhance their data with generative AI.\n\nFor months, most of the capabilities introduced by analytics vendors were in the preview stage. But some now are making generative AI tools available to all customers.\n\n\"Most [vendors] at this point have defined an underlying approach to enabling businesses to consume generative AI,\" Leone said. \"While different competitors may have names for an underlying platform or capability, Staige serves as the strategic North Star for Qlik in the generative AI space.\""
