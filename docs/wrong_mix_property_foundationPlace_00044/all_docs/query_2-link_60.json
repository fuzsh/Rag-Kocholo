        "text": "The CData ODBC drivers expand your ability to work with data from more than 200 data sources. QlikView is a business discovery platform that provides self-service BI for all business users in an organization. This article outlines simple steps to connect to Parquet data using the CData ODBC driver and create data visualizations in QlikView.\n\nThe CData ODBC drivers offer unmatched performance for interacting with live Parquet data in QlikView due to optimized data processing built into the driver. When you issue complex SQL queries from QlikView to Parquet, the driver pushes supported SQL operations, like filters and aggregations, directly to Parquet and utilizes the embedded SQL engine to process unsupported operations (often SQL functions and JOIN operations) client-side. With built-in dynamic metadata querying, you can visualize and analyze Parquet data using native QlikView data types.\n\nConnect to Parquet as an ODBC Data Source\n\nIf you have not already, first specify connection properties in an ODBC DSN (data source name). This is the last step of the driver installation. You can use the Microsoft ODBC Data Source Administrator to create and configure ODBC DSNs.\n\nConnect to your local Parquet file(s) by setting the URI connection property to the location of the Parquet file.\n\nWhen you configure the DSN, you may also want to set the Max Rows connection property. This will limit the number of rows returned, which is especially helpful for improving performance when designing reports and visualizations.\n\nPopulate a Chart with Parquet Data\n\nThe steps below supply the results of an SQL query to a visualization in QlikView. In this article, you will create a bar chart with the query below:\n\nSELECT Id, Column1 FROM SampleTable_1 WHERE Column2 = 'SAMPLE_VALUE'\n\nClick File -> Edit Script (or click the Edit Script button in the Toolbar).\n\nOn the Data tab, select ODBC in the Database menu and click Connect.\n\nSelect the DSN (CData Parquet Sys) in the resulting dialog. A command like the following is generated: ODBC CONNECT TO [CData Parquet Sys];\n\nEnter the SQL query directly into the script with the SQL command (or click Select to build the query in the SELECT statement wizard). SQL SELECT Id, Column1 FROM SampleTable_1 WHERE Column2 = 'SAMPLE_VALUE';\n\nWhere possible, the SQL operations in the query, like filters and aggregations, will be pushed down to Parquet, while any unsupported operations (which can include SQL functions and JOIN operations) will be managed client-side by the CData SQL engine embedded in the driver.\n\nClose the script editor and reload the document to execute the script.\n\nClick Tools -> Quick Chart Wizard. In the wizard, select the chart type. This example uses a bar chart. When building the chart, you have access to the fields from Parquet, typed appropriately for QlikView, thanks to built-in dynamic metadata querying.\n\nWhen defining Dimensions, select Id in the First Dimension menu.\n\nWhen defining Expressions, click the summary function you want and select Column1 in the menu.\n\nFinish the wizard to generate the chart. The CData ODBC Driver for Parquet connects to live Parquet data, so the chart can be refreshed to see real-time changes. Live connections are possible and effective, thanks to the high-performance data processing native to CData ODBC Drivers."
