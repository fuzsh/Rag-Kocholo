        "text": "Rather, \"associative\" is a term that can reasonably be used to describe the functionality of QlikView's user interface. In particular, QlikView can \"associate\" over fields that have the same name, in that it makes it easy for users to join across them.\n\nTo get its UI flexibility, QlikView implicitly assumes a star/snowflake schema. That is, there should be no more and no less than one possible join path between any pair of tables. In some cases, this means one will want to rename fields as part of QlikView load scripts. For example,\n\nIf two keys are meant to be joined on, you might want to give them the same name.\n\nIf two columns have the same name and mean different things (e.g., different kinds of dates), you can give them different names.\n\nYou can mark which columns you do or don't want to have \"qualified\" names - i.e., table-specific modifications that force the names to be unique.\n\nQlikView is designed for gigabytes-scale databases. (More precisely, it's constrained by how much RAM you can address in a single box, and that's how the numbers currently work out.) In particular:\n\nQlikTech recommends 2-4 gigabytes of compressed data per core. QlikTech says 10X is a good rule of thumb for compression, although it sounded like that's a little (not a lot) on the high side when compared simply to raw data.\n\nQlikTech further recommends RAM amounting to another 10% of data size be set aside for each concurrent user (e.g., for cache). However, Hakan said that's really too pessimistic, and in most cases 5% would suffice.\n\nBottom line: QlikView \"comfortably\" handles databases with 10-20 gigabytes of compressed data, at whatever product of record count and record length you like. (E.g., 1 billion relatively narrow records.) That's on the order of 100 gigabytes of raw data.\n\nIndeed, several QlikView customers manage several billion records each.\n\nThe main ingredient of the performance secret sauce in QlikView is that selections are compiled straight into machine code. (QlikTech gave me the impression that this post is the first time that will be publicly revealed.) Notes on that include:\n\nIn the old days, QlikTech thought compilation gave a 10X performance benefit vs. interpreted code. However, 5X might be a more up-to-date figure.\n\nIt's not just code; part of the compilation is to create temporary lookup tables.\n\nA single calculation can use multiple cores. QlikTech thinks it's done a very solid job of engineering efficient multicore parallelism. (Note: So far as I could tell, Hakan was using \"calculation\" to refer both to queries and, well, calculations.)\n\nThere's a good reason QlikView runs only on Intel-compatible processors. A port would be painful.\n\nIn QlikView's world, one set of users accesses one set of applications against one database on one machine. However, different subsets (or copies of the same subset) of the same underlying database(s) can of course be run on different machines.\n\nNaturally, QlikView caches results and tries to re-use them. One smart thing about QlikView's caching algorithm is that it takes into account the cost of generating the calculated results. This has the happy effect that large result sets, which are often the ones most likely to be useful in a subsequent calculation, are the ones most likely to be retained.\n\nOne thing I unfortunately forgot to ask about is loading QlikView data into memory, something that has at times been problematic.\n\nOne possible explanation is weirdness with international distributors, which is at least potentially consistent with what QlikTech says is a shift in geographical mix.\n\nAnother explanation is increasing deal size/complexity, something that is anyway common among enterprise software companies gaining market share, and that is also consistent with what QlikTech says is a growing fraction of revenue coming from existing customers."
