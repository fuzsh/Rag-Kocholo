        "text": "Based on the aggregated intelligence of 170,000-plus investors participating in Motley Fool CAPS, the Fool's free investing community, business intelligence (BI) specialist Qlik Technologies (Nasdaq: QLIK) has earned a respected four-star ranking.\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a closer look at QlikTech and see what CAPS investors are saying about the stock right now.\n\nQlikTech facts\n\nSources: Capital IQ (a division of Standard & Poor's) and Motley Fool CAPS.\n\nOn CAPS, 96% of the 190 members who have rated QlikTech believe the stock will outperform the S&P 500 going forward. These bulls include Ak66 and All-Star Gtrinvestor, who is ranked in the top 0.1% of our community.\n\nJust two weeks ago, Ak66 tapped QlikTech as a particularly intelligent pick: \"I use BI reports routinely at work and their complexity slows the usage among my peers. Qlik seems to provide a system that is easier and more accessible and will work for 90% plus of the data we manage.\"\n\nTo be sure, QlikTech trades at a huge forward P/E (67.1) premium compared with foes IBM (11.6), Microsoft (10.4), SAP (15.0), and Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) (13.7), as well as smaller competitors like Actuate (Nasdaq: BIRT) (13.0) and MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) (24.3). Of course, with such a large amount of positive reviews recently, QlikTech's BI solutions seem too special for Gtrinvestor not to invest in:\n\nOK, I have a really hard time picking up a niche product company with a $2B market cap when it is still in its nascent stages of growth. However, I have heard from people at other companies that they absolutely love this tool (I haven't seen it myself yet). If this tool can do what others say (including TMF in its write-up) then maybe this is a steal? Maybe an acquisition candidate by Oracle?"
