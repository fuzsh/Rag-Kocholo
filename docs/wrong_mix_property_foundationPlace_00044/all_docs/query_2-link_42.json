Knowing their differences is important for organisations to find the right tool for their Data Analysis needs. Let's thoroughly compare these two platforms, examining their differences across multiple aspects.\n\n1) Software application\n\nQlikView is renowned as a guided analytics tool that provides users with pre-built dashboards and reports. QlikView is mainly utilised for guided analytics and dashboard development, catering to users preferring structured analysis with specific reporting needs.\n\nOn the other hand, Qlik Sense is positioned as a self-service Data Visualisation tool. It focuses on wider accessibility, letting users explore data freely and create visualisations without much IT assistance. This makes Qlik Sense more suitable for organisations empowering users across different departments to analyse data independently.\n\n2) Guided analytics\n\nGuided analytics is a central feature of QlikView. It offers pre-built dashboards and reports, providing users with a structured approach to Data Analysis. This approach benefits users who prefer having predefined analytics paths and require quick access to insights without much exploration.\n\nConversely, Qlik Sense puts a greater emphasis on self-service analytics. Users can explore data in their own way and create personalised visualisations and dashboards. This empowers users to delve deeper into data, uncovering insights not readily apparent in pre-built dashboards.\n\n3) OLAP features\n\nQlikView is known for its robust Online Analytical Processing capabilities (OLAP), enabling multidimensional analysis and complex calculations. Its powerful engine enables intricate data modelling and analysis, favouring it by organisations handling complex datasets.\n\nWhile Qlik Sense simplifies data modelling with a more user-friendly approach, it may lack some advanced OLAP functionalities in QlikView. However, for users who prioritise ease of use and flexibility over advanced analytical capabilities, Qlik Sense remains a compelling option.\n\n4) Data filtering\n\nQlikView offers sophisticated data filtering options, allowing users to slice and dice data dynamically for detailed analysis. Its advanced filtering capabilities enable users to drill down into specific data subsets, facilitating deeper insights and analysis.\n\nIn contrast, Qlik Sense provides intuitive filtering mechanisms that make it easier for users to refine their data views. Although Qlik Sense may lack QlikView's depth in data filtering complexity, its user-friendly interface attracts those favouring simpler data exploration.\n\n5) Data storytelling\n\nQlikView focuses primarily on data exploration and analysis, with limited built-in data storytelling features. It aims to equip users with tools to discover insights and guide data-informed decision-making processes.\n\nQlik Sense, on the other hand, prioritises data storytelling. It offers robust capabilities for creating compelling narratives around insights derived from data. Users can leverage various visualisation tools and storytelling features to communicate their findings effectively to stakeholders.\n\nStreamline operations with our Flowchart and Process Mapping Training. Join now for optimised efficiency!\n\n6) Modern visualisation\n\nQlik Sense boasts modern and responsive visualisation options, catering to contemporary design preferences. Qlik Sense's nice-looking charts and graphs help present data better, making it easier for users to understand and analyse information.\n\nQlikView's visuals work well, but they could be more attractive and responsive than the charts and graphs in Qlik Sense. This can be significant for organisations seeking a more modern and engaging Data Visualisation experience.\n\n7) Associative indexing engine\n\nQlikView and Qlik Sense leverage Qlik's associative indexing engine, enabling users to explore data relationships dynamically. This engine allows users to navigate through data intuitively, uncovering connections and insights that may take time to become apparent.\n\n8) Advanced analytics integration\n\nQlikView supports advanced analytics integration through third-party tools and extensions, enhancing its predictive analytics capabilities. Users can use different analytical methods to gain deeper insights from their data and make well-informed decisions.\n\nQlik Sense offers seamless integration with advanced analytics platforms, enabling users to directly incorporate predictive and prescriptive analytics into their Data Analysis workflows. This integration streamlines the analytical process, allowing users to derive actionable insights more efficiently.\n\n9) Mobile compatibility\n\nQlikView provides mobile compatibility, allowing users to access and interact with data on mobile devices. However, it may require additional configuration for optimal performance on smartphones and tablets.\n\nQlik Sense provides native mobile apps and responsive design, ensuring smooth usage across different devices. Users can access their data anytime on mobile devices, ensuring full functionality and optimal performance.\n\n10) Integrated app development\n\nQlikView provides extensive app development features, enabling users to craft custom applications suited to their specific requirements. Its robust development environment allows users to design and deploy sophisticated Data Analysis and visualisation applications.\n\nSimilarly, Qlik Sense provides integrated app development features, enabling users to build and deploy data-driven applications quickly. The intuitive interface and drag-and-drop feature simplify app development, enabling users to create interactive applications without needing advanced programming skills.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile QlikView and Qlik Sense share a common ancestry and core principles, they cater to different user requirements and preferences. Organisations must grasp key differences between QlikView vs Qlik Sense to select the tool that aligns with their Data Analytics objectives."
