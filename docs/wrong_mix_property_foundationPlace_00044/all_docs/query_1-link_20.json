        "text": "We are the data specialists who can drive real change by enabling data-driven decision-making at all levels in your organization with Qlik Sense®.\n\nCollect and combine diverse data from infinite data sources and utilize them to draw actionable insights. With Qlik’s pre-configured connectivity, you can draw data from both legacy and modern databases, cloud services, enterprise applications, and local storage files.\n\nSelect, eliminate, magnify, and transform your data visually, depending on your needs. Improve your findings and better represent them with the help of auto-generated analysis, chart recommendations, and data combination suggestions by Qlik’s Insight Advisor.\n\nUsing Qlik Mashups, you can now integrate advanced analytics like R to derive more visually smart analytics reports. Our team of Qlik consultants will guide you through analytics implementation and help you in invoking remote analytics models that integrate perfectly with your systems.\n\nQlik takes an end-to-end approach to data and analytics, offering a full breadth of capabilities supporting the overall supply chain from data to insight. Data is the foundation resource of the new economy, and analytics transform that data into insights. And those insights are what drive actions that ultimately transform businesses.\n\nMigration\n\nUsing our trusted framework and accelerators, we help you migrate effortlessly from other BI platforms to Qlik Sense or QlikView without compromising the integrity or validity of your existing data. We also enable QlikView organizations to transition into QlikSense. QlikSense Migration activates a more intuitive user experience and better responsiveness for mobile devices.\n\nEnd-to-end Implementation\n\nOur team of Qlik experts, architects, and developers will work continuously to ensure that your Qlik functionalities are implemented correctly and are in line with your business requirements. By carrying out regular iterations based on updated business scenarios, operations monitoring, auditing, and troubleshooting, we ensure that your Qlik platform is well equipped to respond quickly to business changes.\n\nData Strategy\n\nHaving helped many enterprises switch and modernize their data efficiently with no loss in data integrity or structure, our team can help create a comprehensive data strategy for your entire organization. The strategy will help you evaluate your existing data/Qlik stack, suggest improvements for your organization’s analytics process and support the achievement of your overall BI goals.\n\nData Models and Dashboards\n\nWe can help you create data models in Star, Snowflake, or Hybrid designs depending on your data components and business requirements. Our team of consultants will effectively use Qlik mashups or default Qlik components to create visually engaging data dashboards, designed specifically to meet your business needs, with built-in data and user security.\n\nData Integration and Warehousing\n\nWe will help you identify relevant data sources, configure target end-points and integrate your data across diverse data touchpoints like social media, unstructured data (audio, video, files, emails), large data logs (call records, web logs), and big data including IoT. This integration helps automate your entire data warehouse lifecycle thereby accelerating the availability of analytics-ready data.\n\nData Cataloging\n\nWe can guide you through an effective cataloging process that lets you standardize insight generation, create relevant and trusted data sets based on business use cases, and establish a fully governed data management process. Qlik’s Enterprise Data Catalog offers pre-compiled query parameters that let you simplify and scale the process of defining the contents of data sets, apps, and other assets.\n\nQlik’s AI-core integrates well with almost every industry. Today it is especially popular among leading companies from the following industries.\n\nIntegrating Qlik into your company process alone does not optimize performance. Our experts can customize Qlik specifically for your industry and help address challenges unique to your business.\n\nTraditional BI offers limited insights with a tunnel view of data that limits your understanding of the larger picture. With Qlik Sense, you can start relying on an Active Intelligence platform that not only offers real-time data insights that trigger immediate decision-making, but also maps it intelligently with relevant data sets in order to give you a comprehensive overview of situations – acting very much like a peripheral vision for your business."
