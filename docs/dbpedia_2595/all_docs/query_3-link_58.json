        "text": "A Possible Design\n\nGuernsey Weekly Press, 1920\n\nAfter a long delay a definitive and satisfactory idea for an Island War Memorial has arrived, and we have before us as we write a very clever sketch and outline plan drawn by Mr J G West, O.B.E., of London, for the erection of a massive obelisk at the Belvedere at the Cotils, on the site of the recent landslide.\n\nThere has been inevitable delay in bringing any formulative plan into being, for, of course, there were so many opinions on the question of a site and of the form of the Memorial. All the parishes have been in council on the matter and various schemes have been mentioned.\n\nIt was with a mandate from this island-wide representation that a Sub-Committee was elected to bring into shape a scheme which would be considered to meet with the widest public approval. This Sub-Committee was composed of Messrs. H. G. Le Cheminant, A. A. Veal, P. V Dorey, G. F. Peek and E. W. Hutton. These gentlemen at once set to work to get a very competent authority in the Art World as their adviser, and wrote asking for this assistance to the Board of Works, London.\n\nAs a result of these negotiations Mr. J. G. West, O.B.E., who took such a prominent part in the erection of the great Cenotaph in Whitehall, visited Guernsey a fortnight ago, and after conferring with the sub-committee at length, submitted plans and reasons for the selection of the Cotils site.\n\nFrom the Guernsey Press, January 1921.\n\n\"Our War Memorial\"\n\nThe Local War Memorial Committee met again on Thursday under the presidency of Sir Edward C. Ozanne, K.B.E. Designs for war memorials, of other than the Cenotaph type, have been collected and examined. The decision of the meeting finally arrived at was to erect a cross of Guernsey granite in the plantation at the top of Smith St. It is proposed to erect the cross on an octagonal base; the faces of the octagon to bear bronze plates inscribed with the names of those of Guernsey birth who fell in the Great War.\n\nAn estimate of the approximate cost is being invited from the designers. It is felt that by executing the Memorial in our splendid local stone an imperishable monument will be obtained which will be the work of local stone dressers.\n\nAs soon as the estimate is received, the recommended design will be reproduced in the local press and a public meeting held to ratify the selection."
