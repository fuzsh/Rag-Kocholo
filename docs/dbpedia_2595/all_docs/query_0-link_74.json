        "text": "Description\n\nGeorge Armstrong Custer (December 5, 1839 â€“ June 25, 1876) was a United States Army officer and cavalry commander in the American Civil War and the American Indian Wars.\n\nOn June 25, 1876, while leading the 7th Cavalry Regiment at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in Montana Territory against a coalition of Native American tribes, he was killed along with every soldier of the five companies he led. This event became known as \"Custer's Last Stand\".\n\nHis dramatic end was as controversial as the rest of his career, and the reaction to his life and career remains deeply divided. His legend was partly his own fabrication through his extensive publicity, and perhaps more through the energetic lobbying of his wife Elizabeth Bacon \"Libbie\" Custer throughout her long widowhood which spanned six decades.\n\nWikipedia\n\nThis is a general description. It is not a review."
