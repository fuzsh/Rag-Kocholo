        "text": "Carteret, John, 2nd Baron Carteret, 1st Earl Granville\n\nCarteret, John, 2nd Baron Carteret, 1st Earl Granville (1690–1763). Carteret achieved prominence through Baltic diplomacy, 1719–20, and emerged untainted by the South Sea bubble crisis to become secretary of state for the southern department in 1721. Walpole and Townshend's jealousy led to his demotion to the lord-lieutenancy of Ireland in 1724 and dismissal in 1730, whereupon he became a leader of the Whig opposition. Upon Walpole's fall in 1742, Carteret was appointed secretary of state for the northern department. He quickly became George II's favourite minister and developed complex diplomatic schemes to assist Austria, Britain's ally in the War of the Austrian Succession. In the Commons there was outrage at the lack of apparent benefit and cost of Carteret's policies, led by Pitt but abetted by the Pelham brothers; in November 1744 Granville (as he had become) was forced to resign. After some years of semi-retirement, Granville was persuaded by Newcastle in 1751 to become lord president. He acted as an adviser to the king, Pitt, and Newcastle throughout the Seven Years War. Though often ill or inebriated, his opinions were much respected by the cabinet. An accomplished classicist, linguist, and wit, Granville's career was restricted by his laziness and an insufficient regard for the power of the Commons.\n\nAndrew Iain Lewer\n\nCite this article\n\nPick a style below, and copy the text for your bibliography.\n\nMLA\n\nChicago\n\nAPA\n\nJOHN CANNON \"Carteret, John, 2nd Baron Carteret, 1st Earl Granville .\" The Oxford Companion to British History. .

Then, copy and paste the text into your bibliography or works cited list.\n\nBecause each style has its own formatting nuances that evolve over time and not all information is available for every reference entry or article, Encyclopedia.com cannot guarantee each citation it generates. Therefore, it’s best to use Encyclopedia.com citations as a starting point before checking the style against your school or publication’s requirements and the most-recent information available at these sites:\n\nModern Language Association\n\nhttp://www.mla.org/style\n\nThe Chicago Manual of Style\n\nhttp://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html\n\nAmerican Psychological Association\n\nhttp://apastyle.apa.org/\n\nNotes:\n\nMost online reference entries and articles do not have page numbers. Therefore, that information is unavailable for most Encyclopedia.com content. However, the date of retrieval is often important. Refer to each style’s convention regarding the best way to format page numbers and retrieval dates.\n\nIn addition to the MLA, Chicago, and APA styles, your school, university, publication, or institution may have its own requirements for citations. Therefore, be sure to refer to those guidelines when editing your bibliography or works cited list."
