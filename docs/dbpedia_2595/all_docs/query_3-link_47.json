The French refer to them as Iles Normandes.\n\nHistory\n\nJersey is the largest of the Channel Islands. Jersey and the other Channel Islands have a fascinating history. While located only a few miles from the French coast, the islands have been British for centuries. The island would have come under Roman control during Ceasar's conquest of Gaul and attempts to invade Britain (1st century BC). Christianity was introduced during Roman times. Jerseys hermit and martyr, St. Helier is credited with the christinaztion of the island (6th century AD). He appears to have been murdered by Saxon pirates. Vikings known as Norse marauders rotinely plunder the islands in the summer months century Norman pirates would plunder the island during the summer months (9th century AD). French King Charles the Simple, unable to defeat the Vikings, bargained with Rollo, their chief. Rollo was granted their land around Rouen hich acquired the name of later known as Normandy. Rollos son William upon becoming Duke of Normandy, incorporated the Channel Islands into the duchy. Jerseys laws and customs thus date to the era Norman rule (933-1204 AD). Duke William inaded England and defeated the Saxon King Harold at Hastings (1066) and is better known to history as William the Conquer. (In fact both Harold and William were Vikings.) The islands as part of the patrimony of the Dukes of Normandy and after Duke Willian conquered England (1066), the islands have been controlled by England rather than France. The Channel Islands are today the represent the last remnants of the medieval Dukedom of Normandy. From the cornaion of William as king of England, Jersey has been associated with the English Crown. King John waged war with France, but lost (1204). At this time, the Channel Islands were given a choice to swear allegiance to England or France and they chose England. Almost the entire second millenium saw war between France and England and Jersey's location in the Channel put it squarely between the two waring nations. Fortifications to protect against a French invsion were built all over the island. King John ordered the construction of Mont Orgueil Castle to protect the eastern approaches to the island. The Tudors built Elizabeth Castle to defend the own of St. Helier (16th century). Martello towers located all along the coast were built to protect the island from French attack (late 18th century). They were impoerant to protect the island during the French Revolution and Napolonic Wars. The French staged several attacks on Jersy, but only managed to establish control for brief periods. There is even a connection with America. The state of New Jersey is named after Jersey. This dates back to the English Civil War. Charles II found refuge on Jersey, both as Prince of Wales and after the execution of his father, the exiled king. After the restoration, Charles made land grants in America to Sir George Carteret which were named New Jersey. The Channel Islnds during World War II became the only British territory occupied by the NAZIs. The NAZIs seized the islands immeditaely after the fall of France (1940). After Dunkirk, Churchill realized that the Channel Islands could not be defended. There were fears at the time that Britiai itself could nt hold out. Churchill declared the islands demilitarised. Jersey islanders had to evacuate to England leaving their homes and family or remain and face the NAZIs. About 10,000 did evacuate and 40,000 stayed. When the fortunes of war changed, Hitler unlike Churchill decided against all miltary logic to defend the Channel Islands. . Hitler was particularly interested in the Islands, presumably for propaganda reasons. Hitler ordered the construction of elaborate fortifications on both Jersey and Guernsey. These military instalations were constructed by slave labor imported by the NAZIs. These workers labored under appalling conditions. Those efforts were given priority over the Atlantac Wall along the coast of France. With these fortifications, the German held out even after the liberation of France (1944). The Germans finally surrendered (1945).\n\nIndividual Islands\n\nThe main islands are: Jersey, Guernsey, Aldernay, Sark, and Herm. The two largest Channel Islands are Gernsey and Jersey. The islands have two administrative districts. Jersey has about half the total population. The main town is St. Helier. We have some information on Jersey. The other administrative distruct is Guernsey and all the other islands.\n\nCulture\n\nEnglish gradually replaced French as the official language.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe climate provided rich pasttures and as a result the economies were largely pastoral, both sheep and cow. As a result of the sheep and weaving industry there, the term jersey has passed into the English language as a clothing term. The islands are also well known for the cattle breeds develped there.\n\nClothing\n\nwe do not have any information on clothing styles worn on the islands in historic times. Nor do we know if there are any destinctive clothing styles associated with the Channel Islands. Here we see a boy who had his portrait taken on Guernsey in 1893. The sailor suit he wears is indistinguishable from similar outfits worn in England itself.\n\nHBC\n\nNavigate the Boys' Historical Clothing Web Site:\n\n[Return to the Main English regional page]\n\n[Return to the Main English page]\n\n[Introduction] [Activities] [Biographies] [Chronology] [Clothing styles] [Countries] [Essays]\n\n[Bibliographies] [Contributions] [FAQs] [Glossary] [Satellite sites] [Tools]\n\n[Boys' Clothing Home]\n\nCreated: 9:58 PM 8/3/2004\n\nLast updated: 9:58 PM 8/3/2004"
