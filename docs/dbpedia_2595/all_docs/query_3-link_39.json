The Division was in the fighting line till the 19th July when it was again withdrawn to rest and to refit.\n\nAfter the Battle of the Somme in July 1916, Major- General Ingouville-Williams paid the following tribute to his men: \" My men did glorious deeds. Never have I seen men go through such a hell of a barrage of artillery. They advanced as on parade, and never flinched. I can't speak too highly of them. They earned a great record. But, alas ! at a great cost. I am very sad at losing all my brave fellows, but so glad that their grand work is appreciated by the Corps Commander, Army Commander and Sir Douglas Haig. My brave men had to face a long advance to reach their objective. They were swept by that awful barrage,double barrage. Some got through, but could not. remain so far off without support. They did their duty nobly. Never shall I cease singing the praises of my men, and I shall never have the same grand men to deal with again. I think they have done their part well, and their attack made all the subsequent success possible.\"\n\nAlthough he was renowned as a stern disciplinarian, he was affectionately known by his men with the nickname \"Inky Bill\".\n\nOn the 22nd July Major- General Ingouville-Williams went with his Aide De Camp to the Bois-de-Mametz to make a personal reconnaissance of the ground where he was to take his Division into action the following week,on the bank at Queen's Nullah, south-west of Mametz Wood, after having walked back from Contalmaison round the south side of the wood to meet his car which was at Montauban, he was caught in a barrage of fire and was hit by a piece of shell which killed him instantly. He was 54 years of age when he was killed.\n\nHe had been mentioned in Despatches four times for his services in the war.\n\nToday,Major General Edward Charles Ingouville-Williams rests in peace with his men in the Warloy-Baillon Communal Cemetery Extension, Somme, and his grave bears the following inscription \"Greatly beloved\".\n\nEdward, Sir, today I stand in front of you with respect and admiration just like the men who were under your command and who saw in you more than an officer, they saw in you a man of honor with great heart that cared for them, they saw in you their fathers, a man who guided them with affection. you who have spent your life in the army, in wars, you have done more than your duty by leading generations of young men in battle, men that you admired and that you were very proud of and I imagine the pain and sadness it must have been for you to see so many of these young men falling on the battlefield.today your men rest in peace near you and we watch over them with the respect, love and affection that you had for them, we will always be present for them, you and your men have served with exceptional bravery and we will never forget, your name, your history and the history of your men will live forever in grateful remembrance, in our hearts and in our thoughts, you will live eternally in each of us."
