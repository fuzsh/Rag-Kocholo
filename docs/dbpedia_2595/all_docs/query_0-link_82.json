        "text": "A b s t r a c t. This article concerns the execution of the ornaments—a very important question in the stylistic interpretation of the French harpsichord baroque music. The starting-point for reflection is treatise of the Monsieur de Saint-Lambert, a very enigmatic person, the author of Les prin-cipes du clavecin, centenant une explication exacte de tout ce qui concerne la tabulature et le cla-vier avec des remarques necessaires pour l'inteligence de plusieurs difficultées de la musique (The fundamentals of harpsichord playing, with explanations on musical notation and performance , together with explanatory remarks about different music issues), issued in 1702. He was highly valued as a harpsichord teacher and his treatises concerned the different aspects of playing keyboard instruments are the only preserved evidence of his musical and educational activities. It must be noticed that Saint-Lambert was the author of one of the oldest French treatises dedicated solely to the issues of harpsichord playing and his teaching method of mastering the instrument was at that time quite pioneering. The most important part of his treatise is the last nine chapters, focused on practical issues, where we can find the author's advice on different aspects of existing keyboard music. The main problem in performing harpsichord music at Saint-Lambert's time was the proper interpretation of music notation, which due to technical constraints (not yet perfect printing and editing of music works), was not able to reflect the whole variety of nuances of contemporary music style. So, the treatise Les principes du clavecin is a very helpful key to the understanding of the 18 th century music.\n\nIn my view, there are faults in our way of writing music that correspond to the ways of writing our language. The fact is that we write differently from how we play, and thus foreigners do not play our music as well as we play theirs.. .. [O]ur usage has enslaved us, and we persist in it. 1 The French clavecinistes were convinced of the strong connection between the French language and music. To them, such links could not only be made at the level of philosophical discourse, but also affected down-to-earth issues relating to composition and performance. Although most musicians seemed to agree that music was strongly influenced by language, the relationship was not always considered to be beneficial. Not only did composers discover defects in what we would term 'musical language', but they also correlated these weaknesses with parallel problems affecting certain aspects of verbal language. By mapping linguistic ideas onto aspects of French harpsichord music, I consider in this article how the French desire to rationalize usageça passion shared by both linguists and musiciansçshaped the development of clavecin music in matters of notation and performance from its traceable origins in the 1650s to its maturity in the music of Franc° ois Couperin and Rameau. The codification of music, driven by both aesthetic and practical concerns and by technical innovation (in particular the timely arrival of musical engraving in France), led to some visible outcomes, such as the expressed preference for printed music, the codification of ornaments, notes ine¤ gales, and other performance matters; the proliferation of published pedagogical and theoretical writings; and the replacement of unmeasured with measured preludes. However, there was also a growing awareness of the enormous gap between rules (theory) and usage (practice), and between notation and performance, and many musicians resorted to the more nebulous notion of le bon gou \" t as the ultimate way to legitimize all the exceptions , liberties, excesses, and grey areas in performance.\n\nThe middle part of the eighteenth century saw seismic shifts in philosophical and political thought. Closely related to these are a range of new aesthetic ideas and the musical styles associated with them. Instrumental music, and more specifically harpsichord music of mid- eighteenth-century France, has been surprisingly sparsely studied by musicologists and performers alike. While seventeenth- and early-eighteenth-century harpsichord composers and their works have been treated extensively, there is a definite lack of understanding and knowledge of the harpsichord music of the period following the death of François Couperin in 1733 and the publication around 1728 of Jean-Philippe Rameau’s last book written for solo harpsichord, Nouvelles Suites de Pièces de Clavecin. The succeeding decades were marked by a significant aesthetic shift, induced and observed by both French and foreign musicians, composers, and philosophers. I argue that these aesthetic changes are also evident in harpsichord music and can be observed in Jacques Duphly’s (1715–1789) four books of harpsichord music (1744, 1748, 1756, 1768), the focus of my research. Little information has been readily available regarding Duphly’s life, and up until now, no serious contemporary study has focused on this subject. As part of this dissertation, I am providing a biographical account of Duphly, from his birth in Rouen to his life in Paris, and a chronological presentation of the contents of his books. Included in this presentation is a stylistic analysis of his works, a corpus that features the traditional French harpsichord style as well as elements that were both modern and foreign. Particular attention is given to explaining the aesthetic context of mid-eighteenth-century Paris and its relation to expression in instrumental music, including the concepts of mesure and mouvement. A comprehensive review of French temperaments completes this presentation of the instrumental context of the period. Examples drawn from Duphly’s four books help illustrate how these temperaments as well as aesthetic and stylistic concepts can be understood and therefore used by musicians as part of a historically informed performance practice."
