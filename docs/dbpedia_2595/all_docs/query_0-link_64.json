With the British Flag appearing. Since he is referred to as President. it's more likely he was revived somehow and sent back to his own time.\n\nHistory[]\n\nPrior to the Age of Darkness(65 Million B.C.E.-3,000 B.C.E.)[]\n\nPoint of Departure: 65 Million Years Ago\n\nIn ancient times, The Xorinite Wisp learned the Armageddon Spell and taught it to a human named Zog on Sosaria(What would become Britannia or the British Isles). Zog is a human mage during the era of the Dinosaur King civilization(Ultima).\n\nSeveral attacks transpire at once on the planet as he sees the Sporix Beasts attack with the extraterrestrial Knights of Rafkon arriving to fight them but losing(Power Rangers Dino Fury), Lavos landing on the Dinosaur King Capital(being from a warring Human Tribe with them, Zog nonetheless feels some sadness from this)(Chrono Trigger). The alien spaceship-city of T'leth crashing into the sea on Earth(X-COM: Terror from the Deep), The Brainspawn(Futurama) and Dragons killing many dinosaurs(Reign of Fire), Pyron and his army the Huitzil/Phobos(Darkstalkers). A Cetan spacecraft crashing(Perfect Dark) Fog Mother(Kamen Rider J), A duel between Keeper and the Bounty Hunter Sledge(Power Rangers Dino Charge), Lord Beerus(Dragonball Super), Death Ghidorah in battle with Mothra(Rebirth of Mothra), D.R. Dobbs and Ernie Quinch( D.R. & Quinch), And a more advanced species of Dinosaur(\"Big Game\" by Isaac Assimov).\n\nFaced with all these Dangers occurring at once as a joint effort to wipe out the Dinosaurs, Zog panicked and, unaware of just how dangerous it was, spoke the Armageddon Spell, which worked to kill every living thing of the planet except the user and beings at a certain power level(Ultima).\n\nThe Spell kills the Sporix Beasts and the Knights of Rafkon(before the Morphin Masters can bestow the Dino Charges on them), Lavos, The inhabitants of the T'leth, Cetan, ship, The Brainspawn, the Dragons, Pyron and the Huitzil/ Phobos, Fog Mother, Keeper, Sledge, Death Ghidorah, Mothra, D.R. Dobbs, Ernie Quinch, and the rogue Dinosaur race. Lord Beerus survives. Gemstones crash onto the site of the Dead Dinosaurs but since the curse killed them, there is no life energy for the Gemstones to take(Meaning No Power Rangers: Dino Thunder). The Corrupter Wyrm is never born due to these conditions(Old World of Darkness). Beerus tracks down Zog quickly and prepares to kill him, but then sees how remorseful he is. Beerus is interested and asks Zog to teach him the spell so that he could destroy other planets easier. Zog refuses and kills himself soon after out of guilt for his actions.\n\nWith the devastation of the Dinosaurs being much more widespread and instantaneous, several deities move in to create a new race of Humanity(While this occurred on Earth One, it happens much earlier here since the planet was still teeming with life in that universe. Here the Dinosaurs are well and truly extinct and the Earth nearly empty. The complete extinction of the Dinosaurs means no \"Lost Worlds\" exist as well as the Sinclair Family(Dinosaurs), or The Flintstones not existing ).\n\nHumanity likely still exists but in this case the process is much slower due to the death of all specimens, though Ultra terrestrials likely seed the Earth as they did on Earth One(The Outer Limits (1995). This results in Humanity developing much slower. None of the primitive Cavemen Civilizations like in the Flintstones, Mighty Mightor, No Kobol Ships leaving Earth(Battlestar Galactica). The flying Polyps and Great Race of Yith are all dead( Cthulhu Mythos). The Fendahl likely crashes on Earth after the 5th Planet's destruction but cannot guide humanity(Doctor Who).\n\n10 Million B.C.E.\n\nWithout Humanity being on the same level as on Earth One, The Precursors choose the Forerunners as the next bearers of the mantle, averting the war on Earth One that would have resulted from their rejection and the Precursors becoming the Flood. The Forerunners tend to resort to using WMD like weapons more readily against threats(Halo).\n\n6 Million B.C.E.\n\nThe Tanu and Firvulag arrive on Earth from the Duat galaxy(Saga of the Exiles)(Here they are the first colonizers since the Armageddon Spell and so have free rein over the Earth).\n\nAt this point australopithecines, the early primate has developed on Earth and History begins to force itself back on track somewhat with the appearance of the Monolith(2001: A Space Odyssey), crash landing of the Cybertronians and Mini-Cons(Transformers), arrival of the Pak(Known Space) and Golgafrincham B-Ark(The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), transpiring, though the events of Early Man and One Million Years B.C. do not as Humanity has not advanced that far yet and is only just Apes currently. Notably Atlantis and Lemuria do not exist due to Humanity being behind. Mu however did come to exist. It was at some point destroyed, possibly by Ythogtha (Avatar: The last Airbender, Legend of Korra, Out of Ages).\n\nGod creates Adam and Eve. The first true humans. History progresses with the Daemons arriving on Earth to begin wiping out the Neanderthals(Doctor Who). The Isu occupy the Earth before they are devastated by a Solar Flare(Assassin's Creed), Vandar Adg becomes immortal(DC Comics),\n\n48,000 B.C.E.\n\nThe Forerunners activate the mass relay during the Reaper-Forerunner War, defeating the Reapers(Without Humanity being capable of challenging them they are in better shape and since they are the Precursor successors they are confident enough to employ doomsday weapons, leaving much devastation).\n\n~20,000 B.C.E.\n\nGoats become first animal to be domesticated(Twig)\n\nWolves domesticated, possible in early China though specifics vary(Twig).\n\nThe Mayan Gods come into existence in South America. Izanagi no Mikoto and Izanami no Mikoto form Japan. The Dieties of Middle Earth battle Morgoth and succeed in killing him(The Silmarillion. There is now no need for Humanity to advance into technology akin to the Middle Ages, which is not the case on this Earth). The Goa'Uld under System Lord Ra begin abducting humans. The slow progression also means there is no Hyborian Age and Conan the Barbarian is instead \"Conan the Caveman\". Gaea gave birth to the Titans(Greek Mythology). Wakanda(Marvel Comics) evidently does not exist if we take that Agriculture hadn't been invented yet as stated in Twig, First defeat of the Daevites(SCP Foundation). The Daevites are far from an established society and more of a nomad tribe.\n\n~7,000 B.C.E.\n\nBirth of Agriculture(Twig)This is much later than real life which began in 9,500 B.C.E.).\n\nWheat domesticated in Levant(Twig)\n\nCorn domesticated in Central America(Twig)\n\nThere is no evidence of Either Shazam or Hawkman and Hawkgirl existing in this universe(DC Comics), Nor Ayesha and the City of Kor(She). Its possible the Osirans(Doctor Who) and Goa'Ulds(Stargate) still impersonate the Egyptians Gods, which in turn leads to them becoming real(American Gods).\n\n5,000 B.C.E.\n\nThe Greek Gods go down a different path. In this universe, Chronos never betrayed Uranos until after he gave birth to Zeus. Zeus then betrayed Chronos. As a result Greece became locked in a three way war between the Three Gods. The land of Greece takes the name of the Dark Unknown(The Name of the Greece based nation in Ultima).\n\nThe Events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings do not happen due to Morgoth's early Death. There is no purge by Humanity against the magical creatures, meaning several stories like Monsters Inc, and Undertale do not exist without the exile transpiring. Down the line, it is likely God still recreates Adam and Eve, as well as Akasha(Queen of the Damned), as well as the fall of Lucifer, possibly The Scorpion King also happens.\n\n3,015 B.C.E.\n\nThe Djinn Faquarl is first summoned in Jericho(The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n3,010 B.C.E.\n\nUruk, Sumer: The Djinn Bartimaeus is first summoned. His first job is to pinch a fertility stature from the love goddess’s sanctuary in Ur. Morally speaking, this sets the tone for his next 2000 years. Despite this, he at first experiences a ‘terrible joy’ – a feeling that his energies could cope with anything. This feeling vanishes when he’s sent off to irrigate and cultivate the Fertile Crescent(The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n3,000 B.C.E.\n\nThe first religious Cult known as the Cult of Truth was founded(3000 years before the founding of Britannia)( (Ultima)The Cult of Truth likely worships Truth from Fullmetal Alchemist).\n\nThe Island of Ambrosia(Named for the nurse of Dionysus) was destroyed by \"Rocks from the sky\", actually meteorites(Ultima).\n\nHumanity drove the Cyclopes species underground under orders of Zeus, due to their allegiance to his enemies(Ultima).\n\nSosaria(The British Isles): Among the Kingdoms to form was Akalabeth ruled by King Wolfgang. Wolfgang had two sons, one of which, Mondain, would kill his father and brother, taking his father's ruby gem(Ultima).\n\nA portal(known as a Moon Gate), opened and deposited a temporally displaced boy from Earth named Richard Garriott. He met the warrior Shamino and soon became a revered figure, the transportation granting him strange abilities(Ultima).\n\nThe Age of Darkness(3,000 B.C.E.-1,403 B.C.E.)[]\n\n2,900 B.C.E.+\n\nFor centuries, Bartimaeus is employed by various warring city states throughout southern Mesopotamia, helping conduct campaigns against their rivals. Notable early cities include: Ur, Kish, Eridu and Uruk. Soon he meets, and regularly crosses horns with, the djinni Faquarl, whose first summoning was in 3015, in Jericho(The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\nSosaria(The British Isles): Mondain used the ruby gem of his father to create the Gem of Immortality. He experimented on his own followers and turned them into hybrid creatures such as Minotaurs, Goblins and Lizardmen. This heralded the beginning of the Age of Darkness. Richard Garriott was able to drive Mondain from Akalabath in the corner of Sosaria. He was christened Lord British and gathered many heroes to aid him, coining the term \"Knight\" for them and helping to rid the local realm of monsters. Mondain's actions caused the lands of Sosaria to outlaw magic(Ultima)\n\nLands of Danger and Despair(Ireland): Lord British's friend Shamino became the ruler of his own kingdom in \"The Lands of Danger and Despair.\" Voyages out into the sea revealed the existence of sea monsters when the ship known as the Pembroke was sunk in front of a small armada(Ultima).\n\nMondain, seeking allies, traveled into space and recruited an alien race he called \"starwalking monsters of unparalleled savagery.\" While their identity is unclear they are theorized to be the Kilrathi(Ultima).\n\nThe Lands of the Dark Unknown(Greece): Zeus cements his power in this land. Its reputation as a dark land remains. Zeus himself is weakened. He reigns as king of Olympus. An Egyptian ruler named Ozymandias occupies the Castle of the Black Dragon(A Castle of the White Dragon also exist, both slavic in origin) as well as a German presence in the town of Nassau. All exist as the Greek God's fighting in the land left many chances for other people to move in(Ultima)(The Kings in Ultima I, could not be harmed. While this was just game mechanics. Here the Kings are Deities like Zeus, as such the mortal player character cannot harm them).\n\nThe Land of the Feudal Lords(Japan): The country was ruled by two kings situated in Rondorlin and Barataria. These Kings were the Deities Izanagi no Mikoto and his son Susanoo no Mikoto. The Land of the Feudal Lords and the Lands of the Dark Unknown made contact with each other due to Greek explorers and through them established a friendship with the Olympian Gods. As a result, they shared many aspects culturally. It was from the Land of the Feudal Lords that the Argonauts set sail on an unknown village rather than Greece as in Earth One. Similarly Heracules lived and met his end in a Dungeon, who's name became \"Where Hercules Died\" when translated. This land is also notable for colonizing Planet X(also known as Mondas), the tenth planet in the Solar System, building a second Castle Barataria there(Ultima).\n\nDungeons were quite common. Another notable difference is the continued existence of Mount Doom, rather than the Volcano's apparent destruction at the end of the Hyborian Age, as well as the continued existence of creatures native to that area such as Hobbits, Elves, Dwarves and Balrogs among others(Ultima).\n\nTechnology was more widely shared and space travel was more frequent to Earth. Of all things, Space Shuttle technology was introduced first(likely due to contact with alien races and time travellers) leading to Blacksmiths needing to quickly learn how to repair or build them as well as traditional weapons such as Swords. Intergalactic trade also brought weapons such as very modern guns mixing with swords and arrows. An early incarnation of ships resembling Tie Fighters was introduced in other areas of space as Mondain's power grew to such a large extent. It was through time travel that Mondain allies with Emperor Palpatine from Universe One. It was thanks to the presence of time travellers and explains the contact between the cultures and colonization of other worlds(Ultima).\n\nMondain took on an apprentice and lover named Minax. The two conceived a son named Exodus. For the first time, a being known as the Stranger appeared in this world through the Moon Gate portals like those who brought Garriott to Earth. The Stranger was originally known by that name and later the Avatar, while in Britannia he had no other name just as Garriott became Lord British. His name on Earth, however, was Noah Antwiler. He would late become an internet Reviewer and share the common bad luck of being forced to battle characters from the games he would review, including a series of games based on the events he would partake in adapted by James Halliday. The portal(also known as the Siege Perilous and the Moon Gates) had an odd effect. Time passed differently often decades or centuries on Earth 6, though this was balanced out by the fact that the presence of magic and advanced technology meant age was slowed down. Still Noah Antwiler, for now was simply \"The Stranger,\" opposed Mondain and was granted a Time Machine from an unknown individual. It was later discovered that the Time Machine was a TARDIS gifted by a member of the Time Lord, simply referring to himself as \"The Time Lord\". Given Mondain's intergalactic Empire, he had chosen to get involved(He is largely theorized to be this universe's incarnation of The Doctor,)(Ultima).\n\nThe lands would face a massive cataclysm when Mondain was killed by the Stranger. Contact between the civilizations was lost (Ultima).\n\nThe Lands of the Dark Unknown(Greece): The land fell into the sea and darkness. An entity known as the Guardian invaded this world, killing the Olympians, possibly aided by the people of the land losing faith in their deities after the Crisis. The Guardian was the dark counterpart of the Stranger and appeared in the land when he did. The Guardian the new god of the land, which he renamed Pagan (Ultima).\n\nThe Land of the Feudal Lords(Japan) were isolated and became known as the Tokuno Islands (Ultima).\n\nThe Lands of Danger and Despair(Ireland): Shamino was intended to marry the daughter of the King of the White Dragon, Beatrix, but would leave to help battle Mondain, promising to return. He would, but far far later. As the land was sundered, Goblins attacked it and started a bloody war. Beatrix died of a broken heart and in rage, the King of White Dragon went on a rampage, killing everyone in the castle before committing suicide, leaving no royal family. The land was lost until the arrival of three serpents. The Red Chaos Serpent, the Blue Order Serpent and the Great Earth Serpent. The Earth Serpent kept the other two in balance. Their worshippers became the Ophidians and were readily accepted. Shrines and temples were constructed and new cities such as Skullcrusher and Spinebreaker. The land became known as Serpent Isle (Ultima).\n\nC.2,700 B.C.E.\n\nSumer: At an unknown date early in his career, Bartimaeus is responsible for a great flood, which occurs when he builds a dam across the Euphrates river for a bet. Many houses between Ur and Shuruppak are apparently inundated, though in Bartimaeus’s view the incident has been subsequently ‘over-reported’(The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\nC.2,600 B.C.E.\n\nUruk, Sumer: Reign of King Gilgamesh. The great king Gilgamesh is Bartimaeus’s first named master. Bartimaeus serves him in the guise of a youthful spear-carrier, and helps him defeat the giant Humbaba. Around this time Bartimaeus rebuilds the walls of Uruk, a feat that for 4,500 years remains one of his proudest boasts. Ever afterwards ‘Bartimaeus of Uruk’ is his favoured title (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n2,551 B.C.E.\n\nEgypt: Khufu becomes pharaoh of Egypt. Bartimaeus is involved in construction of Khufu’s great pyramid, and suspects Faquarl’s involvement when a bit of it falls on him(The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\nC.2,400 B.C.E.\n\nUr, Sumer: Possibly around this time, Bartimaeus is enslaved by the terrible Old Priestess of Ur, who conducts murderous rituals involving the sacrifice of animals and servants. The Priestess longs for immortality, and works her magicians to death to get it. Her obsession results in the creation of the dreadful Circlet of Harms and the final downfall of the Old Priestess. Bart buries her at last in a lead-lined tomb – despite her muffled protests (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\nC.2,300 B.C.E.\n\nAkkad: Around this time, Bartimaeus serves King Sargon the Great of Akkad, aka ‘Old Scowler’ (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\nC.2,050 B.C.E.\n\nEridu, Sumer: The City of Eridu, ‘the bone-white city’, reaches the zenith of its power. Bartimaeus was probably present there around this time (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n2,000 B.C.E.\n\nThe first recorded use of werewolves in warfare by Lycaon of Arcadia happened this year(The Bartimaeus Trilogy)(Lycaon of Arcadia is best known for feeding his son to the Gods Of Olympus. Here however he is a refugee from thise who fled the sinking of Greece and the death of the Olympians means he's in no position to make such a sacrifice.\n\nC.1,792 B.C.E.\n\nBabylon: The reign of King Hammurabi begins. Hammurabi conquers most of Mesopotamia. Bart is among his troops, who sing rude songs about Hammurabi in his honour. The king joins in the choruses(The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\nC.1,500s B.C.E.\n\nJericho, Canaan: Bartimaeus possibly works on the walls of Jericho around this time. According to the djinni Queezle, Bartimaeus is responsible for their flimsy construction(The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n1,500 B.C.E.\n\nAtlantis: A Mycenaean outpost on Santorini, is destroyed in this year by a powerful spirit. Bartimaeus hears the explosion hundreds of miles away in the Egyptian delta (The Bartimaeus Trilogy)(This seems to be the only Atlantis to exist in this universe).\n\n1,478 B.C.E.\n\nEgypt: Bartimaeus is a member of Tuthmosis III’s army, allegedly the greatest body of spirits ever assembled (The Bartimaeus Trilogy)(Due to the different spelling Tuthmosis III is closely a parallel to Thutmose III).\n\n1,423 B.C.E.\n\nDue to Minax's manipulations, namely the cataclysm and the loss of contact with most of the lands, a magic spell caused human civilization to disappear everywhere except for Britain and Italy. Britain remained ruled over by Lord British, and Le Jester, a small settlement in northern Africa With the normal flow of time disrupted by the enchantress, the outcroppings of ancient civilization shifted positions. Besides the only civilization under Lord British and Le Jester, a dungeon existed in the northern mountains of Greenland, and a tower had been erected on the east coast of South America.\n\nAt this time, a great deal of anachronistic technology was still available to the populace, thanks to the time doors and time travelers from the future. Anachronisms from the future including Lightsabers(called light swords) and phasers being available, and computer programmers discussing their trade idly in public.\n\nThe Stranger would defeat Minax, causing the world to be altered. When the time doors collapsed, everything that came out from them was sucked back and returned to their original time zones. This includes time travelers, future technology, and also Minax's minions (Ultima II).\n\n1,403 B.C.E.\n\n20 years after Minax's defeat, the Isle of Fire rose out of the Sea as Molten Lava spewed from underwater volcanoes. Monsters began attacking settlements and a fleet of Pirate ships swept across the sea. At Serpent Isle, war broke out known as the War of imbalance between the worshippers of the two serpents. In the land of Lord British, a ship was found devoid of crew with the word Exodus written in blood on the deck. In response, Lord British sent out several vehicles to map the land. \"The Time Lord\" took on the identity of the cartographer Hawkwind when most ships did not return. he discovered the Moongates and how they worked but was attacked and wounded outside Castle Britannia before relaying this information. Shamino was driven insane when he visited the Castle of Fire on the Isle of Fire. The Stranger returned to battle Exodus with the aid of the Time Lord. Exodus was slain, his death causing another cataclysm. After a final battle on Bloody Plains, the forces of Exodus were purged from the land.(Ultima III).\n\nAge of Enlightenment(1,403 B.C.E.-200 A.D.)[]\n\nBritannia(British Isles): Lord British established the Great Council. One of their first acts was to use magic to learn of the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom from the Gargoyles(the closest Earth One equivalent being the Grimorum Arcanorum). The book spoke of the Eight Virtues and could only be accessed by someone who met the requirements of the Avatar. In order to improve the book, the Magus had travelled far and wide and learned of the ancient tales of the Avatar of Mu. Lord British began to enforce these Eight virtues within his own people. Different people would form their own Virtues based on these teachings such as the Erstam people and they would leave Britannia, arriving in the Serpent Isles. Lord British built three shrines to the Principles on the Isle of Fire, but the Gargoyles, equipped with some magic from the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom, summoned the spirits of Mondain, Minax and Exodus to inhabit the three shrines and cause the Isle of Fire to sink into the sea. At around the same time Demons destroyed the city of Magincia due to their pride and there being no Christianity in this universe to repeal them. Lord British used this to enforce the idea that Magincia was destroyed for breaking away from the Virtues. The Stranger returned to Britannia to prevent damage caused by the evil within Mondain's skull, which he would destroy by throwing into the Stygian Abyss. The Stranger then went on a quest to achieve the Eight Virtues and was able to discover the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom. Lord British therefore promoted him as the reincarnation of the Avatar of ancient Mu and the name caught on. The Stranger forever more became known as the Avatar(Ultima IV).\n\nC.1,350 B.C.E.\n\nEgypt: Akhenaten and Nefertiti rule Egypt. Bartimaeus is closely associated with the heretic pharaoh and his wife around this time, and seems to be a favourite of Nefertiti in particular. Bartimaeus claims to have personally delivered the anklet to her. A few years later he is involved in the overthrow of Akhenaten, a coup engineered by the High Priests of Ra, and for this Nefertiti never forgives him (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n1,279 B.C.E.\n\nEgypt: Reign of Rameses the Great begins. Bartimaeus works hard for Rameses II, whom he remembers later as a grandiose and pockmarked ruler. It may be during this time that he rebuilds the walls of Karnak, another of his favourite boasts (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n1,274 B.C.E.\n\nBattle of Qadesh between Egyptians and the Hittites, which Rameses wins. Bartimaeus and Faquarl take part in this battle. Two hundred years later, the battlefield is still a blackened waste, a field of bones (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\nC.1200 B.C.E.\n\nFall of Troy: Faquarl claims to have been present on this occasion, and to have given Odysseus the idea for the Trojan Horse. Bartimaeus is sceptical, but can’t prove anything, as he was in Egypt at the time. Around this time Faquarl is in his pomp, known far and wide as Faquarl of Sparta, scourge of the Aegean. Bartimaeus recalls him as a ‘slate-black giant crushing hoplite armies beneath [his] heels (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\nIn Anatolia, then a region of Troade, The land is being raided by the Ahhiya. A time traveller named Lyca arrives. In the future she comes from, Humanity, lives underground as an alien race known as the Triacanto rules the surface, resembling a massive insect swarm. Lyca is a modified human. The future civilization discovered the Triacanto gestated within humans for centuries before emerging by bursting out of humans like trees and have sent Lyca back to find a target gestating the Triacanto (dubbed the Spiromorph) and kill them, changing history by preventing the gestation. The Future Society acknowledges that this will create an alternate universe but also that it will likely erase their time from existence. Also sent back is a Insectoid creature called a Miriapode, which she must find and bond with to gain knowledge of the time period she is in. She is also granted a guide, a being only she can see which is a mix of several animals but largely a dog with catlike claws and big enough to ride to meet several needs which she dubs \"Dark One\". Due to the method of time travel being made up of obsolete technology salvaged by Skynet, Lyca arrives in every time period naked. The travels are also exhausting and she will succumb to narcolepsy for long stretches of time.\n\nAfter finding the Miriapode, Lilith learns she is in Troy just prior to its fall. Lyca poses as an Amazon from Themyscira sent there to fight(not actually uncommon as Wonder Woman did so herself on Earth One, fighting in the Trojan War, but the Amazons were lost with the Olympians when Themyscira sank along with the rest of Greece, though many rumors of surviving Amazons persisted). She learns her target is in the City of Wilusa which is to be sieged by Akireu(Earth 6's Achillies), though he refuses. Lyca then arrives and offers to join the Greeks, proving her worth by fighting and disarming her opponent. She falls due to narcolespy and awakens during a battle, during which a friend of Akireu is killed by the Prince of the Trojans, spurring him to fight. Searching to kill the Triacanto herself to ensure its death, she prevents Akireu from killing a man, making him vow revenge. The Siege of Troy begins with the Trojan Horse instead being a large battering ram that breaches the walls. Lyca helps rescue survivors but finds the Triacanto among them. She separates and then murders the host, which the man's son witnesses, believing Lyca is Lilitu, or the Demon Lilith. Akireu attacked Lyca along with his men. She fought back and blinded Akireu by gouging out his eyes(because the Olympians were killed by the Guardians and Greece sank, Achillies of this world never received invincibility from the River Styx). Lyca then fought Faquarl and was defeated, passing out and being dragged away by the Dark One but was seen flying over the city, which the Greeks took as a sign of their victory. Upon awakening and preparing to be sent to another time, Lyca decided to take the name Lilith. Akireu was forced to give up fighting due to is injury but chose to return to his musical talents of singing and playing the lyre. Homer still wrote the Iliad, which now included mention of Lyca as Athena, gouging out the eyes of Achillies to teach him humility(Lilith)(Its likely Brutus of Troy perished in the Fall of Troy, though his significant role he had on Earth One is not heeded with Britannia already existing. Bion, later Orlando likely does not exist as she was born Greek. If she does exist she is in Pagan and never gained immortality).\n\n1,170 B.C.E.\n\nEgypt: Bartimaeus is involved in Rameses III’s campaigns against the Sea Peoples, and helps drive them from Egyptian soil (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n970s-940s B.C.E.\n\nIsrael: Solomon the Great is king of Israel. Solomon wields great power with his magic ring, one of the most powerful talismans of all time. Bart is one of many spirit slaves working for Solomon’s magicians, and he undertakes much construction work in Jerusalem (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n950 B.C.E.\n\nBartimaeus briefly works on Solomon’s Temple, before taking a leading part in ‘that uncomfortable business of Solomon’s magic ring,’ in which Jerusalem is almost destroyed. Bart seems slightly equivocal about the whole affair in later years, but is more than happy to boast of having spoken with Solomon (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n753 B.C.E.\n\nRome is founded(Shows up in several works set on this Earth).\n\nC.700 B.C.E.\n\nBattle of Al-Arish: One of the most destructive battles of the ancient world, ‘when the pharaoh drove back the Assyrian army from Egyptian soil’.

Their relationship goes rapidly downhill from here (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\nC.600 B.C.E.\n\nMedia: Around this time Bartimaeus works for the Median Magi, the first magicians to start the (afterwards typical) solitary master-apprentice structure (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\nC.550 – 330 B.C.E.\n\nPersepolis, Persia: Bartimaeus works for the Persians during this period, probably under the by-name Sakhr al-Jinni.

She is later reported to have drowned in a river(Chinese Mythology, Xi Shi is mentioned in Lilith).\n\n440 B.C.E.\n\nAthens, Greece: The magician Phidias builds the Parthenon with the help of the marid, Atlas. Bartimaeus does not specifically state he was there, but he seems to know a fair bit about it (The Bartimaeus Trilogy)(The Parthenon on this Earth is not built in Greece due to it sinking and becoming Pagan).\n\nC. 220 B.C.E.\n\nSyracuse, Sicily: Around now, Bartimaeus allegedly meets and gives helpful advice to Archimedes (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n200s B.C.E.\n\nRome/Carthage: Bart meets the afrit Naeryan during the Scipio campaigns (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n126 B.C.E.\n\nEgypt, Alexandria: Bartimaeus meets Ptolemy. Bartimaeus, now known by his Egyptian byname, ‘Rekhyt’, is employed by the magician Ptolemy and quickly becomes his friend. For two brief years Ptolemy devotes himself to understanding spirits. He sends Bart and his other djinn – Affa, Penrenutet and Teti – out to help the ordinary people with their problems. Ptolemy becomes popular, and arouses the resentment of his cousin, the Egyptian king (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n125 B.C.E.\n\nAssassins make an attempt on Ptolemy’s life. Bartimaeus kills them (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n124 B.C.E.\n\nPtolemy sends Bart to fight against Barbary pirates and desert raiders. He fights against the jackal-headed djinni Jabor, and takes part in the Battle of the Cataracts. Afterwards, Ptolemy gives Bartimaeus a week off – his first experience of pure free will on Earth. Ptolemy visits the Other Place and is seriously weakened. Later that year Ptolemy is assassinated by Roman magicians. Affa, Penrenutet and Teti are also killed. Bartimaeus survives(The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n55 B.C.E.\n\nJulius Caesar launches an invasion of Britannia. The Gallic expedition served as a record of fighting at the time of the \"Gallic War\" is all that he himself wrote. Like on Earth One, Caesar fails to take a small Gaulish village which invented a magic potion. Caesar's invasion of Britannia fails miserably as Italy lacks the magical prowess of Britannia (Code Geass).\n\n54 B.C.E.\n\nJulius Caesar attempts a second invasion of Britannia. This time equipped with sorcerers of his own. His forces are once again defeated. Julius Caesar is killed(Code Geass). Rome plunges into Civil War.\n\n7 B.C.E.\n\nAugustus Caesar visits Britannia to forge an alliance to end the Roman Civil War. While there he gets an Irish woman of the O Ceallaigh clan pregnant. August Caesar takes his pregnant Irish Wife back with him to Rome. The child is born Ceallaigh Caesar (A take on an infamously bad fanfiction Kelly the Roman Warrior. Due to butterflies. This is one of the few universes where an element of the stories could actually happen, Boudicca surviving. Ceallaigh is a rough translation of the name Kelly which has irish origins to the old language).\n\n6 B.C.E.\n\nAugustus Caesar's Irish wife and mother of Ceallaigh Caesar and Warrior in her own right is killed in an invasion during the roman civil war(Kelly the Roman Warrior).\n\n0 A.D.\n\nRome: Around this time, Bart befriends Julia, a Vestal Virgin, with whom he watches chariot races at the Circus Maximus. He meets the afrit Naeryan again (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n1. C.E.\n\nAfter a prolonged Roman Civil War, Augustus takes over as the Emperor of Rome. Since Lord British had a hand in his rise to power through an alliance, Augustus makes peace with Britannia. Lord British is given the honorary titled of King Alwin I(Code Geass, Why not earlier? Well for the most part other dates in the Timeline seem to line up the Britannian Calendar with the Gregorian Calendar).\n\nJesus Christ is born(mentioned in several works).\n\n10 C.E.\n\nDue to his distrust of the Gargoyles(harbored by his theft of the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom). Lord British refuses to allow Gargoyles to set foot in Britannia. They therefore remain largely in the Roman Empire.\n\n12 C.E.\n\nA 19 year old Ceallaigh Caesar is living in Rome when Godzilla bursts from the Earth, causing \"The Great Fire of Rome\". Ceallaigh escapes the fire and begins searching for her father. With the aid of a guardian spirit in the shape of an Elk she is taken to a witch and told to search for objects. This includes helping a Vampire overthrow a rival who took his castle. Ceallaigh recruits a series of monsters including the vampire, and the mummy of Tutankhensetamun during the quest to obtain the objects. She soon discovered that Augustus Caesar had been taken to the underworld by Hades(known as Pluto to the Romans, who had escaped the fall of Greece by the Guardians), who was seeking to invade Earth with the dead armies of Sauron as well as brainwashing Thor(who was not worshipped as a god on this Earth), Ceallaigh was granted the powers of the former Greek Gods and now Roman God Athena/Minerva and led a team of warriors into battle, vanquishing the army back to the underworld(Kelly the Roman Warrior. A so bad its good fanfiction. Possibly intentionally so. Due to Godzilla: Rage across Time, the King of Kaijus appearing this far back isn't implausible. Godzilla is now seen as a Kaiju awoken by the Atomic blast not created by it. While the Great Fire of Rome occurred in 64 AD, here it occurs in 12 C.E. which is a direct dating as the fanfiction was written in 2012 and stated to take place \"2000 years ago\". Several of the characters in the story are from existing works such as Dracula, Edward Cullen, Shrek, the Hulk. Most of these are removed due to not fitting in with the time period).\n\n32 C.E.\n\nEurope is threatened by a plague. Augustus Caesar is near death and training Ceallaigh Caesar to succeed him. When news of the plague reaches Rome, Ceallaigh assembles a team including the Vampire, Elrond, the Mummy Tutankhensetamun, a wizard(descendant of the Black family, as in Sirius Black), and Boudicca. They also travel to Gaul and recruit the aged Asterix and Obelix. They find that the undead Nergal is unleashing the plague while allied with Sauron. Augustus Caesar betrays the group to wipe out Gaul and Britannia, being granted the powers of Zeus. In the end he turns against Nergal and both are destroyed but only Ceallaigh Caesar and Boudicca survive, the two becoming married(Kelly the Roman Warrior II).\n\n33 C.E.\n\nJesus Christ is crucified(mentioned in several works).\n\n42 C.E.\n\nA Kryptonian warrior arrives in Carthage and attempts to lead them against Rome and Britannia, but is defeated by Ceallaigh using the powers of the gods(Kelly the Roman Warrior III).\n\n60 A.D.\n\nThe Great Council of Britannia conjured a spell to obtain the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom, succeeding and sending the Gargoyles into panic. They would be punished by Rome for their failure in protecting the book and cast out, forcing them to live largely underground or risk destruction or discovery from either Britannia or Rome. Taking the book caused great geological instability, causing a crack to open up and releasing horrible monsters. This resulted in the Britannian council sealing the Eight Dungeons, and a drought that saw Lake Generosity dry up. Lord British also wrote the Book of Lore, a 54 page history of Britannia himself. Another man from Earth one, a knight named Segallion, entered Britannia through a moon gate, he would eventually become a pirate and live a much quieter life than either Lord British or the Avatar did(Ultima)\n\nThis era was peaceful. The new Religion prospered with the formation of Empath Abbey and its monks and the ghosts of Magincia were laid to rest, leading to the town to be recolonized by people from Vesper as New Magincia. A new age of exploration began, though wrought with trouble, including Captain Johnne's ship being lost in a whirlpool, leading to him being possessed by the beings known as the Shadowlords, shards from the Gem of Immortality gained sentience, and killing his crew. It was discovered that the whirlpool led to the Underworld and Lord British personally led an expedition through the Maelstrom, leaving his trusted advisor Lord Blackthorn in charge(Ultima V).\n\n129 A.D.\n\nSun Wukong, the Monkey King, goes on a rampage in Heaven but is defeated by Buddha and imprisoned for 500 years(Journey to the West)(Lilith impersonates him from 1937-1938)(Lilith).\n\n137 A.D.\n\nBlackthorn was corrupted by the Shadowlords and seized power in 137 AD. Lord Blackthorn instituted Martial Law and enacted more repressive versions of the Code of Virtue. Lord British, while trapped in the Underworld befriended what he believed to be a Demon, but was actually a Gargoyle. The Gargoyles had taken to Satanic Worship and had been changed to resemble Demons named Sin'Vraal(Ultima V).\n\n139 A.D.\n\nThe Avatar was summoned back in 139 AD and destroyed the Shadowlords and rescued Lord British. Lord Blackthorn, though brainwashed, was exiled to Serpent Isles. The Underworld in actuality the realm of the Gargoyles, began to collapse.\n\nExploration resumed with a ship piloted by a Captain Hawkins was also lost at sea in a mutiny, the crew falling to piracy. Captain Johne had another more successful trip, even befriending a Gargoyle named Beh Lem. The collapse of the Underworld led to a Gargoyle-Britannia war. The wizard Sutek, a worshipper of Set, went insane and began to perform experiments, creating animal hybrids. He would not be the only one as spellcasters began to go insane. The island of Bordermarch was sunk. The Gargoyle religions proclaimed the existence of an ancient prophecy that the end of the world would come when the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom was stolen and that the thief would bring the end of the world as An Bal Sil Fer(The False Prophet). In reality this prophecy was fake, created to get the Gargoyles to attack and kill the Avatar(Ultima V).\n\n161 A.D.\n\nThe Gargoyles summoned the Avatar to attempt to sacrifice him but he was rescued. The Avatar then learned of the disagreement over the Codex and sent it into a void where it could only be read if both races performed a ritual to do so, together, leading to a stalemate in the war in 161 AD. Some Gargoyles settled in certain areas. One group refused to make peace and became a band that was reformed by the warrior Dupre to follow the Virtues, taking the name \"The Locusts\"(Ultima VI).\n\n173 A.D.\n\nEvil began to return, the first sign of this was in 173 AD when the monk Sir Arthur Cabirus attempted to find a new town on the isle of the Avatar. The Spellcaster Horace, half mad, attempted to gain immortality but transformed himself into an undead Lich, creating a Dark Tower on the island of Skara Brae. An alchemist named Caine attempted to find a way to trap Horace but due to the inepitude of the town Mayor, Forsythe, the formula exploded, killing everyone in the town instantly. The land of Stonegate was occupied by a group of wingless gargoyles that were massacred by Mayor of Jhelom, Lord Velemon to become his private estate(Ultima).\n\n192 A.D.\n\nLilith arrives in this era in Rome and become a gladiator, saving the life of Emperor Commodus from an assassination as the Gladiator Narcissus is the Triacanto bearer. Lilith kills Narcissus. After she disappears Lilith becomes a figure of worship in Roman Mythology(Lilith).\n\n199 A.D.\n\nThe ship \"Anne's Revenge' was constructed by shipwright of New Magincia Alluria(Ultima)(the name being shared with Blackbeard's ship is possibly conicidence, it most likely being named after another Anne).\n\n207 A.D.\n\nA white X-Ray Potion was created that caused controversy in a peeping tom case. An even \"Whiter\" light potion took its place(Ultima).\n\n210 A.D.\n\nSir Arthur Cabirus died and his Abyssal Colony fell apart. Baron Almric sealed off the isle but his daughter was abducted under the orders of the wizard Tybal, the Avatar, appearing in her room at the time of the kidnapping, and was sent to rescue her, succeeding and killing Tybal in the Stygian Abyss(Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss).\n\nAge of Armaggedon(210 A.D.-586 A.D.)[]\n\nBrittania entered a period of several minor wars, leading to the rise of the fellowship, a group founded by Batlin and Siblings Abraham and Elizabeth which included Burnside, mayor of Minoc(Ultima).\n\n216\n\nGalen of Pergamon dies(Twig).\n\n300s-800s\n\nYucatán Peninsula, Central America: The Mayan civilization reaches its height during this period. At some time during these centuries Bartimaeus becomes active in Yucatán, often employing his ‘winged serpent with silver feathers’ guise (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n341 A.D.\n\nThe Fellowship was officially recognized. The Britannian Mining Company(BMC), was also founded. However as Britannia grew, a new threat emerged in the form of the Guardian, who defeated and imprisoned the Time Lord(Ultima VII).\n\n362 A.D.\n\nThe Avatar returned to the land, discovering the Fellowship was under the influence of the Guardian, killing its members, including the Pirate Hook and preventing the Guardian from entering the world in 362 AD. The Avatar also met the Cyclops Iskander Ironheart, the Cyclops race prospering underground. Batlin, a conspirator of the Guardian, fled to Serpent Isle, where the Avatar and his companions traveled(Ultima VII).\n\n365 A.D.\n\nThe Avatar expedition to Serpent Isle found that the infighting had caused an imbalance between the three Serpents representing Order and Chaos. Balance is restored at the cost of the Avatar's companion Dupre. The Guardian transported him to the world of Pagan(Ultima VII: Part Two).\n\n386 A.D. or 586 A.D.\n\nTimed passed differently in Pagan and it is unclear when the Avatar returned, though it is often sited as either 386 AD or 586 AD. In the absence of the Avatar, the Guardian devastated Britannia, including nearly wiping out the Gargoyle population and most of the supernatural creatures of the land. The Avatar used the spell of Armaggedon to destroy the Guardian, but seemingly at the cost of his own life. In reality, the Avatar and the Guardian both survived. The Avatar returned to Earth, depowered and unable to return to Earth 6, the Guardian was now sealed off from Britannia and now faced difficulty attacking Earth. And so the Era of the Avatar came to an end. The World of Britannia seemed destroyed, but as time would show, It would live again. For now the Nation fell into a dark age that resulted in much of its history being lost(Ultima VIII and Ultima IX).\n\nVikings will eventually occupy most of the British Isles, more so than on Earth One and Real Life(which occurred in 865) due to the devastation from the final battle of Britannia as opposed to the Romans pulling out of the country.\n\nC.400s\n\nTollan, Central America: The Toltec civilization is at its height. Bartimaeus possibly fights the entity Tlaloc of Tollan around this time(The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n440s\n\nSyria: Hairy ascetics, known as stylites, spend years perched atop pillars as acts of extreme spiritual devotion. To prove their faith they summon djinn to beguile them with temptations. Bartimaeus doesn’t bother with temptations, but tickles them until they fall off (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n475\n\nFall of Rome: The last Western Emperor, Romulus Augustulus, falls to revolution among the people and barbarian invasion. Bartimaeus apparently hides in the catacombs below Rome during the invasion, but is spotted by two foliots who pass on the news to Faquarl (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n500s\n\nBartimaeus spends much of the 6th Century AD in an old sesame-oil jar, corked with wax, bobbing in the Red Sea.

He free Sun Wukong, who accompanies him, along with a piglike creature named Zhu Wuneng, and the river spirit Sha Wujing (Journey to the West, included as Lilith impersonates Sun Wukong, Lilith)\n\n800\n\nAgrabah: With the reign of the great caliph-magician Haroun al-Rashid, the Arab Empire is at its peak. Agrabah is the greatest city in the world and remains so for more than 100 years. Bartimaeus is employed by splendid Arab magicians in Agrabah and Basra during this period. He witnesses wonders and tragedies, including the love story of Asmoral and Ianna, and performs many feats, such as hunting for Rocs’ eggs, and building palaces on clouds or underwater (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\nC.850s\n\nAround this time Bartimaeus is employed by the formidable magician Zarbustibal of Yemen, who is ‘renowned about the Red Sea for his hook nose and protruding warts’(The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n1000\n\nWest Greenland: Lilith appears in this time and is found by an expedition led by Liefr Erikkson. Her target visits the Campsite and Lilith attacks him at night but fails to kill him. His group retreats, Lilith frames the group for stealing Lief's Cross and gives chase. Lilith constructs a modern map and leaves them to North America where they find and kill the target, recovering Liefr Erikkson's cross. Lilith and Erikkson have a romantic relationship that is recorded in history. The Map Lillith made survived into the present but is dismissed as a hoax by modern historian despite carbon dating confirming its authenticity(Lilith).\n\n1173\n\nPisa, Italy: Construction begins on the Tower of Pisa. Bartimaeus claims to have been consulted about the building work, but his advice isn’t taken(The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n1189\n\nMinamoto no Yoshitsune along with her wife Princess Katsura-Nomae are executed(Seen in Lilith in a play though Ichikawa Danjuro V interrupts the execution, however, he was playing an exaggerated version of himself, who wasn't even born yet. Lilith).\n\nRichard I Plantagenet(The line still existing due to being of French origin, though Richard having different parents) occupies portions of the British Isles(There was no William the Conqueror in this universe due to the different circumstances).\n\n1199\n\nBy this time, the former Britannia has recovered under King Richard Plantagenet, a Frenchman who established a Kingdom there, becoming known as Richard the Lionheart. He then attempts to conquer France to unite both Kingdoms. Richard the Lionheart is hit by a crossbow bolt at the Siege of Chaluz, but survives the wound, the resulting infection, and fever(Lord Darcy)(King Richard the Lionheart here is the first Plantagenet King of England due to the Dark Age caused by the Fall of Britannia).\n\nC.1200\n\nNorth America: Around this time, Bartimaeus’s contact with northern native Americans begins, and continues off and on for several hundred years. It appears to be one of his happier associations, and he enjoys the freedom of the wilderness. At some point he speaks with Hiawatha, though the date is unknown. He is particularly linked to the Algonquin peoples (to whom he is known as Wakonda) and the Iroquois, and frequently adopts the guise of a sinister Crow-man, to awe the people of the plains (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n1200s –1400s\n\nGreat Matobo, Southern Africa: The city of Great Matobo(Zimbabwe) is continuously built between the 11th and 15th Centuries, when it is abandoned. Under the name N’gorso the Mighty, Bartimaeus works here for a time, as does Faquarl. Although many details are obscure, Bartimaeus is certainly present during its decline in the 1450s, when he watches as ‘the stones fell and the jackals fed on its people’. It may be during this period that he fights with ‘clever Tchue of the Kalahari’ (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n1212\n\nJuly 16: The Moors won the battle of Navas de Tolosa on the Iberian peninsula. Thus Spain was unable to become unified, owing to the survival of an Islamic presence in its territory clashing with its Catholic territory(Tunnel Through the Deeps).\n\n1215\n\nJune 15: The last of the French kings, presumably Philip II, is killed by Richard the Lionheart(Lord Darcy). The Magna Carta Libertatum is signed by Richard the Lionheart(Twig) The Angevin Empire is formed(named after Angevin, the region of France from which the Plantagenets come from, uniting large portions of the British Isles and France(Lord Darcy).\n\n1216\n\nRichard the Lionheart's brother John dies in exile(Lord Darcy).\n\n1219\n\nRichard the Lionheart dies. His nephew Arthur (son of Geoffrey of Brittany) becomes king at the age of 32(Lord Darcy)(Arthur in universe was often confused for the Mythical King Arthur, here however he is the closest equivalent that exists as the Britannia period prevented a true King Arthur from rising).\n\n12??\n\nDuring Arthur's reign, Sir Hilary of Walsingham outlines the theory and mathematics of magic(Lord Darcy).\n\n12??-1415\n\nAfter Arthur, A long line of Kings in the Plantagenet line reign over the Angevin Empire, by 1415, there have been five Kings named Henry Plantagenet.\n\n1227\n\nMongolia: Death of the warlord, Genghis Khan. Bartimaeus and Faquarl engineer it by putting poison grapes in his tent(While Vandal Savage is Genghis Khan, the magic being used might actually succeed in killing him for good here) (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n1271-1295\n\nMarco Polo journeyed further into the East, reaching Japan and discovered the nation's large deposit of sakuradite(This timeline's name for the\"Philosopher's Stone\" due to it later being found in Japan)(Code Geass)(Given its rarity, its possible Sakuradite is actually from The world of Fullmetal Alchemist and failed to be transported through the Moon Gates when many items were sucked in, as they appear in The British Isles, Japan, and Greece, but Greece had been lost. The other two are confirmed locations for it).\n\n1357\n\nPrague, Holy Roman Empire: Bartimaeus is involved in the construction of the Stone Bridge over the Vltava River. Lots are drawn as to who will guard it; Bartimaeus’ associate Humphrey loses and is still entombed within (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n14th-15th Century\n\nBritish Isles: Sakuradite was discovered near Stonehenge. The scarcity of sakuradite impeded the research to turn it into a viable energy source(Code Geass)(Why it wasn't found before makes a bit more sense given the Dark Ages The British Isles went through after the fall of Britannia).\n\nC.C. is born(Code Geass)(While not confirmed her birth name is suggested to be Yuki Shiroi, which is Snow White in Japanese. This suggests that C.C. is Earth 6's version of Snow White.

Nouda the Terrible is involved in the massacres (The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n1400s\n\nCentral America: Between 1325 and 1520 the Aztec Civilization is at its height. During this time Bartimaeus returns to the region, possibly in his plumed serpent incarnation. He afterwards boasts about being really good at the Aztec ballgame(The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\nHenry V Plantagenet(instead of Lancaster as one Earth One) ascends to the throne. He is seen as weak and immature, and this prompts a rebellion in France(The Inclusion of Megamorphs means a Henry V and a battle of agincourt must exist even though the circumstances are different).\n\n1415\n\nIn order to silence Berryman, who is quoting William Shakespeare's Henry V, The alien Yeerk Visser Four travels to 1415 in order to kill Henry V during the Battle of Agincourt. The Animorphs agree to chase the Yeerk. They are immediately transported to fifteenth century France. Marco realizes that the lice-ridden and pockmarked humans of the fifteenth century would make it easier to spot Visser Four's host body, and manages to spot the Visser posing as an English archer. However, when attempting to kill Henry V with an arrow, the arrow is intercepted by Tobias, alerting the Visser to the fact that the \"Andalite bandits\" are chasing him. Marco, Rachel and Cassie are nearly killed in the war among the English and the French, but are saved by Tobias and Jake, with Tobias in Hork-Bajir morph and Jake having acquired and morphed one of the French war horses. Ax chases the fleeing Visser through the air in his northern harrier morph but is forced to demorph, igniting the wrath of pitchfork-wielding citizens. Tobias and Jake come to his rescue, with Tobias and Ax storming into the church where the Visser has fled. Tobias chases him to the bell tower, where he has hidden the Time Matrix, but the former Visser Four escapes, fleeing to the Delmarva crossing in Trenton, New Guersey(Megamorphs #3: Elfangor's Secret)(The inclusion of this event requires a Henry V to still exist).\n\nKing Henry V is removed from power and replaced by King Harold I, who quells the rebellion in France. He then continues to expand the territory. The William Shakespeare play will paint Henry V as a tragic hero as a result of this different history.\n\n1420\n\nHarold I makes the last addition to the Angevin Empire in Europe(Lord Darcy).\n\n1420-1550s\n\nDuring this time many Plantagenet Kings rule, including 3 Kings named Henry before reaching Queen Gloriana I(who survives due to being born of a union of the Faeries).\n\n1480 - 1540s\n\nGermany: The magician Johann Faustus is active. Bartimaeus serves him at some point(The Bartimaeus Trilogy).\n\n1497\n\nDue to being not unified, Spain could not finance the expedition of Christopher Columbus in 1492.

He brings her to a temple run by the Monk Benkei. Miyamoto instended to head to the Battle of Sekihagara to fight on the side of Toyotomi Nakamura(Toyotomi Hideyoshi) and under Ishido(Ishida Mitsunari) for the right of Toyotomi Yaemon(Toyotomi Hideyori)the son of Toyotomi Hideyoshi to rule. Lilith awakens and finds the miriapode but Takezo Miyamoto mistakes the creature latching onto her for an attack and kills it. She learns the target is Kobayakawa Hideaki. She meets and allies with Takezo Miyamoto, who she indirectly gives the name of Miyamoto Musashi(Lilith).\n\nOctober 21: The Battle of Sekigahara begins, Lilith sets off a distraction by blowing up the camp of Yoshi Torunaga, killing him, which brings Kobayakawa Hideaki towards where Toyotomi is. Lilith is attacked by Thistles but Takezo Miyamoto kills Hideaki. Lilith falls into a coma. The Shrine of the uncorrupted Maiden is built around her in Mino. Having injured his sword hand and motivated by his love for Lilith, Miyamoto Musashi becomes a monk known for his arts as a painter, sculptor, calligrapher, writer and poet (Lilith).\n\nThe Kampaku Government unifies the country. They outlaw any travel by wheels or horseback to better keep track of its subjects. They also shun Christianity as it conflicts with their philosophies. They began expansion largely due to the number of restless Samurai in the country, creating colonies, leading to the \"Seifuku Jidai\" or \"Period of Conquest\". They occupied Hun Chiu and the Islands of Formosa, but could not expand anymore due to the western presence elsewhere(Lilith).\n\n1600-1800\n\nNorth America: Bartimaeus is regularly summoned by the Native American shamans during this period(The Bartimaeus Trilogy)(This is largely to ensure their protection from both colonists and disease).\n\n17th Century\n\nQueen Gloriana I Plantagenet, who remained single throughout her life, bore a son, Henry IX. The potential fathers — Sir Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester; Sir Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex; and Sir Carl, Duke of Britannia — gained influence and power with this knowledge(Code Geass)(Sir Carl boasts of his heroic lineage to the lost Lord British. Queen Gloriana I is not a Tudor here due to the Plantagenet line surviving though she possesses Fairie heritage).\n\n1603\n\nHenry IX Plantagenet ascended to the throne after the death of his mother in 1603 a.t.b.(Code Geass) ( unlike Earth One, she was not assassinated by Prince Ludwig as he did not have the support of a unified Spain), starting the New Golden Age of the Tudor Dynasty\n\n1610\n\nHenry IX of the Angevin Empire survives an assassination attempt, and allows English inventor William Lee's knitting machine to spur an early industrial revolution in France(Shadows of Doubt)(In the source material the assassination was against Henry IV of France and his survival as the POD from our world).\n\n1615\n\nToyotomi Yaemon comes of age as Shogun. He dissolved the board of regents and moved the Capitol to Osaka, where his father Toyotomi Nakamura built his castle. Japan gains two capitols: Kyoto, where the Emperor resides, and Osaka where the Kampaku resides(Lilith).\n\n1625\n\nJapan gains a colony in the West Coast of America called \"Kyokuto No Kuni\" or \"Country of the Far East\". The ship provided largely by Dutch traders and originally heading to Mechicoe(Mexico), lands in what would have become San Francisco, which they call Kiri-Wan or \"Bay of the fog\". The First outpost is made after the discovery of Gold in the Sierra Nevada and Alta California. The outpost later takes the name of Tokyo, the Eastern Capitol (Lilith). Atrocities against the natives are largely prevented by Bartimaeus. This leads Japan to instead make efforts to treat the natives peacefully and treat Bartimaeus as a noble spirit and protector.\n\n1638\n\nLilith arrives, searching for the Triacanto on the Island of Hispaniola. She began searching for the Jewel of Orange, Ship of Pirate Captain Klaas Mansveldt. Mansveldt is the host and she learns he was captured and is to be hanged at Porto Bello. She leads the crew in attacking it to get to Mansveldt, setting off several gunpowder barrels and sacking it(30 years before Henry Morgan historically did so in 1668). She finds Mansveldt but he is accidentally killed and the Triacanto disappears(Lilith).\n\n1650\n\nOliver Cromwell's Protectorate overthrow the royal family, forcing many members to flee(Torch of the Protectorate) to France where they prepare to retake the British Isles.\n\n1658\n\nSeptember 3rd: Oliver Cromwell survives illness as the physician that treated him secretly had a magical healing knack(a Mutant ability) (Cromwell considered such knacks evil witchcraft)(The Tales of Alvin Maker). This date is becomes a significant day second only to the birth of Christ himself(Batman: Holy Terror).\n\n1668\n\nOliver Cromwell dies(Batman: Holy Terror). His name will become as great as those of Julius Caesar and Napoleon(Torch of the Protectorate). Facing decline, the Protectorate agrees to negotiate for the return of the king.\n\n1673-1675\n\nSometime during this point, Yoshizawa Ayame I is born. He will become known in Japan for his portrayal of female roles, even living as a woman outside of the theater(Real History but mentioned in Lilith).\n\n1686\n\nNicolas Steno dies(Twig).\n\n1688\n\nThe First Glorious Revolution, in which the unpopular Catholic King James II Plantagenet is ejected from the UK and replaced with William of Orange and his wife Mary, James' daughter.\n\nOn the other side of the world, pretty much the same thing happens in Ayutthaya, as King Narai (seen as an Angevin puppet) is overthrown and trade with Europeans - except the Dutch through the port of Mergui - is banned(based on real life but mentioned In Look to the West, altered to fit into this Earth, namely with the Angevin Empire).\n\n1689\n\nWilliam and Mary crowned as co-monarchs with the assent of Parliament. Parliament passes “An Act Declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subject and Settling the Succession of the Crown”, which sets down the British Bill of Rights and forms the basis of the British Constitution. Among other things, the Constitution severely limits the rights of Catholics, forbidding them the throne, the vote and public office(thanks to the influence of Oliver Cromwell's Puritans, who wished to outlaw Catholic practices) (based on real life but mentioned In Look to the West).\n\n1689-1691\n\nThe Williamite War, which results in the French and James II being ejected from Ireland and the British isles, and the country as well as the Isles are brought under effective British control. This brings an end to the Angevin Empire as King James comes to reside as King of France while William rules as King of the British Isles. The siege of Limerick ends the war, with the 'Flight of the Wild Geese' as many Irish nobles flee to Spain or France. The Treaty of Limerick guarantees Catholic rights, but is rejected by the Protestant-dominated Irish Parliament and Anti-Catholic laws are implemented, to much resentment among the Irish populace(based on real life but mentioned In Look to the West).\n\nThe New World Provinces of Lemoyne(Louisiana) and Canada offer to secede from the Angevin Empire and join the French.\n\n1694\n\nDeath of Queen Mary. All English judges wear black in mourning - and never stop. William rules as sole monarch(based on real life but mentioned In Look to the West).\n\n1700\n\nBy This point, Japan has a small colony in California, but aside from this North America colonies are fairly close to what they were at this time on Earth One. The Iberian country of Maestrazgo controls Mecheco(Mexico) as Nuova Maestrago, while the other Iberian country of Granada controls Columbiana( Florida), and Andes Mallorca(Columbia) which are named Nuova Granada or New Granada, The UK controls the 13 colonies of Earth One(evidence of History \"pushing to keep things on track as mentioned in Lilith, and parts of Central America, Japan controls California growing into the midwest(Kyokuto). the recently liberated France controls Lemoyne(Louisiana) and Canada, which are named Nuova Francia or New France).\n\n1700s\n\nKing James I of France turns down the offer of an Italian chemist to develop to first bacteriological weapon, the chemist is granted a pension for his silence(Twig)(in the source material Louis XIV was the King, the inclusion of the altered Look to the West mixed with the joint Angevin Empire changes this).\n\n1701\n\nKing James I of France dies. He is succeeded by his son Louis VIII Plantagenet.\n\nIn Britain, By the Act of Settlement, Parliament makes the heir to the throne the childless Anne Electress Sophia of Hanover, although she dies before Queen Anne and so her son becomes the heir destined to be George I (real life but mentioned In Look to the West).\n\n1701-1714\n\nThe War of the Maestrazgo(Spanish) Succession, aka Queen Anne's War and the First War of Supremacy. England/Great Britain, the Netherlands, Osterlich(Austria), Denmark, Neutralia(Portugal), Savoy and the Aragonese vs. France, Bavaria, Zubrowkan(Hungarian) rebels and the Castilians. The war is indecisive, with post-Bombhurst(Hapsburg) Maestrazgo(Spain) being unified and receiving a Bourbon monarch but not entering personal union with France as Louis VIII(XIV in the source material) had hoped. Territorial changes include: Britain receives Gibraltar and Minorca from Maestrazgo(Spain); Osterlich(Austria) receives Naples, Sardinia, Milan and the Maeztrazgo(Spanish) Netherlands (the future Flanders); Savoy receives Sicily; British colonies in North America receive French Acadia and France gives up claim to Newfoundland and Rupert's Land(based on real life but mentioned In Look to the West).\n\n1702\n\nDeath of William I of England after his horse stumbled over a molehill and he broke his collarbone, which became infected. Jacobites will ever after raise their glasses to 'the little gentleman in black velvet'. James I's second daughter Anne becomes Queen Regent. End of the personal union between England, Scotland and Ireland and the Dutch Republic, as Willem Friso (no close relation to William III) becomes claimant Stadtholder William IV of the Netherlands. However not all the Dutch provinces recognise this, and so the Netherlands is Stadtholderless until 1747(based on real life but mentioned In Look to the West).\n\n1707\n\nThe Act of Union is passed, which unifies England and Scotland as the Kingdom of Great Britain. The Act abolishes the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Royal Navy, and amalgamates them into their English counterparts.\n\nBirth of Carolus Linnaeus in Sweden (real life but mentioned In Look to the West).\n\n1709\n\nAttempted Jacobite rebellion under claimant James III Stuart(illegitimate son of exiled King James II) is defeated by Sir George Byng. Future rebellions will instead be managed by James' son Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie) (real life but mentioned In Look to the West).\n\n1713\n\nCharles VI, Holy Roman Emperor and Archduke of Austria, has no male heir. He issues a Pragmatic Sanction recognizing his daughter, Maria Theresa, as heir, and makes all the powers of Europe agree to it. However, it will transpire that quite a lot of them had their fingers crossed behind their backs (real life but mentioned In Look to the West).\n\n1714\n\nDeath of Queen Anne; George I, Elector of Hanover, becomes King of Great Britain and of Ireland. As he does not speak English, Parliament gains more real power during his reign.\n\nIn Virginia, the “First Wave of Germanna”, as German Protestant religious refugees from the Rhineland and the Palatinate settle there (real life but mentioned In Look to the West).\n\n1715\n\nDeath of Louis VIII(in real life Louis XIV); his great-grandson Louis, one of the few to survive a series of deaths in the French royal family in the late 17th century, becomes King Louis IX(in real life it was Louis XV) at the age of five, with Philippe, Duc d'Orléans as regent. A Jacobite Rebellion in Scotland, led by the Earl of Mar, is crushed by Marshal Wade. More minor outbreaks in Cornwall and Northern England are also subdued (based on real life but mentioned In Look to the West).\n\n1717\n\n“Second Wave of Germanna” as more German refugees settle in Virginia (real life but mentioned In Look to the West).\n\n1718\n\nPirates Blackbeard and Bartholomew \"Black Bart\" Roberts are killed(Mentioned in Lilith as having recently died. In Black Bart's case, it's much earlier as he died in 1722, while other events place the events the year Blackbeard died).\n\nLillith appears in this time and joins a Pirate Crew, finding the Triacanto in a British man named Wingfield. She tracks him down and kills him but the brutality of the kill turns the crew on her and she leaves after suggesting the crew go to Genosha(Madagascar), where Pirate Captain Henry Avery is said to have gone. They decide to head there(Lilith).\n\nThe Puckle Gun, an early cyclogun predecessor, is invented by James Puckle. Though technically impressive the technology is not viable at the time, though it will be cited as the beginnings of such weapons(real life but mentioned In Look to the West).\n\n1720\n\nThe South Sea Bubble. Excessive speculation in the South Sea Company causes an economic meltdown in the City of London. Parliament holds an inquiry and several prominent members of the current Whig government are forced to step down, leaving most of the power in the hands of Robert Walpole, the Paymaster of the Forces (real life but mentioned In Look to the West).\n\n1721\n\nRobert Walpole becomes the first Prime Minister of Britain, i.e. the first minister to dominate a government, although the term Prime Minister is considered vulgar and derisive for years afterward. His official titles are First Lord of the Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons, all united in one (real life but mentioned In Look to the West).\n\n1722:\n\nWilliamsburgh, Virginia, becomes the first city in Britain's North American colonies as it receives a royal charter (real life but mentioned In Look to the West).\n\nThe Exile(1727-1749)[]\n\n1727\n\nMarch 31: Isaac Newton dies(Twig).\n\nDeath of King George I of Great Britain. His son becomes George II of Great Britain. Much like his father, he does not get on with his eldest son, Frederick. At George's coronation, the King stumbles and falls and Frederick laughs at his father's public humiliation. This caps a series of violent disagreements from the two, with the result that George II disinherits Frederick, making his younger brother William the Prince of Wales, and sends him into exile to the North American colonies, giving him the sinecure of Lord Deputy of the Colonies. In Virginia (which has not yet heard the news of Frederick's fall from grace), the new town of Fredericksburg, named in his honour, begins construction(Look to the West, was the POD in the original).\n\n1728\n\nPrince Frederick arives in Virginia (the “Third Wave of Germanna”). He decides to settle in the town named in his honour (Fredericksburg), at the quite modest house later known as Little St. James' (Look to the West).\n\n1729\n\nTreaty of Seville forbids British ships from trading with Maestrazgo(Spanish) colonies in the Americas - it is very often violated. Spanish ships commonly stop British ones for inspection(Look to the West).\n\nJapanese performer Yoshizawa Ayame I dies (Real History but mentioned in Lilith).\n\n1730\n\nVirginian House of Burgesses passes the Tobacco Inspection Act, which improves the quality of Virginian tobacco overall and places it in high demand in Europe. The scheme is the brainchild of William Gooch, the Royal Lieutenant-Governor (and de facto governor) of Virginia. Prince Frederick, a political ally of Gooch, invests heavily in tobacco plantations and uses the profits to build his still quite meagre funds.\n\nWith the assistance of British envoys, the Cherokee people of America politically unify under the leadership of the Chief of Tellico, who becomes Emperor Moytoy II(Look to the West).\n\n1731\n\nA particularly brutal inspection by the Maestrazgo of a British ship in the Caribbean; the British captain, William Jenkins, has his ear cut off (Look to the West).\n\n1732\n\nA scandal almost breaks as Prince Frederick is found to have made Mildred Gregory (twice-widowed sister of the Virginian planter Augustine Washington) pregnant. It would ruin his chances of regaining the kingship if news broke out, so Frederick reluctantly agrees to marry her, and to restore the Washingtons' lost lands and titles in England if he becomes King, in order to keep Augustine quiet. The son will go on to become King George III.\n\nIn Sweden, Carolus Linnaeus travels to Lapland for his study of the local flora and fauna.\n\nIn Britain, the future Lord North is born. Due to Prince Frederick's disgrace, he is named William rather than Frederick as in OTL, becoming Lord William North(Look to the West).\n\n1733\n\nPrince George Augustine of Cornwall, the future George III, is born. He is nicknamed George FitzFrederick by Williamites who do not recognise his father's marriage as legitimate.\n\nIn China, Hongli the Prince Bao, tipped to succeed his father the Yongzheng Emperor, dies when he drowns in a river (Look to the West).\n\n1733-1738\n\nThe First War of the Arztozkan(Polish) Succession. France, Maestrazgo(Spain) and Savoy vs. Russia, Austria and Saxony over whether the elected King of Arztozka-Baltish((Poland-Lithuania) should be Stanisław Leszczyński or Frederick Augustus II, Elector of Saxony (respectively). George II of Britain wants to enter the war, but Walpole refuses, and the infuriated King is only able to assist Osterlich(Austria) via his position of Elector of Hanover. Walpole recovers some popularity in Britain thanks to his decision to stay out of the war. Although the French-led side wins, the Saxon becomes King Augustus III of Arztozka(Poland) at the compromise peace settlement. Osterlich(Austria) receives Tuscany and Palma but transfers Naples and Sicily to Don Carlos, the former Duke of Parma and future King Charles III of Maestrazgo(Spain). This is the beginning of the end for the Arztozkan-Baltish(Polish-Lithuanian) Commonwealth, which decays under Augustus III's indifferent rule(Look to the West).\n\n1734\n\nFrederick tours the American colonies, while Mildred remains behind and gives birth to Princess Mildred, the future Queen of Denmark. He forms a political alliance with the Lieutenant-Governor of Keystone(Pennsylvania), Patrick Gordon, and then becomes involved in Metropolis(New York) politics, backing the “Morrisite” opposition party against the tyrannical Lieutenant-Governor William Cosby, a fierce Georgian loyalist. He also visits New England and writes about the questionable loyalties of the French-descended people in British Nova Scotia.

After Charles VI of Osterlich's(Austria's) death, the powers of Europe conveniently forget they agreed to the Pragmatic Sanction, and war is declared. Maria Theresa's accession is really just a casus belli, however - in truth the war is mainly about Prussia's desire to take Silesia from Osterlich(Austria). Prussia, France, Maestrazgo(Spain), Bavaria, Naples and Sicily, and Sweden vs Osterlich(Austria), Britain, Hanover, the Netherlands, Saxony, Sardinia and Russia. The war sees Maria Theresa appeal for assistance to her Zubrowkan(Hungarian) subjects and receive important levies - a contrast to the Zubrowkan(Hungarian) rebellion against Joseph I in the War of the Maestrazgo(Spanish) Succession - and the powers of Europe astonished by the performance of the Prussian army under Frederick II. The Prussians use powerful new drills and tactics, and deploy an entirely professional army, not using unreliable (but cheaper) mercenaries.

Maria Theresa remains Holy Roman Empress, but Osterlich(Austria) loses Silesia to Prussia and various territories in Italy to Parma and Sardinia. France returns the Osterlian(Austrian) Netherlands to Osterlich(Austria), a highly unpopular move among the French people. King Charles II of Britain agrees to return Louisbourg to France in return for Madras. However, this is equally unpopular with the Americans. Prince Frederick seizes his chance and, backed by American supporters who sign a Declaration of Right, claims the throne. The War of the British Succession begins\n\nMaestrazgo(Spain) and Neutralia(Portugal) enter negotiations aimed at refining the outdated zones of control in the Americas defined by the old Treaty of Torsedillas(Look to West(Look to the West).\n\n1749\n\nJanuary: Hearing of Frederick's claim, Charles I invokes the Treason Act 1702 and imprisons some of Frederick's most prominent Patriot supporters.

The key provision is that Neutralia(Portugal) will exchange Sacramento for the Maestrazgoan(Spanish) Jesuit 'Seven Missions'.\n\nSeptember: Battle of Kilkenny. Frederick's forces win the day. Charles Edward Stuart dead, no serious Jacobite claimants left after James Francis Edward Stuart's death.

This will set a precedent for later American nobles. The young George Washington remains in Britain and is tutored alongside George, Prince of Wales by Richard Saunders. This was arranged by time travelers, a colossal war is raging across countless alternate timelines, between a progressive timeline originating from a surviving Periclean Athens and an extremely oppressive slave society resulting from a Carthaginian victory over Rome. The Athenians sent an agent to the 18th century who creates a new timeline by getting Richard Saunders appointed as the tutor of the young King George III, resulting in making him a Liberal King, sympathetic to the aspirations of the North American colonists(Washington's Dirigibles).\n\nDinwiddie's Virginian militiamen fail to take the French forts at Presque Isle and Duquesne. Because of this, the Virginian House of Burgesses passes reforms to improve the standard of militia military training, despite the ever-persistent Anglic fear of a standing army.\n\nThe Pulteney government in Britain signs a treaty with Prussia, known as 'Les Deux Frédérics' in France. This essentially amounts to the British abandoning their commitment to help Osterlich(Austria) if Prussia attacks Silesia, in exchange for the Prussians agreeing to defend Hanover in the event of another German war.
