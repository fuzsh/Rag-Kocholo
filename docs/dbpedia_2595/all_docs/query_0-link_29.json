History and Arrangement of the Letters 315 INDEX 319\n\nLETTERS OF\n\nDOROTHY OSBORNE\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\"AN editor,\" says Dr. Johnson, is \"he that revises or prepares any work for publication;\" and this definition of an editor's duty seems wholly right and satisfactory. But now that the revision of these letters is apparently complete, one may not be overstepping the modest and Johnsonian limits of an editor's office, when the writing of a short introduction is included among the duties of preparation.\n\nDorothy Osborne was the wife of the famous Sir William Temple, and apology for her biography will be found in her own letters. Some of these were printed in a Life of Sir William Temple, by the Right Honourable Thomas Peregrine Courtenay, a man better known to the Tory politician of fifty years ago than to any world of letters in that day or this. Forty-two extracts from these letters did Courtenay transfer to an Appendix, without arrangement or any form of editing, as he candidly confesses; but not without misgivings as to how they would be received by a people thirsting to read the details of the negotiations which took place in connection with the Triple Alliance. If Courtenay lived to learn that the world had other things to do than pore over dull excerpts from inhuman State papers, we may pity his awakening; but we can never quite forgive the apologetic paragraph with which he relegates Dorothy Osborne's letters to the mouldy obscurity of an Appendix.\n\nWhen Macaulay was reviewing Courtenay's book in the Edinburgh Review, he took occasion to write a short but living sketch of the early history of Sir William Temple and Dorothy Osborne. And with this account so admirably written, ready at hand, it becomes the clear duty of the Editor to quote rather than to rewrite; which he does with the greater pleasure, remembering that it was this very passage that first led him to read the letters of Dorothy Osborne.\n\nHere Macaulay indulges in an eloquent but lengthy philippic against that \"vile phrase\" the \"dignity of history,\" which we may omit–taking up the thread of his discourse where he recurs to the affairs of our two lovers. \"Thinking thus\"–concerning the \"dignity of history,\"–\"we are glad to learn so much, and would willingly learn more about the loves of Sir William and his mistress. In the seventeenth century to be sure, Louis the Fourteenth was a much more important person than Temple's sweetheart. But death and time equalise all things. Neither the great King nor the beauty of Bedfordshire, neither the gorgeous paradise of Marli nor Mistress Osborne's favourite walk 'in the common that lay hard by the house, where a great many young wenches used to keep sheep and cows and sit in the shade singing of ballads,' is anything to us. Louis and Dorothy are alike dust. A cotton-mill stands on the ruins of Marli; and the Osbornes have ceased to dwell under the ancient roof of Chicksands. But of that information, for the sake of which alone it is worth while to study remote events, we find so much in the love letters which Mr. Courtenay has published, that we would gladly purchase equally interesting billets with ten times their weight in State papers taken at random. To us surely it is as useful to know how the young ladies of England employed themselves a hundred and eighty years ago, how far their minds were cultivated, what were their favourite studies, what degree of liberty was allowed to them, what use they made of that liberty, what accomplishments they most valued in men, and what proofs of tenderness delicacy permitted them to give to favoured suitors, as to know all about the seizure of Franche-Comté and the Treaty of Nimeguen. The mutual relations of the two sexes seem to us to be at least as important as the mutual relations of any two Governments in the world; and a series of letters written by a virtuous, amiable, and sensible girl, and intended for the eye of her lover alone, can scarcely fail to throw some light on the relations of the sexes; whereas it is perfectly possible, as all who have made any historical researches can attest, to read bale after bale of despatches and protocols, without catching one glimpse of light about the relations of Governments.\n\nWhen an editor is in the pleasant position of being able to retain an historian of the eminence of Macaulay to write a large portion of his introduction, it would ill become him to alter and correct his statements wherever there was a petty inaccuracy; still it is necessary to say, once for all, that there are occasional errors in the passage–as where Macaulay mentions that Chicksands is no longer the property of the Osbornes–though happily not one of these errors is in itself important. To our thinking, too, in the character that he draws of our heroine, Macaulay hardly appears to be sufficiently aware of the sympathetic womanly nature of Dorothy, and the dignity of her disposition; so that he is persuaded to speak of her too constantly from the position of a man of the world praising with patronising emphasis the pretty qualities of a school-girl. But we must remember, that in forming our estimate of her character, we have an extended series of letters before us; and from these the reader can draw his own conclusions as to the accuracy of Macaulay's description, and the importance of Dorothy's character.\n\nIt was this passage from Macaulay that led the Editor to Courtenay's Appendix, and it was the literary and human charm of the letters themselves that suggested the idea of stringing them together into a connected story or sketch of the love affairs of Dorothy Osborne. This was published in April, 1886, in the English Illustrated Magazine, and happened, by good luck, to fall into the hands of an admirer of Dorothy, who, having had access to the original letters, had made faithful and loving copies of each one–accurate even to the old-world spelling. These labours had been followed up by much patient research, the fruits of which were now to be generously offered to the present Editor on condition that he would prepare the letters for the press. The owner of the letters having courteously expressed his acquiescence, nothing remained but to give to the task that patient care that it is easy to give to a labour of love.\n\nA few words of explanation as to the arrangement of the letters. Although few of them were dated, it was found possible, by minute analysis of their contents, to place them in approximately correct order, and assign groups of letters to specific months or seasons of the year. The fact that New Year's day was at this period March 25–a fact sometimes ignored by antiquarians of high repute–adds greatly to the difficulty of ascertaining exact dates, and as an instance of this we find in different chronicles of authority Sir Peter Osborne's death correctly, yet differently, given as happening in March, 1653, and March, 1654. Throughout this volume the ordinary New Year's day has been retained. The further revision and preparation that the letters have undergone is shortly this. The spelling has been modernised, the letters punctuated and arranged in paragraphs, and names indicated by initials have been, wherever it was possible, written in full. A note has been prefixed to each letter, printed in smaller type than the letter itself and dealing with all the allusions contained in it. This system is very fit to be applied to Dorothy's letters, because, by its use, Dorothy is left to tell her own story without the constant and irritating references to footnotes or Appendix notes that other arrangements necessitate. The Editor has a holy horror of the footnote, and would have it relegated to those biblia-a-biblia from which class he is sure Elia would cheerfully except Dorothy's letters. In the notes themselves the endeavour has been to obtain, where it was possible, parallel references, to letters, diaries, or memoirs, and the Editor can only regret that his researches, through both MSS. and printed records, have been so little successful. In the case of well-known men like Algernon Sydney, Lord Manchester, and Edmund Waller, no attempt has been made to write a complete note–their lives and works being sufficiently well known; but in the case of more obscure persons–as, for instance, Dorothy's brother-in-law, Sir Thomas Peyton–all the known details of their history have been carefully collected. Yet in spite of patience, toil, and the kindness of learned friends, the Editor is bound to acknowledge that some names remain mere words to him, and but too many allusions are mysteriously dim.\n\nThe division of the letters into chapters, at first sight an arbitrary arrangement, really follows their natural grouping. The letters were written in the years 1653 and 1654, and form a clear and connected story of the love affairs of the young couple during that time. The most important group of letters, both from the number of letters contained in it and the contents of the letters themselves, is that entitled \"Life at Chicksands, 1653.\" The Editor regards this group as the very mainland of the epistolary archipelago that we are exploring. For it is in this chapter that a clear idea of the domestic social life of these troublous times is obtainable, none the less valuable in that it does not tally altogether with our preconceived and too romantic notions. Here, too, we find what Macaulay longed for–those social domestic trivialities which the historians have at length begun to value rightly. Here are, indeed, many things of no value to Dryasdust and his friends, but of moment to us, who look for and find true details of life and character in nearly every line. And above all things, here is a living presentment of a beautiful woman, pure in dissolute days, passing quiet hours of domestic life amongst her own family, where we may all visit her and hear her voice, even in the very tones in which she spoke to her lover.\n\nAnd now the Editor feels he must augment Macaulay's sketch of Dorothy Osborne with some account of the Osborne family, of whom it consisted, what part it took in the struggle of the day, and what was the past position of Dorothy's ancestors. All that can be promised is, that such account shall be as concise as may be consistent with clearness and accuracy, and that it shall contain nothing but ascertained facts.\n\nThere were Osbornes–before there were Osbornes of Chicksands–who, coming out of the north, settled at Purleigh, in Essex, where we find them in the year 1442. From this date, passing lightly over a hundred troubled years, we find Peter Osborne, Dorothy's great-grandfather, born in 1521. He was Keeper of the Purse to Edward VI., and was twice married, his second wife being Alice, sister of Sir John Cheke, a family we read of in Dorothy's letters. One of his daughters, named Catharine–he had a well-balanced family of eleven sons and eleven daughters–afterwards married Sir Thomas Cheke. Peter Osborne died in 1592; and Sir John Osborne, Peter's son and Dorothy's grandfather, was the first Osborne of Chicksands. It was he who settled at Chicksands, in Bedfordshire, and purchased the neighbouring rectory at Hawnes, to restore it to that Church of which he and his family were in truth militant members; and having generously built and furnished a parsonage house, he presented it in the first place to the celebrated preacher Thomas Brightman, who died there in 1607. It is this rectory that in 1653-54 is in the hands of the Rev. Edward Gibson, who appears from time to time in Dorothy's letters, and who was on occasions the medium through which Temple's letters reached their destination, and avoided falling into the hands of Dorothy's jealous brother. Sir John Osborne married Dorothy Barlee, grand-daughter of Richard Lord Rich, Lord Chancellor of England in the reign of Henry VIII. Sir John was Treasurer's Remembrancer in the Exchequer for many years during the reign of James I., and was also a Commissioner of the Navy. He died November 2nd, 1628, and was buried in Campton Church–Chicksands lies between the village of Hawnes and Campton–where a tablet to his memory still exists.\n\nSir John had five sons; Peter, the eldest, Dorothy's father, who succeeded him in his hereditary office of Treasurer's Remembrancer; Christopher, Thomas, Richard, and Francis–Francis Osborne may be mentioned as having taken the side of the Parliament in the Civil Wars. He was Master of the Horse to the Earl of Pembroke, and is noticeable to us as the only known relation of Dorothy who published a book. He was the author of an Advice to his Son, in two parts, and some historical memoirs and tracts published between 1652 and 1659. 1\n\nOf Sir Peter himself we have now a full account in the Appendix at the end of the volume. He was an ardent Loyalist. In his obstinate flesh and blood devotion to the house of Stuart he was as sincere and thorough as Sir Henry Lee, Sir Geoffrey Peveril, or Kentish Sir Byng. He was the incarnation of the malignant of latter-day fiction.\n\n\"King Charles, and who'll do him right now?\n\nKing Charles, and who's ripe for fight now?\n\nGive a rouse; here's in hell's despite now,\n\nKing Charles.\"\n\nTo this text his life wrote the comment.\n\nIn 1649 Sir Peter returned to England, and probably through the intervention of his father-in-law, Sir John Danvers, his house and a portion of his estates at Chicksands were restored to him. To these he retired, disappointed in spirit, feeble in health, soon to be bereft of the company of his wife, who died towards the end of 1650, and, but for the constant ministering of his daughter Dorothy, living lonely and forgotten, to see the cause for which he had fought discredited and dead. He died in March, 1654, after a long, weary illness. The parish register of Campton describes him as \"a friend to the poor, a lover of learning, a maintainer of divine exercises.\" There is still an inscription to his memory on a marble monument on the north side of the chancel in Campton church.\n\nSir Peter had seven sons and five daughters. There were only three sons living in 1653; the others died young, one laying down his life for the King at Hartland in Devonshire, in some skirmish, we must now suppose, of which no trace remains. Of those living, Sir John, the eldest son and the first baronet, married his cousin Eleanor Danvers, and lived in Gloucestershire during his father's life. Henry, afterwards knighted, was probably the jealous brother who lived at Chicksands with Dorothy and her father, with whom she had many skirmishes, and who wished in his kind fraternal way to see his sister well–that is to say, wealthily–married. Henry kept a diary, which is at Chicksands. This volume was kindly lent by the late Sir George Osborn to my fellow-servant and myself some years ago. This has curiously confirmed the arrangement of the letters and helped to make it more perfect. Robert is a younger brother, a year older than Dorothy, who died in September, 1653, and who did not apparently live at Chicksands. Dorothy herself was born in 1627; where, it is impossible to say. Sir Peter was presumably at Castle Cornet at that date, but it is doubtful if Lady Osborne ever stayed there, the accommodation within its walls being straitened and primitive even for that day. Dorothy was probably born in England, maybe at Chicksands. Her other sisters had married and settled in various parts of England before 1653. Her eldest sister (not Anne, as Wotton conjectures) married one Sir Thomas Peyton, a Kentish Royalist of some note. What little could be gleaned of his actions from amongst Kentish antiquities and history, and such letters of his as lie entombed in the MSS. of the British Museum, is set down hereafter. He appears to have acted, after her father's death, as Dorothy's guardian, and his name occurs more than once in the pages of her letters.\n\nSo much for the Osbornes of Chicksands; an obstinate, sturdy, quick-witted race of Cavaliers; linked by marriage to the great families of the land; aristocrats in blood and in spirit, of whom Dorothy was a worthy descendant. Let us try now and picture for ourselves their home. Chixon, Chikesonds, or Chicksands Priory, Bedfordshire, as it now stands–what a pleasing various art was spelling in olden time–was, in the reign of Edward III., a nunnery, situated then, as now, on a slight eminence, with gently rising hills at a short distance behind, and a brook running to join the river Ivel, thence the German Ocean, along the valley in front of the house.\n\nThe Priory is a low-built sacro-secular edifice, well fitted for its former service. Its priestly denizens were turned out in Henry VIII.'s monk-hunting reign (1538). To the joy or sorrow of the neighbourhood who knows now? Granted then to one Richard Snow, of whom the records are silent; by him sold, in Elizabeth's reign, to Sir John Osborne, Knt., thus becoming the ancestral home of our Dorothy. There is a crisp etching of the house in Thomas Fisher's Collections of Bedfordshire. This is dated December 26th, 1816. The very exterior of it is Catholic, unpuritanical; no methodism about the square windows, set here and there at undecided intervals wheresoever they may be wanted. Six attic windows jut out from the low-tiled roof. At the corner of the house is a high pinnacled buttress rising the full height of the wall; five buttresses flank the side wall, built so that they shade the lower windows from the morning sun–in one place reaching to the sill of an upper window. At the further end of the wall are two Gothic windows, claustral remnants, lighting now perhaps the dining-hall where cousin Molle and Dorothy sat in state, or the saloon where the latter received her servants. There are still cloisters attached to the house, at the other side of it maybe.\n\nTemple, too, claims the consideration at our hands of a few words concerning his near relatives and their position in the country. As Macaulay tells us, he was born in 1628, the place of his birth being Blackfriars in London.\n\nSir John Temple, his father, was Master of the Rolls and a Privy Councillor in Ireland; he was in the confidence of Robert Sidney, Earl of Leicester, the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. Algernon Sydney, the Earl's son, was well known to Temple, and perhaps to Dorothy. Sir John Temple, like his son in after life, refused to look on politics as a game in which it was always advisable to play on the winning side, and thus we find him opposing the Duke of Ormond in Ireland in 1643, and suffering imprisonment as a partisan of the Parliament. In England, in 1648, when he was member for Chichester, he concurred with the Presbyterian vote, thereby causing the more advanced section to look askance at him, and he was turned out of the House, or secluded, to use the elegant parliamentary language of the day. From that time he lived in retirement in London until 1654, when, as we read in Dorothy's letters, he and his son go over to Ireland. He resumed his office of Master of the Rolls, and in August of that year was elected to the Irish Parliament as one of the members for Leitrim, Sligo, and Roscommon.\n\nTemple's mother was a sister of Dr. Hammond, to whom one Dr. John Collop, a poetaster unknown in these days even by name, begins an ode:\n\n\"Seraphic Doctor, bright evangelist.\"\n\nThe \"seraphic Doctor\" was rector of Penshurst, near Tunbridge Wells, the seat of the Sydneys. From Hammond, who was a zealous adherent of Charles I., Temple received much of his early education. When the Parliament drove Dr. Hammond from his living, Temple was sent to school at Bishop-Stortford; and the rest of his early life, with an account of his meeting with Dorothy, has been already set down for us by Macaulay.\n\nAnno Domini sixteen hundred and fifty-three;–let us look round through historic mist for land-marks, so that we may know our whereabouts. The narrow streets of Worcester had been but lately stained by the blood of heaped corpses. Cromwell was meditating an abolition of the Parliament, and a practical coronation of himself. The world had ceased to wonder at English democracy giving laws to their quondam rulers, and the democracy was beginning to be a little tired of itself, to disbelieve in its own irksome discipline, and to sigh for the flesh-pots of a modified Presbyterian monarchy. Cromwell, indeed, was at the height of his glory, his honours lie thick upon him, and now, if ever, he is the regal Cromwell that Victor Hugo has portrayed, the uncrowned King of England, trampling under foot that sacred liberty, the baseless ideal for which so many had fought and bled. He is soon to be Lord Protector. He is second to none upon earth. England is again at peace with herself, and takes her position as one of the great Powers of Europe; Cromwell is England's king. So much for our rulers and politics. Now let us remember our friends, those whom we love on account of the work they have done for us and bequeathed to us, through which we have learned to know them. One of the best beloved and gentlest of these, who by the satire of heaven was born into England in these troublous times, was now wandering by brook and stream, scarcely annoyed by the uproar and confusion of the factions around him. And what he knew of England in these days he has left in perhaps the gentlest and most peaceful volume the world has ever read. I speak of Master Izaak Walton, who in this year, 1653, published the first edition of his Compleat Angler, and left a comrade for the idle hours of all future ages. Other friends we have, then living, but none so intimate or well beloved. Mr. Waller, whom Dorothy may have known, Mr. Cowley, Sir Peter Lely–who painted our heroine's portrait,–and Dr. Jeremy Taylor; very courtly and superior persons are some of these, and far removed from our world. Milton is too sublime to be called our friend, but he was Cromwell's friend at this time. Evelyn, too, is already making notes in his journal at Paris and elsewhere; but little prattling Pepys has not yet begun diary-making. Other names will come to the mind of every reader, but many of these are \"people we know by name,\" as the phrase runs, mere acquaintances–not friends. Nevertheless even these leave us some indirect description of their time, from which we can look back through the mind's eye to this year of grace 1653, in which Dorothy was living and writing. Yes, if we cannot actually visualise the past, these letters will at least convince us that the past did exist, a past not wholly unlike the present; and if we would realise the significance of it, we have the word of one of our historians, that there is no lamp by which to study the history of this period that gives a brighter and more searching light than contemporary letters. Thus he recommends their study, and we may apply his words to the letters before us: \"A man intent to force for himself some path through that gloomy chaos called History of the Seventeenth Century, and to look face to face upon the same, may perhaps try it by this method as hopefully as by another. Here is an irregular row of beacon fires, once all luminous as suns; and with a certain inextinguishable erubescence still, in the abysses of the dead deep Night. Let us look here. In shadowy outlines, in dimmer and dimmer crowding forms, the very figure of the old dead Time itself may perhaps be faintly discernible here.\"\n\nWith this, I feel that I may cast off some of the forms and solemnities necessary to an editorial introduction, and assuming a simpler and more personal pronoun, ask the reader who shall feel the full charm of Dorothy's bright wit and tender womanly sympathy, to remember the thanks due to my fellow-servant, whose patient, single-hearted toil has placed these letters within our reach. And when the reader shall close this volume, let it not be without a feeling of gratitude to the unknown, whose modesty alone prevents me from changing the title of fellow-servant to that of fellow-editor.\n\n1 A full account of Francis Osborne appears in the Introduction to my edition of The Advice to his Son, David Nutt, 1896.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nEARLY LETTERS. WINTER, 1652-3\n\nIN the original edition I made no effort to date each letter, but as I now propose to attempt this task it is perhaps well to set out the principle upon which the letters are now dated and arranged. Mr. Courtenay, in his Life of Temple, wrote that it was \"much to be lamented that the almost entire absence of dates, and of references that might indicate a date, makes it impossible to trace historically the circumstances under which the letters were written.\" The arrangement of the letters in the volume I originally published was a work of considerable difficulty, but that I had managed to put them into something like their real order has been acknowledged, and I was pleased to find that the authorities of the MSS. department of the British Museum had adopted my arrangement when they purchased the letters. Having now a printed book to work upon the task of reviewing this arrangement has been an easier one, and as I have made several alterations, I think some readers will like to follow the reasons which have led me to place the letters in their present order. It appears that whilst Dorothy was at Chicksands she wrote once a week and sent her letter by carrier. The Bedfordshire carriers came out of London early on Thursday morning, and Dorothy having received Temple's letter on Thursday evening or Friday morning, wrote her reply for the next carrier who seems, if we turn to Letter 45, to have left Bedfordshire on Monday. If we assume that she wrote her letter on a Sunday we can assign a date to nearly every letter written at Chicksands, and I propose in this edition fixing an assumed Sunday as a date to each undated letter, and stating shortly at the beginning of the notes, some of my reasons for placing each letter in its present position. I do not for a moment suppose that every assumed date is accurate, but I believe the reader of the letters will find them approximately correct, and a useful assistance in following the course of events.\n\nLETTER 1\n\nDated \"December ye 24th.\" Assumed date Friday, December 24th, 1652. There is very little doubt that this is the earliest letter of the series, and was written in 1652. Temple was now twenty-four and Dorothy a year older. He is said to have passed two years travelling in France and visiting Italy, Holland, Flanders and Germany. There was already an understanding between them that in their own eyes must have amounted to an engagement. Lady Giffard, Temple's sister, writing in after years says: \"The accidents for seven years of that amour might make a history and the letters that passed between them a volume.\" There was possibly an earlier correspondence broken off by Temple's travels. He has now written from abroad to say he is returning to England; the letter comes down by the Thursday carrier, and Dorothy writes her reply on a Friday though it cannot go until next week. I think there is no doubt \"my old servant\" is Temple himself, and the \"ten pound\" a lover's wager against her constancy, which she rightly calls a \"desperate debt.\" This is now explained in the new letter where Dorothy speaks of the £10 she is to pay Temple when she marries. The letter is \"to be kept till it be called for,\" as Temple is not yet arrived in England, but, as we read in the next letter, has written announcing his return through a Mr. Metcalf.\n\nLETTER 2\n\nDated \"Jan ye 2d 1652.\" This, bearing in mind that New Year's Day was on March 25th, becomes in our phraseology Sunday, January 2nd, 1653. Temple has received the last letter at Mrs. Painter's. Breda, in Holland, is where Temple seems to have written from on his way home.\n\nSir Thomas is Sir Thomas Osborne, her cousin, a note of whose career will be found attached to the next letter.\n\nLETTER 3\n\nUndated. Assumed date Sunday, January 9th, 1653. This seems to be the third letter. Temple has asked for longer letters than the first two and has given a full account of himself since their parting at Goring House. Dorothy now does the same. The letters continue from this point to be longer and more full of her life and works.\n\nGoring House where Dorothy and Temple had met and parted was the town house of George Goring, Baron Goring, and Earl of Norwich, a strong Royalist. He was in exile with Charles II. at this period, and who was in possession of the house is not clear. It occupied, according to Wheatley, \"the site of part of the Mulberry Garden, and Buckingham Palace stands exactly where it stood.\" In 1646 it was appointed by the House of Commons for the reception of the French Ambassador. In 1665 it was the town house of Mr. Secretary Bennet, afterwards Lord Arlington. Evelyn speaks of it as an ill-built house but capable of being made a pretty villa. It was burnt in 1674.\n\nDorothy's mother died on October 15th, 1650, and the aunt, who thereupon commanded her to come to London, was probably the wife of Sir John Danvers, the Regicide, her mother's brother. He had married–a third time–Grace, daughter of Thomas Hughes, of Kimerton. Sir John, to whom Dorothy refers in a later letter as \"my precious uncle,\" was a remarkable man. At first a gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Charles I., he afterwards became the centre of plots against Church and State. His first wife was the widow of Richard Herbert, of Montgomery Castle, the mother of Lord Herbert, of Cherbury. His second wife was Elizabeth Dauntsey, with whom he obtained the rich manor of West Lavington, in Wiltshire. She dying in 1636, he did not marry again until 1648, when he married the lady whom Dorothy calls \"my aunt.\" His house at Chelsea was famous and is thus described in Dr. Macnamara's Memorials of the Danvers Family. It stood \"close to the river near to the old Chelsea Church and to the mansion once inhabited by Sir Thomas More. The house, a very sumptuous one enriched with marbles, was surrounded by fine gardens laid out after the Italian method. Aubrey, in his letters, tells us that the chimney piece of Sir John's chamber was formerly that of Sir Thomas More.\" Lord Bacon is said to have frequently visited the house. Here I think Dorothy had stayed when she last met Temple in London.\n\nThe elderly man who proposed to Dorothy was Sir Justinian Isham, Bart., of Lamport, in Northamptonshire. He himself was about forty-two years of age at this time, and had, in 1638, lost his first wife Jane, daughter of Sir John Gerrard, by whom he had one son and four daughters. The Rev. W. Betham, with that optimism which is characteristic of compilers of peerages, thinks \"that he was esteemed one of the most accomplished persons of the time, being a gentleman, not only of fine learning, but famed for his piety and exemplary life.\" Dorothy thinks otherwise, and writes of him as \"the vainest, impertinent, self-conceited learned coxcomb that ever yet I saw.\" Peerages in Dorothy's style would perhaps be unprofitable writing. He was an ardent Loyalist, and had lent money to the King and been fined by the Parliament. The \"Emperor,\" as Dorothy calls him in writing to Temple, may feel thankful that his epitaph was in other hands than hers. He appears to have proposed to her more than once, and evidently had her brother's good offices, which I fear were not much in his favour with Dorothy. He ultimately married Vere, daughter of Thomas Lord Leigh, of Stoneleigh, sometime in the following year, a fact duly chronicled by Dorothy in a later letter.\n\nLord Coleraine was Hugh Hare, scholar, traveller and landscape gardener, a passionate admirer of chivalry and an ardent Royalist. He was a man of wealth and a favourite at Court. King Charles I. raised him to the Irish peerage as Baron Coleraine, in 1625. His losses in the Civil War were said to amount to £40,000. He married in 1632, and lived at Totteridge in Hertfordshire. I cannot find any account of his daughters.\n\n\"Sir Thomas\" is a cousin of Dorothy, his mother being Elizabeth Danvers, sister of Dorothy Danvers, our Dorothy's mother. Sir Thomas Osborne, Yorkshire baronet, afterwards Earl of Danby, is a name not unknown in history. He was at this date about twenty-one, having been born in 1631. He had succeeded to the family estates on his father's death in 1647. He afterwards married Lady Bridget Bertie, the Earl of Lindsey's daughter, and the marriage is mentioned in due course, with Dorothy's comments. His leadership of the \"Country Party,\" when the reins of government were taken from the discredited Cabal, is not matter for these pages, neither are we much concerned to know that he was greedy of wealth and honours, corrupt himself, and a corrupter of others. This is the conventional character of all statesmen of all dates and in all ages, reflected in the mirror of envious opposition; no one believes the description to be true. Judged by the moral standard of his contemporaries, he seems to have been at least of average height. How near was Dorothy to the high places of the State when this man and Henry Cromwell were among her suitors! Had she been an ambitious woman, illustrious historians would have striven to do justice to her character in brilliant periods, and there would be no need at this day for her to claim her place among the celebrated women of England.\n\nDr. Judson Bury has kindly explained to me the meaning of the word \"spleen\" as the name of a disorder. \"Physicians of the seventeenth century,\" he writes, \"were well acquainted with the anatomy of the spleen, but knew very little regarding its functions. They were in the habit of ascribing many general conditions of ill-health to disturbances of the functions of the spleen, conditions which are now known to depend on disease elsewhere.\" There is reason to believe that functional disturbances of the system were then as commonly put down to \"the spleen\" as now-a-days they are assigned by the laity to \"the liver\" or \"the nerves.\" Sir William Temple in his Essay of Health and Long Life has the following interesting passage on the subject.\n\n\"To what I have said in another place of the Spleen, I shall only add here, that whatever the Spleen is; whether a disease of the part so called, or of people that ail something, but they know not what: It is certainly a very ill ingredient into any other disease, and very often dangerous. For as hope is the sovereign balsam of life, and the best cordial in all distempers both of body or mind; so fear, and regret, and melancholy apprehensions, which are the usual effects of the Spleen, with the destractions, disquiets, or at least intranquillity they occasion, are the worst accidents that can attend any diseases; and make them often mortal, which would otherwise pass, and have had but a common course. I have known the most busy ministers of state, most fortunate courtiers, most vigorous youths, most beautiful virgins in the strength or flower of their age, sink under common distempers, by the force of such weights, and the cruel damps and disturbances thereby given their spirits and their blood. 'Tis no matter what is made the occasion if well improved by Spleen and melancholy apprehensions; a disappointed hope, a blot of honour, a strain of conscience, an unfortunate love, an aking jealousy, a repining grief, will serve the turn, and all alike.\n\n\"I remember an ingenious Physician, who told me in the fanatick times, he found most of his patients so disturbed by troubles of conscience, that he was forced to play the Divine with them, before he could begin the Physician: whose greatest skill, perhaps, often lies in the infusing of hopes, and inducing some composure and tranquillity of mind, before they enter upon the other operations of their art: And this ought to be the first endeavour of the patient too; without which, all other medicines may lose their virtue.\"\n\nWhen Dorothy says that she has been \"drinking the waters,\" I think she means at Epsom. The Diary tells us she was at Epsom from August 16th to September 4th, 1652. So the matter seems now beyond doubt. I have retained the accounts of the other \"waters,\" as they are elsewhere referred to. At Barnet there was a calcareous spring with a small portion of sea salt in it, which had been but recently discovered. This spring was afterwards, in the year 1677, endowed by one John Owen, who left the sum of £1 to keep the well in repair \"as long as it should be of service to the parish.\" Towards the end of last century, Lyson mentions that the well was in decay and little used. One wonders what has become of John Owen's legacy. The Epsom spring had been discovered earlier in the century. It was the first of its kind found in England. The town was already a place of fashionable resort on account of its mineral waters; they are mentioned as of European celebrity; and as early as 1609 a ball-room was erected, avenues were planted, and neither Bath nor Tunbridge could rival Epsom in the splendour of their appointments. Towards the beginning of the eighteenth century, however, the waters gradually lost their reputation. Tunbridge Wells, the last of the three watering-places that Dorothy may have visited, is still flourishing and fashionable. Its springs are said to have been discovered by Lord North in 1606; and the fortunes of the place were firmly established by a visit paid to the springs by Queen Henrietta Maria, acting under medical advice, in 1630, shortly after the birth of Prince Charles. At this date there was no adequate accommodation for the royal party, and Her Majesty had to live in tents on the banks of the spring. An interesting account of the early legends and gradual growth of Tunbridge Wells is to be found in a guide-book of 1768, edited by one Mr. J. Sprange.\n\nSIR,–There is nothing moves my charity like gratitude; and when a beggar 's thankful for a small relief, I always repent it was not more. But seriously, this place will not afford much towards the enlarging of a letter, and I am grown so dull with living in't (for I am not willing to confess that I was always so) as to need all helps. Yet you shall see I will endeavour to satisfy you, upon condition you will tell me why you quarrelled so at your last letter. I cannot guess at it, unless it were that you repented you told me so much of your story, which I am not apt to believe neither, because it would not become our friendship, a great part of it consisting (as I have been taught) in a mutual confidence. And to let you see that I believe it so, I will give you an account of myself, and begin my story, as you did yours, from our parting at Goring House.\n\nI came down hither not half so well pleased as I went up, with an engagement upon me that I had little hope of ever shaking off, for I had made use of all the liberty my friends would allow me to preserve my own, and 'twould not do; he was so weary of his, that he would part with't upon any terms. As my last refuge I got my brother to go down with him to see his house, who, when he came back, made the relation I wished. He said the seat was as ill as so good a country would permit, and the house so ruined for want of living in't, as it would ask a good proportion of time and money to make it fit for a woman to confine herself to. This (though it were not much) I was willing to take hold of, and made it considerable enough to break the engagement. I had no quarrel to his person or his fortune, but was in love with neither, and much out of love with a thing called marriage; and have since thanked God I was so, for 'tis not long since one of my brothers writ me word of him that he was killed in a duel, though since I hear that 'twas the other that was killed, and he is fled upon 't, which does not mend the matter much. Both made me glad I had 'scaped him, and sorry for his misfortune, which in earnest was the least return his many civilities to me could deserve.\n\nPresently, after this was at an end, my mother died, and I was left at liberty to mourn her loss awhile. At length my aunt (with whom I was when you last saw me) commanded me to wait on her at London; and when I came, she told me how much I was in her care, how well she loved me for my mother's sake, and something for my own, and drew out a long set speech which ended in a good motion (as she called it); and truly I saw no harm in't, for by what I had heard of the gentleman I guessed he expected a better fortune than mine. And it proved so. Yet he protested he liked me so well, that he was very angry my father would not be persuaded to give a £1,000 more with me; and I him so ill, that I vowed if I had £1,000 less I should have thought it too much for him. And so we parted. Since, he has made a story with a new mistress that is worth your knowing, but too long for a letter. I'll keep it for you.\n\nAfter this, some friends that had observed a gravity in my face which might become an elderly man's wife (as they term'd it) and a mother-in-law, proposed a widower to me, that had four daughters, all old enough to be my sisters; but he had a great estate, was as fine a gentleman as ever England bred, and the very pattern of wisdom. I that knew how much I wanted it, thought this the safest place for me to engage in, and was mightily pleased to think I had met with one at last that had wit enough for himself and me too. But shall I tell you what I thought when I knew him (you will say nothing on't): 'twas the vainest, impertinent,, self-conceited learned coxcomb that ever yet I saw; to say more were to spoil his marriage, which I hear he is towards with a daughter of my Lord of Coleraine's; but for his sake I shall take heed of a fine gentleman as long as I live.\n\nBefore I had quite ended with him, coming to town about that and some other occasions of my own, I fell in Sir Thomas's way; and what humour took him I cannot imagine, but he made very formal addresses to me, and engaged his mother and my brother to appear in't. This bred a story pleasanter than any I have told you yet, but so long a one that I must reserve it till we meet, or make it a letter of itself. Only by this you may see 'twas not for nothing he commended me, though to speak seriously, it was because it was to you. Otherwise I might have missed of his praises for we have hardly been cousins since the breaking up of that business.\n\nThe next thing I desired to be rid on was a scurvy spleen that I had ever been subject to, and to that purpose was advised to drink the waters. There I spent the latter end of the summer, and at my coming home found that a gentleman (who has some estate in this country) had been treating with my brother, and it yet goes on fair and softly. I do not know him so well as to give you much of his character: 'tis a modest, melancholy, reserved man, whose head is so taken up with little philosophical studies, that I admire how I found a room there. 'Twas sure by chance; and unless he is pleased with that part of my humour which other people think worst, 'tis very possible the next new experiment may crowd me out again. Thus you have all my late adventures, and almost as much as this paper will hold. The rest shall be employed in telling you how sorry I am you have got such a cold. I am the more sensible of your trouble by my own, for I have newly got one myself. But I will send you that which used to cure me. 'Tis like the rest of my medicines: if it do no good, 'twill be sure to do no harm, and 'twill be no great trouble to you to eat a little on't now and then; for the taste, as it is not excellent, so 'tis not very ill. One thing more I must tell you, which is that you are not to take it ill that I mistook your age by my computation of your journey through this country; for I was persuaded t'other day that I could not be less than thirty years old by one that believed it himself, because he was sure it was a great while since he had heard of such a one in the world\n\nAs your humble servant.\n\nLETTER 4\n\nUndated. Assumed date Sunday, January 16th, 1653. The reasons for placing this before the next letter–which is dated–are given in the note attached to Letter 5.\n\nSir Justinian is the lover here described. He had four daughters, and it is one of Dorothy's favourite jests to offer Temple a mother-in-law's good word if he will pay court to one of them when she has married the \"Emperor.\"\n\nMy Lord of Dorchester is Henry Pierrepoint, first Marquis of Dorchester, who took an active part on the King's side, and sat in the Oxford Parliament, for which he was fined £7,467. When the war was over Dorchester returned to his studies. He worked at medicine and law, and was admitted a Fellow of the College of Physicians, and joined Gray's Inn. Mr. Firth describes him as \"a little man with a very violent temper,\" and tells some curious anecdotes of assault and battery, in which he plays his part, but I cannot find anything of the precepts he gave his wife. Dorothy mentions in Letter 57 a rumour of his connection with a plot against the Protector. I do not find that this is anywhere confirmed.\n\nMy Lord of Holland's daughter, Lady Diana Rich, was one of Dorothy's dearest and most intimate friends. Dorothy had a high opinion of her excellent wit and noble character, which she is never tired of repeating. We find allusions to her in many of these letters; she is called \"My lady,\" and her name is always linked to expressions of tenderness and esteem. Her father, Henry Rich, Lord Holland, the second son of the Earl of Warwick, has found place in sterner history than this. He was concerned in a rising in 1648, when the King was in the Isle of Wight, the object of which was to rescue and restore the royal prisoner. This rising, like Sir Thomas Peyton's, miscarried, and he suffered defeat at Kingston-on-Thames, on July 7th of that year. He was pursued, taken prisoner, and kept in the Tower until after the King's execution. Then he was brought to trial, and, in accordance with the forms and ceremonies of justice, adjudged to death. The Earl of Leicester tells us that there were \"30 voyces for him and 31 against him; so his life was lost by the small part of one man's breath.\" His head was struck off before the gate of Westminster Hall one cold March morning in the following year, and by his side died Capel and the Duke of Hamilton. By marriage he acquired Holland House, Kensington, which afterwards passed by purchase into the hands of a very different Lord Holland, and has become famous among the houses of London. Of his daughter, Lady Diana, I can learn nothing but that she died unmarried. She seems to have been of a lively, vivacious temperament, and very popular with the other sex. There is a slight clue to her character in the following scrap of letter-writing still preserved among some old manuscript papers of the Hatton family. She writes to Mr. Hatton to escort her in the Park, adding:–\"This, I am sure, you will do, because I am a friend to the tobacco-box, and such, I am sure, Mr. Hatton will have more respect for than for any other account that could be pretended unto by \"Your humble servant.\"\n\nThis, with Dorothy's praise, gives us a cheerful opinion of Lady Diana, of whom we must always wish to know more.\n\nLETTER 5\n\nDated \"Jan ye 22nd.\" This is Saturday, January 22nd, 1653.\n\nThe allusions to what Temple had written about Lady Holland is a good example of the way the letters can be pieced together. Dorothy writes as news to Temple in Letter 4, Lady Diana Rich \"lies at a gentlewoman's hard by me for sore eyes.\" Temple writes back a pretty compliment about Lady Diana, evidently asking if she is Lord Holland's daughter, and Dorothy in this letter writes and answers his question, telling him \"it is that daughter of my Lord of Holland (who makes as you say so many sore eyes with looking at her).\" I think the phrase \"if you know anybody that is lately come out of Italy\" shows that Temple has recently returned from his travels and I have little doubt the correspondence from now onward is practically continuous.\n\nPosies in rings were a common fashion of the time and of an older time. Arber prints in his Garner, I., 611, a MS. collection of Love Posies of 1596.\n\nLilly is Lilly the astrologer who was visited by Dorothy herself. (See Letter 72.)\n\nThe story of the king who renounced the league with his too fortunate friend is told in the third book of Herodotus. Amasis is the king and Polycrates the confederate. Dorothy may have read the story in one of the French translations, either that of Pierre Saliat, a cramped duodecimo published in 1580, or that of P. du Ryer, a magnificent folio published in 1646.\n\nLETTER 6\n\nUndated. Assumed date Sunday, January 30th, 1653. This letter prophesies a visit to London on Friday or Saturday sennight. The allusions to the \"seals,\" the \"cold mornings,\" and the names, help us to place the letter.\n\nThere seem to have been two carriers bringing letters to Dorothy at this time, Harrold and Collins; we hear something of each of them in the following letters. Those who have seen the present-day carriers in some unawakened market-place in the Midlands–heavy, rumbling, two-horse cars of huge capacity, whose three miles an hour is fast becoming too sluggish for their enfranchised clients; those who have jolted over the frozen ruts of a fen road, behind their comfortable Flemish horses, and heard the gossip of the farmers and their wives, the grunts of the discontented baggage pig, and the encouraging shouts of the carrier; those, in a word, who have travelled in a Lincolnshire carrier's cart, have, I fancy, a more correct idea of Dorothy's postmen and their conveyances than any I could quote from authority or draw from imagination.\n\nIn Letter 45 it is said the carrier came home late on Thursday. He seems to have left London in the early morning of that day (see Letter 7) and made the journey in one day. Chicksands is about 42 miles from London. The route was by Islington, Holloway, Highgate, Barnet, Hatfield, Welwyn, Langley, Hitchin, and Shefford, which is 41 miles from London. A turn to the left here off the main road brings you to Chicksands. That Thursday was the Bedfordshire carrier's day is curiously confirmed in a pamphlet printed in 1637, called The Carrier's Cosmography, or a Brief Relation of the Inns, Ordinaries, Hostelries and other Lodgings in and near London where the Carrier's Waggons, Foot posts and Higglers do usually come up, etc. John Taylor, the author of this forerunner of Bradshaw's Guide, met, like all reformers, with great opposition to his project. \"In some places,\" he writes, \"I was suspected for a Projector; or one that had devised some trick to bring the Carriers under some new taxation; and sometimes I was held to have been a Man-taker, a Sergeant, a Bailiff to arrest or attack men's goods or beasts. Indeed, I was scarce taken for an honest man amongst the most of them. All which supposition I was enforced oftentimes to wash away with two or three jugs of beer at most of the Inns I came to.\" He makes many excuses for his book, and concludes his preface: \"Reader if thou beest pleased I am satisfied; if thou beest contented I am paid; if thou beest angry I care not for it.\" We find in this interesting book \"that the carriers of Bedford do lodge at the 'Three Horseshoes' in Aldersgate Street. They come on Thursdays.\" The carriers of Crawley in Bedfordshire also come on the same day. This in 1653 was evidently their day for leaving London.\n\nLord Lisle was the son of Robert Sydney, Earl of Leicester and brother of the famous Algernon. He sat in the Long Parliament for Yarmouth, in the Isle of Wight, and afterwards became a member of the Upper House. Concerning his embassage to Sweden this is again proposed to him in September, 1653, but, as we read in the minutes of the Council, \"when he was desired to proceed, finding himself out of health, he desired to be excused, whereupon Council still wishing to send the embassy–the Queen of Sweden being favourably inclined to the Commonwealth–pitched upon Lord Whitelocke, who was willing to go.\"\n\nTo Lady Sunderland and Mr. Smith there are several amusing references in these letters. Lady Sunderland was Lady Dorothy Sydney, the eldest daughter of the Earl of Leicester, and sister of Algernon Sydney. She was born in 1620, and at the age of nineteen married Henry Lord Spencer, who was killed in the battle of Newbury, September 20th, 1643. After her husband's death she retired to Brington, in Northamptonshire, until, wearied with the heavy load of housekeeping, she came to live with her father and mother at Penshurst. In the Earl of Leicester's journal, under date Thursday, July 8th, 1652, we find:–\"My daughter Spencer was married to Sir Robert Smith at Penshurst, my wife being present with my daughters Strangford, and Lacy Pelham, Algernon and Robin Sydney, etc.; but I was in London.\" From this we may imagine the Earl did not greatly approve the match. The ubiquitous Evelyn was there, too, to see \"ye marriage of my old fellow collegian Mr. Robt. Smith;\" and the place being full of company, he probably enjoyed himself vastly. Mr. Smith was Robert Smith or Smythe, son of Sir John Smith, Knight. His mother was a daughter of Robert Rich the first Earl of Warwick. Lady Sunderland was the Sacharissa of Waller the poet. An interesting account of her life has been written in Sacharissa: Some account of Dorothy Sidney, Countess of Sunderland, her family and friends, 1617-1684, by Julia Cartwright, 1893.\n\nLady Banbury, from whom Mr. Smith escaped, was, I think, Isabella Blount, daughter of the Earl of Newport, who married Nicholas, third Earl of Banbury. She died in March, 1655.\n\n\"Lady Painter\" is a mock title for Temple's landlady.\n\nLETTER 7\n\nUndated. Assumed date Sunday, February 6th, 1653. The allusion to Mr. Howard and the visit to London absolutely place this letter. In Letter 6 she has mentioned a Mr. Howard. Temple replies mistaking him for another Howard, whereupon Dorothy points out that she means Arundel Howard who was Henry, second son of the Earl of Arundel. His father died July 12th, 1652. Dorothy would call him Arundel Howard, to distinguish him from the Earl of Berkshire's family.\n\nThe name of Algernon Sydney occurs more than once in these pages, and it is therefore only right to remind the reader of some of the leading facts in his life. He was born in 1622, and was the second son of Robert, Earl of Leicester. He was educated in Paris and Italy, and first served in the army in Ireland. On his recall to England he espoused the popular cause, and fought on that side in the battle of Marston Moor. In 1651 he was elected a member of the Council of State, and in this situation he continued to act until 1653. It is unnecessary to mention his republican sympathies, and after the dismissal of the Parliament, his future actions concern us but little. He was arrested, tried, and executed in 1683, on the pretence of being concerned in the Rye House Plot.\n\nThat Dorothy kept her resolution of going up to London is borne out by the entry in her brother's MS. Diary under date February 12th, 1653: \"My sister came to London with my Lady Diana Rich and lay at my Aunt Gargraves by Charing Cross, and I lay at Robin's.\" Robin was his brother who died in September.\n\nLETTER 8\n\nThis letter is undated. The assumed date is Tuesday, February 22nd, 1653. It was a note sent back with the coach in which Dorothy had returned from London. Her brother's Diary says: \"We came to Chicksands in a coach of Jack Peters, at thirty-five shillings, and six horses.\" This entry is dated February 22nd.\n\nSIR,–Though I am very weary after my journey, and not well, having added much to a sufficient cold I had at London, yet guessing at your inclinations by my own, I thought you would be pleased to hear how we got home, and therefore resolved to say something, though it were nonsense, rather than omit the giving you a satisfaction that is in my power. I am so perfectly dosed with my cold and my journey together that all I can say is that I am here, and that I have only so much sense left as to wish you were so too. When that leaves me you may conclude me past all;–till then I'm sure I shall be\n\nYour faithful friend and servant.\n\nCHICKSANDS.\n\nLETTER 9\n\nUndated. Assumed date Sunday, February 27th, 1653. This begins a new weekly series. The beginning of Cléopâtre and the opening sentence of the letter place this, I think, as the second letter after her return from London.\n\nTemple's sister here mentioned was his only sister Martha, who married Sir Thomas Giffard in 1662, and was left a widow within two months of her marriage. She afterwards lived with Temple and his wife, was a great favourite with them, and their confidential friend. Lady Giffard has left a manuscript life of her brother from which the historian Courtenay was able to extract some information, whereby we in turn have benefited. She outlived both her brother and his wife, to carry on a warlike encounter with her brother's amanuensis, Mr. Jonathan Swift, over Temple's literary remains. Esther Johnson, the unfortunate Stella, was Lady Giffard's maid.\n\nCléopâtre and Le Grand Cyrus appear to have been Dorothy's literary companions at this date. She would read these in the original French; and, as she tells us somewhere, had a scorn of translations. Both these romances were much admired, even by people of taste; a thing difficult to understand, until we remember that Fielding, the first and greatest English novelist, was yet unborn, and novels, as we know them, non-existing. Both the romances found translators; Cyrus, in one mysterious F. G. Gent –the translation was published in this year; Cléopâtre, in Richard Loveday, an elegant letter-writer of this time.\n\nArtamenes, or Le Grand Cyrus, the masterpiece of Mademoiselle Madeleine de Scudéri, is contained in no less than ten volumes, each of which in its turn has many books; it is, in fact, more a collection of romances than a single romance. La Cléopâtre, a similar work, was originally published in twenty-three volumes of twelve parts, each part containing three or four books. It is but a collection of short stories. Its author rejoiced in the romantic title of Gauthier de Costes Chevalier Seigneur de la Calprenede; he published Cléopâtre in 1642; he was the author of other romances, and some tragedies, noted only for their worthlessness. Even Richelieu, \"quoiqu' admirateur indulgent de la médiocrité,\" could not stand Calprenede's tragedies. Reine Marguerite is probably the translation by Robert Codrington of the Memorials of Marguerite de Valois, first wife of Henri IV. Bussy is Bussy d'Amboise, the hero of Dumas's novel, La Dame de Montsoreau. He was an adherent of Marguerite's brother Alençon.\n\nOf Lady Sunderland and Mr. Smith we have already sufficient knowledge. As for Sir Justinian, we are not to think he was already married; the reference to his \"new wife\" is merely jocular, meaning his new wife when he shall get one; for Sir Justinian is still wife-hunting, and comes back to renew his suit with Dorothy after this date. \"Your fellow-servant,\" who is as often called Jane, appears to have been a friend and companion of Dorothy, in a somewhat lower rank of life. Mrs. Goldsmith, mentioned in a subsequent letter–wife of Daniel Goldsmith, the rector of Campton, in which parish Chicksands was situated,–acted as chaperon or duenna companion to Dorothy, and Jane was, it seems to me, in a similar position; only, being a younger woman than the rector's wife, she was more the companion and less the duenna. In Letter 57 we read, for instance, that Dorothy makes \"Mrs. Goldsmith and Jane sit by all the while,\" to prevent a would-be lover \"making discourse\" to her. The servants and companions of ladies of that date were themselves gentlewomen of good breeding. Waller writes verses to Mrs. Braughton, servant to Sacharissa, commencing his lines, \"Fair fellow-servant.\" Temple, had he written verse to his mistress, would probably have left us some \"Lines to Jane.\"\n\nThere is in Campton Church a tablet erected to Daniel Goldsmith, \"Ecclesiæ de Campton Pastor idem et Patronus;\" also to Maria Goldsmith, \"uxor dilectissima.\" This is erected by Maria's faithful sister, Jane Wright; and if the astute reader shall think fit to agree with me in believing Temple's \"fellow-servant\" to be this Jane Wright on such slender evidence and slight thread of argument, he may well do so. Failing this, all search after Jane will, I fear, prove futile at this distant date. There are constant references to Jane in the letters. \"Her old woman,\" in the same passage, is, of course, a jocular allusion to Dorothy herself; and \"the old knight\" is, I believe, Sir Robert Cook, a Bedfordshire gentleman, of whom nothing is known except that he was knighted at Ampthill, July 21st, 1621. We hear some little more of him from Dorothy.\n\nNote well the signature of this and following letters; it will help us to discover what passed between the friends in London. For my own part, I do not think Dorothy means that she has ceased to be faithful in that she has become \"his affectionate friend and servant.\"\n\n\"My old friend, your cousin Hammond,\" was Colonel Robert Hammond. He and Temple were both grandsons of Dr. John Hammond, physician to James I. His daughter married Sir John Temple, and an elder son was father of Colonel Robert. Dorothy speaks of him as her old friend, for he was from November 13th, 1647, to November 29th, 1648, custodian of the King, in the Isle of Wight. The story is that Dorothy and her brother, travelling towards Guernsey, fell in with William Temple, and the party stopped at an Inn in the Isle of Wight. Here Dorothy's brother foolishly wrote with a diamond on the window pane: \"And Hamon was hanged on the gallows they had prepared for Mordecai.\" This reference to Hammond brought them before him, on a charge of malignancy, when Dorothy, taking the blame on herself, Colonel Robert gallantly set the party free. It is at least likely that his cousinhood with William Temple had something to do with the result; but that is Lady Giffard's story of the first meeting of Dorothy and Temple.\n\nMarguerite de Valois relates in her Memoirs the sad story of her Maid of Honour, Mademoiselle de Tournon, who, when staying at the house of her sister Madame de Balançon, became attached to the Marquis de Varanbon, brother of Monsieur de Balançon. Although destined for the church the young man fell deeply in love with her, but his family opposed the marriage. Madame de Tournon, the young lady's mother, took her daughter home, and being of a harsh disposition, treated her with great severity. The young girl accompanied Marguerite to Namur, where she thought to meet the Marquis, who had not taken orders. He, however, treated her with coldness, and left Namur, where she shortly afterwards died, as Marguerite tells us, of a broken heart.\n\nLETTER 10\n\nUndated. Assumed date Sunday, March 6th, 1653. In the brother's diary there is an entry: \"My cousin Thorold came to Chicksands Friday; she went away and I went with her the first night to Statton.\" Cousin Thorold was, I suppose, the widow Dorothy mentions.\n\nThe first three volumes of Cléopâtre go up to London. The journey of Lord Lisle again mentioned. These matters, with the proposed visits of the eldest brother and Cousin Molle, date the letter. My Lord Lisle's proposed embassy to Sweden is, we see, still delayed; ultimately Bulstrode Whitelocke is chosen ambassador.\n\n\"Cousin Molle,\" so often mentioned in the letters, is \"Mr. Henry Molle, late orator of Cambridge,\" mentioned in a footnote in Fuller's Church History. From him Fuller had received the remarkable account of his father's imprisonment by the Inquisition. His father, John Molle, of South Molton, in Devonshire, married a sister of Sir Thomas Cheke. This would make Henry Molle cousin to Dorothy and also to the Franklins of Moor Park, and the Earl of Manchester at Kimbolton. John Molle was imprisoned for more than a quarter of a century by the Inquisition at Rome, where he died, in the 81st year of his age, in the year of our Lord 1638. Henry Molle, his son–who also wrote his name Mole,–was a Proctor in 1633, and a Fellow of King's College, Cambridge. Carter, in his history of the University, says: \"It seems to me he was outed for refusing the engagement which happened to one or two of the masters in 1650.\" He seems to have been an old bachelor, who spent his time at one country house or another, visiting his friends, and playing the bore not a little, I should fear, with his gossip and imaginary ailments.\n\nTemple's father was at this time trying to arrange a match for him with a certain \"Mrs. Cl.\" Courtenay thought the initials were \"Ch.,\" and supposed the lady to be an heiress named Mrs. Chambers, who ultimately married John Temple, William's elder brother. I cannot now follow that suggestion, as the initials are clearly \"Cl.\"\n\n\"Cousin Harry\" alluded to again in Letter 26 as \"H. Danvers,\" is the eldest son of Sir John Danvers, by Elizabeth Dauntsey, his second wife. He was very wealthy. He died of small-pox in November or December, 1654, in his twenty-first year, leaving his estate to his sister Anne. He is buried in West Lavington Church. Dorothy's hope that his ten thousand a year will attract \"my lady\" is mentioned again.\n\nLETTER 11\n\nUndated. Assumed date Friday, March 18th, 1653. Under this date in the Diary occurs the following entry: \"Friday, R. Squire carried Jane to London to go for Guernsey.\" Jane is Jane Wright, Dorothy's companion. I have not been able to place a letter under date Sunday, March 13th.\n\nSIR,–Your fellow-servant, upon the news you sent her, is going to look out her captain. In earnest now she is going to sea, but 'tis to Guernsey to her friends there. Her going is so sudden that I have not time to say much to you but that I long to hear what you have done, and that I shall hate myself as long as I live if I cause any disorder between your father and you. But if my name can do you any service I shall not scruple to trust you with that, since I make none to trust you with my heart. She will direct you how you may send to me, and for God sake, though this be a short letter, let not yours be so. 'Tis very late and I am able to hold open my eyes no longer. Good-night! If I were not sure to meet you again by-and-bye I would not leave you so soon.\n\nYour\n\nLETTER 12\n\nDated \"March ye 25th.\" Assumed date \"Friday, March 25th, 1653,\" the New Year's day of 1653, according to the then style.\n\nThe journey that Temple is about to take is probably a projected journey with the Swedish Embassy. We read in Whitelocke, under date March 22nd, 1653, that instructions were \"debated in the House for the Lord Viscount Lisle to go Ambassador Extraordinary from the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England to the Queen of Sweden.\" Lord Lisle was the Earl of Leicester's son, and Temple had interest there which no doubt he was using. As a matter of fact Temple stayed in or near London until the spring of 1654, when he went to Ireland with his father, who was then reinstated in his office of Master of the Rolls.\n\nWhether the Mr. Grey here written of made love to one or both of the ladies–Jane Seymour and Anne Percy–it is difficult now to say. I have been able to learn nothing more on the subject than Dorothy tells us. This, however, we know for certain, that they both married elsewhere; Lady Jane Seymour, the Duke of Somerset's daughter, marrying Lord Clifford of Lanesborough and York, son of Richard Boyle, Earl of Cork and Burlington, and living to 1679, when she was buried in Westminster Abbey. Poor Lady Anne Percy, daughter of the Earl of Northumberland, and niece of the faithless Lady Carlisle of whom we read in these letters, was already married at this date to Lord Stanhope, Lord Chesterfield's heir. She died–probably in childbed–in November of next year (1654), and was buried at Petworth with her infant son.\n\nLady Anne Wentworth was the daughter of the famous and ill-fated Earl of Strafford. She married Lord Rockingham, but not until November 13th, 1654.\n\nThe reader will remember that \"my lady\" is Lady Diana Rich.\n\nLETTER 13\n\nUndated. Assumed date Sunday, April 3rd, 1653.\n\nThe spleen, the books sent to Lady Diana, and Temple's suggested match elsewhere, help to place this letter. Battledore and Shuttlecock is a very old game, but it became fashionable for grown persons to play it in the reign of James I. Prince Henry, who was a golfer and a tennis player, was fond of it. \"To play at Shuttlecock methinks is the game now,\" says a character in The Two Maids of More Clacke, written by Robert Armin in 1609.\n\nAlmanzor and Alcidiana are probably characters in some Spanish romance. It is curious that in after years Sir William Temple speaks of Almanzor in his essay on \"Heroic Virtue\" as an illustrious and renowned hero of the Arabian branch of the Saracen Empire, and he devotes the best part of a page to his career. Upon this Mr. Gibbon in his Miscellaneous Works, V., 555, says: \"I pass over several other mistakes of Sir William Temple's that I may not seem to treat a polite scholar with the critical severity which he justly enough complained of; but I can scarce refrain from smiling at his Almanzor, the most accomplished of the western Caliphs who reigned over Arabia, Egypt, Africa, and Spain; but in fact an imaginary hero of an imaginary empire. Sir William Temple was deceived by some Spanish romances which he took for Arabian History.\" Certainly at this date Dorothy seems to write of Almanzor as though he were only a romance hero.\n\nIt is a curious thing to find the Lord General's son among our loyal Dorothy's servants; and to find, moreover, that he will be as acceptable to Dorothy as any other, if she may not marry Temple. Henry Cromwell was Oliver Cromwell's second son. How Dorothy became acquainted with him it is impossible to say. Perhaps they met in France. He seems to have been entirely unlike his father. Good Mrs. Hutchinson calls him \"a debauched ungodly Cavalier,\" with other similar expressions of Presbyterian abhorrence; from which we need not draw any unkinder conclusion than that he was no solemn puritanical soldier, but a man of the world, brighter and more courteous than the frequenters of his father's Council, and therefore more acceptable to Dorothy. He was born at Huntingdon in 1627, the year of Dorothy's birth. He was captain under Harrison in 1647; colonel in Ireland with his father in 1649; and married at Kensington Church, on May 10th, 1653, to Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Francis Russell of Chippenham, Cambridgeshire. He was made Lord-Deputy in Ireland in 1657, but he wearied of the work of transplanting the Irish and planting the new settlers, which, he writes, only brought him disquiet of body and mind. This led to his retirement from public life in 1658. Two years afterwards, at the Restoration, he came to live at Spinney Abbey, near Isham, Cambridgeshire, and died on March 23rd, 1674. These are shortly the facts which remain to us of the life of Henry Cromwell, Dorothy's favoured servant.\n\nSIR,–I am so far from thinking you ill-natured for wishing I might not outlive you, that I should not have thought you at all kind if you had done otherwise; no, in earnest, I was never yet so in love with my life but that I could have parted with it upon a much less occasion than your death, and 'twill be no compliment to you to say it would be very uneasy to me then, since 'tis not very pleasant to me now. Yet you will say I take great pains to preserve it, as ill as I like it; but no, I'll swear 'tis not that I intend in what I do; all that I aim at is but to keep myself from growing a beast. They do so fright me with strange stories of what the spleen will bring me to in time, that I am kept in awe with them like a child; they tell me 'twill not leave me common sense, that I shall hardly be fit company for my own dogs, and that it will end either in a stupidness that will make me incapable of anything, or fill my head with such whims as will make me ridiculous. To prevent this, who would not take steel or anything–though I am partly of your opinion that 'tis an ill kind of physic. Yet I am confident that I take it the safest way, for I do not take the powder, as many do, but only lay a piece of steel in white wine over night and drink the infusion next morning, which one would think were nothing, and yet 'tis not to be imagined how sick it makes me for an hour or two, and, which is the misery, all that time one must be using some kind of exercise. Your fellow-servant has a blessed time on't. I make her play at shuttlecock with me, and she is the veriest bungler at it ever you saw. Then am I ready to beat her with the battledore, and grow so peevish as I grow sick, that I'll undertake she wishes there were no steel in England. But then to recompense the morning, I am in good humour all the day after for joy that I am well again. I am told 'twill do me good, and am content to believe; if it does not, I am but where I was.\n\nI do not use to forget my old acquaintances. Almanzor is as fresh in my memory as if I had visited his tomb but yesterday, though it be at least seven years agone since. You will believe I had not been used to great afflictions when I made his story such a one to me, as I cried an hour together for him, and was so angry with Alcidiana that for my life I could never love her after it. You do not tell me whether you received the books I sent you, but I will hope you did, because you say nothing to the contrary. They are my dear Lady Diana's, and therefore I am much concerned that they should be safe. And now I speak of her, she is acquainted with your aunt, my Lady R., and says all that you say of her. If her niece has so much wit, will you not be persuaded to like her; or say she has not quite so much, may not her fortune make it up? In earnest, I know not what to say, but if your father does not use all his kindness and all his power to make you consider your own advantage, he is not like other fathers. Can you imagine that he that demands £5,000 besides the reversion of an estate will like bare £4,000? Such miracles are seldom seen, and you must prepare to suffer a strange persecution unless you grow conformable; therefore consider what you do, 'tis the part of a friend to advise you. I could say a great deal to this purpose, and tell you that 'tis not discreet to refuse a good offer, nor safe to trust wholly to your own judgment in your disposal. I was never better provided in my life for a grave admonishing discourse. Would you had heard how I have been catechized for you, and seen how soberly I sit and answer to interrogatories. Would you think that upon examination it is found that you are not an indifferent person to me? But the mischief is, that what my intentions or resolutions are, is not to be discovered, though much pains has been taken to collect all scattering circumstances; and all the probable conjectures that can be raised from thence has been urged, to see if anything would be confessed. And all this done with so much ceremony and compliment, so many pardons asked for undertaking to counsel or inquire, and so great kindness and passion for all my interests professed, that I cannot but take it well, though I am very weary on't. You are spoken of with the reverence due to a person that I seem to like, and for as much as they know of you, you do deserve a very good esteem; but your fortune and mine can never agree, and, in plain terms, we forfeit our discretions and run wilfully upon our own ruins if there be such a thought. To all this I make no reply, but that if they will needs have it that I am not without kindness for you, they must conclude withal that 'tis no part of my intention to ruin you, and so the conference breaks up for that time. All this is [from] my friend, that is not yours; and the gentleman that came upstairs in a basket, I could tell him that he spends his breath to very little purpose, and has but his labours for his pains. Without his precepts my own judgment would preserve me from doing any [thing] that might be prejudicial to you or unjustifiable to the world; but if these may be secured, nothing can alter the resolution I have taken of settling my whole stock of happiness upon the affection of a person that is dear to me, whose kindness I shall infinitely prefer before any other consideration whatsoever, and I shall not blush to tell you that you have made the whole world besides so indifferent to me that, if I cannot be yours, they may dispose me how they please. Henry Cromwell will be as acceptable to me as any one else. If I may undertake to counsel, I think you shall do well to comply with your father as far as is possible, and not to discover any aversion to what he desires farther than you can give reason for. What his disposition may be I know not; but 'tis that of many parents to judge their children's dislikes to be an humour of approving nothing that is chosen for them, which many times makes them take up another of denying their children all they choose for themselves. I find I am in the humour of talking wisely if my paper would give me leave. 'Tis great pity here is room for no more but your faithful friend and servant.\n\nLETTER 14\n\nUndated. This letter is not sent by carrier, and is a second letter in the week; we must therefore assume a date between the two Sundays, let us say Thursday, April 7th, 1653. I think we may believe that all these letters are at present addressed to Mrs. Painter, at her house in Bedford Street, next the \"Goat\" in Covent Garden. Afterwards they are sent to Jones, the saddler, near Suffolk House, and also to Mr. Copyn of Fleet Street. Temple would get the letter and write an answer which the carrier would bring down, and we often find Dorothy referring in her next letter to the answer received to the one immediately before it. When her brother's groom goes up to town, Dorothy, not unnaturally, writes a second letter in the week.\n\nThe allusion to Temple overheating himself at tennis reminds us that the game continued to be played during the Puritan times. It was objected to by the stricter party, and on October 17th, 1654, there is a petition by John Tilson, gentleman, and others \"to prohibit Charles Gibbins, a tennis court keeper, from erecting another tennis court to the disturbance of his neighbours and ill example of others in this time of reformation.\" The petition, which is in the Calendar (Domestic) State Papers, 1654, notes that \"his Highness has lately suppressed unnecessary buildings in James's Field.\"\n\nSIR,–There shall be two posts this week, for my brother sends his groom up, and I am resolved to make some advantage of it. Pray, what the paper denied me in your last, let me receive by him. Your fellow-servant is a sweet jewel to tell tales of me. The truth is, I cannot deny but that I have been very careless of myself, but, alas! who would have been other? I never thought my life a thing worth my care whilst nobody was concerned in't but myself; now I shall look upon't as something that you would not lose, and therefore shall endeavour to keep it for you. But then you must return my kindness with the same care of a life that's much dearer to me. I shall not be so unreasonable as to desire that, for my satisfaction, you should deny yourself a recreation that is pleasing to you, and very innocent, sure, when 'tis not used in excess, but I cannot consent you should disorder yourself with it, and Jane was certainly in the right when she told you I would have chid if I had seen you so endanger a health that I am so much concerned in. But for what she tells you of my melancholy you must not believe; she thinks nobody in good humour unless they laugh perpetually, as Nan and she does, which I was never given to much, and now I have been so long accustomed to my own natural dull humour nothing can alter it. 'Tis not that I am sad (for as long as you and the rest of my friends are well), I thank God I have no occasion to be so, but I never appear to be very merry, and if I had all that I could wish for in the world, I do not think it would make any visible change in my humour. And yet with all my gravity I could not but laugh at your encounter in the Park, though I was not pleased that you should leave a fair lady and go lie upon the cold ground. That is full as bad as overheating yourself at tennis, and therefore remember 'tis one of the things you are forbidden. You have reason to think your father kind, and I have reason to think him very civil; all his scruples are very just ones, but such as times and a little good fortune (if we were either of us lucky to it) might satisfy. He may be confident I can never think of disposing myself without my father's consent; and though he has left it more in my power than almost anybody leaves a daughter, yet certainly I were the worst natured person in the world if his kindness were not a greater tie upon me than any advantage he could have reserved. Besides that, 'tis my duty, from which nothing can ever tempt me, nor could you like it in me if I should do otherwise, 'twould make me unworthy of your esteem; but if ever that may be obtained, or I left free, and you in the same condition, all the advantages of fortune or person imaginable met together in one man should not be preferred before you. I think I cannot leave you better than with this assurance. 'Tis very late, and having been abroad all this day, I knew not till e'en now of this messenger. Good-night to you. There needed no excuse for the conclusion of your letter. Nothing can please me better. Once more good-night. I am half in a dream already.\n\nYour\n\nFOR MR. TEMPLE.\n\nLETTER 15\n\nUndated. Assumed date Sunday, April 10th, 1653, We must now return to a weekly series. The references to the brother's groom, and the rest of Cléopâtre, place the letter satisfactorily. The mission to \"The Flower Pott\" is helpful in arranging the succeeding letters. In this letter the commission for the orange flower water is given. In the next 16 it has arrived, and Dorothy thanks Temple for it. In the next 17 its freshness has worn off, and it is neither \"the best I have seen nor the worst.\"\n\nThere is some allusion here to an inconstant lover of my Lady Diana Rich, who seems to have deserted his mistress on account of the sore eyes with which, Dorothy told us in a former letter, her friend was afflicted.\n\nI cannot find any account of the great shop above the Exchange, \"The Flower Pott.\" There were two or three \"Flower Pots\" in London at this time, one in Leadenhall Street and another in St. James's Market. An interesting account of the old sign is given in a work on London tradesmen's tokens, in which it is said to be \"derived from the earlier representations of the salutations of the angel Gabriel to the Virgin Mary, in which either lilies were placed in his hand, or they were set as an accessory in a vase. As Popery declined, the angel disappeared, and the lily-pot became a vase of flowers; subsequently the Virgin was omitted, and there remained only the vase of flowers. Since, to make things more unmistakable, two debonair gentlemen, with hat in hand, have superseded the floral elegancies of the olden time, and the poetry of the art seems lost.\"\n\nThe brother who has been suffering from ague is probably her elder brother John. He is throughout less opposed to her marriage with Temple than her other brother Henry. He came to Chicksands in March.\n\nLETTER 16\n\nUndated. Assumed date Sunday, April 17th, 1653. The reference to \"Heamses\" places this letter, and the expectation of her brother Henry's to meet Cousin Molle is important in pointing out the relative position of this and future letters.\n\nWhat Temple had written down about Mr. Arbry's prophecy and \"the falling down of the form,\" we cannot know. Mr. Arbry was probably William Erbury, vicar of St. Mary's, Cardiff, a noted schismatic. He is said to have been a \"holy, harmless man,\" but incurred both the hate and ridicule of his opponents. Many of his tracts are still extant, and they contain extravagant prophecies couched in the peculiar phraseology of the day.\n\nThe celebrated Sir Samuel Luke was a near neighbour of the Osbornes, and Mr. Luke was one of his numerous family. Sir Samuel was Lord of the Manor of Hawnes, and in the Hawnes parish register there are notices of the christenings of his sons and daughters. Sir Samuel was not only a colonel in the Parliament Army, but Scout-Master-General in the counties of Bedford and Surrey. Samuel Butler, the author of Hudibras, lived with Sir Samuel Luke as his secretary, at some date prior to the Restoration; and Dr. Grey, his learned editor, believes that he wrote Hudibras about that time, \"because he had then the opportunity to converse with those living characters of rebellion, nonsense, and hypocrisy which he so lively and pathetically exposes throughout the whole work.\" Sir Samuel is said himself to be the original \"Hudibras;\" and if Dr. Grey's conjecture on this matter is a right one, we have already in our minds a very complete portrait of Dorothy's neighbour.\n\nThe old ballad that Dorothy encloses to her lover has not been preserved with her letter. If it is older than the ballad of \"The Lord of Lorne,\" is must have been composed before Henry VIII.'s reign; for Edward Guilpin, in his Skialethia [1598], speaks of\n\nTh' olde ballad of the Lord of Lorne,\n\nWhose last line in King Harry's day was borne.\n\n\"The Lord of Learne\" (this was the old spelling) may be found in Bishop Percy's well-known collection of Ballads and Romances.\n\n\"My Sheriff\" is, I think, Levinus Bennet of Babraham, who was Sheriff of Cambridgeshire this year. He is referred to again as \"Sheriff\" and also as Mr. B., which I translate to Bennet.\n\nLETTER 17\n\nUndated. Assumed date Sunday, April 24th, 1653. The reference to the dissolution of Parliament proves our series method of dating is not far wrong. The Parliamentary scene happened on Wednesday, April 20th, and it is possible that Temple reported it in his letter sent off at 4 a.m. on Thursday, April 21st. In any case the news would reach Chicksands before Sunday. All England is filled with intense excitement over Cromwell's coup d'état; and it cannot be uninteresting to quote a short contemporary account of the business. Algernon Sydney's father, the Earl of Leicester, whose journal has already been quoted, under date Wednesday, April 20th, 1653, writes as follows: 'The Parlement sitting as usuall and being a debate upon the Bill with the amendments which it was thought would have bin passed that day, the Lord Generall Cromwell came into the House clad in plain black clothes with gray worsted stockings, and sate down as he used to do in an ordinary place. After a while he rose putt off his hat and spake; at the first and for a good while he spake to the commendation of the Parlement, for theyr paines and care of the publick food; but afterwards he changed his style, told them of theyr injustice, delays of justice, self-interest and other faults; then he sayd: 'Perhaps you thinke this is not Parlementary language. I confess it is not, neither are you to expect any such from me.' Then he putt on his hat, went out of his place, and walked up and down the stage or floore in the middest of the House, with his hat on his head, and chid them soundly, looking sometimes and pointing particularly upon some persons as Sir R. Whitlock, one of the Commissioners for the Greate Seale; Sir Henry Vane, to whom he gave very sharpe language though he named them not, but by his gestures it was well known that he meant them. After this he sayd to Corronell Harrison (who was a member of the House) 'Call them in.' Then Harrison went out and presently brought in Lieutenant Collonell Wortley [Worsley] (who commanded the Generall's own regiment of foote) with five or six files of musqueteers, about 20 or 30 with theyr musquets. Then the Generall, pointing to the Speaker in his chayre, sayd to Harrison, 'Fetch him downe.' Harrison went to the Speaker and spoke to him to come down but the Speaker sate still and sayd nothing. 'Take him down,' said the Generall; then Harrison went and pulled the Speaker by the gowne and he came downe. It happened that day that Algernon Sydney sate next to the Speaker in the right hand; the Generall said to Harrison: 'Put him out.' Harrison spake to Sydney to go out, but he sayd he would not go out and sate still. The Generall sayd again: 'Put him out.' Then Harrison and Wortley putt their hands upon Sydney's shoulders as if they would force him to go out, then he rose and went towards the doore. Then the Generall went to the table where the mace lay which used to be carryed before the Speaker and sayd: 'Take away these baubles;' so the soldiers tooke away the mace and all the House went out; and at the going out they say the Generall sayd to young Sir Henry Vane, calling him by his name, that he might have prevented this extraordinary course, but he was a Juggler and had not so much as common honesty. All being gon out, the doore of the House was locked, and the key with the mace was carryed away as I heard by Corronel Otley.\"\n\nSuch is the story which reaches Dorothy and startles all England at this date.\n\nThe two Spencers are Robert and William, Lady Sunderland's brothers-in-law, mentioned again by Dorothy as \"Robin\" and \"Will.\" They were aged twenty-four and twenty-three, respectively.\n\nSIR,–That you may be sure it was a dream that I writ that part of my letter in, I do not now remember what it was writ, but seems it was very kind, and possibly you owe the discovery on't to my being asleep. But I do not repent it, for I should not love you if I did not think you discreet enough to be trusted with the knowledge of all my kindness. Therefore 'tis not that I desire to hide it from you, but that I do not love to tell it; and perhaps if you could read my heart, I should make less scruple of your seeing on't there than in my letters.\n\nI can easily guess who the pretty young lady is, for there are but two in England of that fortune, and they are sisters, but I am to seek who the gallant should be. If it be no secret, you may tell me. However, I shall wish him all good success if he be your friend, as I suppose he is by his confidence in you. If it be neither of the Spencers, I wish it were; I have not seen two young men that looked as if they deserved good fortunes so much as those brothers.\n\nBut bless me, what will become of us all now? Is not this a strange turn? What does my Lord Lisle? Sure this will at least defer your journey? Tell me what I must think on't; whether it be better or worse, or whether you are at all concern'd in't? For if you are not I am not, only if I had been so wise as to have taken hold of the offer was made me by Henry Cromwell, I might have been in a fair way of preferment, for, sure, they will be greater now than ever. Is it true that Algernon Sydney was so unwilling to leave the House, that the General was fain to take the pains to turn him out himself? Well, 'tis a pleasant world this. If Mr. Pim were alive again, I wonder what he would think of these proceedings, and whether this would appear as great a breach of the Privilege of Parliament as the demanding the 5 members? But I shall talk treason by and by if I do not look to myself. 'Tis safer talking of the orange-flower water you sent me. The carrier has given me a great charge to tell you that it came safe, and I must do him right. As you say, 'tis not the best I have seen, nor the worst.\n\nI shall expect your Diary next week, though this will be but a short letter: you may allow me to make excuses too sometimes; but, seriously, my father is now so continually ill, that I have hardly time for anything. 'Tis but an ague that he has, but yet I am much afraid that is more than his age and weakness will be able to bear; he keeps his bed, and never rises but to have it made, and most times faints with that. You ought in charity to write as much as you can, for, in earnest, my life here since my father's sickness is so sad that, to another humour than mine, it would be unsupportable; but I have been so used to misfortunes, that I cannot be much surprised with them, though perhaps I am as sensible of them as another. I'll leave you, for I find these thoughts begin to put me in ill humour; farewell, may you be ever happy. If I am so at all, it is in being\n\nYour\n\nLETTER 18\n\nUndated. Assumed date Sunday, May 1st, 1653. According to the Diary Sir Peter Osborne fell ill in the chapel on Sunday, April 10th. His illness has been mentioned in the last preceding letter. Some might prefer transposing this and the last letter, but in my view the references to Sir Peter's illness and \"my lady's\" letter and books makes the present arrangement preferable.\n\nLady Newcastle was Margaret Duchess of Newcastle. \"The thrice noble, chaste, and virtuous, but again somewhat fantastical and original-brained, generous Margaret Newcastle,\" as Elia describes her. She was the youngest daughter of Sir Thomas Lucas, and was born at Colchester towards the end of the reign of James I. Her mother appears to have been remarkably careful of her education in all such lighter matters as dancing, music, and the learning of the French tongue; but she does not seem to have made any deep study of the classics. In 1643 she joined the Court at Oxford, and was made one of the Maids of Honour to Henrietta Maria, whom she afterwards attended in exile. At Paris she met the Marquis of Newcastle, who married her in that city in 1645. From Paris they went to Rotterdam, she leaving the Queen to follow her husband's fortunes; and after stopping at Rotterdam and Brabant for short periods, they settled at Antwerp.\n\nAt the Restoration she returned to England with her husband, and employed her time in writing letters, plays, poems, philosophical discourses, and orations. There is a long catalogue of her works in Ballard's Memoirs, but all published at a date subsequent to 1653. However, from Anthony Wood and other sources one gathers somewhat different details of her life and writings; and the book to which Dorothy refers here and in Letter 24, is probably the Poems and Fancies, an edition of which was published, I believe, in this year [1653]. Many of her verses are more strangely incomprehensible than anything even in the poetry of to-day. Take, for instance, a poem of four lines, from the Poems and Fancies, entitled:\n\nTHE JOINING OF SEVERAL FIGUR'D ATOMS\n\nMAKES OTHER FIGURES\n\nSeveral figur'd Atoms well agreeing\n\nWhen join'd, do give another figure being.\n\nFor as those figures joined several ways\n\nThe fabrick of each several creature raise.\n\nThis seems to be a rhyming statement of the Atomic theory, but whether it is a poem or a fancy we should find it hard to decide. It is not, however, an unfair example of Lady Newcastle's fantastic style. Lady Newcastle died in 1673, and was buried in Westminster Abbey–\"A wise, witty, and learned Lady, which her many books do well testify.\"\n\nLETTER 19\n\nUndated. Assumed date Sunday, May 8th, 1653. This letter is written in the month of May, as our ancestors knew it.\n\n\"As it fell upon a day\n\nIn the merry month of May,\n\nSitting in a pleasant shade\n\nWhich a grove of myrtles made.\"\n\nI do not think it is placed much out of date. Cousin Molle arrived from Cambridge in a coach, sick of quartan ague on April 14th. The niece arrived early in May on a Friday. These dates come from the Diary.\n\nI cannot pass by this letter without saying that the first part of it is, to my thinking, the most dainty and pleasing piece of writing that Dorothy has left us. The account of her life, one day and every day, is like a gust of fresh country air clearing away the mist of time and enabling one to see Dorothy at Chicksands quite clearly. It is fashionable to deny Macaulay everything but memory; but he had the good taste and discernment to admire this letter, and quote from it in his Essay on Sir William Temple–a quotation for which I shall always remain very grateful to him.\n\nMr. B., who \"comes in question\" at this time is, I think, Levinus Bennet, of Babraham, who is mentioned before as \"the Sheriff.\"\n\n\"My brother John\" was Sir Peter's eldest son, who had married his cousin Eleanor Danvers, whom Dorothy calls \"sister.\" They lived at Gloucestershire. He was thirty-eight years of age at this time, and when he was at Chicksands seems to have been more sympathetic than her brother Henry.\n\nSir Thomas Peyton, \"Brother Peyton\"–whose first wife, now dead, was Dorothy's eldest sister Anne–was born in 1619, being, I believe, the second baronet of that name. His seat was at Knowlton, in the county of Kent. Early in the reign of Charles I. we find him as Member of Parliament for Sandwich, figuring in a Committee side by side with the two Sir Harry Vanes; the Committee having been sent into Kent to prevent the dispersal of rumours to the scandal of Parliament–no light task, one would think. In 1643 he is in prison, charged among other things with being a malignant. An unjust charge, as he thinks; for he writes to his brother, \"If to wish on earth peace, goodwill towards men, be a malignant, none is greater than your affectionate brother, Thomas Peyton.\" But in spite of these peaceful thoughts in prison, in May, 1646, he is heading a Royalist rising in Kent. The other counties not joining in at the right moment, in accordance with the general procedure at Royalist risings, it is defeated by Fairfax. Sir Thomas's house is ransacked, he himself is taken prisoner near Bury St. Edmunds, brought to the House of Commons, and committed to the Tower. A right worthy son-in-law of good Sir Peter.
