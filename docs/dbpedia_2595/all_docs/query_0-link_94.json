Dr. F. L. Cross, in the catholicity of his interests, read my proofs to my great profit, and Dr. J. B. Owen did me the same service for part of them. The General Editor of this series, Sir George Clark, put his wisdom and experience most generously at my disposal. I am grateful also to those pupils, both in Christ Church and in my W.E.A. class at Headington, who clarified my ideas by forcing me to defend them. To Miss Elizabeth A. Livingstone I am most deeply obliged for her tireless labours in typing my manuscript, in working on the index, in pursuing references for verification, and in keeping me to a time-table. I must also thank my wife and family for bearing with me while I have been living with this book. J. S.

Politi¬ cians, it is true, expected changes, for the king was likely to appoint new ministers. His power to do so was a cardinal point in political theory, and was to remain so for at least another seventy years. Ministers in power under George II accordingly could hope to remain in place only by ingratiating themselves with the new master. They did not challenge his right to dismiss them. For the duty of the new king was to hold an administration together so that Britain might be governed. At all times ministers were likely to quarrel among themselves and to show their lack of any sense of collective responsibility or mutual good faith. The limits upon the king’s freedom of choice were personal and fluctuating. The men he chose had to be able to serve together, and had to be able to see to business in Parliament. From the point of view of his own convenience it suited the king to work with someone popular in parliament. Otherwise his essential business would give trouble and necessi¬ tate great effort. Within such wide limits any king would choose ministers personally pleasing to him. It could surprise no one therefore if George III planned to employ some new men. But any such appointment would no more mark an epoch constitu¬ tionally than a change in Windsor coachmen marks a chapter in the history of locomotion. The members of the small circle which was concerned with political authority either welcomed or dreaded (according to their interests) changes which would resemble those intended erhaps\n\n1 John Stuart, third earl of Bute (1713-92), a representative peer of Scotland, 1737> since 1747 a rising influence in the prince of Wales’s court; secretary of state, 1761; first lord of the treasury, 1762, but resigned in 1763.

Even less did ordinary men regard 1760 as a date from which histo¬ rians might subsequently try to date the beginnings of revolu¬ tions in industry and in social life. No sense of a new world struggling to be born disturbed the solid and familiar certainties of mid-century life. Contemporary opinion was more in the right of it than many later historians. Neither in the constitution nor in economic life is there any sharp break to be discerned in 1760. And yet in the political field the reign of George III had, almost from its start, a different climate from that of his predecessor. George III himself could not, whatever his intentions, produce this change. Great issues arose from the peace of Paris, from Wilkes’s adven¬ tures, from America, from Ireland, which were different in intensity from those of the previous forty years. Fresh strain was put upon the old political system and so, in time, resulted in that system working differently. The Crown’s selection of its servants, for instance, becomes a subject of more controversy when the candidates represent opposed principles than when the choice is merely of personalities. In the economic field the new developments were slower. The so-called industrial revolu¬ tion cannot, by its nature, be pinned down to a date chart. But even the roughest dating of it cannot place its effective start before the 1780’s. By the end of the reign, however, the atmo¬ sphere had changed both in the political salon and in the manufacturing shop. Only George III himself and his most prejudiced enemies—or distant Americans—could attribute to the king personally a major share in this alteration. Here, despite proverbs, there has been a great deal of smoke without any fire, if we except the ignis fatuus of George’s own youthful and neurotic longings. George did intend to make a significant change on his accession. He imagined that he would ride forth to kill dragons, the monsters of corruption and immorality. His father had, like all Hanoverian heirs, opposed the king.2 A prince of Wales was the rallying point for opposition to government, opposition which aimed at remaining respectable by associating itself with 1 See B. Williams, The Whig Supremacy (vol. xi of the present History), p. 193. 2 See Mr. Romney Sedgwick’s introduction to his Letters of George III to Bute in which the political consequences of this conflict of monarch and heir are studied as the ‘Leicester House Cycle’*\n\nA PRINCE IN OPPOSITION\n\n3\n\nthe royal family, and which hoped for places and rewards when the prince came into his inheritance. So behind Frederick’s contrariness lay impatience for power and personal animosity to his father. To maintain his importance any cry, any grievance, might be exploited. Frederick would even sometimes hope to pose as the moral man fighting the dirty methods and dirtier mistresses of George II. As methodism was the subject of sneers at court, Frederick attended the Moorfields tabernacle and hoped, he said, ‘to seize the skirt of Lady Huntingdon’s1 mantle to lift me up to heaven’. To lift him up into prominence he would seize on some controversial issue, domestic or Hanoverian, and trail his coat before the king without further motive than the desire to annoy. Even his selection of Mercier as his chosen portrait painter was determined by his wish to flout more commonly accepted artists, whose offence was not their faults of composition but their favour at court.2 After Frederick’s death in 1751 the twelve-year-old grandson of George II was heir to the prejudices, while not aware of the motives, of his father. In his adolescence he took seriously the cant phrases of opposition mouthed by his poor father. All men out of power during the century denounced the foreign en¬ tanglements entered into by their successful rivals; but if once themselves in the seats of authority they placidly continued in the old ways. All men in opposition exaggerated the corruption of government: few in office dreamed of changing the system. But George was neither old nor sophisticated enough to play this game as his father had. His feelings were the more intense because he was prevented from giving any practical and petty expression to them. Moreover he considered that his mother was shabbily treated by his grandfather and by ministers. His heart was full of spite and a longing for revenge; his resentment he interpreted as proof of his special mission to purify politics. For him a battle between right and wrong—not between ‘court’ 1 Selina, countess of Huntingdon (1707-81), was converted by the methodists in her twenties. Her husband at first attempted to ‘unconvert’ her, employing for this purpose conversations with Bishop Benson. This failing she was left free to devote her wealth and energies to philanthropy and the encouragement of Calvinism within the church of England. She set up chapels registered as dissenting meeting houses, encouraged the revivalist activities of Whitefield, and endeavoured to bring to the ladies of the great social world a conviction that their hearts were ‘as sinful as the common wretches that crawl on the earth’. 1 Compare B. Williams, The Whig Supremacy, p. 381. Philip Mercier, born in Berlin in 1689, was appointed principal painter and librarian to the prince of Wales in 1727. He died in 1760.\n\n4\n\nTHE ACCESSION OF GEORGE III\n\nand ‘anti-court’, ‘ins’ and ‘outs’—was involved. With the excep¬ tion of Lord Chatham, George III was probably the only man in the eighteenth century to believe absolutely in his own slogans about patriotism, purity, and a better system of conduct¬ ing government soon to be ushered in. In fact, it will be argued below that the system was neither so corrupt nor so unified as George in his youthful ignorance imagined. On the other hand he was to find that the basis of ‘influence’, upon which all groups in politics had so far depended, was an element in the system which could not be dispensed with in normal conditions. Despite the facts, George did imagine that he was born to cleanse political life. It is clear from his correspondence that he had suffered from earliest youth from a tendency to melan¬ cholia, a consciousness of his own inferiority, and a determina¬ tion to correct these weaknesses by an effort of the will. This it is which explains his passionate devotion to Lord Bute, his ‘dearest friend’: Bute he accepted as a model for behaviour as a schoolboy accepts a favourite master. George II had to be cast for the role of devil, ‘shuffling’, ‘unworthy of a British Monarch’ —‘the conduct of this old K. makes me ashamed of being his grandson: he treats me in the same manner, his knave and counsellor the D. of N. does all people’.1 Any counsellor of George II was bound to be considered a knave. For Pitt, who had deserted the heir to serve the king, he felt particular hosti¬ lity. He called him ‘the blackest of hearts’ and ‘a true snake in the grass’: this was in 1760 when Pitt’s fame and powers were at their highest pitch of triumph. But Pitt had ‘long shown a want of regard both of you my Dearest Friend and consequently of myself’. Young George did not condemn the war effort. He tried to find military employment in it. But because Lord George Sackville was abandoned by ministers and court martialled for cowardice and disobedience after the battle of Minden, the prince perversely set him up as an ‘injur’d man’; Lord George’s early connexions with the Leicester House2 party and his bad reputation among George II’s ministers, were sufficient to make George III retain sympathy with him for fife.3 1 These and the following quotations from George’s letters are taken from R. Sedgwick, Letters of George III and Bute. The initials refer to the duke of Newcastle. 2 i.e. the heir’s party against the king, from the residence of the prince of wales. 3 Lord George Sackville (1716-85), the third son of the first duke of Dorset; he took the name Germain in 1770. As a soldier and politician he had risen to be lieutenant general of the ordnance and colonel of the second dragoon guards by\n\nGEORGE AND BUTE\n\n5\n\nGeorge felt that his task on coming to the throne would be herculean, for ‘as to honesty, I think all sets of men seem equaly [sir] to have thrown that aside’, and he had to make politicians concentrate upon public rather than private interest. But he felt himself unsuited to the part. He moped to feel him¬ self no hero. For compensation he elevated Bute to a pedestal for which the Scot had few qualifications. In 1758, when Bute indicated to the prince those failings of which the pupil was only too conscious, George replied: ‘I now see plainly that I have been my greatest enemy; for had I always acted on your advice, I should now have been the direct opposite from what I am; nothing but the true love you bear me, could have led you to remain with me so long.... If you should now resolve to set me adrift, I could not abraid you, but on the contrary look on it as the natural consequence of my faults ... if you shall ever think fit to take this step, my line of action is plain; for though I act wrong perhaps in most things, yet I have too much spirit to accept the Crown and be a sypher—’. He goes on to dream of abdication and retirement ‘to some distant region’ ‘there to think of the various faults I have committed that I might repent of them’. His only hope is that Bute, his strength, will forgive and sustain him. This is not serious thought. It is the abasement of a boy struggling to become resolute, who invests a hero with imagi¬ nary virtues and himself with odious vices. It is clear that the obstinacy which was so marked a feature of George III as king was the product of effort: it sprang always from an inner distrust, a melancholy sense of sin, which he was too good a man to allow to master him. This was therefore his only means of facing the world. He lacked the pliability and easy virtue of less highly strung people. When his obstinacy encountered an immovable obstacle, all his resources were at an end and the black humour claimed him. Even in old age in such a situation he was back in a schoolroom mood. He would threaten abdication not in pique so much as in confession of absolute failure. Madness was but this mood in an extreme form. Love and friendship were possible refuges for him. But in politics and around thrones friendship is not the solid oak of young men’s dreams, but a willow moved by winds. And love 1757. After the disgrace of his court martial he was shunned in society. After George Ill’s accession he returned to court and politics. He was secretary of state for the colonies, 1775-82 and was created Viscount Sackville, 1782.\n\n6\n\nTHE ACCESSION OF GEORGE III\n\nhas everywhere its disasters. Often trembling on the brink of melancholy mania, George was to be thrust from gloom to years of madness by the death of a favourite child. It is clear that there never was any need to invent the legend that this young man was nourished on Bolingbroke or studied to revive past powers of the Crown, if we are to account for the sense of strain with which he approached the throne. For him to be a king, as his grandfather was, was effort enough. Boling¬ broke he probably never read. There was no need to. For Bolingbroke’s Patriot King contains only the hackneyed cliches of eighteenth-century politics, what oft was thought but which no one else thought worth explicit expression.1 Young George aimed at no more power than his grandfather: but that was considerable, and he meant to use it to show the world that the reign of virtue had begun while proving to himself that he had subdued his weaker, wickeder, self. George’s character and his affection for Bute are revealed most strikingly by his letters in late 1759 about Lady Sarah Lennox. He protested that ‘I have never had any improper thought with regard to her’, but confessed that jealousy had reduced him to solitary despair. He therefore contemplated marriage with the fifteen-year-old beauty, but submitted the idea to Bute’s judgement. ‘I surrender my future into your hands, and will keep my thoughts even from the dear object of my love, grieve in silence, and never trouble you more with this unhappy tale; for if I must either lose my friend or my love, I will give up the latter, for I esteem your friend¬ ship above every earthly joy . . . tho’ my heart should break, I shall have the happy reflexion in dying that I have not been altogether unworthy of the best of friends, tho’ unfortunate in other things.’ Such sentimental language is not simply to be explained in terms of a prolonged adolescent affection. Bute was loved not only for himself but for what he represented to his young prince. In his heart George felt that marriage with Lady Sarah would be unfitting. And in Bute he had personified the highest stan¬ dards of conduct which he aspired to reach. So, on receiving Bute’s ban on such a marriage, George submitted with the reflec¬ tion —‘the interest of my country must ever be my first care, my own inclinations shall submit to it; I am born for the happiness or misery of a great nation, and must consequently often act 1 For Bolingbroke, see B. Williams, The Whig Supremacy, pp. 395-6.\n\nGEORGE’S MARRIAGE\n\n7\n\ncontrary to my passions’. Promptly he asked for a review to be made of all eligible German princesses—‘to save a great deal of trouble’ as ‘matrimony must sooner or later come to pass’.1 When he set down his resolution never to marry an English¬ woman, he said it was to please his dear friend: it was set down, clearly, just as much to strengthen himself. It was in the same spirit of nailing his colours to the mast that on 31 October, a week after his accession, he issued a royal proclamation ‘For the encouragement of piety and virtue, and for preventing and punishing of vice, profaneness, and im¬ morality’. This was the change in the old order that he planned. The young king faced a political situation of extreme diffi¬ culty. But the difficulty was not of the kind which, in his in¬ jured innocence, he expected to encounter. He had anticipated a struggle to oust from their places the corrupt politicians who had slighted his parents and himself. He thought of them as the old gang, a united junta of aristocrats on the defensive. The truth was far different. Unity in common action was exactly what his grandfather’s ministers lacked. The office holders were already on uneasy terms with one another before the change of sovereign. Their mutual suspicions were already threatening to split the ministry into fragments on the ground. The two great men, Pitt and Newcastle, said Lord Waldegrave, were agreed on one thing and one thing only—at no time again to endure the irritation of being linked with one another.2 It was an un¬ certain team that George inherited. And a stronger substitute was not easily discernible. The first ten years of the reign are a period of ministerial instability, of manoeuvring by restless groups powerless to form an administration which can live in parliament. It is a period which is comparable only to the uneasy va et vient of the ministerial history of the fourth French republic. But this insta¬ bility does not, as has been sometimes thought, date from the accession of the new king. His share of blame must be that he approached this uneasy world of political makeshifts full of the idea that it needed a new broom, whereas in fact the need 1 He married Princess Charlotte Sophia, second daughter of the late duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, in the Chapel Royal, St. James’s, on 8 September 1761. 2 James, second Earl Waldegrave (1715-63), had been the prince’s governor from 1752 to 1756 and first lord of the treasury for four days in June 1757; his Memoirs (published in 1821) have many shrewd observations upon the leading figures of his time. t\n\n8\n\nTHE ACCESSION OF GEORGE III\n\nwas for the soldering up of cracked friendships. The virtues required in a king in 1760 were the old-fashioned ones of tact and powers of conciliation: George III had only a fussy or brutal honesty. The instability of the political world probably may be dated from 1754 and the death of Henry Pelham.1 Since that excellent man, full of commonsense policy and house of commons strategy, had been removed, it had been difficult to find a team to agree among themselves and to conduct business for more than a few months. No partner Newcastle could suffer could command the commons; no eminent man in the house would bear with Newcastle. Temporarily, it is true, but only under the stress of a great war, it had been possible to arrange a partnership which masked these political facts. The Pitt-Newcastle combination was three years old when George III became king. It had been glorious without but quarrelsome within. It would stand only so long as an emergency, and lack of any other possible course, held its members together. Once it collapsed the true political position would be revealed. George’s task would then not be that of preventing the political pieces from adhering together once more in some ugly pattern unpleasing to him; his problem would be to jam into place together sufficient of the usable, but mutually repelling, pieces to make some government which could live in the political conditions of the time. Much has been written in the past about the organization of a government party.2 Reading such accounts one is tempted to suppose that the most striking feature of eighteenth-century politics was the building up, through patronage and through corruption or even through bribery, of a disciplined ministerial body in the house of commons. Henry Fox, a politician of whom George III quickly had need, was a cynical manager, we are told, who was useful because he had learned from Walpole that every man has his price. This sounds as if the task of forming stable governments demanded no more than a purse and pimp. But while jobbery was an essential part of eighteenth-century government there never was a period when it could, alone, guarantee success. The important fact about the corruption of the century is that it produced so small a result after such inten¬ sive application. It enabled government to build up a body of 1 See B. Williams, The Whig Supremacy, p. 325. 2 See, for instance, B. Williams, The Whig Supremacy, p. 28.\n\nDIFFICULTIES OF POLITICS\n\n9\n\npractical and partly organized supporters in the house of com¬ mons. But while in times which lacked controversy, this group would attend successfully to day-to-day matters in the house, it was never large enough, or obedient enough, of itself to carry ministers through controversial periods, or to enable them to raise unpopular taxes. Corruption does not demonstrate the strength of pro-government forces, but their weakness. Without it there would have been no living in a climate so unfavourable to strong administration as prevailed in the eighteenth-century commons; with it business could be carried on provided the policy and the personnel of the ministry could appeal to the patriotism of country gentlemen or at least neutralize their anti-government bias. It was the pride of the commons that they provided a consti¬ tutional balance by their innate suspicion of the executive. Lord Shelburne once defended freedom of the press on the grounds that it operated ‘as a considerable check upon arbitrary power . . . and though not so well calculated to build as to destroy, yet keeps the public awake and operates as a powerful negative, which in fact is the great requisite in all governments: for Providence has so ordered the world that very little government is necessary’. It was this feeling that provided the atmosphere of politics in 1760 and which made personal antagonisms, among the small circle of those capable of filling high office, of such disastrous consequence for the prospects of efficient ad¬ ministration. It was the cause of the hectic period of instability between the prosperous placidity of Walpole and the Pelhams and the ruinous but stable decade of Lord North. It was the basic fact of politics in 1760. As such its origins lie deep in the social and economic conditions of England in 1760, inexplicable unless these are understood.\n\nII\n\nE\n\nTHE ECONOMIC PATTERN IN 1760\n\nngland and Wales in 1760 had a population of between and 6f million.1 The steep rise in the number of Eng¬ lishmen, which is perhaps the most striking feature of the reign of George III (by the end of the reign the population had almost doubled) had not yet begun in earnest. The birth-rate and the death-rate were both high and in proportion one to the other. An increase in deaths, from epidemic or such cause, would leave open farms and jobs to the young people surviving who might then marry earlier and produce children. Thus a rise in the death-rate was followed by a rise in the birth-rate: a lower death-rate, implying the retention of a place upon the earth, a share in its food and the sun by those who would previously have surrendered them, meant that young women would be denied opportunities to raise families at so early an age; in fact it would mean a fall in the birth-rate. This natuial rhythm or equipoise of a stable agricultural society had not yet been drastically upset. Beginning soon after this date the death-rate was to decline without the hitherto inevitable consequence of a decline in births, indeed with an increase in births.2 Of the many and controversial causes of this new phenomenon, some had already appeared in 1760. In Ireland the widespread culti¬ vation of the potato, an eighteenth-century development,3 made land which had previously supported one family capable of sup¬ porting two. In England, and to some extent in the lowlands of Scotland, an increase in productivity and wealth, both agricul¬ tural and trading, was providing an increased national subsistence 1 The population of Scotland was about i£ millions; Ireland about 3J millions. (On the latter see K. H. Connell, The Population of Ireland, 1750-1845, p. 25.) 2 The real decline in the death-rate may be dated from 1780. Between 1760 and 1780 there was a very slight rise in the death-rate compared with the previous twenty years. This may be attributed to harvest failures. The birth-rate was rising, as one would expect, in 1760-80. But it was not checked even after 1780. (See H. J. Habakkulc, ‘English Populadon in the 18th Century’ in Econ. H. R., 2nd ser., vi ('1953-4),PP- II7-333 For the argument that it was not until this century that the potato was a general crop in Ireland, see K. H. Connell, The Population of Ireland, 1750-1845.\n\nPOPULATION AND HEALTH\n\nii\n\nthough the expansion of industrial demand for labour had not yet added its stimulus to child-production. The death-rate was beginning, but as yet only very slightly, to feel the effects of improved medical care. In Edinburgh the Medical School had been in existence for thirty-five years. In London the great hospitals, St. Bartholomew’s, St. Thomas’s, Bedlam, Guy’s, the Middlesex, the Westminster, and the London Hospital, formed centres for the diffusion of medical methods. Vaccination had not yet been brought fully into the fight against the mortality bills. Jenner’s1 cowpox-inoculation became effec¬ tive only from the end of the century. But already the idea of taking the disease in a mild form so as to escape its full con¬ sequences was being popularized, and George III himself, as a child, had had experience of this preventive method.2 The most vigorously pushed fine of medical research was that dealing with scurvy, because of its importance to the navy. In 1757 the admiralty ordered all pursers to supply ‘roots and Greens to Seamen, with their Fresh Meat’. Dr. Lind had already tried the effect of oranges as an anti-scorbutic afloat. Cook’s3 trial of wort extracted from malt, of sauerkraut, of carrots, and of fruit, was only the most famous of a series of experiments which had already started in 1760. Fruit had been regarded until this time as dangerous and the cause of fever. But now doctors began to favour it as a valuable acid-producing balancer in the diet. Dietary experiments were being tried for the prevention of rickets. Within ten years William Stork was to kill himself by experiments to ascertain the nutritive value of various food¬ stuffs, ranging from water and sugar, to honey, black currants, and Cheshire cheese. Cod-liver oil, already used externally, was by 1780 administered internally to all the rheumatic cases at the Manchester infirmary. Jonas Hanway4 was publicizing his views on infant welfare; in 1760 he was contending that artificial feed¬ ing on animal milk was better than reliance upon wet-nurses 1 Edward Jenner (1749-1823), a doctor in Gloucestershire, 1773; first vacci¬ nated from cowpox, 1796; published Inquiry into Cause and Effect of the Variolae Vaccinae, 1798; rewarded by parliament in 1802 and 1806; set up the National Vaccine Establishment in 1808. 2 It was popularized by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu on her return from Turkey.

At the Dispensary for Sick Children in London improved bubby-pots (feeding bottles) were, from 1769, being popularized. The Foundling Hospital had already asked the College of Physicians to investigate problems of weaning and the danger of giving opiates to restless infants. More immediately effective probably, in prolonging expectation of life, than any of this experimental medicine, would be the progress slowly being made in the paving of streets in towns, the decline in spirit drinking in favour of tea,1 and better supplies of food. This latter might be expected to affect infantile mortality, the easiest area for improvement. It is exceedingly difficult to generalize about nutritional levels in an age where statistics are wanting. In 1765, it has been calculated, a day’s labour would buy a peck of corn: fifty years before it would have bought only two-thirds of a peck.2 Rye bread had practically disappeared from the national diet, at least in the south of England. In London, it was alleged, the craze for white bread had encouraged extensive adulteration of the loaf with alum and other chemicals. The chief change for the better in the English diet was due to an increase in vegetable growing. In the north the potato was, with milk, the mainstay of the working man’s table; in the south the potato was more slowly popularized and milk and butter were much less plenti¬ ful in ordinary homes: white bread and cheese were the staple foodstuffs. In all parts of the country, however, vegetables made a more varied menu possible. The cabbage had by now con¬ quered the south as well as the north. A large dressed cabbage could be bought at Spitalfields for 1 \\d. Even more important, the cultivation of the turnip, advocated by agricultural im¬ provers, provided winter fodder for cattle. Oilcake was also in¬ creasingly used for this purpose. The swede was a new crop at the time, borrowed from Holland; not for another twenty years would it be joined by the mangel-wurzel. These new winter feeds increased the supply of fresh meat available. But it is difficult to calculate how often the workman’s table saw meat. Bedford workhouse provided meat at four dinners in the week. On the other hand a Berkshire labourer’s family of six persons expected 1 This followed the increased duties imposed on spirits in 1751 and the rise in grain prices about this time. 2 1760 to 1780 were not years of good harvests, but the general movement of agriculture was towards improvement. See below, pp. 32 f.\n\nTRADE AND SHIPPING\n\n13\n\nonly half a pound of bacon in the week and other meat only at celebration meals. A Westmorland labourer’s family of three seem to have expected four pounds of butcher’s meat a week; in their budget, unlike that of their southern contemporaries, oatmeal was the main item. In the 1770’s Arthur Young was telling discontented working men that they should not expect to eat chicken—‘and if they go without, and eat mutton instead of it, I desire to know of what consequence it is to the public?’1 If mutton cost 5d. a pound (in the north) and the labourer’s family was earning 1 ii-. 6d. a week, the alternative italicized may seem optimistic. It is clear, nevertheless, that the variety of food had very much improved by 1760 and that the upper and middle classes were gluttons by later standards,2 while even the workingclass majority had grown accustomed to new standards of living which they were reluctant to abandon. The harvests up to 1760 had been exceptionally good for many years. The bad harvests between 1760 and 1780 raised the price of grain, producing great discontent, but it seems likely that vegetable prices did not rise in proportion. Improved farming was, by 1760, showing results; its full effects could be no more than delayed by the unkind weather of the early years of George Ill’s reign. The majority of the English subjects of George III were still employed in agriculture. There were only two cities in England with a population of over 50,000. London had 750,000 inhabi¬ tants and Bristol some 60,000. These two were quite different in size and character from the multitude of small market towns and little ports which made up the rest of the borough franchise in parliament, and which handled the commerce of the country. It is easy in the light of after events to exaggerate the contempo¬ rary importance of trade and industry in the national life in 1760. Even at the time the importance of trade was certainly recognized, perhaps even over-estimated. Men who knew the capacity of their estates and who took a realistic view of their future yields, only too easily were beguiled into expecting im¬ possible gains from trade expansion. The most striking example is the wave of excitement with which people in 1760 looked 1 The Farmer's Letters to the People of England, 3rd edn., 1771, vol. i, p. 148. 2 The Goose, a Woodwardian Professor of Geology at Cambridge complained was ‘a silly bird—too much for one and not enough for two’ (H. Gunning, Remini¬ scences of Cambridge. Selections by D. A. Winstanley, 1932, p. 103).\n\ni4\n\nTHE ECONOMIC PATTERN IN 1760\n\nforward to the exploitation of the riches of the East after Clive’s victories. But in the same way, Spanish America, the West Indies, even the ‘Greenland’ fisheries, were given a place in the plans for national prosperity without much use of statistical sense in the assessment. No doubt, in the long run, this instinct of English gentlemen was sound: for they perceived the direction in which their destiny lay. Immediately, however, it was re¬ sponsible for undue stress upon mercantile policy, for the pur¬ suit of rash policies similar to those which had been advocated by the opposition to Walpole.1 It was not only a West Indian pressure group in the house of commons, but a general belief that England’s future prosperity could be built on Caribbean trade, which gives to debates on Guadeloupe, or indeed to all discussion of maritime strength, their excitement during the first years of George III. The merchant tonnage to sustain these hopes was, in 1760, approximately 500,000 tons. The ships were small and ship¬ building was an industry widely dispersed along the coast. The new ships for the East Indian trade were larger than had previ¬ ously been known, strong three-deckers for the long and danger¬ ous run round the Cape to Bengal and China. They were built in the London shipyards. The system of shipping for the Indies is worthy of note as an example of a curious combination of monopoly and enterprise characteristic of the period. The East India Company had ceased to order its ships on the open mar¬ ket. Secure in their monopoly of trade between England and India they proceeded, logically enough, to try to ensure their shipping resources. A guarantee of use was given to certain ships specially suited for the trade. As these bottoms wore out (and the fife of a ship on the Indian route was three round trips each taking a year and a half) the owner had the right to replace it. Thus there was maintained a minimum number of ships ready for the trade. In this way also there came into existence a ship¬ ping interest within the company, the managers and ‘husbands’ of these privileged bottoms, who resisted any attack upon the Company’s trade monopoly the more fiercely because the monopoly gave them guaranteed freights. It was inevitable that the ships’ husbands, with their guaranteed right to provide ships, should enter into business arrangements with the London yards where the ships were built. Thus the monopoly interest 1 See B. Williams, The Whig Supremacy, pp. 196, 198.\n\nMERCANTILISM\n\n15\n\nextended backwards into the London wharves.1 Yet at the same time within the monopoly the servants of the Company both in India and on the high seas practised the most ruthlessly indivi¬ dualistic methods of gaining their own fortunes. Ships’ captains had the privilege of space being reserved on board ship for their private goods; this space they sold, as private traders, to opium or cotton merchants in India. But those altogether excluded, Liverpool shippers or textile manufacturers, increasingly as the reign went on, attacked the whole system. The idea of a guaranteed and controlled trade and shipping was not a peculiarity of the East Indies. It was general. In 1760 war had, as ever, expanded the mercantile marine. It was never intended to allow a post-war slump to throw these ships out of work. The maintenance of the maximum number of ships and seamen in activity was a cardinal point of national defence. It was intended to secure this end by the Navigation Laws. And the Navigation Laws were the heart and crown of the whole mercantilist system. Enumeration of commodities which the colonies might manufacture or might import only from England, preferential rates of duty upon some colonial products exported to England, these were parts of an attempt to make a controlled economy, parts of a plan for imperial organization of economic activity. The whole of the old colonial system was, in theory, devised as much for the benefit of the colonists as for the mother country, or rather such a disjunction was not thought of as realistic. For it was considered essential to allow the merchants, manufacturers, and seamen, freedom to expand and experiment within the outlines of a general plan of control which should ensure that all this energy was deployed for the common good. The most obvious and pre-eminent point of common interest was national security in time of war. So while it was desirable that the people of New England should use Jamaican molasses and that the West Indians should use English manufactures and American grain, it was essential that the naval strength of the whole group, whose directing intelligence was in London, should be main¬ tained. The commodities of inter-imperial trade must move in British bottoms. The supply of British sailors must never be wanting.\n\n1 These interests are explored in Lucy S. Sutherland, A London Merchant, 1695-1774, and in The East India Company in Eighteenth Century Politics.\n\n16\n\nTHE ECONOMIC PATTERN IN 1760\n\nA constant theme of debates in the eighteenth-century par¬ liaments was therefore the need to keep up the navy and the merchant marine. The gentlemen of inland Oxfordshire or Warwickshire, as much as those of Northumberland or Somer¬ set, were always ready to applaud expenditure on ships and deprecate the provision of a soldier’s pay. In part this was a stock opposition cry. Soldiers were the instruments, it had been said for a century, of despotism. But sailor lads ‘did the state maintain’. It went with the cry1 for a ‘deep-blue sea’ foreign policy, that is a policy of expansion overseas with the minimum interest in continental Europe. But there was more to this pre¬ occupation with shipping than that. At bottom it arose from a feeling that the future prosperity of the country lay upon the water and that the survival of Great Britain rested upon her superiority to France in naval war. The old colonial system was mercantile rather than imperial. There is no more striking example of this than the treatment of Newfoundland. The purpose of English interest in Newfound¬ land in 1760, as it continued to be throughout George’s reign, was not to paint the map red or to colonize, it was to find a base for fishermen hailing from the little West country ports from Poole to Falmouth. It was therefore forbidden for anyone to settle permanently in Newfoundland. It was not to be a settle¬ ment but a great centre for the drying of nets and the packing of fish, a safe harbour for those in temporary danger. It was regarded as part of the naval service and its governor was a naval commander who divided his time between a quarter-deck and St. John’s, thinking of them in the same way. Strenuous attempts were made to prevent the 10,000 or 15,000 residents from being increased. Fishermen were entitled by right to their passage home whatever the circumstances of their captain. Bounties were (after 1775) given to those engaged in these fisheries, and bounties also helped to finance the building of larger ships for the round trip to the Banks and home. In the Northern Whale Fisheries the object was similar, to keep in existence a few thousand hardy sailors working (after 1771 with bounties) in British bottoms. To receive bounty three-quarters of the crew had to be British. In the waters covered by Southern Whale Fisheries the South Sea Company 1 Reckoned as a ‘tory’ cry by the historical accident that it had been most voci¬ ferously expressed by tories under Queen Anne.\n\nCOOK AND EXPLORATION\n\ni7\n\nand the East India Company had vested interests. The South Sea Company resented outsiders sailing round Cape Horn, and the East India Company obstructed free enterprise in the area of New Holland, the New Hebrides, New Caledonia, and New Zealand. But the need for encouraging a hardy race of fisher¬ men triumphed over vested interests. The government was prepared to encourage Byron, Wallis, Carteret,1 and Cook2 to explore in the South Pacific. And in doing so they had applause at home from gentlemen who had never done more than cross the Channel, when making the Grand European Tour in youth, but who put into their libraries Dampier’s Voyages round the World and his Voyages and Discoveries.2 Nor did they read these works purely with romantic enthusiasm. They, like Dampier himself, had an eye to business. When the explorers set off in their tough little 300- to 500-ton vessels they went looking for better bases from which England might break into the Pacific trade; they were also searching for the conjec¬ tural great Southern Continent. In each case they were seeking customers not colonies. Many people regarded the penetration of India by Clive and the Company with suspicion. They did not like the problems of conquest and of government to interfere with the trading interest. Of political complication it was hoped the great Southern Continent would be free. No greater troubles would be caused by the inhabitants, it was hoped, than those which arose from the excessive cordiality of the natives of 1 John Byron (1723-86) sailed round the world 1764-6 and became governor of Newfoundland and a rear-admiral. Samuel Wallis (1728-95), a captain in the navy, explored Polynesia 1766-8. Philip Carteret (d. 1796) sailed with Byron and then in 1767-9 circumnavigated the globe making many discoveries in the Pacific. 2 James Cook (1728-79) was the greatest of these both by his sustained effort and his scientific care. The son of a labourer: a common seaman in the navy, he rose to be a master and as such surveyed the St. Lawrence (1759) • As a lieutenant he sailed in 1768 for Tahiti and went on round the world charting the coasts of New Zealand, east Australia, and part of New Guinea as he went. In 1772 he looked for a Southern Continent and found the Antarctic icefields. In 1776 he attempted to sail round North America from the Pacific. He was murdered by natives in Hawaii in 1779 after a further voyage along the Pacific coast of North America and an exploration of further islands in the Pacific. His interest in medical improvements for the health of his crews has already been mentioned (p. 11). All voyages of exploration were much assisted after 1772 by his development (using the work of John Harrison, 1693-1776, the clockmaker and winner of the prize for determining longitude at sea) of the chronometer. Cook took for his ideal vessel the types norm¬ ally used in the Newcastle coal trade along the east coast. They were strong and handy. 3 William Dampier (1652-1715), a pirate who became a captain in the navy.\n\n3720.12\n\nG\n\n18\n\nTHE ECONOMIC PATTERN IN 1760\n\nTahiti—which was named ‘King George Ill’s Island’ by its discoverer Samuel Wallis. The search was for harbours and for collection or storage points. Once found they would open up trade and absorb manufactures while greatly increasing the shipping and the seamen, which were the true and natural strength of the country. The strength of the feeling in England in favour of mercantile expansion can be tested by the case, once more, of the Southern Whale Fisheries, which involved journeys down beyond Cape Horn and into the Pacific. These fishermen could count upon support from London in conflicts with France, or Spain, in spite of the fact that very few ships from home ports were able to take part in the trade. It was the preserve of some hundred boats from Nantucket, an island with no natural resources but the sea and the character of its fishermen. These men were regarded as imperial assets. No doubt it would have been preferable, in a perfect world, to have the trade based on Bristol. But the interests of Nantucket were always to be defended against foreign attack, for they were part of the resources of the British marine.1 In the same spirit colonial shipping in general was fostered as part of the empire’s most valuable resources, in spite of the fact that English shipbuilders feared their competitive power. By the period of the American War 150 vessels a year were coming from Massachusetts shipyards alone. The cost of a 200-ton ship built on the Thames was about £3,000, while in Philadelphia it could be built for £2,600. Here again, while the gentlemen of England preferred to see vessels built at home, this feeling hardly counted in face of their overmastering desire for the expansion of shipping and the numbers of seamen within King George’s territories. Permanently worried, as they were, about their dependence upon the Baltic for naval supplies and stores, they were bound to smile upon the expansion of an alternative source under their own influence and (imperfect) control across the Atlantic. The great objective was the defeat of France in a war of trade. Colonies were important in that they promoted trade. If France lost Canada, her naval strength would eventually be damaged by a decline in her fur trade. If France lost the West Indies, British ships would replace hers on the South Atlantic. Like a 1 Independence therefore obliged some Nantucket men to emigrate.\n\nIMPORTS AND EXPORTS\n\n19\n\ntree without roots, she would then begin to wither. This was a popular argument in 1760. It remained popular until the hard experience of war at the end of the reign showed it to be untrue. It is this reasoning which lies at the back of the Navigation Laws. European commodities could be imported into England, in general, on payment of the appropriate duties. But about one-half of the imports from Europe were subject to a further regulation. Corn, grain, wines, salts, sugar, fruits, olive-oil, timber, and naval stores, could be admitted to British ports only , if they were brought either in ships of the producing country or in British ships. Further, by the Staple Act (1663) Britain was made the staple for all European commodities destined for the colonies, that is they must be taken by way of England and pay English duties. They must moreover be transported to the colonies in ships of England or of the colonies.1 Aimed origin¬ ally against Dutch rivals in the carrying trade, the Navigation Laws had by 1760 become part of an Englishman’s faith in the destiny of his country on the seas. Even radical economists such as Dean Tucker2 and Adam Smith3 were to acknowledge that, on grounds other than economic, the Navigation Laws might be defended. Most members of parliament did not distinguish be¬ tween the economic and the strategic aspects of commercial regulation. For them shipping and security went together but so did shipping and trade. The total value of imports into England in 1760 was officially estimated at approximately £11 million. Exports were about £16 million. To appreciate the significance of such figures one can compare them with the national budget;4 ^15^ million was the total of supplies voted in 1760, and this was a war year of exceptional high cost. In the previous reign the average supplies voted amounted to some £7 million a year, and by 1774 the figure had been reduced once more to some £11^ million for an average year. It is clear, therefore, that country gentlemen would, though ignorant of precise figures, see in international trade a most important section of the strength of England. Moreover many gentlemen were obsessed by the horrors of the mounting national debt which, within three years of George’s 1 For a further discussion of policy with regard to the colonies, see below, pp. 180 f. 2 See below, p. 329. 3 See below, p. 329. 4 The word ‘budget’ is used for convenience here. There was no annual stock¬ taking, no full budget, until the nineteenth-century innovations of Addington. The total amounts have to be collected from several returns.\n\n2o\n\nTHE ECONOMIC PATTERN IN 1760\n\naccession, had reached some £13° million with an annual charge on revenue of million. But the debt was not consoli¬ dated and most of it existed as debts to whose service particular taxes were specifically and exclusively devoted. Thus by 1760, 222 separate heads of revenue had to be kept in distinct accounts in public offices because these revenues were appro¬ priated to particular charges. But most of the revenues which serviced the public debts were drawn from customs or excise, were charges, that is, upon trade. Two-sevenths of the excise, for example, serviced the pre-1743 life annuities, while it was perfectly orthodox for the new Grenville customs duties in 1763 to be statutorily pledged to meet the cost of American govern¬ ment. It follows that while an annual charge of almost £5 mil¬ lion was frightening to members of parliament they usually thought of it not as a whole, but as a series of charges upon trade, and therefore looked to trade expansion as a necessity of solvency. Great Britain in 1760 exported textiles, metal goods, tin, pottery, and cured fish. She re-exported tobacco, sugar, Indian calicoes, and leather. The export of woollen goods was the largest single item, rather more than a quarter of the whole. She imported mainly consumable goods such as wines, spirits, sugar, tea, coffee, furs, and silk. In addition she imported raw materials such as wool, linen, and hemp, and naval stores from the Baltic. Holland still had the largest trade with Britain, followed in order by the British West Indies, the American colonies, Germany, the East Indies and China, and Russia. The tendency was for trade with the West Indies and with the East Indies and China to increase much more rapidly than that with Holland. The Dutch trade was declining in compara¬ tive importance rather as that with Spain and Portugal had already done. The most interesting, and soon the most important, section of trade was that of the Atlantic triangle. England exported manu¬ factured articles to Africa, and bore from West Africa the black slaves for the West Indies and for the southern mainland states. From the West Indies she imported sugar. In part this sugar had to be paid for by provisions from the American mainland. North America was paid by the West Indies in bills on London and in rum. Finally, obligations to the Americans were settled, both as regards these bills and for tobacco and for timber, by the export of manufactures to them. This was, so to speak, a\n\nTHE ATLANTIC TRIANGLE\n\n21\n\nnatural triangular relationship, which the commercial code of the old colonial system merely emphasized or reinforced. The mercantilist system did not, in this area of the world, begin to run against natural channels of trade, contrary to popular belief in America at the time and since, until after the Americans had obtained their independence. After that the British system in¬ volved an attempt to exclude the Americans, now that they were aliens, from this partnership, an attempt which was as vain as it was doctrinaire. Linked with this Atlantic interchange between the colonies and England, was the persistent though surreptitious attempt to penetrate into the Spanish islands and colonies to the south. This contraband trade was less inflammable as an issue between England and Spain than it had been twenty years previously, nevertheless it was the source of incidents between them still. British manufactures and slaves sent to the West Indies were re-exported to the Spanish colonies in return for gold and for dyestuffs. With these the West Indies were assisted in paying for the foodstuffs they needed from America. The importance of this contraband trade became clear in the decade following 1760 when the British government, in its efforts to enforce new duties, imposed regulations which assisted the Spaniards in throttling the smuggling. The effects were immediately appar¬ ent in the legitimate triangle of trade. The West Indies’ capacity to absorb British exports was damaged. Between 1763, the beginning of the enforcement policy, and 1765, British exports to Jamaica alone fell by £168,000. Soon after this, in 1766, the policy was reversed. The illicit trade was made legal, from the British side, and was brought under control, by the establish¬ ment of free ports in the West Indies. The object was to bring both Spanish and French colonies of the Caribbean area within the British West Indian bloc. Single-decked vessels of foreign origin—that is small and local craft, which could not be poten¬ tial rivals on the high seas—might import articles of local growth1 into four designated ports in Jamaica and two in Dominica. This, it was hoped, would enable the British West Indies to become slave suppliers to the whole Central American area; the slaves would be fetched to the central market in\n\n1 But tobacco was banned, in order to safeguard the interests of Virginia, and any sugar had to be marked to prevent its re-export to Britain to the detriment of the British West Indies.\n\n22\n\nTHE ECONOMIC PATTERN IN 1760\n\nBritish ships. Thus British trade to the West Indies would benefit, and ships would no longer be sailing partly in ballast from England to the Caribbean.1 This triangular trade across the Atlantic, then, was not only important in 1760 but increasing in importance. Moreover it was intimately connected with some of the most controversial issues in politics of the next twenty years. The American main¬ land side of this trade will therefore have to be considered fur¬ ther in connexion with the War of Independence.2 At the accession of George III it seemed, to most of those concerned with economic problems, a less valuable and less interesting aspect of Atlantic trade than the West Indies. In addition the West Indies had already produced at Westminster a group of members with personal knowledge of the islands and with busi¬ ness connexions there. The returned West Indian, with his fortune made, like the returned East Indian, sought a country house and a seat in parliament. On the whole the climate of Jamaica did not encourage permanent migration from England. Once in parliament such a man, together with those actively engaged in the sugar trade, could make vocal the interests of West Indian trade. The American mainland absorbed settlers for good. The mainland trade had a few professional spokes¬ men. Burke was to serve New York: cities such as Bristol3 which traded with the mainland might defend American interests if they coincided with those of the city; but the mainland point of view was less well represented, and seemed less bound up with Great Britain, than that of the islands. Another great and expanding trade pattern in 1760 was that with India and the Far East. The East India Company had the monopoly of the trade. Its activities came under fire from many with exaggerated ideas of the profit it made. In fact the trade was hedged about with difficulties. It was easy to find in India cargoes for supplying Europe. The big ships of the company brought back Indian muslins and cottons, and also 4 million pounds of tea for home consumption, in addition to some of the spices of the East. Efforts were being made constantly to pene¬ trate the area of the Dutch and Portuguese influence in the 1 The policy was continued and developed after the loss of America. See below, p. 289. 2 See below, pp. 180 f. 3 Also represented between 1774 and 1780 by Edmund Burke.\n\nTRADE WITH INDIA\n\n23\n\nspice islands so as to increase this profitable trade. The Com¬ pany was just beginning to force its way into a real share of the trade with China, hedged about as that was by the regulations and prohibitions of the Chinese authorities who confined trade to certain areas and a few persons. It was more difficult to find cargoes to exchange for these Eastern products. The cotton in¬ dustry at home was not yet come of age, and England imported rather than exported cotton cloth. The great woollen industry had as its enemy the climate of India. The Chinese trade could be balanced by opium exports from India: this, however, simply increased the urgency of finding cargoes for Indian consump¬ tion. For some manufactured goods consumers could be found in India, but, in general, the import of Far Eastern articles had to be balanced by the export of bullion (from the profits of the resale of imports in Europe), and by what may be called services in India. This latter does not only mean the profits of govern¬ ment which Clive’s victories had opened up, profits which were often illusory as far as the Company was concerned though enormous for a few of its luckier servants personally. The con¬ duct of business and trade within India, or from India to other Eastern markets, yielded profits which formed an invisible balance for imports into England. But these profits might bal¬ ance the account as between India and England: they did not balance the Company’s books, for they disappeared into the pockets of individual Englishmen. Thus at the moment of its greatest triumph, after Clive’s victories, the East India Com¬ pany in 1760 was on the threshold of a period of misleading accounts, of speculation, and of political intrigue.1 Trade with the Far East and to the West was thus expand¬ ing. That with the Levant was declining in face of French competition. The trade with Portugal and the Spanish home¬ land was also diminishing. It still continued to be a valuable source of raw wool and a market for woollen manufactured goods and cured fish. Except in Scotland the life of gentlemen of fashion would have been drastically altered if anything had disturbed the import of wine from Portugal, for Portuguese table wines as well as port were popular. The trade with the Iberian peninsula had long been valued because it had showed an export surplus. Thus while Indian trade was often reviled because it led to bullion exports, that with Spain was praised 1 See a fuller account of this below, pp. 158 f. and 305 f.\n\n24\n\nTHE ECONOMIC PATTERN IN 1760\n\nbecause England had to be paid, in part, in gold. Nevertheless more direct contacts with the gold sources in the New World were replacing this trade. With most of the rest of Europe the direction of activity was determined by the sea and rivers. Hol¬ land, with its river mouths, was a valuable link with distribution centres such as Frankfurt-am-Main. The importance of Holland did not end with her part as a customer and as an agent for the rediffusion of the goods. Placed at a nerve-centre of trade, and with her capital accumu¬ lated as one of the oldest carrying nations, she had been the first in Europe to develop, from her intimate knowledge of world trade, a financial service to which England was indebted. The Amsterdam stock exchange was still the most important centre of its sort in 1760, though London was making great ad¬ vances. In the provision of capital, in advances by way of taking up government loans, in arranging for the payment of troops, the Dutch were the financial leaders of the world. It was esti¬ mated that over one-third of the British government’s total debt was held in Holland or under Dutch names and agents. To the detriment of their own trading and manufacturing interest, in the long run, Dutch investors supplied capital to England, no doubt because they had a respect for the sound¬ ness and potentialities of her position in world trade. Lower interest-rates, arising from a good supply of capital, were a stimulus to inventiveness, to new enterprise, and to industrial as well as commercial expansion. In 1760 it was a source of rejoicing in England that the war had already damaged French credit so much that London, through the agency of the Dutch, would have the command of all money in Europe which sought investment.1 One other area of British trade deserves special mention. Imports of naval stores, wood, and hemp, from the Baltic were difficult to pay for; in trade with Russia, for example, England exported only £70,000 worth of goods but imported £950,000 worth from her. Part of the urgency with which bullion pay¬ ments were sought in other parts of the world had its origin in the need to pay in specie for these indispensable imports. Ameri¬ can supplies would not suffice to maintain a navy. Thus one comes full circle to a paradox in considering the mid-century mercantilist view of trade. It was, after all, in order to increase 1 See C. Wilson, Anglo-Dutch Commerce and Finance in the 18th Century.\n\nFREE ENTERPRISE AND CONTROL\n\n25\n\nEngland’s strength as a world power that a favourable trade balance was sought. Yet the trade most unfavourable from the point of view of the exchanges was that above all others vital to her strength and security. The key to understanding the whole economic system is to realize that trade and war-potential were regarded as one. For this reason there had to be an imperial pattern of trade imposed from Westminster by means of trade laws, embargoes, and duties. But within such a framework there was great scope for . free enterprise. Government was able to exercise less supervision over the conduct of either trade or industry at this time than in the later period of theoretical laissez-faire. Many old systems of control of economic activity were moribund. The old organiza¬ tion by Trading Companies was decaying. The Hamburg, the Russian, and the Eastland Companies had become useless. The Turkey Company was considered oppressive, and trade in the Mediterranean was in decline. The South Sea Company had, in practice, become a financial house, managing part of the national debt; its interest in the far southern waters was a matter of prestige, more arrogant than real. The Hudson Bay Company nursed hopes of reaping the advantage of Wolfe’s victory in the form of an expanded fur trade. But only the East India Company remained as a major example of the control of commerce by a national and statutory monopoly. Yet while the East India Company was in danger of becoming a govern¬ ment agency, ruthless individual enterprise flourished under its mantle. A multitude of small local interests and small ports struggled for trade. On the east coast in the coal trade, for example, ships from Newcastle, Sunderland, Scarborough, Sandwich, Yar¬ mouth, Shields, Stockton, Bridlington, Aldborough, London, Rochester, Broadstairs, Margate, Ramsgate, Whitby, Ipswich, and Poole all took part. Here, from time to time, attempts were made to regulate the trade by combinations of the most impor¬ tant interests to exclude competitors. On the west the city of Bristol, dominated by vested interests in its corporation, was the leader of trade with America. Liverpool, oligarchic in local government but enlightened in policy, had all the advantages and disadvantages of the parvenu in its fight for advancement. It was not restricted by conservative practices or regulations: on the other hand Liverpool men were not on good terms with\n\na6\n\nTHE ECONOMIC PATTERN IN 1760\n\nthe East India Company and in their slave trading wished to avoid dependence on the Company’s muslins. They had a motive therefore to encourage English printed-calico produc¬ tion; for the time being, however, the slowness of the Lancashire cotton industry to expand handicapped Liverpool in the Atlan¬ tic race. The growth of trade is obviously linked with the rise of industry. The capital accumulated in trade expansion, for instance, helped to launch the new productive processes which were soon to be dramatically important. On the other hand an increase in the production of textiles was a stimulus to the search for new markets, and because of Yorkshire’s output ships searched the coasts of Australia and sailors bargained with the mandarins of South China. But though production was in¬ creasing, it is important not to exaggerate the extent to which industry was expanding in 1760. In the politics of the time, certainly, members of parliament were much more interested in the problems of trade than in those of industry. The latter chiefly came before them when pressure groups, such as the Newcastle coal-producers, attempted to regulate production to the detriment of other areas, or when protection was demanded against foreign imports. Industry was taken for granted by most people, as a comparatively static and undramatic part of the national life. Nor were they much at fault. In France not only was the government more active in patronage of industry, but the rate of expansion was faster than it was in England. This was true of iron and steel, of textiles, even of coal. Yet England had certain advantages by 1760. The population was smaller than that of France, but it was more easily reached as one market. There were, in the first place, less internal checks and dues to impede the movement of goods within the country. The tax on sea coals entering London was a comparative rarity.1 Furthermore the movement of goods was physically easier to all parts of England. The canal age was only just about to begin. The improvement of road surfaces and maintenance had not, as yet, reached its heights, and the coach or van in consequence had driven the pack-horse off only the important roads. But nature favoured England. Except in the north and west few\n\n1 It was part of the income of the duke of Richmond: see Sir G. N. Clark, The Later Stuarts (O.H.E., vol. x), p. 8.\n\nROADS AND RIVERS\n\n27\n\nplaces in England at this time were more than a long day’s journey by cart from navigable water. And once on the water, transport was cheap. The small ports and rivers all over Eng¬ land flourished as trade channels, in the years between 1760 and the railway age, as never before or since. The roads themselves were the responsibility of the parishes through which they ran, except where the maintenance of them had been handed over to turnpike trusts. Good stretches were followed by bad. Even on the main road from Newcastle to the south, the future Ai, Arthur Young had to hire men to prevent his coach from overturning; on a turnpike stretch itself he found that, after fearing compound bone fractures as he bounced over broken stones, he came to the worse peril of being buried alive in muddy sand. The concave road north from Oxford to Woodstock was a trough filled with sand whose foamy surface was scraped off from time to time. In the whole of benighted Devon¬ shire the sledge competed with the pack-horse in the absence of wheeled carriages. On the fashionable road from London to Bath, on the other hand, a fast service of coaches was already running. It was quite common for villages to be cut off entirely from the rest of the world by mud and water for the whole of the winter. Even so, the roads were thought the best in Europe. The canal age may be said to begin in 1759 with the duke of Bridgewater’s canal from Worsley coalfield to Manchester, which halved the average price of coal in that growing urban area. The growth of industry was thus encouraged by an effective home market which, by the standard of the times, was large. The coal trade1 of Newcastle, for instance, had from time immemorial supplied London because the pits were near the sea. Glamorgan, to take a contrast, was not yet opened up because, though it is bounded by the Bristol Channel, the streams which flow down its valleys from the present coalfields are torrents, rapidly flooding in rainy weather and useless for transport, while roads did not exist: the first road from Merthyr to Cardiff was being made when George III came to the throne. The other requirement for expansion, capital, was\n\n1 In mining one great mechanical invention had already affected the whole scope of the industry, Newcomen’s pumping-engine (B. Williams, The Whig Supremacy, p. 111).\n\n28\n\nTHE ECONOMIC PATTERN IN 1760\n\nbeing provided from the profits of commerce. When Boulton1 began to sell his Birmingham brass buttons over the world, he required great resources if he was to ride the difficulties of credit and risk involved in such a trade. But the profits accruing enabled him to invest in new factories and to venture on new partnerships, such as that with Watt. And Boulton, it is worth remarking, was enabled to begin his expansion on the savings of his father’s lifetime in trade. But the full employment of capital required greater banking facilities than were available in 1760. In 1750, according to Burke, there were only twelve ‘bankers’ shops’ outside London. By 1793 there were nearly 400. Credit in 1760 was organized in a small and local way. Banking was a by-product of commercial capitalism. The big¬ gest local merchant, or perhaps the local collector of the land taxes, had from time to time funds to adventure, but the area of operations was limited to the scenes and characters around their homes and the transfer of capital from a backward area to a progressive one was still slow and difficult. English industry, in such conditions, was not standing still, but neither was it in any revolutionary gallop. The Society of Arts (of 1754) had for its full title ‘The Society for the En¬ couragement of Arts, Manufacture, and Commerce’ and it, together with the Royal Society, did give active encouragement to men with new scientific ideas. But even here, once more, the French tended to anticipate England. Only in the applica¬ tion of ideas, the eradication of difficulties in practice, did England show signs of superiority. Kay’s flying shuttle2 was supported by government aid in France; nevertheless its use there died out. In England the defects of this shuttle were by 1760 being slowly but finally overcome. Even at this date, well before the advent of steam, certain prerequisites of mechanized mass production were—it is clear to eyes wise after the event—coming into existence in England. In the first place larger units of production, particularly in iron and steel, were emerging. In textiles also, even under a domes¬ tic system, the centralizing of control over cloth production in the hands of capitalists had been growing for a century. Next, one may note the increased use of machines however crude. In 1 Matthew Boulton (1728-1809), engineer and manufacturer. See also below, P- 3342 Invented about 1733.\n\nSTANDARDIZATION\n\n29\n\nBirmingham the use of the rolling mill and the stamp for producing cheaply and by unskilled labour was already com¬ mon by 1760. In the sixties water frames and home jennies were, similarly, to bring mechanized aids into textiles. Most important of all is the increase in standardization which is a marked feature of these years. Boulton studied classical designs until he picked a favourite and then impressed it upon all his buttons in an attempt to produce a uniform popular line for a world market. The very similar action of Wedgwood1 in fixing upon a best-selling pattern for his pottery is even better known. These movements towards standardized shapes preceded mass production and were essential for its coming. Furniture-making is perhaps an even better example of the point, for there mass production was a much later development. But even in furni¬ ture, though the craftsman’s skill was not to be rivalled by machine in George Ill’s reign, there was already a movement towards set styles and standards. The great names of Chippen¬ dale, Hepplewhite, and Sheraton,2 are known to everyone not for what they made but for the books of designs and styles which they published, and which in time affected the work of the humblest market-town furniture carver. Hence the name of Hepplewhite is used by any antique dealer to describe a type rather than to name a maker, and in this his historical judge¬ ment marches with his commercial acumen. These features—standardization, and larger scale production particularly—reflected a growing market. But they do not denote an ‘industrial revolution’. The greatest and oldest of English industries, textile production, was not yet concentrated in factories. Problems of bleaching and dyeing were unsolved. The advantage of Lancashire was its free labour supply un¬ trammelled by guild regulations or old traditions. It had also 1 Josiah Wedgwood (1730-95) opened a pottery of his own at Burslem, Stafford¬ shire, in 1759, and opened his new works at Etruria (where he had built a village for his workpeople) in 1769.

Manchester was expanding as a centre for cotton-making, but the units were still small and partly domestic. Woollens were far more important. But though there were some factories the typical method of production was still the domestic system. The capitalist employed families living in the Yorkshire villages to spin and weave on piece-work in their own cottages the cloth which his agent collected at the appointed time. The increasing use of machines did not at first end this dispersal of labour. For the streams of Yorkshire were used for water-power and woollen goods remained the product of the riverside villages. Some employees lived a village life entirely dependent upon their earnings in the industry: others were part-time weavers, parttime labourers in the fields. The handloom was easy to master, and it provided work for all the family. If the loom was operated on credit, or belonged to the capitalist, it could tie the operative to his master. In any case the labour force was easily expanded in prosperity and contracted in times of little demand. The most one can say of changes taking place in 1760 is that the East Anglian area of production was losing ground to Yorkshire, as swiftly flowing water became of more importance to the process of production. A similar dispersal of the labour force can be seen in the Midland nail industry. A family in a small workshop would take from the capitalist a certain quantity of iron and engage themselves to turn it into a given quantity of nails for him on the domestic hearth. In pottery, sub-contracting of this sort also prevailed even though, for convenience, the closer together the small potters’ houses were grouped the better pleased the master. Thus a row of houses tended to become a sort of factory in departments. The important pottery producers imposed their patterns but not their discipline upon those they hired. Even in the metal industries, which because they demanded more heavy equipment tended to be organized upon a factory plan, this small independent unit within a central control was prevalent. Boulton at the beginning of 1761 decided to manu¬ facture ‘various articles of the Birmingham hardware and toy trades in which a water mill was essentially necessary’, and built his famous Soho works; this has been thought a full factory in the modern sense, but study of its layout shows that it was a halfway house between the old domestic system and the new\n\nIRON AND STEEL IN 1760\n\n3i\n\norder. It was a honeycomb of small shops. It was as though the sub-contractors, the specialists in some branch of the productive process, had been brought in under the one factory roof but not thoroughly incorporated into the organization. Water again, it will be noted, determined the location of production. This was true also of the main iron and steel works. Water for working bellows and woods for charcoal were still the first needs for an ironworks in 1760. It is true that the Darbys at Coalbrookdale, in Shropshire,1 had discovered how to use clod coal for iron some time about 1710. But more than half a century had to pass before the use of coal became general, owing to the need for special kinds of coal and to the secretive¬ ness of the Darbys about their discovery. The use of coal for smelting cast iron was not general before 1770. Coal was, how¬ ever, generally used in the smithies, with the result that the Warwickshire coal supplies had attracted a population of some 500,000 dependent on metal trades to the area ten miles or so around Birmingham. Coking ovens for producing coke were, in 1763, being started. Since the 1740’s Huntsman’s2 steel crucible had opened up an expansion of steel in Sheffield: Walkers was already an important firm there. Cast iron was entering new fields as improvements in the moulds, again the result of experi¬ ment at Coalbrookdale, enabled manufacturers to extend the range of goods they made. The expansion of wrought iron had to wait some thirty years and the exploitation of Henry Cort’s2 processes. Swedish iron was still considered better for wrought-iron work, or for steel, than home-produced. It had just been decided in 1757 to encourage the import of American pig-iron through any British port (and not just to London). At the same time America was forbidden to manufacture iron goods. In 1764 iron was added to the list of enumerated com¬ modities which had to be bought from or through Great Britain. In 1761 3,000 tons of pig-iron were imported from the colonies and 44,250 tons, usually in bars, from foreigners. Though full development of iron and steel had to wait for Watt’s engines, the units of production were already large. The Carron works (near Falkirk), opened by Roebuck and Garbett the year before George III came to the throne, started with a capital of £12,000. Soon after this the Coalbrookdale works 1 For them see B. Williams, The Whig Supremacy, pp. 112, 113. 2 See below, pp. 505 f.\n\n32\n\nTHE ECONOMIC PATTERN IN 1760\n\nwere said to be employing a thousand people, including miners producing for the furnaces; the annual output from each Shrop¬ shire furnace was approaching a thousand tons. War had, in fact, already stimulated iron production: the new Wilkinson works, for instance, opened in 1762 and destined to play a leading role within thirty years in the production of metal machines and parts, were born of the stimulus of war. British industry, then, in 1760 was prosperous but not revolu¬ tionary. It had affected the way of living of thousands of people on Tyneside, Shropshire, Warwickshire, Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Staffordshire, but it was not drawing to itself the country population; it had not sapped the institutions nor affected the political attitude of Englishmen. To the industrialists the only interest of politics was that by judicious pressure they might secure protective duties or government orders for the benefit of their business. Among leading social and political figures of George Ill’s world a few had already tapped these new sources of wealth. The second Viscount Dudley and Ward, for example, found his rents increasing from ownership of twenty pits around Stourbridge, while the Wortley Montagu coal fortune was a useful adjunct to the power of Lord Bute. But this inflow of wealth to the aristocracy came mainly from their position as landowners. It did not alter, but emphasized, their attachment to broad acres as a title to power. The industrial areas of the country were governed on the pattern of the agricultural: coal, or iron, or glass, could be regarded as, so to speak, a rather special local crop which made possible larger rent rolls. Agriculture itself was undergoing great changes, but generali¬ zations cannot be made which will hold true of the whole country. The work of Jethro Tull, in drilling in rows and growing more cleanly, was still spreading very slowly over the country. The same is true of Townshend’s exploitation of marl, of artificial grasses, and of crop rotation.1 The only counties where agricultural progress was marked in 1760 were Essex, Hertfordshire, Leicestershire, Norfolk, and Suffolk. In Essex chalk fertilizers were being used and hollow drainage improved. In Hertfordshire London refuse—soot, horn-shavings, ashes, and rags—was bought for manure. It points the picture of 1 See B. Williams, The Whig Supremacy, pp. 102 and 260.\n\nAGRICULTURAL IMPROVEMENT\n\n33\n\ncontrasts that in Middlesex, even more conveniently placed for such enlightened farming, there was no such progress; one-tenth of that county was still common, its roads were bad, and its farmers unenterprising. The East Anglian improvers had already revolutionized their agriculture. There large landowners were applying scientific methods long before Coke began to plan the improvement of his properties.1 Their main achievement was in wheat growing. The ports of Yarmouth, Lynn, Wells, and Blakeney handled half the corn exported from the whole of England. With its textile industries still flourishing East Anglia was thus at the height of its prosperity and power. In another of the progressive areas the social order was different. Instead of the large proprietors talking agricultural ‘shop’ in their large country houses, in Leicestershire a great number of small and middling tenant farmers slowly improved on the ways of their grandfathers. The most famous of these farmers, Robert Bakewell,2 had been experimenting with stock-breeding for fifteen years when, in the year of George Ill’s accession, he succeeded to the complete management of his father’s farm. The improve¬ ments in stock-breeding travelled more slowly than those in arable farming. Yet by 1760 the appearance and use of horses, sheep, and cattle had been changed in Leicestershire. Bakewell replaced the old breeds of sheep, which had been of use mainly for producing wool and providing manure, with new breeds selectively reared for meat. They were animals of shorter fleece but heaviest in the best butcher’s joints. They came to their peak in two seasons instead of in three or four. In life they throve better and in death they weighed heavier. Within a half century the average weight of sheep at Smithfield rose from 28 lb. to 80 lb. Bakewell’s Leicester horses had cle"
