        "text": "September 7, 2022\n\nFeaturing some of the craziest scenes I've ever read, I don't know how this author has escaped my attention until recently.\n\nI checked out this audio from my library, immediately after finishing Those Across the River. I knew nothing about it, except that it was written by Christopher Buehlman. I'm glad that I went into it that way, because otherwise I might have passed on this story altogether.\n\nI feel I should warn people that no religion is free from mockery here, while at the same time, I feel like this is a religious, or at least a spiritual story. Being agnostic, I'm fine with that, but what I enjoyed most were the scenes of extremely imaginative horror-most times coming unexpectedly out of nowhere. I know I will be thinking about those scenes for some time to come.\n\nHighly recommended, especially the audio version, narrated by Steve West. He and this book were both amazing!\n\n*Thanks to my local public library for being awesome.*\n\nFebruary 23, 2023\n\nThis is my review space and my reading experience and this is a backlist title from 2012 so this is going to be less of traditional, critical review and more of a fucking essay on how hard I fell in love with this book.\n\nFirst, how did Buehlman get on my radar?\n\nNobody told me about his work (shame on everyone I know who has read his books but never told me). In 2020, a popular, independent bookstore (I can't remember which one) was struggling due to pandemic closures. Buehlman hosted an online event to generate awareness and funds to support the bookstore owners in their financial crisis. Some of my favorite authors were guests at this event and they mentioned Buehlman's work. This is the first time I bumped into Christopher.\n\nThe seed was planted.\n\nAt some point, Christopher offered to send me a signed copy of Between Two Fires and I accepted this generous offer. When it arrived, the cover gave me this low-fantasy, medieval, \"Game of Thrones\" vibe (and I love that when I'm in the right mood, but I wasn't).\n\nThe book sat patiently for the better part of a year or more.\n\nOctober 2021 I read classic horror for the Spooky Season and Buehlman and I discovered we were both reading, ROSEMARY'S BABY for the first time so we partnered up on it and then chatted about our experience for a video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVzT9...\n\nI decided after recording that video to read BETWEEN TWO FIRES in December as a Christmas present to myself along with Adam Nevill's CUNNING FOLK (serendipitously, Christopher was also reading that book and we just recorded another book discussion coming soon).\n\n..\n\nI read this book in December of 2021 and...\n\nIT.\n\nWAS.\n\nA.\n\nGAME CHANGER.\n\nWhat the actual fuck? How had I never heard anyone talk about this book before?? I mean, maybe I have and I just didn't know to *look* for it? I'll probably see it everywhere now like when you buy a new car and suddenly everyone drives the same car. BUT\n\nI have seen so many people do book stacks of their all-time favorite books and surely, SURELY this book would make people's lists because it will FOREVER grace my all-time favorites lists for the rest of my life. *shrugs* *takes a sip of coffee* *sighs thinking about this story*\n\nI will say that I've been dicking around on Reddit lately and Christopher Buehlman is a big deal over there. He has many fans. Die-hard ones.\n\n...\n\nOkay, *deep breath* I can talk about this now.\n\nThomas is a disgraced knight traveling with some men during the plague and wartime. These are not good men. Our story begins with these guys raping and pillaging. They are eating some poor farmer's donkey when a girl walks right up to the men and asks them to help her bury her father.\n\n*deep breath* I can't even. It's seriously difficult to talk about this book without being moved to tears.\n\nOkay, she asks the men to help her bury her father and during an interesting turn of events, the girl winds up alone with Thomas who she credits for saving her life and sparing her from being violated, but like I said, he is a disgraced knight and he is pretty broken down; his countenance and self-worth is very low. The dialogue between Thomas and the girl won me over immediately. It's funny, heartwarming, endearing...it is here, in the first few chapters, I fell head over heels in love with Thomas the Knight. He is now a forever favorite character who lives in my reader's heart. For me, this story is really about him.\n\n(FYI, in my mind, Tom Hardy played the role of Thomas quite convincingly-you're welcome)\n\nThomas and the girl (you don't learn her name until much later, so I'm leaving that out) eventually meet up with a priest who becomes a third character to fall in love with. I was so invested in the fictional lives of these three people my heart physically ached with worry for them.\n\nOn their journey, the Priest and the Knight learn more about the girl and how special she is. Thomas devotes his life to protecting her. AND I WILL NEVER FORGET THIS AMAZING BOOK.\n\nUpon finishing, I basically curled up in a ball and cried and let my heart explode with a million emotions. Goddamn this book is beautiful.\n\nA real treasure.\n\nI immediately bought everything Buehlman has out there in the world and I'll read it all.\n\nSo there it is. My personal experience with BETWEEN TWO FIRES.\n\nAll the fucking stars.\n\nOctober 23, 2021\n\nReview copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.\n\n3.5/5 stars\n\nA bleak historical fantasy/horror about life, death, faith, and hope.\n\nChristopher Buehlman is a new author to me this year. Unlike most of Buehlman’s fans, I found out about his work through reading his recently published book, The Blacktongue Thief, six months ago. Unlike his previous books, The Blacktongue Thief was his first epic fantasy book, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed reading it, especially after finding out that apparently, he has released plenty of horror novels before. Seeing how much I enjoyed his first adult fantasy book, I knew I had to give his previous books a try, even if they’re not essentially my favorite genre to read. I decided to start from Between Two Fires, and the author blessed me with a first edition of Between Two Fires to read and review. So what do I, a non-horror reader, think about this book?\n\n“How did Heaven come into all of this? Heaven was life, not death. Heaven was a woman holding your head in the crook of her arm and looking down at you. Heaven was a warm hand on your cheek and the smell of soup with garlic on the fire.”\n\nFirst of all, Between Two Fires is a bit hard to categorize; it’s a blend of horror, fantasy, and historical fiction in one package. The story takes place in the year 1348, the years of the Black Death, and it follows Thomas, a disgraced knight who found a lone young girl alone in a dead Norman village. The girl tells Thomas that the plague is just the beginning of a bigger cataclysm, the fallen angels united by Lucifer are planning to wage their war on Heaven. Earth, unfortunately, is the battleground. She tells Thomas she needs to get to Avignon to fulfill her mission. And they’re not the only two main characters; they’re also joined by a priest. Whether they succeed or not, that’s for you to find out for yourself. Between Two Fires is a bleak tale; darkness, despair, and dread accompany these characters every step of their way. What made Between Two Fires a good book, though, is not solely because of the vivid setting and atmosphere, but it’s the theme of redemption.\n\nI approached Between Two Fires expecting it will deliver me a dark story in a bleak setting, and Buehlman successfully delivered on that. Plus, several readers have also told me that this novel reminded them of Berserk by Kentaro Miura and Dark Souls video games; both are precious to me. And again, I could see why it’s interpreted that way, and I do—to a certain level—agree with them. However, I totally didn’t expect the great character development imbued into the narrative. Buehlman has mentioned that no matter the genre he writes, whether it’s horror or fantasy, plot or characters still need to work for readers. The narrative still has to be compelling, and I do enjoy reading Buehlman’s prose. This book is vastly different from The Blacktongue Thief, and I’m impressed by the range of Buehlman’s storytelling style.\n\n“Love is always harder. Love means weathering blows for another’s sake and not counting them. Love is loss of self, loss of other, and faith in the death of loss.”\n\nNow, three reasons summed up why this book didn’t receive a higher rating from me. First, the allegorical style of the story took me longer than I expected to get used to. Secondly, there were many dream sequences, and although they were great on their own, as a whole though, they ended up confusing me. I could be wrong, but I think the characters were dragged through the seven deadly sins. The main story is linear, but the way to get to the conclusion meanders quite a lot more than I expected. In a way, they’re great for character development; finding out the main character’s regret were a good choice. Lastly, I wanted the climax sequences to be more explosive. I found that it ended too quickly after all their struggle.\n\nOverall, although the execution of Between Two Fires didn’t fully click for me, I still think that this is a great book that you should try if you’re in the mood for a historical horror. One of my Booktube viewers told me that if you love reading Hellmouth by Giles Kristian, then this is worth taking a look. And yes, I do think that’s an accurate assessment. I’m mainly a fantasy reader, and that��s a huge reason why I loved The Blacktongue Thief more than Between Two Fires. Once again, I’m grateful to Buehlman for sending me this copy, and I will undoubtedly treasure it.\n\nYou can order the book from: Blackwells (Free International shipping)\n\nYou can find this and the rest of my reviews at Novel Notions | I also have a Booktube channel\n\nSpecial thanks to my Patrons on Patreon for giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!\n\nMy Patrons: Alfred, Andrew, Annabeth, Ben, Blaise, Diana, Dylan, Edward, Element, Ellen, Gary, Hamad, Helen, Jimmy Nutts, Jennifer, Joie, Luis, Lufi, Melinda, Meryl, Mike, Miracle, Neeraja, Nicholas, Oliver, ReignBro, Samuel, Sarah, Sarah, Shaad, Xero, Wendy, Wick, Zoe.\n\nMay 27, 2022\n\n“Between Two Fires” by Christopher Buehlman is a wonderful medieval horror that checks all the boxes for everything you’re looking for in such a novel. Even though there are many religious tones and references throughout this, it’s all meaningful and truly paints a diabolical picture of this era.\n\nBesides the characters that were truly memorable, I’ve never read such horrific situations in a novel in quite some time. I won’t ruin anything for you but my goodness, Christopher Buehlman really took things to some very bizarre and creepy levels. I literally had to re-read several scenes a few times because they were that scary and freaked me out!\n\nThe atmosphere, setting, dialogue, and even descriptions during that era were all brilliantly written. Even the numerous fight scenes added a nice balance to this dark story and when you put it all together, you have an amazing read. Even the cover rocks as this was a great reading experience from beginning to end as it was a genuine page-turner and then some!\n\nI give “Between Two Fires” by Christopher Buehlman a perfect 5/5 because this is easily a novel I will remember for many years to come. I look forward to reading some of his previous work and anything else he publishes in the future as I will gladly purchase because I was blown away by this one. I highly recommend this novel to anyone that loves horror with a dark, medieval, and religious twist that’s not overdone at all. The ending was perfect and even made me smile as I was in complete awe at the way this was wrapped up.\n\nOctober 25, 2023\n\nRe-Read 10/24/23:\n\nSecond read in as many years, and I'll just be honest here: it's still fucking brilliant. A roadtrip through plague-years hell, featuring demons with men's faces and souls and demons and angels of a very different sort.\n\nThis is a fantastic novel that's a Black Plague travelogue, epic fantasy, and gruesome religious horror. There are few tales that can match this one for sheer awesomeness.\n\nEnjoy the feast!\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nSo. That just happened.\n\nI'm putting this book in my unofficial six-star rating because I was blown away.\n\nI mean, after starting it, I was impressed enough with the depictions of the Black Plague in France, during the Hundred-Year's-War, the wealth of details, how religion and ignorance and fear permeated everything, but as I continued on, I was shocked at how much further we would go down the rabbit hole.\n\nIt felt like historical fiction, knee-deep in the muck, buboes, pathos, and the horror of reality. But then it got psychological, with nightmares that may or may not have been hallucinations, with fear, deviltry, and ignorance running rampant across the countryside. The empty towns, hucksters, the famine, plague, and death were barely held at bay by faith and willpower and just holding on to one or two pure things in a world that was a truly apocalyptic vision.\n\nAnd that was just one of the fires.\n\nFor anyone who has studied medieval lithographs and descriptions of devils or who have studied the Book of Enoch's descriptions of angels, you know these things are WILD. Just imagine if all these old descriptions (and not our modern versions) were crawling this French apocalypse? Playing with bodies like puppeteers, grotesque visions of torture, hellish playthings, in a nightmare scenario of the end-times and the celestial battle, all right here on Earth? Well, that's another fire.\n\nThe details in this book, the depth of the absolutely terrifying scenarios, truly scared me. And I'm an old hand at horror. I am fine with gross-outs and thrillers. This one took me down another path. It gave me no escape and dragged me through hell.\n\nI cannot recommend this enough. Or I can't recommend it at all. I'm pretty certain I'm going to have nightmares.\n\nIn other words, it's f***ing brilliant.\n\nOctober 11, 2020\n\n\"Between Two Fires\" was the first book I read by Christopher Buehlman, and I immediately went out and got all of his other work as soon as I was done with this one - but I think it is still my favorite. Set during the Black Plague, this is a strange blend of historical horror and fantasy that follows a knight turned brigand, and disgraced countryside priest and a very strange foundling who is not what she seems as they search for redemption in a hellish France.\n\nThomas used to have a comfortable enough life as a minor seigneur in Normandy, but the battle of Crécy changed everything: another lord stole his land and had him excommunicated, leaving him no choice but to scrap a living as a thief. While scrounging for food and shelter, he comes across Delphine, a young girl orphaned by the plague who tells him she must go to Paris and Avignon to see the Pope, as she has a mission to accomplish, though she cannot really explain what that means. Against his better judgement, Thomas decides to go with her, and along the road, they pick up Père Mathieu, a priest abandoned by his congregation because of certain proclivities. But the aforementioned road is fraught with perils, because they soon find out that whatever war and pestilence is taking place on Earth, it's merely a side effect of a much larger battle between angels and demons. And those demons will stop at nothing to prevent Delphine from reaching the Pope.\n\nBuehlman did his homework, and I really appreciated that he doesn't sugarcoat just how gross the Middle Ages were and how truly brutal medieval warfare was. But while there is definitely some graphic gore, the unsettling nature of his demons are, as far as I am concerned, just as upsetting. But what truly makes this book special for me is that I found it unexpectedly moving. For all of his gruff, Thomas is a broken man, desperate to get back the honor he has unjustly lost - and whatever forces drives her, Delphine is still just a girl who needs a mother's love and who still wants to play and dance, regardless of the desolation she is surrounded with. The essence of those characters never waivers, even when they are caught in the middle of a battle between Heaven and Hell.\n\nThe ending beautifully wraps up the story, and left an unforgettable bittersweet tightness in my chest as I flipped the last page.\n\nThis is a very special book, and I was really happy to buddy-read it with my bestie this year!\n\nJanuary 2, 2020\n\nWarning: this review is a somewhat organized emotional blabbering and fan-girling over a book. As usual. Includes fanart done by me...again.\n\n\"RUN!\"\n\nBetter resolution: http://gerynh.tumblr.com/post/1134336...\n\nWhen I first read the synopsis for Between Two Fires I thought: “Hmmm, a dark historical fiction, mixed with horror and religious mumbo-jumbo\". Not something I usually even consider checking up on. Then I looked at my pile of recently read books and saw way too many fairies, dragons and unicorns, so... yeah... this is what happened:\n\nSummary of the Summary\n\nThe year is 1348, the Black Death has hit the majority of the populated areas in France, food is scarce and many people have given up on their faith. Amidst all the chaos, Thomas, a disgraced knight, a peculiar orphan girl he saved and an unorthodox monk, are trying to survive not just the plague and the worst of humanity, but something far more sinister as well.\n\nWhat grabbed me (in order):\n\nWe all have different tastes, so I won't go into details. All I can say is Christopher Buehlman really knows how to pull you in! Since I wasn’t a huge fan of the characters in the beginning, it was the superb storytelling that kept me reading.\n\nYou think Katniss from Hunger Games had it hard?\n\nMUAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA!!!\n\nImagine a place where everything is dying: people, animals, crops, hope, reason. Each day, the world becomes emptier and lonelier at a frightening speed, family members are lost, none is left to tend the farms, to create music and art, to take care of the sick and the helpless. Food is the most precious commodity, but the only thing left in abundance is fear. It is what guides people to violence, to animosity, to greed and desperation. You cannot trust anyone, they'll either infect you with the plague or stab you in the back. And why even risk it, getting attached to people will only bring more pain when they die.\n\nLet me get one thing clear - I like fairytales. Some of my favorite books are children books, books about fairies and other magical creatures. Basically, happy, magical and colourful is my preferred genre. NOT HORROR! So the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed the things that Buehlman's mind sprouted in this book is a completely new feeling for me.\n\nMy first impression of the three main characters: the girl annoyed me, the monk bored me and I damn-right despised Thomas. And yet, they grew on me! With all of their flaws and shortcomings, they felt so real, they faced their fears and desires, they changed and sacrificed so much for each other. I truly admired their character development which was perfectly paced and actually quite believable!\n\n[image error]\n\nAngels. If you grabbed this book, because you read this word in the synopsis, then let me warn you: these are not the dashing young winged men and women from your favorite YA novels (thank God!), or anything that might possess human mentality and desires. The Angels and the Demons are like an embodiment of what is respectively good and evil. So with this out of the way... THIS BOOK was so freaking magnificent! We don't get to see the angels or the devils that often, but once they appear, they mean business! Their scenes are breathtaking, you can feel their other-ness, the unfathomable proportions, their limitless nature...Honestly, I am running out of synonyms in Thesaurus, so let's just say - they are FREAKING EPIC!\n\nPersonal Theory\n\nI mentioned this in my reading progress notes, but I will mention it here again. I have a very strong feeling that the different places our characters pass by correspond to the 9 circles of hell. It is extremely subtle and I might be wrong, but it's so brilliant! We see our three heroes facing lust, gluttony, greed, anger, heresy, violence, fraud and treachery not only in other people but in themselves as well. The only circle missing I think is the first one - Limbo (phew, that would've been awkward...)\n\nThe Audiobook Narrator\n\nSteve West = pure perfection! 10 out of 5 stars!\n\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:\n\n3 THINGS\n\nA Very Personal Opinion, feel free to disagree.\n\nLook at that cover! Isn't it absolutely beautiful and professional! But does it scream: READ ME NOW! Not to me, I'm afraid. If I didn't know better, I would've thought it's the cover of yet another 1000+ pages historical report of some unimportant war that happened long time ago and only a small group of people care about. Oh, if that was the case, this cover would definitely sell! But this book is about so much more: it has feelings, imagination, action, drama - it deserves a cover that will hint of its uniqueness and the adventure it will put you through. The current one is just too generic for my liking.\n\nPlus, I acknowledge the fact that the artist might not have been given an accurate and detailed brief or a reasonable deadline (and payment? You never know)!\n\nThe other two are both Major spoilers, so no peaking if you haven't read the book yet!\n\n2. I kind of wish we got a little more scenes with the angels towards the end. Don't get me wrong, I totally loved the balance between fantasy and realism and I was pretty happy with the conclusion. But what I missed was the unpredictability of the final showdown. I would've preferred if both sides were more evenly matched to make the battle more exciting.\n\n3. My major disappointment however was that we didn't see Lucifer in the end... (The scene with him/her falling doesn't count). I mean, if there is going to be a war between Heaven and Hell and the main battle is happening in Avignon at that moment, why isn't the whole fallen angels army there? What are they doing? They couldn't even conquer Heaven with God, Michael and the rest of the more powerful archangels out of their way! I am so disappointed in Hell! And why did Lucifer fall in the very end? All it did for me is wonder whether Mr. Buehlman will ever write a sequel and give us more info. …hint hint…\n\nConclusion\n\nI love you, book! I do not understand how come you're not as popular as The Da Vinci code, and yet I also don't want people to know about you so you can be special and discovered only by a few chosen ones and then we can all worship your awesomeness and glorify your existence in private...Uh-hum, yeah...check it out if you want.\n\n[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>\n\nMay 5, 2022\n\nI finished my audio re-read of this book last night when I got home from work. I sat in the car and listened to the last 10 minutes. Not gonna lie, there were tears in my eyes.\n\nMy rating remains at 5 stars, but I'd give it 10 if I could.\n\nMay 12, 2022\n\nFirst off, thanks to Ginger for moving the fire from \"between\" to under my butt to read this. (I'll see myself out).\n\nThis book checked a ton of boxes I didn't realize I had; it's historical fiction, fantasy, and horror, and somehow it works wonderfully!\n\nThe author took the time to get a lot of the historical setting correct, and this went a long way for someone like me who, predominantly until last year, was solely a military history reader. In addition, the story itself is excellently told, with multiple perspectives without getting confusing and relatively original, in my opinion.\n\nI also really enjoyed how the author blends actual historical things (Like Clement's call to the Crusades and the Plague) into the real story with how basically hell has free reign upon the earth. Almost like the horrible things humankind does to each other...is missing the greater purpose of life. Imagine that. I appreciated the subtle philosophical filter the story is told through.\n\nThe only charge I could level against it would be the ending is pretty predictable in terms of the main story, but besides costing it one star, this is not a detriment.\n\nNovember 8, 2015\n\nI'm in awe. Simply amazing. I experienced such a range of emotions reading this and almost wept at the end. Beautiful, lyrically and poetic but also scary, grimy and terrifying. An incredible writer with serious talent.\n\nOctober 26, 2012\n\nIt's just that kind of book. And I mean that in the most positive, enthusiastic way possible. HOLY 'EFFING SHIT. THIS IS AN EPIC BOOK THAT LEAVES YOU SLACK-JAWED AND QUEASY.\n\nLarge disclaimer: Keep your kids away from this book. Like, away away. If you don't want them terrified to sleep, terrified to die, terrified of monsters, and using foul, foul, foul language, keep them AWAY away. Keep your faint of heart virginal readers away. Only start the quest if you intend to see it through. Because HOLY SHIT THIS BOOK WAS UNEXPECTEDLY, AMAZINGLY GREAT. Horror fans, medieval history fans, end-of-days fans, literary fans, hey - this book's for you.\n\nNightmare inducing dream sequences (leaving you and the characters of the book questioning reality). Dark, dark stuff. Hell unleashes the demons and Buehlman unleashes the suspense, horror and gore. A Knight-turned-theif/criminal meets a young girl orphaned by the plague. Together, they travel across a barren landscape filled with death and monsters of unbelievable proportions. A third man joins the quest, a wine-loving, disgraced Father who has homosexual proclivities. I really can't say anything further - because I went into the book with minimal knowledge and I was stunned by the quality of this tale. An instant re-read. Possibly one of my new favorites.\n\nAnd this is coming from someone who doesn't have too much more than a minimal interest in the medieval genre. Or fantasy really. But horror - horror LITERARY fiction - THIS I CAN GET BEHIND.\n\n...It's not often that I pull a three-lolcat review, but, this book was epic and deserves all the lolcats in the world to describe its awesomeness. I rarely type in all capital letters, but let's face it, the book was...\n\nTHANK YOU CHRISTOPHER BUEHLMAN AND ACE BOOKS. I've already added his first novel Those Across the River to my to-read list.\n\nAnd finally. Goodreads friends - someone here read this book because we need to talk about the ending. Like, I have a desperate need to discuss this. So, hurry, scurry, go read. Then, WE DISCUSS.\n\nAugust 16, 2024\n\n\"Quella pestilenza strappava via la finzione e rivelava l'anima delle persone con la stessa sicurezza con cui alla fine rivelava le loro ossa\"\n\nFrancia 1348.\n\nLa Grande Morte è giunta ed ha aperto le porte al Mietitore che raccoglie indisturbato il suo triste raccolto di anime e carne. L'Europa è allo sbando, la peste ricopre di morti le strade, la razza umana è degenerata agli istinti animali, tra paura, lotta per la sopravvivenza e attesa della fine dei tempi, mettendo in mostra le sue peggiori e squallide attitudini.\n\nPreparate lo stomaco perché il signor Buehlman non ci va leggero, descrivendo il periodo storico senza riserve e strizzando l' occhio anche a situazioni ed elementi weird e horror proponendo un dark fantasy di tutto rispetto.\n\nTre sopravvissuti si trovano per caso e iniziano un viaggio, forse di speranza e redenzione, forse no, ormai nulla ha più importanza.\n\nSeguiremo da vicino un brigante dal cuore tenero ma dai modi bruschi , un prete alcolista senza più un gregge e una giovane orfana che nasconde strane capacità. Tutti alla ricerca di una luce, perché è di speranza che ci si nutre quando tutto il resto va in malora. Tre individui molto diversi che creeranno durante il viaggio un rapporto di conforto e unità.\n\nIl Paradiso è in guerra.\n\nUna guerra tra Angeli e Demoni con un Dio silenzioso e assente che sembra aver abbandonato le sue creature alla follia e al male. E quando Dio non guarda, l'inferno apre le porte e lascia uscire i suoi demoni. Ed è per questo che il trio inizia ad affrontare eventi soprannaturali che li mineranno e li proveranno nel corpo e nell' anima. Formiche in un conflitto tra giganti.\n\nUn romanzo forse non adatto a tutti a causa del tono prettamente dark e gretto che non fa sconti a nessuno e non devia mai. Un affresco nero di paura e fuga, eppure consigliato agli amanti del fantastico di qualità.\n\nUna lettura da non perdere che mi ha ricordato, tra l'altro, \"la Strada\" di McCarthy e il \"Berserk\" di Miura. Vi sembra poco?\n\nPS: peccato per l'edizione, stampata con troppi refusi, meritava di meglio.\n\n--------------------------\n\n\"That plague tore away the fiction and revealed the souls of the people with the same certainty with which it finally revealed their bones\"\n\nFrance 1348.\n\nThe Great Death has arrived and opened the doors to the Reaper who undisturbed collects his sad harvest of flesh and souls. Europe is in disarray, the plague covers the streets with dead and the human race has degenerated to animal instincts, between fear, the fight for survival and waiting for the end of time, showing off its worst and squalid attitudes.\n\nPrepare your stomachs because Mr. Buehlman does not go lightly, describing the historical period without reservations and winking at weird and horror situations and elements, proposing a dark fantasy of all respect.\n\nThree survivors meet by chance and begin a journey, perhaps of hope and redemption, perhaps not, now nothing matters anymore.\n\nWe will closely follow the path of a bandit with a tender heart but brusque manners, an alcoholic priest without a flock and a young orphan who hides strange abilities. All in search of a light, because it is hope that we feed on when everything else goes to waste. Three individuals very distant from each other who will create a relationship of comfort and unity during the journey.\n\nHeaven is at war.\n\nA war between Angels and Demons with a silent and absent God who seems to have abandoned his creatures to madness and evil. And when God is not looking, hell opens its doors and lets its demons out. And that is why the trio begins to face supernatural events that will undermine them and test them in body and soul. Ants in a conflict between giants.\n\nA novel perhaps not suitable for everyone due to the purely dark and narrow tone that does not give anyone discounts and never deviates. A black fresco of fear and escape, yet recommended to lovers of quality fantasy.\n\nA must-read that reminded me, among other things, of \"The Road\" by McCarthy and \"Berserk\" by Miura. Does that seem like little to you?\n\nPS: shame about the edition, printed with too many typos, it deserved better.\n\nMay 23, 2020\n\nI want to use the word allegory even though I am not entirely sure of its meaning. This was an allegory of Satan's rebellion against the Heavens here on Earth, an explanation for the Great Plague, famine and war that swept France (and Europe) during the 14 th century. This is a Dante-esque version of Hell on Earth. It is fantastical, dark, violent. The demons and monsters were throughly creepy ( I'm glad there was no one to see the faces I caught myself pulling during certain scenes of this book!)\n\nThis was a work of wonderful historical fiction, set in brutal and violent times, which completely captures the medieval sensibility of superstition and fear of the supernatural embedded in the mindset of a world without science or education. It genuinely feels like the End of Days, captures exactly the mood of Revelations.\n\nStrongly recommended, but be warned the language and images are quite blasphemous\n\nMay 23, 2022\n\n4 stars of plague infested madness!\n\nBetween Two Fires is a blend of historical fiction with fantasy and horror elements thrown in. I enjoyed the bleak look into 1348 when a plague has destroyed most of Europe.\n\nAs the plague ransacks the population, communities and small towns are in utter despair as they believe God has turned his back on them. They believe Lucifer and his Demons are in full control and they're not exactly wrong on this assessment.\n\nSinister things are hunting the cobblestone streets at night, terrifying creatures are lurking in lakes and rivers, and people are not what they seem to be.\n\nI think Christopher Buehlman really shines in character development and this book was another great example of that.\n\nI would have rated this a bit higher but for a few reasons.\n\n1. I wanted more tension at the end. The book is building and building for a final showdown of good vs evil and it didn’t deliver as much “epicness” as I would have liked.\n\n2. I thought some of the dream sequences were a bit confusing and I wondered at times where this sequence was really taking me.\n\nOverall, I still enjoyed this one and loved the horror elements in Paris and along the countryside.\n\nThere is some fantastic imagery going on in Between Two Fires and I'm very glad to finally read this one!\n\nJanuary 1, 2024\n\nOggi vi parlo di “Tra due fuochi”, libro autoconclusivo scritto da Christopher Buehlman e autopubblicato in Italia grazie al lavoro di Francesco Vitellini, traduttore dell’opera. Si tratta di un romanzo storico con forti contaminazioni Dark Fantasy.\n\nEuropa, anno del Signore 1348. La Francia è squassata dalla guerra dei cent’anni e, come se non bastasse, la Grande Mietitrice sta per abbattere la propria falce con rinnovata crudeltà. Arriva la peste nera. Buehlman rivisita uno dei periodi più bui della storia europea ponendolo come conseguenza di un feroce conflitto celeste. Angeli e Caduti si sfidano alle porte del cielo e sulle spoglie della terra, l’essere umano, ignaro di tutto, soffre e perisce.\n\nLa preparazione storica dell’autore è encomiabile, avvenimenti, usi e costumi sono curati nel dettaglio e rendono l’ambientazione affascinante e coinvolgente. Uno scenario apocalittico che trasuda paura e disperazione. Villaggi abbandonati, città deserte, briganti senza scrupoli, ciechi fanatici, sopravvissuti inermi, corpi in decomposizione. Troverete un’atmosfera di forte impatto.\n\nLa storia segue il punto di vista di tre personaggi: Thomas, violento cavaliere caduto in disgrazia, Delphine, ragazza determinata e curiosa che nasconde un grande potere, Matthieu, prete afflitto dal senso di colpa. Inizialmente ho trovato una scrittura un po’ fredda e distaccata che mi ha impedito di legare subito con i personaggi. Tuttavia, il viaggio che questi intraprendono attraverso una Francia agonizzante appassiona pagina dopo pagina e li caratterizza in maniera sfaccettata. Il loro è un percorso di accettazione e rinascita, emozionante e commovente.\n\nLa narrazione, fluida e scorrevole, può sembrare episodica, composta da tanti avvenimenti poco collegati tra loro. Questi non sono altro che piccoli tasselli di un mosaico più grande che verrà svelato soltanto alla fine. “Tra due fuochi” è un romanzo immaginifico e surreale, un romanzo da leggere!\n\nNovember 18, 2017\n\nNever has it been made more clear than in 'Between Two Fires' the genre category of apocalyptic religious literature is at its heart nothing but a fantastically imaginative horror story waiting to be shaped for modern readers. The myths of historical (maybe that should be 'hysterical') Christianity were simply needing the right storyteller to reveal the true face of the Apocalypse in all its gory glory! He is here! Have you been looking for another writer who is a satisfying successor to Stephen King's glorious horror writing in his early years in his career? I am happy to introduce author Christopher Buehlman!\n\nWhat is the plot of 'Between Two Fires'? Steal the hallucinatory imagery and tone of the King James Bible Version of the book of Revelation, stir in the story of the tremendous war between angels lifted from The Book of Enoch, and synthesize all with the vivid imaginative hellish additions by the Catholic artists and Church functionaries of the Middle Ages along with the satirical scripts by coke-fueled writers of 1980's Hollywood horror movies. Put all of those centuries of prior apocalyptic scriptwriting through Christopher Buehlman's (playfully devilish, I have no doubt about it) high-end literary cuisinart of a brain. Voila! 'Between Two Fires' is created - a dark Christian fairy tale of 1348 with so much Good and Evil comeuppance it will literally throttle all objections the most morally punitive of us need to be happy in our relationships (particularly Protestant evangelicals), as well as yet somehow tickle the fancy of those of us with more cynical atheist leanings, at least those of us atheists with literary tastes.\n\nChristopher Buehlman is now one of my favorite authors. Clearly he is a dark-myth specialist of the highest caliber, specializing in remixing common First World horror genre tropes and stereotypes into literary writers' territory, like King's American nightmare stories and Neil Gaiman's Anglicized Norse horrors. He is molding these ancient European monster myths into something awfully wonderful - if demons, bloody graphic (medium graphic - um, well, mostly) violence and zombie hunts satisfy you, gentle reader. He plays it straight on the page, honoring the horror, yet I can sense the delighted grin of the author behind every word!\n\nA real apocalypse did occur in 1348 - the Black Death. Buehlman did not need to exaggerate the historical effects of this plague on cities, French farmers or the European economy very much in his book. In the very real world of the late Middle Ages at least a third of the population In Europe died from the plague, if not more. I suggest reading The Great Mortality: An Intimate History of the Black Death, the Most Devastating Plague of All Time for further information.\n\nFor those of you who have read this novel, my favorite character was the knight Thomas de Givras because all of his sins were caused by despair and outrage. He did not take any pleasure from his worst debauches; instead, he felt more and more worthless. He was vividly aware each step into depravity brought him more feelings of hopelessness. He was the most complex, yet most easily diagnosed, character in the novel. It was his soul that was representing humanity's general plight and psychology most of all.\n\nThe homosexual priest, the character Matthieu Hanicotte, was another example of a Good many in society refuse to have; many people in the book would rather damn themselves than to recognize Hanicotte as a good man. Hanicotte was a favorite of mine, too.\n\nNo other character in the novel was more realistic to me than the knight with his moral agony, suffering and rage. Clearly the character God had deserted the earth and, in doing so, had removed almost all barriers which kept the powerful demons in check and in Hell. Every insane evil the humans and bad Angels felt like indulging could be done so with increasing impunity. Thomas WAS duped by his faith in Goodness and Honor and the promise of God's support on earth. Survival did actually mean people often had to be morally bad to live, while the plague killed everyone whether they were morally nice or bad. For a people who believed God was supposed to direct every scene and event, and/or who placed tests of morality in front of folks in order to decide whether people would be rewarded or punished because of their choices, the sudden disappearance of Good was demoralizing, so to speak, in every sense. God had enforced Good; but if Good was no longer enforced or mattered, then did it mean God was gone?\n\nIn the novel, Hell's doors opened to let out demons with powerful magic to harm the good and bad, so demons were ravaging all of humanity just because they could. Clearly God was gone. Wasn't anyone left in charge of Heaven? Even the few good Angels left seem confused and overpowered by the regime change. Perhaps there is one left who might restore order and Good, one who is willing to drag out an old plan which worked before. Could it work again, if modified a little?\n\nIn the real world, the Great Death of 1347 actually did serve to loosen the more rigid structures of religion and rituals that held almost everyone tightly to faith. The Great Death was indiscriminate in killing people. It killed the righteous along with those who refused to live in godly ways. Christianity was no longer felt to be the dependable safe harbor it had been believed to be after the plague ran its course. Something obviously was wrong with the teachings of the Church; the talismans which supposedly protected people (holy water, Saints' bones, priest blessings, etc.) did not seem to have any power after all. For some, the question of what was the point of being SO religious if people died anyway suffering horribly no matter what? It was a time of much internal and external doubt in Christianity, which has continued ever since.\n\nApril 9, 2024\n\nAstoundingly vivid imagery, surprisingly emotional beats, morally grey characters, eldritch abominations, psychedelic sequences, and most of all, at one point there is someone who is between two fires. (This is of course the most important part)\n\nThis was SO GOOD!!! If you’re okay with a plot that is a bit meandering and that doesn’t do much in the way of explaining what’s happening but through context clues and suggestive dialogue, then this is for you. It’s dark, it’s brutal, it’s twisted - and it’s also got hints of hope and redemption. It’s got tenderness and kindness amidst the horror.\n\nI’ve heard people compare this to Dark Souls and Bloodborne and I would agree - to the extent of the aesthetic and monster designs of the story. But this is a character driven book at its core, and that separates it somewhat from those stories.\n\nLoved it. A number of scenes are ingrained in my brain already. I need to dive into the rest of Buehlmann’s work because he has such a refreshing voice and style!\n\nFebruary 5, 2017\n\nReview Posted on Tenacious Reader\n\nHoly Hell. This book. I’m not even sure where to begin. I found this in my library’s audiobook selection. Gave it a closer look as it seemed to be neither YA nor PNR. That’s quite an unusual (and desirable) find given my library’s more typical offerings. I went to check out what others thought of it on Goodreads. And. NONE of my 100+ genre reading Goodreads friends have read it. Seriously? This made me have some doubts. Surely if it was worth a read, someone would have read it by now. I mean, I think I read a lot, but I don’t even come close to going through books like some of my pals on Goodreads. But, it sounded interesting, and it cost me nothing but a bit of time to check it out. I figured if I didn’t like it I could just find something else, no harm done.\n\nBut I never lost interest. Instead I was pulled in to what I first thought was going to be more of a Historical Fiction type of book with just a bit of Fantasy bend to it. And it definitely is a historical fiction setting/feel with beautifully crafted prose that flows easily. The story takes place in France, the year is 1348 and the land and people are ravaged with plague. Just the plague is horrifying enough. Then add in war and the cruelties of mankind. The book made it clear, this was quite a dreadful time and place to live.\n\nOh, but don’t stop there. Let’s bring in the supernatural. And not in a typical fantasy type of way, with dragons soaring overhead, or sorcery being tossed about, but more in a lurking, terrifying, perhaps rip you asunder, you don’t know what the hell just hit you (or them) kind of way. And then beyond the gore, there is also the daunting presence of something else, some otherworldly beings dipping their hand into the works, trying to control the affairs of men to serve who knows what hidden agenda. This book is creepy. This book is violent. This book is FREAKIN FANTASTIC! And no, not just because it is creepy and violent. It’s how the characters and the setting and the creepy parts all worked together. It just seemed to find an excellent balance. This is also not a book for the faint of heart.\n\nI really enjoyed the character Thomas, a fallen knight that has been traveling with some quite despicable brigands. But then he meets a girl; an orphaned girl living alone with her father’s corpse. But, something about this girl is different. She sees things and knows things that are beyond explanation. I absolutely love the dynamic between Thomas and this girl. I hate to say too much more for fear of spoilers. But trust me, this is a journey I won’t soon forget.\n\nThis book was an unexpectedly wonderful and terrifying find. Like I said before, if you are squeamish, or shy away from books with rape or graphic violence, put this book on your never read list. But for those of you like me that are fans of dark and gritty fantasy, definitely add this one to your list. It is well worth the read.\n\nAnd a quick mention for the audiobook format, it was excellent. The narrator did a marvelous job with the suspense and using just the right inflections on words to get across any dark humor. A book depends heavily on the narrator’s ability to be turned into a successful audiobook and as much as I loved this book, he obviously did a fantastic job.\n\nMay 15, 2023\n\nThis perfectly scratches the historical/fantasy/horror itch I never knew I had. Seriously, moving forward I forsee myself being hard pressed to find anything that comes close to the level of creativity while still being firmly rooted in the (well-researched I might add) times.\n\nOff the bat, Buehlman has an amazing mastery of dialogue and characterization, whereas with other authors I might roll my eyes at the sight of multiple pages worth of dialogue. Even side characters our trio meet only once in passing are fleshed out with distinct personalities.\n\nThe story is episodic, we see the characters go through trials over the span of many months, so nothing is held onto too preciously. While this may not be everyone's cup of tea and there definitely were scenes and sequences I wish had been more fleshed out, an epic quest of this nature could easily swing the other way with an over-bloated page count.\n\nOctober 26, 2023\n\nSo this just happened. I have a theory ... if I'm correct, it changes the entire novel.\n\nThe plague years. Somewhere in France, a disgraced knight meets a girl and saves her from being raped. From then on, they travel the ravaged land where there is almost nothing to eat and other people are dangerous either due to them being ill or savage or greedy. And then there are the angels. Honest-to-God (excuse the pun) angels. Fallen and otherwise.\n\nI LOVE roadtrip stories and I LOVE plague novels. There is something cozy about the contrictive, almost claustrophobic vibe, the fear of absolutely everything, the ingenuity it usually takes the characters (making homes, leaving again, finding food and medicine etc), the realisation that no matter how devastating a catastrophy is happening to a person, what other humans do to them will be worse.\n\nSo of course I loved this. However, I wasn't prepared for just HOW MUCH I'd love this. I was marveling at the characterization of every person here, important or otherwise. I reveled in the interludes that told of the angels battling and God not reacting at all, it nevertheless making it clear that there IS a supernatural element in this tale. I enjoyed hating most people here and cheering whenever Thomàs swore. I even liked rolling my eyes at the turn-the-other-cheek bullshit Delphine kept spouting. *lol*\n\nThe writing was superb. Apparently, this is a debut novel. If that is true, Buehlman must have poured everything of himself into it. I've read other works by this author and while they weren't bad at all, they didn't stand a chance of coming close to this mastery.\n\nMost of all, though, I was impressed how the author took a well-established time period and twisted it to his own heart's desire. Real-life historical events were thrown in with a desolate landscape where monsters swam in streams and supernatural elements sneaked in through the cracks (that feast with the one Pope and what they were actually consuming as well as how it all gave birth to the Fallen), making for a deliciously uncomfortable atmosphere of foreboding, greyness, ruin, and despair. In short: horror. But horror at its finest.\n\nAnd then came the finale. I had been wondering how the author would end it all. However, what the author made the characters and readers succumb to was twisted! My theory is that this wasn't the real world at all but a mirror image with an endless cycle of pain and hopelessness ... limbo or purgatory or whatever you wanna call it - and who knows how many times the characters have experienced the same torment already!* If that is true, the author is a sick fuck and I love it! :D\n\nLooking back at the beginning of the book through the eyes of someone knowing everything from the middle and the end makes me shudder - perfect for Spooktober!\n\n* Alternatively, this was all a plague-induced nightmare, them losing their minds after everything that's happened to them and the sickness taking over, imaginging the monsters and angels or mistaking real-life things for supernatural elements as their ailing minds were trying to make sense of it all. But I like my first theory much better and it would fit better with the rest of the author's writing.\n\nJuly 1, 2021\n\nI don’t write reviews.\n\nThis was amazing. It takes a few chapters to get rolling, but from there it’s on. The story was unpredictable! Things became incredibly weird and even a bit scary. The creepy dread of the journey was delightful.\n\nI adored the main characters. By the end, I found I cared deeply for Thomas and Delphine. So much happens that I couldn’t possibly tell you in a way befitting the simple beauty of this tale. Life, love, death, birth, punishment, redemption, demons, angels, god, innocence, evil, and much much more.\n\nJanuary 31, 2018\n\nΤο βιβλίο το ανακάλυψα εντελώς απροσδόκητα, και μπήκε αμέσως σε εκείνη την λίστα των ελάχιστων βιβλίων που περίμενα να διαβάσω με λαχτάρα. Με μια εμμονική προσήλωση κοίταζα τον τίτλο του, τον χάιδευα με τα μάτια, βασανίζοντας τον εαυτό μου, αναβάλλοντας την ανάγνωση για όταν θα ήθελα ένα βιβλίο που θα ήταν πργματικά απολαυστικό, όταν οι λογής πειραματισμοί μου θα ήταν τελματωμένοι˙ όταν θα ήθελα ποιοτική και λαχταριστή ανάγνωση. Μα ήταν τελικά τόσο καλό;\n\nΠριν και κατά την διάρκεια της ανάγνωσης ανακάλυψα πως ο Buehlman έχει μια ενδιαφέρουσα λίστα από βιβλία που κανέναν δεν ��οιάζει με το άλλο, αλλά όλα όμως μοιράζονται μια κλίση προς το σκοτεινό και το βίαιο. Κάτι που επιβεβαίωνε αυτό το ευανάγνωστο κράμα μεσαιωνικού μυθιστορήματος με φανταστική λογοτεχνία που είχα ξεκινήσει να διαβάζω. Ο Buehlman μπορεί να αποπροσανατολίσει τον μέσο αναγνώστη: είναι άγνωστο από που εφορμά – του αρέσουν ο Άρχοντας των Δαχτυλιδιών; Ή μήπως προτιμά το Όνομα του Ρόδου; Η γραφή του και η προσέγγισή του μου θύμισε τον Ken Follet από το Pillars of the Earth, με αρκετή δόση προσεγμένου χιούμορ. Ή αυτό που εγώ προσλαμβάνω ως καλή αίσθηση της πραγματικότητας και του τσίρκου που αποκαλούμε ζωή. Ο μεσαίωνας του Buehlman είναι πραγματικά ζωντανός, η βρωμιά και η εξαθλίωση, ο μαύρος θάνατος που αποδεκατίζει σαν ραπανάκια τον πληθυσμό της Ευρώπης – μια ζοφερή πραγματικότητα που ο συγγραφέας παρουσιάζει με αξιοθαύμαστη λεπτομέρεια αλλά και εξόχως λεπτεπίλεπτη εγκράτεια. Η ερευνά του –οι σύντομες ευχαριστίες στο τέλος καλύπτουν ένα τεράστιο έυρος που καταμαρτυρά έναν πραγματικό ερευνητή και άνθρωπο με ποικίλα ενδιαφέροντα- είναι ενδελεχής αλλά εξυπηρετεί μόνο την υπόθεση. Κάπου σε όλη την ταραχή κλιμακώνεται η επικυριαρχία των έκπτωτων άγγελων επί της γης. Ένας ξεπεσμένος ιππότης και μια κοπελίτσα που φαίνεται να είναι κάτι παραπάνω από αυτό που δείχνει, ακολουθούν έναν ασαφή σκοπό για να σώσουν τον κόσμο. Αυτή είναι συνοπτικά η υπόθεση και αν θέλει κανείς παραπάνω να διαβάσει το βιβλίο.\n\nΤι εξυπηρετούν οι βαθμολογίες άραγε; Θέλω να πω, βαθμολογούμε για τον εαυτό μας, για έναν υποψήφιο αναγνώστη αποτρεπτικά/ενθαρρυντικά; Μήπως για να βάλουμε σε τάξη των κυκεώνα αναγνωσμάτων μας; Αυτά τα τρία αστέρια μπορεία να φαντάζουν λίγα για ένα τόσο καλογραμμένο βιβλίο, του οποίου το μόνο που του έλειπε ήταν μια απρόσκοπτη εθιστική ροή. Ο Buehlman γράφει ένα βιβλίο που συνεχώς διατρανώνει τις συγγραφικές του αρετές και οι στιγμές που άφηνα το βιβλίο ελαφρώς αδιάφορα ήταν αρκετές. Οι χαρακτήρες ήταν καλογραμμένοι, οι διάλογοι εξαιρετικοί, η περιγραφή μιας δυσώδους μεσαιωνικής ευρώπης έξοχη. Για αυτά όλα καθώς και για τα εξώφυλλα από τα επόμενα βιβλία του που υπόσχονται σκοτεινές περιπέτειες με βαμπίρ και νεκρομάντηδες, έχω πει πως θα διαβάσω όλα του τα βιβλία – έτσι λέω τώρα και αυτό σημαίνει πολλά για μένα.\n\nΈνα τριάστερο βιβλίο και μια γνωριμία με έναν πολλά υποσχόμενο συγγραφέα.\n\nFebruary 10, 2017\n\nReseña en español más abajo.\n\nOne of the best books I've read this year.\n\nBetween Two Fires is a perfect mixture of horror, dark fantasy and historical fiction. When I started reading this book I've my doubts about what was the big deal about the so-called horror scenes that the reviewers mentioned... but trust me, it doesn't take many chapters for some very fucked up satanic sh*t to happen.\n\nThe characters of this book are awesome: a fallen and dishonored knight, a young girl whose father died due to the Black Plague, and a sinful drunkard priest travel together across the Medieval France destroyed by the pest and swarmed by demons who hide under human skin.\n\nIf you love the genres that I mentioned above this book is a must read. I enjoyed this read immensely and I totally recommend it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nPuedes encontrar esta y otras reseñas en mi blog.\n\nLlegué a enterarme de la existencia de Between Two Fires mientras buscaba libros que combinaran terror y fantasía, dos de mis géneros literarios favoritos. Este libro llamó mi atención de inmediato porque, además de mezclar ambos géneros, está ambientado en la Edad Media, durante la etapa más dura de la Peste Negra.\n\nEs común encontrar dentro de la fantasía libros que recurren a elementos un tanto morbosos y violentos, pero ninguno me ocasionó verdadero pavor... hasta que leí este libro. He leído una gran cantidad de historias de terror bastante jodidas, pero mientras leía Between Two Fires sentí verdadero miedo debido a la cantidad de escenas desagradables que los personajes se encuentran a lo largo de su viaje.\n\nLo primero que me llamó la atención fue lo bien que Buehlman describe la Francia medieval arrasada por la Peste Negra. Sin llegar a convertirse en una novela histórica \"pesada\", es decir, llena de detalles acerca de las costumbres y edificios de la época, el autor logró reflejar la desesperación y el caos provocados por una de las mayores epidemias en la historia de la humanidad. Muchas descripciones resultan perturbadoras no solo por ser bastante gráficas, sino por cómo afectan a los diferentes personajes, que sienten impotencia ante la plaga que está aniquilando a todos sus seres queridos y su forma de vida.\n\nPero sin lugar a dudas lo que resulta más perturbador en este libro son los demonios y los monstruos. Muchas escenas están tan bien escritas que es como leer la transcripción de una pesadilla; por momentos me transmitió la misma sensación que tuve al leer la Divina Comedia, solo que en en este caso los demonios torturan a los humanos por placer y no por el mero hecho de castigarlos. Fue mi parte favorita de este libro, solo que en cierto punto se vuelve un poco repetitivo: a pesar de que los demonios son variados, conforme avanza la historia se va perdiendo el factor sorpresa.\n\nEl ingrediente de fantasía oscura se lo dan los personajes. Tanto Thomas como la joven huérfana son protagonistas \"rotos\", con pasados muy trágicos y complicados que son revelados lentamente; hasta las últimas páginas no llegamos a conocer del todo a los personajes y eso es algo muy bueno, porque hizo que me mantuviera enganchado hasta el final. Además, al haber tan pocos protagonistas, uno llega a encariñarse mucho con los personajes y a preocuparse por ellos.\n\nCalificación 9/10\n\nBetween Two Fires es un libro muy entretenido que se lee como una versión actualizada de la divina comedia, pero con la impronta de un autor que logra combinar terror y fantasía de forma magistral.\n\nSi bien en cierto momento la trama se vuelve un poco repetitiva, es un libro lleno de momentos escalofriantes, personajes muy interesantes y un excelente final.\n\nLo recomiendo a todos los fanáticos de los libros de fantasía oscura y de terror, sinceramente el estilo de Buehlman es excelente y me dejó una muy buena impresión. El próximo libro de Buehlman que pienso leer es una novela de terror titulada \"Los del otro lado\", es la única novela de este autor que ha sido traducida al español por el momento.\n\nDecember 28, 2015\n\nThis book is hard to classify. I've put it under fantasy (definitely), Alternate-History (sort of as it's full of supernatural happenings, maybe fantasy-history but I don't have a shelf for that), Horror (yes plus terror and also gross-outs). I didn't put it on the Christian theology shelf though there are some lessons here and I think many Christians will find the book...here comes that word....interesting.\n\nI went 4 stars here and it's in many ways very close to a 5 star read. There are some things that keep me from going to the complete 5, but that doesn't mean the book isn't excellent.\n\nSo, where'd the extra star (or at least part of a star) go? That will require a little discussion below but there are some basics I can make you aware of first.. things you should know going in. Some readers this won't bother at all....others will be glad to know it.\n\nFirst language. The book is full of foul language and that includes blasphemy. Note that the blasphemy is not frivolous, it's part of the story. This book deals with a world in which the worst of humanity is the par and the rest is worse than par. Just be aware going in that you're about to embark on a journey where murder, theft, rape, and all that's evil, bloody, mucus smeared, stinking and dung covered is the norm. It's not a pleasant world.\n\nI mentioned Christian theology earlier. This book is about a second attempt of Satan (the name Lucifer is used) to overthrow heaven and at the same time to turn Earth into an annex of Hell.\n\nOkay first off advice I've given before...DON'T GET YOUR THEOLOGY FROM FANTASY NOVELS. Now, that said, there are some good lessons here. For non-Christians this will obviously not be an issue. For Christians what you'll find here is a profound misunderstanding or maybe more likely a profound disregard of actual Christian theology. However I don't think the story itself will be a problem for most Christians. I'm a Christian (an actual practicing one) and I like the book...not the language but the book. On the up side the book actually brings up some interesting questions for thought and maybe discussion.\n\nSo...Good book, but not a pleasant book. You need to be ready for that. It tells a complete story with complete characters and fills in it's gaps. It's thought provoking, enthralling and fairly original.\n\nI can highly recommend this one. Really.\n\nSome Christians may be a bit annoyed at some of the liberties taken here. Our protagonist, the little girl is also internally Jesus. Now while that has some obvious flaws it also can be argued that Christ lives in Christians through the Holy Spirit. I'm not sure if this plot point will bother many or not.\n\nThe story revolves around the rebellion of human kind as tied in with Satan's rebellion and the perception of humans, angels and demons that God has withdrawn Himself and can be overthrown. The book ties up with this being disproved and with repentance and redemption. There is a view of Hell that owes more to Dante Alighieri than the Bible. There is a common misunderstanding of the Genesis story...but there is also a respect as a bottom line.\n\nSo, as noted not a place to go for theology, but a well written, well executed novel.\n\nDecember 2, 2012\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I have no idea what the hell I just read. I think it was deeply profound and probably changed my life, but I'm not sure yet. I'll have to read it at least twice more before I understand what actually happened. Of course I followed the plot, so I got it, but I didn't \"get\" it. To follow a book and to understand it are not always the same thing, which was profoundly demonstrated here.\n\nThis was very different from the author's first novel, Those Across the River. It's so different in style and pacing and plot that I would never have guessed that the same person wrote them if I didn't know better. It's the same horror/historical fiction genre bender, although where Those Across the River was a slow, steady build to a final conflagration, this followed the more cyclical style of most quests. Build, action, lull. Build, action, lull. There were brief bouts of horror that left me breathless and a little traumatized, then a short breather, and then once more into the breach.\n\nYou may have noticed by this point that my review has said nothing substantive about the book itself. That's because I haven't got a clue what to say. It's intricately plotted, (probably) deeply profound, filled with hair-curling profanity and stomach-turning gore. I think I will see the images of some of those scenes in my sleep for the next twenty years, and if I ever taste wine that's even a hint off, I will throw it down and run screaming.\n\nActually, I take it all back. I do know what to say. It's like a literary Bosch painting. The longer you stare at it the more you want to scratch out your eyeballs, but the more you keep coming back.\n\nAlso, if you have a sensitive soul, a weak stomach, a shaky faith, or children under 18 in the house who are prone to getting into things they shouldn't, DO NOT PICK THIS UP. You will be sorry. You will be so very sorry.\n\nMay 9, 2022\n\nGreat characters, great world building and setting.\n\nOctober 21, 2019\n\nA very easy 5 stars. I wish there were more stars to give.\n\nAn impressive book that is hard to describe. Just read it.\n\nNovember 20, 2022\n\nThe story of Between Two Fires is told from the perspective of a somewhat reluctant hero chevalier Sir Thomas, shepherding a young orphan survivor of the Black Death across a desolate landscape ravaged by death accompanied by a clueless priest and their adventures.\n\n\"Thomas shoved his sword into the face of what used to be Théobald de Barentin, and it shuddered and stopped moving. Thomas yanked the sword out of it but fell on his side. The lion-devil roared, standing over Thomas.\n\nThe crowd of finely dressed corpses moved closer. One of the monkey-things tugged the armor off his foot and bit it.\n\nThomas held his sword up.\n\nThe sun’s crown came over the edge of the land, just one brilliant orange diamond’s worth.\n\nAnd it was all gone.\n\nEverything.\n\nThomas was lying in a cow field, holding up his sword, dressed in his rusty armor. Neither his arm nor his rib nor his jaw were broken. A rusted plow stood where the lion-devil had been, one of its spars hanging at the angle of the axe it had just been holding. A dead sheep lay in exactly the position the corpse of Sir Théobald had assumed when he collapsed. A small Norman tower, long abandoned and crumbling, stood where the mighty castle had been when they first saw it at dusk. The priest, lying facedown in his robes, was breathing heavily in sleep.\n\n“A whoring dream,” he said.\"\n\nThe Knight's backstory is told in snippets here and there and it was quite brutal and savage being a life of theivery, banditry and even rape (though not at his hands). It added a certain human horror to the tale.\n\nIn February, they robbed another farmhouse, and this time the men fought. Pepin was killed. As were the men. Godefroy ordered the house burned. A dark-haired little boy just in pants stood bewildered near the blaze, saying, as if there had been some mistake, “We live here. We live here.”\n\nNot six months later the plague had come, killing most of the thieves.\n\nAnd everybody else.\n\nNothing matters anymore.\n\nThomas shook away his ghosts and turned his eyes now to Paris. Her walls were the faintly yellowed white of bones, and her turrets stood proudly, each a lazy bowshot from its neighbor. He could see what must have been the Louvre, the king’s fortress, strong and white, cut from the same stone as the city walls. The spires of cathedrals poked at the sky, and the roofs of the shops and houses tumbled against one another. Even dead, if she was dead, Paris made a lovely corpse.\n\nThis has been a very good piece of historical fiction with a tinting of dark fantasy and surreal horror. The world-building was remarkable and not at all overwhelming. The knight battles all sorts of monsters and dreamy abominations as he travels along...\n\nHe froze when something moved in the water near the pilings of the collapsed bridge, something like an oily black arm, but the width of a draft horse’s chest. He wasn’t entirely sure he had seen it.\n\nThen all of them said some variant of “My God” when its head broke the water’s surface.\n\nWhite-eyed and flat-headed, like some giant cross between eel, newt, and frog, it laid its head on the bank and felt the ground with long whiskers around its mouth and eyes until it found the woman’s leg. Its tongue darted out and latched onto the leg with a thatch of evil little hooks at its tip, pulling it under the water with it, bending a growth of sweetflag rushes. They sprang back up. The water foamed and then flowed gently again, as if none of it had happened.\n\nThose white eyes, a grandfather’s blind eyes.\n\nThe small, beardy man dropped his boar spear and ran so fast his hat blew off him.\n\n\"He lashed out with the blade again and caught Théobald across the side of the head. Seawater, not blood, gushed from the wound. It stank. Théobald looked amused. He opened his mouth and a scream came out, but it was not his scream. It was the scream of the fat peasant who had died in the river. It was the scream the thing in the river had mimicked.\"\n\nThe pacing is excellent and the humor made the telling less bleak and lots of fun. Recommended.\n\n\"Now the great plague had stilled the hearths in the countryside, and darkened the windows of the cities of man; Death’s hand sat upon the brow of the king and also the farmer; Death took the beggar and the cardinal, the money changer and the milkmaid. The babe died on the breast, and sailors brought their ships to port with dead hands. And the wickedness of man was laid bare, so great was his fear of this pestilence; for the mother fled her children and the son nailed shut his father’s door, and the priest betrayed his flock. Still other men said, “God is gone from us, or never was at all; let us do as we will, and take pleasure as we may, for all is lost.” And so the wicked went in bands and took the daughter’s maidenhead, and killed others for their sport. And some shut themselves away in walled towns, and let none pass; when the bread was gone, they drew lots, and some were given to the butcher that the rest might live. Some righteous men and women yet held faith, but they were scattered so far that none could see the other’s light, and it seemed the darkness had no end.\""
