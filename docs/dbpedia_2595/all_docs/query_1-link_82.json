        "text": "Friday 14 August 2020\n\nThe statue of New Jersey founder and slave trader Sir George Carteret has been covered in red paint and bound in 'chains'.\n\nPolice told Express the damage was reported them this morning and that they are now investigating.\n\nPictured: The statue this morning. (Shaun Crowther)\n\nAs part of the overnight attack, red paint was poured over Sir George's hands and feet, and black paper chains looped around his limbs.\n\nIt's the second time the bronze statue has been targeted in recent months.\n\nIn June, white paint was thrown over it amid calls for the structure's removal due to the naval privateer's links with slavery.\n\nPictured: It's not the first time the statue has been attacked.\n\nThe statue of Sir George Carteret was erected in St. Peter in 2014 to commemorate the 350th anniversary of the founding of New Jersey.\n\nThe US state was given its name by the St. Peter-born Vice-Admiral, who was gifted the land as thanks for sheltering King Charles during the English Civil War.\n\nWhile the accompanying plaque acknowledges Sir George’s key role in island history, it does not reference the fact that the privateer supported and profited from the trade of slaves.\n\nPictured: How the statue normally looks.\n\nThe statue's erection was supposed to be privately-funded, but it emerged recently that more than £36,000 in public funds had been contributed towards it."
