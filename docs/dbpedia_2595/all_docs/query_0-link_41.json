We are pleased to present fifty of our most interesting recent acquisitions in this catalogue, featuring fine and decorative prints spanning a diverse range of subjects, engravers, and prices. We would like to dedicate this catalogue to the late Nicholas G. Stogdon (1948-2024) whose knowledge and expertise, along with his dry sense of humour, will be sorely missed by all at Sanders."
