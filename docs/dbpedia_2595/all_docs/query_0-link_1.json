He supported the Royalist (Cavalier) cause during the War of the Three Kingdoms.\n\nPhilip Carteret was the son of Philippe de Carteret II. He succeeded to the Seigneurie of Sark on the death of his father in 1643.\n\nDuring the English Civil War, Carteret was lieutenant to his kinsman George Carteret, and was knighted on the beach of St Aubin's Bay in Jersey by the exiled Charles, Prince of Wales in 1645.\n\nIn 1661, he became Bailiff of Jersey. In 1670, he was created a baronet, of St Ouen on the Island of Jersey.\n\nCarteret married Anne (1566–1644),[1] daughter of Abraham Dumaresq Seig Des Augres. They had children including Phillip (1650-1693) and two daughters.\n\nDecarteret staff (12 November 2005) [1996], Sir Philip De Carteret Seig, St Ouen, Sark, Rozel, Decarteret.org.uk, archived from the original on 11 March 2007[unreliable source]\n\nPhilippe de Carteret, Bailiff 1661-1662, TheIslandWiki, 30 August 2013 [unreliable source]"
