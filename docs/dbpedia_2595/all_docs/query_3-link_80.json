        "text": "This is one of the grander tombs in the cemetery, still in very good condition. As you can see from this first photograph we are in the process of sanding down and repainting the railings, but the structure of the vault itself is very sound, and we haven’t needed to do any work to it at all. The vault contains several members of the Corbin family of La Porte, on the outskirts of town (at the west end of Elm Grove, opposite the Collinette Hotel). The inscriptions on the side panels – which were originally painted in black on the whitewashed tomb – have survived very well, and they are all easy to read. The lid has a much fainter inscription, cut very shallowly into the stone, but that too can be deciphered in the right light. I’ll start with the north side, which records the earliest of the Corbins in this vault:\n\nTo the Memory of / WILLIAM CORBIN Esq. of this Island / who departed this life the 4th day of June 1822 / in the 57th Year of his age. / Also of WILLIAM & HILARY CARRÉ Sons / of the above & MARY CARRÉ his Wife / the former of whom died the 6th Oct. 1798 / Aged 18 Months / the latter the 26th Oct. 1814 Aged 17 Years.\n\nThe south panel of the tomb records the death of Mary Carré, wife of William Corbin, along with another of their children:\n\nTO THE MEMORY OF / MARY CARRÉ, RELICT OF THE LATE WILLIAM CORBIN ESQ. / OF LA PORTE IN THE PARISH / WHO DIED ON THE 20TH OF JULY 1849, / AGED 76 YEARS AND 11 MONTHS. / ALSO OF / THEODORE AUGUSTUS CORBIN ESQ. / LATE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER IN BRITISH BURMAH / BORN OCTOBER 14TH 1800 DIED DECEMBER 11TH 1857.\n\nThere is one peculiarity in the inscription above: Theodore Augustus Corbin died on 11 December 1856, not 1857, although it is quite clearly given as 1857 on the vault.\n\nAnother son of William Corbin and Mary Carré is recorded on the east panel:\n\nIN / MEMORY OF / WILLIAM EUGÉNE, / SON OF / WILLIAM CORBIN, ESQ. / AND MARY CARRÉ / WHO DEPARTED THIS LIFE / THE 28TH DAY OF MARCH 1836 / IN THE 36TH YEAR OF HIS AGE. / I shall go to him, but he shall / not return to me. / 2D Samuel XII.25\n\nThe final inscription is on the cover, recording the two daughters of Theodore Augustus Corbin:\n\nALICE CORBIN / OF LA PORTE / DAUGHTER OF THE LATE / THEODORE A. CORBIN ESQ. / OF LA PORTE / BORN APRIL 4TH 1843 / DIED DECEMBER 8TH 1907. / ALSO / MARY CORBIN / ELDER SISTER OF THE ABOVE / AND WIDOW OF THE LATE / CAPT. H. MAYNARD BINGHAM R.N. / DIED FEBRUARY 25TH 1913 AGED 73.\n\nThis all seems reasonably straightforward, and the diagram below summarizes the relationships between the people named on this tomb, given in red. Those in black are not recorded on this tomb, although several are elsewhere in this cemetery or in Candie. But as you can see there is one significant blank space: who was Theodore Augustus Corbin’s wife?\n\nThis has turned into a real puzzle, and despite spending quite some time trying to solve this mystery, I’m still not much closer to a solution.\n\nTheodore Corbin had three children: the two daughters named on the lid of the tomb, Alice Corbin (born at Mergui in Burma on 4 April 1843) and Mary Corbin (born at Amherst, now known as Kyaikkami, in Burma, on 1 June 1838), and a son, George William Corbin, also born at Mergui on 25 March 1840. These details come from Theodore’s will, which is available from the National Archives, and although much of it is repetitive legalese concerning the trusts set up for the benefit of the children, it also includes an intriguing paragraph about the son, George William: ‘… it being my firm belief that the said George William Corbin labours under such deficiency of intellect as renders him incapable of managing any property or income to his own advantage and renders it moreover necessary and advantageous to himself that he should have such “Curateur aux biens” or Guardian…’. This was written in November 1856, just before Theodore died, in the same year that George left Elizabeth College after four years at the school. The College Register – which wrongly gives his place of birth as Guernsey – records that he was in the Merchant Service, and then farmed in Somerset; he died of consumption just before his 26th birthday. One source on the web indicates that he was married to a Louisa Eliza Patten by 1861. He died on 22 February 1866 and was buried at St Margaret’s Church in Middle Chinnock on 2 March, where there is apparently a headstone with the inscription ‘Only son of Theodore Corbin, Esq. of La Porte, Guernsey’.\n\nI have not found a birth or baptismal certificate for George, but there are baptismal records for both of his sisters, and this is where it becomes very interesting indeed. The first shown here is for the older daughter, Mary, baptised on 27 February 1840.\n\nAs you can see if you click and enlarge the image, the space for ‘of whom born, their residence and profession’ is completely blank. Turning now to the younger daughter, Alice, who was baptised on 18 November 1844, we find the following:\n\nI’ve included the entry after Alice for comparison, and this time you’ll see that although Theodore is named as the father, there is no mention of the mother’s name, unlike all the other entries on this page.\n\nThis anonymity extends through every other reference to Theodore or his children which I can find. There is no mention of the mother (or mothers?) of his children in Theodore’s will. In the Elizabeth College register we are told that he was invalided back to Guernsey in 1844, which would fit with his description as ‘late assistant to commissioner’ on Alice’s baptismal certificate. There’s no mention of a wife in the register, although it notes that he was the father of no. 1062, George William Corbin.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, in the census of 1851, Theodore is listed as unmarried, not as a widower. He is living with his sister, Mary Adelaide Corbin, also unmarried, at 2 Elm Grove. I haven’t found Alice in this census, although Mary is among the pupils at a small boarding school at L’Hyvreuse, near Cambridge Park, and George is at another boarding school in the Plaiderie. By 1861, after Theodore’s death, both daughters are recorded as living with their aunt Mary at La Porte.\n\nIn Theodore’s will he states that ‘it is my will and desire that my said Sister Mary Adelaide Corbin be appointed Guardian… to my said Children during their minority…’, as the census implies was the case. He also writes that he desires to record his ‘sincere thanks to my family and friends but particularly to my Brother and Sisters for the many kind attentions they have shewn towards myself and my Children since our arrival in this Island’. Once again, no indication that he arrived back in Guernsey with a wife.\n\nSo what’s the story here? The absence of any mother’s name on the baptismal certificates of his daughters seems to me to be very unusual. Did they, and George, have the same mother? I had wondered initially whether their mother – for the sake of argument we’ll assume it is one woman – had died before Theodore and his children returned to Guernsey, but there is no evidence that Theodore was ever married, and as we’ve seen the 1851 census actually states that he was unmarried. That also seems to rule out a separation or divorce, in any case very rare at that time. Is it possible that Theodore’s partner was a native of Burma? I would guess that the custom of the time would have prevented him from marrying a Burmese woman, even if they were effectively living as man and wife. It might still have been the case then that she died in 1843 or 1844, after the birth of Alice, and before Theodore returned home. My impression is that the absence of her name from any inscription or record of either Theodore or the children is most unusual for a person of Theodore’s position in Victorian society, and I wonder if that’s because she was Burmese. Any thoughts?\n\nBefore we leave the enigmatic Theodore Augustus Corbin, he has one claim to fame not previously mentioned here. In 1849 he sent an enormous Chaumontel pear grown at La Porte to Queen Victoria. It weighed 38 ounces and the Queen and Prince Albert reportedly very much admired it. Contemporary reports state that a cast of the pear was preserved; that cast now lurks in the stores of Guernsey Museum, and here’s an image of it, together with its original label.\n\nThis vault is one of the best-preserved in the Brothers’ Cemetery – no repair work has been required, and even the render on the sides is still completely intact. The Portland stone lid records three generations of the Le Cocq family. The dates are represented in an unusual form which I have not seen anywhere else in the cemetery:\n\nSACRED / to the memory of / NATHANIEL LE COCQ, Esq. / who died Oct. the 3 AD 1800 aged 50 Years. / And of CARTERETTE his wife / Daughter of J. GUILLE Esq. of St. George in / this island, who died May the 1 AD 1807 / Aged 47 Years. / Also of their three Daughters / CARTERETTE who died Mar. the 1 AD 1815 / Aged 21 Years. / CAROLINE who died Mar. the 9 AD 1818 / Aged 19 Years. / And MARY the Wife of / J[n?] HUBERT Esq. Jurat / who died April the 27 AD 1829 / in the Thirty fourth Year of her Age. / And their Grandchildren / EMILY who died April the 20 AD 1835 / Aged 13 weeks. / CAROLINE who died July the 7 AD 1850 / Aged 19 Years. / SOPHIA LE MARCHANT / who died August the 10 AD 1852 / Aged 16 Years. / Daughters of JOHN LE COCQ / And SOPHIA DOBREE his Wife.\n\nSo, in summary, recorded here are Nathaniel Le Cocq (1750-1800) and his wife, Carterette Guille (1760-1807), their three daughters – Carterette (c.1794-1815), Caroline (c.1799-1818) and Mary (c.1796-1829) – and three grandchildren, Emily (born and died 1835), Caroline (c.1831-1850) and Sophia Le Marchant (c.1836-1852). These three grandchildren are daughters of John Le Cocq and Sophia Dobrée, and I would guess that it was probably John who had this inscription engraved on the vault.\n\nNathaniel Le Cocq seems to have been an educated man, with a fondness for books – the Priaulx Library records a couple of entries in his letter-book, from 1770 and 1772, detailing his orders and recent acquisitions. The same book also contains a list of ‘dogs owned’, but I have so far resisted the temptation to hunt this down in the Priaulx. His name also crops up here, as one of several Le Cocqs who subscribed to the Revd Dr Edward Harwood’s ‘Discourses on St Paul’s description of Death and its consequences’, published in 1790. He was the third son of Samuel Le Cocq and Anne Le Mesurier, and he married Carterette, daughter of Jean Guille (of St George) and Marie de Carteret, at the Castel church on 21 September 1791.\n\nAs I’ve suggested above, the inscription on the vault was perhaps engraved on the instructions of John Le Cocq, son of Nathaniel and Carterette. He was born in about 1800, around the time that his father died. In the census for 1841 he is one of a large household at Clifton, the Le Cocq family home. Also in the house are his wife, Sophia, née Dobrée, born about 1806, and four children: Caroline (aged 9), Hubert (8), Sophia Le Marchant (5) and Saumarez (3). There are four female servants and also two much older residents: Hillary Dobrée (aged 79) and Sophia Le Marchant (aged 84). I presume that they are relatives of Sophia Dobrée, but I have not been able to confirm this.\n\nWe can get a fuller picture of the Le Cocq family from their vault in Candie Cemetery, since it seems that like other well-to-do Victorian families in Guernsey, they ‘upgraded’ to Candie in the mid-nineteenth century. One of the interesting features here is that Caroline (died 7 July 1850) and Sophia (died 10 August 1852) are named on this tomb as well as in the Brothers’ Cemetery, but their little sister Emily, who died at only thirteen weeks old in 1835, is not. I wonder if that was because John and Sophia re-used the name for another daughter, Emily Dobrée Le Cocq (c.1841 – 25 July 1919). Her name is recorded on the north side of the tomb in Candie.\n\nAs well as these four daughters, John Le Cocq and Sophia Dobrée had three sons, also recorded on the tomb in Candie: Hubert, Saumarez and William George. Hubert, born on 14 April 1833, had a distinguished military career, mostly in India, summarized in the Elizabeth College register. He retired to Guernsey in about 1891 and died at the age of 77, on 15 February 1911. Shown here is a portrait said to be of Hubert as a young man, attributed to Constance Emily Barnes, which is now in Dorset County Museum.\n\nConstance Barnes was born in 1872 and I would guess that Hubert is not older than eighteen or so in the portrait, so either a) it is not Hubert, b) it wasn’t painted by Constance, or c) it was painted by Constance but not from life – there may be other possibilities I haven’t considered!\n\nSaumarez Le Cocq was born on 15 December 1838. He worked as a coffee planter in Ceylon from 1855 to 1881, ‘when he returned to Guernsey, and filled various public and charitable offices’; the College register notes that these included Constable of St Peter Port, Honorary Secretary of the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and Honorary Treasurer for Victoria Cottage Hospital, ‘the prosperity of the two last-mentioned institutions… largely due to his untiring energy and unobtrusive philanthropy’.\n\nThe youngest son, William George, was born on 18 September 1842. He had an impressive naval career, retiring as Captain in 1894. As the College register records, he received ‘the vellum of the Royal Humane Society (March, 1874), for having, as the Revenge was leaving Portsmouth – though just convalescent from a severe illness – jumped overboard, in his heavy uniform, and rescued a seaman, who had fallen between the bows of the ship and the wharf’.\n\nWe could no doubt continue with the story of the Le Cocqs, but this is a good place to stop. Here’s one more image of the vault in the Brothers’ Cemetery.\n\nThis Tupper family vault was one of the most dilapidated in the Brothers’ Cemetery when we started work here in 2012. One of the long side panels had fallen into the tomb, the other long side was cracked, and both it and the two end panels were threatening to follow the north side into the vault. The lid had slipped into the gap between this tomb and the next vault, but fortunately it hadn’t broken. With permission from the Ecclesiastical Court, we removed the remaining three side panels and replaced the lid on the foundations of the tomb. The panel at the east end is inscribed – more about that below – and so that will be retained adjacent to the tomb.\n\nThe inscription on the lid is not particularly easy to read – the engraving is shallow, and it gained a good covering of moss while it was tipped up. But as usual in the right light it becomes easier to decipher, and I’m confident the following is accurate:\n\nTHE FAMILY VAULT OF / JOHN E. TUPPER, ESQ. / OF THE COTILS / AND ELIZABETH BROCK HIS WIFE / A.D. 1809 / SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF /FERDINAND BROCK TUPPER, ESQ. / WHO DIED 21ST DECEMBER 1873 / IN THE 79TH YEAR OF HIS AGE. / To this man will I look, / Even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit / And trembleth at my word. / Isiah 66.2 / ALSO OF / MARIANNE HERBERT HIS WIFE / WHO DIED 20TH NOVEMBER 1883 / IN THE 82ND YEAR OF HER AGE. / Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty. / Isiah 33.17 / ALSO OF / EMILIA, YOUNGER DAUGHTER OF / FERDINAND BROCK TUPPER / AND MARIANNE, HIS WIFE / WHO DIED 13TH DECEMBER 1920 / AGED 75 YEARS. / Say to them that are of a fearful heart be / strong, fear not: behold your God will come. / Isiah 35.4 / ALSO OF / HENRIETTA, ELDEST DAUGHTER OF THE ABOVE / WHO DIED 2ND OCTOBER 1928 / AGED 88 YEARS. / Love suffereth long and is kind. / 1 COR XIII.IV\n\nOne of the first points of interest is the date on the fifth line, A.D. 1809. I can only assume that this is a date of construction for the tomb, since it doesn’t seem to have any obvious significance for John Elisha Tupper (1764-1845) or Elizabeth Brock (1767-1847), or any of their ten sons or three daughters. If so, it’s the only example of a date for the building of a vault which I’ve seen in the cemetery so far.\n\nJohn Elisha Tupper was a successful local merchant. His wife, Elizabeth Brock, was the sister of (among others) Major-General Sir Isaac Brock and of Daniel de Lisle Brock, Bailiff of Guernsey from 1821 to 1842. Although their names are at the head of this vault, I am not certain that they were buried here. They do not seem to be in Candie Cemetery, where a well-to-do local couple might expect to be buried by the 1840s – but on the other hand, David Kreckeler has identified them both in the Town Church burial register, for 17 February 1845 (John) and 4 November 1847 (Elizabeth). The local newspaper reports at the time of their deaths might provide the answer.\n\nMany of John and Elizabeth’s thirteen children died in tragic circumstances. Writing in the early 1850s, Lt-Col. de Havilland noted that ‘It is a somewhat remarkable circumstance in this family, that of the ten sons, two were killed; two were drowned; two died at sea, on the same day of the same month in different years; two died of scarlet fever, within two days of each other; and two are surviving in 1853’. No mention of the daughters, but in fact all three lived to adulthood.\n\nOne of the surviving sons was Ferdinand Brock Tupper, also recorded on this tomb. After an early career as a merchant he returned to Guernsey in the mid-1830s, perhaps shortly before his marriage to Marianne Herbert, eldest daughter of Major-General Herbert, on 11 April 1834. In the years which followed he published several of the most authoritative works on the island’s history, culminating in The History of Guernsey and its Bailiwick; with occasional notices of Jersey (1854). A second edition of this work, edited by his daughter Henrietta, was published just after his death, in 1876.\n\nLike several of his brothers, it was the sea which also took Ferdinand Brock Tupper’s life, since he seems to have fallen into the harbour after walking there from his home in Candie Road, very early in the morning of 21 December 1873. His two daughters both lived on into old age, and indeed they are among the latest burials recorded on the vaults in the cemetery, in 1920 and 1928. Their mother, Marianne, is also interred here.\n\nAs well as the members of the Tupper family recorded on the lid of this tomb, there is an interesting inscription on the east face. It reads as follows:\n\nBY THE KINDNESS OF HIS / FRIEND F.B. TUPPER, ESQ., / IN THIS VAULT ARE DEPOSITED / THE REMAINS OF / G.W.H. CRESSWELL, ESQ., / OF THE MANOR HOUSE / SHERESTONE, WILTS., / WHO DIED IN THIS ISLAND / 26TH OCTOBER 1848 / IN HIS 49TH YEAR.\n\nThis is George William Howe Cresswell, who is remembered by a memorial in the Holy Cross Church at Sherston Magna, Wiltshire, shown here, which records his burial in Guernsey. His death was also recorded in the London Evening Standard of 2 November 1848, copied – with the same mistake in his age – to several provincial papers. Does the statement that he was ‘late of Sherstone, Wiltshire’ imply that he had been in Guernsey for some time? His wife, Sophia Ann Hulbert, outlived him by 35 years and was buried in Highgate, in London. The National Archives holds a deposition made on 25 November 1833 by ‘… George William Howe Cresswell of the Old Manor House, Sherston Magna, Wiltshire, and others, concerning a gang of poachers and sheep stealers who have committed offences over many years, culminating in the attempted murder of Mr Cresswell and his family. The government is asked to offer a reward, in addition to one of £30 being offered by Mr Cresswell, and a pardon to any accomplice who gives evidence.’\n\nNone of this takes us any further in explaining how he became a friend of Ferdinand Brock Tupper, or indeed what he was doing in Guernsey in 1848, and why his body was not buried closer to home. As usual, we are left with more questions than answers!\n\nThis vault holds one of the more distinguished occupants of the Brothers’ Cemetery: General Sir Thomas Saumarez, younger brother of the still more famous Admiral Lord James de Saumarez. Also in here is John Saumarez, their eldest brother, who seems to have been rather overshadowed by his younger siblings. In fact the wikipedia page for Admiral Lord James de Saumarez ignores John completely, giving James as the oldest brother. A full list of the ten siblings, children of Matthew Saumarez and his second wife, Carterette Le Marchant, can be found towards the bottom of the page here.\n\nThe inscription on this lid reads as follows:\n\nUNDERNEATH THIS TOMB ARE DEPOSITED / THE REMAINS OF / GENERAL SIR THOMAS SAUMAREZ / WHO DEPARTED THIS LIFE / ON THE 4TH DAY OF MARCH 1845 / IN THE 85TH YEAR OF HIS AGE. / ALSO THE REMAINS OF / HARRIET BROCK / HIS BELOVED WIFE / WHO DEPARTED THIS LIFE / ON THE 18TH DAY OF FEBRUARY 1858 / IN THE 96TH YEAR OF HER AGE. / ALSO THE REMAINS OF THEIR TWO CHILDREN / HARRIET, / WHO DIED ON THE 3RD OF JUNE 1795, AND / THOMAS / WHO DIED AN INFANT / ON THE 8TH OF OCTOBER 1804. / ALSO THE REMAINS OF / JOHN SAUMAREZ ESQUIRE / THE ELDEST BROTHER OF / SIR THOMAS SAUMAREZ / WHO DIED ON THE 3RD FEBRUARY 1832 / IN THE 77TH YEAR OF HIS AGE. / ALSO THE REMAINS OF HIS WIFE / JUDITH DAUGHTER OF WILLIAM BROCK / WHO DIED IN 1816 IN THE 58TH YEAR OF HER AGE.\n\nGuernsey Museum holds two portraits of Sir Thomas, that shown to the left and another here. His military career is described in considerable detail by Sir John Ross, in an appendix to his ‘Memoirs and Correspondence of Admiral Lord de Saumarez’, published in 1838. He concludes with the words (vol. II, p. 347) that ‘Sir Thomas has almost constantly resided in his native island, and no one has done more in promoting its improvement. Those who have visited Guernsey with an introduction to him, and even perfect strangers, will gratefully remember his hospitality. He was long the highly esteemed friend of Her present Majesty’s illustrious father, his Royal Highness the Duke of Kent; and he is no less esteemed for the urbanity of his manners and kindness of heart. The author can testify, that those who know Sir Thomas Saumarez have a sincere and invaluable friend.’\n\nThe funeral of Sir Thomas was widely reported – this clipping is from the Hereford Journal of 19 March 1845. It’s a little surprising that this eminent figure should be buried in the Brothers’ Cemetery, rather than in Candie Cemetery, just up the road. Perhaps he wished to be with his two infant children, Thomas and Harriet, who had died several decades before Candie was opened. As recorded in the inscription, his wife, Harriet Brock, was also buried in this vault. There is a picture of her near the top of this page. She was the sister of William and Henry Brock, both of whom are also buried – I am nearly certain – in the Brothers’ Cemetery.\n\nIt was Harriet Brock who had a much grander memorial erected to her husband in the Town Church, ‘in grateful remembrance of 58 years of conjugal happiness’.\n\nAs I mentioned above, the eldest Saumarez brother, John, appears to have been rather overshadowed by James and Thomas. He gets a brief mention in David Shayer’s book on ‘James Saumarez’ (published by La Société Guernesiaise in 2006), which states (p. 3) that he ‘followed his father into the medical profession and later became surgeon general to the King’s forces in Guernsey.’ I presume that his wife, Judith, the daughter of William Brock, was related to Harriet – indeed she may even have been her sister, as suggested here, but I have not found satisfactory confirmation of this. If anybody can confirm this one way or the other, let me know…"
