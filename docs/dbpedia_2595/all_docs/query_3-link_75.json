        "text": "A fascinating history A lot has happened over the centuries that’s shaped us into the Island we are today. Here’s a very brief look at the major events:\n\n1204: The Anglo-Norman Kingdom divides and Jersey pledges allegiance to the English Crown.\n\n1646: Islander Sir George (de) Carteret offers refuge to exiled Charles II during the English Civil War.\n\n1660: Charles II returns to England after the Civil War, and gives George Carteret joint ownership of New Jersey, America, as a reward.\n\n1945: World War II ends and Jersey is liberated from German occupation, leaving behind fortifications that are open for visitors today. Find out more from our award-winning historical trust, at www.jerseyheritage.org.\n\n1961: Banks began to establish offshore operations in earnest to meet the growing demands of British customers living or working aboard.\n\n1984: Jersey was the first jurisdiction to bring trust and company service providers within a regulatory regime by passing the Jersey Trust Law.\n\n2001: Jersey Finance was founded to promote Jersey as an international finance centre globally.\n\n2009: Jersey Finance opened an office in Hong Kong and Jersey companies became able to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\n\n2018 : Jersey Finance became the first international finance centre to set up an office in the Dubai International Finance Centre.\n\n2019 : EU Finance Ministers (ECOFIN) confirmed Jersey’s position as a co-operative jurisdiction following an extensive period of assessment."
