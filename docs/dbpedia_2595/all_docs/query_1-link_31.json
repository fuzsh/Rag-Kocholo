        "text": "on 19 May 2005 •\n\nFrench Divine - Protestant (Huguenot) cleric.\n\nDr Hacket. A great hero of mine! During the late Civil War, the Cathedral at Lichfield (where I lived for 6 years as a teenager), was held by the King's party, beseiged by the Parliamentarians and heavily damaged. Lichfield is unique in English cathedrals in having three spires - the larger single spire behind the two paired ones at the front of the cathedral, was wholly brought down by cannon fire, bringing the roof with it. Once the seige was broken, the Parliamentarains garrisoned the cathedral (it was the only defnsible area in the city, having an enclosed Close with 2 gates - built out from the medieval city walls).They stabled their horses in part of the building. It became a ruin. Richard Hacket was appointed Bishop and had the chance to live in Coventry (it was a joint Diocese at that time). Thankfully foir Lichfield, he came there and literally saved the cathedral, organising the resbuilding of the spire (huge civil engineering work). He restored the place to it former (and present) glory. If you visit, you will notice that the stone of the main spire is a different colour from the spires at the front - a different quarry was used.\n\nSo it looks as though Hacket is being rewarded by his Roayl patron by being allowed to preach before him on one of the three main Feasts of the Church - Pentecost.His sermon is based on the Woman at the Well - Jesus accepting water from an outcast Samarian woman and telling her he can give her living water.(John 4).\n\nAs was usual, the most important person present at the Communion receives the Sacrament first, but it seems from Sam's description, that only the King received. Unusual. Sam seems more interested in the music than anything else, but I'm glad he liked Hacket's sermon. Hacket was a most remarkable man.\n\non 19 May 2005 •\n\nThe \"French Divine\" --\n\nHe was from the Channel Isle of Jersey.\n\n\"1648-52 M. Daniel Brevint, M.A.\n\n\"Fellow of Jesus College Oxford.\"\n\n\"Born in St John in 1617, he was the son of Daniel Brevint, Rector of St John.\n\n\"It is notable that for about two years, the father and the son were Rectors of Parishes at the same time. Brevint ceased to be Rector of Grouville at some time in 1652; then he clearly left Jersey, and lived in France for several years. After the Restoration of Charles II, he settled in England, and became, in January 1681-2, Dean of Lincoln, where he died in 1695, aged 78.\n\n\"For fuller details on this distinguished Jerseyman, who married one of the daughters of the famous Philip de Carteret, see the Article on him in the Bulletin of 1910.\n\n\"Let us add that, during his lifetime, he gave a quarter of the froment of rente to the poor of Grouville (see the Journal of Elie Brevint, 1662).\"\n\nhttp://www.societe-jersiaise.org/…\n\non 19 May 2005 •\n\nproroguing the House\n\nThe usage here seems to be consistent with the 3rd definition of \"prorogue\" from the OED:\n\n3. To discontinue the meetings of (a legislative or other assembly) for a time, definite or indefinite, without dissolving it; to dismiss by authority until the next session. Originally and chiefly in reference to the British Parliament.\n\nOriginally a particular application of sense 2; the meaning being to \"put off, postpone\" the assembly or sittings of a parliament which had been summoned or was in session…\n\non 19 May 2005 •\n\n\"Bess, Sir George told me to wait on him and one does not tell Sir George Carteret that it's ten of the clock and one is fed up and going home.\"\n\nGrrr...\n\n\"And if you'd care to look at my poor worn feet after five hours of pacing in the gallery at the Council chamber...\"\n\nPainful removal of shoe...Revealing badly blistered, swollen feet.\n\n\"Ouch! Mon Dieu, Sam'l! My poor darling...Jane! A bowl of warm water!\"\n\n\"Nice dress by the way.\"\n\non 19 May 2005 •\n\n\"Nice dress by the way.\"\n\nOhhh, I think “suit” may mean undie-type garments. Perhaps something more feminine than a “union suit”, given our definition last month of sarcenet.\n\n(OED: Sarsenet, sarcenet 1. A very fine and soft silk material made both plain and twilled, in various colours, now used chiefly for linings; a dress made of this.) Linings are usually silky thin fabrics that won’t interfer with the garment fabric’s characteristics—much like a slip and other lingerie in that negligibleness.\n\nIt is midnight and “[s]he was in her new suit of black sarcenet and yellow petticoat very pretty.”\n\nFor which he pleased her.\n\non 19 May 2005 •\n\nwhere the King and Councell sat till almost eleven o'clock at night, and I forced to walk up and down the gallerys till that time of night.\n\nThis will send a shudder of recognition through anyone who has had to sit through the interminable committee meetings of my city council (and countless others) just in case they might be called upon by their betters. The ways of English Government do not seem to have changed over the years! I bet Sam had to run for the last carriage home too!\n\non 19 May 2005 •\n\nAnyone here kept a woman waiting for four or more hours without her knowing when you would turn up, and when to reheat the meal and should she start without you, and was she wearing her best new clothes at the time? - how did she feel about it and how much swearing was involved?\n\nThank God, for the telephone.\n\nBut if they're all working on a Sunday, especially such an important one, then the deadline must have been extremely close.\n\non 20 May 2005 •\n\nThe Pews were on the most part for those that could afford their cost or upkeep or have been set aside for their pleasure. The other 80% of the parish, it be Stand or Pray.\n\nRemember Sam mentions Pews because it be a \"P\"rivilege to be in one, if it be normal, it be not worth the wasted ink.\n\nPrivilege was, is and will be the mark of a man's position in society, along with all the trappings that separate the chaff from the wheat. Then it becoach and six with livery , now the \"*\": Plummage,plummage and which tree ye doth sit in.\n\non 20 May 2005 •\n\nUntil teh Reformation in England, it was the usual practice, as noted by Doirk above, to stand during a service. If you were old, ill or otherwise feeble, you stood by the wall and leant on it. This is the origin of the phrase \"the weak go to the wall\". If you go into an ancient cathedral in England and up into the grand stalls in the choir area where the prebends and such like sat, you will see that they had seats and sometimes a sort of bottom support to rest bums on, so they could lean back in the stall and rest up, but give the appearance of standing.\n\nAll the old Gothic Cathedrals were designed and built to be without seating in the Nave and transepts, but today are of course cluttered with seats or pews. Wouldn't they look grand without them? Wonderful expanses of tiled floor.\n\non 21 May 2005 •\n\n\"the weak go to the wall\"\n\nNothing to do with cathedrals -- \"go to the wall\" is an old phrase meaning 'succumb'; OED:\n\n13. to go to the wall (or walls): a. to give way, succumb in a conflict or struggle.\n\n1589 Pasquil's Ret. Aiiij, They neuer went to the wall, till they grewe to be factious. 1601 J. WHEELER Treat. Comm. 111 Wee should go to the walles, be wronged and exacted vpon euery where. 1859 H. KINGSLEY G. Hamlyn xxix, Sam and Mayford are both desperately in love with her, and one must go to the wall. 1861 LD. BROUGHAM Brit. Const. xx. 385 It is easy to see which power will go to the wall if a conflict occurs. 1867 TROLLOPE Chron. Barset xliii, In all these struggles Crosbie had had the best of it, and Butterwell had gone to the wall.\n\nProverb. [1535: see WAW]. 1549 CHEKE Hurt Sedit. (1641) 53 When brethren agree not in a house, goeth not the weakest to the walls? 1579 LYLY Euphues (Arb.) 53 The weakest must still to the wall. 1592 SHAKES. Rom. & Jul. I. i. 18. 1651 CULPEPPER Astrol. Judgem. Dis. (1658) 80 You know the old proverb, The weakest goes to the Walls.\n\n(Note: I have no idea what they intend by \"1535: see WAW\" -- I've been to WAW and seen nothing remotely related.)\n\non 22 May 2005 •\n\nWeak go to the wall\n\nOK - picture the scene. Class of Early English History students on field trip. Crowded into the small Anglo-Saxon Chapel of St Wilfred at Repton. Esteemed lecturer talks about size of churches being smaller in those days 'cos everyone stood up. Pointed out how many of us there were in a small space. Then he not only *told* us, he *demonstrated* how the old, infirm or whatever, who could not stand upright leant against the wall, and, he said, standing leaning against the ancient dank and mossy stones, that *that* was the origin of the phrase!! So there. Never believe what even esteemed Anglo Saxon Hostory Profs. (who shall remain anon) tell you. (Wonder if I ever quoted him in an essay....?)\n\non 14 Apr 2021 •\n\n\"...with Sir G. Carteret to his lodging to dinner with his Lady and one Mr. Brevin\"\n\nL&M: Daniel Brevint, Canon of Durham, later (1681) Dean of Lincoln, who had married Anne, Carteret's sister. Not French, but like Carteret a Jerseyman. He had been educated in France (at Saumer) and ha spent his years of exile there during the revolution, becoming spiritual director of Turenne's wife, and had returned from Normandy only a few months before: Corr. J. Cosin (ed. Ornsby), ii. 26. His visit to London may have been connected to his presentation to Brancepeth, co. Durham, a rectory in the royal gift, at about this time: CSPD 1661-2, pp. 256, 370."
