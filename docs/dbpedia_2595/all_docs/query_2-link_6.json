        "text": "Thursday 16 March 2023\n\nUS citizen James Kaye has recently become Jersey's newest Seigneur after travelling 11,000 miles across the Atlantic to appear before the Royal Court to acquire the ancient feudal title in aid of Ukraine... but who is the mystery man behind the title?\n\nAnd why did someone from Colorado, with no prior connections to the island, decide to spend £55,000 to be named 'Seigneur du Fief ès Poingdestre'?\n\nExpress chatted to the new Seigneur, who revealed all...\n\nJames Kaye is originally from the south-eastern part of the United States. He joined the US Army at a young age and fought in the Iraq War.\n\nHe is now married and has three children, working as an engineering manager for Lockheed Martin Space in Denver, Colorado.\n\n\"My only connection is my love of history\"\n\nDespite having no prior connections to the Channel Islands, Mr Kaye said that he has \"known about Jersey, Guernsey, and Sark for at least 10 years or more\" due to his love of history.\n\nHe explained: \"The US and Jersey in particular have a very close association through history with Sir George Carteret, Seigneur de St. Ouen being the first governor of New Jersey. I've always enjoyed reading history and that's what led to my knowledge of the Channel Islands.\"\n\n\"Most of my family emigrated from Wales, England, and France, so my only connection is my love of history and now my Seigneury!\" he added.\n\nPictured: \"The US and Jersey in particular have a very close association through history with Sir George Carteret\".\n\nMr Kaye heard that the 'Seigneur du Fief ès Poingdestre' title was up for sale through complete chance.\n\n\"It must have been the universe telling me something\"\n\nHe stumbled across the information through a \"random Google search\" whilst doing research on Sir Edmond Andros, a Jersey Seigneur and the first Governor of colonial New York.\n\n\"It must have been the universe telling me something,\" he said. \"I felt compelled to place a tender.\"\n\nMr Kaye explained that he decided to bid on the title due to a combination of factors.\n\nHe said: \"Apart from that it was going to a great cause, I saw this as a wonderful way to become a part of the history I'd studied for so long. I can't think of a more beautiful place with wonderful people to try my best to become a part of.\"\n\nMr Kaye described feeling \"elated\" when he found out that he was the successful bidder.\n\n\"I hope one day to attend a Liberation Day in Kyiv\"\n\n\"I think I was at a loss, which is very rare for me.\" he said. \"I put my best foot forward in my bid, but I was sceptical I’d be selected.\"\n\nThe new Seigneur was also delighted that the money from his bid would be going towards humanitarian relief work in Ukraine.\n\nMr Kaye said: \"I think that Jersey of all places understands what it's like to be invaded, and the jubilation experienced when you're liberated. I hope to one day attend a Liberation Day in Kyiv.\"\n\nPictured: Sam Le Quesne, who sold the title of Seigneur du Fief ès Poingdestre to James Kaye for £55,000 in aid of Ukraine. (Jon Guegan)\n\nMr Kaye has recently returned to Colorado after completing a 11,000 mile round-trip to appear before the Royal Court in order to acquire his new title in-person.\n\n\"I came for the title, but left with friends\"\n\nHe described his trip to Jersey as \"lovely\", adding that it was worth the long journey.\n\n\"The ceremony was quick,\" he admitted. \"But just being in the Royal Court in front of the Bailiff let it set in how much tradition Jersey holds.\"\n\nHe added: \"I came for the title, but left with friends.\"\n\nPictured: Sue de Guelle (left) and Mel Guest (right) who made up the Parslows team which helped James Kaye (centre) acquire his new title.\n\nSumming up what the title of Seigneur du Fief ès Poingdestre means to him in one word, Mr Kaye said: \"Duty.\"\n\n\"The greatest thing a person can do in this earth is to be of service to our fellow man,\" he explained. \"I feel a sense of obligation to the citizens of Jersey, and I intend to follow through with that. This is not a novelty to me, it’s an honor and something that I take seriously.\n\n\"I look forward to bringing my children with me to the Channel Islands so they can gain an understanding of what should be expected from them when it’s one of their turns to be the Seigneur or Dame de Poingdestre.\"\n\nSupport for Jèrriais\n\nMr Kaye also added that he intends to donate to the preservation of Jèrriais, and also hopes to learn the historic language with his children.\n\nPictured: \"Being in the Royal Court in front of the Bailiff let it set in how much tradition Jersey holds.\"\n\nHe hopes to return to the island for the Coronation Celebrations in May, but will definitely be in Jersey in September for the Assise D'Heritage.\n\n\"I plan to be there two or three times a year going forward,\" added Mr Kaye.\n\nHe concluded: \"If this title gives me a small podium to speak from, then I'll make the most of it and do the best work I can for Jersey and the US to improve the lives of our people.\""
