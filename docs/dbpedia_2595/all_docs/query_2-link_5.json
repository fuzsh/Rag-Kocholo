        "text": "\"A reformer\" and a \"quiet man\" is how the Seigneur of Sark has been described after his death on Sunday.\n\nMichael Beaumont, a successful aircraft engineer, inherited the title from his grandmother, the Dame de Sark, Sibyl Hathaway, in 1974.\n\nLt Col Reg Guille, President of Chief Pleas, said the news came as a shock and he would be missed.\n\nHis son, Maj Christopher Beaumont, has inherited the title from his father and will become the 23rd Seigneur.\n\nLt Col Guille said: \"He was a quiet man, a very private gentleman but ran the island quietly and firmly but he wasn't a showman.\n\n\"He saw the title as his duty that he willingly gave his life over to.\"\n\nThe minister responsible for Crown dependencies, Lord Faulks said: \"I was deeply saddened to hear today of the passing of Michael Beaumont, Seigneur of Sark. Our thoughts are with his wife Diana and his children.\""
