        "text": "Sir Thomas Hoo, KG (ca 1396-1455) was an English nobleman. Thomas inherited the estates of his father as Lord of Hoo. He was made a Knight of the Garter for his service fighting in France. He also held titles as Sheriff of Bedfordshire and Chancellor of France. He was granted the barony of Hastings in 1443, thereby becoming Lord of Hoo and Hastings.\n\nThomas married twice and had four daughters, but no sons. Upon his death in 1455, the barony became extinct.\n\nThomas Hoo in Atlantis[]\n\nIn 1452, Baron Thomas Hoo learned of Edward Radcliffe's plan to establish a settlement in the newly discovered Atlantis. Hoo had heard that Radcliffe was going to take the whole community of Hastings. When Radcliffe convinced him that only a small settlement was going, and that the new settlement would still maintain ties to Hastings, Hoo was mollified, although he realised that Radcliffe was really trying to escape the troubles that England was facing. However, Hoo didn't particularly care, and so let Radcliffe go.[1]\n\nThe small Atlantean town of Hooville was named for Hoo. By the 18th century, this fact was obscure even to its own residents.[2]"
