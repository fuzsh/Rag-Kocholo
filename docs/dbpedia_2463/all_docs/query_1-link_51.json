        "text": "What does it say about a college basketball team that is able to follow its coach’s directions, not panic and stay the course instead of going into the “let’s start launching a lot of 3-pointers” mode when falling behind by several double-digit margins?\n\n“It’s a good indication that we’re coming together and maturing,” junior swingman Larry Anderson said Saturday night after Long Beach State rallied to knock off visiting UC Irvine, 86-78, at Walter Pyramid to run its Big West Conference record to 4-0.\n\nThe 49ers trailed by 15 points nine minutes into the game and by 12 four minutes into the second half.\n\nAnderson was echoing his coach’s sentiments from just minutes earlier.\n\n“Give the guys credit,” Dan Monson said. “A problem that we’ve had when teams are hitting us like that is in trying to keep our composure and not panic and go off on our own.\n\n“But I thought our guys did a better job of staying together and not getting frustrated, better than at any time over the past few years that I’ve been here.”\n\nNaturally, it also helps when those athletes who are keeping their poise also happen to be among the players who have already demonstrated that they are among the best in the conference.\n\nOne of those is Anderson, a 6-foot-5 Jordan High graduate who picked up his second consecutive Big West Conference Player of the Week accolade Monday.\n\nAnderson, playing with a splint on his left hand to protect the bone broken that forced him to miss six games, totaled 41 points, 14 rebounds, 10 assists and seven steals in the victories over Cal State Northridge and UC Irvine last week.\n\nThe 49ers have 8 p.m. home conference games with UC Davis and Pacific on Wednesday and Saturday this week.\n\nOther stuff\n\nThe 8 p.m. tip-offs (instead of the usual 7:05 starts) for the Long Beach games were dictated by the television networks.\n\nESPNU (with former Mater Dei and University of Arizona guard Miles Simon doing color) has the game with UC Davis, while Prime Ticket (with former Clippers forward Michael Cage part of the broadcast team) has the Saturday tilt with Pacific.\n\nA major reason that the Miami Heat has won 21 of its last 22 games after its 9-8 start has been the improved contributions of players not named LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\n\nThat being conceded, let’s say that the “Big Three” – whose formation drew so much borderline-vitriol – are why the Heat look every bit the team to beat come June.\n\nHere are some numbers that border on staggering:\n\nDuring the Heat’s 107-100 overtime win in Portland on Sunday night, James (44), Wade (34) and Bosh (18) combined for all of but 11 of the club’s points.\n\nThe Clippers play host to Miami on Wednesday night and, suddenly, it’s no longer the “Ho, hum … who are LeBron and the boys going to pound tonight?” type affair most would have anticipated after the Clippers’ 1-13 start.\n\nIt’s now the no-question-about-it, full-fledged “Game of the Night” – if not “The Week” – in the NBA.\n\nWith the way that Blake Griffin and Eric Gordon (all season) and Baron Davis and DeAndre Jordan (of late) having been playing, all the buzz isn’t going to be because of a particular trio of Miami players.\n\nBoth teams are unranked and neither squad will finish in front of Washington, a near-lock to roll to the Pacific-10 Conference title, but that was, potentially, a significant victory for USC over UCLA on Sunday night at Galen Center.\n\nWatching the Trojans play for the first time in person this season only confirmed what I thought before I walked into the building Sunday night: Kevin O’Neill is, at least right now, coaching the second-best team in the conference.\n\nThe Trojans’ 6-foot-10 junior Nikola Vucevic – easily the best player on the floor Sunday night – is one of just two guys (Washington junior guard Isaiah Thomas is the other) who have a hope of finishing in front of Arizona sophomore Derrick Williams for conference Player of the Year honors.\n\nAs for the Bruins, not only is their guard play going to have to be much better than it was Sunday night, but the sophomore forwards perceived to be their best players – Reeves Nelson and Tyler Honeycutt – are going to have to play a lot more assertively, intelligently and efficiently than they did over the course of 40 minutes against the Trojans through the rest of conference to keep them in the NCAA Tournament at-large bid conversation.\n\nCoach Andy Sythe’s LBSU track and field/cross country program will holds its annual awards program Saturday at The Grand.\n\nFestivities get underway at 1 p.m. with a social mixer, followed by lunch at 1:30 and the awards presentation at 2:30. The cost per person is $35. For more information, contact Brady Hart at 562-985-4662 or bhart@csulb.edu."
