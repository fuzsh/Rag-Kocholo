        "text": "Thomas Ray Mayes, 78, of Caldwell, Texas, passed away peacefully on Monday, November 22, 2021, surrounded by his loving family.\n\nA public visitation will be held on Saturday, November 27, 2021, from 10:00 to 11:00 a.m. in the chapel at Phillips & Luckey Funeral Home, Caldwell.\n\nGraveside service will follow at 11:30 a.m. at Caldwell Masonic Cemetery.\n\nThomas was born on October 8, 1943, in Hidalgo County, Edinburg, Texas, to Frank and Ruby Clark Mayes.\n\nAfter graduation from La Joya High School, Tom became an employee of the U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service in 1961. During his career he worked at his hometown of Mission and served at Groveton, Houston and Woodville before transferring to Caldwell in January of 1970. Thomas retired from the U.S.D.A Natural Resources Conservation Service at the end of 2010 with 19 years of service. He walked out the door on Friday as a retiree and back in on Monday as a part-time employee of the Burleson County Soil and Water Conservation District and was an Earth Team Volunteer with the Natural Resources Conservation Service.\n\nTom felt blessed to have a career that allowed him to work with landowners and contractors on private land and assist them with the application of sound conservation practices in an effort to preserve our natural resources for future generations. He left his mark on the land with hundreds of farm ponds constructed, hundreds of acres of irrigation land leveling and miles of underground irrigation pipe lines installed.\n\nTom served as the Burleson County 4-H Rifle Club adult leader and rifle coach for over 23 years. He was a volunteer instructor for the Texas Hunters Safety Program and always began the new club every year with a Hunter Safety course that was also open to the public. He was proud of the fact that his teams competed at the 4-H District Contest and won district 20 of the 23 years he was their coach. He had 10 shooters on the line five nights per week for nine months of the season. He said that when his students graduated, got married and then brought their children into the rifle club it was time for him to step down. It was a rewarding experience to work with the youth and seeing them grow in their leadership ability and to master their marksmanship skills while focusing on firearm safety and responsibility.\n\nTom also served as president of the Caldwell Cemetery Association and felt that it was a calling by God for him to serve. His tasks were many, ranging from lot sales and recording funerals to trimming trees, mowing, removing old flowers and the endless task of fighting the imported fire ants. Tom took pride and felt honored to have been asked to serve on the board of directors that began in 1996 following the death of his son.\n\nAfter his retirement Tom was asked if he planned to travel. He said, as long as I can sleep in my own bed when the sun goes down. He considered himself a simple man with simple needs. His passion was working around the house and building simple woodworking projects. As you drive through the county you will see hundreds of Eastern Blue Bird nesting boxes that he built for landowners that has goals in wildlife management. He believed that if you enjoyed what you were doing you were on vacation all the time.\n\nTom was preceded in death by his parents; his son, Jesse; son-in-law, Domingo Lopez; and his brother, William F. Mayes of Pharr, Texas.\n\nHe is survived by his loving and faithful wife, Velma; his daughter, Karen and her husband, Andrew Rabroker, of Carrollton; grandsons, Justin and his wife, Kodie Rabroker, Scott and Robby Rabroker; and granddaughter, Sammi Rabroker; granddaughter, Sara and her husband, Leo, of Wasilla Alaska; as well as two great-grandsons, Thomas Rabroker of Carrollton and Baron Moreau of Wasilla, Alaska. He is also survived by his step-daughters, Charlotte and husband, Dan Strong, of Chriesman, Tanya and her husband, Tommy Ihlenfeldt, also of Chriesman. Stepgrandchildren, Kara and husband, Brandon Cavin, of Caldwell, Kellie and husband, Kaleb Hairston, of Rockdale, Willie Ihlenfeldt, Leighla and D.J. Strong of Chriesman; and one great-granddaughter, Kami Hairston.\n\nTom leaves the world at peace with his creator, God Almighty and in the words of His Son Jesus, “In my Father’s house there are many rooms. I go to prepare a place for you so that where I am, you may be also and if this was not true, I would have told you.” The road through life from the cradle to the grave may not always be smooth, therefore you must live each day to the fullest, as yesterday is gone and tomorrow may never come. Miss me, but let me go.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please consider a charitable contribution to the Caldwell Masonic Cemetery, P.O. Box 172, Caldwell, Texas 77836. Please include a return address to receive documentation for your charitable contribution.\n\nExpress condolences at Phillipsandluckey.com."
