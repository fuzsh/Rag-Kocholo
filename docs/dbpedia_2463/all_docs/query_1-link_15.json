        "text": "The Baron de Bastrop Chapter of the Daughters of the Republic of Texas held its Oct. 10, 2014 meeting in the upstairs conference room of the First National Bank of Bastrop.\n\nMembers, associate members, and friends of the chapter packed the room to hear two members of the Burleson Family Association speak about their ancestors and the part that they played in building the early Republic and state of Texas.\n\nNancy McLarry and Margaret Fields came to speak about their Association and their ancestors. Nancy and Margaret met at a family reunion. The Burleson family descendants still hold one of the largest family reunions in the state each year and Nancy and Margaret have played a big part in finding descendants and proving ancestry and kinship in order to grow the family association and its reunion.\n\n“We publish a bulletin,” McLarry said, “and our goal is to connect all Burleson lines.” McLarry is the president of the Genealogy Society of Kendall County and the president of the Burleson Family Association. Fields has been listed in the Who’s Who of High School Teachers for five years.\n\n“All the Burlesons had an undying hatred of Indians from the time that their ancestor, Aaron Burleson the first came to America. Aaron the first fought in the American Revolution. Later, Aaron II was killed in Tennessee by Indians and Abby Burleson McFadden was scalped by Indians. They felt they owed a vengeance to the Indians. The Burleson family was known as a wild family. The family was known as scrappers then, and most of them still carry that reputation now,” McLarry said with a wry smile.\n\nThe Burlesons moved quite a bit, and wherever they moved, they joined the militia. “Edward fought in the Creek Wars at the age of 14,” McLarry said, “and was a veteran in the War of 1812.” He married Sarah Griffin Owen at age 18 and moved into Tennessee. After seven years there, he decided to come to Texas. They settled in Bastrop, but after the tragic killing of their son by their daughter’s husband, they left Bastrop and moved to San Marcos.\n\nEdward Burleson served first under Stephen F. Austin in the opening stages of the Texas Revolution. He was appointed a lieutenant colonel in the Texas army. During the Siege of Bexar, he became second-in-command to Austin. In 1835, he was elected Major General of Texas Volunteers and took command of the volunteer army. Appointed a Colonel of Texas Regulars in March, he led the First Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the Runaway Scrape and at the Battle of San Jacinto. He eventually earned the title of Brigadier General of Texas. After the Revolution, Edward served as the first vice-president of the Republic of Texas. He died of pneumonia at the age of 53.\n\nColonel James Burleson, Sr., Edward’s father was also a great freedom fighter. He fought under his son at the siege of Bexar. He married Mary Randolph Buchanan Christian. Mary and her first husband, Thomas Christian, came to Texas in 1832 and settled in Mina (Bastrop) where they obtained a grant of a league of land in Austin’s Little Colony. In 1833, they moved north to Webber’s Fort on the Colorado River. Thomas Christian was scalped and murdered in the Wilbarger Massacre in 1833. Mary and her children then moved to Reuben Hornsby’s fort in 1834. There, she met and married Colonel James Burleson, Sr. in 1834. They had one daughter, before he died of wounds received in the “Grass Fight.”\n\nOne of James’ contemporaries, Samuel CA Rogers, had this to say about James: “In speaking of the Grass Fight, I’ve ever been of the opinion that we would have retreated had it not been for the bravery displayed by old man James Burleson, the father of General Edward Burleson. The Mexicans were so concealed, we didn’t know where they were. He, on his fine horse rode right up to the ditch in a storm of cannon and musketry, exclaiming, “Boys, we have but once to die. They are here in the ditch..charge them.” In all the discharge of bravery I have seen displayed by my fellow man, I have never seen anything like that.”\n\nAt Mina, in 1835, Mary Burleson and 10 women, including Cecilie, Samuel Craft’s African American slave, helped organize what is believed to be the second oldest Methodist Church in Texas. Later, Mary fled in the Runaway Scrape with the Jenkins and Burleson families. Once more widowed, she moved with her seven children to the Thomas Christian league and her house at the edge of the settlement was the first at the site of present day Elgin. She left the house because of Indian depredations and moved back to Bastrop, but returned in 1847 to Elgin. In the 1870s Mary encouraged her sons-in-law to obtain a charter for a school known as the Burleson Male and Female Academy. It was not well attended because the population in the area was so sparse, and it later closed, when a school was organized in Elgin. Today, her old and dilapidated home still stands in Elgin, and is a candidate for restoration. It is still a testament to the legendary Burleson name in Texas history.\n\nMary died on May 20, 1870 and is buried in the Christian-Burleson Cemetery on the Christian league.\n\nThe Burlesons all exhibited the same traits, McLarry said. They were loyal, strong willed, determined, and had a great willingness to explore.”\n\n“However, times change,” she added. She explained with a laugh that while the Burlesons were in North Carolina, one of her ancestors married a Chickasaw Indian. “I am part Chickasaw Indian and very proud of that part of my heritage, too. “ McLarry said she is a Chickasaw Elder and served on the tribal Council for several years. She is now secretary of the Chickasaw Council. McLarry displayed to her audience, a picture of her in her tribal dress.\n\nFields concluded their talk, as the misty eyed audience looked on, by saying, “These people left their cozy homes to brave blue northers, lack of food, loss of husbands and wives. They worked the land alone. They risked everything to build the safe, comfortable lives that we enjoy today.\n\n.In other chapter news, Associate member Cathy Smith gave a wonderful talk honoring Gonzales Day. Gonzales, the center of much of the activity of the Texas Revolution, became famous for their “come and take it” flag after Mexican officials demanded that the settlers turn over a small cannon. The cannon only weighed six pounds, but for the settlers, it was the principle of the thing. “It was good for little more than starting horse races,” Smith said.\n\nBecause settlers refused to hand the cannon over, what was originally known as “The Fight at William’s Farm” became the Battle of Gonzales, and the Republic of Texas was born. “The Gonzales skirmish launched the Texas Revolution,” Cathy said.\n\nMembers welcomed Cynthia Lee into the chapter. Lee transfers her membership from the San Jacinto Chapter. Welcome Cynthia!\n\nRebecca Kasprzyk finished the chapter quilt. This lovely quilt depicting Texas images and made by chapter members will soon be raffled off to a lucky winner.\n\nMembership in the Daughters of the Republic of Texas is open to any woman of lineal descent from an ancestor who lived in Texas during the period of the Republic (1836-46). Associate memberships are also available for those who are interested in Texas history and the work of the Daughters. Associate memberships are $20 per year.
