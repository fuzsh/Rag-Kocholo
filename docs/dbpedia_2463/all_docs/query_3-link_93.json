        "text": "Kenny Bednarek is setting the track on fire at the 2024 Paris Olympics for Team USA, but did you know he is from a small town in Wisconsin?\n\nFamous Summer Olympians From Wisconsin\n\nPlease excuse my ignorance here, but when it comes to Olympic events I assume Wisconsinites would shine in, winter events like skating and skiing come to mind way before summer sports. Why? I don't know, and I have no problem admitting I was way off base.\n\nThe truth is, Wisconsin is home to several athletes competing in the Paris 2024 Olympic games, and one of the brightest stars to watch is Kenny Bednarek from Rice Lake, Wisconsin.\n\nFrom what I‚Äôve seen, the guy is lightning fast. He‚Äôs already got an Olympic silver medal from the Tokyo 2020 games, plus a few other impressive titles, and he‚Äôs looking super strong in these Paris games. In fact, Bednarek just became the first sprinter to crack 20 seconds in these Olympics, earning him the title of the Fastest Man in the World when it comes to the 200m. So...I think the chances that he will be sporting some gold around his neck this week are looking pretty darn good!\n\nJust look how fast this guy is!\n\n@nbcolympics No extra energy and Kenny Bednarek made that 200m look easy. üòÆ‚Äçüí® #ParisOlympics #usatf #teamusa #kennybednarek #trackandfield ‚ô¨ original sound - NBC Olympics & Paralympics\n\nFun Fact About Kenny Bednarek\n\nWhen I was searching for more information about Kenny Bednarek, I came across several comments in Wisconsin groups that referred to him as \"Kung Fu Kenny\", and I had to know the reason behind the nickname.\n\nApparently, Kenny gained the nickname due to the fact that he usually wears a Rambo-like bandana ties around his head while he races.\n\nMaybe this is why he named his dog Rambo too?\n\nEither way, it's inspiring to watch someone from our neck of the woods work so hard and achieve their dreams. All of Wisconsin and Illinois are rooting for you, Kung Fu Kenny! We're looking forward to seeing you on that podium soon!\n\nREAD MORE: Illinois Athletes To Watch For in Paris"
