Thus drop we off, one by one. We mus all die - to the earth belongs our mortality, and there it must remain until the resurrection day. Our beloved brother, during his life, taught us by his Godly manner of living, that there is a life beyond the tomb to live for, and in his death he also taught us how a christian can die To him death had no terrors, and was but the enterance to joys that never fade. He has shown us that it is not all of life to live, nor all of death to die. He was na Odd Fellow indeed, and adorned the percepts of our beloved Order, both in his life and death. Oh may we be permitted all to die as peacefully as he. We sympathize with his bereaved family, and will wear the usual badge of mourning for thirty days, and that the family of said brother be furnished with a copy of these proceedings under the seal of the Lodge.\n\nZ.

Sengelmann\n\nSunday afternoon at Schulenburg there was an immense gathering of friends, joining with the relatives to pay their last respects to one of Schulenburgâs best citizens, Henry A. Sengelmann; La Grange sent a delegation of over a hundred, Flatonia, Weimar, High Hill, Swiss Alp and surrounding territory also sent large delegations.Â Henry Sengelmann was well known to them all, a gentleman in the sense of the word; a citizen of worth and a friend it was always a great pleasure to esteem.Â Henry died at the La Grange Hospital last Friday night, after having suffered for a day and a half from the effects of a wound received at his home at Schulenburg, inflicted while suffering from a severe nervous attack.Â Rushed to the Hospital and every effort made to save his life, he died after much suffering, rational to the last; smilingly entering upon the journey that lengthens and leaves many aching hearts behind.\n\nNervous prostration; an illness that yet challenges the mind of man to correctly describe, an illness that attacks the mental faculties and weakens the body, an illness that cancels responsibility of act.Â We knew Henry Sengelmann for many years; the interest and personal friendship was valuable to the writer, it was of that kind that makes men appreciate one another.Â Henry was the eldest son of Mr. and Mrs. Chas. Sengelmann, pioneer settlers of Schulenburg, the first of nine children to break the tie of many yearsâ standing, born in the year 1880, in March, forty-six years ago.Â He leaves to mourn his going, a widow and one daughter, Maxine, about sixteen years of age.Â His parents, four brothers and four sisters also survive.\n\nIn canceling the ties of a living relationship Henry has gone to his reward; we shall miss the smile and words of welcome that ever made his presence felt wherever he went; we shall miss the man, and as we place the last shovel of earth upon his couch, bury with him whatever were his faults, but we cannot efface from memory the knowledge of a man that made it agreeable to be recognized as one of his friends, neither can we destroy the influence that was his, among his fellow men.Â None knew him but to love him; that legacy left to his daughter, together with the knowledge that all will mourn, should comfort the relatives, one and all.\n\nOur sympathy goes out to them all; a parting is written in the book of life, at some place upon some page of that book; sometimes the book is opened and a page falls under our gaze too soon, so we think; sometimes the page is the last in the book, thereon is written the word, Peace.Â We mortals feel keenly the sting of death, it severs ties we believe are strong and enduring, but when the light grows dim, when the oil fades, the grim reaper makes his demands.Â As Henry lay there in his casket, a perfect bower of the most beautiful flowers surrounding his bier, telling in silent messages the love that was encouraged for him, the scene reminded us all of that old axiom:Â âWe part from the best we have.âÂ The widow, with tear-dimmed eyes, the little daughter, the aged parents, and brothers and sisters, bowed in grief, gave his face one last, lingering look, and departed; friends came forward, banked the floral offerings at the cemetery and the western sun sank slowly behind the hills.Â In silence the return journey was entered upon, in silence Henry will sleep on; memory of him, however, will be kept alive.\n\nContributed by Rob Brown\n\nGUSTAV H.

Upon the death of his father a number of years ago, he took over active management of the estate and carried on up until the time of his illness some eight years ago.Â Klondike was one of the best liked people of our community for he was not an excitable person and was socialable at all times. During his years of illness he never complained of his troubles and burden but was able to smile and seemed more interested in other peoples problems than his own. Everything that medical science could do was done to help him and due to the excellent care and attention of his devoted wife, other relatives and friends and his willingness to live, did he remain with us as long as he did.\n\nHe passed away here at the family residence on Tuesday, December 19, 1950, at about 5:00 a.m.\n\nSurvivors include his grief-stricken wife; three sisters, Mrs. Charles (Wally) Baumgarten of Schulenburg, Mrs. Hugo (Minnie) Horner of Houston and Mrs. Rudolph (Lillie) Seeberger of La Grange; two brothers, Alex Sengelmann of this city and H.

H. Seymour\n\n57 Years and 2 Months\n\nThe death of Dr. Robert Hemming Seymour occurred at his home Friday evening, March 26, 1909 at about 7 oâclock.Â The announcement came as a great surprise to his friends and acquaintances.\n\nDr. R. H. Seymour was born in Dublin, Ireland, January 26, 1852.Â At the age of four years he was left an orphan and was reared by an uncle.Â His preliminary education was obtained at St. Patrickâs high school and Waymouth university, in Ireland.Â He attended the medical department, University of Ireland in 1870, and graduated with the highest honors.Â When quite a young man he came to America landing at New Orleans while an epidemic of yellow fever was prevalent.Â Here, later, he was taken sick with swamp fever.Â During his illness he lost all his belongings, including his diploma.Â It was then that his hard life began.Â He went from New Orleans to Denison, Texas, but was without means to practice his profession.Â Here he procured work in a brick yard.Â One day, while all the force were at work, an accident occurred to one of the men.Â Knowing what to do, he took advantage of the opportunity, giving his assistance, and without proper facilities, was successful.Â The manager asked if he was a surgeon.Â The reply was:Â âI am, if I had the means to be one.âÂ The manager recognized his ability and helped him to get an appointment as railroad surgeon.\n\nFrom Denison he came to Fayette county, locating near Nechanitz to practice his profession.Â After a short time he located at Walhalla, and after practicing there a few years he moved to Warrenton, where he lived until his death.Â In 1878 he went before the medical board and received his state certificate.\n\nIn May, 1877, he was married to Miss Lizzie Lee, near Walhalla.Â The family was blessed with seven children.Â Four have preceded the father, three in infancy, and Mrs. Augusta Neumann, who died December 3, 1904.Â He leaves to mourn his departure his beloved wife, a son, Montague, and two daughters, Myrtle and Olivia.\n\nDr. Seymour was ever the man in whom the utmost confidence could be placed.Â As a neighbor he was universally liked, and his friends generally ---------Â by his acquaintances.\n\nSunday morning his remains were laid to rest in the Florida Chapel cemetery, near Warrenton, under the auspices of the W.

When the young Republic of the United States was struggling under a financial panic and President James Monroe was proclaiming his territorial doctrine of world-wide significance, she first opened her eyes in the Old Dominion where so many of the illustrious citizens of the United States first saw the light. When she was 6 or 7 years old her parents moved to Halifax County, where she grew up amid the trials of hardy settlers who early learned to be self-reliant and resourceful.\n\nWithout the conveniences of the modern world whe skillfully turned the wheel and plied the loom to make the linsey, lowell and jean for the clothes of a large family, of which whe was the eldest. She wove in intricate patterns the fancy counterpanes and tuffed coverlets and dainty valences for the coverings of the beds. No needles flew faster than hers when her little fingers knitted the samplers, stocking an mufflers to protect the family from the winter's cold.\n\nShe grew to womanhood amid the times when the girls were taught all the arts of housekeeping, from the manufacturing of the home products to the final making up of the finished material. Her social activities found expression in the \"apple bee,\" \"Corn husings,\" \"skating parties\" and \"Log rollings,\" at which times the young people lent a helping hand, while they miingled mirth and pleasure with a friendly neighbors need.\n\nOn February 22, 1836 she was married to John Adams Holloway, a promising young man of the neighborhood, and they moved to a little home where they began to accumulate a competency for comfortable living. In a short time they moved to Persons County, North Carolina, where they lived until 1845. Mr. Holloway soon won the confidence of the community arnd represented his people in the Legislature of the State.\n\nBut ere long wide rumors of a rich land far to the west of them with glowing descriptions of its boundless resources and exhaustless wealth to be had for asking, reached their ears. As young life is ever hopeful and buoyant and ready to attempt new ventures, this young couple with their four children started for Texasâthis El Dorado of the West.\n\nThey landed in Galvston, Tex. on March 1, 1845 the day that James K. Polk was inaagurated[sic.] President of the United States. They placed their belonging on ox wagons and started for the rich agricultural land of the Colorado bottom. In this day a? steam and electricity one can scarcely r? what the tedious process of traveling ta? interminable distances means. It is not strange that their courage rose with the dangers and hardships they encountered on that long and perilous journey, as they crossed swollen streams, followed narrow trails and camped in dark, dismal forests. Yet in that teeming wilderness all nature sang in their buoyant spirits, from the fairy rinkle of the snow to the roaring boom of the storm-swept sea, from the soft melody of the warbling birds to the rushing sound of the plunging stream, from the low whisper of the long lost preze to the muttering thunder of the distant storm.\n\nWhen they reached the Colorado bottom Mr. Holloway purchased 1000 acres of that rich, fertile land for $1000. Here they lived in a board shanty until they could erect a respectable log cabin like those of their nearest neighbors, five or six miles away. They planted a crop, and in the meantime plenty of wild turkeys, deer and fish furnished ample provisions until the first crop came in. Wild hogs fattened on the mast in the bottom and unclaimed cattle housed there in the winter; so food was abundant and easy to obtain. They were beginning to establish themselves comfortably when the young husband died and left the wife with four small children.\n\nHaving no facilities for educating her children in this unsettled country, she moved to Ruttersville[sic.], where one of the best colleges at that time in the State was situated. This flourishing institution was then presided over by Rev. Josiah Richardson, a prominent Methodist minsiter, and the teachers Mr. and Mrs. Halsey and Miss Mary Chapman.\n\nAfter Mrs. Holloway had been in Rutersville two or three years she was married to P. J. Shaver. They lived here a short time and then moved to Ross Prairie, where Mr. Shaver laid off the beautiful little town of Fayetteville, which he named for Fayetteville, Tenn., which had formerely[sic.] been his home. He gave away every second lot to induce settlers to come in. Here they built another log cabin, which was the popular and hospitable stopping place for the preachers of that day. Revs. Robert Alexander, Isaac Johns, the Elder Rabb and many others often found a comfortable resting place in this pious home.\n\nMrs. Shaver was a beautiful, cultured and energetic young woman, whose conversation engaged the attention of her acquaintances, who viewed[sic.] with one another for her favor.\n\nShe was the mother of sixeen children, eleven of whom lived to maturity. Mr. Shaver died in 1875, leaving her a widow once more. Trials, struggles, temptations and harships have swept across her path as she has journeyed along, but she is fortified with that strength which comes through Christian grace; and today in the ninety-second year of her age, in the full possession of all her faculties, she stands the marvel of all who knew her. A brilliant conversationalist, she interests an entire circle with her wonderful memory of past events and still more wonderful interst and knowledge of present affiars. She amuses herself and others by her sharply drawn contrasts between the old and the \"new-fangled\" style of ladies; dresses, in which she delights to score the\"hobble skirt,\" which makes the ladies look like \"slim pumpkin quills\" beside the wide \"hoop skirt\" that she used to wear when she was a girl. In the culinary deparmtnet she scorns the \"poor, skinny, soda-raised,\" cookery of the present \"paper-bag age,\" and says that the \"Martha Washington Cook Book,\" with its rich recipes of old Virginia days, is the book for her.\n\nEverybody in the town where she lives appeals to her now for the best way to prepare anything in the culinary line, from the fancy cutting and stuffing of her attradtive[sic.] mangoes to the making of her dilicious[sic.] mincemeat and shaping her artistic citron.\n\nShe has seven children living, thirty-six grandchildren and forty-three great-grandchildren. They gathered around her on each recurring birthday to partake of an old-fashioned dinner prepared by one of her faithful old house-servants, Adlena McGruder, who knows how \"Miss Ann used to have things done.\" She surprises the younger generation by the lavish and novel festive board that she spreads. The table is a dream of beauty with its quaint, old-fashioned dishes whose names the younger folks have scarcely heard. The minutest detail, from the roast pig with its apple to the tall \"stack cake\" embossed in fancy designs, are planned and executed under the special directions of \"Grandma\" Shaver's fertile brain and active hand. On her last birthday over one hundred of her descendants, with a few near old friends, met to celebrate the day.\n\nAs the glory of the sunset gathers around her beautiful aged brow, her worthy character reflects the radiance of a virtuous and holy life, spent in unselfish activity and service for others. She sets and dreams of the past and lives in the present, while she waits with regisnation[sic.] for the time when the great Father shall hold her busy hands in a long and dreamless slepp. â The above was published in the San Antonio Express last October.\n\nROBERT SHAVER\n\nColorado Citizen, 26 Jan 1882, page 2\n\nWe learn with deep regret of the death of Mr. Robert Shaver, of Ellinger, on last Thursday.

Whereupon Zapp indignantly called him \"a liar.\" Sholes then drew a pistol and placed it into Zapp's face. Zapp seized a shotgun laying on the counter and emptied two loads of buckshot into Sholes' breast and killed him instantly. He then gave himself up and was placed under a $1000 bond. Public opinion exonerates Zapp entirely, as Sholes has lately made a practice of drawing his pistol on various occasions.âHouston Post Telegram.\n\nAUGUSTUS LUDLOW CAESAR SHROPSHIRE\n\nWeimar Mercury, 26 Sep 1896, page 7\n\nYoakum, Texas, September 26. âMr. A.

It seems that the father was a man of very bad temper ad in the habit of illtreating [sic.] his family. On the day he was killed he had beaten his wife severely, threatened to kill her, and had driven off the place his two youngest sons, threatening to kill them. One of these boys went after his older brother, who lives about a mile distant from his father's place. Upon the son's arrival the father advanced upon him with a loaded gun cocked threatening his life, when the son fired, the ball entering his father's forehead and killing him instantly. The case was examined before Justice SELLERS on the 6th, L. F. PRICE and H. TEICHMUELLER appearing for the defendant and the County Attorney in behalf of the State. The prisoner after a hearing of the evidence was held to bail in the sum of $8,000, and failing to give bond he was committed to jail.\n\nThis grave appears to be unmarked.\n\nCHARLOTTE SIMMONS\n\nWeimar Mercury, 15 Jul 1893, page 2\n\nLa Grange Journal: . . .

A large number of friends and relatives were present to pay their last respects to the departed.\n\nHenry Skarke was born in Wagstadt, Austria, Nov. 4, 1874. Came to Schulenburg with his parents when a boy of thirteen and assisted his father on the farm until eighteen years of age, at which time he went to Galveston and learned the baker trade, returning four years later to Schulenburg and engaged in the bakery business and later in the saloon business. His health gradually grew worse and he decided to locate in Galveston where he was the proprietor of the Sea Wall City Bakery and worked faithfully and hard to make a living for his beloved family. Last July, almost a year ago he took very sick and suffered greatly from that day until death relieved him of pain.\n\nJust before going to Mineral Wells he expressed the wish that he would like to spend a few days with his old time friends in Schulenburg. This wish was granted and he enjoyed his stay here among his relatives and friends very much. At Mineral Wells he seemed to improve and hopes for his recovery were very bright for a few days but He that doeth all things well decided otherwise and Mr. Skarke was called to that great beyond.

Mr. Thos. Slack died at his family residence at Pecan, in Fayette county, of dropsy, on Sunday, 25th inst. Mr. Slack was raised in Fayette county, and was known as a good and substantial citizen. He leaves a wife and quite a family of children, besides a host of friends, to mourn his loss. We hear an appropriate obituary will be written by one of his friends and published. His remains were buried in the Odd Fellowsâ Rest in this city last Monday. Peace to his ashes.\n\nColorado Citizen, February 5, 1885\n\nObituary\n\nDied, January 25, 1885, of dropsy, at his residence at Pecan, Fayette county, Texas, six miles north of Weimar, Thomas Slack. All that was mortal of him was consigned to mother earth in the Odd Fellowsâ Rest, at Weimar, on the 26th of January. It is a sad thing to write an obituary notice of an esteemed friend. It is a solemn thing to stand around the death bed of a dying stranger, and witness the pangs of dissolution; but when monstrous Death lays his relentless clutches upon those that we know and love the awful solemnity of the occasion baffles all description. âDeath loves a shining mark,â and when its piercing arrows were aimed at Thomas Slack the fated target was not wanting in splendid brightness. I knew that man better than men commonly know their friends. To express myself in brief, he was true and noble. Being naturally a little eccentric, it required some cultivated acquaintance to appreciate him fully. Those that knew him best loved him most. A few days before his death he told me that he was not afraid to die; that he had done nothing to make him afraid of death. He was a member of the Baptist church, and his practical life was consistent with his professions. He was born in Mississippi, but from early childhood reared in Fayette county Texas; enlisted in the Confederate army at a very youthful age; was a true and gallant soldier; was true and gallant in every station of life that he filled--true to his country, true to his family, true to his friends. Such a man is sadly missed in his community. He leaves a wife and eight children, and many friends to mourn his death. With my heartfelt sympathy for them, I respectfully submit this notice for publication, to the La Grange Journal, and the Colorado Citizen.\n\nVery respectfully,\n\nH. C.
