The right hand light is an effigy of the Archangel Michael, holding the sword and scales of justice, standing on the head of the Prince of Darkness. The left hand light represents St George of England. The centre light represents Sir Galahad seeing the vision of the Holy Grail. Each light bears the name of the figure it depicts.

The firm of Burlison & Grylls was founded in 1868 at the instigation of the architects George Frederick Bodley and Thomas Garner.

Thomas John Grylls (1845-1913) and John Burlison (1843-1891) were encouraged to leave their apprenticeships with Clayton & Bell and set up their stained glass firm which built a considerable reputation for its fine work over the next 40 years. They became one of the most successful stained glass firms in England.

Following Thomas John Grylls' death in 1913, the firm was continued by his son Thomas Henry Grylls (1873-1953), although effectively it can be said to have closed shortly after its London premises were bombed and all records destroyed in 1945.
