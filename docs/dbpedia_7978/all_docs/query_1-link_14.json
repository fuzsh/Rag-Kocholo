        "text": "A project that a colleague and I have been working on has finally hit the shelves.\n\nIn case any of my readers have interest, below is a description and links to the publisher and the Amazon portal:\n\nAs interest in Owen Barfield grows, we aim to meet the need for a scholarly introduction to his thought. Our primary purpose is to present an overview, analysis, and synthesis of Barfield’s most salient ideas in a manner that will be of interest to neophytes and initiates alike. Barfield’s work can, at times, be difficult to understand; C. S. Lewis put it well when he described Barfield’s style of argument as “dark, labyrinthine,” and “pertinacious.” But Lewis ardently promoted Barfield’s work because he knew that people who willingly walk in those dim and winding corridors are, in time, richly rewarded by the bright light at their end. We offer the present work in service to those who wish to undertake this adventure. While the present book will help those readers who wish to engage Barfield for the sake of achieving a greater understanding of and appreciation for other writers who have been associated with or influenced by him, we aim first and foremost to present Barfield as a profound and original thinker in his own right.\n\nBarfield was called the “first and last Inkling,” referring to his seminal and essential role in the literary circle at Oxford throughout the 1930s and ‘40s, of which Tolkien and Lewis were also members. Barfield’s theories on the evolution of consciousness and his willingness to take up the mantle of Anthroposophy has led many to regard him, often with no small amount of circumspection, as a “gateway drug” to the apparently unorthodox teachings of Steiner. Obviously, I don’t see Steiner this way but it can’t be denied that the perception is not uncommon and it is, moreover, perfectly understandable how this perception arises. After all, they killed all the prophets. In any case, my own path was the reverse of this: I first encountered Steiner and hence, Barfield’s style of argumentation has never felt “labyrinthine” or “pertinacious” to me. Instead, it has felt perfectly intelligible and even somewhat akin to reading “downhill,” as it were, because of his fine mastery of English and the subtle logic of his arguments that is never heavy-handed. If I could fault Barfield with anything, it would be not with overstating his case but with withdrawing from his advance at the moment of crisis. But this is more of a question of personal taste than a fault of Barfield himself, who has earned my praise and admiration many times over.\n\nIn any case, some readers have been kind enough to offer the following endorsements, below which I have, as promised. included links to the publisher page as well as the Amazon portal where the book can be purchased.\n\n“A quarter of a century after Owen Barfield’s death, appreciation and scholarship of his important work is gaining ground and this book stands as a testament to the fact. The authors have skillfully crafted a balanced and measured response to the forthright question: What is Barfieldian philosophy teaching us?”\n\n—Owen A. Barfield, grandson and trustee\n\n“People who know the work of Owen Barfield—including figures such as C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, T. S. Eliot, and W. H. Auden—affirm that it is not only remarkably interesting, but revolutionary. Wrestling with his thought changes your experience of the world, and this clearly written, thoughtful introduction will lead you to such radical possibilities.”\n\n—Mark Vernon, author of A Secret History of Christianity: Jesus, the Last Inkling, and the Evolution of Consciousness\n\n“Loftin and Leyf have provided us with the sort of rich but succinct introduction to Owen Barfield’s thought that has been needed for some time. Barfield’s seminal linguistic and poetic theories made an impact on his fellow Inklings, C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, and although Barfield continues to be an influence today, he is too often overshadowed by the other Inklings. A useful guidebook is welcome. Here we have one.”\n\n—Addison Hodges Hart, author of The Woman, the Hour, and the Garden: A Study of Imagery in the Gospel of John\n\n“Arguably one of the most important thinkers—romantic or otherwise—of the twentieth century, Owen Barfield has also been one of the most tragically and criminally forgotten. When remembered, he is nearly always an appendage to either C. S. Lewis or J. R. R. Tolkien. Yet, Barfield deserves to be remembered in his own right. Loftin and Leyf have done exactly what desperately needed to be done—they have placed Barfield at the profound center of his own intellectual story.”\n\n—Bradley J. Birzer, author of Tolkien and the Inklings: Men of the West\n\n“Loftin and Leyf have succeeded in writing precisely the introduction I wish had existed when I began my own studies of Barfield’s thought. This will be a helpful text for newcomers as well as veteran Barfieldians still struggling with difficult distinctions between alpha- and beta-thinking or original and final participation. Interest in Barfield has surged over the past decade, and this timely volume represents one of the best attempts to stand (as Barfield says of Coleridge) ‘inside’ his thought rather than ‘beside’ it.”\n\n—Jake Grefenstette, University of Cambridge\n\nhttps://wipfandstock.com/9781666736762/what-barfield-thought/"
