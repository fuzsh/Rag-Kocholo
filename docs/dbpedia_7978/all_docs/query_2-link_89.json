        "text": "It would be true to claim that, besides all the quests and adventures, John R R Tolkien wrote about relationships in the first place. About tight knots between souls of various creatures: elfs, humans, dwarfs, hobbits, after all. It is extremely easy to recall examples of such close, hearty connections: simply take members of the Fellowship of the Ring, Frodo and Sam, Aragorn and Arwen and all the others. Love and friendship were these crucial aspects of life which Tolkien himself was never deprived of. He cherished people around him and was considered to be the life of the party.\n\nAccording to Carpenter (2002, p. 50) Tolkien had a “great capacity for making friends” and, as we have already covered, was happily married to his muse and love of his whole life for over half of the century. John was always surrounded by bright, like-minded people who pushed him to the new extremes of his talents and vice versa.\n\nOf course, to enumerate and investigate the lives of all of Tolkien’s people would be impossible but we will step in the most important connections of his, get acquainted with the ones he loved and trace their reflections in the legendarium.\n\nSo, to cut a huge story short (just at the beginning, later it will still turn out to be overextended, as does every time), there were two fellowships in which Tolkien proudly participated and one lifelong love story that we are to study today.\n\nThe close and enduring bond between the renowned trio of Tolkien, Lewis and Barfield was, perhaps, the most powerful and influential one in the history of the Inklings. Tolkien and Lewis were both masterful authors of works that encompassed fantasy and related genres, which proved to be a strong tightrope between hearts of two dreamers, while Barfield was an acclaimed philosopher. The three shared a sincere friendship, marked by mutual respect and admiration for each other's works and ideas. They were all devout Christians, and this faith was a fundamental influence on their creations. Tolkien and Lewis also held a shared passion for mythology and folklore, which were often discussed in the meetings of the Inklings. The Lord of the Rings and The Chronicles of Narnia, were greatly informed by the ideas of Barfield. Barfield's concepts on the intimate relationship between language, myth and imagination were prime elements of both Tolkien and Lewis' fantasy realms. Barfield also wrote several literary pieces of his own, most notably Poetic Diction and Saving the Appearances.\n\nIt is now clear that the Inklings aided Tolkien in finding those numerous sources of material and inspiration that were poured in the creation of his epic trilogy. And what is more, it was also a society of good like-minded friends, who paved the way to greatness together.\n\nFinally, we are to draw on one person who connected all the periods and all the dots of Tolkien’s life and career together; who, probably, was the second human being who gave so much to Arda, and Middle-earth and every little bit that they consist of, that only Tolkien’s own input could outdo it.\n\nWhile still in his school years Tolkien made an acquaintance with Edith Bratt – an orphan girl, who was three years older than him. They were sixteen and nineteen respectively. At that time Edith had just finished her musical studies and was on a crossroad in life. Their relationship gradually grew from a devoted friendship to a true love. However, Tolkien’s guardian Father Francis Morgan disapproved of the union due to the age gap and religious incompatibility (Edith was a protestant) and prohibited young Tolkien to be anyhow connected with miss Bratt till his own coming of age.\n\nNext"
