The Agnostic philosopher, when he has been admitted to serial immortality, falls to playing chess, or learns to fiddle, or becomes a fanatical tennis-player.

Tolkien once aptly said, \"The story-maker proves a successful escapee from Time.\" This quote beautifully illustrates the power of storytelling and imagination as a means of transcending the limitations of time. In contrast, Tolkien suggests that those who do not engage in the creation of stories seek immortality in less meaningful pursuits. For instance, the agnostic philosopher may turn to mundane hobbies such as playing chess or fiddling, while the Scottish writer behind the scenes of space and time may divert his attention to activities like losing money at golf or backing horses at Kelso. Tolkien's remark emphasizes the profound impact of storytelling, allowing individuals to explore realms beyond the confines of time, rather than being confined to the constraints of a limited existence. His words serve as a reminder for us to embrace our creativity and the transformative power of tales, as they hold the key to timeless escape and boundless wonder.\n\nThe story-maker proves a successful escapee from Time.

The Agnostic philosopher, when he has been admitted to serial immortality, falls to playing chess, or learns to fiddle, or becomes a fanatical tennis-player. The Scot, who behind the space-time scene, has been writing another Waverley Novels, takes to losing his money at golf, or heavily backing horses at Kelso, or making bad debts in Edinburgh; or, from that limited eternity, drops into Scotland correspondent, and writes books on 'The Decline of the Aristocracy'.\n\nQuotes Interpret\n\nIn this quote, J.R.R. Tolkien portrays the story-maker as someone who transcends the limitations of time. Unlike the agnostic philosopher who seeks immortality through mundane hobbies or the Scottish writer who indulges in temporal distractions, the story-maker finds solace and liberation in the creation of narratives. Storytelling allows this individual to escape the constraints of time, unlocking realms of endless possibilities and imagination. By crafting their own worlds and characters, the story-maker is able to navigate through time and create their own legacy, avoiding the banalities that often plague those seeking immortality."
