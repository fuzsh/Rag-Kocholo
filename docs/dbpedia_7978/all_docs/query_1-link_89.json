        "text": "FUNDAMENTALS TO MISUNDERSTANDING POLITICS Chapter 0.2\n\nFundamentals to Misunderstanding Politics\n\nChapter 0.2 Why Are Maxims Adyanta\n\n(or “Tent Stakes”) Needed?\n\n(see Chapter 0.1 here)\n\nOak Boat: So why do we need this crap? Well, according to Dewitt T. Stame’s introduction to the Proverbs or Adages of Erasmus, proverbs and maxims (and maybe adyanta) are useful in four ways:\n\n(1) to promote the understanding of philosophy, (2) to strengthen argument, (3) to add ornament and gracefulness in speech and writing, and (4) to clarify the meaning of some of the best authors.\n\nAnd Stame also warns: “Erasmus cautions, however, that proverbs serve not as food but as condiments. They are not to be employed to weariness but for gracefulness.” [1]\n\nNewt Monk: The world has too many condiments these days; it’s choice anxiety that will bring us asunder.\n\nOak Boat: Well, it’s always a good idea to remember that tent stakes are not condiments.\n\nNewt Monk: Welp. And after Erasmus came Montesquieu:\n\nWith regard to mores, much is to be gained by keeping the old customs. Since corrupt peoples rarely do great things and have established few societies, founded few towns, and given few laws; and since, on the contrary, those with simple and austere mores have made most establishments, recalling men to the old maxims usually returns them to virtue. [2]\n\nOak Boat: Welp. And after Montesquieu came Rousseau (echoing ancient Solon):\n\nThe more you multiply laws, the more you cause them to be despised: and all the overseers you institute are nothing but new lawbreakers bound either to share [their bounty] with the old ones, or to do their plundering on their own. [3]\n\nNewt Monk: Welp. And before them all was Emperor Aurelius, telling us, and telling himself, that: “You will never be remarkable for quick-wittedness.” [4]\n\nOak Boat: Welp. And before Aurelius came Confucius, telling us, and telling himself, that: “The superior man wishes to be slow in his speech and earnest in his conduct.”[5]\n\nNewt Monk: Welp. And before Confucius came the end of the Third Age, where in the Red Book of Westmarch readers of this age are told that what we want to call a maxim (but can’t), and that thing that might be something between a catena and an adyanta, might once have been called a riddle. For:\n\nIn one thing you have not changed, dear friend,’ said Aragorn: ‘you still speak in riddles.’\n\n‘What? In riddles?’ said Gandalf. ‘No! For I was talking aloud to myself. A habit of the old: they choose the wisest person present to speak to; the long explanations needed by the young are wearying.’ He laughed, but the sound now seemed warm and kindly as a gleam of sunshine.[6]\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] Dewitt T.

And, as they drove us around and pointed at the various ancient stonework as seen under modern light fixtures, our Italian hosts picked our brains about American politics:\n\n“Would it be Trump or Hillary?” (“Hillary, of course!”)\n\n“What is your opinion about all these school shootings?” (“It’s a sort of pornography that the gun nuts enjoy indulging in.”)\n\nThere may’ve been other questions, better answers, but I don’t remember, except to make a note to myself to reread Boethius and Machiavelli once we got back home.\n\nOak Boat: Why?\n\nNewt Monk: It just seemed (at the time at least) like a practical thing to do, being a participating citizen of the American democratic experiment. I’d read them before, found some rules of thumb that seemed (at the time) wise on the surface, noteworthy at first glance, possibly valuable for pondering, bothering to brood on later, in other words, I took notes while reading them.\n\nOak Boat: Oh yes. And now that you’ve pondered and brooded and done all that?\n\nNewt Monk: It may be time to say goodbye to all that and now unlearn whatever it was I think I might’ve once learned.\n\nOak Boat: Is it that late in the day already?\n\nNewt Monk: I’m afraid so. For the things we think we learn too often turn out to be completely separate and disassociated from whatever it is we’ve actually learned and apprehended and put into practice without thinking about it.\n\nOak Boat: “All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.” [1]\n\nNewt Monk: Yes, and I think it’s time I unlearned everything. It’s time for me to pour out that knowledge onto the ground, in a kenosis-kind-of-way,[2] I guess. Let’s let it evaporate (and thus we won’t let it ever poison Old Isaac’s well). Let it never reach the nether-aquifer we tramp on all the days of our lives.\n\nOak Boat: Yeah, pour it out, get it out of your system, like the character of Rosalind in Shakespeare:\n\nI prithee tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. I would thou could’st stammer, that thou mightst pour this conceal’d man out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of narrow-mouth’d bottle––either too much at once or none at all. I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings. [3]\n\nNewt Monk: Before you now, Oak Boat, take I this oath, full of flowerily language, over-laden with pollen, overgrown with unpruned polyps:\n\nThe Oath\n\nLet me fast forthwith and abstain ever more from indulging in the emotionalism that forever accompanies the consumption of:\n\nany crumb (whether fresh or stale) of political wisdom,\n\nany and all strategies for voting,\n\nany philosophies of leadership (whose names, brands, and public relation campaigns merely disguise prescriptions of followership),\n\nany more damned electoral divination—particularly that variety of divination as performed by jingo-journalists and soothsaying commentators and self-appointed experts in the name of their holy culture war (when cheap and simple Rorschach tests made of used sheets of toilet paper fished out of the pipelines of Shawshank Prison would better serve society).\n\nOak Boat: Truly you have said a mouthful.\n\nNewt Monk: And though the words of that oath may bind me to their meaning, I also find freedom—a fresh kind of freedom—in recognizing, as one of the consequences of having taken the above oath, that philosophy, particularly political philosophy, can never coerce, but only point in some direction. It cannot unwillingly drag you down the rabbit hole (or Hobbit hole, or badger burrow, or through snake-filled tombs of prairie dog towns). As Iain McGilchrist has explained in The Matter with Things: Our Brains, Our Delusions, and the Unmaking of the World (2021):\n\nWith the best will in the world, on both sides, I can’t make you see what I experience as the truth. I can never convince you of a point of view unless you already, at some level, get it. As Friedrich Waismann [a writer whom both I Newt Monk and you, Oak Boat, know not a jot] put it,\n\nWe cannot constrain anyone who is unwilling to follow the new direction of a question; we can only extend the field of vision of the asker, loosen his prejudices, guide his gaze in a new direction: but all this can be achieved only with his consent. [How I See Philosophy, (Macmillan, 1968), p. 20).] [4]\n\nOak Boat:Yes, you have to content yourself with not being able to see the “whatever-it-is,” as McGilchrist calls it, that someone else sees, even if they think they saw it in something so quaint as an old book:\n\nIf I can’t see the moon, that doesn’t mean it stops being there for others. If we are all tuned in to the same whatever-it-is—and I believe it makes no sense to assert we are not—something very like what I can’t see is probably being seen by others, and ultimately that will affect me. It is perfectly possible to be deceived about, or to be in denial about, an aspect of whatever-it-is. [5]\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] J. R. R.

S. Lewis (1898–1963) and J. R. R. Tolkien (1892–1973) were themselves, respectfully, a Northern Irish Anglican and a Catholic from South Africa. Not a Baptist to be had (or dunked).\n\nBut Barfield (I think) gets it right when he says in his book Romanticism Comes of Age (Middleton, CN: Wesleyan UP, 1967) that the imagination “seeks to sink itself entirely in the thing perceived.” (p. 63). One sinks into the waters to be baptized (when a Baptist); one sinks into the waters of the imagination to begin deep thinking (when a human).\n\nOr let the metaphor be slightly altered: the human conscious sinks into the waters of the imagination, or is enveloped upon engaging in an imaginative (but certainly not imagined!) mode of thinking things through. Let the metaphor be slightly altered by the Venetian wordsmith Karl Kraus (1874–1936), as when he declares: “Imagination has the right to feast in the shade of the tree that it turns into a forest.” (Half–truths & one–and–a–half truths: selected aphorisms, ed. and trans. Harry Zohn, (Chicago UP; Engendra Press, Montreal. Reprint, 1976), p. 48.)\n\nAlas, maybe the metaphor of the baptistry is too idealistic and, like cotton candy, though there appears to be something of substance, upon closer inspection, it turns out that there’s mostly just air there. Maybe it’s not so pleasant to sink into the imagination. Maybe sinking into reality is a better course of action, as it was for the hero of the novel Cien años de soledad (1967) señor José Arcadio Buendía when his creator Gabriel García Márquez (1927–2014) writes:\n\nFascinated by an immediate reality that came to be more fantastic than the vast universe of his imagination, he [José Arcadio Buendía] lost all interest in the alchemist’s laboratory, put to rest the material that had become attenuated with months of manipulation, and went back to being the enterprising man of earlier days when he had decided upon the layout of the streets and the location of the new houses so that no one would enjoy privileges that everyone did not have.\n\n(A Hundred Years of Solitude), trans. Gregory Rabassa, (New York: Harper & Row, 1967), p. 39.)\n\nHannah Arendt (1906–1975), amid recalling Taoist texts, once contemplated the notion of one becoming trapped in a neither-world (neither in reality nor in imagination):\n\nThis suspicion that life is but a dream is, of course, among the most characteristic traits of Asian philosophy; examples from Indian philosophy are numerous. I shall give a Chinese example which his very telling because of its briefness. It reports a story told about the Taoist (i.e., anti-Confucian) philosopher Chuang Tzu. He “once dreamt he was a butterfly flitting and fluttering around, happy with himself and doing as he pleased. He didn’t know he was Chuang Chou. Suddenly he woke up and there he was, solid and unmistakable Chuang Chou. But he didn’t know if he was Chuang Chou who had dreamt he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming it was Chuang Chou. Between Chuang Chou and a butterfly there must be some distinction!”\n\nThe Life of the Mind, (1971), ed. Mary McCarthy (New York: Harcourt Brace & Co, 1978), Volume I. Thinking, p. 198.)\n\nBut perhaps my Baptist background has made me incurably idealistic with regard to the imagination. Perhaps it cannot calm brutes and their brute thoughts. In the novel Grendel (New York: Knopf, 1971), the troll-protagonist penned by John Gardner (1933–1982) realizes:\n\nImagination, I knew. Some evil inside myself pushed out into the trees. I knew what I knew, the mindless, mechanical bruteness of things, and when the harper’s lure drew my mind away to hopeful dreams, the dark of what was and always was reached out and snatched my feet. (pp. 16–17)\n\nAnd this same sentiment of a suspicion of the imagination plays out, much more gracefully and without as much brutishness, in the “tragedy of manners” novel The Remains of the Day (New York: Faber and Faber, 1989) by Kazuo Ishiguro. In that text, the butler Stephens has and hopes for grand plans to finally reunite and re-attract the attentions of Miss Kenton. But by being so swamped in his own imagination, he is unable to “see the writing on the wall” regarding their relationship.\n\nBut oh! is Stephens so refreshed, so sentimental, so “baptizing” upon his readers. Let us end this discussion with some examples of his imagination at play (sometimes occurring for Stephens while he is engaged in the act of reading):\n\nMy receiving the letter from Miss Kenton, containing as it did, along with its long, revealing passages, an unmistakable nostalgia for Darlington Hall, and—I am obliged me to see my staff plan afresh…. (p. 9)\n\nI have, I should make clear, reread Miss Kenton’s recent letter several times, and there is no possibility I am merely imagining the presence of these hints on her part…. (p. 10)\n\nThey were written during the thirties, but much of it would still be up to date—after all, I do not imagine German bombs have altered our countryside so significantly…. (p. 11)\n\nI imagine the experience of unease mixed with exhilaration often described in connection with this moment is very similar to what I felt in the Ford as the surroundings grew strange around me…. (p. 24)\n\nWhat is pertinent is the calmness of that beauty, its sense of restraint…. (pp. 28–29)\n\nBut by and large, I believe these generalizations to be accurate, and indeed, such ‘idealistic’ motivations as I have described have played a large part in my own career. (p. 116)\n\nToward an Unbound Civic Imagination\n\nSo, first I said I thought Americans need to think about imagination more, and think about it seriously, as a tool (but certainly not the tool) for addressing the most pressing problems in contemporary society: traffic congestion, housing shortages, healthcare costs, and mass-shootings––perhaps even the malaise of a lot of contemporary American (particularly Texan) art and literature.\n\nThen I said maybe citizens should be careful, because imagination has its costs, and some of those costs Americans may not want to pay for. In other words, “imagination won’t save us; but don’t then let it slay us.”\n\nStill, it feels wrong to remain inert. My mind remains restless, as if I’ve woken up gasping not for air but for fresher thoughts.\n\nSo I continue my studies of imagination, and there I find that poet-polemicist-philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834) more than once referred to the imagination as a “restless faculty” of the mind, endowed by “Nature,” and made for “noble” ends (or goals).\n\nLet therefore my “lofty ambition,” my “high hopes” be thus: that we may learn to cultivate (bildung) an “enthusiastic imagination,” one “vivid” and containing civic “reveries” not without spiritual “passion.” Though in this advocacy, I feel as if I’m Dr. Frankenstein wanting to create a new and improved civic American (or Texan):\n\nClerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a being formed in the “very poetry of nature.” His wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the world-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination.\n\n(Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, Frankenstein: or, the Modern Prometheus (1818), “Ch. XVIII.”)\n\nThe doctor further confesses:\n\nMy imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea of their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once was, you would not recognize me in this state of degradation. (“Ch. XXIV”)\n\nTwenty-nine years after Shelley’s Frankenstein (1818), Charlotte Brontë (1816–1855), in her novel Jayne Eyre (1847) mentions “the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination,” (Ch. XXI).\n\nSeventy-seven years after Eyre––but very early in the text of the Manifeste du surréalisme (Manifesto of Surrealism) (1924)––André Breton (1896–1966) describes “this imagination which knows no bounds is henceforth allowed to be exercised only in strict accordance with the laws of an arbitrary utility.”\n\nBreton’s elder, J. R. R. Tolkien (1892–1973), later observed in his essay “A Secret Vice” how:\n\nLanguage has both strengthened imagination and been freed by it. Who shall say whether the free adjective has created images bizarre and beautiful, or the adjective been freed by strange and beautiful pictures in the mind?\n\nAfter Tolkien, in one his early studies called The Death of Tragedy (1963), Franco-American critic George Steiner (1929–2020) noted of the English poet Robert Graves (1895–1985):“Graves says, the imagination has extra-territorial rights, and these are guarded by poetry.”\n\nEven so, poetry is not policy.\n\nAs Owen Barfield (1898–1997) once put it, “if law is the point where life and logic meet, perception is the point where life and imagination meet.” So even political and societal perceptions (and the political and societal problems we perceive) inevitably contain a substantial component called imagination.\n\nMoreover, as British philosopher Gertrude Anscombe (1919–2001) reminds us that “what is institutional must exclude all that is personal, casual or sporadic.” I think she means that imagination and institution rarely go hand-in-hand. (One might dare argue that anything “institutional” can never be “imaginative.”)\n\nWhen faced with a dilemma between the institutional and the imaginative, Tolkien, as a young student, chose the latter path:\n\nI was eager to study Nature, actually more eager than I was to read most fairy-stories; but I did not want to be quibbled into Science and cheated out of Faerie by people who seemed to assume that by some kind of original sin I should prefer fairy-tales, but according to some kind of new religion I ought to be induced to like science. (“On Fairy Stories”)\n\nIn a similar vein, Bertrand Russell (1872–1970), someone of a quite different British disposition that that of Tolkien, nonetheless once pointed out that philosophy too has a greater need for imaginative thinking than brute science requires:\n\n[In Voltaire’s novel Candide] Dr. Pangloss’s in his study can ascertain what soil of universe would, to his way of thinking, be the best possible; he can also convince himself, so long as he stays in his study, that the universe means to satisfy his ethical demands [that “we live in the best of all possible worlds”].\n\nBernard Bosanquet, until his death one of the recognized leaders of British philosophy, maintained in his Logic, ostensibly on logical grounds, that “it would be hard to believe, for example, in the likelihood of a catastrophe which should overwhelm a progressive civilization like that of modem Europe and its colonies.”\n\nCapacity to believe that the “laws of thought” have comforting political consequences is, a mark of the philosophic bias.\n\nPhilosophy, as opposed to science, springs from a kind of self-assertion: a belief that our purposes have an important relation to the purposes of the universe, and that, in the long run, the course of events is bound to be, on the whole, such as we should wish.\n\nScience abandoned this kind of optimism, but is being led towards another: that we, by our intelligence, can make the world such as to satisfy a large proportion of our desires.\n\nThis is a practical, as opposed to a metaphysical, optimism. I hope it will not seem to future generations as foolish as that of Dr. Pangloss.\n\nSo how do we sort the philosophy from the fairy story, the institutional science from an unbound civic imagination? Is democracy the best of all possible governance? We might ought to follow the method given by the narrator of Stephen King’s novel Revival (2014):\n\nWe debated the validity of each (first in my living room, later in this same bed), eventually putting them into four categories: utter bullshit, probable bullshit, impossible to be sure, and hard not to believe.

Such compounds were numerous in Old English, and many survived (or were re-coined) in Middle English, but few have a history extending beyond the 15th century; e.g. Old English árodscipe briskness, dolscipe folly, druncenscipe drunkenship n., drunkship n. (Middle English), glædscipe gladship n., gódscipe goodship n., láþscipe hardship, prútscipe pride, shendship n. (Middle English), snelscipe boldness, wildship n. (Middle English), wódscipe madness. The only survivals of this formation now in common use are hardship n. (first in Ancren Riwle), and worship n. (Old English weorþscipe).\n\nBut fellowship as an entire word, according to OED, doesn’t show up till the 1200s, that is, about a century before Chaucer.\n\nIn his book The Idea of the Holy (1917), German philosopher and theologian Rudolf Otto (1869–1937) lists fellowship as one of three types of spiritual silence:\n\nDevotional Silence may have a threefold character. There is the numinous silence of Sacrament, the silence of Waiting, and the silence of Union or Fellowship.\n\n(Das Heilige. Über das Irrationale in der Idee des Göttlichen und sein Verhältnis zum Rationalen (The Idea of the Holy: An Inquiry into the Non-Rational Factor in the idea of the Divine and its Relation to the Rational) (1917), trans. John W. Harvey, (Oxford UP, 1923), p. 216)\n\nOtto here admits that he found these ideas in the works of George Fox (1621–1691), founder of the Quakers, who formally call themselves The Society of Friends—that is, literally an organization devoted to fellowship. And the silence in fellowship that Otto mentions is what Mrs. Mia Wallace was trying to explain to Vincent Vega oh-so-many years ago:\n\nIn the Prologue to Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings (1954), one finds a casual, cozy fellowship:\n\n‘How Old Toby came by the plant is not recorded, for to his dying day he would not tell. He knew much about herbs, but he was no traveller. It is said that in his youth he went often to Bree, though he certainly never went further from the Shire than that. It is thus quite possible that he learned of this plant in Bree, where now, at any rate, it grows well on the south slopes of the hill. The Bree-hobbits claim to have been the first actual smokers of the pipe-weed. They claim, of course, to have done everything before the people of the Shire, whom they refer to as “colonists”; but in this case their claim is, I think, likely to be true. And certainly it was from Bree that the art of smoking the genuine weed spread in the recent centuries among Dwarves and such other folk, Rangers, Wizards, or wanderers, as still passed to and fro through tat ancient road-meeting. The home and centre of the art is thus to be found in the old inn of Bree, The Prancing Pony, that has been kept by the family of Butterbur from time beyond record.’\n\nThough the word fellowship isn’t used in this particular passage, the idea of it bleeds over from writer to reader, for fellowship is a prominent theme in Tolkien’s very big book.\n\nAnd I find a deeper, more formal fellowship than that above in both the Nine adventurers who constitute the Fellowship of the Ring, as well as between reader and writer, such as when Gandalf (but let us imagine author-professor Tolkien speaking in his stead), explains the fellowship-like task of the writer, (in this case, a historian):\n\nAnd Gandalf said: ‘This is your realm, and the heart of the greater realm that shall be. The Third Age of the world is ended, and the new age is begun; and it is your task to order its beginning and to preserve what may be preserved. For though much has been saved, much must now pass away; and the power of the Three Rings also is ended.’\n\n(“The Steward and the King,” The Return of the King, VI, v)\n\nGandalf-Tolkien goes on to explain that the task of the reader, with regard to fellowship with the writer, is to be a sapling (for the writer is a planter):\n\nAnd Gandalf coming looked at it, and said: ‘Verily this is a sapling of the line of Nimloth the fair; and that was a seedling of Galathilion, and that a fruit of Telpherion of many names, Eldest of Trees. Who shall say how it comes here in the appointed hour? But this is an ancient hallow, and ere the kings failed or the Tree withered in the court, a fruit must have been set here. For it is said that, though the fruit of the Tree comes seldom to ripeness, yet the life within may then lie sleeping through many long years, and none can foretell the time in which it will awake. Remember this. For if ever a fruit ripens, it should be planted, lest the line die out of the world. Here it has lain hidden on the mountain, even as the race of Elendil lay hidden in the wastes of the North. Yet the line of Nimloth is older far than your line, King Elessar.’\n\n(“The Steward and the King,” The Return of the King, VI, v)\n\nNor is fellowship limited to the realm of readers and writers. Fellowship can extend to religion, as Walter Kaufman (1921–1980) once pointed out, for fellowship is meant to counter loneliness:\n\nReligions do not so much offer truths as a common language in which to express truths as well as superstitions. Whitehead once said that “religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness.” This definition tells us more about the age in which it was written than about religion. Religion offers man a way out of his solitude. Even when it does not lure man into church or visible fellowship with others, religion offers man a language which makes real loneliness impossible. The language of religion may be ritual, prayer, or an idiom based on Scripture: the man who speaks this language breaks out of the solitary confinement of his mute emotions, transcends the isolation of his boredom or despair, and becomes part of a community. He belongs.\n\n(Critique of Religion and Philosophy, (Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP, 1958), p. 350)\n\nAnd fellowship may even extend to nationhood:\n\nJustice Felix Frankfurter spoke of the need “to shed old loyalties and take on the loyalty of American citizenship,” which is a kind of “fellowship which binds people together by devotion to certain feelings and ideas and ideals summarized as a requirement that they be attached to the principles of the constitution.”\n\n(Benjamin R. Barber, “Constitutional Faith,” For Love of Country? ed. Martha Nussbaum, (Boston: Beacon Press, 1996; ed. Joshua Cohen, 2002), p. 32)\n\nMy Best Read for 2021: Short Story Review of “The Feast” by Mark Marchenko (2020)\n\nMy Best Read for 2021: Short Story Review of â€œThe Feastâ€ by Mark Marchenko (2020)\n\nAfter spending a month brooding on what Iâ€™ve read over the past year, Iâ€™ve determined that Mark Marchenkoâ€™s â€œThe Feastâ€ (Zeenith, (Wyandotte, MI: New Pop Lit, 2020) was the best short story I read for 2021.\n\nIt is a straightforward narrative of entanglement with bureaucracy (and those armed bureaucrats we call â€œcopsâ€), genuinely Kafkaesque in the best sense of the word (as the LA Review of Books recently pointed out)â€”a nightmare of inane questioning, hindering, holding (as in being held in custody):\n\nâ€œYes, I understand,â€ I assured him, but at the same time, to say the truth, I felt a bit lost. It is like when you explain something so simple that is not even worth explaining, and if you are not understood, you start doubting if the problem is not in reality on your side. (â€œThe Feastâ€)\n\nIn other words, this is a place where all logical arguments fail to change the circumstances. The story also contains a bit of radically juxtaposed imagery, in a very dreamlike, authentically surreal manner.\n\nAnd though it is a â€œfictionalâ€ Moscow where Marchenkoâ€™s story takes place, the endless netting and knotting of empty explanations from security officials, accompanied by a preference for nonsensical commands that must be obeyed, reminds one of Baylor professor Alan Jacobâ€™s recent encounters with American healthcare bureaucracyâ€”a nauseous trek and trial that led him to later compare his experiences to Dickenâ€™s circumlocution machine. For Jacobs, â€œthe object of these systems is the generation of despair.â€\n\nYet I was also reminded of the dread from Yiddish writer (originally from Ukraine) Sholom Aleichemâ€™s (1859â€“1916) short story of â€œThe Pairâ€â€“â€“a story where a couple are doomed to be cannibalized, and yet, while in their holding cell (or coup), one explains to the other how\n\nThere is nothing in the world to which Godâ€™s creatures canâ€™t become accustomed. Our prisoners had grown so used to their troubles that they now thought things were as they should be, just like the proverbial worm that has made its home in horseradish and thinks it sweet. (â€œThe Pair,â€ trans. Shlomo Katz, A Treasury of Yiddish Stories, eds. Irving Howe and Eliezer Greenberg, (New York: Viking, 1954) p. 202)\n\nMarchenkoâ€™s â€œThe Feast,â€ however, also resembled that moment in â€œThe Bridge of Khazad-DÃ»mâ€ chapter to The Lord of the Rings, where Gandalf reads from the Book of Mazarbul the words of the doomed dwarves: â€œwe cannot get out.â€ But while the circumstances are crystal clear for the characters in Tolkien, in Marchenkoâ€™s tale, the main character is trapped in convolutions of organizational documentation, entangled in endless obscurities:\n\nThe document consisted of two parts: the main text and the area below where you put your signature. The annotation said that the person who signed it was aware of the information in the text and that this person was not going to file any complaints should he decide that he in fact wasnâ€™t acknowledged with the text. (â€œThe Feastâ€)\n\nStill, let us hope for Marchenkoâ€™s protagonist, as well as for Jacobs and ourselves, that we never get too used to these obstacles of institutionalization. Let us hope that we too, like the hardy band in Tolkien, are able to â€œget out.â€\n\nArcadia and Middle-Earth: Prose Plus Poetry in Sidney and Tolkien\n\nAfter finishing C. S. Lewisâ€™s (1898â€“1963) English Literature in the Sixteenth Century (Excluding Drama) (1954) last autumn, I was curious to then read Sir. Philip Sidneyâ€™s Arcadia (1580): a strange work of mostly prose, but interspersed with much poetry. Iâ€™d read Sidneyâ€™s Apology (1580) several times and mostly understood it, but the Arcadia was more ambiguous. When reading it, sometimes (at least the older version) felt like a medieval romance (like the first part of the Roman de la Rose [c. 1230]). At other times, the Arcadia felt like an ancient epic (the Argonautica (c. 200 BC) comes to mind). Either way, Arcadia is definitely not a novel, though it is a fantasy.\n\nAnd it also reminded me much of J. R. R. Tolkienâ€™s (1892â€“1973) worksâ€”another fantasy world told mostly in prose but containing much poetry. Both authors take these old literary forms and add something fresh to them by mixing them together. They are â€œfun,â€ even when their tones turn toward things serious. In this regard, they have mirth.\n\nThis freshness of song and speech also reminded somewhat of Miguel Cervantes (1547â€“1616) Don Quijote (1605, 1616), which contains a few handfuls of sonnets, and along these lines we might add Johanna Spyriâ€™s (1827â€“1901) Heidiâ€™s Lehr- und Wanderjahre (Heidiâ€™s Years of Wandering and Learning) (1880) and Heidi Kann Brauchen, was es Gelernt Hat (How Heidi Used What She Learned) (1881) as well as John Bunyanâ€™s (1628â€“1688) The Pilgrimâ€™s Progress (1678) with their Protestant hymns and songs intermixed with prose tales.\n\nBut the going-back-and-forthness between prose and poetry in Sidney’s Arcadia and Tolkien’s Middle-Earth mostly reminded me of classic Hollywood musicals. (Iâ€™m a South Pacific (1958) and My Fair Lady (1964) kind of guy.)\n\nPost Scriptum\n\nFinally, with feelings more of somberness than sadness do we wish Christopher Tolkien (1924â€“2020) and his kin the best as he now journeys westward toward the Grey Havens. His task as steward to his fatherâ€™s work is now complete. And I expect the father to soon say to all around him, â€œThis is my son, with whom I am well pleased.â€\n\nHow Much was a Plum Worth in the Middle Ages? Reading Richard Rolle\n\nHow Much was a Plum Worth in the Middle Ages? Reading Richard Rolle\n\nSo a while back I was reading The Continuity of English Prose from Alfred to More and his School (1932) by Raymond Wilson Chambers (1874â€“1942), a friend of Tolkienâ€™s, and came across this intriguing passage concerning someone Iâ€™d never hear of before, the medieval mystic Richard Rolle (1290/1300â€“1349):\n\nRolleâ€™s date, his style and his popularity give him a supreme place in the history of English prose. In English or in Latin he was, during the latter half of the Fourteenth Century and the whole of the Fifteenth, probably the most widely read in England of all English writers. Investigation of English wills and of documents bearing on the ownership of books seems to show a dozen owners of manuscripts of Rolle for one or two of the Canterbury Tales. Such devotional books were likely to be worn to bits, and not to come down to posterity at all: yet Miss Allen has examined between four and five hundred of them, in Latin or in English, scattered through the libraries of Europe and America. [1]\n\nAnd later I learned from an article by Margaret Deanesly (1885â€“1977):\n\nAmong English books, those of Richard Rolle seem to have been most frequentâ€”partly because his glossed English psalter was the only biblical book which the laity might use without license.[2]\n\nSo in light of the life-long quest to understand the Middle Ages I undertook several years ago, I recently decided to read some Richard Rolle. Hence I found Richard Rolle: Prose and Verse (1988) edited by S. J. Ogilvie-Thomson for the Early English Text Society.\n\nI must say I found very little â€œmysticismâ€ in Rolle. His religion seems pretty plain, ordinary, and orthodox, even when compared to a non-radical like Jonathan Edwards (1703â€“1758),[3] but maybe thatâ€™s what made Rolle so popular.\n\nNow itâ€™s been a while since I dove into Middle English, and it took some slow adjusting (is his surname pronounced like rÃ´le, or does it rhyme with Raleigh?), but I found a few gems by Rolle such as:\n\nÃ¾e fyre of his loue lyght oure hert, and Ã¾e swetnesse of his grace be our comfort and our solace in wel and in woo. [4]\n\n[the fire of His love light our hearts, and the sweetness of His grace be our comfort and our solace in well and in woe.]\n\nElsewhere Rolle writes that â€œloue is hard as helle.â€ [5]\n\nBut I was especially struck by his strange comparison of apples to castles:\n\nBot sum men Ã¾at loueth nat wisely, like to children Ã¾at loueth more an appille Ã¾an a castelle. So doth many; Ã¾ay gvf Ã¾e ioy of heuyn for a litel delite of har fleisshe, Ã¾at is noght worth a ploumbe. [6]\n\n[But some men that loveth not wisely, like to children that loveth more an apple than a castle. So doth many; they give the joy of heaven for a little delight of her flesh, that is not worth a plum.]\n\nJust how old is the metaphor and phrase â€œnot worth a plum?â€ According to the Oxford English Dictionary, both â€œplumâ€ and â€œworthâ€ are very old words, even within Old English. Google Bookâ€™s Ngram viewer finds the phrase extremely rare before 1800, [7] peaking at about 1837 and slowly decreasing since then.\n\nAnd are (or were) plumbs worth less than apples? Were they worth less because they bruise more easily?\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] Chambers, R. W. The Continuity of English Prose from Alfred to More and his School.

There is something of a riddle in how adventure sometimes functions as a synonym for criminal enterprise. An Oxford don named Tolkien played around with this idea in the opening chapter of The Hobbit (1936). But I first learned of this riddle from that Gallic journalist AndrÃ© Gide (1869â€“1951) and his character of Lafcadio in The Caves of the Vatican (1914): a motiveless criminal:\n\nâ€œNo doubt his apparent inconsequence hides what is in reality, a subtler and more recondite sequenceâ€”the important point is that what makes him act should not be a matter of interest, or, as the usual phrase is, that he should not be merely actuated by interested motivesâ€¦. A crime without a motive,â€ went on Lafcadio, â€œwhat a puzzle for the police! As to that, however, going along beside this blessed bank, anybody in the next-door compartment might notice the door open and the old blighterâ€™s shadow pitch out. The corridor curtains, at any rate, are drawnâ€¦. Itâ€™s not so much about events that Iâ€™m curious, as about myself. Thereâ€™s many a man thinks heâ€™s capable of anything, who draws back when it comes to the pointâ€¦. What a gulf between the imagination and the deed! â€¦ And no more right to take back oneâ€™s move than at chess. Pooh! If one could foresee all the risks, thereâ€™d be no interest in the game! â€¦. Between the imagination of a deed and â€¦ Hullo! the bankâ€™s come to an endâ€¦.â€ Â He preferred adventureâ€”a word as pliable as his beaver and as easily twisted to suit his likingâ€¦. There is no reason that a man who commits a crime without reason should be considered a criminal.[3]\n\nCRIME WRITER: You certainly can quote when called upon. But donâ€™t expect me today to pay you for yesterdayâ€™s words.\n\nPLAGIARIST: Thereâ€™re plenty who do pay. I donâ€™t need you. And I can perplex at will. I will perplex you with a question: can one be a law-abiderâ€“â€“a non-criminal, full of motives or empty of inclinationsâ€“â€“and still, nonetheless, possess â€œthe philanthropic desire of giving the criminals something to do?â€ Or is that urge something that happens only amid the anarchy in the heart of the African jungle of Nod, rather than the governance of the Arabic garden of Eden?[4]\n\nCRIME WRITER: With all my experience of writing about high adventures and misdemeanors, I well remember what Captain Conrad taught me:\n\nCuriosity being one of the forms of self-revelation, a systematically incurious person remains always partly mysterious.[5]\n\nwhich was whyâ€“â€“\n\nAfter two years of training he went to sea, and entering the regions so well known to [Jimâ€™s] imagination, found them strangely barren of adventure. He made many voyages.[6]\n\nSo to seek adventureâ€”to pursue crimeâ€”is rather boring, at least for crime writers like me. Yet the incurious teem with intrigueâ€¦.\n\nII.\n\nCRIME WRITER: Gide, Conrad, and Gramsci. Besides being a bunch of men, how are these relevant to our dialogue?\n\nPLAGIARIST: the political prisoner Antonio Gramsci (1891â€“1937), whether or not technically a â€œcriminal,â€ certainly possessed motives and rendered them upon the pages of his notebooks. He was motived to philosophize in order to rise above religion and common sense:\n\nPhilosophy is intellectual order, which neither religion nor common sense can be. It is to be observed that religion and common sense do not coincide either, but that religion is an element of fragmented common sense. Moreover common sense is a collective noun, like religion: there is not just one common sense, for that too is a product of history and a part of the historical process. Philosophy is criticism and superseding of religion and â€œcommonâ€ sense. [7]\n\nOn the other hand, for sea captain Joseph Conrad (1857â€“1924) if a societyâ€™s objects of royalty and religion make not good targets for terrorists (who are criminals, members of anti-society), thenâ€“ at least in his novel The Secret Agent (1907)â€“â€“science emerges as the preferred target for terrorists, the new motive of criminality:\n\nâ€œYou are too lazy to think,â€ was Mr Vladimirâ€™s comment upon that gesture. â€œPay attention to what I say. The fetish of to-day is neither royalty nor religion. Therefore the palace and the church should be left alone. You understand what I mean, Mr Verloc?â€ â€¦. But there is learningâ€”science. Any imbecile that has got an income believes in that. He does not know why, but he believes it matters somehow. It is the sacrosanct fetishâ€¦.[8]\n\nFinally, through his character of James Duffy, exiled penman James Joyce (1882â€“1941) shows that to be aÂ good citizen of a murderous empire, a non-criminal needs merely no royalty (if Irish at least), a few friends, and a little religion. These things make the life of the good citizen â€œadventurelessâ€:\n\nHe had neither companions nor friends, church nor creed. He lived his spiritual life without any communion with others, visiting his relatives at Christmas and escorting them to the cemetery when they died. He performed these two social duties for old dignity’s sake but conceded nothing further to the conventions which regulate the civic life. He allowed himself to think that in certain circumstances he would rob his hank but, as these circumstances never arose, his life rolled out evenlyâ€”an adventureless tale.[9]\n\nCRIME WRITER: Crime and adventureâ€¦.\n\nPLAGIARIST: Advice and censureâ€¦.\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] Milton, John.
