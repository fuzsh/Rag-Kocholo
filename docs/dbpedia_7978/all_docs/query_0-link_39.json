        "text": "J.R.R. Tolkien in known for using characteristically rich images in his works. They have the potential to stimulate the brain, which conceptualises and interprets these images. The readers have to use not only their imagination, but also experience and possessed knowledge in order to portray them in mind, even if the use of this knowledge is subconscious. In the short story “Leaf by Niggle” Tolkien presents the descriptions of various levels of conceptualising one picture, three of which will be central to this study: mind, painting and objective reality. The aim of the analysis of several passages chosen from Tolkien’s story is to give evidence that, although they are substantially different from each other, they are presented in a similar way to the extent of merging. The effect of this is the fact that one major concept, the Tree, is constructed and fully understood in terms of the three aforementioned spaces. The framework within which the analysis will be conducted is predominantly the theory of conceptual blending by Fauconnier and Turner (1998) supplemented by selected notions of Langacker’s Cognitive Grammar (2008), and Lakoff and Johnson’s conceptual metaphor (1980). Chapter one introduces the context for the analysis. It includes short information about Tolkien’s life, his works and style of writing. “Leaf by Niggle” is an unusual instance among his works, due to allegorical character of the text. The summary of the story is an important part, as it provides the context for understanding the selected passages. The last point of the chapter introduces Tolkien’s notion of sub-creation, which is a dominant theme in the story and will have a considerable significance in a more detailed understanding of chosen blends. Chapter two provides the framework for the analysis. Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT) is mentioned as first, because it organises the metaphors in a coherent system and is the basis for analysing figurative language. The subsequent section introduces the conceptual blending theory by Fauconnier and Turner and its evolution from the theory of mental spaces (Fauconnier 1985). It is concluded the comparison of CMT and conceptual integration theory. The notion of frames by Fillmore is also included in this chapter as one of the early attempts at organising the concepts in a systematic way within the cognitive framework. One of the subsections presents several aspects of Cognitive Grammar selected from Langacker’s theory, since some of them constitute very useful tools for analysing more complex passages of Tolkien’s story. The last chapter contains the analysis of the fragments chosen from the text. The main tool used for this purpose is conceptual blending theory, described earlier in Chapter two. The theory of Fauconnier and Turner is a multifunctional device, which allows to concentrate on various aspects at the same time. It is alternative to Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT) by Lakoff and Johnson, and for this reason this approach is not included in this work. Conceptual integration brings the researchers closer to a more advanced analysis of the way people think. This aspect is very important due to the fact that human thought is the main theme of the passages chosen for this study. The reader of “Leaf by Niggle” is guided through Niggle’s thoughts, point of view, and the world where his visions come into being. These three pictures are different but, when it comes to the linguistic presentation, each of them has several features of the others. The effect of the intermingling is that one picture is constantly conceptualised using the characteristics of all three spaces. The work ends with conclusions recapitulating the analysis and assessing the value of the short story paying special attention to linguistic features."
