She corresponded with Lewis, and Tolkien enjoyed her early Whimsey books, though not Gaudy Night as I recall, but none of them ever met in real life. She does share many of the intellectual and spiritual ideas of the Inklings however.\n\nTo add to the list, Hugo Dyson, Neville Coghill, Bede Griffiths, were among those who attended at times. The best places to find reference to those who did attend would first _The Inklings_ by Humphrey Carpenter and _Brothers and Friends_ which are the edited journals of W. H. Lewis, the secretary of the Inklings when he was in England. He often mentions and lists the names of those in attendance in his journals.\n\nGiles\n\ninked\n\nPosting Freak\n\nPosts: 1,141\n\nThreads: 7\n\nJoined: Mar 2004\n\nGood Sir,\n\nPerhaps I read too much into the following found on the initial page of the PREFACE to ESSAYS PRESENTED TO CHARLES WILLIAMS:\n\n\"If the authors of this book were to put forward any claim, it would be, and that shyly, that they were for the last few years of his life a fairly permanent nucleus among his literary friends. He read us his manuscripts and we read him ours: we smoked, talked, argued, and drank together (I must confess that with Miss Dorothy Sayers I have seen him drink only tea: but that was neither his fault nor hers).\"\n\nIt would seem that at least these three (CSL, DLS, CW) had met and imbibed at least tea together. This may not have been an Inklings meeting in Lewis' rooms. ... But, I have nagging in the deeper neurons a half recollected account of one such meeting at which I believe she was present. As I have returned home I shall attempt to dredge up the supporting data if any.\n\nYour thoughts?\n\nPostscript: On checking my references I find no less an authority than WH Lewis (Major, ret.) asserting in a diary entry Thursday 5th January 1967 in response to a book re: the Inklings by Moorman (The Precincts of Felicity) that \"when in the last chapter he brings in T.S. Eliot and Dorothy Sayers, neither of whom ever attended an Inklings in their lives\"\n\nthat ... (mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa) my memory was\n\nWRONG. It was undoubtedly a very old neuron which had switched polarity under the intervening years overindulgences or protein over-accumulation... . Of your courtesies, sirs, I humbly beg pardon. And if I offended any ladies in this error, I most humbly crave your pardons as well. I shall endeavor to do better in any future posts.\n\ninked\n\n\"Aslan is not a tame lion.

That old neuron mentioned in the earlier post undoubtedly sent an axon to the Bird and Baby neuron and another to the DLS neuron. The axon then fired from each linked neuron and voila\n\nmy egress error!

Many included Sayers among the Inklings, though as Warne points out she never attended a meeting, at least so far as he knew.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, DLS and CW were acquainted. DLS had published by the end of the war with Oxford Univ. Press, where CW worked, and of course DLS was indebted and very much respected CW's work on Dante's Beatrice as DLS was preparing her own Dante Papers. It is that acquaintanceship, methinks, that people often take as indicating that DLS was an Inkling.\n\nAs for the reference in the the front of the book of essays you mention, I'm aware of the book and read it some years ago, but don't recall that note. Not that its not there, but I don't recall it. But I trust you, so I'll apologize for stating that CSL had never met DLS in person.\n\nCheers,\n\nGiles\n\nAttalus\n\nPosting Freak\n\nPosts: 3,251\n\nThreads: 103\n\nJoined: Feb 2003\n\nQuote:I could not stand Gaudy Night.

One thing about Peter Wimsey fans: they either love \"the Vane,\" as I do, or loathe her, as JRRT did. Not surprising that JRRT included DLS in his dislike, as she modeled her after herself. She decided that if anyone was going to marry Lord P., it would be her, hence all of the references to how H.D.V. is \"not pretty, but what you call striking.\" (Bunter, in Busman's Honeymoon) If you look at DLS's portraits, you'll see what she means.\n\n\"What song the Sirens sang, or what name Achilles assumed when he hid himself among women, though puzzling questions are not beyond conjecture.\" - Sir Thomas Browne, Religio Medici\n\nGiles\n\nGuest\n\nQuote:Originally posted by inked\n\nAttalus,\n\nI believe that the point of the Essays was that all contributors were friends of Charles Williams, not necessarily of each other.

I don't recall that JRRT had anything personal against CW, just didn't care for his creative output. And one can see why, CW's subject matter and choice of genre is everything JRRTs isn't. CW had a significant influence as we all know on Lewis, which didn't help.\n\nGiles\n\ninked\n\nPosting Freak\n\nPosts: 1,141\n\nThreads: 7\n\nJoined: Mar 2004\n\nGiles,\n\nPoint taken. JRRT did contribute the essay, so I did not intend to imply that he had antipathy for CW. But, certainly he and CW were not \"buds\". I am amazed at how the Inklings functioned and related so well when they were all so remarkably individuals and diversely interested. Personal feelings were hit or miss. Literature and criticism of each others works and ideas were the commonality, not likings per se.\n\ninked\n\n\"Aslan is not a tame lion. Safe?\n\nNo, he's not safe, but he's good.\"\n\nCSL/LWW"
