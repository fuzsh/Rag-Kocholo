        "text": "Originally ran September 2002, Pitchforkmedia.com\n\nI saw a lot of girls at my bachelor party in Montréal, but the one I was\n\nsober enough to remember was Avril Lavigne. We were watching Canadian cable\n\nin our hotel room, polishing off a case of Molsons before we went out for\n\nlunch, and as we flipped through the music stations we stumbled across Avril\n\nLavigne's \"Complicated\". None of us knew who she was, and most of the guys\n\ndidn't care, but I made us stop and watch.\n\nAt first glance, Avril's just another cute teen-pop star. But rather than\n\ndancing in choreographed formation with gay New Yorkers, she whizzes around\n\non a skateboard; she's a female pop singer, but she plays with a rock band,\n\ncops a wholesome mid-80s punk look, and acts like a tomboy. She probably\n\nhangs with the outsiders at schoolthe kids who smoke weed, hate football\n\nand try to read Camus. No, her music isn't great, and no, she's not as punk\n\nas her record label claims. But she's spunky, sharp, and comes off as a real\n\nteen instead of a creepy blow-up doll. If I could go to school with these\n\ngirlsand don't think I don't dream about itBritney Spears is the girl I'd\n\nogle, but Lavigne's the one I'd knock myself out to impress.\n\nOne day I was skimming through her website (because, um, I'm a rock critic,\n\nand I have to keep up on this stuff) and I found a weird ad: \"Join the\n\nofficial Avril eTeam!\" Lavigne's handlers have hired a company called the\n\nHype Council to start a grassroots marketing effort: they're getting fans to\n\nsign up and spread the word about Avril, online. It's the same concept as a\n\nstreet team, where a label gets kids to blanket the city with posters and\n\nbumper stickers to promote a show or a record release. Street teams are a\n\ntime-honored way to get free labor out of dedicated fans. But eTeams are\n\nmore efficient, more powerfuland just as cheap.\n\nBut exactly how does it work? What's in it for us? A free t-shirt? Concert\n\ntix? Maybe, dare I dream, a chance to meet Avril? It had to be checked out.\n\nMY LIFE AS A TEENAGE GIRL\n\nI knew I couldn't go into this thing as a grizzled 28-year-old music snob.\n\nSo step one was to create a cover for myself: I became Kate Thompson, born\n\non July 4th, 1984, and currently living in Allston, Massachusetts (a.k.a.\n\n\"Rock City!!\"). All I know about being a girl is what I've learned from Judy\n\nBlume novels and the WB, but I figured I could bluff it well enough to get\n\nin the door. I set up a fake e-mail address in Kate's name and then sent in\n\nmy application for TeamAVRIL.\n\nWhile I waited to hear back, I also got a copy of her album, Let Go, and\n\nlistened to it a few times. Listening as a teenage girl and not as a critic,\n\nI've got to say, it's not badhalf heartfelt angst, half high-energy spaz\n\npop. The songs come off as honest, genuine teenage mood swings, from the\n\ncrashing guitars and angst-drenched cries of \"Losing Grip\" to whimsical and\n\nhyper-poppy tracks like her latest hit, \"Sk8er Boi\". Expect to see the\n\nlyrics from \"Anything but Ordinary\" scribbled all over yearbooks across\n\nAmerica's junior high schools: \"To walk within the lines would make my life\n\nso boring!!/ I want to know that I have been to the extreme... I'd rather be\n\nanything but ordinary.\" Lavigne's voice is pretty strong, too, as she\n\nstarted out singing country music, where weak pipes will get you nowhere.\n\n(But don't tell anyone about the country connectionif the kids find out,\n\nit'll be worse than if she had VD.)\n\nAnd now it's my job to help push her record as far up the charts as it'll\n\ngo.\n\nMICHELLE BRANCH, YOU WANNABE, YOU'RE GOING DOWN\n\nWithin days I gotthat is, Kate Thompson gotmarching orders from TeamAVRIL,\n\nin a four-page long e-mail from someone named \"Wag\".\n\nWag runs TeamAVRIL on behalf of the Hype Council, and at last count, she's\n\nin charge of over 60,000 rabid Avril fans. I couldn't find a biography or a\n\nprofile of her (if Wag is even a woman), but I would guess that she's an\n\nearly-to-mid-twentysomething with dotcom marketing experience who was once:\n\n1) a camp counselor; 2) on the prom committee; or 3) the plane crash\n\nsurvivor who ate everyone else.\n\nWag's there to keep the kids in line with a friendly but firm hand,\n\nencouraging us to finish our tasks and helping us through the frequent site\n\noutages and relaunches that plague the TeamAVRIL site. Every week, Wag sends\n\nus the latest news on Avril, and then gives us a list of ways to help her.\n\nFrom the first update, it didn't look like Lavigne needed much help: Let Go\n\nwent double platinum the last week of August and hit #3 on the Billboard 200\n\n(behind the Dixie Chicks and Eminem). The video for \"Sk8er Boi\" hit full\n\nrotation on MTV and made #1 on \"Total Request Live\", that critical gauge of\n\nteen pop fame. And best of all, as Wag wrote: \"Avril won the VMA [Video\n\nMusic Award] for Best New Artist!!! What an absolutely COOOOOOL night that\n\nwas!\"\n\nBut as Wag reminded us, \"the competition wants #1. Let's heat it up!!!\" And\n\nit's true: as big as Avril gets, a dozen other wannabes vie for her spotfor\n\nexample, porcelain doll Michelle Branch, who, like Avril, claims she writes\n\nher own songs and never uses a stylist. Branch won MTV's 2002 Viewer's\n\nChoice and her song \"Goodbye to You\" is climbing the charts. Wag didn't need\n\nto spell it out: we had to put that bitch down.\n\nSo how do you help Avril? TeamAVRIL focuses on three kinds of targets:\n\nonline polls, message boards, and \"Total Request Live\". The polls are the\n\neasiest. Many pop websites run some kind of survey where you vote for your\n\nfavorite new artist; Wag has listed them all, and told us to hit them early\n\nand often. The most critical is CosmoGIRL.com's, where we're voting for\n\nnothing less than the CosmoGIRL of the Year. If Avril wins, you'll see her\n\nraccoon-eyed, necktie-sporting Canadian visage on the cover of the November\n\nissue.\n\nI had to register on the CosmoGIRL site to vote, which means CosmoGIRL gets\n\nmy (fake) registration and demographics info. But at least they send me\n\nhelpful make-up and fashion tips. They've narrowed the poll options to Sarah\n\nMichelle Gellar, Gwen Stefani, Katie Holmes, Shirley Manson, and our girl\n\nAvril. Now, you may think CosmoGIRL would only give one vote to each\n\nregistered visitor. Instead, they encourage you to vote up to one hundred\n\ntimes a day. So naturally, that's how many times I voted. I thought about\n\ntossing a couple votes to Gellar because I dig \"Buffy\", but she's been\n\nphoning it in for the past couple of years. In the end, all my votes went to\n\nAvril.\n\nThe next task is to look for message boards and chat rooms and barrage them\n\nwith Avril propaganda. In case you're not familiar with these forums, the\n\nbasic idea is that anyone in the world can go to a website with a message\n\nboard or a chat room, and just start typing. For example, you may create a\n\nsubject titled, \"Avril RAWKS\", and post a few comments about why. Then a\n\ndozen other people will come in and post messages saying, \"Avril SUX\". Then\n\nyou write back telling them to blow themselves. This can go on for days.\n\nThere are many message boards that focus on music, and all of them, from the\n\npoppiest to the snobbiest, have at least a couple threads about Avril. Most\n\nof them are negative, taking her to task for not being \"real\" and not being\n\n\"punk\". Cocky teenagers with hit singles have to expect some amount of flak,\n\nbut Avril inspires profound hatred. On the \"Total Request Live\" boards,\n\npunkdrummergirl15 writes: \"I would love to wack her in the head with a\n\ntennis racket (the one she should be holding!) she is a freaking yuppie\n\nwannabe!!\" Or from RapSmirk: \"Avril Lavigne looks worse than an adult diaper\n\nwith semen in it.\"\n\nAs an upstanding member of the team, I just kept posting back, trying to\n\nturn the tide. \"She's not trying to be anything! She does what she wantsshe\n\ndoesn't sing songs about being a punk, she sings about being alone, or\n\ndepressed, about being lonely but not wanting to act just like everyone else\n\nin her class...\" I ended each post with, \"AVRIL RAWKS! Nobody's gonna talk\n\ntrash about my girl!\"\n\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT FORUM IN POPAND IT'S RUN BY IDIOTS\n\nAt the end of the week I sent in a detailed two-page status report. And then\n\nI waited, until this Monday, when I got another update and found out how we\n\nwere doing. Let Go still holds the #3 spot on the Billboard 200no movement\n\nthere, but at least it hasn't slipped. Nothing much else had changed. But\n\nthere was one way I could watch our progress: sit through \"Total Request\n\nLive\" and see if Avril's video stayed at #1.\n\nFrom what I can tell, \"Total Request Live\" is the most important forum in\n\nteen music. It's a daily show that broadcasts live right after school, from\n\n3:30 to 4:30. They rank and play the top ten videos of the day, ostensibly\n\nchosen by you the viewer, who can call in or vote online for your favorite\n\nmusic. In the days of street teams, labels encouraged the fans to call radio\n\nstations and request songs. But TeamAVRIL doesn't even bother mentioning the\n\nradio: it's too local, and no station can touch \"TRL\"'s influence. In\n\naddition, radio stations barely take requests, while \"TRL\" claims to work\n\nstrictly from your votes. Granted, you only get 60 videos to choose from,\n\nbut if you want to write in a vote for some weirdo indie band, there's a\n\nform for that, too.\n\nUsually, Carson Daly hosts \"TRL\", but today the second stringers were in\n\ncharge: up in the studio was Quddus, a bland guy who kept saying \"bro\" and\n\n\"man\" to remind us that he's black, and working the crowds on the street was\n\na featureless twig named Hilarie. These dopes made Daly look like Cronkite.\n\nI waded through eight crappy videos before it came down to Eminem and Avril\n\nfighting for the top spot. And Avril won! Eminem got the #2 spot with that\n\nwhiny song about how his moms didn't love him as a child. Listen, Em, you\n\ngoddamn bleached weasel, I've got problems, tooI don't need to hear about\n\nyours. \"Sk8er Boi\" topped the charts once again and we got to watch the\n\nvideo, where Avril flies around on a dirt bike, hangs with her band, and\n\nruns around with that silly necktie she's always wearing. I clapped and\n\ncheered. Maybe it was my 500 votes that put her over the top! Every little\n\nbit helps.\n\nIT'S ONLY CHILD LABOR IF YOU PAY THEM\n\nNow, this is all pretty exciting, until you look at the big picture.\n\nWhat do the members of TeamAVRIL get for all their hard work and trouble?\n\nNothing. That's right, nothing. Not even a t-shirt. At best, you're entered\n\nin a contest to win a t-shirt, or an autographed CD. The hardest working\n\nteam member, out of all 60,000, wins an autographed guitar. But the rest of\n\nus don't get shitnot a discount, not advance orders on tickets, nothing.\n\nThe site does promise 'exclusive content' that only TeamAVRIL members can\n\nsee. This might be cool for the dedicated fans that typically sign up for\n\nthis kind of stuff, but when I joined, nothing was up there but a clip from\n\nthe song \"My World\" (which is already on the album) and a personal message\n\nof thanks from Avril: \"Thank you for all of your e-mails and calls to 'TRL'\n\nand [Canadian music channel] 'MuchMusic' which helped me get to #1 on both,\n\nwhich in turn increased record sales...\" Wow, that came from the heart.\n\nThe only real perk is that as soon as you're accepted as a member of\n\nTeamAVRIL, you get access to their 'backstage area', where you can check\n\nyour TeamAVRIL e-mail (yourname@teamavril.comprestigious!), or access the\n\nmessage board. This message board seems to be the only one in the world\n\nwhere nobody makes fun of Avril, thereby making it some kind of refuge.\n\nI had a blast hanging around the board. You probably want me to quote some\n\nof the funny things I read, in some kind of \"16-year-old Avril Lavigne fans\n\nsay the darndest things!\" expose. But I won't, mainly because I wasn't any\n\nsmarter or cooler at their age. Besides, apart from some arguments over\n\nwhether Avril really plays guitar or whether she's really punk, it was a\n\npretty average board. It has male and female fans, from their pre-teens to\n\nearly twenties. Kids wrote in to complain about the first day of school, or\n\nmake plans to meet after Avril concerts; they talked about music and posted\n\nlinks to their home pages.\n\nAnd even though I could rant about how TeamAVRIL is scamming us, I'm willing\n\nto bet that most of the thousands of TeamAVRIL members just signed up to\n\nhang out and use the board. After all, if everyone followed orders, Avril\n\nwould have 60,000 votes on the RollingStone.com \"Who's Gonna Win the Pop\n\nPack Race?\" poll; instead, she got a mere 4,000, putting her far behind\n\nAnastacia and Dropline. Maybe TeamANASTACIA hands out free shirts.\n\nCONCLUSION: WHAT A SCAM\n\nA lot of energy gets wasted on this. It's free labor, with kids like me as\n\nthe suckers who click these stupid polls and chat up Avril. And it's even\n\nworse because the company's not just after your time: they want to use you\n\nas marketing data. Even the members who do nothing have handed the Hype\n\nCouncil their names, ages and addresses. It never hurts to have 60,000\n\npeople come to you with their personal information, so whether or not\n\nTeamAVRIL makes a difference, the Hype Council and the record company still\n\nwin.\n\nBut if the fans like Avril that much, more power to them: you can't really\n\nchoose the music you like. Heck, I'll admit even I've got a soft spot for\n\nAvril after doing so much work for her. Maybe it's true what they say about\n\nmissionaries: if nothing else, you end up converting yourself."
