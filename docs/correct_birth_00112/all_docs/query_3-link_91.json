        "text": "CUYAHOGA FALLS, Ohio - Singer-songwriter and alt-pop star Avril Lavigne is hitting the road this summer with her “Greatest Hits Tour” that will be stopping at Blossom Music Center on Friday, Sept. 6. Lavigne’s Canadian pop-punk peers Simple Plan and Girlfriends are the openers.\n\nTickets go on sale at 10 a.m. Wednesday, January 24, via a special artist presale. See avrillavigne.com for more information. Tickets go on sale to the general public at 10 a.m. Friday, Jan. 26, via ticketmaster.com.\n\nLavigne’s most recent recording and seventh studio album, the guest-filled “Love Sux,” was released in 2022 to generally positive reviews and peaked in the Top 10 of the Billboard 200 album charts. But for the summer of 2024, Lavigne is going back to give fans her early hits, including “Sk8ter Boi,” the triple-platinum “Complicated” and “Girlfriend.”\n\nSimple Plan, like Lavigne, gained fame in the first few years of the new century with their hooky, energetic pop-punk. The band also released a new album in 2022, “Harder Than It Looks,” its sixth studio album.\n\nThe duo of Nick Gross (Big Noise, Gross Labs, Find Your Grind) and Travis Mills (musical artist, Beats 1 Host, actor), also known as Girlfriends is riding their 2023 EP “Over My Dead Body.”"
