        "text": "Link to her newest song http://youtube.com/watch?v=cQ25-glGRzI\n\nBorn: September 27, 1984 – Belleville, Ontario, Canada\n\nQuote From Avril Lavigne:\n\n“i dont want to be compared to Britney, Ashlee, Hilary or Lindsay. i want to be compared to me.”\n\nAvril Lavigne Trivia Fact:\n\nAvril Lavigne was the youngest female artist ever to have a #1 album in the U.K.\n\nEarly Years:\n\nAvril Lavigne grew up in the small town of Napanee, Ontario. She was discovered by her first manager singing country songs in a bookstore in Kingston, Ontario. At the age of 16 Avril came to the attention of Arista records head L.A. Reid, and she was offered a recording contract.\n\nCreating ‘Let Go,’ Avril Lavigne’s First Album:\n\nWith her new recording contract, Avril Lavigne moved to New York City. She was surrounded by some of the top songwriters and producers in the music business. Unfortunately, she was disappointed with her co-songwriters. Lavigne moved to Los Angeles and connected with Cliff Magness and the Matrix songwriting team. They helped put together the album Let Go.\n\nPop Success:\n\nLet Go, released in 2002, when Avril Lavigne was 17, was nearly an instant hit. Within 6 months the album sold over 4 million copies in the U.S. “Complicated,” the album’s first single, reached #2 on the pop singles chart. “Sk8erboi,” the followup, reached the top 10 as well and helped hone Lavigne’s self-chosen image as a skater punk. She soon found herself spearheading a wave of independent young female singers and setting fashion trends. Ultimately Let Go sold more than 15 million copies worldwide.For the followup album Under My Skin, released in 2004, Avril Lavigne worked extensively with Canadian songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk. She also worked with three producers for the album: Butch Walker of the Marvelous 3, Raine Maida, Kreviazuk’s husband, and Don Gilmore, producer of Good Charlotte and Linkin Park. The result was an album that sounded more mature and polished than Let Go. Under My Skin debuted at the top of the pop albums chart and included “My Happy Ending,” another top 10 hit single.In 2005, Avril Lavigne announced her engagement To Deryck Whibley of the punk pop group Sum 41. After the announcement Whibley headed to Europe to tour with his group while Lavigne continued her Bonez Tour through North America.\n\nAnything but ordinary. That’s putting it mildly when describing Avril Lavigne. A skater-punk, a dynamic spirit, a true wild child. One of those rare creatures who started wowing people with her voice and character at around age 2. A small-town kid who couldn’t sit still in class but had the confidence and determination to take off, virtually on her own, to hone her songwriting skills in New York City and Los Angeles. A startlingly up-front and outrageous 17-year-old with everything it takes to reach stardom-completely on her own terms. “I’m just coming out and I’m going to clearly be myself-I write what I feel, I never worry what others think, ” Avril avows. “I’m gonna dress what’s me, I’m gonna act what’s me and I’m gonna sing what’s me.”\n\nAvril does exactly that on her debut CD, Let Go, flaunting sassy vocals, a crystal clear voice with real-girl lyrical style. “Anything But Ordinary” is a rockin’ ode to individuality, while guitar-driven first single, “Complicated,” is a simple song that kicks pretenders to the curb. The string-inflected “I’m With You” reaches out for connection to reflect Avril’s more mellower side, but tracks like “Losing Grip” and “Unwanted” courageously confront rejection and betrayal with all the heaviness such subjects demand. Then there’s “My World” and the metaphoric “Mobile,” which perfectly articulate the Avril experience. “I have this awesome opportunity to fulfill my dream. I am all over the place, flying here and there, going through different stuff every day,” she explains. “This is my lifestyle, but I wouldn’t want a normal life or I’d get bored.”\n\nApparently, Avril was born for such insanity. A middle child who “always wanted to be the center of attention,” she was bound to bust out of Napanee, Ontario, population 5,000. “I always knew this was what I had to do,” she says. “I remember when I was really young, standing on my bed like it was a stage, singing at the top of my lungs and visualizing thousands of people surrounding me.” She segued from her bedroom to singing, well, whenever and wherever she could-starting in church singing gospel music, and on to festivals, then singing country music at fairs and talent contests-until she was discovered by Arista Records.\n\nOn a writing trip to NYC, Avril caught the attention of Antonio “LA” Reid, who snapped her up and signed her to Arista. At 16, she moved to Manhattan and began work on her debut CD. Avril plunged into the creative process. “I love writing,” she explains. “When I get upset and really need to get it out of me I go to my guitar. Sometimes I feel like my guitar is my therapist.”\n\nAlthough Avril virtually lived in the studio during that New York stint, her efforts didn’t pay off at first. “I started working with these really talented people, but I just wasn’t feeling it; the songs weren’t representative of me,” she admits. “Then they started talking about having people write for me, but I had to write myself. I had to do my music. It was a really stressful time, but I never considered giving up.” Instead, she flipped coasts. Los Angeles gave Avril the fresh start she needed.\n\nIt was there that she hooked up with producer/songwriter Clif Magness, and “I was like, ‘Yeah! I’ve found my guy!'” she enthuses. “We totally clicked, because he just let me guide; he really understood me and let me do my thing.” The songs for Let Go began pouring out, with Magness at the helm as well as up-and-coming production team the Matrix. Soon after Avril hooked up with Nettwerk Management who’ve steered the careers of Sarah McLachlan, Dido, Coldplay, Barenaked Ladies and Sum 41.\n\nAvril couldn’t be happier with the way the album turned out. “In this past year I’ve really grown as a writer. ‘Complicated’ wasn’t written about anyone in particular. It is basically about life, people being fake and relationships.” As to one of her favorite tracks, “Losing Grip,” she says, “That is definitely one of my ex-boys-he didn’t give me what I needed emotionally.” Avril laughs, “It doesn’t matter now, and plus I got a good song out of it.”\n\nNow that her album is done, Avril can’t wait to get out and play. She jokes, pointing out that touring with her own sk8er punk band of rocker boys probably won’t be all that different from her childhood, “I was always a tomboy and I guess I still am. I played hockey during the fall / winter and baseball in the summer. I loved playing with the boys.\n\nBut Avril’s music is capable of reaching the girls and the guys, and more than a few adventurous adults too-and she’s chomping at the bit to bring it to ’em.\n\nAvril is a rocking girl who loves to have fun and is living out her dream. Yup, this 19 year-old punk-rocker is everything you can think of, that’s everything but ordinary of course."
