        "text": "Avril Ramona Lavigne (born September 27, 1984) is a Canadian singer-songwriter. Her first album Let Go was credited as the biggest pop debut of 2002. It was certified seven-times Platinum in the United States. Lavigne is considered a key musician in the development of pop punk music since she paved the way for female-driven, punk-influenced pop music in the early 2000s.\n\nEarly life[change | change source]\n\nLavigne grew up in Ontario. At the age of 14, she began writing her own music and performing at country fairs. Her first song \"Can't Stop Thinking About You\" was about a teenage crush, which she described as \"cheesy cute\". By the age of 15, she had appeared on stage with Shania Twain. By 16, she had signed a two-album recording contract with Arista Records worth more than $2 million.\n\nMusic career[change | change source]\n\n2002–2003: Let Go[change | change source]\n\nIn June 2002, Lavigne began with the release of her first album Let Go and also a music video for the first single Complicated. In the US, it reached number two on the Billboard 200 chart. At 17 years old, Lavigne was the youngest female soloist to have a number-one album on the UK Albums Chart at that time. She was nominated for five Grammy Awards.[1] Complicated, Sk8r Boi and I'm With You were all number one songs on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40.[2][3]\n\n2004–2005: Under My Skin[change | change source]\n\nUnder My Skin, was released in May 2004. The album debuted at number one in Australia, Mexico, Canada, Japan, UK, and U.S.[4] The singles from the album were \"Don't Tell Me\", \"My Happy Ending\", \"Nobody's Home\" and \"He Wasn't\". Lavigne was awarded for \"World's Best Pop/Rock Artist\" and \"World's Bestselling Canadian Artist\" at the 2004 World Music Awards. She received five Juno Award nominations in 2005, and won three of them, including \"Artist of the Year\".\n\n2006–2008: The Best Damn Thing[change | change source]\n\nThe Best Damn Thing was released In April 2007. Girlfriend, the first single from the album became Lavigne's first number-one single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.[5] The album was the first to carry a parental advisory warning due to repeated use of swear words.[6] She described the album as \"fast, fun, young, bratty, aggressive, confident, cocky in a playful way... all the good stuff\".[7] The albums second single was When You're Gone. She won two World Music Awards in 2007, for \"World's Bestselling Canadian Artist\" and \"World's Best Pop/Rock Female Artist\".\n\n2009–2011: Goodbye Lullaby[change | change source]\n\n“ This record definitely proves that I'm a writer and people can't knock that, because each song comes from a personal experience of mine, and there are so much emotions in those songs. ”\n\n—Avril Lavigne, The Ledger[8]\n\nGoodbye Lullaby was released on March 2011 in the US.[9] Lavigne described the album as being about her life experiences rather than focusing on relationships. Other than the lead single \"What the Hell\", she described the album as less pop rock than her previous material.[10] The album received Juno Award nominations for Album of the Year and Pop Album of the Year.\n\n2012–2017: Self-titled album[change | change source]\n\nLavigne's fifth studio album, the self-titled Avril Lavigne, was released on November 2013. She described the album as being \"pop and more fun again\". The four singles from the album were \"Here's to Never Growing Up\", \"Rock n Roll\", \"Let Me Go\", and \"Hello Kitty\".\n\n2019–2020: Head Above Water[change | change source]\n\nLavigne's sixth studio album Head Above Water was released on February 2019. The four singles from the album were: \"Head Above Water\", \"Tell Me It's Over\", \"Dumb Blonde\" and \"I Fell in Love with the Devil\". She re-recorded the track \"Warrior\" and released it as a single titled \"We Are Warriors\". All the proceeds from the single supported Project HOPE during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n2021–present: Love Sux[change | change source]\n\nIn February 2021, Lavigne's seventh studio album Love Sux was released. A new edition of Let Go was released for the album's 20th anniversary in June 2022. In September of the same year, she received her own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in September.[11] While promoting the deluxe edition of Love Sux, Lavigne confirmed she was working on her eighth studio album.\n\nInfluences[change | change source]\n\nLavigne's earlier influences came from country music acts such as Garth Brooks, the Chicks, and Shania Twain; and alternative singer-songwriters such as Alanis Morissette, Lisa Loeb, Natalie Imbruglia, and Janis Joplin. By the time she left school to focus on her music career, Lavigne was musically more influenced by skate punk, pop punk, and punk rock acts such as blink-182, the Offspring, Sum 41, NOFX, Pennywise, Dashboard Confessional, Green Day, the Ramones, the Distillers, and Hole. She also enjoyed metal bands such as Marilyn Manson, System of a Down, Incubus, and the Used; as well as alternative bands such as Nirvana, No Doubt, the Goo Goo Dolls, Radiohead, the Cranberries, Coldplay, Oasis, Third Eye Blind, and Matchbox Twenty.\n\nDiscography[change | change source]\n\nStudio albums[change | change source]\n\nLet Go (2002)\n\nUnder My Skin (2004)\n\nThe Best Damn Thing (2007)\n\nGoodbye Lullaby (2011)\n\nAvril Lavigne (2013)\n\nHead Above Water (2019)\n\nLove Sux (2022)\n\nSingles[change | change source]\n\nYear Singles and soundtracks Album 2002 Complicated Let Go Sk8er Boi I'm with You 2003 Losing Grip Mobile 2004 Don't Tell Me Under My Skin My Happy Ending Nobody's Home 2005 He Wasn't Fall to Pieces 2006 Keep Holding On (soundtrack) The Best Damn Thing 2007 Girlfriend When You're Gone Hot 2008 The Best Damn Thing 2010 Alice (soundtrack) Almost Alice 2011 What the Hell Goodbye Lullaby 2011 Smile 2011 Wish You Were Here 2013 Here's to Never Growing Up Avril Lavigne Rock n Roll Let Me Go\n\n(featuring Chad Kroeger) 2014 Hello Kitty 2015 Give You What You Like Fly Non-album single 2019 Head Above Water Head Above Water Tell Me It's Over Dumb Blonde I Fell in Love with the Devil 2020 We Are Warriors Non-album single 2021 Bite Me Love Sux 2022 Love It When You Hate Me I'm a Mess 2023 Fake as Hell Non-album single\n\nFilmography[change | change source]\n\nYear Movie Role Other notes Reference 2002 Sabrina, the Teenage Witch Herself Guest-star, perform \"Sk8er Boi\" [12] 2004 Over the Hedge Heather Voice [13] 2006 Fast Food Nation Alice College activist [14] 2006 Going the Distance Herself Cameo, perform \"Losing Grip\" [15] 2007 The Flock Young Lady Girlfriend of crime suspect [16] 2010 American Idol Herself Guest judge (L.A. auditions) [17] 2011 Majors & Minors Herself Guest mentor 2018 Charming Snow White Voice\n\nTours[change | change source]\n\nHeadlining[change | change source]\n\nTry To Shut Me Up Tour (2002–03)\n\nBonez Tour / Mall Tour (2004–05)\n\nThe Best Damn World Tour (2008)\n\nThe Black Star Tour (2011–2012)\n\nThe Avril Lavigne Tour (2013–2014)\n\nHead Above Water Tour (2019)\n\nLove Sux Tour (2022–2023)\n\nGreatest Hits Tour (2024)\n\nReferences[change | change source]\n\nOther websites[change | change source]\n\nOfficial site\n\nOfficial Myspace"
