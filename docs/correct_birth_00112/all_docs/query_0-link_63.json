I am who I am. And who I wanna be.”\n\n“I’d like to be a little more hard-rocking on my next album. But I hate the whole label thing.”\n\nPeople ask me if I regret wasting my last teen years on becoming a singer. You know something? I don’t. Because singing is my life. When and if you want something so badly you’ll see. I mean, I’m just so blessed to be doing what I love to do and to have been given this opportunity. I thank God because there are so many more talented people out there that will never even come close to getting a record deal.\n\n“To understand me, you have to meet me and be around me. And then only if I’m in a good mood – don’t meet me in a bad mood.”\n\n“My mom wouldn’t let me sing ‘Strawberry Wine’ because it had ‘wine’ in it.”\n\n“When I was 2 my mom said she knew I was going to be a singer. I’ve been performing ever since I was a young kid. So I’ve known I wanted to do this for awhile. I always knew in my heart that I’d be singing.”\n\n“I’m just coming out and I’m going to clearly be myself – I write what I feel, I never worry what others think.”\n\nI can write a song a day.\n\n“My dream was always to hop up on stage in front of my fans every night and perform.”\n\n“Actually, I know for a fact there are some young female artists who don’t even sing on their own records and who don’t sing live. And that is pathetic.” (about lipsynching)"
