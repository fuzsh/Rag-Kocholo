        "text": "Avril Lavigne is finally getting her flowers in Canada.\n\nOn Saturday night, the Canadian pop-punk icon, 39, was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame during a 25th anniversary gala in Toronto. The Walk of Fame honours Canadians for excellence in a variety of fields, including entertainment, sports and humanitarianism.\n\nHeld at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, Lavigne brought her signature all-black style to the event, where she wore a cropped zippered leather jacket, a black turtleneck, knee-high black boots and an asymmetrical skirt.\n\nThe \"Girlfriend\" and \"Complicated\" singer joined several other notable Canadians who were inducted into the Walk of Fame on Saturday. That includes political satirist Rick Mercer, hockey superstar Connor McDavid, \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" actress Tantoo Cardinal, Roots co-founders Michael Budman and Don Green as well as the \"Degrassi\" franchise.\n\nThe official Canada's Walk of Fame Instagram account shared a series of posts from the event, where people expressed their love for Lavigne in the comments section of one round-up.\n\n\"So well deserved, [Avril Lavigne]! My all time always favourite Canadian. Love you so much!\" one fan wrote.\n\n\"Omg, pop punk rock princess legend,\" another added.\n\n\"I am proud to be your fan. You are a woman who inspired many girls and you continue to do well. Well deserved this recognition, you are a great example for everyone,\" someone chimed in.\n\n\"One and only,\" raved someone else, while tagging her account.\n\nLast September, the \"When You're Gone\" artist was celebrated in Los Angeles after being inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The star, who grew up in Napanee, Ont., marked the milestone and celebrated the 20th anniversary of her \"Let Go\" album wearing an outfit that channelled the \"old Avril,\" according to fans.\n\n\"Look, mom. I got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame,\" the singer penned in the caption to one of her posts from 2022.\n\n\"The old Avril would have probably rocked this exact outfit and that is exactly why I love you! You know exactly who you are and you haven't changed for anyone. Congratulations, pop-punk queen! You deserve this long overdue recognition,\" one person wrote.\n\n\"It's about time!\" another shared, while someone commented, \"The hoodie is iconic.\"\n\n\"While watching the ceremony, I started to cry when I saw you wearing the hoodie,\" admitted one fan. \"Iâ€™m so proud of you! You deserved it!\""
