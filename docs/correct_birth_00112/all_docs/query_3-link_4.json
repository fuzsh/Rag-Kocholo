The street where Avril's childhood home was was called Angus Drive. Before Let Go came out, she released an EP with that name.\n\nPost by BogoGog24 on\n\nI've just watched the video, it is pretty typical stuff I've seen before from other videos about her hometown, but the pizza place looks really cool! Years ago visiting Napanee was on my bucket list, I think I'd still like to be able to go someday, even though it's kind of a far drive from where I live and there isn't much to see there besides like what? Her old school and the pizza place? I've always wanted to try the pizza though, I've heard from people who have eaten there that it's good!\n\nEdit: I just looked up how far of a drive it would be from where I live and it's nearly a 7 hour drive one way lol Would be super cool but... nah fam lol\n\nPost by Srrrrr on\n\nPlease feel free to delete if this is forbidden info to publish but I have to share..\n\nthe street name was ABBEY DAWN!!\n\nIsn't Abbey Dawn Road or whatever actually the street where her dad worked?

Before Let Go came out, she released an EP with that name.\n\nDAMNIT just checked and youre right.\n\nguess it's been too long and i'm losing my memory.\n\nmust have mixed them together because of the title of her first ep. I remember thinking back then how cool it was that she named something after her own street.\n\njust didn't remember what it was I guess .\n\noops\n\nPost by katy on\n\nYeah I’ve always wanted to stop by Napanee. we’re actually planning Canada when we’re allowed to travel again but we wanna do British Columbia area which I see is nowhere near napanee (just 38 hours drive the other way...!) maybe one day lol.\n\nPost by gabbox on\n\nlast week I was thinking of traveling to NY and Toronto next year if it will be possible.. I would like to go to Napanee and try the pizza even though I can't think it's better than the ones I'm used to.. but it would be such an experience!\n\nAt this point I would like to spend a day in Napanee if it's not too far too reach from Toronto, considering that who knows, in case, if I will ever visit Toronto again. Yes I would like\n\nPost by adamf83 on\n\nI've always wanted to go too. Just checked and to get there for me it would be a 1 and half hour train from Newcastle to Edinburgh. Then a 7 hour flight from Edinburgh to Toronto. Then a two hour train journey from Toronto to Napanee. Seems crazy to do that journey to see a house, school and eat some pizza but it's Avril so I would!\n\nPost by ★Caro★ on\n\nI've always wanted to go too.

I spent a whole day there and everyone was really friendly although they noticed I wasn’t even Canadian. (And the pizza was fantastic xD)\n\nPost by adamf83 on\n\nI've always wanted to go too.

Also think the owners of La Pizzeria are retiring so it might not be as Avril themed in future sadly."
