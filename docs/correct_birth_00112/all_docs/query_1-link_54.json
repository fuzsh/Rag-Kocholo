        "text": "1. Avril Lavigne\n\n2. Early yearsAvril Lavigne was born in Belleville, Ontario, Canada on September 27th 1984 . She has an older brother, Matthew, and a younger sister, Michelle. Avril, at the age of two, began singing church songs along with her mother. The family moved to Napanee, Ontario, when she was five years old.In 1998, Lavigne won a competition to sing with Shania Twain on her first major concert tour. She appeared alongside Twain at her concert in Ottawa, appearing on stage to sing “What Made You Say That”. She was discovered by her first professional manager, Cliff Fabri, while singing country covers at a Chapters bookstore in Kingston, Ontario. During a performance with the Lennox Community Theatre, Avril was spotted by local folk singer Steve Medd, who invited her to contribute vocals on his song, \"Touch the Sky\", for his 1999 album, Quinte Spirit. She later sang on \"Temple of Life\" and \"Two Rivers\" for his follow up 2000 album, My Window to You.\n\n5. Music careerIn November 2000, Lavigne signed as a singer. Lavigne sang songs written by others. However,she insisted she wanted to write herself. For a year,Lavigne and Arista Records had conflicts in musical direction.Finally,she started to write her songs. She started with Let Go , released in 2002,when she was 17 years old. Lavigne’s second album,Under My Skin, was released in 2004 and was her first album to peak at the number 1 position on the U.S. Billboard 200. The Best Damn Thing is Lavigne’s third and most recent album and was released in 2007; this album gave Lavigne her third number 1 album in the UK Albums Chart and also featured her first U.S. Billboard Hot 100 single, in the form of Girlfriend. Lavigne has scored a total of five number-one singles worldwide, including Complicated, Sk8er Boi, I'm With You, My Happy Ending and Girlfriend. She is currently working on her fourth studio album, expected to be released in June of this year.\n\n9. Film careerLavigne appeared in the 2004 film Going the Distance and also appeared in a 2002 episode of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, performing Sk8er Boi with her band. Her feature film debut was in the 2006 animated film Over the Hedge, in which she voiced the character named Heather.Lavigne starred in the 2007 Richard Gere film, The Flock, as the girlfriend of a crime suspect, and also appeared in the 2006 film Fast Food Nation, based on the book Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of All-American Meal.\n\n12. Abbey DawnWhen Lavigne first gained publicity, she was known for her tomboyish style, in particular her usual neck-tie and tank-top combination.Lavigne eventually started to take on a darker, more gothic style as she began her second album, Under My Skin. During The Best Damn Thing era, Lavigne dyed her hair blonde with a pink streak and generally became more feminine. Some fans felt she had become too upbeat and lost her original style.Abbey Dawn is a clothing line designed by her, exclusively for Kohl's in the US. The line is described as a 'Juniors' lifestyle brand', and Lavigne said the clothes are inspired by her own personal style; she also said the line should be affordable to fans, so the pieces range from $24 – $48.\n\n15. Avril Lavigne's Make 5 WishesLavigne has been featured in a comic series Avril Lavigne´s Make 5 Wishes. She stars as herself, a rock star who is idolized by the protagonist of the story.Avril Lavigne's Make 5 Wishes is a manga style comic book written by Joshua Dysart with artwork by Camilla D'Errico. The first volume was released by Del Rey on April 10, 2007, with volume 2 released on July 3, 2007. The Comic was also released in Brazil with the name “Faça cinco pedidos\"."
