        "text": "AKA Avril Ramona Lavigne\n\nBorn: 27-Sep-1984\n\nBirthplace: Napanee, Ontario, Canada\n\nGender: Female\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Singer\n\nNationality: Canada\n\nExecutive summary: Manufactured pop star\n\nAvril Lavigne is a pop-punk singer who scored a hit in 2002 with her bubble-gum ballad, \"Sk8er Boi\", later the basis of a feature film.\n\nAs a child she sang in her church choir, and by junior high she taught herself to play her dad's guitar. She competed in talent contests, sang (mostly country music) at local fairs, and signed a recording contract at 16. The headstrong Lavigne rejected several of the songs and songwriters her label lined up for her first album, and apparently her instincts were wise. Her debut album, Let Go, was a multi-platinum hit, making a millionaire of the high school dropout. In posed publicity shots she rarely smiles, and often seems to growl beneath her sneer.\n\nIn her first years of fame she was often described as a skater-punk, but she says she is only a fair skateboarder, and \"I never claimed to be punk\". True punks probably don't do mall tours, but Lavigne did for years, and she had a recurring role on Sabrina the Teenaged Witch. When the 2003 Grammy nominations were announced, they had Lavigne help read the names, and she mispronounced David Bowie's last name (rhyming with Maui instead of showy). She explained that she had never heard of him.\n\nFather: John Lavigne\n\nMother: Judy Lavigne\n\nSister: Michelle Lavigne\n\nBrother: Matthew Lavigne\n\nHusband: Deryck Whibley (m. 15-Jul-2006, sep.
