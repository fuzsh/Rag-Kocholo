        "text": "Avril Lavigne was born on September 27, 1984 in a 5,000 population town called Napanee, which is located in Ontario, Canada. As the middle child, she always tried to grab the attention when it wasn't on her. Anything but ordinary. That's putting it mildly when describing Avril Lavigne. A skater-punk, a dynamic spirit, a true wild child. One of those rare creatures who started wowing people with her voice and character at around age 2. She was in many talent shows as a child. She got her first guitar at a young age. \"I always knew this was what I had to do,\" she says. \"I remember when I was really young, standing on my bed like it was a stage, singing at the top of my lungs and visualizing thousands of people surrounding me\". She segued from her bedroom to singing, well, whenever and wherever she could-starting in church singing gospel music, and on to festivals, then singing country music at fairs and talent contests-until she was discovered by Arista Records. She broke out of Napanee, Ontario when she was 16. She had been writing her own songs ever since she got her first guitar and has been skateboarding ever since she was 14. A startlingly up-front and outrageous 17-year-old with everything it takes to reach stardom-completely on her own terms. \"I'm just coming out and I'm going to clearly be myself-I write what I feel, I never worry what others think, \" Avril avows. \"I'm gonna dress what's me, I'm gonna act what's me and I'm gonna sing what's me\". Avril does exactly that on her debut CD, Let Go, flaunting sassy vocals, a crystal clear voice with real-girl lyrical style. \"Anything But Ordinary\" is a rockin' ode to individuality, while guitar-driven first single, \"Complicated,\" is a simple song that kicks pretenders to the curb. The string-inflected \"I'm With You\" reaches out for connection to reflect Avril's more mellower side, but tracks like \"Losing Grip\" and \"Unwanted\" courageously confront rejection and betrayal with all the heaviness such subjects demand. Then there's \"My World\" and the metaphoric \"Mobile,\" which perfectly articulate the Avril experience. \"I have this awesome opportunity to fulfill my dream. I am all over the place, flying here and there, going through different stuff every day,\" she explains. \"This is my lifestyle, but I wouldn't want a normal life or I'd get bored\"."
