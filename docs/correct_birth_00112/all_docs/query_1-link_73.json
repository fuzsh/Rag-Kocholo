        "text": "Birthdate: September 27, 1984\n\nBirthplace: Napanee, Ontario\n\nAvril Lavigne - Her Start\n\nAvril Lavigne began singing at festivals, country music fairs and talent contests before being discovered. On a trip to New York City, Avril Lavigne lucked out by being in the right place at the right time. Avril was in a studio writing when she caught the eye of Antonio \"LA\" Reid who got the young artist a contract with Arista Records.\n\nAvril Lavigne - Hit It Big\n\nAvril Lavigne's debut album, Let Go, (which was released in June 2002), has sold millions of copies world wide. At that time, Avril took the world by storm - literally. Avril Lavigne's Try To Shut Me Up world tour was a huge success. If you missed seeing her in your town, you can check out Avril Lavigne's show on her My World DVD. My World was released in the fall of 2003 and it features live versions of Avril Lavigne's hits like Complicated and Sk8er Boi as well as cover tunes, like Green Day's Basket Case.\n\nAvril Lavigne - Growing Up\n\nWhen Let Go was released, Avril Lavigne was just 17. She sang about not fitting in, her crushes, her heart being broken and she sang it like a rockstar. It wasn't long before girls everywhere were trading in their midriff-bearing outfits for T-shirts, Dickies and Chucks. Well, that same hard-rockin' chica hit back with her second album, Under My Skin, which featured the track, Don't Tell Me. This time being a little older and a little wiser, she still rocked the message of girl power, just in a different way. Chantal Kreviazuk helped Avril on some of her songs and has supported her throughout her career. Avril Lavigne says she draws inspiration from bands like the Goo Goo Dolls, Incubus and Matchbox 20.\n\nAvril Lavigne - Did U Know?\n\nAvril Lavigne knew she wanted to be a singer when she was just a little kid.\n\nAvril Lavigne was only 12 years old when she wrote her first song.\n\nAvril Lavigne also taught herself to play the guitar when she was 12.\n\nAvril Lavigne gets compared to Alanis Morissette (although it might just be cuz they're both Canadian and female).\n\nAvril Lavigne is good friends with Pink, Vanessa Carlton and Fefe Dobson\n\nAvril Lavigne enjoys camping, skateboarding, hunting and hockey.\n\nAvril is married to Derek Whibley from Sum 41. The couple also share a mansion in California!\n\nAvril Lavigne Says...\n\n\"I love writing. When I get upset and really need to get it out of me, I go to my guitar. Sometimes I feel like my guitar is my therapist.\"\n\nAvril is the bomb!!! I love her song Complicated!\n\nKidz Submit By:\n\nNickname:katie119\n\nAge: 12\n\n[I luv Avril Lavigne. I wish I could meet her, she's just so0o0o cool without even trying.\n\nKidz Submit By:\n\nNickname: sk8erchild4avril\n\nAge: 12\n\nAvril is hot!\n\nKidz Submit By:\n\nNickname: Thomas42\n\nAge: 13\n\nWanna hear what other Kidzworld members are saying about Avril Lavigne?
