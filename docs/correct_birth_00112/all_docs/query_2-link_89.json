        "text": "It’s a special thing to be able to define and accomplish various things at the same time. The chance to start living the type of life one most dreams of is a chance not to be taken for granted by any means. Shortcuts can be useful at certain times in life, but never at the expense of who you really are. These are excerpts from punk pop makeup superstar, Avril Lavigne.\n\nBio (age, family)\n\nIt’s the most rewarding feeling knowing that what you started at a young age is the right path to follow. Born Avril Ramona Lavigne on September 27, 1984 in Belleville, Ontario, Canada. Avril is Canadian by nationality and is the second child of three siblings.\n\nShe has an older brother named Matthew or Matt, which Avril revealed in her interview, she always wanted to emulate her childhood. Matt is also the bassist for Avril’s song “Girlfriend”. She grew up with a Christian faith and her parents are deeply religious people. Her father, Jean-Claude Joseph Lavigne, was a technician at Bell Canada and her mother, Judith-Rosanne “Judy”, was a stay-at-home mom.\n\nThe family would later move to Napanee, Ontario, an even smaller town in Belleville. They attended Temple Evangel where young Avril started singing in the choir at the age of ten. Avril, growing up, learned to play instruments like guitar and piano, among others. Her father had a studio built in the basement and bought a sound machine for Avril to improve. She supposedly started with country music before deciding to explore other genres. As a teenager, she had started writing her own songs.\n\nNet value\n\nAvril began performing very early in her life, at church, county fairs and the like and it was at one of these performances that her first manager, Cliff Fabri, found her a talent during a performance in a bookstore. She was fourteen at the time. When she turns sixteen two years later, she will be auditioned by Arista Records in New York. Within fifteen minutes, Avril signed a two-record $1.25 million contract.\n\nAlso Read: Christina Aguilera Biography, Age, Height, Weight, Net worth, Children, Husband\n\nAfter this development, Avril left high school to focus solely on producing her debut album and what an album it was! Titled Let Go, it was released on June 4, 2002 and went platinum, selling over a million copies in just over a month. Some of the hit tracks from this album include ‘Complicated’, ‘I’m With You’ and ‘Sk8er Boi’.\n\nNot resting on her laurels, she kept her style of music elated as she released her second album “Under My Skin” in 2004 which topped the US Billboards. The album contains great tracks like ‘Nobody’s Home’, ‘Don’t Tell Me Me’ and ‘My Happy Ending’.\n\nIn 2007, she released the album The Best Thing with the hit song “Girlfriend” on it. Her next albums were Au Revoir Lullaby and Avril Lavigne each also touting their own big hits. She’s seen her fair share of recognition at the Juno Awards and been nominated for 8 Grammys.\n\nMusic hasn’t been her only area of ​​expertise, as she has her own fashion line and fragrance, as well as has to appear in a few movies. Avril Lavigne has a net worth of $50 million\n\nHusband\n\nApril has been married several times over the years. She first met Deryck Whibley, a Canadian musician, and they got married in 2006. After three years of marriage, they finally divorced in 2010. She met Brody Jenner shortly before meeting Chad Kroeger. In August 2012 she was engaged to him and in July 2013 they were married. They would later separate in 2015.\n\nIs Avril Lavigne dead or alive?\n\nThere has been a rumor that Avril has been replaced by a doppelganger named Melissa since 2003. The conspiracy theory states that Avril cannot handle the spotlight and has to use a doppelganger but the real Avril later dies and the house of discs decides to continue with his doppelganger. Well, that’s all the theory, but it’s wrong. Avril Lavigne is alive and rocking."
