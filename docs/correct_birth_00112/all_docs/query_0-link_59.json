        "text": "Avril Ramona Lavigne (born September 27, 1984) is a Canadian singer, songwriter, and actress. She started her career after winning a contest to perform with Shania Twain in 1999. She is considered to be the \"Pop Punk Queen\" and is credited with giving pop music more variety besides the dance-pop that was popular with artists like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. As of 2022, she has released seven albums.\n\nEarly life\n\nAvril Ramona Lavigne was born in Belleville, Ontario, on September 27, 1984, to a mother of English, Scottish, and German descent and a French-Canadian father. Her parents recognized her vocal abilities when she sang \"Jesus Loves Me\" on the way home from church when she was 2.\n\nWhy She and Her Songs Rock\n\nMany of her songs are very memorable, like \"Girlfriend\", and \"Complicated\".\n\nShe can play several different instruments.\n\nShe has some really good lyrics.\n\nShe has a great voice.\n\nHer music videos are great, such as the aforementioned \"Girlfriend\" where it's not just herself, but she also has two alter egos in that video.\n\nShe is a good voice actress in the case of Over the Hedge.\n\nShe has great album covers, like the Under My Skin cover art, which is used for its dark tone cover art with a red cross on it.\n\nShe can mix genres together well.\n\nShe can give her songs a different tone.\n\nMany people can associate \"Girlfriend\" with the old days of YouTube since it used to be the website's most viewed video at the time.\n\nShe has influenced several artists, including Aly & AJ, Busted, Billie Eilish, Hilary Duff, Rob Halford, Courage My Love, Ed Sheeran, Vanessa Hudgens, Jessie J, Jonas Brothers, Brie Larson, Lesley Roy, Ashley Tisdale, Ariana Grande, Paramore, Amy Studt, Meghan Trainor, Hey Monday, Kelly Osbourne, Amanda Palmer, Misono, YUI, Demi Lovato, Kirstin Maldonado, PVRIS, Soccer Mommy, Snail Mail, Liz Phair, Lil Uzi Vert, Princess Nokia, Lloyd Banks, the late Nipsey Hussle, John River, Bali Baby, Noname, Rico Nasty and Fat Tony.\n\nWhen she was asked about being named the \"Anti-Britney\", she said she doesn't really hate Britney Spears and has more of a mixed opinion of her. She said it was very rude and mean.\n\nShe helped spawn the legendary meme known as \"ear-rape\" (although her song that did it was pretty bad).\n\nShe did a killer\n\nBad Qualities\n\nShe has some bad songs, like \"Hello Kitty\" and her cover of \"Chop Suey!\" by System of a Down. However, the latter can be credited for inspiring the \"ear rape\" meme.\n\nOn the topic of the former, the song received criticism for its racist depiction of Japanese culture.\n\nWhile \"Girlfriend\" was positively received, it has a controversial message on how it's okay for a popular preppy girl to bully, harass and steal the boyfriend of a less popular and attractive girl. Her old goth/punk fanbase was not pleased with this.\n\nShe can be hypocritical, like when she claims to have written all of the songs on her debut album Let Go, when in reality, many professional songwriters co-wrote them with her.\n\nDiscography\n\nLet Go (2002)\n\nUnder My Skin (2004)\n\nThe Best Damn Thing]] (2007)\n\nGoodbye Lullaby (2011)\n\nAvril Lavigne (2013)\n\nHead Above Water (2019)\n\nLove Sux (2022)\n\nTrivia"
