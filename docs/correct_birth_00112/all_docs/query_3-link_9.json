        "text": "It was Grammy night in February 2003, and it seemed everyone in Napanee, Ont., was watching.\n\nTheir very own Avril Lavigne had burst onto pop charts the previous summer with the angsty, country-inflected song Complicated followed by another pop single, Sk8er Boi.\n\nNoted for a look that was a sassy teen-girl take on punk conventions, Lavigne was up for five of the American music awards.\n\nBack in 2003, Lavigne's fans were still waiting to find out whether she'd be taking a Grammy home.\n\n\"So far she's still got a chance in one last category,\" said Alison Smith, as CBC's The National was broadcasting at the same time as the Grammys. \"Win or lose, Napanee residents were celebrating the success of a hometown girl.\"\n\nHumble origins\n\nAt a Grammy viewing party in a Napanee school gym, reporter Heather Hiscox caught the enthusiasm of very young fans waving flags and carrying signs in support.\n\nSeveral of them were wearing red T-shirts branded with the logo for the Canadian hardware-store chain Home Hardware. Lavigne herself had sported a version of the shirt during an appearance on Saturday Night Live the previous month.\n\n\"She used to sing gospel in this church,\" said Hiscox, as the camera showed a local house of worship before cutting to home video of a 12-year-old Lavigne performing.\n\nRoadside signs and store billboards congratulated Lavigne and wished her luck with the awards.\n\nThe CBC also visited Lavigne's favourite pizza joint, where owner Bill Cosmopoulos could hardly keep up with orders for the \"Avril Special\" â€” mushrooms, olives and pepperoni.\n\nThe Avril effect\n\nThe local Home Hardware had also seen a boost in its T-shirt sales due to Lavigne.\n\n\"We sold about 3,000 here in the store ourselves,\" said employee Sarah Chambers. \"And about 6,000 have gone nationally and internationally into other stores.\"\n\nAcross the street, at Giant Tiger, the entire staff was \"copying Lavigne's trademark look, and wearing ties,\" said Hiscox.\n\nSure enough, two middle-aged staffers could be seen with neckties knotted loosely over a T-shirt and sweater.\n\nMayor David Remington said Napanee had seen a tourist bump as well.\n\n\"Last week I had a boy from Argentina come to Napanee to see Avril Lavigne's hometown,\" he said.\n\n'Dull and boring'\n\nBack at the Grammy party, a teenage girl had to shout into the mic to be heard above the din.\n\n\"It makes us look like not such a small town,\" she said.\n\nThe irony, as Hiscox pointed out, was that Lavigne herself had said many times in interviews that growing up in Napanee was \"dull and boring.\"\n\nIn the end, Lavigne was shut out of the Grammys in 2003.\n\nBut she took home four Juno Awards when Ottawa played host to the Canadian music awards a month later. Among them: Single of the Year, Album of the Year, and New Artist of the Year.\n\nNot a 'typical' teen\n\nIn October 2002, Lavigne talked to CBC about her then-recent appearance at the MTV Video Awards and other topics including the growing up she'd had to do since leaving Napanee.\n\n\"Being on the road has definitely, like, aged me and matured me and whatever, you know,\" she said, her studded wristbands flashing as she made an air quote.\n\n\"Being in business, you know, I don't have a typical, normal 17-year-old's life, or lifestyle. So I don't feel like a little kid around everyone.\""
