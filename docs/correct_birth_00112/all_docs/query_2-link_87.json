        "text": "Avril Ramona Lavigne CM ( AV-ril lə-VEEN, French:; born September 27, 1984) is a Canadian singer and songwriter. She is considered a key musician in the development of pop-punk music, as she paved the way for female-driven, punk-influenced pop music in the early 2000s. Her accolades include eight Grammy Award nominations.\n\nAt age 16, Lavigne signed a two-album recording contract with Arista Records. Her debut studio album, Let Go (2002), is the best-selling album of the 21st century by a Canadian artist. It yielded the successful singles \"Complicated\" and \"Sk8er Boi\"; the latter emphasized a skate punk persona and earned her the title \"Pop-Punk Queen\" from music publications. Her second studio album, Under My Skin (2004), became Lavigne's first album to reach the top of the Billboard 200 chart in the United States, going on to sell 10 million copies worldwide.\n\nLavigne's third studio album, The Best Damn Thing (2007), reached number one in seven countries worldwide and saw the international success of its lead single \"Girlfriend\", which became her first single to reach the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. Her next two studio albums, Goodbye Lullaby (2011) and Avril Lavigne (2013), saw continued commercial success and were both certified gold in Canada, the United States, and other territories. After releasing her sixth studio album, Head Above Water (2019), she returned to her punk roots with her seventh studio album, Love Sux (2022).\n\nAvril Ramona Lavigne CM ( AV-ril lə-VEEN, French:; born September 27, 1984) is a Canadian singer and songwriter.
