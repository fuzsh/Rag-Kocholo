        "text": "Avril Lavigneâs sharp, punk-informed pop can mean everything to any girl whoâs ever felt like an outsider. Born in Ontario, Canada, in 1984, the singer/songwriter was initially positioned as a teen antiheroâa rowdy, refreshing, slightly tomboyish counter to the coy, curated, overtly sexual stylings of chart dominators like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. And with the release of her 2002 debut album, Let Go, Lavigne didnât just go against that glossy image, she shattered it, spiking her hooks with sass and sincerity and making loose neckties and a tank top a must-have fashion statement. The young spitfire faced love with intimidating confidenceâshe not only fell for the âSk8er Boi,â she wrote songs with himâand approached poseurs with eye-rolling distaste, as expressed on her breakout single âComplicated.â Moving on from her teens, Lavigneâs kept that youthful spirit and outspoken edge alive, empowering girls to stand up for themselves (2004âs post-grunge earworm âDonât Tell Meâ), maybe steal a boy or two in the process (2007âs bubbly pop-punk anthem âGirlfriendâ), and never, ever lose touch with their wild side (2013âs punky sing-along âHereâs to Never Growing Upâ). Sheâs continually reinvented herself, too, moving effortlessly between romantic balladeer, stadium-rock warrior, and a âbombshell raisinâ hellââwhile baring all, even through public breakups and an enduring battle with Lyme disease. Itâs been enough to keep Lavigne in the spotlight, both on her own and as a major influence on notable admirers like Billie Eilish."
