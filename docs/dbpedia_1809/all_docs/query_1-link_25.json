        "meta_description": "1952 Dutch Grand Prix: With Alberto Ascari, Giuseppe Farina, Luigi Villoresi, Mike Hawthorn. The penultimate race of the season was in Deutschland and had 18 racers. Even though Ascari had won the last race, he still wanted to win these last two races to keep the win more safe. ERA G had a difficult time in this Grand Prix and still had to finish a race, The Cooper T20s were proving incredibly impressive at times and Connaught seemed to be as good as it was in Formula Two. Like always, Ascari has a good start and was on pole position, Hawthorn's cooper would try to challenge Ascari, but he would sadly be defeated by the 500 Chassis, after that, the Copper's realization was that they weren't powerful against Ferrari. Behra who had the best start of the Gordini's left on lap 10 due to Magneto failure and the only two Gordini's left were Manzon and Trintignant. The race didn't provide much entertainment and was won by no one's shock by Ascari with a time of: 2:53:28.5.",
