        "text": "The relation of the royal house to Ferrari -S/N-wise-\n\nby Raphale Crowley\n\nToday the Dutch are celebrating the coronation of their new king, Willem Alexander, son of former Queen Beatrix who was the daughter of Prince Bernhard Leopold Friedrich Eberhard Julius Kurt Karl Gottfried Peter Prinz zur Lippe-Biesterfeld and Queen Juliana.\n\nPrince Bernhard was admiring planes fast cars from early on and he was one of Ferrari’s clients for sure. At least eleven Ferraris are connected to Prins Bernhard. All cars are very well documented and show some special details for sure.\n\nHis first car was #0139E, a 212 Inter Coupe Ghia from 1951. The dark Green livery of 0139E should become a pattern for many of the cars to come. Prince Bernhard gave the car back to the Factory in 1953, however, he used the Serial Number on his next car, #0269EU as well as on #0387GT.\n\n0139E was sold to the US in 1955 and underwent some major “changes”. It received a Chevrolet automatic transmission as well as its rear axle. Later, the body of 0099S was mounted on chassis #139E. Crossing the Atlantic back to Europe, the car was not tied and it rolled forth and back during its travel. In the mid 1980s the car was once again on a big journey, this time to Australia, where the bodywork was rebuilt and the engine from #0259EU was installed.\n\n0269EU became the next “Royal Car”. It was subsequently renumbered to #0139 when Prins Bernhard purchased it in 1953, probably using 0139 as a trade in. After an ownership of two years, the Prince sold the car, obviously again back to the Factory. It is rumored, that the car was restamped # 0387GT, what was his next car’s Serial Number. Little is known about 0269’s history before its return from the typical spending of some time in the US to the Netherlands. It was offered in auctions quite often and Matthias Urban, F-Register’s chief editor, spotted the car –being for sale- at Artcurial’s auction at Palais de Congrès around the Retromobile as well as earlier that year at Maastricht’s Interclassic Topmobiel – funny enough, with Matthias’ Serial Number-Book placed on the fender and being read by Dutch collector Nico Koel.\n\n0387GT was subsequently renumbered as well at the time it was purchased by Prins Bernhard. Wearing #0139 the black car then found a new home in the UK before it was exported to Switzerland and then back to the Netherlands. In 2001 the car was offered for sale by GTC of Marseille.\n\n0725GT was one of the 250 GT Speciale PF Coupes. This car was fitted with a 4.9 Superamerica-style body. Once again being livered in Black, the car was sold in 1961 to A. J. M. Dries van der Lof before being exported to the US where it remains ever since. The car was temporarily painted in Marrone before being restored in 1999.\n\nReturning to a Green livery, Prins Bernhard purchased 6267, the 13th 500 Superfast, in August of 1964. The car was customized by having a 330 GT 4 liter engine installed. After the obligatory time in the US, the car was first owned by Swiss collector ErichTraber before becoming part of the Dutch Louwman collection where it can be viewed today in the Louwman museum.\n\n1969’s 365 GT 2+2 #11699 was also owned by Prins Bernhard as well as its successors #17129 and #17391. The more sportive fraction was covered by the Gabbone #14467. 44309, a 1982 400 i Automatic , ordered in custom Green met. with Beige interior with VIN ZFFEB06B000044309 was offered for sale by The Gallery of Brummen in the Netherlands quite recently.\n\nFinally, ZFFSD44B000096771, showing ass. # 14293, a 456 GT from 1993, livered in dark Green with Beige interior seems to be the Prins’ final Ferrari."
