        "text": "Dutch racing driver\n\nShirley van der Lof (born November 7, 1986, in Haaksbergen, Overijssel) is a racing driver from the Netherlands, and grand daughter of former Formula One-driver Dries van der Lof.[1] Besides her racing career, she has studied \"real estate and broking\". She strives to become the first Dutch female formula one driver.[2][3]\n\nShirley first started driving in go-karts at age 14, and was immediately hooked to the speed. In 2001, at age 15, she won her first go-karting championship. In 2006, she started in the Benelux Formula Ford championship. Her first years in auto racing resulted in a fair number of crashes, but also a fair share of success.[4][5]\n\nIn 2008, she started racing in the ATS Formel 3 Trophy for HS Technik Motorsport in a Dallara F304 OPC Challenge. In the first 8 races of her debut season, she finished on the podium 4 times: two times in 3rd place and two times in 2nd place. In 2019 she tested for W series but was not selected.[6]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
