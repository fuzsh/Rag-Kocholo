        "text": "Citation preview\n\nThe first 100 years of the world’s most glamorous and dangerous sport\n\nIt began at 6am on Tuesday, 26 June 1906, when the first of 34 pug-like cars prepared to go onto an immense, stone-strewn circuit outside Le Mans. At the instant that Lorraine-Dietrich accelerated away, the great, astonishing, frightening, heroic 100-year dynasty of Grand Prix racing was born. The sport which millions of people worldwide watch on television today is the direct, unbroken descendant of that. Grand Prix Century tells the whole story — from there to here — in a continuous narrative of living detail embracing many men, great and small, recreating a host of the most thrilling races and exploring in plain language the stunning technology.\n\nWoven into the text are the winners of every\n\nrace since that dawn in 1906, through to the Grand Prix that completed the century — by a coincidence in France. It was won by a young Spaniard, Fernando Alonso. Here, competing again, are the pioneers with their moustaches and goggles, who drove brutally primitive machines up to the First World War. Here are the good chaps of the 1920s and the sinister 1930s, when Hitler decreed that German cars must conquer the world — and got Mercedes and Auto Union to do it. Here, driving those cars, are the Italian maestro Tazio Nuvolari, the tragic Bernd Rosemeyer and Dick Seaman, the man lost between England and Nazi Germany. And here are the monstrously dangerous tracks they risked their lives on. Post-war we see Juan-Manuel Fangio\n\nraising the art of driving to new heights, Stirling Moss who pushed him so hard, Mike Hawthorn who drove in a bow tie. Here are the 1960s and a new generation:\n\nambassadorial Graham Hill, shy Jim Clark, forward-looking Jackie Stewart — a generation that melted into the 1970s. Then there was Alain Prost and the man who might have been graced by God, Ayrton Senna. The next maestro was the youngster who really wanted to be a footballer, Michael Schumacher. And so it goes on. Ace storyteller and respected historian Christopher Hilton is the author of a number of Haynes books including best-selling biographies of Ayrton Senna, Michael Schumacher, Juan Pablo Montoya and Murray Walker.\n\n£19.99 / $34.95\n\n97 JUN 2017\n\nae\n\nCees\n\n7s OR\n\naie\n\n25 NOV 2018 2 9 DEC 2015 _ Please return or renew this\n\nEast Sussex\n\nam\n\n~\n\n_ item by the last date shown.

Somewhere deep within, shrouded by absolute secrecy, three cars were being prepared: fast cars, racing cars.When they were ready, one of them had a trial run. It emerged from the factory gates — two brick pillars spanned by an arch of ornate, wrought iron bearing the words Renault Fréres — at a place called Boulogne-Billancourt on the rim of Paris. The car turned on to the quayside, houses to its left, trees standing like sentries to the right in front of the river. This early spring day, sunlight fell on the trees creating a geometry of shadows. As the car moved it ran across these shadows. The driver, a Hungarian, wore gloves, a stout leather jacket and cloth cap. He didn’t have goggles because on this test run he wouldn't be stretching the car. He’d do a lot of that very soon, but not here and not now. His riding mechanic — who'd help change wheels, carry out running repairs and any other tasks — sat immobile beside him, similar jacket, similar cap. Both had moustaches and looked severe, the way people did in public in 1906. The driver was Ferenc Szisz, known as Francois, and where he led many, many would follow, all the way to Michael Schumacher. The riding mechanic was known simply by the surname Marteau because riding mechanics were usually drawn from the working classes and that’s how the working classes were known. Marteau translated means Hammer — in motor racing, it’s as good a name as any. At the end of the run the car went back through the gates and into the absolute secrecy again. Some time after this, a small handpicked team in ordinary saloon cars drove to the provincial town of Le Mans 120 miles away and, methodically, explored the triangle of roads outside it. Once or twice Monsieur Renault himself came down and did that, too. Very early in June he set up headquarters in a chateau near the village of Changé, outside Le Mans — sloping rooftops, verdant gardens — and\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7,\n\nthe racing cars were brought. Day by day, the team prepared for the scrutineering in a tent in a field, and then made ready for 6:03 on the morning of 26 June and the first Grand Prix ever run. The race started at 6am, with cars being sent off every 90 seconds, which is how a driver called Camille Jenatzy — Belgian, but by coincidence of Hungarian origin — went at 6:07.30. The car he drove was a Mercedes. When Szisz won the race, Louis Renault stood with tears flowing down his face. Some say it was for his brother Marcel — killed in a road race three years before — but the tears surely mingled with that profound intoxication of creating a machine and hiring a driver to beat the best that anybody could put against them. Louis Renault may have been the first man to cry in Grand Prix racing. He would not be the last. Late winter, and three specially chartered Boeing 747 transport planes lifted off from England, Germany and Italy, bound for Melbourne, Australia. The little world born in 1906 had, a century later, become a global presence requiring jumbo jets to move it from continent to continent. There’d be the blood-red Ferraris from Italy, Williams with their BMW engines, Toyota from their base in Cologne, Sauber from Switzerland and — two arches across time — McLaren with Mercedes engines, and Renault moving 34 tonnes of freight and three cars. Renault’s engines came from Viry-Chatillon, not far from BoulogneBillancourt, the cars from their Enstone factory near Oxford. Renault alone took 80 people, including 40 mechanics and technicians, 10 race engineers, 5 caterers, 10 people to handle media, marketing and hospitality. Each of the three cars had mechanics, an engine mechanic, a hydraulic specialist, an electronics specialist, a race engineer, a data engineer, a control systems engineer, an engine\n\ntechnician, an engine electronics technician... The Renault of 1906, watched by a decorative crowd of great decorum in formal dress, averaged 62mph over almost 770 miles. Then everybody went away and didn’t come back for a year. After the Australian Grand Prix in 2005 — watched by the world — Renault and all the other teams went to Malaysia, Bahrain, Imola, Spain, Monaco, the Nurburgring, Canada and the United States before they reached the circuit of MagnyCours for the French Grand Prix in July and a century of racing. That Grand Prix racing began in the pastureland of one French Department and ended in the pastureland of another, 180 miles away, is just one of those coincidences which make history so wonderfully unnerving. That, at Magny-Cours, a personable Spaniard called\n\n8\n\nGRAND PRIX CENTURY\n\nFernando Alonso put his Renault on pole and won crisply and cleanly one sun-blessed afternoon is another. Surely somewhere Up There a certain Ferenc Szisz nodded his approval. Alonso beat a Finn, Kimi Raikk6nen, and his McLaren with its Mercedes engine... Here is the story from that misty dawn to that sunny afternoon. It is one of the greatest human stories and it all happened just like this.\n\nChapter 1\n\nDUSTY ROAD n January 1886 a severe-looking man with a drooping moustache, Karl Benz, applied for and was granted a patent to manufacture a motor vehicle. It resembled a frail, skeletal rickshaw with a small wheel at the front and two big wheels at the back, steered by a handle. Benz had a rival. A few months after patent’s granting, another severe-looking man with a drooping moustache, Gottlieb Daimler, put one of his engines in a coach and created the horseless carriage. The car had been born.\" Since recorded time, a horse had been the fastest means of transport over land. In the 19th century, and with a great suddenness, an era of innovation changed everything, and this new era moved to its own urgency, spread its own infinite possibilities. A Scot, James Watt,’ coined the term ‘horsepower’, but British inventors developed steam for locomotion and by 1829 when Robert Stephenson built a locomotive driven by steam, the horse had become extinct as a serious means of\n\ntransport. Trains profoundly changed life in Britain, and then the world, but there was an inherent constriction to the freedom they brought because you could only go where the railway lines went. The car offered personal choice. Steam needed big engines that weren’t really practical, or even safe, for anything as small as a car. Daimler solved this with the internal combustion engine and soon a lot of companies started to make cars because enough rich people would buy them. The by-product was probably coincidental — as well as chugging around in them looking pleased with yourself, you could race them. ed Competition seems to be a basic characteristic of man and originat the with survival. Darwin’s theory of evolution describes this. Even have — ng swimmi , simple acts of motion — walking, running, jumping hunt — become competitive events; and so have the simple acts of the sms — throwing, sprinting, working as a team. The defensive mechani have — down punching, kicking, seizing an opponent to throw him\n\n10\n\nGRAND PRIX CENTURY\n\nbecome boxing, kick-boxing, wrestling and judo. The spear has become the javelin, and the bow remains in archery. Rifle and pistol shooting are both Olympic events, and we still race horses just as we race bicycles. To do the same with cars was no more than extending man’s basic characteristic to the technology which, in 1886, had appeared. It didn’t take long. Soon enough, and there is something almost haunting about this, names familiar today would come in. Daimler and Benz were in already. In 1888, Michelin brothers Edouard and André set up a tyre company.’ Peugeot had been making racing bikes but in 1889 produced a threewheeler powered by steam. They soon understood Daimler’s engine was the future and, in 1891, a Daimler-powered Peugeot went across France to Paris and on to Brest in Brittany. No petrol-driven vehicle had made such a journey before and it produced a sales surge, from five cars a year to 72.\n\nIn November 1892, an Italian champion cyclist who lived in Castel d’Ario — a sleepy little stone-clad town with a through road, a broad square and church spires near Mantua — had his fourth child, a son. He earned a good living by farming the fertile plain which encircles the town. The fourth-born was a lively little lad and, as was the way of it, would surely work the land as his father did and one day no doubt inherit some of it, toiling in anonymity. He was called Tazio Nuvolari. Far from tilling the soil he’d become, some insist to this day, the greatest driver who ever lived - but he was born before a race had been run. While Grand Prix racing was not yet in its birth pangs, here was its future. The first race was in 1894, a trial of reliability and partly propaganda to prove that cars really could go faster than anything horse-drawn without exploding. Drivers had to cover the 78 miles from Paris to Rouen in eight and a half hours, and over a hundred entered. The internal combustion engine had not yet conquered all opposition and some of the vehicles were powered by steam, although they weren’t really cars at all; some worked on electricity and, anyway, of the hundred entrants only 21 showed up. A rich American newspaper owner based in Paris, Gordon Bennett, watched the start and was so captivated he even despatched a reporter to try to follow the event by bicycle, which is a lovely contradiction. It is tempting to portray the era in terms of caricature, seeing them all as drooping moustaches under black hats perched on strange, pug-like vehicles bounce-bounce-bouncing along rough country lanes; and more tempting because having your photograph taken was an event to be\n\nDUSTY ROAD\n\nll\n\ntreated very seriously — capturing your dignity for posterity — which is why they all look so severe. They were just being normal. Then, of course, life was very different. No world war had yet been fought or imagined, no plane had ever flown, no man had ever travelled at the speed your saloon car will do effortlessly today. The west was a place of monarchies, rigid social strata and imperial certainties. Britain, made vastly wealthy by the Industrial Revolution, ruled the largest empire the world had ever seen and kept it in order with the largest navy. France had an extensive African empire and designs on being a global presence. And so it went. There was huge disparity between rich and poor, and by definition only the wealthy could buy cars. Racing would cost more again. En route to Rouen the 21 race entrants halted at the small town of Mantes, just short of halfway, and reports suggest that the townspeople enjoyed seeing the cars as much as the drivers enjoyed having their lunch there. The diners could certainly afford the price if they could afford a car. The first of 19 who reached Rouen was a Count driving a steam tractor which could carry six people, and it received no award because of that. It took 6 hours 48 minutes, averaging 11mph and keeping Peugeots in second and third places. All the vehicles had solid wheels. Michelin were the first to produce a practical rubber tyre for cars, in 1895, the year proper racing began, and a matrix was forged by necessity. Since there were no circuits, public roads had to be used with towns as markers. The first race ran from Paris to Bordeaux and back, 745 miles, and was won at an average speed of 14.9mph. That year, Italian and American racing began and the\n\nAutomobile Club de France was formed. The town-to-town matrix lasted until 1903. There would be twelve of these races, including Paris—Marseilles—Paris, in 1896. In October that year a certain Hon Charles Rolls journeyed to Paris to buy a Peugeot, which became Cambridge’s first car. A Paris—Amsterdam—Paris race was staged in 1898. ‘Manufacturers were already producing cars specifically for racing while drivers’ names were becoming familiar and almost professional.” a There was René de Knyff, a Belgian racing for France. He had flowing beard and habitually wore a yachting cap. father There was another Belgian, red-bearded Camille Jenatzy, whose won Jenatzy . had built the first factory making rubber in Belgium obtained his bicycle races but was also ‘of a studious nature and when he thought)’.’ he as (forever sport degree as a civil engineer he abandoned Paris to get into He wasn’t happy in the family business and moved to\n\n12\n\nGRAND PRIX CENTURY\n\nmotoring. He’d thought electric cars were the way to go and started making them... In February 1898, a snowstorm paralysed the town of Modena on the plain outside Bologna. The snow was so deep that for two days a petit bourgeois merchant and landowner® could not reach the town hall to record the birth of his second son. The family surname was extremely common in the area, and when the boy was registered as Enzo Anselmo Ferrari, he took his place among the hundreds of other unremarkable, anonymous Ferraris. Yes, while Grand Prix racing was not yet into its birth pangs, here was its future. That December, a Count with a name like a line of poetry — Gaston de Chasseloup-Laubat, younger brother of the man who founded the Automobile Club de France (the ACF) — took his chain-driven 40horsepower electric car to a village road — Achéres — outside Paris and did 39.2mph to claim the World Land Speed Record over a flying kilometre. This had a profound effect on Jenatzy who laid down a challenge for 1899. In January he and Chasseloup-Laubat met on the same road and Jenatzy pushed the record to 41mph. Chasseloup-Laubat responded with 43mph, and the possibilities which direct competition could, and did, create were being revealed moment by moment. It was more than that. It showed, seven decades before the rarefied, specialised craft — an aeroplane on land — pushed the record to 600mph that speeds could be increased in attainable increments. Each land speed record was also a way of saying to the motor racers: You can go faster, too. Chasseloup-Laubat and Jenatzy agreed to do it again and went off to build bigger engines.’ Jenatzy pushed it to 49mph and this was attracting so much attention the ACF drew up rules and sent officials along to supervise. Chasseloup-Laubat pushed it to 57mph, Jenatzy through the 100kmh barrier (62mph). The increasing speed was reflected in the May 1899 Paris~Bordeaux race where the winner averaged 29mph. A month later a company called Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino was founded, but you know it by its initials, FIAT, later styled Fiat. That year, Daimler’s agent in France, Emil J ellinek —who was also the dashing Austro-Hungarian consul in Nice — entered a Daimler in the 1899 Nice Speed Week. He understood the value of publicity. He raced the car under a pseudonym, using the Christian name of his nine-yearold daughter, Mercedes. Newspaper tycoon Bennett thought the French were monopolising motor racing and decided to break that; and whatever Bennett wanted Bennett got. His father had founded the New York Herald, and that\n\nDUSTY ROAD\n\n13\n\nhelped. Tall, handsome, he'd always got a lot of women. Once, for a bet, he drove a coach from Rhode Island to New York’s Central Park, naked. He started, and won, the first trans-Atlantic yacht race. His engagement to a ‘prominent Baltimore socialite’ was terminated when he came to her New Year’s party drunk and ‘relieved himself in the grand piano.’ Hence his exile in Paris.* Now he’d get a motor race, an annual event of at least 550 kilometres (340 miles) between national teams chosen by their governing bodies; teams a maximum of three cars. The French were so strong that they held a ballot to pick theirs and it produced ‘much bickering’.’ The first of these races, known as the Gordon Bennett Trophy, was from Paris to Lyon in June 1900, with seven entries. De Knyff had a Panhard” and Jenatzy a Snoek-Bolide.\"” Karl Benz’s son Eugen drove, naturally, a Benz while two American entries were elderly single-cylinder cars called Wintons. Jenatzy retired after hitting a lot of small animals presumably dogs, cats, chickens and rabbits — along the route. One driver ran full into a St Bernard, jammed the steering, swerved across a ditch and went between two trees into a field. Here was foreboding. Rising speed, the long and rough open roads, villages and towns — unpoliced and unpoliceable — were by definition potentially lethal and one must assume villagers had no experience of estimating speed, never having seen it before. In a race a month later, one car struck a cart and in another race a car struck a cow. In a race the year after, one car collided with a tram and another killed a boy standing in the middle of the road. A rhythm of progress had been established. In 1902 the Land Speed Record was pushed to 75mph before another very rich American, William K. Vanderbilt, beat that and by year’s end it stood at 77mph. In 1903, it would be beaten four times, once by Charles Rolls. The foreboding deepened. Despite French Government reservations, the ACF organised a race from Paris to Madrid. It attracted 230 ‘very fast and sometimes dangerously flimsy cars’? which started from Versailles at intervals from 4am. As they thundered off into the dawn, they were\n\nabout to kill road racing. A tremendous duel developed between two Frenchmen, Fernand Gabriel and Marcel Renault, but Renault’s car overturned, killing him; a riding mechanic died when a car hit a tree so hard that it broke up and parts were embedded in the tree itself; a mechanic died when a car hit a wall; a car veered into a crowd, killing the mechanic and a soldier. The Spanish and French governments moved to stop the whole thing so and did when it reached Bordeaux. The French Government was\n\n14\n\nGRAND PRIX CENTURY\n\nnervous it ordered the cars to be hauled back to Paris by horses or on horse-drawn vehicles — a savage irony — but this proved unworkable and they were allowed to drive slowly. Even then one car struck a woman, injuring her. There would be no more town-to-town races. The Bennett Trophy remained, and it assumed central importance. In 1904, a third very rich American, Henry Ford, pushed the Land Speed Record to 9l1mph over the flying mile on frozen Lake St Clair, Michigan and others would push it through the 100. That same year the Hon Rolls was introduced to a Mr Royce in a London hotel. The 1905 Bennett Trophy was run in the Auvergne region of France, the year the Land Speed Record reached 108mph. The Auvergne was preceded by an eliminating race and during it a Briton, Maurice Farman (sometimes referred to as Henry) missed a turn in his Panhard. He... found himself engaged in a short cut through the woods\n\nto the valley\n\nbelow. The two men [Farman and his riding mechanic] were thrown out, caught in the branches of the trees and held there while the car leapt along its wildly destructive path. Report has it that Farman, caught on a higher branch than his mechanic, pulled out his cigarette case and, looking down,\n\nquietly remarked: ‘I wish you would pass me a match up, Tom.’®\n\nAs it seems, in this eliminator or the race itself, a US entry struck trouble and American manufacturers... were rather raw at the racing game in those days. [The car] broke its main oil feed pipe and had no facilities for repairing it. The men were of that rough Western type that never knows defeat. The mechanic sat on the frame of the machine, his legs dangling over, and with a can poured directly into the crankcase [but] more went on the outside than the in.\n\nThey finished but as they stepped off the car oil was dripping from them in such quantities that [when] champagne was offered to them they could not hold the glass, they could not put it to their lips until some of the oil had been wiped away with a rag.\"*\n\nPerhaps this is how a certain class of people saw themselves and their world, and how they wrote about it. Whatever, Rolls finished eighth in a Wolseley. Two months later, Tazio Nuvolari’s uncle Giuseppe took him to Brescia to watch a three-lap event with the leading manufacturers and drivers, including wild Victor Hémery, Vincenzo Lancia and Felice N azzaro, clean shaven, a particularly studious-looking man. For anyone from solid,\n\nDUSTY ROAD\n\n15\n\nsleepy, virtually silent Castel d’Ario” it had to be intoxicating, 22 racing cars covering 500 kilometres and averaging a hundred kilometres an hour. Nuvolari had touched the passion which would ignite and rule the rest of his life. The Bennett Trophy rules’ limit of three cars per country irked the French because, compared to the strength of their automobile industry, they resented Switzerland with a sole manufacturer having the same and resented Mercedes entering three each from their German and Austrian factories. The ACF found a solution. They’d organise their own race in 1906 under their own rules. They selected 64 miles of country roads outside the town of Le Mans as their circuit. To pacify the government they would make sure these roads were closed off and build extensive barriers to keep the spectators back from the cars. They’d make it a monumental event spread over two days, six laps a day, giving a total distance of 769 miles — more than double the length of any race before. They’d find the perfect name for it, too, not the Championship of France, not the Coupe-this or the Trophée-that. No. It would be known as the Great Prize in motorsport. Grand Prix racing was about to be born. The year started with a flurry of World Land Speed Records, one of them set by Louis Chevrolet at Daytona, climaxing at 117mph over the flying mile but, beyond that, it was a time of solid beginnings. On 5 May, three weeks before the French Grand Prix, a race called the Targa Florio, named for Vincenzo Florio who founded it, was run for the first time (and would continue until 1977). It represented a brutal test of man and machine: three laps totalling 277 miles of rugged Sicilian tracks and mountain roads which rose and fell, not to mention bandits and wolves. It attracted ten entries, including Lancia driving a Fiat and Alessandro Cagno who won it, in an Itala car. He’d make his mark, but\n\ndoing something else.” Maybe the Targa Florio was a staging post for Le Mans. Cagno took his Itala there while Florio himself (he hadn’t competed in Sicily) took a\n\nMercedes. Le Mans is a typical French provincial town surrounded by verdant countryside, languid straight roads and strung out stone villages. The circuit did not touch on the town and that gave it a pastoral, almost rustic feel. The cars had a maximum weight of 1,000kg [2,204]b]. The Grand Prix attracted 34 entries, but only from France (25), Italy and Germany. The British were not tempted because they felt the French\n\n16\n\nGRAND PRIX CENTURY\n\nwere using it to demonstrate their superiority and, even if the British did win, the French would claim they had lost it by accident. The ACF was so determined to make the race a success it spent a considerable amount on the circuit although not nearly enough on its surface. (The expenditure was regained by grants from the town and hotel owners plus the entry fees.) Mindful of the Paris—Madrid fiasco... the towns are barricaded from end to end; villages are fenced, also there is not a single house, or cottage, or road, or lane, or footpath without\n\nits\n\npalisade. The total length of this palisading is 65,000 metres, or 40 miles. The tribunes — grandstands, the time-keeper’s box, the telegraph boards etc — are situated at Montfort, about 20 kilometres from Le Mans [...] On the opposite side of the course a whole length of the frontage is given up to the firms competing in the race, so that they may be able to re-victual their cars.’”\n\nThe circuit formed a triangle, another matrix, because every French Grand Prix to 1914 and on into the 1920s would follow that basic shape. This one began on the main road outside Montfort, a little town, and went towards Le Mans then turned sharp left ‘at so short a radius that any car travelling at 30 miles an hour must run off.’* That was on to the first full length of the triangle: it flowed in a straight line to a village and the other side of that in a straight line towards the town of St Calais, but the road was so bad there that the local council agreed to build a by-pass of roughly laid planking in a field. That was on to the second leg of the triangle: it turned north towards the town of Vibraye but before it got there it veered into the forest, and more rough planking, in a tight dog-leg. It flowed north again to the town of La Ferté Bernard, and turned hard-hard left. That was on to the third leg of the triangle: it flowed south but the road wriggled and bucked and twisted. One of the wriggles was through the town of Connerré where the road became a gully between the palisades with two corners, a right, a left. Montfort was shortly after Connerré. These were 1906 roads, more like flattened, dusty tracks and dust meant you couldn’t see where you were going. In an effort to beat this, the ACF treated the whole length with tar; and the cars’ exhaust pipes had to be angled upwards so dust wasn’t blown about, but the corners cut up so badly during practice that they had to be rolled and more tar was laid to try to seal them. This had agonising consequences and forced at least one driver to retire from the race because he couldn’t bear any more pain. Thereby hangs a tale of what wasn’t.\n\nDUSTY ROAD\n\n17\n\nLong before, a Scot called John McAdam had worked out that if you raised the bed of a road and put drainage underneath, then covered it in small stones, the traffic would compact it until it was strong and smooth. Another pioneer used water stirred into stone dust — cement — to fill gaps between the stones. Later, a binding based on bitumen was laid on that: tarmacadam. The very first road made with this was in Paris in 1854, but clearly the technique had not reached Le Mans’s countryside, 52 years later. Instead, the roads guaranteed a plague of punctures. Three companies — Michelin, Dunlop and Continental — supplied tyres, another matrix: deploying innovation to gain an advantage. A puncture took about 15 minutes to repair because the tyre had to be levered off the rim and a new one levered on. Michelin produced a detachable rim, complete with tyre. The driver and mechanic undid eight nuts, lifted it off, lifted a new one into place and did the eight nuts up again. It took two minutes, but it came with its own penalty because each detachable wheel weighed 9kg, a real consideration with the car’s maximum at 1,000kg. The Fiats carried four, other teams two, but some couldn’t afford the extra weight at all. It would bring them constant back-breaking labour and cost them any chance in the race. The cars were scrutineered and weighed inside a tall, broad tent in a field beside the track. As each car came, a crowd gathered to watch, and it was a crowd of its time, almost exclusively male, wearing suits, waistcoats, white panama hats, caps or boaters. Nobody was bare-headed. Some carried canes and used them to point to any interesting aspects of the cars. A woman in elegant white held the brim of her be-ribboned matching white hat in case it blew away. They all moved in a genteel, unhurried way, stopping to talk. The grass looked parched — and dusty. Mechanics in dirty overalls pushed the cars on to the weighbridge in the tent, pushed them away again. The cars were squat and shaped like small railway engines, the driver and his mechanic sitting high up as if perched, unprotected, behind the engines. They favoured woollen or leather hats, or balaclavas. They all wore goggles. The main grandstand, which held 2,000, spread along one side of the track and — in cream and gold, with an intricate canopy above it — looked like something from a fairground. Banners advertising Michelin ran along its frontage, hip high. This faced the ‘pits’ on the other side, a basic, stone-strewn working area inside the palisade with a counter on which the fuel churns and oil cans could be put. The race was scheduled for a Tuesday. On the Sunday, people from all over France had begun to gather and...\n\n18\n\nGRAND PRIX CENTURY\n\nLe Mans was en féte. Firework displays, running with bulls, banquets, singing and disturbances of the peace, nothing was missing. You got to bed late.”\n\nThe night before... cars arrived ceaselessly, always coming in to the Place de la Republique {the main square] which swarmed with curious people, some grouped in front\n\nof the Stock Exchange’s blazing windows where the ACF was holding a gala whose programme alternated between dancing and theatre. The café terraces overflowed. People bumped into each other, and bumped into each other again. The evening closed with the sensational arrival of a steamdriven omnibus\n\nwhich, leaving Paris in the morning, had energetically\n\ndevoured the 207 kilometres without stopping.”\n\nThe cafés remained open until 4am, by which time the spectators needed to be on the move to reach the circuit. The roads would be closed at 5am so the race could start at the scheduled 6am. (The Motor’s correspondent stayed at a little inn, woke at 3.30 and was given ‘coffee and the curious soapy sort of bread one gets in such a place.’) Rain, likely to be heavy, had been feared, but the dawn broke blue and pure and clear, the sun burning off a little low-lying mist. By 4am a tide of vehicles and bicycles flowed towards the circuit and so many people tried to get on a train to a stop on the circuit that it appeared to be under assault. At the circuit... among the hordes of cyclists and cars covered in dust, under the shade of the trees, in the fields, or in homemade tents held up by haphazard staves and draped by canvas or sheets, sat vast tables of drinkers, their ruddy faces happy, content.”\n\nSoldiers cleared spectators off the course and tried to clear the journalists off it, too, but after ‘heated discussion’ the journalists stayed. A man in a white boater and white overalls placed a tub of paint on the road and, using a long brush, set down the start-finish line with careful strokes, his back bowed. The cars were driven from the field acting as a parc fermé into a passageway leading to the track and called one by one to the start, a white line across the road in front of the crowded grandstand. They halted there, waiting for the command to go. They were sent off at 90second intervals and alternately, one car going from the left-hand side of the track, the next one already moving up to the line on the right. When\n\nDUusTy ROAD\n\n19\n\nthat went, the next car on the left would have come up and be in place. The grid, this first grid, was already as it would somehow always be, a mingling of cars, mechanics, officials, bystanders, officials with\n\narmbands and who knew who else? A flat-faced Lorraine-Dietrich car,” its bonnet sloping to either side like a rooftop, its radiator painted with the race number 1A,” its driver and mechanic sitting far back over the rear axle and so high up they might have been enthroned, chugged up to the line, slowed, and stopped. At ground level in the grandstand, perhaps ten feet away, a clutch of women spectators, all in white with their matching white hats, watched. The sea of men all around them, still be-suited and be-hatted — an almost impossible formality in the open on a summer’s day — watched, too. You could feel the intensity in their eyes. A knot of officials stood on the road beside 1A. The next starter, the Fiat of Vincenzo Lancia numbered 2A, must have been chugging up at that moment or perhaps it, too, had stopped and the two cars stood shoulder-to-shoulder, the drivers gazing down the long road ahead. There is no precision about these moments before it all began, no precise countdown, no photographic record. One of the officials held up a board illustrating what the flags round the circuit meant: Blue = beware Yellow = stop\n\nThe poignancy of the very final moment is that nobody knew because nobody could know, not least the devil-may-care Frenchman Fernand Gabriel who, at 25, was good enough to have survived the carnage on the 1903 Paris—Madrid killer — and been first to Bordeaux, winning it; nobody knew, as the official gave the signal and the Lorraine-Dietrich lurched forward creating a dust-storm behind, what had just been set in motion. Nobody can conceivably have imagined, either, as the LorraineDietrich crossed the line and accelerated away, its narrow tyres rutting the dry earth, the immensity of the future. Or even of the men who would be drawn into it, Nuvolari no doubt preparing to go to school in Castel d’Ario at this moment, Bernd Rosemeyer of mythical eyesight who'd be born in a little north German town three years on, JuanManuel Fangio who’d be born in an Argentinian town near the Atlantic five years on...or, two world wars later, that an Englishman called Stirling Moss would heat the blood, a quiet Scotsman called Jim Clark would redefine speed and simplicity, a rich Brazilian kid called Ayrton Senna would be touched by grace, another German from a small town,\n\n20\n\nGRAND PRIX CENTURY\n\nMichael Schumacher, would reshape and rewrite everything... There were already celebrated, heroic figures preparing to come forward to the white line. It was 6am — there is precision about this — on Tuesday, 26 June 1906. The driver of car 1A, Fernand Gabriel,* had been winning races since 1899 and it was he who had been in the lethal duel with Marcel Renault. He had a long-term contract with the LorraineDietrich team and came to Le Mans as their leading driver. Now, as he headed down towards the turn into the first full leg of the triangle, he was the pathfinder and all others in Grand Prix history his followers. Gabriel had gone at 06.00.00. Now decorously, while a sombre bearded official in dark hat and clothes noted the times, the others were waved on their way. Cars coughed and churned, their fumes wreathing the grid and making the people there suddenly ghostly, and then, like clouds, drifting towards the grandstand. 06.01:30: Vincenzo Lancia set off in a Fiat. He was from a small Piedmont village and his father had made money canning soup in Argentina. Young Vincenzo had an aptitude for numbers but machinery fascinated him, and the fascination lead all the way to here. He was 25. 06.03:00: Francois (Ferenc) Szisz set off in a Renault 90. He was from a large Hungarian family and his father practised faith healing. He’d been trained as a mechanic and to pursue that he went to Munich then Paris to join Renault and it had brought him all the way here. A shortish, strong man he had chiselled, swarthy features. He was 33. The Renault had a sloping, aerodynamic bonnet which made it look unlike all the other cars. At the signal, Szisz corrected the front wheels, so they made a short jerking motion to be pointing straight ahead. It set off slowly, needing time and distance to gather pace. A small knot of people standing behind the white line gazed wistfully as it receded.\n\n06:04.30: Hemery set off in a Darracg. He was a tempestuous, turbulent man and the year before had reportedly been banned from racing in Italy after he'd ‘insulted his Italian rivals, snubbed the British and dismissed the Americans as mechanical peasants, unworthy of consideration.”* One time in America he aimed his powerful Darracq at a fellow competitor, and was disqualified.\n\n06:06:00: Paul Baras set off in a Brasier..He’d been a ‘tricycle champion and brilliantly fast with cumbersome cars.’ More than that, he’d twice held the World Land Speed Record in 1904.7\n\nDUSTY ROAD\n\n21\n\n06:07:30: Jenatzy set off in a Mercedes. He was known as the ‘Red Devil’. An engineer by training, he adored speed, as he had proved on the road to Achéres. He was 38. He was followed away by Louis Rigolly (Gobron-Brille).\n\n06.10:30: Alessandro (Jacopo) Cagno set off in an Itala. He was a thinfaced, clean-shaven adventurer who had begun racing in 1902 and had come here from the Targa Florio. He was 23.\n\nNinety seconds later, George Heath, a Franco-American, set off in a Panhard-Levassor and so it went; Albert Clément in a Clément-Bayard at 06.18:00, Henri Rougier in a Lorraine-Dietrich at 06:19.30. 06:21.00:\n\nNazzaro\n\nset off in a Fiat. He was\n\nthe son of a Turin coal\n\nmerchant and had started in the motor trade with a small company as errand\n\nboy, mechanic,\n\naristocratic in manner’\n\ncleaner,\n\napprentice\n\nhe introduced\n\nat 15.” ‘Tall, quiet, almost\n\nthe gentleman’s\n\nway of driving,\n\nchanging gears silently and treating his cars with respect.\n\nThese were the fast men — although that didn’t prevent Nazzaro stalling, gentleman’s style or not. The car was restarted without outside help, which would have disqualified him. As they went, sometimes drivers saluted their mechanics or the crowd; some hunched forward and held the steering wheel tight, others sat rigid. From a distance, the symmetry of the cars was mostly similar. The spectators, often in little groups behind the palisades or the solid barricades in the towns, saw the cars bounding and bouncing, and sometimes they slithered. The drivers looked as heroic as knights in armour had once done, galloping through. Trains had broadened the ordinary person’s conception of speed but this cavalcade was coming round the corner into your main street at, to take the average of the fastest lap, 73.3mph. A primed racehorse will do barely half that and then only for a short time. The racing car, experienced in all its sound and fury, and from such close quarters, must have had a stunning impact all round the circuit. It still does. At one point, behind a tall palisade in a town, a group of nuns watched, captivated. The crowds were in the country as well as the towns, standing at corners beneath tall trees while the cars fought their way round the\n\nbends, each trailing a plume of dust. Gabriel got as far as St Calais when a mechanical failure made the car swerve ‘violently in all directions, each swerve being checked by the\n\n22\n\nGRAND PRIX CENTURY\n\ndriver ...it may have saved the lives of both in the car.”° Gabriel was out of the race. A rough ride. On this first lap, one car ran off the planking at St Calais, bending a wheel. The car ran into a bank of loose earth built up against a palisade, burying its right rear wheel. While driver and mechanic struggled to repair it — that would take three hours, so they completed the first lap in just under 4 hours 20 minutes — an official positioned himself in the road and stood, hands behind his back, monitoring what was going on. Three cars retired: engine failure, damaged radiator and a crash where the car overturned having taken a corner too fast. It was torn to pieces. Szisz, with the advantage of two detachable rear wheels, moved into the lead on lap three of the six and would not lose it. The tar was worse than the dust. It melted in the heat, got behind the goggles and burnished the eyes. One Renault driver had broken goggles and on that lap and asked for them to be replaced but this was refused — it could only be done for the second day. This was Edmond (initial J. — his first name does not seem to have survived) who pitted with his eyes swollen by the tar, and burning. Another driver offered to take his place, got in and was moving away when Louis Renault flagged it down by making big gestures. Renault knew the rules: you couldn’t change a driver during the day. Edmond got back in and set off to a ‘thunder of bravos’ from the crowd. He slogged on but the pain overwhelmed him and he stopped briefly to recover, continued to the end of lap five when, his eyes on fire, he couldn’t see the road any more and retired. Louis Renault, dapper in straw boater, waistcoat and suit, led him gently away, a cloth draped over his head to keep the sunlight from his eyes. Renault was everywhere, talking to officials, supervising the pit work. Another driver was so exhausted his car got away from him at the Vibraye planking and he crashed. The exhaustion was partly the heat of the day, partly the incessant and laborious tyre changing — they were lasting only a lap or two — and partly because of the drivers’ and mechanics’ eyes. The roof and rear of the main grandstand lacked ventilation, and when the temperature reached 120°F it was so hot inside that 60 people had to be treated for sunstroke. Spectators, too, had inflamed eyes from the dust the passing cars churned up. It had been a long morning and now, completing the six laps the crowd would know who led at halfdistance...\n\nDUSTY ROAD\n\n23\n\nIt was a quarter to twelve when, everyone being on the alert for the arrival\n\nof Szisz, a bugle call was heard in the distance, and as a car came over the brow of a hill a mile away, powerful binoculars\n\nshowed that it was a\n\nRenault. At once a great yellow flag was held out, and amid a yell of delight Szisz roared past. [...] An official boarded the car when it stopped, and then it returned along the course between lines of cheering spectators to the enclosure, and there the car was run under the tent and barricaded round, not to be touched until next morning.”\n\nSzisz said that from start to finish he hadn’t had a moment’s anxiety over anything mechanical. ‘Once I got into the lead I didn’t push. I only changed tyres every couple of laps as a precaution. Monsieur Renault told me to lap at 58 minutes. Now, I averaged 57 and a half minutes. That tells you what a pleasure it was to drive such a car.’ When he came from his car, goggles up on his head, a well-wisher gripped his hand and shook it. Szisz looked at that moment like a warrior. Seventeen cars survived this first day, with two and a half hours between the first of them, Szisz, and the last, a Lorraine-Dietrich. The leaderboard: SZiSZ\n\n5h 45m 30.4s\n\nClément\n\n6h 11m 40.6s\n\nNazzaro\n\n6h 26m 53.0s\n\nThe retirements included Hubert le Blon, whose wire wheels gave way on the planking at Vibraye, and Henri Tart, while ‘replenishing his Panhard, was asked to look at the dumb iron” carrying the front spring. He looked, and found it broken, and, just like a Frenchman, he at once threw up his hands and commenced to sob.’” Jenatzy and Lancia said they couldn’t face another day like it. Other drivers ‘smothered their ravaged faces with ointments and had their eyes treated by a doctor.™ Lancia’s eyes were ‘fearfully enflamed’ and Jenatzy told The Motor’s correspondent he ‘had never suffered such agony before. Goggles were no protection. The face became smothered with tarry emanations, and the vapour from this passed under the goggles and then set up inflammation of the pupil and cornea of the eyes.’ Like Szisz’s Renault,\n\nthe cars were taken to the parc fermé — some pushed by half a dozen men — to be guarded overnight and, as a further security precaution, the area was floodlit. Nobody was going to do any tampering, even with their own cars.\n\n24\n\nGRAND PRIX CENTURY\n\nAn ingenious method had been put in place for the second day’s starting order. Cars were sent off at the time they’d done on the first day, so Szisz went first at 5.45am, Clément at 6.11, Nazzaro at 6.26 and so on down to the slowest, that Lorraine-Dietrich, at 8.15am. This meant their positions on the road were their actual positions, no adding and subtracting necessary... The cars were towed out of the ‘park’ by a horse” and brought to the starting line (and it was typical of the thoroughness with which the race details were carried out that yesterday afternoon the horse was continually\n\npractised in hauling a car out to the line, the engine being at once started, so as to accustom the horse to the noise, in case it should be on the line when the engine of a racing car was started this morning.*\n\nThe animal, white and clearly a carthorse, had a harness which trailed back to the front axle of the cars. One man guided the horse — the cars seemed to be of no great weight for it —- while another walked alongside the car steering it. Szisz and his mechanic did not mount their Renault, but on the order to ‘Go!’ pushed it across to their pit, refuelled it and changed two wheels. This needed 11% minutes and when it was done they set off to a tremendous cheer. Other competitors would do the same... A glance at the colossal\n\ngrandstands showed them to be admirable, ravishing, built with so much taste. In the middle of a desert of sand and pine trees, under the blinding light of a ferocious sun, one saw — in the ‘dress circle,’ among the dyes of the white drapes, orange drapes and garlands of flowers — a dazzling bevy of deliciously pretty women, adorned in white, pink and blue. An incomparable ensemble of gaiety, radiance...”\n\nThe race had attracted celebrities and important people, another matrix: the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg, the Duke of Parma, barons and marquises, the Minister of Public Work, several generals and the occasional viscount. Lancia was due to go at 7.12 and this produced a moving scene. On the line his mechanic had cranked the engine into life, Lancia engaged the clutch and started. The mechanic didn’t have time to get out of the way, grabbed hold of the bonnet and Lancia drove him the 200 yards to their pit. ‘What anxiety! We thought the valiant boy had had it. He laughed .’* Meanwhile...\n\nDUSTY ROAD\n\n25\n\nShepard, who is an American and a cousin of the Vanderbilts, had made a good impression [...] and it was rather a pity that he should have had to\n\nspend half an hour in revictualling and tyre changing\n\nthis morning.\n\nHémery spent an hour in replacing defective inlet valves, and he earned the sympathy of the crowd over his many unavailing efforts to get the engine started, and went away with it missing rather badly.”\n\nThis was Elliot Shepard and before the race he had worn a cowboy hat. He was driving a Hotchkiss, a barrel-shaped car with wire wheels which set off in a great cloud of smoke and dust. Jenatzy really couldn’t face this second day and handed over to a giant of a man with a pseudonym, ‘Burton’, although he appears in The Motor as Alex Burton. Vincenzo Lancia had intended to hand the FIAT over to his reserve driver, but he wasn’t around. Lancia had no time to go and change, and started in his ordinary clothes. On the first lap a Panhard swerved so hard at a right-hander that the steering wheel was plucked from the driver’s hand, the car lurched off the road into a gutter and overturned. It struck a tree, breaking the driver’s leg. Szisz completed the lap with eleven cars still waiting to go, and even the lap after that there were still four. The corners had suffered a fearful pounding on the first day and were now strewn with stones and pebbles, the cars trying to navigate through. The punctures kept coming. Clément had one in a tight right-hander out in the country, the car slewing towards the edge of the track, a dust shroud pursuing it. Clément fought it, held it, straightened it, slowed it — then, with practised speed, he and the mechanic were out starting their work, lifting the spare from just behind their seats. Two gendarmes with obligatory moustaches came up to watch. The planking at St Calais kept bringing problems, too. At one point an official signalled frantically to Shepard: Slow! Corner! waving his left arm up and down. Shepard didn’t take the corner but went straight on down the road ahead, missing the turn for the banking completely. He vanished in a cloud of exhaust fumes, stopped, reversed in another cloud of fumes, drove on to the planking and stopped. He readied himself and proceeded, the car belching fumes like an industrial chimney. He didn’t get far: a wire wheel failed, the car gouging into a bank beside a leafless\n\nsapling. He was out. Szisz had held such a substantial lead that he only had to keep going of to win and as he drove he raised a hand to acknowledge the cheering FIAT s Nazzaro’ between ed the crowd. Behind him, a lively battle develop\n\n26\n\nGRAND PRIX CENTURY\n\nand Clément’s Clément-Bayard. Szisz did keep going. On lap nine Nazzaro got past Clément and the order stayed like that. Szisz slowed to protect the car. He’d do his slowest lap of the race by three minutes, but that didn’t matter any more. Finishing did. He sawed the big steering wheel round a last time on to the straight towards the pits and the grandstand. He moved towards the white line beside the time-Keeper’s hut and an official with a black flag, standing poised, dipped it as he passed. He had covered the twelve laps across the two days in 12 hours 14 minutes and 7 seconds, an average speed of 62.8mph. The crowd raised their hats high to him, some raised their arms and the ladies applauded politely. Fernard Gabriel had been the first Grand Prix driver, Francois Szisz was now the first winner. Nuvolari and Rosemeyer, Fangio and Moss, Clark and Senna and Schumacher, were all his followers, too. ‘The last lap was for me — despite the confidence I had in the car — a great anxiety,’ he said. ‘I feared something small which would take victory away at the moment when it had seemed to be won. Little by little, having gone through Saint-Calais, and Vibraye I came to Connerré. I drove carefully to avoid any problems and at last when we got to BelleInutile [just before the finish] my mechanic, who was so anxious he hadn’t said a word all the lap, suddenly clapped me on the back. “Bravo, that’s it!” Nazzaro came in at 12h 46m 26.4s, Clément more than three minutes behind... Albert Clément is a general favourite, and his father Adolphe Clément is one of those cheerful, short bearded men with no ‘side,’ always courteous and universally liked. When Clément fils was called up to be received by the Minister of Commerce he waited for his father to come along as he would not accept the honour or congratulations without him.”\n\nWhen the race was done, Renault stood before one of the senior officials, the Minister of Transport, with his straw hat down over his face so that no-one would see his copious tears. In this moment of personal solitude, no doubt, he savoured the triumph and thought of his brother.*! One reflection was that, as a replacement for the Gordon Bennett races, the Grand Prix had left a great deal to be desired, and it had been decided by tyre choice, to use a modern idiom. Szisz changed 19 times while at least one car changed 14 times on this second day alone — but Szisz had the detachable wheels. The race had clearly been too long and, because of the nature of the circuit, no dicing seen, just lonely cars\n\nDUSTY ROAD\n\nOT,\n\ncoming by and, at the end, only eleven of them. Szisz finished at midday, the last at 4.30pm. Despite everything the race served its purpose. The matrix had been forged and it could be adapted to make it better and better. Le Figaro’s reporter caught a mood after Szisz came in... One o’clock. Enthusiasm falls away, the stomachs speak, you rush to the buffets, for a small fortune you grab the exquisite champagne of G. H. Mumm\n\nto go with skinny little chicken, dusty slivers of ham which crunch\n\nin your teeth, warm drinks, stale bread and cheese, seasoned by the calls of those vending it.\n\nThe French Grand Prix was now poised to become, with the American Grand Prix, the core of motor racing. Up to the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, the French would be run six times and the American five. There were no other Grands Prix. Of course there had been nationalism, as there always would be. That, too, seems very basic to human beings. However, ‘over the years it is the magnificent machines and heroic drivers who have stirred the blood rather than the country that either have happened to originate from. In November that year a poor blacksmith who also repaired bicycles in the small town of Komyo outside Tokyo had a son. Some miles away was a mill with a petrol-powered engine and the little lad used to be taken there by his grandfather so he could watch the engine working. It\n\ncaptivated him. He was called Soichiro Honda. The ACF decided that their 1907 Grand Prix should be near the Channel port of Dieppe (perhaps to attract British entries), although it might have gone to Fontainebleau, the elegant and regal town south of Paris; but either way here was another matrix and the second staging post on the race’s long journey through the years. Uniquely the ACF, in what seems to have been an enduring spirit of egalitarianism and accessibility, would take the race to many staging posts all over France — a total of 16 up to Magny-Cours in the present day. Although the 1908 and 1912 races were also at Dieppe, by 2005 they had also been run at Amiens, Lyon, Strasbourg, Tours, the banked Montlhéry circuit near Paris, Miramas, Cominges, Pau, Reims, Rouen, Clermont-Ferrand, Dijon, Paul Ricard and Magny-Cours. The people would come to the races, and\n\nthe races would go to the people. Dieppe in 1907 was significantly shorter than Le Mans, ten laps of 47 miles each against twelve laps of 64 miles, a total difference of almost 300 miles. That allowed adaptation, the race run on one day. The circuit\n\n28\n\nGRAND PRIX CENTURY\n\nwas surprisingly similar to Le Mans in shape and feel, although several temporary bridges had been built. Palisades were erected in the towns and the whole circuit laid with tar again. First aid posts were connected to a telephone system; and to guard it all on race day the ACF had 700 policemen and 4,500 soldiers on hand. Each car was allowed 231 litres of fuel, replacing the limit on the weight of the cars, and manufacturers could again enter three cars. That produced 24 French cars while six other countries entered 14, including Weigel® from Britain and the front-wheel drive Christie from the United States, the first time a car like that had ever raced in Europe. Once Dieppe had been chosen several manufacturers went there to carry out trials, especially for fuel consumption on sections where they felt their rivals couldn’t see them. The roads were not, of course, closed and the trials became very dangerous. Clément crashed outside a little village and was killed, a Darracq driver hit a cart and was killed. The outcry in the French Press was so intense that for a time the race came into question. They’d race. At scrutineering the day before, the fuel tanks were ‘filled from the elaborate official apparatus and the balance of the fuel allowance was fed into cans, each of which was sealed and numbered. Cars and cans were then locked in individual wire pens for the night and placed under military guard. It had rained, and many worried what they would do to the course if it lingered to the morrow. It didn’t. The organisation of a Grand Prix was being refined. The police set out 17 articles governing how the race would be run, crowd controlled, and who could go where. Article 7 described places where the cars had to slow — round corners, through villages — and these were signalled by streamers stretched over the road... Article 8. The signals will be 400 metres before the precise place where the slowing-down of the cars must be observed. The competitors must slow their speed to 40kmh. A bugler is to be positioned 200 metres before all built-up areas and will sound each approaching car.”\n\nThe race began at 6am again, but this time the cars went at 60-second intervals. To enable spectators to savour its scale special trains ran from Dieppe. Starting at 3.17 on race morning, there were eleven of them before 10.20, shuttling people up to Le Treport, a coastal town at the tip of the course and its neighbour Eu, where there was a hard, spectacular left-hander, the cars hugging it. The special trains also went across to the\n\nDUSTY ROAD\n\n29\n\ntown of Envermeu, halfway down the first leg of the triangle. Those who preferred to stay in the start-finish area were reminded by the local paper that ‘for the day of the Grand Prix, a popular terraced stand has been built. The entry is 2.0 francs and cold meals will be served at 3 francs 50.’ Many would watch the race in the countryside, strung out along tree-lined roads in small groups standing on the grass verges or bordering fields as the big beasts fled by just before them. As the cars left the parc fermé to make their way to the start over a pathway of duckboards, a band played. The start was laid with duckboards, too, and the crowd stretched away into the distance. A vast grandstand loomed and it was full of people. For the first time, pits had been dug at the side of the track so spares and tools could be stored there. Lancia in the FIAT was sent off at 06.01, Szisz in his Renault at 06.09, Nazzaro in his FIAT at 06.18, Gabriel in his Lorraine-Dietrich two minutes later. Because of the fuel limitation, cars did not start their engines until just before they were due to go and that caused problems with some cutting out as they crossed the line. The mechanics got to work with the crank handles immediately. Despite the tar, the road out in the country was so dusty the tracks each car’s tyres cut were clearly visible to the little groups who’d gathered to watch. There was a downhill left-right (the first Grand Prix chicane?) flanked by high earthen banks with the crowd on top. It imposed great demands on the driver and produced its own catalogue of incidents. Drivers could drift — or try to drift — their cars through, the back end hanging out, slewing back in — or they could misjudge it, as a Lorraine-Dietrich driver did, skittering across the right-hander into the bank and thumping that hard. Driver and mechanic had to get out and push it to safety while an official stood at the mouth of the chicane with two flags preparing to warn oncoming cars of the danger. Another car did come through and three women in long dresses and bonnets, to positioned to watch it enter the chicane, scampered along the banking wrong so mouth see it go through — or if it went through. Some got the One, a that they had to reverse. Some slithered on the edge of control. virtually in came car, Renault which may have been touched by another throwing sideways, whipped round and butted the banking, then rolled, anything driver and mechanic out. The next car was too close to do at the banking the except turn sharply away from the crash, towards\n\nother side. as it seems, One driver stopped by the wreck on the right and, then sped off, the enquired of the driver standing beside it, if he was OK, driver waving.\n\nGRAND PRIX CENTURY\n\n30\n\nLancia led but at half distance Arthur Duray (Lorraine-Dietrich) had got past him; Nazzaro third, Gabriel fourth and Szisz fifth — and all of them separated by under eight minutes. Duray and Lancia duelled and they could see each other. Lancia regained the lead on lap six, Duray retook a lap later, but now Nazzaro made his move. He overhauled Lancia on the time stagger — Nazzaro had started 17 minutes later — and Szisz, consistently fast, was making his move in the scoop-nosed Renault. Lap 7\n\nLap 8 |\n\nDuray\n\nDuray\n\nNazzaro\n\nNazzaro\n\nLancia\n\nSzisz\n\nSzisz\n\nLancia\n\nDuray’s gearbox failed, then Lancia’s FIAT misfired so that on lap nine, with one lap to go after it, Duray was gone, Lancia had fallen away and the race lay between Nazzaro and Szisz. At lap nine Nazzaro led by more than five and a half minutes but the start times had to be factored in to that, Szisz off at 6.09am that morning, Nazzaro at 6.18. It meant in the most simple, direct way that nine minutes had to be subtracted from Szisz’s 6h 13m 45s — making him 6h 4m 45s. On this last lap Szisz had to find almost three minutes and he couldn't. He did 39 minutes 25 seconds and crossed the line shortly after 1pm. He’d been driving for 6 hours 53 minutes and 10.6 seconds. He knew that if Nazzaro appeared within those nine minutes the race had been plucked from him. While Szisz was driving away Nazzaro’s red FIAT hoved into view as it crossed a low hill on the straight towards the finish. He crossed the line at 6 hours 46 minutes and 33 seconds, and he’d won it easily enough. For 1908, the race stayed at Dieppe but the rules changed, the minimum weight raised to 1,100kg and with engine restrictions to try to make it safer. It attracted a huge entry, 49, of which 48 started: as well as the usual FIATs, Renaults and Mercedes came three Austins, three Opels (one driven by Fritz von Opel), and three Benzs apart from the lovely, almost poetic, names of the era: Brasier, Porthos, Mors, Germain, Motobloc, Itala*” and Thomas. Jenatzy had of course driven a Mercedes at Dieppe in 1907 and waited to get his hands on one again now, but the company had selected a new generation of drivers. Mors had made a late entry of. three hastily assembled cars and Jenatzy asked for one of them.\n\nDUSTY ROAD\n\n31\n\nThe race was scheduled for 7 July and, because these were public roads, all practice banned for five weeks and a 15kmh speed limit rigorously enforced in case any competitor tried to (this caught the occasional tourist unawares). To get round the ban some teams practised on similar strips of road nearby and an Austin driver, Dario Resta, ran into trouble twice. Resta... who was born to drive but lacking in road experience, had a tendency to be\n\nreckless\n\nand was\n\ninvolved\n\nin two\n\ncrashes,\n\nwrecking\n\nhis car on both\n\noccasions. In the second he collided with a horse and cart ending up in a\n\nditch with the car on top of him. He and his mechanic, rescued\n\nfrom\n\nthis\n\ndangerous\n\nsituation\n\nthen\n\nbecame\n\nhaving been\n\ninvolved\n\nin an\n\naltercation with some locals who had come to the assistance of the driver of the cart. Finally, Resta was dragged off to prison and only released when\n\nhis friend Mr Fry, whose Mercedes he had driven at Brooklands, bailed him out in time for the weigh-in.”\n\nAn English enthusiast, Hall Watt, who had bought the 1906 winning Renault, was a non-competitor, but drove the course, crashed and died. On Sunday, 5 July the ACF ‘summoned drivers and mechanics to a lecture on the need to protect their faces.’ Some of these drivers were staying in tents in a field near the start and so were spectators. A whole\n\ntented village had arisen. On Monday 6 July there was a six-lap Voiturette” with 47 entries, and although the circuit’s roads had had extensive work done on them, the Voiturettes dug this up. On this race eve the local newspaper La Vigie De Dieppe wondered: speed will be reached? Nazzaro achieved an average speed of 113kmh last year and the fastest lap was covered by the same competitor in 38 minutes 16 seconds (120kmh). There are hopes of doing better this time and most of the drivers estimate that Nazzaro’s total time will be beaten by several minutes. They believe themselves capable of doing a lap and between 38 and 39 minutes and thus averaging between 115\n\nWhat\n\n120kmh.\n\nFor the Grand Prix some drivers wore only goggles and others ‘added the masks and helmets’, but these offered minimal protection against g patchin and clearing te flying stones. Although there had been ‘despera of numbers through Monday night’ of the damaged corners huge ahead. car the stones remained to be thrown back by\n\n32\n\nGRAND PRIX CENTURY\n\nOn a cold morning a bitter wind, strong enough to keep blowing Monsieur Renault’s straw hat off, raked the start at 6am. The start was given by a small cannon in grass beside the track. A nervous looking man in a dark suit borrowed a match and applied it —- and was enveloped in a pall of smoke. The cars were sent off at one-minute intervals and Szisz in the Renault was soon travelling fast, leaving plumes of dust behind him as he moved out on to the narrow ribbon of road which undulated through the countryside, turning and twisting through the towns. The duel was resumed: Nazzaro’s FIAT took the lead by lap two but now Christian Lautenschlager — a 31-year-old who had joined Daimler in 1899 as a mechanic, risen to foreman in the racing team by 1905 and was in his first major race — was threatening in his Mercedes. Lautenschlager, from near Stuttgart and of poor parents, had been apprenticed at 14 as a locksmith. He travelled as a journeyman, and when he was 22 returned to Stuttgart and trained as a mechanic. Old Daimler liked the young man and he became a works driver. As he tackled Nazzaro’s FIAT, he knew what he was about. And, as is the way of motor racing so infuriatingly often, duels are destroyed by circumstance. On that lap two, Szisz had to swerve to miss a car which had misjudged the sharp triangular fork outside Dieppe, and Szisz did this so violently that his car threw a tyre and rim. He went some way on the iron bonding underneath but damaged that so badly that he couldn’t fit another tyre. He limped to the Renault pit, spoke briefly, and retired. Some say the ‘man fairly broke down under the blow.” Nazzaro’s engine broke on the next lap. That left Lautenschlager clear. He drove calmly, shedding the squarejawed, youthful, determined Hémery (Benz), whose goggles had broken, but the circuit was full of perils. One car had to change tyres 19 times. Another suffered a puncture in a right-hand corner and the car twisted out of control, killing driver and mechanic. Mercedes actually ran out of tyres. Lautenschlager had stopped ten times for new tyres, once when his right-front was completely shredded. He negotiated the last two laps with great care, using the engine’s power whenever he judged the road surface safe, then picking a path through the damaged sections. He came in after 6 hours and 55 minutes to the consternation of the silent French. The band played the German national anthem, as it was obliged to do, but then moved immediately into the stirring French national rallying cry, the Marseillaise. Hémery came next, another Benz third, and by now the band had fallen silent, too. Lautenschlager, a short, stocky man wearin g a pullover, was escorted to the victory ceremony by an official in hat and armband\n\nDUSTY ROAD\n\n33\n\nwho gripped him by the arm to steer him there. The podium was entirely German and The Motor’s correspondent wrote: The French have created for themselves a kind of Frankenstein’s monster in motor racing. They have made of the mere winning of a race the essence of commercial success, and the natural corollary is that the losing of a race becomes a catastrophe. The horror, the chagrin and the humiliation of their defeat [...] filled the\n\ncup of the French to overflowing and, as a consequence, they lost their heads and took their beating very badly. In the paddock I saw notable Frenchmen\n\nlivid with rage, stamping about and showing their bitter resentment.\n\nIt had been an endurance test again, with 25 retirements, although reportedly Lautenschlager proved to be ‘exceedingly modest and free from self-consciousness. There was no posing, no straining after effect and one felt delighted to go up and congratulate’ him.” The endurance element was captured in a single paragraph: At the end of the race some drivers were in a parlous state. Flying stones had smashed the glass of some of the goggles, Hémery for one being in agony for a couple of laps through a spicule [small, sharp piece] of glass working into his eye. He had to stop and be attended to by a doctor before he could finish the race. Resta had to stop twice [...] to get a doctor to wash his eyes out, so inflamed were they, and at the end they were dreadful to behold. Perhaps the most pitiful sight was Henry Fournier [Itala] who was so bad he could scarcely see to bring his car into the enclosure and he was completely blindfolded after medical treatment and had to be led away.”\n\nJenatzy finished 16th, lost in the pack. The career of the first great Grand Prix driver was over. The race had proved that almost whatever regulations were in place the potential danger remained. At the left-hander at Eu, one driver either misjudged the corner completely or the car wouldn’t turn in. It travelled at great speed to the protective wooden wall at the far side and struck it so hard it smashed a section. Later, another went directly into and the wall, striking it so hard it brought down several sections scattered the crowd behind. In a different left-hander, a car went straight on into an advertising hoarding, mincing the DU of DUNLOP. to Two months later, ten-year-old Enzo Ferrari and his father went Lancia in their watch a race at Bologna, and there he saw Nazzaro and\n\n34\n\nGRAND PRIX CENTURY\n\nawesome FIATs. Ferrari had touched, and been touched by, motor racing for the first time. In due course, he would touch it and shape its very soul. He’d employ Nuvolari and their relationship would develop into an eternal question: what happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable object? The French were livid and bitter. For 1909 a race had been tentatively set for Anjou and the ACF had drawn up regulations for a minimum of 40 cars but when only nine entered they cancelled it and didn’t hold another until 1912, at Dieppe. Pausing here, it is important to stress that the story of Grand Prix racing cannot be properly appreciated without considering the social context in which it happened. It was impossibly exclusive and although ordinary working folk may have thronged to watch, they were watching another world go by. Throughout this book I’m going to use various measures — comparing increases in speed (for example, at Monaco when we get there) — and three will be social in nature: the number of vehicles registered on Britain’s roads from 1926, the first year it seems when we have accurate figures; the average weekly earnings of a Briton; the cost of the lowest priced Ford in their range. In 1909, a Briton earned £1.50 a week. A Model T Ford cost £220. Saving all his money, the Briton would have taken 2 years 42 weeks to buy one. To chart one aspect of the rise in motoring, every decade I'm going to give the cost of an average small Ford and the ever-decreasing time the Briton took to buy it. For long decades, motoring was the province of the wealthy and motor racing the province of the even wealthier. Eventually, motoring was for everyone — which must be reflected in the enormous appeal of motor racing. By 1912, the World Land Speed Record had been pushed to 141mph by an American in a Benz at Daytona. The Grand Prix at Dieppe reverted to two days of ten laps each, and to safeguard against a small entry, it was opened up to Voiturettes as well, producing a total entry of 58. The Grand Prix drivers included Hémery (Lorraine-Dietrich), Louis Wagner (Fiat), newcomers Jules Goux (Peugeot), Georges Boillot (Peugeot) — a stern, rounded countenance, a\n\ndecorative handlebar moustache — and two Americans, Ralph de Palma (Fiat) and David Bruce-Brown (Fiat). Goux, a studious-looking, sharp-eyed Frenchman and de Palma, handsome in the open, clean-cut American way, were of a new generation whose careers would span the First World War. Goux, a Frenchman and then 39, competed in 150 races, winning several dozen including the Indianapolis 500. He'd actually drive in the 1926 French Grand Prix.\n\nDUSTY ROAD\n\n35\n\nDe Palma began in 1906 but on motorbikes. ‘For Americans, he was a symbol of “up-by-the-bootstraps” industry; Italians considered him part of their folklore, even though he had left Italy as a nine-year-old and remembered little of the mother tongue. Sportsmanship and showmanship were wedded to his nature.’” He’d earn his fame with Mercedes, for whom he would win the Indianapolis 500. He didn’t retire until 1933, and the number of his wins has been put at 2,557. Boillot, who had a particularly fierce-looking moustache,” had also been racing since 1906. He and Goux helped build their own Peugeot, and in 1910, he won the Targa Florio with it. Boillot, who worked for Peugeot, was ‘fully skilled as a mechanic and able to assist in the design of a racing car as well as in its preparation. Strong, square-built, determined [...] very sure of himself, he would tackle anything.” Bruce-Brown was born to wealthy parents*® and became a mechanic then a driver. In 1909 he was beating de Palma and in 1911 he drove a Fiat in the first Indianapolis 500. Because of the way he drove, the French nicknamed him the errant schoolboy. Of him, someone said: ‘The instant I rested my eyes upon him, an utter stranger, I had a fairly accurate gauge of his character. He was the personification of and splendid youth and upon him was an fine, wholesome unmistakable stamp of good breeding. [...] was a fellow of natural poise and courteous deportment, attired nattily yet inconspicuously and spoke in a soft, modulated voice. He introduced himself as David Bruce-Brown, a student at Yale, but he was too much the true gentleman to add that he was the scion of a very wealthy and socially prominent New -York family. His code in fact did not tolerate braggadocio of any sort.’” Several teams tested over the Dieppe course well before the race and six early-morning sessions had also been-arranged. Boillot in his Peugeot — often described as the first modern Grand Prix car with its overhead camshafts — did successive laps of 41, 37 and 35 minutes while BruceBrown, who had arrived in Paris with de Palma the previous Wednesday, did 37. ‘The roads were hastily patched and their surfaces were sprayed with a calcium chloride solution to keep down dust.’® very The arrangements to start the race, at 5. 30am, were striking and both visual. A set of posts with numbered cards on them, were set down other. the to numbers odd sides of the track, even numbers to one side, up one This was not like the original Le Mans alternation, cars arriving respective after another, because here, the cars drew up behind their as it grid, The ly. numbers. They would however be sent off alternate would seem, had been created.\n\n36\n\nGRAND PRIX CENTURY\n\nThe cars were in place by 5.15 and the track cleared. The starter marched to the head of the grid and at that moment the mechanics of the first few cars rushed to their starting-handles, the engines were fired and it sounded like a salvo of cannon fire. The starter signalled the cars away at 30-second intervals. Bruce-Brown and his mechanic ‘created a sensation by coming to the starting line in their American make-up, this comprising a grey cloth mask, through which peered a pair of ghostly-looking eyes.’ On that first lap Hémery overtook ten cars and Boillot thirteen but Bruce-Brown had the lead on elapsed time (37m 18s), Boillot second (38m 40s). It was the story of the first day: Boillot raced Bruce-Brown and Wagner raced Boillot. Bruce-Brown and Boillot pitted together to intense excitement, BruceBrown accelerated away but Boillot’s Peugeot hesitated — to the anguish of the crowd. He ‘wrestled’ with the gear lever and he was away, too. Boillot was ‘anxious to see’ how Bruce-Brown would react to an attack and launched one in the V-shaped Dieppe corner. He went past and at speed but ‘as I soon as I had pulled in to my side of the road again I , glanced back. In a fraction of a second I was on the edge of a grassy bank. I had to cut out my ignition to save myself and, taking advantage of my error, Bruce-Brown roared past me.’ This first day finished: Bruce-Brown\n\n6h 36m 37s\n\nBoillot\n\n6h 38m 40s\n\nWagner\n\n7h 03m 12s\n\nA French driver, Leon Collinet, put a wheel into a ditch trying to overtake a car in the Voiturette class and the car rolled, killing his mechanic. Goux had been disqualified in extraordinary circumstances. A stone broke his petrol pipe and he soldered it at the roadside, but this cost so much time that he resumed at the rear of the field and, when he finished, the timekeepers told him he still had two laps to do. He protested and they reduced it to one. As he prepared to set off they realised he had done the ten rounds but then it emerged he had obtained petrol from ‘outside sources’, presumably to get back to the pits after the broken petrol pipe. It was illegal and he was out. De Palma was out, too, for the same offence. Anyway...\n\nDUSTY ROAD\n\n37\n\nsoon after the winner had come in, a fox terrier escaped from the paddock\n\non to the track, tearing down the course at top speed in a frantic endeavour to overtake a racing car. In the rear [John] Hancock was approaching on\n\nthe Vauxhall. Evidently with the intention of removing all possibility of danger to himself and the other competitors, he made\n\nstraight for the\n\nanimal, hit it with his right front wheel, and killed it instantly.”\n\nDrizzle melted into rain as the second day began and, under the regulations, no work could be done on the cars until they had been flagged away. Even when one mechanic tried to dry his car’s steering wheel he was warned. A Rolland-Pilain had a problem with the plug leads and didn’t move for an hour until Monsieur Pilain corrected the problem himself but, because he had physically touched the car, he had to take over the driving himself and supply his own mechanic. They finished eighth. It was a fascinating sight to watch the drivers start up their cold motors and get away in the shortest possible time. Bruce-Brown rushed at his car in well-reasoned fury, but although there was a determined rage in all his\n\nactions there was\n\nnever a false movement.\n\nAfter a few strokes on the\n\npressure pump the big motor spluttered, the mechanic leaped on behind, and the car ran a few yards ahead to the pits, where, with the motor still running to warm it up and save time, tyres and petrol were taken. In an\n\nincredibly short space of time it was off, throwing up a cloud of water.”\n\nThe race was decided when Bruce-Brown’s Fiat suffered a fuel pipe fracture — one report suggests he’d hit a dog — and to get back to the pits he had to borrow fuel. He was disqualified. Wagner tracked Boillot and, on lap 18 of the 20, went past him near the small town of Londinieres. Boillot was stationary and trying, using a tyre lever, to repair the gearbox and other damage caused by a stone. When he had done that he had only second and fourth gears, and kept the Peugeot in fourth wherever possible because changing down was so difficult. He was good enough to maintain speed in spite of that and although Wagner came in first, on the time stagger Boillot won. The pride of the French motor industry had been restored and the future of Grand Prix racing was safe. Bruce-Brown was killed three months American Grand Prix at Milwaukee.\n\nlater,\n\npractising\n\nfor\n\nthe\n\n38\n\nGRAND PRIX CENTURY\n\nIn 1913, the race went to its third staging post outside Amiens, a substantial town 90 miles north of Paris. It was in July again, so Goux came to it having won the Indianapolis 500 in May with a Peugeot — regarded as a tremendous feat because no European had won it before and, at pit stops during his 6 hours and 35 minutes of driving, he drank the equivalent of six bottles of Champagne. The Amiens circuit formed the by-now traditional triangle with a long, straight outward side, a 90° turn to a much shorter second side, twisting right again in the village of Moreuil and then following curves and corners all the way back on the third side. There would be 29 laps of 19.6 miles, giving a race distance of 579 miles. The rules had been changed to 800kg minimum weight, 1,100kg maximum and a 14mpg fuel consumption limit (20 litres per 100km). This effectively ruled out the big, heavy cars which had dominated the Grands Prix so far, but in any case, ‘new companies were now building special cars for racing, and Peugeot remained in the ascendant.’ Of the big manufactures, Mercedes and Fiat didn’t enter. Goux and Boillot had Peugeots, Nazzaro an Itala, Adam Opel entered a single car but Sunbeam fielded four —- Gustave Caillois, Resta, Jean Chassagne and Kenelm Lee Guinness, an Irishman of the brewing family with a wicked sense of humour. He was known as Bill.® Chassagne was known as . ‘Chass’ and would become a leading European driver. ‘Usually his attire is a model of neatness. He wears white kid gloves, and nothing can perturb him. He never makes a fuss, but if any expected or unexpected assistance can be given, he gives it.’ There had been some testing on the circuit but it was opened to the public in May and the Itala team, who had come with one racing car, had to learn it in a tourer. They then travelled to Brooklands and practised there before returning to France and the old circuit at — Dieppe. Early one morning Bigio, a company executive, went out with a mechanic for a run, and crashed. Both men died. Soon after, leading driver Paul Zuccarelli® was trying his Peugeot on a long straight. A farm kart emerged from a side turning and he hit it, killing himself. Rationalising danger is always the hardest part of motorsport, and it is no easier when you're trying to recapture the mentality of eras long gone. It does seem that there is a constant all the way through: men prepared to measure their desires against the possible consequences. In that sense, Paul Zuccarelli was just like Jim Clark or Ayrton Senna although Zuccarelli had to know he was doing something very, very dangerous and with no safeguards. Too many have died, as we have\n\nDUSTY ROAD\n\n39\n\nseen, for him not to know - yet, until the 1960s, they all accepted either no safeguards, or inadequate safeguards. The Motor indulged in whimsy when it reported that the Sunbeam team were lodged in an old chateau near Moreuil which ‘has a superb collection of ghosts’. One of the team said they ‘disturb him in the early morning, and he dislikes being called early. Resta finds them distinctly companionable.’ Caillois ‘declares that the ghosts were guaranteed in the contract, and if they are not supplied before the day of the race he will protest.’ The ladies were ‘somewhat divided’ — one thought she could face a French ghost, another that ‘frankly she will not try.’ The Motor added: ‘It is worth noting that when night falls and the long, hollow corridors are plunged in obscurity and the big dining hall, with its oak ceiling bedecked with the fleur-de-lys, is dimly illuminated by candles, no proposal is ever made to wander far afield...’ At the weigh-in only the Itala cars were over the weight limit, and they made it by shedding parts. ‘Who will win?’ the local paper, Le Progrés de la Somme, wondered. ‘The Italas have engines without exhaust valves. “That doesn’t mean anything for the race!” a driver told me yesterday. One of the Italas is driven by Nazzaro, the famous Italian who is never very far from winning.’ Peugeot? The writer thought Boillot ‘a bit fat, a bit heavy, certainly still affected by the loss of his friend Zuccarelli’ and found Goux ‘dry, agile, calm, marvellously fit.’ The start, due at 5am, had to be delayed by half an hour for fog. ‘It was impossible to see a person in the field behind the tyre pits on the opposite side of the track, while the yellow advertising balloons presented mere dim outlines in the sky.’ This did not deter an enormous crowd from coming and ‘for miles down the fast stretch, the human road lining was continuous, the greater proportion of the crowd being of the poorer classes.’ The race finally began when Caillios was sent off at 5.31, but the first lap was\n\nslow because of the fog and cold. Boillot led it. One car... stalled his motor on the first hill. The mechanic tired himself until he was away no longer able to crank the engine, and the only means of getting on backwards run to car was by putting it in reverse gear and allowing the\n\nthe hill.”\n\nands The driver of an Itala lost control at the hairpin near the grandst Driver and and his car slithered into the banking, flipping on to its side.\n\n40\n\nGRAND PRIX CENTURY\n\nmechanic managed to right it then the driver locked arms round the mechanic to hold him rigid while he cranked the engine and they set off again to loud applause. They had a damaged steering column, but wouldn’t be deterred by anything so trivial. As the fog cleared speeds increased. Near half distance, Albert Guyot (Delage), who had been given pit the instruction attack, was past Goux, Boillot running third. On lap 17 however Boillot went past the pits in the lead, Goux behind him — Guyot came in a long time after. He’d had to change two tyres out on the circuit and then a third blew. The mechanic [only referred to as Semos], in a desire to save time, vaulted out of the car before it had sufficiently slowed down. Instead of travelling at 15mph as the mechanic supposed, Guyot declared later that he must at the moment have been running at 30. The mechanic was knocked down,\n\nthe car passing over him. No bones were broken, but he suffered flesh wounds, was injured in the head, and fainted with pain. It was necessary to wait a few minutes until the man regained consciousness, lift him into the car and drive round at a reduced speed to avoid shaking him. To have returned without the mechanic would have entailed disqualification.”\n\nGuinness crashed on lap 15 when a front tyre on his Sunbeam let go at a village. He fought to keep control of the car but it struck the protective pailings on a bridge over a little river. The car flipped, hurling a spectator into the water. Guinness and his mechanic were thrown into the water, too, and suffered minor injuries, but the spectator was dead. Boillot won it from Goux, giving Peugeot first and second places. Boillot drove the Peugeot into the winner’s enclosure, a narrow path across grass between twin rows of wooden staves. He and his mechanic got off and posed for a photograph: Boillot round faced — almost cherubic — but that face was marked by grime. He wore leather boots and a stout jacket. His right hand was black, perhaps more grime, perhaps oil. The mechanic, stocky, swarthy and slightly shorter than Boillot, wore a leather jerkin which seems to have been completely coated by oil, and so had his face, and so had his hands. He wore a beret, his goggles hoisted up to rest on it. Both men were grinning, but they were tired grins. They had been in the car for 7 hours 53 minutes and 56.8 seconds, a margin of some 2/4 minutes over Goux. Not all the arrangements during the race had evidently proved satisfactory:\n\nDUSTY ROAD\n\n4]\n\nA car would come in to change a tyre, take in some oil or what not, and the mechanic or driver would ask for a drink. A couple of glasses of wine, beer\n\nor mineral water would be poured out and placed on the edge of the track. Driver and mechanic having completed their separate tasks, the former would spring into his seat, the latter would jump to the starting handle,\n\nboth having entirely forgotten their desire for a drink, whilst the members of the pit staff who had filled the glasses would make no attempt to remind them, but, as the car moved off, would calmly step down and perhaps give\n\nthe drinks to the pit attendants, or stand them on one side — to gather a surface of dust — for the next time round.”\n\nIn October, Jenatzy — who hadn’t raced in Grands Prix since 1908 — was out with a party hunting wild boar in the wooded Ardennes. At nightfall, he left his hiding place, but the hunt wasn’t over and, by a hideous irony, the friend who had invited him to the hunt mistook him for a boar and shot him. They carried him to his Mercedes and he died in it a few moments later.” The 1914 American Grand Prix, in February, didn’t attract the Europeans, although a Mercedes came fourth. The Indianapolis 500 at the end of May did. René Thomas, who had driven at Dieppe in 1912 and Amiens in 1913, won it in a Delage, Duray (Peugeot) second, Guyot (Delage) third, Goux (Peugeot) fourth. Boillot set a new track record in qualifying: 99.6mph in his Peugeot. Europeans wouldn’t do anything like this again until 1966, when Graham Hill won from Jim Clark; Jackie Stewart sixth — Stewart had seemed certain to win but his car suffered\n\nan oil leak. On 24 June 1914, a Briton called L. G. ‘Cupid’ Hornsted set a new World Land Speed Record at Brooklands of 124.0mph. Although considerably slower than the 1911 Daytona record this was the first ‘two-way’ run — a flying mile, turn, a flying mile back — and as such recognised by the governing body the FIA,” which had recently been\n\nformed. Four days later Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated in the Serbian town of Sarajevo, and it set in train the lock-step of events of a culminating in the First World War. One British newspaper spoke ‘clap of thunder’ over Europe. Prix at Lyon This was the atmosphere surrounding the French Grand\n\ned a great — the fourth staging post — the following Saturday. It produc land shadow the because was race, some say the great race. Perhaps that the all because of war was moving across the landscape, perhaps it was Vauxhalls — de leading drivers and makes were there, including three\n\n42\n\nGRAND PRIX CENTURY\n\nPalma had one — while mighty Fiat returned and the entry of 37 was motor racing; perhaps it was because, at its heart, Peugeot was challenging Mercedes: France against Germany. An estimated 300,000 came to see. They had to be spread round the circuit which remained triangular with a long, straight backbone, where in the fields, workmen would watch, some standing beside an old cart. A lot of twisting turns formed the rest of the circuit, including a Ushaped turn where cars slithered gloriously and the crowd thronged the hillocks all around it. There was a section like a ledge, with a rockface to one side and, beyond a stone parapet, a drop to the other. There was a tight uphill right-hander and, rounding it, the cars exhaled great, sudden, elongated plumes from their exhaust pipes. There was a narrow section through a town, under a temporary wooden bridge, and the crowds were dense everywhere you looked. Beyond the temporary bridge stood a railway viaduct and during the race trains would slip across it while beneath them the beasts roared and smoked. Although the race had moved to central France for the first time, the roads were better than the previous circuits and a local grant improved them further, but it still had a corner called /e piege de la mort — the trap of death. The engine capacity had been set at 4,500cc while the maximum weight was held at 1,100kg. Initially, there wasn’t any practice, although reports suggest some of the French drivers had covered some of the circuit in their racing Cars. ‘Then local authorities relented slightly and at 48 hours notice allowed the roads to be closed for two 90-minute practice periods. [...] The Indianapolis drivers [...] got back to France just in time to take advantage of these, many foreign drivers could not for one reason or another, and, in the eyes of some sections of the French press, officials inevitably “rested under the unpleasant odour of favouritism.’””% One estimate suggests that half or more of the entrants hadn’t been able to practice at all. The local paper, Le Progres, caught the intoxication of the start: The drivers are in place, several wearing gaudy headgear but the most elegant are the Pic-Pic” whose hats and jerseys are well matched with the colours of the car. To facilitate the start, which is to be given simultaneously to cars in pairs, a long line had been whitewashed in the middle of the track [so the cars didn’t run into each other]...Little by little the track was evacuated; the service personnel stand immobile , almost incrusted against their refuelling equipment. It is 8 o’clock. The course is entirely cleared and, ranged into two columns, odd numbers to the right,\n\nDUSTY ROAD\n\n43\n\neven numbers to the left, the cars wait for the signal. Brusquely the starter lowers\n\nhis flag and in a tremendous\n\nroar of engines,\n\nin a cloud of\n\nimpenetrable smoke from the exhaust pipes, the competitors start, fly off and disappear round the corner.\n\nThis sense of anticipation and action was heightened because, going off in pairs at 30-second intervals, the 37 were all away by 8.10am. A little-known Mercedes driver, Max Sailer, made a tremendous start from the sixth ‘row’ and accelerated clean away from the Fiat paired with him. Sailer led on elapsed time completing the opening lap — Boillot led ‘on the road’ — and by lap three Sailer had pulled a minute and a half away. Sailer was forcing the Mercedes hard — he set a new fastest lap on lap four — while the other four Mercedes drivers, including Lautenschlager, held back, watching and waiting. Or did they? ‘There was, apparently, a good deal of rivalry between the veteran Lautenschlager and the dashing\n\nSailer.’”* At the end of lap five: Sailer\n\nlh 43m 16s\n\nBoillot\n\nlh 46m 00s\n\nDuray\n\nlh 46m 51s\n\nLautenschlager\n\nlh 46m 57s\n\nSoon after this a connecting rod in Sailer’s engine failed so that into lap six Boillot led but Lautenschlager was up to second, a minute behind. Lautenschlager made his scheduled pit stop and resumed, stalking his distant prey. Boillot was ‘flogging’ his Peugeot, cornering as fast as he could — or dared — and forcing it to its maximum on the ‘long switchback straight composing the third leg of the triangle.’” At 15 laps, Lautenschlager was 2 minutes 28 seconds behind but, cut seeming to be able to pace himself, cut that by 23 seconds on lap 16, car the but d, possesse it further on lap 17.

They were not anti-German, not showing disrespect, they were stunned, and further stunned when Louis Wagner’s Mercedes came in second, Otto Salzer’s Mercedes third. Goux brought his Peugeot in fourth — scant consolation, if any. Three weeks later, Austria issued an ultimatum to Serbia. Within a week, Germany had declared war on Russia and France, and invaded Belgium; Britain had declared war on Germany. The unremitting slaughter would last until November 1918 and, although nobody knows exactly how many men died, 10,000,000 seems likely. It remains beyond imagining. Some say as the vast crowd ebbed away from the circuit outside Lyon that the heroic days were over. The pioneering days certainly were and, in that sense, an era closed forever just before the guns played their deadly music across Europe. It had been exactly 20 years since the Paris—Rouen reliability trial. The first World Land Speed Record, four years after that, was 39mph. Now, in 1914, it stood at 124mph. The fastest lap in the Le Mans Grand Prix averaged 73mph and although comparisons are elusive — regulations, different circuits — the fastest at Lyon, 4mph slower. This wouldn’t happen again. And the end of heroic days? No, no. They were just beginning.\n\nNotes 1. Daimler and Benz did not merge until 1926. ‘The essential difference between the two great early pioneers was that Daimler was a visionary who dreamed of his engines serving mankind, while Benz only ever wanted to be a car-maker.’ (The Dawn of Motoring, Mercedes-Benz). 2"
