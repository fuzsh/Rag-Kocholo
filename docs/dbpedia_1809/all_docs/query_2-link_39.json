        "text": "Qualifying: It was wet!\n\nFrom the assembly area we could all see the rooster tails of the historic F1 cars. Yes, qualifying was going to be wet. It also started 30 minutes late as some of the F1 cars had to be craned away first… While most drivers were still finding their feet, Olivier Hart set a stunning 2:20 lap in the Cobra Daytona to claim pole. He would start from row 2 though as a result of a penalty for ignoring yellow flags. Into the 2:21’s went Andy Newall in the E-type which meant he would start from pole in race 1. Jop Rappange was third fastest in the Porsche 904-6, while Manfredo Rossi Di Montelera was 4th in the Shelby Mustang GT350, but he was also docked 3 places. Another to be penalized was Jaap Sinke in Jetze Visser’s ex-works Sebring Big Healey, which dropped him from 5th to 8th. So Roelant de Waard (Shelby Mustang GT350) took over 4th on the grid with Peter Brouwer 5th. Peter was fastest of the Lotus Elans by a country mile, but true to his reputation as the hardest working man in showbusiness he overdid it, had a spin just before Tarzan and hit the wall. Work to do for Peter the mechanic to fix things for the race. Thijmen de Vries was on course to be fastest of the touring cars until his engine stopped. It was still a Mini Cooper S at the front though, with Rene de Vries at the wheel. Second fastest TC was the Daniel Quintero – Peter Reynolds Lotus Cortina. Jack van der Ende would line up fourth TC in the Ford Falcon. In GTS11 a Porsche 911 is the car to have when it’s raining. Thijs van Gammeren was fastest, from Erwin van Lieshout with Holger Felske third in the first of the MGB’s. It was great to see (and hear) the Van der Lof Ferrari 250 SWB out on track, Alexander qualified it 13th. Kennet Persson had a difficult qualifying, he nearly hit the wall and ended up only 20th fastest in the Ford GT40. Charles Allison and Peter Thompson’s TVR Griffith was also not performing well, leaving them 29th. These two were expected to storm to the front in the race, provided it would be dry. Finally, spare a thought for Udo Klasfauseweh in his Ford Falcon and Søren Christensen in his Ford GT40. These debutants bravely soldiered on, learning the track and trying to keep out of the way. They qualified 43th and 44th.\n\nRace 1: Hart hard at it\n\nTurn 9 played a big part in deciding Saturday’s SuperSixties race. When the lights turned green, Olivier Hart initially lost out to Andy Newall in the Jaguar E-type, but soon romped into the lead with the Cobra Daytona. Jop Rappange held third in the Porsche 904-6, but had to work hard to keep up. Rene de Vries managed to stay ahead of all the other touring cars at the start, but the Mini Cooper was soon reeled in by Quintero in the Lotus Cortina, with fast-starting Jack van der Ende in the Ford Falcon not far behind. Even faster was Carlo Hamilton in his Falcon, but just when we thought he had finally got the V8 running properly, the car expired in Turn 9. Although it was in a fairly safe spot, Race Control decided to bring in the Safety Car. It took a long time to tow the Falcon away. This could have made the race more interesting, had there not been a train of backmarkers between Olivier Hart and his pursuers by this time. So, at the restart, Olivier was even further ahead, while a number of frustrated drivers did themselves no favours by overtaking before the Safety Car line. By now Kennet Persson in the Ford GT40 (having started 20th) and Peter Thompson in the TVR Griffith (from 29th) had made their way to the front and we had a tense four-way battle for second. With 45 cars on track, there was a lot of lapping going on. In an attempt to stay in touch, Jop Rappange made contact with a backmarker. The Porsche lost its front bonnet, which landed on the Turn 9 racing line. This led to another Safety Car period, which unfortunately lasted to the chequered flag. Thus, the race ended with everyone bunched up. Combine this fact with no less than 12 time penalties being issued and the printed result different substantially from the actual finishing order.\n\nBehind undisputed victor Olivier Hart, Andy Newall was classified second and Peter Thompson took the third podium spot. Fourth went to Manfredo Rossi de Montelera in the Shelby GT350 with Alexander van der Lof in the Ferrari SWB a strong fifth. Peter Brouwer won GTS10, sixth overall, with Luc de Cock in another Elan not far behind, although the penalized Kenneth Persson landed between these two in the result. Roelant de Waard was even worse off, a 5 second penalty dropping him to 9th. In GTS11 Theo van Gammeren was hampered by his arm restraint getting stuck in the seat runner of the Porsche 911. It took a while before he could free himself. Erwin van Lieshout duly motored to another class win in his 911, Holger Felske came second in the MGB and Theo salvaged third. Thanks to a late entry from Lucas Astorian we had two Lotus Elites in the race, but it was old hand Alexander Schlüchter who took the class win. With the Porsche 904 dropping out, Chas Mallard took the spoils in the small GTP class in the Ginetta G4R. In touring cars, the win went to Jack van der Ende in the Ford Falcon, with Henk van Gammeren in a similar car classified second, although he was behind Abraham Bontrup’s Mustang on the road. Daniel Quintero also collected a time penalty but still won CT08, from Allan Thom and Hanna Grade, all in Lotus Cortinas. The Mini class was a De Vries family affair, Rene taking the chequer 2,9 seconds ahead of Thijmen, with Bert Mets some way behind in third.\n\nRace 2: A fiery end to a great weekend\n\nOlivier Hart repeated his earlier performance by scoring another dominant victory in Sunday’s curtain closer, at the wheel of the DHG Cobra Daytona. Rhea Sautter hung on to second for a while in the mint green E-type until Kennet Persson took over in the Ford GT40. Peter Brouwer made a great start and slotted into third in his Lotus Elan, and then got involved in a race-long duel with Manfredo Rossi (Shelby GT350) and Luc de Cock (Lotus Elan). Rossi’s tyre-smoking late braking manoeuvres looked spectacular, but allowed the nimble Elans to pass him every time. De Cock managed to get ahead of Brouwer on several occasions, but Brouwer prevailed in the end. He was fourth overall though, as Charles Allison in the TVR Griffith had needed some time to get up to speed, but duly passed the battling trio to take the final podium spot. Rossi’s tire-smoking actions dropped him to 7th behind Alexander van der Lof in the Ferrari SWB. He was denied a chance to set matters straight when Nigel Winchester’s Ginetta caught fire in the final corner. A quick exit was in order, which left the car in a very awkward spot. Race Control had no other choice than to hang out the red flag. With just under 5 minutes on the clock, the race would not be restarted.\n\nOn lap 9, Thijs van Gammeren had overtaken Erwin van Lieshout, the two Porsches claiming the first two places in GTS11, while Brian Lambert was shadowed by Holger Felske for the duration of the race to take third in class and first of the MGB’s. Lucas Astorian was the only starter in GTS04 in his beautiful Lotus Elite and drove a steady race, improving his laptimes by nearly 2 seconds. Most improved driver was Søren Christensen in the yellow GT40 though, he shaved 5 seconds off his Saturday best! In touring cars Jaap van der Ende led away in the orange Falcon, but it was Bram Bontrup in the DHG Mustang who overtook him and claimed the win. Peter Reynolds was second touring car home in the CT08 winning Lotus Cortina, while van der Ende had Henk Van Gammeren breathing down his neck when the race was stopped. Before that Carlo Hamilton had been going well, setting fast laptimes in the light blue Falcon, but again it did not last, although he did manage 50% more laps than on Saturday. Second and third in CT08 were Allan Thom and Magnus Lillerskog, both in a Lotus Cortina. In CT07 René de Vries led for most of the race, but his son Thijmen was ahead when it counted with Bert Mets third in class, all in Cooper S’.\n\nEveryone thoroughly enjoyed the weekend, helped by the beautiful weather, smooth organization, entousiastic spectators and a party atmosphere. With 45 cars SuperSixties was the best supported series of the 2024 Zandvoort Historic Grand Prix. A big shout out to all our guest drivers, thanks for joining us and do come again!\n\nFull results: https://www.supersixtiesracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Results.pdf\n\nMore results: https://raceresults.nu/Results/organisator/2024?evenement=Circuit+Zandvoort&race=Historic+Grand+Prix+2024\n\nPoints: https://www.supersixtiesracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Standings-Zandvoort.pdf\n\nMore news from Zandvoort in SuperSixties Magazine 2024#3: https://www.supersixtiesracing.com/supersixties-zandvoort-magazine-v2/\n\nCharade – what a brilliant racetrack!\n\nAt the end of qualifying, every single driver stepped out of the car with a broad smile on their face. After a drizzly morning the sun came out and the Charade track welcomed the SuperSixties drivers with dry tarmac, even if it was a bit oily in places. While most drivers set out to learn the track, Greg Carini in the Cooper S and Luc de Cock in the Lotus Elan used their local knowledge to launch themselves to the top of the timesheets. Next to get up to speed was Armand Adriaans in the Shelby Cobra. Later in the session Andy Newall set a 2:17,5 to claim pole in the Jaguar E-type he shares with Rhea Sautter. Kennet Persson in the Ford GT40 was expected to better that, but traffic on the narrow track and loads of yellow flags meant he had to settle for second, 0,7 seconds behind. Row two was claimed by Adriaans and De Cock, with Roelant de Waard in 5th in his Shelby GT350. Greg Carini and David Barrere had a great scrap in their Mini’s, using the full width of the track and four-wheel drifting through the corners to claim a brilliant 6th and 7th, fastest of all the touring cars. Peter Brouwer took 8th in his Lotus Elan, while Niek van Gils qualified his Lotus in 9th but decided to switch to his MGB for the races. That promoted Mark Dols (Marcos 1800) to 9th and SuperSixties debutant Malivaï Castelli (Lotus Elan) to 10th. There was be a record number of 9 MGB’s fighting for GST11 honours this weekend. Brian Lambert was fastest of them all, and also managed to outpace the single Porsche 911 in the class, driven by Erwin van Lieshout. Returning to the touring cars, there were more Mini’s in 3rd and 4th, Jasper Izaks ahead of Rob Rappange, with Hemmo Vriend only fifth due to a gearbox problem. His Ford Falcon was to have a fresh T10 fitted for the race. The Lotus Cortina contest was won by the smallest of margins by Magnus Lillerskog, from Raffin/Raffin. Would it be Sweden or France? Most talked about car in the paddock was definitely the Iso Rivolta IR300 of Rob Bergmans (welcome back Rob!), a rare beast indeed. Most unlucky driver was Oliver Douglas, who did not set a time at all in the Cobra Daytona.\n\nRace 1: an exciting race with a confusing finish\n\nSaturday’s SuperSixties race was very exciting to watch. So much so that the guy holding the “last lap” board was caught out and as a result the race finished one lap early.\n\nBefore that that there was a lot of great action. Kennet Persson led for the first few laps, with Armand Adriaans in pursuit. When the Ford GT40 hit a kerb, it dislodged a track rod and Kennet had to retire the car, handing the lead to the AC Cobra. Luc de Cock in the Lotus Elan, the Sautter/Newall E-type and Roelant de Waard were all close behind and in with a chance, although De Waard messed up when he came in too late for his stop. In the last few laps Luc de Cock was harrying Adriaans while Andy Newall was closing in. It could have been any of them but it was in fact De Cock who just nipped ahead of Adriaans when they passed the line. The bad news for the Belgian veteran racer was that in the final lap confusion the clerk of the course decided to red flag the race, which meant the result was declared after the previous lap. At that moment Adriaans was 0,19 seconds ahead. Luc did get to stand on the top step of the podium though. Newall/Sautter were classified third with Peter Brouwer in the Lotus Elan fourth. In fifth was the giant killing Mini of Greg Carini, who again had a good scrap with David Barrere before pulling away. At the finish the two Mini’s were split by Oliver Douglas in the Cobra Daytona, who had started from the back. The same went for the Deenik/Sinke Ford Falcon, up to 8th at the finish. Having collected a draconic 300 second penalty, Roelant de Waard dropped to 9th in the results. Rounding out the top-10 was none other than Mr. Iso Rivolta himself, Rob Bergmans. Yes, he has built a new one and it looks great! He also won the invitation class ahead of Bernd Horlacher (AH Sebring Sprite) and Frank Weidema (Mini Marcos). GTS11 saw Erwin van Lieshout in the lone Porsche 911 take on no less than 9 MGB’s. He had to give best to Brian Lambert, while Holger Felske finished second on the road but incurred a penalty which dropped him to fourth in class behind Antoine Darley and Basile Gronfier. Third in CT07 was Rob Rappange in the Mini, just ahead of Hemmo Vriend in his Ford Falcon, second in CT10. Sweden won the CT08 Lotus Cortina battle, Magnus Lillerskog driving a steady race and managing to keep the Raffin family behind him. Finally, in GTP<2500 there were no finishers, both Mark Dols in the Marcos 1800 and Nigel Winchester in the Ginetta G4R dropping out after 6 laps which was a shame as they were very close on laptimes. We would have to wait until Sunday to see who was fastest.\n\nRace 2: Luc’s revenge\n\nLuc de Cock made up for Saturday’s disappointment by scoring a resounding win in the second SuperSixties race at Charade. Armand Adriaans led away from the start in the Shelby Cobra. De Cock was on his tail the whole time and pounced on lap 4. He pulled out a comfortable lead, but then messed up his pitstop so he had to do it all over again. Some very quick laps soon brought the Cobra back in his sights. He wasted no time in passing and was 3 seconds ahead at the flag. Andy Newall (Jaguar E-type) snatched third from Roelant de Waard (Shelby GT350) on the final lap. Peter Brouwer held third initially in his Lotus Elan but lost ground after a spin. He finished 6th behind Oliver Douglas in the Cobra Daytona. Kennet Persson was another who held third for a while. Having started 32nd he lost a certain podium place when the throttle cable of his Ford GT40 broke. Bart Deenik had a great start in the Ford Falcon and was just behind David Barrere in the Cooper S but later in the race the French Mini racers Barrere and Carini again made the touring car class their own in 7th and 8th with Deenik/Sinke finishing 9th and Jasper Izaks an impressive 10th in his borrowed Cooper S. Magnus Lillerskog was one of several with a time penalty for a pitstop, but still won CT08, ahead of the other Lotus Cortina of the Raffin brothers. Mark Dols won the small GTP class in the Marcos 1800 ahead of Chas Mallard and Nigel Winchester in the Ginetta G4R, all of them happy to make it to the finish this time. Frank Weidema drove his Mini Marcos to a win in the invitation class. Finally there was high drama in the most hotly contested class, GTS11. Erwin van Lieshout was determined to beat the MGB’s and indeed managed to take the class lead in his Porsche 911. In doing so he overshot the pit window. This was rewarded with a 300 second penalty as per the regulations, so all his efforts had been in vain. Brian Lambert’s MGB suffered rear end damage in an unfortunate outbraking manoeuvre by another competitor, but he still brought it home to a class win. Holger Felske drove a faultless race and took second. The Darley/Gronfier MGB looked good for third in class until the gearbox broke. Through it all came Egbert Kolvoort to claim the trophy for third, with Fabienne Mütschler an excellent fourth in class.\n\nResults: https://www.supersixtiesracing.com/results/\n\nFull results (with a bit of navigating): https://www.its-results.com/hvm/2024/4c1cbcc0-a6c0-4004-9d02-8857b4de0932\n\nMore news from Charade in SuperSixties Magazine 2024#2, here: download magazine\n\nThe full unofficial not-a-championship ranking after 2 races: download ranking\n\nSuperSixties 2024 kicked off with mechanical issues for many drivers, from engine bay fires to broken diffs and wheels parting company. Through it all came Rhea Sautter and Andy Newall to claim pole in the Jaguar E-type, just 0,2 seconds ahead of Roelant de Waard in the Shelby GT350. Oliver Douglas in the Cobra Daytona was another 2/10th behind. Luc de Cock was fastest of the Lotus Elans in 4th followed by John Tordoff and Bob Stevens. Fastest in GTS11 was Erwin van Lieshout in the Porsche 911, with Brian Lambert first of the MGB’s ahead of Egbert Kolvoort. In touring cars it was the Jaap/Jack van der Ende Ford Falcon at the front from Adam Cunnington in his Lotus Cortina. Both retired from the session with serious suspension issues though. So it remained to be seen whether they would make it to the start. If not, Hemmo Vriend (Ford Falcon), Ties Meeuwissen (Ford Mustang) and Ralf Wagner (Lotus Cortina) were first in line for the spoils in TC. Jop Rappange was fastest of the Mini’s with Alexander Schlüchter not far behind, even though he lost a front wheel. That would be fixed for Race 1 at 16:15 in the afternoon as would be most other cars – there was a lot of spannering going on.\n\nRhea Sautter led away from the grid but was soon overtaken by Roelant de Waard. Then, at the end of lap 1, Oliver Douglas took over at the front. Bob Stevens was the man with a plan though. Having started 6th, he took the lead on lap 4 and pulled out a small gap in his Lotus Elan, while the V8’s battled for second place. Oliver Douglas in the Cobra Daytona, the Adriaans AC Cobra and Niek van Gils in the TVR Griffith were all in with a chance. In the end Douglas took second while Van Gils incurred a time penalty that handed third to Newall/Sautter in the E-type, 4th to Adriaans/Adriaans and 5th to De Waard. Luc de Cock and John Tordoff had a great tussle for 7th in their Elans which Tordoff won in the end. Jack and Jaap van der Ende won the touring car class in the Ford Falcon, Adam Cunnington was next in the Lotus Cortina, then Hemmo Vriend in his Falcon. Next it was Jop Rappange in the Mini, Dieter-Karl Anton in his Lotus Cortina (for sale!) and Cees Lubbers in another Falcon. Alexander Schlüchter and Bernd Horlacher took 2nd and 3rd in CT07 in their Mini’s while Magnus Lillerskog was third in CT08 in yet another Lotus Cortina. In GTS11 Erwin van Lieshout was never headed in his Porsche, while Brian and Barbara Lambert outsmarted Egbert Kolvoort to finish first of the MGB’s. Holger Felske survived a spin to just stay ahead of the Mütschler sisters, while Clara Felske kept her nose clean and finished sixth in class. Finally, Marcel Peter deserves a mention for his open door policy. He drove into the paddock, jacked up the Healey, fixed the door, then rejoined the race.\n\nOn Saturday Bob Stevens made it 2 out of 2. He bided his time behind Oliver Douglas and Niek van Gils in their V8’s and pounced when they pitted for their compulsory stop. After his own pitstop the little blue Lotus came back on track with a healthy lead. Douglas had to work to keep his Cobra Daytona ahead of van Gils’ TVR. He lost ground after a small mishap, dropping behind van Gils and Roelant de Waard. De Waard finished third on the road in his Shelby GT350 but was awarded second overall and the win in GTS12 as van Gils collected another time penalty. Father and son Adriaans in the Cobra and Rhea Sautter/Andy Newall in the E-type were 5th and 6th while John Tordoff again claimed 2nd in GTS10 just ahead of Luc de Cock. Returnee Roland Zoomers claimed 9th in his beautifully rebuilt E-type while Rob Rappange rounded out the top-10 in the Porsche 904-6 GTP. As usual GTS11 fell to Erwin van Lieshout in his Porsche 911, while Egbert Kolvoort had to work hard to hold on to second from Holger Felske in the first of many MGB’s. Pit window problems caused a host of time penalties in the various touring car classes. Adam Cunnington made no mistakes and was classified first TC home in his CT08 Lotus Cortina, then Hemmo Vriend in the CT10 winning Ford Falcon and Alexander Schlüchter in the first of the Mini’s. Cees Lubbers and father and son Van der Ende were second and third in CT10, Dieter-Karl Anton and Magnus Lillerskog ditto in CT08 and Bernd Horlacher was second in the Mini Cooper class, CT07.\n\nResults can be found here: http://spasummerclassic.alkamelsystems.com\n\nAll in all, a great start of the season with two incident free races.

Allard Kalff set a blistering 2:02 in Michiel Campagne’s Corvette Grand Sport. Abbring took a few laps to get acquainted with Bas Jansen’s AC Cobra, then set an unbeatable 2:01,3 to take pole. Andy Newall qualified Rhea Sautter’s E-type in 3rd. Philippe Vermast was fastest of the Lotus Elans ahead of Peter Brouwer. Next it was Roelant de Waard and Adriaans/Adriaans in Shelby Mustang and Cobra respectively. The first of the touring cars would start 8th, Kalff and Campagne again, now in a Mustang. Their driver change in the race promised to be interesting… Mats Ek (Lotus Elan) and Marcel van Laarhoven (Shelby Mustang) rounded out the top-10. The Van Gammeren Porsche 911 was fastest in GTS11 while Thijmen de Vries just pipped teammate Phil Anning in the first of the Mini’s. In CT08 it was Mr. Ford Bart-Jan Deenik back at the wheel of a Lotus Cortina who posted the fastest time ahead of Magnus Lillerskog.\n\nRace 1: Vermast the surprise winner\n\nSuperSixties powered by NKHTGT treated the spectators at the Tabac Classic GP Assen to a superb spectacle on Saturday. Michiel Campagne took the lead in the Corvette Grand Sport, with Andy Newall (Jaguar E-type), Bas Jansen (AC Cobra) and Philippe Vermast (Lotus Elan) in hot pursuit. These four had a ding-dong battle until the pit window opened after 15 minutes. Campagne was the first to come in, but Allard Kalff took well over a minute to reach the pit in the Mustang, so a fair amount of time was lost. Kevin Abbring had taken over from Bas Jansen and they looked to have the win in the bag until a safety car interlude provided them with a penalty. Through all the confusion came Philippe Vermast with a faultless performance to take the win in his Lotus Elan. Roelant de Waard (Shelby Mustang) was 9 seconds behind in second while Jansen/Abbring were relegated to third. Kalff used the safety car period to close in on the Sautter/Newall E-type and passed it on the final lap to take fourth. The first touring car home was a surprise, Thijmen de Vries in the Mini Cooper left a lot of potentially faster cars behind to take 6th. Next was Peter Brouwer, second in GTS10 in his Lotus Elan, then the Kalff-Campagne CT10 Mustang and the Wilhelm-van Gelder E-type. Cees Lubbers bumped his way into the final top-10 spot in his Ford Falcon. Erwin van Lieshout was victorious in GTS11 in his Porsche while Bart-Jan Deenik dominated CT08 in his Lotus Cortina.\n\nRace 2: Kalff and Campagne’s cunning plan\n\nIn Sunday’s SuperSixties race, the action started after the pitstops. It was another blistering hot day at the Tabac Classic GP Assen and the rate of attrition was high. Kevin Abbring took a commanding lead at the start, but dropped out after just one lap when the steering of the AC Cobra let him down. With Michiel Campagne starting from the pits in the big GTP Corvette, it was Roelant de Waard who was now leading in the Shelby Mustang, followed by Peter Brouwer in the Lotus Elan. The CT08 battle was decided early on when Marcel Wentzel and Magnus Lillerskog collided. Both Lotus Cortina’s were out, leaving a clutchless Gerrit Jan van Leenen to cruise to a class win, although getting away after his pitstop was a challenge.\n\nA short safety car interlude to remove the stranded Swedish Lotus Cortina meant many teams decided to pit early. It was now very close at the front with Roelant de Waard in the Shelby Mustang, Peter Brouwer in his Elan and the Armand/Sam Adriaans Cobra all in close contention, while Andy Newall was catching them all in Rhea Sautter’s E-type. Kalff and Campagne had a method to their madness though, the Corvette Grand Sport starting from the pits meant they had their driver and car change timed to perfection. Kalff put down the pedal in the Corvette to catch the leaders, while Campagne took over the Mustang ahead of all the other touring cars.\n\nNewall put up the most resistance, but it was Allard Kalff who took the spoils, while a pitlane speeding offence cost Newall/Sautter second place, that was handed to Roelant de Waard. Sam and Armand Adriaans finished fourth in the Cobra. In fifth were Kalff and Campagne again, also winning the touring car class from Hemmo Vriend in his Ford Falcon Sprint, with Phil Anning third in the first of the Mini Coopers. GTS11 was a Porsche 911 benefit, but this time Thijs and Theo van Gammeren were victorious with Erwin van Lieshout second and Holger Felske holding up MGB honours in third. What about the Lotus Elans? They lived up to their reputation of being fast but fragile. We started the weekend with six of them but only one survived to the end, it was Alex Korle who deservedly took home the GTS10 winners’ trophy.\n\nResults: Results – Super Sixties Racing\n\nThe latest paddock gossip: NKHTGT Assen magazine V2\n\nCheck our YouTube channel for action clips: https://www.youtube.com/@Supersixties\n\nHi-res photo download: https://we.tl/t-9HnMjnHXKS\n\nQualifying\n\nTurn 7 was the deciding factor in the SuperSixties qualifying session at Spa-Francorchamps, with many track limit infringements and some more serious excursions that resulted in loads of gravel on the track. Through it all came the Peter Thompson/Charles Allison TVR Griffith to claim pole from Kennet Persson in the Ford GT40. Andy Newall qualified Rhea Sautter’s E-type in 3rd with Bob Stevens 4th in the first of the Lotus Elans. Next up were the three Shelby varieties, Armand Adriaans (Cobra), Roelant de Waard (Mustang GT350) and Oliver Douglas (Cobra Daytona). Michiel Campagne only managed a lowly 8th position in the Corvette Grand Sport, and could be expected to be nearer the front in the race. Then it was more Lotus Elans, mixed with the fastest of the touring cars: Luc de Cock (Elan), Carlo Hamilton (Ford Falcon), Jos Stevens (Elan), Bas Jansen (Ford Mustang), Niek van Gils (Elan) and Bijleveld/van der Ende (Ford Falcon). Eric Douart in his 2-litre BMW is not far behind the V8 Fords. The Mini’s were fast with Jop Rappange ahead of René de Vries, then Dieter-Karl Anton in his Lotus Cortina, fastest in CT08, Alexander Schlüchter (Mini) and the Van Leenen/Du Toy van Hees and Ralf Wagner Lotus Cortina’s. In GTS11 Erwin van Lieshout was fastest in his Porsche 911, ahead of the MGB’s led by Frank Veenstra.\n\nRace 1 – mighty TVR\n\nA safety car to remove the stranded Mini Marcos of Greg Carini caused chaos in the first SuperSixties race at the Spa Summer Classic. Many drivers decided to pit when the yellow flags came out, which was a good idea, but several did so before the pit window was actually open, which was of course penalised. They received a draconic 5-minute penalty. Kennet Persson had been leading in the Ford GT40, closely followed by the TVR Griffith of Peter Thompson and Michiel Campagne in the Corvette GS. The big Corvette lost its brakes while circulating slowly during the neutralisation and dropped to fourth. Armand Adriaans took the opportunity to take the final podium spot and first in GTS12 in the Shelby Cobra. After Bob Stevens was an early retirement, it was Luc de Cock who came 5th overall and first in class, followed by Niek van Gils, Philippe Vermast and Jos Stevens all in Lotus Elans. Rhea Sautter was classified 9th in the E-type because the other three cars on the lead lap were penalised. Carlo Hamilton won the touring car class in his Ford Falcon ahead of similarly mounted Jaap van der Ende and Bas Jansen in his Mustang. Jop Rappange was first on the road in the Mini class but collected a penalty which handed the win to René de Vries from Alexander Schlüchter, who had an entertaining ding-dong battle with Dennis Bron in his MGA twin cam. CT08, the Lotus Cortina class, had a trio of pit window offenders… as a result the win went to Van Leenen/Du Toy van Hees, from Dieter-Karl Anton, Magnus Lillerskog and Ralf Wagner. In GTS11 Erwin van Lieshout started from the pits in the Porsche 911 and overtook all the MGB’s to win the class from Frank Veenstra and Arnold Herreman. Finally, it is interesting to have a look at the smaller GTP cars. The Marcoses of Mark Dols and Greg Carini dropped out. Rob Rappange spun on the first lap, but still went on to finish in the Porsche 904. Frank Weidema followed him home in his little 1,3 litre Marcos, a great result in his debut race.\n\nRace 2 – Persson is the person in charge\n\nIt took some 10 minutes for Sunday’s SuperSixties race to get properly underway. The delay was caused by several stranded cars on the grid and the formation lap, plus an unfortunate startline incident. When the field was finally released, Kennet Persson took the lead from the Thompson/Allison TVR, only relinquishing it for a short time when he pitted early, Michiel Campagne taking over in the Corvette GS. At the flag the Swede had a 20 second lead from the TVR, with Campagne another 20 seconds behind, closely followed by Adriaans in the Shelby Cobra. Roelant de Waard came 5th and 3rd in GTS12 in his Shelby Mustang. In GTS10 father and son Jos and Bob Stevens shared the orange Lotus Elan. Jos kept Luc de Cock’s yellow Elan in his sight, so that after the compulsory pitstop Bob could reel him in and pass him for the class win. SuperSixties debutant Felix Feltes came third in this well contested class, ahead of Marc Morawietz. In GTS11 it was no surprise that Erwin van Lieshout took the win in his Porsche 911. Tiziane and Fabienne Mutschler came second in the fastest of the MGB’s ahead of David Waterhouse. Greg Carini made up for his retirement in the first race by slicing through the field to 12th in his little Mini Marcos, winning the invitation class. The big V8 touring cars all had some sort of trouble. Martin Bijleveld came out on top in his Ford Falcon, Hemmo Vriend was second in another Falcon and Bas Jansen salvaged 3rd in his Mustang. The Mini Coopers made their own show, with René de Vries, Jop Rappange and Alexander Schlüchter trading places. Schlüchter spun and De Vries had to pit with a flat tire, so Jop looked to have it in the bag, but then the white Mini gave up the ghost with 2 laps to go, so Alexander took home the trophy. In CT08 it was the old fox from Austria, Dieter-Karl Anton, who was unbeatable, with Ralf Wagner, van Leenen/du Toy van Hees and Magnus Lillerskog chasing him, all in Lotus Cortina’s. Running like clockwork but unable to challenge the Cortina brigade were the two Alfa Giulias of Günter Zahnenbenz and François Leloutre.\n\nResults: Results – Super Sixties Racing\n\nSuperSixties Magazine Spa edition: NKHTGT Spa V2 high res\n\nSuperSixties actie op YouTube: Supersixties – YouTube\n\nQualifying\n\nIs the Red Bull Ring a power track? It certainly looked like it judging by the qualifying results. On the front row we found Jan Kling and Kennet Persson in a pair of GT40’s. Kaj Dahlbacka made it an all-Swedish top 3 with his Corvette Grand Sport. Next was Michiel Campagne, similarly mounted. In fifth we found the giant killing Bob Stevens in his Lotus Elan, followed by more V8 grunt, the Cobras of Adriaans/Adriaans and Bas Jansen, then Michel van Duijvendijk in the TVR Griffith and Roelant de Waard in the Shelby Mustang. Jos Stevens would start 10th in his Lotus Elan. In GTS11 the Van Gammeren Porsche 911 was much faster than the MGB opposition. In TC it was V8’s to the fore as well, the Van Gammeren, Deenik/Sinke and Vriend V8 Ford Falcons leading the way. Old hand Dieter-Karl Anton made up for his Hockenheim problems by easily outqualifying the CT08 opposition in his Lotus Cortina. In CT07, the De Vries Mini had the upper hand.\n\nRace 1: Campagne beats the Swedes\n\nThe first SuperSixties race at the Red Bull Ring was quite eventful. The four GTP cars pulled away at the front, Michiel Campagne snatching the lead from fast starting Kennet Persson. In the battle for third Kaj Dahlbacka made contact with Jan Kling’s GT40 and came off worse, retiring with a flat tire. When Persson dropped out with a blown engine, Campagne in the Corvette Grand Sport had a big lead from Kling. Bas Jansen drove a strong race to take the final podium spot in his GTS12 Cobra. Bob Stevens beat Michiel van Duijvendijk (TVR Griffith) and Roelant de Waard (Shelby Mustang) to finish 4th overall and first in GTS10 in his 1,6 litre Lotus Elan. In GTS11 the winner was Thijs van Gammeren in the Porsche 911. The Deenik/Sinke Ford Falcon was fastest of the touring cars when\n\nCarlo Hamilton dropped out, although after 40 minutes of racing Jaap van der Ende was just 4 seconds behind, with Hemmo Vriend another 10 seconds back. Highly experienced local racer Dieter-Karl Anton was unbeatable in CT08 in his Lotus Cortina, showing a clean pair of heels to Van Leenen/Du Toy van Hees and Lillerskog. In CT07 the De Vries father and son team took the spoils\n\nfrom Jop Rappange and his father Rob, all in Mini’s of course. Finally, it was great to see Frits Campagne in his Ford Anglia chasing Graziano Tessaro in his Abarth 1000, until the little Fiat retired after 35 minutes. Interestingly all the new drivers kept their noses clean while some of the more experienced guys returned to the paddock somewhat battle scarred. As usual, it was nothing a beer,\n\nsome duct tape and a friendly evaluative talk couldn’t fix.\n\nRace 2: Bas Jansen in a class of his own\n\nSuperSixties was Sunday’s curtain closer at the Red Bull Ring and got underway with an exciting start, with Michiel Campagne, Jan Kling and Bas Jansen trading places at the front. Jansen had just managed to pass the two GTP cars to take the lead in his Cobra when the red flags came out. This was due to the Team Korle Cortina losing its diff oil going into the first corner. After the restart, with 30 minutes remaining, Campagne, Kling and Jansen were at it again, with the blue Corvette holding a small lead as Jansen attempted to pass Kling. Kaj Dahlbacka had moved up from 31st to 7th when the red flags came out. With the restart from the original grid positions, he had to do it all again! On lap 10 Campagne had a small off in turn 3. When he steered back on track his\n\nrear wheel got stuck behind the curbs, wrecking the diff. Now Kling and Jansen were battling for the lead, and they did so with gusto, switching positions several times per lap. When Kling had a half spin, Jansen finally managed to pull away and take a well-deserved win. By the time the pit window opened, Dahlbacka was already in third, but he could not close the gap to the leaders. Armand Adriaans finished fourth in the Shelby Cobra, with Bob Stevens in the GTS10 winning Lotus Elan just 1,6 seconds behind. Thijs van Gammeren made it two out of two in GTS11 in the Porsche 911, ahead of the MGB’s of Holger Felske and the Mütschler sisters. Jaap Sinke had a tense moment when his Ford Falcon was inadvertently tapped into a spin by Mark Dols in his Marcos. Luckily, he had enough time in hand to stay ahead of Hemmo Vriend’s Falcon, while Frans van Maarschalkerwaart was third touring car home in a borrowed Ford Mustang. Dieter-Karl Anton dominated CT08 again in his Lotus Cortina. In CT07 De Vries-De Vries were the only remaining Mini, but they went flat out regardless, 5th of the touring cars. Finally, Frits Campagne and Graziano Tessaro entertained the crowd by battling for last place, until the little Fiat had lost too much of its oil and had to retire.\n\nResults: Results – Super Sixties Racing\n\nRead all the paddock gossip in our online magazine: nkhtgt.nl/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NKHTGT-RedBullRing-magazine-V2.pdf\n\nQualifying\n\nSuperSixties was pleased to back at the Historic Zandvoort Trophy for the next instalment of our 2023 season. Sander van Gils was the fastest guy on track in qualifying, but he was too eager, going all out before the session had actually started. It would give him something to do in the afternoon, as he was docked 5 places on the grid as a result. We still had an all Lotus Elan front row, with Luc de Cock on pole and Jos Stevens second. Roelant de Waard claimed third on the grid in his Shelby Mustang with Peter Brouwer in yet another Elan alongside. Henk van Gammeren and Hemmo Vriend were first of the touring cars in their Ford Falcons, while Armand Adriaans (Shelby Cobra), Jaap Sinke (Big Healey) and Wilhelm-van Gelder (Jag E-type) completed the top-10. Quickest in GTS11 was the Van Gammeren Porsche 911, just ahead of more touring cars, Rob Rappange fastest in CT07 in his Mini ahead of the Van Leenen/Du Toy van Hees CT08 Lotus Cortina. Next up was the oldest car in the field, Dennis Bron in his FabFifties MGA twincam, followed by guest driver Onno Vlaanderen in a LateSixties Davrian Imp. With 29 cars on the grid we looked forward to an action packed pair of races.\n\nRace 1: van Gils unbeatable\n\nSander van Gils dominated Saturday’s SuperSixties race at Zandvoort in his Lotus Elan. From sixth on the grid, he took the lead on the first ascent of the Hunserug. Luc de Cock held second for most of the race until his engine lost power towards the end and he slipped back. Jos Stevens had been shadowing him and duly took second in his Lotus Elan while Roelant de Waard came third in the Shelby Mustang. Peter Brouwer was fourth in his Lotus Elan with De Cock fifth. First of the touring cars was the Van Gammeren Falcon in sixth, ahead of Armand Adriaans (Shelby Cobra), Ed van Dijk (E-type), Hemmo Vriend (Ford Falcon) and Jaap Sinke (Austin-Healey 3000). There was plenty of Mini action with some great scraps, and it was Rob Rappange who came out on top, with Alexander Schlüchter in second while Jop Rappange misfired his way into third and Bert Mets dropped out after 16 laps. GTS11 was initially led by Niek van Gils in the MGB, but after the pitstops it was the Theo/Thijs van Gammeren Porsche 911 that took the class win, from Van Gils and Egbert Kolvoort in their MGB’s. The Team Korle Lotus Cortina turned into a starting money special (if only we had starting money…). It only just made it across the line before expiring, which was a shame as the team had spent a fortune on duct tape patching it up after a qualifying mishap. So the win in CT08 went to Van Leenen/Du Toy van Hees, although Magnus Lillerskog actually finished ahead of them. He was going so well that he did not want to spoil his fun by making a pitstop. He was penalized two laps, even though he proposed to compensate by making two pitstops in Sunday’s race…\n\nRace 2: Jos Stevens against the odds\n\nJos Stevens overcame a couple of penalties to win the second SuperSixties race at Zandvoort in his Lotus Elan. He braked after moving before the lights changed, so gained nothing and it was in fact Roelant de Waard who took the lead. Stevens realized he was going to be penalized, so quickly passed the blue Shelby Mustang and started to build up a lead. Meanwhile De Waard was harried by Peter Brouwer and Luc de Cock. When he outbraked himself going into Tarzan the two nimble Lotus’ took their chance and passed him. Unfortunately they both dropped out with ignition trouble later in the race. Meanwhile Stevens had gained another time penalty for a pitstop infringement, but he kept his foot down and finished far enough ahead of De Waard to hang on to first place. Armand Adriaans drove a steady race and claimed the final podium spot in his Shelby Cobra. Fourth past the flag was Jaap Sinke in the Healey, just ahead of a storming Ed van Dijk in his Jaguar E-type. He was being cheered on by a crowd of Jaguar Club members to great effect! The Van Gammeren family again took the spoils in the touring car class in their big Ford Falcon Futura. Seventh fell to the French Jaguar team of Erwin van Gelder/Bernard Wilhelm who just managed to hold off Mats Ek in his Lotus Elan. There were some fierce midfield battles involving a lot of cars. Dennis Bron came through to finish 9th in his MGA. Rob Rappange, Alexander Schlüchter and Jasper Izaks were in the middle of the mayhem in their Mini’s. In the end Schlüchter was victorious while the other two dropped out. All the MGB’s also suffered various problems giving the Van Gammeren Porsche 911 an easy ride in GTS11. The Lotus Cortinas were in combat with Bert Mets in his Mini Cooper. Van Leenen-Du Toy van Hees again came out on top after Magnus Lillerskog suffered a broken halfshaft two laps from the flag. So ended another great weekend of action packed SuperSixties races. Everything went smoothly, thanks to a great bunch of well-behaved and friendly drivers! Yes there were loads of retirements due to mechanical problems, so there is plenty of wrenching to be done, but we expect everyone to be back for the Red Bull Ring on June 9-11. See you there!\n\nResults: Results – Super Sixties Racing\n\nRead all the paddock gossip in our online magazine: https://www.nkhtgt.nl/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/NKHTGT-Zandvoort-magazine-final-version-klein.pdf"
