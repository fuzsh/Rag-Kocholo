        "text": "Emely de Heus - Dutch driver competing in single-seaters around Europe. 2021 is her first season of senior racing and she entered the Spanish F4 championship, driving for the MP Motorsport team. Previously, she was active in international karting as both a junior and senior driver. Her best result in a single-seater was a fourteenth place at Valencia and she was 29th in the championship. Despite this, she was accepted as a W Series driver for 2022, with the Sirin team. Her best finish in the shortened seven-round season was tenth at Miami, in the first race of the season. After the demise of W Series in early 2023, she was announced as a driver for F1 Academy, an F4-level women's racing series. She drove for MP Motorsport and won one race at Catalunya. Her final championship position was ninth. Earlier in the year, she had done the F4 UAE championship for the same team, but was unplaced. She comes from a motorsport family; her father Bert races GT cars."
