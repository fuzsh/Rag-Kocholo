        "text": "Ferrari automobiles have always been present at the Essen Motor Show, the worlds most important fair for the tuning trade and motorsports, since the expositions first edition back in 1968.\n\n55 Years of Ferrari in Formula One 1948-2003\n\nSeveral times already, \"Ferrari\" had been the subject of spezial exhibitions or displays at the Essen Motor Show, and in 2003 there were even two different display areas that were dedicated to our favorite marque: In the so-called Show-Center that houses exhibits ranging from show tuning and custom cars via historical and classic cars to vehicles that made recent history in motorsports, a large display area was named 55 Years of Ferrari in Formula One 1948-2003, and in hall 6, where dealers from the classic and exotic car trade usually offer numerous automobiles, the organising S.I.H.A. Exhibition Ltd. had arranged a nice presentation named Ferrari - La Passione, dedicated to Ferrari road- and sports racing cars.\n\nFormula One by Shell and Vodafone\n\nThe Formula One exposition was sponsored by Shell and Vodafone, both official suppliers and / or sponsors of the Scuderia Ferrari. The entire section of the Show-Center was held in yellow as a combined tribute to the colour of the city of Modena and Shell. Number and variety of the Formula One Ferraris on display were tremendous and was probably surpassed only by the display of monoposti during Ferraris own 50 Years Celebration in Rome in 1997! 18 Ferrari Formula One cars were on show, the oldest being the 1954 500/625 Monoposto of Swiss Jo Vonlanthen, and the most recent was an F2002.\n\nA real surprise was the presence of the impressive 1952 375 Formula One with chassis number 5 from the Dutch van der Lof collection: This rare and valuable Formula Ferrari had not be seen in public since the passing of Dries van der Lof in 1989.\n\nUwe Meissners Modena Motorsport Ltd. of Langenfeld/Germany, newly appointed official F1 Clienti service station (the first ever outside Maranello), had been very helpful in the organisation of this remarkable display, too, having supplied several examples either from customers or from their own stock.\n\nFurthermore, the famous 550 Maranello-based study Pininfarina Rossa was on display in the Show-Center, too.\n\nFerrari - La Passione\n\nThe Ferrari  La Passione stand of S.I.H.A. Ltd. Was held in white and red and offered a variety of Ferrari racecars, GTs and road going models. The renowned longtime collector Hartmut Ibing did not only provide his 250 GTO 62 and his 250 LM, but did also show his very rare 275 GTB/4 with all-alloy body  for the first time in public! This wonderful Ferrari with chassis number 10207 is one of only 17 examples of the 275 GTB/4 that were supplied new with a weight-saving bodywork. Most of these few 275 GTB/4s were intended for GT racing by their owners back in 1966 and 1967; likewise s/n 10207: German privateer Ric Weiland, a jeweller of Mainz, did some hillclimbs and airfield races in this car.\n\nCollector Peter Gläsel displayed his dark red 250 Testa Rossa Spider Scaglietti, and Michael Trösser had brought his little 166 MM/53 Barchetta to Essen. This Ferrari with chassis number 0264M was supplied new in 1953 as one of only two examples with a factory-made bodywork that resembled the styling of the later Scaglietti Spider coachwork seen on the 500 Mondial and 750 Monza. After a racing career, the original body was removed during a restoration and replaced by a new one similar to a Touring Barchetta.\n\nArnold Gardemann, the president of the German Ferrari Club (Ferrari Club Deutschland e.V.) provided his F50 and his Enzo Ferrari for the show, while authorized Ferrari dealer Helmut Eberlein of Kassel/Germany did show a silvergrey 250 GT Lusso and an F40 from his current stock.\n\nAnother rare Ferrari had its German premiere as well: The dark red 250 GT California Spider SWB, chassis number 4121GT, had been imported from California in late summer by Klaus Werner of Wuppertal. This example features a rare hardtop and had been with its last owner for about 30 years! A 330 GTC from Belgium completed this special Ferrari display."
