        "text": "Immersed, as I currently am, racing F.2 events from the 1952 season, I’ve been surprised to see the H.W.M. team running Yves Giraud-Cabantous in several races.\n\nI just wonder if this was an early case of a driver buying a ride, a way to get another entry in, predominately, French races or simply a case of the team running a man with a lot of European circuit experience.\n\nDoubtful if anyone would know for sure almost 70 years later but I’d be interested in different opinions.\n\nThat was the year of the Grands Prix de France series, and to me it looks like a combination of HWM trying to please the French for letting them run as a works team, and the organizers probably 'suggesting' to the team that it would be easier to get entries accepted with a French driver.\n\nHe only missed one of the French races that year - the Circuit du Lac at Aix - and that was the weekend before Le Mans, where he drove a works Nash-Healey. His only other sports car race that year seems to have been the Tour de France, also for Healey.\n\nAs comparative neophytes in Europe, it would no doubt have been helpful for HWM to have someone on the ground who was experienced in dealing with the local organisers.\n\nAccording to Doug Nye in the \"Autocourse history of the Grand Prix Car 1945-65,\" George Abecassis told him that Giraud-Cabantous \"couldn't drive a nail into a piece of wood.\" Nye also pointed out that HWM's entry was accepted while many others were rejected, so perhaps having a Frenchman on the team was necessary to ensure that they would be allowed to participate.\n\nSimon Taylor in his book about HWM states that Giraud-Cabantous choice as a driver for the French series was because he \"lived locally and thus attracted excellent start money\". And adds that \"he [Giraud-Cabantous] was a stalwart of the HWM team in French races, usually earned good start money from nationalistic race organisers, and was a safe, reliable racer\". Not sure about the \"nationalistic\", Grand Prix at the time was not the international sport of today, thus it would make sense for the organisers to insist in having drivers that were sufficiently known locally and therefore were crowd-pullers. More business acumen than egregious patriotism, I believe. In any case, HWM used quite often local drivers for local races (SImon in France, Frère and Laurent in Belgium, Van der Lof and Roosdorp in the Netherlands, for instance). As it used British drivers in British soil. The reason the same as the organisers: money.\n\nHeath and Abecassis were offered the services of a 'local' driver with concomitant start money advantage. The entire HWM saga was a wonderful exercise in making a sporting and engineering enthusiasm pay for itself as far as was possible. From flogging part-worn racing tyres, quality oil and sparking plugs to eager under-supplied French, Belgian, Swiss, Dutch, Italian racers, and more, to mounting a largely very effective charm offensive upon organisers everywhere from Naples to the Nurburgring, and Aix-les-Bains to Les Sables d'Olonne, the Walton-on-Thames duo stormed Continental racing more effectively - in earning their keep - than any other British team. Accepting a locally significant driver for events whose organisers were eager to have them participate - when no suitable car was otherwise available for them - was a costs-covering (and on a good day profit-making) no-brainer.\n\nDCN\n\nDutch racing driver Herman Roosdorp was announced to race for HWM in the 1951 Dutch GP. That year of course not yet part of the world championship. This third HWM, that was even to be painted orange for this race, was, as the press wrote, assigned to him. The Royal Dutch Automobile Club (KNAC) wanted to attract more spectators than the years before. Roosdorp was favored as he had won some sports car races in his orange Ferrari 166 MM at Zandvoort. During practice when Etancelin put a 1'54\"3 down in first practice, Roosdorp only got as far as 2'11\"5.\n\nFrom HWM side it was found better if the more experienced John Heath would take the wheel for the race. Other sources claim that Roosdorp found the HWM to be too slow. Heath ended up last in the race, 8 laps down on winner Rosier.\n\nIn the 500cc class Moss drove easily to a 2'01 in his Kieft. While in the same class also pilot Major Jan Flinterman participated in a Cooper, lapping 2'10\"4.\n\nFor 1952 the KNAC managed to reach an agreement for Dries van der Lof to race a HWM in the Dutch GP. Also a seat was found by the KNAC in a Maserati of the Escurie Automobilistica Bandeirantes team for Maus Gatsonides however as Gatso got ill he was replaced by Flinterman\n\nJust to split a hair, didn't drivers paying, one way or another, feature from the earliest days of racing?\n\nI recall an Italian chap who set up a rent-a-drive scheme in the 1920s for rich gentlemen, one which helped fund poorer (usually more talented) drivers in his cars and riders on his motorcycles. The combination of driver fees, prize money from his professionals and trade sponsorship, plus friendly deals from car manufacturers, set him up well for a few years. I wonder what happened to him."
