        "text": "The wedding of Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia and Rebecca Bettarini will take place in St Petersburg on October 1, 2021.\n\nIt will be the first imperial wedding in Russia since the wedding of Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna in 1917.\n\nGrand Duchess Maria Pavlovna was the first child and only daughter of Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia and his first wife, Grand Duchess Alexandra Georgievna of Russia, born Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark. She was therefore a granddaughter of Emperor Alexander II.\n\nShe was a paternal first cousin of Nicholas II (Russia’s last Emperor) and maternal first cousin of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (consort of Queen Elizabeth II).\n\nIn September 1917, during the period of the Russian Provisional Government, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna married Prince Sergei Putyatin. They had one son, Prince Roman Sergeievich Putyatin, who died in infancy. The couple escaped revolutionary Russia through Ukraine in July 1918.\n\nPreviously, in 1908, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna married Prince Wilhelm, Duke of Södermanland, the second son of King Gustaf V of Sweden and his wife Victoria of Baden.\n\nThe couple had only one son, Prince Lennart, Duke of Småland later Count Bernadotte af Wisborg. The marriage was unhappy and ended in divorce in 1914."
