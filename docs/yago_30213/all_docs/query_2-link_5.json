        "text": "January 27, 1708 birth of Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia.\n\nhttps://www.artuk.org/discover/artworks/anna-petrovna-17081728-87052\n\nAnna was the daughter of Peter the Great. Her father was married twice, and she was his daughter by his second marriage. Her mother Empress Catherine I was born Martha Skavronskaya. Her mother was a Polish-Lithuanian peasant who had been her father's mistress from 1702-1704. Anna was born before her parents were married. Though rumors of a secret marriage in 1707 exist, they were officially married in 1712 when she was four. Her father's first wife was Tsarina Eudoxia Feodorovna Lopukhina. Her father had divorced his first wife and placed her in a convent. Her mother took the name Catherine when she joined the Orthodox church and was later crowned empress by her husband.\n\nHer father had 14 children between his two wives. Only 3 of them reached adulthood (3 children from his first wife and 11 from Catherine). Her brother Alexei (son of Eudoxia) was the father of Peter II, he himself dying in prison during his father's life time. Her sister Elisabeth would serve as Empress of Russia from 1741-1762.\n\nThough her father had her legitimized when he married, her former status caused some issues for her marriage in the future.\n\nShe grew up in the households of her Aunt Natalya Alexeyevna of Russia (Peter's sister) and of Prince Aleksander Danilovich Menshikov.\n\nWishing to marry his daughters into European monarchies their father saw to them being well educated. Anna was very intellectual and well read. She studied literature and writing, and learned four languages: German, French, Swedish and Italian. She was said to be a true beauty, and both in her dark hair and in her behavior she was very much her father's daughter. She was shy but said to be beautiful inside and out.\n\nThe chosen husband for Anna was Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. He came to Russia to meet her in 1721. Anna was 14 and her future husband was 21 years old. He was seeking to have her father's support in gaining Schleswig back from Denmark.\n\nThree years later on November 22 1724 the marriage contract was signed. Anna and her husband had to renounce any claim to the Russian throne when they signed it though. Her father died in January 1725 before the two were formally married. And her mother became reigning empress. Catherine saw to a grand wedding for her daughter and Karl Friedrich. They had a grand wedding at Trinity Cathedral. The couple would spend the next two years living in Russia where her husband was given a position on the privy counsel, and took a place in the Russian army.\n\nJanuary 25, 1727 the couple finally left Russia and headed for Kiel. Her husband who had been charming and kind in Russia, changed once home. He was a drunken boor of a man who spent his time with friends and mistresses once away from Anna's mother's court.\n\nSadly Anna would not survive the move long. Shortly after giving birth to her only child she caught childbed fever and died March 4, 1728 at 26. Her husband would found the order of St Anna in her name.\n\nAnna had made it known she wished to be buried next to her father. Two ships were sent to retrieve her body and bring it home. She was buried next to both her parents in the still unfinished St Peter and St Paul Cathedral November 12, 1728. Her mother had passed away in May 1727).\n\nHer husband would die in 1739 but he would never remarry. He is buried in Bordesholm. Like his wife he never saw their son take the throne.\n\nThe couple had one son:\n\n-Charles Peter: he would succeed to the Russian throne as Peter III after the death of his childless aunt Empress Elisabeth. He became emperor in 1762, almost 34 years after his mother died. Peter was married to Catherine the Great and had one Paul. He was over thrown and died. Anna's grandson Paul would eventually become Emperor Paul I.\n\nFebruary 15, 1922 death of Princess Catherine Dolgorukova, morgantic wife of Emperor Alexander II of Russia.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Dolgorukov#/media/File:Princess_Catherine_Dolgorukov.jpg\n\nCatherine was born November 14, 1847 in Volhynian Governorate which at the time was part of the Russian empire (the area is now split between Poland and the Ukraine). She was the daughter of Prince Michael Dolgorukov and Vera Vishnevskaya.\n\nCatherine first met Alexander in 1859 when he visited her father's estate. She was only 11 at the time but he remembered meeting her. Alexander was 41 at the time and married to Marie of Hesse. The couple had been married for 18 years and had 6 living children at the time (their eldest daughter had died at age six, and their youngest son was born in 1860). Catherine was in fact born the same year as the couple's fourth child Vladimir (Vladimir was seven months older then Catherine). She was 4 years younger then Alexander's eventual heir, his third child and second son Alexander (Nicholas would die in 1865).\n\nWhen her father died penniless she was sent with her sister to St Petersberg to a school for well-born girls. Her mother arranged for the education of her daughters and her four sons to be paid for by the emperor.\n\nAlexander met her again at age 16 at the school and started visiting her. He would take her on walks and carriage rides. He later arranged to have her placed as a lady in waiting to Marie who was suffering from tb.\n\nThough her mother encouraged her to, she did not at first wish to be a mistress to the tsar. But after the death of his son Nicholas she started a relatioship. She was 18 at the time and he was 47.\n\nHe kept her close, especially after the birth of their children. She was brought to the Winter Palace several times a week and they wrote every day.They did their best to keep their relationship as private as posible. His family did not approve of her believing she was trying to become empress and had too much influence over the emperor.\n\nWhen the emperor feared she would be assasinated, he had Catherine and their children moved to the palace. The empress actually wished to meet with her husband's children, and the oldest two were brought to meet his wife.\n\nThe empress died in 1880 in May. He swore to marry Catherine when mourning was over and swore he would crown her empress a year later. She was made Most Serene Princess Yurievskaya, and her children were legalized. They were married July 18 but the marriage was extremely unpopular with the court and with his family. His family refused to recognize her at court as his wife. Their marriage was a happy one though very short, as they were deeply in love. The emperor wrote to family members of the joy being married to her finally.\n\nSadly Alexander was assassinated March of the following year. Bombers had attacked his carriage, and he died at home at the Winter Palace.\n\nCatherine was not allowed a place in her the imperial procession of her own husband's funeral. Nor were her or her children allowed to attend the funeral with the royal family.\n\nAfter her husband's death she gave up her residence at the Winter palace and any other royal residence and received a pension. She moved to Paris where she was known as a fashionable hostess. Her and her children continued to be scorned by her husband's family for the remainder of her life. She died 41 years after her husband died, just as her fortune ran out.\n\nShe is buried in the Russian Orthodox Cemetery, Nice.\n\nHer and Alexander had four children, all born before they were married:\n\n-George Alexandrovich Yuryevsky: He was refused to allow to join the army by his half brother Alexander III and joined the navy at first. His nephew Nicholas II was kinder to him, and permitted him to move to Russia and join the army. He married Countess Alexandra von Zarnekau who was a morgantic daughter of Duke Constantine Petrovich of Oldenburg. The only Russian royal at their wedding was Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich of Russia who was banished himself at the time due to his morgantic marriage. They had one son before they were divorced.George later died in Hesse. They have one grandson.\n\n-Olga: She was married to Count George-Nicholas von Merenberg. George was the son of Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau and his morgantic wife Natalia Pushkin (youngest daughter of Alexander Pushkin). Nada Mountbatten (married to Prince Philip's Uncle George, Marquis of Milford Haven) was George's niece, the daughter of his sister Sophie. She and her husband had 3 children, though one died in infancy.\n\n-Borris: died less then 2 months old.\n\n-Catherine: Married twice. Her first husband was Alexander Vladimirovich Baryatinsky. They had two sons together, her husband dying in 1910. In 1916 she married Prince Sergei Platonovich Obolensky . He left her in 1922 for Alice Astor after which she became a professional singer. She would eventually live in England where she lived off an income from Queen Mary for some years.\n\nFebruary 21st also marks the start of the Romanov dynasty of Russia as rulers. On that day in 1613 Mikhail Romanov was chosen as Emperor of Russia.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_of_Russia#/media/File:Tsar_Mikhail_I_-cropped.JPG\n\nIn 1598 the death of Tsar Feodor I of Russia issued in a period known as the Time of Troubles. This came to an end in 1613 when the Russian parliament chose Mikhail to be the new emperor.\n\nMikhail Romanov was not yet 17, his birthday July 22, 1596.\n\nHis father Feodor Nikitich Romanov had been a popular candidate for the throne when Feodor died. His father had served as a soldier and diplomat during the reign of Feodor who was his first cousin. His mother Xenia Shestova was the daughter of wealthy landowners. When Feodor I died, his father recognized the election of Borris Godunov as Tsar. Unfortunately the Romanov clan went into disgrace after three years. Both of Mikhail's parents were forced to take monastic vows, and his father was a virtual prisoner under Boris. He was set free by False Dmitry I and later appointed the Patriarch of Moscow by False Dmitry II. Mikhail's mother did not approve of her son being appointed the new Tsar, after the demise of the previous tsars, fearing for her young son.\n\nMikhail's father was the nephew of Tsarita Anastasia Romanovna. The wife of Ivan IV of Russia, she was the mother of Feodor I. Anastasia's brother Nikita Romanov was the father of Feodor, and grandfather of Mikhail. Nikita was an advisor to his brother in law, and regent to his nephew before his death.\n\nHe was crowned Tsar July 22, 1613.\n\nRussia saw its greatest territorial expansion during his reign which would last from 1613-1645. His 32 year reign was the start of a 304 year reign of the Romanov dynasty which came to an end with the execution of Nicholas II and his children.\n\nMikhail was married twice. His first marriage was to Princess Maria Vladimirovna Dolgorukova. She died four months after their marriage though. His second marriage was to Eudoxia Streshneva. Eudoxia was mother of his 10 children, and outlived her husband by less then a month (he would die July 23, 1645 and she would die August 18).\n\nOf their kids, only four reached adulthood, the rest died before age 6.\n\n-Irina: She was intended to marry Valdemar Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, a son of Christian IV and his morgantic wife Kristen Munk. But when Valdemar arrived he refused to convert to Orthodox and was imprisoned. He was released in 1645 and left when released. Irina remained single for life, mainly focussed on over seeing her estates.\n\n-Alexis: succeeded his father as tsar. Married twice. His first wife was Maria Ilyinichna Miloslavskaya who bore him 13 children. By the time she died in 1669 all but 4 of her sons were dead, and another 2 died not long after. Their son Ivan would serve as co-ruler with his younger half-brother Peter, as Ivan V. Ivan was the father of Empress Anna. Alexis would marry second Nataliya Kyrillovna Naryshkina with whom he had three children. Their eldest would become known as Peter the Great.\n\n-Anna: little is known of her life, as was common in those times for a daughter of the tsar, she lived in seclusion and never married. She doesn't seem to have played a role like Irina. She became a nun shortly before her death.\n\n-Tatiana: She had a good relationship with Alexis, and during the regency of her niece Sophie she was seen as a senior lady at court. She lost any influence when Peter took power and placed new reforms.\n\nMarch 3, 1876 birth of Maria of Greece, wife of Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia.\n\nMaria was born in Athens. She was the daughter of George I of Greece and Olga Constantinovna of Russia. Her paternal grandparents were Christian IX of Denmark and Louise of Hesse-Kassel. Her maternal grandparents were Grand Duke Constantine of Russia (son of Nicholas I and brother of Alexander II) and Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg. Her paternal Aunts and uncles included Frederick VIII of Denmark, Alexandra of the UK and Maria Feodorovna. Her father originally a Danish prince named William, came to the Greek throne in 1863.\n\nMaria's parents had eight children, of whom she was 5th born and 2nd daughter. All but a younger sister Olga made it to adulthood. Her siblings included Constantine I and Prince Andrew (father of Prince Philip). Her sister Alexandra also married into the Russian royal family, marrying Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia who was an Uncle of Nicholas II.\n\nTo tell her apart from her Aunt Empress Maria, she was called Greek Minnie.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princ...and_Denmark_with_her_parents_and_siblinsg.jpg\n\nHer parents were devoted to their children and provided a happy childhood. They were not rich by royal standards and lived a simpler life. While her dad could be demanding, he believed that all children should happy and lively. The kids were known to ride bicycles in the hallways of the palace, often with their father leading the way.\n\nThey were raised by English nannies and English was her first language. She was fluent in Greek. English, German and French.\n\nEvery two years the children would spend the summer with their paternal grandparents in Denmark. They would meet up with both their Russian and English cousins while there. She had lifelong friendships with her cousins Victoria of Great Britain and Xenia of Russia.\n\nAt 20 she was proposed to by King Alexander I of Serbia during the Olympics but she turned him down.He later married Draga Mašin, but he died childless seven years later in 1903.\n\nShe often visited Russia during her childhood with her mother, staying with her mother's parents. In 1894 she had been there to attend the wedding of her cousin Grand Duchess Xenia. She met Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia who was the brother of Xenia's husband, at the time. Michael was first cousins of her mother. His father Grand Duke Michael was was the younger brother of Olga's father Konstantine. She was quite attracted by Michael who was 13 years older then her, was not interested. The tables were turned though when in 1895 they were reunited at a ball and this time Michael was attracted to her. But she found him too old for her taste and boring, and turned down a proposal from him. Her mother was disappointed as she had hoped for a Russian marriage for her daughter.\n\nMichael was not to be dissuaded though. In 1896 Michael arrived in Greece quite intent still to marry her. He proposed to her once again while they were playing billiards and this time she agreed. Their engagement was announced April 4, 1896. They were meant to marry in the summer, but she kept putting it off until she called off the engagement all together. But Michael was not one to give up easily. Twice a year for five years Michael would propose to her. In 1900 she finally agreed to go through with it, and her mother hurried the wedding this time so she could not back out.\n\nThe couple were married on Corfu, with a very simple wedding and reception.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princ...nd_Grand_Duke_Gerge_Mihailovich_of_Russia.jpg\n\nThey spent their honeymoon on the Greek royal yacht in Italy and then Austria Hungary. Now known as Grand Duchess Maria Georgievna of Russia she was welcomed in her new home as one of the family. Her Aunt was of course empress, not to mention her mother being born a Grand Duchess of Russia. Her father had been the Empress' favorite brother.\n\nThey settled in apartments in the New Michael palace, home of her father in law. They shared the palace with his widowed father and two unmarried brothers to whom she became quite close. Having suffered an injury when he was younger her husband was unable to serve in the military and instead worked as director of the Alexander III museum. In 1903 her father in law suffered a serious stroke and would later move to France.\n\nShe traveled a great deal in the years to follow, including to Denmark, France and England but she made a yearly trip home to her beloved Greece.\n\nThey had a home built for themselves in Crimea known as Harax. The villa was inspired by her love for everything English.Finished in 1907 it was 45 rooms. It over looked the Black sea and was in walking distance from the emperor's home in the area. For seven years the couple lived quietly at their estate though they would travel to court for events.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Maria_of_Greece_and_Denmark#/media/File:Harax.jpg\n\nIn March 1913 Maria was devastated by the assasination of her beloved father.\n\nBy 1914 her marriage was distant. Her husband was a devoted father and husband, still in love with her. But for Maria the marriage has always been one of simple convenience, and she missed her home in Greece. In the summer she left for England with her daughter. It was said to be to help to improve the health of her daughter but in reality it was a trial separation from her husband. He accompanied them as far as Warsaw. Sadly it was the last time her husband would see his wife and daughters again.\n\nHe was meant to join them, the family settling in Harrogate, but the out break of WWI prevented it. She would actually start a hospital in Harrogate during the war. She had some nursing experience in Greece but she took the red cross nurse training and began nursing patients herself. Her hospital was such a success she would open a further two. Over 1200 patients were tended in her hospitals in 4 years. Her cousin George V was so impressed with her work that he awarded her the Royal Red Cross in 1915.\n\nThey moved to Grovesnor square, and she was very close to the British royals. She visited Queen Alexandra most evenings and played cards with her. Unfortunately the outbreak of the Russian revolution cut off her finances and she had to entrust the care of the hospitals to Alexandra. But her patients asked her to continue her work, and she remained director of the hospitals. Her and daughters had to move to a smaller residence. It was the support of her American sister in law Nancy Leeds which helped support them.\n\nIn 1918 her husband was arrested when he tried to leave for England. Through the Danish embassy Maria tried to have him released. Unfortunately her husband was shot January 13, 1919. Her brother in law Nicholas, her former brother in law Paul (married to her sister Alexandra, but her sister had died in 1891) and her half-Uncle Dmitri were also killed at the time.\n\nFollowing her widowhood she reverted to her Greek name. In 1920 when Constantine I was to be restored to his throne, Maria and her daughters joined him and other members of the family on the sail from Italy back to Greece. It was during this trip that she met the captain of the ship, Perikles Ioannidis. He was an admiral in the Greek navy and five years younger then Maria. She was quite smitten with the Greek admiral.\n\nShe settled in Greece and was close to CP George (future George II) wife Elizabeth unlike other members of the family. Her relationship with her own daughters was not good. They resented their mother having taken them from their father and the fact they had never seen him again before he died.\n\nDespite the objections of her children, she married Perikles in December 1922 in Germany.They returned to Greece but after the second republic in 1924 they would leave. They would live at her house in London she maintained, for a few years after that. She was a constant companion to Queen Alexandra in her last years of life, as she was her aunt's favorite. Following the death of Alexandra, she and her husband moved to Rome where they lived in Villa Attica. Much of her family had settled there. Her husband watched their finances, and they lived a very quiet life. She did make a trip in the 30s to the US to visit her daughters and grandchildren there.\n\nShe died December 14, 1940 in her beloved Athens. She was buried in the royal burial ground at Tatoi. Perikles would die in 1965. He had been made the military governor of the Dodecanese 7 years after his wife had died.\n\nHer children with Grand Duke George Michael:\n\n-Nina: She was married to Prince Paul Alexandrovich Chavchavadze who was in the direct male line of the last king of Georgia. They eventually settled in the US where she was an artist and he was an author . The couple had one son Prince David Chavchavadze. David was in the CIA as well as an author. He gave Nina four grandchildren and six great grand-children. She died in 1974 and her son died in 2014.\n\n-Xenia: She married twice. Her first husband was William Leeds. William's mother Nancy Leeds was by her second marriage, Princess Anastasia of Greece and Denmark by marriage to Maria's brother Christopher (the same Nancy who had helped support Maria and her daughters during the revolution financially). They lived at their estate Kenwood in the US and had one daughter Nancy. They were divorced in 1930. She later married Herman Jud in 1946. She died in 1962, survived by her second husband and her daughter. She had one granddaughter Alexandra. Her daughter died in 2006."
