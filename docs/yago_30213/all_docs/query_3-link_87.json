        "text": "Ancestors\n\nThis page has been accessed 1,727 times.\n\nBiography\n\nGrand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich Romanov (Russian: Дмитрий Павлович), was born prematurely on 18 September 1891 [6 Sep 1891] at Ilyinskoye, Russia. His mother, Princess Alexandra of Greece (Alexandra zu Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, Princess of Greece and Denmark), died almost immediately after giving birth to Dmitri\n\nOne therefore cannot blame Dmitri's father, Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich Romanov, for holding very mixed feelings toward his newborn son. Indeed the entire court of Tsar Nicholas II expressed its sincere sympathy for the Grand Duke Paul (the Tsar's uncle), because Princess Alexandra had been well liked at court.\n\nPeople could not be blamed, also, for recoiling somewhat when first presented with the tiny child who had caused so much sorrow and grief.\n\nImagine the disturbed emotions, then, when Grand Duke Paul soon found comfort in the arms of another woman -- a divorcee?\n\nWikipedia tells us:\n\n\"Dmitri and his sister, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, lived in St Petersburg with their father until 1902, when Grand Duke Paul married a divorced commoner, Olga Pistolkors, and was banished from Russia by the Emperor.\"\n\nFATHER EXILED BY THE TSAR\n\n\"Paul was not allowed to take the children with him into exile, so they were sent to live with their uncle, Grand Duke Sergei and their aunt, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna (the Empress's sister), in Moscow.\n\nMOVE TO MOSCOW\n\n\"The loss of their father and the sudden move to Moscow caused the children great distress. In her memoirs, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna (the Younger) describes Grand Duke Sergei as a stern disciplinarian, and his wife, Grand Duchess Elizabeth as a cold and unwelcoming presence,\"\n\nUNCLE ASSASSINATED\n\nOn 4 February 1905, his uncle the Grand Duke Sergei was assassinated. His aunt, the Grand Duchess Elizabeth, though widowed, continued to raise Dmitri and Maria alone.\n\nGUEST OF THE TSAR AT TSARSKOE SELO\n\nIn 1908, Dmitri's sister Maria Pavlovna became engaged to wed Prince William of Sweden. They were invited to live for a time at Tsarskoe Selo, where they became guests of Tsar Nicholas II and the Empress Alexandra. Dmitri later claimed that he formed a close bond with the Tsar, and looked upon him as a father figure.\n\nSISTER MARRIED TO PRINCE OF SWEDEN\n\nMarie was married at Tsarskoe Selo and then left Russia to live with her new husband in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nEDUCATION AT ST. PETERSBURG CAVALRY SCHOOL\n\nIn 1909 Dmitri left his aunt's care to move to St Petersburg. He lived at the Beloselsky-Belozersky Palace, and entered the Nikolaevskoe Cavalry School.\n\nUpon graduation in 1911, he was commissioned as a cornet in the Horse Guards Regiment, which his father had once commanded, and in which he had been enrolled at birth.\n\n1912 OLYMPICS\n\nHe is reputed to have been a very good equestrian, and competed in the 1912 Stockholm Olympics, finishing in seventh place.\n\nAFFAIR WITH BALLERINA VERA KARALLI\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Grand Duke Dmitri was certainly a lady's man. \"He would often have strong but overlapping relationships, as, for instance, with Natalia Brasova and the ballerina Vera Karalli, both of whom he saw in 1915 and 1916. (He would be reunited with both women in exile, and would briefly resume his relationship with Karalli.)\"\n\nMURDER OF RASPUTIN\n\nIn December1916, Dmitri participated in the murder of Gregory Rasputin at the Yussupov Palace. He invited his girlfriend, Vera Karalli, and his half-sister, Marianne von Pistohlkors, to attend the event, and several historians have agreed that Dmitri was probably one of the two shooters who killed Rasputin.\n\nEXILE TO PERSIA\n\nBut Dmitri was never tried or convicted of the murder. Rather, he was exiled from Russia by Tsar Nicholas II, and sent to serve in a cavalry unit on the Persian front. He served briefly under General Nikolai Baratov at his headquarters in the Persian city of Kazvin.\n\nAFFAIR WITH COCO CHANEL\n\nAfter the war, he was permitted to live in Britain for a short time, but after two years he moved to Paris. In 1921 he enjoyed a brief affair with Gabrielle \"Coco\" Chanel, who found Dmitri work as a champagne salesman.\n\nMARRIAGE TO AUDREY EMERY\n\nAfter bashing around Paris in the 1920s, enjoying the good life, Dmitri finally settled down and married an American heiress, Anna Audrey Emery, daughter of John Josiah Emery and Leila Alexander, on 21 November 1926 at Biarritz, France.\n\nIn the late 1920s, Grand Duke Dmitri became involved with the Union of Young Russians [Союз Младороссов], which, in 1935, became the Young Russia Party. It was a Russian nationalist group, modeled on Italian fascism, and formed with the express purpose of establishing a \"Soviet monarchy\" in Russia.\n\nHe joined this group as a stand in for Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich who, as pretender to the throne, could not affiliate himself directly with any political organization or party.\n\nIn 1929, Grand Duke Dmitri contracted tuberculosis, and his health began to suffer.\n\nDIVORCE\n\nHe and Anna Audrey Emery were divorced on 1 February 1937.\n\nDESCENDANTS\n\nAccording to Wikipedia: \"The two had a son, His Serene Highness, Prince Paul Romanovsky-Ilyinsky, who grew up in France, England and the United States, and served as a US Marine in the Korean War. In 1989 he was elected Mayor of Palm Beach, Florida, and thus became the only Romanov descendant known to have held elected public office. Following the fall of communist Russia in 1991, a delegation of Russian royalists approached Paul Ilyinsky and asked him to assume the title of Tsar, a position he declined.\"\n\nDEATH AND BURIAL\n\nGrand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich died on 5 March 1942, age 50, at Davos, Switzerland. There are rumors that he may have been murdered. But most historians accept that he died of natural causes at a Sanitarium for the treatment of tuberculosis and uremia.\n\nGrand Duke Dmitri was laid to rest in the Waldfriedhof, Davos. In the late 1950s his remains were transferred to Mainau, situated in Lake Constance, where they now rest beside his sister's in the Bernadotte family crypt.\n\nSources\n\nC.
