        "text": "Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark: August 30, 1870 – September 24, 1891), later known as Grand Duchess Alexandra Georgievna of Russia and was a member of the Greek royal family and of the Russian imperial family. She was the daughter of King George I of the Hellenes and Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia. She died of childbirth complications.\n\nEarly life\n\nPrincess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark was born on August 30, 1870 at Mon Repos, the summer residence of the Greek royal family on the island of Corfu. She was the third child and eldest daughter of King George I of Hellenes and his wife, Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia.\n\nAlexandra’s father was not a native Greek, but he had been born a Danish prince named Christian Wilhelm of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, a son of Christian IX, King of Denmark, and he had been elected to the Greek throne at the age of seventeen. Five of his sons (Constantine, George, Nicholas, Andrew and Christopher), and two daughters (Alexandra and Maria), attained adulthood.\n\nAlexandra’s mother, Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia, (whom I just featured on this blog) was the daughter of Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaievich of Russia and his wife Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg (whom I also just featured on this blog).\n\nThe Greek royal family was not wealthy by royal standards and they lived with simplicity. King George was a taciturn man, but contrary to the general approach of the time, he believed in happy rambunctious children. The long corridors of the royal palace in Athens were used by Alexandra and her siblings for all types of play and sometimes a “bike ride” would be led by the King himself. Raised by British nannies, English was the children’s first language, but they spoke Greek between themselves. They also learned German and French.\n\nAlexandra, nickname “Aline” within her family, or Greek Alix, to distinguish her from her aunt and godmother, Alexandra of Denmark, at the time The Princess of Wales and husband of the future King Edward VII of the United Kingdom, had a sunny disposition and was much loved by her family. “She had one of those sweet and lovable natures that endeared her to everybody who came in touch with her,” recalled her brother, Nicholas. “She looked young and beautiful, and ever since she was a child, life looked as it had nothing but joy and happiness in store for her.”\n\nAlexandra’s playmates were her brother Nicholas and her sister Maria, who followed her in age. Alexandra spent many holidays in Denmark visiting her paternal grandparents King Christian IX and Queen Louise of Denmark. In Denmark, Alexandra and her siblings met their Russian and British cousins in large family gatherings.\n\nMarriage and children\n\nWhen she was eighteen years old, she was married to Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia, her maternal first cousin once removed and the youngest child and sixth son of Emperor Alexander II and his first wife, Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine.\n\nGrand Duke Paul’s father, Emperor Alexander II of Russia, and Princess Alexandra’s grandfather, Grand Duke Constantine were brothers.\n\nThey had become close when Grand Duke Paul spent winters in Greece due to his frequent respiratory illnesses. The Greek royal family also frequently spent holidays with the Romanov family on visits to Russia or Denmark. Their engagement was announced on November 10, 1888. The wedding took place on June 17, 1889 in St. Petersburg, at the chapel of the Winter Palace.\n\nThey had two children:\n\nGrand Duchess Maria Pavlovna (1890–1958)\n\nGrand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich (1891–1942)\n\nDeath\n\nSeven months into her second pregnancy, Alexandra took a walk with her friends on the bank of the Moskva River and jumped directly into a boat that was permanently moored there, but fell as she got in. The next day, she collapsed in the middle of a ball from violent labour pains.\n\nShe gave birth to her son, Dimitri, lapsed into a fatal coma, and she died six days later in the Romanovs’ estate Ilyinskoe near Moscow. The Grand Duchess was buried in the Peter and Paul Cathedral, St. Petersburg. Her grieving husband had to be restrained from throwing himself into the grave with her.\n\nHer husband later morganatically remarried Olga Karnovich. Alexandra’s son would be involved in the murder of Grigori Rasputin, a favorite of Empress Alexandra Feodorvna, in 1916.\n\nIn 1939 during the reign of her nephew King George II of the Hellenes, the Greek government obtained permission from the Soviet government under Joseph Stalin to rebury Princess Alexandra in Greece. Her body was removed from the vault in Leningrad and transferred by a Greek ship to Athens. It was finally laid to rest near the Tatoi Palace. Alexandra’s marble tombstone over an empty tomb is still in its place in the Peter and Paul Cathedral."
