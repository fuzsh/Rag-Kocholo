        "text": "Hello everyone! I thought it would be nice to start a thread with informations about his unfortunate daughter of King George and Queen Olga\n\nShe was born in Corfu and was the first daughter of K George and Q Olga. she was nicknamed \" Aline\" and \" Greek Alix\" When she was 19 she got married to Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovitch and moved to Russia . She died during her second premature childbirth ( from eclapsia I think) aged 21. I believe that 's why Greece's first maternity clinic was named after her ( Maieutirion Alexandra). Her Children where Maria Pavlova the younger who was married to the Swedish Royal family and Dimitri Pavlovitch , one of Rasputin's murderers.\n\nHer brother Nicholas wrote about her \" She had one of those sweet and lovable natures that endearded everyone who came in touch with her. She was young and beuatiful, and ever since she was a child, life looked as if it had nothing but joy and happiness in store for her\".......\n\nthe \"blond princess\" ( she was often called that in Greece) was very much loved by Greeks for her sweetness and when she boarded to the ship to leave for Russia to get married people where actually crying at the port because she was leaving . A Greek poet Souris actually wrote a poem about this : \" if I ever go (to Athens) I 'll tell to Alexandra not to take this Russian for her Husband\" . She was so well liked that the government immediately agreed for a dowry and raised 400.000 drachmas ( which is a lot by today's standards) so that the could have financial security. .\n\nIt's such a pity that she perished so young and left two babies orphans...\n\nIndeed a loss. But it least she was fortunate enough to have lived in happiness until her death. She grew up in a stable and happy family where the parents loved each other and they both loved dearly their children, her marriage was a love match from both sides, she never faced serious difficulties in her life or a serious illness and she became the mother of a pretty and healthy baby girl ( She never had the chance to see Dimitri because she fell in a coma right after he was delivered). These things were not granted at that time, not even for princesses."
