Owned by the Gannett Company, WUSA is an affiliate of the CBS television network. WUSA's studios and transmitter are located in the Tenleytown neighborhood of Washington. [cite news |title=Digital Signal Sources |work=\"The Washington Post\" |date=2008-05-20 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2008/05/20/GR2008052000207.html?sid=ST2008051902978 ]\n\nHistory\n\nThe station officially went on the air on January 11, 1949 as WOIC-TV, and began full-time operations on January 16. It is the fourth-oldest station in the nation's capital. Its original owner was the Bamberger Broadcasting Service, a subsidiary of R.H. Macy and Company, which also owned WOR-AM-FM in New York City, and was working to put WOR-TV (now WWOR-TV) on the air at the same time. Nine days later, WOIC broadcast the first televised American presidential inaugural address, given by President Harry S. Truman.\n\nWOIC-TV picked up the CBS affiliation upon signing on, replacing WMAL-TV (channel 7, now WJLA-TV) as CBS's Washington outlet. But the Bamberger/Macy's ownership had other plans for their station: both WOIC and its New York sister station were scheduled to become affiliates of a planned television network operated by Mutual Radio. However, Mutual Television never made it to air, leaving channel 9 to remain a CBS station.\n\nIn June 1950, CBS teamed up with the \"Washington Post\" to purchase WOIC-TV from Bamberger/Macy's. The new owners, WTOP Incorporated (the \"Washington Post\" owned 55 percent, and CBS held the remaining 45 percent), changed the station's call sign to WTOP-TV, after its new sister stations WTOP radio (then at 1500 AM) and WTOP-FM (96.3 MHz., now WHUR-FM).\n\nIn July 1950, WTOP-TV became the first television station in Washington authorized to broadcast color television in the 405-line field sequential color standard, which was incompatible with the black-and-white 525-line NTSC standard. Color broadcasts would continue for nearly 30 months, when regulatory and commercial pressures forced the FCC to rescind its original color standard and begin the process of adopting the 525-line NTSC-3 standard, developed by RCA to be backwards compatible with the existing black-and-white televisions.\n\nIn 1954, the WTOP stations moved into a new facility, known as \"Broadcast House\", at 40th and Brandywine streets NW in Washington. The building was the first in the country designed as a unified radio and television facility. Its name was in honor of Broadcasting House, home of the BBC in London. The building was well-known to WTOP's president. since he had spent much of World War II assigned to the BBC. Previous to the move to Broadcast House, the radio stations operated out of the Earle Building (now the Warner Building, home of the Warner Theatre), and WTOP-TV had operated out of the small WOIC studios at the same location. When Broadcast House was completed and the new television studios were inaugurated, the old studio became the garage for Broadcast House and the old master control room became both the master control and transmitter room for channel 9, since Broadcast House had been built around the station's original, four-sided tower. People can still see the building with the tower in the middle at the same location, although it is now an office building and retail store front operated by Douglas Development Corp.\n\nThe WTOP-TV tower was well known in Washington for two things. First, at Christmas time, the tower was strung with Christmas lights and glowed brightly on top of Mount Reno, the tallest point in the District of Columbia. Second, the tower tended to sway much more than three-sided towers. In a strong wind the tower could be seen swaying back-and-forth, and during the winter ice from the tower fell quite often on the streets below.\n\nAlso in 1954, CBS sold its share of WTOP Inc. to the \"Washington Post\" to comply with the Federal Communications Commission's new seven-station-per-group ownership rule. CBS's partial ownership of WTOP radio and WCCO radio in Minneapolis exceeded the FCC's limit for AM stations. CBS opted to sell its share of WTOP, which it had purchased in whole in 1932 before selling controlling interest to the \"Post\" in 1949.\n\nAfter the sale closed, the \"Post\" merged the WTOP stations with its other broadcast property, WMBR-AM-TV in Jacksonville, Florida and changed the name of the licensee from \"WTOP Inc.\" to \"Post Stations, Inc.\" WMBR radio was sold off in 1958, and WMBR-TV became WJXT. The \"Post\" renamed its broadcasting group \"Post-Newsweek Stations\" in 1961 after the \"Post\" bought \"Newsweek\" magazine. Post-Newsweek acquired its third television station, WLBW-TV (now WPLG) in Miami in 1970 and in 1974 added WTIC-TV (now WFSB) in Hartford, Connecticut to the group.\n\nIn 1972 WTOP-TV joined with the Evening Star Broadcasting Company (owned by the \"Post's\" rival, the now-defunct \"Washington Star\" and licensee of WMAL-TV) to build the Joint Tower, a 1040-foot, three-sided tower across the alley from Broadcast House at 4010 Chesapeake Street, NW. Transmission lines were extended from Broadcast House's transmitter area to the new tower for both WTOP-TV and WHUR-FM (the former WTOP-FM, which had been donated by Post-Newsweek to Howard University in 1971). The old tower continued to serve as the backup antenna for channel 9 until the station sold Broadcast House in 1996.\n\nIn 1974, WTOP and the other Post-Newsweek stations adopted the slogan \"The One and Only\". The moniker was part of a trend toward group identification of stations, with each station being \"The One and Only Channel (channel number)\". Staff members from the \"One and Only\" period usually refer to themselves as \"the one and onlies\" as a source of pride. The slogan was dropped from active use in the late 1990s and has not been used as part of an image campaign since 1996. The slogan no longer appears on the air, but was revived in a sense when channel 9 adopted its current slogan, \"First and Only with Local News in HDTV.\"\n\nIn July 1978 Post-Newsweek exchanged WTOP-TV with the Evening News Association's WWJ-TV (now WDIV) in Detroit. Upon completion of the swap, WTOP-TV changed its call letters to WDVM-TV, with the new call letters representing the initials of the areas which channel 9 serves: D for the District of Columbia, V for Virginia, and M for Maryland. The \"Washington Post\" and the Evening News Association, which published the \"Detroit News\", decided to swap their stations for fear the FCC would force them to sell the stations at unfavorable terms or revoke their very valuable licenses because the FCC at the time was considering forbidding ownership of newspapers and broadcast stations in the same market.\n\nIn 1985, the Gannett Company purchased the Evening News Association. [As indicated under \"Licensee\" above, the Evening News Association was renamed \"Detroit Free Press, Inc.\" in 2005, when that Gannett subsidiary simultaneously bought the \"Free Press\" and sold the \"News\".] On July 4, 1986, Gannett changed WDVM's call letters to WUSA both in honor of the station being located in the nation's capital and Gannett's ownership of \"USA Today\". The same connection is noted with Gannett's Denver station, KUSA-TV. The WUSA callsign had previously been used by Gannett's station in Minneapolis, which changed its callsign to KARE. While the station's current call sign is commonly printed as \"W*USA\", particularly in Gannett press releases, the asterisk or star between the W and U is not officially recognized as part of the call sign, as FCC records list the station as WUSA. The star device was used to denote its connection to \"USA Today.\" (KUSA-TV employs a similar practice.) After the Women's United Soccer Association (the WUSA) was founded in the late 1990s, the star was replaced on-air with the CBS eye.\n\nWUSA moved to a new Broadcast House at 4100 Wisconsin Avenue, NW in January 1992. WTOP-FM had left the old Broadcast House in 1971, but kept its transmitter there. WTOP radio departed in 1978; the \"Post\" had sold it a year earlier to the Outlet Company. The move to the more modern building was tinged with sadness due to the death from a brain tumor of channel 9's popular sportcaster, Glenn Brenner just days before the move.\n\nOn May 2, 2005, WUSA became the first station in the Washington market to broadcast its newscasts in High Definition.\n\nDigital television\n\nPost-analog shutdown"
