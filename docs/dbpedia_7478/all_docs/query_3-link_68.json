        "text": "Paxson Communications' PAX TV has entered into a deal to broadcast a full schedule of WUSA games for the '02 and '03 seasons. The WUSA's '02 national TV schedule will feature 22 games live on Saturday afternoons from 4:00-6:00pm ET beginning in April. In addition to the broadcast component, Paxson becomes an official sponsor of the league, getting rights to use the names and likenesses of WUSA players, as well as marks and other intellectual property, in marketing efforts. In the WUSA's inaugural season this year, TNT and CNN/SI carried a 22-game schedule. Both nets are divisions of AOL Time Warner, a WUSA investor, and have allowed the league to terminate its four-year deal with them. Turner Sports President Mark Lazarus said in a statement, \"Both parties decided it was in each other's best interest to pursue other options\" (WUSA).\n\nDETAILS: BLOOMBERG NEWS' Brian Trusdell reported Paxson Communications paid $2M for the WUSA TV rights. The 22-game Saturday afternoon schedule puts the league \"in direct conflict with\" MLS games on ESPN2, as the WUSA plays from April-August and MLS plays from March-October. WUSA President & CEO Lynn Morgan said that the league \"wanted a later time slot for its televised games than the early-afternoon one it had last year to draw more viewership from youth soccer and their families.\" WUSA games averaged a 0.4 Nielsen rating this year, or about 292,000 HHs. Morgan said that WUSA Commissioner Tony DiCicco and MLS Exec VP/Marketing & Fan Development Mark Noonan \"discussed each other's relevant [TV] packages.\" Morgan, on going up against MLS: \"That's unfortunate, but I don't think there was any way anyone could get around it. We tried to pin down a time slot to generate higher ratings.\" Meanwhile, Trusdell reported the Pax deal calls for the WUSA \"to sell most of the advertising while sharing revenue and production costs with Pax\" (BLOOMBERG NEWS, 12/18). MULTICHANNEL NEWS' R. Thomas Umstead cited sources as saying that the league was \"unhappy with the inconsistent coverage it received\" from TNT and CNN/SI (MULTICHANNEL NEWS, 12/18)."
