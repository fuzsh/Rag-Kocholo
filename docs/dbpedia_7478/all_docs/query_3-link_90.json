When he gets a job reading the news at right-wing radio station WUSA, he goes through the motions because it pays well, though he disagrees with the station's viewpoint. After a shy activist named Rainey (Anthony Perkins) starts inquiring about a political conspiracy centered at the station, Rheinhardt becomes troubled by what he discovers and must decide whether or not to take action.",
