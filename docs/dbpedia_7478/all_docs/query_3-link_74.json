        "text": "Washington, D.C. – April 10, 2014 – WeatherNation TV, Inc. announced today its partnership with WUSA9 to broadcast 24/7 weather news on Washington, D.C.’s digital TV channel 9.3, on Comcast Channel 203 and on area cable systems throughout the D.C. area.\n\nWeatherNation TV currently operates in multiple cities across America, including Atlanta, Boston, Minneapolis, Seattle and Denver and is expanding its reach rapidly. WeatherNation TV affords viewers reliable and current local, regional and national weather news all day, every day.\n\n“WUSA9’s First Alert weather brand really resonates with our viewers and users in D.C., as is evidenced by our popular live stream weather coverage, WUSA9 weather app downloads, and heavy use of our WUSA9 online live radar during the long cold winter of 2014,” said Mark Burdett, President and General Manager of WUSA. “Working with WeatherNation, we are growing the WUSA9 First Alert Weather commitment by providing even more accurate weather coverage in more places for this community,” he added.\n\n“The D.C. weather has kept the entire region on its toes this year, so the timing is perfect to team up with WeatherNation to provide our viewers enhanced weather coverage on channel 9.3,” said Topper Shutt, Chief Meteorologist for WUSA9. “Many people already watch our live radar on 9.3 and now we are producing even more local weather information and updates every 10 minutes, plus regional and national updates from WeatherNation.”\n\n“WeatherNation brings world-class technology and additional professional talent that will provide more of the quality weather coverage viewers have come to expect from Washington, D.C.’s WUSA9 First Alert weather,” said Michael Norton, President of WeatherNation. “Our knowledgeable team of meteorologists provides around-the-clock coverage of breaking weather and forecasting.”\n\nThe WeatherNation TV network delivers a back-to-basics approach to weather reporting and forecasting. Instead of long-form shows interspersed with short bouts of weather news, WeatherNation TV offers continuous coverage of hyper-local, local, regional and national weather events with cutting-edge graphics and stunning details.\n\nWeatherNation TV’s team of seasoned meteorologists use the latest technology from Baron Services and its Omni® and VIPIR® Systems to forecast and illustrate current conditions with engaging and innovative real time 3D graphical mapping to help viewers understand the in-depth story behind their weather. A powerful severe weather tracking system also gives viewers a detailed visual assessment of storms and other extreme weather, from the satellite view down to street-level detail.\n\nAbout WeatherNation TV, Inc."
