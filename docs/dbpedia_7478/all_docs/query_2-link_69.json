        "text": "WUSA Philadelphia Charge D Heather Mitts, who is featured in a five-page photo spread in the September issue of For Him Magazine (FHM), is profiled in a front-page Cover Story in the PHILADELPHIA DAILY NEWS, and Dick Jerardi writes Mitts' appearance is the magazine's \"first feature and pictorial of a major female athlete.\" FHM Editor-in-Chief Scott Gramling said Mitts \"was somebody who has been on our readers' radar and rightly so.\" On the magazine's cover, Mitts' feature is touted with the tag, \"They've finally found a way to make soccer interesting â€” have girls play.\" The magazine \"wanted to put Mitts in its version of her natural soccer environment,\" but her poses \"are not generally among those she needs on the pitch.\" Mitts said her \"main goal with all this is to promote women's soccer and to get the word out. It's helping.\" Meanwhile, Jerardi writes Mitts \"looked like an absolute natural\" when she did a Comcast SportsNet report on Manchester United's appearance at Lincoln Financial Field. While Mitts may play for the U.S. in the upcoming Women's World Cup, Premiere Sports & Entertainment (PSE) President Michael Steinberg said of his client, \"The networks have expressed interest in her working for them if she is not on the World Cup team.\" Steinberg added, \"We're hoping corporations and other people will see Heather on TV and see the magazine\" (PHILADELPHIA DAILY NEWS, 8/14). To promote the FHM issue, PSE held a party on Tuesday at 32 Degrees in Philadelphia. Mitts was also in N.Y. on Monday at ESPNZone to sign copies of the magazine and was interviewed on ESPNews. On Tuesday, Mitts appeared on WIP-AM and WTFX-Fox' \"Good Day Philadelphia.\" Mitts also co-hosted WCAU-NBC's \"10!\" this morning and will make a radio tour tomorrow. Mitts has an endorsement deal with Puma (THE DAILY)."
