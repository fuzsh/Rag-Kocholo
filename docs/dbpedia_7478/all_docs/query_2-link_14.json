At times it also makes me laugh or smile during the Wake up DC show. I also like the refreshing and relevant âVerifyâ segment that clarifies facts from fiction or just right out right false information to the Washington Metro people. As COVID-19 pandemic tests our patience, faith and daily ability to coop regardless of society. I also like how you also celebrate the heroes amongst us. We need to celebrate each others efforts during these time to give our communities hope and to make caring for each other contagious in good way. Itâs refreshing to hear and see a diverse reporter team that has each otherâs back and enjoys their jobs. Thanks for standing out, and being industry leaders as a News Organization. Continue to set the bar high so other news organizations follow your lead and represents our country. You Rock!!!!!\n\n19pastor39 ,\n\nRev. David Benway\n\nThe very first AP that I added to my smart phone was WUSA9. I am hoping this new one will be as informative and easy to use as the old one. I want my news weather and sports for DC, Maryland, and Virginia. I will get my world news from this same site. Make me real happy and keep it simple.I have been watching W U S A News and weather since I moved here over 25 years ago yes i remember Bruce when we were both young and so many of the team. I also get my weather from Topper and his team, I gave up on the others because I demanded accurate reports and sympathize wit Topper when thereâs no snow. Iâm an old Vermonter and we always had snow. I will pray with you topper. I will always stick with the best. Rev. David Benway"
