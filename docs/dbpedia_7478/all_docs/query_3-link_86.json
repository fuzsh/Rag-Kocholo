        "text": "By BRUCE ADAMS\n\nvillanova – As the final seconds ticked away, the crowd of 6,547 at Villanova Stadium watched in stunned silence as the Philadelphia Charge lost to the Washington Freedom Saturday, 1-0, in the Women’s United Soccer Association semifinals.\n\nThe Charge, who finished in second place during the regular season, was looking to get into its first-ever WUSA championship final. Unfortunately, Washington has been the hottest team in the league the second half of the season.\n\n“It’s disappointing,” said Charge coach Mark Krikorian. “But, you know, I’m proud of the players. They put in absolutely the best effort possible. And, it’s a strange game sometimes – you can control an awful lot of it, and sometimes if you don’t quite take advantage of the chances that you have, then it comes back to get you. We did have a few pretty good chances and we didn’t finish them.”\n\nThe Charge out shot Washington, 15-8, and had 10 corner kicks. Marinette Pichon and Mandy Clemens combined for nine shots but could not put one past Freedom goalkeeper Siri Mullinix.\n\nDefensively, the Charge, who allowed a league-low 22 goals during the 21-game regular season and held opponents to only 11.9 shots per game and only 5.5 shots on goal, came through Saturday, according to the coach.\n\nKrikorian said, “I felt that in the [back] and with [goalkeeper] Melissa [Moore] and the midfield as well, [we] did a very good job. [Our backfield was] pretty organized, [and] limited the space for Washington. It seemed, particularly in the second half, that we had an awful lot of the ball. When Washington had the ball, they didn’t have a whole lot of options, and we were able to get the ball back.”\n\nThe game was scoreless in the first half, then Washington’s Monica Gerardo scored in the 80th minute. Washington’s Mia Hamm had entered the game in the second half, which was a boost to the visitors.\n\nKrikorian said, “I thought we played pretty well in the second half. Of course, [Hamm] is going to have impact any time she comes into a game, and there were a couple of times [today] she was dangerous with the ball, but for the most part I felt our back players and our midfield players dealt with her pretty well.”\n\nIt was only the second loss of the season at Villanova University for Philadelphia (11-5-6), who fell to 1-4-2 in its last seven games. The Charge finished the regular season with a home record of 7-1-3.\n\nOne of Philadelphia’s best chances Saturday came in the 32nd minute when Kerry Conners streaked in on the left side of Mullinix and took a shot straight on. The shot on goal was deflected out to Clemens, who took a shot that went just over the crossbar.\n\nClemens was moved to forward for Saturday’s game. Prior to this, the Charge had been using just one forward, Pichon.\n\nKrikorian said of the Clemens move: “I thought it worked fantastic. I thought Mandy presented herself a number of times in great position to get balls and to be able to turn and to play off to her teammates, and to move out the ball. We were able to find seams; unfortunately, we weren’t able to hit the net.”\n\nWashington’s Carrie Moore helped keep the Charge off the scoreboard by defending against the ever-dangerous Pichon.\n\nKrikorian said, “I thought she [Moore] did a very good job – her assignment was very simple – to try to limit the number of chances that Pichon had at the goal. She’s done a good job against many of the top players in the league, chasing them around and shutting down their opportunities.”\n\nPichon finished the 2002 regular season as the Charge’s leader in both goals and points. Her 14 goals were good enough for second in the league, while her 29 points ranked her in a tie for third. Those totals were also single-season bests for the Charge and made her the team’s all-time leader. Pichon tallied 14 of the Charge’s 36 goals during the season.\n\nOne reporter asked after Saturday’s contest, “Do you rely too much on [Pichon] as a target player, that if she’s taken out of the game, you guys are a bit confused about where to try to move the offense?”\n\nKrikorian responded, “I think we created enough chances in a lot of different ways today that it wasn’t a matter of being one-dimensional. I did think at times during the season we were one-dimensional, but today I thought we attacked in a lot of different ways and just weren’t precise enough to put the ball in the net.”\n\nAfter the contest, Krikorian and several Charge players spoke to the crowd from the field over the public address system, saying things like, “thanks for your support”, “we’ll be back next year” while Charge players signed autographs for the fans.\n\nWhen the Women’s United Soccer Association revealed its list of finalists for the year-end awards, the Philadelphia Charge had a league-best eight nominees.\n\nHighlighting the list was Pichon, who was among the finalists for both the Most Valuable Player and Offensive Player of the Year awards.\n\nErica Iverson and Jen Tietjen were both finalists for Defensive Player of the Year, while Melissa Moore was being considered for Goalkeeper of the Year. Midfielder Stacey Tullock was up for Rookie of the Year and defender Jenny Benson was a finalist for Humanitarian of the Year.\n\nKrikorian was one of three finalists for Coach of the Year and General Manager Tim Murphy was up for Executive of the Year.\n\nTuesday, Krikorian was named WUSA Coach of the Year, beating out Carolina’s Marcia McDermott and Washington’s Jim Gabarra. The choice was voted on by WUSA coaches, general managers, players and select media representatives."
