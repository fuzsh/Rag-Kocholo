I’m excited to be joining what I consider to be the most innovative local news team in the country,\" said Wise of his new posting.\n\nWise's resume includes a decade at the New York Times, covering the NBA, The Mike Wise Show on WJFK-FM Washington, and regular appearances on CNN, MSNBC, Fox Sports and ESPN's Outside the Lines."
