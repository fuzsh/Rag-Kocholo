        "text": "A BOUNCE house accident has caused the death of a small child after the wind carried the minors in the inflatable over 15 feet into the air.\n\nThe tragic incident happened on Friday evening, leading to an urgent call from the Regency Furniture Stadium during a Maryland Blue Crabs game to authorities for help as young kids fell onto the field.\n\nThe bounce house became airborne due to a wind gust that took the moon bounce, along with the numerous children playing inside of it, around 15 to 20 feet up in the air, CBS affiliate WUSA reported.\n\nThe crowd attending the event noted their shock as they watched the bounce house, with kids in it, go completely airborne before coming back down.\n\nBefore the inflatable moon bounced and landed back on the stadium field, the lift from the heavy wind caused several children to fall to the ground.\n\nThe exact number of how many children were inside the bounce house when it became airborne has not yet been revealed.\n\nEmergency personnel reported to the scene and began patient care when they found that a 5-year-old boy had sustained life-threatening injuries.\n\nThe young child was immediately flown to the National Children's Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nAuthorities reported that a second minor was hurt in the incident as well.\n\nThe second child affected in the accident suffered from non-life-threatening injuries and was also flown to the mentioned hospital.\n\n\"We extend our deepest empathy to the children and their families during this difficult time,\" Charles County Government Commissioner President Reuben B. Collins, II stated.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why the wind gust could lift the bounce house.\n\nConcerns have been raised regarding whether it was solely due to the power of a strong wind, whether the moon bounce being improperly secured contributed to it, or whether a combination of factors caused it.\n\nWitnesses told NBC Washington that the bounce house was secured with stakes hammered into the ground.\n\nGeneral Manager of the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs Courtney Knichel also spoke out as the tragedy continues to unfold.\n\n\"Our entire organization shares our condolences with the family mourning the loss of a child and our concern for the child who was injured,\" she said.\n\nOur entire organization shares our condolences with the family mourning the loss of a child and our concern for the child who was injured. Our thoughts and prayers are with them all.\n\nSouthern Maryland Blue Crabs General Manager Courtney Knichel\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with them all.\"\n\nThe Maryland Blue Crabs team is also \"offering counseling and support to families, players and fans who attended the game,\" they said in a release.\n\nAdditionally, the baseball team canceled its following game which was scheduled for the very next day in honor of the victims and their grieving families.\n\nAll other planned activities for Saturday, August 3 were canceled by the team as well."
