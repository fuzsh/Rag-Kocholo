Our volunteers are trained to provide peer support with an intersectional lens and can help connect you with resources about sexual health, healthy relationships, mental health, and more. We’re here to listen, support, and help connect students with other resources within the university and the community. We hold workshops, events, film screenings, and campaigns to educate on various issues through an intersectional feminist lens.\n\nThe Centre provides students with sexual health resources including condoms, pads, pregnancy tests, lube, and tampons. We have peer support hours where students can drop by for support on any and all issues. The Women’s Centre also has an extensive library of over 900 books that cover a variety of topics surrounding all women and trans women including plays, poetry, queer theory, indigenous, philosophy/religion/spirituality and employment/education/economy! Subscriptions to magazines such as Bitch and Herizons are available. Make sure to stop by the Centre and come visit us!\n\nWe pride ourselves on being intersectional and providing a safe/expressive space for students to go; everyone is welcome at the Women’s Centre!\n\nLand Acknowledgement\n\nThe University of Waterloo and the Women’s Centre are situated on the Haldimand Tract, land promised to the Haudenosaunee of the Six Nations of the Grand River, and is the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples.\n\nThe teachings we hold around sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression, are largely westernized, and diverse expressions of gender and sexuality have long predated the colonization of Turtle Island. Since we have gathered around the premise of supporting the women and trans* students on our campus, we also want to acknowledge that we are fighting for rights to identities that have a history on these lands.\n\nThe Women’s Centre’s community was not the first gathering of women and trans* people on this land, and we do not claim to be. We acknowledge those who have been here before us and stand in solidarity with the local communities of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples.\n\nVoices Anthology\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.\n\nVoices has been a project of the Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association’s Women’s Centre since 1995. Each year a new anthology of the magazine of student’s work has been showcased on the Women’s Centre’s microsite or printed copies have been made available through the Centre.\n\nThroughout the years the publication has been a place to showcase different artistic expressions and student experiences. It has been a space where students could voice their beliefs, share their hearts, as well as corner of celebration and mourning.\n\nClick here to learn more about Voices or view our latest anthology.\n\nThe Women’s Centre provides menstrual hampers to any undergraduate student who needs them. The hamper consists of a bag or box that contains a cycle’s worth of menstrual hygiene products. Students can pick between single use (tampons and/or pads, liners) or reusable (washable pads and liners) hampers.\n\nSingle-use menstrual hampers typically contain 15 products per hamper; however, if you require additional products, please connect with the Women’s Centre and they will be able to provide you with these.\n\nMenstrual hampers are free of charge and can be picked up by visiting the Women’s Centre in SLC 3104.\n\nHave questions? Reach out to the Women’s Centre at womenscentre@wusa.ca or send a DM on Instagram (@UWwomenscentre).\n\nLibrary Database\n\nWe have over one thousand titles in the collection, and that number continues to grow. You can search through the collection by coming into the Centre during office hours to check-out the material. Currently we provide a two-week loan period to anyone who wishes to check out a book. You will be asked to provide your UWaterloo email, phone number and student number after every check-out and check-in."
