        "text": "Four letters: W-U-S-A.\n\nFour more letters: G-O-N-E.\n\nFor the last month and a half, that conclusion has been inescapable.\n\nBut get ready to add four new letters to the mix: B-A-C-K.\n\nAfter several meetings and conference calls, the Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA) appears ready to return in the summer of 2004.\n\nAlbeit in a different fashion.\n\n\"We would be hard-pressed to have a full 21-game schedule next year because the Olympics are right in the middle,\" said former Boston Breakers general manager Joe Cummings, who also said a decision is anticipated by the end of November. \"Right now, we are looking at maybe 10 games involving the original eight teams. At the end of the season, we'll have a Founders Cup just like we always have.\"\n\nOn Oct. 11, Cummings met with Kerry Tatlock (VP of Television and New Media), Thom Meredith (VP of WUSA Operations), Tony DiCicco (WUSA Commissioner), Katy Button (GM Washington Freedom), Marlene Bjornsrud (GM San Jose), John Langel (Attorney for Players Association) and Christina Kenney (WUSA Director of Player Administration) to discuss the league's potential future.\n\nThe ideas were plentiful.\n\nFirst, players -- in all likelihood -- will be paid on a per game basis next year. President Lynn Morgan and several other front-office executives have been eliminated from future plans after the league lost nearly $100 million in its three years -- including $19 million in 2003.\n\n\"It's going to be a completely different league structure with some new people,\" Cummings said. \"Some people will remain part of the league, but that also depends on if those people want to be involved in a different kind of league that's heading in a new direction.\"\n\nThat direction is a scaled down and fiscally sound model when compared to the original WUSA plan.\n\nInstead of anticipating 10,000-12,000 fans per game, executives have learned the crowd size is likely to average between 5,000-7,000. Also, team front-office staffs, which included about 20 employees, are going to be slashed to six or seven full-time employees. Teams are expected to hire 10-12 part-time employees to help facilitate game-day operations during the season.\n\n\"We feel we can save a lot of money on staff positions,\" Cummings said. \"For example, a media relations director will also handle public relations now. Before, that was two separate positions.\"\n\nThe reason for such drastic cuts stems from the league's inability to find national sponsors. With a shortfall of $19 million last year, the league needed eight or nine sponsors to post $2-3 million each in order to keep running. When that didn't happen, the doors closed.\n\nSince then, players and executives have received numerous calls from investors willing to support the league. And that is where most of the attention in 2004 will be focused.\n\n\"If the league does start up again, we are going to use most of '04 to get the national sponsors to keep the league alive,\" Cummings said. \"People know there is a need (for funds) now and we have to close that sponsorship gap which we didn't close at all in the first three years.\""
