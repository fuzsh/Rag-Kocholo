Unfortunatelly this command doesnt install the package for me. Most of my machines are 1809 and Windows_MediaFeaturePack_x64_1809Oct is the correct one I believe.\n\nAny other suggestions?\n\nThanks\n\nPatick\n\nUpvote 0 Downvote\n\nEdy\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nMessages\n\n310\n\nSolutions\n\n3\n\nPoints\n\n28\n\nNov 1, 2019\n\n#4\n\ndid i install successfully if you ran it manually on the machine?\n\nUpvote 0 Downvote"
