        "text": "Decent watch. A great first hour followed by an underwhelming second hour. The end really bummed me out as well.\n\nThe chemistry between Woodward and Newman is incredible. Perkins is excellent too, his face is so expressive.\n\nUnfortunately, Newman sighs and says “listen friend…” before making a declarative statement to Woodward one too many times.\n\nAll gets a bit overwrought there in the climactic scene between Woodward and Newman. Although it is followed by a great scene with Perkins and the ‘Minter’ character.\n\nI see not much has changed since 1970...\n\nRegardless, this movie was boring as shit and outside of trying to tick off Paul Newmans entire filmography, I don't see any need for people to seek this one out.\n\n2 out of 5 stars - 5/10 - F\n\nAn utterly confusing and at times prescient movie. Cynical communicators telling themselves they aren’t really involved and just a cog in the machine are kidding themselves.\n\nI have to wonder what they were trying to say by producing this film. The hippies answers are inadequate and everyone else is so interested in eating eachother alive.\n\nBig ups to Paul Newman for paying a whole bunch of money to produce a movie so you can kiss your wife a bunch.\n\nBizarre film. Threw it on last night because the premise seemed intriguing and it was led by Newman/Woodward. But what it is is a mishmash of 2.5-3 movies all in one: doomed love story, political message film, paranoia thriller.\n\nHowever, None of these movies come together to morph into one coherent film. So strange to see a movie with this much talent and this level of foresight into the direction of the American conservative movement could be such a dud. It’s like the movie Adam McKay would have made in the post-Easy Rider fallout"
