        "text": "WUSA has debuted a new studio that will give the Tegna-owned station the opportunity to create content for both television and digital broadcasts.\n\nThe set was unveiled last week. According to the release, it was designed for a nontraditional newscast.\n\nThe new studio, which was unveiled last week, offers flexible, nontraditional space and replaces the traditional, “two-anchors-at-a-desk” format familiar to local viewers. Emerging technologies like a seamless LED video wall and augmented reality aid in the visual delivery of news, weather and sports. Talent will employ touch screens and a social media megaphone to engage audiences and provide information that is both relevant and entertaining. The new studio is complemented by an updated on-air, online and mobile graphics package. WUSA9 has also partnered with Snap to embed public Snapchat stories into its reporting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We’ve been inspired to take a non-incremental approach to our news operations as we go beyond the headlines and tackle tough topics of importance to our audience,” said WUSA general manager Richard Dyer."
