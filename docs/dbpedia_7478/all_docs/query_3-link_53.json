        "text": "Veteran DC sports anchor Chick Hernandez has been named lead sportscaster at WUSA9. He will anchor the 11 p.m. sports according to WUSA9. Hernandez, who will replace Darren Haynes who is leaving for KCBS-TV in Los Angeles, announced the news on social media Tuesday evening. .\n\nHernandez grew up in Montgomery County attending Blair High School and the University of Maryland. He worked at FOX5 in the 90s and Comcast SportsNet (later NBC Sports Washington) where he worked for 17 years. Hernandez is part of this year’s Washington Commanders preseason TV crew.\n\nIn a story from WUSA9, Hernandez said, “It is still unreal to me that I am returning to WUSA9. Many moons ago, I was an intern for the late great Glenn Brenner and one of my mentors and friends, James Brown, so this is a full circle moment for me – one that I fully understand the gravity of and will treat appropriately. Not bad for a kid from around the way. See you soon.”\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MrChickSports/status/1694127116277661788?s=20"
