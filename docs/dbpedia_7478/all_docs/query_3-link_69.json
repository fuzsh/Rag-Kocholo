        "text": "Chick Hernandez is joining Washington, D.C. CBS station WUSA as the 11 p.m. sports anchor and lead anchor for the upcoming NFL season.\n\n“The more time I spend with Chick, the more I understand what a great fit he is for WUSA9,” said Michael Valentine, vp and station manager of WUSA. “His passion for the community goes well beyond sports. He is the perfect fit for us.”\n\nThis is a return to the Tegna owned station for Hernandez, who said he was once and intern there. The D.C. native also worked in Augusta, Ga., before joining Fox owned WTTG in Washington, D.C. He worked at NBC affiliate WRC for 17 years before leaving in 2018. More recently, Hernandez did play-by-play for CBS Sports Network’s college football and basketball games.\n\nAdvertisement"
