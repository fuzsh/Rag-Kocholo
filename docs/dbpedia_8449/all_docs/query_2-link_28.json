        "text": "Living standards are calculated by measuring the price of certain goods and services in each country relative to income in that country. This is done using a common national currency called the purchasing power standard (PPS). Comparing gross domestic product (GDP) per inhabitant in PPS provides an overview of living standards across the EU.\n\nSource: Eurostat\n\nIn 2018, the GDP of the EU-27 represented 18.6% of the world’s GDP, expressed in current prices. United States and the China were the other world’s largest economies, with shares of 24.0% and 15.9% respectively. Japan was the fourth largest economy, with 5.8% of global GDP, followed by United Kingdom and India.\n\nSource: Eurostat\n\nThe amount of money each EU country spends on education varies. Student exchanges in the EU are organised through the Erasmus programme, which helped more than 4 million people to study and train abroad between 2014 and 2020.\n\nSource: Eurostat\n\nIn addition, the EU actively encourages pupils to learn new languages from an early age, as increased mobility leads to more contact with people from other countries.\n\nSource: Eurostat\n\nAn effective transport system is vital for EU businesses and people. EU transport policy encourages clean, safe and efficient travel throughout Europe.\n\nTransport currently accounts for a quarter of the EU’s greenhouse-gas emissions. The EU is seeking a 90% reduction in these emissions by 2050. Moving to more sustainable transport means putting people first by providing them with healthier, cleaner and more affordable alternatives."
