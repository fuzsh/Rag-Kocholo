        "text": "On this page:\n\nOverview\n\nElectric Power\n\nTransportation\n\nIndustry\n\nCommercial/Residential\n\nAgriculture\n\nLand Use/Forestry\n\nOverview\n\nGreenhouse gases trap heat and make the planet warmer. Human activities are responsible for almost all of the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the last 150 years.1 The largest source of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities in the United States is from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation.\n\nEPA tracks total U.S. emissions by publishing the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks. This annual report estimates the total national greenhouse gas emissions and removals associated with human activities across the United States by source, gas, and economic sector.\n\nWhat are the primary sources of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks in each economic sector?:\n\nTransportation – Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation primarily come from burning fossil fuel for cars, trucks, ships, trains, and planes. Over 94% of the fuel used for transportation is petroleum based, which includes primarily gasoline and diesel and results in direct emissions.2 The transportation sector is the largest source of direct greenhouse gas emissions and second largest source when indirect emissions from electricity end-use are allocated across sectors. The transportation sector is an end-use sector for electricity but currently represents a relatively low percentage of total electricity use. Indirect emissions from electricity are less than 1 percent of direct emissions.\n\nElectricity production – Electric power includes emissions from electricity production used by other end use sectors (e.g., industry). In 2022, 60% of our electricity comes from burning fossil fuels, mostly coal and natural gas.3\n\nIndustry – Greenhouse gas emissions from industry primarily come from burning fossil fuels for energy, as well as greenhouse gas emissions from certain chemical reactions necessary to produce goods from raw materials. Industrial emissions are the third largest source of direct emissions. If indirect emissions from electricity use are allocated to the industrial end-use sector (e.g. to power industrial buildings and equipment), industrial activities account for a much larger share of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions as shown above.\n\nCommercial and Residential – Greenhouse gas emissions from the commercial and residential sector come from fossil fuels burned for heat and the use of gases for refrigeration and cooling in buildings, and non-building specific emissions such as the handling of waste. The commercial and residential sector emissions increase substantially when indirect emissions from electricity end-use are included, largely because buildings use 75% of the electricity generated in the US (e.g., for heating, ventilation and air conditioning; lighting; appliances, and plug loads).4 When emissions from electricity use are distributed to the commercial and residential end-use sector, commercial and residential activities account for a much larger share of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions as shown above.\n\nAgriculture – Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture come from livestock such as cows, agricultural soils, and rice production. Indirect emissions from electricity use in agricultural activities (e.g., powering buildings and equipment) are about 5 percent of direct emissions.\n\nLand Use and Forestry – While not shown in the figure, land areas can act as a sink (absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere) or a source of greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States, since 1990, managed forests and other lands are a net sink, i.e., they have absorbed more CO2 from the atmosphere than they emit, offsetting 13% of total gross greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nTrends\n\nSince 1990, gross U.S. greenhouse gas emissions have decreased by just over 3%. From year to year, emissions can rise and fall due to changes in the economy, the price of fuel, and other factors. In 2022, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions increased 0.2% compared to 2021 levels. In 2020, there was a sharp decline in emissions largely due to the impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on travel and other economic activity. In 2021 and 2022, the increase in total greenhouse gas emissions was driven largely by an increase in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion due to the continued rebound in economic activity after the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion increased by 8% relative to 2020 and 1% relative to 2021. CO2 emissions from natural gas consumption increased by 5% relative to 2021. CO2 emissions from coal consumption decreased by 6% from 2021. The increase in natural gas consumption and emissions in 2022 is observed across all sectors except for U.S. Territories, while the coal decrease in primarily in the electric power sector. Emissions from petroleum use increased by less than 1% in 2022.\n\nReferences\n\nIPCC (2013) Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis.

Shoemaker, Susannah.\n\nElectric Power Sector Emissions\n\nThe Electricity power sector involves the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity. Carbon dioxide (CO2) makes up the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions from the sector, but smaller amounts of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are also emitted. These gases are released during the combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, to produce electricity. Less than 1% of greenhouse gas emissions from the sector come from sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), an insulating chemical used in electricity transmission and distribution equipment.\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions in the Electric Power Sector by Fuel Source\n\nCoal combustion is more carbon-intensive than burning natural gas or petroleum for electric power production. Although coal use accounted for 55% of CO2 emissions from the sector, it represented only 20% of the electricity generated in the United States in 2022. Natural gas use accounted for 39% of electricity generation in 2022, and petroleum use accounted for less than 1%. The remaining generation in 2022 came from non-fossil fuel sources, including nuclear (19%) and renewable energy sources (21%), which include hydroelectricity, biomass, wind, and solar.1 Most of these non-fossil sources, such as nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, and solar, are non-emitting.\n\nElectric Power Sector Trends\n\nIn 2022, the electric power sector was the second largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 25% of the U.S. total. Electric power sector emissions increased 7% in 2021. Greenhouse gas emissions from electric power production have decreased by about 15% since 1990 due to a shift in generation to lower- and non-emitting sources of electricity generation and an increase in end-use energy efficiency.\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions by Electricity End-Use\n\nElectricity is used by other end-use sectors—in homes, businesses, and factories—and the greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation can be allocated to the sectors that use the electricity. Looking at greenhouse gas emissions by end-use sector can help us understand energy demand across sectors and changes in energy use over time.\n\nWhen emissions from electric power generation are allocated to the industrial end-use sector, industrial activities account for a much larger share of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions from commercial and residential buildings also increase substantially when emissions from electricity end-use are included, due to the relatively large share of electricity use mostly building related (e.g., heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; lighting; and appliances) in these sectors. The transportation sector currently has a relatively low percentage of electricity use and thus indirect emissions, but it is growing due to the use of electric and plug-in vehicles.\n\nReducing Emissions from Electric Power Production\n\nThere are a variety of opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with electric power production, transmission, and distribution. The table below categorizes these opportunities and provides examples. For a more comprehensive list, see Chapter 6 (PDF) (88 pp, 3.6MB) of the Contribution of Working Group III to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.2\n\nType How Emissions Are Reduced Examples Increased Efficiency of Fossil-fired Power Plants and Fuel Switching Increasing the efficiency of existing fossil fuel-fired power plants by using advanced technologies, substituting less carbon-intensive fuels, and shifting generation from higher-emitting to lower-emitting power plants.\n\nConverting a coal-fired boiler to use of natural gas, or co-firing natural gas.\n\nConverting a single-cycle gas turbine into a combined-cycle turbine.\n\nShifting dispatch of electric generators to lower-emitting units or power plants.\n\nRenewable Energy Using renewable energy sources rather than fossil fuel to generate electricity. Increasing the share of total electricity generated from wind, solar, hydro, and geothermal sources, as well as certain biofuel sources, through the addition of new renewable energy generating capacity. Increased End-Use Energy Efficiency Reducing electricity use and peak demand by increasing energy efficiency and conservation in homes, businesses, and industry. EPA's ENERGY STAR® partners avoided over 400 million metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2020 alone, helped Americans save over $42 billion in energy costs, and reduced electricity use by 520 billion kWh.

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK and New York, NY, USA. doi: 10.1017/9781009157926\n\nTransportation Sector Emissions\n\nThe Transportation sector includes the movement of people and goods by cars, trucks, trains, ships, airplanes, and other vehicles. The majority of greenhouse gas emissions from transportation are carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions resulting from the combustion of petroleum-based products, like gasoline and diesel fuel, in internal combustion engines. The largest sources of transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions include passenger cars, medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and light-duty trucks, including sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks, and minivans. These sources account for over half of the emissions from the transportation sector. The remaining greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector come from other modes of transportation, including commercial aircraft, ships, boats, and trains, as well as pipelines and lubricants. Indirect emissions from electricity are less than 1 percent of direct emissions.\n\nRelatively small amounts of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are emitted during fuel combustion. In addition, hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions also occur from the Transportation sector. These emissions result from the use of mobile air conditioners and refrigerated transport.\n\nTransportation Sector Emissions Trends\n\nIn 2022, direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from transportation accounted for 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, making it the third largest contributor of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions when considering indirect emissions from distributed electricity. When considering only direct emissions, transportation is the largest contributor of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions (28%). From 1990 to 2022, total transportation emissions from fossil fuel combustion increased by 19%. From 2021 to 2022, emissions decreased by less than 1%. The largest sources of transportation greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 were light-duty trucks, which include sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks, and minivans (37%); medium- and heavy-duty trucks (23%); passenger cars (20%); commercial aircraft (7%); other aircraft (2%); pipelines (4%); ships and boats (3%); and rail (2%). In terms of the overall trend, from 1990 to 2022, total transportation emissions have increased due, in large part, to increased demand for travel. The number of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by light-duty motor vehicles (passenger cars and light-duty trucks) increased by 47% from 1990 to 2022, as a result of a confluence of factors including population growth, economic growth, urban sprawl, and periods of low fuel prices. Between 1990 and 2004, average fuel economy among new vehicles sold annually declined, as sales of light-duty trucks increased. Starting in 2005, average new vehicle fuel economy began to increase, while light-duty VMT grew only modestly for much of the period. Average new vehicle fuel economy has improved almost every year since 2005, slowing the rate of increase of CO2 emissions.\n\nLearn more about Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Transportation.\n\nReducing Emissions from Transportation\n\nThere are a variety of opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation.

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK and New York, NY, USA. doi: 10.1017/9781009157926\n\nIndustry Sector Emissions\n\nThe Industry sector produces the goods and raw materials we use every day. The greenhouse gases emitted during industrial production are split into two categories: direct emissions that are produced at the facility, and indirect emissions that occur off site but are associated with the facility's use of electricity.\n\nDirect emissions are produced by burning fuel for power or heat, through chemical reactions, and from leaks from industrial processes or equipment. Most direct emissions come from the consumption of fossil fuels for energy. A smaller amount of direct emissions, roughly one third, come from leaks from natural gas and petroleum systems, the use of fuels in production (e.g., petroleum products used to make plastics), and chemical reactions during the production of chemicals, metals (e.g., iron and steel), and minerals (e.g., cement).\n\nIndirect emissions are produced by burning fossil fuel at a power plant to make electricity, which is then used by an industrial facility to power industrial buildings and machinery.\n\nMore information about facility-level emissions from large industrial sources is available through EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program data publication tool. National-level information about emissions from industry as a whole can be found in the sections on Fossil Fuel Combustion and the Industrial Processes chapter in the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks.\n\nIndustry Sector Emissions Trends\n\nIn 2022, direct and indirect industrial greenhouse gas emissions accounted for 30% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, making it the second largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions of any sector. Direct greenhouse gas emissions from Industry account for 23% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, making it the third largest contributor to direct U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, after the Transportation and Electric Power sectors. From 2021 to 2022, total energy use in the industrial sector decreased by less than 1%.Total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from industry, including electricity, have declined by 22% since 1990.\n\nReducing Emissions from Industry\n\nThere are a wide variety of industrial activities that cause greenhouse gas emissions, and many opportunities to reduce them. The table shown below provides some examples of opportunities for industry to reduce emissions. For a more comprehensive list, see Chapter 11 of the Contribution of Working Group III to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 1\n\nExamples of Reduction Opportunities for the Industry Sector Type How Emissions Are Reduced Examples Energy Efficiency Upgrading to more efficient industrial technology. EPA's ENERGY STAR® program helps industries become more energy-efficient. Identifying ways that manufacturers can use less energy for powering buildings, industrial processes and to run equipment. Fuel Switching Switching to fuels that result in less CO2 emissions but the same amount of energy, when combusted. Using natural gas instead of coal as process input. Recycling Producing industrial products from materials that are recycled or renewable, rather than producing new products from raw materials. Using scrap steel and scrap aluminum as opposed to smelting new aluminum or forging new steel. Training and Awareness Making companies and workers aware of the steps to reduce or prevent emissions leaks from equipment. EPA has a variety of resources for training and other steps for reducing emissions. EPA has experience working with the aluminum, semiconductor, and magnesium industries. Instituting handling policies and procedures for perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) that reduce occurrences of accidental releases and leaks from containers and equipment.\n\nReferences\n\nIPCC, 2022: Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change.

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK and New York, NY, USA. doi: 10.1017/9781009157926\n\nCommercial and Residential Sector Emissions\n\nThe Residential and Commercial sectors include all homes and commercial businesses (excluding agricultural and industrial activities). Greenhouse gas emissions from this sector come from direct emissions including fossil fuel combustion for heating and cooking needs, management of waste and wastewater, and leaks from refrigerants in homes and businesses, as well as indirect emissions from the use of electricity by homes and businesses (e.g., heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; lighting; and appliances, and plug loads). The building sector uses 75% of the electricity generated in the US.1\n\nDirect emissions are produced from residential and commercial activities in a variety of ways:\n\nCombustion of natural gas and petroleum products for heating and cooking emits carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Emissions from natural gas consumption represent 78% of the direct fossil fuel CO2 emissions from the residential and commercial sector in 2022. Coal consumption is a minor component of energy use in both of these sectors.\n\nOrganic waste sent to landfills emits CH4.\n\nWastewater treatment plants emit CH4 and N2O.\n\nAnaerobic digestion at biogas facilities emits CH4.\n\nFluorinated gases (mainly hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs) used in air conditioning and refrigeration systems can be released during servicing or from leaking equipment.\n\nIndirect emissions are produced by burning fossil fuel at a power plant to make electricity, which is then used in residential and commercial activities, such as lighting and for appliances.\n\nNote: Residential and commercial sector emissions presented here do not necessarily represent the full suite of emissions related to buildings and the broader built environment. The commercial and residential sectors numbers don’t include any emissions/sinks from production of construction materials (e.g., upstream emissions from production of cement, emissions and sinks from land use changes, etc.). Those would be reflected in other sectors. Also, as shown above, emissions from these sectors include other emissions that do not occur at the building site (i.e., landfills, etc.). Furthermore, energy use in these sectors may also include energy used for equipment (such as motor gasoline used for non-highway vehicles or lawn and garden equipment), exterior lighting, or construction. In addition, energy use for some large buildings, such as energy-intensive office buildings and factories with large onsite combustion, are typically included in industrial sector energy use.\n\nMore national-level information about emissions from the residential and commercial sector can be found in the U.S. Inventory's Trends in Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Energy chapters (Chapters 2 and 4 respectively).\n\nCommercial and Residential Sector Emissions Trends\n\nIn 2022, direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from homes and businesses accounted for 31% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Direct emissions were 13% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2022. Greenhouse gas emissions from homes and businesses vary from year to year, often correlated with annual fluctuations in energy use caused primarily by weather conditions. Total residential and commercial greenhouse gas emissions, including direct and indirect emissions, in 2022 have increased by less than 1% since 1990. Greenhouse gas emissions from on-site direct emissions in homes and businesses have increased by 8% since 1990. Additionally, indirect emissions from electricity use by homes and businesses increased from 1990 to 2007 but have decreased since then to approximately 4% below 1990 levels in 2021.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Homes and commercial buildings use large amounts of energy for heating, cooling, lighting, and other functions. Energy-efficient building practices and retrofits can allow new and existing buildings to use less energy to accomplish the same functions, leading to fewer greenhouse gas emissions. Techniques to improve building energy efficiency include better insulation and building envelope improvements; more energy-efficient heating, cooling, ventilation, and refrigeration systems; efficient LED lighting; passive heating and lighting to take advantage of sunlight; and the purchase of energy-efficient appliances and electronics.

Capturing and using methane produced in current landfills.\n\nWhen solid waste decomposes in landfills, it creates landfill gas, which is primarily comprised of CO2 and CH4. There are a number of well established, low-cost methods to reduce greenhouse gases from consumer waste, including recycling programs, waste reduction programs, and landfill methane capture programs.\n\nLearn about recycling\n\nLearn about WARM, EPA's Waste Reduction Model.\n\nLearn about EPA's Landfill Methane Outreach Program, which promotes the recovery and use of landfill gas.\n\nLearn about appliance recycling from EPA’s Responsible Appliance Disposal program.\n\nAir Conditioning and Refrigeration Reducing leakage from air conditioning and refrigeration equipment. Using refrigerants with lower global warming potentials. Commonly used refrigerants in homes and businesses include ozone-depleting refrigerants, and blends consisting entirely or primarily of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Both HCFCs and HFCs are potent greenhouse gases. In recent years there have been several advancements in air conditioning and refrigeration technology that can help homes and businesses reduce both refrigerant charges and refrigerant emissions. For instance, in the retail food sector, learn more about EPA's GreenChill Program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from supermarkets.\n\nAgriculture Sector Emissions\n\nAgricultural activities — crop and livestock production — contribute to emissions in a variety of ways:\n\nVarious management practices on agricultural soils can lead to increased availability of nitrogen in the soil and result in emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O). Specific activities that contribute to N2O emissions from agricultural lands include the application of synthetic and organic fertilizers, the growth of nitrogen-fixing crops, the drainage of organic soils, and irrigation practices. Management of agricultural soils accounts for just over half of the greenhouse gas emissions from the Agriculture sector. Management of croplands and grasslands can also lead to emissions or sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2). These emissions and removals are included under the Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry sector.\n\nLivestock, especially ruminants such as cattle, produce methane (CH4) as part of their normal digestive processes. This process is called enteric fermentation, and it represents over a quarter of the greenhouse gas emissions from the Agriculture sector.\n\nThe way in which manure from livestock is managed also contributes to CH4 and N2O emissions. Different manure treatment and storage methods affect how much of these greenhouse gases are produced. Manure management accounts for about 14% of the total greenhouse gas emissions from the Agriculture sector in the United States.\n\nSmaller sources of agricultural emissions include CO2 from liming and urea application, CH4 from rice cultivation, and burning crop residues, which produces CH4 and N2O.\n\nMore information about emissions from agriculture can be found in the agriculture chapter in the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks.\n\nAgriculture Sector Emissions Trends\n\nIn 2022, direct greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector accounted for 9.4% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture have increased by 8% since 1990. Agricultural soil management activities, such as application of synthetic and organic fertilizers, deposition of livestock manure, and growing nitrogen fixing plants, were the largest contributors to U.S. N2O emissions in 2022, accounting for 75% of total N2O emissions. Emissions from other agricultural sources have generally remained flat or changed by a relatively small amount since 1990.\n\nReducing Emissions from Agriculture\n\nThe table shown below provides examples of opportunities to reduce emissions from agriculture. For a more comprehensive list of options and a detailed assessment of how each option affects different gases, see Chapter 7 of the Contribution of Working Group III to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nExamples of Reduction Opportunities for the Agriculture Sector Type How Emissions Are Reduced Examples Land and Crop Management Adjusting the methods for managing land and growing crops.\n\nFertilizing crops with the appropriate amount of nitrogen required for optimal crop production, since over-application of nitrogen can lead to higher nitrous oxide emissions without enhancing crop production.\n\nDraining water from wetland rice soils during the growing season to reduce methane emissions.\n\nLivestock Management Adjusting feeding practices and other management methods to reduce the amount of methane resulting from enteric fermentation.\n\nImproving pasture quality to increase animal productivity, which can reduce the amount of methane emitted per unit of animal product. Also, increased productivity in livestock can be introduced through improved breeding practices.\n\nManure Management\n\nControlling the way in which manure decomposes to reduce nitrous oxide and methane emissions.\n\nCapturing methane from manure decomposition to produce renewable energy.\n\nHandling manure as a solid or depositing it on pasture rather than storing it in a liquid-based system such as a lagoon would likely reduce methane emissions but may increase nitrous oxide emissions.\n\nStoring manure in anaerobic lagoons to maximize methane production and then capturing the methane to use as an energy substitute for fossil fuels.\n\nFor more information on capturing methane from manure management systems, see EPA's AgSTAR Program, a voluntary outreach and education program that promotes recovery and use of methane from animal manure.\n\nLand Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry Sector Emissions and Sequestration\n\nPlants absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere as they grow, and they store some of this carbon as perennial aboveground and belowground biomass throughout their lifetime. Soils and dead organic matter/litter can also store some of the carbon from these plants depending on how the soil is managed and other environmental conditions (e.g., climate). This storage of carbon in plants, dead organic matter/litter and soils is called biological carbon sequestration. Because biological sequestration takes CO2 out of the atmosphere and stores it in these carbon pools, it is also called a carbon \"sink.\"\n\nEmissions or sequestration of CO2, as well as emissions of CH4 and N2O, can occur from management of lands in their current use or as lands are converted to other land uses. Carbon dioxide is exchanged between the atmosphere and the plants and soils on land, for example, as cropland is converted into grassland, as lands are cultivated for crops, or as forests grow. In addition, using biological feedstocks (such as energy crops or wood) for purposes such as electricity generation, as inputs to processes that create liquid fuels, or as building materials can lead to emissions or sequestration.*\n\nIn the United States overall, Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) activities have resulted in more removal of CO2 from the atmosphere than emissions. Because of this, the LULUCF sector in the United States is considered a net sink, rather than a source, of CO2. In many areas of the world, the opposite is true, particularly in countries where large areas of forest land are cleared, often for conversion to agricultural purposes or for settlements. In these situations, the LULUCF sector can be a net source of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMore national-level information about land use, land-use change, and forestry is available from the Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry chapter in the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks. For more information on emissions and sequestration from forest land and urban trees in settlement areas, see also the USDA's USFS Resource Bulletin.\n\nFor more information about global emissions from land use and forestry activities, see EPA's Global Greenhouse Gas emissions page and the Contribution of Working Group III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\n* Emissions and sequestration of CO2 are presented under the Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry sector in the Inventory. Other emissions from CH4, and N2O are also presented in the Energy sector.\n\nEmissions and Trends\n\nIn 2022, the net CO2 removed from the atmosphere from the LULUCF sector was 13% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Between 1990 and 2022, total carbon sequestration in the LULUCF sector decreased by 11%, primarily due to a decrease in the rate of net carbon accumulation in forests, as well as an increase in CO2 emissions from urbanization. Additionally, while episodic in nature, increased CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions from forest fires have also occurred over the time series.\n\nReducing Emissions and Enhancing Sinks from Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry\n\nIn the LULUCF sector, opportunities exist to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the potential to sequester carbon from the atmosphere by enhancing sinks. The table shown below provides some examples of opportunities for both reducing emissions and enhancing sinks. For a more comprehensive list, see Chapter 7 of the Contribution of Working Group III to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nExamples of Reduction Opportunities in the LULUCF Sector Type How Emissions Are Reduced or Sinks Are Enhanced Examples Change in Uses of Land Increasing carbon storage by using land differently or maintaining carbon storage by avoiding land degradation.\n\nAfforestation and minimizing the conversion of forest land to other land uses, such as settlements, croplands, or grasslands.\n\nChanges in Land Management Practices Improving management practices on existing land-use types.\n\nUtilizing reduced tillage practices on cropland and improved grazing management practices on grassland.\n\nPlanting after natural or human-induced forest disturbances to accelerate vegetation growth and minimize soil carbon losses.\n\n6,343 million metric tons of CO2: What does that mean?\n\nAn Explanation of Units\n\nA million metric tons equals about 2.2 billion pounds, or 1 trillion grams. For comparison, a small car is likely to weigh a little more than 1 metric ton. Thus, a million metric tons are roughly the same mass as 1 million small cars.\n\nThe U.S. Inventory uses metric units for consistency and comparability with other countries. For reference, a metric ton is slightly more (approximately 10%) than a U.S. \"short\" ton.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions are often measured in carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent. To convert emissions of a gas into CO2 equivalent, its emissions are multiplied by the gas's Global Warming Potential (GWP). The GWP takes into account the fact that many gases are more effective at warming Earth than CO2, per unit mass.\n\nThe GWP values appearing in the Overview of Greenhouse Gases and Sources of Greenhouse Gas web pages reflect the values used in the U.S. Inventory, which are drawn from the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). For further discussion of GWPs and an estimate of greenhouse gas emissions using updated GWPs, see Annex 6 of the U.S. Inventory and the IPCC's discussion on GWPs (PDF) (106 pp, 7.7MB)."
