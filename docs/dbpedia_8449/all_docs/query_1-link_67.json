        "text": "Here’s a little map overlay with the country of France placed under a map of the Continental US state boundaries. The total area of France is 211,209 square miles, making France slightly smaller than two Colorados. France is smaller than the state of Texas at 268,820 square miles of area.\n\nThe average population density of France is 120.56 people per square kilometer, last measured in 2013. For the same time period, the United States was last measured at 34.56 per square kilometer.\n\nThe population of France is currently around 63 million people. For historic population and future population predictions, see Population Pyramid\n\nAccording to the US Census Bureau’s population clock, the estimated 2015 United States population (July 2015) is over 321.3 million. California has the largest state population of 39 million, almost 2/3 that of France.\n\nParis, the capital of France, has a population of 2.34 million people, slightly more people than those who occupy Houston, Texas which has the fourth highest population among cities in the United States.\n\nLooking for a folding map of Paris you can buy online? Longitude Maps has a Paris and France map bundle by National Geographic. Artwise Paris, France might also fit the bill."
