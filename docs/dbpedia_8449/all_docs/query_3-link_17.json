        "text": "Population and development often go hand in hand in the very same way that population growth and the potential for future economic growth do. As such, some of the largest cities in the United States are also the most populated.\n\nBelow, you’ll find a list of the 10 most populated U.S. cities. Along with their most recently recorded population, you’ll find other relevant facts, including the median age, median household income, and estimated home/condo values.

COVID-19, for example, created a work-at-home culture that has allowed city residents to move to the suburbs and beyond without having to commute as much as before. Many tech companies have kept their work-from-home policies even as vaccination and immunity have largely decreased the severity of COVID-19. Other companies are switching to hybrid models that allow for some time in the office.\n\nThus, after more than a decade of steady population growth, large cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago have seen their populations drop modestly since 2020. Cities that did see continued growth tended to be more affordable cities located in warmer Sun Belt climates in the southern U.S., such as Phoenix, San Antonio, Jacksonville, Fla., and Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nWhat Are the Largest U.S. Cities by Population?\n\nThe largest cities by population in the United States are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Phoenix, Philadelphia, San Antonio, San Diego, Dallas, and San Jose, Calif.\n\nWhat Is the Largest City in the U.S.?\n\nNew York is the largest city in the U.S. by population. It had a population of more than 8.4 million, according to 2021 Census figures.\n\nWhat Is the Biggest City in the U.S. by Area?\n\nThe largest city by area in the United States is Sitka, Alaska. The city spans 2,874 square miles of incorporated area.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhile the size of a city’s population may point to its economic strength and growth, other factors may affect just how attractive it may be to potential residents. For instance, the cost of living can vary drastically. Cities like New York, Los Angeles, and San Diego are very costly. On the other hand, our research has found that Houston, Phoenix, San Antonio, and Dallas are among the most affordable big cities based on median household income relative to the median household/condo cost."
