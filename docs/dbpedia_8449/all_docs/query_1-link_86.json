        "text": "When did each state become a member of the United States? These states are listed in the sequence in which they ratified the Constitution of 1787 and were admitted to the United States of America.\n\nFor each state, a satellite image (Landsat 7) and certain geography facts are displayed. The date of statehood, capital, total area, percentage of land covered by water, highest point of height, and mean elevation are all provided for each state.\n\n1. Delaware\n\n1787: December 7 (Ratification date – one of the original U.S. colonies)\n\nDelaware is known as the First State because it was the first state to ratify, or sign, the United States Constitution.\n\n2. Pennsylvania\n\n1787: December 12 (Ratification date – one of the original U.S. colonies)\n\nThe term “Keystone State” comes from the fact that Pennsylvania serves as a geographic link between the Northeastern and Southern United States, as well as the Atlantic and Midwest coasts.\n\n3. New Jersey\n\n1787: December 18 (Ratification date – one of the original U.S. colonies)\n\nLarge portions of New Jersey’s northwestern and southern regions are very rural. The fertile, loamy soil of the state’s Inner Coastal Plain area makes the terrain suitable for agriculture, earning New Jersey the nickname “Garden State.\n\n4. Georgia\n\n1788: January 2 (Ratification date – one of the original U.S. colonies)\n\nGeorgia was the last and southernmost of the original Thirteen Colonies to be established.

Massachusetts\n\n1788: February 6 (Ratification date – one of the original U.S. colonies)\n\nNicknames for Massachusetts are: The Bay State (official), The Pilgrim State; The Puritan State, The Old Colony State, and The Baked Bean State.\n\n7. Maryland\n\n1788: April 28 (Ratification date – one of the original U.S. colonies)\n\nSome of Maryland’s nicknames are Old Line State, the Free State, and the Chesapeake Bay State. Maryland is the only U.S. state with no natural lakes.\n\n8. South Carolina\n\n1788: May 23 (Ratification date – one of the original U.S. colonies)\n\nThe natural environment of South Carolina is separated into three natural geographic areas: the Atlantic coastal plain, the Piedmont, and the Blue Ridge Mountains, which run east to west.\n\n9. New Hampshire\n\n1788: June 21 (Ratification date – one of the original U.S. colonies)\n\nThe nickname, “The Granite State” comes from the New Hampshire’s large granite rocks and quarries. With a general coastline length of 18.57 miles (29 km), New Hampshire has the shortest ocean coastline of any U.S. coastal state.\n\n10. Virginia\n\n1788: June 25 (Ratification date – one of the original U.S. colonies)\n\nThe Atlantic Coastal Plain, the Piedmont, the Blue Ridge, the Appalachian Ridge and Valley Region, and the Appalachian Plateau are the five geographical regions that make up Virginia.\n\n11. New York\n\n1788: July 26 (Ratification date – one of the original U.S. colonies)\n\nNew York State is home to Adirondack Park which is the largest publicly protected area in the contiguous United States. New York City is the most populous city in the United States with over 8.3 million residents.\n\n12. North Carolina\n\n1789: November 21 (Ratification date – one of the original U.S. colonies)\n\nSince records began in 1526, more than a thousand ships have sunk in the waters around Cape Hatteras in North Carolina, earning it the moniker “Graveyard of the Atlantic.”\n\nMore: Geography of North Carolina\n\n13. Rhode Island\n\n1790: May 29 (Ratification date – one of the original U.S. colonies)\n\nRhode Island is the smallest U.S. state by area. The “Ocean State” is Rhode Island’s official nickname, referring to the extensive bays and inlets that make up around 14% of the state’s total territory.\n\nMore: Geography Facts: Rhode Island\n\n14. Vermont\n\n1791: March 4 (Vermont is the first state not part of the original 13 U.S. colonies to become part of the United States).\n\nAfter the 13 colonies were ratified, Vermont became the 14th state admitted to the newly formed United States of America. Not counting steeple heights, Vermont is the only U.S. state without a building taller than 124 feet.\n\n15. Kentucky\n\n1792: June 1\n\nKentucky is known as the “Bluegrass State” because of the Kentucky bluegrass grass that grows in many of the state’s pastures. Mammoth Cave National Park, the world’s longest cave system, is located in Kentucky.\n\n16. Tennessee\n\n1796: June 1\n\nThe Blue Ridge Mountains, which run along Tennessee’s eastern border, reach some of the highest peaks in eastern North America. Eastern Tennessee is home to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the country’s most visited national park.\n\n17. Ohio\n\n1803: March 1\n\nThe state flag of Ohio is the only non-rectangular flag in the United States. Ohio is named after the Ohio River, whose name comes from the Seneca word ohiyo’, which means “good river,” “big river,” or “huge stream.”\n\n18. Louisiana\n\n1812: April 30\n\nLouisiana’s southern coast is one of the world’s fastest-disappearing regions. Climate change, oil and gas drilling and dredging, and Mississippi River levees are causing the state to lose a football field of land every 48 minutes, or 16 square miles each year.\n\n19. Indiana\n\n1816: December 11\n\nWith the highest point at 1,257 feet (383 m) and the lowest point at 320 feet (98 m), Indiana has the narrowest elevation span, 937 feet (286 m) of any non-coastal US state.\n\n20. Mississippi\n\n1817: December 10\n\nMississippi lies almost entirely inside the Gulf coastal plain, with lowland plains and low hills dominating the landscape.\n\n21. Illinois\n\n1818: December 3\n\nExcept for a few spots where the river has changed course, the Mississippi River runs nearly the entire western boundary of Illinois.\n\n22. Alabama\n\n1819: December 14\n\nAlabama has the most inland waterways of any state, with a total of 1,500 miles (2,400 km).\n\nMore: A to Z Geography: Alabama\n\n23. Maine\n\n1820: March 15\n\nMaine is the contiguous United States’ northeasternmost state. Main is also the only state with a single syllable name, and the only state that only borders one other state.\n\n24. Missouri\n\n1821: August 10\n\nMissouri is landlocked and and is one of only two states that borders eight different states (Tennessee is the other state).\n\n25. Arkansas\n\n1836: June 15\n\nThe world’s only diamond-bearing place accessible to the public for digging is Crater of Diamonds State Park near Murfreesboro, Arkansas.\n\n26. Michigan\n\n1837: January 26\n\nMichigan is the only state in the United States that is made up of two peninsulas: the Lower Peninsula and the Upper Peninsula. Michigan is flanked by four of the five Great Lakes, as well as Lake St. Clair, making it the state with the longest freshwater shoreline in the United States.\n\n27. Florida\n\n1845: March 3\n\nIn the contiguous United States, Florida has the longest coastline. Florida’s coastline stretches 1,350 miles from one end to the other (2,170 km).

California\n\n1850: September 9\n\nBoth the highest (Mount Whitney) and lowest (Death Valley) points in the 48 contiguous states are found in California.
