The states are located across different regions, from the East Coast to the West Coast, and from the Midwest to the South. With a population of over 334 million people, according to the United States Census Bureau in 2023, the U.S. is a diverse and dynamic country with something new to discover around every corner.[1]\n\nThe history of the states dates back to colonial times, when the first English settlers arrived at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. Over time, more settlers arrived from Europe and other parts of the world, leading to the formation of the 13 original colonies that would eventually become the first states of the union.\n\nToday, the 50 states of America are a diverse and vibrant part of the country, each with its own economy, government, and way of life. From the beaches of Florida to the mountains of Colorado, from the deserts of Arizona to the forests of Maine, the states offer a wide range of landscapes, climates, and attractions for visitors and residents alike.\n\nInfoplease has been chosen as one of the Top 30 Best Sites to Learn About the World by Crowdsourcedexplorer.com.\n\nClick a state in the map below to find facts, statistics, historical information, and more.\n\nWhat State Is the First State?\n\nDelaware is known as the \"First State\" because it was the first of the original 13 colonies to become a state. It was the first state to ratify the U.S. Constitution on December 7, 1787, which is commemorated each year as \"Delaware Day.\"\n\nDelaware was also the site of the Battle of the Brandywine during the American Revolutionary War.\n\nWhich State in U.S. Is Safest?\n\nAccording to recent data, New Jersey is considered the safest state in the U.S. It has a low crime rate and a strong sense of community. The state has a relatively low population density and a high level of public safety, with a well-funded police force and a low incidence of violent crime.[2] Overall, New Jersey is a state that prioritizes safety and well-being for its residents.\n\nWhat Are the 3 Largest States?\n\nThe three largest states in the U.S. by land area are Alaska, Texas, and California. Alaska is the largest state by far, with a land area of over 665,000 square miles. Texas is the second largest state with a land area of over 268,000 square miles, and California is the third largest with a land area of over 163,000 square miles. Each of these states has a unique geography and culture, with diverse populations and economies.\n\nWhat Is the Smallest U.S. State?\n\nRhode Island is the smallest state in the U.S. with a total area of just 1,214 square miles. Despite its small size, the state has a rich history and a diverse economy, with a strong focus on education and tourism. Rhode Island is home to several well-known universities, including Brown University and the Rhode Island School of Design, as well as popular tourist destinations such as Newport and Block Island.\n\nEach State Profile includes:\n\nChoose a state:\n\nCapital\n\nPopulation\n\nMedian age\n\nElected officials\n\nHistory\n\nEconomy\n\nPoints of interest\n\nFamous natives\n\nEntrance into Union\n\nState map & flag\n\nState motto, symbols, nicknames\n\nName origins\n\nLargest cities & county\n\nLand area\n\nCounties, forests & parks\n\nCapital\n\nPopulation\n\nMedian age\n\nElected officials\n\nHistory\n\nEconomy\n\nPoints of interest\n\nFamous natives\n\nEntrance into Union\n\nState map & flag\n\nState motto, symbols, nicknames\n\nName origins\n\nLargest cities & county\n\nLand area\n\nCounties, forests & parks\n\nUnited States"
