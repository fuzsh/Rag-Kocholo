Geologic processes, including erosion of tributaries and slopes, and active tectonics continue to shape the canyon today. The geologic record in Grand Canyon is an important scientific chronicle and is largely responsible for its inspirational scenery.\n\nPalentology resources include nearly 300 diverse and globally significant fossil localities ranging from 1.2-billion-year-old stromatolites to Paleozoic trilobites, plants, reptile tracks, and marine invertebrates, and Pleistocene megafauna in caves.\n\nLearn more about geology in Grand Canyon.\n\nNatural Resources\n\nWildlife\n\nBirds: 450 species\n\nMammals: 91 species\n\nFish: 18 species, 5 native\n\nReptiles and Amphibians: 58 species\n\nInvertebrates: 1,443 species, including 292 butterflies and moths\n\nExotic (non-native) animals: 30 species\n\nRange expanding species (not native to the park but to the region, naturally expanding into the park): Mammals: coatimundi, hog nosed skunk, javleina, elk (North Rim); Birds: California Quail, Zone Tailed hawk\n\nPark Endemic animals, not extirpated: 17 species; 1 mammal, 1 snake, 5 butterflies, 1 pseudoscorpion, and 1 tarantula\n\nRegionally Endemic animals, not extirpated: 5 species; One reptile (Grand Canyon Rattlesnake) and three mammals (Kaibab squirrel, and the Navajo Mexican vole) are known only from the Grand Canyon region. At least nine species of insects are endemic to Grand Canyon, and six fish species (humpback chub, razorback sucker, flannelmouth sucker) are endemic to the Colorado River basin.\n\nFederally Endangered and Threatened Species: California condor, humpback chub, razorback sucker, Southwestern Willow Flycatcher, Ridgway's rail, Mexican Spotted Owl, yellow-billed cuckoo, and desert tortoise.\n\nExtirpated Species: Grizzly bear, black-footed ferret, gray wolf, jaguar, Bear Valley sandwort, Colorado Pikeminnow, bonytail, roundtail chub, and southwestern river otter.\n\nVegetation\n\nVascular Plants: 1,737 species\n\nEndemic Plants: 10 species\n\nExotic (non-native) Plants: 208 species\n\nFungi: 167 species\n\nMoss: 64 species\n\nLichen: 195 species\n\nVegetation Communities: 129\n\nFederally Endangered and Threatened Species: Sentry milk-vetch (Astragalus cremnophylax var. cremnophylax).\n\nAn additional nine species of special concern are known, and 25 additional vascular plants are of management concern due to their limited distribution.\n\nSix Vegetation Formation Types: riparian, desert scrub, pinyon-juniper woodland, ponderosa pine forest, spruce-fir forest, and montane meadows/sub-alpine\n\nCultural Resources\n\nHuman History\n\nThe oldest human artifacts found date to the Paleoindian period and are nearly 12,000 years old. Since that time, various cultures have continually used and occupied lands that became the park. Archaeological evidence from the following prehistoric culture groups is found in Grand Canyon National Park: Paleoindian, Archaic, Basketmaker, Ancestral Puebloan (Kayenta and Virgin branches), Cohonina, Cerbat, Pai, and Southern Paiute. Historical-period cultural groups include the Hopi, Navajo, Pai, Southern Paiute, Zuni, and Euro-American.\n\nThere are currently 3,391 ancestral sites documented within the park dating to the prehistoric period, representing approximately 7.5% of park lands inventoried. In addition, park records document evidence of historic period use from 1540-1950, including 453 locations with evidence of historic Native American use.\n\nTribal Partners\n\nGrand Canyon is home to 11 federally recognized tribes with deep history and connection to the Grand Canyon since time immemorial. Tribal governments and communities work closely with park administration and management on a host of programs. Through collaborative projects such as the Desert View Watchtower Intertribal Cultural Heritage Site, the park is working with tribes to provide accurate and culturally appropriate information to visitors. This “First Voice” programming acknowledges the rich and diverse cultural history of the Grand Canyon and celebrates the connections native people have to the Canyon. Tribal lands surrounding the park offer many unique tourism opportunities to visitors planning a trip to the Grand Canyon.\n\nHistoric Resources\n\nNational Historic Landmarks\n\n4 Individual Buildings\n\n3 Districts\n\n1 Site\n\nNational Register of Historic Places\n\n8 Buildings\n\n10 Districts\n\n2 Sites\n\n1 Structure\n\nNational Register properties include archaeological sites, historic structures, cultural landscapes, and ethnographic resources. The park is working with the University of Arizona and tribes to prepare a nomination for the Grand Canyon as a Traditional Cultural Place. The work will be completed in 2022.\n\nList of Classified Structures (LCS): 874 listings\n\nLCS includes National Historic Landmark and National Register listed or eligible properties\n\nCultural Landscapes: 16\n\nClimate\n\nClimate in Grand Canyon National Park is relatively mild.
