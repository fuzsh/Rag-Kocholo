        "text": "LET'S EXPLORE THE UNITED STATES' REGIONS\n\nThe United States is comprised of 50 states and 1 federal district, the district of Columbia, that serves as the seat of our Nation Capital plus several territories and islands scattered across the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Of the main 50 States only 2 are not found in the continental United States -- Alaska and Hawaii both on the pacific side respectively North and South.\n\nThe land area of the entire United States is approximately 3,800,000 square miles (9,841,955 km2), with the contiguous United States making up 2,959,064 square miles (7,663,940.6 km2.)\n\nQuick Stats\n\nHorizontal Width: 2,680 miles (4313 km.)\n\nVertical Length: 1,582 miles (2546 km.).\n\nUnited States area: 3,800,000 square miles (9,841,955 km2)*\n\n* You could easily compare the United States to the size of Europe (10,180,000 sq. km.)\n\nSuffice to see the nation is frequently divided into regions and subregions to better differentiate the territory based on climate, culture, geographical location and so on. Although each governmental agency has a slightly different way to categorize and dive the US territory in regions, we can at least identify 5 different regions -- Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Southwest and The West.\n\nAlthough this is possibly the most typical way to divide the US mainland into separate sub-regions, we opt to use the 7-region division which allow to better present the different territories.\n\nThe US divided in 7 Regions\n\nNew England\n\nMid-Atlantic\n\nSoutheast\n\nMidwest\n\nThe Rocky Mountains\n\nSouthwest\n\nPacific Coastal\n\nThe United States Map divided by 7 Region\n\nThere is really no absolute right or wrong when it comes to dividing the United State Territory, and probably if you have already conducted some researches regarding the United States, you may have come across these names once or twice and found that they can be pretty much interchangeable.\n\nAs we go into exploring in a bit more detail these different regions, we will utilize the 7-region subdivision as it allows us to better dive the national parks and things to explore/do in each.\n\nTHE NEW ENGLAND\n\nFOR: The Birth of a Nation\n\nBrief Introduction:\n\nThe region of New England extends for almost 72,00 sq. mi. Possibly one of the oldest regions of the United States dating back to the 1620s with the arrival of the Pilgrims out of the coast of Cape Cod aboard the famous Mayflower. This is a region deep in culture and tradition, the bedrock of America Heritage, home to some of the most important cultural institutions & educational centers including a couple of Ivy-league Universities.\n\nWHAT TO VISIT HERE\n\nLargest Cities:\n\nBoston (MA), Providence(RI), Portland (ME)\n\nTowns worth stopping:\n\nProvincetown (Capecod) the iconic village at the end of the peninsula, Hyannis (Capecod) because who doesn't love the Kennedys, Gloucester (MA) for its tradition in the Fishing Industry, Kennebunkport (ME) for its elegance and gorgeous Mansions, Bar Harbor (ME) as the \"main gate\" to the Acadia National Park, Stowe and Montpelier (VT) especially in the Fall and Winter for some snow wonderland.\n\nNational/State Park:\n\nAcadia National Park found in Maine with its 47,000 acres of pines trees and birches that extend all the way to the water.\n\nCape Cod National Seashore Park with over 43,000 acres of shoreline along the coast of Cape Cod, a paradise for all beach, sand dune and pristine waters' lovers.\n\nMount Washington State Park found in New Hampshire. Love the mountains and drastic climate changes? Well, then this is the place for you.\n\nBest Way to Visit the Region:\n\nLeaving Boston aside for a moment, probably the easiest way to explore New England is by car. Although you have trains and domestic flights that connect the major cities in each State, this is an area that is meant to be explored as a road-trip or you won't be able to really witness the beauty of New England. We recommend at least 1 to 2 weeks to dedicate to the entire area. Starting from the southern area of New England which is the State of Connecticut and Cape Cod you can drive North along the coast visiting the most quaint villages on the Atlantic Shore and reach the Acadia National Park and then cut West to explore New Hampshire and Vermont.\n\nRecommended for:\n\nThis region is definitely for the lovers of nature, long deserted sandy beaches, mountains, cliffs and pine trees that basically reach the ocean, and of course lobsters! Maine is the state that supplies 90% of fresh lobsters consumed annually in the United States. If you love mountains & cool temperatures landscapes but can't quite give up on the ocean and beaches, this is for you! A unique mix of the two.\n\nMost dramatic time to visit:\n\nFall Foliage is one of the most sought after season. The entire region basically colors up in the hues of orange, red and yellow. Alternatively, late spring and summer are great seasons with warm days and cool nights. Possibly avoid Winter months, as snowfall can be heavy and driving around won't be as easy and fun.\n\nItineraries & Trips: New England Triangle:On The Road for 10 Days\n\nMID ATLANTIC\n\nFOR: Lovers of Metropolises, Big Cities & History\n\nBrief Introduction:\n\nThis is the most infrastructurally-advanced, industry-heavy, economically-developed region of the US, home to some of the most densely populated cities in America. Here, you find the states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and our capital Washington DC.\n\nWHAT TO VISIT HERE\n\nLargest Cities:\n\nNew York City (NY), Philadelphia (PA), Washington (DC), Baltimore (MD), and Pittsburgh (PA).\n\nTowns worth stopping:\n\nThere are plenty of small towns in the Mid-Atlantic region from those found along the Hudson River (NY) to those along the Jersey Shore (NJ) or the Chesapeake Bay (MD). However, if you want to visit historical villages you may want to start with Annapolis (MD), Gettysburg (PA), St Michaels (MD), West Point (NY) and Old Town Alexandria (VA).\n\nNational/State Park:\n\nThere are actually no National Park in this region, however, we'll point out a couple of State Park and National Monument that are definitely worth visiting.\n\nNiagara Falls State Park (NY) located right at the border with Canada the place to be if you want to explore the impressive strength and power of the Niagara Falls.\n\nBear Mountain State Park (NY) for hikes especially during the Foliage season and for panoramic views of the Hudson Valley.\n\nStatue of Liberty & Ellis Island National Monument (NY) for a visit to Lady liberty.\n\nGettysburg National Military Park (PA) to learn about the historic battle of Gettysburg.\n\nAssateague Island National Seashore (MD) a gorgeous island and park home to wild horses that run freely on the water.\n\nThe National Mall (DC) for the most important National Memorials and to learn American History.\n\nBest Way to visit the Region:\n\nThis area is possibly the most highly-populated, well-connected by public transportation region of the United States. So, if you want to focus on the large metropolis, you might be able to simply use commercial transportation such as trains, buses, or flights between the major hubs of New York City, Philadelphia and Washington DC. The cities are also a great home-base for day-trips to visit the surrounding areas and parks.\n\nRecommended for:\n\nThose that love history and big-city vibes slightly mixed with some touches of Mother Nature. Especially if it's your first time visiting the US, you might want to start with cities such as NYC and Washington DC to get acquainted with both the American culture and history, plus they won't require you renting a car, driving around for long hours and extensive researches. You will have plenty of opportunities to visit the big cities and surrounding areas with daily excursions and activities.\n\nMost Dramatic Time to Visit:\n\nMid-Spring during the Cherry Blossoms is an amazing time to visit the region especially for cities such as NYC and DC. Alternatively Fall, to experience some Foliage. The Holidays are always much-appreciated thanks to the Christmas decorations but be prepared for cold temperatures and snow. Early and late Summer are good for those that love warm weather while sightseeing. Avoid mid-July to the end of August as it's the warmest, most humid and rain-heavy time of the year.\n\nTHE SOUTH\n\nFOR: Small Town Lovers, Country Music, Sweet Tea & Comfort Foods\n\nBrief Introduction:\n\nThe South is known for its incredible hospitality & unique culture steeped in traditions. Throughout the centuries, this region has developed some very particular customs when it comes to foods, sports, music, religions, etc. to make it a very particular and self-contained region different from anywhere else in the United States. This is where we can discover and learn about the plantations' economy, as well as facts regarding the civil war, the confederate states, segregation and the consequential fight for civil rights. No trip to the US is complete without a visit to the South especially for those interested in learning more about today's American Culture and its deep divisions.\n\nWHAT TO VISIT HERE\n\nLargest Cities:\n\nMiami (FL), Atlanta (GA), New Orleans (LA), Nashville (TN)\n\nTowns Worth Stopping:\n\nThe South is the epitome of Small Town USA. You will have a plethora of quaint seaside villages and charming towns to visit.\n\nDahlonega (GA) a historic town surrounded by wine farms and vineyards.\n\nSavannah (GA) to get your fill of cobblestone streets, antebellum homes, and horse-drawn carriages.\n\nMemphis (TN) to discover the Legend of Rock and Roll Elvis Persley.\n\nCharleston (SC) the seaside town with Old World charm and antebellum-style houses.\n\nBeaufort (SC) for perfect walks along the waterfront and the historic downtown.\n\nSt Augustine (FL) to discover the oldest town in the continental United States and its Spanish roots.\n\nFairhope (AL) a quaint town in Alabama overlooking the Mobile Bay with lots of traditions and historical houses.\n\nBaton Rouge (LA) where you can visit the old Old Louisiana State Capitol and original antebellum plantations.\n\nNatchez (MI) known as the first settlement along the Mississippi River and the town with the most antebellum houses in the US.\n\nEureka Springs (AR) with its iconic Historic District full of Victorian buildings and houses.\n\nNational/State Parks:\n\nAlthough what makes the South so unique is culture, tradition, and small-town vibes, the region also does offer a couple of National Parks definitely worth visiting.\n\nShenandoah National Park (VA) found along the Blue Ridge Mountains and part of the Appalachian Trail perfect for lovers of hikes and forests; home to some popular local \"inhabitants\" including the black bear!\n\nThe Great Smoky Mountain National Park (TN & NC) with the popular 11-mile long Cades Cove Scenic Loop. Incredible scenery.\n\nMammoth Cave’s National Park (KY) with its almost 400 miles of explored caverns is the longest known cave system in the world.\n\nHot Springs National Parks (AR) taking the name for the neighboring city of Hot Springs and famous for its bathing waters.\n\nBest Way to Visit the Region:\n\nThe South is pretty spread-out so you might find that a flight & drive combination will work best to explore the most of this territory. Unless you have over 3+ weeks at your disposal, we don't recommend simply driving all around. It's best if you select 3 major cities where you can easily fly in & out and then rent cars to explore the region.\n\nRecommended for:\n\nFor those that want to explore the South with its culture and traditions. If you have watched at least once \"Gone with the Wind\" and fell in love with the scenery, if Country Music is your jam, if you want to try some real BBQ, if you hear sweet tea and your eyes light up, this region is for you.\n\nMost Dramatic Time to Visit:\n\nThe weather and the scenery are definitely more appealing during the mid-seasons Spring and Fall. Winters are not too cold but the scenery is not as nice. Avoid July and August as they are the worst months for both humidity and heavy rainfall.\n\nTHE MIDWEST\n\nFOR: Lakeshore Towns, Frontier Villages & The Wild Wild West\n\nBrief Introduction:\n\nThe region is known for its vast prairie land, buffalo roaming the country, small-town vibes and laid-back life. In this region, you can learn the history of the Frontier Life West of the Mississippi.
