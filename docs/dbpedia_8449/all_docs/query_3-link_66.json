        "text": "Each state and the District of Columbia will appoint its electors after it certifies the general election results. Each will then prepare a Certificate of Ascertainment which will contain the names of the electors and the number of votes they received. Certificates of Ascertainment also may contain the party affiliation for electors. OFR posts the Certificates of Ascertainment after receiving them from the States. You’ll find the posted Certificates on our website.\n\nHowever, OFR does not receive the names of the electors until receiving the Certificates of Ascertainment. To find out the names earlier, you would need to contact each State and the District of Columbia individually to request the contact information for their electors. The National Association of State Election Directors (NASED) can help you find contact information for the States.\n\nSome States release the slates of all potential electors before the general election and some States include the names of the potential electors on the general election ballot. How each State approaches these issues is up to the State.\n\nWhether or when a State releases contact or other information about its electors is also up to the State."
