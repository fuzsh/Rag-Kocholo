        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe actual size of countries varies greatly and is difficult to portray accurately on a two-dimensional map. This is where the Mercator Projection comes into play. Developed by the Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569, this projection is considered one of the most important developments in the history of cartography. The Mercator Projection preserves angles and directions when constructing its maps, which makes it ideal for navigation purposes. However, it does distort actual land masses, making countries appear larger or smaller than their true size depending on their latitude. This means that countries located near the poles appear much larger than they actually are while those near the equator appear much smaller. For example, Greenland appears almost as large as Africa on a Mercator Projection map when in reality it is approximately 14 times smaller. The use of this projection has been controversial in recent years due to its misrepresentation of areas around the equator but it still remains popular due to its navigational accuracy and convenience.\n\nReal Size of Countries\n\nTrue Size of Countries\n\nTwo-dimensional maps distort the size of countries as well. Some look fairly similar on the map as in real life: this is the case of Brazil, India, and countries in Central and South Africa such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Angola. Some countries however appear much bigger on the map than they actually are. For instance, Canada and Russia occupy almost 25% of the Earth’s surface on the map, when in reality they take up less than 5%. Similarly, Greenland seems to be a giant land, but its actual size is significantly smaller than it seems. On the map, the United States seems to be bigger than West Africa when it is actually much smaller, and could easily fit in the West part of the African continent."
