The land area of the entire United States is 3,531,905 square miles.\n\nAlaska is by far the biggest state - you could fit Rhode Island (the smallest state) into Alaska several hundred times, yet Rhode Island has a significantly larger population according to the U.S. Census Bureau's estimated population figures for 2017, with Alaska at 739,795 compared to Rhode Island's 1,059,639 people."
