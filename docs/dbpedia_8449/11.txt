What is the largest state by area in the United States of America? Here is a list of the top ten biggest states by size:

Alaska (Total area: 665,384 square miles)

Texas (Total area: 268,596 square miles)

California (Total area: 163,696 square miles)

Montana (Total area: 147,040 square miles)

New Mexico (Total area: 121,590 square miles)

The United States has a diverse climate, which is reflected in the country's landscape. Not surprisingly, Alaska and Texas are the largest states by area, although Alaska, at 665,384 mi², is substantially larger than Texas at 268,596 mi². Alaska is made up of 85.76% land, while water covers an area of 94,743 mi² (the highest in the U.S.). However, the much dryer southern state of Texas consists of only 7,365 mi² of water. Other states with arid climates are similar: New Mexico and Arizona are almost entirely comprised of land (99.76% and 99.65%, respectively) with very little water.

Many states have large areas of water. These include the states of Michigan (40,175 mi²) and Wisconsin (11,339 mi²) in the Great Lakes region of the northern U.S., and the humid Gulf States of Florida (12,133 mi²) and Louisiana (9,174 mi²). There are, of course, many other states that may not have vast areas of water within the state, but which are Ocean-facing (such as Georgia), as well as states that have small areas of water in terms of percentage, but the numbers simply reflect the size of the state itself (for example, tiny Rhode Island with its 511 mi² of water).
