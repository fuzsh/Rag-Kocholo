Geography

The United States of America is the fourth largest country in the world after Russia, Canada and China. With an area of 9.53 million kmÂ², it stretches across North America from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the Atlantic Ocean in the east. They border Canada to the north and Mexico to the south. This makes the country, which is divided into 50 partly sovereign states, over 39 times the size of the United Kingdom.

The USA is divided into numerous geographical zones across its exceptionally large area. In addition to vast ice deserts, Alaska also boasts the two highest mountains in the country. The highest mountain peak, Denali (formerly Mount McKinley), is 6,194 meters above sea level. This is followed by the Sierra Nevada in California and the elongated Rocky Mountains, which also divide the country climatically. Between the Sierra Nevada and the Wasatch Mountains lies the Great Basin, the largest desert in North America.

Due to its location between the major oceans and the 18,617 (partly uninhabited) islands, the coastal regions also play a major role. This is where the most populous areas are located. The coastline itself is 19,924 km long. An exceptionally high proportion of 83.1% of the total 334.91 million belongs to the urban population.
