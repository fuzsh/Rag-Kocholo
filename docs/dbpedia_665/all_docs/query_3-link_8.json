        "meta_description": "Adolph von\r\nMenzel was a realist painter and graphic artist. He was born in Breslau in\r\nGermany on December 8, 1815. At the age of 14 Adolph was working for his\r\nfather, a former head teacher who in 1818 had founded his own lithographic\r\nworkshop. Four years later, Adolph was responsible for supporting his family,\r\nfollowing the death of his father. By then they were living in Berlin.Menzel\r\nstudied at the Berlin Academy of Art and learned how to draw from sculptures,\r\nbut his short time there marked the end of his formal artistic training. He had\r\nhis first commercial success in 1833, with a set of drawings commissioned by\r\nLouis Sasche, a publisher and art dealer. These drawings were reproduced as\r\nlithographs to illustrate a poem by Goethe. He was\r\nbeginning to paint in oils in 1834 and was accepted as a member of the\r\nAssociation of Younger Artists. Four years later Menzel was invited to join the\r\nElder Artists’ Association and he also had the opportunity to see, for the\r\nfirst time, paintings by the English artist John Constable. Menzel\r\ncontinued with his figurative drawing and established his career as a graphic\r\nillustrator. He used wood engravings for his illustrations of a book by Franz\r\nKugler on the History of Frederick the Great. A milestone\r\nin his life was reached in 1853, when Menzel was appointed professor at the\r\nRoyal Academy of Art, the same institution he had attended briefly as a student\r\nin 1833-4 and where later, in 1875, he was elected as a member of the Senate. Menzel\r\nvisited Paris for the first time in 1855. In the Pavilion of Realism at the\r\nExposition Universelle he viewed realist paintings by Gustave Courbet. The French\r\nCross of the Legion of Honor was awarded to Menzel in 1867 for his painting\r\ndepicting Frederick the Great and his troops at the Battle of Hochkirch.\r\nAnother of his history paintings depicted the lying in of state of the Dead\r\nMarch. The subject was connected to events that took place in the revolution of\r\n1848, but this painting was never finished. A major\r\nexhibition of paintings by Menzel took place in 1884 in Berlin, and many of his\r\nworks were shown in other parts of Europe. He received several honors and major\r\nawards for his art. On his seventieth birthday, in December 1885, Berlin\r\nUniversity awarded him an honorary doctorate. In Breslau he was given the\r\nstatus of honorary citizen and later he received the same honor from the city\r\nof Berlin. He was also made an honorary member of several European art\r\nacademies. Before his\r\ndeath on February 5, 1905, the artist had been raised to the highest level of\r\nGerman society and had became known as Adolph von Menzel. He was the first\r\nartist to be made a Knight of the Black Order. He never married and, according\r\nto his last Will and Testament, had taken a deliberate decision never to form a\r\nromantic alliance or sexual relationship. The Kaiser himself arranged the\r\nartist’s funeral and walked behind the coffin.View our&amp;nbsp;Adolph von Menzel Gallery",
