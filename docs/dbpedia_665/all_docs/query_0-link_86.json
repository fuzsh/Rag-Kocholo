        "text": "The visual representation of music, sounds, musicians and singers, throughout history has always been linked to the musical style, and also, the instruments of its time. It has been an important topic of inspiration. In this post we will see music in ancient painting. And the next topic will be Music in contemporary painting.\n\nPintura egipcia con músicos y bailarines.\n\nIt is a pictorial subject that has been used a lot in ancient times. Music idea contains beauty on its own and so do musical artists.\n\nHowever, it is an issue that can leave some dissatisfaction.\n\nHow to make a static image express sounds, musicality and even make us feel the same as a melody would make us feel?\n\nThe only topic I’ve written on this before is Kandinsky’s: Vasíli Kandinsky and the music\n\nHowever, as it is modern abstract painting, it depends on the spectator sensitivity to see the musicality in Kandinsky’s or Klee’s art works.\n\nAs regards figurative painting, It seems that there are basically the following elements to represent the music.\n\nPaint the musicians and singers.\n\nPaint the instruments. I consider this method to be the poorest because, although it can be very decorative, the instruments by themselves do not generate rhythms or connote their own sounds.\n\nPaint rhythms, linearities, visual effects that connote the sensations of the music itself. In this method, the excess of abstraction causes the representation to be lost, although it can be much more “sonorous”.\n\nPerhaps the best form, or the one that generates the most music sensation, is a mixture of all three elements.\n\nA little historical tour will give us some ideas.\n\nPainting music in ancient times\n\nIn ancient times, most of the painted works are always the musicians with their instruments, such as flutes, guitars or old lutes, drums, etc. They are usually simple graphic styles, such as illustrations, both in Japan, Egypt, Greece and Rome, among others.\n\nMusic of Iran. Image from Hasht-Behesht Palace painting, Isfahan, Iran, from 1669.\n\n“A Taoist Playing a Bamboo Flute”, by Kim Hong Do (1747-1806). A more modern work but with the Japanese style.\n\nThe representation of music in the Middle Ages\n\nIn the Middle Ages, of course, music and painting were closely linked to religion. An example are these angels.\n\nHans Memling (1433–1494). Angels Musicians (Angel Musicians) of 1480. Oil on panel. 165 cm x 230 cm. Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp.\n\nMusic and painting in the baroque\n\nFlute Concert with Frederick the Great at Sanssouci, by Adolph Menzel (1815–1905). More about chamber music from that time can be found in the Wikipedia.\n\nRomantic and Post-Raphaelite Music and Painting\n\nThe representation of Music and Literature was very present in romantic painting as they were a great source of inspiration.\n\nPastoral by Rupert Bunny, painted in 1893. Detail of the work.\n\nMusic, by Santiago Rusiñol (1861-1930). With the idea of combining music, poetry and painting, the Catalan painter created this beautiful work. The style is pre-Raphaelite. Pre-Raphaelite artists did some similar works, with musicians – poets. The painting also shows the gardens that he loved to paint so much, so that it unites nature with music, poetry and the beauty of a woman.\n\nThe French cartoonist named Nadar (Gaspard-Félix Tournachon – 1820-1910) drew the composer Liszt in this work together with other musicians and composers. The influence that this great composer exerted in his time was well recognized.\n\nFrom the avant-garde to the present\n\nMarc Chagall’s violinist, recalls the works of Tchaikovsky, where the romantic violin made the melodies. Chagall’s musician flies to his music and escapes through the window. Chagall knew very well how to turn ideas into poetry and did not paint a simple musician but a more dreamy one.\n\nThe concert, by János Kmetty. An artist from Hungary, he lived from 1889 to 1975.\n\nRaoul Dufy (1877 – 1953) painted this orchestra with soloist at piano and choir. This painter is very surprising and has a great variety of themes, although music and poetry stand out in his works. With his technique of tempera and watercolors he made very complete works, managing to represent his ideas with a modern style.\n\nIn the next topic I will address the pictorial styles that deal with the subject of music today. Contemporary artists also draw their inspiration from current musicians."
