        "text": "The Balcony Room is a painting produced in 1845 by German artist Adolph Menzel.\n\nOne of the most pleasant and the brightest paintings of artist, and has been considered unusually modern for the time in which it was created.\n\nThe painting is relatively small; it is like reminiscent of the illustrations of Bavarian romantics in literary works. This piece of art is an example of so-called private art, namely, it means that artist has created painting primarily for his pleasure. The artist’s inspiration was something immaterial since most of the surface of the work is empty. The viewer can feel the fresh air that enters the room and light breeze that moves the curtains. Sun’s rays illuminate and heat the room. The artist has caught play of shadows and reflections on the floor and in the mirror. Although you can see elements of incompleteness on the painting, they do not violate its inner harmony.\n\nThe work can be viewed at Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin, Germany."
