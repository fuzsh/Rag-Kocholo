        "text": "Kaiser Wilhelm I had a rather special birthday present in 1876. Just five years after the German state formally came into being, the Nationalgalerie, the first gallery in the world devoted to the art of its time, opened in Berlin, the words Der Deutschen Kunst (to German art) inscribed and gilded on its neoclassical pediment.\n\nThe institution's history, and that of its collection, are inextricably linked to the history of Germany. Spirit of an Age, an exhibition of 77 paintings on loan to the National Gallery, gives us something of a potted history of German art between 1813 and 1912 - from Caspar David Friedrich's melancholic intimations of the sublime to Lovis Corinth's unappealing expressionist heroics - while presenting a portrait of a nation grappling with its identity.\n\nThe exhibition is necessarily incomplete, and oddly unbalanced. Manet, Monet and Courbet even make fleeting appearances (albeit with relatively minor works), signalling the innovative purchasing policy of director Hugo von Tschudi in the late 1890s. There are subtexts, then, to this exhibition - not least to do with the current reorganisation and reunification of all Berlin's public collections.\n\nThe exhibition opens with a room dedicated to Friedrich and Karl Friedrich Schinkel, the latter an architect of classicist Berlin as well as a painter. Schinkel's paintings, of children frolicking towards a bright new dawn through a sylvan glade, and mythic landscapes full of soulful aspiration and lofty sentiment - and loftier Gothic cathedrals - have not worn well. Blast me with Beethoven if you like - and Beethoven's music clearly transcends its time - but Schinkel's studied magnificence leaves me utterly cold.\n\nA similar spirit is evident in the six paintings here by Friedrich, though his paintings are much more complex. His own melancholy and preoccupation with death renders their messages - if paintings such as his can be seen as having any clear message - much the more ambivalent and disturbing. Friedrich's mother died when he was seven, his sister followed her a year later, and Friedrich himself watched his brother fall through the ice and drown while skating when the artist was just 13.\n\nYet there is still something difficult to modern eyes about paintings of sturdy, ancient oaks standing proud and firm in the snow, or silhouetted against an arching sky on a vast plain, with mountains in the blue distance. Ghostly ships, slipping their moorings to float silently in a crepuscular mist under an achingly portentous sky, all that moonlight, all those mountains, may well be seen to symbolise life, or death, or the beckoning beyond. But there are some kinds of poetic language that are closed to us now.\n\nFriedrich wants to make us feel awe, sorrow, hope, mortality, immortality, and probably much more besides. In a way, I much prefer his portrait of his wife, standing against the light, with her back to us, at an open window overlooking the Elbe. She gazes at the poplar trees on the far bank, the bare masts and rigging of sailing boats moored on the river. The dark room, the world beyond, the woman at the window: we watch her watching the world, as she stands at the sill.\n\nMuch later in the show, there is a painting by Adolph Menzel of an empty room, painted in 1845. The door to the balcony is open, the light filters into the room through a translucent curtain. The painting seems to ask us questions about what is real, what is reflected, what is painted. It is an inconsequential view of an unoccupied room on a sunny day, with the light coming in. We are made aware of the light, how it moves through the room, catches on a chair back and on a picture frame, pools on the polished floor. The air in the room feels very present. We are aware, somehow, that the painter is in the room, observing, and that he has bought us with him.\n\nThere is, for me, something unnerving and uncanny about this little picture, painted on a piece of cardboard. You could never say that it is a great painting, but that doesn't matter. It feels like a lived moment. There must be a reason for my being attracted to this essentially minor work. It is just so much more convincing, for example, than all those ghastly Nazarenes, whose religious aspirations took them to live a sort of monkish life in Italy, and who tried to paint like early Renaissance masters. All that medievalism in Carl Philipp Fohr and Moritz von Schwind, with their castles, maidens and chivalry, the fancy dress of tights and pointy shoes, all that windy nonsense.\n\nOddly, these visions take me to another Menzel, this time a view from his apartment window, overlooking the garden of Prince Albert's palace. We see a corner of the palace beyond the trees and, below us, workmen asleep in the grass. These distant, minor figures have a certain Breughelian appeal. Although the painting is almost pure description, history is palpable in it in a way Menzel could not have predicted. The distant palace later became the headquarters of the SS, and was bombed and destroyed at the end of the second world war. There it is, across the way, unaware of the future, basking in the afternoon sun.\n\nPaintings can never really remain themselves. They accrue history, and new associations inevitably adhere to to them. Menzel is a sort of star of the show. His output was enormously varied, ranging from these everyday scenes to gaslit nights at the theatre, Wilhelm I passing along the Unter den Linden in his carriage, the populace looking on, the flags strangled on their poles in the breeze.\n\nSuch scenes of modern life are complemented by creepy paintings of fragments of life-casts and death masks hung on Menzel's studio wall, viewed in the flickering candlelight. His vast painting of an iron-rolling mill, depicting the Stygian, clamouring industrial inferno, is filled with danger. To move from this painting to Menzel's dinner at a crowded ball, the dripping gilded scene, the tiaras, dresses, chandeliers, is a delirious, vertiginous shift.\n\nIf Menzel is a sort of hero of the show, Anton von Werner is the arch-conservative villain of the piece. Werner's 1894 painting of a group of Prussian soldiers lounging about in a requisitioned French chateau near Versailles - a memory of the Franco-Prussian war in 1870 - is grimly conservative, filled with anecdotal incident. The Prussian officers muddy the carpet with their boots, and sing a Schumann lied around the piano. A fragment of the song is engraved on a little metal plaque attached to the picture's frame. Later they'll loot the place, as the painter recalled. Director of the Berlin Academy of Art, and president of the Association of Berlin Artists, Werner does not dwell on the horrors of the Prussian siege of Paris in 1870. Instead, he makes us think of the soldiers billeted far from home, singing the songs of Schumann, while the house's concierge and son look on from the doorway.\n\nWhat the painting says to us now, about its author, about the Prussian militarist spirit, about pride and sentimentality, and aesthetics, cannot fail to be of interest. It is a document of a mentality. It also became a popular commercial tapestry for the patriotic home.\n\nArt museums, as much as they have become repositories of the great and the good, the advanced and the avant-garde, should always keep a place for things like this. They are part of the spirit of an age, as much as any Beckmann, any Friedrich."
