        "text": "A member of the Dada movement from 1917 to 1920, George Grosz satirized corrupt bourgeois society. As the moving force behind the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) movement, his attacks began to focus on the rising Nazi party. Constantly in trouble with the authorities, he continued to express his revulsion with postwar Germany. The title The Pillars of Society refers to a play by Henrik Ibsen. It shows an old aristocrat in the foreground, his head full of the pageant of war, sporting a dueling scar on his cheek. In his hands he holds a beer glass and a foil. His monocle is opaque—he cannot see. On the left is a nationalist with a chamber pot on his head clutching his newspapers. To the right a Social Democrat, his head full of steaming dung, holds a flag and socialist flyer. Behind them is a clergyman, bloated and preaching peace while the city burns and mayhem continues behind him. Grosz’s painting is in the Nationalgalerie. (Wendy Osgerby)\n\nGerard ter Borch painted mainly portraits and genre scenes, treating his subjects with a cultivated elegance and paying infinite attention to details, especially the texture of fabrics. Gallant Conversation is particularly beautiful in its delicate handling of the figures. The subject of the painting is ambiguous; it has also been called The Paternal Admonition. There is something sensuous in the pose of the figure with her back turned to the viewer; little can be seen of her except for a glimpse of silver-rose skin at the back of her neck. Ter Borch’s work was imbued with an elegant grace, his careful scenes shot through with rich and warm coloring, and his virtuoso depiction of fabrics and textiles was virtually unequaled. This painting is in the Gemäldegalerie. (Tamsin Pickeral and the Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica)\n\nDeath was a recurring theme in the work of Swiss painter Arnold Böcklin, and so it is fitting that the most famous image of him should be this striking self-portrait. From the mid-1850s, Böcklin developed a highly personal, allegorical art peopled with figures out of myth, legend, and superstition. Fleeing Paris at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, Böcklin and his family settled in Munich. Several of his children had died in infancy and a cholera epidemic loomed; it may not be surprising, then, that his paintings from this period should be full of morbidity. Working in the Romantic tradition, this self-portrait (in the Alte Nationalgalerie) epitomizes the conception of the artist as heroic individual, gazing haughtily at the viewer in bold chiaroscuro. The leering figure of Death seems to simultaneously undercut this idea and reinforce it. Böcklin may be listening intently to Death’s tune, but is he acknowledging life’s transience or defying Death and suggesting his art will secure him an immortality denied to most? In the coming years he produced the work for which he is most famous, paintings with dreamlike qualities that linked him with the Symbolist school and influenced the Surrealists. At the time of his death, Böcklin was regarded as the greatest painter in the Germanic world—indeed, the second movement of Gustav Mahler’s Symphony No. 4, “Death Takes the Fiddle,” which premiered that year, was inspired by this painting. In 2001 the Swiss issued a stamp reproducing this self-portrait to mark the centenary of the artist’s death. Tellingly, Death is absent. (Richard Bell)\n\nAt first glance, this painting resembles those of the French Impressionists. In fact, it was produced by a German painter and engraver popular during his lifetime for historical works glorifying Prussian power. From around 1840, Adolph von Menzel began to produce low-key interiors and landscapes that used his talent as a Realist in a progressive way. In The Balcony Room, a flimsy curtain blows over the open door of a balcony as a shaft of sunlight cuts dramatically across the floor. A chair is positioned just inside the balcony doors, caught in the light to reveal its delicate elegance. Highlights glance off another chair and off a large mirror, itself reflecting part of the room we cannot see. Fluid brushstrokes evoke the effect of strong sunlight outside the room and the way delicate material lifts in a breeze. It seems a simple picture: the corner of an unremarkable room with haphazardly placed objects, but it is filled with mood and mystery. The viewer is curious about the rest of the room and the world outside. Menzel’s genre paintings have unorthodox viewpoints. The off-center composition here, chopped off at each side as a casual snapshot of everyday life, anticipates French Impressionism, as does the free brushwork, natural light effects, and use of reflections. Curiously, Menzel kept paintings like this hidden and disparaged Impressionism when it came along. Only after his death did such works gain the admiration they deserve. This painting is in the Alte Nationalgalerie. (Ann Kay)\n\nKarl Friedrich Schinkel was a Prussian Neoclassical architect and painter who designed some of Berlin’s grandest architecture. Born in Brandenburg and a student of Friedrich Gilly in Berlin, Schinkel decided at the 1810 Berlin art exhibition that he would never reach a mastership in painting and turned his talents to architecture, creating in his lifetime the Neue Wache, the Schauspielhaus at the Gendarmenmarkt, and the Altes Museum. A noted proponent of Classical revival, he defined a distinct Teutonic style based on the vocabulary of ancient Greek mythology and architecture. The Temple of Isis and Osiris Where Sarastro Was High Priest is the background set design for the final scene of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s The Magic Flute in which Sarastro, the wise priest of Isis and Osiris King of the Underworld, releases Pamina and others from the influence of the Queen of the Night. Emanuel Schikaneder, who wrote the original libretto, Mozart, and Schinkel himself were all Freemasons. The opera’s ideas are Masonic in content and echo Enlightenment motifs: Sarastro’s symbolizes the sovereign who rules with reason, wisdom, and enlightened insight, overcoming the irrational darkness. The beasts in the columns are protectors of the underworld; as such, they are an innovative variation on the Greek temples commonly used in Schinkel’s real-life architecture. In this, the last scene, the electric sky is dominated by architecture representing the justice and order of the enlightened Greek spirit. This painted set is held by the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin. (Sara White Wilson)\n\nIn 1925 the Bauhaus moved to Dessau. Paul Klee joined the staff in 1926. Although he was in charge of the bookbinding workshop (and later the glass painting workshop), it was arguably his lecture series on the theory of form, given from 1921 to 1931, that had the most influence, not only on his students but also on his own work. By 1931 the preparatory notes and drawings ran to thousands of pages. In 1926 he went to Porquerolles Island and Corsica for some inspiration. He said that he wanted something to stimulate the harmonies inside him, “small or big adventures in color.” He was probably thinking of the effects of an earlier trip with August Macke to Tunisia. He was not disappointed. Two-thirds of this composition is muddy brown and a third is dark blue. A small town rises from the mud. The title is ambiguous and could refer to a place, a musical key or perhaps the capital letter G with its cross bar that is echoed in the curl of the town. The perspective is askew—the irregular buildings tilt crazily. Roads become ramps and go nowhere. Flags flutter in all directions regardless of the wind. It may be permanently late afternoon in this deserted toy town of colored bricks despite the night sky above. However, in spite of the jauntiness, there is a mathematical precision. It is Bach and not Offenbach. Klee was in a constant search for harmonies of color and form, which resulted in a great diversity of style. Part of G is in the Nationalgalerie’s collection.
