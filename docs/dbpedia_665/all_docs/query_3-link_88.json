        "text": "Camille Pissarro's Effect on Impressionism\n\n1951 Words | 4 Pages\n\nChanging characteristics that made art unique in the mid-nineteenth century sparked the new impressionist movement headed by Pissarro that only gave the general idea of what the painting was actually of. The movement was seen as a counter to the very strict, detailed, and precise traits of art before this movement. The focus on technique was immense before impressionism, and because the revolutionary type of art seemed to discard all of these ideas, it was seen as a radical movement. One of the most important factors in the art itself in this movement was the use of light. In impressionism, artists use lighting to draw the viewer’s eye across the painting. It is also used to set the mood...\n\nThe Foundry History\n\n2794 Words | 6 Pages\n\nThe Foundry, defined by Joel Garreau in his book called The Nine Nations of North America, is an area compiled of cities in the Northeast Corridor such as New York City and Philadelphia to the cities near The Great Lakes. The Foundry is located in the Northeastern section of the Continental U.S. With cities such as NYC, Philadelphia, Chicago, and others, The Foundry is by far the most populous area in the United States. The common characteristic that ties most of the cities in The Foundry to each other is industrialization, thus the Northeast also being dubbed the “Rust Belt” (Rust Belt). Even though it is the Industrial heart of the U.S., The Foundry is not limited to coal and manufacturing, but stretches out to agriculture as well. That being said, to truly get an understanding about The Foundry, one would have to go back to the Age of Industrialization to appreciate the string that ties these cities together. But even with such a big part of history tying The Foundry together, every city and area in it, whether small or big, has its own unique taste and culture that differentiates one from the other. From their physical geographies to their cultures, each make up what the United States is, a land of diversity. From Detroit, Michigan’s Motown Blues and Chicago’s Great Lakes to New York City’s Broadway, Ivy League schools, and Niagara Falls, The Foundry is made up of a variety of people, land, and cultures.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution's Impact On The American World\n\n1024 Words | 3 Pages\n\nThe Industrial Revolution was a time of great inventiveness and insight which would change the world, forever. Machines were being developed that did not require manpower or horsepower, and did work at a far greater output than its human counterparts could ever hope match. Likewise, thanks to the inventions of mass transit resources, products, and people were being transported across the country in greater numbers, at far greater rates. Of course, this in turn had great impact, not only on the American’s whose world was built through these new machines and factories, forged in the Industrial Revolution, and who, themselves, came to enjoy the products of such inventions; It also had tremendous effect on how American society came to view\n\nBritain's Industrial Revolution: A Bittersweet Success\n\n1759 Words | 4 Pages\n\nThe Industrial Revolution of Britain took place from 1780 and throughout the 19th century, during this time period, Britain thrived off extreme production rates and this caused Britain to become the top country in the world to produce goods so rapidly during the 18th century. Although, the growing success of Britain had a fatal price. The revolution changed the culture of Britain, manufacturing was no longer a task done in the home but now became centralized in the factory. The birth of factories brought child labor, dense living conditions, urbanization, and changes in economy, but the factories were not just the whole part of the revolution. Many inventions were created and their impacts were substantial when reviewing the overall revolution.\n\nThomas Cole\n\n2078 Words | 5 Pages\n\nThomas Cole was born on February 1, 1801 in Bolton, Lancashire, England. Due to financial problems his family endured, Cole, at the ripe old age of just fourteen, had to find work to assist with the family needs. He entered the work force as a textile printer and wood engraver in Philadelphia. In 1819, Cole returned to Ohio where his parents resided. Here, a portrait painter by the name of Stein, would become Cole’s primary teaching vehicle and inspiration for his oil techniques we’ve come to be familiar with. During this time, Cole was extremely impressed by what he saw in the landscapes of the New World and how different they were from the small town of England from whence he hailed. Self taught, art came naturally to Cole.\n\nCultural Impact of the Railway of Victorian England\n\n2439 Words | 5 Pages\n\nAt the beginning of the industrial revolution in England during the mid-nineteenth century, the railroad was the most innovative mode of transportation known. The British Rail system was a forerunner in railroad technology, uses, and underground engineering. Though the rail system was extremely slow at first and prohibitively expensive to build and run, the British were not to be dissuaded in their pursuit of non-animal driven transportation. The most advanced mode of transportation prior to the introduction of the rail system was the horse drawn omnibus on a track, called a tram. This paper will examine the rail system from a cultural perspective, presenting the impact the railway had on everyday lives in Victorian London and its surrounding communities.\n\nGerman Modernism\n\n952 Words | 2 Pages\n\nAccording to Ecksteins, the formation of these industries gave Germany the opportunity to develop as a culture. Industry facilitated culture by shifting a large part of the population out of the countryside and into the city. “In 1870 Germany’s population was two thirds rural; by 1914 that relationship had been reversed? This gave German industry the possibility of transmitting their ideas to a large audience. The formation of the modern man and women was born. Also, one must conclude that the shift out of the countryside brought an influx of diverse beliefs into German cities. Germans who had previously lived under certain beliefs were introduced to several new convictions. Suddenly Germany transformed itself from a close-minded nation, to one, which was open to change. This newfound acceptance of change facilitated a general belief that Germany had become the most modern state of that time."
