        "text": "They were contemporaries, the two big painters of the Romantic movement in Germany. They tried to make visual the nonvisible, that is, to show the Divine in earthly manifestations. Both viewed the study of Nature -- God's doing -- as a religious observance, and their imagery was deeply spiritual. It isn't too much to say, in fact, that the profound but sometimes twaddlesome Northern mysticism later expressed by Wagner and Nietzsche can be read in the work of Caspar David Friedrich (1774-1840) and Philip Otto Runge (1777-1810).\n\nFriedrich's was a melancholy vision, expressed in sagas of trees, rocks and mountains, somber lighting effects and Gothic ruins set in brooding landscapes. In his work, symbolism was rife -- a tree, for example, depending on its leafage or nudity, could betoken life or death. And he understood how natural effects could strike a chord in the viewer: a peculiar rock formation, a blasted tree, a distant horizon.\n\nRunge was attuned to more spontaneous, concrete close-ups of nature: babies, leaves, flowers, water in the form of flowing springs. His ambition was nothing less than to communicate a sense of human kinship with the universe in all of its parts. But he died at 33, leaving only fragments of a grand visual scheme.\n\nFriedrich and Runge dominate ''Romanticism to Realism: 19th-Century German Drawings,'' a small-scale show at the Pierpont Morgan Library. It presents work by some 40 artists, ranging in date from 1783 to the 1830's and including names -- besides the two stars -- like Adolph von Menzel, Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein, Josef Platzer and Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld.\n\nTruth to tell, German art of the 19th century was by no means Europe's most exciting. Yet this show, mostly assembled from the Morgan's own holdings -- but including promised gifts from Eugene V. and Claire Thaw, along with loans from Charles Ryskamp, the library's former director -- is a gourmet presentation, the kind one expects from the Morgan.\n\nFriedrich's mournful watercolor ''Moonlit Landscape'' (probably done between 1830-1835), is a fairly typical example of his work, packed with yearning references to the eternal order of nature against the chaos of human life. It portrays a nocturnal landscape with trees and water illuminated by a pale moon and streaks of cloud that hang low over gentle slopes. The only human traces are a rustic fence and a dark statue set among the trees, thought to be that of the Virgin in her role of Mater Dolorosa. Aside from its spiritual aims, the work shows Friedrich's interest in the effects of color and light, which made him a pioneer of plein-air painting in Germany.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
