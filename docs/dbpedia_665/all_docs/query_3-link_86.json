        "text": "The best understanding of art comes with a background that takes much time and effort to acquire. I’ll take a chance and try to reduce this time to a few minutes. Naturally, the effect will not be so tangible, but I’ll try to throw some light on art styles from Renaissance till Modernism.\n\nTo put the puzzle together properly, I’ll start from the earliest movements that appeared after the Medieval Art period.\n\nRenaissance (14th c.-16th c.)\n\nDepressed and shackled by medieval morals, the Italian artists of the 1400s united their urges for liberty into the Renaissance movement (fr. “rebirth”) which gradually spread throughout Europe. This struggle was also accompanied by individualism and an impassioned dive into the contemporary scientific investigation of nature and humans. Probably, that’s why during this period much attention was devoted to the genre of the portrait. The neglect of blanket religious restrictions gave rise to modern views on social and cultural life. Apart from that, the access to Classical works in advanced mathematics, philosophy, and early Christian theology inspired artists to return to cherishing nature and humans similar to their antique admirers.\n\nThe most distinguished Renaissance artists are, among others, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Sandro Botticelli, Raphael, and Giambologna.\n\nBaroque (17th c.-19th c.)\n\nDerived from the Portuguese, the term “Baroque” means “oddly shaped pearl”, indicating its intentions to combine contradictional artistic elements into a lush, dramatic, and vital image. The Renaissance’s exquisite symmetry and balance transformed into the Baroque’s spectacular disorder which still kept the form of solemnity and splendor. One of the most popular Baroque painting subjects is motion or the moment before a pronounced movement. Such facets are discerned in the works of Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, Lorenzo Bernini, Jan Vermeer, and Peter Paul Rubens.\n\nRococo (17 c.)\n\nThe Rococo movement is known for its ornamental and bright-colored details and is usually associated with architecture. The term Rococo is derived from the French word “rocaille” meaning “rock and shell ornamentation”. Representatives of this exuberant style rebel against the inherent proportional and distinctive forms of Baroque.\n\nClassicism (16 c. — beg. 19 c)\n\nAlong with Baroque and Rococo, in the 16th century in Italy there emerged a rational, logical, and strict art movement called Classicism. Similar to Renaissance postulates, it turns to examples of ancient culture considering them to be the pinnacle of perfection and eternal beauty. Following the established firm canons, Classicist artists try to ennoble the reality applying balance, explicitness, and harmony to the art forms.\n\nThe evolution of Classicism contains two separate periods:\n\nthe first covers the second half of the 17th c. when it reached its height in France and became the official art of the Absolutist monarchy.\n\nduring its second period (18c.–19c.), Classicism reflects the ideals of the concurrent Age of Enlightenment, such as fraternity, liberty, and tolerance. The late Classicism (Academism) acquired such characteristics as grandeur and luxury.\n\nSentimentalism (18 c.)\n\nThe name of this art style is derived from the French word “sentiment” which means “feeling”. Thus, Sentimentalism celebrated touchingness and nostalgia, trying to expose the deepest emotional sense hidden in the human soul and nature. The representatives of this movement made a fundamental contribution to the evolution of portrait and landscape painting.\n\nStriving to hook the viewer with its lyric and excitable subjects, the artists avoid the mythological topics and lush elements intrinsic to Classicism, portraying the uniqueness and cheerfulness of life, deliberately missing out on its grim sides. Such a trick inevitably causes disappointment in reality which is very different from the idyll pictured on canvases.\n\nHere is what Oscar Wilde said about Sentimentalism: “A sentimentalist is simply one who wants to have the luxury of an emotion without paying for it. We think we can have our emotions for nothing. We cannot. Even the finest and most self-sacrificing emotions have to be paid for.”\n\nRomanticism (late 18th c. — mid 19th c.)\n\nWith its companion Sentimentalism, Romanticism goes completely against the dogmas of the previous style. This means that the balance, idealism, and rationality of Clasicism are neglected and replaced by emotion, imagination, and inspiration. We can even dare say that Romanticism rebelled against any formalities in art allowing the artists to express their feelings freely. Senses are more important than reason, so the inner sentiments are best conveyed spontaneously and individually.\n\nThe subject of romanticistic artwork usually focuses on an outstanding figure, an ideal, often affected by deep and passionate emotions.\n\nRealism (19 c. — Nowadays)\n\nAs an art movement Realism was initiated by Gustave Courbet in the second half of the XIX century in France. The era of Industrial and Commercial Revolutions made the mythical and pretentious subjects fade away into the past. Art was made to reflect scenes that were closer to real life. Usually, these were pictures of the everyday middle-class life, the problems and pleasures of a common man.\n\nDark, gloomy colors confront the delightful bright tones of the previous periods. With its revolutionary non-conformist ideas, Realism is considered the first step in establishing the Modernism movement.\n\nThe most famous Realism artists are Gustave Courbet, Jean-François Millet, Adolph Menzel, Honoré Daumier, and Ilya Repin.\n\nImpressionism (19 c. — Nowadays)\n\nFrance was, as well, the fatherland of the Impressionism movement which was introduced in the 1860s. This term was first applied by an art critic Louis Leroi as a reaction to a Parisian exhibition organized by a group of painters including Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Camille Pissarro, and Edgar Degas who showed their extraordinary works. Unlike the standards of the previous styles, impressionist painters render the world the way they see it and feel it in their way. The most distinguished characteristics of their technique include loose visible brush strokes, blurred lines, and light colors. The most popular subjects are landscapes, seascapes, and images of suburban life.\n\nModernism (the end of 19th c. — Nowadays)\n\nAccording to historians, Modernism is the uniting term for a sequence of art movements beginning from Realism by Gustave Courbet and it includes post-Imperssionism, Cubism, Symbolism, and Futurism. The main features inherent to all these styles are abstraction, experimentation, and defiance of dogmas of the classic art with its clarity, literalness, and romance.\n\nModernism’s establishment was greatly influenced by one of the most respected American art critics Clement Greenberg. In his influential essays, he presents Modernism as a way to draw attention to art by manifesting solely its intrinsic qualities. In his 1970s essay, he states that besides art and literature, Modernism encompasses everything that took place in the cultural life of that time.\n\nAvangard (1850-s — Nowadays )\n\nThe movement of Avangard can be paralleled with Modernism and it usually associates with the socialist ideas, whose follower was Gustave Courbet, actually the initiator of Modernism. The French word “avant-garde” means “foreguard” which is a forward part of an army pushing the boundaries ahead. Avangard artists strive to broaden the established limits of art by breaking traditional cultural rules and forms. Regarding pictorial art, Avangard includes the following styles: Abstractionism, Cubism, Primitivism, Dadaism, Suprematism, and more.\n\nThe most prominent Avangard artists are Salvador Dali, Pablo Picasso, Kazimir Malevich, Henry Matisse, and many others.\n\nCover Up\n\nEach of these art movements evokes admiration — the unbelievable attention to detail and the perfection of techniques are impressive. Still, these features seem to drastically change as Modernism comes into play, don’t they? You might even think that this is a kind of degradation of art. Anyway, I’ve made a short investigation of those changes."
