        "text": "Adolph Menzel - Procession in Hofgastein [1880]\n\nWhen this painting was shown in Munich and Berlin in the 1880s and 1890s, critics marvelled at Menzel’s ability to depict the ritual procession of Catholic clergy and laity in traditional dress through a picturesque village (in Austrian). But the painting offers more than a straightforward rendering of its subject: it also comments on the deep social and confessional divisions in the Germany of Menzel’s day. It does so, in part, by creating a sense of disjuncture between the members of the procession and those who either watch or appear in proximity to it. Ultimately, Menzel refuses to provide any easy narrative resolution to this confused scene of dignity and chaos, and to the unfathomable sentiments he has captured in paint. The only sense of coherence is pictorial, achieved by way of the diagonal that helps organise the space of the painting. Indulging his painterly impulses, Menzel celebrates the glorious dance of sunlight and the bold colours of the festive costumes. Greater truths remain as open to interpretation as the indistinct mountains in the background.\n\n[Neue Pinakothek, Munich - Oil on canvas, 51.3 x 70.2 cm]\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nArticle 0\n\nGandalf's Gallery was founded as a non-profit making, educational website dedicated to the exhibition of art.

In this painting of a duet or music lesson momentarily interrupted, the amorous theme is reinforced by the picture of Cupid with raised left arm dimly visible in the background; the motif is derived from a popular book on emblems of love published in 1608 and symbolises fidelity to a single lover.\n\n[Frick Collection, New York - Oil on canvas, 39.4 x 44.5 cm]\n\n↧\n\nJohannes Vermeer - Lady with Her Maidservant Holding a Letter -[1667-68]\n\nThe subject of writing and receiving letters, which recurs frequently in Vermeer’s work, is given an exceptional sense of dramatic tension in this painting of two women arrested in some moment of mysterious crisis. The lack of final modelling in the mistress’ head and figure and the relatively plain background indicate that this late work by Vermeer was left unfinished. Nevertheless, the artist seldom if ever surpassed the subtly varied effects of light seen here as it gleams from the pearl jewellery, sparkles from the glass and silver objects on the table, and falls softly over the figures in their shadowy setting. Bought by Mr. Frick in 1919, the year of his death, this painting was his last purchase and joined Rembrandt’s Self-Portrait, Holbein’s Sir Thomas More, Bellini’s St. Francis, and Velázquez’ King Philip IV among his favourite acquisitions.\n\n[Frick Collection, New York - Oil on canvas, 90.2 x 78.7 cm]\n\n↧\n\nJohannes Vermeer - A Lady Writing [c.1665-66]\n\nAbove all, Johannes Vermeer was a painter of light. In this exquisite painting, diffused light softly illuminates the tabletop, the woman’s face, and her rich lemon-yellow morning jacket. Accents on the pearls decorating her jewellery box, her earrings, and her satin hair ribbons further enliven the image. The woman’s open gaze engages the viewer, which suggests that the painting may be a portrait instead of a generalised portrayal of a young woman at her writing table.\n\nJohannes Vermeer became a master in the Saint Luke’s Guild of Delft on December 29, 1653. At that time he specialised in history painting, and his first works were large-scale mythological and religious paintings. Shortly thereafter he began to paint the genre scenes, landscapes, and allegories for which he has become so renowned. Even though Vermeer's subject matter changed in the mid-1650s, he continued to imbue his later works with the quiet, intimate moods he had preferred in his early history paintings. His oeuvre is small: only thirty-five paintings are currently attributed to the master.\n\n[National Gallery of Art, Washington - Oil on canvas, 45 x 40 cm]\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nArticle 0\n\nGandalf's Gallery was founded as a non-profit making, educational website dedicated to the exhibition of art.

In Homer's Odyssey, Penelope, awaiting the return of her husband Odysseus from the Trojan War, was beset by suitors who claimed that Odysseus had been shipwrecked. She promised to marry one of them after she completed a shroud for her father-in-law. Steadfastly loyal to her absent husband, Penelope unraveled her weaving at the end of each day to avoid remarrying.\n\nWright presented Penelope late at night, rewinding her thread into a ball. In the foreground, the backlit statue of Odysseus invokes his presence. Moonlight bathes the sleeping figure of their son Telemachus while Penelope looks on. The strong effect of light and dark contributes to the hushed atmosphere and increases the drama of Penelope's plight.\n\n[Getty Centre, Los Angeles - Oil on canvas, 41.625 x 51.75 inches]\n\n↧\n\nÉdouard Leon Cortès - Place de la Madeleine\n\nÉdouard Leon Cortès (Lagny-sur-Marne, April 26, 1882 - Lagny-sur-Marne, November 26, 1969) was a French post-impressionist painter, He is known as\";Le Poete Parisien de la Peinture\" or \"the Parisian Poet of Painting\" because of his diverse Paris cityscapes in a variety of weather and night settings.\n\n[Sold for £11,250 at Sotheby’s, London - 24 x 33 cm]\n\n↧\n\nMatthias Stom - Pilate Washing His Hands\n\n[Musée du Louvre, Paris - Oil on canvas]\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nArticle 0\n\nGandalf's Gallery was founded as a non-profit making, educational website dedicated to the exhibition of art.

His work was primarily historical, but also included landscapes, portraits and religious subjects. A passionate artist with great skill in composition, Tardieu exhibited in various salons, and achieved considerable success. He took part in a number of exhibitions in the Louvre between 1806 and 1823. In 1808 he was granted a housing allowance. The great majority of his works were bought by the government or commissioned by the government.\n\n[Musée du Louvre, Paris - Oil on canvas]\n\n↧\n\nJoke Frima - Simulacrum\n\nJoke Frima was born in The Hague in 1952 and currently lives and works in France. Although she attended two art schools in The Netherlands, Frima had to go to Florence to find the kind of training she was looking for. There she was under the tutelage of the elderly signora Simi, who taught drawing and painting just as her own father had taught her: by studying plaster feet, terracotta jugs, and living models. Frima trained six hours a day, six days a week. The result of this training is a keen eye for detail and a steady hand for form. Yet her paintings and drawings are not simply reflections of her retinal images. Although nature and vegetation play a strong role in her work, she chooses her subjects carefully and meticulously sets them in sometimes almost surreal compositions. The intense light and powerful concentration lends an other-worldly quality to her work.\n\n[Art Renewal Centre Salon - Oil on linen, 74.8 x 35.34 inches]\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nArticle 0\n\nGandalf's Gallery was founded as a non-profit making, educational website dedicated to the exhibition of art.

The highlight of Schönberger artistry came in the late 1920s and early 1930s. This period was characterised not only by the creation of several masterpieces with an individual character, but also by many public appearances - Schönberger exhibited his work in several galleries in Hungary and abroad. In 1929, his work was exhibited in Nuremberg at an exhibition where contemporary Hungarian art was all the rage.\n\n[Bukowski’s Modern Sale, Stockholm - Oil on canvas, 77.5 x 58 cm]\n\n↧\n\nJan Lievens - The Young Draftsman [c.1630]\n\nThe Young Draftsman is an early work by Jan Lievens. Until 1631, while they were both still living in Leiden, Lievens was the colleague and great rival of Rembrandt. The two served apprenticeships together under Pieter Lastman and then shared a studio. Lievens subsequently went his own artistic way before moving to Amsterdam in 1655, shortly before Rembrandt’s bankruptcy, where he eventually died like the latter in great poverty. This depiction of a young draftsman is simultaneously a genre painting and the description of a profession. As such, it shows Lievens at the peak of his early mastery.\n\nThe intimate studio scene captivates with the warm tones of its brown, yellow, and beige palette and seems imbued with an inner golden light. The young artist sits in the foreground engrossed in his reading, while open in front of him is a large sketchbook revealing a study of the head of the statue standing before him. This figure is a plaster cast of the Infant Jesus from Michelangelo’s famous Madonna and Child that had stood in the Church of Our Lady in Bruges since 1506. Jesus looks down benevolently on the young draftsman and his work. On the right, another famous sculpture can be seen in the shadows: the bust of Emperor Vitellius.\n\n[Musée du Louvre, Paris - Oil on wood, 124 x 100 cm]\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nPieter de Hooch - A Man Smoking and a Woman Drinking in a Courtyard [c.1658-60]\n\n[Mauritshuis, The Hague - Oil on canvas, 78 x 65 cm]\n\n↧\n\nPieter Codde - Merry Company with Masked Dancers [1636]\n\nPieter Codde was known for his skill at rendering interior subjects such as soldiers in guardrooms, merry companies, tavern scenes, and other subjects, Codde was a leading practitioner of such scenes in Amsterdam. He was also a fine portrait painter, but his genre subjects have brought him his greater fame. A lifelong resident of Amsterdam, Codde was chiefly influenced by Frans Hals, who was active in nearby Haarlem.\n\n[Mauritshuis, The Hague - Oil on panel, 50 x 76.5 cm]\n\n↧\n\nGerard van Honthorst - Allegory of Painting [1648]\n\nIn this painting, Van Honthorst conflates allegory and portraiture. The female sitter uses the tools of the trade, brushes, palette, and mahlstick, to finish the fictive canvas bearing a portrait. Though she is represented as Pictura, the personification of painting, she is at the same time a specific woman, perhaps a studio model. Cupid likewise balances allegory and the human realm. The painting he holds is thought to be Honthorst’s self-portrait.\n\n[Crocker Art Museum, Sacramento - Oil on canvas, 138 x 113 cm]\n\n↧"
