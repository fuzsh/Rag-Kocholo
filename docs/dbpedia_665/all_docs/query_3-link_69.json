        "text": "Romantic painters\n\nThe Romantic period in the 19th century spawned a number of influential painters. Many of them were inspired by the classical ideals of the previous century. In the United States, the Romantic movement gained momentum during the early years of the Industrial Revolution, and many of its artists influenced subsequent movements.\n\nRomantic paintings were an expression of national identity. Artists such as Theodore Gericault and Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson depicted the heroes of Napoleonic France. Hans Gude, meanwhile, painted the landscapes of Norway’s fjords. And in the United States, the Hudson River School focused on massive landscapes.\n\nRealist painters\n\nRealist painting was a revolutionary art movement that was born in the early nineteenth century. Artists of the 19th Century used a wide range of materials and techniques to create works that were as realistic as possible. Despite their radically different styles, realist paintings often featured a recognizable subject. Many of the Realists’ paintings had a distinctly political bent. A common theme among them was the exploitation of the lower class and their desire to be represented in high art. For example, Jean-Francois Millet completed a trio of paintings depicting the rural peasant class. Others, such as Rosa Bonheur, used the close observation of animals in slaughterhouses to create paintings of the same subject matter.\n\nGerman realist painters were also strongly influenced by the Realists of France and Switzerland. The 1868 Munich exhibition attracted the attention of several prominent Realist painters, including Adolph Menzel, Wilhelm Leibl, and Max Liebermann. These artists were influenced by Courbet’s methods of painting from nature. Moreover, they took cues from the Old Masters and borrowed from the Flemish painters. Other influential realists of the nineteenth century include the Macchiaioli group, who were known for their representations of rural life. In addition, Dutch realists included the Hague School, which influenced early Vincent Van Gogh.\n\nBarbizon School painters\n\nThe Barbizon School was a group of French painters who cultivated an artistic style that centered on natural lighting and landscape scenes. Their work was influenced by their surroundings, including the forest of Fontainebleau. Although their work is often associated with landscape scenes, they also portrayed peasant life.\n\nAmerican Barbizon painters took their lead from French Barbizon painters. They included William Morris Hunt (1824-1879) and George Inness (1825-1894). Their art exhibited a similar palette of cool, neutral colors, as well as their own unique style. Artists of the 19th Century preferred landscape subjects such as sunrise and sunset, rising mist, or moonlight.\n\nImpressionist painters\n\nImpressionism was a movement started by French painters in the late nineteenth century. Its members included Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, and Camille Pissarro. Impressionism was an independent movement that avoided the formality of the official annual Salon chosen by the Academy of Beaux-Arts. These painters drew criticism for the unfinished look of their paintings, but progressive writers praised their depiction of modern life.\n\nImpressionism Artists of the 19th Century changed the subject matter and imagery of art. Previously, artists portrayed religious scenes and the wealthy, but with Impressionism, common people were considered worthy subjects.\n\nPost-Impressionist painters\n\nThe Post-Impressionists rejected the idea of representing observed objects with realistic representations and instead focused on creating abstract patterns and forms. They also rejected the idea of idyllic subjects and used their paintings to express their own feelings. In addition, the Post-Impressionists emphasized the structural qualities of the work as well as the interrelations between colors.\n\nThe two movements are closely related in many ways, but they have distinct differences. Impressionism emerged in the late nineteenth century in France as an artistic response to a rapidly changing urban environment. Post-Impressionism emerged in the same century, as a reaction to impressionism.\n\nTraveling artists of the 19th century\n\nTraveling artists of the 19th century made art as they travelled across America and Latin America. Often inspired by the quest for knowledge, these artists captured the reality of distant lands. Their sophisticated epistemological model, which combined art and science, allowed them to understand the world better. They also produced thousands of oil paintings, aquarelles, and pencil sketches.\n\nTraveling artists of the 19th century faced many challenges, from hostile environments to illness. Many artists of the 19th century could not afford to travel on their own. Traveling by ship proved to be a hindrance to many, particularly in the late nineteenth century. Luckily, the first travel agency was established in 1855 by Thomas Cook. Traveling artists needed to book space on merchant ships or join expeditions as official recorders."
