Adolph Menzel was a leading German artist of the late 19th century, and a pioneer of German Realist painting. His career began shortly after taking over his late father’s lithography business as a young man, and by seventeen, Menzel was supporting his mother and siblings. Menzel began as a highly gifted and successful draftsman, and eventually turned to oil painting later on in his career. His works were acclaimed by viewers for his ability to create images of German everyday life and culture that were precise and sometimes as realistic as photographs. Beloved by his home country, most of Menzel’s works still remain in Germany, specifically in the museums of Berlin.
