        "text": "Biography\n\nearly publicity still\n\nNova Margery Pilbeam (1919-2015) was a British actress with notable performances in both theatre and film.\n\nShe attained early fame as a child stage actress before auditioning for Gaumont-British in 1934, leading to a starring role in the critical acclaimed Little Friend (1934) and a seven-year contract with the studio. This early success — she was frequently called \"the world's greatest child actress\" by the British press — led to a great deal of work in her teen years, most memorably in the 1930s films of Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934) and Young and Innocent (1937).\n\nIn September 1934, Pilbeam, accompanied by her mother Margery, travelled to America on a publicity trip with G-B studio head Michael Balcon and actor Jack Hulbert.[1]\n\nSpeaking to film critic C.A. Lejeune in 1936, Nova said, \"I should love to work with Hitchcock again, because he never seems to direct you, and yet you know all the time just what he's wanting. I think he's a splendid director.\"[2]\n\nIn October 1937, Hitchcock announced that he was intending to adapt a short story titled False Witness, by French author Marcel Achard, and that Pilbeam would star. However, this project was soon dropped in favour of The Lady Vanishes, which starred Margaret Lockwood.\n\nPilbeam was one of many actresses considered for the role of the second Mrs. de Winter in Rebecca (1940).[3]\n\nShe was married to the director Penrose Tennyson from 1939 until his death in a plane crash in July 1941. Her own brother, Anthony Stopher Pilbeam, was also killed in a plane crash in January 1944.[4] In April 1941, shortly before her husband's death, she escaped without injury when a heavy Luftwaffe bomb exploded close to the house she was staying in.[5]\n\nPilbeam was a guest on the BBC's Desert Island Discs programme in 1945.\n\nShe retired from acting in the early 1950s and was known to have lived in north London Highgate.\n\nNova Pilbeam died on 17 July 2015, aged 95.\n\nFilmography\n\nWith Hitchcock...\n\nThe Man Who Knew Too Much (1934) — cast: Betty Lawrence\n\nYoung and Innocent (1937) — cast: Erica Burgoyne\n\nFilm Frames\n\nSelection of film frames: Nova Pilbeam (click image to view larger version or refresh thumbnails)...\n\nImage Gallery\n\nImages from the Hitchcock Gallery (click to view larger versions or search for all relevant images)...\n\nSee Also...\n\narticles about Nova Pilbeam\n\nGenealogy\n\nborn Nova Margery Pilbeam 15/Nov/1919[6]\n\ndaughter of Arnold William Pilbeam (b. 1890)[7] and Margery Cecilia Pilbeam (b. 1896) née Stopher[8], who married 19/Jan/1919 at St John the Evangelist, Blackheath, London\n\nsister of Anthony Stopher Pilbeam (b. 1924)[9]\n\nmarried 19/Oct/1939 to Frederick Penrose Tennyson[10]\n\nmarried 1950 to radio journalist Alexander H.

According to newspaper reports, she was thrown forward and her head struck the windscreen. The driver of the other car, Ernest Arthur Hardy, was later fined £10 for careless driving. At the time, Pilbeam was living on Coombe Lane, Kingston Hill.[13]\n\nAccording to newspaper reports of her first wedding, Pilbeam set off for her honeymoon in Minehead, Somerset, wearing \"a dark navy-blue costume with pill-box hat banded by cerise coloured ribbon [and a] cherry-coloured velvet scarf\".[14]\n\nNova Pilbeam was listed as living at 70 Hampstead High Street from 1946-49.\n\nNova M.
