        "text": "Unleash the Spectrum\n\nThe Nova P300c is a 300W RGBWW LED Soft Light, and is also the first product in Aputure “Nova” Professional LED Panel product line. The P300c utilizes warm white and cool white LEDs, in addition to the typical RGB chipset used in color-mixing lights. This chipset increases its output, skin tone accuracy, and tonal variety compared to other RGB or RGBW LED fixtures, making it suited for any filmmaking environment. Combining the stellar color quality with an intense output of over 9,000lux at 1 meter, a CCT range of 2,000K-10,000K, and a peak tungsten SSI of 85, the Nova is Aputure’s most versatile light to date.\n\nStunningly Bright\n\nThe Nova P300c is capable of outputting over 9,000 lux, at a distance of 1 meter, while maintaining a wide 120° beam angle. By combining this intense output with the wide beam angle of a soft light source and 0-100% stepless dimming control, the P300c can easily fill large areas, allowing you to control the ambient lighting of your entire scene instantly.\n\nIncredibly Wide CCT Range\n\nThe Nova P300c features the most extensive expanded bi-color range of any Aputure light, capable of producing white light from 2,000K to 10,000K. The P300c also features the ability to adjust the white light’s green-magenta shift while in CCT mode, allowing you to match ambient lighting or manipulate the scene to your choosing.\n\nSuperior Color Rendition\n\nUsing a unique blend of color-accurate LEDs in this newer LED chipset, the Nova P300c achieves a tungsten SSI score of 85, and a D55 daylight SSI score of 74, outperforming equivalent industry-standard lights. And like all Aputure lights, the Nova P300c produces impeccable CRI and TLCI values of 95+ — even with a color temperature range of 2,000 to 10,000 kelvin.\n\nFull-Color Tunability\n\nBy using an RGBWW chipset that results in higher quality color mixing and spectral reproduction than typical RGB and RGBW LED fixtures, the Nova P300c can produce more than 90% of the colors within the Rec.2020 color space. The P300c features HSI, RGB, and industry-standard X,Y color controls, allowing for up to 1 billion color combinations and precise color matching. The Nova P300c even has a built-in preset library of over 300 industry-standard gels, for ease of access and fast-paced shooting environments.\n\nCompact, Adaptable Design\n\nThe Nova P300c utilizes a built-in power supply to support its 300W light engine, reducing the overall weight of the fixture, and simplifying the user experience. The P300c also utilizes a lightweight aluminum shell and yoke, and the same dual junior/baby pin featured on the Spotlight Mount, making it compatible with nearly any stand or rigging hardware.\n\nExtendable Control Box\n\nUnlike other fixtures, the Nova P300c uses an extendable handheld control box that connects to the light via a 5-pin XLR cable. With both a shorter 0.6m and a longer 3m head cable, the control box can be neatly mounted onto the rear of the panel for quick, compact setups, or snapped into the Lighting Clamp on a stand when rigging the fixture out of arm’s reach. Featuring an OLED display with three control knobs that allow users to fluidly move throughout the menu and adjust lighting parameters, the handheld control box provides a more ergonomic user experience. The control box also has four user-adjustable preset buttons to save and recall lighting parameters from any mode quickly.\n\nMultiple Control Methods\n\nLike other professional Aputure lights, the Nova P300c includes built-in 5-pin DMX512 and Sidus Mesh compatibility. Users can select one of the Nova’s several DMX profiles for more complex programming or use Sidus Mesh technology to control the P300c using any Sidus Link compatible smartphone or iPad, without any separate hardware modules.\n\nNew Power Solutions\n\nThe Nova P300c is Aputure’s first light to accept a wider 24V to 48V DC input range. Using a 3-pin XLR DC input, the Nova is compatible with a wide range of battery power options, from block batteries to 48V power stations, such as the Aputure 2- Bay Battery Power Station. With a variety of power solutions, the Nova can follow you into any filmmaking challenge.\n\nProfessional Light Modifiers\n\nDesigned specifically for the P300c, the Nova P300c Softbox is a 50x70cm rectangular softbox that seamlessly integrates into the fixture’s accessory slot. The larger surface area of the softbox allows you to create even softer light, as well as control the beam angle with the 40° fabric light control grid. Other industry-leading modifier manufacturers also compatible modifiers for the Nova P300c, including DoPchoice, Chimera, and Honeycrates. Together, with all of these manufacturers, the Nova is compatible with even more softboxes and light control grids, allowing you to adapt the P300c to any situation.\n\nHardshell Rolling Case\n\nUsers who take the P300c outside of the studio and on location can also purchase a hardshell rolling case. The Nova P300c Case includes custom laser-cut foam, ensuring that the P300c is always protected. Featuring wheels and a telescoping handle, this case will easily transport the Nova P300c to any film set.\n\nBuilt-in Lighting FX\n\nThe Nova P300c is Aputure’s first lighting fixture capable of supporting the full library of 15 lighting FX, including: Fireworks, Paparazzi, Faulty Bulb, Lightning, TV, Pulsing, Strobe, Explosion, Club Lights, Candle, Fire, Welding, Cop Car, Color Chase, and Party Lights. With the ever-evolving abilities of the Aputure and Sidus Link ecosystems, the P300c’s feature set will only continue to grow.\n\nThe Sidus Link Ecosystem\n\nAs the first professional color-mixing fixture in the Aputure product family, the Nova P300c joins the Sidus Mesh ecosystem, allowing for mobile control from a compatible smartphone or iPad with the Sidus Link app. With the Sidus Link Mesh Network, you can control up to 100 fixtures, including the LS C300d II, LS 300x, and MC, with each additional light fixture increasing the range of the network for a maximum range of up to 400 meters. Sidus Link allows users to control every aspect of a light’s output, including brightness, CCT, HSI, RGB, XY, Effects, Light Source presets, and even grants users the ability to match existing light sources or colors using the smartphone’s camera. And with the ability to save a virtually unlimited number of presets to your Sidus Link account, you’ll always be able to recall your favorite looks.\n\nThe Nova P300c is an incredibly powerful tool for any filmmaker. Whether you’re on a large film set with complex programming and light control needs or with a guerilla crew who needs to be able to match any new environment, the P300c will help you achieve your vision. Meet the first member of the Nova family."
