        "text": "The Next Wave\n\nThe Nova P600c represents the next generation of the Nova family of LED panels, building on the foundation of high color fidelity, 2,000K~10,000K CCT, and soft light quality while also featuring best-in-class output, and a new suite of professional-level controls.\n\nUnmatched Brightness\n\nWith its 600W RGBWW chipset, the Nova P600c is the brightest 2x1 Soft Panel on the market, boasting an output of 2,298 lux at 3 meters.\n\n4 Light Engines\n\nThe Nova P600c is the first Aputure fixture to feature multiple light engines and pixel control. Its multiple light engines can be activated when using the built-in lighting effects, or can be controlled independently via DMX.\n\nCurved Dual-Lock Yoke\n\nThe yoke on the Nova P600c has also undergone an upgrade, now featuring a curved design, similar to the LS 600d Pro and 600x Pro, allowing it to maintain tilt-control when using modifiers, which is difficult for traditionally designed straight yoke LED panels.\n\nCable-less Control Box\n\nIn addition to its 3 meter extension cable, the P600c's control box has been updated with contact pins integrated into the Lightning Clamp for completely cable-less operation.\n\nIntegrated Power Solutions\n\nThe Nova P600c features a built-in power supply, minimizing weight and setup time. It also features a 48V/15A 3-Pin XLR DC input for users who want to operate the fixture via quiet battery power solutions instead of noisy generators.\n\nSidus Link\n\nAs a member of the Aputure family, the Nova has integrated Sidus Mesh technology, allowing it to wirelessly network with other Sidus-enabled lights, all of which can be controlled through the Sidus Link mobile app.\n\nLumen Radio CRMX\n\nProfessional lights deserve professional-level connectivity. In addition to 5-Pin DMX512, lighting technicians can also control the Nova P600c wirelessly using its built-in Lumenradio CRMX.\n\nProfessional Modifiers\n\nThe Nova P600c can modified using a variety of tools, such as intensifiers, light control grids, and soft boxes, as well as third-party modifiers from brands including DoPchoice & Chimera."
