Die Mauer wird in 50 und auch in 100 Jahren noch bestehen bleiben, wenn die dazu vorhandenen Gründe noch nicht beseitigt worden sind. —Erich Honecker, January 19891\n\nCould Erich Honecker have known, when these words were spoken, that the very idea of the GDR was about to be threatened? We read these words today with a great feeling of irony; yet, they were intended as a declaration of the strength and solidarity of the SED2 and the GDR. As the coming years progressed these words would be regarded as the misguided ramblings of a leader attempting to prop up a failing government. The conflict between Honecker’s motivations and the later interpretation of his words; the present political situation in Germany, and the Wende’s representation in contemporary German literature were but a few of the issues we hoped to explore during the course of the fourteenth annual Interdisciplinary German Studies Conference, “Ossi Wessi,” held at the University of California, Berkeley (March 17-19, 2006). The volume that follows is a collection of the papers presented at that conference, and offers a sampling of research presently being conducted about Germany since the fall of the Berlin Wall. Truly, the history of the Berlin Wall begins not in 1961, or 1945. It began January 18, 1871 when Kaiser Wilhelm, declared the existence of a united, imperial, German nation: Wir übernehmen die Kaiserliche Würde in dem Bewußtsein der Pflicht, in Deutscher Treue die Rechte des Reiches und seiner Glieder zu schützen, den Frieden zu wahren, die Unabhängigkeit Deutschlands, gestützt auf die 1\n\n“In 1961 the situation in Europe was stabilized, the peace was saved...The Wall will in 50 even in 100 years persist in its existence, if the reasons for its presence have not been abolished.” (trans. Donald E. Backman) 2 Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschland (Socialist Unity Party of German)\n\nxii\n\nINTRODUCTION geeinte Kraft seines Volkes, zu verteidigen. Wir nehmen sie an in der Hoffnung, daß dem Deutschen Volke vergönnt sein wird, den Lohn seiner heißen und opfermütigen Kämpfe in dauerndem Frieden und innerhalb der Grenzen zu genießen, welche dem Vaterlande die seit Jahrhunderten entbehrte Sicherung gegen erneute Angriffe Frankreichs gewähren.3\n\nWith these equally famous words, Kaiser Wilhelm created the first version of a united Germany. His vision of the new Germany is that of an independent, united nation, whose strength derives from the strength of its people. The strength of his people will guide Wilhelm in his quest to maintain a lasting German peace. Since this time the German nation has been in almost constant turmoil, the ins and outs of which need not be detailed here. Suffice it to say that World War I, World War II, and the years 1945-1989 served to further delay Kaiser Wilhelm’s dream of a united, peaceful Germany. When the Berlin Wall fell on November 9, 1989 there was a feeling of hope, of wrongs righted, and of endless possibilities that swept the globe. There were discussions of the potential economic superpower that would be a united Germany, and there were discussions in the GDR of needing to protect their own interests in fear of being simply taken over by the FRG. Over the following 20 years some of these hopes and fears have become a reality, but the question of the German nation is still one that deserves further discussion. In the words of Benedict Anderson, The nation is imagined as limited because even the largest of them...has finite, if elastic, boundaries, beyond which lie other nations. ... Finally, it is imagined as a community, because, regardless of the actual inequality and exploitation that may prevail in each, the nation is always conceived as a deep, horizontal comradeship. (Anderson, 7)\n\nBut what does one do in a nation that has been forcefully divided into two nations, then at the behest of both nations reunited, only to find that they had lost a lot of the common ground that used to unite them? Does the 3\n\nWe assume the Imperial dignity in the awareness of the duty to protect, in German loyalty, the rights, the peace of the empire and its members; to defend the independence of Germany, founded on the united strength of its people. We assume it in the hope that the German people will be granted the reward for its heated battles, in which they willingly sacrificed, and that they will enjoy continuous peace within [Germany’s] borders, and bestow upon the fatherland protection against renewed attacks from France, which it has lacked for centuries. (trans. Donald E. Backman)\n\nOSSI WESSI\n\nxiii\n\ndeep, horizontal comradeship still exist? If so, is it strong enough to ever fully reunite the German people into one nation, or will they eternally be referred to as Ossis and Wessis? The story of the Berlin Wall is in this manner not entirely unlike that of the US Civil War. Although our war caused a rift and division that lasted only four years, there is still much talk of the differences between North and South. Recent debates about educational quality below the Mason-Dixon Line4, as well as issues surrounding the flying of the Confederate Flag serve to underline the fact that after 143 years we, in the United States, still struggle with our own issues of reunification. It is not our intention to hold the United States up as a paragon of reunification, but our situation is one that should receive more attention when the long German struggle for reunification is discussed. If the US is yet to overcome four years of separation it should come as no surprise that the Germans still struggle with similar issues. Unemployment is still at record levels in former East Germany, and the recent successes of the NPD5 in elections point toward continued dissatisfaction with the reunification process. In 2008, 18 years after reunification it is clear that the community everyone had imagined will be a long time coming. From the perspective of linguistics the situation is perhaps even more complicated. It was not until the Early New High German period (end of 14th century to the beginning of 18th century) that the German Language finally began moving toward unification. Before this, the German language and German speaking areas were strictly divided into dialects. The Early New High German period is not marked by any outstanding linguistic change in language. Most of the changes, such as diphthongization, umlauting, and compounding, had already started in the Old High German, Old Saxon and Middle High German periods and continued throughout the Early New High German Period. This period is mainly marked by the translations of the Bible by Martin Luther in the 16th century, which led to a long process of unification of German language. The Bible was available not only to nobles, but to each citizen of the German speaking realm and it was a strong encouragement for education, which can be seen through the works of several grammarians of that time, 4\n\nIn 2006 per capita spending on student education was below the national average in each of the states below the Mason-Dixon Line. (U.S. Department of Education 2008) 5 The Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands is a political party formed in the 1960’s and following a platform similar to that of the Nationalsozialistische Partei Deutschlands.\n\nxiv\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nsuch as Valentin Ickelsamer (16th century), Johannes Kolross (16th century), Hans Farbitius (15th-16th centuries). It seemed that the need to unify and make the German language more accessible to all citizens was the major task for many scholars. By the end of the 19th century the brothers Grimm expanded this research by tracing the roots of the German language and reconstructing them. They emphasized the identity of the ‘language’ and ‘people’ and stated that this identity is reflected not only in the current practice of the language, but also in the history of the language itself. The question is – what happened with Germany between 1945-1990 that led to a disunity of the German language as well as disunity of the state and the nation. Did the Wall separate the two Germanys politically and linguistically? Is it possible that after centuries of attempts to unite the German language, all of the work was undone in a mere 55 years? The rapid development of economic and cultural globalization during the 20th century contributed greatly to linguistic changes in many western European countries, including Germany. Since Germany was divided into two states, there was little or no communication between the two when decisions were being made as to which term to apply to certain objects. The terms originated independently in both states to designate the new objects, institutions, concepts, and processes. However, similar equivalents can be found in both states. Stevenson provides many examples, such as Ministerrat and Bundesregierung for ‘government’ in the GDR and the Federal Republic respectively6. However, there are more examples which indicate a specific term to one speech community or the other. Research for a sociolinguistic History of East and West in Germany performed by Patrick Stevenson indicates several interesting points. He starts by analyzing the divided Germany, between 1945-1990, and later continues with the effects of the Reunification of Germany between 19902000 on language and society. He designates several reasons why the German languages went different ways between 1945 and 1990. There were new words needed to indicate new things, institutions or terms in both states. However, due to the lack of communication many terms were specific to one speech community or the other. For example, in the GDR, the following terms were frequently used: Erweiterte Oberschule ‘secondary school’, Elternaktiv ‘parents’ work group’, Kombinat ‘combine’. In the Federal Republic, terms such as Gesamtschule 6\n\nFor more examples, see Stevenson, P. Language and German Disunity. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2002.\n\nOSSI WESSI\n\nxv\n\n‘comprehensive school’, Arbeitsmarkt ‘job market’, Konzern ‘business, firm’ are found. In both states, old words acquired different meanings. For example, Brigade designated ‘a small group of people working together in a socialist enterprise’ and ‘unit in the army’ in GDR and the Federal Republic respectively. Another category indicates different words being used to indicate the same or similar meaning. For example, ‘retirement home’ was Feierabendheim and Seniorenheim in the GDR and Federal Republic respectively. Stevenson also indicates that the collision of two such diverse states in 1989-1990 brought immediate changes not only in politics, economy, and culture, but also into the language. For example, some ‘old’ (mostly eastern) words were removed from active usage; some ‘old’ (western) words (which also included anglicisms) were introduced to East German speakers. Words in use before both states were separated and treated as archaic in the GDR were re-introduced to East German speakers. Some taboo words and topics returned to official usage. Although most of these processes were automatic, not all of them were well received in the GDR or in the Federal Republic. East Germans were the ones, who had to undergo the biggest transformations. This whole process also boosted the question of correct spelling, punctuation, stylistic questions and so forth. All of these problems contributed to the Rechtschreibungreform ‘spelling reform’ and finally, 15 years after reunification of Germany, both former East and West Germans were united; not only politically, socially and culturally, but also linguistically. Other linguistic changes, which influenced the German language despite the previous division of Germany, took place after the reunification as well. Some of them began during the period after World War II and still continue to this day. For example the truncation of polysyllabic words in German. In most cases this creates bisyllabic abbreviations in which the first syllable varies meaning while the second functions as a derivative element, indicating an emotional or genderspecific characterization. Der Ostdeutsche ‚East German’ mutates into Ossi, Der Westdeutsche ‚West German’ into Wessi, Der Bundesbürger into Bundi. The use of these abbreviations is widespread and they are even to be found in the columns of serious newspapers. Ossi and Wessi appear in the 1991 Duden dictionary. Other words follow the same pattern and include Ziggi for Zigarette ‘cigarette’ and can even extend to proper names, such as the once popular Gorbi for Gorbachov. Bisyllabic words can also be abbreviated in this fashion: Putzi for Putzfrau ‘cleaning lady’ or Touri for Tourist ‘tourist’. However the –i has no positive emotions in\n\nxvi\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nsuch abbreviations. Other examples include Ami for Amerikaner ‘an American’ or Nazi for Nazionalsozialist ‘national socialist’.\n\nContributions It was out of this propensity for bi-syllabic abbreviations that the title of our conference and ultimately this collection derived its somewhat controversial title. By juxtaposing the Ossi and the Wessi we feel the title represents not only the post-Wall reality of the language, but also highlights the fact that issues of reunification are still felt strongly on both sides of the former divide. As the essays were selected for this volume it became clear that the topics to be covered would also not easily allow themselves to be placed into neat categories. As a result we have decided to allow the papers to flow into and between each other in a way that ultimately creates a chronicle of the Fall of the Wall that delves into art, literature, film, politics, linguistics and even education. The collection begins with an essay that explores the trope of marriage and marital breakdown through Monika Maron’s Animal Triste (1996) with special attention to the metaphor of marriage both political and literary. Alison Lewis’s reading of Animal Triste suggests that “...a marriage of such extreme opposites [would] make any lasting union an improbable, almost grotesque feat.” Commenting here on the literary marriage, her interpretation suggests that marital breakdown is used in the post-wall period as literary trope to comment on the possibilities of the future of a united Germany. Looking not to the future of Germany, but to the past of the GDR, John Griffith Urang demonstrates “the place of State Security in the collective imagination of the former GDR” through a discussion of Thomas Brussig’s Helden Wie Wir (1995). Urang argues that Brussig’s novel, which presents itself as one sexually deviant’s account of his work in the Stasi in it’s latter years, juxtaposes state surveillance with a gaze of sexual desire thus creating a retrospective revision of Stasi fantasies in postunification Germany. Philip Broadbent’s essay, “Literature and Reunificaiton: Berlin” discusses Günter Grass’s Ein weites Feld (1997) and Tanja Dücker’s Spielzone (1999) while arguing “that their portrayals of [Berlin] knowingly contribute to the revisionist debates that sought to redefine the memory of National Socialism in and for a reunified Germany.” The characters in these two novels, argues Broadbent, wander Berlin not in a topographic nature, but have moved beyond its topography, creating an epistemological shift allowing the city to be seen through time and space.\n\nOSSI WESSI\n\nxvii\n\nGrass and Dücker raise the specter of National Socialism emphasizing Berlin as a city containing multiple sites that remind its citizens of their membership in a wider cultural and social framework. In Chapter four, Jennifer Bierich-Shahbazi takes up the media’s reception of recent novels by East German authors, in particular Jana Henzel’s Zonenkinder (2002) and Claudia Rusch’s Meine freie deutsche Jugend (2003). Bierich-Shahbazi, through analysis of the “Zonenkinder Debate” concludes that “the criticisms say more about the critics’ expectations of how East Germany should be reconstructed, a reinforcement of the negative images of the GDR, rather than their opinions about the novel. The hegemony of one country over another, such as West Germany over the former East, commonly leads to a critical interpretation of the subjugated government.” Moving away from literature into the media and finally into the fine arts, Beret Norman uses Brecht’s Verfremdungseffekt as a starting point for teasing out the effects of Neo Rauch’s disorienting use of space and scale. Through his paintings and his color palette, Norman argues, Rauch offers the viewer a nostalgic (Ostalgic?) view of the GDR. She further argues that his use of a “faux Socialist Realism” is both ironic and disorienting, leaving the viewer unsure of the aim of the painting. Is the canvas in praise of or critical of the GDR? In “Screening the “old” West Germany? The Federal Republic of Germany from Foundation to Unification in Sönke Wortmann’s Das Wunder von Bern (2003) and Leander Haussmann’s Herr Lehmann (2003)” Andrew Plowman offers an interpretation of the two films by way of understanding the representation of the West German past in Germany today. Through Das Wunder von Bern and Herr Lehmann one sees “just how powerfully the history of the Federal Republic before 1990 is being reshaped according to the demands of the new normality of the so-called ‘Berlin Republic.’” He further argues that the films also present a construct that should remind the viewer that these presentations of the West German past are open to be challenged and contested. Similar to Plowman’s work on West German film, Susan Buzzelli then offers a discussion of the two “East German” films, Nikolaikirche (1995) and die Architekten (1990), proposing that recent trends in scholarship tend toward interpretations of late DEFA films as feeding into a notion that the fall of the wall was inevitable. She shows that the dis/connections between these films’ allow for alternate readings of East German films. Chapter Eight moves away from film and the arts into the realm of linguistics. Keith Kennetz analyzes the present day status of Saxon German in “Sächsisch als Verlierersprache?” Through interviews\n\nxviii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nconducted with Germans Kennetz describes and analyzes the perceived linguistic “wall in the mind” that continues to exist. Interestingly, he found in his limited sampling of respondents that although Saxons are aware of the status of their accent as being refined, they themselves deem it as pleasant but uneducated, unrefined and incorrect. Anja Vogel presents research conducted in Berlin high school history classrooms conducted in both former East and former West Berlin. Through her analysis of classroom interactions, she finds and demonstrates the “Negotiation of German Identity” in present-day Berlin classrooms. In fact, her work points to an already disappearing wall among students who are too young to have experienced the fall of the Wall themselves. If the Wall and its conception are disappearing in the minds of the next generation, then Alexis Spry’s project, which details potential methods for presenting the GDR in American classrooms goes a long way toward keeping the memory of a divided Germany alive. By using Realia, she suggests, educators can engender interest in the minds of students now 20 years removed the history that was the GDR and the FRG. Next Rolf Goebel and Marion Gerlind discuss issues often left out of discussions about reunification: homosexuality and feminist equality. First, Rolf Goebel’s “Ossi-Wessi Queer” discusses notions of Queer identity presented in through Napoleon Seyfarth’s autobiography Schweine müssen nackt sein (1991), Joachim Helfer’s Cohn & König (1998) and Michael Sollorz’ Abel und Joe (1994). Through his analysis of these three works, Goebel demonstrates how “[q]ueering functions as a continuous and open-ended process of strategic transgression, questioning both the implicitly optimistic connotations of talk about normalization and the simplistically binary rhetoric of the Wessi/Ossi conflict.” Marion Gerlind’s “Unequal Sisters” questions this same rhetoric, while discussing the women’s rights movement before and after the fall of the Wall. Through discussion of interviews and media sources Gerlind demonstrates the hopes held by those in the women’s rights movement as the Wall fell. In the end their hopes of equality post 1989 turn out to have been unrealized as, in fact, the status of the women in East Germany, could be argued to have lost ground in the struggle for equality. Finally, the volume moves toward a more political discussion of the Wende. Nadine Zimmerli provides an interesting analysis of the appropriation of the June 17, 1953 uprising in service of German national identity during its 50th anniversary in 2003. She notes that the uprising was virtually ignored in 1993, when hopes were still high that reunification would work smoothly and that Germany would quickly regain its earlier\n\nOSSI WESSI\n\nxix\n\nglory. Although the appropriation of the uprising could be problematic, Zimmerli argues that, if done properly, observations of this anniversary could be an important step toward unifying the “hearts and minds” of the Germans. The concluding essay by Nitzan Shoshan takes an anthropological approach to discussing Right Extremists in contemporary East Germany. Through his lengthy discussion Shoshan details the rise of the Right Extremists, and most importantly, the difficulties that would be caused by silencing their controversial, if essential, voice. Ossi Wessi through its broad spectrum of essays seeks not to detail the state of the German nation, or to declare a problem begun or a problem solved. We hope that by discussing as many aspects of the culture as we could that a picture would evolve, and we feel we have accomplished this goal. Each essay stands alone as a contribution to current work in the field, while together the ideas blend from one to another demonstrating the continued complexity of the German nation, and the difficulties it has faced during this, its first 20 years since reunification.\n\nWorks Cited Anderson, Benedict.

The scenarios varied from a couple holding hands and a hopeful courtship, to a couple sleeping in a marital bed, a shot-gun wedding, a marriage and the image of unification as an uninterrupted sexual union. Invariably, the romance was between a dominant, masculine West Germany and a weak or weaker, femininized East Germany.1 This metaphorization of unification, which continued throughout the decade, invokes a supposedly natural gender hierarchy in a meta-narrative of romance that puts gender at the forefront of the project of unifying the nation.2 Willy Brandt’s now famous prediction that what belongs together will grow together likewise draws on an organic, seemingly natural order of things to lend legitimacy to the politics of German unity. A corollary to the meta-narrative of unification as heterosexual marriage can be found in a number of literary works in the first decade after unification that focus on romances, intimate relationships, families, love affairs, and marriages. This chapter explores the trope of marriage and marital breakdown through the example of one post-unification novel, Monika Maron’s Animal Triste (1996)3. Of particular interest here is the way in which the metaphorical “political marriage” of the two Germanys is mapped onto the “literary marriage.” 1\n\nMorrison, “The Feminization of the German Democratic Republic in Political Cartoons, 35-51. 2 See esp.

Do we see Brandt’s faith in the unification process reproduced in people’s private lives? Do literary accounts of unification affirm or refute the meta-narrative of unification as a romance and a happy marriage? Or do they suggest, instead, that the political union was from the start a difficult marriage between East and West that consisted of a grotesquely unequal union between an ill-matched coupleʊmuch less a marriage “made in heaven” than an ill-fated marriage “until death us do part?” In a number of post-unification novels, the surge in individualization that unification precipitated finds expression in the profound effects that the changes had on characters’ private lives, most prominently on intimate relationships and marriages. It is striking just how many East German couples break up or drift apart because of the stresses and strains of economic restructuring and job losses, which effectively drive a wedge between previously happily married couples. In Jens Sparschuh’s Der Zimmerspringbrunnen (The Room Fountain) (1995), for instance, the narrator’s wife, who has made the transition to capitalism effortlessly, moves out of the marital home in the East, leaving her hapless husband to struggle on alone with the brave new world of marketing and comsumer capitalism. In Brigitte Burmeister’s Unter dem Namen Norma (Under the Name of Norma) (1994) too, it is the demand for a more mobile and flexible work force, as well as the promise of a new beginning in the West, that causes husband and wife to part ways, with the husband going West and the wife staying behind in the East. But it is not just the demand for greater mobility in the workplace that drives this couple apart; the husband’s move West is symbolic of a far deeper ideological gulf emerging between the two, who now find that they disagree violently on virtually every aspect of the unification process. Infidelity and betrayal, especially betrayal with a West German, are also at the root of marital breakdown among East German couples, as can be seen in a short story by Bernhard Schlink. In the story “Der Seitensprung” (“The Affair”) in the collection of stories Liebesfluchten (Flights of Love) Schlink plays off two different types of betrayal against each other: on the one hand the betrayal of secrets by Stasi informers and, on the other hand, sexual betrayal of a husband by his wife. When the wife of a Stasi IM discovers her husband was an informant, she retaliates with her own form of betrayal, and has an affair with her husband’s best friend from the West. In Reinhard Jirgl’s Die atlantische Mauer (The Atlantic Wall) (2000) the sexual betrayal is of\n\nOSSI WESSI\n\n3\n\na different kind. Here the narrator’s parents’ marriage is destroyed when the mother leaves her husband for a West German lesbian lover. The most sustained and nuanced exploration of the theme of marital breakdown, love and infidelity in the wake of German unification can be found in Monika Maron’s critically acclaimed novel Animal Triste published in 1996. In this tale of obsessive, unconditional love between an East German paleontologist and a hymenopterologist, or researcher of insects, from Ulm there are no less than seven married or de facto couples mentioned, whose marriages are adversely affected by the “Wende” (“change”/”turning point”) or what the narrator prefers to refer to obliquely as “das Jahr der Freiheit” (AT 88) (“the year of liberation” (ATE 46)), or the year when the “seltsame Zeit” (AT 30, 45) (“peculiar time” (ATE 21)), “die Freiheitsbande” (AT 45) (“gang of liberationists” (ATE 21)) and the “Bandenherrschaft” (AT 86) (“gangster regime” (ATE 41)), came to an end. On the one hand the fairly brief anecdotes about these marriages provide a rare sense of social and historical context for the central narrative about the love affair between the nameless female narrator and her lover, whom she calls Franz. The narrative, which consists of recovered and possibly invented fragments of memory of the affair, interspersed with anecdotes from the past, has otherwise very few concrete references to the narrated time of the early nineteen-nineties, although the love affair obviously takes place in Berlin in the summer of 1990. The narrative present is set in the future, in an improbable and unspecified time in our future, some 40 or 50 years after the love affair ended, and hence after reunification. The stories of the narrator’s friends’ marriages may therefore be intended to give a sense of social and historical context to a narrative that otherwise, due to the timeless quality of the love affair sequences, appears to quite deliberately make sparing use of concrete historical references or signposts.4 On the other hand, as will be argued here, these stories serve an important function at the level of metafiction, appearing as an extended metafictional metaphor or conceit about the gloomy future of German unification. Maron’s narrator tells us that, unlike most of her friends, she welcomed German unification enthusiastically as a miraculous liberation from the repressive old order, which was dominated by “die Willkür des Absurden” (AT 32) (“arbitrary absurdities” (ATE 14)). As the name indicates, the “year of liberation” opened up for her a whole new world of 4\n\nFor a perceptive discussion of the relevance of the lack of referentiality in relation to the central topic of memory see Andrea Geier, “Paradoxien des Erinnerns: Biographisches Erzählen in Animal Triste,” in Monika Maron in Perspective, 103.\n\n4\n\n“A DIFFICULT MARRIAGE”\n\nopportunities and possibilities. Above all, it liberated years of repressed desires and pent-up longings, which she now channels into one end: the desire to live the rest of her life as a love story, “als eine nicht endende, ununterbrochene Liebesgeschichte” (AT 13).5 For the narrator, no break is radical enough, no upheaval cataclysmic enough to quench her thirst for change. While others sought refuge in the old and familiar, she unashamedly embraced the new. She cannot, for instance, understand her married friends, who instead of looking outward, turned back to one another for support: Ehepaare, von denen ich geglaubt hatte, daȕ sie kaum mehr Worte wechselten, als der Alltag ihnen abverlangte, hielten sich plötzlich bei den Händen, wenn sie die Neuheiten der Stadt besichtigten; in ihren Blicken füreinander lag statt dumpfen Spotts, wie noch ein Jahr zuvor, dankbare Verschworenheit, Scheidungen, die schon eingereicht waren, wurden massenhaft zurückgenommen. Jeder griff blind neben sich und hielt fest, was er bis dahin sein eigen genannt hatte, auch das längst Verworfene, von dem man schlieȕlich nicht wissen konnte, ob es sich unter den neuen Verhältnissen nicht doch als nicht unnützt erweisen würde. (AT 90)6\n\nOne example of couples reforming can be seen in the exceptional East German couple, Karin and Klausʊthe couple the narrator knew from childhoodʊwho epitomized the young love the narrator claims she never had. Idealized and envied by her for achieving the seemingly impossible feat of attaining true and lasting happiness in love, Karin and Klaus had, however, become estranged by the time the Wall has fallen. Klaus had been smitten by a younger woman and was seeking a divorce. This only goes to prove to the narrator that Karin and Klaus were in fact not the perfect couple, not the “Liebespaar auf Leben und Tod” (AT 93)7 everyone had thought them to be, but simply just another normal, fallible couple: “ein Ehepaar fürs Leben” (AT 93), as she had secretly suspected\n\n5\n\n“as a never-ending, unbroken love story” (ATE 3) “Married couples who, I had believed, barely spoke to each other beyond what their daily routine required, suddenly were seen hand in hand, sightseeing the new developments around town. The numb distain they had for each other the year before had been replaced by a flash of grateful complicity in their eyes. Divorce papers already filed were withdrawn in large numbers. Everybody groped blindly for what was near and held on to even long-discarded possessions. One could never tell, after all, what might prove still useful under the new circumstances.” (ATE 47) 7 “lovers in life and death” (ATE 48) 6\n\nOSSI WESSI\n\n5\n\nall along.8 It is therefore one of the ironies of history that just as Klaus and Karin were about to succumb to the “normal chaos of love” in evidence everywhere else in the modern world, even in the East, history intervened to save them.9 Needless to say, Karin and Klaus are last seen after the Wall has fallen, standing hand in hand in front of a shop window on the Ku’damm. The upheavals of the times had revived their marriage and reinvigorated their relationship, if not with new eroticism, then at least with a new sense of companionship. Rather ironically then, the effect of the intrusion of the political marriage of East and West into the literary marriage appears to be, in the short term at least, stronger and reinvigorated marriages between easterners. It would indeed seem as if the political marriage between East and West serves, in the first instance at least, as a centripetal force driving easterners back together again. Unification acts in many ways as a temporary panacea to individuals’ personal problems, to the point of overcoming alienation and reimbuing tired emotional bonds with fresh meaning and purpose. The East-East marriage provides something like the “haven in a heartless world” that Christopher Lasch speaks about in relation to the family in the western world in the seventies, a welcome haven from the challenges and uncertainties of social and political change.10 Conceivably, marriage between easterners also serves, in the words of Ulrich Beck and Elisabeth Beck-Gernsheim, as an “anchor of inner identity,” possibly even an anchor of East German identity, in the face of the weakening of socialist bonds and the intrusion of the belated effects of modernization and individualization.11 The phenomenon illustrated by Karin and Klaus is one that sociologist Karl Otto Hondrich argues is one of the wide-spread effects of continued individualization in a global world. While many individuals enter into relationships determined by choice rather than tradition, others are forced to reaffirm traditional ties in response to the individualized actions of others.12 In other words, acts of choice often involve limiting the choice of others, and with the choices that people make about love, there are inevitably always wives and husbands that are left behind with very little choice, such as to stay with the children or to maintain the family. In short, the freedom of choice in love and interpersonal relationships—which encompasses the freedom to form relationships as well as to dissolve them 8\n\n“married couple for life” (ATE 49) Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, Das ganz normale Chaos der Liebe. 10 Lasch, A Haven in a Heartless World. 11 Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, Das ganz normale Chaos der Liebe, 70. 12 Hondrich, Liebe in den Zeiten der Weltgesellschaft, 51ff. 9\n\n6\n\n“A DIFFICULT MARRIAGE”\n\nwith partners of personal choice and in living arrangements of one’s own choiceʊalways produces unfreedom and a return to tradition in its wake. Unfreedom, too, as Ate, the narrator’s friend from the East, points out to her in another context, can for some also be a type of choice, a choice that is fuelled by the fear of freedom. The other predominant interpersonal power effect of unification mentioned in the novel is the break-up of East-West marriages. There are three marriages in the novel that disprove the narrator’s theory of unification as miraculously repairing marriages that are teetering on the rocks. These are, quite apart from the narrator’s own marriage, which will be dealt with later, the three East-West relationships of her friends. For these couples unification clearly represents an interpersonal crisis, for the main reason that the search for happiness and self-fulfilment of one partner, or the individualization strategies of one individual, have caused them to seek new partners in love. The political marriage of East and West, it seems, has rather ironically had the effect of weakening East-West interpersonal bonds. It has, it could be argued, caused an imperceptible shift in the semantics of love between East and West Germans and in codes of communication. Above all, it has altered what Niklas Luhmann calls the degree and conditions of “interpersonal interpenetration” between lovers, between alter and ego, or between different personal systems of organization, and this is nowhere more noticeable than in marriages between East and West Germans.13 In all three East-West relationships the end of the “peculiar time” serves as the catalyst for the break-up of the couple. Even the perfect couple, Emile and Sibylle, who are described as “das schönste Ehepaar, das ich im Leben gesehen habe” (AT 44),14 do not survive the collapse of the gang of liberationists. The roofer (“Dachdecker”) Emile, whose vitae bears an uncanny resemblance to the other roofer from the Sauerland who was head of the “liberationist gang,” namely Erich Honecker, falls in love with Sibylle, who runs a ballett boutique, during his permitted daily outings as a pensioner across the Wall to West Berlin. Their plans to move in together are rudely interrupted by the end of the reign of the liberation gang. Sibylle and he drift apart when Emile resumes his old habit of “hanging” around in the “Vorzimmer der Macht” (AT 45) (“antechambers of power” (ATE 21)), only this time he frequents the waiting rooms of one of the new democratically elected parties in the East. Needless to say,\n\n13 14\n\nLuhmann, Liebe als Passion: Zur Codierung von Intimität, 217. “the most beautiful couple I have ever seen in my life” (ATE 20)\n\nOSSI WESSI\n\n7\n\nneither Emile nor his love for Sibylle survive the new world order for long. The relationship between Sibylle and Emile offers a good example of the difficulties of sustaining the degree of interpersonal interpenetration that is necessary after 1990 for love to be reproduced as a communications medium. The alliance between Emile and Sibylle, which was built around their entirely different but somehow complementary experiences of biographical rupture and foresaken dreams in their respective German states, was initially made possible and probable by an historical quirk of fate, namely the fact that East German pensioners like Emile were given special permission to travel to the West. With the removal of this historical condition, and the tearing down of the Wall, the relationship lost its basis in reality and its specific purpose and function. This can be seen in Sibylle’s remark that suddenly she cannot understand Emile’s passion for politics. Loss of understanding signals the breakdown of love as a communications medium, and a specifically East-West communications medium, since understanding forms an essential part of communicating with the other.15 The circumstances that had helped Emile and Sibylle cope with or manage complexity and contingency, particularly politial contingencies, and that had turned an improbability of them ever meeting into an everyday “normal improbability,” and even a likelihood, and made them fall in love, no longer existed. The imagined symmetries in their biographies, which the Wall had possibly brought more sharply into relief, began to count for less once the Wall had fallen. Instead, old asymmetries re-asserted themselves, asymmetries which were partly due to the distinct nature of their respective eastern and western biographies. Ironically, it is passion of a different sort that comes between them, namely Emile’s incomprehensible passion for the “antechambers of power.” The previous areas of commonality between them, such as a shared belief in “nicht mehr erwartetes Glück” (AT 45) in love late in life, along with the idea of a second chance in love, fade into insignificance in the face of the fatal attraction of politics.16 Even the shared bodily experience of rupture— Emile’s broken breast bone from a heart operation and Sibylle’s broken leg as a child which prevented her from becoming a ballerinaʊwhich mirror the breaks into their respective biographiesʊcannot provide enough commonality, and interpersonal interpenetration, to sustain their love after the historical “rupture” of the end of the freedom gang. Emile has no need for a mistress or lover like Sibylle to share his retirement 15 16\n\nLuhmann, Soziale Systeme, 198. “happiness that neither had thought possible” (ATE 21)\n\n8\n\n“A DIFFICULT MARRIAGE”\n\nwith, and he seeks instead a wife or companion to organise his life, linking up with an old East German friend. The effect is a curious East-West doubling of women in Emile’s life, which emerges only at his funeral: Er besann sich auf eine ehemalige Freudin, die ihn betreut hatte, als er todkrank war, und die nun während der schlaflosen Wochen des Wahlkampfes und der ersten Zeit nach der Amtsübernahme die Organisation seine physischen Lebens übernahm: Sie wusch Emiles Hemden, kochte ihm auch nachts noch eine Suppe und rief den Arzt, als er starb. So kam es, dass an Emiles offenem Grab zwei Witwen standen: die erstarrte Sibylle mit einem groȕen Strauȕ roter Rosen und die ehemalige Freundin, von den Rednern angesprochen “als liebe Frau Wagner,” während Sibylle unerwähnt blieb, mit einem Strauȕ weiȕer Rosen. (AT 48)17\n\nThere are two further East-West relationships mentioned in the novel that predate unification: the relationship between Ate and Ali and the marriage of Rainer and Anke. Curiously both of them suffer the same fate as the affair between Emile and Sibylle. Neither outlasts the reign of the repressive “liberation gang”; or rather, neither survives the transition to freedom. The political marriage between East and West has rather paradoxically dissolved all the existing East-West marriages in the novel. The reasons for this also have to do with the conditional, provisional nature of the relationships, which were dependent on the extraordinary historical and political circumstances of pre-unification times. The liaison between Ali and Ate was the product of geo-politics and West Berlin’s peculiar status as a hermetically sealed political “foreign body” or island within the GDR. Ali, who was dodging childcare payments in West Berlin, chose to live with Ate in the GDR rather than face charges in the West: Da im Stadtbezirk Charlottenburg gerade wieder ein Verfahren wegen nicht gezahlter Alimente gegen ihn anhängig war, beschloȕ er, lieber bei\n\n17\n\n“He remembered a former girlfriend who had taken care of him when he was in death’s throes before, and who assumed responsibility for the everyday practical organization of his life during the sleepless weeks of the election campaign and immediately after the mayor took office. She washed Emile’s shirts, cooked soup for him even at night, and called the doctor when he was dying. Thus it came about that two widows stood at Emile’s open grave: Sybille, numb and with a huge bouquet of red roses in her hands, and the former girlfriend, whom the speakers addressed as “dear Mrs. Wagner” while Sybille was left unmentioned.” (ATE 23)\n\nOSSI WESSI\n\n9\n\nAte hinter der Mauer zu blieben, als wieder einmal hinter den Gefängnismauern von Moabit (AT 134).18\n\nThe unique set of political and legal circumstances created its own range of choices in matters of the heart, its own form of “Selektionszwang” (“selection compulsion”) or the need to make meaningful selections in the face of overpowering choice.19 Ali had a choice between a life with prison walls but without love/Ate and a life with political walls with love/Ate. His decision to stay in the GDR with Ate was moreover most likely helped by a belief in the timeless power of love to transcend such hardships as living behind national walls. Love thus becomes a human effect of geopolitics. The East-West couple, Rainer and Anke, were also brought together by dint of historical and political circumstance. Anke had helped Rainer defect to the West, paying an organisation that smuggles defectors out of the East from an inheritance. The couple remained married in the West for fifteen years. It was only with the fall of the Wall that Rainer realises that Anke’s act of rescuing him had provided the primary and sole condition for their staying together. He realizes that he loved Anke above all “wegen ihres Rettungspotentials” (AT 169).20 Once he had admitted that there was possibly a correlation between “das Maȕ der Verliebtheit” and “die wenn zunächst nur vage Aussicht auf eine Flucht” (AT 169) there was no further rationale for their staying together.21 Before the Wall had fallen, for Rainer freedom was dependent on a West German woman, and the price he payed for his liberation was gratitude, love and faithfulness to his rescuer. After the Wall had fallen love, which had been a “political technology” of survival, now required new techniques for altogether different times. The only exemplar of an East-West relationship forming after unification in the novel is the central affair between Franz and the narrator. Although the relationship between Emile and Sibylle prefigures in some ways the affair between Franz and the narrator, the main affair of the 18 “Since new proceedings for failure to pay alimony were just in the works against him at the municipal court in Charlottenburg, he decided he’d rather stay with Ata behind the wall than face the prison walls of Moabit again.” (ATE 73) 19 According to Luhmann, the complexity of social systems can only be mastered via selection, that is, via the compulsion to make a selection, and hence reduce complexity. He describes this “Selektionszwang” however in terms of freedom. See Luhmann, Soziale Systeme, 291. 20 “because of her rescuing potential” (ATE 93) 21 “the degree of his falling in love” “the prospect of being able to flee, even if vague at first” (ATE 93)\n\n10\n\n“A DIFFICULT MARRIAGE”\n\nnovel is unparalleled in the time after unification. The narrator’s previous marriage to an easterner is similarly without comparison. Rather curiously, the narrator’s marriage is the only exception to the rule established by the East German couples who rediscover companionship in the course of the transition to the new order. At the time of meeting Franz, the narrator tells us she had been married for twenty years and had a daughter. However, the narrator never discloses the real circumstances surrounding the end of her East German marriage, which simply seems to dissolve into thin air. Moreover, what makes the end of the narrator’s marriage even more puzzling is the fact that there is no mention made of external social factors (such as unemployment) or of psychological or emotional reasons for separating (such as loss of passion or betrayal). We are told initially that her husband must have simply disappeared out of her life: “mein Ehemann muȕ … unauffällig aus meinem Leben verschwunden sein” (AT 20), and later that the narrator most probably left him.22 In fact, the narrator surprises us when she assures the reader that her husband was, as far as she can remember, “ein sympathischer und friedlicher Mensch” (AT 20).23 We are led to believe that the reasons for the failure of her marriage have to do with choice and the discovery of the value of love, although the moment of first contact under the brachiosaurus is described, ironically, as a moment of divine intervention or fate, and as a random, unforeseen event: “Franz traf ich ein Jahr danach. Ich habe ihn nicht gesucht, und ich habe ihn nicht erwartet” (AT 23-24).24 And yet the meeting with Franz appears to be far from a random event. For instance, we learn that the Natural History Museum, where the narrator works, is in the process of being taken over, and that Franz is overseeing the transition. Of course what had altered were the political, economic and social co-ordinates underpinning the relationship, the possibilities and contingencies, which the code of love in both Germanys is designed to control and manage, had changed, and inevitably too, the coding or semantics of love had shifted. Since the rules governing marriage, like the rules of love, are a response to the problem of contingency, if contingencies alter, then so too must the code and, logically, also human actions and feelings. Love is, as Luhmann claims in Liebe als Passion (Love as Passion), first and foremost a communications medium and not a feeling. It functions according to a code that creates more or less invisible rules for forming, expressing and 22 “My husband must have discretely vanished from my life after I met Franz” (ATE 7) 23 “a personable and quiet man” (ATE 7) 24 “A year later I met Franz. I had not been searching for him, nor had I been waiting for him” (ATE 9)\n\nOSSI WESSI\n\n11\n\nsimulating feelings.25 It is the role of the code to make the improbable probable and possible: “Das Unwahrscheinliche dann doch zu ermöglichen, ist Funktion des Kommuikationsmediums Liebe.”26 What Maron is suggesting is that the fall of the Wall brought with it new possibilities and probabilities for love which involved a shift in its semantics and its rule of conduct. The crucial question in the novel is therefore which particular code will help the narrator in her quest to secure the love of her life: will it be the code that exists in the West, as practiced by Franz and his wife, or some other code? Is it purely the notion of physical love, that is, sex and extra-marital passion, that is dominant in the West, is it the idea of passion within marriage, or is there another secret code that she is yet to discover? The narrator would like us to believe that her marriage fell apart because she discovers, like Emile and Sibylle before her, the absolute power of love late in life. She has, quite simply, discovered “love as passion,” that is, the miracle of physical passion: “Das eigentliche Wunder waren unsere Körper” (AT 108).27 As if given a second chance in life, after a semi-mystical near-death experience, she resolves to give herself over unconditionally and completely to this kind of love according to her new motto: “Man [kann] im Leben nichts versäumen als die Liebe” (AT 29).28 This decision takes place some forty, fifty or sixty years prior to the narrative present (which makes the narrator around eighty to a hundred years old) and coincides with the end of the narrator’s will to live: “als ich beschloȕ, den Episoden meines Lebens keine mehr hinzufügen” (AT 10).29 It is as if the fall of the Wall had liberated passion and longing, not just her old passion for exotic foreign places and obscure objects of desire such as the archaeological findings of the footprints of ancient bird-like dinosaurs in South Hadley, Massachusetts, but for love as well. Rather than pursue this dream of prehistoric animals, which is now in the realm of the possible and contingent, she decides somewhat perversely to focus all her energies and all her desire on Franz. In doing so, Maron’s narrator is seeking to partake in one of the grand narratives and great promises of modernity. The utopian aspect of love is, as Henk Harbers reminds us, one of the defining features of literary modernism: “Sie ist Ausbruch aus einem leblos gewordenen Alltag, 25\n\n“It is the function of the communications medium of love to enable the improbable to occur” (Luhmann, Liebe als Passion, 23). 26 Luhmann, Liebe als Passion, 28. 27 “The real wonder was our bodies” (ATE 58) 28 “The only think one can miss out on in life is love” (ATE 9) 29 “… I made up my mind not to add any more episodes to my life” (ATE 1)\n\n12\n\n“A DIFFICULT MARRIAGE”\n\nAusbruch auch aus der Unfreiheit.”30 From the literary figures of tragic love, Tristan and Isolde, Romeo and Juliet, Anna Karenina, Werther and Kleist’s Penthesilea, that she invokes, it is clear that her ideal of romantic love is not only modern, but that it has an archaic, barbaric and atavistic side. Modern love, when conceived as passion, has the function, according to Luhmann, of expressing the unconditional nature of the affliction, “… dass man etwas erleidet, woran man nicht ändern und wofür man keine Rechenschaft geben kann.”31 Above all, it can tolerate no compromise and is absolute. The ambivalence of love, and its corresponding death wish,32 is suggested by the narrator’s invocation of the older metaphorical tradition of love as sickness and its more modern incarnation of love as virus. She is therefore convinced that love must be a virus but is unsure if it invades the body like a foreign body or whether it lies instead imprisoned in the body awaiting its moment of liberation. In either case its hold is complete and total surrender is the only answer. In the absence of social and psychological reasons for the narrator’s change of heart and her personal “Wende” (“turning point”) we must look elsewhere for answers. One answer lies in the discovery, or invention, of Franz himself as an object of desire. The narrator cannot remember Franz’s real name and calls him for convenience sake Franz, a name whose sound she likes because of its long vowel and because it sounds like “Grab” (“tomb”) or “Sarg” (“coffin”) (AT 18). Apart from its association with death, the name suggests above all presence after absence, as can be seen in the allusion to Freud’s discussion of the “fort/da” (“gone/there”) principle in Jenseits des Lustprinzips (Beyond the Pleasure Principle) (1920). Freud thought that his grandchild’s game of uttering “fort” followed by “da” was a means of reminding him that his absent mother would soon return. The repetition of “da” was a way of comforting the child and shielding it from the potentially damaging effects of loss. Franz, then, is partly a retrospective invention of memory, a fantasy of perpetual presence and redemption that the narrator has created after his disappearance to ward off the devastating effects of losing him. If Franz represents presence, he also embodies life’s seemingly endless possibilities after communism, that is, he stands for freedom and choice but unfreedom and unhappiness as well: “Natürlich habe ich damals, vor 30\n\n“It is an escape from stifling everyday life as well as an escape from unfreedom” (Harbers, “Gefährliche Freiheit. Zu einem Motivkomplex im Werk von Monika Maron,” in Monika Maron in Perspective, 137) 31 “… that one experiences something which one cannot change and for which one can not be held accountable“ (Luhmann, Liebe als Passion, 30) 32 Harbers, “Gefährliche Freiheit,” 137.\n\nOSSI WESSI\n\n13\n\nfünfzig oder sechzig Jahren, geglaubt, all mein Glück und Unglück käme von Franz” (AT 30).33 With the new weight the narrator gives to the pursuit of true love, Franz also becomes the love of her life she now realizes she never had, the first love she envied Klaus and Karin for having. Eventually too this will become a tragic, fictionalized love, the type of love mythologized in classical German literature and in operas. So that her love for Franz appears unique, rather than the chance encounter it most probably was, she rearranges the teleology of her life. The arbitrariness of the past only makes sense if it can be construed in terms of a “waiting for Franz”: Nachträglich scheint es mir, als ergäbe mein ganzes Leben vom Tag meiner Geburt an nur einen Sinn, wenn ich es als ein einziges langes Warten auf Franz verstehe (AT 51).34\n\nShe imagines therefore that she never loved a man before Franz, although she knows that she did love men “aufrichtig und heftig” (AT 38).35 Love is also, as her friend Ate realises, “eine Glaubenssache, eine Art religiöser Wahn” (AT 175) and therefore a type of new religion.36 Indeed, love has become for her, as it is for many under the conditions of postmodernity, a new secular religion, “the fundamentalism of modernity” and “the religion after religion,” as Beck and Beck-Gernsheim argue.37 But religious faith is susceptible to fundamentalism, and so the narrator’s love for Franz becomes a morbid obsession, and the destructive force of Thanatos gradually gains the upper hand over the positive power of Eros. As the narrator realizes, she is striving for an impossible and possibly extinct ideal, and immediately contradicts herself by pronouncing the impossible, namely love, far more possible than commonly thought: Mit der Liebe ist es wie mit den Sauriern, alle Welt ergötzt sich an ihrem Tod: immer diese Wollust am Unmöglichen. Ich glaube einfach nicht, dass die Menschen so unfähig zur Liebe sind, wie sie vorgeben. Sie lassen es sich einreden von unglücklichen Seelen ohne Jugendliebe, die zu früh, als\n\n33 “Of course I believed at the time, fifty of sixty years ago, that all my happiness and unhappiness came from Franz” (ATE 12) 34 “In retrospect it seems to me that my life, from the day I was born, only has meaning if I see it as one long period of waiting for Franz” (ATE 25) 35 “deeply and fervently” (ATE 17) 36 “a matter of blind faith, a kind of religious fanaticism” (ATE 96) 37 Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, Das ganz normale Chaos der Liebe, 21.\n\n14\n\n“A DIFFICULT MARRIAGE” dass sie wissen können wann, sich in Todesangst ihre Liebe aus dem Leib geschrieben haben (AT 59).38\n\nAbove all, Franz holds out the promise of redemption after the shock or trauma of unification. As Andrea Geier remarks, the fiction of absolute love is a “screen memory” to avoid facing the truth about what the narrator has done to Franz and the void left by the collapse of communism: “Die Liebe erweist sich als functional im Hinblick auf die Lebenssituation der Protagonistin”.39 Rather than a substitute for communism,40 Franz becomes the principle by which the narrator deals with complexity in her life world and the overwhelming number of contingencies impinging on her daily life, the fall of the Wall, pending job losses and workplace restructure as well as the incalculable factors of a new social and economic system: Es gab neues Geld, neue Ausweise, neue Behörden, neue Gesetze, neue Uniformen für die Polizei, neue Briefmarken, neue Besitzer …. Straȕen und Städte wurden umbenannt, Denkmäler abgerissen und neue Militärbündnisse geschlossen (AT 89).41\n\nFranz is possibly even a way of dealing with contingency in her marriage. There appears to have been no real necessity for her marriage break up, that is, it could have happened differently, like with Franz and his wife. Franz is, logically then, omnipresent in her life; Franz somehow “oversees” the end of her marriage and is involved—in a benevolent way—in the disappearance of her daughter and husband, just as he is 38\n\n“Love is like the dinosaurs, the whole world is entertained by their death … always nothing but death, always this prurient glee over the impossible. I simply won’t believe that human beings should be as incapable of love as they pretend to be. They let themselves be talked into it by some wretches who had never experienced young love, who, too early in their lives to even know when and in fear of death, has screamed their love out of their body.” (ATE 29) 39 “Love proves to be a function of the life situation of the protagonist” (Geier, “Paradoxien des Erinnerns,” 97ff.) 40 I find there is little evidence to support Geier’s notion that love is a “Substitut des früheren Glaubenssystems,” and that the narrator had anything but a very ambivalent relationship to the ideology of her country and its political technologies of control such as the Wall. See Geier, “Paradoxien des Erinnerns,” 98. 41 “We had new money, new passports, new authorities, new laws, new police uniforms, new postage stamps, new property owners … the names of streets and towns changed, monuments were torn down and new military alliances were formed.” (ATE 76)\n\nOSSI WESSI\n\n15\n\ninvolved in the restructuring of her workplace. She mistakenly sees in him a means of managing the new risks, in love, in work and in everyday life, of making good past lack, such as the lack of travel opportunities, lack of real happiness and true love and the lack of meaning in her life. Franz provides an opening onto a new order of things, not merely life as a negative response to negative contingencies, “als Reflex auf die Herrschaft des Absurden,” a minus that only becomes a plus in combination with another minus (AT 79).42 Franz is also the means by which she hopes to gain access to the hallowed values of the West, to the coveted trappings of good taste and bourgeois culture such as wine and cheese. Franz is, she mistakenly believes, a symbol of pan-German continuity and symmetry, and initially she delights in the fact that their early childhood experiences are so similar. While she clings to tokens of a common past such as the humiliating transgendered contraption of the “Leibchen” the corset-like undershirt that both sexes were made to wear as children, and the shoes made of “Igelit,” an early form of PVC, the few biographical parallels cannot compensate for the massive differences in experiences under their respective regimes. The narrative of a common past is a myth, and the experience of symmetry largely a subjective illusion, a projection or fantasy. It is above all this illusion of symmetry that is most under threat when the narrator announces that he is accompanying his wife on a holiday to Hadrian’s Wall in Scotland. In is only then that the fact that Franz is still married presents itself as a massive hurdle to her master plan to be not only Franz’s mistress but his wife as well. Franz’s announcement that he and his wife are going on holiday constitutes an overwhelming moment of contingency for which she is totally unprepared. The miracle of their love and aging bodies, for which both are thankful, may well be a symbolic expression of the special nature of their love, but, as Luhmann argues, metaphors of love as sickness, madness or as a miracle merely underscore the fact that these forms of love exist beyond normal forms of social control or sociality.43 While the narrator may well have abandoned her previous circle of friends, and her life was washed away “wie ein unverputztes Lehmhaus vom Wolkenbruch” (AT 79), for Franz life goes on much the same as before.44 He does not, it appears, share the narrator’s need for exclusivity in their relationship. Hence, marriage is, for Franz, simply not part of their ‘deal.’ 42\n\n“in reaction to this regime of the absurd” (ATE 41) Luhmann, Liebe als Passion, 31. 44 “like a mud hut in a torrential downpour” (ATE 41) 43\n\n16\n\n“A DIFFICULT MARRIAGE”\n\nFor Franz it does not go without saying that one must necessarily marry one’s lover and abandon willy-nilly a marriage that has been built up over time, as the narrator has abandoned hers. For him marriage is not the logical next step in their affair, or expressed another way, Franz’s code of love does not envisage marriage as the natural expression and fulfilment of sexual passion. Passion can flourish outside marriage and can coexist quite happily as an extra-marital affair alongside marriage. Hence, he sees no contradiction in his decision to go on annual vacation with his wife while leaving his mistress behind. Not only has Franz’s announcement of his holiday revealed fundamental differences in their respective understandings of the meaning of their affair, and hence, uncovered irreconcilable differences in their semantics of love, his actions also represent a contingency for which the narrator has no rational response. His actions rob her of her sense of freedom in the relationship, the freedom that comes, according to Luhmann with the “double contingency” of the semantics of love.45 The points of double contingency, which the code of love is designed to regulate, are those moments, for instance, when either lover is free to say yes or no to an offer, say, of a holiday, of love, or even of marriage. The aspect of double contingency introduces an element of insecurity into all systems which the code must attempt to manage. Hence, Franz’s announcement represents a turning point in the relationship, which forces the narrator to make some decisions of her own. The mention of a wife, who has a greater claim to Franz than herself, and as someone who must be treated with care and consideration because, as Franz says, “Seine Frau sei für ein Unglück nicht trainiert” (AT 205), fundamentally challenges the narrator’s exclusive claim to Franz as well as her own sense of uniqueness and individuality.46 Despite Ate’s warnings that a mistress has in fact the better part of a man, the narrator covets the legitimacy and stability of marriage and the exclusivity it brings. Once the code of love begins to break down, and provides no stable point of connectivity for one of the lovers, misunderstandings become magnified. The narrative shifts gear at this point into a compelling drama of jealousy, rage and revenge. The happy love story is derailed, the time of gratefulness is over, and the asymmetries in the relationship with regard to choice, experience and opportunity start to arouse feelings of suspicion, disappointment and paranoia in the narrator. Distrust is one strategy to deal with the possibility that the other may not act in accordance with 45 46\n\nLuhmann, Liebe als Passion, 35. “His wife was not trained for misfortune” (ATE 114)\n\nOSSI WESSI\n\n17\n\none’s expectations. Distrust occurs when the double contingency of communication becomes too risky, and as a strategy it limits one’s actions and choice but gives greater security than blind trust.47 The narrator’s total distrust of Franz from this point on is a negative function of her complete and utter faith in him previously. As Luhmann argues: Kleine Anzeichen für einen Miȕbrauch des Vertrauens oder auch für bisher übersehene Eigenschaften genügen dann oft, um eine radikale Änderung der Beziehung auszulösen.48\n\nOr, in the words of the narrator, love can transform the lover into someone else: Bis etwas geschieht; Kleines, Belangloses, aber genug, um uns zu erschrecken und uns unsere Schutzlosigkeit erkennen zu lassen. Eine unerklärliche Verspätung, ein ausgebliebener Telefonanruf, ein zufällig gefundenes Bild. Damit beginnt die Zeit der Angst (AT 181).49\n\nZygmunt Bauman has observed that the postmodern search for selffulfillment in love often leaves a “thick precipitate of misery in its wake” that shows no regard for the unhappiness of others.50 This is true not only with regard to Franz and the narrator, it also holds true for their parents’ generation. The East-West couple has an additional legacy from the past which must be reckoned with: the respective debts left by their parents’ unhappiness. This adds a further moment of unpredictability into the relationship with the narrator, which further restricts her freedom of choice. While she may well choose Franz, Franz, burdened down by the sins of his parents, does not feel equally free to pursue his dreams. The split between Franz’s parents’ after the war, when his father left his mother to be with another woman, who was the real love of his life, spread a very thick layer of unhappiness over Franz’s childhood. Because of this Franz is understandably reluctant to repeat what he sees as his father’s mistakes, by leaving his wife for his mistress. It is only at the end that 47\n\nLuhmann, Soziale Systeme, 179-180. “Small signs of an abuse of trust or even of qualities previously overlooked can often be sufficient to trigger off a radical change in the relationship” (Luhmann, Soziale Systeme, 180). 49 “…until something happens, something petty, trivial, but enough to shock us and make us recognize our vulnerability. An inexplicable tardiness, a telephone call not received, a picture found by chance. This is how the time of fear begins” (ATE 100) 50 Bauman, Postmodern Ethics, 107. 48\n\n18\n\n“A DIFFICULT MARRIAGE”\n\nFranz realizes that there is perhaps no debt for him to pay at all and that he is free to follow his heart: Ich dachte immer, ich müsste die Rechnung meines Vaters bezahlen. Wenn er aber gar keine Rechung hinterlassen hat, weil er recht hatte, weil es sein Recht war, sich für Lucie Winkler zu entscheiden … (AT 234).51\n\nThe narrator’s wager on Franz is ultimately doomed to failure, less so due to Franz’s constant battle with the demons from his past, than because of her own destructive urges. Having freed itself from the prison-house of the body, the virus of love seeks revenge for its imprisonment, and leaves a trail of destruction in its wake. Even when Franz seems ready to sacrifice his marriage and move in with the narrator, she refuses to believe that the impossible has come true. Paranoia, distrust and rage have destroyed any faith in her project of living her love as a love story with a happy end. Instead, she embraces another age-old coding of love in the notion of love as a sickness and as a pre-rational, atavistic force. In fact, love reveals itself to be far worse than the virus that demands her total submission; it becomes “der letzte Rest Natur in uns” (AT 175), more in league with the untamed world of primates and dinosaurs than with humanity.52 Ich begriff, daȕ es das Sauerierhafte an mir war, etwas Uraltes, atavistisch Gewaltsames, jede zivilisatorische Norm miȕachtend, und nichts, was Sprache brauchte, konnte recht haben gegen meine Liebe zu Franz (AT 131).53\n\nAs Franz is about to catch a bus to tell his wife he is leaving her, the narrator cannot help herself and half pushes, half pulls him to his death under the bus.\n\n51 “I always believed, said Franz, that I had to pay my father’s debt. But if he didn’t leave an unpaid debt because he was right, because it was his right to decide in favor of Lucie Winkler….” (ATE 130) 52 “the last remnant of nature in us” (ATE 96-97) 53 “I realized only much later that my indomitable feelings for Franz consisted in their saurian nature, or differently: I understood that it was the saurian nature in me that made me love the way I did, something primeval, atavistically violent, something disdainful of all civilizing norms, and nothing requiring language could prevail against my love for Franz” (ATE 71)\n\nOSSI WESSI\n\n19\n\nThe reasons for the destruction of the narrator’s “prehistorical”54 project of turning the affair with Franz into the love of her life, and marrying him, are presented as a complex mixture of chance, psychopathology and the cumulative effect of personal, family and collective history. The utopia of a felicitous, long East-West marriage with Franz cannot overcome the vast asymmetries in experience and socialization between the two lovers nor can it redress the obvious power imbalances of gender and origin that become painfully apparent. As a consequence, love becomes increasingly equated with submission, subordination and humiliation.55 The time in the story after Franz’s trip to Hadrian’s Wall, which functions to erect another wall between them—a “wall in the heads,” or even a “wall in the hearts”—as well as the time of narrating, are dominated by the narrator’s search for solutions and answers. For the most part, Maron’s narrator chases in vain the elusive code of love that will unite her and Franz in love, the code that encapsulates the world of commonality that demonstrates that both have internalized the world of the other. However, the joint experiences of the post-war era are not able to establish a more permanent basis for a shared code of love that can move the relationship beyond the physical and sexual. Nor is the ephemeral code of love—“der unergründliche Code der Liebe” (AT 38)—that was established at the first moment of physical contact under the brachiosaurus, through the touch of a finger, enough to sustain the relationship over time.56 If the mutual code of love, upon which the feeling of love is sustained and reproduced, cannot establish a firmer footing it too seems doomed. As the title of Maron’s novel indicates, reunification was individually and collectively also an occasion for unhappiness and mourning. The title of Animal Triste alludes to the Latin quotation “post coitum omne animal triste est,” sometimes attributed to Galen and Petronius, but possibly going back to classical sources including Aristotle. The “post coitus” that is included in the ellipsis in the title refers on one level to the sadness the narrator feels after each sexual encounter when Franz leaves her for his 54\n\nThere is another sense in which prehistory bears on the narrator’s story and that lies, according to Brigitte Rossbacher, in the narrator’s memories of Franz’, which becomes “a reconstructive paleontological project” similar to her previous work in the Natural History Museum. See Rossbacher, “The Status of State and Subject: Reading Monika Maron from Flugasche to Animal Triste,” in Wendezeiten – Zeitenwende: Positionsbestimmungen zur deutschsprachigen Literatur 1945-1995, 206. 55 Rossbacher, “The Status of State and Subject,” 208. 56 “the unfathomable code of love“ (ATE 17)\n\n20\n\n“A DIFFICULT MARRIAGE”\n\nwife, and the color of grey which dominates descriptions of Franz also marks him as a melancholic.57 The title can in addition be read at the level of the meta-narrative of reunification, and refers more specifically to the time after unification, that is, to the time after the metaphorical “post coitum”, that is, after the political act of unification, in which disappointment and disaffection in the population started to be felt. This disaffection with the outcomes of unification is reflected in the respective fates of the married couples in the novel. While unification appeared momentarily to open up new vistas of passion and love for the East German men and for some of the East German women in the novel, it undoubtedly also left a “thick precipitate of misery” for many other characters. Even though East German marriages were subject to similar sorts of pressures as marriages in the West, and were falling apart before the end of communism, for the most part the advent of German unity only served to exacerbate their instability and impermanence. This applies in particular to the marriages of the East German characters in the novel, irrespective of whether they had managed to marry into a West German relationship or an East German one. Significantly, it is the East German female characters who have suffered most from what appears to be, with the single exception of the female narrator, a predominantly male decision to experiment with new forms of love. It is the women in both the EastWest and East-East relationships who are the losers in love and marriage in the novel. The East German women such as Karin, Ate and Sieglinde, whose husband leaves her for Renate, his childhood sweetheart, who defected to the West, are all the victims of their partner’s desires to try their luck with new partners. The West German women in the novel have fared no better in the marriage stakes; Sibylle is left by Emile for “Frau Wagner,” as is Anke, the West German woman who once rescued Rainer from the East. For none of the other women in the novel does love, or passion, actually come to symbolize freedom of choice in any lasting manner. It is significant that no female character, for instance, seizes unification as a chance to rekindle past passion with a childhood sweetheart or to relive past opportunities lost through defections to the West or the building of the Wall, as do Rainer and Sieglinde’s husband. Only Karin is reunited with her East German husband, regaining what she had lost rather than gaining something new. And as for the narrator, regaining the childhood love she never had, might sound like a promising solution to the years of frustrated longing and lack and appear to offer a neat solution to the problems of complexity and contingency, but it never 57\n\nSee also Geier, “Paradoxien des Erinnerns,” 106ff.\n\nOSSI WESSI\n\n21\n\nmaterializes. Love is destined instead to live in the shadows of the past, and to do heavy-duty compensation work for past disappointments and past unhappiness. Ultimately, none of the female characters in the EastWest marriages are successful in their individualization strategies in love. If love and marriage provided a refuge from the harshness of the Cold War prior to 1990, it was only ever a temporary respite, and for all of the couples who found an escape through marriage with a Westerner, the end of communism meant loss, suffering and unhappiness. For those who did not know they were unhappy before, like the narrator, the upheavals of the times sheeted home to them the fact that they must have been unhappy before, and hence, their marriages must have been imperfect. For those who took up the challenge of personal happiness in love in the new world order, the disappointment and disillusionment are perhaps greatest of all. If we extrapolate from the marriage metaphor, the message of Maron’s novel appears to be that the marriage of East and West Germany is not only a marriage of opposites that is doomed to failure because of the impossibly high and ill-matched expectations of the two partners. It would also appear to be a marriage of such extreme opposites as to make any lasting union an improbable, almost grotesque feat. This is suggested above all by the animal metaphors in the novel, in particular, by the images of the giant dinosaur and the honeypot ants, which in turn invoke the antithetical histories of the two German states. If the marriage of Franz and the narrator is a union between an admirer of the honeypot ant and a lover of dinosaurs, the political marriage between the two will have to reconcile “interests” of vastly diverging proportions. Maron’s narrator is in love with possibly the largest form of life known on the planet, a prehistoric species of animal, unable to survive evolution and now extinct. Franz is in love with one of the smallest forms of life, with the highly evolved species of the honeypot ant. Like the political marriage between the opposing ideological systems of communism and capitalism, the literary marriage between the narrator and Franz must also reconcile incommensurable systems, on the one hand, a much admired and impressive prehistoric life form that proves unwieldy and unworkable, on the other hand, a much maligned but highly organized and structured system of life that has perfected the art of surviving through selective sacrifice of its drones. While the narrator’s individualistic dinosaurs would normally have the weight to crush the entire collective of honeypot ants, her dinosaurs are, like the dream of European communism, already extinct and on the way to being forgotten. Franz’s insects on the other hand could not survive alone but continue to thrive, and evolve, collectively, as a species. In evolutionary terms, the dinosaurs are, by contrast, a\n\n22\n\n“A DIFFICULT MARRIAGE”\n\n“todgeweihte Mutation” (AT 31) (“doomed mutation” (ATE 13)), which cannot provide opportunities for further selection and connection. On this account, German unification is not only a grotesque marriage of opposites, it is a marriage of different temporalities, of different evolutionary stages, of different systems of organisation and of different principles of survival. Hence, despite Brandt’s optimism, it is truly an odd couple that neither really belongs together nor is ever likely to grow together.\n\nWorks Cited Primary Sources Burmeister, Brigitte.

What motivated an IM, an “unofficial employee,” to betray his or her colleagues, friends, family? And more broadly, how did the Stasi achieve such widespread cooperation, such effective social penetration?2 In this paper, I want to approach this question from a slightly different angle. Instead of retracing the steps already taken by sociologists and historians of the MfS3, I will consider what might be called the phantasmagorical dimension of the Stasi, the place of State Security in the collective imagination of the former GDR. To do so, I will look at an unconventional portrayal of the Stasi and its workers: Thomas Brussig's popular 1995 novel Helden wie Wir (Heroes Like Us). In Heroes Like Us, the history of the Ministry for State Security 1\n\nThe GDR, or German Democratic Republic, was the official name of East Germany. 2 For more, see Gisela Karau, Stasiprotokolle: Gespräche mit ehemaligen Mitarbeitern des Ministeriums für Staatssicherheit fer DDR (Frankfurt am Main: Dipa, 1992); Christina Wilkening, Staat im Staate: Auskünfte ehemaliger StasiMitarbeiter (Berlin: Aufbau-Verlag, 1990); Barbara Miller, Narratives of Guilt and Compliance in Unified Germany: Stasi Informers and Their Impact on Society (London, New York: Routledge, 1999); Mary Fulbrook, Anatomy of a Dictatorship: Inside the GDR 1949-1989 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995) 50–51. 3 The MfS was the official abbreviation of the Ministerium für Staatssicherheit (Ministry of State Security), or Stasi.\n\n26\n\nSURVEILLANCE, PERVERSION, AND THE LAST DAYS OF THE GDR\n\nis less a tragedy than a farce; Brussig’s Stasi is ineffective, incompetent, and inconsequential—here, the secret police become Keystone Kops. Heroes Like Us is framed as a monologue: the life story of Klaus Uhltzscht, as told to Mr. Kitzelstein, a reporter for the New York Times. The Times’ readers should be interested in his story, Klaus opines, on account of his key role in the events of November 9th, 1989. “The story of the Wall’s end,” he says, “is the story of my penis.”4 As we will see, this turns out to be true in more ways than one. What I am interested in tracing here (however briefly) is the investment of state security work with a distinct erotic charge—the sexualization, perhaps, of the Stasi. In Heroes Like Us, the juxtaposition of MfS work with various accounts of “deviant” sexuality reveals important aspects of the structural and structuring fantasies of state surveillance. What will emerge in the following analysis is not only an outline of the fantasy-life of the East German surveillancestate, but also an account of the retrospective revision of these fantasies in post-unification Germany. Klaus’s exposure to the erotics of surveillance begins in the stuffy and repressed atmosphere of his parental home. His mother is an uptight hygiene inspector who teaches young Klaus to be afraid of germs, public toilets, and—especially—sex. As one might predict, Klaus becomes obsessed with the latter, a process he outlines meticulously for Mr. Kitzelstein. From the eye-opening disquisitions of his more enlightened peers at summer-camp to his careful study of Siegfried Schnabl’s Sex-Ed standard Mann und Frau Intim, Klaus’s adolescence is a dogged quest to learn more about this mysterious, frightening, thrilling subject. The greater his ignorance, the more obsessive his fascination becomes. For instance: But Mann und Frau Intim afforded no clues to the G spot. Did it, or did it not, exist? Did it exist only in the West? Was the G spot peculiar to Western women? Would the solution of this mystery be rewarded with a Nobel Prize? Other people were always privy to information I knew nothing about (62).\n\nOne of the things Klaus knows nothing about is the Stasi, the headquarters of which is across the street from his childhood home. When Klaus learns that the Stasi had been involved in the dismissal of one of his favorite teachers, he puts the pieces together:\n\n4\n\nThomas Brussig, Heroes Like Us, 5. Subsequent quotations from Brussig’s novel will be cited parenthetically.\n\nOSSI WESSI\n\n27\n\nI suspected duress of some kind, presumably on the Stasi’s part. Such a great big building, and nobody knew what went on there. Everyone spoke of it in whispers. A teacher was fired and no one would tell me why. Ergo, there was something fishy about the Stasi (63).\n\nKlaus makes the Stasi his “secret enemy,” staking out the building and writing down what he sees. When his father finds out about Klaus’s activities, he is extremely upset: “Writing in mental anguish, he told me that if my activities ever came out, he and my mother would be convicted of espionage and sent to prison” (64). And Mr. Uhltzscht should know. He is himself, as Klaus soon finds out, an employee of the Stasi. Later, Klaus will describe his father as every inch the man from the Stasi. He was probably an interrogator—the one who switches on the spotlight and shines it in your eyes, who roams the interview room in his shirtsleeves and expects you to earn your glass of water by confessing all (70).\n\nAs this description attests, Klaus’s father is not a very nice man. He is gruff and indifferent in turn, paranoid, misanthropic, and highly critical of young Klaus. Nonetheless, or perhaps all the more, Klaus looks up to his father with admiration and awe. And when his father suggests that Klaus join the Stasi as well, Klaus jumps at the chance. This career-move, however, does nothing to counter Klaus’s inferiority complex. On the contrary, his association with the Stasi will ultimately be added to his litany of failures—failures that also seem somehow responsible for his association with the Stasi: I had the most repulsive of all surnames, I was the most ill-informed person in the world, an inveterate toilet-blocker and loser of things, and the Last of the Dog-Paddlers. I couldn’t even jerk off, and I’d only got onto a magazine cover for the wrong reasons. Yes, that’s how it was. That’s how I came to join the Stasi (92-3).\n\nNor does Klaus’s new job lessen his sex-obsession. In fact, it offers vast new resources for the exploration of his number one hobby. At training camp, Klaus meets Raymund, a self-styled ladies’ man and chronic masturbator, who leads his fellow cadets on a moonlight cruise to pick up women. After an alcohol-soaked night aboard the Wilhelm Pieck, a young woman named Marina takes Klaus home with her, where he trades his virginity for a case of gonorrhea and a newfound appreciation for the mysteries and delights of the sexual act.\n\n28\n\nSURVEILLANCE, PERVERSION, AND THE LAST DAYS OF THE GDR\n\nEventually, Klaus is assigned to his first post (literally): the “Periodicals Postal Subscription Service” in Berlin, in reality a Stasi front. Klaus is shocked and dismayed to find that his co-workers are neither suave, competent master spies, nor even grim bullies like his father, but rather eccentric, blundering buffoons. ‘Was I really in the genuine, legendary Stasi,’ Klaus asks himself, or in an outfit that only called itself by that name the better to disguise the genuine Stasi, which would one day send for me? The genuine Stasi wouldn’t expect me to memorize periodical subscription regulations or run a disastrous couple of laps. Whatever I was in, it couldn’t be the Stasi, which was omniscient, omnideceptive, and referred to only in whispers. My colleagues were simply men who munched pretzels and exercised once a week (123).\n\nA “clue” dropped by one of his co-workers, “Owl,” gives Klaus an idea of what his task might be when he finally sheds his cover: ‘Well, imagine if, one day, you had a chance to get at the NATO Secretary-General’s microfish.’ Owl broke off. ‘No, that’s a stupid analogy,’ he amended swiftly, and produced another, but it was too late: Owl had let the cat out of the bag. I pricked up my ears. Had he inadvertently divulged some aspect of my real assignment? But what did he mean? What were microfish? Why didn’t I know the word? Was it yet another of the gaps in my knowledge? Were microfish very small fish? So small that one could see them only under a microscope? The microfish of the NATO Secretary-General… Great heavens! Had I been assigned to get hold of them one day? … Were microfish replete with DNA, genetic material from which they proposed to clone a second NATO Secretary-General (141-42)?\n\nHere, a word misspoken by his colleague sends Klaus on an elaborate tangent, as he tries to fill in “yet another of the gaps in [his] knowledge.” What is telling, indeed paradigmatic, about this passage is the way Klaus invests this gap with sexual content: microfish, he concludes, are spermatozoa—and he will eventually be assigned to collect a vial of them from the NATO Secretary-General. Because of his tendency to assume that everything he doesn’t know must be a sexual secret, Klaus’s alwaysinscrutable work assignments become increasingly sexualized—just as his sex-life becomes more and more influenced by his Stasi work. A characteristic example of both occurs when Klaus goes home "
