        "text": "Towering mountains, spectacular white dunes, crystal blue skies, stunning sunsets, and magical moonlit nights—all of these unique features form the amazing landscape at White Sands National Park. Half a million visitors from all over the world enjoy this beautiful place every year. If you watch TV, it is likely that you have seen White Sands! Hollywood has filmed more than 20 major movies here since 1950. Hundreds of commercials, music videos, TV shows, and documentaries have also been filmed here. Researchers from all over the world come here to investigate the unusual animals and geology here.\n\nHistory of Filming\n\nSince the early days of film on the silver screen, national parks have been popular destinations for photographers, videographers, and cinematographers. The rolling bright white sand dunes of White Sands National Park have set the scene for westerns, science fiction, and apocalyptic films. They have also provided a spectacular entourage for still photography of dawn and dusk, as well as for commercials featuring Rolls Royce, the Anheuser-Busch Clydesdales, Energizer Bunny, and Marlboro Man. Well known directors Steven Spielberg, Transformers, and Harold Ramus,Year One; actors Denzel Washington, Book of Eli,and Willem Defoe, White Sands: The Movie; and music performers Boyz II Men, Water Runs Dry, and Sara Evans, I Could Not Ask for More, have all spent time at White Sands capturing the dunes in their creative work.\n\nMotion Pictures\n\nMovie Production Date Production House King Solomon's Mine 1950 MGM Hang 'Em High 1968 United Artists Scandalous John 1970 Disney My Name is Nobody 1973 Titanus Bite the Bullet 1974 Columbus The Man Who Fell to Earth 1975 EMT Convoy 1977 United Artists Raw Courage 1983 RB Productions Wrong is Right 1981 Columbia Young Guns II 1990 Morgan Creek Lucky Luke 1991 Paloma Films White Sands 1991 Morgan Creek New Eden 1993 HBO Tank Girl 1994 MGM Mad Love 1994 Disney Astronaut Farmer 2005 Warner Independent Transformers 2006 Dreamworks, LLC Afterwards 2007 Et Apres, Inc.

The film crew made three trips to the park in 2010 to record the landscape in a variety of seasons. They filmed in the spring to capture the fierce winds that are common from March through May and are a key part of the dune formation story; then, in early summer, to work with researchers and understand the confluence of science and nature that has earned White Sands the nickname, “the Galapagos Islands of North America;” and finally, in late August, to film the summer monsoons to illustrate the critical role of water in this ecosystem.\n\nStaff had one goal for the new orientation film: to share the beauty, wonder, awe, and scientific and cultural significance of the world’s largest gypsum dunefield with visitors. Using a mix of cinematography techniques and time lapse photography, the film guides viewers through the many moods of the dunefield and highlights the profound richness of the both natural and cultural resources of the white sands.\n\nA Land in Motion is played every 30 minutes on the hour and half hour in the park’s visitor center during business hours. The film may also be purchased in the bookstore. If we have achieved our goal, this film will motivate you to get out and explore, understand, and be inspired by your national park."
