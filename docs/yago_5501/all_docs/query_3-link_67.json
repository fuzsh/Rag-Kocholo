        "text": "Jasper County High School Film recently had four student-produced science journalism features published by NOVA, the American popular science television program broadcast on PBS for over 50 years.Â Â\n\nDuring the 2023-24 school year as part of the NOVA Science Studio program, 14 second and third year JCHS Film students investigated the relationship between \"big data\" and its applications and impacts on issues in their local community of Jasper County. They interviewed local experts and stakeholders on food insecurity, zoning laws, business development, and pollution in Jackson Lake.\n\nâThe NOVA Science Studio program really helped me learn more about my community by connecting me with people who I might have not otherwise spoken to, and get a better idea of whatâs happening in my community,â said JCHS Film student Hunter Cleveland.\n\nThe students' videos, each ranging about 4 minutes, are posted on the JCHS Film YouTube channel as well asÂ on the PBS NOVA Science Studio YouTube channel at https://www.youtube.com/@NOVAScienceStudio\n\nPictured are NOVA Director of Education and Outreach Ralph Bouquet, JCHS Film teacher Tyson Harty, Sparrow Cannon, Stephanie Waters, Damion Morgan, Hunter Cleveland, Dillon McNure, Brady Eggleston, Hollie Prentiss, Reese Byrd, Kristyn Hulen, Francisco Lopez, Tyler Pounds, Lyllie Penn, and Laura-Ashley Alegbeleye, NOVA Science Studio Program Manager."
