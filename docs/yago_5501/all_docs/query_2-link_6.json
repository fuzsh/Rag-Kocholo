        "text": "delusional \"ostalgie\" madness. fooling around, this seems to have no need to take totalitarian bullshit in any way serious. 15 years after the wall fell, go get the cash, blokes!\n\nromanticized barracks slop. aunt sally with a soldiers helmet. as if you would let the cheapest comedian of your country write a script for a film centered around concentration camps. fuck this.\n\nAnd the Leander Hau√ümann day went on. We didn't really want to watch this as it came right after Sun Alley without an ad break (or smoke break for us), but we just kinda kept on watching. It's for sure much weirder than Sun Alley. It was still funny, but there were some really dumb and weird moments which I didn't understand or which, well, weren't meant to understand I think.\n\nPart of:\n\n2020 Watches - Film 74\n\nFirst Time Watches 2020 - Film 55\n\n2020 Watches Ranked\n\nSonnenallee meets Full Metal Jacket. In comparison with the former, NVA is a little more satirical, but not enough to make it count as anything subversive. The characters just aren't as refreshing this time around and there's overall less variation in the aspects of East Germany it depicts, so it has to rely mostly on the antics of its main characters. Well, while some of them are fun and the film doesn't drag too much, there's also not much special going on. Neither is the filmmaking particularly creative. It's a fine enough way to waste 90 minutes, but that's about it."
