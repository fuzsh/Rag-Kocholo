        "text": "Much like history textbooks, literature textbooks produce a grand narrative, telling a nation's story via its literature. This article examines the presentation of literature of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in upper level secondary school (Oberstufe) textbooks published in Germany in 2009 and 2010. Twenty years after German unification, literature textbooks are largely divided into two groups in accordance with their handling of literature from the failed socialist state: some focus on ideological criticism of the GDR, and some choose to avoid politics as much as possible. Both options result in a simplistic, even reductionist (grand) narrative of GDR literature. Case studies on Christa Wolf and Günter Grass reveal a consistent, positive portrayal of West German literature and a polarized representation of GDR literature.\n\nThis book is an attempt to trace some of the new developments that are visible in the contemporary German literary landscape. The fall of the Berlin Wall 1989 and the re-unification are generally taken as markers for contemporary German language literature. The turning point is the desire and the courage of some writers to explore themes other than the war and the holocaust. A cultural normalisation is happening but this development is still in its natal stages.\n\nThis article proposes a critical re-reading of a set of East German historical novels which write the GDR's pre-history as proletarian family narratives: Willi Bredel's Verwandte und Bekannte (1941-1953), Hans Marchwitza's Die Kumiaks (1934-1964), and Otto Gotsche's Die Fahne von Kriwoj Rog (1959). The argument revolves around a specific formal inconsistency common to all three novels, namely a chronological break in the otherwise consistent structure of the family narrative. These structural gaps are understood as \"symptomatic\" of a repressed historical experience, the defeat suffered in 1933 by those who called themselves \"Sieger der Geschichte.\" In its exploration of these ruptures, the article investigates the texts' symbolic system of gender, arguing that the novels' particular gender constructs should be understood as a response to this very experience of crisis: whereas the novels' discourse of masculinity constructs the father's/party's/state's position as one of strength, their discourse of femininity tells a story of death and defeat.\n\nWhy did so many citizens of the GDR agree to collaborate with the Stasi? Reading works of literature since German unification in the light of previously unseen files from the archives of the Stasi, After the Stasi uncovers how writers to the present day have explored collaboration as a challenge to the sovereignty of subjectivity. Annie Ring here interweaves close analysis of literary fiction and life-writing by former Stasi spies and victims with documents from the archive, new readings from literary modernism and cultural theories of the self. In its pursuit of the strange power of the Stasi, the book introduces an archetypal character in the writing of German unification: one who is not sovereign over her or his actions, but instead is compelled by an imperative to collaborate – an imperative that persists in new forms in the post-Cold War age. Ring's study identifies a monumental historical shift after 1989, from a collaboration that took place in concert with others, in a manner that could be recorded in the archive, to the more isolated and ultimately less accountable complicities of the capitalist present. While considering this shift in the most recent texts by East German writers, Ring provocatively suggests that their accounts of collaboration under the Stasi, and of the less-than-sovereign subjectivity to which it attests, remain urgent for understanding the complicities to which we continue to consent in the present day."
