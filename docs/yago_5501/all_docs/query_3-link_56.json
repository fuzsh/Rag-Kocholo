        "text": "Window film or window tint, is a self-adhesive polyester film generally made of PET, Polyethylene Teraphthalate, the same polymer used to manufacture water bottles, for example. Most films are applied to the interior surface of a glass window in a home, commercial building, or car with an adhesive, and have a scratch-resistant coating on the outer surface to protect the film. So basically, window film is comprised of three components: the polymer film, coatings with adhesives, and outer protective coating.\n\nMadico® offers many types of window films. Some are tinted with metals, dyes, or pigments to reduce the visible light transmitted through the glass, and block heat coming through from the sun. Others are clear and feature multiple layers of PET to offer protection from shattering glass. There are even decorative window films that can replicate the look of frosted glass or etched patterns.\n\nAll Madico® window films are installed by professional Madico window film dealers. The installation process begins with the dealer thoroughly cleaning your windows to remove even the smallest dirt particles. A piece of film is cut roughly to the size of your window—whether for an automotive installation or a window installation for home or commercial property. The installer then removes a protective release liner and sprays an application solution on the film’s adhesive to activate it. The application solution is also sprayed on the window to which the film will be applied. Then the film is installed on the glass, and the installer squeegees all the application solution out from between the glass and film. The installer will also do some final edge trimming to ensure the film fits perfectly.\n\nYes, in most cases, window film can be very beneficial when used in conjunction with Low E glass.\n\nWhether window film should be used on Low E windows and how much you will benefit depends on three factors:\n\nType of Low E surface.\n\nLocation of Low E surface on the window.\n\nThe desired amount of heat gain reduction, heat loss reduction, or other window film benefits that you are looking for.\n\nThere are two types of Low E surfaces on glass. One is a conductive coating put on glass as it is being made. It gives some heat loss reduction, but does little to reduce heat gain into a building. The second type is a more complex system of multiple layers of metals and conductive coatings deposited on glass after it has been made. This type of Low E glass gives heat reductions of 30% to 50% in addition to reducing heat loss. Obviously, there will be more heat gain reduction using film on the first type of Low E glass. If there is any question about the type you may have, ask your glass company or the window manufacturer to send you the specific information about your glass.\n\nThe location of the Low E surface in your window system is also very important in deciding whether film should be used. If the Low E coating is on the room-side surface of the innermost pane of glass, the use of window film may reduce or eliminate the heat loss reduction of the glass itself. This may be more than offset by the heat gain reduction/heat loss reduction properties of the films to be used. Most Low E window systems, however, consist of double pane windows where the Low E surface faces the air space between the panes. In this case, film can be installed without eliminating the heat loss reduction benefit of the Low E glass. The type of window film you choose for Low E glass depends entirely on your desired benefit—whether you want to reduce heat gain, control glare, prevent heat loss, reduce fading or enhance the safety of your windows and glass doors. Carefully consider all these benefits before making a final decision.\n\nAlong with saving you money on cooling costs in the warm summer months, architectural window film helps retain interior heat to help you reduce heating costs in winter. Year-round, the sun’s ultraviolet rays cause colors to fade, fabrics to fray, and woods to crack. This damage to your furnishings, flooring, and artwork becomes worse over time, and can never be reversed. But it can be significantly reduced with the application of architectural window film.\n\nMadico® films block 99% of harmful UV rays, potentially saving you thousands of dollars in sun damage, while helping to preserve the beauty of your home or office—and your valued possessions—for as long as you own them. Window film by Madico improves the comfort of your space throughout the year, despite the temperature, by making windows more energy efficient—and conserving all that energy benefits the environment, too.\n\nThere are vast differences in the construction properties of automotive and architectural film. Automotive window film is designed to absorb solar energy, which means a car can actually grow warmer inside as the car sits idle. The magic of creating interior comfort happens as the window's absorbed heat radiates as the car drives down the road.\n\nArchitectural window film, of course, is used on stationary structures. If one tried to install automotive window film architecturally, you can imagine how the solar-absorbing auto film would prove detrimental to a home or office environment. It's for this reason that architectural flat glass is designed to reflect heat. In fact, if you were to try putting solar-energy-absorbing auto film onto flat glass, there's a good chance heat buildup would cause the glass to break.\n\nThere are other differences. For example, automotive film is designed to be heat formed during installation, allowing the installer to shape the film as needed around the curvature of a vehicle’s windows. Architectural film uses a different adhesive than automotive film. It is formulated to give an installer more control when positioning film on large glass surfaces.\n\nWhen the sun hits glass that's not protected with window film, a significant amount of the sun's energy—about 90%—is transmitted through the glass. That's where the heat comes from. To counteract that, installing window film on glass will block up to 80% of the sun's energy. That means a whole lot less heat is getting through to you. The exact amount of heat absorption and reflectance of the film will depend on the type of film your professional installer recommends for your specific needs. Dyed films do not have metal and are considered non-reflective, and while they absorb solar energy, they're not as effective at solar control because of their non-reflective property. On the contrary, metalized and nano-ceramic films provide solar absorption and reflectance—and much more solar control—with nano-ceramic film offering the highest levels of solar protection. These films block up to 99% of the sun's harmful UV rays.\n\nWhen the dealer squeegees out the application solution during installation, it is nearly impossible to get every drop of solution out. Thus, there is a drying time (cure time) for the film, during which the remaining application solution between the film and glass evaporates. During this time, our window film is still performing to its full solar control and safety capabilities. However, it is common to see bubbles, haze, streaks, and other visual defects in the film as it cures. This is completely normal, and these will disappear as the film dries out.\n\nThe amount of time for the film to fully cure can vary drastically. If it is a dark solar control film on a south or west-facing window in a hot climate in summer, the film can be completely cured within a few days. However, if it is a heavy gauge safety film installed on a north facing window in wintertime, it’s not uncommon for the curing process to last over a month. Remember, though, that the film will perform as designed during the drying time, the bubbles and streaks are purely cosmetic.\n\nThis depends on the film type, glass type, window construction, orientation, and geographical location of the building.\n\nAll Madico® architectural window films are covered by a warranty for some specified time. Most residential and automotive applications are covered by a lifetime warranty as long as you own the house or car. Most commercial installations receive either a 10- or 15-year warranty. There are some specialty films that have different terms; for example, exterior films are warranted for five years on vertical glass, two years on sloped glass; and decorative films usually have seven-year coverage.\n\nThe warranty coverage is based on extensive internal testing and our years of experience in the field. It is common that we see films that last well beyond their warranties, sometimes as long as 15-20 years.\n\nMadico automotive window films longevity depends on some specific variables as well, like product type and quality, the climate the car has to bear, and the amount of direct sunlight the car is exposed to. The good news is, Madico automotive window films are manufactured using high quality dyes, adhesives, and laminates and are covered by a lifetime warranty for as long as you own the vehicle.\n\nIn most cases if a house plant is already receiving adequate light, the use of window film will not harm it. New growth or flowering may be impacted, as the plant may take a few days to adjust to the light change. If a particular plant normally wilts by the end of a sunny day, it can actually thrive better with film installed. Although there are some obvious guidelines in determining what, if any, effect window film will have on a plant (for instance, dark green plants need less light than lighter colored ones), there is one sample test which can be done prior to film installation — simply move the plant to an area with less sunlight for a few days. In addition, most nurseries or local agriculture agencies can advise you whether a particular plant needs closer to maximum or minimal light."
