        "text": "THOMAS OSTERMEIER'S breathless and pop-infused adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's \"Doll's House,\" which begins a five-performance run at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Harvey Theater on Tuesday, will probably divide New Yorkers along the usual party lines of director's theater. Loosely put, it's snobs versus slobs, the faithful versus the promiscuous, defenders of original text versus defenders of instant engagement and contemporary gleam.\n\nBut before choosing sides on this 2002 production from the Berlin Schaub√ºhne am Lehniner Platz, where Mr. Ostermeier is co-artistic director, Academy-goers might wish to consider the place \"Nora\" (the traditional title of \"A Doll's House\" in German) holds within a remarkable history. Memories are still fresh of Mabou Mines's \"DollHouse\" last fall, directed by Lee Breuer at St. Ann's Warehouse, in which all the male roles were cast with dwarfs. But even in the notorious, lavishly financed, postmodern German theater, in which adaptation and appropriation are the sincerest forms of flattery, \"A Doll's House\" may well have been adapted and altered more than any other modern drama.\n\nThe married couple in Mr. Ostermeier's \"Nora\" (performed in German with English subtitles) are flashily nouveau riche German yuppies who live in a chic, multilevel Bauhaus home with Mies van der Rohe furniture and a giant aquarium. They fuss with cellphones and laptops and have a black au pair who keeps the children out of mama's hair, especially when mama shows symptoms of turning into Medea. Occasionally, they burst into fits of hysteria and aggression punctuated with blasts of electronic music. At the end, instead of walking out with the door slamming behind her, Nora turns the groping and psychological violence she has been subjected to into outward rage and she kills.\n\nThen there was Hans Neuenfels's 1972 \"Doll's House\" in Stuttgart, in which Nora climbed back into the house through a window after her triumphal exit. In Rudolf Noelte's 1976 production in Berlin, Torvald was reduced to a drunken weakling who wasn't worth the trouble of leaving. In 1990 a young and unknown East German named Leander Haussmann became an overnight star with a \"Doll's House\" from Weimar that ended with a comically gymnastic fight between Nora and Torvald, replete with swinging kicks from a chandelier, after which the 19th-century period set revolved to reveal modern homeless people shivering in the cold. In Karin Henkel's 1997 production in Vienna, the couple shut themselves out of the house together at the end, continuing their marital spat beyond the slammed door. And in Stefan Kimmig's 2003 Hamburg production, no less modernized than Mr. Ostermeier's, Nora didn't leave home at all but rather climbed onto her roof balcony to chain-smoke.\n\nFor Mr. Ostermeier, this production continues his careerlong exploration of the shocking. \"When I'm abroad with the production,\" he said in a January interview with FT Magazine in London, \"people are quite upset with the ending. They say: 'Our Nora, as we know her, gets out and is free. Your Nora is not free. She kills and is a victim at the same time as she's a murderer.' This is not to be taken as a recommendation of how to solve your problems! It's just that it was very shocking to society at the end of the 19th century that a woman should leave her husband and children. We can't nowadays have the same moment of shock when two thirds of families split up.\"\n\nShock aside, Mr. Ostermeier is also fascinated with the questions Nora continues to raise about limitations on female empowerment. In Act III, for instance, he has the actress Anne Tismer dress up as Lara Croft of the \"Tomb Raider\" films and video games rather than as the Neapolitan peasant girl that Ibsen imagined. That is an allusion to the way female pop stars in vehicles like \"Tomb Raider,\" \"Charlie's Angels\" and \"Kill Bill\" wield fictional power that women don't truly have.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
