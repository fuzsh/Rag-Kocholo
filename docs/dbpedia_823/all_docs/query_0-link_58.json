In season 3, judges sent 1 or 2 contestants home weekly. Once the field was down to 2 final contestants, the viewers picked the winner. Marc Summers (host of the first 2 seasons) only returned for this season's finale. Bobby Flay would host subsequent season finales.[4]\n\nDuring the season, the contestants lived in a shared house in New York City. The contestants' challenges included cooking concession food for an NBA game (with guest Darryl Dawkins) to a mini version of Food Network's Iron Chef America (with guest judges Bobby Flay and Cat Cora). The Selection Committee consisted of Food Network executives Bob Tuschman and Susie Fogelson along with one guest. Guest judges included Alton Brown, Giada De Laurentiis, Duff Goldman, season two winner Guy Fieri, and Robert Irvine.\n\nPaula Deen and Rachael Ray participated in contestant challenges, and Bobby Flay also played a role in the guidance and selection process. Amy Finley was chosen by America as The Next Food Network Star on July 22, 2007. Her new show The Gourmet Next Door premiered on October 14, 2007 and ran for six episodes. Finley later declined to continue with the series, citing relocation to France for family reasons.[4]\n\nAmong the contestants this season was former child actress Colombe Jacobsen-Derstine, best known for her appearances in the Mighty Ducks film franchise.\n\nContestants\n\n[edit]\n\nName Age Hometown Occupation Eliminated Amy Finley 33 San Diego, CA Stay-at-Home Mom Winner1 Rory Schepisi 31 Vega, TX Restaurateur Runner-Up Joshua Adam \"JAG\" Garcia 25 Havelock, NC Chef-de-Cuisine Withdrew1 Paul McCullough 36 Los Angeles Caterer Week 6 Adrien Sharp 29 Jackson, MI Local Cooking Show Host Week 5 Michael Salmon 53 Brooklyn, NY Director of Operations for Macy's Week 4 Tommy Grella, Jr. 34 Methuen, MA Self-Taught Chef Week 3 Colombe Jacobsen-Derstine 29 New York, NY Former Child Actress Week 3 Nikki Shaw 38 Oakland, CA Caterer Week 2 Patrick Rolfe 33 Seattle, WA Chef Week 1 Vivien Cunha 40 Hermosa Beach, CA Caterer Week 1\n\n^Note 1 : Amy Finley was eliminated Week 7, and the original finalists were Rory Schepisi and Joshua \"JAG\" Garcia. After the final elimination episode was aired, evidence came to light that JAG had lied about both his culinary training and his military service, representing both as more extensive than they actually were.[5][6] Food Network allowed him to withdraw from the competition and reinstated Amy Finley, who was voted The Next Food Network Star.\n\nSeason Four\n\n[edit]\n\nSummary\n\n[edit]\n\nSeason four of The Next Food Network Star premiered on Sunday, June 1, 2008. Food Network executives Bob Tuschman and Susie Fogelson are joined by Bobby Flay as the selection committee for this season. Each new episode aired on Sundays at 10:00 PM EDT. For this season, the viewers no longer received the chance to vote for the winner; producers instead made the final decision. This led to an error by FoodNetwork.com, which briefly posted the winning moment video on their website three days before the finale aired.[7] The winner for the fourth season was Aaron McCargo Jr. His winning show idea, Big Daddy's House, first aired August 3, 2008.[8]\n\nFinalist Adam Gertler was hired to host a Food Network show called Will Work for Food, which debuted on January 19, 2009 and was cancelled after one season.

In 2010, Gertler and Nixon became co-hosts of The Next Food Network Star After Party, a half-hour recap/interview show following that night's episode of Star, on Cooking Channel.
