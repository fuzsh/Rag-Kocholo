Now that I’m two episodes in, I can confidently say that I am *officially* obsessed.\n\nCurrently sitting at the number two spot on Netflix’s top ten shows list, the British thriller series, which is based on a book series written by Holly Jackson, follows 17-year-old Pippa “Pip” Fitz-Amobi (played by Wednesday star Emma Myers) who starts investigating the mysterious disappearance of Andrea Bell for a school project.\n\nFive years prior, Andrea’s boyfriend, Salil Singh, was accused of being behind the crime. Together, Pip and Sal’s brother, Ravi, set out to clear Salil’s name and uncover the identity of the real killer, who is presumably still at large.\n\nAs someone who loves watching crime dramas, I was locked in from the very first episode. This show has it all: an unsolved murder case, a slew of possible suspects and an unidentified killer at the center of it all. So, if you enjoy watching a suspenseful thriller series just as much as I do, then A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder might be right up your alley.\n\nAs I said before, A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder is based on a trilogy book series written by Holly Jackson. Before the series premiered on the streaming platform, the British author sat down with Netflix’s Tudum and shared how “beyond excited” she was for audiences to watch the new show.\n\n“I hope viewers will love discovering (or rediscovering) all the secrets and lies of our small English town — Little Kilton,” she told Tudum. “Viewers can expect laugh-out-loud moments from all the teenage antics, but also all the pulse-pounding twists you’d find in the darkest of thrillers. Heartbreak, tears, gasps, swooning at all the PipRavi moments brought to life, watching behind a cushion, cursing my name…be prepared for it all when A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder hits your screens.”\n\nCOURTESY OF NETFLIX\n\nIf anyone needs me, I’ll be watching A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder. All six episodes are available to watch now on Netflix.\n\nMy New Favorite Drama-Filled Thriller Is on Netflix—and It Has 183 Wild Episodes"
