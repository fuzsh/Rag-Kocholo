        "text": "In an Orwellian twist, the word âOrwellianâ has been misused so much over the decades that itâs essentially lost its meaning. But George Orwell, author of the classicsÂ Animal FarmÂ andÂ 1984, was very clear in his beliefs. While he was progressive and prescient in many ways, he wasnât without his flaws. This week, Sean Illing explores the real George Orwell withÂ Laura Beers, the author ofÂ Orwell's Ghosts: Wisdom and Warnings for the Twenty-First Century.\n\nHost: Sean Illing (@seanilling), host, The Gray Area\n\nGuest: Laura Beers\n\nEnjoyed this episode?

This weekâs guest, Erwin Chemerinsky, argues that many of todayâs threats to democracy are a direct result of compromises made by the Founding Fathers centuries ago. Those mistakes have come back to haunt us, and they might destroy our democracy.\n\nErwin Chemerinskyâs latest book is No Democracy Lasts Forever.\n\nHost: Sean Illing (@seanilling), host, The Gray Area\n\nGuest: Erwin Chemerinsky\n\nEnjoyed this episode?

This week, host Sean Illing talks to philosopherÂ Rebecca Roache, author ofÂ For F*ckâs Sake: Why Swearing Is Shocking, Rude, and FunÂ about the philosophy and linguistics of swearing, and why certain four-letter words hold the magical power to both offend and delight.\n\nWarning: In case itâs not obvious, this episode contains swearing.\n\nHost: Sean Illing (@seanilling), host, The Gray Area\n\nGuest: Rebecca Roache (@rebecca_roache)\n\nEnjoyed this episode?

They discuss how Nietzsche's work has been interpreted â and misinterpreted â since his death in 1900, how his radical political views emerge from his body of work, and how we can use Nietzsche's philosophy in order to interpret some key features of our contemporary politics.\n\nHost: Sean Illing (@seanilling), host, The Gray Area\n\nGuest: Matt McManus.\n\nEnjoyed this episode?

One hotspot of this tension lies in India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi employs autocratic language and tactics to maintain power. But a recent election may indicate that voters are losing interest in this style of rule. Guest host Zack Beauchamp talks with scholar Pratap Bhanu Mehta about the past of the Indian liberal tradition and what the current politics of the worldâs largest democracy say about the state of global politics.Â\n\nHost: Sean Illing (@seanilling), host, The Gray Area\n\nGuest: Pratap Bhanu Mehta\n\nEnjoyed this episode?

Writer John Ganz believes that we can trace the dysfunction to the 1990s, when right-wing populists like Pat Buchanan and white supremacist David Duke transformed Republican politics. He joins Sean to talk about the 1990s and how it laid the groundwork for Trump. His book is When the Clock Broke: Con Men, Conspiracists, and How America Cracked Up in the Early 1990s.\n\nHost: Sean Illing (@seanilling), host, The Gray Area\n\nGuest: John Ganz (@lionel_trolling).
