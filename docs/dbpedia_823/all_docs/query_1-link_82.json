        "text": "[symple_heading style=”” title=”By Ken Stone” type=”h1″ font_size=”” text_align=”left” margin_top=”20″ margin_bottom=”20″ color=”undefined” icon_left=”” icon_right=””]\n\nTrack and field makes a return to “Battle of the Network Stars” when running relays appear in all 10 episodes of the show beginning June 29.\n\nABC’s TV spots show hurdlers, but the only barriers will be found in the obstacle course, according to the network.\n\nABC spokesman Jonathan Hogan said relays were contested at Pepperdine University in Malibu — the same track used in the 1970s show.\n\nThe 400-meter oval hosted a four-person relay — with three members covering less than a single lap and a fourth running an additional lap, about 8 feet short of a quarter-mile.\n\n“A baton must be passed between each leg, and occur within the ‘hand-off zone,’” Hogan said. “The first three legs are not a full lap divided up three ways; it is shorter than that. The runners started in a corner — not at the same place they finished. The preliminary legs are each 120 meters.”\n\nAt the request of MyNewsLA.com, ABC released the times, or splits, of 77 runners from the relays — marks for 120-meter and 400-meter legs.\n\n“We can’t reveal the names of stars/results before episodes air,” Hogan said.\n\nThe fastest 120-meter leg was 17.12 seconds, or roughly 14.3 seconds for a 100-meter dash. The slowest leg was 39.24 seconds, or a 32.7 100-meter dash. (A 100-year-old man ran 100 meters in 26.99.)\n\nThe fastest 400-meter leg was 64.17 seconds and the slowest was 1 minute, 51.74 seconds. (The men’s world record is 43.03 seconds by South Africa’s Wayde van Niekerk at the 2016 Rio Olympics.) The fastest 90-year-old man has run a lap in 1:33.99 and the fastest woman over 85 has gone 1:49.46.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear whether stopwatches were used to record times to the hundredths of a second or an automatic timing system.\n\n“Battle of the Network Stars” features 100 cast members from shows such as “Modern Family,” “Pretty Little Liars” and “Scandal.”\n\nEven older shows provide entrants for the 20 teams, including “Beverly Hills 90210,” “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” “Dallas” and “CHiPs.”\n\nThe original series from ABC Sports began in 1976 and continued for 13 years.\n\nVariety reported that the series was shot in May.\n\n“The original “Battle of the Network Stars” aired on ABC from 1976 to 1985 and featured teams representing ABC, CBS and NBC competing in events such as kayaking, golf, three-on-three football, and tug of war,” Variety said. “The show was hosted for most of its run by Howard Cosell.”\n\nAmong the co-hosts and competitors were Bruce Jenner, O.J. Simpson, David Letterman, Tony Randall, Robin Williams, Dick Van Dyke, Lynn Redgrave, Tom Selleck, William Shatner and Michael J. Fox.\n\nThe show was revived twice — in 1988 on ABC and in 2003 on NBC, with only NBC stars, Variety noted.\n\nThe 10-­episode summer event will pit teams of current and classic TV stars from multiple eras and genres.\n\nThe first episode features TV Sitcoms vs. TV Kids — with Sitcoms made up of Bronson Pinchot, Tom Arnold, Dave Coulier, A.J. Michalka and Tracey Gold. TV Kids are Joey Lawrence, Corbin Bleu, Nolan Gould, Lisa Whelchel and Kim Fields.\n\nThe other matchups:\n\nTV Sitcoms vs. Cops\n\nSitcoms: Todd Bridges, Leigh-Allyn Baker, Dave Foley, Willie Garson and Jenna von Oy\n\nCops: Erik Estrada, Larry Wilcox, Kelly Hu, Jodi Lyn O’Keefe and Lorenzo Lamas\n\nSci-Fi Fantasy vs. Cops\n\nSci-Fi: Lou Ferrigno, Vinnie Jones, Charisma Carpenter, Kevin Sorbo and Jill Wagner\n\nCops: Marisol Nichols, Roma Maffia, Adrian Zmed, Fred Dryer and Ryan Paevey\n\nTV Moms & Dads Versus TV Kids\n\nMoms & Dads: Chad Lowe, Greg Evigan, Ted McGinley, Lesley Fera and Jackee Harry\n\nKids: Jimmie Walker, Mackenzie Phillips, Jonathan Lipnicki, Krista Marie Yu and Jeremy Miller\n\nFamous TV Families vs. Doctors\n\nFamilies: Danny Bonaduce, Barry Williams, Beverley Mitchell, Willie Aames and Charlene Tilton\n\nDoctors: Thomas Calabro, Taye Diggs, Rachelle Lefevre, Deidre Hall and Benjamin Hollingsworth\n\nTV Lifeguards vs. Troublemakers\n\nLifeguards: David Chokachi, Brande Roderick, Parker Stevenson, Nicole Eggert and Gena Lee Nolin\n\nTroublemakers: Vivica A.
