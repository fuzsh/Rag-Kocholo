        "text": "We The People: Legal Representation\n\nThe Sixth Amendment. Most of us take it for granted that if we're ever in court and we can't afford a lawyer, the court will provide one for us. And in fact, the right to an attorney is written into the Constitution's sixth amendment. But for most of U.S. history, it was more of a nice-to-have — something you got if you could, but that many people went without.\n\nWe The People: Legal Representation\n\nListen · 49:43 49:43\n\nTested: Questions of a Physical Nature\n\nIn 1966, the governing body of the Olympic track and field event started mandatory examinations of all women athletes. These inspections would come to be known as \"nude parades,\" and if you were a woman who refused the test, you couldn't compete.\n\nTested: Questions of a Physical Nature\n\nListen · 35:17 35:17\n\nWe the People: Gun Rights\n\nThe Second Amendment. In April 1938, an Oklahoma bank robber was arrested for carrying an unregistered sawed-off shotgun across state lines. The robber, Jack Miller, put forward a novel defense: that a law banning him from carrying that gun violated his Second Amendment rights. For most of U.S. history, the Second Amendment was one of the sleepier ones. It rarely showed up in court, and was almost never used to challenge laws. Jack Miller's case changed that. And it set off a chain of events that would fundamentally change how U.S. law deals with guns. Today on Throughline's We the People: How the second amendment came out of the shadows. (Originally ran as The Right to Bear Arms)\n\nWe the People: Gun Rights\n\nListen · 48:29 48:29\n\nWe The People: Free Speech\n\nThe First Amendment. Book bans, disinformation, the wild world of the internet. Free speech debates are all around us. What were the Founding Fathers thinking when they created the First Amendment, and how have the words they wrote in the 18th century been stretched and shaped to fit a world they never could have imagined? It's a story that travels through world wars and culture wars. Through the highest courts and the Ku Klux Klan. Today on Throughline's We the People: What exactly is free speech, and how has the answer to that question changed in the history of the U.S.? (Originally ran as The Freedom of Speech)\n\nWe The People: Free Speech\n\nListen · 48:52 48:52\n\nThe Roots of Poverty in America\n\nThe United States is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, yet over 10 percent of people – nearly 40 million – live in poverty. It's something we see, say, if we live near a tent encampment. And it's also something we feel. More than a third of people in the U.S. say they're worried about being able to pay their rent or mortgage. Medical bills and layoffs can change a family's economic status almost overnight.\n\nThe Roots of Poverty in America\n\nListen · 49:53 49:53\n\nRoad to Rickwood: The Holy Grail of Baseball\n\nBirmingham, Alabama was one of the fiercest battlegrounds of the Civil Rights Movement. And in order to understand the struggle, you don't have to look any further than Rickwood Field, the oldest baseball stadium in the country. Over more than a century it's hosted Negro League baseball, a women's suffrage event, a Klan rally — and eventually, the first integrated sports team in Alabama.\n\nRoad to Rickwood: The Holy Grail of Baseball\n\nListen · 57:25 57:25\n\nPop Music's First Black Stars\n\nToday, the U.S. popular music industry is worth billions of dollars. And some of its deepest roots are in blackface minstrelsy and other racist genres. You may not have heard their names, but Black musicians like George Johnson, Ernest Hogan, and Mamie Smith were some of the country's first viral sensations, working within and pushing back against racist systems and tropes. Their work made a lasting imprint on American music — including some of the songs you might have on repeat right now.\n\nPop Music's First Black Stars\n\nListen · 49:29 49:29\n\nThe Lavender Scare (Throwback)\n\nOne day in late April 1958, a young economist named Madeleine Tress was approached by two men in suits at her office at the U.S. Department of Commerce. They took her to a private room, turned on a tape recorder, and demanded she respond to allegations that she was an \"admitted homosexual.\" Two weeks later, she resigned.\n\nThe Lavender Scare (Throwback)\n\nListen · 51:19 51:19\n\nA History of Zionism\n\nSince October 7th, the term Zionism has been everywhere in the news. It's been used to support Israel in what it calls its war against Hamas: a refrain to remind everyone why Israel exists and why it must be protected. Others have used Zionism to describe what they view as Israel's collective punishment of civilians in Gaza, and its appropriation of Palestinian territories — what they often call \"settler colonialism.\"Zionism has been defined and redefined again and again, and the definitions are often built on competing historical interpretations. So unsurprisingly, we've received many requests from you, our audience, to explore the origins of Zionism. On today's episode, we go back to the late 19th century to meet the people who organized the modern Zionist movement.\n\nA History of Zionism\n\nListen · 51:35 51:35"
