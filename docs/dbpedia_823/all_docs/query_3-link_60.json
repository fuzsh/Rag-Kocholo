        "text": "Roll out the red carpet, as the who’s who of music, comedy, drama, sport and show business are here for their cooking close-up in a bid to become Celebrity MasterChef champion 2024 as the ever-popular series returns to BBC One. The next six weeks will see 20 famous faces throw themselves into the biggest culinary challenge of their lives. MasterChef judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace will be putting their own taste buds through a sensory assault course as they discover which celebrities have the palate and skill to chop, slice and sizzle their way to lifting the iconic trophy.\n\nExpect the unexpected as Celebrity MasterChef fires up the stoves once more for the first of four weeks of heats. Some of the UK’s brightest celebrity talents are in the wings ready to take on the challenge, but only the most fearless will cope with the demands of the competition. The race for the title kicks off in style, and those who bring their A-list game across the week will win a place in this heat’s quarter-final.\n\nThe first five celebrities donning gleaming MasterChef aprons this week are TV and radio presenter Craig Doyle, reality star and influencer Charlotte Crosby, TV and radio presenter Edith Bowman, pop star Ian ‘H’ Watkins and TV and radio presenter Snoochie Shy.\n\nJohn and Gregg waste no time in setting the first task for the hopefuls – Under the Cloche. Taking it in turns, the celebrities pick a gleaming cloche. Using the hidden ingredient they reveal, it’s then down to them to deliver a dish that gives that ingredient real superstar status. Items include sweetbreads, pigeon and prawns, which would challenge even the most seasoned chefs. With nerves running high and just an hour to create their dish from scratch, the celebrities must think on their feet and show the judges what they can do.\n\nNext, it’s time for an insight into what these celebs cook for their mates, as they are each tasked with producing two dinner party dishes that would wow the most demanding house guests. The judges won’t go easy on the famous five and will be expecting outstanding execution, presentation and flavours. This year’s celebrities know the standard required and must decide whether or not to play it safe.\n\nThe celebrities work furiously in a last attempt to prove themselves to the judges, because, at the end of this test, the one who fails to shine will be going home."
