        "text": "One of our favourite reality TV series, Married At First Sight Australia, is back on E4 for series 11, bringing more awkward wedding ceremonies, dramatic dinner parties and some sage advice from John, Mel and Alessandra.\n\nFor those who haven't seen the series before, or need a refresher on the concept, each series sees a group of singletons paired up by the experts with their best suited match. The couple then meets for the first time on their wedding day at the end of the aisle. They get married, before embarking on their honeymoon, moving in together, meeting each other's friends and family, and sharing their marriage journey with their fellow cast members at weekly dinner parties.\n\nAnd the new series finally kicked off on E4 at the end of February in the UK, and is expected to run for a number of weeks. So curious when the next episode of MAFS Australia is on? Then here's the full episode release schedule of Married At First Sight Australia season 11.\n\nWhen did Married At First Sight Australia season 11 premiere?\n\nSeason 11 of Married At First Sight Australia first began airing in Australia on 29th January, and us viewers in the UK had to wait nearly a whole month before the series began airing on E4 on 26th February 2024. But, wow, was it worth the wait.\n\nHow many MAFS Australia episodes are there?\n\nSo far the number of episodes for season 11 of MAFS Australia is yet to be confirmed. However if we look at last season, we're in for a lot of dinner party chaos, as season 10 had a whopping 36 episodes, including the reunion episodes.\n\nThe series ran from 30th January to 3rd April 2023 when airing in Australia, so we would imagine series 11 will follow a similar pattern. So for viewers for season 11 in the UK, if we shift this timeline by around a month, the series launched at the end of February 2024 and we can expect it to end at the end of April. So much MAFS.\n\nWhen does the next episode of Married At First Sight Australia season 11 come out?\n\nMarried At First Sight Australia airs on E4 in the UK four nights a week from Monday to Thursday.\n\nEach episode starts at 7:30pm and ends at around 9pm or 9:05pm depending on the length of the episode.\n\nWhen do episodes of MAFS Australia season 11 arrive on Channel 4 catchup?\n\nIf you've missed an episode or switched on the TV half way through you can watch the full episode on catchup on Channel 4 shortly after the episode has aired.\n\nWhat is the MAFS Australia season 11 release schedule?\n\nReady for some dates for your diary? If the series is to follow the same release schedule as the previous, then this is every date the new series is airing. Here's the full episode release schedule of Married At First Sight Australia season 11.\n\nEpisode 1 - 26th February\n\nEpisode 2 - 27th February\n\nEpisode 3 - 28th February\n\nEpisode 4 - 29th February\n\nEpisode 5 - 4th March\n\nEpisode 6 - 5th March\n\nEpisode 7 - 6th March\n\nEpisode 8 - 7th March\n\nEpisode 9 - 11th March\n\nEpisode 10 - 12th March\n\nEpisode 11 - 13th March\n\nEpisode 12 - 14th March\n\nEpisode 13 - 18th March\n\nEpisode 14 - 19th March\n\nEpisode 15 - 20th March\n\nEpisode 16 - 21st March\n\nEpisode 17 - 25th March\n\nEpisode 18 - 26th March\n\nEpisode 19 - 27th March\n\nEpisode 20 - 28th March\n\nEpisode 21 - 1st April\n\nEpisode 22 - 2nd April\n\nEpisode 23 - 3rd April\n\nEpisode 24 - 4th April\n\nEpisode 25 - 8th April\n\nEpisode 26 - 9th April\n\nEpisode 27 - 10th April\n\nEpisode 28 - 11th April\n\nEpisode 29 - 15th April\n\nEpisode 30 - 16th April\n\nEpisode 31 - 17th April\n\nEpisode 32 - 18th April\n\nEpisode 33 - 22nd April\n\nEpisode 34 - 23rd April\n\nEpisode 35 - 24th April\n\nEpisode 36 - 25th April\n\nOk, so if anyone needs us, our schedule is free from 26th April.\n\nMarried at First Sight Australia continues on E4"
