        "text": "Old alliances are rekindled and new bonds are shattered as the women establish the pecking order in the second half of season 11 of VH1′s hit series “Basketball Wives.”\n\n“Basketball Wives” season 11 episode 19 will air Monday, August 5 at 9 p.m. on VH1.

Though they drive expensive cars, live in mansions and wear designer clothes and jewelry, life is not always glamorous. Protecting what they have takes a lot of work ... like fending off groupies, dealing with the jealous kind and trying to find stable ground in their often unstable world. Shaunie O’Neal, Shaquille’s ex-wife, is the show’s featured star and one of its executive producers.”\n\nCatch up on what happened earlier in season 11 in this Basketball Wives Reunion Recap:\n\nWhere to find VH1\n\nYou can find which channel VH1 is on by using the channel finders here: Verizon Fios, AT&T U-verse, Comcast Xfinity, Spectrum/Charter, Optimum/Altice, DIRECTV and Dish.\n\nFor those without cable, watch with these streaming services\n\nYou can watch it on Philo, an entertainment streaming service that offers 60+ channels and a free trial.
