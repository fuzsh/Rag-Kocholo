        "text": "“Battle of the Network Stars” has saved the best for last.\n\nPalm Springs resident John Barrowman will appear on the show’s season finale Thursday alongside “Troublemakers” teammates Vivica A. Fox from “Independence Day,” Paul Johansson from “One Tree Hill, Julie Benz from “Dexter” and Catherine Bach, aka Daisy Duke from “The Dukes of Hazzard.\"\n\nBarrowman is best known for his roles as Captain Jack Harkness on BBC’s “Doctor Who” and “Torchwood,” and as Malcolm Merlyn in CW’s “Arrow” and “Legends of Tomorrow.”\n\nREAD MORE: John Barrowman had a garage sale at his Palm Springs home\n\nHis team will compete against the “TV Lifeguards” team which includes David Chokachi, Brande Roderick, Parker Stevenson, Nicole Eggert and Gena Lee Nolin, all from “Baywatch.”\n\nThe \"Battle of the Network Stars\" reboot is a nostalgic throwback of the ABC Sports classic that started in 1976 and ran for 13 years.\n\nLike the original series, TV celebrities compete in a variety of sporting events including the tug of war, archery, kayak relay, obstacle course and dunk tank to test their athleticism from the show’s original location at Pepperdine University in Malibu.\n\nUnlike the original, there are no longer just three big television networks – ABC, CBS and NBC. The new version takes 100 current and classic TV stars, and divides them into 20 teams from 14 different networks and cable companies.\n\nBarrowman posted a photo from the pre-recorded show on Instagram and urged fans to watch and guess which events he mastered and which ones he tanked.\n\n“Calling all Troublemakers!! Cheer on me and my team, The Troublemakers &mldr; and tune in to see how we did,” he said.\n\nAnyone who follows Barrowman on social medial knows he loves to have fun and entertain his fans, so I can imagine he will be hamming it up pretty good on the show. It should be fun to watch.\n\nHe also has a serious side though, when it comes to standing up for human rights and LGBT issues. In November Barrowman was honored with the Visibility Award from the Human Rights Campaign during the organization’s annual Garden Party at Barry Manilow’s estate in Palm Springs.\n\nHe also has an MBE, Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, from the Queen under his belt, for his service to charity and entertainment.\n\nREAD MORE: John Barrowman honored at LGBTQ event at Barry Manilow estate\n\nIf you watch:\n\nThe season finale of \"Battle of the Network Stars\" with John Barrowman on team Troublemakers will air on Thursday at 9-10 p.m. EDT on ABC."
