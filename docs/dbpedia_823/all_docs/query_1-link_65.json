        "text": "1 9 7 6 – 1 9 8 8 (USA)\n\n19 x 120 minute episodes\n\nPremiering on 6 November 1976, television stars from ABC, CBS and NBC competed in various sporting events in this show which was aired on ABC. In a show business version of the company picnic, each network was represented by eight or ten of its stars from various series.\n\nThe network’s teams competed against each other in events such as swimming, kayaking, frisbee, baseball, obstacle course, running relay, golf, pass-and-catch football and tug of war.\n\nAll ABC asked of the contestants was that the men actually tried seriously to win and the women looked eye-catching. The show was mildly self-mocking and a lot of fun to watch.\n\nThe concept proved popular and continued for an additional eight and a half years, with subsequent episodes airing approximately every six months until May 1985.\n\nOne final competition aired in December 1988.\n\nAll but one of the competitions took place at the sports facilities of Pepperdine University near Malibu, California, the exception being XVIII, which was held in the seaside resort of Ixtapa in Mexico.\n\nSports broadcaster Howard Cosell hosted or co-hosted all but one of the nineteen competitions (he did not host the 1985 edition due to a falling-out with ABC, but he returned for the final edition in 1988) and commented on the action with a semi-serious version of the style for which he was famous.\n\nStars who appeared in the shows included Gabe Kaplan (captain), Telly Savalas (captain), Penny Marshall, Robert Conrad (captain), Lynda Carter, Farrah Fawcett-Majors, Cheryl Ladd, Ron Howard, Hal Linden, Gary Burghoff, Loretta Swit, Valerie Bertinelli, Jimmie “JJ” Walker (captain), Kristy McNichol, Sonny Bono, Kurt Russell, Billy Crystal, Suzanne Somers, Parker Stevenson, Tony Randall, McLean Stevenson (captain), William Shatner (captain), Robert Urich (captain), Lou Ferrigno, Dick Van Patten (captain), Scott Baio, Jamie Farr (captain), Leif Garrett, Ed Asner (captain), Charlene Tilton, Melissa Gilbert, Heather Locklear, Mr T (captain), Robin Williams, Michael J Fox, William Devane (captain), and Tony Danza (captain).\n\nGuest commentators included O J Simpson, Bruce Jenner, Cathy Lee Crosby, Lee Majors, Morgan Fairchild, Debby Boone, and Dick Van Dyke.\n\nIn 2003, NBC attempted to revive Battle of the Network Stars with a two-hour special and Tony Potts as the host. In 2017, ABC revived the series as a weekly summer series, which ran from 29 June to 7 September 2017."
