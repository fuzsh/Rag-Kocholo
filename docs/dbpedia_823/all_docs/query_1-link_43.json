        "text": "Do you have Olympic fever? We do...for the 1984 Summer Games in L.A. We can't cover it all, but we try to hit some of the high marks of this peak eighties event: Carl Lewis, Mary Lou Retton, Mary Decker and Zola Budd, Al Michaels, Jim McKay and Peter Jennings, 84 grand pianos playing \"Rhapsody in Blue,\" Lionel Richie, and a flying saucer!\n\n#podcast #tv #retrotv #eighties #olympics #summerolympics #1984 #1984summerolympics #carllewis #marylouretton #lionelrichie #flyingsaucer\n\nÂ\n\nTo open season 12, we finally turn to the foundation of the Lear-verse, the controversial, groundbreaking, list-making, terlet-flushing all-time great All in the Family. We've got Archie, we've got Edith, we've got Gloria, and, yes, we have Meathead...with a purse! Plus one of our favorite sports as Archie tries out for an \"exclusive\" bowling team and learns a thing or two about the way of the world.\n\n#podcast #tv #retrotv #seventies #eighties #allinthefamily #normanlear #archiebunker #meathead #sitcom #bowling\n\nÂ\n\nLive whenever youâre hearing it from Southfork Ranch, itâs the season 11 BATTY Awards! Join the stars, the youths, the non-humans, and the dopes for the biggest night in retro TV podcasting! We might not have a choir of 500 people or Oprah on a rooftop, but we do have a random number generator and two Dennises the Menace!Â\n\n#podcast #tv #retrotv #seventies #eighties #battyawards #awardsshow\n\nÂ\n\nThis holiday season, gather round the ol' fireplace, roast some chestnuts, sip some hot chocolate and join us we go all the way back to our first ever holiday special, and nothing says the holidays like dopey kids, ghosts, leprechauns, and hags! Rankin and Bass weave one of their most complicated stories yet in The Leprechaun's Christmas Gold, and Jeffy Keane takes a trip into own subconscious to learn the meaning of Christmas...or something. Come to think of it. You might want some eggnog for this one.Â\n\n#podcast #tv #retrotv #seventies #eighties #holidayspecial #familycircus #rankinbass #leprechauns\n\nÂ\n\nIn our Season 11 finale, all roads lead to Dallas and Southfork Ranch! That's right. We finally tackle the grandpappy of the nighttime soaps, and we go all the way back to the very first episode. This one has everything you'd expect: oil, scheming, bakstabbing, family feuds, and cowboy hats! It also have a few things you might not expect like grounded sincerity. Join us for all the fun and a few Larry Hagman chuckles.\n\n#podcast #tv #retrotv #seventies #eighties #dallas #soaps #larryhagman #patrickduffy #victoriaprincipal #oil #jrewing\n\nÂ\n\nFor the 1983-1984 TV season, NBC asked audiences to \"Be there!\" Audiences had somewhere else to be, and by the end of the season, the network had canceled all nine new shows it had introduced in the fall. What could lead to such a catastrophe? Why wouldn't people want to watch shows about talking orangutans, manimals, ghosts, and more? This week, we dig into this season and talk about some of these failed shows to see if we can find some answers. Be there!Â\n\n#podcast #tv #retrotv #1983 #eighties #NBC #Manimal #mrsmith #jenniferslepthere #disaster\n\nÂ"
