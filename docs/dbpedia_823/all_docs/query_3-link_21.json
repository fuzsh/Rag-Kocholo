        "text": "America’s Got Talent is a massive show that is a part of the US pop culture. The game show kickstarted the franchise of Got Talent and has been going on since 2006 with multiple seasons that have been really successful. Season 19 has been going on with eight episodes out so far.\n\nAmerica’s Got Talent Season 19 Episode 9 is the upcoming episode and the show has finally moved on from the audition process which is why people are excited about it. Read on and you will find out more about the episode.\n\nWhat Is America’s Got Talent All About?\n\nSimon Cowell has created America’s Got Talent while Russell Norman is the director. Auditions are conducted for people from different states of the US and abroad as they showcase their talent to the panel of judges.\n\nTheir talent includes a wide range of things including dancing, magic, singing, and other stuff. Once they crack the auditions, they qualify for the live rounds of episodes.\n\nCowell has also executive-produced America’s Got Talent with Richard Wallace, Sam Donnelly, Trish Kinane, Jason Raff, and Rob Wade. The series began on June 21st, 2006 on NBC.\n\nWhat Happened In The Previous Episode?\n\nAmerica’s Got Talent Season 19 Episode 8 was released on July 23rd, 2024, and was the last audition episode. It had Xpogo, which was a group of people doing stunts on pogo sticks.\n\nJudges loved it and they are moving forward. Another one was Prilepin Quartet which was a group that performed hand-balancing acts. Through their strength as well as balance, they managed to impress everyone with the sculptures they made.\n\nKuroko was the next group to feature in this episode. Their act included miming a show of an Olympic-caliber athlete. It was obvious that the judges would say yes considering how entertaining the act was. Haley Viloria and Kelsey Jane were aerialists who showed their amazing flex in separate acts while a rope was attached to them; both impressed the judges.\n\nJourneyy was another contestant who intrigued everyone. He was nine years old and mesmerized even Cowell with his singing. Alejandro Licea Pellon was into hand-balancing acts and did a great job, eventually qualifying for the next rounds.\n\nOther contestants who appeared in this episode are Jonathan Burns who performed magic with a ting of humor, Airfootworks, Corky Miller, Sophie Lennon, Brooke Bailey, and Nick Manning.\n\nWhat To Expect From America’s Got Talent Season 19 Episode 9?\n\nAmerica’s Got Talent Season 19 Episode 9 will be the first quarterfinal episode of this season. We will all see the selected contestants taking on the live episodes in front of the judges and audiences.\n\nFor the first time in the show’s history, we will get to see the golden buzzer being used in the live episode.\n\nIt has the power to send one of the acts to the finale of the show directly. People will also get the opportunity to vote for two of the acts that they like and would want to qualify in the semis.\n\nAmerica’s Got Talent Season 19 Episode 9 will have Journeyy once again impressing everyone with his singing chops. Prilepin Quartet will be also in the episode and will be doing impressive hand performances.\n\nOthers that audiences will get to see next are Kelsey Jane, Nick Manning, Jonathan Burns, Alejandro Licea Pellon, Kurok, etc. It would be really thrilling to see for whom the judges will use the golden buzzer.\n\nIt is possible that they might not use it for anyone in this episode. Overall, there is a lot that will happen in it.\n\nDo We Have A Release Date?\n\nAmerica’s Got Talent Season 19 Episode 9 will be out on Tuesday, August 13th, 2024 on NBC at 8 pm ET. The episode can also be viewed on Peacock later on.\n\nConclusion\n\nAmerica’s Got Talent is a platform for people to showcase their talent. Those who manage to woo the audiences and the judges, get to be on the final stage and come out as the winner.\n\nAmerica’s Got Talent Season 19 Episode 9 is the first episode after the audition phase concluded and it will throw every contestant into the live stage."
