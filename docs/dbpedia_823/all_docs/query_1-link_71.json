        "text": "ABC dusts off \"Battle of the Network Stars\" (9 p.m.). For those too young to remember the Bicentennial Era, \"Battle\" pitted television stars against each other in feats of strength and endurance.\n\nFor viewers, it was like attending a company picnic with the cast of their favorite show, providing an opportunity to see familiar faces compete in tug-of-war while wearing short shorts and T-shirts.\n\n\"Battle\" offered a parody of sports coverage, particularly the breathless \"thrill of victory and the agony of defeat\" style of Roone Arledge's \"Wide World of Sports.\"\n\nHoward Cosell of \"Monday Night Football\" fame added a faux gravitas to the silliness, treating a battle between a young Mark Harmon and Gabe Kaplan as if it had the stakes of an Ali-Frazier bout.\n\nTonight's reboot of \"Battle\" features sitcom stars versus sitcom \"kids.\"\n\nLook for contestants Bronson Pinchot, Tom Arnold, Dave Coulier, AJ Michalka, Tracey Gold, Joey Lawrence, Corbin Bleu, Nolan Gould, Lisa Whelchel and Kim Fields, among others.\n\nIn many ways, this is not terribly different from \"Hollywood Game Night\" (8 p.m., NBC, TV-14), which tonight invites Chris Hardwick, Mike Colter, Charlotte McKinney, Xzibit, David Walton and Sherri Shepherd to play party games.\n\n\"Battle\" viewers too lazy (or too thoroughly entertained) to \"touch that dial\" can sit through an hour of \"The Gong Show\" (10 p.m., ABC, TV-14), featuring appearances by Fred Armisen, Elizabeth Banks and Will Forte.\n\nBoth \"Battle\" and \"Gong\" first premiered in 1976, back before cable and VCRs became common, a time when three networks dominated viewers' choices.\n\nAs venerable as they sound, they're some of the \"newer\" ideas floating around ABC this summer.\n\n\"To Tell the Truth\" dates from 1956. \"The $100,000 Pyramid\" first aired in 1973. Back then, it was only the \"$10,000 Pyramid\"!\n\n- \"Zoo\" (10 p.m., CBS, TV-14), the preposterous ecological disaster fantasy, enters its third season.\n\nTen years have passed since the critters have been \"cured\" of their revolting habits. But now a new threat looms: a species of laboratory mutants bent on destroying the human race.\n\nLike the breezy, trashy James Patterson novels that inspired it, \"Zoo\" can become habit-forming.\n\nTonight's other highlights\n\n- Jamie Foxx hosts \"Beat Shazam\" (8 p.m., Fox, TV-PG).\n\n- The architects mold the band's sound on \"Boy Band\" (8 p.m., ABC, TV-14).\n\n- Reelz unspools three takes on hip-hop-related crimes and mysteries: \"Notorious B.I.G.'s Last Hours\" (8 p.m., r, TV-14); \"Snoop Dogg: Not Guilty\" (9 p.m., r) and \"Tupac: A Hollywood Murder\" (10 p.m., r).\n\n- Juliette and Avery bicker while Scarlett gets a publicity bump on \"Nashville\" (9 p.m., CMT, TV-PG).\n\n- Fatherhood changes Drew's focus on \"The Night Shift\" (10 p.m., NBC, TV-14).\n\nCult choice\n\nRobert Morse and Jonathan Winters lead an all-star cast in the 1965 comedy \"The Loved One\" (10:30 p.m., TCM), an adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's satirical novel about the funeral industry, adapted for the screen by director Tony Richardson and screenwriters Terry Southern and Christopher Isherwood.\n\nActors making brief cameos range from John Gielgud to Liberace and Tab Hunter.\n\nSeries notes\n\nSleeping arrangements on \"The Big Bang Theory\" (8 p.m., CBS, r, TV-PG) ... On two episodes of \"Supernatural\" (CW, r, TV-14), amnesia (8 p.m.), Mary's request (9 p.m.) ... The best man on \"Life in Pieces\" (8:30 p.m., CBS, TV-14) ... A competition determines the head of the household on \"Big Brother\" (9 p.m., CBS, TV-14) ... \"The Wall\" (9 p.m., NBC, TV-PG) ... Andy Cohen hosts \"Love Connection\" (9 p.m., Fox, TV-14).\n\nLate night\n\nVince Staples is booked on \"The Daily Show With Trevor Noah\" (11 p.m., Comedy Central, r) ... Adam Sandler and Dana White appear on \"Conan\" (11 p.m., TBS, r) ... Naomi Watts, Ari Graynor and Swet Shop Boys are booked on \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert\" (11:35 p.m., CBS) ... Jimmy Fallon welcomes Alex Rodriguez, Nick Kroll and Haim on \"The Tonight Show\" (11:35 p.m., NBC) ... Jamie Foxx, Draymond Green and Trace Adkins appear on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" (11:35 p.m., ABC, r).\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda, Jason Mantzoukas, Martha Stewart and Sam Fogarino visit \"Late Night With Seth Meyers\" (12:35 a.m., NBC) ... Joel McHale, Jake Johnson and Lisa Hannigan appear on \"The Late Late Show With James Corden\" (12:35 a.m., CBS, r)."
