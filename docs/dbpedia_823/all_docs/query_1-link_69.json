        "text": "On this week’s Battle of the Network Stars, it was “TV Sex Symbols” versus “Variety” stars — although with variety team members like Joanna Krupa and Nick Lachey, pretty much everyone fell into the sex symbol category. They also, mostly, fell under the un-athletic category.\n\nFormer Baywatch babe Traci Bingham, ironically, needed to be saved from the water after she and Vanessa Lachey not-so-gracefully got into their kayaks — both flipped over their boats when they jumped into them. While Vanessa quickly got back into hers with a little help from her hubby, Traci struggled to get back aboard her vessel. Traci also struggled once she got in the kayak, rowing herself outside of her lane, and finishing far behind Vanessa.\n\nThe water was an issue for a few people, and was an especially difficult one for model Joanna Krupa. The Polish-American model was a part of the freestyle-swimming relay race, but decided to go with the much slower breaststroke. Right after Joanna flopped into the pool, announcer Joe Tessitore said, “What is Krupa doing? Breaststroke on an all-out relay? She was once voted Maxim’s ‘Sexiest Swimsuit Model.’ She will not be voted ‘fastest in a swimsuit.’”\n\nJoanna also struggled on the basketball court, where she hit one out of 25 3-point attempts. Traci wasn’t much better because she had to throw the ball granny-style due to her long nails. Traci said, “We have this thing going with my nails. We thought it wasn’t going to be a problem, but it kind of was. So I kind of switched it up, and so I did this lame, underhanded thing.”\n\nBattle of the Network Stars airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. on ABC.
