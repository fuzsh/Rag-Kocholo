I watch at least four hours of TV a night, and I don't usually have this problem. Even after this I managed to wake myself up and watch several more shows. You'd think that all these people would make it slightly more enthralling, but it doesn't seem like it. I think&nbsp;Road Rules&nbsp;Theo's comment about Ryan Starr's social skills kind of sums it up perfectly: \"I've had a better conversation with a waffle.\" Well, I've had a lot more fun eating than watching this \"competition.\".The only remotely entertaining event was the Super High Jump, which was a leap off a diving board over a bar and into the pool.&nbsp;This looked very silly, but of course Mike the Miz and Co. took it way too seriously. At least there's only one more week of this, although I may miss the quality nap time.\n\nExclusive Peek at Big Battle Twists\n\nTonight at 9 pm/ET, in the fourth of Battle of the Network Reality Stars' six episodes, a big twist (followed by a bigger one) will shift the playing field for the remaining contenders. We already know that The Love Boat's Ted Lange will be stopping by, and that a new team will be added into the mix. So what are we talking about here, putting piranhas in the dunk tank? Better yet, a surprise visit from The Fall Guy's Heather Thomas in the dunk tank? Andrew Cohen, Bravo's vice president of production and programming, gave TVGuide.com an exclusive preview of what's to come. TVGuide.com: What have you got cooking tonight?Andrew Cohen: Well, it's Episode 4, and the big news is that the episode starts with a bang, as each team has to send two players packing. I'm not going to tell you everybody who gets kiboshed, b\n\nCan an Average Joe Be a Battle Star?\n\nHe didn't win the tug-of-war for beauty pageant queen Larissa Meek's heart, but Average Joe: Hawaii runner-up Brian Worth hopes to fare better with an actual rope on Bravo's Battle of the Network Reality Stars (Wednesdays at 9 pm/ET). Can the Beantown bean counter drop people into the dunk tank as easily as he drops his R's? TVGuide.com spoke with Worth about Joe, rubbing Larissa's face in it and living up to Gabe Kaplan's legacy. TVGuide.com: One of those online petition sites is lobbying for you to get your own Average Joe: Adam Returns-type spin-offs.Brian Worth: I saw that! I&nbsp;have Googled my name a few times\n\nPint-Size Racer Does Battle\n\nOn The Amazing Race 5, Charla Faddoul (along with her cousin Mirna Hindoyian) proved that just because she's small doesn't mean she's not a force to be reckoned with. At&nbsp;4 feet tall (due to a form of dwarfism), she carried a 55-lb. side of beef&nbsp;half a mile and survived a run-in with an electric fence. Now she's back on Battle of the Network Reality Stars (premiering tonight at 9 pm/ET),&nbsp;Bravo's newly revamped version of the '70s series. TVGuide.com gave Charla a ring to talk about her stellar jousting skills and&nbsp;the never-say-die attitude&nbsp;she displayed while&nbsp;facing Swan winner Rachel Love-Fraser.TVGuide.com: What are you doing these days?
