        "text": "Taika Waititi’s latest fantasy series, Time Bandits, starring Lisa Kudrow, Kal-El Tuck, Charlyne Yi, Rune Temte, and Tadhg Murphy has been mesmerizing so far, especially when it comes to the intricate and stunning set design as the bandits and Kevin travel across the different periods of history, and of course, plenty of credit also goes to the comedy which is an important part of the series.\n\nUnlike other series on Apple TV+, Time Bandits has chosen a unique release schedule, where they release two episodes every week, giving the fans more content to stream and look forward to.\n\nSpeaking of which, in this article, we will review Time Bandits Episodes 5 and 6, so make sure you stick around!\n\nTime Bandits and Their Journey Continue!\n\nTime Bandits Episode 5 begins on yet another hilarious note as the group sits around a fire and all they have for dinner are sticks, and after that, they have twigs!\n\nNow, this might not seem as hilarious when you read about it, but Lisa Kudrow’s presence and delivery add a comical element to the scene, and we love every second of it. Her role as Penelope is one of the best in this series.\n\nFollowing the opening scene, the bandits are visited by one of the men who work for the Supreme Being who warns the bandits that no matter what, the map they stole should not land in his hands, and no, this wasn’t reverse psychology.\n\nAfter that warning, instead of traveling to Kevin’s home, the bandits land in Georgian England, and we immediately know we’re in for a treat.\n\nOne of the best parts about Time Bandits is the element of time. It brings about so much flexibility for the narrative, which can go just about anywhere in the past. There’s plenty of room for creativity and the series is making the most of it, and this helps the viewers stay hooked!\n\nThere’s Giacomo Casanova, Earl of Sandwich, spoon stealing, an evil cat, and plenty more in this episode of Time Bandits, which almost gives viewers a Bridgerton-esque feel, although the Netflix series wasn’t nearly as funny!\n\nNo episode of this series is complete without an adventure of sorts, and this time it was Penelope being challenged to a duel. Luckily enough, they soon find their portal right before they’re being chased by a demon!\n\nThe bandits now find themselves in 1897 Central Vienna, according to their calculations, but they are actually in Northern Africa, and it is 1324 CE. In addition, Judy is missing, and that comes as a plot twist we did not expect!\n\nHowever, the bandits must continue their journey, and this time around it is time for them to execute their greatest heist of all time as they attempt to steal from the richest person to exist.\n\nAs per usual, there’s another adventure, but this time around when they find the portal, Kevin gets left behind, and by the looks of it, he is further away from home than he previously was, and things aren’t looking so good.\n\nOnce again, Taika Waititi, aka the Supreme Being, makes an appearance towards the end of the episode, who has captured Judy!\n\nConclusion\n\nThe plot has thickened! Kevin is left behind, Judy has been captured, and the bandits are on their way to another period of history, but what’s next for them? Keep a lookout for our review of the next set of episodes to find out more!"
