One last competition aired in Dec 1988. Sports broadcaster Howard Cosell hosted or co-hosted all but one of the first 19 shows (he didn't host the 1985 one due to a falling-out with ABC, he returned for the last one in 1988), and commented on the action with a semi-serious version for which he was noted.
