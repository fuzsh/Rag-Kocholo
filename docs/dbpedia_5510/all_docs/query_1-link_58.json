        "text": "Although New England has a rich spiritual heritage, the modern statistics are heart-breaking.\n\nOf the 14.5 million people in New England, around half of them say they are not very religious, and roughly 60% report they seldom or never attend religious services.\n\nLess than 4% of New Englanders are part of an evangelical church. That means there are about three times more atheists and agnostics in New England than evangelical Christians.\n\nThe five least religious states in the U.S. are located in New England, as are five of America's most post-Christian cities. This isn't surprising, since almost one in five New England residents say they have no religious affiliation at all.\n\nWho We Are\n\nThe Baptist Churches of New England was founded in 1983 as a small network of Southern Baptist churches. Today we are made up of more than 365 churches located across Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.\n\nBCNE churches are extremely diverse. Our members include both some of the oldest churches in the country and brand-new church plants. We have churches with Southern Baptist roots, as well as churches that have joined us from a non-denominational background or another evangelical denomination. Forty percent of our churches are non-Anglo, and churches from around our convention worship in almost 20 different languages every week.\n\nDespite our outward differences, we are united in the things that matter most: our evangelical Christian beliefs as expressed in The Baptist Faith and Message, a love for New England, and a desire to spread the Gospel. We believe that we’re stronger when we work together!\n\nThe BCNE exists to support New England churches. We are here to help you multiply Christ-followers through partnering, equipping and encouraging.\n\nHow? In a surprising number of practical ways.\n\nWe connect New England churches to resources and training opportunities; to our dedicated, experienced staff; to other local churches; to partners in other regions of the U.S.; and to incredible mission work around the globe.
