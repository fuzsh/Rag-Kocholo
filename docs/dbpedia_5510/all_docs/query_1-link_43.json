        "text": "Churches are each autonomous, directly under the Lordship of Christ, and we willingly and joyfully partner in ministry with other Christians and churches on mission. We each bring our unique Spirit-given gifts. We each benefit from one another.\n\nBaptists, from the beginning, have also championed freedom for all people to worship according to conscience. That is, to worship, or not to worship, without being forced to do so or not to do so.\n\nEven in times and places where those labeled heretics were punished by law, Baptists said right belief (while important) can’t be forced by the punishment of the state. Baptists are certain that service to God is crucial—but it must be service freely given. Thomas Helwys (1576-1616), one of the first Baptists, was even put in Newgate prison in London for this belief!\n\nThe church is a covenant community. A covenant is a promise. The Lord has saved us, shown us great mercy and love, and made us a new people. The church is the body of believers united to one another to live as followers of Christ in that newness of life. We gather to Worship him through hearing and proclaiming the word and celebrating the Lord’s Supper and Baptism as Jesus commanded. In living in Jesus’ new life, we learn to love and trust God and live well with one another, with mutual accountability and encouragement.\n\nWe each have responsibilities to minister to one another.\n\nIn different times and places, a common misunderstanding was that being Christian is something like being a citizen of a country—something you are because of where you are born, regardless of your beliefs or faith. Against this view, Baptists have consistently emphasized the importance of a church of “regenerate believers.” That is, being a Christian isn’t about what place you’re from, or what family you're born into. Being a Christian is about trusting Jesus as Lord and following him.\n\n​\n\nHere are where the themes come together: The church is made up of believers who have decided to follow the Jesus and become part of the covenant community in baptism, united to freely serve, under the Lordship of Christ.\n\n​\n\nWe recognize there are many genuine Christians and faithful churches who do not practice confession and then baptism, in that order. FBCM does not require professing Christians, who were Baptized as infants in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, to be (re-)baptized to become members.*\n\n​\n\nAt the same time, our own practice of baptism is in accordance with what we believe the New Testament teaches. We baptize upon confession of faith in Jesus. We proclaim that decision to follow Jesus, and recognize God’s work of salvation, through Baptism in the name of the one true God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit."
