        "text": "National Primitive Baptist Convention\n\nBaptist, Historically Black Church\n\nDate Founded: 1907\n\nMembership: 600,000 Number of Congregations: 1565\n\nHeadquarters: P.O. Box 17727,Pensacola, Florida 32522\n\nSchools & Seminaries: Primitive Baptists do not believe in organized ministerial training.\n\nPublications: Sunday School materials are published, but no magazines.\n\nWebsite: https://npbcconvention.org/\n\nSocial Media: Facebook\n\nCore Beliefs:\n\nMembers embrace some aspects of church life that that align themselves more closely with the other African American Baptist Associations than traditional Primitive Baptist beliefs. Among these are revivals, church auxiliaries, Sunday School, and instrumental music. They do, however, retain the historic Primitive Baptist practice of foot washing after communion. See a complete list of official beliefs. Primitive Baptists refer to their congregational leader as Elder. The NPBC also holds conferences in contrast to most Primitive Baptists who consider the local church the focal point.\n\nShort History:\n\nAfter the Civil War, white Primitive Baptists helped former enslaved people to start their own churches, ordain their own deacons and pastors, and form local associations. The local associations formed a general association in 1907 that was originally known as the Colored Primitive Baptists of America. There are currently churches in 18 states.\n\nLocal Churches: There appears to be no churches in the Kentucky area. The congregations are mainly in Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida.\n\nChurch Locator: https://npbcconvention.org/pages/churchlocator"
