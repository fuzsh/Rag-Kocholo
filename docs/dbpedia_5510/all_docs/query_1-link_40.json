        "text": "The Southern Baptist Convention\n\nSince its organization in 1845 in Augusta, Georgia, the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) has grown to over 16 million members who worship in more than 42,000 churches in the United States. Southern Baptists sponsor about 5,000 home missionaries serving the United States, Canada, Guam and the Caribbean, as well as sponsoring more than 5,000 foreign missionaries in 153 nations of the world.\n\nThe term Southern Baptist Convention refers to both the denomination and its annual meeting. Working through 1,200 local associations and 41 state conventions and fellowships, Southern Baptists share a common bond of basic Biblical beliefs (The Baptist Faith and Message) and a commitment to proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the entire world.\n\nLearn more about the SBC at www.sbc.net.\n\nInternational Mission Board\n\nThe International Mission Board (IMB) is an entity of the Southern Baptist Convention, the nation’s largest evangelical denomination, claiming more than 40,000 churches with nearly 16 million members. The board’s main objective is presenting the Gospel of Jesus Christ in order to lead individuals to saving faith in Him and result in church-planting movements among all the peoples of the world.\n\nGod is using Southern Baptists to carry the light of Jesus to people groups in spiritual darkness across the globe. Your gifts to the Lottie Moon Christmas Offering help to dispel that darkness so that all peoples may know Him. The SBC of Virginia currently partners with IMB missionaries in South America, Asia, and Africa. Visit our Partnership Missions page to learn about how you can work hand-in-hand with God’s people around the globe.\n\nLearn more about the IMB by visiting www.imb.org.\n\nNorth American Mission Board\n\nThe North American Mission Board (NAMB) is the domestic missions agency of the Southern Baptist Convention. NAMB’s defined mission is to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ, start New Testament congregations, minister to persons in the name of Christ, and assist churches in the United States, Canada and U.S. territories in effectively performing these functions. Specifically, they do this by focusing on six major objectives: sharing Christ, starting churches, volunteering in missions, sending missionaries, impacting the culture, and equipping leaders.\n\nTo carry out these objectives, NAMB is supported by your Annie Armstrong Easter Offering. By partnering with NAMB, the SBCV and the local church are better able to reach their Judea and Samaria for Christ. Churches are encouraged to participate in volunteer mission opportunities with our North American missionaries.\n\nLearn more about NAMB by visiting www.namb.net.\n\nLifeway Christian Resources\n\nLifeWay is an extension of the SBC and produces material and curriculum. It is an invaluable resource for all churches and church leadership. LifeWay’s first assignment was the publication of Sunday school literature. More than a century later, LifeWay continues to provide that service, along with 10 other ministry assignments: Church ministries, ministries to college and university students, Christian schools and home school ministries, ministries to men and women, operation of conference centers and camps, publication of books and Bibles, operation of LifeWay Christian Stores, stewardship education, church architecture consultation and services, and capital fund raising.\n\nLearn more about LifeWay at www.lifeway.com."
