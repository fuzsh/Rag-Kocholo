He makes Hart believable without over-accentuating his strengths or minimizing his weaknesses a fine book that challenges much of what is assumed with respect to Baptists and revivalism in the eighteenth-century South.\"—Church History\n\n\"With Order and Ardor, Smith makes a notable contribution to the fields of Baptist and evangelical studies, particularly the importance of the eighteenth-century South. He introduces readers to an oft-overlooked early American father in the faith. He connects Oliver Hart to the larger movements around him in a way denied by Baptist historians in the recent past.\"—Fides et Historia"
