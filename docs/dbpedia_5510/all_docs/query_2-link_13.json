        "text": "The Origins and Development of Baptist Thought and Practice\n\nAmerican Baptists, Southern Baptists and all the scores of other Baptist bodies in the U.S. and around the world grew out of a common tradition begun in the early 17th century. That tradition has emphasized the Lordship and atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ, believers’ baptism, the competency of all believers to be in direct relationship with God and to interpret Scripture, the influence of the Holy Spirit on individual lives and ministries, and the need for autonomous congregations free from government interference or hierarchical polity.\n\nThe origins of Baptist thought and practice can be seen in the late 16th century in English Congregationalism, which rejected the prevalent “parish” structure of church life (Church of England) where everyone in a given community was a member of a neighborhood parish and where children were baptized.\n\nThe reaction against that structure was articulated in the concept of “the gathered church,” in which membership was voluntary and based on evidence of conversion, and where baptism (for the most part) was limited to believers.\n\nThe earliest Baptist churches (1609-1612), although comprised of English- speaking congregants, flourished in Holland, where religious toleration was much greater than in England. Among their leaders were John Smyth, who led the first congregation of 36 men and women, and Thomas Helwys, who returned to England in 1612 to establish the first Baptist church in England.\n\nFrom the beginning Baptists exercised their freedom in choosing to embrace either a strict (predestinarian) Calvinism or Arminianism, which held free will as the fundamental determinant of salvation. General (Arminian) and Particular (Calvinistic) Baptists were among the first distinct groups formed within the Baptist faith. Calvinism tended to characterize Baptist theology until the late 18th century, when enthusiasm developed for evangelism and overseas missionary work. By and large modern Baptists are motivated by an Arminian theology that stresses free will, and have emphasized evangelism and discipleship.\n\nMost early Baptists, while not of a single theological mindset, embraced as essential components of worship and mission the notions of the individual’s “soul competency” and responsibility before God and the inviolability of church autonomy.\n\nIn the early 1630s Roger Williams, formerly a member of the Church of England, took up clerical responsibilities in Massachusetts. However, he eventually became estranged from authorities in the Massachusetts Bay Colony over the failure of church and civil functions to be independent of one another. About 1638 he established the first Baptist church in America in the then-uncolonized Rhode Island (Providence), which became the first government in history founded on the premise of absolute religious freedom. At the same time John Clarke, also originally from England and also dissatisfied with religious practice in Massachusetts, founded a Baptist church in Newport, R.I. Williams and Clarke secured a charter guaranteeing civil and religious freedom in Rhode Island from King Charles II in 1663.\n\nBecause of continuing intolerance by Puritans and others in New England,\n\nBaptist activity developed throughout the 17th century in New Jersey and Philadelphia. In 1707 the Philadelphia Baptist Association formed, comprised of five congregations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. This and succeeding associations honored the autonomy of constituent churches, but served as councils for ordination, and a means of disciplining ministers and settling congregational disputes. By 1790 there were 35 Baptist associations, and approximately 560 ministers, 750 churches and 60,000 members in the U.S.\n\nIn the late 18th century Isaac Backus, of Middleborough, Mass., challenged the notion that Baptists (and other Christian groups), while tolerated, still had to pay taxes to support the established (Congregational) church. Other Baptists confronted the issue in the South, where Anglican influences were prominent. In most cases change was slow to come, but progress in realizing separation of church and state had been made.\n\nJohn Leland, a pastor from Virginia, actively supported Thomas Jefferson’s religious freedom bill passed in Virginia in 1786. As a delegate nominee considering the proposed federal Constitution, Leland originally proposed to vote against it because of its lack of provision for religious liberty. He offered his support, however, when his opponent for the state delegate position, James Madison, convinced him provision for religious liberty would be made in what became the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the Constitution. The Baptist influence, thus, was significant in the First Amendment: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof….”\n\nBy 1833 all of the U.S. states had, in their constitutions, affirmed the principle of separation of church and state with full religious liberty.\n\nThe Call to Missionary Work\n\nBritish pastor William Carey was the most influential figure in beginning the modern missionary movement, articulating the call to overseas service with the question, “If the Gospel was worthy of all acceptation, why is it not preached to all?” He served as the first overseas representative (along with John Thomas) beginning in 1793, and remained engaged in evangelistic and educational ministries for 40 years in and around Serampore, India.\n\nIn fact the first Baptist to evangelize in a foreign country was George Lisle, a freed slave and first ordained black in America, who sailed from Georgia to establish churches in Jamaica in the 1770s.\n\nInfluenced by Carey Congregationalists Adoniram and Ann Judson set sail for India in 1812. After wrestling en route with the notion of baptism (and concluding that only immersive baptism was Scriptural) both became Baptists. No longer engaged by the Congregationalists, and forced out of India by the East India Company, they settled in another mission field, Burma. There Judson was instrumental in church growth and discipleship until his death in 1850, and his vital legacy is acknowledged by Baptist leaders there today.\n\nAnother missionary originally set to serve with the Judsons, Luther Rice, returned from India for medical reasons and to raise support for the Judsons.\n\nHis greatest contribution was motivating the creation in 1814 of the General Missionary Convention of the Baptist Denomination in the United States for Foreign Missions (Triennial Convention), the first unified national missionary-sending effort formed in the U.S. and the forerunner of today’s American Baptist Board of International Ministries.\n\nRice preached and raised money for missionary worked in many areas. He inspired Lott Cary, who later founded the African Missionary Society of Richmond and established the first Baptist church in Liberia.\n\nRice also influenced John Mason Peck, a pivotal figure in domestic missionary work across the U.S. in the early and mid 19th century.\n\nIn 1824 Rice and others helped form the Baptist General Tract Society, which later became the American Baptist Publication Society and eventually the American Baptist Board of Educational Ministries. The goal of that original organization was to utilize educational means “to disseminate evangelical truth and to articulate sound morals.” Its work evolved through the printing of tracts into book and curriculum publishing. Educational outreach was undertaken throughout many parts of the U.S. in the 19th century, including through colporters and chapel train cars.\n\nWithin the U.S. John Mason Peck, Isaac McCoy and others exemplified the mission of the American Baptist Home Mission Society–founded in 1832; now the American Baptist Board of National Ministries–in evangelistic outreach, ministry with Native Americans and the founding of educational institutions.\n\nOrigins of American Baptist Organization\n\nThe issue of slavery reached a peak in 1845 when the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society determined that it could not appoint any candidate for service who held slaves and when the American Baptist Home Mission Society decided separate northern and southern conventions were necessary. The Southern Baptist Convention was formed in response.\n\nNorthern Baptists remained organized as a group of societies until 1907, when the Northern Baptist Convention was formed to structure coordination of the societies’ work while maintaining the autonomy of constituent churches.\n\nThe Ministers and Missionaries Benefit Board, founded in 1913, was begun to meet medical, insurance and pension needs of ordained and lay church workers.\n\nAmerican Baptist Life and Mission Today\n\nAs the acknowledgment that American Baptist life and mission transcends any set geographical area, the Northern Baptist Convention was renamed the American Baptist Convention in 1950. In 1972, in the midst of reorganization that in part reemphasized the congregation-centered mission of the denomination, its name was changed again to American Baptist Churches USA.\n\nIn geographic terms American Baptists have tended to be most numerous in northern states, although church growth in many areas of the South has been realized in recent decades. Numerically, American Baptist Churches USA, which includes about 5,800 congregations and 1.5-million members, is approximately one-tenth the size of the Southern Baptist Convention and ranks sixth in size among the largest Baptist bodies.\n\nGrowing out of the first Baptist association founded in 1707 American Baptist Churches USA now is comprised of 34 regions. They range in size from the individual urban centers of Cleveland, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis and Los Angeles to the 13-state American Baptist Churches of the South, from the 34 congregations of the ABC of Rochester/Genesee to the nearly 500 churches of the West Virginia Baptist Convention.\n\nThe American Baptist Churches Mission Center in Valley Forge, Pa., has served since 1962 as a major site for the ongoing planning of domestic and overseas mission work, and for the production of various resources designed to help local churches and their leaders in their ministries.\n\nToday hundreds of American Baptist home and overseas missionaries serve in partnership with others in a variety of ministries designed to strengthen spiritual, physical and social conditions in the U.S. and in more than 20 other countries.\n\nThroughout their history American Baptists have been led by the Gospel mandates to be directly active in the institutions of society to promote holistic and healing change. The tradition of social outreach and ministry extends back to the enfranchisement and education of freedmen following the Civil War, through frontline advocacy of the Civil Rights Movement, the empowerment of women in church and society, ecological responsibility and the many contemporary issues of justice. Because of the longstanding commitment to outreach to and fellowship with all persons, American Baptist Churches USA today is the most racially inclusive body within Protestantism and will within the next few years be comprised of no racial/ethnic majority group.\n\nIn consideration of Christ’s call to worldwide ministry (Acts 1:8) American Baptists always have been actively engaged in ecumenical ministry, both locally and in such bodies as the National Council of Churches of Christ, World Council of Churches and Baptist World Alliance.\n\nToday Baptists worldwide number 43,000,000 baptized members–and a community of more than 100,000,000 people–in approximately 160,000 churches. The greatest growth can be seen in the two-thirds worlds of Africa, Asia and Latin America.\n\nThe American Baptist Churches USA (ABCUSA) is a mainline Baptist Christian denomination within the United States. The denomination maintains headquarters in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. The organization is usually considered mainline, although varying theological and mission emphases may be found among its congregations, including modernist, charismatic and evangelical orientations. It traces its history to the First Baptist Church in America (1638) and the Baptist congregational associations which organized the Triennial Convention in 1814. From 1907 to 1950, it was known as the Northern Baptist Convention, and from 1950 to 1972 as the American Baptist Convention.\n\nOrganization\n\nThe American Baptists Churches USA has a congregationalist polity emphasizing local church autonomy. Local churches are organized into 33 regions. The General Board makes policy for the denomination’s national agencies. However, General Board resolutions are not binding on local congregations. Three-fourths of the representatives to the General Board are nominated and elected by the regions. One-fourth of the representatives are nominated by the Nominating Committee and are elected by the regions. The General Secretary executes the policies and decisions of the General Board. Rev. Dr. Lee B. Spitzer was called as ABCUSA General Secretary on May 8, 2017. A substantial portion of the ABCUSA consists of African-American churches that may have joint affiliations with the ABCUSA and historic bodies such as the National Baptist Convention or the Progressive National Baptist Convention.\n\nTheology and Practice\n\nAmerican Baptists share the same theological beliefs with Protestant churches which believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God and the final authority in matters of faith. The ABCUSA affirms the Trinity, that the one God exists as three persons in complete unity: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. They confess Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord through whom those who believe can have fellowship with God. He died, taking on the sins of the world, and was resurrected, triumphing over sin and death.\n\nABCUSA churches recognize two ordinances: Believer’s baptism and the Lord’s Supper. Baptism is by immersion, and those being baptized must be of an age to understand its significance. Believing in the priesthood of all believers, the ABCUSA avoids using creeds, affirming the freedom of individual Christians and local churches to interpret scripture as the Holy Spirit leads them. The ABCUSA affirms the ordination of women.\n\nMembership\n\nAccording to a denomination census released in 2020, it claimed 5,025 churches and 1,126,527 members. Congregations are concentrated in the Midwest and Northeast United States.\n\nRegions\n\nThe ABCUSA consists of 33 regional associations and conventions:\n\nRegion Headquarters Area(s) Served Number of Churches Executive Minister Notes American Baptist Churches of Alaska Anchorage, Alaska The state of Alaska Alonzo B.
