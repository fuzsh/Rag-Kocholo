        "text": "Introduction\n\nWith a worldwide membership of about 35 million, the Baptists constitute one of the largest Protestant denominations of the Christian religion. By far the largest concentration of Baptists is in the United States. Of the five major Baptist groups, or conventions, the Southern Baptist Convention is the largest, with more than 16 million members. In order of size, the other four conventions are: the National Baptist Convention, U.S.A., with 5 million members; the National Baptist Convention of America, with 3.5 million; the Baptist Bible Fellowship International, with about 1.2 million members; and the American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A., with about 1.4 million members.\n\nIn addition to these groups, there are at least a dozen smaller ones, including the American Baptist Association, the Baptist General Conference, the Baptist Missionary Association of America, the Conservative Baptist Association of America, the Free Will Baptists, the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches, the National Primitive Baptist Convention, the North American Baptist Conference, the United Free Will Baptists, and the Old German Baptist Brethren. Along with all these organizations, there are a number of churches not named Baptist that generally adhere to the beliefs and practices of the denomination. Those that call themselves Fundamentalist, or Bible, churches are the most numerous in this category.\n\nAlthough there are differences among the many Baptist groups throughout the world, there is general agreement among them on the following points:\n\n1. The Bible is the supreme authority in all matters of faith and practice.\n\n2. Baptism is for believers only. This means that one must be aware of one’s faith before being baptized. Individuals are not normally baptized before the age of 12. The form the ceremony takes is immersion in water, not the pouring on or sprinkling on of water.\n\n3. The church consists of believers only. Hence there can be no state or territorial churches comprising all the individuals living within a certain region. Members must give definite testimony to their faith.\n\n4. Church and state must be kept separate.\n\n5. All Christians are equal in the life of the church. Although some members may be given special responsibilities, this in no way detracts from the priesthood of all believers (the teaching that all Christians have the duty to spread the word of grace and teach forgiveness).\n\n6. Each local congregation is independent, but the congregations manifest their unity by joining associations or conventions.\n\nWorship and Practice\n\nBaptists believe in a very simple style of church and worship service. They feel that having candles, incense, rich altar cloths, and highly decorated vestments does not make one closer to God. In fact, these outward signs may detract from the individual’s direct experiences of God. In this conviction Baptists hope that they are creating a church environment close to the form of early Christianity.\n\nIn keeping with the simplicity of their worship, Baptists also deemphasize creed, dogma, and sacraments. They care more about faith and practice than about intellectual formulations. In fact, Walter Rauschenbusch, a leading 19th-century American Baptist, wrote that he had not read the major Baptist confessions of faith until long after he had been serving as a minister. When he did read them, they did not interest him very much. He was more interested in the experience of being a Baptist.\n\nThe confessions of faith that Rauschenbusch referred to are the Charleston Confession of 1665 and the Philadelphia Confession of 1742. These two works were originally published as small handouts to explain Baptist faith. The pamphlets contain many biblical references to support each article of faith. As a group the Baptists have not generally produced major doctrinal treatises, for they do not find this necessary. They have said of their own adherents that Baptists are a people who profess a living faith.\n\nTwo key beliefs are closely related: the complete separation of church and state and the freedom of religious expression. In the early days of the United States, the Baptists as a group were active in the struggle for religious liberty. They were instrumental in the passage in 1791 of the 1st Amendment to the Constitution, which guaranteed the freedom of religion.\n\nThis willingness to enter into politics for the sake of a principle continues to mark the Baptists in the United States. The black Baptist churches have played a significant role in the civil rights movement. Church buildings were often the meeting places of the Freedom Movement, with Baptist ministers as group leaders. For example, Martin Luther King, Jr., who organized and led nonviolent protest marches and sit-ins for civil rights, was a Baptist minister.\n\nNot all Baptist churches have had an equal interest in civil rights. The five major conventions vary a great deal in their membership and social attitudes. Yet they share fundamental concerns that keep them together as Baptists. It has been stated that the motto of the United States would be a fitting motto for American Baptists: E Pluribus Unum (One Out of Many).\n\nHistory of the Baptists\n\nThough some Baptists trace the origins of their church back to the time of the Apostles, most believe that it began during the Protestant Reformation in Europe in the 16th century, when the Anabaptist movement flourished in Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, and other countries. The Anabaptists’ basic belief was in adult baptism, but they also supported the separation of church and state and voluntary church membership. While there was no direct connection between the Anabaptists and the growth of the Baptist churches in England, it is very likely that the latter were influenced in their beliefs and attitudes by the Anabaptists.\n\nThe Baptist churches, as they exist today, grew out of the Puritan revolt against the Church of England. From the beginning there were two major groups: particular Baptists believed that Christ died to atone for the sins of a select few, and General Baptists believed that Christ died for everyone. Both groups believed that the Baptists should follow the example of the early New Testament Christians as much as possible. To them this meant that the churches should be self-governing groups composed of baptized believers. The keen Baptist interest in the separation of church and state goes back to this earliest Baptist principle.\n\nReligious persecution led a group of people who did not agree with the Church of England to move to Holland in 1608. There, in 1609, John Smith and 36 others formed the first official Baptist church group. In England itself the number of Baptists increased quickly between 1640 and 1660. After 1660 religious persecution under the Stuart kings forced Baptists underground. Some moved to the American Colonies.\n\nRoger Williams, expelled from Massachusetts for his religious views, founded the first American Baptist church at Providence, R.I., in 1639. The General Baptists never really took hold in the colonies, but the Particular Baptists did well, especially in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. In the 18th century in the United States a wave of religious revivalism and fervor, known as the Great Awakening, brought many converts to the Baptists. According to one estimate, there were 494 Baptist congregations in the colonies just before the American Revolution and 1,152 congregations just 20 years later.\n\nBetween 1820 and the start of the American Civil War in 1861, all of the church bodies in the United States became divided over the issue of slavery. In some cases these divisions led to an organizational split. In 1845 the Baptists in the South formed the Southern Baptist Convention. The Baptists in the North, hoping in vain for an eventual reunification, did not form their own Northern Baptist Convention until 1907. This group has been known as the American Baptist Convention since 1950.\n\nIn the 20th century, even more Baptist groups developed. After World War II the Southern Baptists spread beyond the South because their members were moving to the big cities of the North and West. Today Southern Baptist churches are found in almost every part of the United States.\n\nThrough missionary efforts, the Baptists spread to many other parts of the world. In 1792 William Carey, a British clergyman, helped found the English Baptist Missionary Society. He went to India the following year. In 1813 Adoniram Judson went to Burma (now Myanmar) under the auspices of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Other missionaries traveled throughout Asia, Latin America, Africa, and Europe. One of the most successful established churches was in Russia. The Baptists survived there—even through the severe persecutions of the Stalinist regime. By the late 20th century the Baptists had recovered from the worst of the oppression, and it was estimated that there were more than 500,000 Baptists in Russia.\n\nAlthough there have been many splits within the larger Baptist religion, there has also been a move toward unity through the Baptist World Alliance. The Alliance was formed in London in 1905 to bring together representatives from Baptist churches in all parts of the world. The missionary movement had been quite successful, and the Alliance was intended to foster mutual support and encouragement, to coordinate worldwide activities, and to provide a means of exchanging information."
