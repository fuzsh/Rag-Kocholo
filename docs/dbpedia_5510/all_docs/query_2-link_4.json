        "text": "Some baptists have the tradition of naming the first Baptist church in a city or other area \"First Baptist Church\". Sometimes this numbering even continues; for example, in my area there is a \"Fourth Baptist Church\". I do not think there is a denomination or association called \"First Baptist\", as it is merely a naming tradition.\n\nYou should also be aware that there are perhaps over a thousand Baptist denominations and associations. In the United States, two of the larger ones are the Southern Baptist Convention and the American Baptist Conference. They have somewhat different beliefs and practices.\n\nThe \"First Baptist\" church is not a denomination I know of. Usually it's simply the name of the earliest (\"First\") Baptist church built in an area. Hence you sometimes see \"Second Baptist Church\" - that's not a weird denomination, it's the second one on the block. Now, if there's an existing Baptist church and one is calling itself First Baptist, it could be the existing local F.B. moving locations, it could be a Baptist sub-denomination (American, Southern, etc.) that is the first of their type, or they could just be snaking the name to seem first/biggest if no one else was using it.\n\nIt could be a mission -- a church plant -- of a congregation elsewhere called \"First Baptist.\"\n\nWhy not ask them? I'm sure they'll be happy to tell you what it's about, and you'd be honoring them with your interest."
