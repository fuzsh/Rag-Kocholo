        "text": "Let’s just say it: we’re not that kind of Baptist. Historically, some Baptist congregations have been progressive in their social ethics, and they have often affirmed the combining of modern, intellectual thought and progressive theological inquiry. This is the proud lineage of St. Charles Ave. Baptist Church, and we maintain that there are progressive ways to be Baptist in the 21st century. Similarly, our church has and continues to be a leading voice for progressive Baptists in Louisiana and across the Deep South. We frequently partner with other mainline congregations who share in our liberal Protestant heritage.\n\nAs we say, also, St. Charles is an ecumenical congregation in the Baptist tradition. This means our members come from many denominational backgrounds, and our worship often reflects traditions across mainline denominational lines. If you have worshiped with Methodists, Presbyterians, Lutherans, or Episcopalians, you would find our worship style to be similar. Likewise, we maintain a strong intellectual and socially-conscious style of preaching.\n\n*Find an example of our bulletin here.\n\n*Find previous sermons here.\n\nWhat Makes us Baptist?\n\nAnd still, we hold onto our Baptist tradition in a few ways that we feel are very important.\n\nIndividual Freedom\n\nThe first has to do with each individual’s journey of faith. a) We believe each person is free to approach God without a religious authority as a mediator. We believe persons are free to make their own personal decisions on matters of faith and be responsible for them. b) We are free to study the Bible as individuals and exercise scholarly interpretation of Scripture, as led by God's spirit. We may reach different conclusions, and we value those differences dearly.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe second has to do with governance. As far as national governments and religious traditions go, we believe in the separation of church and state. Similarly, we understand the local church to exist freely, able to shape its own life and mission through the contributions and decisions of its local members."
