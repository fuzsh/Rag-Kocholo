        "text": "Registration is now open for the ABHMS Center for Continuous Learning online course Being Baptist: History, Identity & Polity. Over six consecutive weeks beginning September 3, the new cohort will explore the roots of Baptist history, the relationships between different Baptist groups, and the distinctive convictions of Baptist identity.\n\n​\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Rebecca Irwin-Diehl, director of the ABHMS Center for Continuous Learning, shared that the course is “specially designed for those seeking ordination in American Baptist Churches USA, but also offers a great learning experience for Baptist history buffs or learners curious about Baptist history and identity and what difference it makes in today’s world.”\n\n​\n\nLearners will engage in independent study and meet collectively as a class each week via Zoom. In addition, the course features guest lecturers delivering webinars viewable on demand. Scheduled presenters include renowned scholars of Baptist history and polity and seasoned pastors and ministry leaders currently applying Baptist identity in their respective contexts.\n\nUpon course completion, learners should be able to trace and analyze the relationships between different Baptist groups in North America, compare their own church’s Baptist identity with that of other Baptist groups, and apply Baptist doctrine in faith-based, community and political contexts, according to Irwin-Diehl, the lead instructor.\n\n​\n\nAmong the texts woven into the course are Wayne E. Croft Sr.’s “A History of the Black Baptist Church: I Don’t Feel No Ways Tired” (Judson Press, 2020), Everett C. Goodwin’s “Down by the Riverside: A Brief History of Baptist Faith” (Judson Press, 2002), Norman H. Maring and Winthrop S. Hudson’s “Baptist Manual of Polity & Practice, 2nd rev. edition,” edited by David Gregg (Judson Press, 2012), and Walter B. Shurden’s “The Baptist Identity: Four Fragile Freedoms” (Smyth & Helwys, 1993).\n\nBeing Baptist fulfills the Baptist polity educational requirement for ordination candidates in several American Baptist regions. Successful participants will receive a certificate of completion and, where applicable, will earn 3.0 clergy Continuing Education Units.\n\nTo learn more about Being Baptist: History, Identity & Polity and to register, visit the CCL website.
