This calls for doing a couple of short thoughts rather than just one second thought per paper. My time as editor of the Baptist Message is short, and I have undelivered “Second Thoughts” in my head. This calls for doing a couple of short thoughts rather than just one second thought per paper. My first second thought of the day is what it is like to be on the other side of the pen. Normally, we do articles about people and the pieces are published before the subject of the article is able to read it. Well, this week, the Baptist Message has an article about me that was written by Lacy Thompson for the last issue of the paper he put together. He was totally free to do whatever. I have not read it prior to publication. So, I’m a little anxious about it. I have total confidence in the accuracy and fairness of Associate Editor Lacy Thompson, but that is the cause of my anxiety – he may quote me just the way I said it. Which brings me to another point. Lacy Thompson, who has been associate editor of the Baptist Message for 20 years, resigned in order to return to his home in Belle Chasse. His mother’s and … [Read more...]\n\nIn the wake of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, more than 25,000 separate donations totaling more than $18 million have poured into the North American Mission Board – so many that the Southern Baptist Convention entity has hired temporary help to process the gifts. In the wake of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, more than 25,000 separate donations totaling more than $18 million have poured into the North American Mission Board – so many that the Southern Baptist Convention entity has hired temporary help to process the gifts. Nearly $10 million of that amount has already been sent to the devastated areas to minister to needs of individuals and Southern Baptist churches and to share Christ. Most of the checks have been in the $25-$100 range and often come with notes expressing concern for hurricane victims and usually include a “God Bless You” to Southern Baptists for their unprecedented disaster relief efforts the last two months in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Alabama and Florida. Individual donations have been as little as two quarters taped to an index card and as much as half a million dollars. One woman inserted a $5,000 check into an envelope – without a note or instruction of any kind – and … [Read more...]\n\nThe Louisiana Baptist Foundation recently took a pro-active approach to help churches that are impacted by Hurricane Katrina. By Brian Blackwell LBM Newswriter The Louisiana Baptist Foundation recently took a pro-active approach to help churches that are impacted by Hurricane Katrina. The recent hurricanes damaged churches, leaving some of them without a way to receive monetary donations during their weekly services and at their regular mailing address. If churches want the Louisiana Baptist Foundation to act as a “temporary storehouse” for them, Wayne Taylor said they are ready and able to help. “Members or interested persons can mail their tithes to us or they can give on-line,” Taylor, executive director of the foundation, told the Baptist Message after the entity’s recent board meeting in Alexandria. “The foundation will give tax receipts to the individuals and the church can access the money as they need it.” So far, four churches and organizations have established funds with the foundation – First Baptist Church of New Orleans, Baptist Association of Greater New Orleans, First Baptist Church of Chalmette and Global Maritime Ministries in New Orleans. Also, the foundation can … [Read more...]\n\nWeek of November 14, 2005 Rogers hospitalized Adrian Rogers, former president of the Southern Baptist Convention, has been hospitalized for double pneumonia. The former pastor of Bellevue Baptist Church in Cordova, Tenn., was admitted to an area hospital Nov. 3 and reportably is responding well to antibiotic treatments. Since his retirement from the pastorate, Rogers has been undergoing treatment for colon cancer. Church giving down A report released by empty tomb, inc. in mid-October examined the giving trends of church members in the United States and determined that financial contributions to churches were down as a percent of income when compared with previous years. The Illinois-based Christian research organization surveyed 28 Protestant denominations representing 146,000 of the total estimated 350,000 congregations in the United States and found that for each dollar donated to a congregation, denominations spent 2 cents on overseas missions in 2003, down from 7 cents in the 1920s. Half of the 28 denominations grew in membership from 1968 to 2003 and half decreased, the report said, and those that grew had a higher level of international missions support while those that declined had a lower average of … [Read more...]\n\nThe recently-elected president of the Woman’s Missionary Union knows how hard it can be to grow up as the child of missionaries. She did so herself. The recently-elected president of the Woman’s Missionary Union knows how hard it can be to grow up as the child of missionaries. She did so herself. Kay Miller, who grew up calling Thailand home, was elected to office June 2. She is the first child of missionaries to serve as national president of WMU, a Southern Baptist auxiliary organization that promotes missions education, involvement and support. Miller said she remembers how hard adapting to American culture can be. That’s why she is passionate about helping missionaries find ways to help their children adjust to life in the United States. “The No. 1 question missionaries ask me when they find out I’m a missionary kid is how can they help their children adjust better,” says Miller, a member of Immanuel Baptist Church in Little Rock, Ark. “I really hope I can help our missionaries help their children adjust.” Many “missionary kids” – also called MKs – adjust well and live productive, effective Christian lives. Others rebel or never get a handle on adjusting to life in America. “MKs have a hard … [Read more...]\n\nWeek of November 21, 2005 Bible study cartoons As in previous years, Joe McKeever has announced availability of cartoons to accompany the upcoming Southern Baptist Winter Bible Study on the Old Testament Book of Nehemiah. A total of 30 cartoons are available, said McKeever, director of missions for the Baptist Association of Greater New Orleans. The cartoons may be accessed by visiting www.joemckeever.com. At the Web site, persons should click on “Cartoons by Joe McKeever” on the righthand side of the page. On the subsequent page, persons should click on “The Book of Nehemiah.” The cartoons may be used free of charge by anyone teaching the study. Many teachers reproduce the cartoons on transparencies for overhead projection or scan them into computers for display on screens, McKeever said. Committee elections Louisiana Baptist Convention messengers approved reports of the state Committee on Committees and Committee on Nominations without change or challenge last week. Messengers easily passed the reports during the opening session of the annual meeting. In doing so, a total of 85 persons were elected to first or second terms of service on various convention committees and boards. Did you notice I? The … [Read more...]\n\nLouisiana Baptist Convention messengers approved a reduced Cooperative Program budget for 2006 – after changing two allocation percentages. Louisiana Baptist Convention messengers approved a reduced Cooperative Program budget for 2006 – after changing two allocation percentages. Messengers approved the $21 million budget – down from $22 million this year – after voting to restore a proposed $52,500 cut for the Louisiana Baptist Message newspaper. The budget action was one of three matters presented to messengers by the LBC Executive Board. It was the only one of the proposals to draw debate. The proposed budget marked a reduction of $1 million (4.5 percent) from the current year. Leaders explained the reduction was needed due to the expected impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. More than 150 churches were affected by the storms in some fashion and dozens still are unable to hold services or receive offerings. State leaders already are expecting the storms will cost the state from $500,000 to $1 million this year. As proposed, all line items but two shared equally in the reduction, maintaining the same allocation percentages as in this year’s Cooperative Program budget. However, the Baptist … [Read more...]\n\nLouisiana Baptist Convention messengers elected Bill Robertson of Winnsboro as president last week in decidedly easy fashion. Louisiana Baptist Convention messengers elected Bill Robertson of Winnsboro as president last week in decidedly easy fashion. Robertson was elected to the state convention office on a vote of 792 (59.5 percent) to 540 (40.5 percent) against Jerry Chaddick, an evangelist from DeQuincy. Robertson is pastor at Temple Baptist Church in Winnsboro. The election marked the first time a presidential candidate endorsed by the Louisiana Inerrancy Fellowship had not been elected. By the end of the convention, only one of three candidates endorsed by the group had been elected – Collin Wimberly of Swartz, who was chosen as second vice president. Wayne DuBose of Minden was elected first vice president. The inerrancy group had endorsed presidential candidates since 1999, proving successful in electing a trio of pastors who served two one-year terms each. However, this year, some supporters of the group differed on who should be elected as the state leader. Both announced nominees affirmed their view of biblical inerrancy and emphasized the importance of taking the gospel to all of Louisiana … [Read more...]\n\nLouisiana Baptists were challenged last week to touch their world – beginning with the most basic gospel task. Louisiana Baptists were challenged last week to touch their world – beginning with the most basic gospel task. “You want to touch your world,” Tom Elliff asked messengers in the first of three Bible studies at last week’s annual Louisiana Baptist Convention in West Monroe. “Here’s where it starts – be a soul winner for Jesus.” Elliff focused his three Bible studies on the convention theme – “Louisiana Baptists touching the world.” In addition to urging a focus on soul winning, he called on persons to pray for their families and maintain a lifelong commitment to the work of the gospel. Elliff is a former missionary and longtime pastor who recently was elected senior vice president for spiritual renewal and church relations for the Southern Baptist International Board. In the first study, Elliff cited four reasons persons should be soul winners: • There is a compelling reality one must acknowledge. “The compelling reality is this – people who do not know Jesus will spend an eternity in hell separated from God, ...” Elliff said. “They are hopelessly lost. They are staggering to slaughter. … [Read more...]\n\nDuring considerations of the proposal to put the operation and publication of the Baptist Message under the Executive Board’s staff, this editor has remained publicly silent. What to do about where the paper’s operation and publication was a Baptist Message Board, Executive Board and Louisiana Baptist Convention decision. While I had strong thoughts and feelings about the matter, I did not feel a departing editor should try to sway opinions and actions for the future. During considerations of the proposal to put the operation and publication of the Baptist Message under the Executive Board’s staff, this editor has remained publicly silent. What to do about where the paper’s operation and publication was a Baptist Message Board, Executive Board and Louisiana Baptist Convention decision. While I had strong thoughts and feelings about the matter, I did not feel a departing editor should try to sway opinions and actions for the future. But messengers to the Louisiana Baptist Convention last week spoke clearly to the matter on two points. The first was when messengers voted to alter the 2006 budget proposed by the Executive Board. All agencies of the convention were reduced, but the Baptist Message allocation was … [Read more...]"
