        "text": "We believe that the Bible is the inerrant word of God.\n\nWe believe in one God who exists eternally as three distinct persons.\n\nWe believe that Jesus is God’s Son. In his incarnation, he took on human flesh, lived a sinless life, died for our sins upon the cross, and rose from the dead three days later.\n\nWe believe that salvation is offered freely to all who repent of their sins and trust in the finished work of Jesus on the cross. Salvation is by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone.\n\nWe believe the church is central to God’s plan for humanity. As individuals are saved, God adopts them into his REAL FAMILY for strength, encouragement, support, and discipleship.\n\nWe believe that Jesus is coming back to judge the living and the dead. Everyone who has ever lived will stand before the Lord to give an account for their lives. Those who have trusted in Christ’s work upon the cross will receive the gift of eternal life.\n\nFirst Baptist Middleburg is an independent, self-governing church that chooses to partner with several like-minded organizations to advance the gospel and strengthen our church. Our primary mission partners are:\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention. The SBC is a coalition of over 45,000 churches that partner together to support international missionaries, plant churches, and train pastors. Through this partnership, our church invests in the ministries of over 8,000 missionaries and church planters around the world (and in the U.S.). Additionally, the SBC supports six fully accredited seminaries to train future pastors and missionaries. One of the ways we partner with the SBC is through our participation in the Florida Baptist Convention.\n\nFirst Coast Churches is a partnership of over 200 churches in the northeast region of Florida. Partnering with FCC allows us to encourage and strengthen sister churches in the region and support local missions causes.\n\nWe also participate in the Black Creek Baptist Association, a smaller association of churches that focuses primarily on mission endeavors in Clay County."
