        "text": "Southern Baptist Convention\n\nVonore Baptist Church ministers with other churches of our denomination on three levels:\n\nThe Sweetwater Baptist Association\n\nWe cooperate with 66 area churches to reach East Tennessee for Christ.\n\nThe Tennessee Baptist Convention\n\nWe are united with over 3,000 churches sharing the goal of reaching Tennesseans with the gospel and beginning new churches.\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention\n\nWe participate with more than 47,000 churches, 1200 local associations, and 41 state conventions together in a worldwide effort to take the message of Christ to all nations.\n\nWhat is the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC)?\n\nIt is the largest association of Protestant Christian churches in Tennessee and in America with over 13 million members represented in 47,000 churches.\n\nWHAT ARE THE BELIEFS OF SOUTHERN BAPTISTS?\n\nFor a complete overview of our theology, please click here to review the Baptist Faith and Message (2000).\n\nWhy are we affiliated with the SBC?\n\nIt allows us to identify with other followers of Christ around the world who are known for their commitment to the Bible. While a member of the SBC, we still maintain our autonomy. For example:\n\nEvery Southern Baptist Church chooses its own pastor and staff.\n\nEvery Southern Baptist Church owns its own building and assets.\n\nEvery Southern Baptist Church determines its own program and ministries.\n\nIt allows our church to participate in the largest missionary organization in the world. Through the SBC Cooperative Program, we help support over 3500 international missionaries and over 6000 missionaries in North America (2022).\n\nHow Does Vonore Baptist Church fit in the SBC?\n\nWe sponsor mission opportunities to build new churches and buildings to further ministries around the world.\n\nWe send, and sponsor, mission teams to assist those who have been devastated in natural disasters.\n\nOur mission-minded, volunteer members go out on short-term mission trips to minister to people in other countries.\n\nVonore Baptist gives generously to the Cooperative Program for ministries throughout the SBC."
