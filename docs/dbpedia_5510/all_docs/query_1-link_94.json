        "text": "THE TRINITY\n\nWe believe in one eternal God coexisting in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n\nThese three comprise the Trinity. They are co-eternal, co-powerful, and co-equal.\n\nGOD THE FATHER\n\nWe believe that God as Father reigns over His creation and works providentially in and through history to accomplish His purposes.\n\nHe is immortal, invisible, and infinitely wise, loving, and gracious. Those who receive forgiveness of sins\n\nthrough faith in His Son Jesus are adopted as sons and daughters. Galatians 4:4-6\n\nJESUS\n\nWe believe that Jesus is God’s son. Jesus being completely God took on the form of man having no sin. Jesus provided the way of salvation, by dying on the cross to pay for the sin of all mankind. He rose from the dead and ascended into heaven.\n\nJesus sits at the right hand of God the father in heaven, and will one day return to earth to judge. John 14:6\n\nTHE HOLY SPIRIT\n\nWe believe the Holy Spirit is active in the world today convicting men of sin, righteousness, and judgment. At the moment of regeneration he fully permanently inhabits the believer and enables him to accomplish God’s will.\n\nThe Holy Spirit can be offended, grieved by sin in the life of the believer. Ephesians 4:30, Romans 8:9-11\n\nMAN\n\nWe believe man is the special creation of God, made in His own image. He created both male and female, thus gender is part of the goodness of God’s creation. Every man is born with the natural desire to sin, so as soon as individuals are capable of moral action, they become transgressors and are under condemnation. Only the grace of God can bring man into right relationship with Him.\n\nEvery person possesses value and is worthy of respect and love. Genesis 1:26-27\n\nSALVATION\n\nWe believe salvation is the all-encompassing work of God in the life of a fallen man and it is offered freely to all men. When a man confesses and repents of his sin before God, God regenerates, redeems, and justifies the sinner.\n\nSalvation has been provided only through the atoning death of Jesus on the cross. Colossians 1:13-14\n\nBAPTISM\n\nWe believe Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It is an act of obedience and a testimony to the world of the believer’s faith in the work of Christ. It is also representative of a believer's death to sin, the burial of the old life, and the resurrection to walk in a new way. Baptism is a prerequisite to church membership and to the Lord's Supper.\n\nActs 2:41-42\n\nTHE CHURCH\n\nWe believe the church is both a local group of believers who have covenanted together in Gospel fellowship as well as all of those who have placed their faith in Christ for salvation. The head of the church is Jesus Christ. It is God’s primary way of communicating the Gospel. Ephesians 4:1-6\n\nTHE BIBLE\n\nWe believe Scripture is God’s revelation of truth in written form. Men of God were divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit to write the very words of Scripture. Therefore, the Bible is the only perfect instruction from God for faith and daily living. The central message of Scripture is the good news of the Gospel revealed in the life and works of Jesus Christ. 2 Timothy 3:16-17\n\nWORSHIP\n\nWe believe that worship is our response to who God is and what He has done for us. It is the purpose for which we were created, glorifying God through lives marked by love and wholehearted devotion to Him. As we consider His majesty, supreme worth, and depth of love for us as shown in the Gospel, we worship both personally (enjoying Him through a growing relationship), and corporately (singing, praying, and hearing His Word together). Hebrews 13:15, Deuteronomy 6:5\n\nPRAYER\n\nWe believe prayer is communicating with God. Christ is the means by which God hears our prayers. Genuine prayer impacts the life of the believer and moves God to action according to His will. It is both corporate and private. It is an expression of dependence upon God and is essential for a healthy relationship with Him. Philippians 4:6, James 5:16b"
