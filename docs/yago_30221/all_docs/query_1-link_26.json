        "text": "Mercedes Molinere Calvert passed away on Saturday, June 8th, at the age of 97. She was born on March 29, 1927, on the island of Pointe Barre near Montegut, Louisiana. The island was washed away by the acts of man and the incessant rising tide from the Gulf of Mexico. Her family has lived in Louisiana since the American Revolution and had lived near Pointe Barre since 1825. Mercedes’ native language was French and she spoke French her entire life. In light of her childhood language barrier, Mercedes was only able to proceed to the 6th grade. She took pride in the fact that all her children had received advanced degrees in their respective fields of study.\n\nShe was the daughter of Pearl Billiott Molinere and Levest Molinere. She had 6 siblings: Andrew Molinere, Sr., Louis Molinere, Roland Molinere, and Joyce Molinere Johnston, who preceded her in death. She is survived by Russell J. Molinere and William Molinere.\n\nMercedes arrived in New Orleans in the early 1950’s, a city which she loved dearly. In her early years in New Orleans, she met Glen “King Bee” Calvert. They were married and had three children: her oldest son Glen Calvert (Jeanne), Thomas B. Calvert (Daun), and Beatrice Calvert. She had 3 grandchildren: Samuel, Hadlee, and Preston. She is also survived by her first daughter-in-law, Linda Stone Calvert, the mother of Samuel.\n\nMercedes is survived by numerous cousins, nephews, nieces, grand-nephews and grand-nieces, too many to identify in the limitation of the obituary. The family would like to thank Julie Krygowski of the Trace for all of the compassion and support she showed Mercedes over the years. There will be a service honoring the life of Mercedes Molinere Calvert on Friday, June 21, 2024, at Greenwood Funeral Home, located at 5200 Canal Blvd., New Orleans. The visitation will be open to the public from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. Mass will begin at 11:00 a.m. A Christian burial will follow. We would ask that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to an environmental advocacy group or to CASA of Terrebonne Parish, an advocacy group for children in foster care in Terrebonne Parish.
