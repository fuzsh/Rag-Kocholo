        "text": "She lived the quiet, unassuming life of a retiree but had one of the most famous last names in Tampa.\n\nMercedes M. Ybor was one of the last remaining descendents of Vicente M. Ybor, one of the founders of Tampa's cigar industry and the man after whom Ybor City is named. She died of pneumonia Oct. 24 at age 95.\n\n\"She was one of the last of this part of the family,\" said her nephew, Rafael Ybor. \"I have two nephews who live in other cities, but now I'm the only one left in Tampa.\"\n\nMiss Ybor, the granddaughter of Vicente Ybor, was born in the neighborhood that bears the family name. She was named after Vicente Ybor's wife.\n\nShe didn't stay in Tampa long. Her father was the consul general for Cuba. As a child, she and her family moved to several cities, including New Orleans, Philadelphia and Miami, as well as Havana. (She was a dual citizen of Cuba and the United States.)\n\nShe never married but was never alone. For most of her life she lived with her older sister, Maria, who died three years ago.\n\nMiss Ybor was an accomplished singer, and her sister was a talented pianist. The two often performed together.\n\n\"They were living in Miami during (World War II)\" Rafael Ybor said. \"They would perform for the officers who came to Miami for training. They would do classical music and popular Spanish music, a little of both.\"\n\nMiss Ybor returned to Havana, but she left Cuba for good in 1962, in the early days of the Castro regime.\n\nShe had an interest in gems and jewels and, for a time, ran the jewelry department at a Saks Fifth Avenue in Miami Beach. She later became a gemologist and opened a shop in the lobby of the Royal Orleans Hotel in New Orleans' French Quarter.\n\nMiss Ybor retired in 1980, then moved to Tampa with her sister. They lived near WestShore Plaza for many years. The sisters outlived most of their contemporaries and spent their retirement years indulging in their passion for concerts and opera at the Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center or just relaxing at home listening to recordings of Luciano Pavarotti.\n\nOver the years, they grew even closer to their nephew.\n\n\"Our family was always extremely close,\" he said. \"I'm an only child, and they were like the older sisters I never had. I was born in their house in Havana, and I lived with them for a large part of my life. Mercedes was a big part of my life for 77 years, which is how old I am. She was the only relative I had left, and I'm going to miss her.\""
