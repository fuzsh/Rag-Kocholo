        "text": "A precious gemstone gifted to the King of Spain by his mistress and then handed over to his wife the Queen has raked up a reputation of being cursed.\n\nOver the years the opal, which was set in a ring presented by the Countess of Castiglione to King Alfonso XII, has been linked to the deaths of at least four members of the Spanish Royal Family – including Alfonso.\n\nThe ring was a parting gift from Virginia Oldoini, the Countess of Castiglione to her lover the King following his love match with 18-year-old Mercedes of Orléans in 1878.\n\nContemporary reports claim the Countess sent the ring to Alfonso a few months after his marriage and his new bride became so enamoured with the jewel he immediately handed it over.\n\nAn article published in the Chicago Tribune in 1898 read: \"Alfonso gave it to her readily, and she slipped it on her finger. From that moment she pined away.\n\nREAD MORE: The royal diadem that ‘brings bad luck’ to ‘anyone who owns it’\n\n\"In a few months, she died. The ring fell from her dead hand, and the King, who could not bear to see it, gave it to his grandmother, Queen Christina, who died a few months later.\"\n\nCourtisans had noted shortly after the couple had returned from their honeymoon that the young Queen had been unwell and she was soon diagnosed with typhoid fever. During their short marriage, she also experiences a miscarriage.\n\nAlfonso's grandmother, Queen Christina of the Two Sicilies, had struggled with ill health for years but the situation reportedly worsened within days of receiving the ring and she died two months after Mercedes.\n\nThe Countess of Castiglione's ring was then presented to the King's sister, Infanta Maria del Pilar, who never woke up again after experiencing a severe convulsions episode triggered by a mysterious illness, possibly tuberculosis, in August 1879.\n\nHorrified by the string of tragedies his family experienced, Alfonso allegedly chose to hold on to the ring and wore it on his pinkie.\n\nThe Tribune's report added: \"After this series of fatalities, the King determined to keep the ring himself, and he slipped it on his little finger. From that moment his health began to fail, and in twenty-four hours, he was dead.\"\n\nDON'T MISS:\n\nKate's sapphire ring linked to long-standing royal superstition [STYLE]\n\nThe lesser known royal that has more military medals than Charles [EXPLAINER]\n\nThe four things the Royal Family are banned from doing on social media [LIST]\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
