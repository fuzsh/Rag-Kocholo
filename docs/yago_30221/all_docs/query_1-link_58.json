        "text": "In February 2023, former Louisiana state superintendent John White’s wife, Katherine Westerhold, was in the news because their home security system captured audio of a New Orleans shooting at the Krewe of Bacchus parade. Fifteen-year-old Roderick Tobias died as a result. He was one of five individuals shot during the incident.\n\nI remembered reading the above news story in 2023 as I read Westerhold’s March 25, 2024, letter to the editor in Nola.com:\n\nLetters: The statistics show Louisiana doesn’t need constitutional carry\n\nLouisiana has the second-highest gun death rate in the country. In 2021, Louisiana had just over 28 gun deaths per 100,000 residents. The national average was just under 15. Massachusetts had 3.5. Mississippi is the only state with a worse gun death rate than us. If Louisiana were a country, it would rank third in the world for gun death rates, following closely behind El Salvador and Venezuela and leading Colombia and Honduras.\n\nNew Orleans is worse with 38 gun deaths per 100,000 residents. Still, in our rural parishes, the rates are not much better with many parishes, including Madison, Concordia and Evangeline, ranging from 25 to 28.\n\nWorse than that, Louisiana leads the nation in juvenile firearm deaths with 17 gun deaths per 100,000 people. None of our children are immune to these statistics. These problems cross geographic lines, racial lines and socio-economic lines. Young Black children in our community have been disproportionately harmed by these trends, but children across our state are affected and deaths by firearms.\n\nAs a concerned Louisiana mom, education policy expert and engaged citizen, I am here to say this: We can fix this problem, and it starts with the decisions we make in Baton Rouge. Elected officials like state Sen. Blake Miguez believe that dropping the minimum age of concealed carry from 21 to 18 years old amid a gun violence epidemic will make us all safer. His bill dropped longstanding training requirements that cover topics like how to ensure your firearm does not end up in the hands of a child. We need leaders who will stand up, push back and reject radical policies that make you, me and our children less safe.\n\nKATHERINE WESTERHOLD\n\nNew Orleans\n\nAfter being signed into law by Louisiana governor Jeff Landry on March 05, 2024, Miguez’s SB 1, now Act 1, “Provides relative to the right of law-abiding citizens to carry concealed handguns lawfully without a permit,” goes into effect on July 4th, 2024.\n\nAccording to Act 1, the age to carry a concealed handgun is indeed lowered to 18 years of age, no permit needed. However, on the honor system, the concealed weapon toter is supposed to not bring the gun to places where carrying a gun is “banned by state or federal law” (like, say, to a public school), and the gun toter is supposed to let homeowners know, “Hey, I am carrying a handgun” and procure their permission to bring the gun into the residence before entering.\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nThere is not much that finds me on the same side of issues even loosely connected with John White. However, on this issue, I’m with Katherine Westerhold.\n\n_______________________________"
