        "text": "I remember my first one-to-one with Jackie B. Cooper like it was yesterday. This man averaged selling 52 vehicles a month for over 3 years in the small town of Woodruff, South Carolina, with a population of just 5,000! In his renowned automotive training, Jackie never aimed to change what salespeople were already doing. Instead, he sought to complement their existing methods, whether through audio, video, or live stage performances. His goal was simple: make salespeople laugh and learn. Jackie B. Cooper is not just a trainer; he is a legend and, in my opinion, the GOAT of the automotive industry. üèÜüëë #AutomotiveLegend #SalesTraining #JackieBCooper #GOAT #AutomotiveIndustry #SalesSucces #ToddVowell #DisruptMarketing #CarDealers\n\nAlways a great time visiting our friend and client Matthew McCormick at the #1 volume CDJR dealership in South Carolina, Benson CDJR. It‚Äôs incredible to see what a business is capable of when they retain their staff and clientele. It is and will always be the most profitable strategy in existence. RETENTION. The amount of effort put in to retention will always provide an equal or greater payoff. In our vertical it is referred to as ‚Äústickiness‚Äù. What makes a product ‚Äústicky‚Äù is the ability for it to be purchased and/or used repeatedly. How do you make it sticky? By making sure it does what it‚Äôs supposed to! Combine this with exceeding expectations and you just found THE recipe for success. #automotiveindustry #agencylife #adagency #carbusiness #cardealers #chrysler #jeep #dodge #ram #retention\n\nImagine you‚Äôre driving down the road to the shops, when suddenly Lewis Hamilton stops you and tells you that you should be going at least 200mph if you want to win. And what are you doing without a fire-proof suit and helmet on?! ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not a Formula One driver,‚Äù you‚Äôd say. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just going to Home Bargains.‚Äù Because you know your Corsa doesn‚Äôt even reach 200mph. And even if it did, you‚Äôd very quickly crash or get arrested if you attempted it in the middle of Norwich. And you don‚Äôt need any of the fancy safety gear either, because the speed and context of your drive is completely different from his. It would be foolish to assume that you‚Äôre in exactly the same position just because you both drive a car. So while his concerns would be very valid if you were a racing driver, and the advice would be sound‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs useless to you. Keep that in mind next time you‚Äôre listening to marketing leaders and big businesses telling you how you should be doing things. ‚Äî My most recent article is on exactly this topic - check out the link in the comments below! üåü #goodadvicebadcontext #smallbusinessmarketing #b2breakout\n\nWhy the awards keep coming for one Welsh retailer: A European title and three national honours put Gravells Kia Bridgend in a league of its own.
