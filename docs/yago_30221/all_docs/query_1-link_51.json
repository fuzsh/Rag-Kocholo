        "text": "ADDENDUM … presented at the church I attended at the time,\n\nCenter for Spiritual Living Nashville (circa 2006)\n\nGood morning!\n\nToday is a very special day for me and, seeing it coming, I didn’t want it to pass without at least trying to maximize its potentials, so I asked Rev. Mitch if I could have a little podium time. The long version of the story I have to tell you could fill a book and maybe it will someday, but I only have a few minutes here today, so I’ve written this Reader’s Digest version, to keep me on task.\n\nShortly I will have the pleasure of introducing you to the music of my dear friends Kathie Baillie, her husband Michael Bonagura, and their daughter Alyssa. Our history now spans nearly 30 years.\n\nThat history is a story of the power of intention at work — how there are no coincidences, just weird but meaningful twists and turns along the long and winding road of a life … a story of knowing “what” without having a clue as to “how”, yet seeing it show up as “demonstrations” of the Law of Mind … of how thoughts become reality and how that can completely change and sculpt the course of a life. There are even some angels at work in this story. And even though this is MY story, I hope to successfully relay this in a way that allows you to relate it to YOUR story.\n\nThe best way to tell this tale will be to stick to the timeline, which will allow me to establish the all-important context before we get to the punch line, so please bear with me. Here goes.\n\nSome of you know that in the mid-70s I was in a rock and roll band that achieved a good measure of success … living in Woodstock, NY, hit records, big tours and all that. These were upswing years. I was living my dream! But, in 1977, after five years of hard work and just at the peak of that success, we did a really dumb thing — we broke up. Oh well …\n\nA lot of things happened in the downturn that followed. One thing was that I got this phone call from a stranger named “Michael”. He said he was a fan of our defunct band and that he and his girlfriend, Kathie, had a trio … and that their singing bass player/partner, Alan, had quit to be in “Beatlemania” … and he asked if I would consider taking Alan’s place. Well, I declined that offer, but I did arrange to bring Kathie and Michael into the studio and produce some demos for them. We did a couple of projects that year (1978) and then, as it happens, we lost touch as they went on with their lives and I went on with mine.\n\nMy band managed to get back together, get another record deal, have another hit, do some more touring … I got married. Life was good again for a couple more years. Then the bottom really fell out, big time. By ’81 we had no deal, we were heavily in debt and everything I had acquired … all my guitars and amps and recording equipment, my piano, my Mercedes, you name it …everything was sold off to pay bills. Since I could no longer pay the rent, my wife and I had to move out of our nice big place with the pond in the back yard and into the tiniest of houses, where I learned the value of a cubic inch of space.\n\nFor the next three years, the band worked like dogs just to pay our creditors as I sunk deeper and deeper into personal debt and despair. In ’84, at the age of 30, I was a defeated and angry young man. A “has-been” in my own mind.\n\nFinally, I admitted to myself that I would have to do something drastic just to survive, so I reluctantly took a position with a direct sales company with the promise of big commissions. Now, this was the LAST thing I wanted to do, since my entire sense of self and identity was built around being a musician, but it was my only real option at the time.\n\nAt first I was really awful at the job, but I was desperately hungry and determined not to fail. Soon I got the hang of it and became the top new salesman for the month … then for the quarter. And, since I really didn’t want to remain a salesman in the field any longer than absolutely necessary, I set my sights on becoming the sales RECRUITER for that branch of the company. Within a couple of months, I was hiring and training and, after two years, I had become the top trainer in the entire Northeast Division and the acting General Manager for one of the top-10 producing offices in the world. In the process and in order to achieve all this, I had become “that guy” — the suit and tie sales businessman — at the expense of the musician in me … and I was completely miserable.\n\nNow, during the same time frame, my first wife had discovered her own career calling and was growing along her chosen path, while I was growing more and more off mine. So, it wasn’t a big surprise when, at the end of ’87, she announced that she wanted a divorce — although it WAS devastating. Anyone who’s ever been abandoned, especially when you’re already miserable, knows what that feels like.\n\nThat was my wake up call; my Cosmic 2×4. I spent the beginning of ’88 getting my bearings and became determined to reclaim my life. Now, I had already been exposed to the essence of the Science of Mind teachings through books like “The Magic of Thinking Big”, by Dr. David Schwartz, “Think and Grow Rich”, by Napoleon Hill … I had tape programs from Denis Waitley, Earl Nightingale, Wayne Dyer … I watched Dr. Norman Vincent Peale’s “Hour of Power” on TV … I listened to self-empowerment and guided visualization meditation audios … and I was doing the best I knew how to set intentions for my life and reprogram my subconscious for success … to somehow manifest this new life of mine.\n\nMy primary aim, my CORE desire was to once again be a full-time professional musician, and I thought about this every day.\n\nOK … now stay with me, ‘cause we’re about to get to the good stuff … I promise!\n\nSo, I clearly knew “what” I wanted, but I had absolutely no idea as to “how” that could happen for me. I DID know that I was not going to get to some new future by holding on to my present and my past. So I announced to my employer that I would be leaving the company, not knowing what was next.\n\nWell, “next” was a job selling pools in-home for the summer. I did OK, but I often had to drive long distances to appointments and, in general, I hated it. Just as I was ready to quit, I got a job offer selling replacement windows and water treatment systems on the floor of a home improvement center. At least now the appointments were coming to me. I did this for the fall and winter. Again, I did OK, but I hated it. I was again ready to quit, but I didn’t have anything to take its place.\n\nNow remember: All along, I was doing my version of Spiritual Mind Treatment, using visualization and affirmation techniques … all geared towards manifesting a shift back to my musical calling and career.\n\nI remember quite clearly driving home from another evening of work on January 10th of 1989. I had this thought; this wish; this hope; this prayer that there would be some kind of good message on my answering machine. When I got home, there WAS a message and it simply said, “This is Michael from Nashville. Please call me back right away.”\n\nWell, I had no idea who “Michael from Nashville” was and it was late, but I did call back the next day to discover that “Michael from Nashville” was really Michael Bonagura from New Jersey. Now, keep in mind that we had not communicated at all for a full ten years. He proceeded to explain to me that he and Kathie were now “Baillie & the Boys”, had a deal with RCA, had already had a couple of top 10 Country hits with another on the charts as we spoke, and that they had a 40-city tour coming up, opening to George Strait, and that Alan (remember Alan?) had quit the band AGAIN! And, just to add to this weird non-coincidence, I need to point out that Alan had quit on my birthday! And now Michael wanted to know if I would be interested in taking his place.\n\nAre you kidding me?!?!?!\n\nPlease understand here that there was absolutely NO WAY that I could have made that happen, other than through connection with God, allowing It to supply the “how” for my “what”. This is the “why” behind “Let go and let God.”\n\nSo, that’s how I moved to Nashville, for work and with work, and had my life transformed, just as I had been praying for. And if that’s not a clear demonstration of the power of intention, then I don’t know what is.\n\nThe rest of my life’s chapters to date have unfolded as a direct result of that one, fateful phone call. In another bizarre set of non-coincidences, I met Joanne — now my second ex-wife — through my involvement with Baillie & the Boys. She’s not only the mother of my two wonderful daughters — who are the greatest joy in my life — she’s also the one who introduced me to this spiritual community.\n\nSo, in closing, I’d like to acknowledge the various angels at work in this story. (You know, they come disguised as all kinds of people in your life.)\n\nThe first angel acknowledgement goes to Joanne, through whom I have been given so much … and have learned so much … even when, at certain times, I didn’t like the lesson, the classroom setting or the teacher very much. Still, it was all perfect. Thank you, Joanne, for everything.\n\nThe second angel in this story is Alan who, to this day, I have never met. Yet the space that he vacated … TWICE … was the very space I needed to occupy in this life. Thank you, Alan, for being a quitter. 🙂\n\nLastly, and mostly, I’d like to acknowledge my dear old and lasting friends, the angels Kathie Baillie and Michael Bonagura, for taking care of me by weaving my life into theirs. For that, I can’t thank them enough."
