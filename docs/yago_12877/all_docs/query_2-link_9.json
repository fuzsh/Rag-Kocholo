        "text": "Sunday, March 10, 1:00 p.m. | Young pianist virtuoso Jennifer is bound and determined to win the world famous Queen Elisabeth Competition in Brussels, arriving at \"the Chapel\" - an intensive, isolated retreat - with no interest in making friends with her fellow residents. With a childhood marked by trauma, Jennifer is solitary and serious, and the strict rules of the Chapel (no phones, computers, or television), along with the pressure of the looming competition and the friendly - if prying - questions from the other musicians begin to take their toll. As Jennifer practices her craft, memories of her demanding mother and loving but troubled father begin to surface. In Dominique Deruddere's effective and controlled drama, it is the things that we value—family, passion, and grit—that haunt us the most.\n\nAwards & Nominations\n\nNominee - Best Film, Shanghai International Film Festival\n\nChicago European Union Film Festival - Spotlight on Belgium: Join us this year as we dive into the best of Belgian cinema new and old.
