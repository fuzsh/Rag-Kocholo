        "text": "In EVERYBODY’S FAMOUS!, a comedy from Belgium, a father’s love for his child drives him to do a desperate illegal act. Eventually, however, his love shines through to redeem everything in the end.\n\nJean, a factory worker, really believes in his chubby daughter Marva’s singing talent, but she lacks confidence when she enters the singing competitions he sets up for her because of her looks. It’s clear, however, that Marva does have talent, especially when she sings in a small local puppet show for children. Of course, no one can render any false judgments about Marva’s looks at the puppet show, because she’s hidden behind the set so that she can manipulate the little hand puppets. A frustrated composer himself, Jean watches Debbie, a pop singer, on television and dreams of success, but Marva is getting tired of his obsession with her nonexistent singing career. She’s so upset with him that she doesn’t want to hear how Jean misses the kiss that his father used to give him as a little boy when he went to bed, or the cross that Jean’s father used to make on little Jean’s forehead with his fingers. Marva doesn’t understand that Jean doesn’t want his daughter to be condemned to a menial job in a factory like he is. Marva also doesn’t know that Jean secretly listens to her sing at the puppet shows.\n\nWhen the factory bosses close down the factory because of bankruptcy, Jean tells his only friend Willy, a young man, not to tell his girlfriend and he won’t tell his wife. “I’ll think of something,” Jean tells Willy. “Something will turn up.” Jean pretends he goes to work every day, but instead, he spends his days working on the new song he hopes can earn some money. It costs a lot of money to make a demo record, however, and the worrying has forced Jean to take sleeping pills to get to sleep.\n\nOne day, Jean’s car breaks down. Who should stop to help him out but Debbie, the pop star, who’s riding her bike in her bicycle clothes, without the famous blue wig she wears on TV in her latest video. Jean drugs Debbie and invents a crazy kidnapping scheme, asking Willy to go along with it. Willy reluctantly agrees, and they anonymously rent a secluded cabin, but Willy and Debbie start to bond while Jean is away. When Debbie starts to cry about the pet dog in her apartment, sympathetic Willy goes to her home to get it. What Willy doesn’t know is that Jean has not requested ransom money from Debbie’s manager, Michael. He wants Michael to do a record of the song Jean has hummed on a little mini recorder and use Marva to do it. Michael doesn’t know that Marva is Jean’s daughter, but Jean doesn’t know that Michael is hatching a scheme of his own which will make everybody famous. Finally, nobody knows what seems to be happening between Debbie and Willy.\n\nEVERYBODY’S FAMOUS! is a very entertaining comedy that’s full of surprises. The writer and director, Dominique Deruddere, successfully manages to make viewers sympathize with Jean, despite the desperate illegal measures he takes to help his daughter.\n\nAlthough there are some ironic twists to the ending, the allusion to the kiss and the cross that Jean’s father used to give him is a redemptive allusion to God the father and the Cross that His Son, Jesus Christ, bore for our sins. This allusion to God’s love comes into play at the end of the movie, when Marva finally realizes the strong love that her biological father feels for her. Regrettably, however, the movie’s redemptive worldview is spoiled by some foul language, brief nudity and two sexual situations."
