        "text": "A lot has been written about Rakesh Omprakash Mehra’s film, Fanney Khan, which features Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Anil Kapoor. The film is said to be a remake of Everybody’s Famous which was directed in English and Dutch by Dominique Deruddere.\n\nThere was a lot of buzz about who would be cast opposite Aishwarya. It was reported that Rajkummar Rao and Vicky Kaushal were considered for the role. However, finally, Madhavan has reportedly been signed on for the lead.\n\nThe team has been busy completing the pre-production works and the film will go on the floors on September 3. A source says, “The major portion of the film will be shot in Mumbai where the set has been erected. Anil will have a unique look and we are about to begin the shoot of this film.”"
