        "text": "The release of Barfly brought the work of the boozy guru of gutter-level literature, Charles Bukowski, very close to the mainstream. A movie with bona fide Hollywood stars will do that for you. As it happens, Barfly was one of the unexpected delights of 1987, and Bukowski’s original screenplay had everything to do with that; despite the odor of unwashed bodies and stale whiskey, it was comic and entirely classical.\n\nI’m not sure this qualifies as a vogue, but another film based on Bukowski’s writings has arrived. This time, the writer has had nothing to do with the making of the movie. Love Is a Dog from Hell is based on Bukowski’s stories, as adapted by Belgian director Dominique Deruddere.\n\nThe movie is divided into three distinct sections, which describe the life of a single character. The first section, set in 1955, might be titled My Life as a Dog from Hell, since it recalls My Life as a Dog in its telling of a little boy’s discovery of sex and disillusionment. This time, however, 12-year-old Harry (Geert Hunaerts), who cherishes romantic notions about love learned from the movies, finds an unhappy conclusion to his questions about sex.\n\nThe second episode skips to 1962. Harry (Josse De Pauw) is graduating from high school, but he is still on the outside, this time because of the terrible acne that renders his face a field of lava. Here we see Harry’s early attempts at poetry, his first scuffle on the wrong side of the law, and a remarkable scene in which he wraps his awful face in toilet paper and waltzes with an adored classmate at a graduation dance.\n\nThe final section, set in 1976, is the blackest of all, in which Harry, now a barfly, and a drunken friend steal a corpse and use it in some unmentionable ways. It is the bleakest segment but a necessary one, in that it completes the movie’s bizarre cycle of romance (the actress who “plays” the corpse is the same actress who plays the princess in 12-year-old Harry’s idealized movie).\n\nUnlike Barfly, Love Is a Dog from Hell isn’t an immediately likable movie, and is decidedly an acquired taste (it drew some hisses at a preview screening). I admired it for its utter lack of compromise, and for the fact that its young director, Deruddere, is obviously a talent; he is excellent with the actors and achieves some eerily effective night photography. He manages to make this movie live up – or down – to its title.\n\nFirst published in The Herald, July 22, 1988\n\nIMDb has the title as Crazy Love – nice try. I forgot about the hisses at the preview screening (and it was likely a critics-only screening, too), but you play around with necrophilia, you take your chances. The movie launched the career of its director, and Deruddere’s next shot was an English-language adaptation of John Fante’s Wait Until Spring, Bandini (Coppola had a hand in producing). His 2001 film Everybody’s Famous! was Oscar-nominated for Best Foreign Language Film. According to IMDb, the boy who played the young Harry, Geert Hunaerts, has been on a Belgian TV show since 2007, racking up over 1400 episodes."
