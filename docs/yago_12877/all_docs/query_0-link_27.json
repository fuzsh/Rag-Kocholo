        "text": "In the Belgian film Everybody's Famous from 2000, Josse De Pauw plays Jean Vereecken, a factory worker with a love for music, specifically popstar Debbie, played by The Voice finalist Eva van der Gucht. Jean's wife, Marva, played by Thekla Reuten, owns a small snack stand and together, they live with Jean's daughter, Marva's son and Marva's father who suffers from a stroke.\n\nAfter Jean loses his job at the factory, he decides to take matters into his own hands in order to help his daughter's singing career take off. He kidnaps Debbie, his daughter's favorite popstar, with the help of his friend, Willy, played by Werner De Smedt.\n\nFrom there, the film takes a wild turn as Jean tries to negotiate his daughter's singing career with Debbie's record label. Meanwhile, Debbie, who is recovering from a failed relationship, starts to bond with her captors and even begins to help her captors' family out in small ways.\n\nAs the story progresses, the lines between captor and captive start to blur and Jean starts to question whether he has gone too far in his pursuit of fame for his daughter.\n\nThe film creates a charming atmosphere, punctuated by bittersweet moments of Jean's struggle to survive in a difficult economic climate while also seeking to make his daughter's dreams come true. At the same time, the film also brings to the forefront the power dynamics between celebrities and their fans, and the lengths people will go to get what they want.\n\nWith a strong cast and clever storytelling, Everybody's Famous manages to be both heartwarming and thought-provoking. Its exploration of the lengths people will go to for the ones they love, paired with a cast of unique and well-rounded characters, make it a standout film that is both moving and entertaining.\n\nEverybody's Famous is a 2000 comedy with a runtime of 1 hour and 37 minutes. It has received moderate reviews from critics and viewers, who have given it an IMDb score of 6.9 and a MetaScore of 60."
