What are the reasons for this success?\n\nBK: This is something that we have been talking a lot about lately and trying to analyse it. And I think that one of the reasons is, that these new filmmakers love cinema, they love film. We are a small industry with micro-low budgets, but still we are making such successful films. It’s really about loving and being dedicated to our work, as well as having a good education and talent. Looking back 2-3 years and having 6-7 films directed by female directors from Kosovo at A-festivals, as well as some films by male directors, it is just amazing. That’s why I think that love and passion are the reasons for our success.\n\nHow would you describe the situation for the filmmakers in Kosovo?\n\nBK: It has been a very important decade, this last one, because after having changed the board and the head of the film centre, we made many steps forward. (NB: EAVE graduate) Arben Zharku as Director of the Kosovo Cinematography Centre has introduced a scheme to support co-productions, which we didn’t have before. He also introduced a support scheme for education, so that our filmmakers could start attending workshops abroad, like EAVE, which I could attend in 2017 due to this support, and also MAIA Workshops, FAMU, etc. I think this was the biggest step in our education. This has helped the knowledge of filmmaking and the talent from Kosovo to rise very fast. But on the other hand we are facing a bad situation in the industry. With the success we had, we should be able to raise the number of co-productions, but we don’t have tax incentives or a cinema network, which is the biggest challenge we have. What keeps us going is the love and passion of our directors, and the support of our film centre, but eventually people would also need some stability. We need a lot of investment from the government and the attention from the parliament, so it would be important to work on the tax incentives law.\n\nHow do you manage to finance films in Kosovo?\n\nBK: Our main financier is the Kosovo Cinematography Centre. We also have some smaller financing sources such as municipalities and private sources. Due to Kosovo’s political situation, not being recognised by 6 EU countries, Kosovo is not part of Eurimages and MEDIA Programme, which creates many challenges for us. But we co-produce a lot on the regional level; we have minority co-productions with Albania, North Macedonia and Montenegro. Co-productions between Kosovo and North Macedonia are very usual. When you get funding in Kosovo, it’s quite usual to get it in Albania and North Macedonia.\n\nVB: We are very creative how we finance our films. Kosovo has only 3 co-production treaties with North Macedonia, Albania and Turkey, which was ratified only a month ago. Our project Hive is the first official co-production with Switzerland (NB: with EAVE+ graduate Britta Rindelaub). We have managed to do this through two other partners who are part of the European Cultural Convention, and therefore we could be part of the official co-production as a third partner.\n\nDo you think you will have more co-productions with Switzerland, or Germany?\n\nVB: Actually, we did a co-production with Germany last year with Exile by Visar Morina. The film premiered at Sundance and was shown in the Panorama section of last year’s Berlinale. The co-production with Germany was difficult mostly due to the German policy of how to spend money for a co-production. It was a bit easier with Switzerland because they have a different policy. Also, there is a diaspora from Kosovo in Switzerland, so a lot of actors and crew members could be counted as Swiss expenses. On the project Hive the Swiss TV has joined as a co-producer. We are now shooting our new project with Switzerland, The Land Within Me by Fisnik Maxhuni, which will be shot in Kosovo. So now a co-production between Kosovo and Switzerland has started to be more common, because of the workflow and the diaspora. The market potential in Switzerland is also much bigger than in Kosovo.\n\nHIVE © Ikone-Studio, Industria Film, Alva Film Production, photo: Alex Bloom\n\nHow is it to co-produce with Germany?\n\nVB: The market is almost the same, but it’s difficult to co-produce with Germany. It’s hard because we are not part of the European Cultural Convention, so we have to find other ways. In Germany, you can apply for regional film funds and our German co-producer will apply for one of our projects, but you have to have TV involved. We have different problems from our European colleagues, but one of the sentences of my professor is that for the Balkan producers the following applies: “Give me a problem and I’ll find you a solution”.\n\nWhich role does EAVE play for you in Kosovo?\n\nVB: For me EAVE has opened my eyes to be able to co-produce with Europe and helped me to understand the opportunities of working with European partners. Normally we are co-producing with our region, and at EAVE I learned the ways and the possibilities of how to co-produce with other European countries. At EAVE we have been developing our project Silence of Sirens and we have learned how important it is to focus on the development of the project. We understood how important it is to go to a workshop and to work with a scrip consultant, and within your group you can open your project to an international audience, your B2B audience. Working with my EAVE group has opened many doors and opportunities, and I have now different tools in my hands to be a better producer.\n\nI participated at EAVE thanks to a scholarship funded by the German regional fund MDM (Mitteldeutsche Medienförderung). The generous financial contribution of MDM to my participation has provided me the occasion to be part of this program, without which I couldn’t have access to. Continuation of this fund will enable future producers like me to become part of the European film producing community.\n\nOn my new project that I’m co-producing we’ve had different difficulties in the financing and pre-production phase, but this time I could call my EAVE colleagues and my group leader and the other group leaders to ask them for advice. Their support is my new tool, especially since I’m coming from such a small market. We have now signed the contract with a sales agent – an opportunity we didn’t have before. I called my group leader Diana Elbaum and she advised me what to do and explained what I need to be careful about when signing an agreement with a sales agent. She really helped me. I think that being part of EAVE is like being a part of a big family. When you need some advice, you can call someone who will listen to you and give you a good advice, and this makes me as a producer much more confident when going to the market. Now I have EAVE tools and I’m using them, so EAVE has really helped me a lot. It also helped my project a lot because it has put my project on a map. Now I can work with different sales agents and distributors. And EAVE has put me as a producer on a map as well. It gave me the backup of having experienced producers as colleagues who are there when I need some advice.\n\nWhat do you say Besnik? What role has EAVE played for you?\n\nBK: I agree with what Valon has said. Workshops like EAVE are very important for producers coming from such a small industry as Kosovo, because we can get a lot of knowledge. Besides that, you become a part of the EAVE network, and as a producer you need a network. Most beautiful thing in EAVE is, because they have a very tough selection, that you are selected among 50 producers who become a part of your network. As I was saying, the most important thing is the network - the people that EAVE chooses and their collaboration. As Valon said, you can call your EAVE colleagues anytime.\n\nLOOKING FOR VENERA © Circle Production\n\nWhich challenges did your films have to face during the process from the idea to being shown in Rotterdam or Sundance? Which steps did you have to take with your films?\n\nBK: I think the challenges and the struggles are the same for all filmmakers from Kosovo. The most difficult thing is to finance films. You can find yourself delivering DCP with a huge gap in financing. We would need to invest in Kosovo, so we don’t have to spend the most of our energy on financing films. Now the film industry knows that Kosovo has potential because of the success we had recently. But as I mentioned before, we don’t have treaties with many other countries, so if you want to co-produce, you are still facing troubles all the time. Of course, we are trying to make every stage of the production as everyone else does; we develop an idea into a script, hire a script consultant... but our struggle with the financing is the biggest issue in our productions.\n\nComing back to your films with women fighting for their rights in a patriarchal society, which is the topic of both of your films. Is this especially relevant in Kosovo and the Balkans? Why do you think is this topic very successful at the moment?\n\nBK: There are a lot of productions that are dealing with the patriarchal topic. But in Looking For Venera, I don’t know if it’s exactly the patriarchal thing or it’s more life heritage, because it’s a thin line here. In some Kosovo families young people live the same way as their grandparents did who are 70 years old. Because there is some kind of moral code in a family, and you keep doing it. So sometimes it’s not a patriarchal thing, but some kind of life heritage, which we always have at the back of our head. It’s a topic in many productions, and it’s part of Balkan lifestyle and history.\n\nVB: To be honest, in the past ten years all the good films that had success and that were recognised on the festivals and the international market, were made by women directors. And I’m very proud of that. Actually, they are better linked and they are fighting against the fact that they are not recognised by men as equals in our society. And I find that very inspiring for everyone.\n\nBack to top\n\nEAVE project GHOSTDANCE supported by Film Fund Luxembourg\n\nWallonia-Brussels Federation Film Centre\n\nThe Wallonia-Brussels Federation Film Centre grants writing, development or production support to short films, feature films, creative documentaries and experimental films.

The „complex coming-of-age drama and a very modern love story” tells the story of a 21-year-old college student who navigates a series of relationships that force her to confront her own vulnerabilities for the first time. Frances is observant, cerebral and sharp. Her ex-girlfriend, now best friend, Bobbi, is self-assured, outspoken and compelling. Though they broke up three years ago, Frances and Bobbi are virtually inseparable and perform spoken-word poetry together in Dublin. It’s at one of their shows that they meet Melissa, an older writer, who is fascinated by the pair. Bobbi and Frances start to spend time with Melissa and her husband, Nick, a handsome but reserved actor. While Melissa and Bobbi flirt with each other openly, Nick and Frances embark on an intense, secret affair that is surprising to them both. Soon, the affair begins to test the bond between Frances and Bobbi, forcing Frances to reconsider her sense of self and the friendship she holds so dear. Principal photography will commence later this year in Dublin, Belfast and other locations yet to be confirmed. CONVERSATIONS WITH FRIENDS is being produced by Jeanie Igoe. Sally Rooney is the executive producer along with Ed Guiney, Emma Norton and Andrew Lowe for Ireland’s Element Pictures, Rose Garnett and Tommy Bulfin for the BBC, and Abrahamson.\n\nwww.elementpictures.ie\n\nThe German Film Funding Agency FFA supports the production of 9 films and 10 scripts, among them NACHBARS GARTEN by Johanna Bentz, producer: EAVE graduate Arek Gielnik.\n\nwww.ffa.de\n\nDIE DORFSTRAßE by Andreas Goldstein, producer: EAVE graduate Heino Deckert receives development support by the German-Polish Film Fund, the German Film Funding Agency FFA, Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg, MDM.

The main topics tackled by this feature are immigration and the welcome offered to refugees, but it will also prompt reflection on how difficult it is to connect with others and how relating to other people can be a clumsy affair – especially if they are different, but also when it’s those who are closest to us. Above all, it’s the story of a friendship, and of how an unknown and seemingly strange individual can leave an indelible mark on us. VASIL is a Distinto Films (Spain) and Activist 38 (Bulgaria) production. It secured backing from the ICAA, the Valencian Cultural Institute, the Catalan Institute of Cultural Companies and the Creative Europe – MEDIA programme. It boasts the involvement of RTVE and Televisió de Catalunya.\n\nwww.activist38.com\n\nWAKE ME by Marko Santic, producer: EAVE group leader Danijel Hocevar is shooting.

While trying to protect his younger brother Jure from bad company and influences, he is forced to face his former life again. The 32-days shooting will take place in Slovenian towns of Jesenice, Bled, Kamnik and Ljubljana. WAKE ME is produced by Danijel Hocevar and Zala Opara through Vertigo in co-production with Living Pictures (Serbia), Jaka Produkcija (Croatia) and Hippocampe Productions (France). The film is supported by the Slovenian Film Centre, the Croatian Audiovisual Centre (HAVC), Film Center Serbia, Eurimages, MEDIA – Creative Europe and Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique – SACEM; with in-kind support from FS Viba film studio.\n\nhttp://www.vertigo.si\n\nBOWLING SATURNE by Arieh Worthalter, producer: EAVE group leader Patrick Sobelman is shooting. The story focuses on Guillaume, a police chief who inherits the family bowling alley upon his father’s death. He decides to entrust its management to Armand, his spurned half-brother. But Armand’s impulsive behaviour and his improbable approach to managing the bowling alley prevent Guillaume from fully devoting himself to an investigation into a series of murders of young women which are sweeping the town… BOWLING SATURNE is produced by Patrick Sobelman on behalf of Ex Nihilo and is co-produced by Belgium’s Les Films du Fleuve. Pre-purchased by Canal+ and Ciné+, the feature film also benefits from an advance on receipts from the CNC, as well as enjoying the support of the Normandy region, of Wallimage and of the SOFICA companies Cinémage and Cinécap.\n\nwww.agatfilmsetcie.com\n\nLABOUR DAY by Mladen Djordjevic, producers: EAVE graduate and Serbian National Coordinator Milan Stojanovic, EAVE graduates Maria Drandaki and Anamaria Antoci is shooting. The plot follows a group of ex-workers from a recently closed factory, who, in their fight for personal dignity, reach out to the supernatural. “With this film, I wish to express my personal view on the painful topic of transition from a socialist into a capitalist society, but from what I believe is a fresh angle, combining socio-political realism with the elements of a psychological thriller,” says the director. The film is being produced by Milan Stojanovic for Serbia's Sense Production, Djordjevic for Serbia's Corona Film, Martichka Bozhilova for Bulgaria's Agitprop, Maria Drandaki for Greece's Homemade Films, Ivan Marinovic for Montenegro's Adriatic Western and Anamaria Antoci for Romania's Tangaj Production.

The documentary / dance film follows the choreographer and director Albertina Pisano and her company Tora Dance Theatre in her artistic journey in Dakar, Senegal, through the creation of her new piece Ndaje, an encounter between Flamenco and Senegalese Dance. Since the 15th century at least 10 % of the population of Andalusia was black, of sub-Saharan descent, but the official Spanish history silenced the contribution of black artists to the birth of Flamenco, an art form born out of the musical, commercial and cultural exchange between Spain, Africa and south America. Albertina's work creates a new choreographic language, composed of several dance pieces, born out of an in-depth artistic research around the black memory as it emerges in the bodies. Each dance piece is created by a contamination of the movement vocabularies of flamenco, contemporary and traditional African dance, hip-hop, and the rhythms of Westafrican musical instruments (kora, balafon, and percussions). The dance scenes – set in Dakar National Theatre – are alternated with the musicians’ lives in the outskirts of Dakar.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ERQqG0p2NQw\n\nSON by Ivan Kavanagh, producer: EAVE graduate Anne Marie Naughton is ready for release. The horror film follows Laura, a mother who, after escaping from a cult as a child, must face her past when its sinister members break into her home and attempt to steal her eight-year-old son, David. Now the two are on the run, pursued by Paul, a detective determined to save them both. Since his aborted kidnapping, something has changed in David, and the boy has succumbed to a mysterious illness. Following her maternal instincts to save him, his mother commits unspeakable acts to keep him alive but is losing the battle. Soon, she has to decide how far she is willing to go to save her son. SON was produced by for Ireland’s Park Films, Louis Tisné for the UK’s Elastic and René Bastian for US outfit Belladonna Productions, in association with Golden Ratio (Singapore), Blisspoint Entertainment (Singapore), Quickfire Films (UK) and Eyevox Entertainment (USA).

Thanks to this partnership, the users of the ToolBox will be able to access exclusive content starting from today, the 11th of February.\n\nEAVE is an established professional training, project development and networking organization for audio-visual producers. The professional resources developed for its main yearly-workshop and for its programme Ties That Bind, specifically designed to assist co-productions between Asia and Europe, will be now exceptionally available to the ToolBox members for a limited period of time.\n\nI am delighted that EAVE is generously joining forces with us on the ToolBox initiative, stressing the collaborative approach we’re having with this professional web platform placed under the sign of sharing, inspiration and networking.\n\nSophie Bourdon, Head of Open Doors\n\n\"We are very happy to contribute to the Open Doors ToolBox, a partnership which is perfectly in line with EAVE’s mission to have an impact beyond our core workshop programs and to reach out to a wider group of professionals worldwide, offering access to tools and expertise. We believe that the support of independent voices, creative imagination and culturally driven companies within the global media industries is an urgent necessity in the 21st century. Through our work we aim to contribute towards the creation of strong networks of producers and to encourage the exchange of knowledge and skills which will strengthen independent production across the world.\"\n\nKristina Trapp, Chief Executive of EAVE\n\nSince its launch in summer 2020, about 600 filmmakers and producers from Open Doors’ Asian regions in focus have become regular members of the ToolBox, benefiting of the free knowledge shared by industry members and other professionals.\n\nAs part of the new content available, the recording of the pitching training session at EAVE’s yearly professional workshop will be followed by additional material on pitching by expert Sibylle Kurz as well as ad-hoc resources by the Open Doors Team, and by more EAVE-signed releases through 2021.\n\nEach item will be available on demand for a 30-day period, exclusively for the registered members of the ToolBox.\n\nThis collaboration brings new perspectives to our members and allows them to discover materials, learn techniques of filmmaking and production that they would not be able to access otherwise, given the current resources available in their home countries. I’m delighted that the ToolBox’s first collaboration starts with EAVE – Ties That Bind, a prestigious and well-established initiative with an incredible history of graduated producers and alumni. With this partnership, the ToolBox makes a big step toward its goal to become a unique and free platform for isolated filmmakers in our focused territories.\n\nZsuzsi Bánkuti, Open Doors Community Coordinator\n\nWe invite you to fully discover the ToolBox and all the useful resources that we are constantly publishing, and to get the chance to meet other registered professionals!\n\nAccess the ToolBox\n\nOpen Doors is made possible by the collaboration of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation SDC of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nBack to top\n\nEAVE THINK TANK 2020 – MOVING AHEAD IN FILM FUNDING\n\nAn important part of EAVE's mission is thinking the future of the film industry that takes in account the current and upcoming shifts. We believe in a more integrated and fluid audio-visual ecosystem where the creativity and the audience are closer and in the power of collective thinking. Throughout the different programmes and get-togethers along the year, we are inviting professionals to design the future of their trade; a key cornerstone of this endeavour is the EAVE Impact Think Tank.\n\nEAVE Impact Think Tank 2020: MOVING AHEAD IN FILM FINANCING\n\nThe first round involving a group of 20 professionals took place in January 2020, in Trieste, Italy in cooperation with The Film Agency and When East Meets West. The group used specially tailored design-thinking exercises which allowed the professionals to identify and spot visually the barriers and challenges of our current industry, but also the opportunities coming ahead.\n\nIn August 2020, a smaller group of 9 professionals re-evaluated the 30 solutions proposed in January and came up with a shortlist of five initiatives – also based on the direct effects of the pandemic.\n\nThese five initiatives have been then surveyed online by 150 members of the EAVE network in November 2020.\n\nRead more on Screen Daily\n\nDownload here the wrap-up document by The Film Agency to discover the thinking process & methodology and the five key initiatives:\n\nIntegrate independent cinemas\n\nEncourage more integrated model of the arthouse sector including production, distribution and exhibition within the same company.\n\nBoost European talent\n\nSuggest the creation of a pan-European talent agency that gives fundamental importance to talent management and career development; securing IP and spearheading early development and packaging of content; all working together in an integrated way.\n\nEmpower companies\n\nShift the focus from project financing to company financing across Europe in local, regional, national and Pan-EU funding. Also add in new compulsory funding from the streamers.\n\nHarness the power of data\n\nStrengthening and modernizing the European industry’s approach to data, via the European Audiovisual Observatory and/or other research groups, analytics companies, think tanks or universities.\n\nSpearhead 2025 agenda\n\nEAVE suggests crafting an agenda of 10 points like the above-mentioned initiatives that can significantly foster innovation in the film industry by 2025; a team of 10-20 experts will manage this agenda.\n\nThe results were first unveiled on January 28 at the online When East Meets West 2021, to a closed audience that included invited funders and broadcasters such as HBO Europe, Eurimages, Creative Europe, BFI, RAI, Austrian Film Institute, Danish Film Institute, ZDF/Arte and more.\n\nBack to top\n\nDanish IB Prize for EAVE Head of Studies Lise Lense-Møller\n\nWe are immensly proud to announce that EAVE Head of Studies Lise Lense-Møller has been awarded by the Danske Filminstruktører (Danish Film Directors) Denmark's only producer award during the Film Academy's Robert 2021!\n\nThe IB Prize is awarded to daring, innovative, risky, anarchist contractors without anxiety about becoming unpopular and above all with a big beating heart for movies and the whole deadly bunch that necessitates the film's presentation.\n\nThank you, Lise, for bringing that same passion, dedication, and inspiration to EAVE!\n\nAs it says in the motivation statement:\n\n\"At Danske Filminstruktører, we want to continue to state with the award that the best films are created in the sparks from an inspiring and productive producer-director collaboration.\n\nAnd when you ask some of the directors who work closely with you Lise, it is especially your good cooperation with and respect for the director that they highlight, along with your insistence on sticking to the film as a work of art.\n\nYou are deeply dedicated, efficient without equal, analytically sharp and never compromise on the cinematic.
