        "text": "Fanney Khan, directed by debutant Atul Manjrekar will reportedly see Madhavan R and Aishwarya team up as a couple for the first time. The film which is a remake of Dominique Deruddere's 2000 Dutch film Everybody's Famous, is supposed to be the story of a 17-year-old aspiring singer, whose career takes off once her unemployed father kidnaps a top singer. The two have earlier worked together in Mani Ratnam's film Guru but their on-screen relationship was not a romantic one.\n\nApparently, there were reports that actors Rajkummar Rao, Vicky Kaushal and Vivek Oberoi's cousin Akshay Oberoi were approached for the same role, but things didn't materialise. The film also sees Anil Kapoor and Aishwarya Rai coming together on-screen after 17 long years. They had worked together earlier on Satish Kaushik's 2000 film Humara Dil Aapke Pass Hai.\n\nThis film, which supposedly raises voice against body shaming, might feature a plus-sized girl as Anil Kapoor's daughter. It is believed that Aishwarya Rai will portray the role of a successful female rockstar, who inspires Kapoor's daughter. She guides the teenager and tells her not to worry about her weight and instead just go on with her life. Fanney Khan will be bankrolled by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra and KriArj Entertainment. Set to go on floors in early September the film will release in April 2018."
