        "text": "As we are turning the pages from old to new, I thought of writing one of those old-school blog posts, more for the fun of writing it – and hopefully you reading it – rather than trying to make a point or breakthrough. Although pages, pointed pencils, and breaking through are definitely topics in these reflections about The Scaffold being a wormhole. Hope you enjoy this rabbit hole.\n\nA brain worm in my head is obsessing about wormholes being an excellent metaphor or not for bending cognitive spaces to our own particular navigational needs.\n\nAn ear worm or brain worm is usually defined as a “catchy or memorable piece of music or saying that continuously occupies a person’s mind even after it is no longer being played or spoken about.”.\n\nUnfortunately, in slang, it means “a persistent delusion or obsession; a deeply-ingrained or unquestioned idea”.\n\nI leave it to my readers to assess whether my thoughts belong to the former or the latter.\n\nThe wormhole metaphor popped up during one of my catch-up calls with partners in crime about The Scaffold, our transdisciplinary learning studio for the never-normal.\n\nThe Scaffold is a wormhole, an unorthodox way of going faster from A to B.\n\nHere is where Dr Romilly explains about the wormhole to Cooper in the film Interstellar:\n\nI love the paper sheet and pencil metaphor to suggest this alternative route towards your imaginable futures.\n\nEasier said than done: if The Scaffold is indeed a wormhole, what do we need in place to create the wormhole? What is the nature of the plane being folded?\n\nThe plane could be looked at as the social fabric for thinking together, thinking in synch. It is another tool or system to facilitate coordinated behaviour. The plane becomes a graph-mind, as explained in Venkat Rao’s Graph-Mind-Notebook series.\n\nPunching the right line through the plane is difficult, and comes with great responsibility, and only few people can do this. These punchers are usually born like this, and often not welcome or seen as inappropriate in corporate environments.\n\nIt takes a huge effort to instigate experiences that break away from the normal. Humans are hardwired to believe what they hear/already know. Their brains are wired to look for mirror neurons, and this not only at the cognitive cortex, but also at the motor cortex, visual cortex, other cortexes…\n\nHow do you break away into the territory of experimental imagination, as described by Ann Pendleton in Pragmatic Imagination? You could use LSD trips to create experiences that are as strong as giving birth to a baby. Seriously, how to make the hole is a very serious proposition.\n\nYou have to first identify the consistency of assumptions of the plane, then have different strategies for drilling the hole, and a list of tools to drill the hole.\n\nI always thought – and still do – that using artists is a natural human way to resonate beyond the cognitive, textual level. Artists – not as entertainment, but as prime contributors to the content and the narrative – can bring us in a state of different reality.\n\nIt is about human presence in multiple realities, in form ànd feeling, in space ànd time. It resembles to dance, or rather choreography.\n\n“Dance/choreography is dancing of the second order, meta-dancing, or better, it is an investigation of dancing.”\n\nAlva Noe in his book The Entanglement\n\n“We will soon live life across multiple realities. Each with its own physical laws, bodies & affordances. The only common denominators? Space, time and human presence.”\n\nAndreea Ion Cojocaru\n\nHow to make holes is also a matter of nuance, of deciding how much dissonance you want, you can have, what’s beyond your comfort zone, although we know from Niels Pflaeging that there is no such thing as a comfort zone.\n\nImagine a dial/slider of dissonance\n\nWho turns the dial? Who is the orchestrator/composer/juggler of place, space, and time? Who is the mapper/weaver of ideas? Who curates the team of transdisciplinarians in a coherent impactful learning experience?\n\nThis is about going through walls.\n\nIt remembers me of Geoff Manaugh’s blog about Nakatomi Space where he described Bruce Willis’ Die Hard experience to literally going through walls\n\nWhat I find so interesting about Die Hard—in addition to unironically enjoying the film—is that it cinematically depicts what it means to bend space to your own particular navigational needs.\n\nThis mutational exploration of architecture even supplies the building’s narrative premise: the terrorists are there for no other reason than to drill through and rob the Nakatomi Corporation’s electromagnetically sealed vault.\n\nDie Hard asks naive but powerful questions: If you have to get from A to B—that is, from the 31st floor to the lobby, or from the 26th floor to the roof—why not blast, carve, shoot, lockpick, and climb your way there, hitchhiking rides atop elevator cars and meandering through the labyrinthine, previously unexposed back-corridors of the built environment?\n\nGeoff Manaugh\n\nThe Scaffold as a wormhole is about going through previously unexposed back-corridors where all is malleable.\n\nThis will scare the hell out of many. The disclaimer deserves a warning to be prepared to be discomforted, even to expect existential angst. Such disclaimer also imposes a duty of extreme care to the designer of such experience.\n\nInterestingly, and to stay in the world of film and imagination, the quote “Innovate or die” is sometimes attributed to Robert Iger, the CEO of the Walt Disney Company.\n\nIn that sense, the title of this blog post could as well have been\n\n“Die Hard and Innovate”\n\nWith thanks to Andreea, Marti, JMS, Josie, and Venkat for planting these brainworms in my head.\n\nWarmest,\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I discovered by accident a way to get myself in a zen-state of total peace and relaxation. Not that I feel super hectic or nervous, or something like that. Not that I need it. Not that I was in search for it. I just stumbled upon it and I really liked it.\n\nPetervan Artwork © 2021 – 5000 Bricks – Soundscape by Petervan in Logic Pro\n\nIt is the very simple – highly repetitive – practice of drawing many many little bricks, black ink on white paper. I am doing this when I am completely alone in my studio, with some repetitive music in the background (see later), and the sound of a ticking clock.\n\nThe only other things I hear/notice is the sound of the pen softly scratching the paper, the sound of my breath, a motorcycle or car or plane passing by in a soft distance, a door opening/closing somewhere in the house, sometimes a dog barking, or a dove crying.\n\nI am old enough to remember reading somewhere in the eighties Robert Pirsig’s “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance” from 1974.\n\n“As in Zen, the trick is to become one with the activity, to engage in it fully, to see and appreciate all details–be it hiking in the woods, penning an essay, or tightening the chain on a motorcycle.”\n\nIt made me think about the repetive art of Roman Opalka who spent a big part of his life drawing numbers from one to infinity.\n\nRoman Opalka by Lothar Wolleh – Sep 2002\n\nBut I don’t talk nor record my words while drawing my bricks. I am silent. And listen to repetitive soundscapes. I was looking for some “non-intrusive music”, music without meaning, music without noise, something that did not distract from the content (aka the bricks), but was rather amplifying it. I tried several ambients from Brian Eno, or songs from Robert Frip’s Music for Quiet Moments series and many more.\n\nUntil I discovered this AI-auto-generated music library by @alex_bainter.\n\nThe “song” that I have used most so far is called “Lullaby”.\n\nCheck it out at: https://play.generative.fm/library\n\nAnn Pendleton-Jullian pointed me in the direction of Lu Qing’s work. Ly Qing is the spouse of Ai Weiwei, but she is always in background, not looking for press attention. When browsing her work, I stumbled upon this repetitive work, acrylic blocks on a silk roll of about 20 meters long and 83 cm wide.\n\nM+ Sigg Collection, Hong Kong. By donation, © Lu Qing\n\nThis ink painting on a bolt of silk is partially unrolled and drapes over a table. Small dark-grey squares in acrylic paint almost fill the fabric and create a grid. Departing from her early abstract oil paintings, beginning in 2000, Lu Qing has painted on a twenty-five-metre bolt of silk that she buys each year. Small geometric shapes are painstakingly painted on the fabric over the course of the year. Regardless of how much of the cloth is painted, Lu considers the painting complete at the end of the year and begins with a new bolt the next year. The varying shades of dark grey in the work indicate changes in Lu’s emotional state and in the pressure she exerted, and also recall the different shades of black in traditional Chinese painting. The work is a meditative practice in which the process is valued over the end product, and it functions as an abstract record of emotion and time. (from https://collections.mplus.org.hk/en/objects/untitled-2012687)\n\nI ran to my attic, found a roll of cheap white paper of 1 meter wide and 5 meter long, and started drawing. What you see in the video above are the first 5,000 bricks of a “long” work.\n\nJosie Gibson from The Catalyst Network pointed out that my work was multilayered, with the layers being Peace, Mind Wandering, Kairos, Repetitive work, Musical memory anchors.\n\nIn my opinion, it also has layers of different types of attention.\n\nAttention to the drawing itself: getting the pattern right, working without no or a minimum of grid/supporting lines, drawing “perfect” bricks, made in one line-flow, for each of them.\n\nAttention to the mind-wandering: making small (at times only mental) notes, reflections about a project, my daughter, my spouse etc.\n\nIt’s useless, I know. But it brings me in contact with an unexplored part of myself. It brings me in a Zen state, a state of deep calm and happiness. I am literately and metaphorically losing my time, my-self. Or am I re-finding my-self?\n\nDoing something. Doing the work. Getting lost. In time and space that is. Being one with my practice: it is more important than end product.\n\nWarmest,\n\nIn the aftermath of the Scientology trial in Brussels last month, senior representatives of the six Belgian governments have initiated exploratory talks with Scientology to assess the creation of a blockchain-based venture for the relationship economy.\n\nIn a joint press release, they announced today the launch of DAG (“Digital Asset Goldings”), a new blockchain consortium headed by Bitalik Vuterin. The project uses a brand new fork of the blockchain protocol called “Ethereal”: a permissioned mutual distributed ledger protocol, underpinned by its own ether-cryptocurrency “Real”.\n\nDAG has been set up as a non-profit cooperative, and has already collected more that 500M USD in equity funding, rocketing it into the first blockchain unicorn in history.\n\nDAG will be governed by G4S (Governance For Securities), a governance body made of 45 major financial institutions, and several of the RegTech sandboxes, that tested the technology in Q1 of 2016.\n\nThe funding round was lead by FISH (Flanders International Securities Holdings), fully owned in open source by five of the six Belgian Governments (Brussels does not participate: as the home of the European Union, the Commission does not permit hosting regions to participate in ventures promoting non-fiat currencies).\n\nFlanders International Securities Holdings holds 51% of the shares of DAG, 29% is owned by G4S, and the remaining 20% is reserved for future crowd sourced citizen participation, based on simple bonds that will be issued in the Real open source currency on the DAG shared ledger.\n\nEthereal leverages the findings of the Digital Asset Grid project, an incubation project that was set on hold in 2012 by lack of interest and investment, probably because to novel at its time. Digital Asset Goldings will use the same principles of governance, trust, resilience and availability as the DAG-project, but the implementation is based on a brand new revolutionary protocol “Ethereal”, using modern breakthrough encryption technology based on Quasars.\n\n“With Ethereal, we have solved the scalability problem of the blockchain”, says Vuterin; “We can scale to more that 1 Trillion nodes on the grid, and all the atomic transactions can be executed in milliseconds. We can do this thanks to our quantum computer “StockGold”, mining Reals at the nanoscale and nanosecond.”\n\nQuantum Computer running StockGold\n\nAdriano Selinky – Head of BancoVentures, the investment arm of BancoBlanco and one of the 45 banks backing the project – raves: “We believe there are about 20B USD in yearly savings in direct settlement of Scientology fees: the business case was a no brainer for us, and we are eager to invest in more Ethereal-based projects and startups. DAG will revolutionize financial services, and will deeply disrupt the economic fabric of our economies. We see many more use cases, but it will take a couple of years before we will see the full impact of this.”\n\nAdriano Selinky – Head of BancoVentures\n\nThe Scientology trials will be labeled “TrustWeb” and will be led by Neil Sinner, as a competitor to his brother’s “DataWeb”. “Kris has been instrumental in setting up DataWeb, but this technology space is moving so fast that DataWeb is already an outdated technology before its first implementation. TrustWeb is just offering superior relationship experiences”\n\nThe promise of superior relationship experiences did not go unnoticed to the 6 Belgian Governments, who consider the DAG and the Ethereal G4S governance model ready to revolutionize their own move from centralized to decentralized to fully distributed peer-to-peer government.\n\nDAG will have its international headquarter in Blocke-Heist, a little town on the Belgian coast. The little town is renowned for its elite public, attracted by art galleries, fashion shops, exclusive restaurants and bars, and a vibrant nightlife.\n\nBaron Clipckens – Mayor of Blocke-Heist – was very bullish: “I was myself hit very hard during the 2008 crisis as an investor, and I am convinced that transparency and traceability of financial transactions are the best guarantee for the long- and short term savings of our citizens. We welcome all FinTech Hubs to join us in this effort, and we hope that Blocke-Heist can become the Blocke-Valley and Davos of the Relationship Economy.”\n\nTogether with Scientology, DAG has also acquired its HQ real estate in Blocke-Heist: “La Réserve”, a 3-star Michelin restaurant and conference center.\n\nLa Réserve in Blocke-Heist, Flanders, Belgium\n\nIt comes with an 18 Hole Golf course to facilitate high quality relationships and connections. Close to the seaside, this will guarantee DAG with a daily fresh supply of fish and seafood, and is ideally positioned as a high-end executive meeting and event center.\n\nDAG also attracted @petervan (one of the Co-Founders of Innotribe) as their Artistic Director. “There is indeed room to rethink the way events are organized, using more participatory Ethereal concepts that will guarantee advanced collaborative learning beyond the pure cognitive. La Réserve is an outstanding location where physical and emotional space blend into unique immersive experiences”; said Petervan.\n\n@petervan, in his black T-Shirt “SHIFT HAPPENS”, at Innotribe Sibos last year (black T-Shirts seem to be the standard uniform of Innotribe Co-Founders)\n\nDAG seems to be a marriage in heaven and possibly the singularity moment for financial services: the future of decentralized governance combined with the relationship economy of Scientology.\n\nBlocke-Heist Casino – Magritte Biennale\n\nThe DAG opening gala party – Tuxedo and Magritte Bowler Hat only for men, ladies in Gala Dress – will be held tonight in the Grand Salon of the Casino of Blocke-Heist, starting at 11pm with Champagne and genuine Russian caviar, followed by a standing dinner, and Belgian Top House-DJ’s animating the dance floor till early in the morning. The event is sponsored by Veuve Wickcot Champagnes and BancoBlanco. For those with more artistic interests, there is also a Biennale running in the Casino, of Belgian surrealist artist Magritte. See you all there!\n\nI spent last weekend in the wonderful city of Lisbon, under a blue sky, lots of sunshine and an pleasant spring-like 18°C! The atmosphere in the city is super-relaxed, the best description I heard was “like Barcelona on tranquilizers”.\n\nA couple of months ago, Venessa Miemis pointed me to the website of SandBox, a movement/network of young entrepreneurs < 30 years old. I am almost double that age, and was very pleased and humbled when the organizers accepted me as one of their elderly guest at their first Sandbox Global Summit.\n\nA few weeks ago, I had a Skype call with Laura Merling from Alcatel Lucent in San-Francisco in the context of our crazy Corporate Rebels United initiative, introduced her to the organizers, and she was accepted as well to attend. Here we were: two corporate rebels together enjoying the energy and enthusiasm of 200 highly energized young folks.\n\nSandbox is all about incubating people versus incubating projects: I love the idea of building a strengths based society on the energy of this young generation. Sandbox is now a community of 700 young leaders. About 200 of them were present at Sandbox Lisbon (twitter hash tag #lisbox12).\n\nThe event site suggested something that would be anything but a traditional “conference” and without any “keynotes” as most of the participants were each keynoters on their own right. I was indeed quite impressed with the quality of the audience.\n\nThe event formula was in essence a un-conference format, but where the session owners were pre-listed with their subjects before the event.\n\nThe event was really very well executed: personalized welcome for all participants at the airport, great catering, breakfast you don’t even see at sibos, excellent ice-brakers for speed-dating, many ways to mix up groups, well managed serendipity, trips in town, speed dating, collective raising hands to call for silence, and at the end a crowd-produced playbook: a post-event testimonial guidebook for change-makers, with Bloomberg Businessweek co-production.\n\nAll this smells very Innotribe of course, and that’s great! We have a bit different emphasis on design, facilitation, immersive learning experiences and performance and it would be great exchange ideas and to explore with Sandbox some sort of co-production at one of their or our events.\n\nSome other ideas of collaboration that crossed my mind were:\n\nHaving some Sandbox representatives in our corporate rebels united group (see later)\n\nLet some Sandboxers present at Innotribe Sibos, topics abundant in anything that has to do with corporate culture and innovation\n\nCo-produce Innovation Gardens for our customers: some Sandboxers already do this ad-hoc for corporations\n\nWhat was really very cool at Sandbox was the decoration by cardboard company Oupas! Design: its amazing to see how many shapes in cardboard one can built in no time. The whole event took place in the former HQ of a Portuguese bank, now Museum for Fashion and Design of Lisbon, close to the Plaza di Comercio.\n\nSandbox had “occupied” the third floor, which was just an empty space 5 days before the event.\n\nDuring the opening session, the core group of Sandbox explained what they were all about: young do-ers with a passion for change, a passion for impact, and together on an “expedition” to become the leaders of our world in 20 years. What if they would meet and connect now when they are <30, and not when they are in leadership positions when 50+.\n\nWhat could happen in terms of\n\ncreating relationships\n\nand deep circles of trust ?\n\nThe organizers made clear that this event was NOT about networking or exchanging business cards. They also had a “no-wifi” policy to maximize real people connections:\n\nconnecting by disconnecting\n\nThey also had some big name sponsors: Bertelsmann, Siemens, and Bloomberg Business Week. It was a nice coincidence to see that the edition of Business Week where our Innotribe DAG incubation project was covered, was one of the giveaways at the event.\n\nI have rarely seen such a concentration of young brainpower, and any smart company interested in recruiting from this well should not hesitate in sponsoring this organization.\n\nAnd the core-group is quite ambitious for 2012:\n\nGrowing the community from 700 to 2-3000 members: in my opinion they will have to monitor very closely the quality of their members, if not the whole concept will dilute very quickly.\n\nThey want to increase the focus on incubation of projects\n\nThey think about a venture fund. It was indeed interesting to see how many of the Sandboxers were entrepreneurs and start-ups with strong ties to VC and Angel community. Some investors already “infiltrated”\n\nI don’t know: it seems to me difficult to maintain the deep circle of trust concept when commercial and investment interests start to mingle. And I would like to see some of the “un-polished-ness” and “free-flow” nurtured and maintained for some time. The risk of wanting to grow too fast, you see?\n\nOver the 2 1/2 days, there were 4 times 14 parallel sessions, all interesting and inspiring! Here is a couple of sessions I attended:\n\nWhat if robots take over, and all jobs disappear?\n\nMy biggest learning was about how to lead a session. One participant made a great move. In stead of cutting if the creative flow he asked for your first name, and then asked a clarifying question, really inviting, and with great sensitivity for relationship building\n\nIt seemed to me that the participants in this session were in search for “better”, for “the unnamed quality”, something that resonates with the shift from finite to infinite games, the shift from money to wealth, the shift from having to produce something to the search for deeper relationships. It was as if they all wanted to grow on the Spiral Dynamics tornado of Don Beck.\n\nThe greatest question came from Lina:\n\n“What makes you so afraid?”\n\nLooking in the eyes of the session facilitator,\n\nI saw the fear for loss of power,\n\nnot being part of the elite,\n\nthe fear for the loss of the ego.\n\nBank/finance 2.0\n\nThis was an incredible session with +/- 20 participants, lead by @marcpbernegger.\n\nI was truly amazed how much they knew about this subject. One guy even made a PHD dissertation on banking/finance 2.0 in Switzerland. Some salient points of this session:\n\nMost of the innovations spotted in financial services fall in one of these categories:\n\nFront end innovation\n\nMoral banking (Triodos, etc)\n\nFinancial crisis leading to more transparency\n\nAlternative currencies leading to a redefinition of value/wealth\n\nI also heard some very relevant statements/observations:\n\nWhy is it such a hassle\n\nto care where your money is invested?\n\nWhy is it so difficult\n\nto open a shared account?\n\nThis group was so powerful that I invited the session owner to open their closed Facebook group to the Innotribe Community.\n\nPirates session by Peter (@petervan) and Laura (@magicmerl)\n\nAs mentioned before, Laura, Mike Maney, myself and several Innotribe team members have been playing with the idea of “Rebels United”. During Sandbox, Laura and myself animated a session on this that was well attended by about 15 young people, 3 of them from a large corporation.\n\nWe asked the 3 ladies from Upash to make some cardboard props to announce our session. Here is Laura and me with our Pirates outfit:\n\nBelow the input we received:\n\nEverybody thinks its a very cool idea\n\nTo succeed, we will need an inspiring vision, a shared belief system versus a generic and fluffy “we are going to change this place”\n\nA good way to get to that vision is to answer the question: “What needs to change in big corporations to get these young people willing to come to work for them?”\n\nWe should be looking for processes and best practices for efficient pirating in corporations\n\nWe have to be clear whether we want a “Movement” or a “network”\n\nWe need a budget to experiment\n\nThe metaphor of “How to make Babies” was very much appreciated and lead into a discussion on co-creation and ownership\n\nIn terms of ownership we should evolve from “my vision” towards “our project”\n\nWe have to get OUT physically of your normal corporate environment to meet in outside environment\n\nAny movement of this kind will need executive sponsorship, but there is a reciprocal value of offering reverse mentorship: how can rebels inspire the current executive leaders?\n\nWe have to recognize and reward rebels’ success, show it can be a career to move up the ladder\n\nWe also introduced the concept of “The Castle and the Sandbox (or the Garage)”.\n\nThere was a lively discussion that still resonates with me. Is it really such a good idea to isolate innovation projects in a separate “garage” location? I got even more inspired by the Lisbon City tour that brought us to the “Villas”. The “villas” were actually houses for the poor that were build INSIDE the patio of houses of very rich people. Below picture of the inside of Villa Sousa that was part of our tour.\n\nIt got me thinking and I was getting more and more confuzed by the polarization effect of the castle/sandbox pitch we like to use so much in Innotribe.\n\nInstead of separate innovation ghettos, we might be better off thinking about incubation “floors”, zones, islands, meeting points, plazas, patios, “Villas”, planets, etc, where anybody of the company can look over the shoulder, get interested, and get infected by the innovation virus.\n\nThe same way we should plant and nurture innovation angels/flowers/rebels deep in the fabric of our company to create innovation from within and thus\n\ncreating viral waves of change\n\nTo push the metaphor of “babies” even further: once the rejected baby comes out of the incubator, find an adoption family or zone that going to take care as if their own baby, in stead of creating special-character camps – garages – ghettos, where the kids will come out like non-adaptive aliens, prone to development of criminal behavior and ending up in jail (exaggerated pun intended, but you get the idea 🙂\n\nOther suggestions from our crowdsourcing session included:\n\nMake failure affordable: organize “failure-fairs”\n\nCreate “safety nets” for Corporate Rebels\n\nOffer case studies\n\nDeclare and organize a “Worldwide corporate rebel day”\n\nReward and celebrate corporate rebels\n\nRebels competition\n\nExchange programs to inject rebels in organizations wishing to experiment with the idea\n\nGo undercover, build in some secrecy, have a little pin, a secret code\n\nThere was also some discussion on the word “Rebels”\n\nIt has connotations with subversive, disruptive\n\nBetter would be to talk about the “Supreme Head of Internal Innovation” (pun intended J\n\nDon’t be shy, don’t try to hide from the start: just call what it is. Certified corporate rebels\n\nGo further: provide formal corporate rebels training\n\nCheck out “The Unreasonable Institute”(see closing dinner speaker Robyn Scott)\n\nOrganize a “Rebels Bootcamp”\n\nDon’t get hang-up on the word “rebel”: allow for different styles adapted to the specific situation: rebels, shakers, igniters, instigators, champs, angels, corporate tree shakers\n\nLots of the throughts about Corporate Rebels are captured in my Prezi on the Soul of Innovation (which since begin Jan 2012 almost got 1,000 views) and Jennifer Sertl’s post/reaction on Google+:\n\n“I sense some\n\ntipping point moments\n\ndue to your curation”\n\nShe also contextualized her feedback with a quote from Malcolm Gladwell from The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference:\n\n“A tipping point is that magic moment\n\nwhen an idea, trend, or social behavior\n\ncrosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire.”\n\nA wildfire, I love it. While we are getting organized to more formally set up our movement, get further inspired by a curation of resources I have been compiling for a while now via Scoop.It\n\nEnjoy !\n\nBy @petervan from Innotribe\n\nNot many people know this, but in the 70ies, 80ies, I was a quite successful DJ, and me and my friends toured under the brand “Celebration”. Life was – and still is – a big feast.\n\nEmbarrassed to say, but my first record bought was “Paranoid” from Black Sabbath. The paranoid thing probably haunted me for the rest of my life.\n\nBut I also have the original “God Save The Queen” by the Sex Pistols, on the EMI-label that rejected them before they became a huge hit, part of the disruptive album “Never Mind the Bollocks”\n\nWatch the metaphor of the “flag”.\n\nWith “Celebration”, we did everything ourselves:\n\nWe built ourselves the PA system, the lighting system, made our own jingles, we cut out our own slip-mats in cardboard (this was before the first fast-starting Technics turntables)\n\nprinted our own posters to announce the show\n\ndistributed at parties all sorts of gadgets to attract audience to our next gig. A famous example is a small plastic bag with 2 sugar cubes suggesting the energy that will be required at the next party.\n\nWe begged for the small lorry from the grocery shop to be able to transport all that stuff and records from one place to another.\n\nA lot was manual. And heavy. Vinyl records are heavy. Especially if you have a couple of thousand and you live on a 5th floor apartment with no elevator, stairs only.\n\nIt was a network of friends. We went out on our scooters to paste the posters on the ad boards in the villages around, we borrowed each other’s records. It was the shareable economy avant-la-letter. We played for fun, later for a crate of beer, and much later for a couple of 100 Euro per night. That was for gigs for 3,000+ people. No prima-donna behavior like today’s top-DJ’s like Tiesto and others. Everything was new and innovative.\n\nWe wanted to shock\n\nWe felt like pirates\n\nLater I joined a group of crazy enthusiasts who founded one of the first free and – at that time – pirate radio station FM-Bruxel. That was with guys like Gust Decoster, Luckas Vander Taelen, Dominique Deruddere, Ray Cokes and Marcel Vanthilt, most of them still playing a prominent role in the local media and film industry.\n\nWe really behaved like pirates. We also had our flag and our own logo. Can’t find it back: if somebody from the original gang still has a picture, please mail it to me. I will be grateful for eternity.\n\nAnd years later, some of these guys found each other as founders and managers of one of the most famous nightclubs of Belgium “Le Beau Bruxel”. Our party animals were from art scene and musicians. I did that for 2 years. And I can tell you, I saw a lot of “characters”, learned a lot about human (non)-behavior. We closed the shop because nightlife became too dangerous in Brussels.\n\nFast forward many years to 2011: I am having a telephone conversation with a potential speaker for Innotribe at Sibos 2011 in Toronto. And I describe the Innotribe space we had in Amsterdam last year.\n\nMy speaker reacted: “wow, that sounds cool! The only things you guys are missing is a pirate flag!”\n\nIndeed, with some – a lot actually – imagination, you could see our 600 m² Innotribe space at Sibos as a flagship, with the front part for the keynote presentations as the “prow” of our ship, the lab-space as the “galley”, the tower with the projector as our mast, and the projection screen as our sails.\n\nImagine a ship like this sailing in the middle of the exposition hall of Sibos, creating havoc – positive inspirational havoc – throughout the week. The only thing that was missing was the pirates flag on the top of our mast.\n\nThe pirate flag.\n\nTwo days later – completely by coincidence – I started reading “The Pirate’s Dilemma: How Youth Culture Is Reinventing Capitalism” (Amazon Affiliates Link) by Matt Mason, also author of “The Pirate’s Dilemma: How Hackers, Punk Capitalists, Graffiti Millionaires and Other Youth Movements are Remixing Our Culture and Changing Our World”\n\nFantastic read. Some parts you can skip if you – like me – have been inherently part of the punk and new-wave culture of that period. The names of bands generate a lot of nostalgia!\n\nSome really cool quotes from this book:\n\nchanging the very fabric of our economic system, replacing outdated ideas with the twenty-first-century upgrades of Punk Capitalism\n\nDisruptive new D.I.Y. technologies are causing unprecedented creative destruction\n\nD.I.Y. encourages us to reject authority and hierarchy, advocating that we can and should produce as much as we consume\n\nYouth cultures often embody some previously invisible, unacknowledged feeling in society and give it an identity\n\nBuilding a community of pirate entrepreneurs\n\nIn Chapter 2, the author introduced the “Principality of Sealand”, a pirates home in the middle of the English Channel, in waters that are un-sovereign.\n\nAnd have a good look at the intro about “Principality of Sealand” in Wikipedia:\n\nSince 1967, the facility has been occupied by the former British Major Paddy Roy Bates; his associates and family claim that it is an independent sovereign state. External commentators generally classify Sealand as a micro-nation rather than an unrecognised state.[3] While it has been described as the world’s smallest nation,[4] Sealand is not currently officially recognised as a sovereign state by any sovereign state. Although Roy Bates claims it is de facto recognised by Germany as they have sent a diplomat to the micronation, and by the United Kingdom after an English court ruled it did not have jurisdiction over Sealand, neither action constitutes de jure recognition as far as the respective countries are concerned.\n\nMaybe that is what innovation teams have to do: create their own sovereign state, micro-nation, governed by its own rules, taking unclaimed territory, and… act like pirates.\n\nThe pirates metaphor also came to mind when I saw last year Laura Merling from Alcatel-Lucent (@magicmerl on twitter and describing herself as “API Strategist, Marketing and Business Dev, Developer Community Geek”) gave a speech at Defrag 2010 in Boulder, CO.\n\nHer talk was titled:\n\n“On Being A Corporate Renegade”\n\nDepending on what dictionary, a “renegade” is a deserter from one faith, cause, or allegiance to another or an individual who rejects lawful or conventional behavior. That’s what I would call a pirate.\n\nYou haven’t seen Laura. She is a bit skinny, long rave-black peaky hair, and some really cool belt. A bit like the one below, but much cooler. Since then I refer to her as the “belt-woman”.\n\nHer talk went more or less like this:\n\nWhen I got hired as manager of the API start-up within Alcatel Lucent, my CEO gave me 90 days to deliver V1 of the platform. 90 Days !\n\nI did not have resources nor budget\n\nI hired 6 mercenaries, good friends with specific proven strengths on marketing, coding, program management etc\n\nWe did it for fun and for the challenge\n\nNext meeting with my CEO was on my role as change agent\n\nHe said: “Laura, you are successful when in 3 months time there are 70,000 people at my door complaining what this bloody women is doing in my company!”\n\nThat’s what I would call a CEO Innovation mind-set ! Maybe the Laura’s story is a bit romanticized, so what ? She gets the story across.\n\nThat’s why we invited Laura and her team when we were doing the Cloud Computing study tour earlier this year. This time we had her full team – 15 young and brilliant folks – who could interact with an executive audience that could compete big time with what you sometimes see from incumbents like IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, you name them. Very impressive. And what an energy from this start-up groovy team. So inspiring.\n\nSo when Laura was in Europe for business a couple of weeks ago, we asked her to come and meet our innovation team in La Hulpe. Inspired by the culture story, the idea emerged of teaming up together more regularly.\n\nQuickly back to The Pirate’s Dilemma book:\n\nWhat pirates do differently is create new spaces where different ideas and methods run the show\n\nPirate radio is an incubator where new music can mutate. Initially, the new strains of music it produces are seen as too risqué for the mainstream to touch, but once this music reaches a critical mass in popularity, anthems from the pirates start hitting the pop charts, pirate DJs become crossover celebrities, and the scenes created by these stations grow into cottage industries and worldwide exports\n\nI started reflecting on this.\n\nWhy not create a community of pirates, of rebels with a cause, of innovators. By positioning our Innotribe space at Sibos as the Pirates’ Mother Ship, and like Matt Mason suggests:\n\n“By giving a community\n\na new space\n\nthat was not previously available\n\nto them,\n\nyou can empower them,\n\nand they in turn\n\nwill propel your idea forward”\n\nA group of people who are relentlessly challenging the status quo, breaking the rules, saying the unsaid, spreaders of the innovation virus and of tribal energy. No fear. Rebels with a cause. Leading by being our true selves.\n\nAnd with the Innotribe Logo as our Pirate’s Flag and declare sovereignty.\n\nSOFA stands for SWIFT Operational Forum Americas, a yearly event targeted at a typical operational audience. This year’s SOFA is on 8-9 March 2011 in NYC. The theme for SOFA 2011 is “Defining the next generation of financial services”.\n\nInnotribe is SWIFT’s innovation initiative. Innotribe’s mission is ‘Enabling Collaborative Innovation’. Part of our activities includes events: existing SWIFT events like Sibos and SOFA, third party events like CPA in Canada and EPCA in Europe last year. It usually translated into a “special” session, with lots of professionally facilitated interactivity.\n\nWith Innotribe events we have the ambition to “unpack” stereotypes, myths and hypes. These Innotribe Events are an energizing mix of education, perspective, collaboration and facilitation. Our success factors for this new type event are organized along the following three axes of “opening-up” our traditional ecosystem: audience, content and brand recognition.\n\nSo, what’s up at SOFA this year ? We have two things going on:\n\nAt the end of day-1, yours truly will give the presentation “How to make babies” a strong metaphor for SWIFT’s Innovation Framework. Prezi version of this presentation is here. Tip: set sound “on”\n\nAt the end of day-2, our innovation team will animate a Special Session “The New Thinkers”\n\nBuilding on the Innotribe @ Sibos tradition of exploring “Tectonic Shifts”, this Special Session will be an energizing mix of education, new perspectives, collaboration and facilitation.\n\nOur goal is to stimulate the generation of new ideas by bringing together a powerful mixture of audience members and by enabling freedom of discussion – allowing the conversation to take the participants into any and all areas that open up on the day.\n\nWe believe strongly in the potential\n\nof unexpected encounters,\n\nand the magic that can happen\n\nwhen people from\n\ndifferent background\n\nare brought together\n\nSo the innovators and change agents of our industry will be invited to join the SOFA audience (and also to join us in Toronto for Sibos 2011 in September), and we hope this will foster exciting new discussions between them and the traditional SOFA attendees.\n\nIdeas do not typically come out of the blue. Rather, they are usually variations of existing ideas. Sometimes, simply looking at a familiar idea from a different perspective can spark a new idea or the combination of existing ideas to achieve new goals and create radically different value propositions. All the topics we propose to discuss during this Innotribe Special Session at SOFA are also potential subjects to explore in Toronto – but we are looking for your feedback to tell us if these are the right ideas to stimulate your creative thinking!\n\nPresentations from five great modern thinkers will culminate in an interactive exchange between the SOFA audience and the speakers, led by Innotribe facilitation champ Mariela Atanassova. The audience will be able to drive the discussion according to the themes that most interest them – ensuring everyone will have an opportunity to collaborate in the innovation we hope this session will stimulate.\n\nHere are The new thinkers:\n\nVenessa Miemis (http://emergentbydesign.com/about/): Free agent, Master in Media Studies at the New School, NYC, futurist and digital ethnographer, researching the impacts of social technologies on society and culture and designing systems to facilitate innovation and the evolution of consciousness. Venessa will update us on The Future of Money project (world premiere at Sibos 2010) and The Future of Facebook, a new research project sponsored by Innotribe as Corporate Patron.\n\nDouglas Rushkoff (http://rushkoff.com/bio/): thought leader and provocateur. Author of best selling books Cyberia : Life in the Trenches of Hyperspace, Life, Inc, and Program or be Programmed (all Amazon Affiliate links). Doug will give a talk about New Capitalism, and introduce his latest project on a Summit he is organizing in NYC on 20 October 2011 called “Contact”. Contact Summit will seek to explore and realize the greater promise of social media to promote new forms of culture, commerce, collective action and creativity.\n\nBrian Zisk: organizer of the Future of Money & Technology Summit in San-Francisco (www.futureofmoney.com). Brian will summarise the findings of the Summit that took place on 28 Feb 2011. Psssst ! If you still want to go to Brian’s event, go the the registration page at ttp://futureofmoney.eventbrite.com/ and use the discount code “Innotribe”.\n\nStowe Boyd (http://www.stoweboyd.com/ ): probably THE authority on Social media, Stowe is a Social Philosopher and Webthropologist from NY. His work focuses on social tools and their impact on media, business, and society. In 2011, Stowe is focused on a new line of research: Social Cognition. This research is co-sponsored by Innotribe, and we hope to share the final results at Sibos 2011 in Toronto.\n\nKevin Slavin (http://about.me/slavin): also from NY, Kevin is founder of AreaCodeInc (recently acquired by Zygna, the undisputed leader of Social Games). Kevin will talk about the New Future and “Those algorithms that govern our lives” – including our personal finances!\n\n(picture from Dave Gray’s blog)\n\nFor the interactive part, we will organise the session around the organic growth aspects of cities. I have written about this before in my post “How to make babies”, and recently there was a fantastic post by Dave Gray on “The Connected Company”. We invited Dave to SOFA as well, but he unfortunately could not make it.\n\nDave’s post is a fantastic post – and as far as I am concerned – one of those game changing post already for 2011, and I will definitely come back to it later.\n\nDave for example says:\n\nAnd today, thanks to social technologies, we finally have the tools to manage companies like the complex organisms they are. Social Business Design is design for companies that are made out of people. It’s design for complexity, for productivity, and for longevity. It’s not design by division but design by connection.\n\nHe is also author of “Gamestorming, A Playbook for Innovators, Rulebrakers, and Changemakers” (Amazon Associate Link)\n\nLooks like the book is very much about the principles that our team applies for interactive session design.\n\nAnd gamestorming\n\nis exactly what we’re going to do\n\nat SOFA\n\nduring this special session\n\nWhat: Innotribe Special Session at SOFA 2011, NYC\n\nWhen: From 2-5 pm on 9 March 2011 at SOFA (http://www.swift.com/events/2011/SOFA/index.page\n\nLocation: Marriott Marquis, Broadway, NYC\n\nIt’s quite some time ago i did a post with brand new content. It’s partly because i also have a family and a job, but mainly because i only feel the urge to blog when i have real content to contribute.\n\nThese days i also share an awful lot via twitter: that’s where the day-to-day action is. So if you are interested in my lens on technology and values for the 21st century, you can also follow we on twitter @petervan . There is an almost daily stream of tweets on these subjects.\n\nI “reserve” the blog to share some more elaborated thoughts on stuff that keeps me going or that touches me one way or another way emotionally, in the way i am.\n\nThis time, the post is about\n\nPeople, Culture, Excitement and\n\nSculptural Integrity\n\nAnd I’d like to share what happens if you truly stand for who you are and have the courage to stand up and stick out your neck.\n\nThe title of this post is of course a word-spiel on get-a-life and get alive. The discussion was part of an off-site recently attended in the wonderful city of Barcelona.\n\nIt was about 20 years ago i was in Barcelona, and the only thing i remembered were the ‘”Ramblas” and the “Plaza de Espagna”. Given my education as an architect (non many people know this ;-), i of course knew that Barcelona was the city of the Sagrada Familia of Gaudi.\n\nThe off-site was facilitated by Dan Newman and his team from The Value Web.\n\nThe off-site was our reflection moment about our company for the next 5 years.\n\nDan really “got me” with his opening speech: he used two words that deeply resonated very strong with me – at an emotional level.\n\nThe architect aims for\n\n“Sculptural Integrity”\n\nEspecially in sculpting the old with the new. Old game and new game. And that the old and the new should be connected by more than just a link or a tunnel. That the end-result should show a deep sense of unity. And that this “sculptural integrity” and other architectural thoughts were the also the basis of facilitation work and techniques of the Value Web, because that was also how group dynamics could be looked upon.\n\nThe words entered by body and mind, as they reminded me of a piece of my true self and my youth 30 years ago when i was making drawings and sketches myself of the most bizarre and bold architectural designs.\n\nDan mentioned also a book: “The Timeless Way of Building” by Christopher Alexander.\n\nThe real and ultimate question in this book is:\n\nWhat is it that makes a building “work” ?\n\nWhen you see something that works, you just know it. And it’s something that has a timeless quality.\n\nI was intrigued by the subject, and kept researching, and quickly discovered the site of Tomorrow Makers.\n\nAnd especially the blog post titled “Happiness Pandemic (HP101) Hits Worldwide”. Just read and internalize the first two bullets:\n\nThe tendency to let yourself be guided by intuition instead of acting under pressure of fear, forced ideas and pre-conditioned behavior.\n\nA total loss of interest in: – judging others, convicting yourself and preoccupation with things that create conflict.\n\nDuring the off-site, Dan did something else that was brilliant. He took us out of the hotel into the city. In our case we went to the CosmoCaixa Barcelona, the Museum of Science.\n\nBesides being a perfect metaphor for blending old and new with “sculptural integrity”, it also put all of us in a different context and mindset to look in quite different and innovative ways to our off-site subject.\n\nI don’t know what happened exactly, but when we returned to the conference hotel, we were looking for topics likes\n\nspace\n\nfreedom\n\nexcitement\n\nplayfulness\n\nculture\n\npeople\n\nAt a certain moment, we could form a small group of people, sort of a tribe around a subject that was not yet addressed.\n\nI put the word “excitement” on a post-it, and look: 10 min later, we had 7 or so colleagues interested in discussing the subject.\n\nI asked a simple question: “how excited do you get by the work done so far at this off-site” and rate it on a scale of 1-10. To my astonishment, the average rating was 3.\n\nSo we then looked for the root-cause of this score. A lot had to do with company culture, but also by the need for a new vocabulary, and not just words, but a vocabulary that was inspired by the value set that is needed for the 21st century.\n\nIn a follow-up session on people and culture this topic re-appeared in full force.\n\nAlthough initially we were looking at symptoms and superficial quick fixes, it suddenly dawned to us that\n\nthe real root cause was about\n\nthe openness of\n\nour minds, hearts, and minds.\n\nI have used the following slide many times in my postings.\n\nIn black the old game: full of macho behavior and Machiavellian attitudes and states of mind.\n\nIn white the new game. With true, genuine interest in the other and the true self – not based on tricks or quick fixes.\n\nThe discussions on these topics were deep and full of enthusiasm. We were looking at talent development, both the professional skills ànd the Personal Development side of it.\n\nAnd i keep on fighting that “Personal Development” is NOT about “soft” skills.\n\nIt’s really about having and keeping\n\ncutting-edge “good” people\n\non board\n\nand nurturing them so that they can function optimally in today’s highly connected networked society.\n\nYou need to “train” and get exposed to a number of essential hard skills and values for the 21st century.\n\nIn this context, i get very inspired by the work of Vanessa Miemis, a Gen-Y student with a fantastic blog “Emergent by Design”. Look for example at her latest blog entry “Essential Skills for 21st Century Survival: Part-3 Network Weaving”\n\nOr the post “Framework for a Strengths Based Society”\n\nDo you feel how powerful this is ?\n\n“Strengths Based Society”\n\nShould we not invite her to Sibos ? To be part of Innotribe at Sibos. As part of our “Gen-Y meet Bankers” Face-to-Face interactive workshop ? Maybe with the help of some strong Gen-Y-power, we will be able to keep the sharpness of our ideas and dreams.\n\nBecause at the end of the off-site, each team had to boil it down its ideas to a pitch of 5 minutes and I was surprised to witness how in this pitching work, we lost quite some of the “cutting\" edge”. Also surprised on how fear creeps in when people are volunteered to deliver the pitch to the executives.\n\nAnd a strange behavior of watering down the message, and even scratching the most provocative words in the end deliverable.\n\nWe seem to have lost\n\nour desire for\n\nboldness\n\nWe also “frame” too conservatively. So, in order not to loose some of these more provocative statements, here are some examples:\n\nIn 5 years time, 10% of our workforce should be Generation-Y folks\n\nBy 2015, our company should be in the Top-10 of best companies to work for in the financial industry. Worldwide.\n\nGen-Y should drive the composition of the Leadership council of the future\n\n90% of the people in the 2015 leaders team should be new. Only 10% of today’s group should be the same\n\nDoing things 10,000 time better rather than twice as good\n\n“Do no evil” is not good enough anymore. “Great to Good” is the new paradigm.\n\n“Get-a-Life and Get Alive !” Was the original title of our pitch. Somebody changed the title to the more boring “people and values for 2015”\n\nChief Corporate Activist\n\nAbout framing: from “our company is 37 years old, are we in a mid-life crisis” to “our company is 37 years old, we are just-born, who do we want to feel “right” or “it works” in 500 years from now?”\n\nAt this moment, I decided to have a short break in my blogging activity, and go for my Sunday trip to the bakery. I bumped into a friend, who shared me a wonderful story about going for your dreams.\n\nThe story was basically about context. Of not waiting to be called. Of doing what you intuitively know is right. What works. In his case it was about seeing a wonderful motorbike, feeling it was just designed perfectly, and following your intuition and impulse and buying the motorbike. It happened to be a Can-Am Spyder Roadster. This was not just about buying something desirable. It was a story about contextual living. About flow. About following your compass. And not delaying your dreams till when you’re dead.\n\nThe story reminded me of the book “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance”\n\nYou can find “flow” is everything you do. From the most banal activities like cleaning or motorbike maintenance to writing an inspiring blog and making a pitch that makes others dream and wanting to go after their dream.\n\nWhen i started this blog in April 2009, i wanted it to be in line with my purpose in life “Inspire other people to dream” – and execute their dreams. I hope i have not disappointed you so far.\n\nLast week, somebody said i should start writing a book. Maybe i will do that. Maybe using the funding model experimented by Stowe Boyd fro writing his report on Social Architecture: Microstreams In Business.\n\nLast week, somebody gave me the greatest compliment somebody can give to a man of the 21st century:\n\n“you have the most feminine mindset\n\nof all the men i ever met”\n\nLet’s eradicate the macho culture of judging, being cynical, and control freaks.\n\nLet’s build a culture based on open mind, open heart and open will.\n\nAre you also fed-up waiting on the side-line and do you feel the hunger to join me on the drawing board to help us sketch the “sculptural integrity” required for the 21st century ?\n\nThen please use abundantly the comments feature of this blog.\n\nDoing what you want to do, not waiting to be called. Stand-up and stand as you are. In your true self. Without fear. Living your dreams.\n\nGet-a-Life !\n\nGet ALIVE !\n\nIf you feel energized by this blog, you can get an extra doze at following previous posts:\n\nNo more collateral damage\n\nWho am i really ?\n\nGreat to Good: New Value Kit\n\nBroken Will\n\nOur company is infected\n\nEthical Re-Boot\n\nThe Holy Fire\n\nEmotional Zombies\n\nHR and Innovation\n\nBrand, Workforce and Innovation"
