        "text": "A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. The ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on\n\nPage 10.\n\nNow Playing\n\n* ''A.I.,'' starring Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances O'Connor and Sam Robards. Written and directed by Steven Spielberg (PG-13, 140 minutes). Mr. Spielberg's new film, a project he inherited from Stanley Kubrick, to whom it is dedicated, is a work of brilliant artifice and profound intelligence. Mr. Osment plays a robot programmed with the capacity to love who is sent to live with a couple grieving for their comatose, gravely ill son. The movie's three distinct sections reveal an unsettlingly plausible vision of the future and explore a rich, complex set of emotions and ideas. Mr. Spielberg accomplishes the improbable feat of melding Kubrick's chilly, analytical style with his own warmer, needier sensibility, and the result is an exquisitely layered, complex movie -- the riskiest, most ambiguous, most intellectually challenging fairy tale the director has made to date (A. O. Scott).\n\n''CATS AND DOGS,'' starring Jeff Goldblum and Elizabeth Perkins; with the voices of Tobey Maguire, Alec Baldwin and Sean Hayes. Directed by Lawrence Guterman (PG, 87 minutes). Unbeknownst to us dimwitted bipeds, a cold war rages between our pets, as canine secret agents equipped with high-tech surveillance equipment try to prevent a dictatorial feline named Mr. Tinkles from taking over the world. Such, at any rate, is the premise of this overloaded, intermittently clever smorgasbord of sight gags and special effects. Despite some hectic overplotting and the occasional hairball of sentimentality, the picture should succeed in diverting animal-loving children while not driving their parents completely crazy (Scott).\n\n* ''THE CLOSET,'' starring Daniel Auteuil and GÃ©rard Depardieu. Directed by Francis Veber (R, 86 minutes; in French with English subtitles). A classic French farce with a contemporary twist, this very funny comedy spoofs political correctness, homophobia and corporate hypocrisy in its story of a mousy divorced accountant (Mr. Auteuil) who pretends to be gay to save his job in a condom factory. He can't be fired, he reasons correctly, because of corporate fear of a lawsuit for discrimination. Mr. Depardieu is hilariously galumphing as an obsequious homophobe who goes to such ludicrous extremes to demonstrate his tolerance that he drives himself crazy (Stephen Holden).\n\n''CRAZY/BEAUTIFUL,'' starring Kirsten Dunst, Jay Hernandez and Bruce Davison (PG-13, 95 minutes). This story of the romance between a troubled rich white girl (Ms. Dunst) and her down-to-earth, responsible Mexican-American classmate (Mr. Hernandez) is better -- more realistic and insightful -- than most movies about American teenagers. Ms. Dunst's performance is smart and angry, and Mr. Hernandez makes his character into something more than the cardboard saint he might have been. But because the film starts off with so much promise, its eventual slide into melodramatic convention is especially disappointing. It's ultimately too cautious and responsible to live up to either the promise of its title or the talents of its cast (Scott).\n\n''EVERYBODY'S FAMOUS,'' starring Josse de Pauw, Werner de Smedt, Eva van der Gucht and Thekla Reuten. Directed by Dominique Deruddere (R, 99 minutes; in Flemish, with English subtitles). A sweet and silly comedy from Belgium: sort of a Flemish ''King of Comedy'' without the satiric bite. Jean (Mr. de Pauw), a factory worker, dreams of pop stardom for his shy, overweight daughter (Ms. van der Gucht), while Debbie (Ms. Reuten), a leading chanteuse, tires of the limelight. A lot of busy, almost plausible complications ensue after Jean kidnaps Debbie. The movie's message seems to be that a good heart and a dream are enough to make you a star. This is a lovely if fanciful notion. Were it true, ''Everybody's Famous'' would be a better movie than it is (Scott).\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
