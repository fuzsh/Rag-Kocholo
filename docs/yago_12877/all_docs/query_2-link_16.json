        "text": "Directed by: Dominique Deruddere\n\nCountry: Belgium, 1987\n\nColor / 1.66:1 anamorphic widescreen\n\nLanguage: Dutch audio with optional English subtitles\n\nRunning Time: 87 minutes + Extras\n\nOther titles: L'amour est un chien de l'enfer / Love Is a Dog from Hell\n\nRegion: All (NTSC)\n\nNote: This DVD is out of print\n\nOscar® nominated director Dominique Deruddere's film is a darkly disturbing fairtytale for adults. On its original US release, the film was championed by Madonna, Sean Penn and Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola. But it proved too controversial for mass acceptance and never got the recognition it deserved.\n\nNow reappraised as one of the most under-rated films of the 1980s, Crazy Love makes its DVD debut in a stunning Hi Def transfer from the original negative, laden with extra features.\n\nThe film tells the story of a man's life through three crucial nights, spread over 20 years. From a love struck teenager to a down and out 30-something, we see him move from dreams to despair. How he changes his life in one final, transcendent act gives the film its title as well as providing us with one of the most unforgettable scenes in recent cinema history.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\nBrand new HD anamorphic transfer from the original vault elements\n\nCrazy Love: The Archives - Making Of with exclusive footage of Charles Bukowski (33 mins)\n\nDominique Deruddere on Crazy Love (24 mins)\n\nCrazy Love and Belgian Cinema (text essay)\n\nMondo Macabro previews\n\nCast:\n\nJosse De Pauw, Geert Hunaerts, Michael Pas, Gene Bervoets, Amid Chakir, Florence Béliard, Karen van Parijs, Carmela Locantore, An Van Essche, Doriane Moretus."
