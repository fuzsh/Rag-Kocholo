        "text": "Will Tura wrote history and has become the Emperor of the Flemish Song. He was the first Belgian artist to fill rock temple Vorst Nationaal in 1974 and his performance at the funeral of King Baudouin is engraved in the collective memory. A look back at his long career is a nostalgic trip through Flanders from the early 60s to the present.\n\n60 years ago Will Tura was on stage for the first time. In the following years, 10,000 performances, dozens of albums and a hundred number one hits would follow. From the very beginning, Tura had a large fan base, but it was not until the last few decades that he gained the respect he deserves throughout the Flemish music world. Director Dominique Deruddere (Crazy Love, Wait until Spring Bandini, Everybodyâ€™s Famous) brings Will Tura's story in his own way: beautiful archive footage is accompanied by the warm voice of Jan Decleir. The story of an honest artist and excellent performer who has worked very hard throughout his life to perfect his profession. And because of his long career, Tura's story also tells the larger story of Flanders during the last decades, making Hoop doet Leven a varied 'trip down memory lane' for every Flemish viewer."
