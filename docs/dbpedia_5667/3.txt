Kenneth Waller (November 5 1927 &ndash; January 28 2000) was an English actor.

Waller was born in Huddersfield, Yorkshire. His first role was in the 1959 production "Room at the Top", however it was not until 1981 when he played the part of "Old" Mr. Grace in "Are You Being Served?" that he found real fame. (Interestingly, despite being the elder of the Grace brothers Waller was actually 28 years younger than the actor who played "Young" Mr. Grace (Harold Bennett).)

He went on to play the part of Grandad in Carla Lane's comedy "Bread", the part he is most remembered for. He also made a brief appearance in "Coronation Street" as Curly Watts' father.

His last role was a voiceover for the animated film "Romuald the Reindeer". He died in London in 2000.
