        "text": "Who is he?\n\nAn Imperial officer who receives an unexpected promotion when his superior gets telepathically strangulated by Darth Vader. He wears a natty green outfit, topped off with what appears to be the Empire’s equivalent of a flat cap.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nBecause he looks so completely out of his depth. One of the most interesting things about the original trilogy is how it approaches the idea of the banality of evil: sure, Vader might be a terrifying black giant, but his underlings generally look like middle-managers from some venerable manufacturing firm.\n\nKey line: ‘As you wish, my lord.’\n\nWho is he?\n\nAn Ithorian denizen of the Mos Eisley Cantina whose bulbous brown bonce happens to resemble that of a hammerhead shark – or, indeed, a hammer.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nHammerhead will have to stand for all those nameless little monsters out there in the dark whose figures we avidly collected even though they barely appeared in the movies: step forward Snaggletooth, Walrus Man, Squidhead, Bossk, Zuckuss, Ree-Yees, Weequay, Klaatu, Barada, Nikto, Prune Face, and too many more to mention. We also love him because he takes centre stage in the single greatest ‘Star Wars’-themed comedy sketch of all time. Please hammer, don’t hurt ‘em!\n\nKey line: ‘Because my head is like a hammer, and a hammer is like-a my head!’\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe seedy ex-Imperial operative who hired Din Djarin (aka the Mandalorian) along with various other bounty hunters to track down and retrieve Grogu (aka Baby Yoda) for nefarious scientific ends.\n\nWhy do we love him\n\nBecause he’s played by Werner Herzog. Werner Herzog! In Star Wars! Look, it’s Werner Herzog! Look, seriously, it’s actual Werner Herzog! Look!\n\nKey line\n\n‘Is the world more peaceful since the revolution? I see nothing but death and chaos.’\n\nWho is he?\n\nA ruthless pod-racing legend who looks like a genetic blend between a camel and a condom.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nBecause he comes this close – this close! – to splattering little Anakin Skywalker all over the canyon wall, which would not only have wiped out the single most irritating child in the universe but saved a heck of a lot of trouble further down the line. If you can watch The Phantom Menace without praying for him to win, you’re made of more sentimental stuff than we are.\n\nKey line: ‘You won’t walk away from this one, slave scum!’ If only…\n\nWho is she?\n\nJust a regular retired scavenger from the planet Ferrix, who becomes so incensed with the way the galaxy is being run that in the autumn of her life she decides to fight the evil Empire by any means necessary.\n\nWhy do we love her?\n\nBecause she’s played by the redoubtable Fiona Shaw with a perfect blend of weariness and grit. Because she feels like one of us – you could easily imagine Maarva teaching your kids, or working in the Post Office, or marching through the centre of town holding a placard. And because she’s the first person in the Star Wars universe to ever use the word ‘bastards’ (which begs the question – how did anyone else know what it meant?).\n\nKey line\n\n‘If I could do it again, I’d wake up early and be fighting these bastards from the start. Fight the Empire!’\n\nWho is she? A spice-smuggler based on the ice-planet Kijimi, and former squeeze of Poe Dameron in The Rise of Skywalker.\n\nWhy do we love her?\n\nPartly because her angular art-deco helmet and purple threads make her look like something out of ’90s action oddity The Rocketeer, partly because underneath it all is the mighty Keri Russell, but mostly because she can put cocky pilot Poe in his place with just a look.\n\nKey line: It’s not a line – she doesn’t say a lot – but that little shake of the head when Poe tries to get under her helmet is priceless.\n\nWho are they?\n\nThe intergalactic renegades who pick on poor Luke in the Mos Eisley Cantina bar. Evazan is roughly human save for a spot of facial scarring and a serious werepig nose, while Baba is a dark green Aqualish with a worryingly fleshy, vaguely gynaecological maw.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nBecause they’re hard as nails. These space pirates have the death sentence on 12 – count ‘em! – systems, which makes them very much the wrong guys to mess with (unless you’re Obi-Wan Kenobi, which you aren’t). But are they just business partners, or is there something more serious going on?\n\nKey line: ‘He doesn’t like you. I don’t like you either.’\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe downtrodden floor manager at the Imperial prison on Narkina 5 who gradually comes to realise that the only way out of this military-industrial hellhole is by force.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nBecause he’s the living embodiment of what resistance means: a head-down, workaday drudge who is forced to confront the fact that everything he’s been told is a lie, and that the only way to beat The Man is to take up arms and fight – not just for himself, but for the freedom and well-being of all. That said, does anyone else think he bears a weird resemblance to Supreme Chancellor Snoke?\n\nKey line\n\n‘You need to help each other. You see someone who’s confused, someone who is lost, you get them moving and you keep them moving until we put this place behind us.’\n\nWho is he?\n\nHe’s the Robert Oppenheimer of the Star Wars universe: the scientist whose work on the Death Star enabled that monstrous machine to be built – but whose bold act of sabotage allowed it to be destroyed again.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nPartly because he’s so beautifully played by Mads Mikkelsen, fiercely capturing the struggles of man who sees no choice but to abandon his principles. But also because he gracefully plugs one of the biggest plot holes in the original Star Wars trilogy – why a battle station with the power to destroy a planet should also feature a handy self-destruct mechanism.\n\nKey line: ‘Whatever I do, I do it to protect you.’\n\nWho is she?\n\nRe-re-wind! And the crowd says Bo-Katan Kryze! An exiled member of the Mandalorian ruling class who took up arms when the Empire destroyed her homeworld, she has now reclaimed the planet for her people.\n\nWhy do we love her?\n\nBecause she effortlessly made the transition from cartoon character in The Clone Wars to fully fleshed-out human in The Mandalorian. Because she’s relentlessly badass, going toe-to-toe with Imperials, rival Mandalorians, shriek-hawks and sundry other beasties without breaking a sweat. Because she’s both warrior and diplomat, uniting the tribes in a common purpose. And, of course, because she’s played by Starbuck out of Battlestar Galactica.\n\nKey line\n\n‘I am Bo-Katan of Clan Kryze. I was born on Mandalore and fought in the Purge. I am the last of my line.’\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe Imperial upstart who actually dares to challenge Darth Vader’s authority, and even the existence of the Force. But not for long…\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nBecause he’s not just an ass-kissing yes-man on the road to terminal strangulation like pretty much everyone else in the Imperial high command (see numbers 37 and 45). Motti is a realist, dammit: he believes in firepower, not mystical mumbo jumbo. Also, he has the best lipcurling snarl this side of Huw Edwards.\n\nKey line: ‘Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer’s ways, Lord Vader.’\n\nWho is he?\n\nLando Calrissian’s co-pilot behind the controls of the Millennium Falcon at the Battle of Endor – an enthusiastic goon with a natty waistcoat and a face like layered sushi.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nBecause, while everyone else is getting blown to bits and yelling about how it’s a trap, Nien just looks like he’s having a whale of a time, bobbing up and down in his seat and chattering away in what we’re reliably informed is a dialect of the Kenyan language. In the original script, Lando and Nien were supposed to die in the flaming fireball of the Death Star. We’re really glad the producers changed their minds.\n\nKey line: Ask a Kenyan. Let's hope it’s not something offensive.\n\nWho is he?\n\nA Rebel Alliance officer during the short stay on the ice planet of Hoth who bears a striking resemblance to a certain Boston barfly…\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nBecause he’s played by the legendary John Ratzenberger, aka Cliff from Cheers, in an enormous pair of lime-green snow goggles and a pretty dashing ’tache. But it’s a tiny part, which is why almost nobody knows his name (sorry).\n\nKey line: ‘Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The shield doors must be closed. Now, who fancies a beer?’ (Okay, we added the last bit.)\n\nWho is he?\n\nAs his job title suggests, Malakili (his name, apparently) is the burly, leather-hatted slob hired by Jabba the Hutt to tend his captive man-eating monster, the infamous Rancor.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nBecause his weepy distress at the death of his beloved pet provides a moment of unexpected pathos in the midst of all the yelling and gunfire, reminding us that even the most mindless killing machine needs someone to love him/her/it.\n\nKey line: ‘Sobs!’\n\nWho is he?\n\nJabba the Hutt’s pet-cum-sidekick, a diseased little rodent with big ears, a ravenous black beak and one of the coolest names in the series. Imagine the psychotic, half-starved offspring of The Great Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nBecause he’s got a bad attitude, and he doesn’t care who knows it. None of Jabba’s ill-tempered pronouncements would be complete without a vicious little cackle from stage right, as Salacious gleefully rubs salt into the wound.\n\nKey line: ‘Ee-hee-hee-hee!’\n\nWho is she?\n\nThe wrinkly old Yoda-alike who runs the galaxy’s funkiest reggae party and fancies the pants off Chewbacca (or she would if he wore any).\n\nWhy do we love her?\n\nBecause she’s cheeky but mystical in the proudest Star Wars tradition, making saucy Wookiee jokes one minute and imparting the secrets of the universe the next. Her role may have been somewhat hacked to bits in The Force Awakens – she was supposed to stick around to the end, but JJ Abrams changed his mind – but what remains is enough to make her a firm favourite.\n\nKey line: ‘The Force, it's calling to you. Just let it in.’\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe Supreme Martial Commander of the Separatist Droid Armies, and a Dark Lord of the Sith to boot. In appearance, he’s a big skeletal robot with four arms and a pulsating heart. Not that he seems to use it much…\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nBecause he can fight with four lightsabers at once! Plus, he pre-empts Darth Vader by having a serious lung infection which causes him to cough and splutter like an 88-year-old asthmatic, which is actually scarier than it sounds.\n\nKey line: ‘I’ll enjoy crushing you!’\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe young freedom fighter whose revolutionary manifesto will – we assume - go on to inspire the Rebellion.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nBecause he’s a true rebel: a believer in justice, freedom, and all that woke-warrior stuff. His death during the escape from Aldhani was a tragic loss – but his words will live on, thanks to his cohort Cassian Andor and the rest of the Rebel Alliance.\n\nKey line: ‘Oppression is the mask of fear. Remember that.’\n\nWho are they?\n\nJabba the Hutt’s house band, consisting of flop-eared keyboard legend Rebo, shaved-mole clarinettist Droopy McCool and female-testicle-on-legs Sy Snootles.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nTo be fair, it was a close call between this combo and equally smokin’ Star Wars egg-heads Figrin D’an and the Modal Nodes. In the end, Rebo’s outfit won the battle of the bands because they were so egregiously ‘updated’ for the Special Edition, transformed from giants of interstellar funk to a hideously CG-mogrified soul-blues outfit. According to online sources, their original name was Evar Orbus and his Galactic Jizz-Wailers (honestly!), so lucky escape there.\n\nKey line: ‘Lapti nek, rat a ran wim joct co jappi qaff!’\n\nWho are they?\n\nLuke Skywalker’s long-suffering relatives (though not, as it turns out, by blood). Owen is basically a grumpy Ken Loach character removed to the far reaches of space, while Beru is his loyal partner and drudge whose only reward is to be unceremoniously burned by stormtroopers and left out in the sun to smoulder.\n\nWhy do we love them?\n\nIn Revenge of the Sith and the Obi-Wan Kenobi series they seem like a fairly contented young couple, happy to take little Luke under their protective wing. But, by the time of Star Wars, they’re weatherbeaten, world-weary and have managed to age about six decades in less than two. There’s a story there.\n\nKey line: ‘Luke’s just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.’\n\nWho is she? The plucky, slightly grating orange-skinned teenage Padawan from the Clone Wars animated series, now all grown up, and kicking exiled ex-Imperial ass in her very own live-action show.\n\nWhy do we love her? As an adult, Ahsoka embodies the grace and power of the Force: she’s fluid and dynamic in battle; wise and thoughtful in repose. She’s a natural leader, a wise master, and that move she pulled with the hyperspace whales was genuinely awesome. Plus, it helps that she’s played by the mighty Rosario Dawson, who we’d happily watch reading the phone book.\n\nKey line: ‘Surrender, or face the consequences.’\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe first character to transfer from a Star Wars TV franchise (The Clone Wars) to the big screen, Saw is a Rebel extremist who takes no prisoners (or takes prisoners, then does horrible things to them) in his efforts to fight the Empire.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nIn Rogue One and Andor, Saw and his breakaway Rebel crew are basically al-Qaeda in space, dedicated to battling the darkness by any means necessary. His cyborg suit (designed by the same folks who did Darth Vader, apparently) and wheezy, twitchy vibe may seem sinister, but Saw is on the side of the angels – just about.\n\nKey line: ‘Save the Rebellion! Save the dream!’\n\nWho is he?\n\nDarth Tyranus, a Dark Lord of the Sith who takes centre stage in Palpatine’s evil efforts to topple the Galactic Senate.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nBecause he’s played by horror legend, pagan priest and death-metal pioneer Christopher Lee, and there’s no greater reason than that. Also because he engages in a thrilling, intermittently hilarious lightsaber battle against Yoda, who is approximately a quarter of his size. We were slightly disappointed when he got knocked off right at the start of Revenge of the Sith, though.\n\nKey line: ‘It is obvious that this contest cannot be decided by our knowledge of the Force... but by our skills with a lightsaber.’\n\nWho is she?\n\nLando Calrissian’s robot sidekick (with benefits)? In ‘Solo: A Star Wars Story’, L3 is the co-pilot of the Millennium Falcon – and she’s a brassy, opinionated droid-rights activist who makes no secret of her affections for her human boss.\n\nWhy do we love her?\n\nBecause she brings a bizarre, completely unexpected edge of non-traditional sexuality to the Star Wars saga, implying that in this universe, the relationship between man and machine might not be as innocent and functional as we’d always assumed. Oh, and she’s voiced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge from Fleabag.\n\nKey line: ‘You don’t want to press that button with me.’\n\nWho is she?\n\nThe noble ice maiden of the saga, a Galactic Senator turned leader of the Rebel Alliance. Imagine Margaret Thatcher if she hadn’t turned to the dark side.\n\nWhy do we love her?\n\nBecause her chilly, aristocratic exterior masks a heart of pure revolutionary fire. From making enormous personal sacrifices to kickstart the Rebellion to masterminding the final victory at Endor, Mon is unflinching in her commitment to the cause of Galactic justice.\n\nKey line: ‘I show you the stone in my hand, you miss the knife at your throat.’\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe phlegmatic Rodian bounty hunter whom Han Solo abruptly, unceremoniously executes in the Tatooine bar Mos Eisley Cantina – and don’t let anyone tell you different.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nPartly because of all the controversy surrounding his death, after George Lucas added a premature laser blast in order to soften Han Solo’s prickly character. But also because he’s got huge, glassy green eyes, a fantastically otherworldly, insectoid voice and is one of the more convincingly realised patrons of that most wretched hive of scum and villainy.\n\nKey line: ‘I’ve been looking forward to this for a long time.’ Famous last words.\n\nWho is he?\n\nLuke Skywalker’s childhood buddy, a red-hot pilot with an absolutely cracking ’tache and the insouciant manner of an old-Hollywood matinee idol.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nBecause the bond between Biggs and Luke represents the link between George Lucas’s own California childhood and his galaxy far, far away. Luke and Biggs are essentially American Graffiti characters gone awol, and the decision to cut most of their scenes together, while justifiable in pacing terms, slices some of the heart out of the first movie. We urge readers to check out these deleted scenes and discover the hero who got left on the cutting room floor. See also: Deak, Windy, Camie and Fixer.\n\nKey line: ‘The rebellion is spreading, and I wanna be on the side I believe in.’\n\nWho is she?\n\nThe plucky Resistance technician who convinces Finn not to jump ship and ends up joining him on a wild ride from the casino city of Canto Bight to the heart of a First Order star destroyer.\n\nWhy do we love her?\n\nBecause she’s the beating heart of the Resistance: a former slave who has dedicated herself to liberating the galaxy from the clutches of the First Order. Because Kelly Marie Tran’s performance is just lovely. And because she was so cruelly sidelined in The Rise of Skywalker, seemingly in order to placate the very worst fans in the universe (though, of course, this has been hotly denied).\n\nKey line: ‘We’re going to win this war not by fighting what we hate but saving what we love.’\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe dashing matinee-idol flyboy in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, General Leia’s trusted emissary who flees the First Order, miraculously escapes death and returns to lead the X-Wing charge against Starkiller Base.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nBecause he’s an old-school charmer, the rightful heir to Biggs Darklighter and Lando Calrissian. Because he winds up the Empire no end at the start of The Last Jedi, with a comedy routine straight out of Abbott and Costello. Oh, and let’s not forget his smoking-hot runway run-in with Finn.\n\nKey line: ‘I can fly anything.’\n\nWho is she?\n\nThe scariest Star Wars villain since the Emperor: a fascist functionary with a great line in withering scowls.\n\nWhy do we love her?\n\nWho really makes the Empire work? Is it powerful Sith warriors like Palpatine and Vader – or is it an army of devious little sadists like Dedra? With her crisp uniform and clipped, (inevitably) British accent, it’s Dedra’s unswerving commitment to the Imperial principles of law and order that make her an all-too-recognisable villain.\n\nKey line: ‘The very worst thing you can do right now is bore me.’\n\nWho is she?\n\nDoomed Queen of Naboo, member of the Galactic Senate, wife of the traitor Anakin Skywalker, mother of two kids she’ll never get to see and owner of the weirdest make-up box in the known universe.\n\nWhy do we love her?\n\nOkay, so Amidala’s not the snap-talking, blaster-wielding hardass that her daughter turns out to be, but she’s still a fascinating character, bred in tradition but not tied to it, and in love with a man she must suspect is destined to go badly off the rails. Natalie Portman’s performance is hamstrung by some fist-chewing dialogue, but there are moments where Amidala’s strength shines through.\n\nKey line: ‘I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee!’\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe commander of the Rebel armada during the Battle of Endor, piscine member of the absurdly named Mon Calamari species and deliverer of one of the series’ truly great lines.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nBecause he looks like an enormous goggle-eyed trout, stands in a slightly camp hands-on-hips fashion and talks like he’s just swallowed a mouthful of Coke. Plus he has a funky extendable chair that allows him to zip about the command centre like that old sci-fi puppet Joe 90.\n\nKey line: All together now: ‘It’s a trap!’\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe doomed, rotund X-wing pilot who refuses to eject (where would he eject to, exactly?) and gets splattered all over the Death Star.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nLet us count the ways. Firstly, because he’s the only non-evil fat guy in the Star Wars universe, which counts for something when you’re 12. Secondly, because he covers Biggs at great risk to his own safety. And thirdly, because he’s played by the eternally underrated William Hootkins, a remarkable and much-missed character actor whose career spanned everything from Blackadder to Batman.\n\nKey line: ‘No, I’m all r-aaaaagh!\n\nWho is he?\n\nTop dog on the Death Star, holder of Darth Vader’s leash and a man perfectly willing to destroy an entire planet just to make a point.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nWell, the fact that he’s played by the legendary Peter Cushing does not hurt a bit (let's just forget about that uncanny-valley Rogue One recreation, shall we?). But leaving his immaculate thespian heritage aside, Tarkin is still pretty nails: he looks like he smokes about 50 a day, he’s got a whole chest full of medals and that little cock-of-the-head just before his beloved battle station goes kaboom is simply priceless. Plus, he’s a Grand Moff. Who else do you know who’s a Grand Moff?\n\nKey line: ‘Terminate her! Immediately!’\n\nWho is he?\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi’s tutor, and the only sap on the Jedi Council who believes that Anakin Skywalker is anything more than a whole heap of trouble in a bowlcut.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nPrincipally, because of his matchless lightsaber skills, classy way with a mystical one-liner and facial resemblance to that fine actor, Liam Neeson. But also because it was here that folks first began to notice the phenomenon of the Jedi beard – well trimmed, very presentable and just like the one George Lucas happens to have. We’re still not convinced by all that guff about midi-chlorians (some sort of microscopic microbe), but we’ll let it go for now.\n\nKey line: ‘Remember: your focus determines your reality.’ Eh?\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe ultimate bounty hunter and ruthless outlaw who roamed the Galactic wastes taking on dirty jobs for healthy rewards, until he was almost consumed by the monstrous Sarlacc – since when he’s gone (sort of) straight.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nBoba Fett exemplifies the battle between OG Star Wars and the expansion beyond the original trilogy. Initially, the appeal of this battered, taciturn mystery man was ineffable, but inescapable: perhaps it was his dented costume or the fact that he’s one of the few characters who backchats Darth Vader, but the fans adored him. But the disappointing Disney+ series The Book of Boba Fett softened his image, turning this gun-for-hire with a heart of steel into something of a misunderstood hero.\n\nKey line: ‘He’s no good to me dead.’\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe almost unbearably delightful pint-sized force-wielde better known to his legions of fans (and toy retailers) as Baby Yoda.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nThe entire world went crazy for this tiny green cockle-warming machine, and rightly so. There have been cute critters in Star Wars before – porgs, ewoks, Jake Lloyd – but they’re just so much bantha poodoo next to this little bundle of joy.\n\nKey line: No lines, just adorable little squeaks, grunts, blinks, nose-wrinkles, ear-twitches, and, oh God, we can’t even handle it.\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe wayward son of Han Solo and Princess Leia, who turned to the Dark Side during his Jedi training and went on to get in an almighty teenage piss about everything in the universe.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nBecause he’s just a big stroppy kid, albeit one with 1,000 armoured legions and a planet-shattering death laser at his disposal. The scenes between Kylo and Rey are the most dramatic and convincing in the sequel trilogy, from their first encounter in the torture chamber to their final, tragic farewell.\n\nKey line: ‘Wait! I can show you the power of the Dark Side!’\n\nWho is he?\n\nThis dark lord of the Sith was by far the most exciting new character in The Phantom Menace, thanks to his crazy Cirque du Soleil facepaint, acid-yellow eyes and double-ended lightsaber.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nIt’s not just about the look, though that is spectacularly cool. As played by martial artist Ray Park – and not overlooking some sterling, skin-crawling voice work from the mighty Peter Serafinowicz – Darth Maul is a sinuous sadist, and we can’t help thinking the prequel series would’ve been improved by keeping him alive a bit longer.\n\nKey line: ‘Die, Jedi, die!’\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe Mandalorian, of course – or just ‘Mando’ to his friends, which probably isn’t you. The steely-helmeted, icy-voiced hero of Disney+’s most popular Star Wars series, and the guy with the most adorable sidekick in the universe (see No. 17)\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nBecause he’s just so effortlessly cool. Starting out as a (figuratively) bare-faced Clint Eastwood clone, Din has developed over three series to become not just a surrogate Dad to cute little Grogu, but the deliverer of his people from years spent in exile.\n\nKey line: ‘This is the way.’\n\nWho is he?\n\nA gleaming golden god to some, a deeply annoying buzz-kill to others, protocol droid Threepio is fluent in over 6,000,000 forms of communication, and boy does he love to go on about it.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nIf Threepio had restricted himself to the original Star Wars trilogy he’d be higher on this list: his appearances in those movies, whether it’s berating R2-D2 for his obstinacy, interrupting Han Solo mid-snog or awkwardly buddying up to Jabba the Hutt, are consistently funny. But the prequel trilogy tended to use him as an automatic gag generator, punctuating the action with inappropriate asides (‘this is such a drag!’), while the sequel films didn’t find much for him to do at all. Also, how did a slave boy on a remote desert world manage to build a droid that knows 6,000,000 languages?\n\nKey line: ‘We’re doomed.’\n\nWho is she?\n\nA classic Star Wars character: the young orphan with a hidden past who dreams of escape from her drab, backwater existence.\n\nWhy do we love her?\n\nBecause she’s like something out of an old-fashioned British kids adventure novel: plucky, proud and a bit posh, with nerves of steel and a whip-smart mouth. The way she ‘handles’ John Boyega’s Finn is hilarious, while her unravelling, star-crossed relationship with Kylo Ren is just heartbreaking. Just try and ignore all that nonsense about her parentage.\n\nKey line: ‘Something inside me has always been there. But now it's awake. And I'm afraid.’\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe ultimate charmer, a ramblin’, gamblin’ man who turns his back on his crooked, card-sharping ways to pursue a respectable career as a mining administrator and, ultimately, a Rebel Alliance hero.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nYes, Lando was written into the series after complaints about the absence of black characters in ‘Star Wars’. And yes, accusations of tokenism are hard to refute (his initial characterisation as a treacherous, womanising sleazebag didn’t help). But look deeper and Calrissian’s matinee-idol charm and un-Star Wars-like moral ambiguity make him one of the most intriguing figures in the series.\n\nKey line: ‘Here goes nothing!’\n\nWho is she?\n\nThe daughter of the man who made the Death Star possible, and a street-smart tough cookie in her own right. When she’s recruited by the Rebel Alliance to find her Pops and steal the plans, she signs up even though it could mean her life.\n\nWhy do we love her?\n\nJyn might be the first ‘Star Wars’ heroine for whom gender simply isn’t an issue: there’s no romantic subplot, no gold bikini and no ‘isn’t she bossy?’ jokes. She’s just hard as nails: a tight-lipped, no-nonsense ass-kicker who refuses to let her Daddy issues get in the way of seeing the mission through.\n\nKey line: ‘Let's just get this over with, shall we?’\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe rootless, nameless First Order stormtrooper and part-time plumbing technician who has a crisis of conscience on manoeuvres on Jakku, rescues Resistance maverick Poe Dameron and sets out to find his way in this big ol’ universe.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nBecause he’s our wide-eyed guide to the eye-frazzling wonders of the sequel trilogy, desperately trying to come across as cool and collected while permanently panicking on the inside. And also because he’s played by John Boyega, an actor who muscled his way to the top through a combination of goofy charm and steely toughness – perfect for the character of a child soldier who smashed his chains and went rogue. However, like his pal Rose Tico, Finn’s sidelining in the last movie wasn’t just lazy, it was downright insulting.\n\nKey quote: ‘The name’s Finn. And I’m in charge.’\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe hero, of course! Luke is the clean-livin’, hard-workin’, elders-respectin’, sister-kissin’, all-American boy from Tatooine whose adventures form the backbone of the original Star Wars trilogy. Yes, his return in The Last Jedi was rather more downbeat, but he did manage to rally his strength and face evil one last time…\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nC’mon! He’s the ultimate family-friendly adventure hero: kind to animals and droids, good at fighting, flying spaceships, swinging across chasms and doing the right thing. Mark Hamill’s performance is consistently intelligent, heartfelt and witty, and Luke never comes close to crossing that line between upstanding hero and annoying goody-goody.\n\nKey line: ‘I care!’\n\nWho is he?\n\nA cheeky, level-headed dustbin on legs who comes complete with an Inspector Gadget-like array of convenient little nozzles and appendages. Think Henry the Hoover meets a Swiss army knife, only with personality.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nBecause he’s the real hero of the Star Wars movies, consistently getting the others out of trouble just when things look their bleakest. From juggling turbolifts on an enemy battleship to fixing Luke’s X-Wing stabilisers during the first Death Star run, from mending the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon to cutting his way out of an Ewok trap, Artoo does all the hard galaxy-saving work and gets precious little credit. Without him, the Imperial forces would be ruling the galaxy and Luke, Leia, Han and Chewie would be little more than glutinous splodges on the inside wall of a trash compactor.\n\nKey line: Concerned uh-oh type beep, as if to say, ‘here we go again’.\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe evil mastermind behind the Imperial takeover of the galaxy. Initially, Palpatine is a seemingly trustworthy senator who guards a terrible secret: he’s actually a Sith Lord, master of evil. Later, he’s a wizened little wizard with the wickedest cackle this side of the Yellow Brick Road.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nBecause he’s one of the few characters who actually gets deeper and more interesting in the prequel trilogy. Palpatine’s transition from avuncular politician to devious power-grabber to lightning-fingered madman to all-powerful galactic dictator is deliriously enjoyable, and actor Ian McDiarmid works tirelessly to squeeze every ounce of lunatic glee from each successive, excessive incarnation (though the less said about his unasked-for reappearance in The Rise of Skywalker, the better). By the climactic battle in Return of the Jedi, Palpatine has become something genuinely creepy: a nightmarish man-crone whose seemingly bottomless capacity for hate makes him the most memorable bad guy in the series – bar one.\n\nKey line: ‘I am defenceless. Take your weapon. Strike me down with all of your hatred and your journey towards the Dark Side will be complete!’\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe diminutive backwards-talking mystical muppet whose knowledge of the Force is second to none. In the original trilogy he’s a marvel of creature design: tactile, sympathetic and loveable. His CGI incarnation in The Phantom Menace looks like a rubber troll sprung unnervingly to life, though this does improve somewhat over the next two movies.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nHe’s Yoda! Eight hundred years old and still going strong, master of telekinesis and mystical philosophy, a whizz with a lightsaber who also has a wicked sense of humour and an odd fascination for pocket torches.\n\nEverything about him is iconic: that idiosyncratic manner of speech, that unique raspy voice (supplied by Frank Oz, so the similarity to Miss Piggy is understandable), the peerless puppet work. Even the way he bounces off the walls during his ridiculous lightsaber battle is kind of amazing.\n\nKey line: ‘Do, or do not. There is no try.’\n\nWho is he?\n\nA seven-foot walking carpet with natural furry flares, a resistance-chic bandolier and a vocal repertoire consisting of barks, rumbles and surprisingly-hard-to-imitate growls. Co-pilot of the Millennium Falcon, Chewie is another of those ‘Star Wars’ characters who inspires a deep devotion despite his inability to speak – in English, at least.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nBecause he’s the perfect man: tall, hirsute, fashionable, tough, endlessly loyal, a bit of a joker, a crack shot with a crossbow, an expert driver, great at spaceship DIY and we reckon he probably gives the best hugs in the universe. What woman wouldn’t want a partner this hardworking, affectionate and dashing? Sure, those heart-to-heart chats might be slightly hard work, but perhaps this is what they mean by ‘sweet nothings’.\n\nKey line: His dismayed howl when the Echo Base doors slam shut against the Hoth night is heartbreaking.\n\nWho is he? From thrusting young Jedi hero to desert-wandering retainer to shimmering blue apparition, Obi-Wan is either the selfless, beating heart of the entire ‘Star Wars’ saga, or a one-man walking support network for the accident-prone Skywalker family. Still, like the man said, many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.\n\nWhy do we love him? Because he’s absolutely ruthless with a lightsaber. Because his shades-of-beige wardrobe is both functional and stylish. Because he wears a trimmed beard with boundless elan. Because he spent two decades hanging out in a desert without a word of complaint. Because he made the undeniably ballsy move of hiding Luke Skywalker in the exact place where his father would look for him first, and didn’t even bother to change the kid’s last name. And, of course, because he’s played by two very fine actors, including perhaps the greatest thespian ever to emerge from this sceptred isle: Sir Alec Guinness.\n\nKey line: ‘If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine.’\n\nWho is she? The proud face of the Rebel Alliance: a beautiful, sarcastic, blaster-packing, man-juggling, no-bullshit-taking, Danish-pastry-haircut wearing icon of womanhood.\n\nWhy do we love her? Token female she may initially have been, but Leia is actually the most shaded, complex character in the original trilogy – or at least, the first two movies. As a very public figure working for an outlawed cause, she’s got a lot more at stake than either of her flyboy toyboys. And as a woman in a man’s universe she stands her ground at every turn – see how she faces down both Tarkin and Vader without breaking a sweat. Later, we learned that she spent time as a kid hanging out with Obi-Wan Kenobi, but then forgot to ever mention it to anyone.\n\nKey line: ‘I am not a committee!’\n\nWho is he?\n\nCaptain of the Millennium Falcon and cockiest space pilot in the galaxy. Han Solo is every boy’s hero, cruising from star system to star system with his hairy BFF, getting into scrapes, shooting the place up, performing occasional acts of random heroism and being rude to women until they fall madly in love with him.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nIt’s damn near impossible not to. His hair is great, his Bogart-cowboy-hipster outfit is legendary, his wisecracks are second to none and his lop-sided grin has broken a million hearts on a thousand worlds. But there’s more to it, somehow: in The Empire Strikes Back, Lawrence Kasdan’s crackling, old-Hollywood dialogue combines with Harrison Ford’s insouciance as a performer to elevate Han to a place few other movie heroes ever reach, creating a vital bond between character and audience.\n\nFord’s importance to the enigma that is Han was thrown into sharp relief by the arrival of spin-off story Solo, in which Alden Ehrenreich tried to make the character his own and failed spectacularly, despite being a perfectly serviceable actor. To many of us, Han’s ultimate end in The Force Awakens came as a real body blow: losing him was like losing an old friend. A friend with a really, really cool spaceship.\n\nKey line: ‘I know.’\n\nWho is he?\n\nWe don’t think it’s going too far to suggest that here is the single most iconic screen villain of all time: his appearance is terrifying, his voice bone-chilling, his words pure, dripping evil. But what really turns Darth into the stuff of our childhood nightmares are his actions: from snapping necks left and right – both in person and remotely – to cutting off his own son’s hand (let’s just let that one sink in for a moment), this is a guy who really, really shouldn’t be trifled with.\n\nWhy do we love him?\n\nBecause movies are full of sarcastic space pilots, pistol-packing princesses, upstanding blonde heroes, robot sidekicks and wise old wizards, but there will only ever be one Darth Vader. His backstory is slightly challenging – young Anakin can be pretty hard work, though his descent into evil is convincingly handled and the fiery battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan Kenobi is operatically magnificent.\n\nBut it’s nothing next to Darth’s greatest hits: lightsabering a platoon of Rebel soldiers without so much as a shrug; tuning up his TIE-fighter controls like a snooker player chalking his cue; throttling his commanders one by one like the expendable flies they are; revealing the truth to Luke on that rickety gantry; turning on his former master as unearthly electricity howls in the bones of his face; and finally, heartbreakingly, lying stretched out on that medieval pyre as black smoke wreathes around his broken corpse. He is a perfect creation, never to be improved upon. Darth, we tremblingly salute you.\n\nKey line: ‘If you only knew the power of the Dark Side.’"
