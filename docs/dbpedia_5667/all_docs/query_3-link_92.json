        "text": "This is an unabridged version of the Review of 2010 published in the January 2011 issue of Sight & Sound\n\nJump to a contributor:\n\nGeoff Andrew Michael Atkinson Robin Baker James Bell Peter Biskind Anton Bitel Nick Bradshaw Peter Bradshaw Nicole Brenez Edward Buscombe Dave Calhoun Dylan Cave Tom Charity Ian Christie Michel Ciment Roger Clarke Pam Cook Kieron Corless Mark Cousins Chris Darke Thomas Dawson Maria Delgado Mar Diestro-Dópido The Ferroni Brigade William Fowler Philip French Chris Fujiwara Graham Fuller Charles Gant Leonardo Garcia-Tsao Charlotte Garson Ryan Gilbey Jane Giles Carmen Gray Peter Hames Nick Hasted Sophie Ivan Kevin Jackson Nick James David Jenkins Kent Jones Philip Kemp Edward Lawrenson Mark Le Fanu Colin MacCabe Geoffrey Macnab Lee Marshall Adrian Martin Demetrios Matheou Sophie Mayer Hannah McGill Henry K. Miller James Mottram Lisa Mullen Kim Newman Hannah Patterson Vic Pratt Naman Ramachandran Nicolas Rapold Tony Rayns Tim Robey Nick Roddick Jonathan Romney Jonathan Rosenbaum Sukhdev Sandhu Jasper Sharp Anna Smith Paul Julian Smith Fernando Solórzano Brad Stevens Isabel Stevens Heather Stewart Vlastimir Sudar Amy Taubin David Thompson Daniel Trilling Kenneth Turan Ginette Vincendeau Catherine Wheatley Armond White Sam Wigley Sergio Wolf Jason Wood Adrian Wootton Barbara Wurm\n\nGeoff Andrew\n\nHead of film programme, BFI Southbank, UK\n\nAurora\n\nCristi Puiu, Romania / France / Switzerland / Germany\n\nThis follow-up to The Death of Mr Lazarescu is one of the most uncompromisingly rigorous films of the year, an often defiantly taciturn, even uneventful study of a day and a half in the life of a man who also happens to take the lives of others.\n\nCertified Copy (Copie conforme)\n\nAbbas Kiarostami, France/Italy/Belgium\n\nThe Iranian master’s most ‘commercial’ movie (it stars Juliette Binoche and might be seen as a Tuscany-set love story) refuses easy readings even after repeat viewings. Full of ambiguities, absences, ironies and intentional inconsistencies, it’s a teasing (if finally affecting) film in the conditional: what if?\n\nNostalgia for the Light (Nostalgia de la luz)\n\nPatricio Guzmán, France/Germany/Chile\n\nAstronomy, archaeology, Chilean history and politics – Guzmán’s sly, measured essay excavates all manner of things on its deeply humane mission to place the pain of personal loss within a far wider philosophical context. Amazingly, he succeeds.\n\nOf Gods and Men (Des hommes et des dieux)\n\nXavier Beauvois, France\n\nYou want straightforward narrative? This is it – though Beauvois’ taken-from-life account of a North African monastery threatened by Muslim fundamentalists avoids thriller cliché to provide a subtly insightful, ultimately moving study of fear, faith and fatal intolerance.\n\nPoetry (Si)\n\nLee Changdong, South Korea\n\nThe title tells all, evoking both the story (a woman takes to writing verse as her grandson is implicated in a girl’s suicide) and tone of Lee’s exquisite film. Seamlessly conjoining many themes, it benefits from one of the year’s best performances, from Yun Junghee.\n\nHighlights:\n\nIn a year with an unusually experimental Palme d’Or-winner, Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, I also found three other admirably audacious but accessible films particularly rewarding: José María de Orbe’s Father (Aita), Michelangelo Frammartino’s Le quattro volte and Lodge Kerrigan’s Rebecca H. (Return to the Dogs) – all engagingly mysterious, cinematically witty and emotionally affecting, as well as being philosophically and formally fascinating.\n\nOtherwise, Manoel de Oliveira’s Rite of Spring (Acto da primavera, 1963) was for me the restoration of the year, while Bernardo Bertolucci’s intelligent, often very funny onstage interview at BFI Southbank in October was a joyous celebration of cinephilia and filmmaking.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nMichael Atkinson\n\nCritic, USA\n\nThe Red Riding Trilogy\n\nJulian Jarrold, James Marsh & Anand Tucker, UK\n\nA Prophet (Un prophète)\n\nJacques Audiard, France/Italy\n\nDogtooth (Kynodontas)\n\nYorgos Lanthimos, Greece\n\nI Am Love (Io sono l’amore)\n\nLuca Guadagnino, Italy\n\nMother\n\nBong Joon-ho, South Korea\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nRobin Baker\n\nHead curator, BFI National Film Archive, UK\n\nAnother Year\n\nMike Leigh, UK\n\nAnother reminder that Leigh is, contrary to popular belief, the great humanist of contemporary cinema and that Ruth Sheen is without peer.\n\nThe Arbor\n\nClio Barnard, UK\n\nAlong with new films from Sarah Turner, Carol Morley and Joanna Hogg, Barnard underlined the rude health of creative vision in contemporary British filmmaking.\n\nStill Walking (Aruitemo, Aruitemo)\n\nKore-eda Hirokazu, Japan\n\nWinter’s Bone\n\nDebra Granik, USA\n\nA Prophet (Un prophète)\n\nJacques Audiard, France/Italy\n\n[If everyone included this last year, then my vote goes to:\n\nLourdes\n\nJessica Hausner, Austria/Germany/France]\n\nHighlights:\n\nThe BFI’s restoration of Hepworth and Stow’s Alice in Wonderland(1903) became an improbable YouTube hit. The sense of awe and delighted incredulity it provoked among viewers more likely to seek out videos of sneezing baby pandas was inspiring.\n\nSitting with an audience in Beijing as Xie Fei discussed the experience of filming Black Snow (1989) in Tiananmen Square during the Tiananmen ‘event’ was revelatory – not just about the director’s work, but about contemporary China too.\n\nAs I watched Herbert Ponting’s The Great White Silence (1924), its original tinting and toning finally restored, his haunting images of Scott’s ill-fated expedition to the Antarctic glowed once again like stained glass.\n\nThe two films that made me weep were Toy Story 3 and John Krish’sThey Took Us to the Sea (1961). Both masterful and both in their very different ways about the end of childhood.\n\nObserving two of our leading directors on a visit to the National Film Archive poring over Carol Reed’s annotated shooting script for The Third Man like boys encountering the Holy Grail was a joy.\n\nWatching the only copy of Ken Loach’s 1971 documentary made for Save the Children, which is prevented from leaving the vaults of the BFI National Archive by a court injunction. I was privileged to discover that it’s every bit as brilliant, provocative and formally radical as you could possibly hope or expect.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nJames Bell\n\nSight & Sound\n\nAurora\n\nCristi Puiu, Romania / France / Switzerland / Germany\n\nThe Autobiography of Nicolae Ceausescu\n\nAndrei Ujica, Romania\n\nPoetry (Si)\n\nLee Changdong, South Korea\n\nThe Social Network\n\nDavid Fincher, USA\n\nUncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (Lung Boonmee raluek chat)\n\nApichatpong Weerasethakul, Thailand / UK / France / Germany / Spain / Netherlands / USA\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nPeter Biskind\n\nAuthor/critic, USA\n\nThe Social Network\n\nDavid Fincher, USA\n\nWinter’s Bone\n\nDebra Granik, USA\n\nI always find it exciting to discover a new, gifted filmmaker, even one who’s new just to me, and I so admired Winter’s Bone that I checked out Granik’s first feature Down to the Bone, and liked it almost as much. It’s so hard to make drug films these days (this one was released in 2004) without falling into all the clichés that have nearly destroyed the genre, but Granik succeeds. She’s a really fine director – I wish she was more productive.\n\nMade in Dagenham\n\nNigel Cole, UK\n\nThe King’s Speech\n\nTom Hooper, UK/Australia\n\nAnother Year\n\nMike Leigh, UK\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nAnton Bitel\n\nAcademic and critic, UK\n\n1\n\nPater Sparrow, Hungary\n\nEnigmatic in form, encyclopedic in scope, and leaving room between its lines for many different readings, Sparrow’s truly singular film encapsulates the whole of human experience in eccentric, elliptical cross-section. It is all at once science fiction, political allegory, transcendental mystery and free-form documentary, recalling the early works of Peter Greenaway in its vast referential breadth, its mannered blurring of fact and fiction, and the beauty of its tableau-like images.\n\nRed White & Blue\n\nSimon Rumley, USA\n\nSimon Rumley’s slow-burning tripartite drama spirals inexorably towards parallel acts of misdirected vengeance, and in the ellipses and silences of its economic narrative lurk the darkest aspects of the American psyche, as well as a fine performance from Noah Taylor.\n\nWinter Vacation (Han jia)\n\nLi Hongqi, China\n\n“One day after another, it seems as if life never ends,” deadpans one of the bored young characters in the latest film by China’s answer to Jarmusch, Kaurismäki and Roy Andersson. Winter Vacation offers up the tedium and aimlessness of provincial life as a sly rejoinder to China’s post-Olympics image of progress and prosperity. It’s bleak, spare – and absurdly funny.\n\nAmer\n\nHélène Cattet & Bruno Forzani, France / Belgium\n\nCattet and Forzani have lovingly crafted this surrealist homage to the thematic preoccupations, visual stylings and musical cues of the 1970sgiallo. It’s an unnerving triptych in which conventional narrative has been replaced by nightmarish perspective, repressed urges and thrillingly tactile imagery.\n\nSkeletons\n\nNick Whitfield, UK\n\nNick Whitfield’s feature debut is a quirkily comic psychodrama of family, memory and loss, mixing Inception-style brain-bending tropes with Pythonesque English banality. Rarely is such high concept presented in so low a key; the result, for all its cultish oddity, is reassuringly human.\n\nHighlight:\n\nInterviewing Stanford professor Bernardo Huberman about using social networks to predict box-office revenue. A fascinating glimpse into the way that Web 2.0 both reflects and shapes our cinemagoing experience.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nNick Bradshaw\n\nSight & Sound\n\nNostalgia for the Light (Nostalgia de la luz)\n\nPatricio Guzmán, France / Germany / Chile\n\nLe quattro volte (Four Times)\n\nMichelangelo Frammartino, Italy / Germany / Switzerland)\n\nSamson & Delilah\n\nWarwick Thornton, Australia\n\nUncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (Lung Boonmee raluek chat)\n\nApichatpong Weerasethakul, Thailand / UK / France / Germany / Spain / Netherlands / USA\n\nCompline\n\nNathaniel Dorsky, USA\n\nHighlights:\n\nMainly treasures from the archives: Thierry Fremaux’s presentation of astonishingly pristine digitised Lumière films at Bologna’s Il Cinema Ritrovato festival; the DVD debut of Leo McCarey’s Make Way for Tomorrow (1937); the John Smith retrospective at the Royal College of Art, and Bill Morrison and Johán Johánsson’s Durham Cathedral premiere of their archive collage film The Miners’ Hymns.\n\nPlus ‘devotional cinema’ artist Nathaniel Dorsky’s show-and-tell at the London Cinema Museum in May, followed by the ambiguous pleasures of his of seeing his forced transition from discontinued Kodachrome reversal stock (with Compline) to colour negative (with Aubade) at his London Film Festival screening in the autumn.\n\nLondon Film Festival screenings of two of my CalArts teachers’ new works: Thom Andersen’s Get Out of the Car and James Benning’s Ruhr.\n\nProducing (on a shoestring) a strand of artists’ movies about trains for the Cambridge Film Festival.\n\nAnd – to blow our own trumpet – the unveiling of S&S’s first multimedia features, being an illustrated video interview with aboriginal Australian director Warwick Thornton and an audio conversation between enfants terribles Gaspar Noé and Harmony Korine, recorded by themselves. We’ve more up our sleeves…\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nPeter Bradshaw\n\nThe Guardian, UK\n\nKick-Ass\n\nMatthew Vaughn, UK / USA\n\nLike an intravenous injection of pure monosodium glutamate, Kick-Assdelivered a blast of energy, incorrectness and anarchy with a tale of adolescent wish-fulfilment that has genuinely captured the spirit of comic books in a way nothing else has. This was not a Hollywood studio picture, but it looked as if it was — and of the very best sort.\n\nThe Other Guys\n\nAdam McKay, USA\n\nThis brilliant frat-boy comedy triumphantly survived some critical condescension and dullness, and showed an admirable devotion simply to getting as many laughs as possible.\n\nUncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (Lung Boonmee raluek chat)\n\nApichatpong Weerasethakul, Thailand / UK / France / Germany / Spain / Netherlands / USA\n\nAt Cannes this year I was very pleased to see the top prize go to Apichatpong’s beautiful, mysterious and humorous fable, although his sudden elevation to more general attention appears to have caused a backlash in the French press.\n\nGaspar Noé, France / USA / Germany / Italy / Japan / Canada\n\nA Cannes 2009 favourite that belatedly got a UK release, Noé’s POV nightmare is a movie of considerable technical brilliance and flair.\n\nAnother Year\n\nMike Leigh, UK\n\nLeigh demonstrates a further refinement of his remarkable late period with this family-and-friends group portrait.\n\nHighlight:\n\nOne great pleasure of 2010 was the Frank Capra retrospective, which gave us relatively unconsidered gems like Forbidden — a film with Capra’s traditional yellow-press journalists and pork-barrel politicians, which allowed us to ponder how this, and other of his films, fed into the creation of Citizen Kane.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nNicole Brenez\n\nCritic, France\n\nDystopia Files Mark Tribe, USA\n\nA homage to the anonymous demonstrators who struggle against injustice day by day, this is a visual supplement to Howard Zinn’s book A People’s History of the United States.\n\nFilm socialisme\n\nJean-Luc Godard, Switzerland / France\n\nGodard’s speculative pyrotechnics cast light on a collective tragedy, the disaster of lost illusions. It fulfils the wish expressed in his earlierHistoire(s) du cinéma: “It’s high time that thought became once again what it is in reality: dangerous for the thinker and transformative of the real.”\n\nThe End of the World Starts With One Lie – First Part\n\nLech Kowalski, France/USA\n\nA brilliant deconstruction of Robert Flaherty’s Louisiana Story, this first section of a fresco focuses on the New Orleans oil spill.\n\nX+\n\nMarylène Negro, France\n\nWithout respite, cinema records silhouettes, groups, crowds, masses – fleeting passers-by of the era they’re crossing, walk-on parts bearing witness to the zeitgeist that carries them. X+ explores the visual and sonic forms of presence thanks to which the silver-emulsion imprints of the countless unknown human beings who make up the thread of humanity linger or dissolve.\n\nHighlight:\n\n‘Conversation avec un réalisateur israélien imaginé’ – a week in April curated by Akram Zaatari with Avi Mograbi at the Laboratoires d’Aubervilliers, France – transcended the double censorships of Lebanon and of Israel, two countries at war, creating a temporary zone of freedom – and cleverness.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nEdward Buscombe\n\nCritic, UK\n\nA Prophet (Un prophète)\n\nJacques Audiard, France/Italy\n\nA Prophet has some of the virtues of the prison dramas Hollywood made in its heyday, like Riot in Cell Block 11, but updated to the present where the prison’s racial mix generates a particularly pungent aggression and tension. Tahar Rahim is brilliant as the young criminal who, through intelligence and grit, works his way up the criminal pecking order.\n\nI Am Love (Io sono l’amore)\n\nLuca Guadagnino, Italy\n\nThe kind of Italian film they don’t seem to make any more – a tale of passion set amid the narcissistic, frigid upper class, a subject that harks back to the great days of Italian cinema dominated by Antonioni, Fellini and Visconti.\n\nThe Ghost (The Ghost Writer)\n\nRoman Polanski, France/Germany/UK\n\nA welcome return to form for Polanski, with a cunningly constructed tale of dirty deeds in high places, which irresistibly invites one to speculate on the connection with recent political events. Shot on a bleakly evocative wintry coastline, with a terrific performance by Ewan McGregor as the eponymous ghost writer, it’s a film with old-fashioned solid virtues.\n\nWhite Material\n\nClaire Denis, France/Cameroon\n\nIsabelle Huppert (superb as always) is the owner of a coffee plantation in an unnamed African country, threatened with disaster by the chaos around her during a civil war. A disturbing film, its characters are menaced by forces neither they nor we can really understand.\n\nAnother Year\n\nMike Leigh, UK\n\nThe latest of Leigh’s studies of happiness and the lack of it. Generous yet not indulgent to its characters, it’s a film during which one can find oneself changing one’s mind about which characters are most to be pitied and most to be admired. Ironic that the UK Film Council should have saved the best for last.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nTime Out London, UK\n\nAnother Year\n\nMike Leigh, UK\n\nDogtooth (Kynodontas)\n\nYorgos Lanthimos, Greece\n\nExit Through the Gift Shop\n\nBanksy, UK\n\nThe Arbor\n\nClio Barnard, UK\n\nThe Mouth of the Wolf (La Bocca del lupo)\n\nPietro Marcello, Italy/France\n\nHighlights:\n\nA memorial screening at the Berlinale of Eric Rohmer’s Pauline à la plage, introduced by Michel Ciment and Frédéric Mitterrand; a late-night screening of Henri-Georges Clouzot’s The Wages of Fear, also in Berlin; Ken Loach’s rousing keynote speech at the LFF; the Fellini exhibition at Paris’s Jeu de Paume gallery; Andrew Kötting’s ‘Swandown’ exhibit at the UCA campus, Farnham – a taster, hopefully, of a new film with Iain Sinclair; Ronald Harwood’s talk on screenwriting at BFI Southbank; the release of Roman Polanski; the re-establishment of direct links between government and the BFI; the eating in I Am Love; the ecstatic lunacy ofBlack Swan; and the strange allure of a pregnant Isabelle Carré in Le Refuge.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nDylan Cave\n\nCurator (Fiction), BFI National Film Archive, UK\n\nBlack Death\n\nChristopher Smith, Germany / UK\n\nSmith and writer Dario Poloni’s gruesome tale about medieval crusaders is an honourable addition to British cinema’s folk-horror heritage. As with Smith’s previous film Triangle (2009), the action, tension and horror keep the viewer glued, but it’s the sticky moral universe that really involves.\n\nToy Story 3\n\nLee Unkrich, USA\n\nPixar took full advantage of our affection for familiar characters, manipulating it shamelessly. Ageing Woody and his friends by 15 years was a cruel master-stroke, reminding us that we’re all getting older – and making the inevitable final farewell ring unbearably true for any grown-up who once had a favourite toy.\n\nThe Market A Tale of Trade (Pazar)\n\nBen Hopkins, Germany / Kazakhstan / UK / Turkey\n\nA morality play about a young trader trying to navigate entrepreneurial success with a wavering moral compass, Hopkins’s Turkish-Azerbaijani drama finally got a UK release this year. It proved, yet again, the vitality and creativity of his unique imagination.\n\nMan on a Motorcycle\n\nJohn Maclean, UK\n\nBy shooting this short on a mobile phone, Maclean gave a fresh look to a familiar tale about a day in the life of a bored London courier. The resulting cramped and blurry aesthetic was surprisingly apt, conveying the courier’s heady rush as he travels around the city.\n\nHighlight:\n\nThe BFI National Archive was 75 this year and the anniversary celebrations included a revival of an annual lecture given in honour of the archive’s first curator. S&S contributor Christophe Dupin gave a fascinating introduction to the event, but it was Paolo Cherchi Usai who reminded us of the Lindgren Lecture’s significance, introducing an insightful and provocative manifesto on the role of film curators in the 21st century.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nTom Charity\n\nVancity Theatre program coordinator, Canada\n\nUncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (Lung Boonmee raluek chat)\n\nApichatpong Weerasethakul, Thailand / UK / France / Germany / Spain / Netherlands / USA\n\nNostalgia for the Light (Nostalgia de la luz)\n\nPatricio Guzmán, France / Germany / Chile\n\nCarlos\n\nOlivier Assayas, France / Germany / Belgium\n\nPoetry (Si)\n\nLee Changdong, South Korea\n\nCertified Copy (Copie conforme)\n\nAbbas Kiarostami, France / Italy / Belgium\n\nHighlights:\n\nWhat’s old is new again – in Arcade Fire’s interactive video ‘We Used to Wait’ the band patched into Google Maps Street View to connect the song’s lament for snail mail with each individual fan’s nostalgia for home. A brilliant stroke (even if it only got me within half a mile of the house I grew up in).\n\nIn the trailer for Tron: Legacy, Jeff Bridges comes face to face with his own youth – not a clip from the 1980 movie (which I never saw), but the actor’s digital avatar. The implications are dizzying. Maybe actresses will stop mutilating their flesh now. Maybe we won’t need any new actors at all. But I bet Bridges will be more compelling acting his true age in True Grit.\n\nWatching Gorillaz in concert in Vancouver with my 12-year-old son, he was wowed by the non-stop sub-Miyazaki anime that screened over the band (including cameos from Bruce Willis and Snoop Dogg). Fun, but no match for the sight of Bobby Womack right there on stage.\n\nSeeing 127 Hours after waiting two hours in line at the Toronto International Film Festival – because not all digital projectors are created equal, apparently. Maybe the wait actually improved the movie? With Toy Story 3, this was the best Hollywood movie of the year.\n\nSeeing – and hearing – Dziga Vertov’s Man with a Movie Camera with live accompaniment from the incomparable Alloy Orchestra. Reflecting that the child born in the explicit birth scene must over 80 now, if he survived the 20th century, and wondering if he ever saw this most modern of films. And if he did, did he know himself?\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nIan Christie\n\nProfessor of film history, Birkbeck, UK\n\nMysteries of Lisbon (Mistérios de Lisboa)\n\nRaúl Ruiz, Portugal\n\nRuiz returns triumphantly to the baroque dream world he creates better than anyone.\n\nHow I Ended This Summer (Kakya provel etim letom)\n\nAlexei Popogrebsky, Russia\n\nAn elemental cat-and-mouse psychodrama set in the frozen north, by one of Russia’s brightest new talents.\n\nRobinson in Ruins\n\nPatrick Keiller, UK\n\nThe third instalment of Keiller’s Robinsonade moves away from cities and docks to probe the English landscape with a steely yet moving intensity.\n\nTetro\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola, Argentina / Italy / Spain / USA\n\nCrazy and uneven, to say the least, but a reminder of what made Coppola so exciting as a ‘movie brat’, and a wonderful reinvention from a veteran.\n\nThe Nail in the Boot\n\nMikhail Kalatozov, 1931, USSR\n\nOne of this year’s Pordenone Festival highlights – the banned and believed-lost early feature by Kalatozov, famous for The Cranes are Flyingand I Am Cuba. Here was the same delirious cinematography already present in a propaganda piece that pulls out all the stops to hammer home its point.\n\nHighlights:\n\nThe soundtrack of Scorsese’s Shutter Island came as a total surprise, even to someone who’d followed the film’s making. An amazing anthology of 20th-century avant-garde music accompanies Teddy’s soul-searching mission, giving the paranoid imagery even greater edge and depth.\n\nAnother unexpected treat was the climax of Thierry Frémaux’s Lumière presentation at the Bologna Cinema Ritrovato festival. Louis Lumière always believed film should be in colour and stereoscopic, but actually to see the 3D projection he finally achieved in the 1930s, recreated on the Piazza Maggiore giant screen, was to be reminded that 3D is hardly a recent novelty – more like how it was always meant to be.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nMichael Ciment\n\nPositif, France\n\nThe Ditch (Jiabiangou)\n\nWang Bing, Hong Kong / France / Belgium\n\nThe famous documentary filmmaker (West of the Tracks) brings his sense of reality to depict the harrowing conditions of the life of the prisoners in this powerful rendering of the re-education camps in Mao’s China.\n\nPoetry (Si)\n\nLee Changdong, South Korea\n\nConfirming the exceptional talent of the South Korean director – and the vitality of Far East cinema – Poetry for me deserved to win the Palme d’Or in Cannes.\n\nSilent Souls (Ovsyanki)\n\nAleksei Fedorchenko, Russia\n\nA poetic vision of life which testifies to the new surge in Russian cinema.\n\nOf Gods and Men (Des hommes et des dieux)\n\nXavier Beauvois, France\n\nRecreates with warmth and gravity the fate of seven monks decapitated in an Algerian monastery.\n\nMysteries of Lisbon (Mistérios de Lisboa)\n\nRaúl Ruiz, Portugal\n\nOne of two great films originally produced for television this year (the other being Carlos), Mysteries of Lisbon is a masterpiece by Ruiz, shortened to four-and-a-half hours. Adapted from a 19th-century novel by Castelo Bronco, it would have made Visconti jealous. A rake becoming a monk, an anguished bastard child, a tortured wife and a castrating father are the protagonists of a romantic-surrealistic melodrama shot in gorgeous colours and constantly surprising by the twists of its plot and the inventive mise en scène.\n\nHighlight:\n\nA box-set of five DVDs distributed by Arte Editions brings back to life the films made in the 1980s by Pierre Etaix, a worthy heir of the slapstick tradition of Keaton and Tati.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nRoger Clarke\n\nCritic, UK\n\nUncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (Lung Boonmee raluek chat)\n\nApichatpong Weerasethakul, Thailand / UK / France / Germany / Spain / Netherlands / USA\n\nPoetry (Si)\n\nLee Changdong, South Korea\n\nMeek’s Cutoff\n\nKelly Reichardt, USA\n\nDown Terrace\n\nBen Wheatley, UK\n\nThe Kids Are All Right\n\nLisa Cholodenko, USA\n\nHighlights:\n\nSitting down to watch a VHS of Fred Kelemen’s Frost (1997) after finding it when moving house. I believe it’s still at the centre of litigation and remains unreleased, a forgotten masterpiece held to ransom by ownership issues.\n\nSeeing a late-night Friday screening of Noé’s Enter the Void was the most extraordinarily hallucinogenic and emotional experience, created by an appreciative younger audience.\n\nHappening to be at a private screening of Let Me In with the author John Ajvide Lindqvist – he had only seen it for the first time a few hours before, and sat down to watch it again. I couldn’t help sneaking glances to check on his pretty rapt expression.\n\nThe documentary William S. Burroughs: A Man Within took me back to the few days I spent with him in Kansas, and how we nearly went to shoot guns at a target range – until a Southern Gothic heatwave brought the winged insects out in swarms, covering the windows of the Civil War Hotel where I stayed in Lawrence.\n\nSeeing the restored version of Edward Yang’s four-hour epic A Brighter Summer Day (with no intermissions) remains my top highlight. It’s quite something to believe that a film only made in 1991 was in danger of being completely lost until Scorsese’s World Cinema Foundation stepped in.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nPam Cook\n\nAcademic, UK\n\nThe Killer Inside Me\n\nMichael Winterbottom, USA / UK / Sweden / France\n\nThe Road\n\nJohn Hillcoat, USA\n\nA Prophet (Un prophète)\n\nJacques Audiard, France / Italy\n\nA Town Called Panic (Panique au village)\n\nStéphane Aubier & Vincent Patar, Belgium / Luxembourg / France\n\nTetro\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola, Argentina / Italy / Spain / USA\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nKieron Corless\n\nSight & Sound\n\nUncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (Lung Boonmee raluek chat)\n\nApichatpong Weerasethakul, Thailand / UK / France / Germany / Spain / Netherlands / USA\n\nMnemosyne\n\nJohn Akomfrah, UK\n\nPutty Hill\n\nMatthew Porterfield, USA\n\nFestival\n\nJean-Claude Rousseau, France\n\nIm Schatten (In the Shadows)\n\nThomas Arslan, Germany\n\nHighlights:\n\nAny one of Larry Cohen’s hilarious introductory narratives to the films in his retrospective at the Viennale – great stand-up as well as a great filmmaker. Sample: “I’d leave your mobile phones switched on if I were you, so you can talk to your friends during the boring bits.”\n\nk-punk: the most incisive, stimulating writing on culture and politics on the internet.\n\nStuart Comer’s film programming at Tate Modern – constant surprises and delights.\n\nHong Sang-soo, Paradjanov and Paskaljevic retrospectives at the BFI Southbank.\n\nThe ongoing miracle of Manoel de Oliveira.\n\nThe Gábor Bódy video-magazine show at Southend’s excellent Focal Point Gallery, curated by George Clark – brilliant idea.\n\nDoc’s Kingdom at Serpa in Portugal, which is unquestionably my favourite festival anywhere. Showing just a handful of superbly programmed films on a particular theme (this year it was ‘The Archive Image’) allowed for two-hour Q&As with the directors afterwards. The session with Hartmut Bitomsky – lucid, nuanced, eye-opening – was my absolute cinemagoing highlight of this past year.\n\nPatrizio Guzmán’s Nostalgia for the Light was my most overwhelming experience in a cinema. A film that belongs in a category all by itself.\n\nThe Harun Farocki retrospective at Tate Modern (and his gallery show at Raven Row), curated by the always-fascinating Otolith Group – masterpiece after masterpiece, a revelation. As well as affording an opportunity to hear the great man speak, he also introduced us (or me at least) to another great German documentarian I’d never come across before, Klaus Wildenhahn.\n\nUncle Boonmee winning the Palme d’Or. Rumour has it we have Victor Erice to thank. And of course Simon Field and Keith Griffiths, British producers who actually work with foreign directors – incredible! Were they absent from school when the parochial pills were being administered?\n\nCinema Scope. I do love a Mark Peranson polemic/tirade in print, and the one prompted by this year’s Cannes outdid even last year’s.\n\nBest rediscovery: Paulino Viota’s Contactos (1970).\n\nBest short: A History of Mutual Respect (Gabriel Abrantes & Daniel Schmidt, Portugal).\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nMark Cousins\n\nFilmmaker and critic (Prospect), UK\n\nFilm socialisme\n\nJean-Luc Godard, Switzerland / France\n\nStupid in love, solitary, misanthropic, spitting fury.

I spent time with Stanley Donen and argued with him about his film Two for the Road. For months I relished the arrival of Terrence Malick’s new movie Tree of Life, but he has kept us waiting. I cried – I know, what a jessie – at the beauty of Claudia Cardinale in Girl with a Suitcase (La ragazza con la valigia, 1961), which I saw for the first time at the Telluride Film Festival. I made a little cinema in a village in Iraq and showed films to kids – and saw my boyhood in their euphoria.\n\nThe big lowlight of my movie year was the death of my friend, the film-book author John Orr, who wrote like Godard cuts.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nChris Darke\n\nCritic, UK\n\nWhite Material\n\nClaire Denis, France / Cameroon\n\nAt Ellen’s Age (Im Alter von Ellen)\n\nPia Marais, Germany\n\nOver Your Cities Grass Will Grow\n\nSophie Fiennes, France / Netherlands / UK\n\nContent\n\nChris Petit, UK / Germany\n\nFilm socialisme\n\nJean-Luc Godard, Switzerland / France\n\nHighlights:\n\nJune 2010. A tiny studio tucked away in a corner of BBC Television Centre. Director Grant Gee calls “Cut,” and Sir Andrew Motion looks suddenly blitzed. “That,” he says, “was intense.” Everybody in the darkened boxroom releases a breath, sensing that something special has taken place. We inhale the memory of his friend, W.G. Sebald. Is testimony part of a soul’s slow transmigration? Who even uses the word ‘soul’ anymore? But that was what we were about, in that oddly confessional space: watching and logging the soul that Sebald’s words had lodged in those we interviewed.\n\n2011 is the tenth anniversary of his untimely death and Patience (After Sebald) will be part of the ongoing testimony to the influence and importance of this most missed of writers. I’ve been close to the film as it’s taken shape over the last year, doing interviews, brainstorming with Grant and producer Gareth Evans, and watching its layered, tapestry-like form take shape. It’s one of the most exciting things I’ve been involved in and I look forward to seeing what its life – and afterlife – will be. Theworld premiere is in Aldeburgh on 28 January 2011.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nThomas Dawson\n\nCritic, UK\n\nCarlos\n\nOlivier Assayas, France / Germany / Belgium\n\nAnother Year\n\nMike Leigh, UK\n\nNeds\n\nPeter Mullan, UK / France / Italy\n\nOf Gods and Men (Des hommes et des dieux)\n\nXavier Beauvois, France\n\nThe Social Network\n\nDavid Fincher, USA\n\nHighlight:\n\nNothing in the cinema this year moved me as much as the wordless ‘Last Supper’ sequence towards the end of Of Gods and Men. Despite being ordered by armed Islamic rebels and the military and civilian authorities to flee their monastery, the French monks have collectively chosen to remain and continue their mission, thus effectively condemning themselves to death. Having shared Holy Communion, the brothers settle down on a wintry night to a meal in their spartan dining quarters. Their resident medic (Michael Lonsdale) unexpectedly produces a couple of bottles of red wine and puts a cassette of Tchaikovsky’s Swan Lake into a tape recorder. To the strains of this sublime musical accompaniment, cinematographer Carole Champetier’s camera passes over the initially jubilant faces of the men while they savour the alcohol and their fraternal unity. As the music progresses, however, we see – in a series of close-ups – the characters overcome by tears.\n\nThe poignancy here partly derives from how writer-director Beauvois has patiently established the essential humanity of the monks over the preceding 100 minutes: from the outset they are engaged with the local Muslim community, and they entertain genuine doubts about the purpose of their self-sacrifice. The choice of Tchaikovsky’s music – used for very different purposes in Darren Aronofsky’s Black Swan – obviously heightens the atmosphere of tragic fatefulness. And the sequence itself is a reminder of one of the medium’s most enduring ‘special effects’ – the profound expressiveness of the human face.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nMaria Delgado\n\nAcademic and critic, UK\n\nNostalgia for the Light (Nostalgia de la luz)\n\nPatricio Guzmán, France / Germany / Chile\n\nIn the dry heat of Chile’s Atacama desert, astronomers look up at the skies to examine the origins of the universe. Close to the observatory, families of the disappeared search in the bleak heat of the desert for vestiges of their loved ones, victims of Pinochet’s brutal regime. Brilliantly juxtaposing what at first may appear to be diverse subjects to mesmerising effect, this extraordinary film is as much about the unknown and the unknowable as it is about Chile’s traumatic past.\n\nThe Peddler (El ambulante)\n\nEduardo de la Serna, Lucas Marcheggiano & Adriana Yurkovich, Argentina\n\nA trio of directors follow intrepid, self-taught filmmaker Daniel Burmeister as he arrives in a sleepy Argentine town and embarks on a modest genre pic with a group of locals. A wonderful, hugely entertaining documentary that juggles observations on small-town life with reflections on why film matters and how it can make a difference.\n\nThe Mosquito Net (La Mosquitera)\n\nAgustí Vila, Spain\n\nThis dark, bitter tale of a bourgeois Catalan family’s multiple neurosis offers a brilliant indictment of a world where children are treated like adults and adults behave like teenagers.\n\nWhat I Love the Most (Lo que más quiero)\n\nDelfina Castagnino, Argentina\n\nAnother small gem from Argentina that captures the shifting dynamics between two friends over a Patagonian summer with a less-is-more approach, as Castagnino’s fixed camera observes what is said and what lies between the lines.\n\nBiutiful\n\nAlejandro González Iñárritu, Spain / Mexico\n\nThe most impressive performance of the year came from Javier Bardem as a contemporary Ulysses wandering the streets of an invisible Barcelona of migrant labour and petty crime.\n\nHighlights:\n\nTalking to González Iñárritu about the mechanics of filmmaking; finding DVDs of all Martin Rejtman’s majestic black comedies in Buenos Aires; watching the ghosts of Basque film history flicker on the walls of José María de Orbe’s family house in the elegiac Father (Aita); raising a glass to Luis Miñarro, Spain’s most ambitious independent producer, who was involved in three of my favourite films of the year: Uncle Boonmee,Father (Aita) and The Mosquito Net.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nMar Diestro-Dópido\n\nSight & Sound\n\nUncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (Lung Boonmee raluek chat)\n\nApichatpong Weerasethakul, Thailand / UK / France / Germany / Spain / Netherlands / USA\n\nNostalgia for the Light (Nostalgia de la luz)\n\nPatricio Guzmán, France / Germany / Chile\n\nMnemosyne\n\nJohn Akomfrah, UK\n\nThe Arbor\n\nClio Barnard, UK\n\nFather (Aita)\n\nJosé María de Orbe, Spain\n\nLa vida sublime (The Life Sublime)\n\nDaniel V.

Imagine a mix of South Park at its most vulgarly surrealistic and Ferreri at his loosest, least inhibited, directed by an assortment of porno hacks and featuring dazzlingly acting-challenged talents. Should by all means be shown with David O’Reilly’s animated short The External World, which Chatman co-wrote.\n\nÖdipus Monument Test 01\n\nNorbert Pfaffenbichler, Austria\n\nDurs Grünbein liest die dritte Satire des Juvenal\n\nKlaus Wyborny, Germany\n\nTwo avant-garde studies for truly radical (re-)readings of Greek and Roman classics. From the construction site of a world cinema apart.\n\nOf Gods and Men (Des hommes et des dieux)\n\nXavier Beauvois, France\n\nMan dies. Ideas continue, develop, live on. John Ford would approve.\n\nWall Street Money Never Sleeps\n\nOliver Stone, USA\n\nOca (Father)\n\nVlado Skafar, Slovenia\n\nBroker and broken, world trade and family ties, cold cynicism and hot-hearted hope. Stone’s portrait of high finance as a self-obsessed, Darwinism-keyed clique of social killer mutants merrily working away towards self-extinction was seemingly too subtle, sardonic, sinister for folks wanting a quick, clean condemnation of bankerdom – it ain’t that simple. This might go down as the most misunderstood Hollywood masterpiece of 2010 (followed closely by Joel Schumacher’s similarly reviled Twelve).\n\nSkafar’s prose poem, then, is the proletarian, low-budget, emotionally exhilarating answer to Wall Street: a sketch of people whose lives are destroyed by global capitalism going berserk – which, again, is like saying that Au hasard Balthazar tells the sad tale of a donkey’s life…\n\nVapor Trail (Clark)\n\nJohn Gianvito, USA / Philippines\n\nA monument to all poor who refuse to see themselves as imperialism’s collateral damage, erected in humble solidarity.\n\nHighlight:\n\nMeeting Miguel Marías in Bologna – finally. Truly a soulmate in cinema.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nWilliam Fowler\n\nCurator, BFI, UK\n\nRobinson in Ruins\n\nPatrick Keiller, UK\n\nIt’s a strange moment when a filmmaker who’s effectively been prevented from making films engineers a return to the frame just as the former obstacle – the UK Film Council – is decreed null by the government. Intelligent, beautiful and beautifully paced – there have to be more of these.\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs: A Man Within\n\nYony Leyser, USA\n\nFormally and structurally conventional, this documentary is also rich, compelling and filled with reflections that are both articulate and emotionally sensitive. If you judge a man by the company he keeps, Burroughs was clearly quite something.\n\nThe Pickers\n\nAdam Chodzko, UK\n\nArtist Chodzko deserves considerable praise for working some hundred years of societal change through an encounter that’s human, immediate and self-reflexive. Migrant Romanian strawberry pickers review archival footage of hop pickers on their computer. It’s brilliant.\n\nFour Lions\n\nChris Morris, UK / France\n\nThe collisions of extreme ideology – Islamic Jihad – with the minutiae of domestic living are the cause of a lot of great humour here, as well the moments of pathos.\n\nThe Futurist\n\nEmily Richardson, UK\n\nNavigating an empty cinema auditorium, arcing slowly towards images projected at an incredible speed, a question is posed: what’s moving in real time here, the film’s camera or the projection? I was confused – alienated even – caught in a collision of the serene and the frenetic, lost in an unsolvable conundrum.\n\nHighlight:\n\nQuestioning the modest yet politically and morally assured Michael Moorcock after a Flipside screening of The Final Programme, the 1973 adaptation of his novel. I then read his radically structured book of the movie The Great Rock ’n’ Roll Swindle which, tying itself to the punk names we all know and love, worked totally.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nPhilip French\n\nThe Observer, UK\n\nInception\n\nChristopher Nolan, USA / UK\n\nWinter’s Bone\n\nDebra Granik, USA\n\nAnother Year\n\nMike Leigh, UK\n\nThe Kids Are All Right\n\nLisa Cholodenko, USA\n\nThe Social Network\n\nDavid Fincher, USA\n\nHighlights:\n\nThe year’s great revival was the near-definitive restoration of Lang’sMetropolis (1927). I’ve been watching ragged versions in uncomfortable venues since I was a teenage cinephile in the early 1950s: it’s now available on DVD for home viewing. The most revealing revival was Leo McCarey’s 1937 Make Way for Tomorrow (Eureka Blu-ray), a Depression classic that must have been Ozu’s model for Tokyo Story.\n\nThe most illuminating film book that came my way this year was Susan Compo’s Warren Oates (University Press of Kentucky), appropriately subtitled A Wild Life. It’s a frank, fascinating biography of a dedicated character actor who moved in the less fashionable Hollywood circles and appeared in some of the key movies of his time.\n\nA defining cinematic event? Our coalition government’s decision to scrap the UK Film Council is, if not exactly a tragedy, then a stupid, ill-considered decision, characteristic of the Establishment’s attitude towards our cinema and our movie industry over the past 80 years, whether the aim was to curb or encourage. Harold Wilson in the 1940s, Thatcher in the 80s, Brown in the early years of this century – it’s all much the same.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nChris Fujiwara\n\nCritic, USA\n\nCondolences\n\nYing Liang, China\n\nYing Liang’s short Condolences is built around the stubbornness of a woman’s body as it stays in a chair, while all around her an official ceremony of forgetting is taking place. Across the duration of this unflinching image, tragedy and irony trade off, neither one willing to abandon the field to the other, and neither one able to assert clear title to it.\n\nRosalinda\n\nMatías Piñeiro, Argentina\n\nMade as part of the Digital Project of the Jeonju International Film Festival, this short revitalises a kind of dialogue with theatre that cinema used to engage in more frequently (sometimes with the brilliance of To Be or Not to Be, Les Enfants terribles, The Golden Coach, The Honey Pot orOpening Night). Taking as its starting point a series of rehearsals of As You Like It, it’s one of the most interesting Shakespeare films to emerge since the death of Orson Welles.\n\nO Estranho Caso de Angélica (The Strange Case of Angelica)\n\nManoel de Oliveira, Portugal / Spain / France / Brazil\n\nToujours moins\n\nLuc Moullet, France\n\nStudying the recent history of the replacement of human workers by automation, Toujours moins is a film of supreme elegance and wit, as masterful as Manoel de Oliveira’s latest.\n\nFestival\n\nJean-Claude Rousseau, France\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nGraham Fuller\n\nCritic, USA\n\nCarlos\n\nOlivier Assayas, France / Germany / Belgium\n\nAssayas skipped the psychology of terrorism in favour of depicting the Marxist assassin-hijacker as the star of his own 21-year action movie – a man whose need for sex and liposuction confounds the notion of revolutionary asceticism.\n\nFather of My Children (Le Père de mes enfants)\n\nMia Hansen-Løve, France / Germany\n\nHansen-Løve explored “the cruelty of cinema” in her second feature, which claims as its martyr-victim an urbane producer of risky arthouse ventures. The scene in which his grieving family moves from darkness to light during a power cut is a sublime metaphor for carrying on.\n\nMeek’s Cutoff\n\nKelly Reichardt, USA\n\nA ‘slow cinema’ first for the genre, Reichardt’s revisionist-feminist western reveals how pioneer families went astray on a waterless branch of the Oregon Trail in 1845. Starkly poetic, it punctures both the racist masculine aggression of Manifest Destiny and Fordian nostalgia.\n\nRevanche\n\nGötz Spielmann, Austria\n\nThis impressive anti-thriller morphs from sleazy noir to serene Christian parable as it follows a bank robber from Vienna to the countryside and leads him from revenge to redemption.\n\nThe Social Network\n\nDavid Fincher, USA\n\nAccording to Fincher’s putative zeitgeist classic, Facebook was the spawn of rejection, spite, loneliness and betrayal. Hail Jesse Eisenberg’s Mark Zuckerberg, the geek god of disconnection – this decade’s Charles Foster Kane!\n\nHighlights:\n\nWatching Claude Lanzmann’s Holocaust documentary Shoah on its 25th-anniversary rerelease in New York put everything else I saw into perspective. Who can comprehend the backwards look of the train driver at his ghostly cargo, the throat-slitting gestures of warning to the trapped Jews, the horror of the song taught to new arrivals at Treblinka?\n\nElsewhere, it was a banner year for Powell (Black Narcissus DVD, Peeping Tom revived), Lang (Dr Mabuse and M DVDs, Metropolis restored), Hitchcock-as-icon (Double Take) and Clouzot (Inferno).\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nCharles Gant\n\nHeat magazine, UK\n\nThe Social Network\n\nDavid Fincher, USA\n\nCredit to Aaron Sorkin, David Fincher and co for creating a truly vital mainstream film from the most unlikely subjects: computer programming, business ethics and legal process.\n\nToy Story 3\n\nLee Unkrich, USA\n\nCatfish\n\nHenry Joost & Ariel Schulman, USA\n\nTwo emotional rollercoaster rides from opposite ends of the budgetary scale: the latter documentary at times appears to be so outrageously exploitative, the only credible explanation seemed to be that it was in fact a scripted drama. Filmmakers Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman push the audience to the edge of outrage, then row back in the nick of time.\n\nTabloid\n\nErrol Morris, USA\n\nMore straightforwardly enjoyable than Catfish – though also exploitative of its deluded subject – is Errol Morris’s giddy Tabloid.\n\nMonsters\n\nGareth Edwards, UK\n\nFor its capacity to surprise with its collision of road movie, indie romance and sci-fi.\n\nHighlight:\n\nI first saw The Social Network at a London press screening, but a couple of weeks later I was in New York the day it opened at US cinemas. Seeing it again on opening night, at a packed AMC megaplex on 42nd Street – right film, right place, right time.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nLeonardo Garcia-Tsao\n\nCritic, Mexico\n\nCarlos\n\nOlivier Assayas, France / Germany / Belgium\n\nA feat of narrative tension sustained through a 333-minute thriller that is essentially a perceptive meditation on the shifting ideologies of world politics.\n\nChicogrande\n\nFelipe Cazals, Mexico\n\nAn inner epic and a lucid critique of US interventionism, done in the form of a classic western. Even the genre themes of loyalty and camaraderie are there.\n\nMy Joy (Schastye Moye)\n\nSergei Loznitsa, Ukraine / Germany / Netherlands\n\nAn unpredictable and at times baffling road movie into Russian darkness, past or present. One of the few true revelations of the year.\n\nShutter Island\n\nMartin Scorsese, USA\n\nAgainst most expectations, Scorsese regained his wild and crazy mojo in this nightmarish recreation of his protagonist’s mind.\n\nToy Story 3\n\nLee Unkrich, USA\n\nFor once a box-office hit that deserved its popularity. Wit, nostalgic emotion and craftsmanship in one smooth Pixar package.\n\nHighlights:\n\n2010 for me was the year I finally had my fill of the shabby minimalist trend which, after a ten-year run, has become in its own way as formulaic, convention-ridden and self-indulgent as any mainstream movie. So allow me to make a pitch for maximalism. Go for baroque, guys! Don’t let the legacies of Von Sternberg or Welles be forgotten.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nCharlotte Garson\n\nCahiers du cinéma, France\n\nVénus noire (Black Venus)\n\nAbdellatif Kechiche, France / Italy / Belgium\n\nLa Vie au Ranch (Chicks)\n\nSophie Letourneur, France\n\nPost Mortem\n\nPablo Larraín, Chile / Germany / Mexico\n\nThe Social Network\n\nDavid Fincher, USA\n\nUncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (Lung Boonmee raluek chat)\n\nApichatpong Weerasethakul, Thailand / UK / France / Germany / Spain / Netherlands / USA\n\nHighlights:\n\nDavid D. Williams is a painter and cinéaste who teaches film at the University of Virginia. His two masterpieces, Lillian (1993) and Thirteen(1997), are included on a French-release box-set that gives us the opportunity to witness the synthesis of three aesthetics – experimental, documentary, fictional – in two piercingly beautiful female portraits. In giving barely fictionalised roles to his black neighbours and using his own home as set, Williams gives new meaning to the expression ‘home movie’. Despite his selection at Sundance at the start of the 1990s, his lyricism – carried by the muted colours of 16mm – never set a trend. But he remains, with Charles Burnett, the most beautiful example of American ‘folk cinema’.\n\nPlus: Mad Men; the best song heard in a movie in a long time – the autobiographical lament sung by artist / madman Jean-Marie in Antoine Boutet’s French documentary Le Plein pays; Jean Narboni’s stimulating little book on The Great Dictator, Pourquoi les coiffeurs? Notes actuelles sur Le Dictateur (Capricci éditions, France); Edward Yang’s restored A Brighter Summer Day.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nRyan Gilbey\n\nNew Statesman, UK\n\nThe Social Network\n\nDavid Fincher, USA\n\nA fine companion piece to Fincher’s most exacting film, Zodiac. Like that picture, it’s a forensic study of an enigmatic outcast remaking the world according to his own desires and specifications – and of the people left behind him to clear up or make sense of the mess. In the case of Zodiac, it was a serial killer. Here, it’s the only marginally more likeable Mark Zuckerberg. Stand-outs include a creepy-sad piano / synth score (by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross) and the mighty-beyond-his-years Andrew Garfield, wearing all the movie’s pain in that worried face.\n\nUncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (Lung Boonmee raluek chat)\n\nApichatpong Weerasethakul, Thailand / UK / France / Germany / Spain / Netherlands / USA\n\nApichatpong uses film language we’ve encountered before, but assembles it in such a way that we have the sensation of stumbling upon a previously undiscovered and uncorrupted tongue.\n\nThe Headless Woman (La mujer sin cabeza)\n\nLucrecia Martel, Argentina / Spain / France / Italy\n\nIn a delicious reflection of the main character’s central conundrum — what did I do? — the audience is left asking, over and over, “What did we see?” Like Lynch or Antonioni, it’s a mystery with an infinite shelf life.\n\nGreenberg\n\nNoah Baumbach, USA\n\nIn common with Fincher’s film, this is also a comedy (of sorts) about an East Coast Jew hitting California without the benefit of any discernible social skills. Here’s an arbitrary measure of this haunting movie’s success: even Rhys Ifans is good in it.\n\nGentlemen Broncos\n\nJared Hess, USA\n\nThe Peddler (El ambulante)\n\nEduardo de la Serna, Lucas Marcheggiano & Adriana Yurkovich, Argentina\n\nI’m cheating by smuggling two films into fifth place, but these are snug bedfellows, both of them in love with the DIY ethic and the unruly joy of imaginative storytelling.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nJane Giles\n\nHead of content, BFI, UK\n\nEnter the Void\n\nGaspar Noé, France / USA / Germany / Italy / Japan / Canada\n\nBlinking marvellous, with one of the best-ever opening credit sequences. Totally immersive cinema.\n\nA Prophet (Un prophète)\n\nJacques Audiard, France / Italy\n\nTruly terrific, nothing more to say.\n\nThe Runaways\n\nFloria Sigismondi, USA\n\nCriminally underseen, it barely scratched the box office, but this gorgeous 1970s romp should be on the syllabus at the Girls’ Own School of Rock ’n’ Roll Film Studies.\n\nMy Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done\n\nWerner Herzog, USA / Germany\n\nMy expectations for The Bad Lieutenant were raised too high to deliver, but this cheered me up no end with its dream cast and flamingo hostages.\n\nI Am Love (Io sono l’amore)\n\nLuca Guadagnino, Italy\n\nIt’s fascinating to see how the ‘women’s picture’ looks 50 years on, particularly as the BFI prepares for a major season reappraising the melodrama.\n\nHighlights:\n\nA nearly perfect night watching Peckinpah’s The Getaway in NFT1 as part of the Steve McQueen season – it surely trumps The Killer Inside Me in the Jim Thompson adaptation stakes.\n\nSeeing BFI Flipside go from strength to strength, with Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush becoming the BFI’s fastest-selling DVD release ever.\n\nJudging the Edinburgh Film Festival award for Best British Short Film and being worried for days by In the Meadow (directed by Dave Alexander Smith) – Marcel Marceau meets Michael Haneke.\n\nBeing moved to tears by John Krish’s description of filming They Took Us to the Sea, which screened on the opening night of the BFI’s ‘Boom Britain’ post-war documentary season.\n\nRealising that the world wouldn’t end with the death of Dennis Hopper.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nCarmen Gray\n\nCritic, UK\n\nAurora\n\nCristi Puiu, Romania / France / Switzerland / Germany\n\nThe Autobiography of Nicolae Ceausescu\n\nAndrei Ujica, Romania\n\nWhile the cinema of the moment may have shifted to Thailand, for me the year was still all about Romania. My experience of these two films was heightened by seeing them with a packed and responsive local audience at the excellent Transilvania International Film Festival in Cluj. Puiu’s bleak, blackly absurdist meditation on the human will to kill is nothing short of a medium-pushing masterpiece, while Ujica’s reconfiguration of archival propaganda material, quietly needling out its intrinsic irony and the seeds of its own unravelling, is just as stunningly innovative in the realm of documentary.\n\nUncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (Lung Boonmee raluek chat)\n\nApichatpong Weerasethakul, Thailand / UK / France / Germany / Spain / Netherlands / USA\n\nTrash Humpers\n\nHarmony Korine, USA / UK\n\nHow to Make a Book with Steidl\n\nJörg Adolph & Gereon Wetzel, Germany\n\nBrilliantly witty, unique documentary about German publisher Gerhard Steidl.\n\nHighlight:\n\nThe resurrection of the extended Metropolis, also screened in Cluj, with live music.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nPeter Hames\n\nAcademic and critic, UK\n\nHow I Ended This Summer (Kakya provel etim letom)\n\nAlexei Popogrebsky, Russia\n\nPopogrebsky’s atmospheric psychological drama set in a meteorological station in the Arctic Circle was a deserved festival favourite. Compelling atmosphere and beautifully acted. A pity his second film Simple Thingsmissed out on a UK release.\n\nWhite Material\n\nClaire Denis, France / Cameroon\n\nDenis’s profound account of the life of a white coffee planter (Isabelle Huppert) caught up in the realities of an African civil war. A highly original narrative powerfully evokes ambiguities of feeling, and Huppert gives a stunning performance.\n\nSurviving Life\n\nJan Svankmajer, Czech Republic / Slovakia\n\nSvankmajer’s latest film uses cut-out animation, combining real actors and their photographs to produce some striking collages. The story of a man who wants to preserve his dream reality, it’s also a great deal of fun.\n\nMy Joy (Schastye Moye)\n\nSergei Loznitsa, Ukraine / Germany / Netherlands\n\nFrom stories told to him while working on documentaries in Russia, Loznitsa has produced a compelling and disturbing road movie reflecting the present and past traumas of ‘European Russia’.\n\nPouta (Walking Too Fast)\n\n(Radim Spacek, Czech Republic / Slovakia)\n\nStrikingly visualised, this disturbing tale of the Czech secret police provides a compelling portrait of moral and social corruption. It’s ultimately more disturbing than The Lives of Others.\n\nHighlights:\n\nThe Frantisek Vlácil retrospective season at BFI Southbank produced not only some remarkable films, but revealed that such journeys of discovery can even command audiences.\n\nI was also delighted to catch up with Wojciech Jerzy Has’s The Hourglass Sanatorium (1973) and the full version of Visconti’s The Leopard (Il gattopardo, 1963).\n\nNils Gaup’s Kautokeino Rebellion, which I saw in Gdynia, tells the suppressed story of the Norwegian Sami rebellion of 1852. Introduced by Gaup, himself a descendant of one of the leaders, it’s an epic of substance.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nNick Hasted\n\nCritic, UK\n\nThe Road\n\nJohn Hillcoat, USA\n\nA Prophet (Un prophète)\n\nJacques Audiard, France / Italy\n\nOil City Confidential\n\nJulien Temple, UK\n\nCapitalism: A Love Story\n\nMichael Moore, USA\n\nAgora\n\nAlejandro Amenábar, Spain\n\nHighlights:\n\nMy most unpleasantly memorable surprise in the cinema was watching the fatal beating of Jessica Alba’s character in The Killer Inside Me, Michael Winterbottom’s scrupulously well-intentioned, awful moral and tonal misjudgement. The happiest was De Niro in Everybody’s Fine, finally playing the convincing ordinary man he’d said he was aiming for in 1970s interviews. A great actor’s unremarked return, it was more magically nuanced and personal than any fiction Scorsese’s managed lately.\n\nMy offscreen highlight, though, was meeting Filippo Timi. Known here for playing Mussolini in Bellocchio’s Vincere, in Italy he’s a major star and bestselling author, a sudden phenomenon at 35. In his films he combines bullish masculine power and delicate sensitivity. I was still more eager to meet him when Gabriele Salvatores, who directed him in As God Commands, mentioned that Timi has a terrible stammer and eyesight so bad he’s “almost blind”. “He can’t see and can’t speak,” he told me, “the two things an actor needs most. But he has an iron will.”\n\nThe wiry, attractively bohemian Timi waiting for me at his London distributor’s office was unrecognisable from the combustible actor on screen. There it’s his physical presence that gets you, and he memorably told me why: “I believe more in the body than the thought. If someone compliments me, I don’t trust them unless they hug me. And the same if someone’s angry – I don’t trust them unless they punch me. If we were to have an argument, I’d have a huge conflict in myself not to beat you up… But if you produce something wonderful from this interview, one day when we meet again I’d probably kiss you!”\n\nI got a massive hug, not a punch, as I left.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nSophie Ivan\n\nCritic, UK\n\nNeds\n\nPeter Mullan, UK / France / Italy\n\nDevastating, witty kitchen-sink drama laced with magic realism and echoes of Truffaut, Peter Mullan’s long-awaited third feature is one of 2010’s biggest reasons to be cheerful about British cinema.\n\nThe Secret of Kells\n\nTomm Moore, France / Belgium / Ireland\n\nIn another strong year for Ghibli and Pixar, this 2D Irish animation was an unlikely Oscar contender. Based on, and styled after, a medieval illuminated manuscript of the Gospels, it is also a uniquely beautiful, charming treat.\n\nBluebeard (Barbe Bleue)\n\nCatherine Breillat, France\n\nBreillat’s first (though somehow inevitable) foray into fairytales was playful, enigmatic and provocative – a perfect pairing of filmmaker and subject.\n\nDogtooth (Kynodontas)\n\nYorgos Lanthimos, Greece\n\nBrilliant, bizarre and utterly compelling philosophical and psychological study of familial dysfunction, Lanthimos’s film plays like Haneke with belly laughs.\n\nLa Danse: The Paris Opera Ballet\n\nFrederick Wiseman, France / USA\n\nWiseman’s documentary works as a neat companion piece to his follow-up, Boxing Gym, but is set apart by its masterful structure and exquisitely photographed, transcendent dance sequences.\n\nHighlights:\n\nBattersea Art Centre’s 32-hour Twin Peaks weekender, during which the entire venue was transformed into Lynch-land (including Log Lady life-drawing, the Black Lodge and an inexhaustible supply of doughnuts), fully immersed viewers in the series’ many dimensions.\n\nThe highlight of another innovative programme of live music commissions for silent cinema from Birds Eye View, Warp Records-signed composer Calix’s palette of found sounds, insect noises and synth melodies provided a suitably enchanting accompaniment to Lotte Reiniger’s groundbreaking silhouette animation The Adventures of Prince Achmed.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nKevin Jackson\n\nCritic, UK\n\nHighlights:\n\nHaving spent most of the year in libraries researching a book about the year 1922, I hardly saw any new releases at all, though I am now much more familiar with the likes of Erich von Stroheim’s Foolish Wives, Alan Dwan’s Robin Hood, Lang’s Dr Mabuse der Spieler, Flaherty’s Nanook of the North, Murnau’s Nosferatu and other great hits of the annus mirabilis of literary modernism.\n\nWhen not locked into the early 20s, I have enjoyed viewing and re-viewing a motley bunch of DVDs, including features by Alberto Cavalcanti (Champagne Charlie is a booze-sodden hoot, and Dead of Night even better than I recalled); glorious colour experiments by Len Lye (thank you, BFI!); Barney Platts-Mills’s 1971 Private Road, starring an impossibly handsome young Bruce Robinson (thank you again, BFI!); and – after many years of expectation – Guy Debord’s melancholic, apocalyptic essay-poem In Girum Imus Nocte et Consumimur Igni(1978), which – almost despite itself – is some kind of masterwork, and unexpectedly moving. In 2011, I will try to pay more attention to the present.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nNick James\n\nSight & Sound\n\nThe Social Network\n\nDavid Fincher, USA\n\nThe most intelligent mainstream American movie made for some time.

Cinema’s ownCrime and Punishment.\n\nOver Your Cities Grass Will Grow\n\nSophie Fiennes, France / Netherlands / UK\n\nThis hardcore documentary about artist Anselm Kiefer’s landscaping of a studio site in Barjac in the South of France made an awe-inspiring pleasure of the artist’s aesthetic rigour.\n\nMysteries of Lisbon (Mistérios de Lisboa)\n\nRaúl Ruiz, Portugal\n\nSumptuously conceived, seemingly in the opulent style of late Visconti but actually with terrific economy, this flashback-based slippery narrative of progeniture and changing fortunes in 19th-century Europe combines the pleasures of Dickens and symbolist poetry.\n\nLe quattro volte (Four Times)\n\nMichelangelo Frammartino, Italy / Germany / Switzerland)\n\nFew films feel as completely achieved as this adroitly staged meditation on life cycles in rural Italy.\n\nHighlights:\n\nStanding briefly outside the bounds of journalistic propriety, my absolute highlight of 2010 was watching (on television) my wife Kate Ogborn win a television Bafta for Best Single Drama as the producer of Samantha Morton’s excellent film The Unloved. On a more professional level, talking about the cinema of the last decade with a roomful of Hungarian film-makers and cinephiles at the delightfully modest Titanic Film Festival in Budapest was another high point, even if the Icelandic ash cloud did mean I had to come home on a bus that took 27 hours to reach London.\n\nI got a kick out of the ‘slow cinema’ debate we at Sight & Sound initiated, though a look at these poll results will show there was a deal of devil’s advocate about our questioning of its dominance. It was a great pleasure also to present the extraordinary Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives as the S&S screening at the LFF. It would be in my top five if not for my wanting to give Le quattro volte a boost after noting that most of my team colleagues had voted for Boonmee.\n\nI had the most fun in the cinema watching The Kids Are All Right in Berlin (relief during an otherwise weak festival) and The Shop Around the Corner at the BFI recently, and on TV watching 30 Rock (the last repository, I argue elsewhere, of the ‘Lubitsch touch’).\n\nThe maddest moment was hearing about the abolition of the UK Film Council while queuing for the videotheque at the Sarajevo Film Festival. The best news would include Clio Barnard’s double prize win at the LFF awards for The Arbor – and the completion of finance for Terence Davies’s first drama film for over a decade, The Deep Blue Sea.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nDavid Jenkins\n\nTime Out London, UK\n\nLa Danse: The Paris Opera Ballet\n\nFrederick Wiseman, France / USA\n\nWiseman employs his primitive, humanist observational mode to present dance as an abstract form of communication.

Every frame hums.\n\nThe Autobiography of Nicolae Ceausescu\n\nAndrei Ujica, Romania\n\nA despot executed with his own pistol. This rigorously assembled ciné-collage illustrates the Sturm und Drang of Ceausescu-era political propaganda, and also demonstrates how the recorded image can darken with age.\n\nMeek’s Cutoff\n\nKelly Reichardt, USA\n\nOne of America’s finest working directors delivers a deliciously opaque range western with philosophical undertones by the wagonload.\n\nHighlights:\n\nSeeing Mizoguchi’s 1933 silent The Water Magician with benshinarration and live koto score at the Barbican added a novel new dimension to the cinemagoing experience.\n\nJafar Panahi’s poignant ode to the necessity of creative freedom The Accordion – made before his imprisonment – played at Venice to a lengthy standing ovation. Also, the Lubitsch retrospective at Locarno reminded me what a sublime, mischievous talent he was. I was particularly smitten by the midnight screening of The Shop around the Corner. Best DVD release: Fassbinder’s World on a Wire (1973).\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nKent Jones\n\nCritic, USA\n\nCarlos\n\nOlivier Assayas, France / Germany / Belgium\n\nThe Social Network\n\nDavid Fincher, USA\n\nEarlier this year, Olivier Assayas and I did a talk at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. He’d been asked to discuss a film he admired, and he choseZodiac. Early on, he said he was struck more than ever by the way that Fincher’s film found its structural and dramatic inspiration in reality itself. This is a hallmark of Carlos and The Social Network and of the three other films listed below – each in its own unique way.\n\nThe Autobiography of Nicolae Ceausescu\n\nAndrei Ujica, Romania\n\nBoxing Gym\n\nFrederick Wiseman, USA\n\nFilm socialisme\n\nJean-Luc Godard, Switzerland / France\n\nHighlights:\n\nFor me, the great filmgoing event of this past year was Bruce Goldstein’s 3D festival at Film Forum in New York. Apart from Dial ‘M’ for Murder, which I’ve seen many times before, the highlight of the series wasInferno (1953), directed by the recently deceased Roy Ward Baker. It crosscuts systematically between Robert Ryan, a wealthy businessman left alone in the mountains with a broken leg, and his wife (Rhonda Fleming) and her lover (William Lundigan) enjoying the pleasures of a swim, a well-cooked meal and a bottle of wine in air-conditioned comfort. The 3D accentuates rock formations, cacti, taut lengths of rope, Robert Ryan’s big, long body edging one crag at a time down to the desert floor and on toward civilisation. A tough, spare movie, a little grandiose but exciting, it doesn’t take any shortcuts getting Ryan off the mountain.\n\nBest acting of the year, hands down – Ruth Sheen’s staggering performance in Another Year. I was hanging on every gesture, just as I was 22 years ago when I saw High Hopes.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nPhilip Kemp\n\nCritic, UK\n\nCity of Life and Death\n\nLou Chuan, China / Hong Kong\n\nDogtooth (Kynodontas)\n\nYorgos Lanthimos, Greece\n\nThe Illusionist (L’Illusionniste)\n\nSylvain Chomet, UK / France\n\nThe Social Network\n\nDavid Fincher, USA\n\nWinter’s Bone\n\nDebra Granik, USA\n\nHighlights:\n\nThe restored version of Lang’s Metropolis, the revival of the year. The 25 minutes of rediscovered footage are a revelation. True, the story is still sententious and frequently sappy, but at least it now makes dramatic sense.\n\nNote: This entry came in too late to be counted for our print edition and therefore the published top 12 films tally.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nEdward Lawrenson\n\nThe Big Issue, UK\n\nAurora\n\nCristi Puiu, Romania / France / Switzerland / Germany\n\nEnter the Void\n\nGaspar Noé, France / USA / Germany / Italy / Japan / Canada\n\nThe Autobiography of Nicolae Ceausescu\n\nAndrei Ujica, Romania\n\nNostalgia for the Light (Nostalgia de la luz)\n\nPatricio Guzmán, France / Germany / Chile\n\nMama\n\nYelena & Nikolai Renard, Russia\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nMark Le Fanu\n\nAcademic and critic, UK\n\nIf I Want to Whistle, I Whistle (En cand vreau sa fluier, fluier)\n\nFlorin Serban, Romania / Sweden\n\nA magnificent prison-and-hostage drama. Being Romanian, the film takes its time to unfold. Its mastery of mise en scène is one thing; its wisdom and humanity are even more impressive.\n\nMedeni mesec (Honeymoons)\n\nGoran Paskaljevic, Serbia / Albania\n\nPaskaljevic is one of the great European directors. A recent season of his films at BFI Southbank this year has helped to make him better known to British audiences. Honeymoons, his latest, shows all his characteristic sensuousness and pessimism – one of the best films in recent history about the movement of people across boundaries.\n\nNa putu (On the Path)\n\nJasmila Zbanic, Bosnia & Herzegovina / Austria / Germany / Croatia\n\nIts subject couldn’t be more topical: the lure of Islam in the face of contemporary Western secularism. How delicately and bravely the director handles the matter. No cheating, no clichés: the film is dialectically intelligent and psychologically penetrating.\n\nMy Queen Karo\n\nDorothée Van Den Berghe, Netherlands / Belgium\n\nA libertarian commune in Amsterdam during the 1970s is viewed through the eyes of a child who ‘suffers’ the experience morally, in the depths of her little soul. But what an incredible child – and what an extraordinarily conceived set-up. The energy, colour and inventiveness of the playing lift this movie to a very high level.\n\nAjami\n\nScandar Copti & Yaron Shani, Germany / Israel\n\nIn my opinion, the best of the crop of excellent Israeli films that have been hitting our screens this year. I preferred it to Lebanon (good in a different way). It does a difficult thing, consummately, by seriously addressing both sides of the most intractable conflict of our time.\n\nHighlights:\n\nFor me this was the screening at Pordenone’s Giornate del Cinema Muto of a freshly rediscovered John Ford movie, Upstream (1927). It’s not every day such films turn up, and in such wonderful condition too. The movie belongs to the time when Ford was working at Fox, and Charles G. Clarke’s photography glistens with the lovely chiaroscuro we have come to associate with that studio, at that period – the last great epoch of the silents. In case you’re wondering, the story and acting are pretty good too. It’s a comedy set in theatrical digs, with a splendid cast of characters, lovingly delineated. Eighty years on, this minor film strikes one as perfect of its kind – a vintage work from one of cinema’s old masters.\n\nI’ve been following the discussion in the pages of Sight & Sound about ‘slow cinema’. Part of me doesn’t need to be convinced: in order to say anything interesting, one needs to have the space, and the time, to do it in. And this is best guaranteed (other things being equal) by the kind of long-take cinema which anchors you in the presence of the actors – and keeps you there over a measurable period of time. On the other hand, there are no absolute formulas, and intensity of expression can come in many guises: it can also be swift, brutal, staccato. The key matter is integrity, and having something to say that’s worth listening to.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nColin MacCabe\n\nAcademic and critic, UK\n\nUncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (Lung Boonmee raluek chat)\n\nApichatpong Weerasethakul, Thailand / UK / France / Germany / Spain / Netherlands / USA\n\nOf Gods and Men (Des hommes et des dieux)\n\nXavier Beauvois, France\n\nTamara Drewe\n\nStephen Frears, UK\n\nI Am Love (Io sono l’amore)\n\nLuca Guadagnino, Italy\n\nCarlos\n\nOlivier Assayas, France / Germany / Belgium\n\nHighlight:\n\nThe screening of a restored print of Visconti’s The Leopard at Cannes. The film was once again superb, but the meditation on time passing was given several extra turns of the screw by its presentation by the only two members of cast and crew still living: Alain Delon, startlingly beautiful as he approaches 80, and Claudia Cardinale, dissolving into giggles like a young girl.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nGeoffrey Macnab\n\nCritic, UK\n\nBlack Swan\n\nDarren Aronofsky, USA\n\nAronofsky’s foray into ballet is a deliriously overcooked psychodrama. There’s nothing restrained about the filmmaking, which has much of the same energy as The Red Shoes. Natalie Portman brings a febrile intensity to her role as the self-destructive dancer.\n\nBoy\n\nTaika Waititi, New Zealand\n\nA tough, lyrical and often very funny film about an 11-year-old Maori kid: imagine a cross between Once Were Warriors and The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole. Writer-director Waititi excels in front of camera too as the boy’s delinquent dad.\n\nSilent Souls (Ovsyanki)\n\nAleksei Fedorchenko, Russia\n\nA Russian road movie / shaggy-dog story reminiscent of As I Lay Dying,about a newly widowed man and his friend taking the body of his dead wife on a thousand-mile road trip to say goodbye to her according to the rituals of the ancient Merja culture. It’s the combination of melancholy, humour and surrealism that makes the film so winning.\n\nA Letter to Elia\n\nMartin Scorsese & Kent Jones, USA\n\nThis tremendous film about Elia Kazan is galvanised by Scorsese’s passion for his subject. He doesn’t become bogged down in the arguments about Kazan naming names in McCarthy days, but instead concentrates on the director’s work. In the process, he makes us realise just how dynamic and brilliantly acted Kazan’s movies were.\n\nThe Illusionist (L’Illusionniste)\n\nSylvain Chomet, UK / France\n\nThis animated feature shows Scotland in a magical light and also succeeds incredibly in capturing the spirit of Tati, though there’s a bleakness to the storytelling that stops it from ever seeming kitsch or maudlin.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nLee Marshall\n\nCritic, Italy\n\nLe quattro volte (Four Times)\n\nMichelangelo Frammartino, Italy / Germany / Switzerland)\n\nI’m finding increasingly that the films that move and interest me, at least outside the documentary format, are ones that channel the otherworldly quality of the cinematic experience. This was one: a laconic, sceptical, almost silent film about a dying shepherd, a lamb, a dog, a tree and a steaming mound of charcoal, it dramatised the natural circle of life and death without recourse to cute lion cubs or talking meercats.\n\nSilent Souls (Ovsyanki)\n\nAleksei Fedorchenko, Russia\n\nOne of those rare films that takes the world we live in and makes it strange and new. With its blend of invented folk traditions, free-floating symbols and sympathy for people and places on the margins, it reminded me of a Borges short story. Not drama, not mockumentary, definitely not realism, it seemed to inhabit a whole new genre.\n\nWinter’s Bone\n\nDebra Granik, USA\n\nNot least because of Jennifer Lawrence’s riveting lead performance, this was one of the best quest movies I’ve seen in years, its dark fairytale tests all the more compelling because they are faced by a 17-year-old girl in a dirtily real Ozarks setting.\n\nThe Illusionist (L’Illusionniste)\n\nSylvain Chomet, UK / France\n\nChomet’s film has meticulously observed rural Scottish and Edinburgh locations, but the fact that it’s animation once again makes the familiar strange (as in Miyazaki’s imagined European cityscapes), adding another layer to a poignant tale of illusions, both of the conjuring and of the human variety.\n\nAttenberg\n\nAthina Rachel Tsangari, Greece\n\nWhile I recognised the fashionably quirky nature of Tsangari’s Venice competiton entry, I also surrendered completely to its oddball portrait of intense father-daughter relationships and small-town life and friendships in the shadow of the local factory.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nAdrian Martin\n\nAcademic and critic, Australia\n\nCertified Copy (Copie conforme)\n\nAbbas Kiarostami, France / Italy / Belgium\n\nFilm socialisme\n\nJean-Luc Godard, Switzerland / France\n\nPoetry (Si)\n\nLee Changdong, South Korea\n\nVincere\n\nMarco Bellocchio, Italy / France\n\nWild Grass (Les herbes folles)\n\nAlain Resnais, France / Italy\n\nHighlights:\n\nIt actually snuck in at the very end of 2009: the special screening of two 35mm films by Carmelo Bene, Our Lady of the Turks (1968) and Salomé(1972), at the Thessaloniki Film Festival. They were made under impossible conditions, through the sheer force of Bene’s considerable artistic will, during the seven-year period in which he devoted himself to cinema and more or less abandoned the theatrical experiments he had pursued since the late 1950s, and to which he returned until the end of his life in 2002.\n\nAll the dazed cinephiles who stumbled out of these big, loud screenings grasped, at the end, for the predictable comparisons: Fellini, Welles, Anger, Jarman, Schroeter, Pasolini, Kubrick, Ruiz, Jack Smith, João César Monteiro… But no combination of the known reference points will suffice. Bene is utterly unique. As both performer and director, he pulverised language, revelled in what he called the “surgical imprecision of montage”, casually scandalised every standard of conventional morality and lit a bonfire of the classical traditions which he nonetheless knew and respected deeply. Bene is an avant-garde superstar in parts of Europe, but is virtually unknown in any English-speaking film culture. Cinema history still hides its finest gems.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nDemetrios Matheou\n\nSunday Herald, UK\n\nWinter’s Bone\n\nDebra Granik, USA\n\nThis bitter, brutal, mesmerising backwoods drama premiered at Sundance, establishing a very high bar for fiction that few films reached.\n\nBlue Valentine\n\nDerek Cianfrance, USA\n\nWith phenomenal performances by Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams, this depicts the top and tail of a relationship – the rapturous first meetings and the eventual, premature death throes – with heartbreaking conviction.\n\nAttenberg\n\nAthina Rachel Tsangari, Greece\n\nThe new wave of Greek cinema announced by Dogtooth was confirmed by this weird but profound investigation of family, sex and society, at the heart of which is an enormously touching relationship between a young woman and her dying father.\n\nExit Through the Gift Shop\n\nBanksy, UK\n\nThis epitomised the current, intriguing blurring of the lines between documentary and fiction. Posing as biography, it was in fact a very tricky construct that left a delicious feeling of having been had – yet still offered much food for thought about the commercialisation of art.\n\nLe quattro volte (Four Times)\n\nMichelangelo Frammartino, Italy / Germany / Switzerland)\n\nAnother ecstatic tiptoe between fact and fiction, with the unlikeliest of heroes – a herd of goats, running amok in the Calabrian hills.\n\nHighlight:\n\nNathalie Portman’s transformation into the black swan. At the climax of Darren Aronosfky’s bravura psychodrama Black Swan, Portman’s mentally fragile ballet dancer finally loses her mind – but, ironically, finds her feet – as she performs Swan Lake. And in the moment that she conquers the role of the black swan, Aronofsky has her transform physically before us, in a kinetic flurry of dark, metallic wings. The moment was, for me, the year’s most thrilling, ecstatic piece of pure cinema.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nSophie Mayer\n\nAcademic, UK\n\nThis Quality\n\nRosalind Nashashibi, Egypt\n\nPart of the LUX / ICO Artists’ Moving Image programme, Nashashibi’s mysterious, engaging, thoughtful work repays repeated viewings as a film about the act (and art) of looking. Apparently simple, the complex moment of looking at a woman in public space takes on resonance when followed by shots of draped cars in Cairo’s streets.\n\nBudrus\n\nJulia Bacha, Israel / Occupied Palestinian Territory / USA\n\nRough around the edges cinematically but incredibly thoughtful in its editing and iconography – and utterly necessary in its representation of non-violent resistance to the Israeli occupation.\n\nDouble Tide\n\nSharon Lockhart, USA / Austria\n\nCinema as stillness, as labour and as meditation – like a cool glass of water in the middle of the hectic London Film Festival.\n\nWorking Girls\n\nDorothy Arzner, 1931, USA\n\nArzner’s ‘lost’ film screened as part of a deeply enjoyable retrospectiveat the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival. It’s a fast-talking and more liberated precursor of screwball comedy, but harder-edged (despite its sentimental ending) in its intimations of single motherhood and prostitution.\n\nHighlights:\n\nOn 10 February 2010, in the shadowy space of London’s Horse Hospital, filmmakers, critics, academics, visual artists, sound artists, poets and cinephiles stood united to celebrate Vertigo as not just a magazine for the moving image, but a community committed to making, sharing, considering and advocating it. Although the event was a wake for the print magazine, its spirit lives on in a digital archive, as well as (if not more so) in the continuing connections and interactions between the people who gathered around and through its pages. Gone but not forgotten.\n\nThe Agnès Varda season at the BFI and on MUBI – for the opportunity it gave to mingle and compare Varda’s elegantly quirky body of features with her lesser-known documentaries and shorts, Mur murs (1980) being a stand-out.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nHannah McGill\n\nFilm writer, UK\n\nThe Arbor\n\nClio Barnard, UK\n\nI think this is a very important and a truly original film. It’s very rare to see work that is this formally ambitious but still retains such a pure and forceful emotional connection to its subject. It made me feel angry, sad and exhilarated.\n\nThe Mouth of the Wolf (La Bocca del lupo)\n\nPietro Marcello, Italy/France\n\nThis was my favourite piece of storytelling this year: a beautiful love story, an unforgettable character study and a highly sophisticated blend of documentary and imaginative elements.\n\nMonsters\n\nGareth Edwards, UK\n\nEdwards is the British fiction breakout of the year. For a genre pieceMonsters is very low-key, but that’s what impresses — the tenderness and the attention to visual and emotional detail.\n\nKawasaki’s Rose (Kawasakiho ruze)\n\nJan Hrebejk, Czech Republic\n\nWhat every family saga about concealed romantic and political skeletons should be: intelligently scripted, exquisitely well-cast, entirely gripping on the level of character.\n\nHow I Ended This Summer (Kakya provel etim letom)\n\nAlexei Popogrebsky, Russia\n\nA properly thrilling thriller doesn’t entirely explain itself: as well as responding to the slow-burning psychological drama and the stunning use of landscape here, I loved the fact that the pivotal decision is not quite explicable.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nHenry K. Miller\n\nAcademic, UK\n\nThe Social Network\n\nDavid Fincher, USA\n\nCarlos\n\nOlivier Assayas, France / Germany / Belgium\n\nScott Pilgrim vs. the World\n\nEdgar Wright, USA / UK / Canada\n\nGreenberg\n\nNoah Baumbach, USA\n\nExit Through the Gift Shop\n\nBanksy, UK\n\nHighlights:\n\nFrank Kermode, who died in August, wrote very little on film, but his extensive work on, and defence of, the canon is especially pertinent at this time of year. The terrible proliferation of lists – not exactly thin on the ground through the rest of the film calendar – might lead you to dismiss the canon, and the seeming availability of nearly everything might make it seem irrelevant, but the canon is more than a top ten. It’s a conversation, in part, and as Kermode says in History and Value, it’s finally inescapable. “If we want the monuments, the documents we value, we must preserve them in spite of their evil associations, and find ways of showing that their value somehow persists in our changing world.”\n\nThat “seeming availability of nearly everything” is, of course, just that, but there are still more superb DVD releases in a year than I can absorb (or afford). The Lux’s John Latham Films 1960-1971 is beautifully put together. I was also very glad to see three of Thorold Dickinson’s films –Queen of Spades (1949) and Secret People (1951) in particular – put out by Optimum. Dickinson came into the film business as an apprentice of the director George Pearson; Judith McLaren’s reconstruction of his Ultusquartet (1915–17), presented at BFI Southbank, was an exemplary work of scholarship, drawing on multiple archives to bring to light something unseen since its release in the age before repertory film culture.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nJames Mottram\n\nCritic, UK\n\nCarlos\n\nOlivier Assayas, France / Germany / Belgium\n\nAssayas’s 333-minute terrorist drama destroyed all comers. Never mind the full-length version was meant for French television, this was an encapsulating cinematic experience dominated by a charismatic turn by Édgar Ramírez.\n\nI Am Love (Io sono l’amore)\n\nLuca Guadagnino, Italy\n\nSumptuous Italian melodrama, the most assured directorial debut of the year.\n\nAnother Year\n\nMike Leigh, UK\n\nAnother year, another Mike Leigh film – but what a film. A searing study of friendships and family, it may be familiar territory for Leigh, but it proves particularly fertile here. Arguably the best ensemble cast of 2010 – the performances from Leigh regulars Lesley Manville and Peter Wight were nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nBlack Swan\n\nDarren Aronofsky, USA\n\nYou need guts to take on The Red Shoes. Aronofsky’s ballet drama may come off second best, but this mash-up of psychological horror, coming-of-age story and backstage drama kept me hooked.\n\nThe Social Network\n\nDavid Fincher, USA\n\nHow do you make a film about Facebook? Aaron Sorkin’s dazzling script showed how. A true Geek Tragedy.\n\nHighlights:\n\nWhile 2010 was hardly a vintage year, there were still some moments to treasure. As revivals go, Barney Platts-Mills’s ‘lost classic’ Bronco Bullfrog(1970), given an extended run at the BFI Southbank, was an unexpected delight. Even more so, however, was the Q&A with the delightfully eccentric Platts-Mills himself, following a screening of his other forgotten gem, Private Road (1971), which features a dashing young Bruce Robinson clearly pinching plot-points for Withnail & I.\n\nOn a more personal level, my Venice encounter with Two-Lane Blacktop’s Monte Hellman – now 78 – proved to be a major highlight (even if his baffling film Road to Nowhere was not what I’d hoped). Modest to a tee, and a true gentleman.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nLisa Mullen\n\nCritic, UK\n\nOver Your Cities Grass Will Grow\n\nSophie Fiennes, France / Netherlands / UK\n\nA ravishingly hypnotic record of the work of landscape artist Anselm Kiefer, who carves haunted spaces out of earth, air, fire and water and fills them with troubling and enigmatic objects: new relics planted carefully into new ruins. Addressing, almost wordlessly, the interdependence of work and practice, Fiennes finally appropriates Kiefer’s conceptual wonderland to ponder the relationships between film, art and truth. Masterfully done.\n\nBlack Swan\n\nDarren Aronofsky, USA\n\nSearingly intense gothic melodrama with Natalie Portman giving the performance of her life as a virginal ballerina desperate to get in touch with her dark side. Exhilarating and exhausting: not since Powell and Pressburger has the world of ballet looked this blood-poundingly visceral on screen.\n\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Män som hatar kvinnor)\n\nNiels Arden Oplev, Sweden / Denmark / Germany / Norway\n\nThe definitive film adaptation of Steig Larsson’s first and best book, with Noomi Rapace bringing unexpected vulnerability to punk hacker Lisbeth Salander. The Swedish title, which translates as “men who hate women”, tells you everything you need to know about its violent plot, but the chill winds of time and regret also blow through its snowscapes, to brilliantly atmospheric effect.\n\nPredators\n\nNimród Antal, USA\n\nProducer Robert Rodriguez has his fingerprints all over this devastatingly efficient splatterfest, which strips the man-hunting-alien concept back to its cold-hearted genre essentials by parachuting a mixed bag of flawed humans on to the suffocating jungle planet that the predators call home.\n\nCapitalism: A Love Story\n\nMichael Moore, USA\n\nThe exasperated outburst of a tattered revolutionary, Moore’s latest diatribe lacks the nimbleness of the director’s key works but still packs political punch. He may not quite bring himself to say the word ‘socialism’ out loud, but at least he’s brought the obscenity of ‘dead peasant insurance’ to the public’s attention.\n\nHighlight:\n\nWent the Day Well? (1942), Alberto Cavalcanti’s unsettling propaganda piece about a sleepy village invaded by Nazis in disguise, returned to the big screen this summer to unsettle a new generation with its subversive take on the English rural idyll.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nKim Newman\n\nCritic, UK\n\nThe Social Network\n\nDavid Fincher, USA\n\nAnother Year\n\nMike Leigh, UK\n\nMetropolis\n\nFritz Lang, 1927, restored\n\nThe Secret in Their Eyes (El secreto de sus ojos)\n\nJuan José Campanella, Spain / Argentina\n\nThe Bad Lieutenant Port of Call: New Orleans\n\nWerner Herzog, USA\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nHannah Patterson\n\nCritic, UK\n\nShed Your Tears and Walk Away\n\nJez Lewis, UK\n\nMeek’s Cutoff\n\nKelly Reichardt, USA\n\nThe Arbor\n\nClio Barnard, UK\n\nWinter’s Bone\n\nDebra Granik, USA\n\nA Prophet (Un prophète)\n\nJacques Audiard, France / Italy\n\nHighlights:\n\nAlan Bennett discussing his life and work at BFI Southbank; the Branchage International Jersey Film Festival, for its intimate and imaginative one-off events staged in unusual local settings; a host of illuminating documentaries and Q&As at Sheffield Doc/Fest (in particular, Marwencol and The Battle for Barking).\n\nSloping off alone to watch Streetdance 3D in a morning screening (dance movies, a guilty pleasure) and finding three others in the audience – all teenage boys – who proceeded to dance in the aisle throughout; Man of Aran at Union Chapel with live soundtrack by British Sea Power; bizarrely complementary double bills of Wall Street Money Never Sleeps and TheSocial Network, and Precious and Mugabe and The White African.\n\nThe anticipation of seeing Joanna Hogg’s new film Archipelago at the London Film Festival, and being unexpectedly moved by It’s Kind of a Funny Story.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nVic Pratt\n\nCurator, BFI, UK\n\nGreenberg\n\nNoah Baumbach, USA\n\nMy favourite film this year contains various chillingly close-to-the-bone insights into the damaged psyches of men of a certain age, succinctly articulated through a brilliantly plausible performance by Ben Stiller.\n\nTucker & Dale vs Evil\n\nElijah Craig, Canada\n\nCountry hicks Tucker and Dale are nice guys who play Scrabble, until a string of unfortunate bloody accidents lead teen townies to believe they’re crazed killers in this ingenious backwoods horror parody. Inexplicably, it remains unreleased in the UK.\n\nMavro Livadi (Black Field)\n\nVardis Marinakis, Greece\n\nGreece, 1654. A wounded soldier is held prisoner in a convent until he escapes to the forest with one of the sisters. Hypnotic, dreamlike, strangely erotic and lushly resonant with the sights and sounds of the undergrowth, this striking debut feature still bothers me.\n\nThe Bad Lieutenant Port of Call: New Orleans\n\nWerner Herzog, USA\n\nIt’s hardly Aguirre, Wrath Of God, and at times it veers dangerously close to becoming a TV movie, but it’s still good Herzog, with a rich, sleazy role for Cage, bumper lizard content and a splendidly overlong, grandiose title.\n\nWhatever Works\n\nWoody Allen, USA / France\n\nSimilarly, it’s hardly Annie Hall, and Larry David doesn’t always seem comfortable in Woody Allen’s skin (or should that be the other way round?), but its origins in an unused 1970s script mean that some of it works – and a sugary spoonful of old, good Woody helps the less-easy-to-swallow new, clunky, medicinal Woody go down.\n\nHighlight:\n\nFinally seeing Flipside favourite Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bushgroove out of the archive and on to BFI DVD in a zingy new, thoroughly psychedelic transfer, with tragic star Barry Evans celebrated once more in the media. If only he was still around to enjoy it.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nNaman Ramachandran\n\nCritic, UK / India\n\nI Am Love (Io sono l’amore)\n\nLuca Guadagnino, Italy\n\nThe best portrait of crumbling aristocracy since The Leopard also has a delirious homage to D.H. Lawrence as the cherry on the cake.\n\nKray (The Edge)\n\nAleksei Uchitel, Russia\n\nA terrific old-fashioned action film that’s a must for anyone with a love of steam engines.\n\nDetective Dee and the Mystery of Phantom Flame (Di Renjie zhi Tongtian diguo)\n\nTsui Hark, Hong Kong\n\nGuy Ritchie should watch and learn from this majestic period detective film before desecrating Holmes again.\n\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Män som hatar kvinnor)\n\nNiels Arden Oplev, Sweden / Denmark / Germany / Norway\n\nNoomi Rapace is the acting find of the year in a film that does justice to the book.\n\nEndhiran (The Robot)\n\nS. Shankar, India\n\nIt’s a riotous clash between man and machine in India’s most expensive film and highest-ever grosser, featuring the country’s biggest star Rajnikanth as a scientist, a good robot and an evil robot.\n\nHighlights:\n\nMeeting and getting an insight into the mind of Dibakar Banerjee, whoseLSD: Love Sex aur Dhokha (LSD: Love, Sex and Deceit) opened the London Indian Film Festival. The film is based on the concept of found footage, the entire narrative seen through a voyeuristic video camera, security camera or a spy cam. Made for just £140,000, it grossed ten times that and flew high in the face of bloated Bollywood disasters. It also featured one of India’s first explicit sex scenes, which was censored there but was shown uncut in the UK at festival screenings.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how differently Banerjee treats Vasilis Vasilokos’s novel Z, so memorably adapted by Costa-Gavras in 1969, in his next film Shanghai.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nNicolas Rapold\n\nFilm Comment, USA\n\nCarlos\n\nOlivier Assayas, France / Germany / Belgium\n\nAlle Anderen (Everyone Else)\n\nMaren Ade, Germany\n\nThe Oath\n\nLaura Poitras, USA\n\nThe Robber\n\nBenjamin Heisenberg, Austria / Germany\n\nUncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (Lung Boonmee raluek chat)\n\nApichatpong Weerasethakul, Thailand / UK / France / Germany / Spain / Netherlands / USA\n\nHighlights:\n\nKeeping up with Stanley Donen in conversation; watching James Benning’s Google Earth presentation of his home town; watching Poto and Cabengo and Destroy She Said and Derby; and following Cristi Puiu to the end of a thought.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nTony Rayns\n\nCritic, UK\n\nEnd of Animal (Jimseung ui Kkut)\n\nJo Seung-hee, South Korea\n\nThe Home of Stars (Byeoldeul ui Kohyang)\n\nJung Yoon-suk, South Korea\n\nI Wish I Knew (Hai Shang Chuanqi)\n\nJia Zhangke, China\n\nThe Social Network\n\nDavid Fincher, USA\n\nThomas Mao (Xiao Dongxi)\n\nZhu Wen, China\n\nHighlights:\n\n2010’s clear highlight was the awarding of the Cannes Palme d’Or toUncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, one of several titles that should really be in my top five – and would be, if I hadn’t preferred to use some of the slots for as-yet-unrecognised films. Apichatpong has been on a whirlwind tour of festivals ever since May, and his film has already opened in several countries, not very successfully in Germany and Italy but gratifyingly strongly elsewhere.\n\nIts triumph on the Riviera prompted a remarkable polemic from the Canadian critic Mark Peranson in his magazine Cinema Scope, positing an unbridgeable divide between “us” (Apichatpong fans, and those in favour of intelligent, non-industrial and innovative cinema in general) and “them” (fans of Mike Leigh, Mikhalkov, Iñárritu et al). This was the most enjoyable piece of writing on cinema I read all year.\n\nThe other films that got my pulses racing in 2010 would all go down well with Peranson’s “us”. Most of them were from East Asia. They include Li Hongqi’s deadpan tragi-comedy Winter Vacation, the extended cut of Zhao Liang’s Petition, Lee Sam-Chil’s very witty riff on Kafka’sMetamorphosis and Japanese maverick Hirabayashi Isamu’s two latest shorts: Aramaki (on an attempt to aestheticise a suicide organically) andShikasha (on a mysterious race against time), shown in competition in Berlin and Cannes respectively.\n\nBut I also liked some American indies: Foreign Parts by Verena Paravel and J.P. Sniadecki, about a scrapyard in the shadow of the New York Mets’ stadium, and Aardvark by Kitao Sakurai, a docudrama about a blind, middle-aged ex-alcoholic and his improbable friendship with a young black jiu-jitsu instructor who moonlights as an S&M rentboy.\n\n↑ Back to contributors’ list\n\nTim Robey\n\nThe Daily Telegraph, UK\n\nDogtooth (Kynodontas)\n\nYorgos Lanthimos, Greece\n\nFor bite, formal audacity and hideous implications, there was nothing to match this.\n\nI Am Love (Io sono l’amore)\n\nLuca Guadagnino, Italy\n\nRichly virtuosic with colours and playful with its antecedents. A Tilda-fest.\n\nPoetry (Si)\n\nLee Changdong, South Korea\n\nForget the so-so noises out of Cannes – it’s magisterial on empathy and memory.\n\nA Town Called Panic (Panic au village)\n\nStéphane Aubier & Vincent Patar, Belgium / Luxembourg / France\n\nHilariously off the wall, this animation blissfully refuses to settle down plotwise.\n\nThe Illusionist (L’Illusionniste)\n\nSylvain Chomet, UK / France\n\nFinds the magic in melancholy, and vice versa. An evanescent poem in light.\n\nHighlights:\n\nThe unsung hero of this year’s London Film Festival was Columbia restoration expert Grover Crisp, whose team’s glistening clean-up jobs onPicnic (1955) and The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) provided the lushest widescreen experiences I’ve had all year. In the same festival, which was in general better than ever, the restoration of Edward Yang’s street-gang epic A Brighter Summer Day by Scorsese’s World Cinema Foundation finally brought this neglected magnum opus – which for me just clips the bar of masterpiece – back to light in the full cut Yang originally approved.
