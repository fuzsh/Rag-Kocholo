        "text": "Encountering Ehrenberg: tracing the development of psychoanalytic therapy at the intimate edge.\n\nPubMed\n\nLaidlaw, Christine; Heusser, Shelley\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis article illustrates the thinking-through processes and clinical applications of D.B. Ehrenberg's ideas within the therapeutic situation. During the last four decades, Ehrenberg has articulated that the psychoanalytic relationship is at its most compelling when it evolves at \"the intimate edge\" of the therapist's self and that of the patient. She invites us to explore and process the relational dynamics of the therapeutic dyad within the consulting room. In tribute to Ehrenberg's work, we reflect on two individuals closed up in their self-reliance, who start to break open to their desires for intimacy when their therapist opens up his own self within the uniquely meaningful space co-created in the analytic therapy.\n\nInfluence of iron deficiency on the growth rate and physiological state of Prorocentrum micans Ehrenberg\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHuan-Xin, W.; Xiang-Wei, S.; Jing-Ke, W.; Ya-Chao, Q.\n\n2004-12-01\n\nPrevious researches had shown that iron is an important limiting element to marine primary production. However, the mechanism of how iron affects marine algae is not well understood. Prorocentrum micans Ehrenberg is an armoured marine planktonic dinoflagellate, which causes harmful red tide when blooming. In this research, we discussed the mechanism of iron deficiency affecting the growth rate and physiological state of P. micans Ehrenberg, based on the observation of the growth of P. micans Ehrenberg under iron deficiency. The results showed that the growth rate of P. micans Ehrenberg decreased under iron deficiency, as the time to reach the peak of cell numbers was delayed 3-4 days compared to the control group. Meanwhile, the maximal cell number and the concentration of chlorophyll a dropped slightly. Examination of cell morphology by transmission electron microscope showed that the arrangement of P. micans Ehrenberg chloroplast granum was disturbed under iron deficiency. The thylakoids exhibited twisted structure with larger interstices among the thylakoid layers. Chloroplast membrane system folded abnormally and fewer starch particles were synthesized and accumulated compared to the control group. In addition, many cavities appeared in mitochondria, and a few cells developed incomplete nuclear envelop. The energy spectrogram of the algal cells showed that the relative ratio of the contents of the elements in cell also changed as the degree of iron deficiency changed. The iron deficiency-induced morphological changes of P. micans Ehrenberg cell organelles may be due to the misfolding of some core proteins that originally require iron ion as folding center. The structural abnormality of the major cell organelles further led to the functional retardation or loss in photosynthesis, electron transport, and metabolism, which blocks normal growth of P. micans Ehrenberg. Taken together, the research helped to improve our understanding on the limiting effects of iron\n\nMayo's Older Americans Normative Studies (MOANS): Factor Structure of a Core Battery.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSmith, Glenn E.; And Others\n\n1992-01-01\n\nUsing the Mayo Older Americans Normative Studies (MOANS) group (526 55-to 97-year-old adults), factor models were examined for the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R); the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS); and a core battery of the WAIS-R, the WMS, and the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test.

They proposed a two-slit experiment, in which a magnetic flux is enclosed between interfering electron beams. Now, through access to modern nanotechnology tools, we used a focused ion beam to open two nanosized slits in a gold-coated silicon nitride membrane and focused electron beam induced deposition to fabricate a thin magnetic bar between the two slits. We then performed Fraunhofer experiments in a transmission electron microscope equipped with a field emission gun and a Lorentz lens. By tilting the specimen in the objective lens field of the electron microscope, the magnetization of the bar could be reversed and the corresponding change in the phase of the electron wave observed directly in the form of a shift in the interference fringe pattern.\n\n[Fragments of a correspondence between the Parisian pharmacist Ãmile Vial and the Dutch painter Johan-Barthold Jongkind].\n\nPubMed\n\nDevaux, Guy\n\n2016-03-01\n\nWe study a series of exchanged original letters between the Parisian pharmacist art lover Ãmile Vial (1833-1917) and the Dutch painter Johan-Barthold Jongkind (1819 - 1891) from april 13th, 1876 till February 1th, 1887.\n\nA description of Apocarchesium rosettum n. gen., n. sp. and a redescription of Ophrydium eichornii Ehrenberg, 1838, two freshwater peritrichous ciliates from Japan.\n\nPubMed\n\nJi, Daode; Kusuoka, Yasushi\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis paper includes the proposal of a new genus for a new species of peritrichous ciliate, Apocarchesium rosettum n. gen., n. sp., as well as the first description by modern techniques of another peritrich, Ophrydium eichornii Ehrenberg, 1838. The genus Apocarchesium is separated from the related genus Carchesium by the appearance of the stalk and the arrangement of zooids, and diagnosed as follows: colonial vorticellid, with all zooids attached in rosette fashion to the tip of their common stalk, which is unbranched and contracts spirally; pellicle with parallel silverlines. The morphology, infraciliature, and silverline system of both species were investigated by observation in vivo and silver-staining methods.\n\nMorphological variation of dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima (Ehrenberg) Dodge with geographical difference.\n\nPubMed\n\nYoo, Jong Su\n\n2004-01-01\n\nProrocentrum lima (Ehrenberg) Dodge, one of the cosmopolitan dinoflagellates, is basically benthic and is found on the surface of macroalgae and detritus. The identification of this species requires detailed morphological observation because of its close similarity to other benthic Prorocentrum species. The purpose of this study is to detect the morphological variability of P. lima using culture clones collected from several areas to find an adequate way of subdividing the species. In this study, 33 clones of P. lima were collected from Saipan, Tahiti, Indonesia, Japan and Bermuda, and their thecal valves and periflagellar area were observed by means of light microscopy with differential interference contrast optics and scanning electron microscopy. In general cells have two centrally located pyrenoids and a posterior nucleus. The surface of both valves has many valve pores except the center. Evenly spaced marginal pores are located along the edge of the valves. P. lima samples studied herein were subdivided into four major types (ellipsoidal, general, short, and elongate ovoid) according to their shapes, length-to-width ratio and number of valve pores. The length-to-width ratios of ellipsoidal, general, short, and elongate ovoid types were 1.32, 1.33-1.43, 1.20-1.27, and 1.53-1.60 microm respectively. Also there were slight differences in the number of valve pores. The number of valve pores examined in this study ranges from 40 to 97: ellipsoidal, general, and short ovoid types range from 40 to 91, while an elongate ovoid type ranges from 80 to 97. The combination of valve shape, number of valve pores and length-to-width ratio provides useful information on the morphological variation of P. lima.\n\nBetween Patriotism and Nationalism: Johan Hendrik Swildens and the \"Pedagogy of the Patriotic Virtues\" in the United Dutch Provinces during the 1780s and 1790s\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHake, Barry\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThis article will focus upon the life and work of Johan Hendrik Swildens, who is widely recognized in the literature as one of the foremost spokesmen of the category of \"public educators\" who played a significant role in the dissemination of specific interpretations of 'constitutional enlightenment' that were endorsed by specific factions â¦\n\nA new species of Trichodina Ehrenberg, 1830 (Ciliophora: Trichodinidae) infecting farmed Clarias gariepinus (Burchell) (Siluriformes: Clariidae) in Cuba.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeÃ³n, Fernando Lucas Prats; PÃ©rez, Mercedes MartÃ­nez\n\n2017-11-01\n\nA new species of Trichodina Ehrenberg, 1830 collected from the skin and fins of farmed North African catfish Clarias gariepinus (Burchell) fingerlings, is described. The new species can be distinguished from other trichodinids by the characteristics of the adhesive disc, especially by the great number of denticles. Trichodina merciae n. sp. is morphologically similar to T. renicola (Mueller, 1931) and T. marplatensis Martorelli, Marcotegui & Alda, 2008, in the number of denticles, but differs in the morphometric data, denticle morphology, environment and location. Trichodina merciae n. sp. has broad sickle-shaped blades and thin, straight rays, while T. marplatensis has broad club-shaped blades and wide S-shaped rays. Besides, denticle length, blade length, ray length, width of central part and denticle span of the new species are greater than T. marplatensis. However, the diameter of denticle ring and the diameter of the central area in T. marplatensis is larger than the ones in T. merciae n. sp. This is the first record of freshwater ectoparasite trichodinid with an average number of denticles greater than 50.\n\nPrincipal reference section for part of the Eocene Ghazij Formation, Sarawan River area, Johan coal field, Balochistan, Pakistan\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nJohnson, Edward A.; Warwick, Peter D.; Khan, Intizar H.; Rana, Asif N.; Kazim, Mohsin A.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThe information presented on this sheet was collected as part of a joint U.S. Geological Survey-Geological Survey of Pakistan program sponsored by the U.S. Agency for International Development. As a project within this program, the coal-bearing Ghazij Formation (Eocene) was investigated in the northeastern part of Balochistan cast and south of the provincial capital of Quetta. Strata exposed in this area range in age from Permian to Holocene and crop out as a belt of folded and thrusted rocks that form a southeast-facing orocline. In this region of Pakistan, the Ghazij can usually be divided into three parts. The lower part is the thickest (probably more than 1,000 m) and consists of gray-weathering calcareous mudrock (shale, mudstone, and impure claystone) and a few tabular bodies of fine-to medium-grained calcareous sandstone. The middle part (27-300 m) consists of gray-weathering calcareous mudrock and tabular to lenticular bodies of fine-to medium-grained calcareous sandstone; beds of carbonaceous shale and coal are common. The upper part (as thick as 533 m) contains reddish-weathering calcareous mudrock that contains scattered lenticular bodies of fine- to medium-grained calcareous sandstone. Fossil plant debris is common in mudrock of the lower and middle parts of the Ghazij, and bivalves and gastropods are common in the middle part; the upper part of the Ghazij is usually unfossiliferous. This three-fold division of the Ghazij is less distinct in the Johan area. Here, the upper part of the formation is clearly identifiable, but rocks below it are poorly exposed and assigning a stratigraphic level that separates the middle and lower parts of the formation is problematic. Below the upper part of the formation is a thick sequence of greenish-gray calcareous mudrock that contains locally abundant plant debris and isolated bodies of brown-weathering sandstone. Rare carbonaceous shale and even rarer coal are present in the upper part of this sequence, and this\n\nDifferentiating Iconella from Surirella (Bacillariophyceae): typifying four Ehrenberg names and a preliminary checklist of the African taxa\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJahn, Regine; Kusber, Wolf-Henning; Cocquyt, Christine\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAbstract To comply with the new phylogeny within the Surirellales as supported by molecular and morphological data, re-evaluations and re-combinations of taxa from and within the genera Surirella, Cymatopleura, and Stenopterobia and with the re-established genus Iconella are necessary. Since the African diatom flora is rich with taxa from these genera, especially Iconella, and the authors have studied these taxa recently, describing also new taxa, a preliminary checklist of African Iconella and Surirella is here presented. 94 names are contained on this list. 57 taxa have been transferred to Iconella; 55 taxa were formerly ranked within Surirella and two taxa within Stenopterobia. 10 taxa have stayed within Surirella and six taxa have been transferred from Cymatopleura to Surirella. 20 Surirella and 1 Stenopterobia names are listed which are either unrevised or unrevisable since morphological data is missing. Four names and taxa described by Ehrenberg are here typified. Two had been transferred to Iconella already: Iconella bifrons (Ehrenb.) Ruck & Nakov and Iconella splendida (Ehrenb.) Ruck & Nakov. Two are re-transferred from Cymatopleura to Surirella: Surirella librile (Ehrenb.) Ehrenb. and Surirella undulata (Ehrenb.) Ehrenb.; both taxa are currently known by their younger synonyms: Cymatopleura solea (BrÃ©b.) W. Smith and Cymatopleura elliptica (BrÃ©b. ex KÃ¼tzing) W. Smith. Lectotypes for Iconella bifrons, I. splendida, Surirella librile, and S. undulata were designated.

Born and educated in Abo/Turku in the Finnish part of the Swedish Realm, he was invited as an assistant and collaborator of Leonhard Euler at the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg in 1768. After Euler's death in 1783 he inherited his mentor's chair and became professor of mathematics at the Petersburg Academy of Sciences, but survived only a year in this office. One of Lexell's first tasks in Saint Petersburg was to assist in the calculations involved in the Venus transit project of 1769. Under Euler's supervision, Lexell formulated a system of modeling equations involving the whole bulk of observation data obtained from all over the world. Thus, by searching (manually) the best estimate of the parallax with respect to all available measurements made of the Venus transit simultaneously, he anticipated later statistical modeling methods. The usual method at the time consisted of juxtaposing a pair of measurements at a time and taking a mean value of all the parallax values obtained in this way. What had started as an innocent, purely academic attempt to establish the solar parallax, soon escalated into a heated controversy of international dimensions. The roles played by Jerome de Lalande in Paris and Maximilian Hell in Vienna in this controversy are well known; Lexell's role less so. Our analysis has two aims. First, we elucidate Lexell's place in the international solar parallax controversy by making use of his published works as well as surviving parts of his correspondence. Second, we present the method used by Lexell and analyze his way of calculating the solar parallax.\n\nThe Effect of Advanced Education on the Retention and Promotion of Army Officers\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2007-03-01\n\n2 Ronal G.Ehrenberg, Robert S.Smith, Modern Labor Economics , Theory and Public Policy, (New York: Pearson Education, Inc, 2006...Ehrenberg and Robert S.

This study investigated two types of rutting vocalizations, the moan and the howl, of the Formosan sika deer C. n. taiouanus, including the acoustic characteristics of the vocalizations, the diurnal and seasonal variations of vocal activity, and individual acoustic variation and identification. The results showed that the sound levels were approximately 81-88 dB(A) for the moan and 92-96 dB(A) for the howl, at a distance of 7 m from the sources. From October 2006 to January 2007, eight days of continuous observations were conducted to record the type and amount of vocalizations. Both moan and howl began to occur in the middle of October and reached peaks in the middle and end of November. Thereafter, few vocalizations were recorded until mid-January 2007. Moreover, we found that 74.5% of the first portion of moan, 65.3% of the second portion of moan, and 64.2% of howl could be identified on an individual basis by using discriminant analysis with 200 iterations of cross-validation test. These results revealed that the sounds differed among individuals, and also that they could be correctly identified. Our findings add to the scientific knowledge of sika deer behavior and provide the basis for a novel method of monitoring sika deer populations.\n\nThe Returns to Human Capital Migration within the Department of Defense Civilian Internal Labor Market\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2005-09-01\n\na period of time from year 1 to year T â From Ronald Ehrenberg and Robert Smith.

Mineral phase assemblages, composition of coexisting pore water, and type and amount of hydrocarbon degradation products (HDP) are controlling factors in complex hydrogeochemical processes in hydrocarbon-bearing siliciclastic reservoirs, which have undergone different degrees of biodegradation. Moreover, the composition of coexisting gas (particularly CO2 partial pressure) results from different pathways of hydrogeochemical equilibration. In a first step we analysed recent and palaeo-OWCs in the Heidrun field. Anaerobic decomposition of oil components at the OWC resulted in the release of methane and carbon dioxide and subsequent dissolution of feldspars (anorthite and adularia) leading to the formation of secondary kaolinite and carbonate phases. Less intensively degraded hydrocarbons co-occur with calcite, whereas strongly degraded hydrocarbons co-occur with solid solution carbonate phase (siderite, magnesite, calcite) enriched in Î´13C. To test such processes quantitatively in a second step, CO2 equilibria and mass transfers induced by organic-inorganic interactions have been hydrogeochemically modelled in different semi-generic scenarios with data from the Norwegian continental shelf (acc. Smith & Ehrenberg 1989). The model is based on chemical thermodynamics and includes irreversible reactions representing hydrolytic disproportionation of hydrocarbons according to Seewald's (2006) overall reaction (1a) which is additionally applied in our modelling work in an extended form including acetic acid (1b): (1) R-CH2-CH2-CH3 + 4H2O -> R + 2CO2 + CH4 + 5H2, (2) R-CH2-CH2-CH3 + 4H2O -> R + 1.9CO2 + 0.1CH3COOH + 0.9CH4 + 5H2.

It causes chronic orofacial pain or oral burning sensation even in the absence of any detectable organic cause. The etiology of BMS is complex and multifactorial. It has been associated with menopause, trigger events and even genetic polymorphisms. Although its etiology remains unclear, there is still much evidence that psychological elements like stress, anxiety or depression do play a significant role. There are several studies in the literature which only report the association of BMS with psychological factors. But to the best of our knowledge, there is no such case reported in the literature which has actually highlighted the management of such a case with psychogenic elements involved. In this case report, apart from discussing the role of psychological factors, the treatment of BMS with emphasis on counseling is also emphasized. Further, it is of interest to know that such patients with psychologically induced burning mouth syndrome have to be evaluated to their deepest details. Even their commonly overlooked gestures and habits like watching a particular television soap opera may be involved in their disease process. It can be concluded that psychological counseling in general dental practice can provide an effective cure for chronic oral burning sensation with psychological factors involved.

Therefore, existing behavioural scales should be revised to enhance their content and validity for use in these patients. The aim was to evaluate the content relevance of behaviours and autonomic responses for pain assessment of brain-injured ICU patients from the perspective of critical care clinicians. A total of 77 clinicians from four adult neuroscience ICUs (three from Canada and one from the United States) participated in this descriptive study. A physician/nurse ratio of 21% (13/61) was reached in this quota sample, and three physiotherapists also participated. They completed a content validation questionnaire of 19 items rated on clarity and relevance based on the patient's LOC. Item Content Validity Index (I-CVI), and modified kappa (Îº*) were calculated. Values higher than 0.78 and 0.75 respectively were considered excellent. Regardless of the patient's LOC, brow lowering, grimacing, and trying to reach the pain site were rated as the most relevant behaviours by clinicians, with excellent values of I-CVI>0.78 and Îº*>0.75. Eyes tightly closed, moaning and verbal complaints of pain also obtained excellent values in altered LOC and conscious patients. Eye weeping obtained excellent values only in conscious patients. Other items showed fair (0.40-0.59) to good (0.60-0.74) values, while blinking and coughing showed poor values (<0.40) at various LOC. Facial expressions, movements towards the pain site, and vocalisation of pain were the most relevant pain-related behaviours rated by critical care clinicians. The relevance of some behaviours (e.g., moaning and verbal complaints of pain) varied across LOCs, thereby calling forth adaptations of behavioural pain scales to allow for interpretation in the context of a patient's LOC and ability to express specific behaviours\n\nThe Institutionalization of Drug Trafficking Organizations: Comparing Colombia and Brazil\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2010-09-01\n\nShifter, âLatin America’s Drug Problem,â Current History (February 2007): 58. 6 Henry Veltmeyer and James Petras , âSocial Structure and Change in Latin...In The Oxford Handbook of Public Policy, by Michael Moran, Martin Rein and Robert E.

An observational study.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrand, H S; Bekker, W; Baart, J A\n\n2009-11-01\n\nLocal anaesthesia is increasingly used by dental hygienists. As little is known about the incidence of adverse effects during and after the administration of local anaesthetics, we evaluated side-effects associated with local anaesthesia. A prospective observational study was conducted using standard criteria among a group of 103 patients receiving mandibular block anaesthesia. Physical reactions like clenching fists (14.5%), moaning (12.6%) and turning pale (7.8%) were frequently observed. Patients (3.8%) showed a painful reaction because of needle contact with a nerve or the periosteum. Systemic complications were not observed. After the injection, 41.7% said they felt tense during the administration; 4.9% of the patients reported swallowing problems and 3.9% a tachycardia. These results suggest that administration of local anaesthesia has a small risk of adverse events. Complications, if they occur, seem minor and transient in nature.\n\nFast separation of two trapped ions (Open Access, Publisher’s Version)\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2015-09-17\n\nof quantum states and separation of ions in a dual rf ion trapQuantum Inf.

Methods: Fifteen consecutive subjects meeting criteria for PANS (mean age = 7.2 y; range 3â10 y) underwent single-night full polysomnography (PSG) read by a pediatric neurologist. Results: Thirteen of 15 subjects (87%) had abnormalities detected with PSG. Twelve of 15 had evidence of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep motor disinhibition, as characterized by excessive movement, laughing, hand stereotypies, moaning, or the continuation of periodic limb movements during sleep (PLMS) into REM sleep. Conclusions: This study shows various forms of REM sleep motor disinhibition present in a population of children with PANS.

Bowhead whale songs were detected almost continuously in the Chukchi Sea between October 30, 2007 and January 1, 2008 and twice from April 16 to May 5, 2008 during a long-term deployment of five acoustic recorders moored off Point Lay and Wainwright, AK, between October 21, 2007 and August 3, 2008. Two complex and four simple songs were detected. The complex songs consisted of highly stereotyped sequences of four units. The simple songs were primarily made of sequences of two to three moan types whose repetition patterns were constant over short periods but more variable over time. Multiple song types were recorded simultaneously and there is evidence of synchronized song variation over time. The implications of the spatiotemporal distribution of song detection with respect to the migratory and mating behavior of western Arctic bowheads are discussed.\n\nComplete genome sequence of the termite hindgut bacterium Spirochaeta coccoides type strain (SPN1T), reclassification in the genus Sphaerochaeta as Sphaerochaeta coccoides comb. nov. and emendations of the family Spirochaetaceae and the genus Sphaerochaeta\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAbt, Birte; Han, Cliff; Scheuner, Carmen\n\n2012-05-25\n\nSpirochaeta coccoides DrÃ¶ge et al. 2006 is a member of the genus Spirochaeta Ehrenberg 1835, one of the oldest named genera within the Bacteria.

Extracts of Sargassum thunbergii (Mertens ex Roth) Kuntz tissue had stronger inhibitory effects than those of either Sargassum pallidum (Turner) C. Agardh or Sargassum kjellmanianum Yendo on the growths of Heterosigma akashiwo (Hada) Hada, Skeletonema costatum (Grev.) Grev, and Prorocentrum micans Ehrenberg. Methanol extracts of S. thunbergii were further divided into petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, butanol, and distilled water phases by liquid-liquid fractionation. The petroleum ether and ethyl acetate fractions had strong algicidal effects on the microalgae. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses of these two phases identified nine fatty acids, most of which were unsaturated fatty acids. In addition, pure compounds of four of the nine unsaturated fatty acids had effective concentrations below 5 mg/L. Therefore, unsaturated fatty acids are a component of the allelochemicals in S. thunbergii tissue.\n\nDesign, synthesis, and biological evaluation of novel iso-D-2',3'-dideoxy-3'-fluorothianucleoside derivatives.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Kyung Ran; Moon, Hyung Ryong; Park, Ah-Young; Chun, Moon Woo; Jeong, Lak Shin\n\n2007-01-01\n\nNovel iso-d-2',3'-dideoxythianucleoside derivatives 1-4 were designed and asymmetrically synthesized as a bioisostere of lamivudine to search for new anti-HIV agents.

We must regain the sense of excitement about our specialty and refocus training for residents and practicing surgeons toward those skills necessary to provide the full range of therapies at the highest level. Attaining these goals will require embracing, obtaining, and applying endovascular expertise throughout the vascular workforce. We can no longer moan and whine over encroachments into our turf by nonsurgeons. We must make our own opportunities. Changes in our attitude, our identity, and our structure will be necessary to do so. Our ability to make change will depend upon our values, defined as the judgment as to whether we remain a derivative of our general surgical roots (with continued emphasis on improved quality from traditional operations) or embrace the disruptive technology of endoluminal therapy as the next iteration of vascular surgical practice. We cannot do both because the preparation for the latter precludes the former. We are at a crossroads because if we accept endovascular technologies as critical to our future, our path is clear.\n\nVariability of Female Responses to Conspecific vs. Heterospecific Male Mating Calls in Polygynous Deer: An Open Door to Hybridization?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWyman, Megan T.; Charlton, Benjamin D.; Locatelli, Yann; Reby, David\n\n2011-01-01\n\nMales of all polygynous deer species (Cervinae) give conspicuous calls during the reproductive season. The extreme interspecific diversity that characterizes these vocalizations suggests that they play a strong role in species discrimination. However, interbreeding between several species of Cervinae indicates permeable interspecific reproductive barriers. This study examines the contribution of vocal behavior to female species discrimination and mating preferences in two closely related polygynous deer species known to hybridize in the wild after introductions. Specifically, we investigate the reaction of estrous female red deer (Cervus elaphus) to playbacks of red deer vs. sika deer (Cervus nippon) male mating calls, with the prediction that females will prefer conspecific calls. While on average female red deer preferred male red deer roars, two out of twenty females spent more time in close proximity to the speaker broadcasting male sika deer moans. We suggest that this absence of strict vocal preference for species-specific mating calls may contribute to the permeability of pre-zygotic reproductive barriers observed between these species. Our results also highlight the importance of examining inter-individual variation when studying the role of female preferences in species discrimination and intraspecific mate selection.

The validity was tested against the criterion measure of 200 m track-and-field (track-and-field athletes, n = 8) and 20 m shuttle run endurance test (female soccer players, n = 20). Intra-unit and inter-unit reliability was tested by intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV), respectively. An analysis of variance examined differences between the GPS measurement and five laps of 200 m at 15 km/h, and t -test examined differences between the GPS measurement and 20 m shuttle run endurance test. The difference between the GPS measurement and 200 m distance ranged from -0.13 Â± 3.94 m (95% CI -3.42; 3.17) in the first lap to 2.13 Â± 2.64 m (95% CI -0.08; 4.33) in the fifth lap. A good intra-unit reliability was observed in 200 m (ICC = 0.833, 95% CI 0.535; 0.962). Inter-unit CV ranged from 1.31% (fifth lap) to 2.20% (third lap). The difference between the GPS measurement and 20 m shuttle run endurance test ranged from 0.33 Â± 4.16 m (95% CI -10.01; 10.68) in 11.5 km/h to 9.00 Â± 5.30 m (95% CI 6.44; 11.56) in 8.0 km/h. A moderate intra-unit reliability was shown in the second and third stage of the 20 m shuttle run endurance test (ICC = 0.718, 95% CI 0.222;0.898) and good reliability in the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth (ICC = 0.831, 95% CI -0.229;0.996). Inter-unit CV ranged from 2.08% (11.5 km/h) to 3.92% (8.5 km/h). Based on these findings, it was concluded that the 10 Hz Johan system offers an affordable valid and reliable tool for coaches and fitness trainers to monitor training and performance.\n\nChecklist and distribution of ciliates from the family Euplotidae Ehrenberg, 1838 (Protista: Ciliophora: Spirotrichea) in Slovakia, Central Europe.\n\nPubMed\n\nTirjakovÃ¡, Eva; BotlÃ­kovÃ¡, Simona; VÄaÄnÃ½, Peter\n\n2015-02-20\n\nA checklist of ciliates from the family Euplotidae recorded in the territory of Slovakia, Central Europe was assembled. Altogether, 11 species belonging to three genera of the family Euplotidae have been reported there: Euplotes alatus, Euplotes charon, Euplotes moebiusi, Euplotoides aediculatus, Euplotoides eurystomus, Euplotoides patella, Euplotoides woodruffi, Euplotopsis affinis, Euplotopsis finki, Euplotopsis muscicola, and Euplotopsis novemcarinata. However, records of the marine species E. alatus and E. charon are doubtful and very likely represent misidentifications of E. moebiusi. Since the euryhaline species E. woodruffi was found for the first time in Slovakia, its morphology is described. Based on the literature data and our own observations, the present checklist is also accompanied with distribution data on the 11 aforementioned species. As concerns ecology, Slovak euplotids typically occurred in freshwater bodies having higher trophic levels. Only two species, E. finki and E. muscicola, were isolated from terrestrial habitats, especially, from mosses, leaf-litter, and decaying wood mass.\n\nThe Evolutionary Relationships between Endosymbiotic Green Algae of Paramecium bursaria Syngens Originating from Different Geographical Locations.\n\nPubMed\n\nZagata, Patrycja; Greczek-Stachura, Magdalena; Tarcz, Sebastian; Rautian, Maria\n\n2016-01-01\n\nParamecium bursaria (Ehrenberg 1831), a freshwater ciliate, typically harbors hundreds of green algal symbionts inside the cell. The aim of present study was the molecular identification of newly analyzed P. bursaria symbionts. The second aspect of the present survey was testing a hypothesis whether endosymbionts prefer the specified syngen of the host, and the specified geographical distribution. Ten strains of endosymbionts isolated from strains of P. bursaria originating from different geographical locations were studied. We analyzed for the first time, both the fragment of plastid genome containing 3'rpl36-5' infA genes and a fragment of a nuclear gene encoding large subunit ribosomal RNA (LSU rDNA). The analysis of the LSU rDNA sequences showed the existence of 3 haplotypes and the haplotype diversity of 0.733, and 8 haplotypes for the 3'rpl36-5' infA gene fragment and haplotype diversity of 0.956. The endosymbionts isolated from P. bursaria strains were identified as Chlorella vulgaris, Ch. variabilis and Micractinium conductrix. There was no correlation between the syngen of P. bursaria and the species of endosymbiont.\n\nInhibition of coral fertilisation and larval metamorphosis by tributyltin and copper.\n\nPubMed\n\nNegri, A P; Heyward, A J\n\n2001-02-01\n\nFertilisation and larval metamorphosis of reef-building corals are important life history events leading to recruitment of juvenile corals to reef populations. Little is known of the sensitivity of these early life phases to pollution, or their relative susceptibility to certain toxicants compared with established coral colonies. Inhibition of fertilisation and larval metamorphosis of the coral Acropora millepora (Ehrenberg, 1834) was assessed in response to solutions of the antifoulants tributyltin (TBT) and copper (Cu) using laboratory-based bioassays. Nominal concentrations that inhibited 50% fertilisation and metamorphosis (IC50) were calculated from 4 h fertilisation and 24 h metamorphosis assays and were based on introduced dose. Cu was most potent towards fertilisation with an IC50 of 17.4 micrograms/l. TBT however, proved more toxic to larval metamorphosis having an IC50 of 2.0 micrograms/l. Inert surfaces coated with either Cu- or TBT-based antifouling paint also inhibited fertilisation and metamorphosis. The degree of inhibition was correlated with surface area of the paint coating. These results indicate fertilisation and metamorphosis of coral can be sensitive to active components of antifouling paints.\n\nTaxonomy and distribution of the genus Muelleria frenguelli\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSpaulding, S.A.; Stoermer, E.F.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nNavicula gibbula Cleve and its allies have a number of morphological characters which are visible under the light microscope and distinguish them from taxa included in Navicula Bory sensu stricto. These include proximal raphe ends which are sharply and unilaterally hooked and often extend beyond the central area, as well as two apparently thickened longitudinal ribs which extend the length of the valve on either side of the raphe. With the use of the SEM additional well-defined characters of the N. gibbula complex become apparent. Distal raphe ends are bifurcate and the valve face and mantle possess bipartite walls similar to those in Neidium Pfitzer. Furthermore, the apparently thickened longitudinal ribs are actually hollow canals, a feature reminiscent of the longitudinal canals of Diploneis Ehrenberg. Characters of the group are particularly well-defined and distinct from those of other genera, justifying separation from Navicula. Based on the valve morphology of N. gibbula and all other members of the section Naviculae fistulatae McCall, we separate these taxa from Navicula and resurrect the genus Muelleria Frenguelli to include them.\n\nContact Inhibition: Also a Control for Cell Proliferation in Unicellular Algae?\n\nPubMed\n\nCostas, E; Aguilera, A; Gonzalez-Gil, S; LÃ³pez-Rodas, V\n\n1993-02-01\n\nAccording to traditional views, the proliferation of unicellular algae is controlled primarily by environmental conditions. But as in mammalian cells, other biological mechanisms, such as growth factors, cellular aging, and contact inhibition, might also control algal proliferation. Here we ask whether contact inhibition regulates growth in several species of unicellular algae as it does in mammalian cells. Laboratory cultures of the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima (Ehrenberg) Dodge show contact inhibition at low cell density, so this would be an autocontrol mechanism of cell proliferation that could also act in natural populations of P. lima. But, Synechocystis spp., Phaeodactylum tricornutum (Bohlin), Skeletonema costatum (Greville), and Tetraselmis spp. do not exhibit contact inhibition in laboratory cultures because they are able to grow at high cellular density. Apparently their growth is limited by nutrient depletion or catabolite accumulation instead of contact inhibition. Spirogyra insignis (Hassall) Kutz, Prorocentrum triestinum Schiller, and Alexandrium tamarense (Halim) Balech show a complex response, as they are able to grow in both low and high cell density medium. These results suggest that contact inhibition is more adaptative in benthic unicellular algae.\n\nPrincipal reference section for part of the Eocene Ghazij Formation, Moghal Mine area, Mach coal field, Balochistan, Pakistan\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nJohnson, Edward A.; Warwick, Peter D.; Khan, Intizar H.; Kazim, Mohsin A.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThe information presented on this sheet was collected as part of a joint U.S. Geological Survey-Geological Survey of Pakistan program sponsored by the U.S. Agency for International Development. As a project within this program, the coal-bearing Ghazij Formation (Eocene) was investigated in the northeastern part of Balochistan cast and south of the provincial capital of Quetta. Strata exposed in this area range in age from Permian to Holocene and crop out as a belt of folded and thrusted rocks that form a southeast-facing orocline. In this region of Pakistan, the Ghazij can usually be divided into three parts. The lower part is the thickest (probably more than 1,000 m) and consists of gray-weathering calcareous mudrock (shale, mudstone, and impure claystone) and a few tabular bodies of fine-to medium-grained calcareous sandstone. The middle part (27-300 m) consists of gray-weathering calcareous mudrock and tabular to lenticular bodies of fine-to medium-grained calcareous sandstone; beds of carbonaceous shale and coal are common. The upper part (as thick as 533 m) contains reddish-weathering calcareous mudrock that contains scattered lenticular bodies of fine- to medium-grained calcareous sandstone. Fossil plant debris is common in mudrock of the lower and middle parts of the Ghazij, and bivalves and gastropods are common in the middle part; the upper part of the Ghazij is usually unfossiliferous. This three-fold division of the Ghazij is less distinct in the Johan area. Here, the upper part of the formation is clearly identifiable, but rocks below it are poorly exposed and assigning a stratigraphic level that separates the middle and lower parts of the formation is problematic. Below the upper part of the formation is a thick sequence of greenish-gray calcareous mudrock that contains locally abundant plant debris and isolated bodies of brown-weathering sandstone. Rare carbonaceous shale and even rarer coal are present in the upper part of this sequence, and this\n\nProductivity aspects of three tropical seagrass species in areas of different nutrient levels in Kenya\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nUku, J.; BjÃ¶rk, M.\n\n2005-05-01\n\nPrevious work conducted in two seagrass areas of different nutrient status, along the Kenyan coast, has shown that the seagrasses were characterised by differences in the species composition and biomass of epiphytic algae. This study was undertaken to evaluate the productivity patterns of the seagrass species growing in these same sites. Studies were made on Thalassodendron ciliatum (ForskÃ¥l) den Hartog, Thalassia hemprichii (Ehrenberg) Aschers and Cymodocea rotundata Ehrenberg and Hempr. ex Ascherson growing in the lagoons of Nyali and Vipingo, along the Kenyan coast, during the South East (SE) and North East (NE) monsoon periods. The results of this study revealed differences in the levels of nitrate within the water column, with Vipingo having lower levels of around 4 Î¼M during the low tide period of the SE monsoon while nitrate levels in Nyali reached levels of 16 Î¼M during the same period. Of the three seagrass species studied, C. rotundata had the highest shoot densities in both sites. The shoot densities of C. rotundata reached levels of 1300 shoots m -2 compared to an average of 600 shoots m -2 for both T. ciliatum and T. hemprichii. The stems of T. ciliatum were found to be 200 mm long in Nyali whereas those in Vipingo were 80 mm in length. Of the three seagrasses T. ciliatum and T. hemprichii showed significant differences in total leaf growth between the two sites. However, of these two species, only T. hemprichii showed distinct differences in leaf production and biomass when the two sites were compared. Leaves of T. hemprichii showed growth rates of 0.008 g dw shoot -1âday -1 in Nyali while the growth rate in Vipingo was 0.004 g dw shoot -1âday -1. Leaf production rates were approximately 0.005 g dw shoot -1âday -1 for T. ciliatum in both Nyali and Vipingo and that of C. rotundata was approximately 0.0015 g dw shoot -1âday -1 in the two sites. This suggests that of the three species studied, T. hemprichii may have been influenced by the\n\n[The proof of paternity. An andrological-forensic challenge in historical perspective].\n\nPubMed\n\nAlbrecht, K; Schultheiss, D\n\n2004-10-01\n\nFor centuries, difficulties have occurred in determining unresolved paternities. In addition to the modern standard methods, such as the examination of DNA or serological proof, expert opinion on fertility once played an important role. The andrological difference between incapability to fertilise and the inability to participate in sexual intercourse was also distinguished historically. Of special significance was the discovery of spermatozoa by the medical student Johan Ham in 1677 and their further investigation by Antoni van Leeuwenhoek.Recently, modern DNA methods have also been applied for historical investigations. Illustrious examples are the DNA analysis in the case of Kaspar Hauser of Ansbach and the dispute about Thomas Jefferson, President of the U.S., fathering a child by one of his slaves. In this discourse, a medicinal-forensic review of the development of expert opinion, illustrated with historical case studies, is given.\n\nThe vocal repertoire of the African Penguin (Spheniscus demersus): structure and function of calls.\n\nPubMed\n\nFavaro, Livio; Ozella, Laura; Pessani, Daniela\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe African Penguin (Spheniscus demersus) is a highly social and vocal seabird. However, currently available descriptions of the vocal repertoire of African Penguin are mostly limited to basic descriptions of calls. Here we provide, for the first time, a detailed description of the vocal behaviour of this species by collecting audio and video recordings from a large captive colony. We combine visual examinations of spectrograms with spectral and temporal acoustic analyses to determine vocal categories. Moreover, we used a principal component analysis, followed by signal classification with a discriminant function analysis, for statistical validation of the vocalisation types. In addition, we identified the behavioural contexts in which calls were uttered. The results show that four basic vocalisations can be found in the vocal repertoire of adult African Penguin, namely a contact call emitted by isolated birds, an agonistic call used in aggressive interactions, an ecstatic display song uttered by single birds, and a mutual display song vocalised by pairs, at their nests. Moreover, we identified two distinct vocalisations interpreted as begging calls by nesting chicks (begging peep) and unweaned juveniles (begging moan). Finally, we discussed the importance of specific acoustic parameters in classifying calls and the possible use of the source-filter theory of vocal production to study penguin vocalisations.\n\n[Rudolph Tegner: The blind from Marrakech (1949-1950)].\n\nPubMed\n\nNorn, M; Permin, H\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThe Danish sculptor and painter Rudolph Tegner (1873-1950) has built his own Museum in Dronningmolle, where his sculptures enrich the unique landscape. His last and incomplete plaster on a simple, raw wooden scaffold sculpture The Blind from Marrakech (Fig. 1) show five persons moan about, carrying a dead body. All persons are missing their arms. Tegner had a number of years earlier been in Marrakech and had watched a funeral procession, where blind beggars had carried a dead old woman raised high above the bearers on a kind of pall. In a small version of the statue cast, later in bronze from 1963, showed 15 bearers, on both sides of the bier (Fig. 2 & 3). Nine and 15 bearers are looking up, two right in front, and the rest are looking down. Totally blind people can not see the light but can see up to the divine Heaven. Some blind have kept the gleam. The confusion with the eye direction shows that they really are blind. However 10 of the 15 blind people had hollow in the eye (excenteratio orbitae) in contrast to the dead woman. The dead woman had been the blinds' mistress. The last work The Blind in Marrakech may also be the despair of the artist.\n\nLow-frequency whale and seismic airgun sounds recorded in the mid-Atlantic Ocean.\n\nPubMed\n\nNieukirk, Sharon L; Stafford, Kathleen M; Mellinger, David K; Dziak, Robert P; Fox, Christopher G\n\n2004-04-01\n\nBeginning in February 1999, an array of six autonomous hydrophones was moored near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (35 degrees N-15 degrees N, 50 degrees W-33 degrees W). Two years of data were reviewed for whale vocalizations by visually examining spectrograms. Four distinct sounds were detected that are believed to be of biological origin: (1) a two-part low-frequency moan at roughly 18 Hz lasting 25 s which has previously been attributed to blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus); (2) series of short pulses approximately 18 s apart centered at 22 Hz, which are likely produced by fin whales (B. physalus); (3) series of short, pulsive sounds at 30 Hz and above and approximately 1 s apart that resemble sounds attributed to minke whales (B. acutorostrata); and (4) downswept, pulsive sounds above 30 Hz that are likely from baleen whales. Vocalizations were detected most often in the winter, and blue- and fin whale sounds were detected most often on the northern hydrophones. Sounds from seismic airguns were recorded frequently, particularly during summer, from locations over 3000 km from this array. Whales were detected by these hydrophones despite its location in a very remote part of the Atlantic Ocean that has traditionally been difficult to survey.\n\nIs in vitro micrografting a possible valid alternative to traditional micropropagation in Cactaceae? Pelecyphora aselliformis as a case study.\n\nPubMed\n\nBadalamenti, Ornella; Carra, Angela; Oddo, Elisabetta; Carimi, Francesco; Sajeva, Maurizio\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSeveral taxa of Cactaceae are endangered by overcollection for commercial purposes, and most of the family is included in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES). Micropropagation may play a key role to keep the pressure off wild populations and contribute to ex situ conservation of endangered taxa. One of the limits of micropropagation is the species-specific requirement of plant regulators for each taxon and sometimes even for different genotypes. With the micrografting technique the rootstock directly provides the scion with the necessary hormonal requirements. In this paper we present data on in vitro grafting of Pelecyphora aselliformis Ehrenberg, an Appendix I CITES listed species critically endangered and sought after by the horticultural trade, on micropropagated Opuntia ficus-indica Miller. Apical and sub-apical scions of P. aselliformis were used to perform micrografting with a successful rate of 97 and 81Â % respectively. Survival rate after ex vivo transfer was 85Â %. We hypothesize that this method could be applied to other endangered, slow growing taxa of Cactaceae thus contributing to the conservation of this endangered family.\n\nA sociological stance on fatigue and tiredness: Social inequalities, norms and representations.\n\nPubMed\n\nLoriol, Marc\n\n2017-04-01\n\nFatigue is complex, representing simultaneously a physiological, psychological and social phenomenon. The sociological approach attempts to understand the experience of fatigue and its characterization at diverse periods and in various social contexts. After giving a sociological history of different forms of fatigue through the ages (acedia, melancholy, neurasthenia, chronic fatigue syndrome, etc.), this article proposes a social epidemiology of fatigue in the current period. Objectification of working and living conditions allows us to illustrate social inequalities in fatigue and exhaustion, but seems to contradict dominant social representations of fatigue today. It invites a critical discussion of contemporary theories of fatigue (such those of Alain Ehrenberg or Byung-Chul Han), which consider that fatigue is a condition of modern man, overwhelmed by his freedom. More modestly, analysis of the fatigue presented here rests on the capacity to be able to find a good balance between too much investment in work or life (which is exhausting) and not enough investment (which leads to boredom and lack of self-fulfillment). This balance depends on fragile and specific social norms in different professional or social circles and cannot be defined a priori. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

As health workers deal with increased incidences of diabetes and other obesity-related disorders, policymakers have examined the factors contributing to this problem. In particular, advertising that promotes high fat and high sugar products to children has come under increasing scrutiny. Advertisers have rejected claims that advertising contributes to obesity by arguing that it cannot coerce people into purchasing a product, and does not affect primary demand. This reasoning overlooks the role advertising plays in reinforcing and normalising behavior, however, and it assumes that only direct causal links merit regulatory attention. Ehrenberg's \"weak\" theory suggests advertising will support unhealthy eating behaviors, while the wide range of sales promotions employed will prompt trial and reward continued consumption. This article presents an alternative analysis of how marketing contributes to obesity and uses behavior modification theory to analyse the \"fast-food\" industry's promotions. We also review the New Zealand government's response to obesity and suggest policy interventions that would foster healthier eating behaviors.\n\nWhy Can't We Resolve Recruitment?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFerreira, S. A.; Payne, M. R.; HÃ¡tÃºn, H.; MacKenzie, B. R.; ButenschÃ¶n, M.; Visser, A. W.\n\n2016-02-01\n\nDuring the last century, Johan Hjort's work has lead to signicant advances in explaining anomalous year-classes within sheries science. However, distinguishing between the competing mechanisms of year-class regulation (e.g., food conditions, predation, transport) has proved challenging. We use blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) in the North-east Atlantic Ocean as a case study, which, during the late 1990s and early 2000s, generated year-classes up to nearly an order of magnitude higher than those seen before or after. There presently exists no models that can quantify past variations in recruitment for this stock. Using modern stock-statistical and observational tools, we catalog a range of environmentally-driven hypotheses relevant for recruitment of blue whiting, including physical and biogeographic conditions, phenology, parental effects and predation. We have run the analyses to test some hypotheses and results will be presented at the session.\n\nLinnaeans outdoors: the transformative role of studying nature 'on the move' and outside.\n\nPubMed\n\nHodacs, Hanna\n\n2011-06-01\n\nTravelling is an activity closely associated with Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1778) and his circle of students. This article discusses the transformative role of studying nature outdoors (turning novices into naturalists) in eighteenth-century Sweden, using the little-known journeys of Carl BÃ¤ck (1760-1776), Sven Anders Hedin (1750-1821) and Johan Lindwall (1743-1796) as examples. On these journeys, through different parts of Sweden in the 1770s, the outdoors was used, simultaneously, as both a classroom and a space for exploration. The article argues that this multifunctional use of the landscape (common within the Linnaean tradition) encouraged a democratization of the consumption of scientific knowledge and also, to some degree, of its production. More generally, the study also addresses issues of how and why science and scientists travel by discussing how botanical knowledge was reproduced and extended 'on the move', and what got senior and junior students moving.\n\nPlaying With Antidepressants: Perspectives From Indian Australians and Anglo-Australians Living With Depression.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrijnath, Bianca; Antoniades, Josefine\n\n2017-11-01\n\nPatient perspectives were explored on the meaning and experience of antidepressant use by applying Johan Huizinga's theory of play to interviews from Indian Australians and Anglo-Australians diagnosed with depression. Through the analysis, the centrality of Huizinga's \"magic circle\" emerged, that is, defining the boundaries within which one could safely play. Consumption of antidepressants involved learning, breaking, and modulating rules of the game of adherence, then forging a new \"magic circle.\" In these games, there were playful elements including experimentation, improvisation, absorption, and experiential learning. This application of Huizinga's theory in relation to antidepressant use is a novel approach in the literature on medication non/adherence. This application not only opens a new theoretical line of inquiry but also shows that antidepressant non/adherence is not a static practice but dynamic and changing, revealing critical insights around participant's agency, capabilities, desires, and notions of selfhood with regard to managing their depression and conceptualizing their recovery.\n\nBingo!

Herein, we report a \"historic\" and fatal case. A 52-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department presenting crusted dermatitis together with extreme deterioration of her general condition. Her general practitioner had initiated dermo-corticosteroid therapy for suspected atopic dermatitis two months earlier, and she had been confined to bed for the previous 10Â days. Her son presented pruritus that became worse at night. On examination the patient was moaning, dehydrated and confused and her entire skin was hyperkeratotic, with very thick, yellowish, cracked crusts covering 40Â % of her body. Tests indicated severe water and electrolytic disorders as well as Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. A tape test established the diagnosis of crusted scabies. The severity was gradeÂ III on the Davis clinical grading scale. The patient showed signs of multi-organ failure and was transferred to intensive care, but she died during the night. This case is remarkable for its historic severity. In France, scabies infestation is a re-emerging disease and has been a public health priority since 2012. The rare hyperkeratotic form is not fully understood and frequently diagnosed late, in some cases with a fatal outcome. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Only a few cases have been reported in the literature. We describe here two cases of sexsomnia that took place in adult women whose personal history was remarkable for traumatic sexual psychological stress during childhood. In addition, the first patient had a medical history of alcoholism during adolescence and current sleepwalking. In the second patient, drug consumption was reported during adolescence, and psychiatric assessment found a major depressive disorder. Neurological examination was normal for both patients. The sexual behaviour was reported by the bed partner because of total amnesia of the event by the patients. Events included moaning, vocalizations with dirty talk, masturbation, sexual assault, and sexual intercourse. The behaviour was harmful for the bed partner in the second case. For both patients, electroencephalogram and brain magnetic resonance imaging were normal whereas nocturnal polysomnography recordings revealed several abrupt and spontaneous arousals from slow-wave sleep. Patients were successfully treated by serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Our observations underline the fact that efforts need to be made to increase awareness of the issue of sexsomnia, in order to identify patients suffering from this atypical parasomnia, which can be associated with adverse psychological consequences and serious medico-legal issues. 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Midazolam is a rapid-onset, short-acting benzodiazepine which is used safely to reduce pain in children. We evaluated the practicability of intranasal midazolam sedation in a suburban hospital in Luanda (Angola), during the surgical procedures. Intranasal midazolam solution was administered at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg. Using the Ramsay's reactivity score, we gave a score to four different types of children's behaviour: moaning, shouting, crying and struggling, and the surgeon evaluated the ease of completing the surgical procedure using scores from 0 (very easy) to 3 (managing with difficulty). Eighty children (median age, 3 years) were recruited, and 140 surgical procedures were performed. Fifty-two children were treated with midazolam during 85 procedures, and 28 children were not treated during 55 procedures. We found a significant difference between the two groups on the shouting, crying and struggling parameters (p < 0.001). The mean score of the ease of completing the procedures was significantly different among the two groups (p < 0.0001). These results provide a model of procedural sedation in ambulatory surgical procedures in poor countries, thus abolishing pain and making the surgeon's job easier.

Supported by a multiparametric acoustic analysis it was possible to distinguish one inspiratory and eleven expiratory call types. Most of the call types appeared within the first two months; some emerged in the majority of infants not until the 5th (\"laugh\") or 7th month (\"babble\"). Age-related changes in acoustic structure were found in only 4 call types (\"discomfort cry,\" \"short discomfort cry,\" \"wail,\" \"moan\"). The acoustic changes were characterized mainly by an increase in harmonic-to-noise ratio and homogeneity of the call, a decrease in frequency range and a downward shift of acoustic energy from higher to lower frequencies. Emotion-related differences were found in the acoustic structure of single call types as well as in the frequency of occurrence of different call types. A change from positive to negative emotional state was accompanied by an increase in call duration, frequency range, and peak frequency (frequency with the highest amplitude within the power spectrum). Negative emotions, in addition, were characterized by a significantly higher rate of \"crying,\" \"hic\" and \"ingressive vocalizations\" than positive emotions, while positive emotions showed a significantly higher rate of \"babble,\" \"laugh,\" and \"raspberry.\"\n\nTrichodesmium erythraeum (Ehrenberg) bloom along the southwest coast of India (Arabian Sea) and its impact on trace metal concentrations in seawater\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKrishnan, Anoop A.; Krishnakumar, P. K.; Rajagopalan, M.\n\n2007-02-01\n\nThe incidence of a large scale Trichodesmium erythraeum bloom along the southwest coast of India (Arabian Sea) observed in May 2005 is reported. Around 4802 filaments of T. erythraeum ml -1 seawater was observed and a colony consisted of 3.6 Ã 10 5 cells. The bloom was predominant off Suratkal (12Â° 59'N and 74Â° 31'E) with a depth of about 47 m, covering an area of 7 km in length and 2 km width. The concentrations of Zinc, Cadmium, Lead, Copper, Nickel and Cobalt were determined in samples collected from the bloom and non-bloom sites using stripping voltammetry. The observed hydrographical and meteorological parameters were found to be favorable for the bloom. The concentrations of Zinc, Cadmium and Nickel were found to be higher at bloom stations, while the concentrations of Lead, Copper and Cobalt were found to be very low at bloom stations. Elevated concentrations of Cadmium and Cobalt were observed at Valappad mainly due to the decomposition of detrital material produced in the bloom. Statistically significant differences ( P > 0.01) in metal concentrations between the bloom and non-bloom stations were not observed except for Copper. Metals such as Lead, Copper and Cobalt were removed from the seawater at all places where bloom was observed. Cadmium was found to be slowly released during the decaying process of the bloom.\n\nMoral differences in deep continuous palliative sedation and euthanasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nJuth, Niklas; Lindblad, Anna; LynÃ¶e, Niels; SjÃ¶strand, Manne; Helgesson, Gert\n\n2013-06-01\n\nIn palliative care there is much debate about which end of life treatment strategies are legitimate and which are not. Some writers argue that there is an important moral dividing-line between palliative sedation and euthanasia, making the first acceptable and the latter not. We have questioned this. In a recent article, Lars Johan Materstvedt has argued that we are wrong on two accounts: first, that we fail to account properly for the moral difference between continuous deep palliative sedation at the end of life and euthanasia, and, second, that we fail to account properly for the difference between permanent loss of consciousness and death. Regarding the first objection, we argue that Materstvedt misses the point: we agree that there is a difference in terms of intentions between continuous deep palliative sedation and euthanasia, but we question whether this conceptual difference makes up for a moral difference. Materstvedt fails to show that it does. Regarding the second objection, we argue that if nothing else is at stake than the value of the patient's life, permanent unconsciousness and death are morally indifferent.\n\nParent-reported pain in Rett syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nSymons, Frank J; Byiers, Breanne; Tervo, Raymond C; Beisang, Arthur\n\n2013-08-01\n\nClinical reports suggest that patients with Rett syndrome (RTT) live with significant chronic health issues as well as severe motor and communication impairments. Consequently, patients with RTT may be at risk for living with pain but not having it recognized. The purpose of this preliminary study was to document parent reported estimates of pain frequency, pain communication, and pain source. Caregivers of 44 patients with clinically diagnosed RTT (mean RTT age = 21.5, SD = 13.5) completed a health survey about their daughter that contained a number of items specific to pain from the Non-Communicating Children's Pain Checklist - Revised Among survey responders, 24% reported that their child had experienced pain on 8 or more days (> 1 week) in the previous 30 days. The most frequent form of pain communication was facial expression (85%) and vocalization (82%, eg, moan, cry). The most commonly reported pain source was gastro-intestinal (66%). Pain frequency was significantly (P<0.05) correlated with age (0.41), number of pain sources (0.72), and number of health problems (0.45); and the number pain sources was significantly (P<0.05) correlated with number of health problems (0.67). These preliminary results suggest that pain is a problem for a significant subgroup of patients with RTT. Almost one quarter of respondents indicated their daughters experience over a week of pain per month. The frequent health and communication issues associated with RTT suggest an increased risk that pain may be overlooked or discounted in this vulnerable population.\n\nIn Situ Biological Contamination Studies of the Moon: Implications for Planetary Protection and Life Detection Missions\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGlavin, Daniel P.; Dworkin, Jason P.; Lupisella, Mark; Williams, David R.; Kminek, Gerhard; Rummel, John D.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nNASA and ESA have outlined visions for solar system exploration that will include a series of lunar robotic precursor missions to prepare for, and support a human return to the Moan, and future human exploration of Mars and other destinations, including possibly asteroids. One of the guiding principles for exploration is to pursue compelling scientific questions about the origin and evolution of life. The search for life on objects such as Mars will require careful operations, and that all systems be sufficiently cleaned and sterilized prior to launch to ensure that the scientific integrity of extraterrestrial samples is not jeopardized by terrestrial organic contamination. Under the Committee on Space Research's (COSPAR's) current planetary protection policy for the Moon, no sterilization procedures are required for outbound lunar spacecraft, nor is there a different planetary protection category for human missions, although preliminary C SPAR policy guidelines for human missions to Mars have been developed. Future in situ investigations of a variety of locations on the Moon by highly sensitive instruments designed to search for biologically derived organic compounds would help assess the contamination of the Moon by lunar spacecraft. These studies could also provide valuable \"ground truth\" data for Mars sample return missions and help define planetary protection requirements for future Mars bound spacecraft carrying life detection experiments. In addition, studies of the impact of terrestrial contamination of the lunar surface by the Apollo astronauts could provide valuable data to help refine future: Mars surface exploration plans for a human mission to Mars.\n\nHuman Non-linguistic Vocal Repertoire: Call Types and Their Meaning.\n\nPubMed\n\nAnikin, Andrey; BÃ¥Ã¥th, Rasmus; Persson, Tomas\n\n2018-01-01\n\nRecent research on human nonverbal vocalizations has led to considerable progress in our understanding of vocal communication of emotion. However, in contrast to studies of animal vocalizations, this research has focused mainly on the emotional interpretation of such signals. The repertoire of human nonverbal vocalizations as acoustic types, and the mapping between acoustic and emotional categories, thus remain underexplored. In a cross-linguistic naming task (Experiment 1), verbal categorization of 132 authentic (non-acted) human vocalizations by English-, Swedish- and Russian-speaking participants revealed the same major acoustic types: laugh, cry, scream, moan, and possibly roar and sigh. The association between call type and perceived emotion was systematic but non-redundant: listeners associated every call type with a limited, but in some cases relatively wide, range of emotions. The speed and consistency of naming the call type predicted the speed and consistency of inferring the caller's emotion, suggesting that acoustic and emotional categorizations are closely related. However, participants preferred to name the call type before naming the emotion. Furthermore, nonverbal categorization of the same stimuli in a triad classification task (Experiment 2) was more compatible with classification by call type than by emotion, indicating the former's greater perceptual salience. These results suggest that acoustic categorization may precede attribution of emotion, highlighting the need to distinguish between the overt form of nonverbal signals and their interpretation by the perceiver. Both within- and between-call acoustic variation can then be modeled explicitly, bringing research on human nonverbal vocalizations more in line with the work on animal communication.\n\nMorphology of AGN in the Central Kiloparsec\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMartini, Paul\n\nHubble Space Telescope observations of the central kiloparsec of AGN have revealed a wealth of structure, particularly nuclear bars and spirals, that are distinct from analogous features in the disks of spiral galaxies. WFPC2 and NICMOS images of a large sample of AGN observed at high spatial resolution make it possible to quantify the frequency and detailed properties of these structures. Nearly all AGN have nuclear spiral dust lanes in the central kiloparsec, while only a small minority contain nuclear bars. If these nuclear dust spirals trace shocks in the circumnuclear, gaseous disks, they may dissipate sufficient angular momentum to fuel the active nucleus. I would like to thank my collaborators in this project---Rick Pogge, John Mulchaey, and Mike Regan---for allowing me to present this work in advance of publication, as well as Johan Knapen for organizing such an interesting meeting. Support for this work was provided by NASA through grant numbers GO-7867 and GO-8597 from the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.\n\nFrederik Kaiser (1808-1872) and the Modernisation of Dutch Astronomy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nvan der Heijden, Petra\n\nFrederik Kaiser was the director of Leiden Observatory from 1837 until his death in 1872. Educated by his German-born uncle Johan Frederik Keyser (1766-1823), who was a proficient amateur astronomer, Kaiser proved to be a real observational talent. Despite the poor conditions in which he worked, his observations soon rivalled with the best in the world. Kaiser's contributions to astronomical practice include the foundation of a new, completely up-to-date observatory building in Leiden, and the introduction of statistics and precision measurements in daily practice at "
