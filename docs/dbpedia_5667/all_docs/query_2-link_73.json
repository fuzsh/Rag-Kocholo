Our first task is to see beyond what Dave Monahan and Richard Barsam have called “cinematic invisibility.” Watch a film at least twice so that you can reverse engineer some of its key scenes.",

        "text": "King Lear, dir. Richard Eyre 2018\n\n1:05:00 Edmund puts his hand on Regan’s derrière. It’s one of the first signs that Regan is having an extramarital affair (husband seems oblivious at this point).\n\n1:35:00 Gloucester dies in an empty house during bombardment with Edgar by his side. Gloucester touches Edgar’s face, hinting at his recognition of his son. Edgar interrupts his father’s second suicidal thought (the first was at the Dover cliff) by saying “Men must endure their going hence, even as their coming hither: Ripeness is all.”\n\n“Ripeness” has special religious significance in this context. A point for further reflection.\n\nWhat is the setting? Where is the scene taking place? What do props and costumes tell us about the time period, about the characters and their social standings? What do these directorial choices reflect the director’s interpretation of the scene?\n\nHow does pacing change the meanings of the story? Does the film’s action drag on at any point? How and why? How does the speed or lack of speed affect your interpretation of the film?\n\nWhat does the actor do with their voice? Do they use accents?\n\nIn terms of blocking (director’s planned movement for the characters on set), where do the actors stand (in relation to each other) in significant scenes? Does the camera focus your attention on one character more than on another by special blocking?\n\nHow often are there cuts and transitions? How long does the director stay with shots? When are there close ups, long shots? To what effect? How are emotions conveyed (cued by the soundtrack, by camera work)?\n\nHow is music used (sparingly, excessively as a guide to audiences, counterintuitively against the visual cues)? Are there scenes without nondiegetic soundtracks? What is the significance of silence?\n\nWhat is the effect of each of these aspects on the scene being depicted? How does each director establish a tone for the film? To what genre does this film belong: action, thriller, historical chronicle, philosophical drama? What are the themes or leitmotifs of the film adaptations? Ambition, love, revenge, misogyny, friendship, betrayal?\n\nDoes the film remain open-ended or insists on a specific interpretation of the story?\n\nFilm analysis is distinct from film review."
