        "text": "Broadway veteran Ken Page was just 24 when he was cast in the off-Broadway production of “Ain’t Misbehavin’: The Fats Waller Musical Show,” which took Manhattan by storm, quickly transitioned to Broadway and won the 1978 Tony Award for Best Musical.\n\nPage won the Drama Desk Award for his performance as the Fats Waller-like character in the cabaret-style show, and he would reprise the role in a 1988 Broadway revival. Today, the St. Louis-based actor-singer is still performing onstage, in concerts, in films and as a voice-over artist, as well as working as a stage director — the role that brought him to Escondido this month.\n\nPage is directing CCAE Theatricals’ production of “Ain’t Misbehavin’,” which opens Saturday at the California Center for the Arts, Escondido. The musical revue, conceived by Richard Maltby Jr. and Murray Horowitz, celebrates the music of Thomas “Fats” Waller, a pioneering jazz composer and pianist whose rise to fame and fortune in the 1920s and ’30s helped give birth to the Harlem Renaissance. Waller composed more than 400 songs during his too-brief career — he died from pneumonia at age 39 in 1943 — including “Ain’t Misbehavin’ ” and “Honeysuckle Rose,” which were both inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nThis is the fifth time Page has had the opportunity to direct “Ain’t Misbehavin’,” and he said that as the years pass, he sees a growing need to better educate the audience about Waller and his music. For the Escondido production, Page will be using projections that feature pictures of Waller and Harlem as well as historical photos that put some songs into better context, such as two songs Waller wrote about the deprivations of World War II: “When the Nylons Bloom Again” and “Cash for Your Trash.”\n\nAnother feature Page insisted on for the Escondido production was adding 10 cabaret tables below the front lip of the stage. That re-creates the intimate atmosphere of the show’s earliest beginnings at a 60-seat music club.\n\n“I hope to broaden a sense of history of the show,” Page said. “The audience doesn’t always realize it’s celebrating this amazing composer’s music. It’s always important to me to bring him forward.”\n\nPage broke through with “Ain’t Misbehavin’,” but he’s much better known for a role that came along four years later: Old Deuteronomy in the original Broadway cast of “Cats,” which he preserved for posterity in the musical’s 1998 film adaptation. Page said he’s still approached regularly by “Cats” fans who talk about how they grew up watching him in the “Cats” movie on DVDs and VHS tapes.\n\nBut the role that has unexpectedly brought Page universal fame is serving as the voice of the villainous Oogie Boogie, a walking, talking sack of bugs in Disney’s animated 1993 film “Tim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christmas.” Page said it was just another voice gig when he was hired for the role, and the film opened to only moderate business.\n\n“Then it went away and there was this underground rumble I was made aware of, and suddenly there’s this cult following. My agents and I call it the gift that keeps on giving,” he said.\n\nIn the years since, Page has given voice to Oogie Boogie in the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland and Disney World theme parks, in video games, and in live concerts with symphony orchestras around the world, including in Japan, Scotland, Ireland, London and at the Hollywood Bowl. His character is also the centerpiece of the now-running Ooogie Boogie Bash, a trick-or-treat event held each fall at Disneyland.\n\nIn an industry where many performers never get their big break, Page said he’s grateful to have had several breakthroughs in multiple areas of the entertainment industry over the years.\n\n“I’ve learned to live with the idea that I have all these separate followings. There’s people who know me from Broadway and people who only know me for ‘Christmas.’ They don’t overlap as much as I’d like them, too, but if you’re lucky enough to have three or four areas where you’re well known, that’s a lot to be thankful for.”\n\n‘Ain’t Misbehavin’: The Fats Waller Musical Show’\n\nWhen: Previews 7:30 p.m. Friday and 2 p.m. Saturday. Opens at 8 p.m. Saturday and runs through Oct. 8.
