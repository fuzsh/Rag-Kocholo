        "text": "Free Will Pessimism - this lecture was presented to the Vitterhetsakademien/Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities (Stockholm) in May 2016. It is now published in the Vitterhetsakademien Yearbook 2017. It is a condensed version of my \"Free Will Pessimism\" paper.\n\nMy contribution to an incredible book celebrating the incomparable Bjørnar Olsen on his 65th birthday, this chapter tells a story of our friendship, conversations, and collaborations from Palo Alto to Finnmark. For Love of Archaeology is edited by Hein B. Bjerck, Mats Burström, Þora Pétursdóttir, and Asgeir Svestad.\n\nDuring the past two decades Scandinavian archaeologists have increasingly participated in projects abroad. Only a few of the projects are based on past cultural-historical links, while the majority are based on comparative and collaborative perspectives, often on other continents. The reason for this development is partly the theoretical development within the discipline, and partly also changes in funding policies. This new situation presents Scandinavian rcsearchers with many practical, ethical and political challenges, but if we take them seriously we may often be rewarded."
