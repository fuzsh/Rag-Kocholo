        "text": "Marvel and DC Comics are some of the most coveted intellectual property of the current entertainment landscape. Over the last few decades, countless actors have brought the beloved characters to life on screens big and small.Â\n\nItâs not exactly uncommon for an actor to toggle between universes, either. Christian Bale has played DCâs Batman and Marvelâs Gorr the God Butcher; Ryan Reynolds was DCâs Green Lantern before he became Marvelâs Deadpool. As Screen Rant has proven, the list is dozens long, at least.\n\nHere are 30 performers who have pulled double-duty for Marvel and DC, from Angela Bassett to Sylvester Stallone.\n\n1. Angela Bassett\n\nBefore Angela Bassett became part of the MCU playing TâChallaâs mother, Ramonda, in Black Panther (2018), she appeared as Dr. Amanda Waller in DCâs Green Lantern (2011).\n\n2. Ben AffleckÂ\n\nAffleck has played Batman in a handful of movies from the DCEU, including 2017âs Justice League and 2016âs Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Back in 2003, he was the titular character in Marvelâs Daredevil.Â\n\n3. Colin Farrell\n\nColin Farrell also appeared in 2003âs Daredevil as the assassin Bullseye. On the DC side, he brought the Penguin (a.k.a. Oswald Cobblepot) to life in 2022âs The Batman.\n\n4. ZoÃ« Kravitz\n\nZoÃ« Kravitzâs portrayal of Catwoman in 2022âs The Batman landed her in the DC universe (though she had already voiced the character in 2017âs The Lego Batman Movie). Over in Marvel land, she played the mutant Tempest (a.k.a Angel Salvadore) in 2011âs X-Men: First Class and gave voice to Mary Jane in the 2018 animated flick Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.\n\n5. Halle Berry\n\nKravitz isnât the only Catwoman with a foot in the Marvel universe. Halle Berry, who played the character in 2004âs Catwoman, was also Storm in a number of X-Men movies.\n\n6. Michelle Pfeiffer\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer, whose whip-wielding Catwoman can be seen in 1992âs Batman Returns, is also Janet van Dyneâformerly the Wasp, an identity that now belongs to her daughter, Hopeâin the MCUâs Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018).\n\n7. Michael Keaton\n\nMichael Keaton was Tim Burtonâs Bruce Wayne in 1989âs Batman and its 1992 sequel (not to mention the recently buried Batgirl). Heâs also Marvelâs Vulture, the primary antagonist in Spider-Man: Homecoming (2019).\n\n8. Chris Evans\n\nItâs thanks to 2010âs The Losers, based on a DC-owned Vertigo comic book series of the same name, that a few A-listers made this list. Chris Evans is one of them: He played hacker Jake Jensen. In addition to being the MCUâs Captain America, he was also Johnny Storm in the non-MCU 2005 film Fantastic Four and its 2007 sequel.\n\n9. Idris Elba\n\nIdris Elba starred in The Losers, too, as Captain William Roque, and as the assassin Bloodsport in DC's The Suicide Squad. His main Marvel role is Heimdall from 2011âs Thor and other MCU offerings; he also played Moreau, a character invented for 2011âs Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance.\n\n10. Zoe SaldaÃ±a\n\nPerhaps best known for her portrayal of Gamora in 2014âs Guardians of the Galaxy and other MCU movies, SaldaÃ±a also appeared as the enigmatic Aisha al-Fadhil in The Losers.\n\n11. Natalie Portman\n\nNatalie Portmanâs Jane Foster features heavily in the MCUâs Thor films (save for 2017âs Thor: Ragnarok). Sheâs technically played a DC character, too, as 2005âs V for Vendettaâin which she starred as Evey Hammondâis based on a DC Comics property from the 1980s.\n\n12. Hugo Weaving\n\nWeaving is in a similar boat: He portrayed V in V for Vendetta and Red Skull in Captain America: The First Avenger.\n\n13. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje\n\nAdewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje appeared in 2016âs Suicide Squad as Killer Croc; his Marvel credit comes from 2013âs Thor: The Dark World, in which he played the Dark Elf Malekithâs henchman Algrim.\n\n14. Kelly Hu\n\nKelly Hu had a recurring role as the DC character China White in the CW series Arrow, and she also played the Marvel villain Lady Deathstrike in the 2003 X-Men sequel X2: X-Men United.\n\n15. Zachary Levi\n\nZachary Levi had a short-lived run as the Asgardian warrior Fandral in Marvelâs Thor: The Dark World and Thor: Ragnarok. Heâs also the star of DCâs Shazam! (2019) and its upcoming sequel.\n\n16. Laurence Fishburne\n\nLaurence Fishburne has two Marvel credits on his rÃ©sumÃ©: Bill Foster in Ant-Man and the Wasp, and the Silver Surfer (in voice only) in Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. In the DCEU, heâs Perry White of The Daily Planet, first seen in 2013âs Man of Steel.\n\n17. Dolph Lundgren\n\nDolph Lundgren is a DC star twice overâfirst as Russian crime boss Konstantin Kovar in season 5 of Arrow, and currently as King Nereus in the DCEUâs Aquaman movies. He was also Frank Castle (a.k.a. The Punisher) in 1989âs The Punisher.\n\n18. Barry Keoghan\n\nIrish actor Barry Keoghan fleetingly showed up as the Joker in 2022âs The Batman and played Druig in the MCUâs Eternals the year before.\n\n19. Tilda Swinton\n\nTilda Swinton is best known to MCU fans as the Ancient One in 2016âs Doctor Strange (and Avengers: Endgame, briefly). She also played the Archangel Gabriel in the 2005 Keanu Reeves-starring movie Constantine, based on DCâs Hellblazer comics.\n\n20. Rachel Weisz\n\nRachel Weisz also starred in Constantine as twins Angela and Isabel. Her Marvel credit comes from 2021âs Black Widow: She played Black Widow Melina Vostokoff, Natasha and Yelenaâs (sort of) adoptive mother.\n\n21. David Harbour\n\nNatasha and Yelenaâs adoptive fatherâthe Red Guardianâwas portrayed by Stranger Things star David Harbour, who also appeared as government agent Dexter Tolliver in DCâs Suicide Squad (2016). Harbour's biggest comic book movie role, however, is as Hellboy in Neil Marshall's 2019 remake, which is a different publisher altogether: Dark Horse Comics.Â\n\n22. Taika Waititi\n\nTaika Waititi pulled double duty in Thor: Ragnarok and Thor: Love and Thunder, both directing the films and voicing the Kronan Korg. In DCâs 2006 film Green Lantern, heâs aerospace engineer Thomas Kalmaku.\n\n23. Morena Baccarin\n\nIn addition to playing Vanessa in 2016âs Deadpool and its 2018 sequelâboth based on Marvel propertiesâMorena Baccarin was Dr. Leslie Thompkins in the Fox TV series Gotham.\n\n24. Josh Brolin\n\nJosh Brolinâs Thanos is the biggest bad in the MCU thus far, but itâs not the only time weâve seen Brolin in a Marvel movie: He was Cable in 2018âs Deadpool 2. He also starred as the DC antihero Jonah Hex in the 2010 film of the same name.\n\n25. Randall Park\n\nIn 2018, Randall Park played both Dr. Stephen Shin in DCâs Aquaman and FBI agent Jimmy Woo in Marvelâs Ant-Man and the Waspâa character he later reprised in WandaVision.\n\n26. Florence Kasumba\n\nFlorence Kasumba has been an elite warrior in both the DCEU, where she played Acantha of the Amazon in 2017âs Wonder Woman, and the MCU, as Ayo of Wakanda's Dora Milaje in 2018âs Black Panther and beyond.\n\n27. Adam Beach\n\nAdam Beach briefly portrayed Slipknot in DCâs Suicide Squad (2016) and William Lonestar, father of Mirage, in Marvelâs The New Mutants (2020).\n\n28. Djimon Hounsou\n\nDjimon Hounsou has an impressive three DC roles to his name: Constantineâs Midnite, Aquamanâs King Ricou, and Shazam!âs Wizard. He also appeared as Korath in the MCUâs Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain Marvel.\n\n29. Tao Okamoto\n\nFor Marvel, model Tao Okamoto played Mariko Yashida inÂ 2013âs The Wolverine. For DC, she was Mercy Graves in 2016âs Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.\n\n30. Sylvester Stallone\n\nSylvester Stallone voiced King Shark in 2021âs The Suicide Squad for DC and joined the MCU as Stakar Ogord in 2017âs Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2."
