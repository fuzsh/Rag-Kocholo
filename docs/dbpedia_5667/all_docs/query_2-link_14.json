He has also provided the voice of Jon Arbuckle in The Garfield Show.\n\nDavid Bateson has played Agent 47 in the Hitman series from its inception, and is now lending his voice to fellow bald maniac Lex Luthor - though this time, Lex is far more interested in saving the world than corrupting it for himself.\n\nRick Pasqualone played Vito Scaletta in Mafia 2, 3 and The Definitive Edition, as well as Vinnie in The Darkness 2. In the prior Rocksteady game Batman: Arkham Knight, Pasqualone provided additional voices for many smaller characters.\n\nListen to our One More Life podcast and subscribe to our gaming newsletter for all the latest intel.\n\nLooking for something to watch?
