        "text": "Open Studio S01\n\nIntroduction\n\n2021-01-30\n\nOpen studio is a podcast series produced by Rupert, a creative space for art, residencies and alternative education in Vilnius, Lithuania. The podcast seeks to present to the broader public, the vibrant interdisciplinary creative life taking place at Rupert. The series introduces the local and international community of artists, curators, thinkers and creators who in varying ways participate in Rupert’s intellectual ecosystem. It engages them in short, stimulating conversations about their creative processes, artistic ideas, experiences at Rupert and beyond. Each episode includes an <“author’s mark”>, a splash of sound, visual or textual creativity, prepared exclusively for <Open Studio>, by the guests Themselves.\n\nE01 Anastasia Sosunova\n\n2021-01-30\n\nThe first episode of the podcast introduces Anastasia Sosunova, a Lithuanian artist and a member of Rupert Alumni board. Anastasia combines installation, sculpture, graphic art and drawing to explore topics of identity, cultural heritage and symbols. She draws from her personal experience as a member of a Russian ethnic minority to interrogate the conditions under which national, historical and personal narratives are established, experienced and challenged. The episode explores numerous topics, including her previous and current creative work, the purposes and possibilities of baking a sculpture and the spatial biopolitics of walking a dog.\n\nProduction\n\nGuest: Anastasia Sosunova\n\nConvener: Arvydas Grišinas\n\nSound: Antanas Dombrovskij\n\nThe Author’s Mark\n\nSoundtrack: Andrej Romanov\n\nPicture: Anastasia sosunova\n\nArt: www.anastasiasosunova.com\n\n4:35 Demikhov Dog\n\n8:02 Habitaball\n\nE02 Vitalij Strigunkov\n\n2020-02–13\n\nVitalij Strigunkov is a conceptual artist from Lithuania with a truly international profile who manipulates video, audio material, objects, space, situations and representations to explore a variety of topics, from the notion of copyrights and authorship to statehood, to time constructs and beyond. Originally trained as a painter, his canvass is now the cultural fabric, at which an art piece exists and gains value. In his exploration of what he calls the cultural capital, Vitalij challenges our daily market value rituals through submitting them to deconstruction through repetition, ruthless poetization and piercing observation.\n\nProduction\n\nGuest: Vitalij Strigunkov\n\nConvener: Arvydas Grišinas\n\nSound: Antanas Dombrovskij\n\nThe Author’s Mark\n\nSoundtrack: Vitalij Strigunkov\n\nArt:\n\n1:05 A Year, a Few Months and Some More\n\n6:00 Waiting\n\n11:30 News from elsewhere\n\n13:00 Substitution\n\n16:30 As If I Couldn’t See\n\nPodbean:\n\nSpotify:\n\nE03 Inside Job\n\n2021-02-27\n\nInside Job is an art collective by Ula Lucińska and Michał Knychaus from Poznan, Poland. In acts of dark “artistic sci-fi”, they transform spaces into post-humanist scenarios, transcending time, space and media. They create installations that recite spatial storylines, which the viewer can mix, match and discover. In doing so, they also polemicize with a variety of thinkers, authors and ideas, from eco-fiction to cultural and technological critique, to classics in horror fiction. Their work is atmospheric and consists of elements of graphics, sculpture textile, sound and other media, all of which serves to create a “portal” to another possible reality, where humans are gone or had just left, and the world is ruled by nature, machine and a mixture thereof.\n\nProduction\n\nGuest: Inside Job\n\nConvener: Arvydas Grišinas\n\nSound: Antanas Dombrovskij\n\nThe Author’s Mark\n\nSoundtrack: Inside Job, One Drop at a Time (2020)\n\nArt: http://ulalucinska.com/index.php/2020/the-dull-flame-of-desire/\n\nPodbean:\n\nSpotify:\n\nThe residency of the Inside Job duo is financially supported by the Adam Mickiewicz Institute, Poland.\n\nE04 Augustas Serapinas\n\n2021-03-13\n\nRupert Open Studio introduces Augstas Serapinas, a successful and internationally recognized Lithuanian artist who in 2019 became the youngest participant of the Venice Biennale. His work explores space and architecture, seeking hidden “pockets” in design, where he contributes through his ironic yet sensitive artwork. By creating installations, curating space and ready-mades, he opens questions of human interaction with the surroundings, finitude of cultural norms and conceptions, and the aesthetics of natural decomposition. The discussion evolves from spatiality and temporality of his work, to cultural recycling, to the human subject, and how building snowmen can help resolve questions of public commemoration.\n\nProduction\n\nGuest: Augustas Serapinas\n\nConvener: Arvydas Grišinas\n\nSound: Antanas Dombrovskij\n\nThe Auhthor’s Mark\n\nSountrack: John Rocca – I Want it to be Real (Farley’s Hot House Piano Mix)\n\nArt:\n\n2:33 How to Live Together\n\n5:10 Don’t You Know Who I Am?\n\n8:08 20 Appartments\n\n10:25 February 13th\n\n13:00 Vienkiemis\n\n15:37 Jõusaal (Gym)\n\nPodbean:\n\nSpotify:\n\nE05 Sean-Roy Parker\n\n2021-03-27\n\nIn this episode, Rupert’s artist-in-residence Sean-Roy Parker talks about his artistic practice, his approach to the social as an artistic strategy, why he initiates knowledge-based and skill-sharing activities and how he exercises alternative currencies.\n\nSean-Roy Parker (United Kingdom) is an artist, environmentalist and community cook based in London. His work builds social frameworks inclusive of marginalised voices and alternative currencies like labour exchange to encourage practical, post-capitalist action using abundance and care. During his residency, Sean undertook ‘Slow Yield’, a research project about the lifecycle of materials, complexities of civic responsibility and tackling waste culture through collaborative problem-solving. Alongside scavenger walks, eco-sculpture and fermentation experiments, he was working on new text and sound work in the surrounding terrain. Sean-Roy Parker was an artist-in-residence at Rupert in August 2020.\n\nProduction\n\nGuest: Sean-Roy Parker\n\nConvener: Kotryna Markevičiūtė\n\nSound: Antanas Dombrovskij\n\nThe Auhthor’s Mark\n\nSountrack: Sean-Roy Parker making sauerkraut\n\nAbout Sean: seanroyparker.com/\n\nPodbean:\n\nSpotify:\n\nE06 Sophie Hoyle\n\n2021-04-10\n\nIn this episode, Rupert’s former resident, Sophie Hoyle, speaks to Yates Norton about their work on mental health, anxiety and trauma and how these topics are talked and thought about in Lithuania and other contexts. Sophie Hoyle opened Rupert’s 2020 public programmes on care and interdependence with a screening at Editorial. At 20:45, Sophie speaks about alternative DIY sexual healthcare services; an example of this is Gynepunk collective (who offer workshops on using open-source gynaecological kits e.g. open-source microscope, a 3D printed speculum and a centrifuge).\n\n*This episode was recorded in the beginning of 2020.

His somewhat minimalist artistic expression is backed by a substantial body of thought, critique and storytelling. He draws equally from critical theory and classical literature, maneuvering between the ancient materialist philosophy, post-humanist critique and medieval scholasticism. Erudition becomes his artistic tool to debate collectivity, lived space, intellectual heritage and modernity, among many other crucial topics. Yet behind every project also lies a personal story, an alter ego, who adds a personal and even somewhat emotional quality to the author’s intellectual explorations.\n\nProduction\n\nGuest: Vytenis Burokas\n\nConvener: Arvydas Grišinas\n\nSound: Antanas Dombrovskij\n\nThe Auhthor’s Mark\n\nSountrack: Vytenis Burokas – Horseshoe\n\nArt:\n\nartviewer.org/vytenis-burokas-at-editorial/\n\nartviewer.org/the-sea-monster-the-bear-at-litost/\n\nwww.cac.lt/lt/exhibitions/past/19/9582\n\nfourtoseven.info/en/year-2017-entry/\n\nandeditions.org/lt/product/vytenis-burokas-2/\n\nPodbean:\n\nSpotify:\n\nE08 Anna Reutinger\n\n2021-05-14\n\nRupert’s resident, Anna Reutinger, offers insight into her sculpture/installation/performance practice — from the craft practices of her family to a study of neolithic, medieval and contemporary ornamentation of vernacular objects and a series of interviews with makers and historians in Lithuania and beyond. For this podcast episode, the artist suggests craft as an apotropaic force, in which the body, environment and material are given special attention and time. Her stay concluded with a solo-exhibition titled Stuck in the same muck at project space Editorial in Vilnius.\n\nProduction\n\nGuest: Anna Reutinger\n\nConvener: Romuald Demidenko\n\nSound: Antanas Dombrovskij\n\nThe Author’s Mark\n\nSoundtrack: We all gonna die, but it’s time to sing a song\n\n(www.weallgonnadiebut.com), in collaboration with Maria Thrän\n\nwww.annareutinger.com\n\nWatch Palacon in collaboration with Elise Ehry and Daría Galabriel at CAPC, BordeauxStuck in the same muck at Editorial, Vilnius\n\nPodbean:\n\nSpotify:\n\nE09 Howard Melnyczuk\n\n2021-05-29\n\nHoward Melnyczuk explores the relations between digital culture and power by seeking means of using the former to confront the latter. His conceptual artistic explorations problematize casual uses of technology, inquiring into the different ways we naturalize the impact that it has on our sense of privacy, world-views and identities. In doing so, he seeks “loopholes” in the neo-liberal digital environment, where the same technologies might be used for creating awareness and resistance against the underlying power structures. Howard’s means of artistic expression vary from photography to installation, to code, and present a critical re-appraisal of the new reality we are all subjected to.\n\nProduction\n\nGuest: Howard Melnyczuk\n\nConvener: Arvydas Grišinas\n\nSound: Antanas Dombrovskij\n\nThe Author’s Mark\n\nSoundtrack: Howard Melnyczuk, Cone of Power (2021)\n\nArt: https://www.melnycz.uk/\n\nPodbean:\n\nSpotify:\n\nE10 Alice Bucknell\n\n2021-06-12\n\nIn this episode, Alice Bucknell unfolds some of the notions and ideas recurring in her art and writing practice. The artist has disembarked from a background in visual anthropology towards storytelling and worldbuilding through her own practice and collaborations with other artists. Her recent projects draw connections between architecture, science fiction, non-human intelligence, magic, and hyper-ecology — all of which can be recognised in her newest video Swamp City, recently released in the Venice Architecture Biennale. Here, she elaborates on her methodology as artist and writer, and shares some details of her upcoming collaborative platform New Mystics, which was developed during her stay in Vilnius.\n\nProduction\n\nGuest: Alice Bucknell\n\nConvener: Romuald Demidenko\n\nSound: Antanas Dombrovskij\n\nThe Author’s Mark\n\nSoundtrack: Alice Bucknell, Swamp City, 2021, “The Tree” / “The Architect” (SOPHIE tribute), both tracks are conceived by Ken Yama in collaboration with the artist.\n\nThe recent work by Alice can be viewed on her website. And her new video Swamp City can be watched through The Russian Federation Pavilion website.\n\nPodbean:\n\nSpotify:\n\nE11 Katja Aufleger\n\n2021-07-10\n\nKatja Aufleger is a Berlin-based sculptor whose artwork functions as a metaphor or an analogy for talking about a variety of diverse yet interlinked topics, from personal relations to cosmic bodies, social critique and potentiality of a disaster. At the core of her artistic work lies a question of power relations, which function both as a creative and destructive force. Before all, Aufleger’s objects and installations work as a provocation for a viewer. Observing her masterfully-crafted artworks is a double-edged experience, as a beautiful form either directly or indirectly references a series of alternative potentialities, be it a possibility of explosion, chemical reaction, a visual experience of sound or other. This way her works become a multi-layered experience where the viewer’s consciousness and subconsciousness participate in the creative process.\n\nProduction\n\nGuest: Katja Augleger\n\nConvener: Arvydas Grišinas\n\nSound: Antanas Dombrovskij\n\nThe Author’s Mark\n\nSoundtrack: Katja Aufleger\n\nArt: http://www.katjaaufleger.com\n\nPodbean:\n\nSpotify:\n\nE12 Julijonas Urbonas\n\n2021-07-24\n\nOn this Open Studio episode, we are talking to Julijonas Urbonas, the founder of the Lithuanian Space Agency, which currently presents its project Planet of People at the 17th International Architecture Exhibition of La Biennale di Venezia.\n\nJulijonas is an artist, designer, researcher, engineer, lecturer. He is the former Pro-Rector of arts at Vilnius Academy of Arts and the CEO of an amusement park in Klaipeda. For more than a decade, he has been working between critical design, amusement park engineering, performative architecture, choreography, kinetic art and sci-fi and has been developing various critical tools for negotiating gravity: from a killer roller coaster to an artificial planet made entirely of human bodies.

In this episode, Judith shares her recent experience of isolation and moving between different places, and how these have influenced her work with different genres of music and sound. As a result of her long-term studies into sound, different music notions and theories, she has been engaging in some experimental and collaborative projects. These have resulted in such compositions for cello and electronics as Days Collapse and Shaking Studies.\n\nProduction\n\nGuest: Judith Hamann\n\nConvener: Romuald Demidenko\n\nSound: Antanas Dombrovskij\n\nThe Author’s Mark\n\nSoundtrack: Judith Hamann, Hinterhof, 2021 / Humming Suite III – Harmonics Étude For One Cello And One Voice, 2020\n\nMore about Judith Hamann’s work on their website.\n\nPodbean:\n\nSpotify:\n\nE16 Miriam Naeh\n\n2021-10-21\n\nMiriam Naeh is a London-based multi-disciplinary artist whose work is deeply influenced by human practice of storytelling. In her installations-as-narratives, she combines Middle Eastern mythology, post-humanist thought, humor, and personal experiences. This mixture produces de-centralized experiences, where the viewer is invited to participate in a quasi-mythological story, at the same time creating it and giving it particular meaning. Miriam combines a variety of media in her work and is particularly interested in the binaries of the real versus fictional, natural versus artificial. She invites the viewer to explore this ambiguous world where grotesque meets fragility and laughter meets ‘the sad sublime’.\n\nProduction\n\nGuest: Miriam Naeh\n\nConvener: Arvydas Grišinas\n\nSound: Antanas Dombrovskij\n\nThe Author’s Mark\n\nSoundtrack: Soundtrack from Hot.Stone.Massage, Miriam Naeh in collaboration with Yifeat Ziv\n\nMore about Miriam\n\nPodbean:\n\nSpotify:\n\nE18 Francesca Grilli\n\n2021-12-22\n\nFrancesca Grilli is a Brussels-based Italian artist whose main practice is performance art; however, she also works with sculpture, film, audio and other media, as well as esoteric practices. The scope of her artistic research is quite broad but the core of her work is focused on different facets of the human condition: age, fragility, family ties, power relations, among others. In her multiple poetic and intimate artworks, she seeks to provoke honest, thoughtful and almost cathartic public reactions through presenting the viewers and participants with profound experiences. These include being put in a dark room together with trained birds of prey or being presented with two pianists of stark age contrast, one of whom is a hundred years old and the other, a child. The power and purity of childhood is also at the centre of her latest work, Sparks (2021), in which she invites the audience for a palm reading session with children as oracles.\n\nFrancesca Grilli’s project Sparks is presented by Contemporary Locus and supported by the Italian Culture Council.\n\nProduction\n\nGuest: Francesca Grilli\n\nConvener: Arvydas Grišinas\n\nSound: Antanas Dombrovskij\n\nThe Author’s Mark\n\nSoundtrack: Personal recording (2021), Francesca Grilli\n\nArtist’s website\n\nPodbean:\n\nSpotify:"
