You may remember them from appearances across film, TV, and other games.\n\nCameron Monaghan plays Cal Kestis\n\nWe’ll start with Cameron Monaghan, who voices and portrays the main player character Cal Kestis. Of course, anyone who has played Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order will recognise the actor from that, but he’s perhaps most well known for his 20 episodes in the Batman prequel series Gotham (Jerome Valeska/Jeremiah Valeska) and from the US version of Shameless, in which he played Ian Gallagher for 127 episodes.\n\nDebra Wilson plays Cere Junda\n\nDebra Wilson, who voices and portrays Cere Junda in the game, is another returnee from the original. You may recognise her from Forspoken, in which she also provides her voice and likeness as Bellette Krau and as the voice of Mayor Stevenson in Need for Speed Unbound. She’s also voiced Amanda Waller in Batman: The Enemy Within and the upcoming Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.\n\nDaniel Roebuck plays Greez Dritus\n\nDaniel Roebuck, the voice and mocap talent of Greez Dritus, is another returning cast member from Fallen Order. With over 240 IMDb credits to his name, you’re bound to have seen or heard him in something. He's done 10 episodes as Arnold Walker in the TV series The Man in the High Castle, 55 episodes of Matlock, and played Biggs in The Fugitive and its sequel US Marshals.\n\nTina Ivlev plays Nightsister Merrin\n\nThe last of the returning Mantis crew is Tina Ivlev, who plays and voices Nightsister Merrin in Survivor and Fallen Order. She also appeared in the US version of Shameless in which she played Freelania Alexeyevich for three episodes. Other credits for Ivlev include Mayor of Kingstown, MacGyver, and The Young and the Restless.\n\nCody Fern plays Dagan Gera\n\nRounding out the cast is Cody Fern, who acts and voices Dagan Gera. You may recognise him from his 21 episodes as Michael Langdon/Xavier Plympton/Valiant Thor in the anthology series American Horror Story. Fern also appeared in House of Cards and The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story.\n\nRichard Horvitz plays Torgal\n\nNext is Richard Horvitz who plays Torgal in the game, who is most well known for voicing Zim in Invader Zim, Billy in The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, and the voice of Alpha 5 in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\n\nNoshir Dalal plays Bode Akuna\n\nNoshir Dalal, who voices and plays Bode Akuna, has appeared in the likes of Red Dead Redemption 2 and Star Wars: The Bad Batch (15 episodes).\n\nTracy Ifeachor plays Santari Khiri\n\nTracy Ifeachor, the voice and acting talent of Santari Khri here, has appeared in Quantico (11 episodes as Lydia Bates) and DC’s Legends of Tomorrow.\n\nTommie Earl Jenkins plays Gulu\n\nTommie Earl Jenkins, who voices Gulu in the game, played Mayor Noble Walker in Netflix’s Wednesday.\n\nDC Douglas plays Rayvis\n\nDC Douglas, the voice and actor of Rayvis, has appeared in a bunch of different animes, including Welcome to Demon-School, Iruma-kun.\n\nElisabeth Frances plays Mosey Cimarron\n\nElizabeth Frances, who voices Mosey Cimarron in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, appeared as Prairie Flower in 20 episodes of The Son.\n\nKendal Rae plays Zee\n\nLast but not least is Kendal Rae, who voices and acts Zee in the game. She’s perhaps most well known in Australia for her 457 episodes of the soap opera The Shak, in which she plays Picasso.\n\nTwo fun inclusions in the 'unnamed roles' section are Sam Witwer (who played Starkiller in The Force Unleashed games) and Yuri Lowenthal (who plays Spider-Man in the recent PS4 games). We've no idea who they played, but it's nice to have them involved!\n\nSubscribe to our free Gaming Newsletter for weekly insights, and visit our Gaming hub for all the latest news.\n\nLooking for something to watch?
