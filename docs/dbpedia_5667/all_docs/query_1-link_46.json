To assess health related quality of life among patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The Diabetes Quality of Life (DQOL) questionnaire was applied to 296 patients with diabetes mellitus aged 63 Â± lO years (201 women) seen in primary health care centers. The concern about the future effects of diabetes was the worst evaluated domain. Women perceived a lower health related quality of life than men. There was an inverse correlation between age and satisfaction with treatment, concern about vocational, social and future effects of the disease. Type 2 diabetes affects health related quality of life, especially in some specific domains such as perception of the future.\n\nDiabetes-related quality of life is enhanced by glycaemic improvement in older people.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbbatecola, A M; Spazzafumo, L; Fabbietti, P; Testa, R; Rabini, R A; Bonfigli, A R; Corsonello, A; Lattanzio, F; Paolisso, G\n\n2015-02-01\n\nTo investigate the validity and reliability of the Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life instrument in older Italians with diabetes and to test the association of diabetes-related quality of life with glycaemic control over time. A total of 558 outpatients with Type 2 diabetes from the Diabetic Unit of the Italian National Research Centre on Aging Hospital in Ancona were enrolled to complete questionnaires (Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life-19 and the Short-Form-12), and to undergo clinical and biochemical testing at baseline and at 12 months of follow-up. The overall impact of diabetes using the average weighted impact score from the Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life questionnaire was calculated. Participants were categorized according to this score as having either less or more negative diabetes-related quality of life. Participants had a mean Â± SD age of 67.7 Â± 9.2 years and 51.8% were male. Factor analysis and Cronbach's coefficient of internal consistency (Cronbach's Î± = 0.931) confirmed that the 19 domain-specific Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life items could be combined into a single scale in this Italian population. The impact score correlated with the physical (r = 0.275; P < 0.001) and mental components (r = 0.291; P < 0.001) of the Short-Form-12 questionnaire. Significant differences were found according to diabetic complications in specific Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life items and impact scores. Insulin use had a greater association with a more negative quality of life compared with other antidiabetic agents. A multivariate linear regression model with restricted linear spline application showed that the relationship between HbA1c and impact score was not linear and that the change in the impact score was associated with improved glycaemic control in those with a less negative diabetes-related quality of life at 12 months. The Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life-19 is a valid tool for measuring\n\nResponsive parenting is associated with improved type 1 diabetes-related quality of life\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBotello-Harbaum, Maria; Nansel, Tonja; Haynie, Denise; Iannotti, Ronald J.; Simons-Morton, Bruce\n\n2008-01-01\n\nBackground Improved quality of life is an important treatment goal for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. While previous research supports a relationship between family environment and quality of life, little research has addressed the relationship of parenting style constructs to quality of life in children with chronic disease. The present investigation assesses the relationship of parent responsiveness and demandingness with diabetes-related quality of life among children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Methods Baseline and 12-month follow-up self-report assessments were collected on a sample of 81 children with type 1 diabetes participating in an efficacy trial of a behavioral intervention to enhance adherence. The sample had a mean age of 13.3 years (SD = 1.7) and duration of diabetes of 7.7 years (SD = 3.7). Multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship of parent responsiveness and demandingness to diabetes-related quality of life at each time point. Results After adjusting for demographic and diabetes characteristics, as well as diabetes-specific parent-child behaviors, parent responsiveness was significantly associated with baseline diabetes-related quality of life (B=.23; p=.04). This relationship was sustained at 12-month follow-up (B=.22; p=.04) after adjusting for baseline quality of life and treatment group assignment, suggesting that parent responsiveness is associated with improved quality of life. Conclusions Findings indicate the importance of a supportive and emotionally warm parenting style in promoting improved quality of life for children with type 1 diabetes. Appropriate parenting skills should be an element of diabetes family management health care.

A total of 235 of 319 invited adults (18-69years) with Type 1 diabetes agreed to participate. Hierarchical linear regression was applied to 188 individuals with complete data. Mediation analysis was used to determine whether diabetes-related quality of life mediated the relationship between fear of hypoglycaemia and psychological well-being. Fear of hypoglycaemia was significantly associated with diabetes-related quality of life and psychological well-being. The behaviour and worry components of fear of hypoglycaemia were significantly associated with diabetes-related quality of life (behaviour component: unstandardised coefficient=-0.04, p<0.001, standardised coefficient=-0.40; worry component: unstandardised coefficient=-0.01, p=0.041, standardised coefficient=-0.18). Fear of hypoglycaemia worry had a significant independent association with psychological well-being (unstandardised coefficient=-0.28, p=0.009, standardised coefficient=-0.25), whereas fear of hypoglycaemia behaviour did not. Diabetes-related quality of life mediated approximately half of the association between fear of hypoglycaemia worry and psychological well-being. Hypoglycaemic episodes can have serious consequences, and assessing fear of hypoglycaemia might help health care providers offer suitable care strategies to individuals with Type 1 diabetes.

Open-ended interviews yielded six HRQOL themes: health, overall well-being, harmonious relationships and family responsibilities, a rewarding life, spiritual life, and material support. The physical impact of diabetes included decreased energy, limitations, and physical suffering; while its psychological/spiritual impact extended to general stress, helplessness, fear, depression, anger, and relationship with God. Like Americans, Koreans valued health, psychological well-being and interpersonal support. In addition, the Koreans valued smooth, harmonious interpersonal relationships, overall well-being pertaining to living a comfortable and honorable life.\n\nA cross-cultural study on perceived health-related quality of life in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus.\n\nPubMed\n\nKalyva, Efrosini; Abdul-Rasoul, Majedah; Kehl, DÃ¡niel; Barkai, LÃ¡szlÃ³; LukÃ¡cs, Andrea\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThis study investigated whether culture can affect self- and proxy-reports of perceived diabetes-specific health-related quality of life of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes when taking into account glycemic control, gender and age. A total of 416 patients aged between 8 and 18 years--84 (Greece), 135 (Hungary) and 197 (Kuwait)--and their parents completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 3.0. Diabetes Module. Gender and age did not have any effect on perceived diabetes-specific health-related quality of life. Significant differences were detected among countries in self- and proxy-reports of diabetes-specific health-related quality of life when controlling for glycemic control. More specifically, Greek patients with type 1 diabetes and their parents reported significantly worse disease-specific health-related quality of life than their peers from Kuwait and Hungary. Moreover, culture affected the level of agreement between self- and proxy-reports with parents from Kuwait underestimating their children's diabetes-specific health-related quality of life. The impact of culture on self- and proxy-reports of diabetes-specific health-related quality of life warrants further investigation, since it might suggest the need for differential psychosocial treatment.

Parents of young children who attend school/daycare must rely on others for daily type 1 diabetes management. Worry about school/daycare type 1 diabetes management may cause parental distress and contribute to diminished parent quality of life. Parental concerns about type 1 diabetes management in young children in the school/daycare setting have not been well described in the literature. Descriptive correlational and cross-sectional parent report of questionnaires design. As part of a randomised controlled trial for parents of young children with type 1 diabetes, 134 parents completed self-report measures at baseline. Data included demographic, school/daycare, and medical information, parent reports of child school/daycare functioning, parent fear of hypoglycaemia and parent type 1 diabetes-related quality of life. Parents of younger children, children on a more intensive medical regimen and children who had experienced type 1 diabetes-related unconsciousness or seizures had more school/daycare concerns. Parents who perceived their children had higher school/daycare functioning had less fear about hypoglycaemia and reported better type 1 diabetes-related quality of life. School/daycare functioning and fear of hypoglycaemia were significantly associated with parent type 1 diabetes-related quality of life. Parents' concerns about school/daycare functioning and fear of hypoglycaemia play an important role in parents' type 1 diabetes-related quality of life. Members of the healthcare team should be aware of concerns related to children attending school/daycare and provide additional support as warranted.

A cross-sectional study assessing the association between quality of care and quality of life using multiple linear regression analysis. Family medicine clinics (FMC) (n = 39) of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) in Mexico City. Type 2 diabetes patients (n = 312), older than 19 years. Health-related quality of life was measured using the MOS Short-Form-12 (SF-12); quality of healthcare was measured as the percentage of recommended care received under each of four domains: early detection of diabetes complications, non-pharmacological treatment, pharmacological treatment and health outcomes. The average quality of life score was 41.4 points on the physical component and 47.9 points on the mental component. Assessment of the quality of care revealed deficiencies. The average percentages of recommended care received were 21.9 for health outcomes and 56.6 for early detection of diabetes complications and pharmacological treatment; for every 10 percent additional points on the pharmacological treatment component, quality of life improved by 0.4 points on the physical component (coefficient 0.04, 95% confidence intervals 0.01-0.07). There was a positive association between the quality of pharmacological care and the physical component of quality of life. The quality of healthcare for type 2 diabetes patients in FMC of the IMSS in Mexico City is not optimal.\n\nQuality of Life in Adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes Who Participate in Diabetes Camp\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCheung, Ruth; Cureton, Virginia Young; Canham, Daryl L.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nQuality of life in adolescents with Type 1 diabetes is a growing area of interest in pediatric research.

(2) Examine the relationship between the sensory deficits and patients' health-related quality of life. This study included 115 participants aged 33-55 with uncontrolled (nâ=â22) or controlled (nâ=â24) glycemic levels together with healthy subjects (nâ=â69). All participants completed the brief World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire, the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile and performed the tactile discrimination test. Sensory deficits were more emphasized among patients with uncontrolled glycemic levels as expressed in difficulties to register sensory input, lower sensation seeking in daily environments and difficulties to discriminate between tactile stimuli. They also reported the lowest physical and social quality of life as compared to the other two groups. Better sensory seeking and registration predicted better quality of life. Disease control and duration contributed to these predictions. Difficulties in processing sensory information from their daily environments are particularly prevalent among patients with uncontrolled glycemic levels, and significantly impacted their quality of life. Clinicians should screen for sensory processing difficulties among patients with diabetes mellitus and understand their impacts on patients' quality of life. Implications for Rehabilitation Patients with diabetes mellitus, and particularly those with uncontrolled glycemic levels, may have difficulties in processing sensory information from daily environment. A multidisciplinary intervention approach is recommended: clinicians should screen for sensory processing deficits among patients with diabetes mellitus and understand their impacts on patients' daily life.

For this reason, this study aims to evaluate and compare the health-related quality of life of patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity in Gaziantep, a south-eastern city in Turkey. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity are the most decisive factors in terms of adversely affecting health-related quality of life. A cross-sectional, descriptive design was used. In this study, the research population included a total of 1601 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity patients. To evaluate health-related quality of life of patients, Short Form-36 (SF-36) was used. Student's t-test, one-way anova and chi-square analyses were used for comparisons between groups. In total, 18Â·1% of patients had combined obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus; 16Â·1% had hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Approximately 16Â·1% had only hypertension; 15Â·4% had obesity and hypertension; 13Â·3% had diabetes mellitus; 12Â·7% had obesity and diabetes mellitus; and 8Â·4% had obesity. The health-related quality of life physical component mean scores of patients with combined obesity and hypertension were lower than that of the other groups (p < 0Â·05). Health-related quality of life physical component mean scores were determined as 34Â·5 (SD 0Â·4), and mental component mean scores were determined as 43Â·9 (SD 4Â·4). Health-related quality of life physical component mean scores of moderately active patients were higher, while older age and lower educational and income levels had a negative effect on health-related quality of life (p < 0Â·05). Diabetes, hypertension and obesity decrease patient health-related quality of life while physical activity increases it. The coexistence of obesity and hypertension, in particular, has a more negative effect on health-related quality of life.

Both diseases and their treatments can seriously impair quality of life. The objective of the present study was to investigate health-related quality of life in adult patients diagnosed with both Type 1 diabetes and coeliac disease and compare this with healthy control subjects and control subjects who have Type 1 diabetes only. A generic measure of health-related quality of life (RAND-36) and a measure of diabetes-specific quality of life (DQOL) questionnaires were sent to patients diagnosed with both Type 1 diabetes and coeliac disease. The control group consisted of patients with Type 1 diabetes without coeliac disease matched for age, gender and socio-economic status. Generic quality of life scores were compared with data from healthy Dutch control subjects. Fifty-seven patients with Type 1 diabetes and coeliac disease were included and no associations between clinical characteristics and quality of life were observed. Women reported a lower quality of life in social functioning, vitality and mental health than men (all P < 0.05). A lower diabetes-specific quality of life was observed regarding diabetes-related worries and social worries in patients with Type 1 diabetes and coeliac disease compared with patients with Type 1 diabetes. Compared with healthy control subjects, quality of life in patients with Type 1 diabetes and coeliac disease was significantly lower, particularly social functioning (Cohen's d = 0.76) and general health perception (Cohen's d = 0.86). The additional diagnosis of coeliac disease and treatment by gluten-free diet in adult patients with Type 1 diabetes has a considerable, negative impact on quality of life and diabetes-specific quality of life. Women are particularly affected and social functioning and general health perception is compromised. Â© 2013 The Authors.

This study aimed to assess the interactive effects of poor sleep quality and depression on the quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes (nâ=â944) completed the Diabetes Specificity Quality of Life scale (DSQL) and questionnaires on sleep quality and depression. The products of poor sleep quality and depression were added to the logistic regression model to evaluate their multiplicative interactions, which were expressed as the relative excess risk of interaction (RERI), the attributable proportion (AP) of interaction, and the synergy index (S). Poor sleep quality and depressive symptoms both increased DSQL scores. The co-presence of poor sleep quality and depressive symptoms significantly reduced DSQL scores by a factor of 3.96 on biological interaction measures. The relative excess risk of interaction was 1.08. The combined effect of poor sleep quality and depressive symptoms was observed only in women. Patients with both depressive symptoms and poor sleep quality are at an increased risk of reduction in diabetes-related quality of life, and this risk is particularly high for women due to the interaction effect. Clinicians should screen for and treat sleep difficulties and depressive symptoms in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nDiabetes Self-Management: A Key for Better Health-related Quality of Life in Patients with Diabetes.\n\nPubMed\n\nBadr, Hanan E; Al-Khaledi, Maha; Al-Dousari, Hussah; Al-Dhufairi, Shaikhah; Al-Mousawi, Taiba; Al-Azemi, Rehab; Al-Azimi, Farah\n\n2018-04-17\n\nThis study was aimed at assessing health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among adult patients with diabetes attending primary health care diabetes clinics in Kuwait and to examine the factors associated with patients with the HRQOL of patients with diabetes. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 503 patients with diabetes attending 26 primary healthcare diabetes clinics in Kuwait. A self-administered questionnaire on participants' socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, in addition to the Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire (DSMQ) to assess patients' DSM was used. SF12 was employed to assess the HRQOL, producing two outcomes: Physical health composite and Mental health composite. The mean age of participants was 52. Â± 0.8 years, 53.1% were males, and 49.0% were Kuwaitis. The median DSM sum score was 6.5. Male patients with diabetes showed significantly better median DSM sum score than female patients with diabetes. The overall median score of HRQOL was 61.7/100 with a better median score of PHC than MHC of quality of life (66.7/100 and 56.7/100, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed a significant direct association between DSM and better primary health composite and mental health composite. It also showed that female gender, and reporting two or more diabetic complications were significantly associated with poor PHC. Kuwaiti patients with diabetes showed a modest level of HRQOL. Patients' DSM, gender, and diabetes complications were significant independent correlates to HRQOL. Appraisal of patients with diabetes' HRQOL as an essential component of diabetes management in clinical settings is suggested. Further studies to examine the impact of good diabetes self-management on HRQOL improvement are needed.\n\n. Â©2018The Author(s). Published by S.

This study was conducted in two phases. First phase was Development of HRQLQDFU which included literature search and expert interview. Second phase was validation of HRQLQDFL which included face validation, content validation and construct validation. Face validation was done by ten diabetic foot ulcer patients, ten practicing nurses and ten care givers. They were asked to read and respond to questionnaire and report any difficulty in understanding the questions. Further they were asked to add any item to the questionnaire which according to them has a significant effect on quality of life. Content validation was done by six subject experts who judged the content relevance of questionnaire with score ranging from zero to four; zero being least relevant and four being most relevant. Content validity index was calculated for each question. Questions having content validity indexâ¥0.8 were selected for the study. Reliability was tested by calculating Cronbach's alpha. In the development phase a questionnaire containing 37 questions with six domains was developed. None of patient had difficulty in understanding questions. After content validation a new questionnaire containing 20 questions was developed. Cronbach's alpha was 0.86 which shows good reliability. The new health related quality of life questionnaire on diabetic foot ulcer patients for an Indian scenario is validated and can be a reliably measure for quality of life in diabetic foot ulcer patients.

In 1990s, high rates of psychiatric disorders were reported among children with T1DM. Little is known, however, about current prevalence of psychiatric disorders in children with T1DM and the relation between psychiatric diagnosis and HRQoL. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision) psychiatric disorders and the association between psychiatric comorbidity and HRQoL in the pediatric population with T1DM. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 207 children, aged 8-18 years, diagnosed with T1DM. The presence of psychiatric disorders has been assessed by the standard diagnostic interview according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision) criteria. HRQoL was measured by the general and diabetes mellitus-specific modules of the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory. Of the evaluated patients, 26.6% (N = 55) met the criteria for psychiatric disorders at the time of evaluation. The most common diagnoses were anxiety (N = 32; 15.5%) and mood disorders (N = 8; 3.9%). One-third of the patients (N = 66, 31.9%) met the criteria for at least 1 psychiatric diagnosis in their lifetime. The presence of psychiatric disorders was related to an elevated hemoglobin A1c level (8.6% vs 7.6%) and a lowered HRQoL level in the general pediatric quality of life inventory. In the diabetes mellitus-specific pediatric quality of life inventory, children with psychiatric disorders revealed more symptoms of diabetes mellitus, treatment barriers, and lower adherence than children without psychiatric disorders. T1DM in children is associated with a very high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity, which is related to elevated hemoglobin A1c and lower HRQoL levels.

A total of 254 diabetic patients were studied in a cross-sectional setting. HRQoL was evaluated using Thai version of the Euro Quality of Life Questionnaire (EuroQoL), with five dimensions and five-level scale (EQ-5D-5L). Utility scores were calculated using time trade-off methods. A total of 141 patients in the DF group (98 DFU and 43 AMPU groups), 82 in the COM group (27 DR, 28 ESRD, and 27 CAD groups), and 31 in the CON group were interviewed. The mean age was 63.2Â±12.1 years, body mass index was 24.9Â±4.7 kg/m 2 , mean hemoglobin A1c was 7.7Â±2.1%, duration of diabetes was 13.1Â±9.9 years, and the mean utility scores were 0.799Â±0.25. After having DF, 21% of patients had lost their jobs. The COM group had lower utility scores than the CON group. Among the diabetic complications, the DF group had the lowest mean utility scores as compared to the COM and CON groups (0.703Â±0.28 in the DF group, 0.903Â±0.15 in the COM group, and 0.961Â±0.06 in the CON group, P <0.01). There was no difference in the mean utility scores between DFU and AMPU groups. Patients in the DF group reported moderate-to-severe problem in all dimensions more than the other groups. DF have the greatest negative impact on HRQoL. Therefore, diabetic foot care should be emphasized in clinical practice to prevent foot complications.\n\nDiabetes-Specific Quality of Life of Korean Children and Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes.\n\nPubMed\n\nBoo, Sunjoo; Ahn, Youngmee; Lee, Ji Eun; Kang, Narae; Kang, Heesook; Sohn, Min\n\n2016-02-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the quality of life of children in Korea with type 1 diabetes and related factors. Children were recruited from a diabetes camp. Data were collected using four instruments: the PedsQLâ¢ 3.2 Diabetes Module, Self-Efficacy for Diabetes Self-Management, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children, and the Diabetes Management Behavior Scale. Children who were older (t = 2.197, p = .041), male (t = -3.579, p = .002), and less depressed (t = -2.859, p = .010) were more likely to have better quality of life. Further research is needed in children with type 1 diabetes in countries where this disease is rare, and governmental support and public awareness are limited.

Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of several patient characteristics on health-related quality of life of multimorbid patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a community setting. A cross-sectional study with 32 primary care practice teams in Mannheim, Germany, and randomly selected multimorbid patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (N = 495) was conducted. In order to analyze associations of various patient characteristics with health-related quality of life (EQ-5D index) a multilevel analysis was applied. After excluding patients with missing data, the cohort consisted of 404 eligible patients. The final multilevel model highlighted six out of 14 explanatory patient variables which were significantly associated with health-related quality of life: female gender (r = -0.0494; p = .0261), school education of nine years or less (r = -0.0609; p = .0006), (physical) mobility restrictions (r = -0.1074; p = .0003), presence of chronic pain (r = -0.0916; p = .0004), diabetes-related distress (r = -0.0133; p < .0001), and BMI (r = -0.0047; p = .0045). The findings of this study suggest that increased diabetes-related distress, chronic pain, restrictions in (physical) mobility, female gender, as well as lower education and, increased BMI have a noteworthy impact on health-related quality of life in multimorbid patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus seen in primary care practices in a community setting. The highlighted aspects should gain much more attention when treating multimorbid patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nQuality of life in patients with diabetic foot ulcer in Visegrad countries.\n\nPubMed\n\nNemcovÃ¡, Jana; HlinkovÃ¡, Edita; FarskÃ½, Ivan; Å½iakovÃ¡, KatarÃ­na; JaroÅ¡ovÃ¡, Darja; ZelenÃ­kovÃ¡, RenÃ¡ta; BuÅ¾govÃ¡, Radka; JanÃ­kovÃ¡, Eva; Zdzieblo, Kazimiera; Wiraszka, Grazyna; Stepien, Renata; Nowak-Starz, Grazyna; Csernus, Mariann; Balogh, Zoltan\n\n2017-05-01\n\nTo identify the quality of life of patients with diabetic foot ulcers in the Visegrad countries. The diabetics with foot ulcers are principally evaluated on the basis of physical parameters, but this does not always reveal much about the patient's experience of life with ulceration. The cross-sectional study. The standardised generic questionnaire World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF was used. The sample was made up of 525 participants and the calculations were performed using the IBM spss statistical program. The significant negative correlations between demographic data such as age, duration of diabetes mellitus, duration of diabetic ulceration treatment and a lower level of quality of life were found across the sample. The statistically significant differences according to clinical characteristics such as Wagner classification, frequency of foot ulcers, present peripheral vascular disease and pain in terms of quality of life were also revealed. Significant differences of quality of life among Visegrad countries were revealed: Hungary's participants had a worse quality of life than others, while Slovak participants expressed lower satisfaction with their health than Czech. Socio-demographic factors and clinical characteristics influence the quality of life of patients with diabetic foot ulcer. Significant differences between patients of Visegrad countries were found in all domains of quality of life: physical, psychological, social and environmental. The quality of life of patients with diabetic foot ulcer reflects the conditions and healthcare system in each of the Visegrad countries. We have to respect socio-demographic factors and clinical characteristics in nursing care. This could have an impact on managing patient care not only with regard to their diabetic foot ulcer but also with regard to the patient as a personality with their own problems in relation to physical, psychosocial and environmental conditions.

Patients and methods A total of 254 diabetic patients were studied in a cross-sectional setting. HRQoL was evaluated using Thai version of the Euro Quality of Life Questionnaire (EuroQoL), with five dimensions and five-level scale (EQ-5D-5L). Utility scores were calculated using time trade-off methods. Results A total of 141 patients in the DF group (98 DFU and 43 AMPU groups), 82 in the COM group (27 DR, 28 ESRD, and 27 CAD groups), and 31 in the CON group were interviewed. The mean age was 63.2Â±12.1 years, body mass index was 24.9Â±4.7 kg/m2, mean hemoglobin A1c was 7.7Â±2.1%, duration of diabetes was 13.1Â±9.9 years, and the mean utility scores were 0.799Â±0.25. After having DF, 21% of patients had lost their jobs. The COM group had lower utility scores than the CON group. Among the diabetic complications, the DF group had the lowest mean utility scores as compared to the COM and CON groups (0.703Â±0.28 in the DF group, 0.903Â±0.15 in the COM group, and 0.961Â±0.06 in the CON group, P<0.01). There was no difference in the mean utility scores between DFU and AMPU groups. Patients in the DF group reported moderate-to-severe problem in all dimensions more than the other groups. Conclusion DF have the greatest negative impact on HRQoL. Therefore, diabetic foot care should be emphasized in clinical practice to prevent foot complications.

The study is a secondary analysis of baseline data from a clinical trial that examined treatment of obstructive sleep apnea on physical activity and glucose control. Instruments included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Medical Outcomes Short-Form Physical Component and Mental Component Scores, and Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire. Higher physical HRQoL was significantly associated with better sleep quality and improved functional outcomes of increased activity and productivity. Higher mental HRQoL was associated with improved sleep quality and improved functional outcomes of increased activity, social interactions, vigilance, and productivity. Poor sleep quality was a predictor of decreased functional outcomes while controlling for age, race, education, BMI, marital status and physical and mental HRQoL. Poor sleep quality is associated with negative physical, mental, and functional outcomes in adults with type 2 diabetes. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Data were collected at graduation and 1 year later. Analyses controlling for selected covariates were completed using generalized linear mixed models. Better diabetes management was associated with more positive responses on all four dimensions of DQOL. Impact and worry of DQOL were greater in the presence of depressive symptoms, and life satisfaction was lower. DQOL life satisfaction was lower in those living independently of parents. Young women reported poorer diabetes-related health status than did young men. Time since graduation was not linked to DQOL. Further research is needed on ways to improve DQOL in conjunction with diabetes management and on ways that families can support DQOL when youth live independently.

The sample included 910 participants with type 1 and 241 participants with type 2, ages 10-22 years at baseline, from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study, a longitudinal observational study. The primary outcome measure was the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. Repeated measures, mixed-model regression analysis was conducted with the use of data from baseline and at least one follow-up assessment, spanning approximately 4 years. HRQL was greater among those with type 1 versus type 2 diabetes. Among participants with type 1, greater (better) Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory total scores over time were related to greater parent education (P = .0007), lower glycated hemoglobin values (P < .0001), and greater physical activity during the past 7 days (PÂ = .0001). There was a significant interaction between sex and age (P < .0001); girls' HRQL remained stable or decreased over time, whereas males' HRQL increased. For participants with type 2 diabetes, there was no significant interaction by age and sex, but lower total HRQL was related to being female (P = .011) and greater body mass index z-scores (P = .014). HRQL in this cohort varied by diabetes type. The interaction between sex and age for type 1 participants, coupled with poorer HRQL among female than male participants with type 2 diabetes, suggests the impacts of diabetes on HRQL differ by sex and should be considered in clinical management. Encouraging physical activity and weight control continue to be important in improving HRQL. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Four-hundred-forty-nine patients, 153 women, with type 2 Diabetes and no or mild diabetic retinopathy were enrolled in a 2-year multicenter randomized controlled trial. The 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire was used to explore 12 subscales of vision related quality of life. The patients were 62.8âÂ±â6.7 years old and had 11.1âÂ±â5.6 years known disease duration. Diabetic retinopathy was absent in 193 (43.0â%) and mild in 256 (57.0â%). Patients without diabetic retinopathy were older, had shorter diabetes duration and used less insulin and glucose-lowering agents but did not differ by gender, best corrected visual acuity or any subscale, except vision specific mental health and vision specific role difficulties. Patients with reduced retinal thickness at the ganglion cell layer (nâ=â36) did not differ for diabetic retinopathy but were older, had lower best corrected visual acuity and worse scores for ocular pain, color vision and peripheral vision. On multivariable analysis, worse scores for general vision remained associated with reduced retinal thickness, diabetes duration and best corrected visual acuity, and scores for visual specific mental health with diabetic retinopathy and lower best corrected visual acuity. Visual specific role difficulties were only associated with reduced best corrected visual acuity. Scores for driving decreased among females, with worsening of Hemoglobin A1c and best corrected visual acuity. Color vision depended only on reduced retinal thickness, and peripheral vision on both reduced thickness and best corrected visual acuity.

Cross-sectional data from 190 people with type 2 diabetes of Native Hawaiian (50%), Filipino (16%), Japanese (18%), and mixed-ethnic (16%) ancestries from the rural community of North KÅhala, Hawai'i were examined in this study. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale. Health-related quality of life was measured with the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). Eight health-related quality of life constructs were examined: Physical Functioning, Role-Physical Functioning, Role-Emotional Functioning, Social Functioning, Bodily Pain, Vitality, General Health, and Health Transition. Hierarchical regression analyses of the interaction between ethnicity and the SF-36 subscales of Physical Functioning, Role-Emotional Functioning, Bodily Pain, Vitality, and General Health indicated statistically significant associations with CES-D scores after controlling for sociodemographic factors, glycemic status, and social support. Ethnicity moderated the relationship between depressive symptoms and the health-related quality of life aspects of physical and role-emotional functioning, bodily pain, vitality, and general health perception in people with type 2 diabetes. This relationship was strongest for Filipinos followed by Native Hawaiians and people of mixed-ethnic ancestries.\n\nAudit diabetes-dependent quality of life questionnaire: usefulness in diabetes self-management education in the Slovak population.\n\nPubMed\n\nHolmanovÃ¡, Elena; ZiakovÃ¡, KatarÃ­na\n\n2009-05-01\n\nThis paper reports a study to test validity and internal consistency of the audit diabetes-dependent quality of life questionnaire in the Slovak population and to evaluate its usefulness in the context of education of people with diabetes.

Survey. After linguistic validation, the structure of the questionnaire was tested using factor analysis on 104 patients who were recruited from the National Institute of Endocrinology and Diabetology in Lubochna. Internal consistency was evaluated by computing Cronbach's alpha. Clinical variables related to the quality of life were analysed using one-way ANOVA, multifactor ANOVA, Pearson's and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. A one-dimensional scale structure was supported and internal consistency was high (alpha = 0.93). Variance in impact of diabetes on quality of life was explained by age, presence of late complications and type of insulin regimen. The audit diabetes-dependent quality of life is culturally appropriate, valid and reliable in the sample of Slovak patients attending the educational programme. Our results agreed with previous European and Asian studies supporting its usefulness in the context of diabetes self-management education. Individualised diabetes-specific quality of life measures allow better understanding of patients' treatment preferences and, consequently, more effective prioritizing and targeting of appropriate educational interventions. This instrument may be useful in routine clinical practice and as an outcome measure for international clinical research trials evaluating effectiveness of educational programmes.\n\nFactors related to quality of life for patients with type 2 diabetes with or without depressive symptoms - results from a community-based study in China.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Yu; Maier, Manfred; Hao, Yufang; Chen, Yan; Qin, Yuelan; Huo, Ran\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTo explore the factors related to quality of life for patients with type 2 diabetes with or without depressive symptoms in China. In patients with type 2 diabetes with or without depressive symptoms, different factors such as gender, social context or regional setting may affect their quality of life. This was a cross-sectional study. Of 791 registered patients with type 2 diabetes from four communities in Beijing, cluster sampling was used to recruit patients for participation. Self-rating depression scale was used to screen for depressive symptoms; demographic and clinical data were collected, and quality of life and social support were assessed using appropriate tools. The factors associated with quality of life were tested using multivariate linear regression. The prevalence of depressive symptoms in 667 patients with diabetes was 44Â·2%. Quality of life of patients with depressive symptoms was worse than that of patients without depressive symptoms, and this was associated negatively with history of diabetic complications, usage of hypoglycaemic agents or insulin and self-rating depression scale scores and positively with salary and subjective social support. The factors related to quality of life for patients with or without depressive symptoms are different. For patients with depressive symptoms, better salary and subjective social support are associated positively with their quality of life, while the presence of diabetic complications, a higher score for depressive symptoms and need for hypoglycaemic agents or insulin are negatively associated with quality of life. It is suggested that the nurse should screen depression for patients with diabetes, especially for those with diabetic complications or low social support. This should be done in the community regularly in order to find diabetic patients with depression in time. In addition, the results can provide a reference to clinical nursing care for patients with diabetes in hospitals.

Therefore, as part of an ongoing process of outcome assessment, we analysed levels of satisfaction of care among patients and parents in our diabetes clinic and its relationship to short-term metabolic control outcome, diabetes knowledge and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). In 2004, parents and their children aged 5-18 years attending the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) diabetes clinic completed questionnaires reporting their satisfaction with care provided, HRQOL and diabetes knowledge. Concurrent HbA(1c) levels were also recorded. The reporting profile was 83 patients, 24 fathers and 110 mothers. Generally, both patients and parents were satisfied with diabetes care provided at our tertiary centre. Satisfaction of care was not associated with the clinical outcome of metabolic control (measured by HbA(1c) levels), diabetes knowledge or HRQOL measures. Most patients and their parents in the RCH diabetes clinic appear generally satisfied with their diabetes care. The degree of satisfaction of care cannot be presumed according to clinical outcome, diabetes knowledge or HRQOL measures.\n\n[Emotional distress and quality of life in people with diabetes and their families].\n\nPubMed\n\nBelÃ©ndez VÃ¡zquez, Marina; Lorente ArmendÃ¡riz, IÃ±aki; Maderuelo Labrador, Mercedes\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe daily experience of living with diabetes can adversely affect the quality of life of people with diabetes and their families.

Body image concerns, particularly among women, are therefore common. The study evaluated associations between the appearance investment component of body image, age, quality of life and self-reported metabolic control were examined, along with the practice of insulin restriction as a weight control strategy. A questionnaire comprising demographic and diabetes-related information, the Appearance Schemas Inventory, and Diabetes Quality of Life Brief Clinical Inventory was completed by Australian women diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (Nâ=â177). Self-evaluative salience was higher among younger participants, those with a lower quality of life, and those with better metabolic control of their diabetes, with the relationships between metabolic control and all of age, quality of life, and self-evaluative salience noted to be non-linear. Among participants who reported restricting insulin for weight control, self-evaluative salience was particularly relevant. Motivational salience was not related to other study variables. Clinically, the provision of information regarding appearance changes that might arise in order to mitigate later body image difficulties is a potentially beneficial adjunct to standard diabetes management protocols that may lead to more successful disease adjustment.\n\nHealth-related quality of life and self-related health in patients with type 2 diabetes: effects of group-based rehabilitation versus individual counselling.\n\nPubMed\n\nVadstrup, Eva S; FrÃ¸lich, Anne; Perrild, Hans; Borg, Eva; RÃ¸der, Michael\n\n2011-12-07\n\nType 2 diabetes can seriously affect patients' health-related quality of life and their self-rated health. Most often, evaluation of diabetes interventions assess effects on glycemic control with little consideration of quality of life. The aim of the current study was to study the effectiveness of group-based rehabilitation versus individual counselling on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and self-rated health in type 2 diabetes patients. We randomised 143 type 2 diabetes patients to either a six-month multidisciplinary group-based rehabilitation programme including patient education, supervised exercise and a cooking-course or a six-month individual counselling programme. HRQOL was measured by Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-item Health Survey (SF-36) and self-rated health was measured by Diabetes Symptom Checklist - Revised (DCS-R). In both groups, the lowest estimated mean scores of the SF36 questionnaire at baseline were \"vitality\" and \"general health\". There were no significant differences in the change of any item between the two groups after the six-month intervention period. However, vitality-score increased 5.2 points (p = 0.12) within the rehabilitation group and 5.6 points (p = 0.03) points among individual counselling participants.In both groups, the highest estimated mean scores of the DSC-R questionnaire at baseline were \"Fatigue\" and \"Hyperglycaemia\". Hyperglycaemic and hypoglycaemic distress decreased significantly after individual counselling than after group-based rehabilitation (difference -0.3 points, p = 0.04). No between-group differences occurred for any other items. However, fatigue distress decreased 0.40 points within the rehabilitation group (p = 0.01) and 0.34 points within the individual counselling group (p < 0.01). In the rehabilitation group cardiovascular distress decreased 0.25 points (p = 0.01).

Our aim was to evaluate the association between unhealthy lifestyle habits and HRQoL in adolescents and young adults with T1DM. Two hundred and forty-two Caucasian patients (13-19Â years) consecutively enrolled over a 12-month period in three Regional Pediatric Diabetes Centers in Italy. Demographics, clinical, and laboratory parameters, adherence to lifestyle habits (Mediterranean Diet assessed by KIDMED, Physical Activity levels and sedentary behavior by questionnaire) considered either separately or in cluster, and HRQoL by Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Diabetes Module (PedsQL 3.0 DM) were collected. Metabolic control was determined by HbA1c mean of previous year. Only 15 (6.2%) patients fulfilled the cluster of three healthy lifestyle habits without gender differences (pÂ =Â 0.353); 62 (25.6%) had 1 unhealthy lifestyle habit, and 165 (68.2%) hadÂ â¥2. Adolescents meeting physical activity recommendations had better PedsQL scores than those who did not meet. PedsQL total score and specific sub-scales decreased in patients with unhealthy lifestyle habits. High PedsQL was significantly associated with being male, living in South Italy, having lower HbA1c mean levels, and reporting lower adherence to unhealthy lifestyle habits. The clustering of unhealthy lifestyle habits is associated with reduced HRQoL in adolescents and young adults with T1DM. Promoting multiple behavior changes may be a useful approach to improve the health status and the HRQoL in youths with T1DM.\n\nUnhealthy Days and Quality of Life in Irish Patients with Diabetes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nClifford, Emma Louise; Collins, Margaret M.; Buckley, Claire M.; Fitzgerald, Anthony P.; Perry, Ivan J.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nObjectives To study the determinants of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in Irish patients with diabetes using the Centres for Disease Controls' (CDC's) âUnhealthy Daysâ summary measure and to assesses the agreement between this generic HRQoL measure and the disease-specific Audit of Diabetes Dependant Quality of Life (ADDQoL) measure. Research Design and Methods Data were analysed from the Diabetes Quality of Life Study, a cross-sectional study of 1,456 people with diabetes in Ireland (71% response rate). Unhealthy days were assessed using the CDC's âUnhealthy daysâ summary measure. Quality of life (QoL) was also assessed using the ADDQoL measure. Analyses were conducted primarily using logistic regression. The agreement between the two QoL instruments was measured using the kappa co-efficient. Results Participants reported a median of 2 unhealthy days per month. In multivariate analyses, female gender (Pâ=â0.001), insulin use (Pâ=â0.030), diabetes complications (Pâ=â<0.001) were significantly associated with more unhealthy days. Older patients had fewer unhealthy days per month (Pâ=â0.003). Agreement between the two measures of QoL (unhealthy days measure and ADDQoL) was poor, Kappaâ=â0.234 Conclusions The findings highlight the determinants of HRQoL in patients with diabetes using a generic HRQoL summary measure. The âUnhealthy Daysâ and the ADDQoL have poor agreement, therefore the âUnhealthy Daysâ summary measure may be assessing a different construct. Nonetheless, this study demonstrates that the generic âUnhealthy Daysâ summary measure can be used to detect determinants of HRQoL in patients with diabetes.

The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of complications and comorbidities on diabetes-specific quality of life in a large population-based cohort of type 2 diabetic patients. Methods The Living with Diabetes Study recruited participants from the National Diabetes Services Scheme in Australia. Data were collected via a mailed self-report questionnaire. Diabetes-specific quality of life was measured using the Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life (ADDQoL) questionnaire. The analyses are for 3609 patients with type 2 diabetes. Regression models with adjustment for control variables investigated the association of complications and comorbidities with diabetes-specific quality of life. Next, the most parsimonious model for diabetes-specific quality of life after controlling for important covariates was examined. Results The expected associations with better diabetes-specific quality of life were evident, such as increased income, not on insulin, better glycaemic control and older age. However, being single and having been diagnosed with cancer were also associated with better ADDQoL. Additionally, poorer diabetes-specific quality of life was strongly sensitive to the presence of diabetes complications and mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. These relationships persisted after adjustment for gender, age, duration of diabetes, treatment regimen, sampling region and other treatment and socio-demographic variables. Conclusions A greater appreciation of the complexities of diabetes-specific quality of life can help tailor disease management and self-care messages given to patients. Attention to mental health issues may be as important as focusing on glycaemic control and complications. Therefore\n\nRelative effect of socio-economic status on the health-related quality of life in type 2 diabetic patients in Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nHosseini Nejhad, Zahra; Molavi Vardanjani, Hossein; Abolhasani, Farid; Hadipour, Maryam; Sheikhzadeh, Khodadad\n\n2013-01-01\n\nType II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressing epidemic and a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The quality of life (QoL) of diabetic patients has been strongly influenced by socioeconomic status (SES) in developed countries. Therefore, the QoL improvement is considered to be a major goal in diabetes control program. In this context, there is no reliable evidence for developing countries. In this study, the relative association of SES with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed in patients with T2DM in Iran. The \"Cost estimation of Type 2 Diabetes in Iran\" was used for secondary data analysis. The socio-economic status has been assessed by Categorical principal component analysis (CATPCA) techniques and HRQoL, using EQ-5D Visual Analog Scale, modified for digit preferences. Age, gender, education, occupation, SES, marital status, residency, education (T2DM related), diagnostic methods, number of annual care, type of treatment and Duration of disease awareness were used as independent variables in the multivariable linear regression model. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata software version 11.2. The response rate was 88.6%. Out of 3472 patients, 2128 were female and about 78.7% were from urban areas. All variables associated with T2DM were significant at the level of 0.05 except, the type of treatment, residency and education. Standardized regression coefficient for SES was estimated as 0.106 (p-value<0.0001). It seems that the SES of households in developing countries has a meaningful effect on the HRQoL of patients with T2DM as well as developed countries. Copyright Â© 2013 Diabetes India.

The aim of this study was to compare adults with type 1 diabetes to the general population in terms of health-related quality of life, occupational status (level of employment, working hours and sick leave) and education level. 2415 adults (aged 18-98years) with type 1 diabetes were compared to 48,511 adults (aged 18-103years) from the general population. Data were obtained from two cross-sectional surveys conducted in 2010 and 2011 of adults living or treated in the Capital Region in Denmark. Differences between adults with type 1 diabetes and the general population were standardised for age and sex and analyzed using linear probability models and negative binomial regression. Differences were further analyzed in subgroups. Compared to the general population, adults with type 1 diabetes experienced lower health-related quality of life, were more frequently unemployed, had more sick leave per year and were slightly better educated. Differences in health-related quality of life and employment increased with age and were larger among women, as compared to men. No significant differences were found with regard to working hours. Our findings suggest that type 1 diabetes is associated with lower health-related quality of life, higher unemployment and additional sick leave. The negative association with type 1 diabetes is more pronounced in women and older adults. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We adopted a qualitative exploratory study design using a thematic analysis. Twelve patients with T2DM for more than a 2-year duration were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. Both purposive and theoretical samplings were used for data collection. The in-depth interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim, followed by line-by-line coding and constant comparison to identify the themes. Data management was facilitated using Nvivo 10. Patients shared their mixed feelings about the diagnosis of T2DM. Six domains of quality of life emerged from these interviews, namely physical and social functioning, work function and social obligations, dietary freedom and conforming to treatment standard. Diabetes management needs to take these themes and patientsâ feelings associated with their quality of life into consideration.

Study Design We interviewed overweight/obese, 12â18-year-old youth with T2DM, prediabetes, or insulin resistance (IR) and one parent from 5 US sites. Assessments included Pediatric Quality of Life Inventoryâ¢ (PedsQL), Health Utilities Index (HUI3), family conflict and diabetes burden. Results Among 108 adolescents, diagnoses included 40.7% T2DM, 25.0% prediabetes, and 34.3% IR. PedsQL summary score (SS) was higher among adolescents vs. parents (p=0.02). Parents rated physical functioning lower than adolescents (p<0.0001), but there were no differences in psychosocial health. Adolescent PedsQL SS did not differ by diagnosis but was inversely associated with adolescent BMI z-score (p=0.0004) and family conflict (p<0.0001) and associated with race/ethnicity (p<0.0001). Number of adolescent comorbidities (p=0.007) and burden of diabetes care (p<0.05) were inversely associated with parent PedsQL SS (p<0.05). There were no differences in HUI3. Conclusions Parents perceive their adolescentsâ physical functioning as more impaired than adolescents themselves. Contextual factors including severity of obesity, race/ethnicity, family conflict and burden of diabetes care influence HRQOL. Family-based approaches to treatment and prevention of T2DM may benefit from increased attention to the biopsychosocial context.

The main aim of the current study was to systematically review the characteristics of these studies and examine quality of their findings. Persian (SID, Magiran) and English (Pubmed, Medline, Web of Science, CINAHL, Scopus, PsycINFO and ERIC) databases were systematically searched using the search terms: \"diabetes\" AND \"quality of life\" AND \"Iran\". The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. A total of 46 studies passed the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The included studies were conducted in 20 out of 30 provinces of the country. Most studies investigated HRQoL among people with type 2 diabetes. The Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and WHO quality of life instruments (WHOQOL) were the main instruments used in these studies. Studies showed that people with diabetes had lower HRQoL than people without diabetes. Better socioeconomic status and better control of cardiovascular risk factors were associated with better HRQoL among the patients with diabetes. In general, the predictors of HRQoL among Iranian patients were similar to their international counterparts implying that diabetes patients share many common features. The reviewed studies suffer from major methodological and reporting flaws which limit validity and generalizability of their findings.\n\nMultidimensional study on quality of life in children with type 1 diabetes.\n\nPubMed\n\nAusili, E; Tabacco, F; Focarelli, B; Padua, L; Crea, F; Caliandro, P; Pazzaglia, C; Marietti, G; Rendeli, C\n\n2007-01-01\n\nTo study the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and metabolic assessment in 33 children affected with type 1 diabetes (18 males, 15 females; mean age 10.3 years). We used the Child Health Questionnaire-Parental Form 50 items (CHQ-PF50), measurements of metabolic control and we related them to patient management and family status. Quality of life (QoL) in diabetic children was worse than in the healthy sample. Interestingly, mean and last glycosylated hemoglobin (mean HbAlc r: -.4410 p < .01 and last HbAlc r: -.4012 p < .01), age of patients (r: -.4428; p < .009) and number of glycaemia controls (r: -.37, p < .03) were the most important parameters related to HRQoL parameters. This multidimensional study stressed that HRQoL is influenced by the metabolic assessment. Moreover, the report examined the parental perception of QoL in children with chronic diseases. Higher number of glycaemia controls/day, better metabolic control, lower age of children and earlier onset of diabetes produced better physical and psychological aspects of QoL. In comparison with adolescent patients, in children with diabetes, factors as number of insulin injections and daily snacks, and the level of education of the mother were not so important to influence QoL. Unexpectedly, in this sample, life habits, family features, and anthropometric parameters did not correlate with specific domains of QoL.\n\nTranslation, cultural adaptation, cross-validation of the Turkish diabetes quality-of-life (DQOL) measure.\n\nPubMed\n\nYildirim, Aysegul; Akinci, Fevzi; Gozu, Hulya; Sargin, Haluk; Orbay, Ekrem; Sargin, Mehmet\n\n2007-06-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to test the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the diabetes quality of life (DQOL) questionnaire for use with patients with diabetes. Turkish version of the generic quality of life (QoL) scale 15D and DQOL, socio-demographics and clinical parameter characteristics were administered to 150 patients with type 2 diabetes. Study participants were randomly sampled from the Endocrinology and Diabetes Outpatient Department of Dr. Lutfi Kirdar Kartal Education and Research Hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. The Cronbach alpha coefficient of the overall DQOL scale was 0.89; the Cronbach alpha coefficient ranged from 0.80 to 0.94 for subscales. Distress, discomfort and its symptoms, depression, mobility, usual activities, and vitality on the 15 D scale had statistically significant correlations with social/vocational worry and diabetes-related worry on the DQOL scale indicating good convergent validity. Factor analysis identified four subscales: satisfaction\", impact\", \"diabetes-related worry\", and \"social/vocational worry\". Statistical analyses showed that the Turkish version of the DQOL is a valid and reliable instrument to measure disease related QoL in patients with diabetes. It is a simple and quick screening tool with about 15 +/- 5.8 min administration time for measuring QoL in this population.\n\nMental distress and health-related quality of life among type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients using self-monitoring of blood glucose: A cross-sectional questionnaire study in Japan.\n\nPubMed\n\nTanaka, Nagaaki; Yabe, Daisuke; Murotani, Kenta; Ueno, Shinji; Kuwata, Hitoshi; Hamamoto, Yoshiyuki; Kurose, Takeshi; Takahashi, Nobuo; Akashi, Tomoyuki; Matsuoka, Takashi; Osonoi, Takeshi; Minami, Masae; Shimono, Dai; Seino, Yutaka\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe present multicenter, cross-sectional survey was initiated to evaluate self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)-associated mental distress among patients with diabetes. The survey was carried out in patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes using SMBG recruited from 42 medical institutions. Profiles of Mood States 2 and diabetes therapy-related quality of life questionnaires were used to evaluate mood status and health-related quality of life. Two original questionnaires were also developed to evaluate SMBG 'importance,' 'painfulness' and 'confidence' among patients, and to evaluate physician attitudes to SMBG use. Questionnaires from 517 type 1 diabetes and 1,648 type 2 diabetes patients showed that 46.0% of type 1 diabetes and 37.5% of type 2 diabetes patients reported 'painfulness,' and that these patients reporting 'painfulness' showed significantly higher Profiles of Mood States 2 scores, lower diabetes therapy-related quality of life scores and higher glycated hemoglobin compared with those not reporting 'painfulness,' whereas the number of their daily SMBG tests were comparable. Patients reporting 'painfulness' also reported that SMBG use was significantly less important. Whether or not patients recognized the importance of SMBG use was well correlated with the frequency of physicians checking patient diaries. Type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes patients reporting 'painfulness' in SMBG use had more mental distress, lower health-related quality of life and higher glycated hemoglobin regardless of their number of daily SMBG tests. The importance of SMBG use was recognized less by patients experiencing pain, and the importance of SMBG use was recognized more in medical institutions in which physicians regularly checked SMBG diaries to provide meaningful feedback to patients in clinical settings.

This study aimed to investigate HRQL among individuals with and without diabetes in Bangladesh. The analysis is based on data of a case-control study, including 591 patients with type 2 diabetes (cases) who attended an outpatient unit of a hospital in Dhaka and 591 age -and sex-matched individuals without diabetes (controls). Information about socio-demographic characteristics, health conditions, and HRQL were assessed in a structured interview. HRQL was measured with the EuroQol (EQ) visual analogue scale (VAS) and the EQ five-dimensional (5D) descriptive system. The association between diabetes status and quality of life was examined using multiple linear and logistic regression models. Mean EQ-VAS score of patients with diabetes was 11.5 points lower (95Â %-CI: -13.5, -9.6) compared to controls without diabetes. Patients with diabetes were more likely to report problems in all EQ-5D dimensions than controls, with the largest effect observed in the dimensions 'self-care' (ORâ=â5.9; 95Â %-CI: 2.9, 11.8) and 'mobility' (ORâ=â4.5; 95Â %-CI: 3.0, -6.6). In patients with diabetes, male gender, high education, and high-income were associated with higher VAS score and diabetes duration and foot ulcer associated with lower VAS scores. Other diabetes-related complications were not significantly associated with HRQL. Our findings suggest that the impact of diabetes on HRQL in the Bangladeshi population is much higher than what is known from western populations and that unlike in western populations comorbidities/complications are not the driving factor for this effect.\n\nReview of patient-reported outcome instruments measuring health-related quality of life and satisfaction in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with oral therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoborel de Climens, Aude; Tunceli, Kaan; Arnould, Benoit; Germain, Nicola; Iglay, Kristy; Norquist, Josephine; Brodovicz, Kimberly G\n\n2015-04-01\n\nTreatments and their mode of administration may represent a burden for patients and can therefore impact their health-related quality of life (HRQL) or treatment/health satisfaction. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can be treated with oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs), injectable medications (such as insulin), or a combination of agents. This review aimed to identify patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments measuring HRQL and/or satisfaction that could differentiate between oral medications based on medication related attributes such as efficacy, tolerability, weight loss, dosing frequency and pill burden. Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library and the Patient-Reported Outcome and Quality of Life Questionnaires (PROQOLID) biomedical databases were searched to identify instruments and document their development methodology, content and psychometric properties (i.e. validity, reliability), responsiveness and ability to detect changes between treatments. Nineteen instruments were retained based on their potential to differentiate between OHAs. Ten instruments assessed HRQL, amongst which the Audit of Diabetes Dependent Quality of Life, Diabetes 39, Diabetes Health Profile and Impact of Weight on Quality of Life displayed good psychometric properties in T2DM populations and comprehensive HRQL content. Nine instruments assessed satisfaction. Both the Oral Hypoglycemic Agent Questionnaire (OHAQ) and Diabetes Medication Satisfaction (DiabMedSat) Questionnaire have highly relevant content regarding drug attributes. The OHAQ is specific to oral treatment and the DiabMedSat includes HRQL items. The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire is a standard instrument that is extensively used and provides conclusive results in studies of patients with T2DM. Very few of the existing PRO instruments are specific to OHAs. Despite satisfaction instruments being recommended to differentiate between OHAs in studies of T2DM based on medication attributes, we find\n\nDiabetes Risk and Disease Management in Later Life: A National Longitudinal Study of the Role of Marital Quality\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWaite, Linda; Shen, Shannon\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjectives: We assess the association between marital quality and both the risk of developing diabetes and the management of diabetes after its onset in later life. Method: We use data from the first two waves of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project to estimate regression models with lagged dependent variables. The sample includes 1,228 married respondents, among whom 389 were diabetic. Those with either a reported diagnosis or with HbA1c â¥ 6.5% are identified diabetic. We categorize diabetic respondents into three groups: controlled, undiagnosed, and uncontrolled diabetes. We conduct factor analysis to construct positive and negative marital quality scales. Results: For women, an increase in positive marital quality between Waves 1 and 2 is related to a lower risk of being diabetic at Wave 2, net of diabetes status at Wave 1; surprisingly, for men, an increase in negative marital quality between Waves 1 and 2 is related to both a lower risk of being diabetic at Wave 2 and a higher chance of controlling diabetes at Wave 2 after its onset. Discussion: Our results challenge the traditional assumption that negative marital quality is always detrimental to health and encourage family scholars to distinguish different sources and types of negative marital quality.

Design Cross-sectional population-based study, the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study (LALES). Participants 1,064 LALES participants with diabetes mellitus. Methods HRQOL was measured by the 25 item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) and the Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). DR was assessed by masked standardized grading of stereoscopic photographs from 7 standard fields. Severity of DR in eyes was graded using a modified Airlie House classification. The severity scores from each eye were then concatenated to create a single per person grade ranging from 1(no DR in either eye) to 15 (bilateral PDR). Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to determine the independent relationship between severity of DR and HRQOL after adjusting for covariates. Main Outcome Measures NEI-VFQ-25 and SF-12 scores. Results More severe DR was associated with worse HRQOL scores on all of the NEI VFQ-25 and SF-12 subscales (P<0.05). Individuals with DR from grade 2 (minimum NPDR) through grade 8 (unilateral moderate NPDR) show a modest decline in HRQOL. However, the decline become significantly steeper between steps 8 (unilateral moderate NPDR) and 9-15 (bilateral moderate NPDR to bilateral PDR). The domains with the most significant impact were for vision-related daily activities, dependency and mental health. Conclusion Greater severity of DR was associated with lower general and vision-specific HRQOL. Persons with bilateral moderate NPDR had the most substantial decrease in quality of life compared to those with less severe DR. The prevention of incident DR and more importantly its progression from unilateral to bilateral NPDR is likely to have a positive impact on a personâs HRQOL and should be considered an important goal in\n\nThe Role of Negative Affect in the Assessment of Quality of Life among Women with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGawlik, Nicola R.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBackground The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of negative affect (defined in terms of lack of optimism, depressogenic attributional style, and hopelessness depression) on the quality of life of women with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Methods Participants (n=177) completed either an online or paper questionnaire made available to members of Australian diabetes support groups. Measures of optimism, attributional style, hopelessness depression, disease-specific data, and diabetes-related quality of life were sought. Bivariate correlations informed the construction of a structural equation model. Results Participants were 36.3Â±11.3 years old, with a disease duration of 18.4Â±11.2 years. Age and recent glycosylated hemoglobin readings were significant contextual variables in the model. All bivariate associations involving the components of negative affect were as hypothesized. That is, poorer quality of life was associated with a greater depressogenic attributional style, higher hopelessness depression, and lower optimism. The structural equation model demonstrated significant direct effects of depressogenic attributional style and hopelessness depression on quality of life, while (lack of) optimism contributed to quality of life indirectly by way of these variables. Conclusion The recognition of negative affect presentations among patients, and an understanding of its relevance to diabetes-related quality of life, is a valuable tool for the practitioner. PMID:29199406\n\nHealth-related quality of life and all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes on dialysis\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground This study tests the hypotheses that health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in prevalent dialysis patients with diabetes is lower than in dialysis patients without diabetes, and is at least as poor as diabetic patients with another severe complication, i.e. foot ulcers. This study also explores the mortality risk associated with diabetes in dialysis patients. Methods HRQOL was assessed using the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36), in a cross-sectional study of 301 prevalent dialysis patients (26% with diabetes), and compared with diabetic patients not on dialysis (nâ=â221), diabetic patients with foot ulcers (nâ=â127), and a sample of the general population (nâ=â5903). Mortality risk was assessed using a Kaplan-Meier plot and Cox proportional hazards analysis. Results Self-assessed vitality, general and mental health, and physical function were significantly lower in dialysis patients with diabetes than in those without. Vitality (pâ=â0.011) and general health (p <0.001) was impaired in diabetic patients receiving dialysis compared to diabetic patients with foot ulcers, but other subscales did not differ. Diabetes was a significant predictor for mortality in dialysis patients, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.6 (95% CI 1.0-2.5) after adjustment for age, dialysis vintage and coronary artery disease. Mental aspects of HRQOL were an independent predictor of mortality in diabetic patients receiving dialysis after adjusting for age and dialysis vintage (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0-5.0). Conclusions Physical aspects of HRQOL were perceived very low in dialysis patients with diabetes, and lower than in other dialysis patients and diabetic patients without dialysis. Mental aspects predicted mortality in dialysis patients with diabetes. Increased awareness and measures to assist physical function impairment may be particularly important in diabetes patients on dialysis.

Adults 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes residing in the South Texas Lower Rio Grande Valley and in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico, were recruited using a convenience sampling technique and interviewed face-to-face with a structured survey. HRQL was measured using physical and mental health summary components of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form. HRQL correlates included demographic characteristics, health factors, access to healthcare, and family support. Samples characteristics were compared using the Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Associations between dependent and independent variables were examined using unadjusted and adjusted (multiple variable) logistic regression models. There were no significant differences between Valley and Reynosa respondents in physical or mental health status scores. Valley participants with lower socioeconomic status and those perceiving their supportive relative's level of diabetes-related knowledge as \"low\" were more likely to report worse physical health than those lacking those characteristics. In the Reynosa group, lower physical health status was associated with duration of diabetes and insulin use. Both sample populations with clinical depressive symptoms were more likely to have worse physical and mental health than those without such symptoms. HRQL is an important outcome in monitoring health status. Understanding the levels and influences of HRQL in U.S.-Mexico border residents with diabetes may help improve diabetes management programs.\n\nFatigue in Type 2 Diabetes: Impact on Quality of Life and Predictors.\n\nPubMed\n\nSingh, Rupali; Teel, Cynthia; Sabus, Carla; McGinnis, Patricia; Kluding, Patricia\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFatigue is a persistent symptom, impacting quality of life (QoL) and functional status in people with type 2 diabetes, yet the symptom of fatigue has not been fully explored. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between fatigue, QoL functional status and to investigate the predictors of fatigue. These possible predictors included body mass index (BMI), Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), sleep quality, pain, number of complications from diabetes, years since diagnosis and depression. Forty-eight individuals with type 2 diabetes (22 females, 26 males; 59.66Â±7.24 years of age; 10.45 Â±7.38 years since diagnosis) participated in the study. Fatigue was assessed by using Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20). Other outcomes included: QoL (Audit of Diabetes Dependent QoL), and functional status (6 minute walk test), BMI, HbA1c, sleep (Pittsburg sleep quality index, PSQI), pain (Visual Analog Scale), number of complications, years since diagnosis, and depression (Beck's depression Inventory-2). The Pearson correlation analysis followed by multivariable linear regression model was used. Fatigue was negatively related to quality of life and functional status. Multivariable linear regression analysis revealed sleep, pain and BMI as the independent predictors of fatigue signaling the presence of physiological (sleep, pain, BMI) phenomenon that could undermine health outcomes.\n\nFatigue in Type 2 Diabetes: Impact on Quality of Life and Predictors\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTeel, Cynthia; Sabus, Carla; McGinnis, Patricia; Kluding, Patricia\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFatigue is a persistent symptom, impacting quality of life (QoL) and functional status in people with type 2 diabetes, yet the symptom of fatigue has not been fully explored.

A sedentary lifestyle is considered to be a modifiable risk factor for type 2 diabetes and an independent predictor of poor quality of life. Exercise is a key treatment for people living with diabetes. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review to assess the effect of exercise on the quality of life of people with type 2 diabetes. We conducted a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL and three Chinese databases were searched for studies published until January 2016. The review included all clinical trials that evaluated the effect of exercise on quality of life compared with that of usual care for people with type 2 diabetes. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of all the included studies, by using the Downs and Black Quality Index (QI). Thirty studies met inclusion criteria, with 2785 "
