        "text": "Mrs Columbo\n\nCaptain Mainwaringâ€™s wife\n\nThere is an episode of her on one of the Columbo dvd's series.\n\nRuined it for me as she was an awful woman. Wish I had never watched it.\n\nIts not part of the Columbo TV series and was pretty much disowned by all concerned. I think they rebranded to try and move away from the Columbo link which didn't really fit.\n\nIn the Columbo series you never see his wife.\n\nI remember hearing that in one episode of the rebooted series that started in 1989 Lt Columbo talked about some woman that had been going around pretending to be his wife\n\n0\n\nKerrys mum in This Country. I love her shes so funny always shouts to kerry from her bedroom.\n\nSimilar to one of the little britain sketches where david walliams comes into a shop , book shop i think run by Matt Lucas. Walliams asks a question and Lucas doesnt know the answer so he shouts up to his wife who answers.\n\nSimilar to Jack Dee's sitcom Bad Move, where the shopkeeper repeats everything Kerry Godliman says to her husband in the back, and we hear his answer but never see him.\n\n1\n\nMr Swaineyâ€™s mother in One Foot in the Grave\n\nMy first thought when I saw the thread title.\n\nWhen he used to shout up at the bedroom window to her, I sometimes wondered if he had her corpse in there and was pretending she was still alive or she was just a figment of his imagination ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜ƒ\n\n0\n\nMr Swaineyâ€™s mother in One Foot in the Grave\n\nMy first thought when I saw the thread title.\n\nWhen he used to shout up at the bedroom window to her, I sometimes wondered if he had her corpse in there and was pretending she was still alive or she was just a figment of his imagination ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜ƒ\n\nMargarets mother came to stay in one episode also didn't she but we never saw or heard her either. I suppose as she lived away then it was more understandable we never saw her but she was often mentioned and was often on the phone etc to margaret\n\nCome to think of it after her death we heard her answer phone message\n\n0\n\nThe other of the Grace siblings in Are You Being Served.\n\nDennis Potter's 'Blue Remembered Hills' has a character, the alpha male of the children's gang, referred to several times by the other actors but who is never seen, can't remember the name.\n\n0\n\nI always thought it would be fun to get all the descriptions of Maris from Fraiser and give it to a police artist and find out what she would look like\n\n0\n\nVera, Norm's wife in Cheers.\n\nYes and no. We saw her just not her face when she went around to Carla's for Thanksgiving and got a face full of cake. I think she was played by George Wendt's real wife.\n\n0\n\nThe other of the Grace siblings in Are You Being Served.\n\nDennis Potter's 'Blue Remembered Hills' has a character, the alpha male of the children's gang, referred to several times by the other actors but who is never seen, can't remember the name.\n\nOld Mr Grace, played by Kenneth Waller in eight episodes.\n\nOddly enough it was obvious (even with make up to make the actor look old) he looked about 20 years younger than Young Mr Grace.\n\n0\n\nI was going to say the General in \"Dastardly & Mutley\". But you did see his fist coming out of the telephone and slapping Dick Dastardly.\n\n2\n\nThe good life had Mrs dooms-patterson and miss mountshaft.\n\nMiss Cathcart in hi de hi\n\nSheridan in keeping up appearances\n\nJoyce in hollyoaks\n\nI love an unseen character\n\nwe never saw Joe Maplin either - in HI Di Hi\n\nHe does appear on screen in one early episode, but his face is never shown. The idea is that he's visiting the camp in disguise, pretending to be a camper, to carry out a secret inspection. Ted and Spike see him returning to his car and being driven out, and it's mostly only his trouser legs and shoes that are shown of him.\n\n0\n\nDid we ever see Sheridan Bucket?\n\nThankfully not. I have my own image of what he looks like (he has a monacle and wears plus fours) which is completely wrong, but i wouldnt like it ruined\n\n2"
