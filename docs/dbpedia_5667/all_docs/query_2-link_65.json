        "text": "I’m a big fan of Fats. Three of them, specifically. There’s Minnesota Fats; although it’s really more that I was a fan of Jackie Gleason, who played Fats in “The Hustler.”\n\nI’m a huge fan of Fats Domino. When I was a kid first getting into music, some of my favorite records were the 45s my mom had of Domino (kids, you can look up what a “45” is). I wish I wasn’t a fan of the third fats – that would be trans fats. Cookies, doughnuts, French fries, and too many to list, all containing trans fats.\n\nThere’s now a fourth Fat I’m a fan of, and that’s Fats Waller. This after seeing the opening night performance of “Ain’t Misbehavin’ – The Fats Waller Musical Show” at the California Center for the Arts, Escondido.\n\nBefore seeing the show, I only knew a few of his tunes (the title track being one of them). I also knew that Nell Carter, from the show “Gimme a Break!” got her big break, and a Tony Award in 1978 for her Broadway performance in “Ain’t Misbehavin’.”\n\nEven though rock ‘n roll is my favorite music genre, there are artists in all genres I enjoy. And I was more than happy to open my mind, and my ears, to some old school jazz.\n\nOne of the things that worried me was how they’d put this production together. As a fan of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, I might be one of the few theatergoers who was only mildly entertained by the live production of “Jersey Boys.” There was something that just didn’t work for me with the narrator, in a corny way, explaining things to the audience. Yet in this scaled down production about Fats Waller, there were only a few moments where things were explained to the audience. It worked brilliantly.\n\nOne of those was about Waller getting $50 a tune selling songs in Tin Pan Alley, only to have artists get more money with these big hits. Another moment that worked well, was being educated on what “stride piano” was. It’s a style he helped make popular.\n\nThere was also a way this amazing ensemble talked about the members of Fats Waller’s band that was so creative and fun. Oh, and speaking of bands, the live band in this show wasn’t chopped liver.\n\nWhen I review movies, I often talk about the usual things – the acting, cinematography, soundtrack, etc. I don’t make it a habit to review musicals and hadn’t even planned to write one. My editor had tickets, and a broken bone was his misfortune and my good luck. He passed them along to me. My wife and I had such a great time at the show, and it disappointed me so much to not see a full house on opening night on a Saturday. If a movie like “Top Gun: Maverick” can make a billion dollars (and it was merely mediocre), this production should be bringing in bigger crowds. Not just folks from Escondido, but anyone that can appreciate live entertainment, whether that’s actors on stage or a live band.\n\nThis is the best of both worlds.\n\nWhen I sat down to write this, I thought I’d pick my three favorite songs. Yet I had trouble narrowing it down. The show starts off with some images of New York and the Cotton Club, and we get some narration and piano. Things started off lively with “Ain’t Misbehavin’.”\n\nI figured they’d be in trouble doing such a strong number first. But a few songs later it was “T Ain’t Nobody’s Biz-ness If I Do” with Mark Antony Howard’s strong vocals. That’s the first song Waller ever recorded, and it’s amazing to think that something from 1922 holds up 100 years later. That was followed by “Honeysuckle Rose” – beautifully sung by Paula Galloway and DeAndre Simmons. And now I have a lovely memory associated with that, since I hated the Willie Nelson movie of the same name. Oh, and fun fact: Simmons is a native San Diegan, and an alumnus of the San Diego School of Creative and Performing Arts. He’s been in productions all over town, as well as L.A. and off-Broadway.\n\nThat was followed by “Squeeze Me” – easily the most romantic number of the night, and Katie Porter nails it.\n\nFour songs later, I thought “How Ya Baby” was my favorite number. Howard and Felicia Fairley were terrific, and the dance number that accompanied it, knocked my socks off. I think it also knocked the socks off of the feet of the dude in front of me, although he was wearing shorts and sandals, so who knows?\n\nThat was followed by a slow ballad called “The Jitterbug Waltz.” We got to see some romantic slow dancing, as a mirrored disco ball came down to create some nice atmosphere.\n\nThat was followed by “The Ladies Who Sing with The Band” that Simmons and Howard sang, and it got some laughs from the crowd. I liked the song after it better, though. “Yacht Club Swing” is so much better than yacht rock! Fairley was funny, sexy, and sultry as she belted this number out. She also was joined by a few others for the next number – “When the Nylons Bloom Again” – and again, more laughs. How can you not smile seeing a woman swing her hips almost in a burlesque fashion, as she sings:\n\n“I’ll be happy when the nylons bloom again/cotton is monotonous to men. Only way to keep affection fresh/Get some mesh for your flesh.”\n\nGalloway follows this with “Cash for Your Trash” and her spunky delivery and astounding pipes…left the crowd breathless.\n\nThere were a few more songs, ending with “The Joint Is Jumpin’” and so was this crowd. The entire company got to shine in this number, and it was a great closing to the first act. I wasn’t sure how they’d be able to top what we had just witnessed.\n\nMy wife and I grabbed a few glasses of wine and went back in for Act Two.\n\nThey started things “Spreadin’ Rhythm Around” and spreading the love around – as we got to see the backing band up close. It’s nice they got a moment to shine, as the stage moved to bring them up close.\n\nAbout three songs in, we heard “The Viper’s Drag” – which I was all prepared to say was my least favorite of the show. Maybe with marijuana being legal now, this “reefer song” as it’s called in the program, just doesn’t hold up as well; but I’ll be damned if Howard wasn’t so fun and animated as he sang it, that you enjoy the number anyway (and really, who doesn’t dream of having a five-foot-long joint in a juke joint?)\n\nA few songs later, it was “Your Feet’s Too Big.” I remember first hearing that as a kid, on The Muppet Show. It was even funnier now, seeing Simmons act it out on stage, with his terrific facial expressions and pantomime. This all got me thinking about how many times I’ve learned about classical music and standards, from watching Muppets, Sesame Street, and Bugs Bunny.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nEasily one of my favorite songs was “That Ain’t Right” by Nat “King” Cole, and Howard, Porter and the rest of them did it justice. With lyrics like:\n\nI went to a fortune teller/And had my fortune told\n\nHe said you didn’t love me/All you wanted was my gold.\n\nNow, isn’t that so much more clever than “I ain’t sayin’ she’s a gold digger…”?\n\nThat number also showed a little danger that could go down at the cotton clubs.\n\nAnd it segued nicely into the sexy “Keepin’ Out of Mischief Now.” And when you hear Felicia Fairley sing, you think – there might not be a better voice that’s singing right now in the world. And I’m sitting here, in Escondido, listening to it.\n\nPorter and Galloway then bring the house down with laughs, as they sing “Find Out What They Like” – as they sing about how to take care of your man to keep him happy at home. Alright. Things are getting a bit risqué up in this joint!\n\nMore laughs come a few songs later with “Fat & Greasy” as the guys sing about a stinky loser in the club.\n\nThat’s followed by the somber moment of the night – the cast singing “Black and Blue.” That’s a song San Diegan Frankie Laine once covered (as well as Louis Armstrong and so many others).\n\nThe last five songs of the show were songs by others that Waller helped make hits (my favorite of that bunch was “I’m Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself A Letter,” sung by Simmons.)\n\nSpecial props should also go to that incredible orchestra. Kevin Toney on piano and bookending the show was perfect. I enjoyed Danny King on drums, with his white beard, smile on his face – he helped add an energy to the shindig.\n\nI don’t know enough about live theatre to know exactly what is involved in directing, but Ken Page did something right here. And he’s the cat that created the role of “Ken” in the original Broadway version of “Ain’t Misbehavin’” (and for that, we’ll forgive him for being a part of “Cats”.)\n\nWhen I was picking up my tickets, an older couple in front of me was buying tickets for that night, and the following evening. After the one show I saw, I’m guessing I’ll be back again.\n\nThe show runs until October 8. You’d be a fool to miss it.\n\nJosh Board is a long-time journalist, but new Escondido resident.
