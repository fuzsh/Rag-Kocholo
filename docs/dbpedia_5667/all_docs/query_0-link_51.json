        "text": "Approximately 125 prehistoric rock paintings have been found in the modern territory of Finland. The paintings were done with red ochre and are almost without exception located on steep lakeshore cliffs associated with ancient water routes. Most of the sites are found in the central and eastern parts of the country, especially on the shores of Lakes Päijänne and Saimaa. Using shore displacement chronology, the art has been dated to ca. 5000 – 1500 BC. It was thus created mainly during the Stone Age and can be associated with the so-called ‘Comb Ware’ cultures of the Subneolithic period. The range of motifs is rather limited, consisting mainly of schematic depictions of stick-figure humans, elks, boats, handprints and geometric signs. Few paintings include any evidence of narrative scenes, making their interpretation a rather difficult task. In Finnish archaeological literature, the paintings have traditionally been associated with ’sympathetic’ hunting magic, or the belief that the ritual shooting of the painted animals would increase hunting luck. Some writers have also suggested totemistic and shamanistic readings of the art. This dissertation is a critical review of the interpretations offered of Finnish rock art and an exploration of the potentials of archaeological and ethnographic research in increasing our knowledge of its meaning. Methods used include ’formal’ approaches such as archaeological excavation, landscape analysis and the application of neuropsychological research to the study of rock art, as well as ethnographically ’informed’ approaches that make use of Saami and Baltic Finnish ethnohistorical sources in interpretation. In conclusion, it is argued that although North European hunter-gatherer rock art is often thought to lie beyond the reach of ‘informed’ knowledge, the exceptional continuity of prehistoric settlement in Finland validates the informed approach in the interpretation of Finnish rock paintings. The art can be confidently associated with shamanism of the kind still practiced by the Saami of Northern Fennoscandia in the historical period. Evidence of similar shamanistic practices, concepts and cosmology are also found in traditional Finnish-Karelian epic poetry. Previous readings of the art based on ‘hunting magic’ and totemism are rejected. Most of the paintings appear to depict experiences of falling into a trance, of shamanic metamorphosis and trance journeys, and of ‘spirit helper’ beings comparable to those employed by the Saami shaman (noaidi). As demonstrated by the results of an excavation at the rock painting of Valkeisaari, the painted cliffs themselves find a close parallel in the Saami cult of the 'sieidi', or sacred cliffs and boulders worshipped as expressing a supernatural power. Like the Saami, the prehistoric inhabitants of the Finnish Lake Region seem to have believed that certain cliffs were ’alive’ and inhabited by the spirit helpers of the shaman. The rock paintings can thus be associated with shamanic vision quests, and the making of ‘art’ with an effort to socialize the other members of the community, especially the ritual specialists, with trance visions. However, the paintings were not merely to be looked at. The red ochre handprints pressed on images of elks, as well as the fact that many paintings appear ’smeared’, indicate that they were also to be touched – perhaps in order to tap into the supernatural potency inherent in the cliff and in the paintings of spirit animals.\n\nThis article attempts to extend the study of rock-art beyond the visual to include the non-visual experiences and perceptions of human beings. It will be argued that there is ‘more than meets the eye’ when interpreting rock-art. Rather than restricting interpretation to the visual, the relationship between rock ‘art’, rock-art ‘site’ and the wider landscape is considered as articulated within a socially and historically specific Neolithic (c. 4000 – 500 BC) hunter-gatherer ‘mindscape’. An audio-visual perspective is argued, where the auditory sense and visual experience of the landscape combine in a vital interplay that is essential to the interpretation of 25 out of about 80 known rock-engraving sites in northern Scandinavia (c. 33 %). These sites have in common a strong water-centric focus; in particular noisy, running water. This approach provides a more profound understanding of these rock-art sites and the prehistoric use of ‘images’ as transmitters of different kinds of knowledge from the mundane to the esoteric. The ebb and flow of water and human breath are argued to be analogous within a frame of enquiry that also considers shamanistic practice in approaching and experiencing these rock-engraving sites.\n\nThe archaeoacoustic team of the University of Helsinki has been studying how sacred sites in Northern Europe, used by shamanic cultures since prehistoric times, are home to remarkable acoustic properties. This chapter focuses on natural-site acoustics as a magic tool in ritual practices. Based on our acoustic measurements as well as experimental sound tests carried out during in situ studies of prehistoric and historic sacred sites in Finland, we discuss possible sound media (voice, instruments, noise), performing techniques and methods of sound production used at the sites. While the acoustic study of the sacred sites is at the core of our research, we also discuss the visual aspects and visual phenomena observed at the sites during our fieldwork. Our attempt to restore the sound culture of shamanism associated with the hosting sites and their sound potential profoundly rests on ethnographic research of the Finno-Ugric peoples, predominantly the Sámi and the Finns. The end result of this ethnographic and practical research study is our interpretation of the shamanic ritual practices as seen through the prism of the miraculous acoustic illusions and visual appearances created by the sacred sites.\n\nThe archaeoacoustic team of the University of Helsinki has been studying how sacred sites in Northern Europe, used by shamanic cultures since prehistoric times, are home to remarkable acoustic properties.

Analyzing writings that deal with rock art of Southern Africa and Native America，the author shows how surrounding intellectual fashions affected scholarly approaches to the interpretation of ancient and modern petroglyphs. Originally scholars and writers viewed rock art from a materialistic viewpoint as a manifestation of hunting magic. Yet，since the 1980s—1990s, the petroglyphs have been increasingly reinterpreted in spiritual terms. The author argues that such change of perspective was informed by the decline of positivism in humanities and social sciences, the ascent of post-modernism，and the emergence of the large New Age thought collective and print media in the 1970s—1990s. To better root themselves in history，the latter widely appropriated archaeology for their spiritual practices（e.g. whistling bottles, various stone age figurines), mainstreaming the \"ancient wisdom” into the general culture. Many archaeologists began to cast rock art as a manifestation of shamanic practices and related spiritual experiences. Particularly，the essay analyzes the scholarship of those authors who spearheaded a so-called entoptic interpretation (David Lewis-Williams, Jean Clottes, and David Whitely）that spiritualized rock art. Lastly, the author shows how such scholarly reassessment trickled down into popular media and interpretive tourist sites.\n\nSince 20 years ago, many rock art sites around the world were interpreted from a shamanic point of view. If the controversy was very important when discussing the Paleolithic parietal art, it seems that there was less reaction for the rock art of other regions. Furthermore this is even more valid when shamans are ethnographically documented in the region. And this is the case for the rock paintings and engravings of the Canadian Shield where medicine-men and not less than four different kind of shamans are documented. But this is not sufficient to attribute the creation of the glyphs on the rocks to this category of people. I will study the importance of the shamans, their link to the pictography and the representations of shamans on the rocks to understand if the rock art was created by shamans, in a shamanic context or were just sacred."
