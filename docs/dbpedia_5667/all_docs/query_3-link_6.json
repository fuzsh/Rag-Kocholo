It was founded in 2000 by former Marvel Entertainment CEO Eric Ellenbogen and former Broadway Video executive John Engelman in hopes of acquiring mismanaged classic properties and giving exposure to them.\n\nTheir library consists of properties that they acquired from other companies, including United Productions of America, Harvey Entertainment, Golden Books Family Entertainment, Big Idea Entertainment, Cosgrove Hall, Maddocks Cartoon Productions, Trumptonshire, CMTB Animation, Mark Mason Animation and Entertainment Rights.\n\nHistory[]\n\nClassic Media era (2000-2012)[]\n\nIn May 2000, Ellenbogen and Engelman launched Classic Media with funding from Pegasus Capital Advisors, Frank Biondi's Waterview Partners and the Tisch family. Classic Media acquired a number of companies for their media properties including UPA and Harvey Entertainment[5] With Random House in 2001, Classic Media won a bankruptcy court auction for the assets of Golden Books Family Entertainment including the assumption the debt, with Random House receiving all the publishing properties and Classic its entertainment division.[6][7] In 2002, the company teamed up with the estate of Jay Ward to create a joint venture, Bullwinkle Studios, which manages all rights to the Jay Ward Productions animated catalog (with Classic Media owning an 80% stake and the Ward estate owning 20%). In 2003, Classic Media purchased the assets of the bankrupt Big Idea Productions.[8]\n\nIn 2005, the company was recapitalized by an investment group led by Spectrum Equity Investors and existing partner Pegasus Capital Advisors.
