Jeffrey's narrative is woven with rich threads of Native American history and his unique personal experiences, which have culminated in a dynamic collage of materials, sounds, and ideas in his art. He brings to light the emotional weight and significance of reconnecting with his roots at the Choctaw Reservation, offering listeners a heartfelt glimpse into cultural reconciliation and the continuity of Indigenous traditions.In this episode, we explore the resilience and survival of Indigenous communities, particularly through their vibrant traditions of dance, prayer, language, and artistry, despite the historical and ongoing adversities they face. Jeffrey and our hosts shine a spotlight on the individual creativity and aesthetic choices of Native artists, both past and present, and the powerful role of artistic expression in sustaining cultural identity and hope. Additionally, the episode delves into the intertwined histories of Native and African-American communities, touching on shared struggles and the enduring spirit of empowerment within their art and cultures.Jeffrey also opens up about the transformative impact of his international art education, including pivotal moments at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Royal College of Art in London. From the excitement and validation of being recognized at the Venice Biennale to the profound experience of being the first Indigenous artist to have a solo show at the US Pavilion, Jeffrey's story is one of navigating representation, recognition, and the global stage. We wrap up with an insightful discussion on the importance of community, collaboration, and the thriving moment of Indigenous art, underscored by the landmark volume \"An Indigenous Present\" and its forthcoming exhibition. Don't miss this enriching conversation celebrating the flourishing visibility and appreciation of Indigenous artistry.\n\nWe meet artist Puppies Puppies. Jade Guanaro Kuriki-Olivo (b. 1989, Dallas, TX), widely known by the moniker Puppies Puppies, expands ideas around the readymade by imbuing ubiquitous and everyday objects, signifiers, and actions with a personal and political charge. Puppies Puppies works across sculpture, installation, and performance art.She has, for example, reconfigured antibacterial gel dispensers, toilet bowl liquid, the color green, as well as the acts of sleeping, peeing, and taking a pill in installations and performances that challenge ableist frameworks of artistic and capitalist production. Many of Puppies Puppies's exhibitions have also included actionable components: a GoFundMe campaign to support a friend's transition fund, free HIV testing and counseling, and a working shower available for use by the public. Kuriki-Olivo thus asserts that life can be viewed as its own form of endurance practice, especially for those whose very survival is at stake, including trans, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming people of color.At the Venice Biennale 2024, Puppies Puppies is exhibiting two works. A Sculpture for Trans Women... (2023) is a life-size bronze sculpture taken from a 3-D scan of the artist's body. Emblazoned with the word “WOMAN”, the work – which will be activated with performances throughout the Biennale – subverts the power of monuments to make visible and celebrates trans life in an act of protest and commemoration.Electric Dress (Atsuko Tanaka) (2023) pays tribute to those killed in 2016 at the mass shooting that took place during a “Latin Night” party at Pulse, a queer nightclub in Orlando, Florida. The sculpture references Atsuko Tanaka's Electric Dress (1956) with LED lights that flicker to the pulse of a heartbeat and lights that cycle through the rainbow colours found in the Progress Pride Flag. Both sculptures honour queer and trans life while confronting oblivion and invisibility.Follow @PuppiesPuppiesJadeSpecial thanks to Daniel Balice of @BaliceHertling gallery for connecting us! https://www.balicehertling.com Hosted on Acast.

But the “Olympics of the art world” is already well underway in Italy: Hundreds of thousands of art lovers are flocking to the Venice Biennale, which runs through November 24. This massive exhibition has been held every two years with very few exceptions since 1895, when it was inaugurated as the world's first art biennial. Visitors who devote a whole week of their time will still only be able to take in a sliver of the art on display, whether it's at the central exhibition, the collateral events, or the dozens of storied national pavilions in the Giardini and around the city. But that's not all the exhibition has in store. The politics of the art world are also on full display, whether in the form of protests or the curators' decisions about how their countries — with all their past and present controversies — will be represented. This year's included Russia offering its pavilion up to Indigenous artists from Bolivia, Brazil renaming its pavilion “Hãhãwpuá” after the Indigenous Patxohã term for the land, Poland welcoming an art collective from Ukraine, the United States featuring Jeffrey Gibson as the first Native American artist to have a solo exhibition at the pavilion, and Israel canceling its exhibition … which perhaps wasn't really canceled after all. Hyperallergic Editor-in-Chief Hrag Vartanian and longtime contributor AX Mina sat down to reflect on the aesthetic successes, political failures, and long-awaited representation they saw displayed at the world's biggest contemporary art show.

Known for her colourful, large-scale abstract paintings, Beatriz Milhazes' practice reflects how Brazilian culture has long ‘assimilated' plural influences, particularly the effects of Portuguese and Spanish colonial rule between the 17th and 19th centuries. Arches, doors, stained glass windows, and burnished golds, drawn from churches across South America, recur as motifs in works spanning forty years. Beatriz layers ruffles and rosettes, precursors to the circles in her more recent paintings, from royal Hispanic costumes, and textiles found in city markets and Carnival parades. Her studio overlooks Rio de Janeiro's botanical garden, another construct of colonial rule, and environment which inspires her creations. For the artist, flowers are both ‘natural' and ‘plastic' bodies - like the water, and ‘salty sea breeze' which connects her home in Brazil and the coastal cities of Britain, where her work is currently on display. Beatriz outlines the centrality of nature in popular and indigenous cultural production, and interest in ornamental ‘body drawings' by women in the Kadiwéu tribe. She shares how she adapts the concept of collage to painting on canvas, calling on Western/European modernism, geometric abstraction, and ‘scientific research' into colour for her exhibition at the Venice Biennale in 2024. From a kimono in the collection of the V&A, a diplomatic gift from the emperor of Japan, Beatriz travels to her Yellow Flower Dream (2018) for the 'Art House Project' on Inujima - an island in the country's Seto Island Sea, also recreated in Kensington, at Japan House London. We touch on more histories of migration in São Paulo, home to Japan's largest diasporic community, and the ‘union' of cultural, economic, and ecological regeneration taking place across continents today.

It is very important to me.\"It: Marcella alzò un sopracciglio. \"Un dipinto? Qui, durante la Biennale di Venezia? Sei sicuro che sia stato perso e non... venduto?\"En: Marcella raised an eyebrow. \"A painting? Here, during the Venice Biennale? Are you sure it's been lost and not… sold?\"It: Luca deglutì. Sapeva che doveva convincere Marcella.En: Luca swallowed. He knew he had to convince Marcella.It: \"No, non è così. La mia famiglia ha una storia difficile. Questo dipinto era l'unico ricordo che avevo di mio nonno.\"En: \"No, it's not like that. My family has a difficult history. This painting was the only memory I had of my grandfather.\"It: Marcella prese appunti, ma il suo viso rimase scettico. \"E come è scomparso questo dipinto?\"En: Marcella took notes, but her face remained skeptical. \"And how did this painting disappear?\"It: \"Stavo trasportandolo in una galleria d'arte per una mostra. L'ho lasciato in macchina per cinque minuti mentre prendevo un caffè. Quando sono tornato, era sparito.\"En: \"I was transporting it to an art gallery for an exhibition. I left it in the car for five minutes while I got a coffee. When I came back, it was gone.\"It: Marcella sospirò. \"Sai quanti casi come il tuo ho visto? La gente dice di aver perso qualcosa di valore e poi scopriamo che l'hanno venduto o nascosto.\"En: Marcella sighed. \"Do you know how many cases like yours I've seen? People say they've lost something valuable, and then we discover they sold or hid it.\"It: Luca tirò fuori una vecchia fotografia del dipinto, con lui bambino e suo nonno accanto.En: Luca pulled out an old photograph of the painting, with himself as a child and his grandfather beside him.It: \"Guarda, questa è la prova. Questo dipinto ha un valore sentimentale oltre che artistico. Non l'avrei mai venduto.\"En: \"Look, this is proof. This painting has sentimental as well as artistic value. I would never have sold it.\"It: Marcella guardò la foto, poi Luca. Qualcosa nel suo sguardo sembrava genuine.En: Marcella looked at the photo, then at Luca. Something in his gaze seemed genuine.It: \"Okay. Raccontami di più su questo dipinto. Perché è così importante?\"En: \"Okay. Tell me more about this painting. Why is it so important?\"It: Luca iniziò a condividere la storia del suo nonno, un artista di talento che aveva dipinto scene di Venezia.En: Luca began to share the story of his grandfather, a talented artist who had painted scenes of Venice.It: \"Questo dipinto è l'ultimo che ha fatto prima di morire. Ha iniziato a insegnarmi a dipingere usando proprio quei colori e quelle tecniche.\"En: \"This painting is the last one he made before he died. He started teaching me to paint using those very colors and techniques.\"It: Marcella stava iniziando a credergli. Decise di seguire un'idea.En: Marcella was beginning to believe him. She decided to follow a lead.It: \"Hai detto che stavi portando il dipinto a una galleria. Ricordi qualcuno che ti ha osservato quel giorno?\"En: \"You said you were taking the painting to a gallery. Do you remember anyone observing you that day?\"It: Luca ricordava un uomo in cappotto scuro che sembrava fuori posto nel caldo estivo. \"Sì, c'era un uomo strano vicino alla mia macchina.\"En: Luca recalled a man in a dark coat who seemed out of place in the summer heat. \"Yes, there was a strange man near my car.\"It: Marcella fece un cenno e iniziò a investigare. Dopo alcune ore, trovò una pista.En: Marcella nodded and began to investigate. After a few hours, she found a lead.It: Scoprì che l'uomo faceva parte di un gruppo di ladri d'arte che operava a Venezia, approfittando dell'afflusso di turisti per la Biennale.En: She discovered that the man was part of a group of art thieves operating in Venice, taking advantage of the influx of tourists for the Biennale.It: Insieme, seguirono le tracce che li portarono a un vecchio magazzino.En: Together, they followed the trail that led them to an old warehouse.It: Qui trovarono il dipinto di Luca, nascosto tra altre opere rubate.En: There they found Luca's painting, hidden among other stolen works.It: Luca si sentì sollevato e grato.En: Luca felt relieved and grateful.It: \"Grazie,\" disse a Marcella. Gli occhi brillavano di lacrime non versate. \"Non solo per il dipinto, ma per avermi creduto.\"En: \"Thank you,\" he said to Marcella, his eyes shining with unshed tears. \"Not just for the painting, but for believing in me.\"It: Marcella sorrideva per la prima volta. \"A volte la verità è più strana della finzione. E a volte, bisogna solo ascoltare.\"En: Marcella smiled for the first time. \"Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. And sometimes, you just need to listen.\"It: Da quel giorno, Luca cominciò ad aprirsi di più riguardo al suo passato, mentre Marcella imparò a non essere così scettica.En: From that day, Luca began to open up more about his past, while Marcella learned not to be so skeptical.It: Insieme, formarono un'amicizia improbabile ma forte, nata da un dipinto e dalla ricerca della verità.En: Together, they formed an unlikely but strong friendship, born from a painting and the search for truth.

Earlier this spring, the 60th edition of the Venice Biennale opened, curated by the highly esteemed Brazilian curator Adriano Pedrosa. His exhibition “Foreigners Everywhere” is a major feat, and a big talking point of the year. It features more than 330 artists, many of whom are participating in the biennale for the first time, and shines a light on artists who were woefully overlooked in their time. There are multiple ways to look at the show and its title “Foreigners Everywhere,” which is inspired by a famous work of the same name by artist collective Claire Fontaine. It is both an acknowledgement of the artistic positions of exile of the immigrant or outsider, but also importantly asks of the audience to think about who exactly is a foreigner… and who is not. Pedrosa argues that deep down we are all foreigners, and this exhibition, which the curator describes as a “provocation,” arrives as the world is facing a multitude of emergencies centered around the very concepts of exile and belonging. The reviews are in and well-worth reading; Artnet's critic Ben Davis has a great three-part review of the show, and host Kate Brown spoke to Pedrosa before the exhibition opening in a wide-ranging interview that we're revisiting this week. He offers tips on how to walk through the show, key background on the exhibition's concept, and thoughts on how his show is repaying a debt.\n\nCM Hausswolff: Immersion at the Junction of Electronics & Nature 32 \"I was thinking about immersion & that word – when you become engulfed with something, when you sink into something & you feel that you are a part of something.\" Carl Michael von Hausswolff [also known CM Hausswolff & personally known as Mickey] was born in Sweden in 1956. He's unusual in that he readily admits he is a NONmusician musician, untrained in any instrument, but still able to make music with available electronic gadgets. He is both a soundsmith & visual artist, working intuitively in the area of where sound meets light. He uses recording devices such as the video camera, tape deck, radar, sonar. He investigates electrical currents and frequencies & how these relate to architectural space. His electronic voice phenomenon [EVP] recordings, proposes conjuring up voices of the dead through radio signals much like Moriconi proposed. His work has appeared at prestigious platforms & festivals such as Manifesta, documenta, the Venice Biennale, & many others. His list of audio and visual work is long, esoteric and intriguing with provocative titles like \"800 000 Seconds in Harar,\" \"The Wonderful World of Male Intuition,\" & \"There Are No Crows Flying Around the Hancock Building.” He is also a curator and, if that isn't enough, he is King Michael l, one of several Kings of Elgaland-Vargaland. This conceptual or conjectural nation, co-created with Swedish artist, Leif Ellgren is a state of mind, an art project – that covers a great deal of territory. Although they first met in the late-70s, they came to know each other in the 1990s, when Charlie was based in Copenhagen for a time. They met in Gothenberg at Radium, an art gallery at the time. It would later evolve into a magazine, an independent record label establish in 1983, an organization that presented a film festival, a computer music festival, screenings, and exhibitions & also had their own recording & video editing studio, which paralleled the work Charlie was doing in New York with the New Wilderness Foundation established in the Ear Inn where they hade their own studio, cassette label & magazine.

The multidisciplinary artist who works between film, installation, drawing, painting, sculpture, and even theater, is a world-builder of surreal and sometimes horrific proportions. Her works lodge themselves deep into your psyche with an unsettling amount of imagery, dark humor, and mythologically tinted storylines where animals may become nefarious protagonists, and roadkill might come back to life. Simnett often deals with the body as a site of pain, control, vulnerability, and intervention. And her artworks may make you squirm or even evoke fear, and you may just find yourself wondering, 'am I supposed to be watching this?' I think the answer is yes. While Simnett's boundary-pushing art may not be for the faint of heart, as viewers it is important to be challenged, roused out of our complacency and our comfort zones, it is one way to become more empathetic. Simnett has been showing widely at institutions on both sides of the Atlantic. Her film, The Severed Tail, was a major talking point at the 59th Venice Biennale, \"The Milk of Dreams.\" It tells the tale of a little pig who enters a fetishistic underworld after a farmer snips off her tail. This coming fall Simnett will be included in Manifesta 15 in Barcelona. Currently, the artist has a solo exhibition on view at the Hamburger Bahnhof in Berlin. Called Winner, it is part of the official cultural program for the Euro 2024 Soccer Championship, which is being hosted in Germany this year. In this multi-channel video installation Simnett takes on the world's and rituals of soccer, its fouls, injuries, social dynamics, and hooliganism. I won't spoil it for you, but it is definitely soccer like you've never seen it before. On top of all that talent and accolades, Simnett is also a classically trained flutist. It's an instrument that I find compliments her wider art practice perfectly—its fantastical, folkish, a bit eerie, and definitely other-worldly. On this episode of the Art Angle, Senior Editor Kate Brown speaks to Simnett, who also obliged us by playing the flute at the top of the episode. All audio excerpts in this episode are included courtesy of Marianna Simnett.\n\nEpisode No. 658 features artists Jes Fan and Emilio Rojas. Fan's work is included in two ongoing -ennials: the 2024 Whitney Biennial, which is at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York through August 11; and Greater Toronto Art 2024 at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Toronto through July 28. The Whitney exhibition was curated by Chrissie Iles and Meg Onli with Min Sun Jeon and Beatriz Cifuentes; GTA 2024 was organized by Ebony L. Haynes, Toleen Touq, and Kate Wong. Fan's sculptures consider the constructs of race and gender and their relationship to the intersection of biology and identity. As part of his explorations, Fan often incorporates living matter, such hormones, and fluids, such as glass, into his work. Fan's work has been exhibited at the 2022 Venice Biennale, the 2021 New Museum Triennial at the New Museum, New York, the MIT List Visual Arts Center, the Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati, and more. As mentioned on the program: Stills from Fan's 2023 video Palimpsest. Byung-Chul Han's book Saving Beauty. Rojas is included in \"Descending the Staircase\" at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago. The exhibition, presented across two floors of the MCA, presents ways in which artist have represented the human body. Curated by Jadine Collingwood and Jack Schneider, it is on view through August 25. Rojas works across disciplines to investigate and reveal sites of knowledge that are rich with historical narrative. His work often specifically addresses colonial histories, and the relationships between those histories and the present. Rojas' work has been exhibited at museums such as the Art Institute of Chicago and Museo Tamayo, Mexico City, and he has participated in festivals and biennials in the US, Europe, and in Asia. As mentioned on the program: Rojas' GO BACK TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM (Santa Maria); The Columbian half dollar coined for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.

To Be Blindly Hopeful emerged from the very last sentence of a journal that Paul Maheke kept between August 2020 and June 2021, capturing the turbulence of the COVID pandemic. Central to Maheke's practice is a delicate dance between the individual and the collective, personal and broader sociopolitical contexts, echoing the sentiment expressed by bell hooks, who reminds us that ‘the space of our lack is also the space of possibility.' Currently based in France, Paul shares works 'staged' in previous exhibitions at South London Gallery, Chisenhale Gallery, and Tate Modern, highlighting how the ‘new' drawings, prints, book illustrations, and paintings on display here have long formed part of his practice. He explains how performance and dance can be both emancipatory and trapping, with respect to queerness, masculinity and gender, and the reality of being ‘brown body looked at my white audience' - drawing on his lifelong admiration for the French-born ice skater, Surya Bonaly. We discuss Paul's popular culture and academic Influences like Grace Jones and Félix González-Torres, Audre Lorde and Édouard Glissant, and Bruce Nauman to Paul B. Preciado - not as icons but real, complex people. Finally, Paul highlights how his work changes in its global travels, from the Baltic Triennale in Estonia, to Johanneburg, South Africa - and, drawing on collaborations with family members and fellow artist Melika Ngombe Kolongo (Nkisi) for the Congo Biennale in 2021, his personal relationship with arts institutions on the continent, as a diasporic artist. ⁠Paul Maheke: To Be Blindly Hopeful⁠ runs at MOSTYN, Wales until 29 June 2024. It includes Taboo Durag (2021), produced as a performance to camera for ⁠Glasgow International⁠ 2021. This episode marks this iteration of Scotland's biennale festival of contemporary art, which continues until 23 June 2024.** Paul has also shown work as part of the ⁠Diaspora Pavilion at the 58th Venice Biennale in 2019⁠, the first to feature an official performance programme co-produced with the Delfina Foundation, and has work in the ⁠Drawing Biennal 2024⁠, which runs at the Drawing Room in London until 3 July 2024.

Born in Croydon and educated at Goldsmiths, where she was among the stars of the 1990s British art scene Taylor Johnson made her name with her non-narrative films, such as Method in Madness, where a young man appears to be having a nervous breakdown on camera; Hysteria of a young woman miming in hysterical laughter; or Breach of a girl who cries in silence – art that seems to be about our shared internal pain, and the performance we all put on in our everyday lives. In 1997, she won Most Promising Artist at the Venice Biennale, and in 1998 was up for the Turner Prize. Sadly, cancer took over at aged 30, an experience that no doubt shifted the output of work in the early 2000s. Still Life was a film that showed decaying fruit, and others explored the threshold between life and death, fantasy and reality, and what it meant to confront our own mortality. She has especially looked at the real lives of celebrities, from an almost mythic lens, such as her film David, of David Beckham sleeping at the National Portrait Gallery – that I remember seeing aged 10 – and her incredibly moving series of famous male actors crying, from Philip Seymour Hoffman to Robin Williams – that is currently on view at the V&A's Fragile Beauty exhibition, a phrase that so perfectly sums up so much of Taylor Johnson's work, the complexity of performance and artifice, and the glamour and beauty of pop often masked by darkness. Since 2009, she has become one of Britain's foremost movie directors, making her feature debut with Nowhere Boy, a portrait of the early life of John Lennon, and most recently, Back to Black, that zooms in on Amy Winehouse fragile but enormously celebrated life, showing her as the human she was, who loved most in the world people and music… I can't help but see the correlation between Taylor Johnson's fine art work and her movie work: that deep interest in intense stories that appear on the outer side as one, and on the inner as another. She gets to the core of the human condition through her work, and leaves us contemplating our own existence, how we view those whose music, voice and lyrics we know like they're in the DNA of our fingertips, and I really couldn't be more excited to find out more. -- LINKS: Back to Black: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21261712/ Nowhere Boy: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1266029/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_nowhere%2520boy A Million Little Pieces: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427543/ Fragile Beauty at V&A: https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/fragile-beauty-photographs-from-the-sir-elton-john-and-david-furnish-collection Crying Men series: https://hickeyguy.wordpress.com/2014/09/13/crying-men/ JFK photograph by Gary Winogrand: https://www.moma.org/collection/works/113229 David @ NPG: https://www.npg.org.uk/beyond/exhibitions/partnership/2019/coming-home-david-beckham -- THIS EPISODE IS GENEROUSLY SUPPORTED BY THE LEVETT COLLECTION: https://www.famm.com/en/ https://www.instagram.com/famm.mougins // https://www.merrellpublishers.com/9781858947037 Follow us: Katy Hessel: @thegreatwomenartists / @katy.hessel Sound editing by Nada Smiljanic Music by Ben Wetherfield\n\nFred Wilson's artistic output includes painting, sculpture, photography, and collage, among other media. But his 1992 work “Mining the Museum” at the Maryland Historical Society used the museum's own collection as its material, radically reframing how American institutions present their art. Wilson went on to represent the United States at the 2003 Venice Biennale. For that exhibition, Wilson commissioned a black glass chandelier from the famed Venice glassmakers on the island of Murano. Wilson titled the piece “Speak of me as I am,” after the line from Shakespeare's tragic Venetian, Othello. In the years since then, Wilson has made several other pieces that engage with Othello, many of them made from the same evocative black Murano glass. In a new installation piece commissioned by the Folger, Wilson brings together two sides of his artistic practice: institutional critique and glass sculpture. It's titled “God me such uses send, Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend”—another line from Othello, this one spoken by Desdemona. The installation includes a massive black-glass mirror, ornately etched and filigreed. Visitors see themselves reflected in the mirror, along with a portrait of Queen Elizabeth that hangs opposite the mirror in the gallery. On another wall hangs an engraving of the actor Ira Aldridge in the role of Othello, alongside lines from the play written out in Aldridge's own hand. The piece brings together questions of identity, belonging, erasure, and representation—and lets those facets reflect and refract one another, without easy answers. On this episode, Wilson discusses the piece with host Barbara Bogaev. Fred Wilson's installation, “God me such uses send, Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend,” will welcome visitors to the Shakespeare Exhibition Hall when the Folger reopens on June 21.

Transforming everyday materials into objects that address issues surrounding identity, sexuality and human rights, the artist fled her native Uganda to New York in 2015 after being publicly outed in a local newspaper. In spring 2018 Babirye was granted asylum with support from the African Services Committee and the NYC Anti-Violence Project.Composed of debris collected from the streets of New York, Babirye's sculptures are woven, whittled, welded, burned and burnished. Her choice to use discarded materials in her work is intentional – the pejorative term for a gay person in the Luganda language is ‘abasiyazi', meaning sugarcane husk. “It's rubbish,” explains Babirye, “the part of the sugarcane you throw out.” The artist also frequently uses traditional African masks to explore the diversity of LGBTQI identities, assembling them from ceramics, metal and hand-carved wood; lustrous, painterly glazes are juxtaposed with chiselled, roughly-textured woodwork and metal objects associated with the art of blacksmithing. In a similar vein, Babirye creates loosely rendered portraits in vivid colours of members from her community. Describing her practice, Babirye explains: “Through the act of burning, nailing and assembling, I aim to address the realities of being gay in the context of Uganda and Africa in general. Recently, my working process has been fuelled by a need to find a language to respond to the recent passing of the anti-homosexuality bill in Uganda.”For her Yorkshire Sculpture Park solo, Babirye spent the summer of 2023 at YSP making a clan of seven larger-than-life-size figures in wood and five coloured ceramics. Supported by YSP's technical team, the seven sculptures were carved using a chainsaw and chisels from trees that had reached the end of their life on site. The artist describes being guided by the wood itself, sketching the initial forms directly onto the sectioned tree for carving. Once carved, the figures are refined and their surfaces sanded to highlight the grains of the tree. The sculptures are then burned a deep black, the charring once used to make the works ‘disappear' but which is now a gesture of celebrating their beauty. Details of the sculptures are treated with a blowtorch before the surfaces are carefully waxed to acknowledge the skin of the piece and the tree from which it came. The final stage is one Babirye calls ‘taking the girls to the salon', in which found elements complete the sculptures, including bicycle chains, nails and copper from a dismantled boiler, as well as redundant stainless steel teapots.Follow @BabiryeSculptor and @YSPsculptureVisit: https://ysp.org.uk/profile/leilah-babirye Leilah Babirye: Obumu (Unity) runs at Yorkshire Sculpture Park until Sunday 8th September 2024.https://ysp.org.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/leilah-babirye-obumu-unityHer work is also part of the Venice Biennale 2024Thanks to YSP, Stephen Friedman Gallery and Gordon Robichaux.

Every two years, different countries compete for the attention of art lovers and judges with individual national pavilions. For the 2024 Biennale, among the most talked about is that of the United States, which chose Jeffrey Gibson as its representative artist. Gibson is one of the most visible artists currently working, and with his Cherokee and Choctaw heritage, he is also the first Native American to represent the U.S. in Venice. Representing your country at the Biennale is among the highest honors that any artist might receive, and also among the most fraught. Even from this show's title, which is \"The Space in Which to Place Me,\" you can tell that Gibson is pondering what national representation means. Gibson has transformed the U.S. pavilion's brick exterior with prismatic murals. Inside you find a spectacle that is clearly the work of vast amounts of team labor. There are 10-foot-high figures with ceramic faces draped in beads, ribbons, and large fringe; sculptures of large birds and human busts meticulously decked out in detailed rainbow bead work. Vibrant paintings that incorporate artifacts by unknown indigenous makers were sourced from estate and garage sales. Meanwhile, a bright red central chamber contains one of the types of work that has become Jeffrey Gibson's signature, a punching bag that he has transformed via intricate bead work into a hanging sculpture, this one featuring the vaunted phrase, \"we hold these truths to be self-evident.\" Whether that line refers to the truths of the Declaration of Independence that it is citing, or to the truths of the other art that surrounds it, you have to decide for yourself. Gibson's pavilion climaxes with a nine screen video installation featuring a dancer performing a traditional Ojibwe powwow dance to a techno beat, the images ultimately breaking apart into kaleidoscopic abstraction in its mix of historical references and pop, and above all, in its color and warmth. \"The Space in Which to Place Me\" is a fine introduction to the themes that define Jeffrey Gibson's career. In the lead up to the opening, host Ben Davis spoke with him about his long road to the Venice Biennale.\n\nIt is time for another edition of the Art Angle Roundup, where we look at some of the biggest headlining stories of the past month. But really, let's be honest, in the art world there's just one headlining story, and that is the 60th edition of the Venice Biennale, the so-called \"Olympics of the Art World,\" which opened to the public last Saturday, April 20. Brazilian curator Adriano Pedrosa's \"Foreigners Everywhere\" was a major feat, and it brought together more than 330 artists and collectives, the vast majority of whom have not been seen at the Biennale before. So it was truly exciting. And all over Venice, there were scores of collateral shows, galleries that brought their own exhibitions, private foundations pulling their weight as well with all of their palazzos. Suffice to say, the lagoon was busy. As we know, it's a challenge to get anywhere fast in a city without cars and bikes, and it's very easy to get lost along the way, but there is, naturally, a lot of great art to see. This week, Art Angle co-hosts Kate Brown and Ben Davis are joined by acting Editor in Chief Naomi Rea, who were all together at the vernissage and are now back to remotely chatting from Berlin, New York, and London respectively. After a very busy week, a look back at what it was like on the ground in Venice, beginning with the main show curated by Pedrosa (who was a recent guest on the podcast); the protests that took place around the Biennale art week; and finally the national pavilions, the nation-state pavilions, and all of the hits, misses, and stories that came out of it.\n\nMyf and Zan are back with our recap of the week in music, art, life, and stuff and all boxes are ticked this week.

Recorded at the St Regis Library, we meet leading artist Sir John Akomfrah CBE RA and Tarini Malik, the curator of the British pavilion 2024.The British Council is delighted to present Listening All Night To The Rain by John Akomfrah at the 60th International Art Exhibition of La Biennale di Venezia 2024.The exhibition runs from 20 April to 24 November 2024.Exploring post-colonialism, environmental devastation and the politics of aesthetics, Listening All Night To The Rain is Akomfrah's boldest and most ambitious commission to date.The exhibition draws its title from 11th century Chinese writer and artist Su Dongpo's poetry, which explores the transitory nature of life during a period of political exile. Organised in a series of song-like movements, or ‘cantos', the exhibition brings together eight interlocking and overlapping multimedia and sound installations into a single and immersive environment that tells stories of migrant diasporas in Britain. It is the result of decades of extensive research by the artist and his team, using historical records to contextualise our experience of the present day.Listening All Night To The Rain weaves together newly filmed material, archive video footage and still images, with audio and text from international archives and libraries. The exhibition tells global stories through the ‘memories' of people who represent migrant communities in Britain and examines how multiple geopolitical narratives are reflected in the experiences of diasporic people more broadly.Each gallery space layers together a specific colour field, influenced by the paintings of American artist Mark Rothko, in order to highlight the ways in which abstraction can represent the fundamental nature of human drama.Listening All Night To The Rain positions various theories of acoustemology: the study of how the sonic experience mirrors and shapes our cultural realities. Akomfrah draws on an acute acoustic sensitivity influenced by a variety of formative experiences, from protests to club culture in 1970s-80s London. Each of Akomfrah's ‘cantos' is accompanied by a specific soundtrack, which layers archival material with field recordings, speeches and popular and devotional music. Extending the sense of hybridity in the filmic collages, Akomfrah's use of sound encourages us to consider the breadth of cultural identity in Britain more broadly.Follow @Smoking_Dog_Films, @AkomfrahJohn @TariniMalik, @BritishArts Presented by @BurberryThanks @Lisson_Gallery and @LaBiennaleLearn more at Lisson: https://www.lissongallery.com/artists/john-akomfrah Hosted on Acast.

The Brazilian curator Adriano Pedrosa is at the helm of the prestigious group exhibition, which is now in its 60th edition, and his show includes more than 300 artists and collectives presented in the historic Arsenale and the Central Pavilion in the Giardini. Many of these artists, who are largely based or from the global South, are on view for the first time in these revered spaces. There are multiple ways to look at the show and its title \"Foreigners Everywhere,\" which is inspired by a famous work of the same name by artist collective Claire Fontaine. It is both an acknowledgement of the artistic positions of exile of the immigrant or outsider, but also importantly asks of the audience to think about who exactly is a foreigner... and who is not. Pedrosa argues that deep down we are all foreigners, and this exhibition, which the curator describes as a \"provocation,\" arrives as the world is facing a multitude of emergencies centered around the very concepts of exile and belonging. Just as everything was coming together over the last weeks ahead of the April vernissage, Artnet's Kate Brown spoke to Pedrosa about what visitors can expect from \"Foreigners Everywhere\" and his overarching vision for the show. He shared his views on how one should navigate an exhibition of this scale, and discusses his background as a curator in São Paulo, which included organizing pioneering exhibitions of marginalized perspectives and histories during Jair Bolsonaro's populist reign in Brazil. The two also speak about Pedrosa's understanding of what it means to be a foreigner from both a political and artistic perspective."
