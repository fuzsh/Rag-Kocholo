The rapid development of control technology has an impact on all areas of the control discipline. New theory, new controllers, actuators, sensors, new industrial processes, computer methods, new applications, new philosophies, . . . , new challenges. Much of this development work resides in industrial reports, feasibility study papers and the reports of advanced collaborative projects. The series offers an opportunity for researchers to present an extended exposition of such new work in all aspects of industrial control for wider and rapid dissemination. Concerns about energy independence, CO2 emissions and climate change and the engineering risks associated with nuclear power stations have all contributed to the political push to prioritise the exploitation of renewable energy resources in the developed nations. Key technologies in the renewable energy field for electrical power generation that can be considered commercially mature include hydro-power, tidal power, biomass digester technology and the use of wind turbines and the development of large-scale wind farms. A technological field that is now finding wider terrestrial application is that of solar energy systems where an installation uses the Sun’s radiant energy as the “fuel” of the system. Roof-top solar panels are a common sight in small-scale systems for domestic water and space heating, but what of industrial-scale solar energy systems? Progress on developing such systems and their control can be found in this very timely Advances in Industrial Control monograph, Control of Solar Energy Systems by Eduardo F. Camacho, Manuel Berenguel, Francisco R. Rubio and Diego Martínez. Given the very many specialised and small-scale applications of solar energy collectors, it cannot be stressed too strongly that the plants and installations described in this monograph are proposed for industrial-scale operation. Just as wind turbines have grown in size and have been integrated in large-scale wind farms to enable the generation of usefully significant amounts of electrical power, so too will the basic mechanisms of solar energy capture need to be developed to industrial dimensions to ensure a significant contribution. In this monograph, we learn that there are really two candidate solar energy capture principles. The first of these uses photovoltaics to generate a voltage directly, vii\n\nviii\n\nSeries Editors’ Foreword\n\nand the second uses a solar thermal collector to capture the Sun’s radiant energy using one or other of two main process architectures; either a heat transfer fluid (HTF) is taken to the vicinity of the locally focused radiant energy as in the parabolic trough, or the Sun’s radiant energy is focused globally as in a central (tower) receiver system. This simple framework of concepts provides the structure of the monograph. Consequently, Chaps. 1 and 2 present the solar energy basics and some specific control fundamentals for solar energy systems. Chapter 3 looks at the control of photovoltaic plants, while Chaps. 4 and 5 focus on the control and the advanced control of parabolic trough systems. Chapter 6 examines central receiver systems with other possible systems and potential applications of solar energy (primarily as a furnace or for refrigeration) collected and described in Chap. 7. Finally, the critical topic of integrating these plants and installations into a larger-scale market-based network is considered in Chap. 8. This involves the control of plants with a diurnal operational characteristic or a highly variable generation profile and considers the issue of global plant control, so it is not surprising that upper-level supervisory process control makes an appearance in this chapter. The authors state quite early in the monograph “. . .the integration of solar energy plants in the electrical grid is a challenging problem”; in fact, it is a problem for many of the renewable energy systems, but one where the field of control systems theory and practice is capable of making significant contributions. The monograph is a valuable compendium of process knowledge for the control of the various solar energy systems and can function as a reference book for those interested in learning more about these systems; it is especially valuable for the control research and engineering community working in the solar energy system field. Control researchers and students might note that although a wide range of advanced control solutions are studied in Chap. 5, there remains an obvious need for a common case study problem prescription to benchmark the different control schemes proposed. The monograph has the valuable attribute of describing many real plant installations and applications. These installations provided the test-beds for many of the control solutions described and results from control trials appear frequently in the monograph to amplify simulation results and to illustrate realworld implementations. In 1997, the Advances in Industrial Control series published the first monograph, entitled Advanced Control of Solar Plants (978-3-540-76144-6) by the authors Eduardo F. Camacho, Manuel Berenguel, and Francisco R. Rubio. In the intervening years, the subject has matured and developed further. This new monograph shows how the authors and the control community are continuing to make a significant and substantial contribution to the control engineering involved in solar energy systems. Industrial Control Centre Glasgow, Scotland, UK\n\nM.J. Grimble M.A. Johnson\n\nPreface\n\nDuring the last 30 years, considerable research effort has been devoted to improve the efficiency of solar power plants from the control and optimization viewpoint. This book presents techniques to model and control solar energy systems. The book contains results obtained in several solar plants located at the Plataforma Solar de Almería (PSA), South-East Spain, which is the largest European center for research, development and testing of concentrating solar technologies. The book is mainly aimed at practitioners, both from the solar energy community and the control engineering community, although it can be followed by a wide range of readers, as only basic knowledge of control theory and sampled data systems is required. The book is organized as follows: Chap. 1 gives a brief introduction to solar energy fundamentals, including solar radiation related concepts and a classification of solar thermal technologies and energy storage systems. Chapter 2 presents control issues in solar systems, where the main Sun tracking mechanisms are studied, a brief overview of solar radiation estimation and forecast techniques is included, the control of fundamental variables is explained, as well as how the integrated control of solar energy systems should be addressed. Chapter 3 briefly introduces the photovoltaic plants, focused on automatic tracking strategies. Chapter 4 explains the basic modeling and control approaches related to thermal solar plants with parabolic trough distributed collectors. After reviewing different modeling approaches for these kinds of system, the basic control algorithms are explained, highlighting their main advantages and drawbacks: feedforward control, PID control and cascade control. In Chap. 5, parabolic troughs advanced control techniques are developed, covering a wide range of control schemes that have been tested at the PSA following a classification of these techniques. Some of these strategies are adaptive control, model-based predictive control, nonlinear control, fuzzy logic control and so on. Chapter 6 deals with the control of power towers with central receiver systems. After explaining the main control issues of these kinds of plant, including a general description of the control system, and types of receiver and model, both the heliostat field control and aiming strategies are explained, including basic control approaches. Chapter 7 briefly explains the main control issues related to other ix\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\ninteresting solar energy applications, such as solar furnaces and solar refrigeration systems. Finally, Chap. 8 presents recent approaches to the integrated control of solar systems. The text is composed of material collected from articles written by the authors, technical reports and lectures given to graduate students. Seville, Almería Spain\n\nE.F. Camacho M. Berenguel F.R.

as solar energy, experienced a great impulse during the second half of the 1970s just after the first big oil crisis. At that time, economic issues were the most important factor and so interest in these types of process decreased when oil prices fell. There is renewed interest in the use of renewable energies nowadays, driven by the need of reducing the high environmental impact produced by the use of fossil energy systems. As pointed out in [369], renewable spending has increased 30% in 2010 to a total of $243 billion. Nine-tenth of that is in the G-20 advanced industrial countries. The European region was the leading recipient of clean energy finance. Next comes Asia, while the Americas region is distant third in the race for clean energy investment. Globally, the solar sector grew fastest in 2010, attracting 53% more investment than the year before. Wind investment, in second place, grew 34%. Altogether, clean energy generating technology has doubled in the period 2008–2010 and now exceeds total global nuclear capacity. In terms of actual electricity produced, green energy still is only about a third or fourth of nuclear, but the progress in renewables is impressive indeed [369]. Global energy demand is about 16 TW approximately and is expected to double in the next twenty years. While increased energy production via traditional methods together with improved efficiency and conservation may alleviate some of the needs, such measures by themselves cannot meet the expected demand in the long run. The most abundant, sustainable source of energy is the Sun, which provides over 150000 TW of power to the Earth; about half of this energy reaches the Earth’s surface while the other half gets reflected to outer space by the atmosphere (Fig. 1.1). Only a small fraction of the available solar energy reaching the Earth’s surface would be enough to satisfy the global energy demand expected. Although most renewable energies derive their energy from the Sun, by solar energy we refer to the direct use of solar radiation. One of the greatest scientific and technological opportunities facing us today is to develop efficient ways to collect, convert, store and utilize solar energy at affordable costs. However, there are two main drawbacks E.F. Camacho et al., Control of Solar Energy Systems, Advances in Industrial Control, DOI 10.1007/978-0-85729-916-1_1, © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2012\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\nSolar Energy Fundamentals\n\nFig. 1.1 Earth’s energy budget (eosweb.larc.nasa.gov)\n\nof solar energy systems: (i) the resulting energy costs are not yet competitive and (ii) solar energy is not always available when needed [89]. Considerable research efforts are being devoted to techniques which may help to overcome these drawbacks; control is one of these techniques. While in other power generating processes the main source of energy (the fuel) can be manipulated as the main control variable, in solar energy systems the main source of power, solar radiation, cannot be manipulated [85] and, furthermore, it changes in a seasonal and on a daily basis acting as a disturbance when considered from a control point of view. Solar plants have all the characteristics needed to use advanced control strategies able to cope with changing dynamics, non-linearities and uncertainties. The use of efficient control strategies resulting in better responses would increase the number of operational hours of solar plants and thus reduce the cost per kWh produced. This chapter briefly describes solar radiation fundamentals, the main ways of collecting solar energy and related technologies, and a description of the solar plants of the Plataforma Solar de Almería (PSA, South-East Spain) that are used as test-bed plants throughout the text.\n\n1.2 Solar Radiation The Earth receives most of its energy from the Sun in the form of solar electromagnetic radiation. The Sun contains 99.9% of the total mass of the solar system. The average density of the Sun is surprisingly low (1.4 g/cm3 ), the reason being that it\n\n1.2 Solar Radiation\n\n3\n\nis mostly composed of the lightest elements, hydrogen (70% by mass) and helium (27% by mass). The Sun’s core is mostly composed of helium (65% by mass) while the hydrogen is reduced to 35% by mass because of being consumed in fusion reactions. Most of the other renewable sources of energy, such as wind energy, wave energy and bio-fuels depend on the Sun’s energy. Furthermore, some of the nonrenewable energy sources such as fossil fuels were originated by solar energy in the past. Solar energy originates from nuclear fusion reactions occurring at the core of the Sun where hydrogen atoms are fused into helium. The gravity at the core creates an intense pressure, which is high enough to force the fusion of hydrogen atoms. About 700 million tons per second of hydrogen is converted into helium. About half of the hydrogen found at the Sun’s core has already been converted into helium. The remaining life expectation of the Sun is 5 billion years. The fusion reaction creates immense heat giving rise to temperatures at the core close to 15 million degrees Celsius (°C). At those temperatures, photons are emitted from the atoms and travel a very short distance before being absorbed by another atom causing the neighboring atom to heat and the subsequent emission of another photon. It takes a photon around 100000 years to reach the surface and about 8 minutes to travel the 149.5 million kilometers separating the Sun from the Earth. The rate at which solar energy reaches a unit area at the Earth is called the solar irradiance or insolation and is measured in W/m2 . The integral of the solar irradiance during a period of time is called solar radiation or irradiation and is measured in J/m2 . Very frequently, solar irradiance is also denominated as solar radiation using the same units (W/m2 ). The total power emitted by the Sun’s surface is about 63 MW/m2 . The photosphere has an average temperature of about 5800 K and delivers radiation with a spectrum similar to the spectrum of radiation emitted by a black body at 5800 K; most of the energy is emitted in the visible (450–700 nm) bands. A significant portion of solar energy is emitted in the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) and smaller quantities of energy are transmitted on radio, microwave, X-ray and gamma ray bands. Solar radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere, soil and oceans. Wind and waves come from solar energy. A small portion of solar energy is transformed to kinetic energy of winds used by wind power systems. Wind also causes wave and currents which are used by waves or current generators. Some of the solar energy is transformed by plants into biomass by photosynthesis, this is ultimately converted into heat energy by oxidation. The remaining part of the biomass produces organic sediments which will be transformed into fossil fuels in the future. The Earth’s disk intercepts solar radiation with an area πR 2 ; where R is the radius of the Earth. For a thermal equilibrium, the absorption of solar radiation must be equal to the energy emitted from the Earth to space. When the solar radiation hits the atmosphere, part of it is reflected, another part is scattered or absorbed by the air. The radiation that reaches the surface directly and is not absorbed, reflected or scattered, is called direct solar radiation. The reflected and scattered radiation reaching the ground is called diffuse radiation. The albedo factor is defined as the\n\n4\n\n1\n\nSolar Energy Fundamentals\n\nFig. 1.2 The divergence of energy from the Sun to the Earth, [359]\n\nfraction of radiation reaching the ground that is reflected back to the atmosphere. The power of direct solar irradiance on a clear day can be around 1 kW/m2 .\n\n1.2.1 Solar Constant The radiation intensity on the surface of the Sun is approximately 6.33 · 107 W/m2 . Since radiation spreads out as the distance squared, by the time it travels to the Earth (1496 · 1011 m or 1 AU is the average Earth–Sun distance, D0 ), the radiant energy falling on 1 m2 of surface area is reduced to 1367 W as depicted in Fig. 1.2 [359]. The intensity of the radiation leaving the Sun is relatively constant. Therefore, the intensity of solar radiation at a distance of 1 AU is called the solar constant Ec and has a currently accepted value of 1367 W/m2 [359].\n\n1.2.2 Extraterrestrial Solar Irradiance As the Earth’s orbit is elliptical, the intensity of solar radiation received outside the Earth’s atmosphere varies as the square of the Earth–Sun distance D. The solar irradiance variation can be approximated by [359] 360Nd Eext = Ec 1 + 0.034 cos (1.1) W/m2 365.25 where Eext is the extraterrestrial solar irradiance outside the Earth’s atmosphere and Nd is the day number (starting at January 1st). The extraterrestrial solar irradiance falling on a surface parallel to the ground (Fig. 1.3) is [359] Eext,h = Eext cos(θz )\n\n(1.2)\n\n1.2 Solar Radiation\n\n5\n\nFig. 1.3 The cosine effect as it relates to the concept of extraterrestrial horizontal irradiance, [359]\n\nwhere θz the angle between the two surfaces, which is the solar zenith angle. Reduction of radiation by the cosine of the angle between the solar radiation and a surface normal is called the cosine effect. Because of the cosine effect, the extraterrestrial solar irradiance on a horizontal plane varies cyclically as the Earth spins on its axis. The amount of solar radiation received on a horizontal surface outside the atmosphere forms an upper limit to the amount of radiation that will fall on a horizontal surface below the Earth’s atmosphere. It also describes the cosine effect without the complication of air mass and cloud cover [359].\n\n1.2.3 Measurement of Solar Irradiance Pyranometers are the sensors used to measure global solar irradiance, that is, the Sun’s energy coming from all directions in the hemisphere above the plane of the instrument. The measurement is of the sum of the direct and the diffuse solar irradiance. To measure the direct normal component of the solar irradiance only, an instrument called a normal incidence pyrheliometer (NIP), or simply pyrheliometer is used. The diffuse irradiance can be measured by modifying a pyranometer using a shadowing device large enough to block the direct irradiance onto this sensor. The description of different pyranometers and pyrheliometers can be found in [359].\n\n1.2.4 The Sun’s Position Along with the weather conditions, another factor that determines the amount of incident radiation on a solar collector is the apparent movement of the Sun across\n\n6\n\n1\n\nSolar Energy Fundamentals\n\nFig. 1.4 Movement of the Earth’s rotation around the Sun\n\nthe sky during the day. The Earth’s orbit around the Sun has an elliptical trajectory, with 3% eccentricity. The imaginary line that represents the orbit described by the Earth is called the ecliptic. As it orbits, the axis of terrestrial rotation always forms the same 23.45° angle between the perpendicular and the ecliptic plane. The angle formed by the ecliptic plane and the equator varies during the year as shown in Fig. 1.4. This angle, known as the declination, varies from −23.45° on the winter solstice to 23.45° on the summer solstice. The Tropic of Cancer (23.45° north) and the Tropic of Capricorn (23.45° south) are the farthest latitudes at which the Sun is located on the perpendicular to the horizon one instant per year, at noon on the summer and winter solstices, respectively.\n\n1.2.5 Geometry of the Sun’s Movement From the point of view of an observer on the Earth’s surface, the Sun seems to describe an arc from sunrise to sunset. The local meridian plane by definition is located in the middle of this path at solar noon. The vertical direction of the observer’s position on the Earth’s surface intersects the sky vault at a point called the zenith. The Earth’s axis forms an angle equal to the latitude of the location (φ) with the observer’s horizontal plane. The latitude angle φ is the angle between a line drawn from a point on the Earth’s surface to the center of the Earth and the Earth’s equatorial plane. The intersection of the equatorial plane with the surface of the Earth forms the equator and is designated as 0° latitude. The Earth’s axis of rotation intersects the Earth’s surface at 90° latitude (North Pole) and −90° latitude (South Pole). Any location on the surface of the Earth then can be defined by the intersection of a longitude angle and a latitude angle. The Sun position may be referred to by two systems of coordinates centered on the observer, according to the system of reference selected: time coordinates\n\n1.2 Solar Radiation\n\n7\n\nFig. 1.5 Time celestial coordinates\n\n(δs : declination, ωs : solar hour) and horizontal coordinates (hs : solar elevation, as : azimuth). These coordinates determine the solar vector, understood as a vector going from the observer to the Sun. Figure 1.5 shows the time coordinates, where: • δs is the solar declination [°]: Sun position angle with the terrestrial equatorial plane at solar noon. • ωs is the solar hour angle [°]: angular movement of the Sun on the plane of the solar trajectory. The origin of the hour angle is taken as solar noon and widens in the direction of movement of the Sun. Each hour is equal to 15°. Figure 1.6 shows the horizontal coordinates, where: • hs is the solar elevation [°]: angle formed by the direct solar radiation and the horizontal plane. The complementary angle is the solar zenith angle θz . • as is the solar azimuth [°]: angle formed by the direct solar radiation and the observer meridian. The origin of the azimuth is solar noon and is widens clockwise facing north from south of the location (in the northern hemisphere).\n\n1.2.5.1 Calculating the Time Coordinates The horizontal coordinates of the Sun vary depending on the time of day, day of year and latitude of the location. On the contrary, the time coordinates are easier to find, as the declination depends only on the day of the year and the hour angle at the time. The time coordinates are determined as a preliminary step for calculating the horizontal coordinates. Most solar calculations require solar time but our clocks\n\n8\n\n1\n\nSolar Energy Fundamentals\n\nFig. 1.6 Horizontal celestial coordinates\n\nshow the local time. There is a convention for using time, setting the civilian time in different cities with different solar times. The solar time (ts ) is calculated by ts = local standard time + 4(Lref − Lloc ) + Δt\n\n[min]\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere Lref is the geographic longitude of the reference meridian [°] and Lloc the longitude of the local meridian [°]. A second correction is necessary because the Sun gets ahead of or behind the mean solar time. This equation is known as the equation of time: Δt = 9.87 sin2 (B) − 7.52 cos(B) − 1.5 sin(B) [min]\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhere B = 360(J − 81)/364 [°] and J the Julian day of the year. The equation of time is the difference between the local apparent solar time and the local mean solar time. There exist different approximations with different degrees of error [359]. When the solar time is known, the hour angle is calculated recalling that the origin of the coordinates is at the local meridian and that one solar hour is 15°. ωs = 15(ts − 12) [°]\n\n(1.5)\n\nwhere ts here is the solar time in hours. The hour angle is negative in the morning and positive in the afternoon. The declination of the Sun depends on the day of the year as expressed by 284 + J δs = 23.45 sin 360 [°] (1.6) 365\n\n1.3 Technology Classification\n\n9\n\n1.2.5.2 Calculating the Horizontal Coordinates The horizontal coordinates (hs , as ) are calculated using spherical trigonometry based on the time coordinates, related by the equations sin(hs ) = sin(φ) sin(δs ) + cos(φ) cos(δs ) cos(ωs ) sin(hs ) cos(as ) = sin(φ) cos(δs ) + cos(ωs ) − cos(φ) sin(δs )\n\n(1.7)\n\nsin(hs ) sin(as ) = cos(φ) sin(ωs ) From these equations the maximum solar elevation for a determined day and latitude can be found. At noon the hour angle and the solar azimuth angle are zero, ωs = 0° and as = 0°, corresponding to the maximum elevation (hs,max ). Using these values in Eq. (1.7) gives hs,max = 90° − φ + δs\n\n[°]\n\n(1.8)\n\nIn [342], also meteorological, topographic and astronomic effects are studied.\n\n1.3 Technology Classification Solar energy has been used throughout time, mainly for heating and lighting but also for many other purposes such as refrigeration [413], detoxification [55], desalination [131, 415] and primarily for the generation of electricity. Solar powered electrical generation can be achieved either directly, by the use of photovoltaic (PV) cells, or indirectly, by collecting and concentrating solar power (CSP) to produce steam which is then used to drive a turbine to provide electrical power [139]. In [254] various advanced solar thermal electricity technologies are reviewed with an emphasis on new technology and new market approaches. Figure 1.7 shows a diagram of basic solar energy conversion systems [359], able to convert the solar resource into a useful form of energy. The function of a solar collector is to intercept the incoming solar radiation and to change it into a usable form of energy. Storage or auxiliary systems are necessary if solar energy conversion systems are not connected to an electrical transmission grid [359]. In [205] various types of solar thermal collector and of application are presented, including flat-plate, compound parabolic, evacuated tube, parabolic-trough, Fresnel lens, parabolic dish and heliostat field collectors. This is followed by an optical, thermal and thermodynamic analysis of the collectors and a description of the methods used to evaluate their performance. Regarding the applicability of the collectors, some applications are related, like solar water heating (which comprise thermosyphon, integrated collector storage, direct and indirect systems and air systems), space heating and cooling (which comprise, space heating and service hot water, air and water systems and heat pumps, refrigeration), industrial process heat (which comprise air and water systems and steam generation systems), desalination, thermal power systems (which comprise the parabolic trough, power tower and dish systems), solar furnaces and chemistry applications. As can be seen, solar energy\n\n10\n\n1\n\nSolar Energy Fundamentals\n\nFig. 1.7 Diagram of solar energy conversion systems, [359]\n\nsystems can be used for a wide range of applications and provide significant benefits. In [342] a summary of solar energy sources and conversion methods is presented. Applications of solar energy in terms of low and high temperature collectors are given with future research directions. PV devices are discussed for future electric energy generations based on solar power site-exploitation and transmission by different means over long distances such as fiber-optic cables. Another use of solar energy is its combination with water and as a consequent electrolysis analysis generation of hydrogen gas, which is expected to be another form of clean energy sources. Combination of solar energy and water for hydrogen gas production is called solarhydrogen energy. Possible future new methodologies are also mentioned in [342]. Most of the experiments described in this book have been performed at the Plataforma Solar de Almería (PSA, www.psa.es). This experimental facility belongs to the Centro de Investigaciones Energéticas Medioambientales y Tecnológicas (CIEMAT) and is the largest European center for research, development and testing of concentrating solar technologies. The PSA has two tower plants (CESA-1 and CRS), various linear focusing facilities and distributed solar collector fields (DISS and ACUREX), a solar furnace, a few solar dishes and a number of other experiments (Fig. 1.8).\n\n1.3.1 Electricity Generation 1.3.1.1 Photovoltaic Plants The direct generation of electricity from solar energy is based on the photovoltaic effect which refers to the fact that photons of light hitting certain materials will knock electrons into a higher state of energy producing an electrical current. Although the first PV cells were used to generate electrical power for spacecrafts, there are many PV power generation systems for more normal applications such as\n\n1.3 Technology Classification\n\n11\n\nFig. 1.8 Aerial view of the PSA facilities (courtesy of PSA, www.psa.es)\n\nFig. 1.9 Types of photovoltaic plant\n\nhouses isolated from the grid, pumps for water extraction, electric cars, roadside emergency telephones, remote sensing and cathodic protection of pipelines. When the power generated by the PV cells is transmitted to the grid, an inverter to convert the direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC) is required. PV cells are usually protected by a glass sheet and are connected together to form solar panels. Multiple solar panels or modules must be assembled as arrays when more power production is required. The prices of solar panels are still too high to compete with other nonrenewable fuels. However, in most places, significant financial incentives such as the feed-in tariff (FIT) have triggered a huge increase in the demand for PV panels. Photovoltaic production is the fastest-growing energy technology. It has been increasing by almost 50% percent every year. At the end of 2010, the cumulative global amount of PV installations reached 15200 MW. Figure 1.9 shows the main types of photovoltaic plant according to the selected mechanism for tracking the Sun (in Chap. 2 the Sun tracking fundamentals are studied).\n\n1.3.1.2 Thermosolar Plants/Concentrating Solar Thermal Systems Concentrating solar thermal (CST) systems use optical devices (usually mirrors) and Sun tracking systems to concentrate a large area of sunlight onto a smaller\n\n12\n\n1\n\nSolar Energy Fundamentals\n\nreceiving area. The concentrated solar energy is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant. A wide range of concentrating technologies exists. The main concentrating concepts are: (a) parabolic troughs, (b) solar dishes, (c) linear Fresnels and (d) solar power towers. The main purpose of concentrating solar energy is to produce high temperatures and, therefore, high thermodynamic efficiencies.\n\nParabolic Troughs Parabolic-trough systems are the most used CSP technology. A parabolic trough consists of a linear parabolic mirror that reflects and concentrates the received solar energy onto a tube (receiver) positioned along the focal line. The parabolic mirror follows the Sun by tracking along a single axis. The heat transfer fluid (HTF), typically synthetic oil or water, is pumped through the receiver tube and picks up the heat transferred through the receiver tube walls. Then, it is routed either to a heat exchanger when this fluid is oil, to produce steam that feeds an industrial process (for instance a turbine), to an ash tank when the fluid is pressurized water, to produce steam for an industrial process, or to a turbine when superheated and pressurized steam is produced directly in the solar field [416]. In [139] an overview of the parabolic-trough collectors that have been built and marketed during the past century, as well as the prototypes currently under development are studied. It also presents a survey of systems which could incorporate this type of concentrating solar system to supply thermal energy up to 400°C, especially steam power cycles for electricity generation, including examples of each application. In order to provide viable power production, parabolic troughs have to achieve their task despite fluctuations in energy input, i.e. solar radiation. An effective control scheme is needed to provide operating requirements of a solar power plant. Most of the plants that are for the currently operational, such as the SEGS (Solar Electricity Generating System) plants in California [304], provide this energy in the form of oil heated by a field of parabolic-trough collectors. However, the processes usually connected to such fields for electricity generation [304, 398] or sea-water desalination [415] are most efficient when operated continuously. To do this, they must be provided with a constant supply of hot oil at some pre-specified temperature despite variations in the ambient temperature, the inlet temperature and the direct solar irradiance. This requirement prompted the use of a storage tank as a buffer between solar collection and the industrial process at early plants such as the SSPS system at the PSA, Spain [398] and SEGS I in California. For this purpose, later plants (SEGS II–IX) operated a gas fired boiler running in parallel to the solar field in order to make up any shortfalls in the solar produced steam [304]. While these facilities enable the overall power output of the plant to be maintained during shortfalls, they do not remove the requirement for a fixed quality energy output from the field, in the form of tight outlet temperature control. Maintaining a constant supply of solar produced thermal energy in the face of disturbances is not the purpose of this control because it is not a cost effective strategy; in theory, oversized collector fields could be used with parts only operating\n\n1.3 Technology Classification\n\n13\n\nFig. 1.10 Parabolic troughs at the PSA (courtesy of PSA)\n\nduring periods of low solar radiation. The aim of a control scheme should rather be to regulate the outlet temperature of the collector field by suitably adjusting the oil flow rate [398]. This is beneficial in a number of ways. Firstly, it supplies any available thermal energy in a usable form, i.e., at the desired operating temperature, which improves the overall system efficiency and reduces the demands placed on auxiliary equipment such as the storage tank. Secondly, the solar field is maintained in a state of readiness for the resumption of full scale operation when the intensity of sunlight rises once again; the alternative is unnecessary shutdowns and startup procedures which are both wasteful and time consuming. Finally, if the control is good, i.e., fast and well damped, the plant can be operated close to design limits, thereby improving productivity. During the last thirty years considerable effort has been devoted by many researchers to improve the efficiency of solar thermal power plants with distributed collectors from the control and optimization viewpoints. Most of the work carried out and summarized in [85, 87, 88] (and extended in this book) has been devoted to improve the operation of the ACUREX field of the SSPS plant located in the PSA, Spain, which uses a parabolic-trough system using industrial oil as the HTF because commercial plants for electricity production [300] and the facilities available to tests automatic controllers are using this fluid. However, there are also some recent experiences of controlling parabolic-trough systems using water/steam as the HTF, like the DISS plant at the PSA shown in Fig. 1.10, [130, 226, 383, 384, 416, 419], or distributed collector solar fields using molten salt as the HTF [301]. The DISS plant consists of a parabolic-trough collector where the feed water is preheated, evaporated and converted into superheated steam as it circulates through the absorber tubes. The field consist of a single 665 m long row of parabolic-trough collectors with a total solar collecting surface of 3838 m2 . The modeling and control of these installations is dealt with in this book in Chaps. 4 and 5.\n\nFresnel Collectors Linear Fresnel reflectors use various thin mirror strips to concentrate sunlight onto tubes where fluid is circulating (Fig. 1.11). Higher concentration can be obtained\n\n14\n\n1\n\nSolar Energy Fundamentals\n\nFig. 1.11 Fresnel linear reflector at the School of Engineers of Seville University\n\nand these mirrors are cheaper than parabolic mirrors, but a more complex tracking mechanism is needed. Absorbers are located at the focal point of the mirrors and consist of an inverted air cavity with a glass cover enclosing insulated tubes. In some cases there are multiple absorbers to improve system efficiency.\n\nTower Plants with Central Receiver Systems Solar power towers have an array of reflectors (heliostats) that are able to track the Sun’s movement with two axis and concentrate solar radiation onto a central receiver at the top of a tower. The working fluid in the receiver is heated and then used for power generation. Power tower development is less advanced than trough systems but they offer higher efficiency and better energy storage capability. A Solar Power Tower (SPT) plant consists of the heliostat field, receiver unit, heat transfer, exchange and storage unit, steam and electricity production units and the integrated control system. Usually, each of the units has its specific control device. The integrated control system communicates with the different subsystems to coordinate the different units in such a way that the plant operates in a safe and efficient way. Typically, a plant control system includes heliostat control and heliostat field dispatch optimization, water level control in receivers, main steam temperature control, steam supply pressure and temperature in heat storage system control under heat releasing condition and the main steam pressure control. At present, there are only two commercial tower power plants in operation, the 10 MW (PS10) and the 20 MW (PS20) plants, designed, built and operated by Abengoa Solar close to Seville in Southern Spain (Fig. 1.12). The PSA has two exceptional facilities for testing and validating central receiver technology components and applications, the CRS and CESA-1. The SSPS-CRS plant was inaugurated in 1981 and it was originally an electricity production demonstration plant using a receiver cooled by liquid sodium which also served as a thermal storage fluid. The 43 m high metal tower has two test platforms. The CESA-I project, was built in 1983. Direct solar radiation is collected by the collector field\n\n1.3 Technology Classification\n\n15\n\nFig. 1.12 PS20: 20 MW solar power tower (courtesy of Abengoa, www.abengoasolar.com)\n\nof 300 heliostats (with 39.6 m2 reflective surface each, Fig. 1.13). A maximum of 7 MW thermal power can be delivered by the field onto the receiver. The 80 m high concrete tower has three test levels, at 45 m, at 60 m and at 80 m. The modeling and control of these installations will be treated in Chap. 6.\n\nDish Collectors A dish engine system consists of a parabolic collector dish that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned at the focal point of the reflector. The reflector is able to track the Sun along two axes. A Stirling engine positioned at the focal point of the parabola is used to generate power. Solar dish systems are modular and have Fig. 1.13 CESA-1 tower plant at PSA (courtesy of PSA)\n\n16\n\n1\n\nSolar Energy Fundamentals\n\nFig. 1.14 Dish collector at PSA (courtesy of PSA)\n\ncomparatively high conversion efficiency and can be deployed either individually or grouped together. Dish concentrators approximate a paraboloid of revolution. The mirrors require relatively high curvature because the focal length of the dish is only a few meters. Some concentrators use multiple mirrors to approximate the ideal concentrator shape. Other concentrators use a thin reflective membrane which is given the right shape by using vacuum. The concentration ratio of solar dish systems is usually around 2000 suns. The receiver, located at the focal point of the collector, absorbs energy reflected by the concentrator (Fig. 1.14). The conversion of heat to mechanical energy in solar dish systems is done by compressing a working cold fluid, heating the compressed fluid and finally expanding it in a piston or turbine to produce work. An electric generator is used to convert the mechanical power to electrical power. The electrical power output in current Stirling dish systems is about 25 kWe.\n\n1.3.2 Other Applications 1.3.2.1 Solar Furnaces Solar energy has been used to produce high temperatures in solar furnaces. Solar radiation is collected by an array of mirrors which concentrate the solar radiation light onto a focal point. The largest solar furnace is Odeillo furnace built in 1968 in the Pyrenees, a mountain range between France and Spain. The furnace has a 16000 concentration factor and is capable of reaching temperatures of up to 3500°C. It uses an array of mirrors to collect and reflect solar radiation onto a larger curved mirror which focuses onto an area the size of a few square decimeters where samples are placed for material testing purposes (Fig. 1.15). The PSA has a solar furnace facility which is able to reach concentrations of over 10000 suns. The main application field is materials testing. The solar furnace consists of a continuously solar-tracking heliostat field, a parabolic concentrator\n\n1.3 Technology Classification\n\n17\n\nFig. 1.15 Solar furnace in Odeillo, France (www.sollab.eu/doctoralcolloquium6/)\n\nmirror, an attenuator or shutter and the test zone located in the concentrator focus. In Chap. 7, Sect. 7.2, the modeling and control of the solar furnace of the PSA will be studied in detail.\n\n1.3.2.2 Solar Cooling Solar energy cannot only be used for heating but also for cooling purposes. Solar cooling also has the advantage of requiring little energy storage, because the needs of cold air match solar radiation very well. There are various ways in which solar energy can be used for cooling [177, 209]. Absorption technology is the most popular and consists of using solar thermal energy to feed thermally driven chillers. Absorption chillers use a refrigerant which is absorbed by a liquid sorbent. The thermal solar energy is injected in the generator where the refrigerant is desorbed from the refrigerant–sorbent solution. The refrigerant vapor pressure generated is sufficient to condense the refrigerant in the condenser. The refrigerant vapor is absorbed back into the solution which is cooled in the absorber. The solution is pumped to the generator by a pump. Most absorption chillers use water as refrigerant and lithium bromide as solvent or ammonia as refrigerant and water as solvent. If water is used as the refrigerant (water/lithium bromide pair), the cold temperature is above 0°C. The absorption chillers using ammonia/water can generate evaporator temperatures as low as to −60°C and can be used for industrial cooling systems. Another type of chiller, adsorption chillers, uses water as a refrigerant which is adsorbed in a solid sorbent such as silica gel (among disposal of latent heat on the surface). The latent heat can decrease to zero when enough water molecules are added and then only evaporation heat is dissipated. The desorption of the stored water and the generation of enough pressure for the condensation can be done at temperatures below 70°C and the technology is appropriate for solar thermal technology with little concentration factors. In a typical solar absorption cooler with a water/lithium bromide pair (Fig. 1.16), the solar energy collected is used at the generator to boil water from the lithium bromide and water solution. The water vapor is cooled down in the condenser and from there it goes to the evaporator where it is evaporated at low pressure providing the\n\n18\n\n1\n\nSolar Energy Fundamentals\n\nFig. 1.16 Solar cooling system at CIESOL R&D Center, University of Almería\n\nrequired cooling. The heat of the strong lithium bromide solution is used to preheat the weak solution entering the generator. The water vapor leaving the evaporator is absorbed by the strong solution in the absorber. An auxiliary energy source, usually a gas boiler, is used to supply hot water to the chiller when the solar radiation is not sufficient. Double or triple effect absorption cooling cycles have been used in different solar chillers to increase efficiency. Double effect absorption chillers require hot water temperatures of around 180°C. Since a flat-plate solar collector can only heat water up to 80°C, some concentration is needed. Fresnel and parabolic troughs are normally used. Solar cooling control systems will be treated in Chap. 7, Sect. 7.3.\n\n1.3.2.3 Water Treatment and Solar Desalination Plants One interesting field of solar chemistry applications is the solar photochemistry. Solar photochemical processes make use of the spectral characteristics of the incoming solar radiation to effect selective catalytic transformations which find application in the detoxification of air and water and in the processing of fine chemical commodities [205]. In solar detoxification photocatalytic treatment of non-biodegradable persistent chlorinated water contaminants typically found in chemical production processes is achieved. For this purpose parabolic-trough collectors (PTC) with glass absorbers are employed and the high intensity of solar radiation is used for the photocatalytic decomposition of organic contaminants. The process uses UV energy, available in sunlight, in conjunction with the photocatalyst, titanium dioxide, to decompose organic chemicals into non-toxic compounds. Another application concerns the development of a prototype employing lower concentration compound parabolic concentrators (CPC) [205]. An example are the photo-reactors placed in the PSA (Fig. 1.17(a)), where advanced oxidation processes allow to oxidize and mineralize almost any organic contaminant. Among them, the Photo-Fenton method is known for its high reaction rates and its applicability with natural sunlight, which is a cheap, sustainable photon source and an adequate solar technology developed to pilot-plant scale. The process cost may be considered the main reason that serious doubts are harbored as to its feasibility for commercial application. Research, therefore, focuses on ways to reduce these costs, through the application of sunlight instead of expensive UV lamps as a source of the required photons, study of the influence of process parameters on the reaction rates in order to increase reactor throughput, or the evolution\n\n1.3 Technology Classification\n\n19\n\nFig. 1.17 Solar desalination plant at water detoxification loop at the PSA (courtesy of PSA)\n\nof toxicity and biodegradability during treatment to determine the best point for discharging waste water or coupling with subsequent biological treatment. Experimental design approaches have been employed for pilot-plant experimentation to upscale the process and optimize pilot-plant experimentation strategies [7]. Water desalination can be achieved by using a number of techniques. These may be classified into the following categories: (i) phase-change or thermal processes and (ii) membrane or single-phase processes [205]. In the phase-change or thermal processes, the distillation of sea water is achieved by utilizing a thermal energy source. In the membrane processes, electricity is used either for driving high pressure pumps or for ionization of salts contained in the sea water. Desalination processes require significant quantities of energy to achieve separation. This is highly significant as it is a recurrent cost which few of the water-short areas of the world can afford. Solar energy can be used for sea-water desalination either by producing the thermal energy required to drive the phase-change processes or by producing electricity required to drive the membrane processes. Solar desalination systems are thus classified into two categories, i.e. direct and indirect collection systems. As their name implies, direct collection systems use solar energy to produce distillate directly in the solar collector, whereas in indirect collection systems, two subsystems are employed (one for solar energy collection and one for desalination) [205]. In [318] a description of a technical development in desalination that combines a thermal desalination system and a solar field with a double effect absorption heat pump to reduce the cost of water production is presented. Figure 1.17(b,c) shows the AQUASOL plant at the PSA, where a solar distillation technology based on a multieffect distillation (MED) plant with 3 m3 /h nominal distillate production. The MED\n\n20\n\n1\n\nSolar Energy Fundamentals\n\nplant (Fig. 1.17(b)) consists of 14 effectors in vertical arrangement at decreasing pressures from cell 1 to cell 14. Sea water is preheated and pumped to the first cell where it goes down to the following cells by gravity at the same time that part of the water is evaporated. For optimal operation, the feed-water inlet temperature in the first cell must be 66.5°C. It is possible to reach this temperature with heat from a solar field and also by steam generated by an auxiliary gas boiler coupled to a double effect absorption heat pump, which can work at variable loads of the steam (from 30% to 100%). Solar collector field consists of CPC collectors (Fig. 1.17(c)) coupled to two water storage tanks, 12 m3 capacity each one, used as heat storage system. Energy supplied by the solar field and double effect absorption heat pump is transferred to a thermal storage tank using water as HTF. The AQUASOL plant can operate in three different modes; solar, fossil and hybrid (for more details see [318]).\n\n1.4 Energy Storage Intermittent energy sources are, in general, unpredictable as the generated power depends on the weather. In electrical grid energy sources, stored energy has to be used to balance the mismatch between the energy production from intermittent energy sources and the demand [185]. Energy is stored in fuels (coal, oil, gas) or other systems which store electrical, mechanical, thermal or chemical energy. Battery systems have been used in grid isolated small, usually domestic, systems. Batteries are expensive with high maintenance costs and limited lifespan. Hybrid and electric cars will also be able to store a substantial amount of energy if they are mass-produced. Electric utilities are planning to use plug-in vehicle batteries to store electricity. Mechanical energy can be stored as compressed air, flywheel or by pumped hydro storage. Water is pumped to a high storage reservoir using the excess capacity. Pumped storage is the most cost effective way of mass power storage, recovering about 75% of energy. Its main drawback is that two adjacent reservoirs with a significant difference in height are required. Energy from pumped water storage can be delivered very rapidly, normally in less than one minute and they are appropriate for grid regulation. Hydrogen can be produced by the electrolysis of water into hydrogen and oxygen or by reforming natural gas with steam and then converted back to electricity by fuel cells. Thermal energy storage is used by solar thermal plants which can use oil or molten salt as a heat store (Fig. 1.18) or directly store the steam produced. This stored energy can be used to generate electricity at night or when solar radiation is not sufficient to cover the production program. In thermal solar power plants, thermal storage and/or fossil backup act as the following [359]. • An output management tool to prolong operation after sunset, to shift energy sales from low revenue off-peak hours to high revenue peak demand hours and to contribute to guaranteed output. • An internal plant buffer, smoothing out insolation charges for steadying cycle operation and for operational requirements such as blanketing steam production, component pre-heating and freeze protection.\n\n1.4 Energy Storage\n\n21\n\nFig. 1.18 Examples of energy storage systems ((a) courtesy of PSA, (b) courtesy of ACS, http://www.protermosolar.com/boletines/boletin08.html)\n\nIn general, thermal storage is a physical or chemical process which takes place in the storage tank during system charging and discharging. The storage system consists of the storage tank, the storage medium and the specific charge and discharge devices. Thermal energy is transferred from the solar receiver to storage (charging) and from storage to the conversion system (discharging) by a HTF. Thermal storage systems employed in solar thermal power plants, whether for power tower or parabolic-trough collector technologies, are based on: • • • •\n\nSensible heat storage in saturated liquids. Sensible heat storage in solids. Latent heat storage. Thermochemical storage.\n\nBoth liquids and solids are used for storage of sensible heat. In addition to the thermophysical properties of the material employed, the cost of this material also becomes relevant to selection [185]. For temperatures up to 300°C, the most economical solution is mineral thermal oil at atmospheric pressure. For temperatures up to 410°C, synthetic or silicon oils are used, but they must work at low pressure and are more expensive. Molten salt and sodium are used between 300 and 550°C at atmospheric pressure, but they require antifreeze systems [402]. At higher temperatures, ceramic materials begin to be a competitive alternative.\n\n22\n\n1\n\nSolar Energy Fundamentals\n\nTable 1.1 Overview of thermal storage systems that have been tested on large scale Location\n\nStorage\n\nPrimary coolant\n\nDesign temperature (°C)\n\nDesign\n\nSEGS-1 Ca\n\nOil\n\nOil\n\n240–307\n\n2 tanks: hot/cold\n\nSSPS Al\n\nOil\n\nOil\n\n225–295\n\n1 thermocline tank\n\nSSPS Al\n\nOil/cast iron\n\nOil\n\n225–295\n\n1 hybrid tank\n\nSolar-1 Ca\n\nOil/rock/sand\n\nSteam\n\n224–304\n\n1 hybrid tank\n\nCESA-1 Al\n\nMolten salt\n\nSteam\n\n220–340\n\n2 tanks: hot/cold\n\nSolar-2 Ca\n\nMolten salt\n\nMolten salt\n\n288–566\n\n2 tanks: hot/cold\n\nSSPS Al\n\nLiquid sodium\n\nLiquid sodium\n\n270–530\n\n2 tanks: hot/cold\n\nTSA Al\n\nCeramic balls\n\nAir\n\n200–800\n\n1 hybrid tank\n\nPhase-change materials (PCM) offer important advantages, for example, high volumetric capacities and rather stable temperatures. Numerous latent heat storage systems using expendable metals or salt have been proposed and studied, but they have never been tested on large scale due to their difficult heat exchange [31, 124]. The use of reversible chemical reactions has great potential for offering a highly efficient, high-density thermal storage system. Chemical storage is especially appropriate for high temperatures and for long-term storage (several days or weeks). They generally require reactions that are completely reversible and for the equilibrium temperature to be the same as the charge/discharge temperatures in the specific system. The reactions may be homogeneous gas or heterogeneous solid–gas or liquid–gas reactions [222]. The basic operating strategy of a solar thermal plant is the one in which solar only operates the power block. If the solar field has exactly the right size to provide the energy the conversion unit needs at rated power, it is called a solar multiple equal 1. The solar multiple is closely related to the plant design point. If a solar multiple equal 1 is selected for June 21st, the plant will only operate at its rated power one day a year (northern hemisphere). If, on the contrary, it is selected for December 21st, the plant will operate all year at rated power but the extra energy will be wasted. Thermal storage systems provide the possibility of employing this excess energy at certain times of the year (summer) without increasing the solar field. The specific solar plant technology, operating temperature and coolant chosen significantly affect thermal storage, which may either: • use the same fluid as primary coolant and for thermal storage; • use different fluids for coolant and storage. In the first case only a storage tank or cold tank/hot tank design is used, while for the second there must be a hybrid storage system or regenerator. Table 1.1 gives an overview of thermal storage systems that have been tested on large scale. In [185] the main characteristics of the different electricity storage techniques and their field of application (permanent or portable, long- or short-term storage, maximum power required, etc.) are analyzed. These characteristics serve to make\n\n1.5 Summary\n\n23\n\ncomparisons in order to determine the most appropriate technique for each type of application.\n\n1.5 Summary In this chapter, solar energy fundamentals have been briefly introduced highlighting those aspects that are used in the following chapters. An overview of the main solar thermal technologies has also been performed, including general descriptions and examples, as well as an introduction to those facilities at the PSA that are used in this book to show illustrative examples of modeling and control techniques.\n\nChapter 2\n\nControl Issues in Solar Systems\n\n2.1 Introduction This chapter is devoted to introduce the main issues involved in the control of solar energy systems. Four different levels can be distinguished: (i) the control of the solar collector units, (ii) solar radiation estimation and forecast, (iii) the control of the energy conversion systems and (iv) the overall control of the complete process. The control of the solar collecting systems consist of controlling the solar collectors movements in such a way that the maximum solar energy is collected at any time. In the case of dish collectors with two degrees of freedom, the controls system keeps the collector surface perpendicular to the solar vector. In the case of solar trough or collectors with one degree of freedom, the mission of the controller is to maintain the solar collector surface normal as close as possible to the Sun vector. The controller has to compute the Sun vect"
