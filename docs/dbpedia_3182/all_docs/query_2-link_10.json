        "text": "If you are new to the lighting area, no matter you are a lighting broker, designer, contractor, or from a local lighting company, you would wonder, how you can find reliable led lighting suppliers in China.\n\nThe main reason people would purchase the lighting from China is that the price is very competitive, lower 40-60% when compared with your local market in general. So, Why not?\n\nSelecting the right lighting supplier would be a headache since there are thousands of lighting suppliers from China.\n\nWhy selecting the right supplier so important?\n\n1. It relates to product quality.\n\nDifferent lighting suppliers are always with different quality standards. A supplier has been producing the led downlights for over 10 years; they knew what high standard aluminum was when they purchased the raw materials. They will also have a quality check team to inspect the quality, if they find some flow in the downlight, they will improve the quality to make it reach the high-quality standard.\n\nImagine B factory is new in this lighting area, not care about the details at all. They would just ignore the flow and just deliver for the client. If you asked them, why the lighting fixtures are with the flow, the answers may made you speakless, the flow is normal since they don’t think the downlight is with the flow. All that is because of different factories with different quality standards.\n\n2. It related to the delivery time\n\nImage your project has a deadline, the lighting has to be there before the due date.\n\nYour supplier promised you a delivery time, but they can’t catch it somehow and are getting delayed.\n\nYou and your client will be mad and it will cause big chaos for both of you.\n\nFactory management is not an easy thing; that is the reason the quantity of capable factories is less than we thought.\n\nRich experience manufacturers will have a scientific plan or schedule of the production. They will also delay sometimes due to uncontrollable factors such as peak load shifting or extreme weather, but they will minimize the delay.\n\n3. services.\n\nA good lighting supplier will take good care of the services. Your message will be replied to on time, the packing size will be squeezed to a mini-size, which will save the shipping costs in that way. When you’ve received your lightings, if some items are broken during shipping, a good supplier will replace them for you.\n\nMoreover, a good supplier will guide your client to install some complicated lighting fixtures in so many ways(Like making an installation video, drawing the specific step-by-step installation guide in English).\n\nSee, selecting a reliable supplier will save your money and your time, and your reputation will be well maintained if you work with such a manufacturer. You can’t say that is not important, right?\n\nHere is our list of the top 20 lighting suppliers in China. Each supplier has their strengths just like ZANFI lighting’s strength is good at the bespoke chandeliers.\n\nWhy those top 50 LED lighting suppliers be listed?\n\n1. All those companies with over 10 years of experience in the lighting area, which is a big guarantee.\n\n2. Strong and professional salespersons.\n\n3. Powerful R&D team.\n\n4. Most of them offer OEM services.\n\n5. Some of them allow tailor-made\n\n6. The scale of the company is large.\n\nWe cannot 100% promise working with these suppliers can avoid all the headache issues, but it will minimize the risk of getting into trouble.\n\n♛Top 1\n\nNVC lighting\n\n●Years of establishment:1998\n\n●Location: Huizhou City, Guangdong Province, China(Headquarter)\n\n●Website: www.nvc-international.com\n\n●Main products: indoor lighting like LED strip, downlight, track light, spotlight, led panel, lamps.
