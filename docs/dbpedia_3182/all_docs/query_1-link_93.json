        "text": "Narrating China\n\nJia Pingwa, whose novels have brought both fame and controversy, has an enormous readership throughout the Chinese-speaking world. However, despite his cultural signiﬁcance and the use of his poetry, novels and prose in schools and universities, there has never been any substantial academic study of the writer and his writings. Wang answers this omission by examining the corpus of Jia’s writing and emphasizing his importance, prominence and relevance to contemporary Chinese society. Tracing Jia Pingwa’s career from his peasant origins in Shaanxi Province to his status as a professional writer of national and international signiﬁcance, Narrating China brings to light his preoccupation with cultural traditions and national identity. Focusing on the context of ‘national narration’, Wang demonstrates how Jia’s local stories capture regional characteristics and yet strongly identify with an imaginary China. This careful and detailed analysis highlights the importance of nationalism in contemporary Chinese literature and underpins the signiﬁcance of regional writing in negotiating China’s national identities.

Based in Xi’an, Shaanxi province, in northwestern China, he has been called a nativist writer (xiangtu zuojia !) and is highly regarded as a stylist whose extensive works have enjoyed a sustained and loyal readership for over thirty years. This book traces Jia Pingwa’s career from his peasant origins to his status as a professional writer of national and international inﬂuence, with his major novels studied in their order of publication. This analysis of Jia Pingwa’s writings is linked to the history of modern Chinese literature, especially the development of the ‘novel’ genre. The focus is on the context of China’s ‘national narration’, asking how Jia Pingwa’s native place of Shangzhou emerges as a microcosm of ‘China’. Two aspects of Jia Pingwa’s writing come under special scrutiny: his political goal of nativist national narration and his aesthetic project of restoring and developing Chinese narrative traditions. Jia Pingwa’s literary nativism entails that his local stories capture regional characteristics and yet strongly identify with an imaginary China. Jia Pingwa excels in ﬁction and in the essay, and is deemed to be one of the ﬁnest essayists in China. In both genres he has drawn upon indigenous narrative traditions. Stylistically, his ﬁction has beneﬁted greatly from the narrative techniques of traditional Chinese vernacular ﬁction. His essays show a direct connection to the genre’s great masters in terms of subject matter, style, language, sentiment and aesthetic values. His 1993 novel, Defunct Capital, however, marked a grave setback in his writing career. The ban imposed on the book in 1994 is still in place, and in the view of the authorities the explicit sexual descriptions were harmful to readers. Jia Pingwa has nevertheless continued writing, and published another six novels since 1995. His popularity with his readers, if not always with the critics, is evidenced by the numerous editions and reprints of his works available. Jia Pingwa is one of the most important writers living in China today. Despite his being cold-shouldered by establishment critics, his continuing popularity speaks for itself. His works are unique in articulating the voices\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\nof Chinese ‘peasants’, his nativist efforts develop and sustain Chinese narrative traditions and his innovative narrative language is imbued with local characteristics and textual beauty. Jia Pingwa’s literary career offers a rewarding way of tracing the history and development of contemporary Chinese literature. I have used both pinyin and Chinese characters when a Chinese proper name ﬁrst appears in the text. In quoting I have used either simpliﬁed or full characters in accordance with the source. Chapter 4, ‘Defunct Capital and the sexual dissident’, ﬁrst appeared with minor differences in ‘Mr Butterﬂy in Defunct Capital: “Soft Masculinity” and (mis)engendering China’, in Kam Louie and Morris Low, eds, Asian Masculinities: The Meaning and Practice of Manhood in China and Japan (London: Routledge Curzon, 2003), pp. 41–58.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis book began as my PhD thesis and it has taken me a long time to complete. Help and support from both individuals and institutions have been essential in bringing this project to its ﬁnish. My study and work of the past ten years are closely associated with the Institute for International Studies, University of Technology, Sydney, and School of Cultures and Languages at the University of Sydney. From both institutions I have received much support and I am most grateful to the continuing help and encouragement from many colleagues and friends at these two places. The Fisher Library at the University of Sydney, especially staff at East Asian Collection and Interlibrary Loans, has been most helpful for my research. The Research Seeding Fund of the Faculty of Arts at the University of Sydney made it possible for me to purchase research materials and to conduct interviews in China for this book. The Special Studies Program at the University of Sydney allowed me to spend time at the Fairbank Center for East Asia Research of Harvard University and at the International Institute for Asian Studies, Leiden, the Netherlands. As a result, I was able to be in contact with a wide range of leading researchers in my ﬁeld and to beneﬁt from discussions with them and from the excellent library collections at both places. I thank Kirk Denton for his suggestions on the approach this study takes and David Der-wei Wang for the idea of viewing Jia Pingwa’s writing as regional ethnography. I was fortunate to have Mabel Lee as my PhD supervisor. This book would not have been possible without her guidance, supervision and help. What I have learnt and continue to learn from her is not only academic skills and insight about China but the meanings of kindness, generosity and wisdom. David Goodman has been an ‘unofﬁcial’ supervisor for my intellectual endeavours in general for a long time. He was the intellectual inspiration for this book and for my current research project on Chinese regional literatures. The numerous discussions I had with him in the mid-1990s were the beginning of my understanding and appreciation of intellectual debates about China and beyond. Concerned about any undue inﬂuence and out of the belief of the ‘death of the author’, I was reluctant to contact the subject of my study, Jia Pingwa,\n\nx\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nfor the entire period when I was a graduate student. However, my correspondence with him in the past few years has been most useful and informative. I thank Jia Pingwa for his assistance, generosity, open-mindedness and, of course his extraordinary productivity. When I ﬁnished my thesis in 1998, Jia Pingwa was the author of four novels. By the time this book was completed, ten novels had been published. Of course his rate of productivity makes the very task daunting, but this book is all the richer as a result. Many people contributed to this book and helped me directly or indirectly. I have learnt a great deal from Maghiel van Crevel, Helen Dunstan, Louise Edwards, John Fitzgerald, Gao Yuanbao, Wilt Idema, Kam Louie, Tim Oakes, Simon Patton, John Stowe and Sun Jianxi. My special thanks also go to Tony Stephens, whose comments on English usage have been the most enlightening and corrections most helpful. Personal friends, especially Catherine Armitage, Margaret Bradstock, Bernard Lane and Susan King, have taught me about Australia and inducted me into Australian society. Love, encouragement, discipline and inspiration from Barry Jay have been instrumental in bringing this book to completion. My last, but not the least thanks are reserved for my daughter Xiaoxiao, whose childhood and teenage years were spent with the need to accommodate my research for this book. Both the mother and the daughter are products of my academic career and I am grateful for her understanding and support.\n\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nResiding in Xi’an, Shaanxi province, in north-western China, Jia Pingwa (b. 1952) is a proliﬁc producer of novels, novellas, short stories and essays, and an occasional poet. By 2005 Jia Pingwa had published ten novels, dozens of collections of short stories, novellas and essays, and one book of poetry. The ten novels are: Shangzhou (Shangzhou ; 1984), Turbulence (Fuzao ; 1988), Pregnancy (Renshen ; 1989), Defunct Capital (Feidu ; 1993), White Nights (Baiye ; 1995), Earth Gate (Tumen ; 1996), Old Gao Village (Gaolaozhuang ; 1998), Remembering Wolves (Huainianlang ; 2000), Health Report (Bingxiang baogao !; 2002) and Local Accent (Qinqiang ; 2005). Jia Pingwa commands an enormous readership in the Chinese-speaking world. Many of his publications have numerous editions in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Two of his major novels, Turbulence and Defunct Capital, and a small number of his short stories and essays have been translated into many languages, including English, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Russian and Vietnamese. His works have been used as textbooks for students in schools and at universities, both inside and outside China.\n\nFrom mountain village to provincial capital Jia Pingwa began publishing in 1973, initially in Shaanxi’s provincial literary journals and local newspapers. Within a few years, his writing was being accepted by major national literary journals. By the end of the 1980s, Jia Pingwa was able to change the situation in his favour, making it a privilege for journals to be able to publish his works and since then he has often been pursued by the editors of journals and publishing houses for such a privilege. Chinese readers tend to respond differently to the different genres Jia Pingwa uses. In China his novels often attract very different comments, from the extremely positive to the drastically negative. Despite his extensive popularity among Chinese readers and the amount of criticism he attracts from Chinese critics, to date his novels have not been awarded any national prizes. By comparison, his short stories, novellas and essays have won a number of national and provincial prizes in China. His essays have appeared in such a\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nvariety of editions that it is impossible to track all of them for a totally comprehensive bibliography. In the anglophone countries Jia Pingwa remains little known to general readers, despite his having won the American Mobil Pegasus Prize in 1988 with his second novel Turbulence.1 Some of his essays, short stories and novellas have been translated into English but, with the exception of Turbulence, his novels are not available in English. His readership in the anglophone world largely consists of academics and students of Chinese literature. His best-known and most controversial novel, Defunct Capital, is not available in English, although it has attracted scholarly attention worldwide. Most anglophone academic assessments of contemporary Chinese literature and culture tend to mention the heated debates about sexual descriptions in Defunct Capital, whereas his other writings are barely discussed.2 Jia Pingwa’s works are more favourably received by the francophone world, and a number of his major works already exist in French translation. Defunct Capital’s French translation by Geneviève Imbot-Bichet, La capitale déchue (Jia Pingwa 1997e), much to the puzzlement of Chinese feminists, won the French Femina Prize in 1997 (Xu Kun 1999: 186).3 In 2003, Jia Pingwa was awarded the honour of the Chevalier in arts and literature by the French Ministry of Culture and Communication.4 This book concentrates on Jia Pingwa’s major novels, especially the thematic concerns and textual features of his representative works. However, since this is the ﬁrst monograph in English on Jia Pingwa, his short stories, essays and poetry will also be brieﬂy discussed. Information about Jia Pingwa’s career and his writing is provided as comprehensively as possible, as far as it is relevant to a critical assessment of his literary production. There is also a brief sketch of his biography in connection with an outline of the historical and social context in which his writings occur. The three decades of Jia Pingwa’s literary journey have been marked by very different concerns, difﬁculties and complexities as well as successful and not so successful literary attempts. Coincidentally, Jia Pingwa’s writing career, to a large extent, is easily divisible in terms of thematic development in his works. In other words, a parallel is readily perceptible between stages in Jia Pingwa’s personal growth and various periods in his literary journey – he seems to write about certain issues in certain genres and his writing matures as he himself develops as an individual, an observer and a thinker. Such a parallel lends a convenience to tracing the development of Jia Pingwa’s intellectual concerns and literary production: hence the chronological structure of this book. At the same time the chronological approach also enhances the thematic transition of Jia Pingwa’s creativity, and may also allow this book to serve as a reference for the study of his writing in general. Among the many factors that contribute to the signiﬁcance of Jia Pingwa as a major contemporary Chinese writer, the most important are his narrative aesthetics, the huge quantity of his publications, the enormous readership he commands in the Chinese-speaking world, and the public debates generated\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nby his writing. Jia Pingwa’s immense popularity means it is highly relevant to discuss the author, his readership and the critical and popular receptions of his works. The author, the reader and the markets are all active agents in the production and consumption of Jia Pingwa’s works. The continual aggressive and relentless marketing of Jia Pingwa’s works by various publishers since the late 1980s shows Jia Pingwa’s unfailing popularity in the Chinese-speaking world, despite, or rather because of, the very negative opinions expressed by many inﬂuential critics in China. Other than the bestseller Defunct Capital, which remains banned by the authorities, the ﬁerce competition among publishers to publish and market Jia Pingwa’s writings, especially his essays, as a result of the proﬁt his writings bring, and the production of pirated copies, are phenomena of contemporary cultural consumption5 that contradict general assumption on the part of Chinese intellectuals that China is experiencing a cultural crisis in the face of globalization and consumerism.6 Jia Pingwa has produced an enormous number of essays and has been recognized as one of the most outstanding essayists in today’s China.7 Some of his essays have already become classics and form major volumes in large anthologies.8 According to the statistics generated by Martin Woesler in the late 1990s, among the prose essayists who were born after 1949 Jia Pingwa is the most published and his prose essays rank the highest in terms of popularity. Five of Jia Pingwa’s essays are included in the sixty most popular Chinese essays selected from publications since the 1920s, and they rank top ﬁfth (Woesler, M. 2000b: xxxii, 218, 221). Although Jia Pingwa’s ﬁction may not be as popular as his essays, it should still rank fairly high considering the enthusiasm of publishers in chasing after his manuscripts and the number of editions of his novels. What lies behind the immense popularity of Jia Pingwa’s prose and ﬁction is a highly seductive textual aesthetics in terms of both subject matter and narrative style. His stories are highly accessible, usually offering an enticing story told in a lucid narrative language that is rich in local ﬂavours. Even the critics who judge him harshly on moral grounds admit that Jia Pingwa writes well and that his writing is seductive because of its literary excellence.9 Jia Pingwa has borrowed from Chinese narrative traditions in both elite and popular forms. In ﬁction, he insists on the Chinese popular tradition of xiaoshuo , small talk, believing that stories should be written as if they are told orally, face to face to an audience. He also purposefully obscures the boundaries between prose, ﬁction and sometimes poetry with great success. Many of his essays border on being prose poems with a highly perceptible lyrical quality, whereas his short stories, novellas and even novels use many features of prose, especially in terms of narrative structure, plot, language and the ﬂow of events. Unlike many of his contemporaries who draw innovative inspiration from narrative traditions other than Chinese, Jia Pingwa’s literary experimentation is inward-looking, although no less daring in his innovative adaptation of features of classical Chinese literary narratives.\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhat he writes and how he writes are highly imbued with local colour, and his writings demonstrate a strong sense of nativism, which expresses a profound concern for the culture and people of his native place. Like political and social nativism, literary nativism is a response to a global colonial or post-colonial context. Jia Pingwa’s literary nativism is informed by the need to preserve, protect and develop indigenous traditions in the continuing process of China’s modernization, which is a result of China’s awareness of the powerful Western Other.\n\nFrom author to text Bonnie McDougall argues that there is a closer link between the author and the text in Chinese literature than in Western literatures. She believes that there is a stronger, or even an inevitable, link between the author and the protagonist or the narrator of a work of ﬁction, because ‘Chinese authors invite audiences to make the leap from ﬁction to autobiography’ (McDougall, B. 2003: 9). Although it is arguable as to whether all Chinese authors are indeed so autobiographically preoccupied, it is certainly common for them to be often seen as present in their narratives, identiﬁed as either narrators or characters. In Chinese traditional novels, the narrator appears frequently to address the reader directly and his presence is often intended to ‘authenticate’ the narrative by providing historical or geographical details.10 Stories such as those by Lu Xun and Shen Congwen in the 1920s are often narrated in the ﬁrst person against the background of the authors’ native place, and the personas of the author and the narrator often merge to the extent that the ﬁrst-person narratives are taken as the life stories of the authors. The Maoist era reinforced another aspect of this link between the author and the text through continuation of the practice that writers were held responsible and accountable for their text politically. In other words, the authors were considered active participants in textual events and the deeds of their characters were the direct results of their thoughts, if not their personal actions. Chinese literary critics again make close connections between autobiographical elements and texts when they frequently group writers according to the similarities in their backgrounds, for instance, zhiqing wenxue ! – the educated youth literature, meinü zuojia ! – glamorous women writers, or xinshengdai zuojia !\" – writers of the newly born generation.11 On the one hand, appreciation of literary works bears a strong connection with the authors’ identity, whether on the basis of their background, gender or age. On the other hand, common thematic concerns and narrative styles in their writings in turn reinforce the shared identity of the authors. A further and deeper connection between Chinese authors and their texts is the Confucian tradition that writing should convey the way (wen yi zai dao !), and that writing should have a didactic purpose. Chinese writers have on the whole taken their moral responsibility seriously, which has\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\noften led to the positioning and the self-positioning of writers as intellectuals, if not always public intellectuals. In modern Chinese society, writers often take upon themselves a public role as a result of their sense of the historical, if not always political and ideological, mission of national salvation and national narration. In other words, the commonly observed ‘obsession with China’ (Hsia, C. T. 1999: 533–54; McDougall, B. 2003: 9) makes modern Chinese literary texts susceptible to political rendering and reading, and consequently the authors are viewed as political activists, or at least advocates of political causes. This author–text connection affects Chinese literature in two ways: Chinese writers can be politically more vulnerable and (in McDougall’s view) modern Chinese literature has been aesthetically problematical for general readers in the West (McDougall, B. 2003: 17–43). The recent phenomena of ‘glamorous women writers’ claiming to ‘write with their body’ and ‘newly born generation writers’ who ‘write for money and pleasure’ are, to a large extent, reactions to and the rejection of social responsibility imposed upon and accepted by writers of previous generations. This is indeed ‘another kind of reality’, to borrow Yu Hua’s famous title line, in the author–text–society triangle in the Chinese context. Indeed since the 1990s, China’s political climate has changed dramatically and there has been much greater tolerance of innovative and even subversive writings. Although literature remains a primary site of Chinese politics and the state still bans books at its own discretion, publishers, rather than writers, have been the direct targets of state control. Writers have been able to experiment in content, themes and narrative devices, and enormous changes have taken place in the contemporary literary scene. Nevertheless, the connection between authors and their texts remains as close as ever. Insufﬁcient distance between literary output and ideologies, whether on the part of the authors, Party ideologues, critics or readers, has too often led to the association of ﬁctional characters with the authors themselves. Younger writers, such as Weihui , Mianmian and Ge Hongbing , openly claim an autobiographical link with their ﬁction. In the sinophone discourse, it seems impractical and inappropriate to assume a critical stance without considering the biography of the author, let alone taking the ‘death of the author’ to the level of a theoretical framework when examining literary texts. How does Jia Pingwa ﬁgure in this matrix of author–text–society relationships? His writing mounts a complicated but special case. Responses to Jia Pingwa’s 1993 novel Defunct Capital show how closely related the author and his text are in the minds of critics and general readers: Jia Pingwa is simply equated with the anti-hero protagonist Zhuang Zhidie and he as author is accused of the immoral conduct of the ﬁctional character (see, for instance, Xiao Xialin 1993: 283). However, on the one hand, autobiographical elements in his writing are abundant, and many parallels can be drawn between himself and his characters, between his journey through life and those of the characters in his books. On the other hand, to frame the reading of such a rich, diversiﬁed body of literary texts under the notion of\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nautobiographical writing is counter-productive, reductionist and limiting. This book attempts a compromise by combining the autobiographical, social and cultural background with close reading of the text. Primarily the readings of Jia Pingwa’s texts will be channelled into the cultural space constructed by the narrative and the unfolding of the various dimensions of that cultural space. This approach means that identity issues are the core of this book. There are two primary reasons for taking identity issues as the key to understanding Jia Pingwa’s writing – his identity as ‘peasant writer’ (nongmin zuojah !) and the close connection between his life and his writing. Jia Pingwa came from a village and was a peasant for a few years after high school until he was nineteen years of age. Most of his writing is concerned with rural life, and Jia Pingwa has furthermore actively participated in manufacturing the label of ‘peasant writer’ for himself. In 1998 he published a memoir of his earlier life in the countryside and deﬁantly titled it I Am a Peasant (Wo shi nongmin !; Jia Pingwa 1998b). For a long time, there has existed a close biographical correspondence between his characters and his personal growth, although Jia Pingwa’s ﬁction in the 2000s has shown signs of change in this respect. For more than two decades, nevertheless, Jia Pingwa’s characters grew with him, their age and degree of maturity matched his own at different stages of life, and they spoke in similar voices, tones and language. In his teens and early twenties, he produced characters in their mid and late teens, such as Bingwa in ‘Soldier Boy’ (Bingwa ; 1977) and the sisters in the story of ‘Full Moon’ (Manyuer ; 1977), the young man and woman in ‘February Apricot’ (Eryuexing ; 1981), the young couples in ‘The Households in the Chicken Roost Gulley’ (Jiwowa renjia ; 1984) and the group of young enthusiastic rural reformers in Turbulence. Since the mid-1990s Jia Pingwa’s protagonists have been largely middle-aged males, who typically live both in the city and the village, or rather on the fringe of the city. The lack of psychological and perceptive distance between the author’s sense of self and the personages in his creative writing inevitably leads to a ready identiﬁcation of the character with the author by general readers and encourages speculation about the author’s biographical details in relation to his writing. My intention, however, is to examine the interactive relation and tension among Jia Pingwa’s life experiences, his inner journey and his writing in order to facilitate a critique on Jia Pingwa’s literary output rather than to assume a direct equation between the author and the personalities of his creativity.\n\nNative place in modern Chinese ﬁction One of the most signiﬁcant departures that modern Chinese ﬁction makes from its historical predecessors is the construction of the native place and the creation of regional representations with local colour. Although its emergence as a literary conﬁguration of space had to await the advent of modern\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nChinese ﬁction in the 1910s, the native place retained its centrality in the modern Chinese literary imagination throughout the twentieth century. Lu Xun, Shen Congwen, Ba Jin , Lao She , Mao Dun , Zhang Ailing and many more produced a great number of short stories and novels that are set in their home towns and in which ‘the place itself becomes a character in the narrative’ (Kinkley 1995: 4). Beginning from ‘native-soil literature’ (xiangtu wenxue !) in the early decades of the twentieth century, the need to construct a native place has been paramount in Chinese writing, whether to articulate concerns of national character defects (Lu Xun), to express cultural nostalgia (Shen Congwen), to arouse social and patriotic passions (Lao She) or to express national potency (Mo Yan ) or lack of it (Liu Heng 2). The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) especially encouraged the use of local colour in the creation of the native place of the Chinese communist revolution in the 1940s (Holm 1986: 7) and later for the nation-building of a ‘new’ China after the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. The native place has always been important for personal and group identity in Chinese society, as documented by Bryna Goodman in her study of the native associations in Shanghai in the republic era (Goodman, B. 1995a). Goodman’s study shows that country people who migrated to Shanghai from the same place had connections to each other on many levels. The native village had considerable inﬂuence upon their employment in the city, and fellow villagers helped to provide a support network for each other. Their common language with its similar accent and vocabulary made it much easier for them to talk to each other but, in turn, their cultural and linguistic commonality deﬁnes their origin. The native place for Chinese migrants was tangible, constant and usually rural. In modern ﬁction, however, the native place takes on connotations beyond the realistic and the practical. It may be the city or the countryside, the cosmopolitan centre or the village, the original or the adopted home town, a genuine place on the map or a merely imaginary location. It could be what the author calls guxiang or jiaxiang , home village or home town, but it may or may not be the author’s birthplace, for the home town may be where the author spent his or her formative youth so that it has become the source of cultural identiﬁcation. It could even be the author’s jiguan or laojia , the ancestral location, which may not be the author’s birthplace at all and yet is the location where the author chooses to place his or her cultural afﬁliation. In short, the ﬁctive native place is where the author ﬁnds cultural roots and expresses his or her longing for home, and its narrative construction is a phenomenon that began with the twentieth century. Although the theme of homesickness or sorrow at departing from one’s native place has been present in Chinese literature from the outset, especially in classical Chinese poetry, the native place in the traditional Chinese poetic imagination has been an abstract notion, not a concrete locality. The essence of native place is so effectively captured by the elegant lines of the\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nTang poet Li Bai (701–62) that they have been cherished by the Chinese ever since: ‘I wake, and moonbeams play around my bed, / Glittering like hoar-frost to my wondering eyes; / Up towards the glorious moon I raise my head, / Then lay me down, – and thoughts of home[town] arise’ (Giles, H. A. 1898: 60). Rather than ‘home’ as rendered in English in the last line, the original word ‘guxiang’, literally old country, refers to ‘my native land’. According to Tang Xiaobing, the earliest and the most memorable appearance of the notion ‘guxiang’ or ‘native country’ may be traced to the poem by the ﬁrst emperor of the Han dynasty, Liu Bang , as recorded by Sima Qian (ca. 145–ca. 86 BCE) in his Records of the Historian (Shiji ): ‘When powerful winds arise, all the clouds ﬂy fast and high; / Now that my might is bounded only by the seas, I have returned to my home town; / How could I ﬁnd brave men to guard the four corners of my land!’ Liu Bang, on this occasion, lamented publicly that ‘the traveller always pines for his hometown ( youzi bei guxiang !\")!’ (Watson, B. 1969: 141) Tang Xiaobing believes that Liu Bang’s lines have shaped an emotive pattern and propagated a collective pathos to the extent that, since the High Tang period in the eighth century, ‘the image and concept of guxiang best indicates a primary structure of feeling and frequently evokes a melancholic nostalgia that reaches metaphysical heights which also suggest allegorical dimensions’ (Tang Xiaobing 2000: 74 –5). In other words, one’s desolation at being away from one’s home town is virtually an archetype in Chinese poetry. The home town thus remained an abstract poetic notion until the emergence of modern Chinese ﬁction, although one can still argue the case of an abstract notion of native place in modern literary conﬁguration. As in Li Bai’s poem, it is the longing for home that is most conspicuous, especially when the departure is forced by political exile. It is only in modern Chinese ﬁction that the native place is created as the locale where the quotidian of the local is woven into the literary imagination. In his exploration of an English equivalent for the Chinese notion guxiang, which has been rendered as ‘home’, ‘home town’, ‘my old home’, ‘my native heath’, etc., Tang Xiaobing suggests the phrase ‘the native land’, for he believes that it captures both the sense of cultural origin and the emotional longing for that origin (Tang Xiaobing 2000: 74–5). My preference, however, is ‘native place’. The word ‘native’ has wider connotations that are directly connected with the phenomenon of ‘literary nativism’, and ‘place’ is more inclusive in embracing the variety of cultural origins, whether the location concerned is village, county, town or city. In modern Chinese ﬁction, especially in the writings that have been classiﬁed as ‘native-soil writing’, the native space is predominantly rural. However, urban centres may be equally important for cultural identities. The ‘city’ as the ‘native place’ holds equal importance with the ‘village’ in the quest for the location of one’s native culture. Many Chinese cities have a long history with their own distinctive linguistic and cultural traditions. Shanghai and Beijing, for instance, have been local and native in their own ways, despite\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\ntheir cosmopolitan qualities. Hence, the study of the literary construction of the native place and its link with local and national identity should not exclude cities. Song of Perpetual Remorse (Changhenge ; Wang Anyi 1996), for example, shows cosmopolitan Shanghai as indisputably local and remaining the location of many cherished cultural memories, at least for ‘native’ Shanghainese.12 Weihui’s Shanghai Baby (Shanghai baobei ; Weihui 2001) demonstrates the city in a similar light – Shanghai’s local culture is largely and paradoxically deﬁned by its cosmopolitanism and Shanghai is the native place for cultural memoirs of Shanghai. The role of the native place in modern Chinese ﬁction has not been examined as a signiﬁcant issue in Chinese literary studies, although many scholars have touched upon the meaning of cultural space when commenting on the writings of native-soil literature and root-searching literature. It is often agreed that Lu Xun was the ﬁrst to give native-soil literature this generic term when he compiled the initial anthology of modern Chinese literature. Leo Ou-fan Lee ﬁnds that root-searching literature re-presents the cultural origins of the writers feeling the need to ﬁnd alternatives after being forced to believe in what the Maoist ideology of the CCP had propagated for decades (Lee, Leo 1994: 221). Moreover, it is this focus on family and – usually rural – regional genealogy and the claim on authenticity that pose a forceful challenge to the CCP’s self-asserted authority as regards the popular imagination for the origin of the nation (Lee, Leo 1993: 367). Rosemary Haddon insists that ‘one should say that nativist literature and its thematics are interwoven with allegorical conceptions of the countryside. These conceptions can be either positive or negative; nonetheless, they evoke agrarian values or an agrarian worldview’ (Haddon, R. 1994: 99). In Kinkley’s study of Shen Congwen’s works, he notices Shen Congwen’s ‘regionalism’ when Shen Congwen presents West Hunan as a better China in his novel Alice in China (Alisi Zhongguo youji !\"#$; Shen Congwen 1928) (Kinkley, J. C. 1985). Despite the differences in their perspectives, these critics seem to have reached consensus on one point at least in their situation of the native place in rural areas. Urban environments have been overlooked and have not been associated with the quest for cultural roots. Another obvious reason for the city’s marking a blind spot in critical studies is the close connection between the city and Chinese modernity. China’s modernization began with urban centres, and the city has been the port through which Western ideas were introduced into China and where social and cultural changes were initiated. Hence, the city has not been the most obvious place for one to look for cultural origins as such. Many inﬂuential nativist writers were born and grew up in rural regions and they did not readily associate the city with their cultural roots. The critical neglect of the city as the native place also has to do with the critical attention given to ‘native-soil literature’ and its creation of the rural as the location of Chinese cultural traditions. A re-evaluation of the city in the assessment of the native place in modern Chinese literature is thus long overdue.\n\n10 Introduction\n\nNative place and literary nativism The construction of native place in modern Chinese literature is closely related to ‘literary nativism’. By ‘literary nativism’ I mean both the belief and the practice that literary writing should focus on constructing the native place and that the narrative style should continue and develop ‘indigenous’ narrative traditions. Literary nativism seeks to localize creative writing in terms of subject matter about the local space. It also, usually, strives to adopt ‘indigenous’ narrative devices, including format, style, characterization, narrative setting, language and other features. Literary nativism can manifest itself in some or all of the following ways: ﬁrst, a thematic concentration on creating the native place; second, stylistic innovation aimed at (re)creating narrative forms as ‘indigenous’ as possible; third, an awareness of other or foreign literary traditions that necessarily precedes the quest for ‘indigenous’ practice. Narrative devices may belong to, or be derivative of, ‘indigenous’ narrative traditions. This nativist tendency in stylistics resembles what Jeffrey Kinkley calls in Shen Congwen’s writing ‘visionary cultural revivalism’ (Kinkley, J. C. 2003). Some writers, such as Wang Zengqi and Jia Pingwa, make serious attempts to avoid traces of Europeanization and Maoism as much as possible. Literary nativism is not a genre of ﬁction or prose, or a category created to group writers into ‘schools’. Rather, it is an analytical framework within which modern Chinese literary works of nativist tendency can be viewed, compared and discussed. Literary nativism can therefore be seen as an attitude or a position from which the writing can be perceived. The commonality I seek to identify here is the intention and effort in creating the native place and the imagery associated with it. It is on the basis of nativism and the native place that I wish to explore the process of identity formation and cultural politics in modern Chinese ﬁction, especially Jia Pingwa’s ﬁction. If both subject matter and narrative style are considered, Chinese literary nativism may be best exempliﬁed by the works of Shen Congwen, Lao She, Wang Zengqi and Jia Pingwa. Many others, such as Lu Xun, Acheng or Li Rui , have also produced nativist writings, but theirs is a ‘partial’ literary nativism in the sense that their writings are nativist only with regard to the subject matter – in their concern with the conﬁguration of the native place as a space with ‘Chinese characteristics’. Stylistically, their writings borrow many narrative devices from other traditions and are therefore ‘partial’ in terms of their nativist tendencies. Jin Yong , the writer of martial-art stories par excellence, and Eryue He , the writer of popular historical fantasy, as well as their followers, may represent another kind of ‘partial’ literary nativism. Their ﬁction constructs the Chinese historical fantasy through historicism and indigenous narrative styles. Their novels appear as reincarnations of traditional vernacular ﬁction, especially in its characteristic intertextuality between ﬁction and history. However, creation of native place for the Chinese nation is not their major concern.\n\nIntroduction 11 Like political nativism or any other indigenous initiatives, literary nativism is not innate – it can develop only after the arousal of self-awareness as a result of an acquaintance with other literary traditions. Literary nativism can arise only where there are cross-cultural interactions, whether it is the consequence of the dominance of imperial powers or transnational cosmopolitanism or the impact of globalization. In other words, literary nativism may often be a response to the internationalization of literary writing and reading. For these reasons, literary nativism is an indirect product of colonialism and post-colonialism, and it is part and parcel of cultural nationalism. In a way similar to that in which nationalism has played a major part in Chinese politics, literary nativism has been a signiﬁcant phenomenon in China’s literary output, particularly in recent decades. Increasingly, literary nativism is a self-conscious response to the process of globalization, in the sense that Chinese writers increasingly write ‘locally’ and yet think nationally and internationally. The construction of local cultural space, either as an act of resistance to a dominant ideology or as a response to the threatening presence of the Other, can be found in a large number of contemporary Chinese writers: Acheng, Han Shaogong , Jia Pingwa, Mo Yan, Su Tong , Chen Zhongshi , Alai , Wang Anyi and many more. At the same time, where their writings probe into national issues and universal concerns of humanity, such probing is done through the construction of native place. The term ‘nativism’ has been used to refer to native-soil literature in Chinese studies. David Wang uses the concept of ‘nativist movement’ to describe the emergence and development of what he calls Taiwan’s nativesoil literature. He also identiﬁes a shared nativist tendency in mainland China’s ‘root-seeking’ and avant-garde literature (Wang, David 2000a: xx, xxix). Rosemary Haddon uses ‘nativism’, ‘nativist writing’ and ‘native-soil literature’ interchangeably in her study of Taiwan’s literary nativism (Haddon, R. 1996). Jeffrey Kinkley, one of the earlier researchers to have identiﬁed ‘nativism’ in modern Chinese literature, also uses ‘regionalism’ as the framework when viewing Shen Congwen’s writing (Kinkley, J. C. 1987; 1985). My proposal for literary nativism is to present a framework for examining the indigenous tendencies in Chinese literature, and my analytical focus is on aspects of nativist writing, especially its modes of representing the local cultural space. Within the paradigm of literary nativism, one may group many cognate terms: ‘native-soil literature’, ‘root-searching literature’ (xungen wenxue !), ‘neo-realist novels’ (xin xieshi xiaoshuo !\"), ‘urban novels’ (shijing xiaoshuo !), ‘regional literature’ (diyu wenxue ) and even some ‘experimental writing’ (shiyan xiaoshuo !). I have deliberately left out ‘city literature’ (chengshi wenxue !). Although its narrative setting is the urban centre, the focus of city literature, especially of recent works in this genre, is largely on aspects of ‘modernity’ in, if not a fetish for, the cosmopolitan life style of the urban elite (see for\n\n12 Introduction instance, Qiu Huadong 1999). In other words, as Li Jiefei argues, the decisive hallmark of city literature is its concentration on commercial activities and the lifestyle of white-collar workers in an ambience where the residents have become increasingly strangers to each other (Li Jiefei 1999: 56, 76). The characteristic of the cultural space in city literature verges on cosmopolitanism, and therefore it is predominantly transnational. Heinrich Fruehauf identiﬁes an ‘urban exoticism’ in city literature, whereby writers may focus on exoticizing precisely such contemporary transnational cosmopolitanism (Fruehauf, H. 1993: 133–64). ‘Urban literature’, in which literary nativism does have a role to play, is different from ‘city literature’. The difference lies in the presence or absence of local cultural space as the primary focus of the narrative. Lao She’s writing on Beijing can serve as a good example of urban nativism. So can Deng Youmei’s Beijing and Feng Jicai’s= Tianjin. What their writings have in common is a total devotion to the local cultural fabric, almost to the point of making a fetish of local and traditional cultural practice. As a result of the overwhelming political dominance over literary creativity in modern Chinese history, there has been an understandable trend to examine modern Chinese literature diachronically. Consequently the organic connections among the works and between the genres have been overlooked through political and historical periodization. The framework of literary nativism is synchronic and thus addresses adequately the divergences of literary production through the passage of time under the auspices of the native place as an alternative cultural space. In line with recent literary trends, increasingly more scholars in China have been paying a great deal of attention to the relation between regional identities and literary production. A number of studies on regional cultures have been produced, and the term ‘nativist writing’ (bentu xiezuo !) has become a frequent keyword in sinophone literary criticism. In 1995, The Best of China’s New Nativist Fiction (Zhongguo xinbentu xiaoshuo jingxuan !\"#$%&) edited by Chen Xiaoming was published. In his preface, Chen stresses the importance of the subjective positioning of the writers themselves and their writing in the post-colonial context. The difference between nativist literature (bentu wenxue !) and native-soil literature (xiangtu wenxue !) lies, in his analysis, in two key elements, namely the author’s intended audience and the author’s attitude towards that audience. To Chen Xiaoming, nativist writing emphatically addresses an international audience whereas native-soil literature demonstrates primarily a fondness for pastoral themes for the national audience. In his opinion the most representative writers of native-soil literature are Liu Shaotang or Sun Li . Chen also sees literary nativism as a constantly changing process and Chinese nativist writing as having swung between self-orientation and eroticism in the 1980s and 1990s (Chen Xiaoming 1995: 1–3). He claims to attempt a complementary treatment of the two tendencies in his selection of nativist writing by foregrounding writings that show\n\nIntroduction 13 China’s rural life ‘as a close representation of Chinese life in sharp contrast to the situation in Western developed countries’ (Chen Xiaoming 1995: 2). Judging from the ten texts he selected, his preference is entirely for the construction of the native place as a community of closure, and ‘native’ becomes a close synonym to ‘primitive’ and ‘rural’ in sharp contrast to any effects of modernization, enlightenment or westernization. In terms of narrative language and narrative style, the stories do not seem to demonstrate any particular concerns for local colour. Chen Xiaoming does, however, devote a few pages to the linguistic strategies adopted by nativist writers, and ﬁnds (like many others such as Leo Ou-fan Lee) that there is a tendency to move away from Maoist ideology, but he does not emphasize the ‘indigenous’ aspects of narratology.13 In the preface to the sixteen-volume series Stories of Regional Cultures in the New Era (Xinshiqi diyü wenhua xiaoshuo congshu !\"#$%&' ; Ding Fan 1998) edited by Ding Fan , he notes an increasingly close literary focus on regional cultural identities as a result of economic globalization and recent cultural changes in Chinese society. He believes that ‘leftover cultural difference’ (wenhua zhicha !) between the past rural cultural discourse and the present reality of Chinese urban lives has resulted in many cultural confusions in Chinese society. Hence many writers have focused on writing about the disjunction between the traditional rural and the modern urban (Ding Fan 1998: 1–2).14 To him, these writers have clearly in mind what constitutes their local cultural identities. To me, these writings also invariably demonstrate an attention to native place, which is certainly a way of responding to transnational cosmopolitanism – the increasing presence of globalizing elements has invoked the longing for home and for cultural roots. Ding Fan’s position admits the regionality in the works he has chosen but he fails to identify, let alone address, the key issues in the Chinese cultural imaginary – the connections and the ruptures between the local, the regional and the national in the international context.\n\nFrom local stories to national myths On the surface, nativist writing tends to focus either on rural society or on urban folk culture, which does not seem to be directly relevant to the course of the construction of a modern nationhood. Nevertheless, its very articulation of the dichotomies between tradition and modernity, the popular and the elite, the centrist and the regional, the rural and the metropolitan, is part of the discourse of modernity. The awareness of such dualities is essential in narrating a modern nationhood. It is only when the city, the elite and the modern become so overwhelming that there arises the need for their opposites: the traditional, the popular, the rural and the marginal. Chinese nativist writing, with all its nostalgia, its rustic and urban folklore, its exposure of ‘defects’ and enclosure, is a major contributor to China’s nation-building in the imaginary sphere. Indeed, selective memories of the past and of the\n\n14 Introduction native place, and their articulation, have often been used as strategies to express the need for the invention of identity and for the imagined community. Modern nation states have thrived on selective popular memories of the past, from which national identities are subsequently derived, an instance being the use of such strategies in Latin American countries (Rowe, W. and Schelling, V. 1991). At the same time, different national stories are also used by various political forces for their own purposes. The claim to present origins and authenticity often ﬁnds a powerful voice in the imageries of the native place. The CCP is notorious for its manipulation of national memory in its attempt to create a spurious ‘native place’ to accommodate its fabrication of myths of the origin of Chinese civilization to bolster the legitimacy of its party-state (Friedman, E. 2002). On the one hand, the creation of a native place is fundamentally related to narrating China, and Chinese regionality has been articulated solely to elaborate a speciﬁc identiﬁcation with ‘China’. On the other hand, to narrate China also means to locate China in a space more ‘authentic’ than anywhere else. This is where the native place is particularly appealing to both Chinese writers and Chinese readers. Obviously, the location of China, or the native place, in the literary imagination varies from author to author and from locality to locality, depending on the author’s place of cultural identiﬁcation. Literary nativism is motivated by the urge to tell local stories to conﬁgure national identity. Hence, the question most pertinent to literary nativism is: what is China culturally? ‘Culturalism’ – Chinese culture as the focus of loyalty for the Chinese people – remains the ultimate target (Townsend, J. 1996: xii; Levenson, J. R. 1971: 53–68). Hence Chinese literary nativism does not aim at locating a distinctive local cultural identity in order to be separate from the Chinese nation (neither Chinese civilization, nor the Chinese state). Instead, the local is created to authenticate the national and to claim cultural and historical relevance, if not directly aiming at political and economic prevalence. In the early stage of modern Chinese literature, the native place was often created to articulate Chineseness in order to assess the (negative) Chinese national character to awaken the nation and to assist China’s nation building (Fitzgerald, J. 1996). Hence the creation of local identities was to a large extent a by-product of this prime intention. In recent decades, the native place is created more to articulate regional aspirations for national identiﬁcation. Even Chinese ethnic nativist writing, such as Zhang Chengzhi’s stories of the unbearable plight of the Chinese Muslims (Zhang Chengzhi 2000, 1999) and Alai’s epic of the Tibetan tribal wars (Alai 1998), remains subordinate and subservient to the notion of ‘China’, although it is arguable that this may be a result of selfcensorship under the circumstances. National narration was and still is an important motivation for nativist writing. The diversity of the ‘nativist’ experience of the writers means that the emotional core of China has been located in very different regional areas in different times and traditions. In the continual process of narrating China,\n\nIntroduction 15 the invention, retelling and displacement of various national stories are also a reﬂection of the nation-building agenda of the Chinese communist state at various historical moments. The national identities located in ﬁction will also continue to change. Nevertheless, wherever ‘China’ may be located, whether its identity is rural or urban, narrating China is equated with narrating Chinese cultural traditions, and that entails the constant reconﬁguration of the native place as the locale. Notwithstanding the difference between nativist literature in mainland China, Taiwan and in the Chinese diaspora, it can be discerned that there are broadly four kinds of nativist ﬁction in terms of the type of native place created and the intention of the writing: ﬁrst, writings of the small towns south of the Yangtze River that are intended to capture national defects, as represented by the writings of Lu Xun, Su Tong or Han Shaogong; second, stories about the Chinese frontier and the national exotic as represented by those of Shen Congwen, Zhang Chengzhi; third, romances illustrating the urban popular that also reﬂect the national spirit as shown in the writings of Lao She, Deng Youmei or Feng Jicai; fourth, the Chinese north-west as the national native place in the CCP’s ofﬁcial nativism. We shall examine these four genres in turn. Lu Xun: the southern village and the national defects Lu Xun’s short stories from the initial decades of the twentieth century bring to life two small townships on the Chinese literary landscape, Luzhen and Weizhuang, based on his early experiences in his home town of Shaoxing in Zhejiang province. Luzhen is the narrative setting for many of Lu Xun’s short stories, among which the best known include ‘New Year’s Sacriﬁce’ (Zhufu ) (Lu Xun 1981, v.2: 5–23), ‘Scholar Kong Yiji’ (Kong Yiji ) (Lu Xun 1981, v.1: 434 – 9) and ‘Home Town’ (Guxiang ) (Lu Xun 1981, v.1: 476–86). Weizhuang is where The True Story of Ah Q (Ah Q Zhengzhuan n) (Lu Xun 1981, v.1: 487–532) takes place. Although the two towns are full of local characteristics, ranging from the local landscape, food, language to customs and the practice of belief systems, their symbolism, however, is not meant or taken as the articulation of a regional conscience. Rather, they are drawn and regarded as representative settings for the stagnation of ‘Chinese’ society as a whole, as a result of Lu Xun’s preoccupation with capturing Chinese national characteristics (Liu, Lydia 1995: 60–76). The ordinary townscape surrounded by small rivers, little villages and rice paddies, inhabited by ignorant, pathetic and conservative town dwellers is indispensable for Lu Xun’s ‘national-character’ stories. The localness is characterized through ruptures of the local’s concentration on the day-to-day matters of life by political events on the national scale, which the locals consistently misinterpret. The local landscape and the local social fabric are equally meaningful for the local cultural geography in the sense that the\n\n16 Introduction native place means women gossiping by the river, men drinking in the inn, popular religious rituals practised in households and the narrator’s familiarity with local history. Dominance of traditional values in the daily life of the villagers colours Luzhen and Weizhuang permanently as negative ‘native places’ on the Chinese literary map. About sixty years later, in the tradition of Lu Xun’s south Yangtze village as the archetypal Chinese native place, Su Tong has invented another such location, Maple and Poplar Village (Fengyangshu cun !) in his short stories and novellas between the mid-1980s and the 1990s. Like Luzhen and Weizhuang, Maple and Popular Village is not exactly rural, for the population consists of ‘urban residents’ according to the PRC’s ofﬁcial residential registration. Maple and Popular Village is a community of the most indifferent and selﬁsh people and it is local in the sense that the turbulent social and political changes of modern China do not seem to have any impact on the mentality and lifestyle of the people. The characters are even more hideous and pathetic than the denizens of Luzhen and Weizhuang, for the narrative has effectively eliminated the distinction between the victims and the victimizers. Worse, hostility permeates the small town, where the residents are enemies to the extent that apathy is a virtue. In addition, the narrator hides safely at a distance so that there is no sense of guilt or conscience on the part of anyone and the narrator does not show even a trace of pity for the hopelessness in this location. A maximum of ‘defamiliarization’ through obscure narrative time in ambiguous historical context contributes to Su Tong’s overall target of essentializing and exposing the defects of Chineseness. Han Shaogong is another writer whose narrative focus is close to Lu Xun’s critical approach to ‘Chinese defects’. He also does so by creating a southern rural location – Maqiao Village. Maqiao Village has been featured in a number of Han Shaogong’s writings but most noticeably in his 1996 novel A Dictionary of Maqiao (Maqiao cidian !). The novel attempts an ‘objective’ ethnography by creating a dictionary documenting the important aspects of village life through itemizing Maqiao Village’s key vocabulary – a biography of everything in Maqiao in the author’s own words (Han Shaogong 1996: 68). Writings that locate China in a small town south of the Yangtze are subversive almost by default in the context of the CCP’s national myths, which favour the yellow earth plateau as the origin of the Chinese nation and prescribe the spirit of perseverance as the essence of the Chinese people. Shen Congwen: cultural nostalgia at the national frontier Shen Congwen is another May Fourth writer whose literary conﬁguration of his native place has far-reaching signiﬁcances in a number of ways – in his symbolism of ‘China as a young and brash land’ (Kinkley, J. C. 1995: 1), in his characterization of local people as lively, honest, sincere and endearing\n\nIntroduction 17 and in his narrative language of a poetic mixture of the local and ‘translocal’ vernacular. Coming from west Hunan, an area where people of various ethnicities live and mingle, Shen Congwen asserts that the frontier is the location of Chinese virtues, its innocence deriving from its distance from Han dominance and the cosmopolitan centres. Unlike Lu Xun’s often dumbfounded narrators and inarticulate villagers, Shen Congwen’s narrators do not have an emotional distance from the local people, and his local stories demonstrate a passion for the land, the people and their cultures from ‘within’, that is, from within the community and within the narrator’s own being. Continuing the exploration of the Chinese ‘frontier’ and cultural nostalgia from ‘within’ as both the native place and part of the nation are many writers, most noticeably Alai, Jia Pingwa, Wang Zengqi and Zhang Chengzhi. Mo Yan can also be grouped here with his Red Sorghum series and the creation of Gaomi Village in Shandong province. For this group, their narratives, including the narrator, the characters, the narrative language and narrative devices, all have an intimate relationship with the native place. Lao She: Beijing laneway; and the national spirit A native of Beijing, Lao She writes about the lives of the poor people and popular cultures of the city. His construction of Beijing as a local space for common people is in sharp contrast to the image of Beijing as the national, political and cultural centre inhabited by the elite. His focus is the lifestyle of the working class, and he uses the local language of the lanes (hutong ) rather than of the university campuses. Beijing, as the native place for Lao She’s characters, is very different from Beijing as the narrative background for, say, Ding Ling or Zhang Henshui’s stories. In Lao She’s novels, the local people represent the local place, which is different from treating the place as the coincidental setting for stories to happen. Lao She’s nativist writing is associated with the discourse of China’s nation-building discursively and it is complicated by the duality of the identity of Beijing as both the local and the native place for the natives of Beijing, and as the national centre where state power resides and national politics take place. Beijing’s and Tianjin’s urban popular traditions in time became the subject matter of the ‘urban life literature’ stream of nativist writing in the 1980s. Writers such as Deng Youmei and Feng Jicai produced a number of stories, novellas and novels elaborating on northern urban Chinese culture, echoing the tradition of Lao She’s Beijing-ﬂavoured novels that use strongly local ﬂavoured language with a focus on local customs (Jin Han 1993: 526– 9). Representation of traditional urban Chinese culture is an integral part of the search for China’s cultural roots as it explores other aspects of Chinese cultural identity complementary to the rural components found in the villages. Like the writers who concentrate on representing the rural villages, urban life writers are conscious of their role in unveiling the connection\n\n18 Introduction between urban traditions and the Chinese mentality. Like Lao She, Deng Youmei’s and Feng Jicai’s writings are imbued with colourful local language and customs; however, unlike Lao She’s their ﬁctional world creates fantasies about bygone cultural practices. The CCP: dogma of native place in service to the nation The CCP has a history of inventing the native place for the Chinese nation and for itself, and its rhetoric was especially strong during the Maoist period, roughly between the early 1940s and 1980s, after the launch of Mao’s Yan’an Talks and the beginning of the Deng era. The location of the native place is important for the CCP because it needed to legitimize its self-declared representation of the Chinese people through appropriation of cultural identiﬁcation. The construction of a location for the origin of China that suited the CCP’s goals was therefore an important and signiﬁcant task for creative writers and for the party ideologues in those decades. The CCP’s native-place ideology has inﬂuenced generations of writers with regard to the conceptualization of the native place or its subversion, as later in the case of the ‘root-searching’ literature of the mid-1980s. The CCP favours Shaanxi as the native place of Chinese civilization and articulates a strong identiﬁcation with the empire of Qinshihuang, who, as the King of Qin, uniﬁed China by eliminating the other states by force. The territory of the ancient kingdom of Qin lies within present Shaanxi province, and is characterized by a landscape of the yellow earth plateau. ‘The loess plains of Shaanxi are the birthplace of the Chinese people’, Xia Yan , a CCP veteran, insists, when commenting on the television series River Elegy (Heshang ) (Su Xiaokang 1991) and the ﬁlm Yellow Earth (Huang tudi ) (Barmé, G. R. and Minford, J. 1988: 260). Edward Friedman notes that ‘the People’s Republic of China in the Mao era presented itself as the heir of a Han people who had come together millennia earlier in the North China plain of the Yellow River valley, built a great civilisation, fought to preserve it, and expanded over the centuries by civilising barbarian invaders’ (Friedman, E. 1995: 90). The CCP’s own history also reinforces the myth of Shaanxi as the birthplace of the Chinese nation, since Shaanxi and its adjacent areas were established as the bases of the Chinese communists in the 1930s and 1940s. The ofﬁcially favoured Chinese national character is largely built on the self-sacriﬁcing, industrious peasants in northern Shaanxi incessantly struggling against the harsh environment (Friedman, E. 1995: 330). These assertions of the origins of the Chinese nation have been inﬂuential in the literary construction of a native place for the Chinese nation and for the national character. It was for writers either to conﬁrm or to negate this interpretation by the CCP of the myth of origin for the Chinese nation. Zhao Shuli and Ding Ling were among the earliest to follow the party’s instructions and produced works to connect the Chinese communist revolution with the countryside and the peasants in the 1930s and the 1940s\n\nIntroduction 19 (Feuerwerker, Y. M. 1998). In the process they created a number of northern Chinese villages as the sites of the communist revolution and the birthplace of revolutionary heroes, who are ordinary peasants. To this end, Zhao Shuli cultivated the myth that he was a peasant who became a writer, whereas in fact he was from a wealthy family and had been educated in a high school in the county town. In the ﬁrst decade of the PRC, nativist writings ﬂourished and Zhao Shuli continued to produce similar works in accordance to changing historical circumstances, shifting his focus to writing about the process of collectivization. Many writers also took to the writing of the new village life and the images of ‘socialist new peasants’ in response to the CCP’s call for literary works to reﬂect the images of New China. Liu Qing of Shaanxi, and Zhou Libo of Hunan, among many others, produced a number of novels about the social and political changes that were occurring in rural China at the time. It was imperative for novels on land reform to show how the power structure of the human relationship in the village had changed and that the landscape had been transformed into a new cultural space – the native place of the new Chinese nation. A glance at the titles of the novels produced during the period underscores this point: Ding Ling’s The Sun Shines over the Sanggan River (Taiyang zhao zai Sangganhe shang ! !) (Ding Ling 1949), Zhou Libo’s Hurricane (Baofeng zhouyu ) (Zhou Libo 1949) and Changes in the Mountain Village (Shanxiang jubian !) (Zhou Libo 1958). Until the late 1970s, many of the writings remained focused on the rural society of China and present the village as the most truthful representation of socialist China. Hao Ran’s writing continues with the CCP’s tradition of nativist writing and carries the socialist realism of Maoist ideology to the extreme. Two of his novels are best known for a village landscape of China’s socialist revolution, most appropriately entitled Bright Skies (Yanyang tian ) (Hao Ran 1964 –6) and Road to Glory (Jinguang dadao !) (Hao Ran 1972 – 4). Nativist writing under Maoist ideology presents an idealized landscape of a socialist rural China where negative Chinese cultural traditions have been eradicated. Relationships between the villagers are structured to ﬁt into the Maoist ideology of class division and class struggle. Daily village life is dominated by collective activities and extremely politicized. In the 1990s, the Chinese national story set against the hardship of the yellow earth in and around Shaanxi resurfaces conspicuously with White Deer Plain (Bailu yuan , 1993) by the Shaanxi writer Chen Zhongshi . White Deer Plain has been commonly regarded as a national epic for it returns to the tradition of communist landscaping but adds a charming stretch of modern Chinese history, especially the political battles between the communists and the nationalists. The narrative background is, again, an imaginary terrain situated in rural Shaanxi among enigmatic mountains on the yellow earth plateau along the upper reaches of the Yellow River. The landscape of ‘white deer’ becomes a metaphor to embody the Chinese national character, as it silently endures hardship and war and survives both human\n\n20 Introduction and natural disasters. It unfolds a cultural complex through intimate interactions between two families, the Bais and the Lus. Love and hate, conﬂicts and connections between generations of the two families are tangled with the history of separation and uniﬁcation between the nationalists and the communists. Most characters are cultural stereotypes representing either certain political factions or Chinese values. Two of them are most typical: Bai Jiaxuan , the peasant patriarch, and Scholar Zhu , the village sage. As head of the Bai clan, Bai Jiaxuan marries seven times to produce descendants for the family. His ﬁrst six wives all die within one year of marriage as victims of his powerful penis. His seventh wife survives and bears him three sons and a daughter. Bai Jiaxuan, outstandingly potent, is presented as the mythical mighty patriarch and the symbol of the enduring Chinese race. White Deer Plain presents a close link between the land and the national spirit. It not only lends the CCP its much needed legitimacy but also reinforces the myth that the CCP had been fabricating for decades: the native place for the modern Chinese nation is Shaanxi, which is also China’s ‘true’ ancestral place. In commenting on the emergence of a Chinese ‘Western’ literature by writers from Xinjiang, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Shaanxi and Tibet, Zhu Hong points out that as one of the most compelling schools of contemporary ﬁction in China, the Western presents a truthful description of the region – its bleakness and barbarity on one hand, its native strength and unsullied beauty on the other. The genre resurrects all the conﬂicts that are raised by the new changes – and it depicts the Chinese themselves differently. Charged with melancholy and the burden of history, the stories portray vital, resilient men and women, committed to survival. (Zhu Hong 1988: ix) If linked with Zhu Hong’s remarks, the aim of White Deer Plain to create a generic native place for modern China becomes very clear. This book won the Mao Dun Prize for novels in 1995 and the author was soon appointed the Chairman of the Shaanxi Writers Association. White Deer Plain proves to be the most articulate of the CCP’s ideal for the native place of the Chinese nation.\n\nJia Pingwa: Shangzhou and the nativist style An outstanding feature of Jia Pingwa’s writing is his conscious and deliberate cultivation of the link among his narratives, his native place and Chinese cultural traditions. Up to 2005, seven of his ten novels and the majority of his short stories have been set in Shangzhou, in which the native place plays two central roles: as both the narrative background and the central ﬁgure. Jia Pingwa maps his native place geographically, historically and\n\nIntroduction 21 anthropologically with a ﬁrm conviction that he is creating a more ‘authentic China’ through Shaanxi, because Shaanxi is where China originated and therefore the local is straightforwardly national and ‘there would never have been China without Shangzhou’ (Jia Pingwa 1995d, v.1: 2). Linguistically, Jia Pingwa holds that the Shaanxi local language has retained many elements and characteristics of the ancient Chinese language, many of which have been lost in other regions of China. Culturally, he believes the locals have kept alive many traces of Chinese traditions and that local Shaanxi folklore reﬂects the traditional Chinese practice of indigenous religions and belief systems. Dynasties rose and fell within the boundaries of Shaanxi, and Jia Pingwa is proud of famous local scholars who were at the same time scholars of national importance as cornerstones of Chinese civilization, such as Shang Yang (390–338 BCE), the statesman whose earlier political measures assisted the ﬁrst emperor in China’s uniﬁcation at around 200 BCE, Sima Qian (145–85 BCE), the ﬁrst renowned Chinese historian, and Sun Simiao (581–682), the medical practitioner and author of highly inﬂuential medical books. The connection between China’s origin, culture and history and Shangzhou’s past and present allows Jia Pingwa to legitimize the localisation of China in Shangzhou. Jia Pingwa’s quest for a Shangzhou identity has not been a deliberate action against the CCP ideology of class struggle, as those of many other root-searching writers have been, especially during the 1980s (Lee, Leo 1994: 221). He genuinely believes in the cultural relevance of his native place to Chinese nationhood and regards it as his mission to reassert Shangzhou’s place on the cultural map of China. He talks at length about Shangzhou’s historical signiﬁcance in China’s nation-building in ‘The Preface to First Records of Shangzhou’ (Shangzhou chulu yinyan !\"#) (Jia Pingwa 1998c, v.5: 76–84). Lai Daren conﬁrms the distinctive difference between Jia Pingwa and other writers who are usually grouped into the school of native-soil or root-searching literature by highlighting Jia Pingwa’s deliberation and commitment to his native place: it took more than six years for him to carry out an investigation of his native place, especially its cultural history and social fabric, before he wrote ‘First Records of Shangzhou’ (Lai Daren 2000: 36–7). In my view, Jia Pingwa’s nativist stories stand out in the Chinese nativist writings also because he was part of the local scene and was able to engage with the local people. His writings are able to probe deeply into the value systems of Shangzhou’s rural social fabric, despite his realist intention to reﬂect the social reality of rural China. Jia Pingwa’s literary nativism is a different kind of root-searching and in many ways it deliberately detaches itself from current political affairs. Above all, Jia Pingwa began his quest from within himself while others were engaged in cultivating a ‘naturist’ approach for the purpose of resisting the CCP’s dominant ideologies in their writings. The aim of narrating China with local stories emerged only gradually into Jia Pingwa’s consciousness. His earlier exploration of his native rural\n\n22 Introduction environment slowly evolves into his later thematic concerns and stylistic development, and he becomes increasingly focused on ‘Chinese mentality’ and the ‘national spirit’ as he advances in his writing career (Jia Pingwa 1994j: 65–6). The author’s being a native of Shaanxi, his background as a peasant, his cultivation of classical Chinese literature and other literary skills and tastes, his search for the meaning of life in the regions of China through Taoism and Buddhism, his language skills in Shaanxi local expressions, modern and classical Chinese language, all become relevant to his desire and ability to narrate China. Writing about the native place serves Jia Pingwa’s goal of narrating China effectively, for it not only provides his cultural China with a tangible and emotional location but also equips him with the abundance of regional resources that serve as motifs for his writing. Jia Pingwa is regarded as one of the writers who initiated ‘root-searching’ with his ‘First Records of Shangzhou’ (Xu Zidong 1996). To map his native place culturally was his preoccupation since the early stage of his writing in the late 1970s until he became an important part of the literary trend that sought to essentialize China since the early 1980s. Over the decades Jia Pingwa’s literary nativism aims at constructing a cultural China that transcends history and politics and, in this sense, his ‘national narration’ is not one of the straightforward ‘national allegories’ as referred to by Fredric Jameson’s reading of Third World literature (Jameson, F. 1986). Far from it: the scope and the depth of Shangzhou stories can only begin to be grasped if they are seen as literary regional ethnography, since he is concerned with a cultural China that can be manifested through narrative traditions and the traditions of daily living by locals. Hence, Jia Pingwa’s cultural mapping details the quotidian of the local life, the passions, concerns and anxieties of the local people and the lyrics of the local landscape. At the same time, Jia Pingwa distances himself from China’s political, cosmopolitan centres, such as Beijing, Shanghai or Guangzhou, unlike say Mo Yan or Yu Hua, two other writers who came to prominence in China in the late 1980s. Both Mo Yan and Yu Hua moved to live in Beijing by the end of the 1980s for professional and family reasons. Jia Pingwa, on the contrary, is determined to stay in Xi’an, Shaanxi, despite the opportunities for him to resettle elsewhere. Retaining his cultural loyalty to his native place has been a priority to him, because he sees an organic tie between his literary output, his cultural belonging and his native place. However, although he identiﬁes himself with the peasants of Shaanxi and most of his characters are villagers, Jia Pingwa never locates his ideal reader among his village fellows. Instead, from the early stages of his career, when he held editorial positions with magazines published in Xi’an, he was publishing in the big cosmopolitan centres of Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. Jia Pingwa writes local stories in order to be a national writer and he reaches the centre and the wider community through his local stories. On the basis of his discovery of strong connections between localism and the Chinese nation, historian Peter Bol asserts that there was a rise of\n\nIntroduction 23 localism as early as Southern Song ‘for the nation exists in the ﬁrst place as a collection of localities, and the commonality that makes a nation possible is instantiated in the shared categories with which local uniqueness is constructed’ (Bol, P. 2001: 76). Bol believes that growth of local wealth in the southern coastal areas gave rise to localism in the sense that the local gentry stopped identifying with the central bureaucracy and instead emphasized their own links with different schools of thought locally. It is not clear if Jia Pingwa is aware of any such localist literati traditions in his native Shaanxi but his literary nativism shows a similar tendency. He deliberately seeks connections with local, historical and cultural ﬁgures signiﬁcant in China’s national history and restages their presence in reconﬁgurations of Shaanxi’s cultural signiﬁcance within the national context. Claiming to be a country man, Jia Pingwa has been determined that his articulation of ‘Chineseness’ should be based on his native place, which in turn substantiates his assertion that his native cultural space is the ‘authentic’ China. Shaanxi’s local popular culture and the local practice of traditional Chinese high culture are indispensable elements in Jia’s conﬁguration of a cultural China through local narratives. Jia Pingwa’s writing demonstrates a close association with both popular aspects and literati cultivation of Chinese narrative traditions. On the one hand there is the contemporary writer Jia Pingwa from Shaanxi, whose novels and stories are situated in Shaanxi with a focus on local landscape, folk cultures, local villagers and residents, and their social aspirations. On the other hand, there is the literatus Jia Pingwa, whose imagination goes beyond Shaanxi as he envisages a China from Shaanxi and articulates a traditional literati aesthetic that encompasses poetry, essays, ink-painting and calligraphy. These two seemingly contradictory tendencies in fact complement each other well, for, as far as his literary nativism is concerned, they suit his ultimate objective of narrating China. In his presentation, the local Shaanxi popular culture and the centralist literati high culture constitute the multilayered dimensions of a complete and accomplished civilization that is highly indicative of what he sees as ‘Chinese’ and as the ‘essence’ of Chinese cultural traditions. Jia Pingwa’s narrative focus on Shaanxi does not mean that his ‘nativism’ is limited to his native place. Equally important is that the narrative goal of Shangzhou stories is not to articulate a unique Shaanxi separate from mainstream Chinese traditions but to convey a vision of China projected from the author’s native Shaanxi. Jia Pingwa’s rural Shaanxi is by implication all of rural China, for Shaanxi and its capital Xi’an are part of the birthplace of the Chinese myth of the yellow earth plateau. The saga of Shaanxi peasants also easily stretches out to the larger part of the Chinese population, and it coincides with the more recent CCP-fabricated myth of a Chinese national identity built on the self-sacriﬁcing, industrious peasants. In other words, although it may never have been Jia Pingwa’s intention to ﬁctionalize Chinese communist nationalism, his early nativist works on Shangzhou are in\n\n24 Introduction tune with this spirit. Jia Pingwa’s earlier publications were also in step with the emerging Chinese ‘Western’ literature and arts of the 1980s (Zhu Hong 1988). This book presents Jia Pingwa’s continuous quest for Chinese cultural traditions and traditional Chinese narrative forms and asserts that he has succeeded in telling the Chinese national stories about his native place in his distinctive narrative style. Jia Pingwa’s ties with his ‘native place’ are not only emotional, cultural and textual but also highly pragmatic. At the age of ﬁfty-two, his home village and Xi’an are the only places he has lived in, although he has increasingly travelled elsewhere inside China since the mid-1980s. He travelled to Hong Kong and the United States once on his way to receive the American Mobil Pegasus Prize in 1988 for Turbulence. He also prefers the cuisine of Shaanxi to that of anywhere else. To a large extent, despite his national fame, Jia Pingwa remains still a Shaanxi local and is reluctant to adapt to other environments and lifestyles. For years, there has been a self-imposed limit to his exposure to the outside world and he has cultivated a proud ‘provinciality’ in his lifestyle in addition to a demonstration of primitive nativism in his literary pursuit. Another signiﬁcant aspect of Shangzhou’s stories is the author’s attachment to the local language. Jia Pingwa ﬁnds it difﬁcult to speak Mandarin (the standard common Chinese speech, based on the speech of Beijing), nor is he interested in trying.15 His native tongue bears the birthmark of a villager that can make it awkward in his social life with non-locals. Feeling inadequate because of his ‘country bumpkin’ accent and unattractive appearance, Jia Pingwa is at the same time proud of his rural background and regionality. He deliberately adopts many local expressions in his writing and puts effort into making Shaanxi local language a signiﬁcant part of his narrative style and of his scheme to narrate China. So far Jia Pingwa’s narrative background has been either villages in the Shangzhou prefecture, or the city of Xi’an, or both. His latest novel, Health Report (Jia Pingwa 2002b), has, for the ﬁrst time, mobile characters who, for one reason or another, have to travel outside the author’s familiar zone of southern Shaanxi and Xi’an into northern Shaanxi and other parts of China. Shangzhou, in turn, also provides the identity for the writer and for his writing. A number of the titles of his writings have direct reference to Shangzhou, such as his ﬁrst novel, Shangzhou, and his prose essays collection, ‘Three Records of Shangzhou’. In 1995, Huaxia Publishing House published a four-volume collection of Jia Pingwa’s works under the title Shangzhou: The Story Continues. The collection highlights the importance of Shangzhou as a literary space where local customs and country life are inspiration, resource and subjects of Jia Pingwa’s writing. Jia Pingwa’s preface to this collection lays special emphasis on Shangzhou’s cultural signiﬁcance to his works. Jia Pingwa’s subsequent writing is also directly and indirectly connected with Shangzhou. He says this himself: ‘Shangzhou constitutes my very being as a writer’ (Jia Pingwa 1995d, v.1: 2).\n\nIntroduction 25 Oral stories of Shangzhou locals provide the raw material of Jia Pingwa’s writing, and Jia Pingwa regards the mythological colour of these stories as ‘indigenous’ magic realism of the Shangzhou region. The local language, which retains a large number of ancient Chinese vocabulary items and syntactical structures, according to the writer himself, shapes the narrative language used in his retelling of Shangzhou stories. The fundamental role of Shangzhou as the basis on which Jia Pingwa builds his subject matter and style is summarized by Jia Pingwa: ‘I didn’t do much study of classical Chinese, or deliberately play the game of magic realism. It is Shangzhou itself that has provided me with all I have offered’ (Jia Pingwa 1995d, v.1: 3). The spiritual importance of Shangzhou is reiterated in Jia Pingwa’s identiﬁcation of himself as a Shangzhouren, a Shangzhou local, searching for a Chinese narrative in the language and culture of Shangzhou, and in the continued presence of Shangzhou in his writing over more than twenty years. Shangzhou, the ancient name for the area, was also resurrected by Jia Pingwa’s creative writing. The place was called Shangxian until a decade ago and the local government changed it back to Shangzhou because Jia Pingwa’s writing had made the place nationally famous and it started attracting tourists. However, it remains remote to modern society in the sense that a railway still has not reached the area and there is only one very basic road to connect it to the outside world. Still, it has served as a local centre where information is gathered and disseminated to more isolated areas. It is the gateway through which Jia Pingwa was led to the wider world. Jia Pingwa exercises his aesthetic imagination in Shangzhou. Shangzhou is both real and imaginary as a native place to which the writer constantly returns physically and mentally for artistic inspiration. In summary, Jia Pingwa’s nativist ﬁction demonstrates many characteristics and traditions of the nativist writing in modern Chinese ﬁction since the 1910s, including attachment to the land, resentment of its backwardness, love for its primitive passions, customs of small villages and country towns as well as popular urban traditions. Bringing together a material reality of the local place, the Shangzhou stories have been established as a literary institution of the native place for Jia Pingwa’s goals of literary nativism and for the purpose of narrating China. This literary institution has three components: a literary ethnography of Shangzhou, a narrative infrastructure informed by classical Chinese narrative traditions and a narrative language that, by avoiding as much as possible traces of Europeanization and Maoist discourse, retains the beauty and musicality of the Chinese language.\n\n26\n\n2\n\nThe life and career of Jia Pingwa\n\nThe life and career of Jia Pingwa\n\nJia Pingwa’s literary career is still unfolding and, more likely than not, it will continue to unfold in unexpected ways. He has constantly transcended and reinvented himself as a writer over the last three decades. Just over ﬁfty, he has yet years of writing life ahead of him and it is highly unpredictable in which direction his writing will develop. Currently, he has just ﬁnished another major novel and is anxiously awaiting the authorization for the release of Defunct Capital. What can be said with certainty is that Jia Pingwa will continue to write and that his writing will continue to be innovative and transcend boundaries. He perceives an obstruction to the potential depth of contemporary Chinese literature and considers removing it as the most difﬁcult task he and other Chinese writers face. In his view, Chinese literature is limited because there is a limit to the depth of experience in contemporary Chinese life, which in turn leads to limited depths as articulated by individual writers in the Chinese language and Chinese narrative traditions.1 Jia Pingwa, nevertheless, is one of the few writers who began publishing in the 1970s and have remained proliﬁc until the present. In more than three decades of writing, Jia Pingwa has travelled a long distance, intellectually, aesthetically and emotionally, if not physically.\n\nBirth, naming and growth2 Jia Pingwa comes from the heartland of rural Shaanxi. He spent his childhood and early youth in the small village of Dihua (Cherry Blossom) in Danfeng (Red Phoenix) county of Shangzhou prefecture in southern Shaanxi. He was born in 1952 into an extended family of about twenty members, most of whom were peasants working on the land. The extended family was extremely poor, found it difﬁcult to manage, and eventually split into several households. There was not enough food for everyone and the spectre of starvation haunted Jia Pingwa’s childhood and teenage years to the extent that he believes his ill health is a result of malnutrition during that period. Jia Pingwa’s father Jia Yanchun was a village teacher and often posted away from the home village so that his mother managed the household\n\nThe life and career of Jia Pingwa\n\n27\n\nwhile also working on the land. There are four siblings in the family and Jia Pingwa is the eldest with one younger brother and two younger sisters. Although seldom at home, the father’s inﬂuence over Jia Pingwa was overwhelming, not least because the father taught him reading and writing before his schooling. The paternal ethics and values have channelled Jia Pingwa’s outlook and inspired him to aim at higher goals. In a poem, ‘My Father’ (Wode fuqin !) (1985), Jia Pingwa writes in praise of his father’s devotion to teaching and his high standard of professionalism (Jia Pingwa 1998c, v.12: 428–32). During the Cultural Revolution (1966–76) Jia Yanchun was persecuted as a ‘counter-revolutionary’ and for a while lost the income vital to the family.3 The father’s misfortune plunged the family into dire poverty and to the bottom of the social hierarchy, and this period of misery had a lasting impact on the son mentally, physically and professionally. Jia Yanchun himself suffered severe depression as a result of the political persecution, took to drinking and subsequently died of stomach cancer in 1989. Jia Pingwa pays a very emotional tribute to his father in his memoir ‘Mourning My Father’ (Jifu ) (Jia Pingwa 1998c, v.12: 197–207). The name of Jia Pingwa’s mother is Zhou Xiao’e , which, as he recalls, he came to know only by accident, because no one ever addressed her by that name (Jia Pingwa 1998c, v.13: 60–5).4 His mother lived most of her life in the village until he moved her to Xi’an a few years ago and she now lives with one of her daughters in an apartment not far from his own home. Jia Pingwa holds enormous respect for his mother and considers her a great teacher of life. The most memorable thing for him is how she taught him about ‘endurance’ – how to endure the most unbearable at a young age. She set her children a good example when she, in poor health, heroically shouldered the burden of feeding the family with almost no income when her husband was in custody. Jia Pingwa mentions his mother in a number of his essays and memoirs but the most informative is the piece called ‘I am Not a Good Son’ (Wo bushi ge hao erzi !\"#$) (Jia Pingwa 1998c, v.13: 60–5). The hardship and the parental love Jia Pingwa experienced in his formative years would later become useful resources for his future life. They are the basis of the bond between him and his native place, which in time turns out to be a valuable inspiration for his writing. Many myths surround Jia Pingwa’s birth and naming, which, in popular belief, are related to his creativity one way or another, and many critics in China have made serious attempts at studying those myths. Before his birth, his mother had a prenatal consultation with a village fortune-teller. She was anxious because her ﬁrst child had died soon after birth. The advice was that she should go into labour not at home but at the neighbouring village of Jinpen (Golden Bowl), which should bring good luck to the baby. After birth, the child should be given a plain name to distract the attention of demons and to allow for a safe growth. Consequently his mother named him ‘Pingwa ’, ordinary boy, which he later changed to its pun, ‘Pingwa ’, meaning ‘level and uneven’.5 The late Shanghai critic Hu Heqing\n\n28\n\nThe life and career of Jia Pingwa\n\noffers a detailed study of the possible connotations of Jia Pingwa’s name from a Taoist perspective (Hu Heqing 1994: 38–9). Hu Heqing regards the change of the characters as a magic transformation, for ‘level and uneven’ reﬂects a Taoist balance of natural elements: ‘ping’ refers to ﬂat, unshaded places and therefore implies the element of yang, whereas ‘wa’, the indented surface, is hidden from the sun and naturally stands for the element of yin. ‘Pingwa’ hence achieves the most desirable balance between yin and yang. The interpretation of Jia Pingwa’s naming has been part of the process contributing to his public persona. Hu Heqing insists that, in order to retain his success, Jia Pingwa should never leave Shaanxi, because his family name Jia consists of two characters: underneath the character ‘xi ’, meaning ‘west’, is the character ‘bei ’ (which originally meant ‘cowrie shell’ but has been extended to mean ‘treasure’, because it was an ancient form of currency). ‘Xi ’ also coincides with the second character in the name of the province Shaanxi, that is, Shaan-‘xi ’ and its location in western China. Hence Jia’s name can be seen as a parody of ‘treasure in China’s west’. Hu Heqing says that he has reason to believe that Jia Pingwa has been well aware of this. In addition, ‘pingwa’ can also be read as a verb–object phrase to mean ‘levelling the uneven’. Jia Pingwa’s name thus forms a picture of the most admired fengshui – treasure comes out of the land in the west, with yin-yang elements balanced. In conjunction with his birthplace Golden Bowl, Jia Pingwa’s destiny as a successful writer echoes a Chinese popular belief – ‘A golden bowl produces noble sons’ (Jinpen chu guizi !\"). In a critical biography of Jia Pingwa, Lai Daren makes further comments on Jia Pingwa’s name (Lai Daren 2000: 15 –18). He begins with Jia Pingwa’s own choice of the unusual character ‘’, which should be pronounced as ‘ao’ according to the standard pronunciation but in the Shaanxi local language is pronounced as ‘wa’.6 This out-of-the-way character, though hard to pronounce, is very easy to remember. Lai Daren summarizes four points in the popular explanations of how Jia Pingwa’s name has led to his literary success. First, the character is shaped like an ancient silver coin so that it is certain to channel in treasures. Second, ‘pingwa’ indicates a ﬂat stretch of land with an indentation for storing water, hence the focus on the landscape and good fengshui. Third, the character ‘’ has three connotations, which are all ‘productive’ in nature: it refers to a water container waiting to be ﬁlled; it means that the subject is modest and willing to learn; and it entails a lack in the shape, which in time becomes good fortune. Fourth, from a Buddhist perspective, the empty space in the middle of the character shows a spirited, Buddhist touch. Jia Pingwa is therefore destined to succeed (Lai Daren 2000: 16).\n\nThe rising phoenix Jia Pingwa was a good student and his talent for writing was noticed by his teachers from the time when he was a child. His initial creative success in\n\nThe life and career of Jia Pingwa\n\n29\n\nwriting came when he volunteered to edit a newsposter for a production brigade at the construction site of a reservoir shortly after the Cultural Revolution forced all the students out of the local high school. At nineteen he had the opportunity to leave his native village for Xi’an, the provincial capital of Shaanxi, to enter the Chinese Department of Northwestern University (Xibei daxue !) as one of the many peasants, workers and soldiers selected from the countryside, workplace and army. This was the direct outcome of the CCP’s policy implemented between 1970 and 1976, when national tertiary entrance examinations were stopped and students were selected by local authorities. For a peasant boy from a family with a problematical political identity, this was especially fortunate and he greatly cherished the opportunity. Devoting much of his university time to creative writing, he eventually started publishing in the local newspapers, which paved the way for his future ca"
