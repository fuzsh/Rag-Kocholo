        "text": "Kinematics and dynamics analysis of a quadruped walking robot with parallel leg mechanism\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Hongbo; Sang, Lingfeng; Hu, Xing; Zhang, Dianfan; Yu, Hongnian\n\n2013-09-01\n\nIt is desired to require a walking robot for the elderly and the disabled to have large capacity, high stiffness, stability, etc. However, the existing walking robots cannot achieve these requirements because of the weight-payload ratio and simple function. Therefore, Improvement of enhancing capacity and functions of the walking robot is an important research issue. According to walking requirements and combining modularization and reconfigurable ideas, a quadruped/biped reconfigurable walking robot with parallel leg mechanism is proposed. The proposed robot can be used for both a biped and a quadruped walking robot. The kinematics and performance analysis of a 3-UPU parallel mechanism which is the basic leg mechanism of a quadruped walking robot are conducted and the structural parameters are optimized. The results show that performance of the walking robot is optimal when the circumradius R, r of the upper and lower platform of leg mechanism are 161.7 mm, 57.7 mm, respectively. Based on the optimal results, the kinematics and dynamics of the quadruped walking robot in the static walking mode are derived with the application of parallel mechanism and influence coefficient theory, and the optimal coordination distribution of the dynamic load for the quadruped walking robot with over-determinate inputs is analyzed, which solves dynamic load coupling caused by the branchesâ constraint of the robot in the walk process. Besides laying a theoretical foundation for development of the prototype, the kinematics and dynamics studies on the quadruped walking robot also boost the theoretical research of the quadruped walking and the practical applications of parallel mechanism.\n\nDevelopment of a 3D parallel mechanism robot arm with three vertical-axial pneumatic actuators combined with a stereo vision system.\n\nPubMed\n\nChiang, Mao-Hsiung; Lin, Hao-Ting\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis study aimed to develop a novel 3D parallel mechanism robot driven by three vertical-axial pneumatic actuators with a stereo vision system for path tracking control. The mechanical system and the control system are the primary novel parts for developing a 3D parallel mechanism robot. In the mechanical system, a 3D parallel mechanism robot contains three serial chains, a fixed base, a movable platform and a pneumatic servo system. The parallel mechanism are designed and analyzed first for realizing a 3D motion in the X-Y-Z coordinate system of the robot's end-effector. The inverse kinematics and the forward kinematics of the parallel mechanism robot are investigated by using the Denavit-Hartenberg notation (D-H notation) coordinate system. The pneumatic actuators in the three vertical motion axes are modeled. In the control system, the Fourier series-based adaptive sliding-mode controller with H(â) tracking performance is used to design the path tracking controllers of the three vertical servo pneumatic actuators for realizing 3D path tracking control of the end-effector. Three optical linear scales are used to measure the position of the three pneumatic actuators. The 3D position of the end-effector is then calculated from the measuring position of the three pneumatic actuators by means of the kinematics. However, the calculated 3D position of the end-effector cannot consider the manufacturing and assembly tolerance of the joints and the parallel mechanism so that errors between the actual position and the calculated 3D position of the end-effector exist. In order to improve this situation, sensor collaboration is developed in this paper. A stereo vision system is used to collaborate with the three position sensors of the pneumatic actuators. The stereo vision system combining two CCD serves to measure the actual 3D position of the end-effector and calibrate the error between the actual and the calculated 3D position of the end-effector.

The stereo vision 3D position measurement system aims to measure the 3D trajectories of the end-effector of the robot arm. To track the end-effector of the robot arm, the circle detection algorithm is used to detect the desired target and the SAD algorithm is used to track the moving target and to search the corresponding target location along the conjugate epipolar line in the stereo pair. After camera calibration, both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the stereo rig can be obtained, so images can be rectified according to the camera parameters. Thus, through the epipolar rectification, the stereo matching process is reduced to a horizontal search along the conjugate epipolar line. Finally, 3D trajectories of the end-effector are computed by stereo triangulation. The experimental results show that the stereo vision 3D position measurement system proposed in this paper can successfully track and measure the fifth-order polynomial trajectory and sinusoidal trajectory of the end-effector of the three- axial pneumatic parallel mechanism robot arm.

The foot trajectories of twenty healthy participants have been measured by a Vicon system during the performing of four different exercises. Based on the kinematics and dynamics of a parallel robot, a MATLAB program was developed in order to calculate the length of the actuators, the actuators' forces, workspace, and singularity locus of the robot during the performing of the exercises. The calculated length of the actuators and the actuators' forces were used by motion analysis in SolidWorks in order to simulate different foot trajectories by the CAD model of the robot. A physical parallel robot prototype was built in order to simulate and execute the foot trajectories of the participants. Kinect camera was used to track the motion of the leg's model placed on the robot. The results demonstrate the robot's capability to perform a full range of various rehabilitation exercises.\n\nParallel Robot for Lower Limb Rehabilitation Exercises\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSaadat, Mozafar; Borboni, Alberto\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the capability of a 6-DoF parallel robot to perform various rehabilitation exercises.

The quality of ultrasound images is often dependent on the skill of the sonographer. Several researchers have proposed robotic systems to aid in ultrasound image acquisition. In this paper we first provide a short overview of robot-assisted ultrasound imaging (US). We categorize robot-assisted US imaging systems into three approaches: autonomous US imaging, teleoperated US imaging, and human-robot cooperation. For each approach several systems are introduced and briefly discussed. We then describe a compact six degree of freedom parallel mechanism telerobotic system for ultrasound imaging developed by our research team. The long-term goal of this work is to enable remote ultrasound scanning through teleoperation. This parallel mechanism allows for both translation and rotation of an ultrasound probe mounted on the top plate along with force control. Our experimental results confirmed good mechanical system performance with a positioning error of < 1 mm. Phantom experiments by a radiologist showed promising results with good image quality.\n\nParallel-distributed mobile robot simulator\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOkada, Hiroyuki; Sekiguchi, Minoru; Watanabe, Nobuo\n\n1996-06-01\n\nThe aim of this project is to achieve an autonomous learning and growth function based on active interaction with the real world. It should also be able to autonomically acquire knowledge about the context in which jobs take place, and how the jobs are executed. This article describes a parallel distributed movable robot system simulator with an autonomous learning and growth function. The autonomous learning and growth function which we are proposing is characterized by its ability to learn and grow through interaction with the real world. When the movable robot interacts with the real world, the system compares the virtual environment simulation with the interaction result in the real world. The system then improves the virtual environment to match the real-world result more closely. This the system learns and grows. It is very important that such a simulation is time- realistic. The parallel distributed movable robot simulator was developed to simulate the space of a movable robot system with an autonomous learning and growth function. The simulator constructs a virtual space faithful to the real world and also integrates the interfaces between the user, the actual movable robot and the virtual movable robot. Using an ultrafast CG (computer graphics) system (FUJITSU AG series), time-realistic 3D CG is displayed.\n\nBiomimetic shoulder complex based on 3-PSS/S spherical parallel mechanism\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHou, Yulei; Hu, Xinzhe; Zeng, Daxing; Zhou, Yulin\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe application of the parallel mechanism is still limited in the humanoid robot fields, and the existing parallel humanoid robot joint has not yet been reflected the characteristics of the parallel mechanism completely, also failed to solve the problem, such as small workspace, effectively. From the structural and functional bionic point of view, a three degrees of freedom(DOFs) spherical parallel mechanism for the shoulder complex of the humanoid robot is presented. According to the structure and kinetic characteristics analysis of the human shoulder complex, 3-PSS/S(P for prismatic pair, S for spherical pair) is chosen as the original configuration for the shouder complex. Using genetic algorithm, the optimization of the 3-PSS/S spherical parallel mechanism is performed, and the orientation workspace of the prototype mechanism is enlarged obviously. Combining the practical structure characteristics of the human shouder complex, an offset output mode, which means the output rod of the mechanism turn to any direction at the point a certain distance from the rotation center of the mechanism, is put forward, which provide possibility for the consistent of the workspace of the mechanism and the actual motion space of the human body shoulder joint. The relationship of the attitude angles between different coordinate system is derived, which establishs the foundation for the motion descriptions under different conditions and control development. The 3-PSS/S spherical parallel mechanism is proposed for the shoulder complex, and the consistence of the workspace of the mechanism and the human shoulder complex is realized by the stuctural parameter optimization and the offset output design.\n\nParallel elastic elements improve energy efficiency on the STEPPR bipedal walking robot\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nMazumdar, Anirban; Spencer, Steven J.; Hobart, Clinton; ...\n\n2016-11-23\n\nThis study describes how parallel elastic elements can be used to reduce energy consumption in the electric motor driven, fully-actuated, STEPPR bipedal walking robot without compromising or significantly limiting locomotive behaviors. A physically motivated approach is used to illustrate how selectively-engaging springs for hip adduction and ankle flexion predict benefits for three different flat ground walking gaits: human walking, human-like robot walking and crouched robot walking. Based on locomotion data, springs are designed and substantial reductions in power consumption are demonstrated using a bench dynamometer. These lessons are then applied to STEPPR (Sandia Transmission-Efficient Prototype Promoting Research), a fully actuatedmoreÂ Â» bipedal robot designed to explore the impact of tailored joint mechanisms on walking efficiency. Featuring high-torque brushless DC motors, efficient low-ratio transmissions, and high fidelity torque control, STEPPR provides the ability to incorporate novel joint-level mechanisms without dramatically altering high level control. Unique parallel elastic designs are incorporated into STEPPR, and walking data shows that hip adduction and ankle flexion springs significantly reduce the required actuator energy at those joints for several gaits. These results suggest that parallel joint springs offer a promising means of supporting quasi-static joint torques due to body mass during walking, relieving motors of the need to support these torques and substantially improving locomotive energy efficiency.Â«Â less\n\nParallel elastic elements improve energy efficiency on the STEPPR bipedal walking robot\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMazumdar, Anirban; Spencer, Steven J.; Hobart, Clinton\n\nThis study describes how parallel elastic elements can be used to reduce energy consumption in the electric motor driven, fully-actuated, STEPPR bipedal walking robot without compromising or significantly limiting locomotive behaviors.

Rehabilitation of patients suffering from ankle joint dysfunctions such as drop foot is vital and therefore has called for the development of newer robotic devices. Several robotic orthoses and parallel ankle robots have been developed during the last two decades to augment the conventional ankle physical therapy of patients. A comprehensive review of these robotic ankle rehabilitation devices is presented in this article. Recent developments in the mechanism design, actuation and control are discussed. The study encompasses robotic devices for treadmill and over-ground training as well as platform-based parallel ankle robots. Control strategies for these robotic devices are deliberated in detail with an emphasis on the assist-as-needed training strategies. Experimental evaluations of the mechanism designs and various control strategies of these robotic ankle rehabilitation devices are also presented.\n\nDynamic modeling of parallel robots for computed-torque control implementation\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCodourey, A.\n\n1998-12-01\n\nIn recent years, increased interest in parallel robots has been observed. Their control with modern theory, such as the computed-torque method, has, however, been restrained, essentially due to the difficulty in establishing a simple dynamic model that can be calculated in real time. In this paper, a simple method based on the virtual work principle is proposed for modeling parallel robots. The mass matrix of the robot, needed for decoupling control strategies, does not explicitly appear in the formulation; however, it can be computed separately, based on kinetic energy considerations. The method is applied to the DELTA parallel robot, leadingmoreÂ Â» to a very efficient model that has been implemented in a real-time computed-torque control algorithm.Â«Â less\n\nContinuum Reconfigurable Parallel Robots for Surgery: Shape Sensing and State Estimation with Uncertainty.\n\nPubMed\n\nAnderson, Patrick L; Mahoney, Arthur W; Webster, Robert J\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThis paper examines shape sensing for a new class of surgical robot that consists of parallel flexible structures that can be reconfigured inside the human body. Known as CRISP robots, these devices provide access to the human body through needle-sized entry points, yet can be configured into truss-like structures capable of dexterous movement and large force application. They can also be reconfigured as needed during a surgical procedure. Since CRISP robots are elastic, they will deform when subjected to external forces or other perturbations. In this paper, we explore how to combine sensor information with mechanics-based models for CRISP robots to estimate their shapes under applied loads. The end result is a shape sensing framework for CRISP robots that will enable future research on control under applied loads, autonomous motion, force sensing, and other robot behaviors.\n\nIssues of planning trajectory of parallel robots taking into account zones of singularity\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRybak, L. A.; Khalapyan, S. Y.; Gaponenko, E. V.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nA method for determining the design characteristics of a parallel robot necessary to provide specified parameters of its working space that satisfy the controllability requirement is developed. The experimental verification of the proposed method was carried out using an approximate planar 3-RPR mechanism.\n\nConceptual design of a hybrid parallel mechanism for mask exchanging of TMT\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Jianping; Zhou, Hongfei; Li, Kexuan; Zhou, Zengxiang; Zhai, Chao\n\n2015-10-01\n\nMask exchange system is an important part of the Multi-Object Broadband Imaging Echellette (MOBIE) on the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). To solve the problem of stiffness changing with the gravity vector of the mask exchange system in the MOBIE, the hybrid parallel mechanism design method was introduced into the whole research. By using the characteristics of high stiffness and precision of parallel structure, combined with large moving range of serial structure, a conceptual design of a hybrid parallel mask exchange system based on 3-RPS parallel mechanism was presented. According to the position requirements of the MOBIE, the SolidWorks structure model of the hybrid parallel mask exchange robot was established and the appropriate installation position without interfering with the related components and light path in the MOBIE of TMT was analyzed. Simulation results in SolidWorks suggested that 3-RPS parallel platform had good stiffness property in different gravity vector directions. Furthermore, through the research of the mechanism theory, the inverse kinematics solution of the 3-RPS parallel platform was calculated and the mathematical relationship between the attitude angle of moving platform and the angle of ball-hinges on the moving platform was established, in order to analyze the attitude adjustment ability of the hybrid parallel mask exchange robot. The proposed conceptual design has some guiding significance for the design of mask exchange system of the MOBIE on TMT.\n\nEvaluation of the power consumption of a high-speed parallel robot\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHan, Gang; Xie, Fugui; Liu, Xin-Jun\n\n2018-06-01\n\nAn inverse dynamic model of a high-speed parallel robot is established based on the virtual work principle. With this dynamic model, a new evaluation method is proposed to measure the power consumption of the robot during pick-and-place tasks. The power vector is extended in this method and used to represent the collinear velocity and acceleration of the moving platform. Afterward, several dynamic performance indices, which are homogenous and possess obvious physical meanings, are proposed. These indices can evaluate the power input and output transmissibility of the robot in a workspace. The distributions of the power input and output transmissibility of the high-speed parallel robot are derived with these indices and clearly illustrated in atlases. Furtherly, a low-power-consumption workspace is selected for the robot.\n\nSocial humanoid robot SARA: development of the wrist mechanism\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPenÄiÄ, M.; Rackov, M.; ÄaviÄ, M.; Kiss, I.; CioatÄ, V. G.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis paper presents the development of a wrist mechanism for humanoid robots. The research was conducted within the project which develops social humanoid robot Sara - a mobile anthropomorphic platform for researching the social behaviour of robots. There are two basic ways for the realization of humanoid wrist. The first one is based on biologically inspired structures that have variable stiffness, and the second one on low backlash mechanisms that have high stiffness. Our solution is low backlash differential mechanism that requires small actuators. Based on the kinematic-dynamic requirements, a dynamic model of the robot wrist is formed. A dynamic simulation for several hand positions was performed and the driving torques of the wrist mechanism were determined. The realized wrist has 2 DOFs and enables movements in the direction of flexion/extension 115Â°, ulnar/radial deviation Â±45Â° and the combination of these two movements. It consists of a differential mechanism with three spur bevel gears, two of which are driving and identical, while the last one is the driven gear to which the robot hand is attached. Power transmission and motion from the actuator to the input links of the differential mechanism is realized with two parallel placed identical gear mechanisms. The wrist mechanism has high carrying capacity and reliability, high efficiency, a compact design and low backlash that provides high positioning accuracy and repeatability of movements, which is essential for motion control.\n\nA Soft Parallel Kinematic Mechanism.\n\nPubMed\n\nWhite, Edward L; Case, Jennifer C; Kramer-Bottiglio, Rebecca\n\n2018-02-01\n\nIn this article, we describe a novel holonomic soft robotic structure based on a parallel kinematic mechanism. The design is based on the Stewart platform, which uses six sensors and actuators to achieve full six-degree-of-freedom motion. Our design is much less complex than a traditional platform, since it replaces the 12 spherical and universal joints found in a traditional Stewart platform with a single highly deformable elastomer body and flexible actuators. This reduces the total number of parts in the system and simplifies the assembly process. Actuation is achieved through coiled-shape memory alloy actuators. State observation and feedback is accomplished through the use of capacitive elastomer strain gauges. The main structural element is an elastomer joint that provides antagonistic force. We report the response of the actuators and sensors individually, then report the response of the complete assembly. We show that the completed robotic system is able to achieve full position control, and we discuss the limitations associated with using responsive material actuators. We believe that control demonstrated on a single body in this work could be extended to chains of such bodies to create complex soft robots.\n\nSerpentine Robot Model and Gait Design Using Autodesk Inventor and Simulink SimMechanics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDaniel; Iman Alamsyah, Mohammad; Erwin; Tan, Sofyan\n\n2014-03-01\n\nThe authors introduce gaits of a serpentine robot with linear expansion mechanism where the robot varies its length using joints with three degrees of freedom. The 3D model of the serpentine robot is drawed in Autocad InventorÂ® and exported to SimMechanicsÂ® for straighforward modeling of the kinematics. The gaits are important for robots designed to explore ruins of disasters where the working spaces are very tight. For maximum flexibility of the serpentine robot, we adopted a joint design with three parallel actuators, where the joint is capable of linear movement in the forward axis, and rotational movements around two other axes. The designed linear expansion gaits is calculated for forward movement when the robot is posing straight or turning laterally.\n\nSix degree-of-freedom scanning supports and manipulators based on parallel robots\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nComin, Fabio\n\n1995-02-01\n\nThe exploitation of third generation SR sources heavily relies on accurate and stable positioning and scanning of samples and optical elements. In some cases, active feedback is also necessary. Normally, these tasks are carried out by serial addition of individual components, each of them providing a well-defined excursion path. On the contrary, the exploitation of the concept of parallel robots, structures in close cinematic chain, permits us to follow any given trajectory in the six-dimensional space with a large increase in accuracy and stiffness. At ESRF, the parallel robot architecture conceived some tens of years ago for flight simulators has been adapted to both actively align and operate optical elements of considerable weight and position small samples in ultrahigh vacuum. The performance of these devices gives results far superior to the initial specification and a variety of drive mechanisms are being developed to fit the different needs of the ESRF beamlines.\n\nMotion capability analysis of a quadruped robot as a parallel manipulator\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYu, Jingjun; Lu, Dengfeng; Zhang, Zhongxiang; Pei, Xu\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThis paper presents the forward and inverse displacement analysis of a quadruped robot MANA as a parallel manipulator in quadruple stance phase, which is used to obtain the workspace and control the motion of the body. The robot MANA designed on the basis of the structure of quadruped mammal is able to not only walk and turn in the uneven terrain, but also accomplish various manipulating tasks as a parallel manipulator in quadruple stance phase. The latter will be the focus of this paper, however. For this purpose, the leg kinematics is primarily analyzed, which lays the foundation on the gait planning in terms of locomotion and body kinematics analysis as a parallel manipulator. When all four feet of the robot contact on the ground, by assuming there is no slipping at the feet, each contacting point is treated as a passive spherical joint and the kinematic model of parallel manipulator is established. The method for choosing six non-redundant actuated joints for the parallel manipulator from all twelve optional joints is elaborated. The inverse and forward displacement analysis of the parallel manipulator is carried out using the method of coordinate transformation. Finally, based on the inverse and forward kinematic model, two issues on obtaining the reachable workspace of parallel manipulator and planning the motion of the body are implemented and verified by ADAMS simulation.\n\nDynamics and control of cable-suspended parallel robots for giant telescopes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhuang, Peng; Yao, Zhengqiu\n\n2006-06-01\n\nA cable-suspended parallel robot utilizes the basic idea of Stewart platform but replaces parallel links with cables and linear actuators with winches. It has many advantages over a conventional crane. The concept of applying a cable-suspended parallel robot into the construction and maintenance of giant telescope is presented in this paper. Compared with the mass and travel of the moving platform of the robot, the mass and deformation of the cables can be disregarded. Based on the premises, the kinematic and dynamic models of the robot are built. Through simulation, the inertia and gravity of moving platform are found to have dominant effect on the dynamic characteristic of the robot, while the dynamics of actuators can be disregarded, so a simplified dynamic model applicable to real-time control is obtained. Moreover, according to control-law partitioning approach and optimization theory, a workspace model-based controller is proposed considering the characteristic that the cables can only pull but not push. The simulation results indicate that the controller possesses good accuracy in pose and speed tracking, and keeps the cables in reliable tension by maintaining the minimum strain above a certain given value, thus ensures smooth motion and accurate localization for moving platform.\n\nImplementation and Assessment of a Virtual Laboratory of Parallel Robots Developed for Engineering Students\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGil, Arturo; PeidrÃ³, AdriÃ¡n; Reinoso, Ãscar; MarÃ­n, JosÃ© MarÃ­a\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis paper presents a tool, LABEL, oriented to the teaching of parallel robotics.

First, we have designed and formulated its inverse kinematics the construction of mechanism. Next, we have developed a scanning method of the ultrasound probe on body surface to construct visual servo system based on acquired echogram by the standalone medical robot to move the ultrasound probe on patient abdomen in three-dimension. The visual servo system detects local change of brightness in time series echogram, which is stabilized the position of the probe by conventional force servo system in the robot, to compensate not only periodical respiration motion but also body motion. Then we integrated control method of the visual servo with the force servo as a hybrid control in both of position and force. To confirm the ability to apply for actual abdomen, we experimented the total system to follow the gallbladder as a moving target to keep its position in the echogram by minimizing variation of reaction force on abdomen. As the result, the system has a potential to be applied to automatic detection of human internal organ.\n\nParallel robot for micro assembly with integrated innovative optical 3D-sensor\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHesselbach, Juergen; Ispas, Diana; Pokar, Gero; Soetebier, Sven; Tutsch, Rainer\n\n2002-10-01\n\nRecent advances in the fields of MEMS and MOEMS often require precise assembly of very small parts with an accuracy of a few microns. In order to meet this demand, a new approach using a robot based on parallel mechanisms in combination with a novel 3D-vision system has been chosen. The planar parallel robot structure with 2 DOF provides a high resolution in the XY-plane. It carries two additional serial axes for linear and rotational movement in/about z direction. In order to achieve high precision as well as good dynamic capabilities, the drive concept for the parallel (main) axes incorporates air bearings in combination with a linear electric servo motors. High accuracy position feedback is provided by optical encoders with a resolution of 0.1 Î¼m. To allow for visualization and visual control of assembly processes, a camera module fits into the hollow tool head. It consists of a miniature CCD camera and a light source. In addition a modular gripper support is integrated into the tool head. To increase the accuracy a control loop based on an optoelectronic sensor will be implemented. As a result of an in-depth analysis of different approaches a photogrammetric system using one single camera and special beam-splitting optics was chosen. A pattern of elliptical marks is applied to the surfaces of workpiece and gripper. Using a model-based recognition algorithm the image processing software identifies the gripper and the workpiece and determines their relative position. A deviation vector is calculated and fed into the robot control to guide the gripper.\n\nDesign and development of miniature parallel robot for eye surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nSakai, Tomoya; Harada, Kanako; Tanaka, Shinichi; Ueta, Takashi; Noda, Yasuo; Sugita, Naohiko; Mitsuishi, Mamoru\n\n2014-01-01\n\nA five degree-of-freedom (DOF) miniature parallel robot has been developed to precisely and safely remove the thin internal limiting membrane in the eye ground during vitreoretinal surgery. A simulator has been developed to determine the design parameters of this robot. The developed robot's size is 85 mm Ã 100 mm Ã 240 mm, and its weight is 770 g. This robot incorporates an emergency instrument retraction function to quickly remove the instrument from the eye in case of sudden intraoperative complications such as bleeding.

A quasi-LPV approach, through the so-called TS fuzzy model and LMI constraints problems is used. Moreover, in this context a way to derive interesting control laws is to keep the descriptor form of the mechanical system. Therefore, new LMI problems have to be defined that helps to reduce the conservatism of the usual results. Some relaxations are also proposed to leave the pure quadratic stability/stabilization framework. A comparison study between the classical control strategies from robotics and the control design using TS fuzzy descriptor models is carried out to show the interest of the proposed approach.

To improve cervical disc replacement surgery significantly, a 6-DOF parallel bone-grinding robot is developed for cervical bone-grinding by image navigation and surgical plan. The bone-grinding robot including mechanical design and low level control is designed. The bone-grinding robot navigation is realized by optical positioning with spatial registration coordinate system defined. And a parametric robot bone-grinding plan and high level control have been developed for plane grinding for cervical top endplate and tail endplate grinding by a cylindrical grinding drill and spherical grinding for two articular surfaces of bones by a ball grinding drill. Finally, the surgical flow for a robot-assisted cervical disc replacement surgery procedure is present. The final experiments results verified the key technologies and performance of the robot-assisted surgery system concept excellently, which points out a promising clinical application with higher operability. Finally, study innovations, study limitations, and future works of this present study are discussed, and conclusions of this paper are also summarized further. This bone-grinding robot is still in the initial stage, and there are many problems to be solved from a clinical point of view. Moreover, the technique is promising and can give a good support for surgeons in future clinical work.\n\nStructure Assembly by a Heterogeneous Team of Robots Using State Estimation, Generalized Joints, and Mobile Parallel Manipulators\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKomendera, Erik E.; Adhikari, Shaurav; Glassner, Samantha; Kishen, Ashwin; Quartaro, Amy\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAutonomous robotic assembly by mobile field robots has seen significant advances in recent decades, yet practicality remains elusive. Identified challenges include better use of state estimation to and reasoning with uncertainty, spreading out tasks to specialized robots, and implementing representative joining methods. This paper proposes replacing 1) self-correcting mechanical linkages with generalized joints for improved applicability, 2) assembly serial manipulators with parallel manipulators for higher precision and stability, and 3) all-in-one robots with a heterogeneous team of specialized robots for agent simplicity. This paper then describes a general assembly algorithm utilizing state estimation. Finally, these concepts are tested in the context of solar array assembly, requiring a team of robots to assemble, bond, and deploy a set of solar panel mockups to a backbone truss to an accuracy not built into the parts. This paper presents the results of these tests.\n\nTrajectory control of an articulated robot with a parallel drive arm based on splines under tension\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYi, Seung-Jong\n\nToday's industrial robots controlled by mini/micro computers are basically simple positioning devices. The positioning accuracy depends on the mathematical description of the robot configuration to place the end-effector at the desired position and orientation within the workspace and on following the specified path which requires the trajectory planner. In addition, the consideration of joint velocity, acceleration, and jerk trajectories are essential for trajectory planning of industrial robots to obtain smooth operation. The newly designed 6 DOF articulated robot with a parallel drive arm mechanism which permits the joint actuators to be placed in the same horizontal line to reduce the arm inertia and to increase load capacity and stiffness is selected. First, the forward kinematic and inverse kinematic problems are examined. The forward kinematic equations are successfully derived based on Denavit-Hartenberg notation with independent joint angle constraints. The inverse kinematic problems are solved using the arm-wrist partitioned approach with independent joint angle constraints. Three types of curve fitting methods used in trajectory planning, i.e., certain degree polynomial functions, cubic spline functions, and cubic spline functions under tension, are compared to select the best possible method to satisfy both smooth joint trajectories and positioning accuracy for a robot trajectory planner. Cubic spline functions under tension is the method selected for the new trajectory planner. This method is implemented for a 6 DOF articulated robot with a parallel drive arm mechanism to improve the smoothness of the joint trajectories and the positioning accuracy of the manipulator. Also, this approach is compared with existing trajectory planners, 4-3-4 polynomials and cubic spline functions, via circular arc motion simulations. The new trajectory planner using cubic spline functions under tension is implemented into the microprocessor based robot controller and\n\nError modeling and sensitivity analysis of a parallel robot with SCARA(selective compliance assembly robot arm) motions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, Yuzhen; Xie, Fugui; Liu, Xinjun; Zhou, Yanhua\n\n2014-07-01\n\nParallel robots with SCARA(selective compliance assembly robot arm) motions are utilized widely in the field of high speed pick-and-place manipulation. Error modeling for these robots generally simplifies the parallelogram structures included by the robots as a link. As the established error model fails to reflect the error feature of the parallelogram structures, the effect of accuracy design and kinematic calibration based on the error model come to be undermined. An error modeling methodology is proposed to establish an error model of parallel robots with parallelogram structures. The error model can embody the geometric errors of all joints, including the joints of parallelogram structures. Thus it can contain more exhaustively the factors that reduce the accuracy of the robot. Based on the error model and some sensitivity indices defined in the sense of statistics, sensitivity analysis is carried out. Accordingly, some atlases are depicted to express each geometric error's influence on the moving platform's pose errors. From these atlases, the geometric errors that have greater impact on the accuracy of the moving platform are identified, and some sensitive areas where the pose errors of the moving platform are extremely sensitive to the geometric errors are also figured out. By taking into account the error factors which are generally neglected in all existing modeling methods, the proposed modeling method can thoroughly disclose the process of error transmission and enhance the efficacy of accuracy design and calibration.\n\nConfiguration optimization and experimental accuracy evaluation of a bone-attached, parallel robot for skull surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nKobler, Jan-Philipp; Nuelle, Kathrin; Lexow, G Jakob; Rau, Thomas S; Majdani, Omid; Kahrs, Lueder A; Kotlarski, Jens; Ortmaier, Tobias\n\n2016-03-01\n\nMinimally invasive cochlear implantation is a novel surgical technique which requires highly accurate guidance of a drilling tool along a trajectory from the mastoid surface toward the basal turn of the cochlea. The authors propose a passive, reconfigurable, parallel robot which can be directly attached to bone anchors implanted in a patient's skull, avoiding the need for surgical tracking systems. Prior to clinical trials, methods are necessary to patient specifically optimize the configuration of the mechanism with respect to accuracy and stability. Furthermore, the achievable accuracy has to be determined experimentally. A comprehensive error model of the proposed mechanism is established, taking into account all relevant error sources identified in previous studies. Two optimization criteria to exploit the given task redundancy and reconfigurability of the passive robot are derived from the model. The achievable accuracy of the optimized robot configurations is first estimated with the help of a Monte Carlo simulation approach and finally evaluated in drilling experiments using synthetic temporal bone specimen. Experimental results demonstrate that the bone-attached mechanism exhibits a mean targeting accuracy of [Formula: see text]Â mm under realistic conditions. A systematic targeting error is observed, which indicates that accurate identification of the passive robot's kinematic parameters could further reduce deviations from planned drill trajectories. The accuracy of the proposed mechanism demonstrates its suitability for minimally invasive cochlear implantation. Future work will focus on further evaluation experiments on temporal bone specimen.\n\nThree Degree of Freedom Parallel Mechanical Linkage\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAdelstein, Bernard D. (Inventor)\n\n1998-01-01\n\nA three degree of freedom parallel mechanism or linkage that couples three degree of freedom translational displacements at an endpoint, such as a handle, a hand grip, or a robot tool, to link rotations about three axes that are fixed with respect to a common base or ground link. The mechanism includes a three degree of freedom spherical linkage formed of two closed loops, and a planar linkage connected to the endpoint. The closed loops are rotatably interconnected, and made of eight rigid links connected by a plurality of single degree of freedom revolute joints. Three of these revolute joints are base joints and are connected to a common ground. such that the axis lines passing through the revolute joints intersect at a common fixed center point K forming the center of a spherical work volume in which the endpoint is capable of moving. 'Me three degrees of freedom correspond to the spatial displacement of the endpoint, for instance. The mechanism provides a new overall spatial kinematic linkage composed of a minimal number of rigid links and rotary joints. The mechanism has improved mechanical stiffness, and conveys mechanical power bidirectionally between the human operator and the electromechanical actuators. It does not require gears, belts. cable, screw or other types of transmission elements, and is useful in applications requiring full backdrivability. Thus, this invention can serve as the mechanical linkage for actively powered devices such as compliant robotic manipulators and force-reflecting hand controllers, and passive devices such as manual input devices for computers and other systems.\n\nA parallel expert system for the control of a robotic air vehicle\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nShakley, Donald; Lamont, Gary B.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nExpert systems can be used to govern the intelligent control of vehicles, for example the Robotic Air Vehicle (RAV). Due to the nature of the RAV system the associated expert system needs to perform in a demanding real-time environment. The use of a parallel processing capability to support the associated expert system's computational requirement is critical in this application. Thus, algorithms for parallel real-time expert systems must be designed, analyzed, and synthesized. The design process incorporates a consideration of the rule-set/face-set size along with representation issues. These issues are looked at in reference to information movement and various inference mechanisms. Also examined is the process involved with transporting the RAV expert system functions from the TI Explorer, where they are implemented in the Automated Reasoning Tool (ART), to the iPSC Hypercube, where the system is synthesized using Concurrent Common LISP (CCLISP). The transformation process for the ART to CCLISP conversion is described. The performance characteristics of the parallel implementation of these expert systems on the iPSC Hypercube are compared to the TI Explorer implementation.\n\nCharacterization of robotics parallel algorithms and mapping onto a reconfigurable SIMD machine\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLee, C. S. G.; Lin, C. T.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe kinematics, dynamics, Jacobian, and their corresponding inverse computations are six essential problems in the control of robot manipulators. Efficient parallel algorithms for these computations are discussed and analyzed. Their characteristics are identified and a scheme on the mapping of these algorithms to a reconfigurable parallel architecture is presented. Based on the characteristics including type of parallelism, degree of parallelism, uniformity of the operations, fundamental operations, data dependencies, and communication requirement, it is shown that most of the algorithms for robotic computations possess highly regular properties and some common structures, especially the linear recursive structure. Moreover, they are well-suited to be implemented on a single-instruction-stream multiple-data-stream (SIMD) computer with reconfigurable interconnection network. The model of a reconfigurable dual network SIMD machine with internal direct feedback is introduced. A systematic procedure internal direct feedback is introduced. A systematic procedure to map these computations to the proposed machine is presented. A new scheduling problem for SIMD machines is investigated and a heuristic algorithm, called neighborhood scheduling, that reorders the processing sequence of subtasks to reduce the communication time is described. Mapping results of a benchmark algorithm are illustrated and discussed.\n\nDirect kinematics solution architectures for industrial robot manipulators: Bit-serial versus parallel\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLee, J.; Kim, K.\n\nA Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) architecture for robot direct kinematic computation suitable for industrial robot manipulators was investigated. The Denavit-Hartenberg transformations are reviewed to exploit a proper processing element, namely an augmented CORDIC. Specifically, two distinct implementations are elaborated on, such as the bit-serial and parallel. Performance of each scheme is analyzed with respect to the time to compute one location of the end-effector of a 6-links manipulator, and the number of transistors required.\n\nDirect kinematics solution architectures for industrial robot manipulators: Bit-serial versus parallel\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLee, J.; Kim, K.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nA Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) architecture for robot direct kinematic computation suitable for industrial robot manipulators was investigated. The Denavit-Hartenberg transformations are reviewed to exploit a proper processing element, namely an augmented CORDIC.

Compared to a one link flexible manipulator, a two link flexible manipulator, especially the flexible parallel mechanism, has more complicated characteristics in dynamics and control. The objective of this research is the theoretical analysis and the experimental verification of dynamics and control of a two link flexible manipulator with a flexible parallel link mechanism. Nonlinear equations of motion of the lightweight manipulator are derived by the Lagrangian method in symbolic form to better understand the structure of the dynamic model. A manipulator with a flexible parallel link mechanism is a constrained dynamic system whose equations are sensitive to numerical integration error. This constrained system is solved using singular value decomposition of the constraint Jacobian matrix. The discrepancies between the analytical model and the experiment are explained using a simplified and a detailed finite element model. The step response of the analytical model and the TREETOPS model match each other well. The nonlinear dynamics is studied using a sinusoidal excitation. The actuator dynamic effect on a flexible robot was investigated. The effects are explained by the root loci and the Bode plot theoretically and experimentally. For the base performance for the advanced control scheme, a simple decoupled feedback scheme is applied.\n\nDevelopment of autonomous eating mechanism for biomimetic robots\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJeong, Kil-Woong; Cho, Ik-Jin; Lee, Yun-Jung\n\n2005-12-01\n\nMost of the recently developed robots are human friendly robots which imitate animals or humans such as entertainment robot, bio-mimetic robot and humanoid robot. Interest for these robots are being increased because the social trend is focused on health, welfare, and graying. Autonomous eating functionality is most unique and inherent behavior of pets and animals. Most of entertainment robots and pet robots make use of internal-type battery. Entertainment robots and pet robots with internal-type battery are not able to operate during charging the battery. Therefore, if a robot has an autonomous function for eating battery as its feeds, the robot is not only able to operate during recharging energy but also become more human friendly like pets. Here, a new autonomous eating mechanism was introduced for a biomimetic robot, called ELIRO-II(Eating LIzard RObot version 2). The ELIRO-II is able to find a food (a small battery), eat and evacuate by itself. This work describe sub-parts of the developed mechanism such as head-part, mouth-part, and stomach-part. In addition, control system of autonomous eating mechanism is described.\n\nEfficient dynamic simulation for multiple chain robotic mechanisms\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLilly, Kathryn W.; Orin, David E.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nAn efficient O(mN) algorithm for dynamic simulation of simple closed-chain robotic mechanisms is presented, where m is the number of chains, and N is the number of degrees of freedom for each chain. It is based on computation of the operational space inertia matrix (6 x 6) for each chain as seen by the body, load, or object. Also, computation of the chain dynamics, when opened at one end, is required, and the most efficient algorithm is used for this purpose. Parallel implementation of the dynamics for each chain results in an O(N) + O(log sub 2 m+1) algorithm.\n\nKinematics and dynamics of a six-degree-of-freedom robot manipulator with closed kinematic chain mechanism\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNguyen, Charles C.; Pooran, Farhad J.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThis paper deals with a class of robot manipulators built based on the kinematic chain mechanism (CKCM). This class of CKCM manipulators consists of a fixed and a moving platform coupled together via a number of in-parallel actuators. A closed-form solution is derived for the inverse kinematic problem of a six-degre-of-freedom CKCM manipulator designed to study robotic applications in space. Iterative Newton-Raphson method is employed to solve the forward kinematic problem. Dynamics of the above manipulator is derived using the Lagrangian approach. Computer simulation of the dynamical equations shows that the actuating forces are strongly dependent on the mass and centroid of the robot links.\n\nConceptual design and kinematic analysis of a novel parallel robot for high-speed pick-and-place operations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMeng, Qizhi; Xie, Fugui; Liu, Xin-Jun\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThis paper deals with the conceptual design, kinematic analysis and workspace identification of a novel four degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) high-speed spatial parallel robot for pick-and-place operations. The proposed spatial parallel robot consists of a base, four arms and a 1Â½ mobile platform. The mobile platform is a major innovation that avoids output singularity and offers the advantages of both single and double platforms. To investigate the characteristics of the robot's DOFs, a line graph method based on Grassmann line geometry is adopted in mobility analysis. In addition, the inverse kinematics is derived, and the constraint conditions to identify the correct solution are also provided. On the basis of the proposed concept, the workspace of the robot is identified using a set of presupposed parameters by taking input and output transmission index as the performance evaluation criteria.\n\nAn Overview of Kinematic and Calibration Models Using Internal/External Sensors or Constraints to Improve the Behavior of Spatial Parallel Mechanisms\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMajarena, Ana C.; Santolaria, Jorge; Samper, David; Aguilar, Juan J.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis paper presents an overview of the literature on kinematic and calibration models of parallel mechanisms, the influence of sensors in the mechanism accuracy and parallel mechanisms used as sensors. The most relevant classifications to obtain and solve kinematic models and to identify geometric and non-geometric parameters in the calibration of parallel robots are discussed, examining the advantages and disadvantages of each method, presenting new trends and identifying unsolved problems. This overview tries to answer and show the solutions developed by the most up-to-date research to some of the most frequent questions that appear in the modelling of a parallel mechanism, such as how to measure, the number of sensors and necessary configurations, the type and influence of errors or the number of necessary parameters. PMID:22163469\n\nAdvanced mechanisms for robotics\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nVranish, John M.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nAn overview of applied research and development at NASA-Goddard (GSFC) on mechanisms and the collision avoidance skin for robots is presented. First the work on robot end effectors is outlined, followed by a brief discussion on robot-friendly payload latching mechanisms and compliant joints. This, in turn, is followed by the collision avoidance/management skin and the GSFC research on magnetostrictive direct drive motors. Finally, a new project, the artificial muscle, is introduced. Each of the devices is described in sufficient detail to permit a basic understanding of its purpose, fundamental principles of operation, and capabilities. In addition, the development status of each is reported along with descriptions of breadboards and prototypes and their test results. In each case, the implications of the research for commercialization is discussed.

The paper proposes a novel device for ankle-foot neuro-rehabilitation based on a mechatronic redesign of the remarkable Agile Eye spherical robot on the basis of clinical requisites. The kinematic design allows the positioning of the ankle articular center close to the machine rotation center with valuable benefits in term of therapy functions. The prototype, named PKAnkle, Parallel Kinematic machine for Ankle rehabilitation, provides a 6-axes load cell for the measure of subject interaction forces/torques, and it integrates a commercial EMG-acquisition system. Robot control provides active and passive therapeutic exercises.\n\nAn Advice Mechanism for Heterogeneous Robot Teams\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDaniluk, Steven\n\nThe use of reinforcement learning for robot teams has enabled complex tasks to be performed, but at the cost of requiring a large amount of exploration. Exchanging information between robots in the form of advice is one method to accelerate performance improvements. This thesis presents an advice mechanism for robot teams that utilizes advice from heterogeneous advisers via a method guaranteeing convergence to an optimal policy. The presented mechanism has the capability to use multiple advisers at each time step, and decide when advice should be requested and accepted, such that the use of advice decreases over time. Additionally, collective collaborative, and cooperative behavioural algorithms are integrated into a robot team architecture, to create a new framework that provides fault tolerance and modularity for robot teams.\n\nDimensional synthesis of a 3-DOF parallel manipulator with full circle rotation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNi, Yanbing; Wu, Nan; Zhong, Xueyong; Zhang, Biao\n\n2015-07-01\n\nParallel robots are widely used in the academic and industrial fields. In spite of the numerous achievements in the design and dimensional synthesis of the low-mobility parallel robots, few research efforts are directed towards the asymmetric 3-DOF parallel robots whose end-effector can realize 2 translational and 1 rotational(2T1R) motion. In order to develop a manipulator with the capability of full circle rotation to enlarge the workspace, a new 2T1R parallel mechanism is proposed. The modeling approach and kinematic analysis of this proposed mechanism are investigated. Using the method of vector analysis, the inverse kinematic equations are established. This is followed by a vigorous proof that this mechanism attains an annular workspace through its circular rotation and 2 dimensional translations. Taking the first order perturbation of the kinematic equations, the error Jacobian matrix which represents the mapping relationship between the error sources of geometric parameters and the end-effector position errors is derived. With consideration of the constraint conditions of pressure angles and feasible workspace, the dimensional synthesis is conducted with a goal to minimize the global comprehensive performance index. The dimension parameters making the mechanism to have optimal error mapping and kinematic performance are obtained through the optimization algorithm. All these research achievements lay the foundation for the prototype building of such kind of parallel robots.\n\nSpecial purpose parallel computer architecture for real-time control and simulation in robotic applications\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFijany, Amir (Inventor); Bejczy, Antal K. (Inventor)\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThis is a real-time robotic controller and simulator which is a MIMD-SIMD parallel architecture for interfacing with an external host computer and providing a high degree of parallelism in computations for robotic control and simulation. It includes a host processor for receiving instructions from the external host computer and for transmitting answers to the external host computer. There are a plurality of SIMD microprocessors, each SIMD processor being a SIMD parallel processor capable of exploiting fine grain parallelism and further being able to operate asynchronously to form a MIMD architecture. Each SIMD processor comprises a SIMD architecture capable of performing two matrix-vector operations in parallel while fully exploiting parallelism in each operation. There is a system bus connecting the host processor to the plurality of SIMD microprocessors and a common clock providing a continuous sequence of clock pulses. There is also a ring structure interconnecting the plurality of SIMD microprocessors and connected to the clock for providing the clock pulses to the SIMD microprocessors and for providing a path for the flow of data and instructions between the SIMD microprocessors. The host processor includes logic for controlling the RRCS by interpreting instructions sent by the external host computer, decomposing the instructions into a series of computations to be performed by the SIMD microprocessors, using the system bus to distribute associated data among the SIMD microprocessors, and initiating activity of the SIMD microprocessors to perform the computations on the data by procedure call.\n\nDesign, fabrication and characterization of a micro-fluxgate intended for parallel robot application\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKirchhoff, M. R.; Bogdanski, G.; BÃ¼ttgenbach, S.\n\n2009-05-01\n\nThis paper presents a micro-magnetometer based on the fluxgate principle. Fluxgates detect the magnitude and direction of DC and low-frequency AC magnetic fields. The detectable flux density typically ranges from several 10 nT to about 1 mT. The introduced fluxgate sensor is fabricated using MEMS-technologies, basically UV depth lithography and electroplating for manufacturing high aspect ratio structures. It consists of helical copper coils around a soft magnetic nickel-iron (NiFe) core. The core is designed in so-called racetrack geometry, whereby the directional sensitivity of the sensor is considerably higher compared to common ring-core fluxgates. The electrical operation is based on analyzing the 2nd harmonic of the AC output signal. Configuration, manufacturing and selected characteristics of the fluxgate magnetometer are discussed in this work. The fluxgate builds the basis of an innovative angular sensor system for a parallel robot with HEXA-structure. Integrated into the passive joints of the parallel robot, the fluxgates are combined with permanent magnets rotating on the joint shafts. The magnet transmits the angular information via its magnetic orientation. In this way, the angles between the kinematic elements are measured, which allows self-calibration of the robot and the fast analytical solution of direct kinematics for an advanced workspace monitoring.\n\nMethod for six-legged robot stepping on obstacles by indirect force estimation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXu, Yilin; Gao, Feng; Pan, Yang; Chai, Xun\n\n2016-07-01\n\nAdaptive gaits for legged robots often requires force sensors installed on foot-tips, however impact, temperature or humidity can affect or even damage those sensors. Efforts have been made to realize indirect force estimation on the legged robots using leg structures based on planar mechanisms. Robot Octopus III is a six-legged robot using spatial parallel mechanism(UP-2UPS) legs. This paper proposed a novel method to realize indirect force estimation on walking robot based on a spatial parallel mechanism. The direct kinematics model and the inverse kinematics model are established. The force Jacobian matrix is derived based on the kinematics model. Thus, the indirect force estimation model is established. Then, the relation between the output torques of the three motors installed on one leg to the external force exerted on the foot tip is described. Furthermore, an adaptive tripod static gait is designed. The robot alters its leg trajectory to step on obstacles by using the proposed adaptive gait. Both the indirect force estimation model and the adaptive gait are implemented and optimized in a real time control system. An experiment is carried out to validate the indirect force estimation model. The adaptive gait is tested in another experiment. Experiment results show that the robot can successfully step on a 0.2 m-high obstacle. This paper proposes a novel method to overcome obstacles for the six-legged robot using spatial parallel mechanism legs and to avoid installing the electric force sensors in harsh environment of the robot's foot tips.\n\nEvaluation of parallel reduction strategies for fusion of sensory information from a robot team\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLyons, Damian M.; Leroy, Joseph\n\n2015-05-01\n\nThe advantage of using a team of robots to search or to map an area is that by navigating the robots to different parts of the area, searching or mapping can be completed more quickly. A crucial aspect of the problem is the combination, or fusion, of data from team members to generate an integrated model of the search/mapping area. In prior work we looked at the issue of removing mutual robots views from an integrated point cloud model built from laser and stereo sensors, leading to a cleaner and more accurate model. This paper addresses a further challenge: Even with mutual views removed, the stereo data from a team of robots can quickly swamp a WiFi connection. This paper proposes and evaluates a communication and fusion approach based on the parallel reduction operation, where data is combined in a series of steps of increasing subsets of the team. Eight different strategies for selecting the subsets are evaluated for bandwidth requirements using three robot missions, each carried out with teams of four Pioneer 3-AT robots. Our results indicate that selecting groups to combine based on similar pose but distant location yields the best results.\n\nRobotic Powered Transfer Mechanism modeling on Human Muscle Structure\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSaito, Yukio\n\nIt is considered in engineering that one power source can operate one joint. However, support movement mechanism of living organism is multi joint movement mechanism. Considerably different from mechanical movement mechanism, two pairs of uni-articular muscles and a pair of bi-articular muscles are involved in it. In leg, movements observed in short run including leg idling, heel contact and toeing are operated by bi-articular muscles of the thigh showing strong legs to support body weight. Pursuit of versatility in welfare robot brings its comparison with conventional machinery or industrial robot to the fore. Request for safety and technology allowing elderly people to operate the robot is getting stronger in the society. The robot must be safe when it is used together with other welfare equipment and simpler system avoiding difficult operation has to be constructed. Appearance of recent care and assistance robot is getting similar to human arm in comparison with industrial robot. Being easily able to imagine from industrial robot, mid-heavyweight articulated robot to support 60-70kgf combined with large output motor and reduction gears is next to impossible to be installed in the bath room. This research indicated that upper limb arm and lower limb thigh of human and animals are holding coalitional muscles and movement of uni-artcular muscle and bi-articular muscle conjure the image of new actuators.\n\nKinematic synthesis of adjustable robotic mechanisms\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChuenchom, Thatchai\n\n1993-01-01\n\nConventional hard automation, such as a linkage-based or a cam-driven system, provides high speed capability and repeatability but not the flexibility required in many industrial applications. The conventional mechanisms, that are typically single-degree-of-freedom systems, are being increasingly replaced by multi-degree-of-freedom multi-actuators driven by logic controllers. Although this new trend in sophistication provides greatly enhanced flexibility, there are many instances where the flexibility needs are exaggerated and the associated complexity is unnecessary. Traditional mechanism-based hard automation, on the other hand, neither can fulfill multi-task requirements nor are cost-effective mainly due to lack of methods and tools to design-in flexibility. This dissertation attempts to bridge this technological gap by developing Adjustable Robotic Mechanisms (ARM's) or 'programmable mechanisms' as a middle ground between high speed hard automation and expensive serial jointed-arm robots. This research introduces the concept of adjustable robotic mechanisms towards cost-effective manufacturing automation. A generalized analytical synthesis technique has been developed to support the computational design of ARM's that lays the theoretical foundation for synthesis of adjustable mechanisms. The synthesis method developed in this dissertation, called generalized adjustable dyad and triad synthesis, advances the well-known Burmester theory in kinematics to a new level. While this method provides planar solutions, a novel patented scheme is utilized for converting prescribed three-dimensional motion specifications into sets of planar projections. This provides an analytical and a computational tool for designing adjustable mechanisms that satisfy multiple sets of three-dimensional motion specifications. Several design issues were addressed, including adjustable parameter identification, branching defect, and mechanical errors.

The system combines conventional and robotic surgery allowing for a quick conversion between the procedures. This concept requires a new master console that can be positioned at the surgical bedside and be sterilized. The master console was developed using new technologies, such as a parallel mechanism and pneumatic sensors. The parallel mechanism is a purely passive 5-DOF (degrees of freedom) joystick based on the author's haptic research. The parallel mechanism enables motion input of conventional brain tumor removal surgery with a compact, intuitive interface that can be used in a conventional surgical environment. In addition, the pneumatic sensors implemented on the mechanism provide an intuitive interface and electrically isolate the tool parts from the mechanism so they can be easily sterilized. The 5-DOF parallel mechanism is compact (17 cm width, 19cm depth, and 15cm height), provides a 505,050 mm and 90Â° workspace and is highly backdrivable (0.27N of resistance force representing the surgical motion). The evaluation tests revealed that the pneumatic sensors can properly measure the suction strength, grasping force, and hand contact. In addition, an installability test showed that the master console can be used in a conventional surgical environment. The proposed master console design was shown to be feasible for operative neurosurgery based on comprehensive testing. This master console is currently being tested for master-slave control with a surgical robotic system.\n\nMechanism design and optimization of a bionic kangaroo jumping robot\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Y. H.; Zheng, L.; Ge, W. J.; Zou, Z. H.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nHopping robots have broad application prospects in the fields of military reconnaissance, field search or life rescue. However, current hopping robots still face the problems of weak jumping ability and load bearing. Inspired by the jumping of kangaroo, we design a Kangaroo hopping robot âZbotâ, which has two degrees of freedom and three joints. The geared five-bar mechanism is used to decouple the knee and ankle joints of the robot. In order to get a bionic performance, the coupling mechanism parameters are optimized. The simulation and experiments show that the robot has an excellent jumping ability and load capacity.\n\nMechanism And Control Of The Quadruped Walking Robot\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAdachi, Hironori; Nakano, Eiji; Koyachi, Noriho\n\n1987-10-01\n\nThis paper provides a description of the quadruped walking robot \"TURTLE-1\". A new link mechanism named ASTBALLEM is used for the legs of this robot. With this mechanism highly rigid and easily controllable legs are constructed. Each leg has two degrees of freedom and is driven by two DC servo motors. The motion of the legs is controlled by a micro computer and various gaits are generated. Static stability is maintained as the robot walks. Moreover, its walk is quasi-dynamic; that is, it has a manner of walking that has a two legged supporting period.\n\nThe NIST SPIDER, A Robot Crane\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAlbus, James; Bostelman, Roger; Dagalakis, Nicholas\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe Robot Systems Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology has been experimenting for several years with new concepts for robot cranes. These concepts utilize the basic idea of the Stewart Platform parallel link manipulator. The unique feature of the NIST approach is to use cables as the parallel links and to use winches as the actuators. So long as the cables are all in tension, the load is kinematically constrained, and the cables resist perturbing forces and moments with equal stiffness to both positive and negative loads. The result is that the suspended load is constrained with a mechanical stiffness determined by the elasticity of the cables, the suspended weight, and the geometry of the mechanism. Based on these concepts, a revolutionary new type of robot crane, the NIST SPIDER (Stewart Platform Instrumented Drive Environmental Robot) has been developed that can control the position, velocity, and force of tools and heavy machinery in all six degrees of freedom (x, y, z, roll, pitch, and yaw). Depending on what is suspended from its work platform, the SPIDER can perform a variety of tasks. Examples are: cutting, excavating and grading, shaping and finishing, lifting and positioning. A 6 m version of the SPIDER has been built and critical performance characteristics analyzed.

Space constraints for a robotic assistant are however strict. Therefore, roboticists study non-conventional mechanisms with advantageous size/workspace ratios. The determination of mechanism workspace, and primarily its boundaries, is thus of major importance. This Note builds on boundary equation definition, continuation and automatic differentiation to propose a general, accurate, fast and automated method for the determination of mechanism workspace. The method is illustrated with a planar RRR mechanism and a three-dimensional Orthoglide parallel mechanism.\n\n[Advanced Development for Space Robotics With Emphasis on Fault Tolerance Technology\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTesar, Delbert\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThis report describes work developing fault tolerant redundant robotic architectures and adaptive control strategies for robotic manipulator systems which can dynamically accommodate drastic robot manipulator mechanism, sensor or control failures and maintain stable end-point trajectory control with minimum disturbance. Kinematic designs of redundant, modular, reconfigurable arms for fault tolerance were pursued at a fundamental level. The approach developed robotic testbeds to evaluate disturbance responses of fault tolerant concepts in robotic mechanisms and controllers. The development was implemented in various fault tolerant mechanism testbeds including duality in the joint servo motor modules, parallel and serial structural architectures, and dual arms. All have real-time adaptive controller technologies to react to mechanism or controller disturbances (failures) to perform real-time reconfiguration to continue the task operations. The developments fall into three main areas: hardware, software, and theoretical.\n\nNew Factorization Techniques and Parallel (log N) Algorithms for Forward Dynamics Solution of Single Closed-Chain Robot Manipulators\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFijany, Amir\n\n1993-01-01\n\nIn this paper parallel 0(log N) algorithms for dynamic simulation of single closed-chain rigid multibody system as specialized to the case of a robot manipulatoar in contact with the environment are developed.\n\nVirtual Sensor for Kinematic Estimation of Flexible Links in Parallel Robots\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCabanes, Itziar; Mancisidor, Aitziber; Pinto, Charles\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe control of flexible link parallel manipulators is still an open area of research, endpoint trajectory tracking being one of the main challenges in this type of robot. The flexibility and deformations of the limbs make the estimation of the Tool Centre Point (TCP) position a challenging one. Authors have proposed different approaches to estimate this deformation and deduce the location of the TCP. However, most of these approaches require expensive measurement systems or the use of high computational cost integration methods. This work presents a novel approach based on a virtual sensor which can not only precisely estimate the deformation of the flexible links in control applications (less than 2% error), but also its derivatives (less than 6% error in velocity and 13% error in acceleration) according to simulation results. The validity of the proposed Virtual Sensor is tested in a Delta Robot, where the position of the TCP is estimated based on the Virtual Sensor measurements with less than a 0.03% of error in comparison with the flexible approach developed in ADAMS Multibody Software.

A recursive formulation that is derived from a virtual work form of the d'Alembert equations of motion is utilized for robot arm dynamics. A joint drive system that consists of a motor rotor and gears is included in the arm dynamics model, in order to take into account gyroscopic effects due to the spinning of the rotor. The fine grain parallelism of mechanical and control subsystem models is exploited, based on independent computation associated with bodies, joint drive systems, and controllers. Efficiency and effectiveness of the parallel scheme are demonstrated through simulations of a telerobotic manipulator arm. Two different mechanical subsystem models, i.e., with and without gyroscopic effects, are compared, to show the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.\n\nDevelopment of structural schemes of parallel structure manipulators using screw calculus\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRashoyan, G. V.; Shalyukhin, K. A.; Gaponenko, EV\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe paper considers the approach to the structural analysis and synthesis of parallel structure robots based on the mathematical apparatus of groups of screws and on a concept of reciprocity of screws. The results are depicted of synthesis of parallel structure robots with different numbers of degrees of freedom, corresponding to the different groups of screws. Power screws are applied with this aim, based on the principle of static-kinematic analogy; the power screws are similar to the orts of axes of not driven kinematic pairs of a corresponding connecting chain. Accordingly, kinematic screws of the outlet chain of a robot are simultaneously determined which are reciprocal to power screws of kinematic sub-chains. Solution of certain synthesis problems is illustrated with practical applications. Closed groups of screws can have eight types. The three-membered groups of screws are of greatest significance, as well as four-membered screw groups [1] and six-membered screw groups. Three-membered screw groups correspond to progressively guiding mechanisms, to spherical mechanisms, and to planar mechanisms. The four-membered group corresponds to the motion of the SCARA robot. The six-membered group includes all possible motions. From the works of A.P. Kotelnikov, F.M. Dimentberg, it is known that closed fifth-order screw groups do not exist. The article presents examples of the mechanisms corresponding to the given groups.\n\nDynamic Modeling and Interactive Performance of PARM: A Parallel Upper-Limb Rehabilitation Robot Using Impedance Control for Patients after Stroke.\n\nPubMed\n\nGuang, Hui; Ji, Linhong; Shi, Yingying; Misgeld, Berno J E\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe robot-assisted therapy has been demonstrated to be effective in the improvements of limb function and even activities of daily living for patients after stroke. This paper presents an interactive upper-limb rehabilitation robot with a parallel mechanism and an isometric screen embedded in the platform to display trajectories. In the dynamic modeling for impedance control, the effects of friction and inertia are reduced by introducing the principle of virtual work and derivative of Jacobian matrix. To achieve the assist-as-needed impedance control for arbitrary trajectories, the strategy based on orthogonal deviations is proposed. Simulations and experiments were performed to validate the dynamic modeling and impedance control. Besides, to investigate the influence of the impedance in practice, a subject participated in experiments and performed two types of movements with the robot, that is, rectilinear and circular movements, under four conditions, that is, with/without resistance or impedance, respectively. The results showed that the impedance and resistance affected both mean absolute error and standard deviation of movements and also demonstrated the significant differences between movements with/without impedance and resistance ( p < 0.001). Furthermore, the error patterns were discussed, which suggested that the impedance environment was capable of alleviating movement deviations by compensating the synergetic inadequacy between the shoulder and elbow joints.\n\nDynamic Modeling and Interactive Performance of PARM: A Parallel Upper-Limb Rehabilitation Robot Using Impedance Control for Patients after Stroke\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShi, Yingying; Misgeld, Berno J.

A developed quadruped wall climbing robot, NINJYA-1, is introduced. NINJYA-1 is composed of legs based on a 3D parallel link mechanism and a VM (Valve-regulated Multiple) sucker which will be able to suck even if there are grooves and a small difference in level. A wall climbing robot which supports rescue operation at a high building using a VM sucker is also introduced. Finally, a wall climbing robot named Disk Rover with a disk-type magnetic wheel is shown. The wheel shape is calculated by FEM. The disk-type magnetic wheel has a force three times more powerful than the one heretofore in use.\n\nCharacteristics of manipulator for industrial robot with three rotational pairs having parallel axes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPoteyev, M. I.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nThe dynamics of a manipulator with three rotatinal kinematic pairs having parallel axes are analyzed, for application in an industrial robot. The system of Lagrange equations of the second kind, describing the motion of such a mechanism in terms of kinetic energy in generalized coordinates, is reduced to equations of motion in terms of Newton's laws. These are useful not only for either determining the moments of force couples which will produce a prescribed motion or, conversely determining the motion which given force couples will produce but also for solving optimization problems under constraints in both cases and for estimating dynamic errors. As a specific example, a manipulator with all three axes of vertical rotation is considered. The performance of this manipulator, namely the parameters of its motion as functions of time, is compared with that of a manipulator having one rotational and two translational kinematic pairs. Computer aided simulation of their motion on the basis of ideal models, with all three links represented by identical homogeneous bars, has yielded velocity time diagrams which indicate that the manipulator with three rotational pairs is 4.5 times faster.\n\nAnalysis of a closed-kinematic chain robot manipulator\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNguyen, Charles C.; Pooran, Farhad J.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nPresented are the research results from the research grant entitled: Active Control of Robot Manipulators, sponsored by the Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA) under grant number NAG-780. This report considers a class of robot manipulators based on the closed-kinematic chain mechanism (CKCM). This type of robot manipulators mainly consists of two platforms, one is stationary and the other moving, and they are coupled together through a number of in-parallel actuators. Using spatial geometry and homogeneous transformation, a closed-form solution is derived for the inverse kinematic problem of the six-degree-of-freedom manipulator, built to study robotic assembly in space. Iterative Newton Raphson method is employed to solve the forward kinematic problem. Finally, the equations of motion of the above manipulators are obtained by employing the Lagrangian method. Study of the manipulator dynamics is performed using computer simulation whose results show that the robot actuating forces are strongly dependent on the mass and centroid locations of the robot links.\n\nType synthesis for 4-DOF parallel press mechanism using GF set theory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHe, Jun; Gao, Feng; Meng, Xiangdun; Guo, Weizhong\n\n2015-07-01\n\nParallel mechanisms is used in the large capacity servo press to avoid the over-constraint of the traditional redundant actuation. Currently, the researches mainly focus on the performance analysis for some specific parallel press mechanisms. However, the type synthesis and evaluation of parallel press mechanisms is seldom studied, especially for the four degrees of freedom(DOF) press mechanisms. The type synthesis of 4-DOF parallel press mechanisms is carried out based on the generalized function(GF) set theory. Five design criteria of 4-DOF parallel press mechanisms are firstly proposed. The general procedure of type synthesis of parallel press mechanisms is obtained, which includes number synthesis, symmetrical synthesis of constraint GF sets, decomposition of motion GF sets and design of limbs. Nine combinations of constraint GF sets of 4-DOF parallel press mechanisms, ten combinations of GF sets of active limbs, and eleven combinations of GF sets of passive limbs are synthesized. Thirty-eight kinds of press mechanisms are presented and then different structures of kinematic limbs are designed. Finally, the geometrical constraint complexity( GCC), kinematic pair complexity( KPC), and type complexity( TC) are proposed to evaluate the press types and the optimal press type is achieved. The general methodologies of type synthesis and evaluation for parallel press mechanism are suggested.\n\nRobotics for Human Exploration\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFong, Terrence; Deans, Mathew; Bualat, Maria\n\n2013-01-01\n\nRobots can do a variety of work to increase the productivity of human explorers.

However certain velocity constraints arising in fluid-body interactions, such as the Kutta condition classically applied at the trailing cusp of a Joukowski hydrofoil break this symmetry through vortex shedding. Thus Joukowski foils that vary shape periodically can be shown to be able to swim through vortex shedding. In general it can be shown that vortex shedding "
