        "text": "Flavor balance: sweet, spicy, salty\n\nRisk of macing yourself: medium-high\n\nDifficulty: medium, medium-high (if you don’t have a wok and you’ve never stir fried rice noodles. They are tricksy!)\n\nI had my first recipe request since deciding to share Thai food recipes into the intervoid! Pad ke mao means drunken noodles—I think because you can put whatever you want in it. That said, I’m going to give you a recipe and you can go from there. Don’t do the thing where you put unnecessary peanuts in it and call it Thai food. I will show you the things you need and then you can get creative.\n\nIn case you’ve never had it, pad ke mao is stir fried rice noodles with red curry paste, chili, garlic, assorted sauces, basil, and whatever vegetables you want. It is a nice, gentle introduction to Thai food if you enjoy spicy dishes. Whenever customers at the restaurant asked me for a recommendation to broaden their taste adventure beyond pad thai, I said, “if you like spicy, pad ke mao.” And then they would say, “I don’t eat spicy.” And I would say, “we can make it mild.” (And they’d say they really couldn’t eat spicy and they would order pad thai.) But we can make it mild, and you can make it mild, too.\n\nThat’s the thing about Thai food as I understand it: there are no strict recipes (unless you’re doing fancy stuff, desserts, etc.). You make it how you like it and the most important thing is that you balance the flavors: sweet, salty, spicy, sour, and bitter (and my friend MSG, the controversial, entirely optional sixth flavor). Not all dishes include every flavor. I’ve indicated which ones are in this recipe and I’ll continue to do that as we go.\n\nFor pad ke mao, we need to balance sweet, spicy, and salty. The sweet comes from sugar. The spicy comes from a mixture of red curry paste, and some chopped fresh Thai chilis, if you’re feeling zesty. For my recipe, the salt comes in the form of fish sauce and oyster sauce.\n\nWe need to talk about fish sauce.\n\nFish sauce has a strong smell. It smells like what happens when you bottle the liquid that comes from fermenting fish, because that is what it is. It is powerful, and it is delicious. It is not a smell you want to wrap yourself in and take a nap, but it is essential to Thai cuisine. It is as essential as salt. Plus it adds a depth of flavor you just cannot get with salt. If you don’t plan on cooking Thai food more often than once or twice a month, I recommend buying a small bottle. I think its shelf life is technically for forever, but it sort of condenses on you with time and you’re already afraid of it, so just get a tiny bottle. They sell really cute super tiny ones at the Asian markets, which is of course where you will be shopping for your ingredients if you are lucky enough to have one in your community.\n\nFish sauce lecture aside, the beauty of Thai food is you can be clever and achieve a similar flavor balance with different ingredients. If you’re vegetarian, don’t despair! Mom makes all her vegetarian dishes at the restaurant with thin soy sauce. If you are just too afraid to use fish sauce, you can use it, too. It’s fine. I’m not judging you.\n\nWhether you’re ready to earn your fish sauce badge or not, when cooking Thai food, just go ahead and close the doors to all the rooms in your house. It’s a sweet little gesture that says, “I care about the way you smell.” It will make a small difference.\n\nLet’s smell up your kitchen with pad ke mao!\n\nDisclaimer: I don’t measure anything. You should include as much of the veggies as you want, but know that if you don’t have a wok, it is going to be very tricky to stir fry the noodles with the vegetables without flinging stuff everywhere. You may have to do small batches, or cook the noodles and vegetables separately. If you must go wokless, find the biggest frying pan of your life—one with steep sides. Good luck.\n\nIngredients:\n\n½ package fresh rice noodles, soaked in warm water for 20 minutes\n\n2 cloves garlics, smashed and chopped\n\nOptional Thai chilies smashed and chopped\n\nSome protein of your choice\n\nSome onion, sliced\n\nSome bell pepper, sliced\n\nSome mushrooms, sliced\n\nSome zucchini (or broccoli, or snap peas, or whatever), sliced\n\nSome carrot, julienned\n\nSome fresh Thai basil\n\nRed curry paste, a heaping tablespoon would be decently spicy—use less if you don’t like spicy\n\n½-1 tbsp. sugar\n\nSomething like 1 tbsp. fish sauce\n\nSomething like 1 tbsp. oyster sauce\n\n2 tbsp. cooking oil\n\n1. Divide the noodles from the package in two. Set aside one half for something else (store in a bag in the fridge). Fill a large vessel with warm water and put the pad ke mao noodles in it. Soak 20 minutes until they feel less brittle.\n\n2. Chop and slice all the things.\n\n3. Put the oil in your pan and set the burner on high if you have a wok, on medium-high if not (so you don’t burn and fling everything). Toss in garlic and chilies and stir around real quick. Be ready to drop a dollop of curry paste on there just as they start to get golden. Stir it up and briefly cook the curry until fragrant. This is the step where you are likely to mace your kitchen. If you do not add chilies, you might just be ok.\n\n4. Drop your protein in the curry paste. Stir to coat and then leave it alone. Then stir more. My grandma says if you stir meat too much it makes it smell. Who knows.\n\n5. Once your protein is looking near done, throw in the veggies. I like to put in one kind at a time, starting with onions and ending with mushrooms. My mom dumps them all in at once, and she is a far better cook than I am—but you should note that she is always cooking in a turbo hot wok and that means she’s got constant, even heat, and ample anti-flinging space.\n\n6. Once all the proteins and veggies are cooked, grab the noodles directly out of the water, let them drip for a couple seconds, and then pile them right on top. You want the moisture from the water still stuck to them, so don’t drain them ahead of time. Dump your sugar, fish sauce, and oyster sauce on top of the noodles.\n\n7. Stir your heart out. The nice thing about a wok is you can spread the noodles out and up against the slopes so they have a chance to cook evenly without turning into a lump. Also, I say “stir” but the gesture is less about stirring, and more about spreading and flipping all of the stuff. You spread the noodles around and then you flip the veggies and meat into the center and then you flip the whole thing and you spread them again. And repeat.\n\n8. When the noodles look done (they should be soft, but toothsome), add the basil leaves and turn off the heat.\n\nShould make enough for 3-4 people, depending if you are eating other things, very hungry, etc.\n\nThis recipe is a true blue stir fry and requires you to have everything prepped before starting so you can quickly throw the next ingredient in and stir stir stir! Be vigilant, or you will mace yourself or worse, burn your garlic. I have an Americanified version that I will share at a later date. It will be much easier to make with or without a wok, and it is kind to people who don’t have access to fresh rice noodles."
