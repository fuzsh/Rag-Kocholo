        "text": "4.8/5\n\nOutstanding\n\nJJulian PeensThis is a beautiful hotel situated in the mountainous region of Beijing. The surroundings and view from the hotel are breathtaking at sunset and weather was extremely good during our stay. STAFF The staff were amount the most helpful and friendly that I have encountered in China thus far and I have been here more than five years and traveled to many destinations. They do not speak English but are very ready to use a translation APP or WeChat to communicate. The staff are very accommodating and even took special requests regarding the menu. FOOD The food was very well prepared and tasted delicious. Their menu unfortunately does not have pictures and the translations may be tricky if you are not particularly familiar with Chinese cuisine. Nevertheless, the food that we at was fresh, tasty and of high quality. We were able to BBQ by ourselves by reserving it a day in advance. The staff will also help you BBQ if needed. LOCATION The hotel is situated far from the city and a sense of comfort can be experienced knowing that you have left the hustle and bustle of the city behind. However, make sure all amenities and personal effects that you may need are with you as you cannot get same day delivery services. There were some construction vehicles which made noise occasionally in the area but I would suspect this is temporary and will soon pass. ROOM The rooms are beautiful and we experiences no dysfunctional amenities in the bedroom. The linen on the beds were crisp and clean, the room was clean upon arrival and daily cleaning is offered. Overall cleanliness was very good. The washroom area is stocked with a loofa, toothbrushes and toothpaste tubes, shampoo, shower gel, conditioner, razor, hand towels, cups and reasonable space for personal toiletries too. POOL AREA The outdoor patio looks out onto the pool. The water was well maintained and some pool toys were provided by the hotel. The pool area could use some maintenance, for example, around the stairs there are a couple loose tiles on the stair face and some ****ing around the footpath could be done. Other than this, the environment is completely mesmerising and leaves one completely relaxed. Calming music is played throughout the day at a low volume. At night, this area is well lit and the scenery beautiful. BAR The bar is well stocked with spirits but a slightly wider variety and maybe the addition of a drinks menu would definitely improve this. ROOFTOP The hotel has a rooftop deck perfect for sundowners and viewing the surrounding mountains. Tables and chairs are provided on the rooftop.\n\nShow more\n\n4.7/5\n\nOutstanding\n\nMMatyasLocated in a very good place. On the edge of a Hutong in an alley. The place is definitely not a 4 star hotel as it was stated on the Trip. The room is very small but the bed is very good. A few members of the staff are very friendly and keen to help but but others are just don't care or straight rude. The hotel has an everlasting sewer smell. Don't bother with breakfast they just unpack some store bought stuff and heat it up. Only Chinese breakfast and toast. Oh and they ordererd a scammer taxi for us to get to the airport on the last day (we paid triple what we paid on arrival even though the roads were empty because of early morning).\n\nShow more\n\n4.7/5\n\nOutstanding\n\nAAnonymous UserFirst, I would say the location is wonderful.It's only fifteen mins of walking to the Forbidden City. However, I might not choose this hotel.The worst Manxin I had stayed. U can find other cheap hotels nearby. While I was checked in, the frontdesk asked me for paying upgrade. After I refused, he became impatient.He even didn't tell me hotel facilities. In hotel, You can smell smoke in hotel corridor.And I found a cigarette butt on lifting lobby. That means the hotel don't have a well management. The last thing I would like to complain is efficiency. My booking didn't include meal.Sometimes I ordered food delivery myself. The delivery didn't pass to me after it had been arrived 20 mins. I called to frontdesk. They just said they were busy at that moment. Would give it to me later. About 15 mins waiting, I decided to take the delivery myself. They put it on a easy take way, and didn't check wtih my room number or my identity.That means others can take my delivery easily.These happened three times. Because of this bad experience, I cannot trust Manxin anymore.\n\nShow more\n\n4.7/5\n\nOutstanding\n\nLLior 莉莉Absolutely amazing time here and so much of it was thanks to the most amazing person ever - Paolo. Before I even checked in the bell hop helped me with the luggage and check in was so smooth. Everyone was so welcoming and warm that I immediately felt happy and bubbly. The room was so thoughtfully prepared to welcome me on my birthday and to make me feel special. There was even a small cake, a fruit platter, and a personalized card. I was absolutely blown away by the level of personalized care and attention to detail. We had some tea at the executive lounge and again were welcomed and had great service. Paolo arranged for some more personalized touches for my birthday party in the lounge including Barbie themed photos on the appetizers and bite sized snacks. He was able to help us with the theme of the birthday party ~ Barbie by designing four different pink cocktails including a gin tonic style drink and a bubbly prosecco based one. We also had the breakfast buffet which had a great selection of food and was separated from the dining tables which was appreciated to better enjoy the food. I really liked the noodle and soup station in the morning especially as it was raining. The butterfly brunch was lovely and very fulfilling. I have nothing but an endless number of positive things to say about my sumptuous room with mesmerizing views and tremendous service. I love staycations and I have to say that this one takes the cake. Thank you all!\n\nShow more\n\n4.6/5\n\nOutstanding\n\nBBingying2158The family stayed at Tangla Yaxiu because the children were taking the college entrance examination nearby. They chose a suite with a desk to facilitate their study. I am very grateful for the hotel's careful arrangement and handmade gifts for the college entrance examination. This effort surprised and touched us. Employee Darren Zhang took the initiative to add WeChat. The butler-style service was in place, and the front desk also solved the small problems encountered at any time. Let's talk about the hardware problems in the room. The facilities are relatively old, the bathroom door is not tight, and the dry and wet separation is not OK. There is water on the ground and I am afraid of slipping. I asked the cleaning aunt for two floor towels to solve it. The location of the hotel is very good. It is close to Chang'an Shopping Mall for shopping. It is convenient to cross the road to the Capital Museum. While the eldest is taking the college entrance examination, it is really time-saving and labor-saving to take the waiter to visit the Capital Museum. 😁 Let's talk about the afternoon tea, which is very friendly to parents and children. The children love the Orleans grilled wings grilled by the tall aunt the most. 🤭 It's a good stay experience. I look forward to staying again next time. 💞\n\nShow more"
