(hereinafter referred to as \"Dawang Xiyin\"), which are responsible for the group's cross-border e-commerce goods receiving, warehousing, sorting and delivery business.\n\nAt present, Zhaoqing High-tech Zone has become the most important shipping base of Xiyin Group in China. Since its establishment, Dawang Xiyin's annual operating income and tax growth have reached 100%, and the two companies have accumulated operating income of about 5 billion yuan.\n\nThe Xiyin Bay Area Dawang Smart Industrial Park project, which has been increased this time, will be built into a cross-border e-commerce operation and smart manufacturing digital factory integrating smart manufacturing, smart logistics and cross-border e-commerce.\n\nThe project will cooperate with Zhaoqing Dawang Zhuchuan Freight Terminal Co., Ltd. to fully integrate the existing storage industry projects and carrier resources in Zhaoqing High-tech Zone, and settle down by leasing and revitalizing the land used for early storage projects, organically combining the leading drive, local resources and the development advantages of the Greater Bay Area, further improving the supporting system of the cross-border e-commerce supply chain, and driving the rapid development of the influx of young and middle-aged population, local labor, logistics, catering, real estate leasing and sales, and promoting the high-quality development of the cross-border e-commerce industry in Zhaoqing High-tech Zone and even Zhaoqing City.\n\nOn the same day, another giant, China Southern Airlines Logistics, settled in Zhaoqing High-tech Zone, aiming to build a cross-border e-commerce international hub cargo terminal integrating functions such as \"export BC (customs inspection) + pre-security inspection + pre-security inspection\", connecting and serving major airports in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, focusing on the development of cross-border e-commerce aviation logistics and supporting industries, and providing \"door-to-door\" services for cross-border e-commerce.\n\nThe two giants jointly chose Zhaoqing High-tech Zone, which also confirmed the booming cross-border e-commerce industry in the area. In recent years, a large number of cross-border and domestic e-commerce industry leaders such as Pinduoduo, Cainiao, and Vipshop have chosen to invest and take root in the district.\n\nAt present, there are 25,000 people directly engaged in cross-border e-commerce in Zhaoqing High-tech Zone, and nearly 5 million cross-border e-commerce goods are shipped from the zone to 160 countries and regions around the world every day. A cross-border e-commerce industry cluster has been initially formed with Xiyin and Pinduoduo as the two cross-border e-commerce giants as the chain leaders, integrating warehousing, supply chain, logistics, labor, and foreign comprehensive services. The total volume of cross-border e-commerce has remained the first in the city for seven consecutive years.\n\nWith location service human resources and other resources, there are many advantages in developing the cross-border e-commerce industry\n\nCross-border e-commerce is the fastest-growing, most potential, and most powerful new foreign trade format. Zhaoqing High-tech Zone does have many advantages in developing the cross-border e-commerce industry.\n\nFrom the perspective of location and transportation, Zhaoqing High-tech Zone belongs to the half-hour economic life circle of Guangzhou-Foshan-Zhaoqing and the one-hour economic circle of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. It takes 40 minutes to reach the two major international airports, Guangzhou Baiyun Airport and the Pearl River Delta Hub (New Guangzhou) Airport. It has the unique location advantage of \"integrating the Bay Area in the east and RCEP in the west\".\n\nIn terms of service network, Zhaoqing High-tech Zone has built several logistics parks such as Lin'an Modern Business Logistics Industrial Park, Vipshop Zhaoqing Logistics Park, Prologis Dawang Logistics Park, Zhaoqing Shitong Bonded Logistics Park, and Dawang Pearl River Logistics Park. The infrastructure is relatively complete and the degree of logistics intensiveness is high. The e-commerce platform and logistics companies in the park have established a close cooperative relationship to achieve resource sharing and complementary advantages. After the completion of Zhaoqing Dawang Cross-border E-commerce International Cargo Station, it will comprehensively improve the efficiency of cross-border e-commerce logistics and transportation, reduce logistics costs, and truly create a port \"at the doorstep\".\n\nIn recent years, Zhaoqing High-tech Zone has vigorously promoted the development of the cross-border e-commerce industry. The district has introduced a number of support policies to provide \"mother-like\" services for cross-border e-commerce companies, carry out the \"industrial cluster + cross-border e-commerce\" pilot, and create a cross-border e-commerce entrepreneurial ecosystem.\n\nZhaoqing High-tech Zone has also actively promoted a series of reverse empowerment measures. Together with CATL, it has fully built the country's first integrated demonstration station for light truck logistics vehicles, which can provide charging and battery replacement services for 100 new energy logistics vehicles at the same time. It has made a major breakthrough in the new energy of cross-border e-commerce logistics vehicles and realized the new energy of Xiyin's circulation logistics routes in the high-tech zone.\n\nIn terms of human resources, the zone has built a human resources service industrial park based on industrial needs, corporate needs, and talent needs. Since its opening in July last year, it has attracted 25 well-known human resources service agencies to settle in and serve more than 40,000 labor and talents in the zone. In addition, the Guangdong Province New Generation Information Technology Industry Talent Public Training Center has also settled in Zhaoqing High-tech Zone, and has established partnerships with 4 universities, 2 secondary vocational schools, and 32 companies.\n\nIn order to meet the experience needs of young employees for diversified and convenient shopping, Zhaoqing High-tech Zone is building Duoduo Neighborhood Center and Xiyin Neighborhood Center, providing one-stop services including catering, shopping, and leisure, strengthening the interaction between the commercial neighborhood center and the surrounding communities, and helping the high-quality development of the cross-border e-commerce industry in all aspects.\n\n\"Here, we can feel the development pulse of the world-class city cluster in the Greater Bay Area. This is why Xiyin chose Dawang, and it is also the source of our decision to invest in Dawang.\" Wang Zhiqing, vice president of Xiyin Group, said.\n\nSupport the manufacturing industry to \"set sail to the sea\" and promote the integrated development of the real economy and the platform economy\n\nSince 2023, Zhaoqing High-tech Zone has taken the development of cross-border e-commerce as an important means to promote high-quality economic development, and has frequently interacted with Xiyin and Pinduoduo Group to promote the establishment of cooperative relations between the manufacturing industry in the district and the cross-border e-commerce platform.\n\nThe main person in charge of Zhaoqing High-tech Zone also led a team to visit the headquarters of Hangzhou Cainiao Group to promote the development and growth of Cainiao Group's cross-border e-commerce business in the district, including the joint construction of a smart logistics park, the introduction of advanced logistics robot manufacturing technology, and the use of Cainiao Network's advantages in logistics technology and data analysis to improve the level of intelligent logistics in the park and achieve more efficient cargo management and distribution.\n\nIn view of the continued increase in investment by well-known domestic and foreign cross-border e-commerce companies such as Xiyin, Pinduoduo, and Cainiao Cross-border, it is expected that the new demand area for cross-border warehousing in Zhaoqing High-tech Zone will exceed 2 million square meters in the next three years, which will become an investment depression in the warehousing supply chain of cross-border e-commerce companies in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.\n\nAt present, Zhaoqing High-tech Zone is striving for the support of Zhaoqing Customs for the implementation of the \"24-hour customs clearance + mutual recognition of electronic locks at different cargo stations\" model, realizing the functions of \"export BC (customs inspection) + pre-security inspection + pre-security inspection\", so that the cross-border e-commerce industry in Zhaoqing High-tech Zone can be transformed from \"storage type\" to \"channel type\" and \"all-round type\".\n\nZhaoqing High-tech Zone will continue to promote the integrated development of the real economy and the platform economy, extend the cross-border e-commerce industry chain, support the \"going overseas\" of the manufacturing industry in the zone, strive to build a cross-border e-commerce commodity manufacturing park, revitalize the vacant factories of existing enterprises, and promote the implementation of the Xiyin Clothing Supplier Industrial Park project.\n\nThis year, the district plans to add 5 cross-border e-commerce companies (customs declaration, freight forwarding, foreign comprehensive services, etc.), cultivate 1 cross-border e-commerce industrial park, realize the turnover of 50 million yuan for traditional manufacturing enterprises to carry out cross-border e-commerce business, and build a cross-border e-commerce cluster ecological community integrating platform, source of goods, warehousing and logistics.\n\nZhaoqing High-tech Zone Investment Promotion Bureau\n\nAddress: 15/F, Fumin Building, Zhaoqing Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone, Zhaoqing, Guangdong\n\nTel: 0086-758-3983186\n\nFax: 0086-758-3983988\n\nEmail: zqgxzs@163.com\n\nThe city's industrial investment promotion landing and park planning and construction exchange symposium was held: Systematically and accurately grasp investment promotion and promote the park to improve quality, expand quantity and increase efficiency\n\nInvest in Zhaoqing 2024-05-29 23:53 Guangdong, China\n\nOn May 29, 2024, the city's industrial investment promotion landing and park planning and construction exchange symposium was held to thoroughly study and implement the important speech and important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping during his inspection of Guangdong, focus on implementing the specific deployment of the provincial party committee's \"1310\", and study and promote the landing of industrial investment promotion and park planning and construction.
