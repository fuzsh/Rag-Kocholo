        "text": "ISLE OF PALMS, S.C. (AP) — Actor Will Patton, of the movies Remember the Titans and Armageddon and the current TNT series Falling Skies, was charged Tuesday with driving under the influence in his native South Carolina.\n\nPatton, 60, was stopped on the Isle of Palms on Tuesday night and charged with first offense driving under the influence with a blood alcohol content of less than 0.10, court records show. The legal limit for driving is 0.08.\n\nPatton was driving a pickup truck seen veering over the center line of the main road through the beach community northeast of Charleston, according to an incident report.\n\nThe arresting officer asked Patton whether he had been drinking, and he replied, “Not too much, a couple bottles … er … couple of glasses of wine,” the report said.\n\nPatton failed a field sobriety test and refused a Datamaster blood alcohol test, according to the report. Patton, a native of Charleston, was released Wednesday on a $997 personal recognizance bond.\n\nThe Associated Press left a message with Patton’s agent seeking comment."
