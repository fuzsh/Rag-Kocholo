        "text": "Welcome to Susan W. Patton Photography! Thank you for your interest in my work. To share a little about my style of photography, I am a huge fan of real life. I love photography that tells a story and makes you feel something when you look at it. My number one focus when I pick up my camera is to capture something authentic. Real people. Real moments. That's it. If this strikes a chord with you, let's chat.\n\nThe bulk of my work is focused on high school seniors. I also shoot families, maternity sessions and engagements, all using a lifestyle approach.\n\nIn terms of lighting and location, I use natural light for my on-location sessions. The majority of my work is done outdoors, in Western PA and Eastern Ohio. I love farms, fields, barns, ponds, parks, woods, walking trails, creeks...anywhere we can think. I also love architecture and urban shoots too. The common thread is the open space and fresh air which seem to bring out the best in people and in my work. It's just relaxing. And fun. My gosh, you'll have fun!\n\nYou may wonder if I ever shoot indoors. Yes, of course, I can shoot inside but I try my hardest to use whatever natural light I can to capture interesting, artistic images.\n\nIf you want traditional, formal portraits...you know the ones in which everyone is sitting in front of a staged backdrop, shirts are tucked in, hair is perfect, and children (even adults) are being bribed or threatened to behave, I beg you to contact another photographer. This type of photography is as painful for me to shoot as it is for you to smile through. It's not my strength and I don't feel called in any way to this style of picture-taking. I do real life. I do silly, unruly, unstructured, wonderfully imperfect and artistic shoots. I expect that most people don't love having their pictures taken. I plan on kids not wanting to sit still for long. Trust me, I get it and I welcome it. It's real life and I love it all!\n\nInvestment\n\nIn terms of time and money, a shoot generally lasts 1.5 to 2 hours. There are three session choices based on location.\n\nFor sessions shot within 10 miles of my 16101 address, the session fee is $225. (Ex. Downtown New Castle, downtown New Wilmington, Westminster College, Shenango/Neshannock/Laurel/Union/New Castle/Wilmington High Schools, Pearson Park, and Cascade Park to name a few).\n\nFor sessions up to 20 miles away, the cost is $325. (Examples include but are not limited to Ellwood City, Harmony, Zelienople, Hermitage PA, Cranberry Twp., Sharon PA, Poland OH, Youngstown OH.)\n\nFor Pittsburgh locations (i.e. Wexford, Oakland, Shadyside, Downtown, Hartwood Acres, Station Square) the session fee is $425.\n\nIf there is another location you are considering, or if you are outside of my general area, please contact me for a quote.\n\nSession fees are now due at the time you book your date. Once payment has been received, you will be notified with a confirmation. Until then, dates are available on a first come, first served basis. Acceptable forms of payment include: check made out to Susan W. Patton Photography, payment through Paypal, or cash.\n\nFor Senior Sessions:\n\nSee Investment section above for session fee options and payment requirements.\n\nPlan for 2 hours including outfit changes and any driving between locations.\n\nSessions include up to three outfit changes. If you need more than three outfits we will schedule a 2nd session and a new session fee will be applied.\n\nFor more information on senior sessions, please call or email me at 412.523.0915 or [email protected].\n\nWhat to expect after your session:\n\nImages will be available for online viewing within 4-6 weeks from the date of your session. You will be emailed a link to a password protected album on my website that you can share with others. From this album, you will be able to purchase prints and various products. If you need to see samples of products or you need more help with ordering, you can set up an appointment at my office. Your online gallery will be available for one year from the date the gallery is made available on my site. After that, the gallery will be removed to create space for new sessions.\n\nPrint and product pricing*:\n\nAlthough the following price list doesn't include all the items I offer, these are the most commonly asked about pieces and should give you a good idea of what to expect in terms of pricing if you order directly from my office via phone or in-person consultation. Please note, if you order directly from your online gallery, prices are 10-12% higher to account for website service fees.\n\nTable top/gift-sized prints:\n\n4 wallets (one image): $12\n\n4x6: $12\n\n5x7: $17\n\n8x10: $32\n\nLarge Prints:\n\n11x14: $90\n\n16x20: $110\n\n16x24: $135\n\n20x24: $160\n\n20x30: $185\n\n30x40: $225\n\nGallery wraps:\n\n8x10: $148\n\n11x14: $175\n\n16x20: $225\n\n20x24: $275\n\n(other sizes available upon request)\n\nFramed images:\n\n8x10: $148\n\n11x14: $210\n\n16x20: $295\n\n10x10 layflat book: 20 pages (10 spreads), up to 20 images. $350\n\n5x7 double-sided flat cards for holidays, graduation, Holy Communion, thank yous, etc.: $2 each (minimum order 50 cards).\n\nDigital download of session images with permission to print: $600\n\nDigital download with USB of session images with permission to print: $625\n\nDigital download of single image with print rights: $50\n\nTouch up fee per image: $5"
