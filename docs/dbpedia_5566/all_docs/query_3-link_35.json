        "text": "Navigating corporate marketing during sensitive periods requires agility and empathy. Reflecting on the recent PepsiCo campaign displayed on a highway billboard, here are some critical points to consider: 1. Relevance of Campaign Content: The campaign utilizes an outdated tagline that may not align with the current mood of the consumer base, especially during a boycott. This can make the campaign seem disconnected or insensitive to ongoing societal issues. You can get back to Porter’s 5 or Kotler’s or any business or Marketing text book for a 1st year business student -I’m not being offensive- back to basics is always a winning strategy. 2. Adaptability in Marketing: Effective marketing strategies must be adaptable. Using outdated content during sensitive times can result in a campaign that feels out of touch, potentially alienating the audience rather than engaging them. -common sense- 3. Internal Corporate Pressures: Large corporations often face the challenge of utilizing substantial marketing budgets within set fiscal periods. This internal pressure can lead to decisions about running large-scale campaigns that may not be the best fit for the current climate, purely to avoid potential threats and nagging questions from management over unspent budgets. -No comment on that- 4. Consumer-Centric Approach: It’s essential for marketing efforts to demonstrate empathy and a strong understanding of the consumer landscape. Adjusting campaign strategies to be more in tune with consumer sentiments can strengthen brand loyalty and community support. -Consumerism sucks man! - In marketing, as in all forms of communication, timing and tone are everything. Staying tuned to the pulse of the consumer and being ready to pivot strategies accordingly is not just good practice—it's essential for maintaining relevance and respect in the marketplace. On a side note: Local alternatives are much better 🍉😉\n\nWelcoming Caroline Hepworth our new Senior Marketing Manager for TradePoint. Caroline comes to us from the manufacturing industry where she spent the last 6 years being responsible for global marketing. While this is Caroline's first role in retail she brings with her a well-rounded perspective and commercial awareness to help continue to move TradePoint forward. Here she is telling us about her move across to B&Q, and some exciting ambitions for the future. “I joined the B&Q team in October of last year, so still fresh to the business. My career has gained me over 20 Years of marketing experience, spanning various industries, from Leisure and Tourism to manufacturing, education and even some time spent working for marketing agencies. For the previous six years I have had a couple of roles working in the manufacturing industry (American-based companies with a global presence), having responsibility for global marketing - from launching new products or creating brands in different markets – it’s been a varied career to date. There were two factors that motivated me to enter the DIY industry. For years, B&Q has had a reputation for being a ‘people’ led business. I have always admired their focus on flexible working, drive for equality and diversity and the sheer size of the business meant a bigger scope for the career opportunities I was looking for. I also wanted to learn something new. Each role I have taken has been in a new industry for me and I believe that’s made me a well-rounded marketer. Having never worked in the retail sector before, I knew I would relish the challenge and unlock a whole new area of knowledge for me. Even though the industries I have worked in have been very diverse - the challenges those businesses face and their marketing objectives have been very similar. Whether it was launching a new range of products to the European market or writing a marketing plan for a company in Africa, the approach is always the same - understand the customer and have that ‘customer first’ mindset – get to know their pain points, challenges, and motivations. That’s always been the starting point in any business I’ve worked in. I think having a broad, global perspective definitely helps. I find that I approach things from a wider business and customer perspective and having worked for businesses of different sizes, I have been exposed to many different functions that have helped shape my commercial awareness and empathy. It makes it easier to collaborate with others, which ends in a better result for the business and the customer. I have big ambitions and we have some exciting times ahead for the TradePoint brand. We are looking at some big, strategic projects and looking at getting even closer to our Trade customers to understand how we can best serve their needs.” To find out more about working at B&Q click https://bit.ly/3tFbcou #BandQCareers\n\nMarketing is great n all. But it can all fall down in the last few feet if the execution isn’t right. Front row seats yesterday for the hottest ticket in town - the IGD (Institute of Grocery Distribution) listening to the incredibly engaging and energetic Rami Baitiéh and his team tell us about their focus areas. In a relatively short time he’s listened to *all* stakeholders, including suppliers, and has turned around Morrisons retailing fundamentals. Whilst it’s undoubtedly a great start, he likened these fundamentals to breathing. You can’t stop - it needs to be natural and unconscious. Also great to spend time with Jonathan Shimmin and catch up with some old friends and colleagues Alastair Porter, Simon Walker, Lee Fretwell and Mark Riley. ====== 🙋♂️ I’m Gareth, and I help food and drink brands get their marketing pointed in the right direction. 🗞️ If you like this post, then subscribe to my (roughly) monthly blog that goes to 2,500 other marketers.

𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐰𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐝𝐞𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐫𝐨𝐥𝐞 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐧𝐲? As the Marketing Manager at Trusc, I oversee team management, task delegation, content review, and ensuring team members are equipped for their roles. I collaborate with various departments to identify marketing opportunities, primarily with Sales but also frequently with departments like construction. Additionally, I organize events, supervise social media, and spearhead our marketing strategy. 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐝𝐨 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐞𝐧𝐣𝐨𝐲 𝐦𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐬𝐜 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐭𝐬 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐧𝐲 𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞? The element that stood out most for me was the company's commitment to personal growth and development. Trusc has a culture of educating and allowing employees to experience different roles within the company depending on what is needed at the time. This is both motivating and fulfilling. 𝐓𝐞𝐥𝐥 𝐮𝐬 𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐣𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐲 𝐚𝐭 𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐬𝐜. I started as a graphic designer in the Marketing Team. Soon after, I transitioned to social media manager.

That is a tough question, but if I was forced, I would have to go with Woolworths. They have a good variety of ingredients I can buy to make my lunches as well as healthy quick little grab-and-go lunches like sandwiches, wraps and salami sticks. I would be raiding Woolworths. Every project is equally remarkable, so check out our TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, or Facebook pages to see these collaborations in action! In summary, Liesl embodies the spirit of creativity, leadership, and collaboration at TruscISP.

I'm Laura Hall, the marketing coordinator at Trident Refractory Specialists, proudly part of the team since 2016. In 2016, amidst Trident's rapid growth, I recognized the need for a robust marketing strategy. With no marketing department in existence, I seized the opportunity and established Trident's very own marketing department. Wearing many hats, I navigated the uncharted waters of shaping and steering our brand amidst this exciting period of expansion. I'm a one-person powerhouse, handling everything from product photography and industrial snapshots to content creation, graphic design, website updates, Google Ads—you name it! While navigating these marketing waters, I also play the role of a \"polifiller\" in the office (yes, you read that right!) amidst an amazing bunch of women. Now, here's a little twist to my story: Refractory is \"technically\" in my blood. My father, who steered this ship for 28 years, and his father before him, dedicated their lives to the refractory industry. It holds a special place in my heart, and now, I find myself working alongside my family to reshape Trident's course. Born into an industry my forefathers embraced, I often joke that I didn't choose this life; it chose me! 😄 Despite studying Public Relations, I discovered a unique place for myself in the industry and company. And let me tell you about having the privilege of working under Ashley James – still one of the wisest men I've ever come across. With his entire life spent in the industry, his insights have been invaluable. In addition to navigating the exciting world of refractory, I'm also a proud mom of two little girls and have the joy of sharing this journey with my husband, who is also an integral part of the Trident team. Now, here's the real talk—this industry is a challenge, especially as a woman in what is often considered a \"man's world.\" Most of our incredible team works away, making it a tough ship to steer. But in this industry, we live by the mantra: if you're at home, you're not making money. Even though there's more to life than money, our industry plays a fundamental and critical role in our country's economy. Someone has to do these jobs, and that's why I have the utmost respect for the individuals who work in this industry. It's a tough one, to say the least. 💪 Grateful to be part of this journey, navigating uncharted waters, and bringing a touch of awareness to an industry that deserves a spotlight. History is what drew me to this amazing idea of working alongside my father and family, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes us! 🔥 Connect with me to stay in the loop on industry insights and connect with Trident Refractory Specialists for potential collaborations. #iam #aboutme #tridentrefractoryspecialists #refractory #refractorysouthafrica\n\nWhat Would Happen If You Stopped #Marketing? When a giant company like Coca-Cola does something, people pay attention. That’s why the company’s decision to axe the CMO role caused waves when it was announced recently. Instead of the traditional C-level marketing role, Coca-Cola will now have a chief growth officer overseeing marketing and a few other functions. The move brings up the question: what would happen if marketing went away all together? Marketing encompasses many aspects of reaching out to customers, including advertising, spreading the word, and understanding customer preferences. Marketing also has some leeway in how it presents products and services, meaning it can often add some flash to a product to make it seem more exciting than it actually is, which can be a huge draw for customers. Without marketing, companies would have to perform based solely on the merits of their products and services. If customers had a good experience and loved the product, they would likely be repeat customers and recommend the company to their friends and family. If the product or service was sub-par, they would take their business elsewhere. That means that companies that didn’t have great products or services would go out of business faster because they wouldn’t have the benefit of word of mouth marketing from satisfied customers. Marketing as a whole isn’t likely to be completely eliminated any time soon, but it can be a good exercise for companies to consider if they could survive without marketing. At many companies, a mediocre product or experience is covered up by flashy, creative marketing that gets customers’ attention enough that they try the brand at least once. They might not actually like the product or service, but the marketing is enough to entice people to try it and maybe even repeat their business. Are your products and services strong enough on their own that customers would be satisfied to recommend them and keep coming back? https://lnkd.in/dDVb6btc\n\nHow would a 38-burned-out international marketing director facing an existential crisis change the beverage industry forever? Here's the story of Dietrich Mateschitz: Dietrich Mateschitz, born and raised in Austria, wasn’t an impressive man at all. It took him 10 years to get a degree in commerce, graduating at 28. He would then spend the next 10 years as an international marketing director at Blendax. But then it hit him: \"All I could see was the same gray airplanes, the same gray suits, the same gray faces. All the hotel bars looked the same, and so did the women in them. I asked myself whether I wanted to spend the next decade as I'd spent the previous one.\" A business trip to Thailand would change his life. After the long flight, he was looking for something to combat his jet lag, and he would find a drink called Krating Daeng. It would instantly remove his jet lag. Later, Dietrich would find out that the maker of the drink was the highest top corporate taxpayer in Japan. Using his contacts from Blendax, he reached out to Chaleo Yoovidhya, a Thai businessman who was selling the drink in Asia. They would keep the drink the same with one big change - make it carbonated. Dietrich and Chaleo would create the Red Bull company in 1984 as a 49/49 partnership, each investing $500k of their own money. The remaining 2% was left to Yoovidhya’s son. They agreed that Dietrich would run the company. But Red Bull wouldn’t launch in Europe until 1987, over 3 years later. What was Dietrich doing all these years? He perfected the Red Bull formula and its marketing. Dietrich reached out to a university friend, Johannes Kastner, who was running an ad agency. Over the next 18 months, they would come up with the marketing slogan and the design of the can. Now that the design, the marketing messaging, and the formula were ready, Red Bull launched their drink in 1987, selling over a million cans in the first year. Today, Red Bull is the most popular energy drink in the world. But how did that happen? Mateschitz made a masterstroke, making Red Bull a marketing company. Production and logistics are outsourced, so Red Bull is only focused on marketing the drink. And it works. Nowadays, Red Bull boasts impressive numbers: • 11.5 billion cans sold in 2022. • 43% market share in the US energy drink market. • Over 800 sponsored athletes, 5 football teams, and 2 F1 teams. We could distill Red Bull’s success into one key thing - having a deep understanding of media. - Follow me at Tanyo Gochev for more content like this. - Join my newsletter below to get access to all my best content.\n\nMeet Our Dynamic Marketing Team at Eden; Zara Igoe, Head of Marketing and Chlöe Johnson, Marketing Coordinator form a formidable partnership, combining their unique skills and perspectives to drive Eden's marketing efforts.
