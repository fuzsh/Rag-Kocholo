        "text": "ABOUT\n\nIn 2012, the Patton Family gifted the 28 acre parcel and historic home to The Town of Hamilton. The Patton Homestead was home to the Patton family starting in 1928, and it was notably home to the great General George S. Patton Jr. (1885 – 1945), the commander who had led the Third Army to victory in World War II, and his son, Major General George S. Patton (1923-2004) along with his wife Joanne Holbrook Patton (1931- 2023).\n\nOn the farm once known as Green Meadows, George and Joanne raised five children and made a lasting impression on their country and local community. They are of course world renown for heroic military contributions over the course of several generations, but it was through Joanne’s dedication to the Hamilton-Wenham community and involvement in a multitude of civic endeavors, that the family is beloved by the Town.\n\nNow that the Patton Homestead is owned and operated by the Town of Hamilton, the grounds are open to the public. People are encouraged to come for recreation, positive community engagement and to host inclusive gatherings for all.\n\nClick here for a Virtual Tour\n\nFree parking is available in the gravel lot.\n\nHolly Erickson, Director\n\nNow working for the Hamilton-Wenham Recreation Department, Holly manages public offerings, as well as private event inquiries. She continues to liaise for the Town of Hamilton between the Wenham Museum, the Hamilton Historical Society and Friends of the Patton Homestead, Inc., and manages day to day property needs. Please contact Holly here for grounds rental, cultural or educational program ideas, or general property information.\n\n*** In addition to being the temporary location for the Hamilton Town Hall, the house is occupied by the Hamilton Historical Society and the Wenham Museum’s Patton Family Archive. Please scroll down for how to contact these organizations.\n\nSUPPORT THE NEW PAVILION\n\nIn May 2023, MCC approved the Patton Homestead for an $87k matching Facilities Grant towards building a covered structure which will aid cultural events & programs. While matching funds for the grant are still being raised, Hamilton’s Select Board has taken the momentous step to posthumously name the pavilion after Joanne Patton in honor of Joanne’s devotion to strengthening the community.\n\nThe Purpose for the Joanne Holbrook Patton Pavilion:\n\nIn 2012 Joanne Patton (b.1931- d.2023) gifted a 28 acre parcel of land to the Town of Hamilton in the hope of protecting the property for all to enjoy and to provide a place where the community could grow through public engagement and cultural enrichment. With the addition of the new “Joanne Holbrook Patton Pavilion” the Town will not only memorialize a woman who made such a positive impact on the Town, but it will also create a reliable gathering space to bring Joanne’s vision to life.\n\nNOW we need YOU to help the Town match the grant! Make a contribution to the Patton Homestead Cultural Pavilion which will provide reliable shelter for events and programs.\n\nGive a donation of any amount to support the NEW PAVILION!\n\nTHANK YOU Mass Cultural Council! The Patton Homestead has been approved for up to $87k toward funding a NEW CULTURAL PAVILION, but we need to match these funds to secure the grant! Please consider a gift in any amount to fund this project. The non-profit, Friends of the Patton Homestead, Inc., who collaborated with the Town to write the grant, are accepting contributions.
