Simply come in the main gate off of Highway 31W aka Dixie Highway.When approaching on northbound 31W, the entrance is on your right next to our sign.\n\nDo not enter Fort Knox through the Chaffee Gate. If you have visited in the past, and have used the Chaffee Gate to enter Fort Knox, this is no longer the way to access the Museum. Visitors no longer need to worry about securing a visitor pass to get onto Fort Knox so it’s never been easier to visit the Patton Museum! Simply pull into our parking lot and we will see you here!\n\nWe are RV, handicap, and wheelchair friendly!\n\nBelow are map directions that link to the museum.\n\nGoogle Map Users – https://maps.app.goo.gl/U4PPkwPoM5EVyLhf9\n\nApple Map Users – https://maps.apple.com/place?q=4561…"
