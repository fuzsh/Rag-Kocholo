If they returned their device for the summer, they can pick it up in the media center.\n\nFreshmen will be getting new devices.\n\nIt is $25 technology free for one student, $50 for two or more.\n\nTo avoid the wait, you can pay online MySchoolBucks.com (you may need to create a new account).\n\nIf you have any questions, please reach out to Whitney Lawson (media coordinator) @ whitneylawson@burke.k12.nc.us"
