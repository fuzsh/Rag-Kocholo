        "text": "Will recently told me what keeps him busy when he isn’t commanding the 2nd Massachusetts Civilian Resistance Group on “Falling Skies. Daytime Dial: Now, aside from “Falling Skies,” I see you’re keeping really busy with other roles. Tell me about “The Girl,” which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival this spring. Will Patton: It was a beautiful script, which we shot in Mexico last summer. I have high hopes for it. I think it’s quite a beautiful story. I really liked the director, David Riker, and Abbie Cornish (who stars) is great. The little Mexican girl who’s in it – Maritza Santiago Hernandez, about 8 years old – was just beautiful. DD: And you were just out of town filming another movie. What movie was that, and what can you tell me about it? WP: I finished filming it in Seattle just last week. It’s called “You Can’t Win” with Michael Pitt, which is a pretty interesting movie. It’s sort of a true narrative about bums and thieves in the late 1800s. It’s based on the novel written by a guy named Jack Black – but not the Jack Black we know. It was a memoir based on his life published in the early part of the 1900s. It was William S. Burroughs’ favorite book. It’s an interesting script, so I’m excited to see how that turns out. DD: Aside from all your work in feature films, TV movies and TV series, I had no idea that you were so prolific in audiobook narration — about 40 books so far, including Jack Kerouac’s “On the Road,” Al Gore’s “The Assault on Reason,” Pat Frank’s “Alas, Babylon,” and many more. You’ve also won numerous awards for your recordings. How did you get into that? WP: When I was a kid, I always sort of lived inside of books. There’s nothing more exciting than being able to sort of live a beautiful piece of literature by reading it aloud. It’s a great thing for actors to do, you know? It’s just you with a microphone kind of doing a little play. I’d think any real actor would be excited by it. It’s hard to do, because it’s really important you don’t try to show how well you can act, and you make sure you’re staying out of the author’s way. You need to keep it as interesting as it really is without saying, “Here’s how good I’m reading it. It’s a tricky little thing, and it’s a constant challenge. I find it to be very exciting work for an actor – as long as the book’s good."
