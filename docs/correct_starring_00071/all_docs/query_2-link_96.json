She has directed very popular films like Om Shanti Om, Happy New Year, Main Hoon Na, Tees Maar Khan, and many more. However, Farah’s 2007 romantic movie, Om Shanti Om, starring the Bollywood superstars, Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone, is still loved by millions.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFarah Khan spoke about showing nepotism in her film 16 years back\n\nRecently, Farah Khan joined Bharti Singh and her husband, Harsh Limbachiya, on their LOL Podcast, and engaged in fun conversations about her personal and professional life. Farah revealed the story behind making the 2007 film, Om Shanti Om. She disclosed that the film was solely based on the nitty-gritty of the film industry, so it was pretty easy for her to write the entire film. She further mentioned that she chose a hilarious way to portray the happenings in the film industry. She further said:\n\n“Tabhi maine nepotism ki baat ki thi, aaj 16 saal ho gaye Om Shanti Om ko. Nepotism ki baat chidhi thi.”\n\nRecommend Read: Ranveer Singh Unveils His Statue At London's Madame Tussauds, Wife, Deepika Skips The Celebrations\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nFarah Khan revealed she wrote Om Shanti Om in just 14 days\n\nFarah Khan further said that the whole story behind Om Shanti Om is based on real-life instances in the film industry. Hence, within a span of just 14 days, she was able to write the entire story of the film. Further into the interview, Harsh asked Farah if she wrote the punarjanam or reincarnation storyline of Shah Rukh Khan’s character ‘Om Kapoor’ within that few days. Farah then said:\n\n“Wo maine pehle likhi thi. London mein main 3 mahine ruki thi Bombay Dreams kar rahi thi, tabhi maine wahan par ye story likhi thi. Bombay Dreams ki story thi ki ek jhoparpatti ka ladka bada Bollywood star ban jata hai, toh maine socha aisa thodi hota hai, inko maloom hi nahi hai. Tabhi maine apna wahan pe draft likha tha ki jhoparpatti ka ladka tabhi star banega jab uska punarjanam hoga ek bade actor ke ghar mein.”\n\nDon’t Miss: Kendall Jenner And Bad Bunny Have Reportedly Split In Less Than A Year Of Dating\n\nadvertisement\n\nFarah Khan mentioned she used to inspect all the extras and junior artists on the set of Om Shanti Om\n\nDuring the interview, Harsh asked the director about her filmmaking process. Farah then mentioned that her process is very organised, and she takes care of the little things. Sharing an anecdote from the sets of Om Shanti Om, Farah said:\n\n“Om Shanti Om mein, I used to make all 200 extras and junior artists jab unka hair and makeup hota tha, unki inspection hoti thi. Ghadi Titan ki pehni hai, nikaalo, 1970s mein thi kya ye. Itna itna detail mein pura aise dekhti thi.”\n\nFarah Khan loved SRK-starrer Pathaan and Jawan\n\nHarsh and Bharti asked Farah Khan which film is her favourite among the recent releases. The latter took the names of the SRK-starrer Pathaan and Jawan. She further revealed that Jawan was better than Pathaan, but she liked the latter because SRK returned to the silver screen after a long break.\n\nadvertisement.\n\nWhat do you think of Farah Khan’s revelations about Om Shanti Om?\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nAlso Read: Shahid Kapoor Yells At Paps After Kids' Annual Day Fest In Viral Video, 'Bachchon Ke Sath Mat Kia..'\n\nAWESOME NEWS!
