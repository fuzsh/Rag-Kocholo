Jessie here, fresh off a (2023) record six softball games in one weekend ‚Äî including three in what was, effectively, a downpour. The softball hot streak included the company tournament, where yes, we returned the trophy to its rightful home (editorial).\n\nThis week: The Google Knowledge Graph, aka, the massive knowledge base of billions of entities and the relationships between them.\n\nJoin our Slack community to chat SEO any time.\n\nLet‚Äôs get it.\n\nIn this issue:\n\nWhat is Google‚Äôs Knowledge Graph?\n\nHow the Knowledge Graph works.\n\nEntities and entity relationships.\n\nTHE 101\n\nWhat is Google's Knowledge Graph?\n\nWhat is it: The Google Knowledge Graph is a database of entities, including information about those topics and the relationships between them. The objective of the Knowledge Graph is to enable Google's systems to \"discover and surface publicly known, factual information when it is determined to be useful.\"\n\nThe Knowledge Graph powers some features ‚Äî including Knowledge Panels and rich snippets ‚Äî in search results.\n\nIt‚Äôs akin to a massive encyclopedia: A dataset that makes sense of all the information on the internet. Google refers to it as a ‚Äúcollection of information about people, places and things.‚Äù As of 2020, it consists of more than 500 billion facts about five billion entities.\n\nThe data in the Google Knowledge Graph comes from ‚Äúhundreds of sources from across the web.‚Äù That includes public sources, licensing agreements the company has (for example, for sports scores, stock prices, etc.), and from content owners who edit their Knowledge Panels (more on this later).\n\nThe ‚ÄúFeedback‚Äù link at the bottom of a Knowledge Panel (and other search features) sends a report to Google about any inaccuracies (which are reviewed by Google).\n\nWhy it matters: Readers seek out the same information in different ways.\n\nThe Knowledge Graph helps the search engine understand what exists in the world and the relationships between those things.\n\nWhen readers turn to Google with queries, it‚Äôs able to see the meaning behind the search.\n\nThe Knowledge Graph enables the search engine to recognize entities or attributes in natural language queries. All the internet's information organized into entities makes for faster retrieval and more accurate information results.\n\nWhat are entities?: Any object or concept that can be distinctly identified is an entity. This includes tangibles ‚Äî people, places, organizations or things ‚Äî as well as concepts, abstract notions or feelings. Google refers to entities as ‚Äútopics‚Äùin reader-facing documentation.\n\nOn queries such as, \"Who is Canada's prime minister?,\" the answer ‚Äî Justin Trudeau ‚Äî shows up on the SERP quickly and accurately. That's thanks to the Knowledge Graph.\n\nOn the right of the SERP is Justin Trudeau's Knowledge Panel, which confirms the entity and surfaces what is known in Google's database.\n\nSearching the query \"Justin Trudeau\" also returns a summary of basic information about the Canadian prime minister ‚Äî all of which is stored in the Google Knowledge Graph. (The SERP also returns a news box in Canada, thanks to the recent cabinet shuffle.)\n\nThe Google Knowledge Graph is not just a \"catalog of objects,\" the company said in a blog post when launching the product in 2012. Rather, it creates and understands relationships between entities ‚Äî how two more topics are connected to each other. It is not just a list of everything that exists on the internet, but rather a map that creates and understands the links between things. The Google Knowledge Graph \"models all these inter-relationships.\"\n\nIn the Trudeau example above, the ‚ÄúPeople Also Search For‚Äù panel on the right hand-side includes related entities: His wife, father (and former Prime Minister Trudeau) and brother, as well as the country‚Äôs opposition leaders. Google understands these individuals are connected IRL.\n\nWhat is a Knowledge Panel?\n\nAlso in the SERP: A Knowledge Panel ‚Äî the clearest signal an entity exists in the Knowledge Graph. This feature takes up real estate in SERPs on desktop and mobile (but the position of the features changes depending on the device).\n\nWorth noting: The Google Knowledge Graph is not the same thing as a Google‚Äôs Knowledge Panel. A Knowledge Panel surfaces (visually, in search results) a subset of data pulled from the Google Knowledge Graph (the underlying data set).\n\nWhat is included in a Knowledge Panel: Google says its aim is to display the ‚Äúmost relevant and popular information for a topic‚Äù in a Knowledge Panel. The information surfaced will vary ‚Äî because ‚Äúno topic is the same‚Äù ‚Äî but generally includes:\n\nA title, summary of a topic and key facts;\n\nA description of the subject;\n\nImages for the entity;\n\nLinks to social profiles and official websites.\n\nDepending on the entity, the Knowledge Panels might include songs, episodes of a television show or the lineup for a sports team.\n\nThere are many results where a Knowledge Panel is a sufficient response. The question, ‚ÄúHow old is Justin Trudeau,‚Äù can be answered directly in the SERP because it‚Äôs a simple piece of data. These are often zero-click searches (which generally have low traffic potential).\n\nThe Knowledge Panel is the most common way data from Google‚Äôs Knowledge Graph appears in search results.\n\nIf your organization or the people who work there have a Knowledge Panel, you‚Äôre likely to see increased visibility in SERPs on related queries.\n\nIn addition, thinking about entities makes for a more holistic news SEO approach.\n\nFocus on topic authority: Instead of aiming for precise, specific queries, focus your strategy on ranking for many queries on a given entity.\n\nThat means writing content and demonstrating your expertise for every facet of an idea, rather than chasing the top spot for one specific keyword.\n\nA ‚Äòstrings not things‚Äô approach\n\nThe Knowledge Graph allows Google to go beyond just keyword matching and return more useful results.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve always believed that the perfect search engine should understand exactly what you mean and give you back exactly what you want,‚Äù the company declared in its original blog post, referring to ‚Äòthings not strings.‚Äô'\n\nFor example, these queries are different words, but concern the same entity:\n\nJustin Trudeau;\n\nCanada Prime Minister;\n\nTrudeau Canada.\n\nThese are informational queries that largely return basic biographical details and related content. That‚Äôs because Trudeau is a known entity in Google‚Äôs Knowledge Graph.\n\nWhile the SERPs vary, they all concern the same person.\n\nThe same is true of an institution. People search for Bank of Canada information in variety of ways, including:\n\nBank of Canada;\n\nBoC;\n\nCanada central bank.\n\nAll three queries refer to Canada‚Äôs central bank. Google will surface the relevant, accurate information because it‚Äôs an understood entity in the Google Knowledge Graph.\n\n(While returning similar results, look at the placement of Top Stories: It‚Äôs highest for ‚ÄòBoC‚Äô, suggesting a higher news-seeking intent.)\n\nFinally, look no further than querying the film roles of Canada‚Äôs most famous ex-Mickey Mouse Mouseketeer: Ryan Gosling.\n\nThe films he starred in ‚Äî from The Nice Guys to La La Land ‚Äî are understood by the Google Knowledge Graph system as entities connected to him. The search, ‚ÄúBarbie movie ken actor‚Äù also returns Gosling‚Äôs Knowledge Panel.\n\nThe SERP makes clear it understands the relationship between the noted entities.\n\nSide note: ‚ÄúKnowledge graph‚Äù refers to any semantic network of data. There are many other knowledge graphs ‚Äî for example, Wikidata.org. This newsletter considers only Google‚Äôs version.\n\nTHE HOW TO\n\nWhere understanding entities matters most\n\nThe importance of entities and the relationships between them is clear on Discover, the queryless platform from Google. Discover does not require user input (a search query), but curates content based on a person‚Äôs interests in topics.\n\nThat means: If your stories on a specific entity (Bank of Canada, inflation, famous Canadian Ryans ‚Äî Gosling or Reynolds) already perform well on Discover, Google understands your outlet to have strong authority in those areas. Once you understand which topics (entities and concepts) work for your publication, double down on coverage.\n\nThis entity-focused work has the benefit of shaping a holistic overall approach to news SEO. Combine the ‚Äòthings not strings‚Äô approach with ‚Äòyour coverage is a tree‚Äô planning, and you‚Äôre well-positioned to effectively serve your audience‚Äôs needs and interests.\n\nTHE HOW TO\n\nThe Knowledge Panel: How to get it\n\nFor readers, SERPs that return Knowledge Panels convey strong authority signals. While it‚Äôs not possible to force your way into a Knowledge Panel, you can try to influence it.\n\nFor the organization: Use organization schema (use the sameAs property to cite your social presence and Wiki entries).\n\nFor reporters: Use the author schema, as covered in our Authorship issue (use the sameAs for all places on the internet your reporters have profiles).\n\nIt is not possible to request a Knowledge Panel. And it might depend on your overall authority, meaning smaller sites are less likely to get that visibility. However, strong signals ‚Äî like correct schema, well-structured web pages, a solid backlink profile, a Google My Business profile, a wikidata.org entry or Wikipedia page ‚Äî work to convince Google the entity is worthy of the feature.\n\nOn queries where Knowledge Panels do exist, users can claim and verify the panel. Start by clicking the ‚ÄúClaim this Knowledge Panel‚Äù button that appears under the feature and follow Google‚Äôs instructions. Once verified, click the ‚ÄúSuggest an edit‚Äù link to make changes for accuracy and relevancy.\n\nThe bottom line: The Google Knowledge Graph is a massive data set that enables Google‚Äôs systems to return speedy, accurate results. Entities and the relationships between them play a key role in the Knowledge Graph. The Knowledge Panel is its most visible display in search results. Your organization can try to influence how these show up by using proper schema, well-structured pages and a solid backlink profile.\n\nShare\n\n#SPONSORED - The Classifieds\n\nState of Digital Publishing: Build powerful SEO capabilities in-house with SODP's Publisher SEO course.
