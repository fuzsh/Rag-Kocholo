        "text": "When you think Bollywood films you think dancing, singing, bright vibrant colours and lots of drama. Well, Om Shanti Om (OSO) checked all those boxes from huge dance numbers to its unexpected plot. Directed by Farah Khan, this film had an amazing cast featuring ‘Bollywood King’, Shah Rukh Khan and the ever so beautiful Deepika Padukone, not forgetting its star-studded cameos, comprising of over 30 Bollywood stars.\n\nThis film follows a junior artiste, Om Prakash who was head over heels in love with a secretly married superstar, Shanti. Shanti’s husband, Mukesh, starts a fire as part of his plot to kill Shanti to keep their marriage and her pregnant a secret. Om tries to come to her rescue but ends up getting killed as well. 30 years later, Om is seen to be reincarnated as Om Kapoor, who is determined to avenge his former love.\n\nExaggerated Elements of Bollywood Movies in OSO\n\nI have never been a follower of Bollywood films. In fact, the only other Bollywood movie I have watched is ‘3 Idiots’. I thought that this film managed to capture the essence of Bollywood movies by incorporating stereotypical scenes and effects that can usually be found in regular Bollywood Films. While others may argue that Om Shanti Om (OSO) was close to being a parody of Bollywood films, I thought that it might have been the director’s way of highlighting Bollywood films.\n\nFor example, in the beginning of this film, there are many instances of over acting. One prime example is when Om Pakrash breaks the news to his mother that he wants to get his name changed. His mother’s reaction to the news was overly dramatised, an accurate depiction of how many Bollywood films are are.\n\nIn scenes where viewers find out that Mukesh and Shanti and secretly married and that Shanti was pregnant, the sound effects and music were loud and dramatic. This scene is another classic example depicting how, many Bollywood movies incorporate exaggerated sounds and music to enhance the dramatic effect of the scene.\n\nOther stereotypical scenes of Bollywood films in OSO like, the badminton dance item between Shanti and Om, shows viewers how the sets of dance numbers in Bollywood films jump from one to another without much link between each one and again, many times these dance numbers are elaborate and overly exaggerated.\n\nDuring the award show where Om Kapoor was nominated for Best Actor, video montages showing him being featured in the movies he was nominated for are parodies of how love stories are usually depicted in Bollywood films.\n\nCast\n\nOSO is known to have one of the most star-studded cast in film history. Ranging from King Khan casted as the protagonist of the film to famous actress back in the 90s and political figure in India, Kiron Kher, playing Om’s mother to, award-winning actor, Arjun Rampal playing the villain in the film.\n\nOn top of that, it featured over 30 A-list actors as cameos, from father-son duo Abhishek Bachchan and Amitabh Bachchan to India’s beauty Priyanka Chopra. Many of these stars were seen in the 10-minute long dance item, Deewangi Deewangi.\n\nI reckon that the appearances of these cameos are present in the film for two reasons.\n\nIt helps add a touch of authenticity. Having that many prominent stars appear during scenes of the award show and the after party makes Om’s fame and success in Bollywood a lot more believable. It helps sell the story of Om being a prominent figure in the film industry.\n\nHaving that many stars in a film is bound to draw in a large crowd. This has clearly been proven effective, with OSO grossing over USD 20 million.\n\nAdditionally, with India’s most well-loved actor, Shah Rukh Khan playing an undying and unconditional lover who is willing to put his life on the line to come to his love’s rescue, it is no surprise viewers are captivated and instantly become fans of the film. Using the cast as a way to pull in audience is a common tactic employed in Hollywood films too, I mean just look at Avengers: Infinity War. With that much of good looks and stardom in a film, are you really shocked by how well received it is?\n\nWesternisation\n\nWhen Mukesh appears 30 years later in the film, Om’s father introduced him as being a top producer who spent 25 years in Hollywood. In this scene, Mukesh penetrating Hollywood was an indication of how well established and successful he was.\n\nThroughout the better half of the film, Mukesh insists that Om addresses him by Mike. Being associated with the west seems to be defining and proud moment for Mukesh. Like many other films, scenes like this are examples of how western references are used to portray success of a person. However, I thought that it was clever how the director portrayed Om’s huge success in the industry by associating him to Bollywood instead. This creates a stark contrast between the ‘good guy’ in the film and the villain. So, let’s break it down. Good Guy = Bollywood, Evil Villain = Hollywood and OSO is a Bollywood film, hmmm I’ll leave you to interpret the director’s intention on your own.\n\nPortrayal of Females\n\nSigh, just thinking of how the women are depicted in this film disheartens me. As a strong, independent female (or at least I try to be HAHA) I am greatly disappointed that Farah Khan- A FEMALE- would portray women as such useless, always in need of saving, helpless, bimbotic beings. Just talking about it is getting me all riled up.\n\nFirst, Shanti is portrayed as helpless and always in need of rescue. AND LET ME REMIND YOU, this happened not once, BUT TWICE. The first time Om came to her rescue was when the set caught fire and she was stranded in the middle of it.\n\nThe second time was, of course, the signature scene in the movie when Mukesh trapped her in the huge ballroom where he committed arson and burnt the place- and her- to the ground. Any normal person trapped in that burning building would find a way out instead of standing there, waiting for someone to come to her aid. Not to mention how her marriage was kept a total secret and that was clearly his decision. I mean if I were her, I would probably go around telling the world instead of accepting his decision to be a kept woman. The way she was portrayed made her look incapable and helpless, putting females in a very bad light. SIGH.\n\nOn more subtle notes, I distinctly remember the scene at the award show when Akshay Kumar lost the award to Om, leaving him infuriated and he took it out on the lady who was sitting on his lap. He choked, hit and pulled her hair. This scene depicted women as being inferior to men are subjected to being tools for men to take their anger out on.\n\nOm was also seen to constantly have three female assistants around him. Even though it can be interpreted as them working for him, it is evident that they are portrayed as having to comply to his every request and accommodate to his temper tantrums, making them seem more like his sidekicks, than assistants in my opinion.\n\nIndian / Hindu Traditions & Beliefs\n\nOSO highlighted various Indian / Hindu beliefs in the film. I thought that this was a very refreshing insight to their culture and traditions.\n\nIn one of the dance numbers, coloured powder is thrown around. This is a reference to a practice of the Festival of Colour, Holi. During Holi, coloured powder is thrown around as an indicator of celebration.\n\nThe belief of breaking coconuts when starting a new project as a symbol of a blessed and smooth journey ahead was also used in the film when Om came up with the plan to scare Mukesh into confessing his murder. I personally think that by adding such touches into the movie not only exposes non-hindu audience of the culture but it also adds a relatable touch for the Indian and Hindu viewers.\n\nOm Pakrash vs Om Kapoor\n\nSpeaking of Hindu beliefs, reincarnation has been a faith that Hindus believe in for a long time. This film utilises that belief in its plot, showing Om Kapoor as a reincarnated version of Om Pakrash.\n\nThis film uses symbols and character traits to convey that message without blatantly telling its viewers, which I thought was pretty smart.\n\nApart from the obvious same-actor-playing-different-characters aspect, Om Kapoor was seen to have a fear of fire which ties in very nicely with how Om Pakrash was killed in the fire while trying to save Shanti.\n\nOm Kapoor was also seen to have the same character habits as Om Pakrash! The way Kapoor touches his hair is found to be the exact same way Pakrash used to touch his, 30 years ago.\n\nThe character that Om Pakrash used to have tattooed on his right wrist was seen to be a birth mark on Om Kapoor’s wrist too.\n\nSuch elements used in the film allows for viewers to connect the dots on their own without the director having to spell it out for them, which I think makes the watching experience a lot more fun and rewarding once you got it figured out.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI really enjoyed this movie as a whole. It had a wholesome and unique storyline that is unlike any I have seen before. Throughout the film, I found myself laughing at some points, welling up at other moments and getting angry at others. While this film had its ‘aww’ moments, it definitely had its tensed moments too. I like how this film had a bit of everything and its tough to pinpoint it as one genre- A Masala as most Bollywood films are. It was captivating as I got to see more of the Indian culture, from their costumes and dances to a few of their beliefs and practices.\n\nBollywood films are very different from Hollywood films. Hollywood films tend to focus on the build up of the movie and delve into the climax of the film pretty quick while Bollywood films tend to be a tad draggier due to the multiple dance sequences. Although these musical numbers can stretch a little long at times, and the entire movie coming up to about 3 hours, there is no denying that this film was a breath of fresh air and very memorable. Up till today, 4 days after watching the film, I still find myself humming to the tune ‘Om Shanti Ommmmmm’"
