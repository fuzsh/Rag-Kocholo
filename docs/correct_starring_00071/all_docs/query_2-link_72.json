        "text": "If there was one Bollywood movie that defined ‘masala’, Farah Khan’s Om Shanti Om could very easily be it. The Shah Rukh Khan-Deepika Padukone starrer had copious doses of drama, laughter, suspense, thrill--you name it. However, what seemed flawless back in 2007 kinda seems far-fetched when you rewatch it in 2020. Not to give out any spoilers (it’s been 13 years, watch it ), but the whole reincarnation/punarjanam plot was the most Bollywood thing Farah Khan could’ve done. We don’t blame her but we do have a few questions.\n\nA) Shantipriya is shown to be a famous actress\n\nFrom the first half itself, Shanti (Deepika Padukone) is shown to be famous. Even if Dream Girl was her debut film, she kept the company of big producers like Mukesh (Arjun Rampal), right from the start. She is even shown to be shooting for another film where she meets Om for the first time. However, no one even cares when she disappears. That too, mid-production? Even Pappu seems to know what happened but that’s all. No legal case, no proceedings, nothing.\n\nB) How does Sandy look like a replica of Shanti and no one notices or tells her?\n\nIn a world where people are constantly comparing themselves to celebrities, how did Sandy (Deepika Padukone) not realize that she looked exactly like a yesteryear actress? If we looked like Madhubala, wouldn’t others--friends, family, acquaintances---tell us? She lands up clueless for the audition because, apparently, no one told her.\n\nC) Does Punarjanam mean carbon copy?\n\nThe biggest flaw in the reincarnation theory used by Khan is the fact that she tried to establish it as a clone-making machine. How else could you justify Om looking the same in both lives? Exactly the same? Looking the same and having a photographic memory of it is stretching it for even by Bollywood standards.\n\nD) Did Sandy also have punarjanam?\n\nHow did she end up looking the same? Did she also undergo the same cloning process as Om? We didn’t quite get the plot here.\n\nE) How did Mukesh plan everything out without getting caught?\n\nMukesh was a mighty chaalu player, right from the beginning. However, he planned the whole incident of burning the studio down to the ground without anyone knowing. Despite them showing security guards, personal guards etc. Imagine dousing the whole place with petrol yet no one finding out. Even for the reports later, did no one find the traces of arson?\n\nF) Was the second half only to teach the villain a lesson? What about real actions?\n\nHow jobless was Om that he dedicated so much of his time only to teach Mukesh a lesson. He’s out here spending money on hiring actors, stylists, production crew, only for a lesson? Did Om not think of getting the police or any real authority involved considering the man he’s trying to nab is a murderer?\n\nLead image credit: timesofindia.indiatimes.com (gallery)\n\nRead iDiva for the latest in Bollywood, fashion looks, beauty and lifestyle news."
