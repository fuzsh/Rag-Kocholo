        "text": "So picture this:\n\nYou open up Google and start typing something you want to look up. You type the term you need to find (Me being a football/soccer fan I am going to say Manchester United). You hit Enter and you’re filled to the brim with at least a billion results of whatever you typed and in record speed too (<1 second to be precise).\n\nThe big question here is:\n\nH ow is it possible?\n\nGoogle uses something called a Knowledge graph to relate results with each other and display similar searches that people can also check out. The definition of the Google Knowledge graph is best given here (from Wikipedia):\n\nThe Google Knowledge Graph is a knowledge base used by Google and its services to enhance its search engine’s results with information gathered from a variety of sources. The information is presented to users in an infobox next to the search results. These infoboxes were added to Google’s search engine in May 2012, starting in the United States, with international expansion by the end of the year. Google has referred to these infoboxes, which appear to the right (top on mobile) of search results, as “knowledge panels”.\n\nLet me show an example of this:\n\nRemember I said my search term was Manchester United. Let me show how the search turned out:\n\nSee the section “People also search for”. This is a Knowledge graph example.\n\nI’m also going to refer to the team as just United for now.\n\nUnited play in the Premier League.\n\nUnited’s bitter rivals are Manchester City.\n\nLeicester City F.C once had a very humiliating result against United so that can be one explanation (I am unsure of this one, however)\n\nInter Milan is a place where a few players came from United very recently\n\nThis infobox is a knowledge graph in action at Google. Every single search result now has an infobox relating the term with other terms or factors that affected whatever you’re searching for (Be it a team or anything else). For a movie search, you mostly get similar movies that go along that same genre:\n\nSorry for going full-on football freak here 😅.\n\nYou can see that most of the movie reference terms include Beckham(Beckham played in one of the movies hence Bend It Like Beckham), Soccer, Football, and so on.\n\nThis is how knowledge graphs work and now let us see an example where I plotted the knowledge graph of the FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) companies.\n\nLet’s get into it\n\nWhat you’re gonna need:\n\nYour trusty OS (Linux, macOS, Windows)\n\nPython ≥3.7\n\nThe packages which I will explain later\n\nSo, the example here involves using the data from Wikidata to get our info for the companies.\n\nTo get the data from the site, Python has a package known as QWikidata which has methods useful to get the data from Wikidata and before you ask me the Holy Grail question:\n\nIs the data clean?\n\nI am happy to say that the data from Wikidata is very clean 🎉🎉🎉\n\nCue heavenly music. 😇\n\nOk then, we first install the package:\n\npip install qwikidata\n\nSo, the next set of packages is just a staple of every data scientist but make sure you have them installed as well (Preferrable with Colab than Jupyter):\n\nimport numpy as npimport pandas as pdimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nThe final checks of installation are these three lines:\n\nfrom qwikidata.entity import WikidataItem, WikidataLexeme, WikidataProperty\n\nfrom qwikidata.linked_data_interface import get_entity_dict_from_api\n\nfrom tqdm.notebook import tqdm\n\nAnd this last one for visualizing the graphs:\n\nimport networkx as nx\n\nOnce everything is set we can get into our code:\n\nAn example of this is given in this post that I read which you can find here\n\nFirst, we specify the companies we need to get:\n\nKG_companies = [\"Facebook\", \"Amazon\", \"Apple Inc.\", \"Netflix\", \"Google\"]\n\nNow the function of getting data from Wikidata is a bit complicated. Each company has a Q-value. A sample can be like this:"
