        "text": "Naveen Uraon\n\nLIFE has come a full circle for Shreyas Talpade who is all geared up for his upcoming release ‘Poshter Boyz’. Shreyas who had earlier starred in Farah Khan’s ‘Om Shanti Om’ had approached his friend Farah to do a special guest appearance and she immediately agreed to be a part of it.\n\nWhen Shreyas met the multi talented Director – Actor on her set to explain the scene to her she suggested that they shoot it right then and there. All agreed and DOP Mahesh Limaye who was shooting an ad-film with Farah at the time readily agreed to helm the camera. Shreyas called the shot which was a single take. While Shreyas was leaving the set his Associate Producer Hadi Abrar nudged him saying ‘Did you realize that you just directed Farah’.\n\nThe shot, with Farah’s impromptu improvisations, turned out to be good and has added great value to the film, prompting her to prod Shreyas to seriously look at direction in the future, as well. A visibly elated Shreyas thanked Farah for taking time out of her busy schedule to shoot for ‘Poshter Boyz’.\n\nProduced under Shreyas Talpade’s own banner Affluence Movies Private Limited Poshter Boyz is all set to hit the silver screen on August 1, 2014."
