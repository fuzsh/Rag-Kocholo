        "text": "Farah Khan recently opened about why she casted Deepika Padukone in Om Shanti Om, why aspiring actors in Bollywood should keep in mind and the importance of being self-aware in the industry.\n\nRenowned filmmaker Farah Khan has some of the most iconic movies to her name. Choreographer turned director, Farah is known for her tongue-in-cheek humour and making some of the most entertaining films too. One among the many was Om Shanti Om featuring Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone. In one of her recent interviews, Farah opened up about why she chose Deepika Padukone for the role of Shanti Priya opposite Shah Rukh Khan.\n\n‘ I Launched Her Because…’: Farah Khan on Casting Deepika in Om Shanti Om\n\nOm Shanti Om was the debut film of Deepika Padukone. Years after its immense success at the box office and in the hearts of the people, Farah Khan recently said,” To launch a hero is on another level because who will give you the money? I launched her because Shah Rukh Khan was there. So, I could take that risk,” in a conversation with Mashable India.\n\nShe further added, “Every director has their own choice. Then one wonders why did that person select them but in the picture it all works out… You can get a break any time, but are you prepared for that break or not? I feel everyone says you wait for the right role. I feel those days are gone. You have to keep acting. You take whatever you get, be it small or big. No one is going to give you a launch unless you are a big star’s son. Sorry to say, but that is the truth… I launched her because of Shah Rukh Khan. He was there. So, I could take that risk.”\n\nFarah Khan’s Advice For Newcomers in Bollywood\n\nFarah Khan herself began as a choreographer in the industry. Soon, she switched to making films. In her interview, she also talked about what should be the approach of all aspiring newcomers in the industry. She casually remarked, “Your mindset has to be very strong in the sense that you have to face rejection every day. So you need to have really thick skin and your belief in yourself has to be next level.”\n\nEmphasising why it is important to be self-aware, the film maker added, “It’s important to be self-aware. When you go out, you need to see who your competition is. Then you will be able to understand that there are better people here or ‘I can do better than them’. When I was an assistant in Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar, Saroj ji had come for ‘Pehla Nasha’. I used to give clap, watching her work. I was self-aware that I could do it and this song I can do better because I won’t do it in a filmy way. I will do it in a new way.”"
