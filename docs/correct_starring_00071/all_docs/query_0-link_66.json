He is in the ICU,\" the official said.\n\nThe actor shot through the day for his upcoming movie \"Welcome to the Jungle\" and was fine. He even joked around with the crew on the set and shot sequences that had a bit of action. However, once he went home, he told his wife that he was feeling uneasy.\n\nHe was then rushed to the hospital but he collapsed on the way. Once he reached the hospital, the medical professionals conducted an angioplasty and is now stable.\n\n\"He is doing well. He is doing much better. We would request you to give us privacy,\" the family member said.\n\nThe actor who has starred in both Hindi and Marathi cinema is best known for his performance in films such as \"Iqbal\", \"Dor\", \"Om Shanti Om\" and the \"Golmaal\" franchise."
