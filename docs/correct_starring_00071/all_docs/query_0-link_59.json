        "text": "Director Farah Khan opened up recently about casting Deepika Padukone in her film Om Shanti Om (2007). She said that she was able to cast Deepika in the film because of Shah Rukh Khan. The film was co-written and directed by Farah and also starred Shreyas Talpade, Arjun Rampal, Kiran Kher and Yuvika Chaudhary in pivotal roles.\n\nSpeaking about this in an interview, she said, “Every director has their own choice. Then one wonders why did that person select them, but in the picture it all works out. You can get a break any time, but are you prepared for that break or not? I feel everyone says you wait for the right role. I feel those days are gone.”\n\nShe added, “You have to keep acting. You take whatever you get, be it small or big. No one is going to give you a launch unless you are a big star's son. Sorry to say, but that is the truth. I launched Deepika because of Shah Rukh Khan. He was there. So, I could take that risk.”"
