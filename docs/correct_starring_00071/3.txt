How was Shreyas Talpade cast in Om Shanti Om?

The Kaun Pravin Tambe? actor revealed that Farah saw him in Dor and that’s when she decided that Shreyas would play Pappu Master in Om Shanti Om. Talpade shared with Lehren, “From day one, I was very nervous, you know, working with Shah Rukh Khan and how is he going to feel because I come from a school where we improvise a lot. So, I was thinking of quite a few things to improvise, but I said I don’t know how Shah is going to react to the whole thing.”

After a couple of hours, Shreyas Talpade gathered courage and thought however SRK reacted, he would tell him what he had in his mind, or else he’d be miserable throughout the shoot. The Mirch actor detailed, “I spoke with him and he was so happy with the whole thing. And then, of course, he is so witty himself, he came up with ten things.”
