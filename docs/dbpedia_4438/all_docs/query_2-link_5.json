        "text": "Financial discipline, accelerating efficiencies and additional strategic metal hedging\n\nUmicore is making strong progress on its 2030 RISE strategic trajectory with significant milestones achieved over the past 18 months. The current macroeconomic environment has changed significantly from when Umicore launched its strategy in June 2022, in particular with faster and more steeply declining precious metal prices.\n\nIn that context, Umicore announced in 2023 that the net total capital expenditures3 for the Group between 2022 and 2026 are expected to amount to € 3.8 billion. This reduction of funding needs compared to the earlier assumptions made when launching the 2030 RISE strategy, results from securing higher-than-anticipated government grants and subsidies, and the partial funding of joint venture capital expenditures by non-recourse debt. It also results from a disciplined capacity phasing strictly in line with customer contracts and orders, an improved utilization of existing capacities in APAC and an optimized, asset-light upstream model, leaving room for highly selective additional customer programs.\n\nIn addition, Umicore has launched the ‘Efficiency for Growth’ program over the summer 2023, a company-wide program that accelerates ongoing efficiency improvements across the different business groups to support both cost optimization, top-line growth and working capital improvement in the context of the 2030 RISE execution.\n\nUmicore expects Efficiency for Growth to deliver at least € 70 million EBITDA in 2024 (included in the outlook provided below) and as from 2025 a run-rate exceeding € 100 million EBITDA.\n\nFinally - and in the framework of its strategic metal hedging approach - Umicore has entered, over the course of 2023, into forward contracts covering for a longer period and a significantly larger portion of its structural price exposure compared to the past approach4 with the aim to reduce volatility, protect future earnings linked to its exposure to certain precious metal prices and to increase visibility on future cash flows.\n\nWannes Peferoen, Umicore’s CFO commented: “Our unwavering focus on financial discipline, the further acceleration of our efficiency efforts, combined with a hedging policy that is more adapted to the current market context will provide us with the best foundation to execute our strategy. We are confident that our teams’ proactive and efficiency-driven mindset will enable us to achieve our company-wide target, thereby making a significant contribution to the 2030 RISE ambitions.”\n\n2024 Outlook\n\nSince the introduction of the 2030 RISE Strategy in June 2022, Umicore has adapted its organizational structure by aligning it with its ambitious growth plan towards 2030. As announced previously, a new organization has been put in place to support the anticipated growth in Rechargeable Battery Materials. Umicore’s business units are from this year onwards housed in four, instead of previously three, Business Groups. The new segmentation still reflects the important synergies and common characteristics, while at the same time bringing increased focus on the different business activities: Battery Materials, Catalysis, Recycling and Specialty Materials.\n\nExternal reporting according to this new organizational structure will be implemented as from the half-year results 2024 to be published on Friday July 26th. The outlook below, for the year 2024, is therefore already presented according to this new set-up. There is no change in the perimeters of Catalysis and Recycling.\n\nOutlook\n\nBased on the current market visibility and all else equal, Umicore expects revenue5 growth in Battery Materials with revenues in the range of € 575 million to € 675 million and an adjusted EBITDA margin around 22%. The ramp-up of new customer contracts in Europe and an improved capacity utilization in Asia will result in a significant year-on-year increase in volumes and revenues from cathode active materials (CAM), while the contribution from the upstream refining activities are expected to remain roughly in line with 2023.\n\nGiven the absence of the one-off that supported 2023 earnings as well as the impact of costs related to the ongoing ramp-up and capacity expansions in Europe and North America, earnings for the full year are expected to remain roughly in line with the previous year. Excluding this one-off effect, the underlying performance in Battery Materials is expected to increase significantly year on year. Revenues and earnings are expected to be weighted in the second half of 2024, reflecting mainly the ramp-up profile of the new customer contracts.\n\nIn 2024, the business unit Automotive Catalysts is expected to continue to benefit from its strong market position. Growth in heavy-duty diesel volumes in China is expected to offset lower volumes in ICE light-duty vehicle applications resulting in continued strong underlying performance. Adjusted EBITDA in Catalysis is anticipated to be slightly below the level of the previous record year, close to current market expectations6, in a context of a lower PGM price environment and taking into account the current strategic metal hedges.\n\nPrecious Metals Refining is expected to post solid underlying performance particularly in the second half of the year, with a maintenance shutdown of the smelter anticipated to impact volumes in the first half. Earnings of the Recycling Business Group will feel the effect of a less favorable precious metal price environment. Assuming current metal prices were to prevail throughout the year and taking into account the current strategic metal hedges, it is expected that the 2024 adjusted EBITDA for the Business Group will be below the level of the previous year, still well above the pre-2020 levels and in line with current market expectations6.\n\nIn Specialty Materials, Umicore anticipates continued strong performance in Electro-Optic Materials, partially offsetting less favorable market conditions impacting the performance of the business units Cobalt and Specialty Materials and Metal Deposition Solutions. It is expected that the 2024 adjusted EBITDA for the Business Group will be somewhat below the level of the previous year.\n\nIt is anticipated that Corporate costs will be € 15 to € 20 million lower in 2024 versus 2023."
