There were no diluting elements. 2) Calulated using Income from continuing operations less net income attributable to minority interests. 3) Net interest-bearing debt adjusted for pension obligation (after tax) and present value of future obligations on operating leases.\n\n“New” Hydro reported income from continuing operations of NOK 2,621 million in the third quarter of 2007, up from NOK 2,581 million in the previous quarter and NOK 1,354 million in the same quarter of 2006. Significant currency gains on hedging contracts lifted income from continuing operations.\n\nOperating profits declined in the third quarter by NOK 1,120 million due to lower aluminium prices measured in Norwegian kroner and seasonally lower sales volumes for Hydro’s downstream operations. The decline in operating results was offset by currency gain of NOK 1,199 million, mainly related to currency hedging contracts.\n\nEarnings before financial items and tax (EBIT) for “new” Hydro amounted to NOK 2,039 million in the third quarter, compared with NOK 3,159 million in the second quarter this year and NOK 2,147 million in the third quarter last year.\n\nResults for Aluminium Metal, Hydro’s upstream aluminium business, declined compared with a strong result in the previous quarter, mainly due to lower realized prices measured in Norwegian kroner.\n\nAluminium Products, the company’s downstream operations, delivered satisfactory results from its Rolled Products, Extrusion Europe and Building Systems businesses, taking into consideration a seasonal decline in volumes and unrealized effects on operational hedges. Hydro’s Automotive and US Extrusion operations remained in a relatively weak state. Downstream market conditions in Europe remained stable, while the North American market continued to decline.\n\nHydro’s Energy business delivered lower results than the previous strong quarter, mainly because of lower spot power prices. The company’s solar power activities yield promising opportunities. Ascent Solar, in which Hydro holds a 23 percent interest, has started a pilot plant for the production of flexible thin-film solar cell modules.\n\n“The third quarter marks the start of Hydro as a leading aluminium company, with a unique energy portfolio as a key competitive advantage,” said Hydro President and CEO Eivind Reiten. “We have been through a period of major change and are now set to grow, with continued focus on operational excellence across our business. We will build on our Norway-based expertise and traditions, with the world as our market. I have great ambitions for Hydro,” Reiten says.\n\nOperating statistics Third quarter Second quarter % change prior Third quarter % change prior year 01.01-30.09 01.01-30.09 Year 2007 2007 quarter 2006 2007 2006 2006 Primary aluminium production (kmt) 1) 435 435 - 449 (3)% 1,304 1,349 1,799 Realized aluminium price LME (USD/mt) 2,597 2,606 - 2,462 5 % 2,597 2,325 2,352 Rolled products sales volumes to external market (kmt) 253 262 (3)% 249 2 % 780 753 1,000 Extrusion sales volumes to external market (kmt) 123 135 (9)% 129 (5)% 392 403 526 Automotive sales volumes to external market (kmt) 2) 29 30 (5)% 40 (28)% 101 132 190 1) Including Hydro's share of Søral volumes (equity accounted investment). 2) Automotive sale is excluding magnesium. Castings volume included for two months in 2007.\n\nAluminium Metal\n\nEBIT for Aluminium Metal amounted to NOK 2,172 million in the third quarter of 2007, declining 12 percent from the strong results in the second quarter of 2007 and 8 percent lower than the third quarter of 2006, mainly due to lower realized prices. Realized aluminium prices in US dollars were relatively unchanged compared with the second quarter of 2007, but declined by 4 percent measured in Norwegian kroner, reducing operating results by about NOK 285 million.\n\nRealized aluminium prices in Norwegian kroner declined 1 percent, compared with the third quarter of 2006, reducing operating results by about NOK 80 million.\n\nHydro’s primary aluminium production, including its share of production from part-owned companies, was unchanged compared with the second quarter 2007, amounting to 435,000 tonnes for the quarter. Production was down 3 percent compared with the third quarter of 2006, mainly due to the closure of the Stade smelter in Germany and the Søderberg line in Årdal, Norway.\n\nAluminium Metal’s share of profits in equity-accounted investments amounted to NOK 275 million in the third quarter, compared with NOK 323 million in the second quarter of 2007 and NOK 385 million in the third quarter of 2006.\n\nOperation of the 50/50 joint venture, Qatalum, between Hydro and Qatar Petroleum is expected to begin production late in 2009 and will add substantial cost-efficient production capacity. Total investment costs previously estimated at USD 4.8 billion (for the entire joint venture) are expected to increase by about USD 800 million. A significant number of major contracts for the project have now been placed, and the partners, together with these contractors, are in process of finalizing sub-contracts with suppliers. It has become evident that the high activity level in the construction market will result in cost increases for some of these subcontractors compared to previous estimates.\n\nIn September 2007 Hydro exercised an option under a long-term alumina agreement with Rio Tinto Alcan (formerly Comalco) increasing the volume supplied by Rio Tinto Alcan from 500,000 mt per year to 900,000 mt per year beginning 2011 and for the duration of the contract through 2030.\n\nAluminium Products\n\nAluminium Products incurred a loss before interest and taxes of NOK 247 million in the third quarter of 2007 compared with EBIT of NOK 355 million in the second quarter of 2007 and an operating loss of NOK 435 million in the third quarter of 2006. The results in the third quarter were heavily affected by substantial negative unrealized effects on operational hedges amounting to NOK 440 million in the quarter, compared with negative effects of NOK 31 million in the second quarter of 2007. Underlying operating results 1) amounting to a positive NOK 288 million for the quarter were 41 percent lower than the second quarter of 2007, mainly due to seasonal declines in volumes. Underlying results improved 7 percent compared to the third quarter of 2006.\n\nDemand conditions for rolled products remained healthy, but results for the quarter were affected by seasonally lower sales volumes and lower Euro margins compared to the second quarter of 2007. Continued good margins for Hydro’s European extrusion and building systems operations contributed to results for the quarter, offset by seasonally lower volumes compared to the second quarter. The U.S. extrusion market declined from an already depressed level following the sharp decline experienced during the first half of 2007. Hydro’s US extrusion volumes declined 12 percent in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, mainly driven by the lost volumes from the closure of the Ellenville plant. Operating results for U.S. operations improved slightly compared with the second quarter as a result of cost-reduction initiatives, but remain unsatisfactory.\n\nHydro is approaching the end of an extensive restructuring and divestment process relating to its downstream business, including total workforce reductions of around 3,500 people since the beginning of the year.\n\nEnergy\n\nEBIT for Hydro’s Energy operations amounted to NOK 242 million in the third quarter of 2007, down NOK 154 million from the second quarter and NOK 82 million lower than the third quarter of 2006. Hydro’s power production in the third quarter was 3.3 TWh, 20 percent higher than the previous quarter and 71 percent higher than the third quarter of 2006. The increased production was more than offset, however, by significantly lower average spot power prices. Nordic spot prices declined by 14 percent compared with the second quarter of 2007 and 68 percent compared with the third quarter of 2006.\n\nBusiness development within solar energy is progressing. Hydro holds a 23 percent ownership interest in US-based Ascent Solar Technologies Inc., which has an advanced position in thin-film technology. Hydro holds a 16 percent interest in Norsun AS, presently constructing an ingot pulling and wafering plant in Årdal, Norway, as well as a 49 percent interest in HyCore ANS, a partnership with Umicore SA of Belgium for development of new cost-efficient solar-grade polysilicon manufacturing processes.\n\nFinancial items\n\nNet financial income in the third quarter of 2007 amounted to NOK 1,282 million, including a net foreign currency gain of NOK 1,199 million and a net interest income of NOK 64 million. The currency gain was mainly due to the weakening of the US dollar against the Norwegian kroner over the quarter, resulting in gains on the US dollar foreign currency contracts. The positive net interest income was a result of a strong cash position in excess of debt.\n\nNet financial income in the second quarter 2007 amounted to NOK 575 million, including a currency gain due to weakening of the US dollar and a positive net interest income.\n\nThird quarter 2006 financial income amounted to a loss of NOK 136 million, mainly due to currency losses resulting from appreciation of the US dollar during the period.\n\nCash exceeded interest bearing debt by NOK 7.6 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2007. Cash reserves of NOK 33.9 billion at the end of the quarter were reduced to NOK 7.8 billion after payment of the demerger debt of NOK 26.2 billion on Oct. 1, 2007 to StatoilHydro.\n\nTax\n\nIncome tax expense for “new” Hydro amounted to NOK 3,042 million for the first nine months of 2007, approximately 27 percent of Income from continuing operations before tax. Income tax expense in the third quarter was positively affected by a reduction of statutory tax rates in Germany, reducing recognized deferred taxes by around NOK 250 million.\n\nOutlook\n\nWith the exception of China, key economic indicators signal slower growth in all major regions. European industrial growth is expected to slow somewhat toward the end of the year. Economic outlook for North America remains weak. China continues its rapid development with industrial production currently increasing at a rate of about 16 to 18 percent on a year-on-year basis.\n\nA combination of high LME prices and prevailing short-term alumina prices has led to increased smelter capacity utilization in China. Including the start-up of new production capacity, Chinese production is expected to increase by about 30 to 35 percent from 2006 to 2007. China’s apparent consumption of primary aluminium is forecast to increase more than 35 percent in the same period. Primary aluminium production is expected to grow about 4 to 5 percent in the rest of the world in 2007 compared with 2006, while corresponding consumption is expected to grow by about 1 percent.\n\nA moderate increase in reported primary aluminium inventories is expected in 2007.\n\nCasthouse products\n\nMarket conditions for extrusion ingot in Europe are expected to remain strong but to soften somewhat. Underlying conditions for sheet ingot and foundry alloys end-use sectors in Europe are expected to remain broadly healthy, however, some softening is expected. The market for casthouse products in the United States is expected to remain relatively weak.\n\nIn addition to the global aluminium market balance, the behavior of financial investors will continue to be an important factor affecting the development of primary aluminium prices.\n\nRolled products\n\nThe European market for rolled products remains healthy, but there are signals of a softening in the market. Consumption is expected to ease in the fourth quarter of 2007 due to seasonal effects. Consumption for 2007 as a whole is expected to decline slightly compared with 2006.\n\nExtrusion Products\n\nThe overall outlook for the European extrusion market is mixed. Demand from the transportation sector remains strong, while a further slowdown in the European construction markets is expected. The German market remains solid, while the French and Italian markets are softening.\n\nThe outlook for the US extrusion market remains poor and an overall market decline for 2007 of 15 to 20 percent is expected compared with 2006. Continuing deterioration in the housing market and the recent turmoil in the financial and credit markets have increased uncertainty and the risk for further deteriorating economic developments. Margins are expected to be under increasing pressure the longer the current downturn continues.\n\nThe outlook for Hydro’s automotive business will be affected by weak US demand.\n\nEnergy\n\nOperating results for Hydro’s Energy business are expected to be volatile in the coming quarters. Both production capacity and spot prices on the Nordic electricity market are heavily influenced by hydrological conditions. In addition, capacity constraints in the transmission grid expose hydropower producers to regional prices that sometimes differ from the Nordic spot price.\n\nAverage water reservoir levels in Norway were reported at 94 percent of full capacity at the end of the third quarter, 5 percent higher than the normal level at this time of the year. Driven by expectations of increased CO2-emission costs from January 1, 2008, the currently high forward price for 2008 compared with the remainder of 2007 may give hydropower producers incentives to defer production from the fourth quarter into 2008.\n\nCurrency exchange\n\nHydro’s operating results are heavily influenced by changes in the value of the US dollar against the Norwegian kroner. A declining US dollar will have the effect of reducing EBIT, while an appreciating US dollar will have the opposite effect. As a result, Hydro has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate these effects. A decline of the US dollar amounting to NOK 1 will have the effect of reducing income before financial items and tax on an annual basis in the magnitude of NOK 3,200 million and increasing financial income (expense) net in the magnitude of NOK 2,800 million.\n\nThese amounts are based on a LME price of USD 2,748 per mt and a US dollar currency rate of NOK 6.16.\n\nConsolidated results of operations - Hydro\n\nBelow is a table presenting Hydro’s actual consolidated results of operations for the third quarter of 2007, including the oil and gas activities that were merged with Statoil on Oct. 1, 2007.\n\nConsolidated financial information Hydro\n\nThird quarter Second quarter Third quarter 01.01-30.09 01.01-30.09 Year NOK million, except per share data 2007 2007 2006 2007 2006 2006 Revenue 44,420 46,529 48,565 137,814 148,053 194,436 Earnings before financial items and tax (EBIT): Oil & Energy 11,041 11,455 12,186 33,663 39,522 48,632 Aluminium Metal 2,172 2,465 2,365 7,170 6,404 7,302 Aluminium Products (247) 355 (435) 1,423 377 (104) Other activities 164 32 30 224 110 274 Corporate and eliminations (547) (109) (217) (1,054) (81) (1,838) Earnings before financial items and tax (EBIT) 12,584 14,198 13,928 41,426 46,332 54,266 Financial income (expense), net 2,264 820 (834) 3,825 602 1,356 Income from continuing operations before tax 14,847 15,018 13,094 45,251 46,934 55,622 Income tax expense (8,722) (9,115) (9,422) (27,767) (32,784) (38,258) Income from continuing operations 6,125 5,903 3,672 17,485 14,150 17,364 Income from discontinued operations 296 157 186 590 423 569 Net income 6,421 6,060 3,858 18,075 14,573 17,933 Net income attributable to minority interests 106 108 238 317 265 273 Net income attributable to equity holders of the parent 6,315 5,952 3,619 17,758 14,308 17,660 Earnings per share attributable to equity holders of the parent 1) 5.20 4.90 2.90 14.50 11.50 14.20 Weighted average number of outstanding shares (million) 1,223 1,227 1,236 1,225 1,245 1,241 Financial data: Investments - NOK million 5,487 4,195 8,083 13,498 17,569 26,869 Adjusted net interest-bearing debt/equity 2) 0.04 0.15 0.11 0.04 0.11 0.22 Debt / equity ratio 0.20 0.22 0.25 0.20 0.25 0.24 1) Basic earnings per share were computed using the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding.
