        "text": "Umicore (EBR:UMI) has had a rough three months with its share price down 31%. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Specifically, we decided to study ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Umicore is:\n\n10% = €377m ÷ €3.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every €1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of €0.10.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Umicore's Earnings Growth And 10% ROE\n\nTo start with, Umicore's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 7.5%. This certainly adds some context to Umicore's decent 15% net income growth seen over the past five years.\n\nNext, on comparing Umicore's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 17% over the last few years.\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is UMI worth today? The helps visualize whether UMI is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nIs Umicore Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nUmicore has a three-year median payout ratio of 36%, which implies that it retains the remaining 64% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.\n\nBesides, Umicore has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 63% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 7.9%, over the same period.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Umicore's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.
