This shift in energy use is supported by the improving economics of lithium-ion batteries. Global battery consumption is set to increase 5x over the next 10 years, placing pressure on the battery supply chain & lithium market. We expect global lithium demand will increase from 181kt <strong>Lithium</strong> Carbonate Equivalent (LCE) in 2015 to 535kt LCE by 2025. In this <strong>Lithium</strong> <strong>101</strong> report, we analyse key demand drivers and identify the lithium players best-positioned to capitalise on the emerging battery thematic. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Deutsche Bank AG/Sydney Deutsche Bank does and seeks to do business with companies covered in its research reports.
