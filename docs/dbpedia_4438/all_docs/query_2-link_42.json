        "text": "Umicore WACC % Calculation\n\nThe weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. The WACC is commonly referred to as the firm's cost of capital. Generally speaking, a company's assets are financed by debt and equity. WACC is the average of the costs of these sources of financing, each of which is weighted by its respective use in the given situation. By taking a weighted average, we can see how much interest the company has to pay for every dollar it finances.\n\nWACC=E/(E + D)*Cost of Equity+D/(E + D)*Cost of Debt*(1 - Tax Rate)\n\n1. Weights:\n\nGenerally speaking, a company's assets are financed by debt and equity. We need to calculate the weight of equity and the weight of debt.\n\nThe market value of equity (E) is also called \"Market Cap\". As of today, Umicore's market capitalization (E) is $2972.333 Mil.\n\nThe market value of debt is typically difficult to calculate, therefore, GuruFocus uses book value of debt (D) to do the calculation. It is simplified by adding the latest one-year semi-annual average Short-Term Debt & Capital Lease Obligation and Long-Term Debt & Capital Lease Obligation together. As of Jun. 2024, Umicore's latest one-year semi-annual average Book Value of Debt (D) is $2962.1717 Mil.\n\na) weight of equity = E / (E + D) = 2972.333 / (2972.333 + 2962.1717) = 0.5009\n\nb) weight of debt = D / (E + D) = 2962.1717 / (2972.333 + 2962.1717) = 0.4991\n\n2. Cost of Equity:\n\nGuruFocus uses Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to calculate the required rate of return. The formula is:\n\nCost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate of Return + Beta of Asset * (Expected Return of the Market - Risk-Free Rate of Return)\n\na) GuruFocus uses 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate as the risk-free rate. It is updated daily. The current risk-free rate is 3.12%. Please go to Economic Indicators page for more information. Please note that we use the 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of the country/region where the company is headquartered. If the data for that country/region is not available, then we will use the 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of the United States as default.\n\nb) Beta is the sensitivity of the expected excess asset returns to the expected excess market returns. Umicore's beta is 0.80.\n\nc) (Expected Return of the Market - Risk-Free Rate of Return) is also called market premium. GuruFocus requires market premium to be 6%.\n\nCost of Equity = 3.12% + 0.80 * 6% = 7.92%\n\n3. Cost of Debt:\n\nGuruFocus uses latest TTM Interest Expense divided by the latest one-year semi-annual average debt to get the simplified cost of debt.\n\nAs of Jun. 2024, Umicore's interest expense (positive number) was $130.542 Mil. Its total Book Value of Debt (D) is $2962.1717 Mil.\n\nCost of Debt = 130.542 / 2962.1717 = 4.407%.\n\n4. Multiply by one minus TTM Tax Rate:\n\nGuruFocus uses the most recent TTM Tax Expense divided by the most recent TTM Pre-Tax Income to calculate the tax rate. The calculated TTM tax rate is limited to between 0% and 100%. If the calculated tax rate is higher than 100%, it is set to 100%. If the calculated tax rate is less than 0%, it is set to 0%.\n\nThe latest calculated TTM Tax Rate = 104.124 / -1387.631 = -7.5%, which is less than 0%. Therefore it's set to 0%.\n\nUmicore's Weighted Average Cost Of Capital (WACC) for Today is calculated as:\n\nWACC=E / (E + D)*Cost of Equity+D / (E + D)*Cost of Debt*(1 - Tax Rate) =0.5009*7.92%+0.4991*4.407%*(1 - 0%) =6.17%\n\n* For Operating Data section: All numbers are indicated by the unit behind each term and all currency related amount are in USD.\n\n* For other sections: All numbers are in millions except for per share data, ratio, and percentage. All currency related amount are indicated in the company's associated stock exchange currency.\n\nUmicore (OTCPK:UMICY) WACC % Explanation\n\nBecause it costs money to raise capital. A firm that generates higher ROIC % than it costs the company to raise the capital needed for that investment is earning excess returns. A firm that expects to continue generating positive excess returns on new investments in the future will see its value increase as growth increases, whereas a firm that earns returns that do not match up to its cost of capital will destroy value as it grows.\n\nAs of today, Umicore's weighted average cost of capital is 6.17%%. Umicore's ROIC % is -21.83% (calculated using TTM income statement data). Umicore earns returns that do not match up to its cost of capital. It will destroy value as it grows.\n\nBe Aware\n\n1. GuruFocus uses book value of debt (D) to do the calculation. It is simplified by adding latest one-year semi-annual average Short-Term Debt & Capital Lease Obligation and Long-Term Debt & Capital Lease Obligation together.\n\nFor companies that report quarterly, GuruFocus combines all of the most recent year's quarterly debt data from the beginning of the year to the year-end and calculates the average.\n\nFor companies that report semi-annually, GuruFocus combines all of the most recent year's semi-annual debt data from the start of the year to the year-end and calculates the average.\n\nFor companies that report annually, GuruFocus combines the beginning and ending annual debt data from the most recent year and then calculates the average.\n\n2. The WACC formula discussed above does not include Preferred Stock. Please adjust if preferred stock is considered.\n\n3. (Expected Return of the Market - Risk-Free Rate of Return) is also called market premium. GuruFocus requires market premium to be 6%.\n\n4. GuruFocus uses the latest TTM Interest Expense divided by the latest one-year semi-annual average debt to get the simplified cost of debt.\n\nRelated Terms"
