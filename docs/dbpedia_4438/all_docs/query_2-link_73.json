As part of the transition process, OpenGate Capital has renamed the business to EverZinc.

In particular the identification and structuring of a suitable financing debt package reflecting EverZinc’s international footprint and business model has been a key element of the transaction.\n\n“Lincoln executed a well-structured, competitive and professional financing process involving a diverse group of potential lenders and provided an excellent execution throughout a complex transaction,” said Fabien Marcantetti, Principal in OpenGate Capital’s Paris office. “Lincoln’s financing knowledge, guidance and thoughtful advice were invaluable in securing a successful transaction.”\n\nAbout EverZinc\n\nWith industrial operations in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, China and Malaysia, EverZinc specializes in three product lines: fine zinc powders, zinc oxide and zinc for batteries.
