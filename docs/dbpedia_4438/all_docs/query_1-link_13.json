        "text": "Introduction:\n\nThis report deals with the case study on Umicore N.V which is a material technology multinational. The case study talks about the impact of Income Taxes in managerial decision making and financial statement presentation. The case study starts with the company’s profile and tells about what the company is and how it is performing currently. While reading deeper you will learn about the tax depreciation method used by the company, capital gain/loss taxations, cost recovery, deferred tax and Income Tax expense. At the end we have given the conclusion in the perspective of Managers and provided some suggestions to the company.\n\nCompany Profile:\n\nUmicore N.V is among those multinational companies which deal with materials Technology especially in metals and mining. It was found in the year 1989 and is headquartered at Brussels, Belgium. The CEO of the company is Marc Grynberg and Thomas Leysen is the Chairman. The company is centred on its four major business groups: Catalysis, Energy Materials, Performance Materials and recycling. But it is now more focused towards the recycling of non-ferrous metals and also the manufacture of specialized metallic and non-metal products. Mining, which was used to be the lifeblood of the company, now plays no direct part in the business.\n\nUmicore is the world largest recycler of precious metals. Battery recycling is also a business unit which comes under recycling and is exclusively focused on the recycling of spent rechargeable batteries from laptops, hybrid vehicles, mobile phones etc.\n\nMost of the revenue of the company comes from its Catalysis business unit and is divided into two divisions which are automotive catalysts and precious metals chemistry.\n\nRecently the company acqu...\n\n... middle of paper ...\n\n...ny should list future tax cost of transaction’s deferred gain as liability. Company should record difference between asset gain and future tax liability as an increase in net worth.\n\nImportance\n\nIt is crucial to company to recognize the delayed tax liability of deferred gain. if you ignore deferred gain and recognize more to the entire asset value increases as again to bet worth, company will overvalue its balance sheet.\n\nConclusion\n\nUmicore’s revenue has increased by 4.7% and net financial debt has decreased by 11%. So is we look at the financial statement the company is performing well but we should consider the other factors as well. After including the deferred tax assets and liabilities the equity is 49% whereas the liabilities are 51%. So the investors will not invest in the company. Hence deferred tax assets and liabilities play an important role."
