        "text": "The global economic growth backdrop has shown signs of improvement, but Canada’s economy continues to underperform. Interest rate cuts are welcomed by highly indebted households, but won’t spur growth until next year.\n\nGross domestic product across the euro area and the U.K. picked up early in 2024 after contracting over the second half of 2023 and business surveys suggest that growth momentum carried over into Q2. The manufacturing sector globally has remained soft but has improved and the service sector continues to expand in most regions.\n\nThe U.S. economy is showing signs of softening with GDP growth tracking below 2% over the first half of 2024 for the first time since 2022 and the unemployment rate has edged higher. Still, U.S. labour markets have remained resilient on balance and signs of a reacceleration in inflation earlier this year will keep policymakers cautious about easing monetary policy too quickly even with a downside surprise in May price growth. We continue to expect the U.S. Federal Reserve won’t be in a position to start cutting interest rates until late this year.\n\nCanada’s economy continues to underperform\n\nIn Canada, per-capita GDP has continued to decline as the economy grows more slowly than the population. Per-capita output is running 3% below 2019 levels and is little changed from a decade ago. That represents a 10% underperformance relative to a 7% increase in per-capita GDP in the United States, but the silver lining is that inflation pressures also slowed enough for the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates for the first time in four years in June.\n\nThe sharp underperformance of the Canadian economy argues for further gradual interest rate cuts this year from the BoC, even with the Fed on hold. But that doesn’t mean the adjustment of households and businesses to higher interest rates is over as past interest rate increases continue to filter through to higher debt payments.\n\nMuch of Canada’s broader economic growth challenges are tied to decades-long economic underperformance that has more to do with an inefficient regulatory backdrop and other headwinds to business investment than the short-run stance of monetary policy. These challenges are discussed in more detail in our new Growth Project.\n\nBoC cuts will still leave interest rates at elevated level\n\nThe BoC’s June interest rate cut followed reductions from Switzerland and Sweden’s central banks, and the European Central Bank followed with a 25 basis point interest rate cut soon after.\n\nThe key Canadian overnight rate is still at 4.75%—well above the 2.25% to 3.25% range that the BoC estimates would have a neutral (neither helping to accelerate or decelerate economic growth) impact on the economy. We assume another 75 basis points of BoC cuts this year, but that will still leave the level of interest rates above those neutral levels and subtract on net from economic growth, just by less than currently.\n\nWe look for Canada’s economy to continue to soften on a per-person basis in the near term before ticking back to positive growth in 2025—led by strengthening consumer spending into next year as interest rate headwinds ease. Business investment is on track to decline for a second straight year in 2024.\n\nHousehold debt servicing costs will continue to rise\n\nWe estimate that about $200 billion in four and five-year fixed-rate mortgages in total are coming up for renewal this year (roughly a fifth of the outstanding balances of those mortgages), with another $275 billion in 2025. Almost all of those will be renewing at higher interest rates even with assumed BoC interest rate cuts.\n\nThe increase in mortgage payments looks manageable when measured against household incomes that have also grown substantially from pre-pandemic levels – and some variable rate and shorter-duration mortgage holders could start to see some relief. The expected payment shock this year will still be large for individual households impacted, but accounts for a relatively small 0.2% of total Canadian household incomes, according to our estimates. But they will keep debt payments rising in the near term even as interest rates begin to fall.\n\nSurging U.S. economy has fewer than normal spillovers to Canada\n\nA long and impressive U.S. run of economic resilience has broadly continued but the spillover effects to Canada have been limited. The U.S. manufacturing sector, where links to the Canadian economy are the closest, has been soft with declines in output for three straight quarters to Q1. U.S. economic growth has, instead, been driven by consumer consumption and government spending—both of which don’t have much of an impact on demand for Canadian exports.\n\nThe strength of the U.S. economy won’t be sustained. Large government deficits will remain a big tailwind, but households have largely run out of savings accumulated during the pandemic. Delinquency rates are rising, and GDP growth has slowed to below 2% in the first half of 2024. The unemployment rate is still low, but is up 0.6% from post-pandemic lows. And firmer price growth in the U.S. earlier this year means the Fed will have to wait longer before cutting interest rates. We don’t expect the first rate cut from the Fed until December.\n\nLower interest rates won’t solve all problems\n\nInterest rate cuts will help improve housing affordability for new buyers in the near term, but a structural undersupply of housing will keep a floor under home prices. Slower population growth after planned federal government caps on non-permanent resident arrivals next year will slow both demand and supply in the economy. Overall, interest rate cuts in the near term will do little to help address Canada’s long-running productivity challenges.\n\nProvincial Outlook\n\nWe’re keeping Ontario (0.5%) and B.C. (0.7%) at the back of our 2024 provincial growth ranking. Clearer signs of an economic slowdown are emerging for Canada’s most indebted households as the lagged impact of high interest rates keeps spending activity muted. Quebec’s economy (0.8%), on the other hand, seems to be turning a corner with record planned capital investments this year. Still, the modest recovery will be on the heels of a nearly flat year for economic growth—keeping three of Canada’s largest provincial economies growing slower than the rest.\n\nA resurgence in fertilizer markets and completion of the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion project should keep the Prairie economies growing middle of the pack with all three outpacing the national average of 1%.\n\nIn the eastern provinces, a resurgence in natural resource production is expected to pull economic growth in Newfoundland and Labrador (+2.0%) back into positive territory after two consecutive negative years for growth. Robust household spending and government investment are poised to boost growth in P.E.I. (+2.1%) and Nova Scotia (+1.6%) in 2024. Conversely, declining capital expenditures are expected to weigh on real GDP growth in New Brunswick (1.1%).\n\nBRITISH COLUMBIA – Consumer resilience is running out\n\nBritish Columbia’s economy grew more than expected in 2023— up 1.6% from a year ago according to early estimates from Statistics Canada. But that momentum is running out. We expect the sharp drop in capital spending intentions will be a major drag on growth this year. Lower interest rates will bring some relief to households and businesses, but this will do little to appease the intense prevailing affordability tensions in the province. We expect stretched affordability to keep highly indebted residents under pressure in the year ahead. Though some of the tailwinds from 2023 have prompted us to upwardly adjust our 2024 forecast—from 0.3% to 0.7%, B.C. is still expected to remain near back of the pack in terms of growth this year.\n\nALBERTA – A brighter economic outlook\n\nAlberta’s economy grew slightly less than expected last year. With most of the softness behind us, however, this provincial economy is likely to kick into higher gear in 2024 (1.7%). Households and businesses—which took past interest rate hikes in stride—have already amped up spending activity in anticipation of rate cuts. We see this momentum picking up further as the Bank of Canada continues to ease monetary policy over the back half of 2024. A slight pickup in oil prices should help as well.\n\nSASKATCHEWAN – Clearer signs of economic rebound emerge\n\nNo real surprises came out of 2023 real GDP numbers for Saskatchewan. Growth was cut by three-quarters last year to 1.6% from the robust 6% recorded in 2022, and, as expected, we’re seeing clearer signs of a recovery ahead.\n\nMANITOBA – Staying the course\n\nWe don’t see Manitoba’s growth rate changing much in 2024 (1.2%), despite taking a solid step back in 2023. Real GDP growth fell by nearly half last year (1.3%) after drought took a toll on the agricultural sector. Utilities production also fell sharply over the back half of the year, forcing the province to import power from other jurisdictions. Strong capital expenditure intentions (+8.2%), particularly in natural resources and manufacturing, will be the major driver keeping growth up above the national average in 2024.\n\nONTARIO – High interest rates catch up with businesses and consumers\n\nThe first estimates for Ontario’s 2023 GDP by Statistics Canada were largely in line with our forecast, reaching 1.6%. Real GDP, however, has been virtually flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis since mid-year, and there are signs that sluggishness has carried over into this year.\n\nQUEBEC – Capital investment and interest rate cuts will boost growth\n\nQuebec’s economy is getting back on its feet after a lull in construction and manufacturing activity, and significant drop in electricity production tipped it into a mild recession last year.\n\nA major public school teachers’ strike further dampened activity in late 2023. The end of that labour dispute in January and signs of recovery in the manufacturing and construction sectors more recently point to a turnaround early this year.\n\nWe expect interest rate cuts and record planned capital investment will get the economy’s wheels turning faster in 2024. We project growth will accelerate from an estimated 0.2% in 2023 to 0.8% in 2024.\n\nNEW BRUNSWICK – Weak business activity to overshadow consumer resilience\n\nWe expect New Brunswick will be among the few economies that will slow down in 2024 as slowing business investment overshadows the strong household sector. Low interest rate sensitivity won’t set the province up for much of a rebound either, given New Brunswickers are the least likely to adjust their spending patterns in response to interest rate movements.\n\nNOVA SCOTIA – Big budget spending, strong household sector support modest recovery\n\nNova Scotia’s economy didn’t take as much of a backstep last year as we were anticipating, growing 1.3% in 2023. A large injection of public funds supported strong non-residential construction investment. At the same time, robust population growth and higher operational government spending kept employment churning—particularly in public administration. Another big budget should help these trends prevail into 2024, kicking growth into a slightly higher gear. This, alongside early signs of recovery in other segments of the economy, has prompted an upward adjustment to our 2024 growth forecast for Nova Scotia from 1.2% to 1.6%.\n\nPRINCE EDWARD ISLAND – Growing faster than most\n\nWith a forecasted rate of 2.1%, P.E.I. is expected to maintain its position at the top of our provincial growth ranking, in line with last year’s performance (2.2%) and well ahead of the national average.\n\nNEWFOUNDLAND & LABRADOR – Economic recovery in the air\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador’s economy took another big step back last year. As expected, gross domestic product contracted 2.5%, according to preliminary Statistics Canada estimates. A steep drop in oil production and lackluster demand for key minerals were the main drag on economic growth, while service industries continued to underperform.\n\nDetailed forecast tables:\n\nAbout the AuthorsAs RBC Chief Economist, Craig Wright leads a team of economists providing economic, fixed income and foreign exchange research to RBC clients.
