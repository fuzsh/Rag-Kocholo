        "text": "Climate change is a challenge beyond carbon dioxide. Methane is about 80 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. This has led to a global response, with 155 countries now committed to the Global Methane Pledge, with a target of a 30% reduction in global methane emissions by 2030. Our Coating Services provide high-quality precision optical filters, which is crucial for the early detection of atmospheric gases, especially methane. We therefore not only strive to minimise our own emissions, but also help our partners detect and reduce methane release from their operations. Find out more about our infrared filters at: eom.umicore.com\n\nA #platinum #plating of the #titanium components is necessary to increase the efficiency of #PEM #electrolyzers for #hydrogen production many times over. We are proud to be able to realize this deposition in a newly developed process with our established platinum #electrolytes that is #safe for humans and the environment. Find out how we are driving forward the energy transition with our #green and #cost-#optimized plating process for porous transport layers (#PTL) and bipolar plates (#BPL): https://lnkd.in/e3ps_2vb #umicore #MetalDepositionSolutions #Electroplating #letsGoForZero #H2\n\nUmicore is proud to partner with the U.S. Department of Energy‚Äôs Critical Materials Innovation Hub (CMI Hub). This collaboration advances our commitment to sustainable and secure supply chains for #CriticalMaterials essential to clean energy technologies. By contributing our expertise in critical materials recycling, we join forces with leading scientists and engineers to tackle critical materials challenges. Jeff Koch, Senior Commercial Manager, says, ‚ÄúThis partnership aligns perfectly with our goals of fostering innovation and sustainability.‚Äù Learn more: https://umico.re/ts4 #Sustainability #Innovation #CleanEnergy\n\nOn #YouthDay we celebrate the potential of young people around the world. üåç‚ú® Umicore is proud to support the next generation through our ongoing partnerships with organizations like UNICEF and SOS Children's villages. Our contributions help these organizations build robust education systems and provide vital support to youth worldwide. Our journey with UNICEF has led to transformative projects: from building and equipping sustainable classrooms in Madagascar and Haiti to empowering the youth in India with STEM education and the UPSHIFT innovation program. üìöAnd looking ahead, we're excited to support UNICEF's initiative to improve water and sanitation in Brazilian schools affected by river pollution. Since last year, we are also a proud supporter of SOS Children's villages, which empowered about 2.000 children by setting up strengthening programmes for families in the DRC. Every contribution we make is a commitment to making a difference, because every child deserves the chance to learn, grow, and thrive. #GivingBackToPeople\n\nPortable electronics help us stay connected, especially during holidays - be it to find your way, take pictures, share memories or call back home to your loved ones. üì±‚ù§ You cannot see us but our technology materials enable to power it, make it functional and face recognize you. And once it reaches end-of-life we can bring them back to life. What's the one electronic you can't leave your house without? #UmicoreSummer\n\nUmicore is filled with #InspiringWomen from diverse backgrounds who are unique in background, role and life story. Today, we shine the spotlight on DongHee, who answers \"How do you prioritize self-care and wellbeing?\" DongHee books her vacations ahead so she can day dream about them, but that's not all she does. Stay tuned and discover who will answer the next question!\n\nUnder the brand name #Nexyclus‚Ñ¢, we offer the world‚Äòs most comprehensive range of fully #recycled #precious #metals - also for precious metal plating. In this way, we not only help to counteract the global shortage of resources, especially for platinum group metals (PGMs), but above all enable our customers to achieve responsible precious metal #plating - in support of their sustainability goals. Find out more about our electrolytes and precious metal components with 100% recycled precious metal at: https://lnkd.in/eKCq__sB #MetalDepositionSolutions #Electroplating\n\nWe are ready for the summer break üòé Pool, beach, mountain, wherever you decide you go, a book is always a great companion. And we were wondering what our experts are taking with them on their summer holiday? Luckily some of them decided to share their summer reading list and how they have a positive impact for them both personally and professionally: https://umico.re/dy1\n\nBloomberg exchanged with our CEO Bart Sap about the complexity and the extent of the car industry's -- and society's -- transformation from combustion engines to electric powertrains. The interview followed the publication of Umicore‚Äôs first-half 2024 results and an update on the ongoing review of our Battery Materials division, which suffers from the overall EV slowdown. Next to opportunities, there are plenty of risks in this still-emerging and capital-intense industry which requires the build-up of a supply chain. However, the upshot is: electrification will come! Read the full article: https://lnkd.in/efk8MFVh\n\nToday we announced our half-year results: Group revenues for the first half of the year amounted to ‚Ç¨ 1.8 billion and adjusted EBITDA amounted to ‚Ç¨ 393 million. In recent months, short- and medium-term growth projections for the electric vehicles market have been scaled back substantially, significantly affecting Umicore‚Äôs Battery Materials business. Today, we share the elements of how we are adjusting to this new reality. In the coming months, we will continue to thoroughly reassess our Battery Materials activities, always in close alignment with our customers and partners. We are shaping a new way forward and will share the outcomes during a Capital Markets Day in Q1 2025. Our foundation businesses continue to provide strong cash flows and returns, evidenced by their robust performance over the first half of this year. This solid base enables us to bridge the current headwinds while we reposition us to seize new opportunities. Read the full press release here: https://umico.re/gxi"
