        "text": "Filiepe Deforche: Thomas, I remember vividly our very first conversation – it must have been at least 20 years ago when you were appointed CEO of Umicore, when you shared a compelling vision of how to transform Umicore. You have been very vocal about the importance of sustainability and you have put your money and time where your mouth is. Thank you for being with us today.\n\nJacques Bouwens: You are obviously well-known for sustainability and are highly committed to it. On a personal level, what does sustainability mean to you?\n\nThomas Leysen: The definition that I often refer to is the definition given by an English author, Jonathon Porritt. He defines sustainability as ‘the capacity for continuance into the long-term future.’ This has to be the end goal for our planet but it also has to be the goal for any organization. Sustainability is very much about the long term – thinking about how to engage with current activities and at the same time projecting yourself into the future, and doing this whilst integrating the planetary as well as societal boundary conditions. It is important to start there in order to define what you have to do today.\n\nFiliepe Deforche: When it comes to sustainable development, what is your personal drive and when did that become a motivator for you?"
