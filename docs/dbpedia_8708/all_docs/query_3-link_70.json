Along the way, the actress meets and falls for rugged First Mate John Driscoll (Bruce Cabot). Upon arriving at a mysterious island, Ann is taken hostage by natives who prepare her as a sacrifice to the enormous ape Kong who rules over their jungle. But when Ann is rescued and Kong is captured, the real trouble begins.\n\nSpecial introduction to the film and a Q&A following with John DiLeo, prominent film historian, critic, and author of seven books about classic movies.\n\nThe Milford Theater Bar will be open one hour before the show, serving wine, beer, cocktails and concessions!"
